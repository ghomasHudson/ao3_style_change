“Tell me how I shall be remembered over a hundred years from now,” he said, eager and encouraging.  “Go on, Watson.”
“I do hope it was nothing illegal, Holmes.”
“Please don't call our landlady a silly old trout,” I said, frowning.
He smiled at me.
“A piñata in the shape of a moustache?”
“Oh god, John, wait,” he hissed.  “Oh, god...”
“Gallantry runs in the family, I see,” said Holmes with a smile.  “May I ask what your plans for the future will be?”
I'll admit, perhaps not the best course of action in a busy restaurant with an unwitting partner.
I could not help laughing.  “A little!  And here it is almost nine-thirty.  I should say rather more than a little.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Holmes passed a thoughtful moment casting complaint in sotto voce.  His face took on an impish look; he seemed intent on making mischief.
“Very probably a kitchen knife.  Of course, the lady cannot remember this, and Stone would not have known.  A bread knife would well suit the close description of the wounds.  So, where then did it all stand?  Talmadge was dead.  Mrs. Barker was working with her false memories as best she could.  Dawkins had the skull.  What then for Stone?  And here was his cunning.  Stone did not wish to be implicated with the skull's ownership if anything should happen to go wrong – for example, if Mrs. Barker remembered fragments of what happened on that night.  With no skull in his possession, Stone thought himself clear of firm accusal.  Mr. Dawkins was quite unaware of the scale of deceit, by the way, Watson.  It appears that Stone was working on a plan that would allow him greater profit from the skull when the dust had settled from the murder.  A closer involvement with the 'tour', a greater persuasion over Dawkins in some direction, who's to say?”
I shook my head.  “Then we
Holmes sipped his wine.  “John, please don't start with all your
evening, Holmes, I do appreciate your kindness.”
“Oh, you,” I said.  “You're at those tricks of yours again.”
“Nor is mine any of yours,” said he.  “Oh, Watson, I am only teasing.  Although still, all the same –
We stopped all of a sudden then, and listened to the sound of singing coming from the far end of the house.  The most curious timbre; both cracked and forlorn, with a top-note of glee.
A minute later, he tried once again.
“You're a cuddler,” I said.  He kissed my chest.  “The more you know.”  A thought occurred to me.  “That document!” I said.  “We never found it.”
magazine holds an annual awards, with the winners voted for by their subscribers, and I have won within my category.”  I smiled now.  “Isn't that marvellous?”
“There can not be very many inside our hedge,” I said, still prickled.
Our new friend gazed at us, blinking, from his knees.
“The Holborn,” said he.  “I am buying you lunch.  You look as if you are about to faint.”
The Holborn was, as always, a heaving hub of hungry diners.  By Holmes's influence we were allotted a small table by the window, and there we sat, looking at each other across the table cloth.  We both seemed lost for words all of a sudden.
“It is like I said,” replied the fellow, “by my coming here and telling you.  I suppose you are a sceptic?  Scientists most often are, and the same goes for detectives, as the paths often converge.  Hmm!  As it is, I have no proof.”
And he sat and smoked, and I unpacked our bags, and we looked forward to what must be later and the grand mystery in waiting.
Tomorrow – when it arrived – brought a great deal, as it transpired.  We were late to rise, the pair of us, and we stumbled to the sitting-room to discover much had changed.
“She went as white as a cotton sheet.  She stepped back from the open window.  She let out a tiny scream.  And oh, I couldn't bear it.  I couldn't stand that I had made her so distressed, that she should feel so very badly by my confession.  So I turned upon my heel and ran away.  I admit that I am a coward.  I put as much distance as I could between the two of us.  Well, my ma knew that something awful had happened by the look on my face.  She promised me that she would make a visit to the gables, to wait for Augusta to make an appearance at the window or in the garden.  Just to see how she was faring.  Ma was too terrified to ring upon the bell, or to announce just who she was.”
“Don't be ridiculous,” I said.  I watched him as he crossed over to see Dawkins once again and to strike up a conversation.  Sulking and off-kilter, I mooched along a dusty aisle.  This one was filled with Mayan treasures: beads and pots and ancient weaponry.  One case appeared much cleaner than the others.  I peered in with no great interest, but something called to my attention.  I looked around for Holmes who was approaching at that moment.
“What do you mean,
All this while I had been taking notes and quelling my urge to chuckle, for this fellow was surely a madman on the run from the asylum.  I looked to my friend to observe his reaction.  To his credit, Holmes did appear to be listening politely.
“Good morning, Holmes.”  He had replaced the book upon the shelf.  As I passed, I could not help but cast a quick glance at the spine to see what field of research my friend was working on.
“I don't recognise the writing,” said my friend.  He frowned.  “Watson, why are you snorting?”
Holmes raised his glass.  “Well, we should drink to it,” he said.  “I think next time, we'll dine at Simpson's.  Their roast beef is very good.”
And that set us to mirth, and on to other, more sensible topics better suited for the day.
The morning was sun-filled, warm and bright.  I entered the sitting-room to find Holmes standing at the bookcase, flipping through a large black tome.  He snapped it shut as I approached.
“I can't exactly join you at the window, John, so you'll have to theorise alone.  Is he looking up?”
Holmes had stooped to scrape the cold fragments of the hearth.  I saw him collect something – quite small – between his thumb and index finger and examine it most intently with his lens.  I leaned over to see what it was, but he straightened up immediately and thrust his hands into his pockets.
“It's time for your surprise,” he said.  “Prepare to be impressed.”
“We are quite settled in that way,” I said.  “We have a lady by the name of Martha Oaks, who lives nearby and helps us out.”
“Mr. Holmes!” exclaimed our visitor, staggering three steps into the room.  “My name is Jack Talmadge!  I am a persecuted soul!”
And, well!  He was a fine one to be talking!  I looked around, and spied a violin propped up against one wall.  “You play the violin,” I said in awe.  (How I wished that I had spotted it before.)
“I'll be a wretched mess 'til then,” I said.  “I
“Mr. Eugene Dawkins?”
“Mr. Talmadge, I am a detective, not a therapist,” Holmes said severely.  “Has a crime been committed?  Is there someone who threatens you?”
He shrugged.
“Oh, why is that?”
“Quite well,” I said.  I lay back down.  He joined me; raised himself upon one elbow.
He tutted.  “No.”  He waved a hand towards one wall with built-in bookshelves.  “What do you see?”
He set to tinkering with the dial, his ear pressed to it most intently.  I sat down upon the bed and watched him work.  Victor and Gregson were hovering awkwardly in the doorway.  I motioned that they should be quiet, that they might not upset my friend's concentration.
My friend sniffed.  “What is the point of a card if you don't know who it's from?” he demanded.  “What, really, is the point at all?”
“Yes.”
I felt a swell of raw emotion in my gut; a yearning draw towards this fellow sitting opposite, so calm yet so forlorn – and who I wanted very desperately to comfort.
is coming from.”
“I'm making tea,” I said, “for the first time in I don't know how many years.”
I returned to Baker Street, and once more rang the bell.  “Please could you give this note to Mr. Holmes?” I asked.
did you deduce that.”
“Thank you,” he said, his lips fast to the tumbler.  “Thank you, upon my word.”
“Was Mr. Talmadge in the habit of locking his study door when he was inside the room?”
I told him something of my own youth, not painting over my more dubious adventures.  For although they were now firmly in the past, I felt that Holmes would want to know; to arbitrate that I was honest and sincere.  He listened patiently, attentive to my rambling.  “I like your hands,” he said.  I stopped, looked down, examined them, confused.  “They're strong and capable,” said he.  “They should be smaller, for the size of you.”
“For a fellow who knew nothing of carpentry,” I said, “it seems you have a natural talent.”
Holmes's face dropped just a little.  “Because you are my
“Why don't you consult your good old Index?” I offered hopefully.  I pretended to be busy with my shirt-cuff.
“How marvellous.”
“From
I registered my sleeves in some dismay.  Evidently, I had brushed them on the passage wall, as streaks of dust and grime were now presenting clear as day.  “Oh blast,” I said.  I took my handkerchief, and dabbed, but ineffectually.
“You are not staying the full weekend?” I asked, considerably dismayed.
– well,
to play?”
“I haven't found it yet,” I said.  “Have you?”
“You are of the notion that I possess a magic wand?”
“Yes, I saw her.  Try to be patient, John.  I had to ask for directions to her kiosk, for it is somewhat off the main stretch of road.  I found it – with some trouble – and the lady.  The Gypsy May Baron is an amiable old woman, articulate and lucid, with an atrocious sense of dress.  We had a pleasant conversation.”
“I know.”  He struggled to the upright, and we settled side by side.  We were both painfully aware of sporting stalks, and we did our best to hide them.  “I didn't think we'd go this far.”
“Doctor!” said she.  She retracted her hand.  “I came to clear the tea-tray and to enquire as to what you both might care for your lunch.”  The good woman sniffed and frowned, craning her neck into the room.  “
Later that day, once back at home, I made a critical decision.  I would take a leap of faith, and I would court Holmes.  I would woo him.  Whatever hyperbole might fit the mark.  I wanted him – and in a way I'd wanted no-one else before.  The feeling dazed me, made me reckless.  I bought two tickets in the stalls for a Wagner night at Covent Garden that weekend.  And if he turned me down – at least then I had tried, and I would try again.  I spent a restless night, anticipating all the words that he might say to put me firmly in my place, wriggle away, declare himself aloft, aloof, uninterested.  By the morning I had worked myself into a colder sweat than I felt pleasant, but took a cab to Baker Street, clutching my tickets, firm in resolve.
“Er, the sender is a smoker, male, in old age or ill health, and well-to-do?”
Victor appeared much fascinated by the process of this enquiry.  With wide eyes he tracked my friend, his face so hopeful and expectant of some positive result.  I might have told him that Holmes was not given to revealing a detail until he so chose – and which was usually with a grand, dramatic flourish at the denouement.
“Yes, of course, I'd be delighted,” I replied, a gallant stoic to the end.
“It isn't even lunchtime.”
“The Green Room is the only room which has two beds,” said Mycroft Holmes.  “Whether you offered, or were asked, it made no matter in the end.”
“Yes, yes,” he snapped, his face a scowl, “this is breakfast, whoop-de-doo.”
“Strange conundrums are my speciality,” my friend replied.
He disappeared.  I heard his heels upon the tile, fading to silence, and I stood there like a statue, mossed and obsolete in misery.  I followed him, at length – or tried to, at the very least – but he was gone; the hall was empty, and the offices were locked.
,” said my friend.  “If you
“Oh, welcome, welcome,” said the fellow.  I took a moment to regard him.  He was tall, of average build, but with a boding fleshiness about his jaw.  His eyes were grey, intense, and piercing.  He waved a fulsome hand towards the hall and stairway.  “There are some other guests already, you must meet them.”
“My name is Roger Sloan, and I live close by the National Gallery,” he explained.  “Not that that has much to do with anything.  I simply came here to warn you, Mr. Holmes, and that is all.  I have followed your casework with great interest – I see your name appear in the papers all the time, it seems, these days – and so I suppose you are something of a hero to me.  An inspiration, if you will.”
“Thinking of
We looked at one another.
“A cup of tea?”
For now, I opened chests and peered inside them, brushing cobwebs to the side, sneezing and spluttering.  How could all of this accumulate in such a brief expanse of time?  I side-eyed Holmes, who was now dirtying his trouser knees in front of some large box of curling papers, scrolled and ribboned, neatly bundled, and I watched him as he flung them every which way, rolling underneath a bureau in the corner of the room.
“But--”
no 'O' in 'Eldritch'.”
By eight-thirty, I was ready, with my bags all packed to go.  I sat with Holmes upon the bed, and watched him fiddle with his cuffs.  He was sombre, and it worried me.  “Is everything all right?”
“I thought the same of you!”
“Nothing's true,” I said, blindly.
,” he said.  “John, I don't want to hear it.  I don't--.”
“Do you imagine that if you were carrying them, they would not clank?”
“Well, not the way that Oaks pronounced it,” said my friend.  He chuckled then.  “Oh John, don't pout.  Let's sit down here and watch the sea a while.”
We smoked our cigarettes, and neither one of us seemed to find the will to tear his eyes away.
“I meant each word,” I said.  “I've hurt you; I'm so sorry.”  I took a breath.  “Please can we talk?”
We found a quiet bench, and sat.  Holmes sighed, and turned his face towards the morning sun.  “Watson,” he said, soft, “what do you want from me?”
“Yes.  Love letters.  In his own hand, but they're signed off with a different name.  He posts them to himself.”
Isn't it so pleasant, though, to have someone with whom to talk this way?  A love, to yammer nonsense with, to share your egg and cress, your beef and mustard, and all the rest of it.
I felt a flutter in my chest and puzzled wildly for the time it took to eat my second slice of toast, and finish off the eggs.  I thought that I should stay close to the fire today – the weather was quite filthy – and perhaps read some George Meredith.  I hoped that that might please my friend.  I was not sure as why the latter point seemed so important to me, therefore I opted not to dwell on it.
Once home, my friend curled himself up with a city directory, and notebook and pencil.  By now it was late morning, so I called down to Mrs. Hudson for some sandwiches and tea.  This whole affair had me quite rattled – not least the adventure with the window – and I wondered how on earth Holmes might proceed in tracking down the mystery visitor.  I dared to ask him as much, as he leafed through the pages.
, our bodies arching, tensing, taut, to our release...
“You're living dangerously,” I whispered.
Holmes looked up at last from the signature scrawl.
“Why in heaven's name did you put your fingers in the paint can?” I enquired.
The next day was wretched: raining, dark, and cold.  I grumbled through my morning toilet, and reached the sitting-room to find the fire lit, to my relief, and a fine breakfast on the table, and Sherlock Holmes digging his spoon into the middle, largest dish.  He looked up as I entered.
Here it was, and here we were, such was the novelty, wrapped in it.
.  My eyes fled down the hall in hope of rescue.
“I don't know who that is,” said Holmes.  “You never mentioned him.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There was toast and eggs and coffee, and we ate well, and at some point we found ourselves sat on the sofa with a cigarette apiece.  I yearned to touch him, yet I knew that I should not.  We were too new to one another; still too raw and tentative.
This fact intrigued my friend as much as it had astounded me.  He detoured and together we went to meet the merry trio.  The taller of the three, the fellow with 'my' moustache, as Holmes described it, was the most garrulous.  He introduced himself as Jacob Stone – a research librarian – and these were his friends, a married couple, Mr. and Mrs. Simeon Dickens.  I would have placed all three of them at around thirty years of age and well-to-do.
“There is nothing whatsoever the matter with my right arm,” said Sherlock Holmes.
, we would perish...
My blood, now heading south.  My head a faint, my fingers trembling.  Those fingers, in a tremble, raised my glass up to my lips.  I took a swallow, placed the glass upon the table, turned to look at him.  “I'll take you,” I said softly.
you.”
It was a Wednesday, and Wednesdays were always slow, or seemed to be.  I leaned back in my chair, and cast my eyes down to my desk.  Set upon it: one foolscap notepad, a drying inkwell, a pewter pen-rack, and a shallow tray of mahogany where I filed all my loose papers.  A glass paperweight, that served no useful function but to sit aside, neglected, caught the light from my sole window, only serving to remind me that life bloomed outside; yet here I sat, drilling my fingers, yawning.
Our Blue Room, until the morning.
“My ears itch,” he added then, still of the inclination to be wearisome.
“I don't care,” said he, still pulling on my jacket as we lurched towards the exit.  “Gregson is an imbecile.  Lestrade is a farcical bungler.  We should go home.”
Of all the exasperating situations that a man might find himself within, I had found myself within one.  The year was 1881, the early part of it, and I had recently found well-appointed rooms in London with, I was discovering, a lunatic.
Holmes was running his fingers across the wooden panels below the dado rail.  The exact spot proved to be elusive until at last, the touch of a spring and a panel drew down to reveal a large safe box.
exclaimed the one side, and:
“Of you,” I said, now open, vulnerable before him.
“I can do it myself, Watson,” he said.
“It is for one of my short stories,” I said with dignity.  “And this is a letter from my publisher.
I rose, and finished buttoning.  I combed my hair through quickly, and moved over to the window to look out across the dappled grass.  I frowned, then, as I focused on the bushes near the gate, for a dark figure was half hidden there, but oscillating, hesitant.
“I really do not understand anything now,” I said.  “The gardener and the old woman
“Mrs. Hudson with the tea,” said Holmes, his ears attuned to sounds from half a mile away, it seemed.  He sprang up, strode to the door and pulled it open.  Mrs. Hudson, with the tea tray, blinked up uncertainly, her boots about to set upon the landing, but her nose a-twitch in itching curiosity.  “Yes, thank you, Mrs. Hudson, very kind of you, most kind.”  Holmes drew the tray into the room and closed the door.  “Sandwiches
It would have ruined everything.
you put it all?”
“Then I will show you,” I replied.
“Hell's bells,” I said, “I hope these walls are thick.”
My friend's eyes twinkled, and he drew me closer to him.  He held my chin and kissed me.  His lips were cold still from the winter, but his tongue was hot and amorous.  We clung in our embrace for half a minute, all raking hands and juddered breath.  We broke apart at last, both of us singularly affected.
“How is that wound of yours healing, Holmes?  The stitches are due to come out.”
, in hopes of some amusing article to read.  I scratched my head.  And scratched again.  The itch did not abate.  A fresh itch sprang up in another spot, behind an ear.  I scratched.
My eyebrows rose.  “I'd like to think so,” I replied.  “Are you a competent consultant?”
“You have not lived at Baker Street for very long?”
Lestrade pushed a box of cigarettes across the desk towards us.  He tossed a matchbook as an afterthought, and watched us as we lit and smoked.
Repressed desire and alcohol is scarce a merry mix.
Wouldn't you know, but the next day my friend was called away to Cambridge on a case.  In rank dismay, I read the telegram in which Holmes indicated days, if not a week before he might return to London.  I stomped around the house at Upper Wimpole Street.  I did not want to be there, and if I did my best to hide that fact, I fear I did not do it very well.  Miss Marsh adopted an expression that was pained quite early on, and my housekeeper steered well clear of me.  I telegrammed to Holmes most every day, with declarations of an escalating fervour.  He was distant in return, which only anguished me the more.  On the sixth day, I got notice he'd be returning by the evening train, and heaven knows the other half of London must have heard my whoop of joy.
“You are not serious?” I asked.  I drained my glass.  “How is that so?”
A raggle-taggle terrier bounded up from out of nowhere.  Excited by the two new friends within its province, it jumped and barked and showed great sport, its scrufftail wagging hard enough to set the body to mad tremor.
“It looks rather vulgar when
Victor stared.
“It is not who
When we arrived at Baker Street, we both were slightly out of breath.  To my dismay, I saw a figure on the step, leaving the house.  It was my friend.  I raised my voice, called a
I heard him exhale.  Nothing else was forthcoming.  The atmosphere had soured and I had not the faintest notion as to why.  Eventually, I made my excuses and retreated to my bedroom for some respite.  It was barely half-past-five and I was already dreading dinner.  Holmes's moods were so mercurial, impossible to predict.  As I lay there on the bed, I heard him tune his violin and set to scraping some discordant twelve bar dirge.  This repeated for some minutes, each more erratic than the last, and I hoped that it might end soon.  I raged quietly at the futility of loving a man who could never return the emotion.  A man who only spoke of the softer passions with a gibe and a sneer.  A man whom, despite all of that, I still desperately loved, so forsaking all others.  I brought my hands up to cover my eyes and considered myself as the sorriest chump.
I joined him on the window seat.  “I
My friend raised his eyebrows.  “The skull?”
“I declare that you just provided me with the most exquisite imitation of a sucker-fish,” Holmes declared.  “I trust you enjoyed it?”
“I am recovered, yes,” said he, in a soft Spanish lilt.  “But as I am sure you must appreciate, your news came as a terrible shock.  Mr. Holmes, I swear to you now that I did not harm my mot--” (and here he stopped himself and winced and then continued) “-- my mother,” he determined, a little proudly but with a little guilt between.  “My
“You have no recollection of what might have occurred, or where the skull is currently?”
“I am adjusting,” I said, hedging all my bets.
“To me,” the little dandy said, “you are
, and relished
A bustle from behind me and a loud, abrading bellow informed us Mycroft was in a near and irked proximity.
My friend scowled.  “Don't play reverse psychology with me.”  He sipped noisily at his coffee.  One eye dawdled up to peep at me.  “Thank you.”
still in love.”
So I watched him while he ate his cake, and then I wondered as he smiled behind his pipe exactly what he might be smiling at.  The secret would reveal itself in time, I thought, and so resolved to think no more about it.
.”  He took my arm and led me from the confines of the pot plant to the harbour of the bar, where we bought whiskies and then found a discreet corner, where we sat to watch the hustle back and forth.  “That woman is wearing a ridiculous gown,” said my friend.  “It's all frou-frou and muddle.  If her escort doesn't step on it and rip it half to shreds then I'll be more than half surprised.”  He continued with this commentary, much to my own amusement, as we sipped our drinks in comfort.
“But--”
“Forgive me,” I said, “if I fail to see how you can be effectively aerodynamic through a pair of twill trousers.”  I thought for a moment.  “Your theory might work very well, however, if the pair of you were garbed in swimming costumes, and you were cast into the middle of the Serpentine.”
.  If she possessed a poor memory, then surely she would have had difficulty in recollecting with such precise detail the peculiarities of the skull.  Also, of where she was and what it was her intent to purchase when she last encountered her errant cousin, Eugene Dawkins.  Besides other things.  Her memory appears only to malfunction around the time of the murder.”
“Whatever it is, it is gorgeous,” said Holmes, amidst much plucking and scraping.  “I cannot wait to learn more.  Gregson is tiresome, catching such a late train.  I would far rather take the ten o'clock.”
Shoulder to shoulder, as we were, felt oddly intimate.  The corner of my eye sought out his profile, any inch of him I could.  I watched his hands, those long cool fingers, as they moved gently to the music, and I felt him shift and shuffle in his seat during the rousing bars that Wagner, I was finding, was inordinately fond of.  And so the evening passed this way, with my attention quite divided – but the happiness I felt could scarce be matched.  Some hours later, we rolled out into the night, the concert over, but with what catalyst to come?
“Oh, no,” he said.  “That is all right.  I think that I might --”
“Watson, you're ingenious,” said he, “we'll have a haul there, mark my words.”
Holmes twists around to look at me.  He is smiling, his eyes are bright and full of tenderness.  He releases one arm from the sheets and reaches out for a handful of me.  My right hip.  He squeezes, experimentally.
And our visitor turned and stomped towards the door, then down the landing and from the stairs to the front door, which rattled and banged in his colic wake.
“Oh, don't you dare,” said Sherlock Holmes.  “Or would you take me for a bigger fool?”
“Mr. Holmes, sir.  Dr. Watson,” said he at last, “it has been the greatest pleasure, all these years, and I'd like to thank you now again for giving me my chance when I was just a little sprog.  You'll never know how much that meant.”
“I quite understand,” said Holmes, sitting beside her.  “It must have been a most terrible shock.  Was Mr. Talmadge a good employer?”
He chuckled softly.  “And
“Let's catch up now,” I said.  I rolled him over in the bed.
Mr. Talmadge frowned and thought.
Holmes had been more than usually introspective this past week, and although he professed it made no difference now, as to whether he resided in the city or the country, and declaring he was quite finally exhausted of the former... and yet...
He caught me by the elbow and we sailed back out into the street.
“Mr. Holmes,” puffed Mrs. Hudson, as she pushed our door half open.  “Another visitor for you.  This gentleman is a Mr. Sloan.  He says it's most important.”
“Well, no,” said Sherlock Holmes.  He fretted with his coat lapel.
He gaped.  “You wish to... accompany me... the next time?”
“Dr. Watson,” he called out.
“What is it?”
to know,” replied the slight inspector.  “What he gets up to in his spare time, I really couldn't say for sure.  He's a more private chap than most, but very helpful in his way.  He'll seldom take the credit for any casework he assists with.  That's odd, because he's not a modest fellow – as I've no doubt you are aware, if you've spent time with him, ha ha!”
And Holmes, as through a standing mist of trumpets and confetti, puffed out his chest and remained as immodest as he has always set to be.
I dropped our bags into a corner and briefly contemplated calling down to Mrs. Hudson for some tea.  But far too drowsy for even that, I headed into Holmes's unused bedroom for a horizontal space.  The bed was neatly made, the sheets still fresh.  I pulled the curtains to, removed my jacket and my waistcoat, and curled upon the covers where I quickly fell to slumber.
“You look pleased,” I said, stating the very obvious.
Holmes coloured slightly.
“What is tomorrow?”
My tongue was in his ear.  “I'm going to take off all your clothes,” I said.  “I want to see if you will blush.”
I frowned at my friend's unfeeling state.
“Not now.  My schedule's free for a short while.”
“Oh, time.  That dreadful bore.”
“It will be so nice to have another face around,” said she.
“What
“I'm sure I will.  Whatever is it?”
by the by.”
The disruption upon the other side continued for some seconds.  A thump, a slamming door, and then some footsteps to my rescue.
“You need me?”
“She was.  Didn't I just tell you so.  Well, after she had done with grabbing my elbow and giving it a shake, do you know what she said?  Of course you don't, because your ears are filled with cotton-wool.  She said
“Holmes?  Did you just lock this?  Let me in.  It is absolutely frigid on the landing.”
Holmes's lip curled up, amused that I had exerted such great effort to keep him company.
“But of what?”
“Please take a seat,” I said.
“What news of him, then?” I enquired.
Still entwined, we made our way back to the house.
“I'm in a wet patch,” he said, grumbling (not several minutes later).  He wriggled closer, threw an arm across, and nuzzled up.  I kissed him, on his crown, and he purred out, much as a cat.  We held each other, tighter, 'til:
Gregson speared himself a pickle and crunched it down with satisfaction.
.”  Holmes propped his head upon his hand.  His eyes were fixed upon my own.
Nothing I cared to study now.  But here was what I sought: a later chapter in the book, one boldly titled in a curling font,
“By magic,” I said.
His lips curled back, his teeth exposed.  If he had been a terrier then I should have feared that he might bite me, such was his conflict.
“Well, there are eggs – the painted, papier-mâché sort – hidden across the house.  We have to find them.  And the team with the most eggs by twelve o'clock wins a small prize.”  Holmes rolled his eyes.  “Some piece of tat, no doubt, but
“Holmes, that is horrible,” I said.  “But how did Mrs. Barker kill Talmadge?”
“Watson, the
“Thank you,” I said softly.  There seemed so much more I could say, but I could not think what.  My tongue was tied dumb.  My friend seemed similarly affected; he turned to depart.  The door clicked shut.  I listened while he padded down the stairs, entered the sitting-room, and from there into his bedroom.  All was now quiet.
, it must be thinking to itself.
He scowled.  “I have my doubts that you're a doctor,” he said, apropos of nothing.
“My dear Watson,” said Sherlock Holmes, “if you have suffered a flea infestation, then I must beg you to at least have the decency to admit to it.”
We found two eggs inside the music room, and one tucked inside a billiard table pocket.  There was one egg, crushed and forlorn, under the hatstand.
Sherlock Holmes was there, re-sprawled across his bed.  He raised his head as I came in.  I remained silent; crossed the room to my own space, and picked my novel from the table, sat myself amongst my pillows and commenced to read.  The corner of my eye saw some activity.  Holmes was watching me covertly, twisting slowly round to gain a better angle for the purpose.  I ignored him, all the same.
“Oh, I see,” said Mycroft Holmes.  “I see it now, just how it is.”
“What do you promise?”
“Oh,” I said.  “You heard.”  I peered around him to the room behind, which seemed a pleasant space to live: tall windows, and mahogany, and tasselled rugs and sofas, dappled over with pale sunlight.  My face must have been wistful, for Sherlock Holmes looked at me strangely.
I repeated the mime for the sake of comprehension.  It involved several twirls of an index finger and a repeated stabbing motion.
“Abuse of privilege, Mr. Holmes,” said the Inspector, after an interminable pause.  “Unprovoked violence against random suspects in our cells.  Accepting bribes.  Well, we don't tolerate that sort of thing here at the Yard.  Not any more.  I like to think we are a better bunch than we once were.”
I pulled the door wide open, but the vision on the doorstep bid us hesitate.
“He finds these things quite difficult,” I whispered, in a confidence.  “But you know what he is like.  He has a good heart, despite it all.”
“I do not think so,” I replied.  “Holmes, you are a better and a kinder man each day, I hope you know that.”
“The shutters are open,” Holmes noted.  He stepped forward and rang on the bell.
Mr. Dawkins puffed his feathers as a proud peacock might do.  His cheeks assumed a pinch of colour.
“Come through, let's make a pot of tea,” he said.
“Occasionally,” said Sherlock Holmes.  “I will admit, occasionally.”
“I don't think so.”  He didn't sound entirely sure.  “I thought they'd all been thrown away.”
There was an interim while Holmes tugged open drawers, rifled the contents.  The desk was a snowstorm of paper.  At length he straightened up and banged hard shut the bureau lid.
“I can't have this conversation,” I said tiredly.  “We're
“Well, no.”
“Never mind all that,” said he.  He now leaned forward in his chair.  “What do you say we play a game?”
And we were too aware, that moment, of the bustle and the voices all around us, and we both wanted a quiet place, to be alone, be intimate.
,” he spat out.  “I saw you walking with a...
“I remember only a few words,” I whispered, “and nothing of what happened.  All of us were very drunk.”
Well, well!  What of our wager, you old swine?  Now it's a three horse race!  Ha ha!”
The door pulled inwards, wider, and the form of that odd gentleman appeared in larger intricacy.
“This is the place?” I looked about me.  “But the room is almost empty, Holmes.  A bed, a chair, a wardrobe, a dressing table...”
“You believe her to have a greater involvement in this affair, then?”
“How could you not be,” I reassured him – for he was currently more querulous princess than consulting detective.  “The handsomest fellow alive!  But playing you would drive
“His life had been so full of promise,” I replied, my voice flat, toneless.  “But life did not turn out the way he wanted it.  The damned drink,” I added.  “It took him in the end.  I miss how he was.  When we were both boys.  I grieve what he could have become but did not.”
I glanced at Holmes.  “Indeed we are,” I said, a smile upon my face that drew a like one from my pal.
.  You came home early.  You interrupted me.  I've moved the... thing... into my bedroom now.”
without you, John.  I need you here, to keep me sane.”  He dropped a wink.  “I also need you in my bed, to keep the
“Aha!” I said.
“Do you mind terribly?” I asked.
I glanced over at his handsome head, bent over as he scrabbled on the rug for his tobacco pouch.  He straightened up and caught my eye.  “The Persian slipper is empty,” said he with a frown.  “Ergo, I forage.”
I desired so strongly to kiss him, and I wondered what he would have done if I had.
“I have a telegram,” he said.  “And one is better than nothing.”  He ripped it open, scanned it rapidly.  “Hum.  It is from Lestrade, who reports that a thorough search of the Talmadge residence revealed no trace of a jasper skull.  They managed to open the safe in the main bedroom, and it confirmed what Talmadge told us – that it was full of his papers and deeds and not much else.”
“Yes, I am glad to say she is.  There's nothing left for me to do.”  I hesitated.  “I will go.”
“Tell me more of this old woman,” my friend interrupted.  “She interests me particularly.  How often does she appear?  Have you approached her?  Does she do anything apart from stare?”
I stripped him slowly, and he squirmed and undulated, the colour rising in his cheeks.  When he was bare, I knelt and looked at him in awe.  “Every thing that I was dreaming of, and more,” I said.
“That was considerably
“I want you very much,” I said.  I sat upon the bed edge, almost touching knee to knee.
, of course, but really, I don't want him here.  He's difficult.”
“I wrote and told him,” I said softly.  “He was a gentleman about it.  I haven't heard from him since then.  Oh, Holmes, I wish that I had told you, after we had both declared ourselves.  I had thought you would not want that.  My past history.  The weight of it.”
“I'd like to try,” I said.
“Holmes,” I said, amused and quite delighted, “I have a card!”  I paused a moment to reflect.  “I don't usually receive cards.”  I scooped up the envelope to examine it, frowning at the script.  “I don't recognise the writing.”
“Well, I would.”  I took a sip.  “I'd grow it back, though.”  (He hid a smile behind his hand.)  “You've never been in love.”
one hundred years from now.  A popular actor of the day, shall we say, just for the sake of it.”
“No,” said Holmes.  “I don't suppose you would.  I have an old friend at the docks who--”
I leaned to capture him, to cup his chin, to kiss his luscious mouth.  “I love you as I've never loved before.”  A cliché?  Never mind.  I held him to me, and he nestled close.  We watched the specks of dust float in the air for senseless minutes, endless time.  We left the secret room on tip-toe, closed the doors, fastened the catches, to the study, and the hall again.  Wouldn't you know it, Mycroft Holmes was there, just exiting the library.
“Let me just finish up here,” said he, “and then I shall come and rip open the letter.”
“Humpf,” I said.  “More is the pity.”  I filed my records and did a little paperwork.  The afternoon was stultifying.  By four o'clock I claimed defeat and retired upstairs to my rooms.  I washed and changed, and took an early evening meal at a small restaurant nearby.  I had made plans to meet up with an old friend for drinks, and therefore I made haste to not be late.  At half-past six I knocked upon his door, and found myself within his cosy sitting-room not many minutes later.
“It will leave me the house and effects.  But how am I to repair all that is needed?  The roof is in a shocking mess.  The walls are worse.  Who would care to purchase such a property?  And I cannot afford to live here by myself.  Goodness knows how my aunt managed.”  He shook his head.  “It is a worry, I can tell you.”
yet, before he chose to answer me.  “Not very large,” he said.  “I have one elder brother still alive, and that is all.”
Pike yanked his arm free, face red with spite.  “Just having a little
“I'll need more coffee, then, I think.”
I found my way out to the street, and looked around.  The passers-by seemed like so many yelping dogs; the noise assaulted me.  I hastened to a carriage, and I threw myself inside.
“But that is not all,” my friend continued.  “It all appears a little strange.  But Victor has gabbled on so as regards his late aunt, that I am unsure how wholly embellished or precisely bizarre this affair stands to be.”
The front door bell rang out below.
“You didn't have a happy childhood,” I said, aware at last.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“How lovely!” I said, stupidly.  I listened as he told me of the detail, and I made small interjections to be helpful.  And if I moved a fraction closer to the fellow, it was pure accident; and if my eye caught his and lingered, then I blamed it on his narrative: so very
I sat up straighter in my chair.  “What did you do?”
My face must have seemed blank, for now he rolled his eyes and sighed.  “I'm a consultant,” he explained.  “I've been brought in just this minute as regards the Hon. Cole Ramsey.”
“That I will,” my friend replied.  And so our talk veered back to topics that excluded that fair gentleman, and by and by I felt myself relax, and conversation seemed a jolly thing, and whisky sodas better, and by the time the clock struck ten I felt my head begin to spin, and I bid Stamford a good night, my two feet reeling me from chair to door to street and, by some miracle, back home again.  My rooms were cool; unwelcoming.  I sighed, and hooked my coat onto its peg.  I stretched and yawned.
“So you did,” said my friend.  “Well done, Watson.  Now
'Dickie' signalled his arrival with a sally of grunts and the thud of a barrel.  An amiable man in his middle age, broad shouldered and grizzled, he gave our questions a similar parry.  We ordered our drinks and our meals and selected a table by the window.
“Nothing really of the sort,” he said, “but upon my word, you know, my world's been jiggled upside down.”
I turned upon my heel, therefore, and retreated back upstairs to bed, to spend a sleepless hour with my book.
“Tomorrow, John, I promise you,” said Holmes, “things will be clearer.”
“I begin to,” I replied.
I gaped around me at the mess.  There were peppermint humbugs by the dozen, a hundred pennies, and a wild array of hairpins, and then somehow, for insane reason, one whole round fruit cake, bashed and dented.
Stamford peeled himself away from his small clique, and with his pal, the fellow Martineau, both joined me at the door.
I blinked and focused on his face.  “Best not to ask then,” I replied.  I saw him flush a little, frown, consult his notebook, make a scribble with a pencil.  “Are you born of a large family?” I asked, now quite determined to find out just what I could about this beautiful enigma.
I raised an eyebrow as the morning mail was thus deposited upon our breakfast table.  I flicked a finger through the pile.  A bookshop advertisement sheet; a 'begging' letter; a final demand; and last of all, the card addressed to me.
I placed down my bags, and frowned.  “Don't be a child.  Now then.  I shall call down for some tea, and perhaps Mrs. Hudson will bring us some of that nice cake that she baked yesterday.”
Now I glared at my impossible friend.  “I just might do that, Holmes,” I said.  “This very afternoon, in fact.”
“This is hopeless,” I said.  “It is as if they did not exist.”
“That's it,” I said.  “When we get home, I am most certainly going to murder you.”
“Indeed I do,” I said.  “And that still holds.”  The air caught in my throat.  Was that the truth?  What was my friend about to say?
“For goodness sake,” I replied, “I don't wish to arm-wrestle you; I want to look at your arm.  It is causing you discomfort.”
Inspector Gregson, as it turned out, was on the other side of London on a case investigation and not due back until the morrow.  Lestrade, however, was pleased to see us both.  He ushered us inside his tiny office where we made small talk for ten minutes, and drank tea – strong brewed, delicious – for five more.  At length he came to question the genuine reason for our visit.
“I don't know, Holmes,” I said.
I heard him snort.
“If you rub at your arm just once more,” I said warningly, “then I
He shrugged.
I changed the subject.  “Tell me about this case,” I said.  “What do you know?”
By the evening, and after dinner, we had gravitated to the sofa side by side to sip our brandy.  The room chill again, the fire had been lit, the orange glow extending out to touch our faces with its comfort.
My working day on Tuesday was divided.  In the morning, I was at the Yard, attending to my duties, clearing up some paperwork, and making ready for my leaving.  It was bittersweet, this time, between the staying and the going.  I had not worked here for very long, but I would miss it all the same.  Tobias Gregson stood himself inside my doorway as the morning ticked to noon.
“The back entrance of Figgis and Barrow,” said Holmes.  “Now, that is suggestive.”
“I've no problem with impossible.”
“Monday!” Holmes exclaimed, as we searched the main road for a hansom.  “That is a nuisance.  Oh well.  It cannot be helped.”
My friend looked sad.  He shuffled sideways to the sofa and sat down.  He set his elbows on his knees and cupped his chin.  He observed me solemnly.
“If you would like.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lady's mouth was in a tremor; her chin in pucker as if she might once more return to her lament.
He was gone within minutes, wrapped up like a mummy in a thick scarf and gloves, leaving me crestfallen to twiddle my thumbs out until his return.  I could not concentrate on books, needless to say, so very puzzled was my head with all this mystery.  I pottered down to Mrs. Hudson, found out that fish and baked potatoes was on the menu for that evening, and returned with half a treacle tart to tide our stomachs over.
“Do not rush yourself on my account,” I said.  “Read it next Christmas morning if you would prefer.”
“I want it,” he hissed.  “I want it so much.”
“Tea,” I said, pointing.
We passed a quiet evening and enjoyed a sound night's sleep.  Or – at least – we slept.  For I had dreamed, and tossed and turned, as the strange forms filled my sub-conscious.  My nightmare compelled the former PC Spencer through the foggy London streets.
“That is evasive.”
“Watson, it is me.”  A pause.  “What are you doing?”
I accepted the book reluctantly.  “I do wish you had
“You are my Boswell,” said Sherlock Holmes.  “My illuminating light.”
“Dickie will be with ye in a minute,” said he, slurring gently.  “He is fetching up another barrel.”
“Ramsey takes the letters, hoping to torment his victim, whereupon they whip their pistol from their pocket and fire a bullet at his head, killing him outright.  And he tumbles back, like
.  And what else?”
, because I could not stand this dreadful, wretched stasis.
“Please let me kiss you,” I said quietly.
“Holmes,” I said.
It was drizzling now; a mist was hanging low, the cold was biting.  The cart stopped outside the house, and we stepped down.  Holmes tipped the driver and we said farewell, then we watched as he drove off, the cart-wheels kicking up the dirt.  Around the hedge he went, then slowly disappeared from view.
“Thank you.”
I watched him walk across the room.  The act of doing so made him giggle inexplicably.  He stooped to retrieve his Index volume, and replaced it on the bookshelf.  He turned to me.  “I do not think that I can tell you.”
But now – the day – ahead of us.  And groaning, we roll out and off and up, clean up the havoc, and proceed towards the stairs.
I explained.  Halfway through my explanation, Holmes stubbed his cigarette and heaved himself to vertical; he smoothed out the slight creasing in his waistcoat, and cast a look out of the window.  “You barely know him,” he remarked.
“Writes letters?”
“I had nothing better to do,” I puffed.  “And you might require my assistance.”
“John,” said Holmes, later.  “All this sentiment is driving me stark-raving mad.”
My friend shrugged.  “I don't remember.”  He examined it more closely.  “Hmm.  A good year for single malt.”
He thrust his hand towards me.  “Let's not end things as badly as the other night, eh, John.”
“There are traces of tobacco on the underside of the stamp.  The hand is masculine, yet weak – you will notice the light pressure, and the jitter of the stroke.  The envelope quality is high-end; it is embossed.  Ergo, your thoughts?”
The morrow, when it came, found me at the breakfast table.  I had eaten all the bacon and three-quarters of the eggs when Holmes appeared.  He sat down somewhat cautiously, nodding in my direction as he did so.
“Quite done.”
“They might do very well for a while, but they would be certain to mess it all up,” I said, smiling, resigned.  “Eventually, they might begin to write implausible scripts and leave great, gaping plot holes.  And the characters – that is
We listened to his boots as they clattered down the stairs and along the hall into the street.  The front door banged.
“Good gracious, Dr. Watson,” said she, now drawing back before me.
Two minutes, more, ticked by, and then, the door swung halfway open.  Holmes emerged.  His expression was undefinable.  A trifle horror-struck, perhaps, with a soupçon of fevered delight.
“Thank you.”
“You can go up,” said Mrs. Hudson, “but I don't know how he'll be.  I've never seen him in this state.”
, Oaks,” said Holmes.
“Well, I only have two legs,” said he, confused.
(I discounted this, although not without a skimming of the chapter.  It was, of course, the usual dour dissection; well-meaning but misguided, as expected) ...
go home,” I whispered hoarsely.  “Come to bed with me.”
“Well, I'm glad that cleared things up,” I replied.  I placed my card upon the mantelpiece, between the jackknife and a candlestick.  I made a wider space beside it.  “For other cards, as they arrive,” I explained to Holmes, whose frown was darkening.  “Oh, Holmes.  You like Christmas.  Remember?”
“Watson,” said he, tentative.  “Watson, Watson, Watson.”
I was quite frozen by the time that I returned to up on high.  I thought I might trot into Fulworth, to pay a visit to the market for a local treat or two.  The walk was bracing, and by the time that I had reached the little village, a pale white sun was poking through the clouds; the faintest stripe of warmth landing across my upturned face.
“I am so glad,” I said.
It was Toby.  I could not hide my disappointment, and to my great unease, he noticed.  We spent a minute with a to-and-fro of discontent that ended with his plumping on my sofa, folded arms and peevish brows.
And we shook hands again, and looked the other over as before.  He was smartly dressed in pinstripe, clean and prim, his raven hair slicked back, a smile – the slightest one – upon his face.
“This waiting makes me nervous,” I confided by change of topic.
He sighed.  “Oh, very well.  We'll divvy up.  It's now one statement to a turn.”
And Holmes and I stood, dumbstruck.
,” Holmes said sharply.  “Now, just come over here and look at this poor fool laid on the rug.”
Holmes had had much the same idea.  We smelled of soap and lotion both, the pair of us.  We dressed for dinner quietly.  He hovered by my side and sniffed behind my ear.  “I like the way you smell,” he murmured softly.
Mycroft Holmes was in his office.  We had chanced upon the lunchtime scrum, and Mycroft seemed about to join it, or rather would have, had we not barged into his quarters at that moment.
“Perhaps not, then,” I quickly amended.  I improvised wildly: “Mr. Hoggerty is simply more aerodynamic?”
I drank.  “I don't think this is fair,” I said, complaining.  “You're too good at all this sort of thing.  I'll never get a statement in.”
“You will have to share with me,” said Holmes.  “My bed is large enough.”
“I am too
And we both shuddered at the notion.
“No, John, wait,” said Holmes.  He set down what he was reading.  “If you knew anything of Spanish, then you would know that
“I upset you,” he said, sounding puzzled.  “Watson, did I?”
The housekeeper obliged.  My friend glanced only briefly before making a few scribbles of his own beneath the lines.

“I have no idea what you could mean,” I said.  “I am waiting for Holmes.”
“Of course you do,” I said, rolling my eyes.  “How foolish of me.”
side, certainly.”
Holmes tapped at the newspaper before him.  “This report has little detail.  It is all frantic hyperbole.  But Talmadge was stabbed to death.  The housekeeper found him, and according to the
I sighed.  “It was Talmadge's address book,” I confessed.  “I was just, er, taking a look at it.”
He pointed to the sideboard, at the lace doily laid upon it.  “THAT,” he shrieked.  He pointed to his fingers.  “THESE.”
I tutted.  “Well, if you can't remember, then how on god's earth do you expect me to?”
“Oh, of
Holmes looked at me, brows drawn.
“The lady certainly appears to be suffering from a nervous disorder, but that is not the crux.”
Eleanor Bruce lurched forward in her chair.  She clapped her hands upon her knees.
He held me at the hip, he pulled me all the closer to him.
“It was before we spoke to Dawkins.  I suppose, as you say, it could have been a pure coincidence.  If so, the fellow will be quite out of luck.  Let us drop in at Scotland Yard and see if any progress has been made from that direction.”
it's very cold.”  I returned to the fire and a glass of fine brandy, and smoked a cigar while my friend sat in thought.  “Do you miss Baker Street?”
“It is a piñata,” said my friend.  “It is home-made!  Isn't it lovely?”
“I saw the strangest little man,” I said, “whilst sitting at the green.”  Holmes's neck was bare and prominent.  I pinched it with my teeth.  He groaned.  “He appeared out of thin air, then the next minute, he was gone again.”  I cupped the mound of Holmes's trouser front.  “He did look very odd.”  Unbuttoning, I thrust my hand inside to find my prize.  I looked into my friend's grey eyes, a-flicker and aflame.  In a teasing tone:  “What is the matter?”
“I find that whisky frees my tongue,” said he.  “Do you object?”
“Oh yes, while we were having breakfast,” I replied.  “You're keeping busy, then.”
“My dear Watson,” said Sherlock Holmes, “a Happy Valentine's Day to you.”
“They are both dead,” I said, matter-of-fact.  “Pneumonia,” I added.
I believe he had been dozing after all.  The only man that I know who is capable of simultaneously smoking and sleeping.  He awoke with a start.  His slippers scuffed at the rug in an attempt to gain purchase.  His head jerked around.
I think I saw too well.  “Er, yes, er, what?”
“But I assure you, they are not.  I've never owned tan gloves.  I fear you are mista--”
I had found a clear and pleasant spot to rest: an oval, sun-warmed patch beneath a tree, beside a stream.  I set down my knapsack and loosened its buckle, pulled back the flap and removed what was within: a small tablecloth (white), tin cups and plates (raucous), a corked earthenware bottle, and wax-paper wrapped bundles.   The former and the latter I unfolded and laid out.  I fussed around the edges of the cloth; I weighted it with a stone at every corner.  Holmes, meanwhile, was eyeing me severely.
As you might well appreciate, I had barely breath to speak or even gasp.  I moaned and thrashed and all but kneed him in the face.  “You might have asked me rather sooner,” I said, a-croak.  “I'm almost
The next Thursday morning, early, Holmes hailed me on the landing.
Holmes jerked away from the bed.  He stood up.
“Tomorrow you shall speak with Mrs. Barker,” I reassured him.
“A dry spell on all counts: me, you,
“Oh god,” I said.  “Oh god, what have I done?”
“It is quite possible.  Dr. Watson, I have
“I'm sure you will,” I replied dolefully.
“Victor,” said Holmes, “if you wouldn't object, I rather think we would prefer the small Blue.”
“It's all to do with Bridgeman,” said my friend, “you may remember him.  The lawyer.”
Pinpoints of red in both our cheeks, I thought and felt.
He stood and waited while I tossed my coat, said thank-you to the landlady, and then shut the door and locked it, before turning round to face him.
His cheeks grew pinker.  “Should we stop this game?” he said.
“Mr. Holmes,” said he, “I have a strange conundrum that I hope you might assist with.”
I looked at Holmes.  He glared.
“You're welcome,” said my friend.
“You have a gift for improvisation,” I said, when Holmes set down his bow.
.  Please?”
One hour later, I had set my spoon upon the dish and wiped the ice-cream from my lips.  For the first time in ten minutes I had looked up to see my friend, who was regarding me most solemnly.
“Of course,” said he.  “I've more to do than scratch around Lestrade.”
“The tails and stems are looped... er, the ink is a light blue... There are no misspellings...”
.  Tchaw!”
“Then you must tell him,” I said.  “Do not hide how you feel.  And it is absolutely possible to be discreet, as Holmes and myself are.”
My friend considered.  “A bottle of ink, and a half-sheet of stamps.  And a bag of those biscuits we like.  You know, the ones with the fig.  Don't forget.”
“Thank you,” I said, and I found myself shocked that I had managed to retain all my powers of speech.
He exhaled noisily.
“Yes please.  If you can bear to tear yourself away from stalking baby bees.”
I told him I would, and I sat in my chair by the fire as he hauled down his volumes of A through to E, and of F through to J.  Holmes catalogued trifles and snippets of news that he thought might prove useful in time.  Cuttings from papers and journals, and handwritten notes, on the widest of subjects: criminals, crimes, the titled people of London, the histories of many, and much more besides.  Now Holmes sat on the rug with his scissors and glue, and he snipped and he stuck to his deepest content.  And I, with time to breathe after the tumult of the morning, watched him work, and allowed my thoughts to stray to places where perhaps they'd better not.
“That's why you'd better go,” said he.  “And it's also why we'll see each other soon.”
My step was light, my heart the more so, as I made my way to work.  Lestrade was thoughtful when I told him of my prospects, as we sat talking in his office.  “It would be a shame to lose you,” he said, rubbing at his chin.  “Good police surgeons, well, you know, they're hard to come by.  Still, it's what you want that's more important.  You've made your mind up, eh?”
,” he said.  “You're making me feel... out of line.”
,” I replied.  “You are out of your mind.”
“Good heavens, man.  You mean to say that you don't know?  The news is all around the village now.  Mrs. Oaks died of pneumonia just yesterday!”
We arrived back in the sweltering furnace – that is, to say, London – shortly after midday.  Having tolerated precious little sleep the night before, I was yawning loudly by the time we turned the key at Baker Street.  Holmes flung himself immediately upon the sofa.  He stretched out prone and lolled his head against the cushions.
I pulled him close, inhaled the air of him.  “Remove that coat,” I whispered, and he did so, barely caring where it landed on the floor.  He shucked his jacket, too, as I did mine, and then, standing in shirt-sleeves, we embraced once more, the closer and the happier for that.
He clutched his hair.  “My god, we'd best go out.  Let's take a walk.  There are some things I need to buy.
“How many gardeners,” I wondered, “does it take to keep this place in check?”
I blinked slowly and considered.  “I don't think so,” I replied.  “We had quite enough to do.  If there was no cause to refer to them while still at Baker Street, then I suppose I felt no need once we were here.  Why do you ask?”
Victor was in the small sitting-room when we descended some few minutes later.  A gasogene and several decanters had been placed upon the table.  Daydreaming by the gewgaw mantel, he started alert upon our entrance and motioned us to sit.
The small percentage of restraint that I had left to me, resisted such an impulse.  It was midnight.  I should travel home, see to my pup, and go to bed alone; attempt to sleep (that felt unlikely), or what else?  To think of Holmes within the doorway of his bedroom, cast in shadow, speaking those words that crackled fiercely down my spine:
pocket watches?  And ladies' jewellery?  I would wager that he had acquired them by some other means than inheritance or honesty.  Call me a cynic, John, but really.”
as if our lives depended solely on that fact, and if we separated even for a
My eyebrows shot into my head.  “Well, yes, I think I might, that's true enough.  I do enjoy being creative, and--”
Chuckling, I left him to his rattling of the wardrobe, and so retired to my own room to wash and dress.
He shook his head.
We laugh, both, loud and joyously.  This momentous, magnificent, glorious day.
stop,” said he.  “We need to talk.”
“I have no friends,” said Holmes.  He reconsidered.  “Well, I have you.  But I mean,
He sipped.  “It's true.  I do.”  He sounded sad.
“Oh, this deduction game is trickery,” I said.  “All smoke and mirrors, yet!”
“Oh, you've been talking to Lestrade,” said he.  “I didn't tell you of my brother's name.”
“You will not believe the day I've had,” I said.  “Stamford, I tell you, it's enough to drive a fellow mad.”
“And you'll be getting that tonight,” I told him.  “I am going to pack our bags now.”
“In a dry spell currently, I'm much afraid,” I said.  I shielded my eyes as we emerged onto the gravel path.  “Goodness, it is hot today.  I feel quite overdressed.”
“Yes.  He was not so especially interested.  His concentration is fixed on the murder.  He has taken an interest in Talmadge's address book, and is at present harassing the poor fellow with the two broken legs.  He will not listen to me.”
Later, we would visit Scotland Yard and bid adieu to our good friends, Lestrade and Gregson.  I could predict what would take place: the verbal jousting, and the shoulder slaps;
My friend wrinkled his nose at the latter.  His eyes strayed to the sideboard, all the same.  For a letter might bring casework, a random intrigue or some small interest.
“Yes.  Two.  One was by the gate, and the other was by the window where Aunt Augusta met her guest.  John, you must pay attention.
“I'm not sure,” I said, rubbing my chin.  “I expect that Mrs. Turner would cook our dinners.”
I gulped for air, and I had never known a torture to be so fine or more exquisite, as we stood there on the rug, entwined and merging into one.
“Dinner tomorrow.  I might have an appetite by then.  Seven o'clock?  Meet me here, and we'll go on.”
I had loosened my bow tie, removed my boots and jacket both, and was now lying on my bed across its width, as Holmes sat on the edge of his.
“Again?”
I was beginning to wish most heartily that my friend would stop his “Watson”-ing me with requests to explain and elaborate.  I seldom had any idea of what I was talking about.
“I like it.”
“So many people,” he muttered darkly, tugging his cravat in agitation.
“Why is that, if you do not object to my asking?”
We listened to the rapid steps of Mrs. Hudson, trotting to the door.  We heard a quiet conversation, then the tread of heavy boots upon the stair.
He slammed a hand against the wall.  “Because I'm
“Mycroft will take care of things,” said he.
“I'm not going to ask you in,” said he.
“I suppose that I could drop by Scotland Yard,” said he.  “Lestrade
“How have you
share you.”
“They say that one should never mix the grape with the grain,” he said – unsympathetically, I thought.
”  His tone was strident, aggravated.  “Watson, you're madder than a hare.  I am doing no such thing.”  He wagged a finger in my face.  “That is what happens when you
“Yes.  When you first burst into the office, there were clues that I picked up.  The fact that Gregson called you 'John'; and then your crumpled shirt, evidently tossed then worn a second time.  And,” said Holmes, a small smile upon his face, “I could detect the scent of Rylott's cinnamon soap upon the pair of you.”
“Good heavens, why does Mycroft need to know?”
And then, when she had left, my friend and I looked at each other, mortified.
“Why, I, um, not at all, no.
.  I said that I was sorry.  Please come here.  I... need you.”
“I am very sorry sir,” said Mr. Dawkins, “but I have nothing for sale.  No, not for sale.”
Upon our arrival home, we were immediately struck by the oppressive air.  One might have fried a perfect egg upon any of the surfaces.  Holmes marched to the windows, which had been pulled and locked during our absence.
“Not at all,” said Holmes.  “I am much obliged for your concern.  I assure you that I will bear everything in mind; you need not doubt it.”  This, with a courteous bow towards our visitor.
“I am coming to that,” my friend said.  “Please be patient.  I am a fairly good judge of character, as no doubt you are aware, after all these years of your accompanying me on my cases.  Question Dawkins as I might, I could find no chink within his armour.  He is nebulous, but well-meaning on the whole.  But, Watson, perhaps you might guess the name of one of the students in his class?”
, and if he should catch sight, well, then,
But whatever play it was that Gregson had two tickets to, I was never likely to find out, for at that moment Sherlock Holmes once more exploded into the hall from Lestrade's office.
“I am quite aware of that,” said my friend.
I may have been mistaken, but a knowing smile relayed across that lady's face.  “I'll show you up,” said she, and did so without more ado.
Holmes did not answer me directly, for we were joined then by the others, and lunch commenced.
My friend threw himself on the hard-backed chair opposite.
“Well, yes, that's as it should be,” replied the older man.  “She loved you, yes, she did, and I see your gentle spirit for myself, with you having only spoken a few words.”
He glanced at me, then down.  “Did I do something to your lap?”
“I had noticed.”
“I'm afraid it's eight o'clock,” I said.  “And we have to wash and dress, and pack.”
“John, you were snoring,” said he.  “It is tedious attempting to read when someone is snoring.”
“Oh, Jane, what nonsense, do be quiet.  Now, Dr. Watson...”
“If there were any possibility of that, his tarot reader would have told him.  Ha!  Well, that's enough.  Don't look so mournful, John.  Oh, for goodness sake, don't tell me that the subject interests you?”
We had been walking for ten minutes before Holmes glanced back behind us.  He began to chuckle.  I turned, to see our furry friend had followed us, was standing still and waiting, both ears cocked, tail wagging.
Cursing myself, I crawled into my dressing-gown and slippers, and descended in the dark.  Silently, I crept into the room, blinked past the shadows and retrieved what I was looking for.
“How on earth?” I said.
“For god's sake, Toby.”  We wrestled briefly, laughing, 'til I bested him by straddling his waist and pinning both his hands above his head.  “You pest,” I said.
Holmes snorted softly.  He placed the packet to one side.  “You will miss the convenience, that's all,” said he.
Mr. Dawkins was much surprised to have us greet him once again.  His stool creaked as if it might collapse and take him with it to the floorboards.  He set down the yellow-back he had been reading, and called out across the glass-topped aisles a “Good morning!” once again.
His cheeks light-flushed from the fine wine and the stroll home, and now the fireside, with his collar pulled awry, and his legs crossed just quite so... I could have eaten him and still had room beside.
“My friend and I are collectors of rare crystals and semi-precious stones,” said Holmes.  “I have a special fondness for red jasper in particular, and was hoping you might have something of that nature in your stock.”
Holmes raised an eyebrow, huffed a chuckle.  “Do I now.”
“Holmes,” I said, “this room's a mess.”
We stared each other down.
“She is carryin' on behind my back,” the young man blurted out at last.  “And I can't be having that at all.  No, not at all.”
Gregson made a foul pretence of a deep curtsey.  He was hurting, I could tell, which did distress me.  How could such a plain affair end up in such a complex mess?  “I'll leave the both of you alone,” said he.  His tone was flat and tired.  “It's too damn ludicrous for words.”  He slammed the door.
, I just
“Watson!” came the strangled, strident cry.  “Oh, Watson, drat it all.”
- END -
“The front door,” he said, impatient now.  “I could swear I heard the bell ring.”
(as I called it).  We would stroll into the village, and en route or otherwise I felt quite certain we would see that little misfit.  Whereupon, I thought, the one of us would tackle him to candour.
“Your ideas of fun are questionable, Pike,” I said, my temper boiling.  “What's your true motive behind this?”
“I think it is more than that,” said my friend.  He took out his wallet.  “Come, Watson, if you are quite finished, my dear fellow.  I am afraid we must revisit friend Dawkins.”
, to be with us in the now.
“I'll mess more than that,” I said.
“Only a little,” I replied.  “Or of jasper in particular, do you mean?  I have read – and I cannot recall exactly where – that it is a great healing stone.  It is said that meditation with a jasper can provide insight into a problem.”
“Can't recall.  It's something strange, at any rate.  He might not come.  He has these
“Yes.  Our 'honeymoon'.”  (A happy memory: a holiday, a visit to an apiary, and Holmes's quiet absorption with it all; the seed was planted then.)  “I'm responsible for this?”
“Pish,” said he, “it should not take me a minute.”
We burst out laughing then at our absurdity.
I felt a hand on my shoulder, and jumped.  “John, you are a cross little bear.  You must stop it.”
“Come in,” I said.  “Come in.”
“It is possible, Victor, but who can tell?  The motives of women are so inscrutable.  How can you build on such a quicksand?”  Upon noticing Victor's crestfallen expression, he quickly added:  “I meant to say, that may apply to some women.  Your aunt, on the other hand, my dear fellow, was an admirable lady.  But at any rate, here is where we stand right now.  According to my data, we have one 'E. Bruce' within a three mile radius.  As this most recent letter was hand-delivered, I think it may be relatively safe to assume we have our man... or woman.  A brief telegram as if written from your aunt can do no harm in bringing the elusive E. Bruce to us, unsuspecting.  I have a description of the gentleman, and if by chance it is the lady, well then, Victor, you have seen her for yourself before.”
“Wouldn't you rather--” I began.
We accessed the rear gardens and were admiring the fine structure of some tall, sweet-smelling mass (and here I cannot be precise, for flowers never were my forte), when Holmes hove into view.
“Then why, in the name of heaven, did you say... oh, never mind.”  I wiped my hand across my forehead.  “Why did you ruin the door lock with acid?”
“That you are injecting a narcotic.  That you are an addict, Holmes.”
“My shift can hang itself,” said he, now rubbing both his eyes to glare at me.  He aimed and bit my shoulder.
“I owned a penny whistle once,” I said.  “Which is perhaps not the same thing.”
He accepted the bag.  Delving inside it, he pulled out a box.  Flipping open the lid, he studied the content.  There was an interminable pause, the full duration of which I roundly cursed my impetuosity.  I averted my eyes, embarrassed.
Much later, we were once again at rest within our room.  I had a sun burn on my nose.  I dabbed some lotion on the spot while Holmes made fun of me.
“What?” I said, again.  My brain had both contracted and expanded, performed a tilter-whirl and cartwheel, all inside of several seconds.  “What?”
“I must be mad,” I said aloud.  “I must be stark, staring insane.”
is how you're going to be.”
“Whatever can he want?” my friend mused.  “Shoo, Rusty!  Go home.”
“I ate just yesterday,” said Holmes.  “But we can share a hansom home, if you would like.”
He corralled me, much as a sheepdog might, towards the stairs and out.  We paused politely to shake hands, and then I faced the street alone, the wretched bustle of the day.  The abruptness of our parting hurt me keenly, yet I knew I was to blame for this small fracture.  All that blasted intimation – when Holmes was very plainly immune to whatever 'charms' I had.  Was he an invert, yet, at all?  I couldn't even tell you that.  Perhaps he kept a string of women at a rakish, equal distance, and my slight tug upon the slack had horrified him.
“Watson, whatever are you doing?”
“Good lord,” said he.
“To have you sleeping on the floorboards would be inhumane,” said he, “and there's no other place to go.”  He looked unsure, despite his bravado.
two sat over there close by the wall: the bearded fellow, with his younger fair companion.
“No, I did not,” I said, impressed.  “I must remember to congratulate him.”
-------------------------------------------------
“What did you think about?”
“Oh dear,” I said.  Not a dowager at all, then.  I hesitated.  “But your husband will be following?”
“You would prefer to be a writer.”
The seagulls spinning circles, landing soft upon the shingle.  The cresting waves striking the shore, the smell, the sound, the bracing atmosphere.  I wished that Holmes might have been with me to enjoy this special moment.  I dug my hands into my pockets, burrowed down into my scarf, and watched the grey sea dance its waltz and listened to it sing its song.
We heard a rap at the front door, and I sprang up.  I was somewhat disconcerted to observe a large and bulbous nose pressed hard against the pane of glass.  Two bright beads for eyes peered through.
artifact.  We have been promised an audience, and are now about to go through.”
Almost.
He burst out into laughter then.  I followed suit, bewildered, but delighted all the same.  This was a side to him I'd not been often privileged to see.  “What are the rules?”
When no answer was immediately forthcoming, I looked across from my paper.  Holmes was still frowning, his eyes fixed to the vague middle distance above my right shoulder.
“No.”
I reached for the letter that I might see for myself, but Holmes shook his head.
“Good morning,” then, at last.
The old woman stroked his hair and leaned against him and was whispering: “Chico, my lad, my cheery boy, oh Chico, don't take on so...”
“Aha!  I see.”
“No, there is nothing,” he replied.  “Only the phial.  Hmm.  I wonder what the 'E' stands for.”
“What for?  You'll be following half the village at this rate.  People are curious.”
Holmes was all of thirty-one years old, back then.  Somewhat over six feet in height and unnaturally lean, he paid little heed to the encouragement from myself and Mrs. Hudson that he should eat more than a few mouthfuls of any meal.  His diet was of the sparest, and if only I could say likewise of his other, less favourable habits.  The tobacco I could tolerate – for I was little better – but my friend inclined towards the use of some random foul narcotic when he found himself with time to spare and a black mood closing in.  I gazed at him now for any sign that he might again be so indulging – for his casework these past weeks had been a measure less than fruitful.

in here now.”
“Really, neither,” he replied, “unless you want to lose your mind.  Or do you
He is on his back, his legs are resting on my shoulders.  He wants me to breach him.  He is wanton.
There was a knock upon the door, and then around the edge of it appeared my coy receptionist.
, Holmes,” I said.  “You
“When did you have the thing and the whatnot?” I enquired.  “And what exactly might they be?”
“But nothing else?”
The elder brother laughed aloud.  “Oh, well done, Sherlock,” he said, doffing an imaginary hat.  “I wondered if you'd work it out.”
I shook my head and made a mime of taking notes.  He might have countered, had the call not then rung out for us to hurry to our seats, as the concert was now imminent.  The stalls were crowded, but we found our places close to the main aisle, and listened to the parps and shrills of the large orchestra, its members tuning up and testing notes.  And the conductor tapped his baton on the stand, called to attention, and the first piece came to life.
We peered up through the gloom.
“Until the morning, then,” said Holmes.
“But – however could you know that?
“I know,” I said.  “I know.”
“Why yes, of course.  It was tucked inside his waistcoat pocket.  There was nothing else of interest on the body.”
“Holmes, I swear to you, I speak the truth.  I'll admit that Stamford is a friend, and, well, I knew of your acquaintance, and he mentioned... that... but, for heaven's sake, I have no part in it.”
.  And I am afraid that that is what these documents pertain to.”
I awoke on Tuesday morning feeling wretched.  Or rather – for a few brief blissful seconds – I was yawning and incognisant; and
“It has stopped raining now, at least,” said Holmes.  He motioned to the window.
“Pretty obnoxious!”
She looked sadly down into her lap.
“So it happened just yesterday evening,” Mr. Sloan continued quickly, “that I paid one of my occasional visits to an old friend of mine.  You won't have heard of her, I doubt, for she is the Gypsy May Baron who works near Charing Cross.”
“I learned a little more without that idiot Lestrade,” said he.  “Why, Watson, whatever are you smirking at?”
of me that way.”
and all.  Let's try to keep him guessing, though.”  Holmes paused.  “So this is how it feels to be in love – I always wondered.  But John, I warned you: I'm impossible.”
I felt protective of a sudden, for this odd man with his fierce brother; all the complexities of family that I no longer had.  A pang of tenderness reached out from me and wove its way in tendrils to my friend, who sat there watching me, his cup raised to his lips, a second sandwich on his knee.
Holmes had now affixed me with his gimlet eye.  I dimly recalled his gelid intolerance for poetry.
“PC Joseph Spencer,” said Sherlock Holmes.  “I understand he is no longer with the force.”
His hands were agitated, and I watched them as they fluttered at his side, both delicate and mottled, strangely.  “Acids,” he said sharply, noting the angle of my eye.  “I dabble a good deal in chemistry, and my hands come off the worse for it.”  He tucked them in his pockets with a mote of shy self-consciousness.  He peeked at me.  “I do hate being stared at.”
I blinked.
snooping,” I said heatedly.  “I came to say goodbye, and to update you as to--”
We stayed, and talked awhile of other things: our busy London lives; the summer concert schedule.  We made plans to meet up later in July, to attend the programme at St. James's Hall.  I felt a thrill that Holmes and I were talking as a couple now – the royal 'We'!  I challenged him to Billiards, then.  He groaned, but acquiesced, and we stepped out into the hall.
, John.”  He put an arm around my waist.  “I've waited years for this.”
My friend let out a strangled gasp; he leaned his elbows on his knees, and thrust his head into his hands.  “And I need to feel it,” he admitted, through his fingers, from his heart.  “Because I love you.”
“I heard you the first time, John.”
“I don't,” I said.  “I never did.”
“Good old Watson,” said my friend.  “You are a loyal chum.  I'm grateful that you're here.”
And so he took his Stradivarius, and propped it underneath his chin, put rosin to his bow, and played.  The song was sweet and wistful; I had not heard it played before.  Without a pause he turned to Mendelssohn, his “Lieder”, that swooping, lilting tune I so adored.  I closed my eyes in perfect happiness, and listened to the notes sing in the air that lay between us, and I could not think of any place where I would rather be.
Adams beamed and clapped my shoulder.  “He's a delight, Watson, I tell you.  I've never met a man like him.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  He's everything a chap should be, you know?”
“I do not like Pike,” I said then, my thoughts in a jitter and northbound from Surrey.  “I do not care for any man who would take pleasure in others' trouble.”
ask a stupid question...”
“How long must we wait, Holmes?”
My friend groaned in impatience.  “We didn't make a back-up plan,” said he.  “We're going to starve, or freeze to death.”
He shrugged.  “However long.”
“It is all right,” I said.  “Please tell me.”
“You seem very tight with Gregson,” Holmes remarked.  His head was tilted, with his eyes half closed, his face inscrutable.  I was not quite sure how to answer him.
My friend nodded, becoming thoughtful.  Taking out a small black leatherbound from one of his pockets, he proceeded to read, turning sliver-thin pages at unimaginable speed.  I could not make out the short title, the gold emboss being so fine, but I tarried a minute in my squint.  And as brick and cobble gave way to green, I turned to gaze out through the window and amuse myself by counting cows.
The tea and cake hit the spot.  By the early afternoon I was feeling much cheerier, and helped Holmes set up his toolwork in the outbuilding to the rear.  I watched him as he measured out the slats of wood, methodical, precise.
“I was very young,” I said.  “And indiscreet.”
I feared that he might leave me then for company a little more enticing, as he glanced towards the door.  I offered him a cigarette.  He hesitated, then –
One finger, two, and then the puffed flesh quivering and tightening around me.  Pushing in, and pulling out, hearing him whine, a high-pitched strangle in my ear.
it is when I've no casework to feed it?  I do it from boredom.  The boredom is agony, John.”
We did so.  It was pleasant, warm and quiet, save for the waves and soaring gulls in raucous glory high above.
“I'm not sure myself.”  I nestled, a little.  I felt him relax.  But it felt different now, and I didn't know why.  “We just talked.”
I eased myself out of his body, and watched him hoist his underwear.  “I shall be sore,” he said, with more than some degree of satisfaction.
A small look passed between us.  I cleared my throat.  “But do go on.”
He sat back in his chair then, elbows propped and fingers steepled to his lips.  His eyes were bright as he observed me, as if now waiting for remonstrance.  He did not have so long to wait.
.  And so he thinks his spoken word is worth a hundred pounds.  Good gracious me, the greater fool he is.”
“It truly is not.”
“Maybe as not, but I thought that you might help me find who the fellow is, and sort him out, like.”
“Don't I know it!”
“I had dreams,” he said, and something in his tone made me look up at him.
He glared.  “That's really not the point,” he said.  “The point is, there's no coffee.  And I'd rather like some toast.”
“John,” said he, “you're clanking terribly.”
“Oh!  I didn't do it!  I can't remember!  Why should I send it to him?  Eugene knew of the skull, of course he did, for I mentioned the horrible thing the last time that we met – which was purely by chance in the butcher's, because we don't make a habit of meeting.  I was after a pound of sausages.  I have no idea what he was there for.  A whole pig's head, knowing him.  But, I don't know.  Does he have it?  Is that what he said?  Mr. Holmes!  Are you accusing me of stealing?”
Words, spinning in circles, incomprehensible.
“I had better take on a little watering here myself,” he said, “else it won't look beautiful for long.  Or perhaps Jane might agree to do it, if I ask her very nicely.”
“We shall see Pike tomorrow,” said Holmes.  “But tonight, let us not dwell on the negative.  We shall dine at Marcini's and drink more than we ought.  And you will
“That suit is my favourite,” I said.  “It becomes you very well.”  I withdrew my hand reluctantly.  “But shall I get up?”
I started laughing.  “Mycroft, surely.”
“No,” I said.  “No.  You could never disgust me.”
We remained that way, quite motionless, for a minute or even two, locked inside our quiet embrace.  And then I stood back to release him that he might continue with his tidy.
Trouble enough, however, when deep within his study and as an involuntary movement, his left hand moved to agitate his upper right arm, and there again the painful wince.  He froze almost immediately, but, alas, it was too late.
“My head is swimming,” he said, sweetly.  “From too much wine, and all the rest of it.  But I will tell you here and now, that I will win whatever hand you choose to play.”
“Don't talk to Gregson,” he said crossly.
The door opened, and Mrs. Hudson peeped out, smiling.  She nodded wisely.
“It was not the chain that piqued my interest,” Holmes replied.  “It was the pendant.”
“I have
“You wish to feed some to the
“We might,” I said, my heart full with the thought of that.
His breathing quickened, slightly ragged.
I rose from the sofa and stepped across to his chair.  I leaned over and placed a light kiss to his cheek.  “Well, you should get dressed, then,” I said.  “It is almost nine o'clock.  If a client calls, you'll have to hop.”
“Sherlock,
My friend outlined the details of Jack Talmadge's visit to our quarters, and the report in the morning's paper, and now the Inspector nodded, mollified to some extent.
He smiled slightly, pursed his lips and did not say.  I let him have his secrets for the moment.  I drank my tea and ate my lunch, and then whilst sitting with my pipe looked over at him once again.  He had stopped writing and was looking very pensive, lost in his dream world.  His elbow on the chair arm, with head crooked sideways and temple resting in his palm, he seemed a figure in deep thought.  At intervals, he frowned and flinched; occasionally he closed his eyes.  I was on the point of making some remark at this, when I saw his eyelids flicker and his gaze then direct upon me.
