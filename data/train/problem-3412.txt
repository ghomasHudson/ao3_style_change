different. They haven't talked about the night when Castiel smelled Dean's true scent. Logically he knows he should apologize- but they're so far from it now that it would look stupid. And yes, it
"Oh- oh god-" the human stutters, one of his hands flying up to tangle its fingers in the vessel's hair. Castiel finds it quite enjoyable when he tugs on it. Dean arches his back and presses his hips to Castiel's, grinding up against him.
Michael isn't even bothered, not really, so it takes Dean utterly by surprise when he recovers quickly and
Nevertheless, when Dean looks up, Castiel is looking his way. He blushes and picks up his cup, not caring that it's nine in the morning and now isn't the time to drink his sorrows.
Gabriel's plan is nothing short of lunacy, but it's better than Dean's other option- sitting in the stands with everyone's eyes on him, wondering why he's not down there like he's supposed to be. But jousting is a dangerous sport, and Dean may be unmasked sooner than he was prepared for.
"And you are," Dean says, straightening up. His face goes hard and closes off, anger a more steady platform to stand on than fear.
well, here we are! a little later than i'd hoped but at least it isn't a month later 0.0 have fun <3 also if you didn't like lucifer before this is not going to help your opinion lmao
we take a brief (brief. real brief) break from court intrigue in favor of baby jack truthing (i love that kid) and mentions of non-binary!raphael!!!
Castiel sweeps into the room, flashing a smile at Dean. He looks down, flushing as Victor smiles and nudges his shoulder. His veneer of a carefree young man with everything to play for has slipped back into place, and for once, it's not as steadying as Dean once thought. But he's distracted by everyone taking their seats as the King sits, and Raziel beginning a conversation at their table about the joust.
This particular dance ends with a half spin, so Castiel has to twirl Dean ever so slowly to keep in time. They end the song with Dean's back flush against Castiel's chest, each holding the other's hands. Dean's heart is pounding in his chest and he almost feels like he's floating, like the only thing keeping him on the ground is Castiel's touch. So he takes a chance, peering up at the Alpha behind him. Castiel is looking down at him, eyes widening when they make eye contact. Dean realizes very quickly that the reason he's reacting like this, with this floaty feeling and suddenly weak knees is because Dean's damned blockers are wearing off. They last twelve hours and he was up early this morning to go riding with Charlie and a few of the Novaks, so it's definitely been more than twelve hours.
Cas sighs. "Okay then. Welcome to court, Sam," he turns and addresses the other Omega. Sam's calmed down enough to smile and bow, absolutely no one else in the room is up for etiquette at the moment.
in Michael, if prior experiences have taught me anything about him. And these cross-family romances don't work, trust me, Dean. If it doesn't fly with the lords of the family- which it won't- he'll be known as the Novak who risked his reputation and everything worth keeping at court because he aimed too high. He's just lucky he's so high up, and an Alpha. Because if it were you or me doing this, Dean, we'd be destroyed if we didn't secure a place with the person we aimed for."
the sun's shining right in his eyes. Great. He guides Baby towards the royal box, where Castiel and Gabriel sit, and, looking over, he sees the crest on the armor of his opponent.
"Ah," Dean said, glancing back as discreetly as possible. Coming toward them was a man with black hair and a bit of stubble, an Omega by the looks of his clothing, and dark eyes. King Charles had taken many lovers, very obviously, and it seemed that Castiel was following in his father's footsteps in this regard, if the jewel on Inias's jacket had anything to say.
, but before he can say anything else, the doctor finally shows. Gabriel steps forward to pull Cas up, and for a moment Cas' grip on Dean tightens, but he lets his brother lead him away. And as a few men lift Dean and place him on a stretcher, Dean allows the darkness behind his eyelids to swallow him whole.
Because the only other person he'd thought something even remotely similar about is Sam, and that's completely different. Sam's his brother, his best friend. He'd give anything for him, and he has, a million times over. But if Sam held a knife to his neck, Dean would stop him. He wouldn't let Sam kill him, not unless he had to. Yet- if
It is not the bait he thought it was, as it turns out. The Alpha's name is Victor Novak. He's the son of one of the heads of the Novak family, and he's almost exclusively into other Alphas and Betas. They talk about music, mostly, and alcohol, and before Dean knows it, dinner is wrapping up. He takes that chance to look up and sees Castiel's eyes on them. He can't hide forever, it's clear, especially when Castiel claps his hands once to get the attention of them all. He decides that it's time for entertainment.
The servants (all except the one) that strap him into Adam's armor give him worried looks, because not only is he
The kid was maybe four years old, with light brown hair and bright eyes. His inquisitive expression reminded him eerily of Castiel, with the way he peered at Dean, and then Baby, with all the devoted attention that little kids can give.
, over and over. He rubs at Dean's nipples- he knows how sensitive they are. Dean lets out a quiet moan and Castiel chuckles, leaning up and swiping his tongue across one of them.
Michael speaks up, voice firm but cold. "Brother. Let him go. There are other ways to resolve your disputes."
Cas gives him what feels like an eternity before pulling back, just enough to see Dean's face. He reaches out and ever so gently brushes tears from his cheeks, and Dean shamelessly leans into his touch. He hasn't felt this secure in years. Maybe ever.
that, which had made him vain and pompous as a result. Dean could only hope that his son would not be the same. "I'm sure you have, Your Highness."
"Okay, yes, it was implied," he rolls his eyes. "But you could. You haven't been doing it, so if you wanted to make him want you
, and so far that logic has been flawed at best. It hadn't applied to Cas' stint as God, or the Leviathans, and it really didn't apply to future Cas, either. But Dean's not about to change that stance any time soon. Any Cas, even one from a universe where he hates Dean, or one where they'd never met,
He's introduced to a few other people- Balthazar, one of the King's close friends, Amara, the former King's sister, and Jo Harvelle, who was Sam and Dean's neighbor back home, before she arrived here. After a little while, Gabriel excuses himself to get some more wine (the man has a tolerance for alcohol like you wouldn't believe), and tells Sam to amuse himself. And he's been standing against a wall watching the dancing with Adam for about five minutes when he notices a bit of a commotion at the double doors.
One shuddering breath becomes two, becomes three, and they stand there for god only knows how long while Dean falls apart on the inside. Castiel's hand on his shoulder feels like a burn. There's suddenly not enough air, or maybe there's not enough room in Dean's lungs but now he can't breathe. Flashes of the alternate universe come crashing into his mind- future Cas popping pills, future Dean assembling a gun, stifling loneliness and pain and
panicked. He looks afraid. What's Cas got to be afraid of? Dean's fine, or he will be. It's not like it matters, what happens to Dean.
"Yeah," and Castiel lets Dean launch into a long-winded speech containing all his opinions on music, which veers off into a side story about Jack. And Castiel- he listens. He is a good listener. He asks questions, nods in the right places, and laughs at Dean's bad jokes, and for a moment, Dean forgets who they are and the games they play. And Castiel tells his own stories, too- tales about him and Gabriel when they were younger, hunts gone wrong, and pranks they played on stuffy advisors. Dean thinks he's never laughed this hard or this much before.
"Doesn't matter," Charlie says finally. "I wish for happiness for you, I do, but we're placing our hopes with you, Dean."
"Dean, Dean, Dean," comes a purring voice from behind him the next morning. He knows it's Lucifer before he even turns around- the Alpha's scent is enough to make his stomach roll at twenty yards. In a brief flash of sentimentality he thinks of Cas, shoving down the nausea with thoughts of his calming scent. Lucifer might be a son of the former King, but even
He's been privy to those glances and whispers all his life, ever since he had that huge growth spurt at 15 and started working out. Hey, it's not technically his fault that he looks more like an Alpha than an Omega. And Dean enjoys the attention, for the most part, likes that people are paying attention and are confused by him. So he holds his head high, higher than any Omega in this hallway, and basks in all of it. Charlie shoots him a look, hiding her smile- she knows what he's doing. He just grins at her and keeps walking.
But Dean is almost certain that Cas is just trying to make up for the joust and trying to keep him out of it, because he seems like the type to have that sort of
Dean's self-sabotaging rationale drives him to a new truth about his relationship with Castiel. Sam discovers a new royal dynamic or two.
gratifying feeling. He pulls back to look down at his human- Dean is flushed, eyes wide and pleading. A thin layer of sweat starts to bead up on Dean's forehead, neck and chest, which Castiel finds incredibly tempting. He buries his face in Dean's neck, licking a broad stripe from his collarbone to his jaw. He tastes salty, and the scent of him makes Castiel almost dizzy.
quickly. BUT! sam's gonna show up in the next chapter or so!! promise. and adam's going to get a bigger part in all this pretty soon. i mean, who knows? he might even join dean's little group of courtiers. whatever happens, our boy (and by extension, michael) is going to be a major player in this game we've got going on...
"Very well," he says. He pulls Dean forward to press the royal kiss of approval to his forehead, and for a moment, Dean meets Castiel's eyes. And he lets go, for a brief, beautiful moment at the Alpha's feet. But they have an audience, so Dean rises and backs away, lowering his gaze once more. He bows deeply to Prince Gabriel, a short Alpha with dirty-blonde hair and almost golden eyes. He waves away Dean's gesture with a crooked smile. So Dean takes his leave, dipping his head to Castiel once more.
is, I don't want my brother's reputation ruined because a Novak fooled him with all the oldest tricks in the book."
The court splits up after breakfast- those who are going riding with the King (Inias, Dean, Raziel, Victor, Michael (who's a prominent Shurley), a courtier named Benny Lafitte, who works with Crowley, and Prince Gabriel) go to the stables, and the ones who aren't stay behind and entertain themselves. Victor admires Baby as Dean brushes her and puts the saddle on. His horse is a little smaller than she is, a brown and white spotted horse that he's named Lily.
, and it hits Dean like a brick to the face that future Castiel loved future Dean, and he must have done
"What a fucking dumbass," he mumbles into his hands, knowing good and damn well that it applies to him, too. Of course that was his future. Of course that was their road. Of course Dean had to go and screw things up the way he always did, while pretending that he hadn't screwed up anything. And he should know- future Dean is
The other Omega sighs. "Your blonde Alpha friend. Whatever he's doing with Michael- he just needs to leave him alone."
The silence is palpable. For a moment the anxiety returns, and Dean wonders if he's done something wrong. But then the King's gentle fingers are under his chin, lifting his head up to meet his gaze.
“Sam,” he whispered, tugging at Sam’s sleeve. “Look.” Sam’s eyes widened just a fraction, and that was all the surprise he betrayed.
"What? Where?" he asks. Dean just hushes him and moves away, down the hallway. Sam follows reluctantly, keeping watch behind him for anyone that could give them away.
attitude. Dean would know- he's got it too. So. If Cas is just trying to make himself feel less guilty, then-
Dean snorts. "All kinds. None of that new stuff that you hear all the time now, though- it all sounds the same."
- of course Castiel would be told his teaching was great, that was the whole point of having courtiers around. Charles had practically

to be Dean's original ones, they have to be from home. It then occurs to him that Cas has been silent this whole time, watching Dean's reaction. He practically throws himself out of bed and right at Cas, who thankfully catches him.
"Ready?" Benny asked, holding out his hand. Dean accepted it and smiled at him, letting him escort him to dance.
"When you get up there, you'll have to kneel at his feet, and tell him your name," Charlie supplies helpfully. When Dean's head shoots up in surprise, she waves a hand. "Don't worry. Even the most powerful Alphas have to do it. It's a sign of respect."
Dean's finally started relaxing into his role at court. He likes the social aspect of it, playing games and betting on cards. Sometimes he'll go riding with Raziel and Victor, and a few others if they're so inclined, but he hasn't seen much of Castiel since that first night at all. Oh, they all see him during meals, of course. But other than that, the court has been left to entertain itself. And, like a horde of mice when the cat is away, it goes wild.
like a moose!" Dean says, leaning forward and ignoring the pain in his ribs. "Man, how'd I never notice that? You totally
"There are other ways," he can hear Charlie walking up behind him. "You don't have to sleep with him or even
"You, chatting up Michael. You pulled out all the stops, Vic, you can't have thought I wouldn't notice."
"I'm sure you have," Dean said, and it came out sounding more mocking than he'd intended it to. Well, maybe he'd intended to a
Inias sits at Castiel's feet, as per usual, but it looks different somehow. Not that Dean would know anything about it, having never sat at the feet of an Alpha. He'd probably look stupid doing something like that anyway, so it's probably a good thing. But Inias seems stiff, like a bad actor playing a difficult part. Meanwhile, beside Dean, Victor and Raziel are keeping up a steady stream of inane conversation. Dean can tell that their smiles are forced. Hell, his
That's not as easy as he makes it sound, though. Truthfully, Dean's got no idea how to it, and the only solution he can think of is avoiding Cas at all costs. Except he can't, because he's bedridden for another week at least, and he doesn't
He's out with Adam Milligan today, and as it turns out, he's actually persuaded the man who takes care of the garden to let him work on it sometimes, too. The man is an older Beta, and he had offered to teach them both how to plant flowers. But they were born in the countryside, and Adam's mother, Kate, kept plants in window boxes and grew more outside their home on the outskirts of the Winchester estate. So Adam, and Sam by proxy, know good and well how to grow flowers. And because neither are very high-ranking courtiers, barely courtiers at all, nobody really cares what they do or where they go. So Adam spends most days in the garden, taking care of the plants, and he brings Sam along. If this whole "becoming a great lord at court" thing doesn't work, Sam thinks, Adam could be the gardener here.
The four of them- Charlie, Dean, Sam and Bobby- let the guards open the grand double doors to the dining hall and strode in as if they owned the place instead of the king, as if they’d never left. Dean winked at a servant girl on his way to their seats, and she almost dropped her jug of wine, turning a shade of bright red. Sam greeted a few people sitting nearby as they sat down, engaging them in conversation, while Charlie allowed a young man to pull out her chair for her. Bobby sat of his own accord, in a chair near the king's, which said enough about his position at court in and of itself. Yes, the Winchesters were back, and they were already turning the place upside down.
"Do you like music, Dean?" It's a rather out-of-the-blue question, but Dean blinks and answers anyway.
It was then that Dean saw the king- the man from the hallway that had bumped into him. With the crown on his head and how he was decked out in royal robes, he suddenly looked far more regal than he had in that hallway.
"Had to show you," he says, after a long moment. His breath is starting to rattle, which can't be a good sign. He closes his eyes. Sleep sounds really good right about now.
Dean's not much of a reader, alright? That's more Sam's thing, that's down his alley 'cause he's the smart one. Dean
"It's fine," Dean said gruffly, "It's crowded around here, I've been bumped into eight times since the stairs." He jerked his thumb behind him at the staircase, only about twenty feet away.
"Second dance with the King on your first night," she says, letting herself smile. "You're doing well."
"My darling," Castiel whispers, pressing a soft kiss to Dean's lips. He knows this is the end, at least for tonight. But the time will come when he can show himself to Dean when he is awake, and that is worth waiting for.
"Dean," Castiel interrupts, reaching out to wrap his fingers around the other man's wrists. "Let me do this. Put aside your fears and trust me, know that I will take care of you." Dean stays stiff for a moment, fists clenched- but then he relaxes, mumbling something about weird dreams and
"See you around, Cas," he says tiredly, and walks away, back to Charlie and Raziel and Victor. He puts on a smile, and acts like he's been swept off his feet, not like his hopes (and his heart, not that he'll ever admit it) have been broken, thrown down like they didn't mean jack to begin with. And when Charlie asks him why the King looks like he's been left at the altar, Dean lies through his teeth and says he doesn't know. Oh, she doesn't believe it- of course she doesn't. And nobody else does, either, but thankfully, they don't press.
"Dean," he says slowly, reaching out to tentatively rest a hand on Dean's shoulder. The fact that he does it so hesitantly and so slowly, to give Dean room to brush him off and be a dick as he always is, almost sends him into hysterics.
"Dean, Dean, wait!" Sam holds out a hand to keep him from moving too much. "I don't think anybody knows, okay? It's just me, you, him, and the Prince, and I don't think they're real fixated on telling, 'cause they'd be in trouble too. Don't pull anything."
"I'd stay if I wasn't so damn tired of playing pretend," Dean explodes, whirling around and almost starting to pace. "Finding an Alpha- that was never in the cards for me, Sam, I didn't want one
The younger Omega is inspecting his rose bush at the moment. There are bugs on it, just little pests that eat away at it, and he's really focused on getting them off. Picking them off and flinging them away isn't the most fun part of gardening, but it
? Charlie had mentioned that Lucifer was Gabriel and Castiel's half brother, but Michael- no one ever really talked about Michael anyway, but surely he couldn't be Lucifer's brother by King Charles.
Dean flushes, ducking his head so Sam can't see it (he can). "I guess. Whatever." His tone is noncommittal enough that Sam knows he hasn't crossed a line suggesting this, but he knows that this is the extent Dean will talk about it tonight.
"I got some things for you," the Alpha says, and when Dean looks up, he's practically blushing. He goes back over to the chair he'd unceremoniously dumped the books on and picks them up, bringing them back to the bed. Dean reaches out to take them from him.
Dean takes a shaky breath. He'd said it five seconds ago, but now the words are choking him, hot and heavy on his tongue. "I want to."
why Castiel wouldn't want to discuss it, really. His scent has always been described as being too strong, too Alpha-like for an Omega. Honey and cinnamon and a tiny bit of pine- (sounds great in theory, but it is
"Your son is safe with the Winchesters," Castiel replies, voice tight with anger. "You could have written, Lucifer. I don't know why you chose to come to court and threaten someone's life instead."
this is making him angry again. He really can't handle the moral righteousness of fucking Alphas who just want to hold Omegas down. And for what reason? Allowing Dean to joust hurts
As they passed a room with double doors, a man blew through them and bumped into Dean on his way out. His messy dark hair caught Dean's attention first, then his bright blue eyes as he stepped back.
"And after he tells you to stand, you'll bow to his brother, Prince Gabriel," Raziel says. Then he shifts awkwardly on his feet. "Here's the... more
," Dean hisses. "Like a mother hen. I told him he looked dead on his feet and that he should go back to bed before he collapses.
"You think I don't know how this works?" Inias demands. "I've been at this court for years, Winchester. I've seen this game played, over and over again. I have played it myself. And you are even more stupid than I thought if you really have no clue as to what's going on."
"Still," Dean says, lowering his eyes and flushing like an embarrassed schoolgirl. "I'm sorry, Your Highness."
"I-," he whispers, but, unable to finish, buries his face in the crook of the angel's neck. He hasn't been touched like this in so long and every nerve in him is screaming
"That was good," she says quietly as they watch the King call for music from the band. People are starting to pair up to dance, so when a brown-haired woman approaches Charlie with her hand outstretched, she takes it, winking at Dean as she goes.
"What-" Dean says as Castiel turns around. His green eyes are wide, and Castiel takes a moment to admire them.
"You're ready when I say you are," Castiel growls. "Stay still." Dean obediently goes limp as he slides his fourth finger in.
Dean- Dean is another matter. Adam told him that, when he arrived at court, it took him three full days to figure out that Sam's brother was an Omega, and that was from whispers of the court. Dean's kind, and clearly self-aware, but he can also be brusque and impulsive, which are, by society's standards, typically Alpha traits. But he's down to earth and says what he thinks, and because of it he and Adam have become better friends. However the court sees him, though, he's caught the King's eye, and somehow manages to keep it on him. Sometimes Sam wonders if he even knows what he's doing with Castiel most of the time.
"Inias' one mistake is that, outside of bedding the King, he serves no real purpose. He doesn't know that. He's very ambitious, but if he's not sleeping with Castiel, his ambitions mean nothing. He can get nowhere outside of Castiel's bed. It's only a matter of time until he sees that. Alphas want to be your everything, and if you're playing this sort of game with one, you can't let them until you have them."
prepared. But he sits on the stool Victor's just stood from and sings a song he's learned since coming to court about loving someone from afar, ignoring how his heart skips a beat whenever he looks at Castiel.
@ inias the character from spn: sorry i did you so dirty here, i legitimately liked you in the show. love and light babe <3 however, michael, i love you and would die for you 😌😌
"Do I want to know?" He asks, and Gabriel waves him away, still laughing, finally letting go of Sam's hand.
"I got lost and ran into Adam Milligan on my way here," Sam shrugs. "When I told him I'm your brother, he gave me directions and told me something interesting- you took his place at the joust because you and- you and the
AHAHA SEVENTH CHAPTER. SORRY THIS TOOK FOREVER TO COME OUT, LIFE HAS BEEN WILD. it's a little short, but there's so much fluff- there's a PICNIC and a teensy bit of ~ spice ~  (just a little, but it is THERE ALL THE SAME) so hang on to your hats, readers!
Michael- despite Dean's misgivings and judgements, the guy arguably got the shortest end of the stick with his father. If the court was a house that burned down, Michael was the one caught in the upstairs bedroom with burning rubble blocking the stairs. And for what? He had always been the obedient courtier, and got absolutely nothing for it. He obeyed orders, no matter what they were, placed Charles on any pedestal he wanted. Yet, in the end, it was always courtiers like Dean and Sam, and his other sons, Castiel, Gabriel, and Lucifer, that had and held Charles's attention. That was leaving out Raphael, Charles's third child who mysteriously disappeared at the age of eighteen and never returned. Some said Gabriel was still in contact with them, but there was no proof of it if it was true.
"Lord Shurley," Charlie curtsys with a smile. She shoots a glance at Dean, urging him into a bow of his own. "Dean, this is Raziel Shurley, a good friend of mine. Raziel, this is Dean Winchester, another friend. We were hoping that you'd be able to coach Dean a little on his manners for dinner tonight."
"That comes when you pick," Charlie replies. "For now, you make as many connections as you can, and you make sure you're in everyone's good graces."
"Oh, fuck you," the blonde leans back in his chair, starting to exchange insults with the other Alpha.
"It's because I'm an Omega, isn't it?" he says, and suddenly the anger rushes out of him, only to be replaced with self-loathing. He had to be born a goddamn Omega, didn't he?
his job to make sure the family's reputation can be saved. Dean has doubts about the plan, but Uncle Bobby thinks it could work. And he's usually right about such things. So maybe miracles can happen.
that Castiel's returned until he strides out into the garden, where Dean's playfully arguing with Victor. Victor has to nudge him hard in the side to get him to notice.
"Um, news flash, Mikey!" The blonde Alpha waves his hands in a vague gesture, "That's literally what you and your rich friends do here all the time. 'M failing to see your point."
Dean rolls his eyes. "Again, there's no way out of this. I'm a player in this game and forfeiting isn't an option."
"Thank you," Castiel says softly, "That was wonderful." Dean can feel his cheeks getting hot as he bows to both of them. Gabriel winks at him, his expression making Dean a little nervous. Gabriel looks like he's about to slip a firecracker down Dean's shirt, but he's looked like that all through dinner, too, so maybe it's nothing to worry about.
"Besides, that Inias boy is getting on my damned nerves," he mutters, shifting papers around. "The sooner we push him out of the 'favorite' spot, the better." Dean stifles a laugh, and looks over to see that Charlie is doing it too. "Alright. Alexander will inform you of more meetings in the future," the Duke gestures at Lord Novak, who nods his assent. "Now get out of my office." Dean can almost see a tiny smile on his face. Charlie just giggles and pulls Dean out of the room.
"How could I, with the king right there?" Sam said. "And it was just introductions, made by Charlie. Nothing happened."
"I mean," he shrugs, "That if he doesn't want you now- which isn't the case, trust me- but if he doesn't, you could always
"Yeah," he says, hoping he doesn't sound too relieved. "It's a lot. But my friends are here, so I'm sure I'll get used to it in no time."
. So yeah, Sam knows Lucifer pretty well. Not personally, of course, but he's certainly closer to him than anybody in this room except Gabriel.
Dinner that night is almost disastrous. To Castiel's credit, he takes it in stride, appearing kingly the whole time. The same cannot be said for everyone else, especially Inias. As soon as Dean sees him entering the dining hall, he knows something's going on. His face is clouded with anger and contempt, and he gives Dean a venomous look as he passes him. An acknowledgement. Inias knows the game Dean's playing- he knows it better than Dean himself does, and he isn't happy that Dean's playing it. Everyone can see it, and the growing tension in the room feels like a stick of dynamite about to explode.
"Victor. You know you must tell Charlie of any changes you're thinking of making to the plan," he says urgently. "Going maverick, it doesn't work. There are ruling families at court for a reason."
was the one riding for Adam. With any luck, Dean will have his fun, Gabriel will have his, and Adam will get to participate in his very first plot in court.
to blame for not keeping Michael Shurley. It was a ridiculous move to make in the first place, but now that you've failed? At least there was never a legitimate courtship," she says. "You'd be in far more trouble if that were the case. You know how he is."
Just as Castiel goes to ask his question again, Dean stutters, "No, n-nobody." And Castiel is very smug about that- no one's ever touched Dean here, nobody's ever gotten the chance to fuck him. Castiel will be the first, and he will make it good enough that no one else will ever be able to satisfy him.
>:)) this chapter is more plot than anything, and focuses more on dean. and adam, of course! also, sam's going to have his own little plot (that's technically started in this chapter), and despite not being really involved in court business (yet), he's still important. we
Dean looks down at his hands for a moment. "So Victor can't go after someone he loves without Charlie and the Novak heads approving first."
Dean rolls his eyes. "Whatever, you don't even like Omegas. The point is, how am I supposed to go up against all that? He's got noble blood and he's from a good family, isn't he? Why would the King step down to my level?"
Michael sighs. "You know exactly what my point is. Leave Sir Winchester alone, brother dear, so we don't have to escort you out when he inevitably and justifiably assaults you for your terrible behavior."
Of course, good times never last long. In this case, the moment of happiness following the meeting is shattered by none other than Inias Shurley himself.
oh boy ;)) with dean out of the public eye for the moment, who steps in to fill that almost-power vacuum? well, who better than his brother, huh? good luck, sam, it's a crazy world out there.
"You were the greatest courtiers in the land when he was a teenager," Charlie said with a shrug. "I suppose, in a way, he still feels..." she searched for the word, "Starstruck. Many people were, you know." Her smile, when she turned it on him, was sly.
of you!" The Beta lets out a squeak as Dean sticks the flower behind his ear. Benny scrambles out of the way, saying something about
! It's so simple, but it brings him peace. Even if he won't be on a horse again any time soon (he should talk to Sam about someone taking care of Baby), the little bit of progress he's made makes him hopeful. He's so in his head, staring down at his feet, that he doesn't notice the knock on the door, or the opening of it.
The servants who have come with them on the ride spread out blankets on the grass. Dean and the other Novaks (Benny could be counted as one because he, as Dean has discovered, has a marked distaste for the Shurleys) sit on one, Michael and Inias get another, and the two royals have their own. Victor looks over at Castiel, then daringly picks a flower from the edges of the water and hands it to Dean. Dean smiles his thanks, and places the flower beside him.
Dean huffs out a laugh. "My little brother, Sam- he's got long hair. Real long, thick hair, and if he were here- he'd hate it, but I'd definitely go out of my way to put stuff in it."
He forces himself to think about it, about the night as a whole. He knows Charlie and the Novaks will see this as a win, but at what cost? It was too intimate, too... too
at cards," Dean says with faux sympathy, to which Victor laughs and aims a weak punch at Dean's arm. He dodges, grinning, and grabs Victor's money off the table.
"To Sir Winchester," he says, "Here's hoping you win." Victor, Dean, Raziel, the Omega girl, and the Beta man raise their glasses in return, clinking them together. The rest of the dinner passes in a similar fashion- the Alpha and Beta making crude jokes that Victor finds
"I should think so," he says, throwing a wink over his shoulder at Dean as he follows his King into the palace.
Right. The joust, Gabriel's plan, and Michael. He almost grins with pride- he might be absolutely wrecked, but he won, and that's the important bit. Dean takes a breath.
Dean learned very quickly after that that Castiel was not his father. It was what he had hoped for, to never have to tiptoe around a volatile, practically all-powerful monarch again, but now that he wasn't doing that he found it very hard to reconcile his memory of Charles with his son.
"Watch everything," Raziel advises. "Watch everything, and listen to everyone. You cannot afford to be out of the conversation."
was certainly pulling out the stops, though. Weren't you, Dean-o?" Dean snorts, but Raziel cuts him off, not dropping the subject.
"The court's opinion of you is just as important as the King's," she says plainly. "Maybe even more so. If you want Castiel to see you as the most charming Omega at court, more so than Inias," she gives a tiny smile, knowing how competitive he can be, "You need to show it. Everyone here needs to know it." She pauses to take a drink. "And people are always watching, Dean. Some of them are reporting back to the King. Some to the Shurleys."
When he opens his eyes again and slides out, Dean has his eyes closed, breath slow and steady, and in a few minutes he is fast asleep. Castiel looks at him- looks at the come trickling out of his red-rimmed hole, the bruises on his hip and his neck, and the sweat pooling in the dip of his collarbone. There has never been a prettier sight in all of existence.
"Oh gods no," Dean says, moving back, but he knows his smile is just as wide as Victor's. "Uh-uh, you are not putting
good, the mature younger brother who could be counted on to accept responsibility. Dean, on the other hand- Dean can be charming and smooth, as well as impulsive and angry. Sam can remember which fork to use when, and how to talk to those in power, and Dean cannot. Dean is a fighter, a soldier. But Sam is not- he is a scholar, a diplomat. But both share is that they have been cursed by their own biology. They are both Omegas.
"Sam?" Yeah, it's him, alright, Dean's tall, awkward little brother who looks very pissed at the moment.
," the human moans, breathing hard. "God, fuck me," he pleads, voice hitching when Castiel pushes in particularly hard and presses against his prostate. "Fuck me, fuck me please-" Castiel groans, unable to wait anymore. He unbuttons his pants, slipping out of them quickly, and slicking up his cock.
"'S been worse," Dean points out. It must not have been the right thing to say, though, because he shakes his head again and snaps at someone to try and stop the bleeding. But Dean's right, it
i do want to thank every person who has read this, left kudos or dropped a comment. you have all made
The steps were sly and seductive, and Dean let Benny lead though it wasn't exactly his forte to follow. Benny spun him out in time with the music, then reeled him back in, holding him close to his chest. Dean beamed up at him, leaning into his grip. At the end of the dance, they were pressed up against each other, practically breathing the other's air. And when they broke apart, Dean looked up, and saw Castiel watching them. Unable to parse out what that could possibly mean, he offered to dance with a pretty blonde woman instead.
"Michael's practically his equal in the Shurley family, though," Dean frowns. "How is that aiming too high?"
"There," Victor points toward a pond up ahead. "One of the King's favorite places, I think." Just as he says it, Castiel dismounts.
"Alright," Cas says, walking over to Dean and gently maneuvering him so he's leaning back against a couple pillows, and he realizes quickly how tired he still is. "Let's not open your stitches."
Benny and Raziel pop in occasionally, offering their opinions and laughing along with Dean. And Victor does the same, only his remarks always slide into flirtatious territory. It's a plus, though, because whenever he does it, Castiel shifts a little closer to Dean and says something to make him laugh. The blonde Alpha just winks at Dean and walks over to talk to Michael, who looks like he wants nothing to do with him. But Victor's good at what he does- despite Michael's best efforts, in a few minutes Victor is sitting beside him and brushing against the other Alpha's arm with every movement he makes.
He creates a dream, and within it, a place. It's a bedroom with a large bed in the middle, a bathroom just adjacent to it, and a large window to the right of the bed. Castiel walks over to it, in his new vessel (no need to burn the man's eyes out, even in a dream), and thinks a little about fucking Dean against it, but instead calls back the memory of Dean, forced into a leadership role at such a young age, which cools him quickly and cements his change of plans. See, some need a firm hand to keep them in line, some take better to gentle guiding, and some need both. Dean is rebellious and stubborn, but underneath, Castiel knows what he desires- to be taken care of the way he takes care of everyone else. In fact, Castiel
"So beautiful," Castiel says, squeezing the brand gently. Dean gasps, throwing his head back, and Castiel ducks his head to kiss Dean's neck and along his jawline. He sucks little bruises into his neck and collarbone and almost purrs, thinking about marking his boy where everyone can see.
Dean's on his own today, which sucks, but at least it gives him the opportunity to do something he hasn't been able to do since the joust- stand. He's getting damn tired of being in bed all the time. So he lifts the blankets gently, wincing when he has to lean forward to do it (thanks, broken rib), and slowly turns so he's sitting up, feet on the floor.
I'm alright," he says, looking at Cas and then back at his feet. "I haven't even walked, I've been here for at least five minutes. I'm
"I'm not really the party-going sort of guy," Sam says, for lack of anything better. Gabriel just shrugs and takes a long pull from his glass.
"What happened?" Cas asks, one hand cupping Dean's face and the other back on his shoulder. "What happened, Dean?"
to me otherwise," he spits, "Do you really think I can't take care of my son? I haven't seen him since he was born, Castiel. I think I'm entitled to see him."
Cas sighs, and the noise pulls Dean out of his reverie. "I'm sorry. You just woke up, I shouldn't be lecturing you."
Raziel and Dean discover that Victor may be playing a game of his own, which doesn't please Inias. Dean deals with the fallout, and adjusts to a new mindset surrounding our favorite monarch.
After dinner, there was entertainment- mostly dancing, but courtiers also opted to play cards at the tables at the back of the room, talking and laughing and drinking. Sam was asked to dance by a dark-haired woman in a red dress, and he led her out with a smile on his face. Dean stayed behind and challenged a few others they'd met to cards- Benny Lafitte, a stocky Alpha always ready with a salacious remark, and Meg Masters, a Beta who gave off the air of someone who definitely cheated at cards.
But Cas returns the gesture, wrapping one arm around Dean's waist and the other just under his shoulders. He's murmuring something, and that's when Dean blinks and realizes that he's full-on
"Ow," Adam mumbles, snapping Sam out of his thoughts. Adam shakes his hand and the bug on it flies off, crawling away.
The red-haired Alpha leans in. "We are all out here," she says quietly, "Putting our necks on the block for a chance at power and positions. He won't allow any of us to ruin the progress we've already made."
"I think we should let the newest of us perform first tonight," he says with a benevolent smile, and his gaze returns to Dean. Dean flushes hard and loses all train of thought, silently beginning to panic. Thankfully, Victor, who's been exchanging pleasantries with Charlie and Raziel for the last few minutes, leans over and hisses in his ear.
One of Castiel's hands rests on the small of Dean's back, while the other holds Dean's hand in a firm grip. Dean doesn't miss how their fingers end up laced together by the halfway point of the song. They move slowly to the music, and while the chatter and laughs of the rest of the court fill the air around them, Dean swears he can't hear any of it. He's too focused on Castiel's smile, the places where their bodies touch, and the deep blue of his eyes.
together. And they know everyone else is filing off the dance floor, but they remain pressed together, unwilling to move.
"Ah, yes," Castiel said, casting his gaze away from Dean for the first time since the start of their conversation and up to the sky. "Gabriel has talked at length about Lord Winchester. He has a frankly startling number of nicknames for him as well- Sammich, Samalam, Moose, Samsquatch-" he ticked them off on his fingers. Dean cracked up, imagining the look on Sam's face as Gabriel called him
He wants Dean so much. His vessel's cock is hard against Dean's hip and he can't help but rock his pelvis into the other man's thigh. Dean gasps, trying to do the same, but Castiel is still holding his hips down. He decides to be charitable and move one hand to gently pin Dean's wrists above his head, slotting his knee between Dean's thighs. The human makes a strangled noise, and
"Yes," the other man nods quickly. "If the King invites you to join them, it'd be in your best interest to do so."
Dean touches down on the side of the road, feeling lost and hurt and sad, like the world is crumbling around him and there's nothing he can do to stop it. Although he isn't really sure if he wants to stop it anymore.
The look Dean gives him makes him want to rethink everything. "Maybe not. But happiness and this place don't go together. It's all just ambition and greed and you're going to want to get out of it, but you won't be able to." He sighs. "You were always the smart one, Sam. Go while the going's good."
"Yes," Dean answers, "My brothers and stepfather are at home. Jack's too young for court, and Sam and Bobby want to stay with him, oversee his education."
"I mean it, Victor," she says. "He's pissed that you even took the jump in the first place, even more so that you've apparently missed."
When the tables are cleared and moved out of the way, the court splits into groups once more. The piano is brought out, and a violinist steps up to accompany the girl playing. Dean sits out the first dance with the Alpha he still hasn't gotten the name of, and Victor, and they place bets on a card game- Dean versus Victor, and because Dean has no mercy when it comes to cards, he wins.
They circle each other. Dean's breathing hard and the left side of his chest is bright with pain. That's going to be one hell of a bruise. Michael lifts his lance and charges one more time, and, on a complete impulse, Dean does the same. Michael's hit first, barely staying on his horse. But he knocks his lance and the damned thing connects with Dean's chest just as the announcer yells that Dean's the winner (
get ready, you guys, and watch out for this one if you don't like mentions of blood/bruising, okay? take care of yourselves. but this one is,,, wild, and things happen
"John, hush," Lord Novak says, rolling his eyes. "Dean, we've decided to back Lady Bradbury's plan to get you into the King's bed."
“You’d better be,” Bobby said. “The king himself is just as curious about you as the others. He wants to see the ‘great Winchester brothers’ just like they do.”
"I should introduce you formally," Dean cracks a smile and gestures to Sam and Gabriel. "This is Sammy, my little brother."
Jack was born out of a scandal at court. His father, Lucifer, was just as close to the King as Sam and Dean's father had been. He had bedded a woman King Charles had taken a fancy to, which hadn't ended well. There were whispers that that had been a cover for something else, something deeper involving him, but it had never reached Dean if it was true. Lucifer had been sent away from court, the woman gave birth to his son, Jack, and then was exiled as well. The boy drifted around for quite a bit before Charlie convinced Bobby to raise him, along with Sam and Dean. He is a Beta, one who retains a childlike sense of wonder about the world. He is calm and smart and knows a lot more about the world than he ever lets on.
"Not enough to walking all around the castle," Sam retorts. "Dean, come on. You'll only be kept in longer if you break a stitch or something."
on Castiel, and it's a heady mix of Castiel's earthy scent and Dean's, which smells vaguely like honey and lavender and his sweat. The combination should not smell as fan-fucking-tastic as it does, but
"He'll never be royalty," Benny predicts. "Too temperamental. The Shurleys would be idiots to back him, and Castiel won't marry him."
exactly he is supposed to go about making their family as great as it once was. His friend, Charlie Bradbury, had brought up the idea to Bobby months before Dean was told.
). It's hard enough that Dean goes down completely, knocked out of the saddle and hitting the ground, then the wall behind him with a
"Lord Winchester," she addressed Sam first, dipping into a graceful curtsy. "Sir Winchester." Sam bowed and Dean nodded to her, a small smile on his lips.
! He was back on the topic, had steered Dean right towards it. He gritted his teeth. Was it his fault that Castiel was somehow that easy to talk to?
"Yes," Charlie replies. "Sir Dean Winchester, this is Lord Novak and his husband, the Duke of Humboldt. They are the heads of the Novak family." Dean bows, not really knowing what to do. Two Alphas? It's rare, but not unheard of. Either way, Dean's never seen it before, and he tries very hard not to gawk.
"How is Lord Singer?" Castiel asked suddenly. At Dean's confused look, he said, "His leg is giving him trouble again, but he won't give me an honest answer about it. I thought you might be more inclined to tell me."
"I don't think I can allow you to joust," the Alpha says, voice soft. As if that would make the blow any less fucking
"You're not lecturin' me, Cas. 'S okay," Dean says. And he'd like to say more, but his tongue feels like goddamn leather in his mouth and his thoughts are slow. He squeezes Cas' hand as much as he can, though, and the Alpha's
"Yes," Adam replies, turning back to the bush. "It's relaxing." There's silence for a moment, but then the Alpha sits down on the carved stone bench beside Adam's bush and says, gesturing to it-
Castiel snorts, "They wouldn't dare," he says playfully and leads Dean and Balthazar out of the stables. "We'll still have enough time to make ourselves presentable, won't we, Balthazar?"
"Then would you do me the honor?" the Alpha offers. He's wearing that gentle smile that makes Dean's heart flutter in his chest.
fondness, which makes Dean's insides flutter. So Dean allows himself to lean on Cas, head on his shoulder, and closes his eyes.
"Sir Winchester," Castiel says, smiling. He looks tired- there are shadows under his eyes and Dean almost feels tired just
"Sir Winchester," Castiel smiled back at him, blue eyes bright. "Your brother was just telling me about how hard Aquarius is to find."
Sam gestures vaguely, trying to put his whirling thoughts into words. "How- why would he tell you? If people know but won't talk about it? If
"It's a rose bush," he says. "The actual roses haven't bloomed yet, but they should pretty soon." To say Sam is wary of the whole situation would be an understatement. An unmated Omega in a secluded place with an unmated Alpha? It's a recipe for disaster on its own.
"Lady Bradbury," replies the man from behind the desk. He stands and kisses her hand. She smiles back at him. "Is this him?" he asks.
Sam looks skeptical, but he doesn't push. "In any case, Adam feels really guilty about it. So does the Prince, I think, because I saw them outside when I came in. I promised I'd tell them when you were conscious."
"The first thing you need to know is how to approach the King. He'll be sitting at the head of the table. Make your way up, but keep your eyes down. Don't look directly at him unless you're told to," he instructs. "When you leave- and he'll tell you when- don't turn your back on him. Back up until you get back to your seat."
Dean grinned. "I believe you've just found one, Your Highness." At Castiel's questioning look, he pointed at himself and elaborated, "January 24th."
-" he spits, "And you're going to make it happen, or the kid's going to be bleeding out on your floor."
"Charlie introduced us in the ballroom, and then we made our way to the balcony," he said tactfully. He was not looking at Dean.
Yeah. Friends. Dean can do that. You can like someone else's scent and practically want to drown in it platonically, right? Of course.
but apparently, news travels fast in this place and they already know he's not supposed to be going out. Dean ignores them in favor of asking Gabriel who his opponent is.
"I am," Dean said, and grinned at Sam when he looked away, hiding his own smile. "Our own little genius. Well, not so little- what are you, seven feet tall?"
"Can't," he pants as Castiel gets faster. "I- please." The word ends in a garbled mess of curses and pleads.
"Yeah," Gabriel takes a drink from his own cup before speaking again. "How do you feel about jousting?"
Jack is too young to go to court, and Sam has decided to stay with him until he can, so they could not have chosen either of them. Charlie is infertile and prefers women, so asking her to play this game would come to nothing in the end. But she has done well in her role thus far- she has become an influential figure at court and has Castiel's ear as a trusted friend.
Dean turned to his brother, leaning in so as not to be overheard. "How is this not hard for you?" he hissed.
"Good," Gabriel says, and for once, there's no humor in his face. He's actually serious. It's unsettling.
anyway, i'm off. i'll try to update more regularly, by the way, so this "updating practically once a month" sort of thing doesn't keep happening. ily, toodles :)
"Your Majesty," they hear from behind Dean, and lo and fucking behold- it's Inias. He sweeps in with his delicate features and slim body and Dean is suddenly hit with a bolt of self-consciousness. Usually, Dean's got no issue not looking like your standard Omega. He's tall and broad where he's supposed to be short and skinny, big where he's supposed to be much smaller, and hell, he's still got a scar on his nose from when Sammy broke it two years ago. Who is he to be Inias's match?
spent most of the dance talking about himself, Sam, and Jack. But Castiel had looked interested enough.
Cas frowns, brows furrowed. "No." He presses a cup of water into Dean's hands, and he drinks half before speaking again.
"I hope your ears are alright, Your Majesty," Dean says in a stage whisper, faking an apologetic look. Castiel laughs.
and it's getting out of control. Cas also brings him his meals personally, instead of using servants
That leaves Inias, doesn't it? The other Omega contributes to the conversation every so often, but after he makes a remarkably targeted remark (and receives a warning glance from
Sam grabs Dean's shoulder and stops him mid-hallway. "Dean. You know it's okay if you... if you like him that way. I just want you to be happy."
," he says. "Ray doesn't usually- his work to keep the Novaks in power takes up most of his time, and Crowley just bothers him. But maybe he's considering it."
They stop in front of a door at the end of a dead-ended hallway. She knocks, two fast knocks and two slow ones. After a moment, someone opens the door- a tall Alpha with brown hair and a graying beard.
"Are you kidding-" Dean tries to protest, but Charlie is already out the door, talking quickly to a servant outside. A moment later, a man with curly brown hair ducks into the room.
Dean shrugs, ignoring the sharp little twist his heart gives. Castiel's lovers are none of his business (except that they sort of are), and he shouldn't give up his principles for some powerful Alpha with a rough voice that makes his knees weak. So he just nods and doesn't ask Charlie anything more about Inias, or Castiel, for that matter. What he
spies," Dean says vehemently. She just laughs and drains her glass. He pauses, and then asks, "What did you and Bobby have in mind for me? How can I keep a King who has everything already? Including a lover."
Gabriel grins and extends a hand, which- interesting choice of gesture, Dean thinks- Alphas shake each other's hands, Omegas kneel or bow. But Gabriel wouldn't force Sam to kneel, and therefore submit, he's not that type of asshole. Also, he knows, or probably has a good idea that Dean would beat the shit out of him if he did, bedridden and injured or not. Sam's surprised too, but he recovers quickly and shakes Gabriel's hand, a small smile on his face.
the first to make a move this time. He aims his lance and lets Baby dart forward. It hits Michael just beneath the shoulder. The announcer, who calls hits, shouts that it counts.
He flushes hard and halfway wishes that the earth would open up and swallow him whole, because Castiel is
"Shurleys," Charlie says. Dean nods and files that away for later. "Castiel has never actually courted any of the Omegas he sleeps with. He's either holding out, for whatever reason, or he just doesn't want a mate."
"I think Raziel's running sign-ups," she says. "You can ask him when we get inside." Dean nods as they walk into the room. Servants are all over, setting the tables for dinner. Some courtiers are hanging around in respective corners of the room. Victor and Raziel are in a heated discussion just a few feet away, and when Charlie and Dean approach, they pull apart, Victor's expression turning from anger to a false, bright smile. Raziel notably does the same, for once. Charlie and Victor are the skilled players here- Raziel and Dean aren't as good at pulling themselves together and putting on the constant show that the court demands.
Alpha. And who better than an Omega of nobility to seduce him? To bear his claiming bite and sit beside him as his consort?
Before Dean can speak, Inias says, "Whatever game your friend is playing with my brother, it stops now."
" Dean just grits his teeth and keeps a smile on his face. It's very hard to not turn around and slam his fist into their faces, but Charlie whispering vicious insults she wishes she could say to them in Dean's ear keeps him grounded and slightly sane.
like a squirrel," Sam counters, rolling his eyes. "Whenever we get pie, you cram all of it in your mouth at once like you haven't eaten in a week." He puffs out his cheeks. "You look like a squirrel."
Servants poured out of the kitchen and into the hall, carrying large dishes. It was a feast, and Dean couldn't stop himself from trying just a bit of everything.
"Them," he looks pointedly down the table at a group of men and women who are looking right back at them. "They're the Shurleys, and what they want is the exact opposite of the Novaks. They want Prince Gabriel restored to the throne, regardless of whether or not he wants that. They're all about the status quo, and doing everything by the book, including this business about 'first sons inherit the kingdom'." He pauses. "They also are out of favor. They might be powerful, but without the King's favor, you have nothing here. They're stuck in the past, they liked the power that Castiel's father gave them. They don't have that anymore, because Gabriel abdicated. And they are very bitter about it."
There was only one person with them that hadn't been at court during King Charles's reign, and that was Inias. It showed, too, and that was when Dean realized that Castiel was much more clever than Dean had been giving him credit for- he'd gotten some of the most prominent courtiers during his father's reign alone, and yet involved his lover so as to not offend his family. And he talked to each of them in turn, asking gentle questions about what it had been like to work under Charles. Even Michael managed to talk a little about it, judging by the guilty look on his face after. But Dean was last, and took second prize after Michael for toughest nut to crack.
. Your concern was genuine, which makes you different. You have to catch his eye somehow, Dean. Everyone needs something to make them stand out- I suppose you're going to tell the truth." He laughs, and it sounds almost bitter. "Novel, isn't it. Honesty."
"Has anyone ever touched you down here before, Dean?" Castiel asks, pressing a finger to Dean's perineum, making him jerk in surprise.
Meg grinned. "I was going to win, anyway. Go on, Lafitte, Winchester. I'll take care of these for you," and she pocketed their coins again. Dean huffed, pretending to be offended.
Victor's grip tightens. "Yes," he says. "You were honest with him. In this court, nobody's ever honest. We're all forever in service to the King, letting him win any games we play, constantly pandering to his whims and pretending to adore him. But just then-
Then a shadow falls over him, and he feels someone's hand brush his ear. He tilts his head back to look-
Meg rolled her eyes. "The little tart the king's fucking. Thinks he's top of the world now that he's in his bed."
"A summons," Dean replied, looking back down at the letter. His eyes were wide and his grip on the paper was tight. "A summons to court."
"It's alright, Sir Winchester. I wasn't expecting to be meeting anyone new in the stables, so I don't look very kingly, do I?" he says, blue eyes sparkling.
instead of Inias is a huge step forward. And Dean smiles, takes the grape, and pops it into his mouth. It's nothing but eating a piece of fruit, but it means so much
one that I want, I've got to fend off half the damn upper class for him? What's the point? Why keep going?"
"Alright," he mutters, "Let's try it." Grabbing the edge of the nightstand, Dean hauls himself to his feet and almost falls over immediately. The table and the bed behind him help to steady him, and he just stands there for about a minute, beaming and reveling in the fact that he can
"It's fine," Dean pipes up, waving Balthazar back so he can exit the stall. "Nobody's harassing anyone."
The dark-haired man glares at him. "This would be a two-way disaster. Your friend, and by extension, the Novaks, would go down too if you failed. Not just Michael, not just the Shurleys."
Raziel looks like he wants to say something, but Victor shoots him a look and he stays quiet. Charlie fills the silence instead- "You'd better not tell that to him. As far as he's concerned, you
When they get back, Dean is one of the last people out of the stables. Baby deserves nothing but the best, what can he say? But when he leaves her stall, he's met by a startling sight- Inias, standing outside with his arms crossed and expression clouded.
See, the new King is King Castiel, King Charles' second son. Usually, second sons do not become King. And Castiel was not originally ruler- his older brother, the Alpha Gabriel, was. However, shortly after his coronation, he abdicated the throne in favor of remaining a prince. That was when Castiel was crowned, and it's been two years since then. And Castiel, too, is an Alpha, a powerful,
Castiel stood. "Thank you," he said, and then turned to Dean. "Thank you as well, Sir Winchester. Perhaps, if you're so inclined, you'd be open to learning a little astronomy? I'm sure that your brother is not the only intellectual in your family."
i loved writing this, but as i go through it now, i realize that in the short time of seven months since this fic was started, my writing style has changed. not only that, but also the way i wanted to tell this story has changed as well. i was going to initially rework/rewrite this fic, but i wanted to make so many changes that if i did end up rewriting, it would change the plot entirely, in a way i wasn't totally comfortable with.
"Had a meeting with Raziel and I earlier today. They decided that the two of us could help you build a reputation at court."
They're pretty near the doors of the room where Castiel and Lucifer are talking, and there are raised voices coming from inside, but they're too far away to hear much of anything coherent. Dean presses himself to the wall and inches closer, and Sam follows.
He forces himself to take a moment to steady himself. Dean wasn't Castiel's then, but he is now, and that is what matters. He can do nothing about the past but keep it from plaguing Dean in the present as best as he can.
But Milligan's playing hard to get- which seems to be the new trend. If he's even playing at all, that is. He doesn't seem to show much interest in the high-ranking Shurley whatsoever. But when he
The older Alpha shrugs carelessly, "Some of your people are not as loyal as they say they are. Not the point. Where's Cassie?"
Dean can almost hear Charlie rolling her eyes. "True, but all Dean really has to do is befriend him. I got you your newest title by advising His Highness on how to keep the other lords in line."
Inias is a disaster. Dean might know how to mount a horse, but Inias doesn't, which is made very clear when he needs help getting into the saddle. Now, Dean's not going to shame someone for not being able to get into the saddle- Jack's not great at it, and neither was he when he first started riding. But this... this is a whole
"One way to do that is to make friends with a Shurley or two," Charlie adds. "You're currently associated with me, Bobby, and Raziel here. Bobby's trying to work his way into the good graces of the current King, which places him on the same side as the Novaks. I'm assisting, which means the same for me. Raziel's a Shurley, which means everyone associates him with them-"
"I'm going to move just a little, sweet boy," he says. "Keep your hands where they are." Dean nods, and so he shifts from straddling him to spreading his legs and settling between them. A bottle of lube appears beside Dean's thigh as Castiel unzips Dean's pants, gently urging him to lift his hips so he can pull them and his boxers off.
He does pull back slightly, intending to slot their cocks together, but as soon as he shifts, Dean's eyes fly open, panic in his gaze. He lets out a tiny cry and tries to push against Castiel's hold, tries to get closer. So Castiel makes the rest of the movement quickly, completely straddling Dean now. He leans back over and rains soft kisses on Dean's face, placing his hand over the print on Dean's shoulder. His eyes are wide and starting to glass over, tiny hitched noises coming out of his mouth every time Castiel touches him.
Inias smirks again, a slow, lazy thing and he purrs, "I'll be off as well, then. Sweet dreams, Winchester. I know I won't be getting many." And he shoves past them, going to the double doors. When Sam looks back at Dean, he looks almost ill.
Dean is alone, so he lets himself indulge for a moment in all the insane emotions his Cas makes him feel. He lets himself be afraid of them, but lets everything in him finally scream that
Sam shakes his head- "I don't know. He pretty much took Adam hostage, threatened his life if Gabriel didn't take him to the King."
"Your hair is a disaster," Charlie tuts, running her fingers through Dean's hair. "What did you do, stand in the path of a tornado?"
a huge breach of etiquette, but Castiel didn't bring it up, didn't want to talk about it, then Dean would
Dean's not stupid, he knows what this is implying. Castiel's not asking for Dean to take it with his teeth. It's too much, way too soon. But the implications are still there. The traditional gesture, like Castiel and Inias have done, shows that an Alpha can provide for an Omega. And the fact that Castiel is offering the less potent version of it to
"Good," Castiel praises. "If you don't like anything, or you feel uncomfortable or scared, you will tell me. Is that clear?"
Charlie steps in, "This isn't just charm and appeal- this is politics, too. Castiel taking you as his lover would be giving the Novaks much more power in court, that should be obvious. But you won't get in bed without their help. So you have to be politically appealing to them first, to get them to take a chance on us."
"Sure!" the kid says and leads Baby to the other end of the courtyard. He points at a couple men leading their horses in. "That's it!"
"Had to show you I wasn't some sort'a-" Dean suppresses a painful cough that ends up coming out anyway, just as a painful wheeze instead. "Some sort'a weak Omega. I c'n do it. I
ago, mostly for attempting to murder Gabriel and plotting King Castiel's death as well. He only made it worse by fathering a child with a peasant woman. And that's where it gets tricky, because that peasant woman's name was Kelly Kline, and her son is Jack Kline. Jack, adopted by Bobby with King Charles' permission. Jack, Sam and Dean's
we know." And he very pointedly looks over at Inias, who's trying to make conversation with Castiel. Victor snickers.
"I did," he says, smiling at him. "I can see why it's your favorite. You have very good taste in literature, Dean."
"Equal in title and biology, sure," Raziel says, "But completely unequal in family and- and every way that really matters once titles and ranks are out of the way. And the Shurleys wouldn't have him anyway."
"No," he says, "You have options, there's always a way. If you don't want to do this anymore, we can go to Bobby and make it happen."
Michael Shurley steps up beside Dean and eyes Lucifer with distrust. "Lucifer. I hope you're being courteous."
Bobby sighs. "Dean, this is your only chance to go back. The King's allowing second chances to the traitors, and you must take advantage of his kindness. Who knows how long it will last?"
Castiel knew it. He smiled, and pressed no further on the subject. Dean felt a slight uneasiness in the pit of his stomach- Castiel was settling in to play the long game. He wanted to know what had really happened at his father's court, why the great Winchesters had left, and was willing to wait the more stubborn brother out to figure it out. Politics here might be less fraught, but it was rife with old fears and grudges and pain. And this king was trying to get right into the thick of it.
"Yes," Dean says, and remembers his manners quickly, tacking on "Your Highness" at the end. Castiel just smiles down at him as the dance ends.
Adam shakes his head. "He was getting pissed," he says. "Physical stuff grounds me when I'm upset, figured it might do the same for him." Michael himself doesn't seem to be paying much attention, just staring at the broken glass on the floor at the front of the room.
Cas just shakes his head and moves over a bit, so a few servants can start getting what armor they can off of Dean. Someone's called for a doctor, but the palace is a ways away from here. It'll be a little bit before he shows up. That's okay, though. Dean can wait.
The Shurley digs his heels into his horse's sides and gets them to go at absolute breakneck speed. Dean evades what would have been a hit powerful enough to unseat him, and only catches the lance when it slows, right below the collarbone. He grits his teeth so he doesn't scream, almost flying off anyway. Thankfully Baby doesn't panic and throw him, so he stays in the saddle. There's a shout from the announcer and a whoop from the crowd. They're tied.
," he whispers, standing and closing most of the distance between them in a few short seconds. Castiel's look of confusion changes to his usual fondness and then into worry, eyebrows furrowed as he surveys Dean for damage.
Oh, Sam knows why Dean's here- everybody does, and besides, he was the first person Dean told about it. But Bobby and Charlie had said they'd come to the compromise that Dean was only supposed to befriend the monarch, the way Charlie had done. Were they still going along with the original plan?
btw- two updates?? i know, i'm just as shook about it as you. 0.0 i just had to, i knew this was going to be a very !!! chapter and i wanted to write it and get it out as soon as possible! AAA *incoherent excited screaming* AND YOU'LL SEE WHY!
The dream dissipates, and if Castiel takes the liberty of leaving the largest bruise on Dean's neck as the only evidence of what happened, nobody can do anything about it.
little brother," Lucifer says, tone turning patronizing. A ripple of whispers rushes through the court- rarely did anyone bring up their family tree in such a direct way. But if it had to be anyone, it'd be Lucifer, for sure. Sam had to be given the crash course on the politics of the Shurley family by Charlie on his second day after he asked Gabriel offhandedly if he had any other siblings besides Castiel. The whole thing was just embarrassing.
“Yeah, oh,” Dean said. “Hopefully he’ll think the whole thing was funny.” Sam nodded, but before he could reply, the king was already on his feet, greeting the courtiers. Dean ignored most of it, but snapped back to reality as his name came up.
Looking back into Dean's dreams, Castiel sees that he must have just missed something, some change of pace in the man's mind. Because now, instead of bitter self-loathing, there is- there's
"He's doing it," Dean points out. "Are you going to keep him back as well? Or wait- even better, Adam Milligan? I heard he wanted to as well. And he's an Omega, just like me, right? So what about him?"
"Dean," the angel rasps. "Oh, my good boy." He looks up just in time to see Dean close his eyes and press his lips together, swallowing back a noise. He reaches up and grasps Dean's chin- "Don't hide from me," he rumbles, "I want to hear you." Dean exhales shakily and nods, eyes fluttering shut at Castiel's touch. He knows Dean's touch-starved- nobody touches him, gives him affection like they should. Castiel will fix that.
"We should probably go inside," Balthazar cuts in. "The court will have your head if you don't start dinner on time, Cassie."
Dean may be down for the count, but life at court goes on. Meanwhile, Adam makes an unlikely friend.
Dean looks pissed, and he opens his mouth to tell Inias off, but Sam cuts him off and says, "Look. We don't want any trouble-" he eyes Dean and tries to really hammer that home, "So we're going to go, alright?"
Dean does not remember much from Hell, Castiel made sure of that. But the human mind is finicky, and wants to recall everything, so memories he has repressed come in flashes and echoes. But then they begin to take an alarming turn, away from Hell and towards Sam Winchester's death, their childhood, and a memory of a then-four year old Dean standing outside of a burning house with a baby in his arms. And while the memories are fleeting, the roiling emotions they bring about remain. Anger, always anger. Fear and sadness, with their claws sunk deep into Dean's very soul. A vague sense of emptiness, that Castiel always finds hidden beneath all the rest of them, an aching for a feeling Dean cannot describe and a home he doesn't have.
Charles's only legitimate son was Castiel, which was why, despite the fact that he was the youngest, he was on the throne. Michael and Lucifer had been first, their mother being a lady at court who was later Gabriel's mother as well. Raphael was third, by yet another woman, then Gabriel, and Castiel by the woman he eventually married, Queen Naomi (who died in childbirth). It made Dean's head hurt to even think about. But if the concept of royal benevolence was untrustworthy to Dean and Sam, it was completely foreign to Michael, and it showed.
"I asked Sam for them," he says, his smile growing softer. "He and I both thought you might like to have them."
Castiel cuts that stream of thought off right where it is, slamming the nightmares back into their respective corners of Dean's mind where they won't cause more trouble. He is angry, yes, but not at Dean (not at Dean, never at Dean). He is angry at all the people who have hurt Dean, at every person who didn't treat Dean like they should have, like the precious being that he is. How
"Hello, Dean," Castiel says, enjoying how deep and gravelly the vessel's voice is (though it's nothing compared to his true voice), and the way Dean shivers a little at it.
"Yeah," he nods, "She told me the same thing. Apparently nobody talks about it. I didn't know until he told me."
of love songs, and his voice isn't terrible. So, sitting on a stool that someone has helpfully pulled out, in front of the King and God and everyone, Dean softly strums a chord and launches into the first song that comes to him. It's an older folk song, popular in the countryside where his family's estate is, and it's slow and romantic, just like Victor suggested.
"Patience," Castiel says, pushing Dean's hips back into the mattress. He squirms in his hold for a moment, but when Castiel fixes him with a look, he stills. "Good boy," he says, voice dark and husky, into Dean's ear. He feels Dean shudder beneath him, which is an
what I was worried about," Cas mutters, eyes glued to the mess that is Dean's chest. He's bleeding in a couple places, and what isn't bleeding is already bruising.
"You don't have to," Castiel says, the streetlights forming a sort of halo around him from behind. He looks ethereal, and even though his eyes aren't glowing with divine fury, he looks every bit the angel he is under these flickering lights. "I know, Dean. You were so brave to tell me. I know you do."
The thought of Inias and Castiel together again is way more painful than Dean thinks it should be. Didn't he decide that
"You did more than 'good'," Raziel says, jerking his chin at a few older men sitting across the table from them. "Those are the Novaks, some of the greatest lords at court. They helped with Prince Gabriel's abdication, and are viciously supportive of the King. They were the ones who told Castiel to do what he wants."
Speaking of, Castiel and Gabriel are the last to bring out their horses- Gabriel mounts quickly and easily, and it's clear that he knows his way around horses. Michael and Victor do the same, glaring at each other pointedly from across the courtyard. When Castiel looks Dean's way, almost as if he would help him into the saddle, Dean looks back and confidently swings into the saddle, holding the reins in one hand and petting behind Baby's ears with the other.
do u trust me now when i say heebie jeebies? also, i didnt even think about how michael and lucifer would be connected to chuck/gabe/cas until i started writing this, and i think it came out alright. for reference, michael is the oldest, then lucifer, gabriel and castiel.
Sam, Dean's younger brother, is in said gardens now. He is with their adopted brother, Jack, and they are sparring, though they're careful not to actually hit each other.
Because Dean apparently can't have nice things, it sends him into a coughing fit, and his chest screams with pain with every breath he drags in. Someone bursts into the room, judging by the footsteps and the sound of the door, but Dean's doubled over, can't see them, and is too out of breath to care. They're talking, rubbing his back and murmuring to him, and as the hacking coughs subside and he's able to take a breath, he recognizes Cas' scent.
Inias smiled back at her, his expression almost poisonous. "I have been, but I wanted to meet at least one of the Winchester brothers tonight." Turning to Dean, he extended a hand. "I'm Inias Novak."
weren't there previously, and he's gripping Dean's hand like it's a lifeline. He looks tired. He looks
Cas is a good one. Dean gravitates towards him like a moth to a light, as much as he tries to put a lid on it. It always seeps out, it is always the gaping crack in his metaphorical armor. Just Cas. As long as he's there, Dean knows he'll be- well, maybe not fine, but he'd happily die if it were at Cas' hands.
"Don't thank us yet," the Duke grumbles. "The Winchesters were once a great family, and helped the Novaks gain power and places at court. My husband has convinced me that returning the favor is not only the right thing to do, but will benefit us both, going forward."
"Lord Novak," Charlie says, curtsying to both this man and the one behind a massive dark wood desk in the center of the room.
But future Cas was also a lot less guarded than his Cas, and so whenever future Dean did something stupid, or brushed past him without looking at him or talking to him, Dean could see every emotion, every reaction flit across his face. He was unashamed of his feelings.
Cas puts down the books he's holding and rushes over to him, a steadying hand on his shoulder. "Are you alright?" he asks.
. In that moment, he felt mostly amusement, mostly happiness, and only a small part of him was relieved that he had managed to turn Castiel away from the previous topic of conversation, and that he had not said too much after all.
"Hi, Cas," he slurs, blinking hard and looking up at the Alpha. Hell, Cas doesn't just sound panicked, he
She sighs. "I'm sorry, Victor. It's the way it is, though. We made the choice to come here, and now we're paying the piper, aren't we?"
"If you never try, you'll never know," the blonde Alpha says, grinning mischievously. He snags another flower from the ground and advances slowly, hand outstretched.
"I suppose you wouldn't," he says, looking up at Dean. In the sunlight his eyes are an even brighter shade of blue, and Dean has look down at their feet to stop himself from blatantly staring. He forces himself to take a step back to stand a respectful distance from Castiel.
i hope all of you will join me in the journey the new fic will take us on! i love each and every one of you. thank you for reading The King's Court <3
"Thank you," he mumbles, and Castiel kisses him on the cheek when he flushes an even darker shade of pink.
"I'm looking," the Alpha says, glancing over his shoulder at the dark-haired Omega. "I'm not seeing perfection."
Dean takes the question for the peace offering that it is and says, "Fuck if I know," shoving his hands in his pockets. He takes one out to slap at his ribs- "It's not like I get out to hear the gossip, not with this."
"Good." The two look up the hallway as a few guards usher stray servants into their rooms. Sam quickly tugs Dean into a dark corner to hide.
and not in the sexy way, either. And the next thing he registers is that he's in someone else's bed, surrounded by someone else's scent.
," Dean recoils. It's an outdated practice, but an Omega kneeling for an Alpha is a blatant show of submission, just like presenting your mating gland is. It's practically illicit, which must be why this court insists on it.
Castiel sits down on the chair beside the bed, his expression softening. "It is not an easy book to read," he says, "Or understand, and you do both. Give yourself some more credit."
get his attention away from Inias (not that he looks anywhere but at you anymore), this would be a good way to do both."
Any further conversation was cut off by the thundering sounds of horses entering the yard. The party was big, and neither really wanted to have to deal with that many people straightaway. Dean glanced over at Sam.
Dean's eyes go comically wide. "Holy sh- I mean-" he stumbles over his words, scraping into a clumsy bow until Castiel smiles and holds up a hand to stop him.
Dean retreats to where Raziel, Charlie, and Victor are standing. Charlie gives him an encouraging nod, and they lead him to one of the couches that's been pulled out by servants.
Later, in the commotion of clearing the table, the couches get pulled out again and a young Beta girl begins to play the piano for dancing. Charlie grins at Dean as he stands and makes his way over to Raziel and Victor, and he shoots her a wink. He feels
Charlie leads Dean out of the room about twenty minutes later. Other courtiers are filling the halls, all going to the dining hall. Dean swallows down his anxiety and ignores the stares from everyone else. The whispers, though- the whispers are another thing. ("
"Well, if you joust as well as you flirt with pretty girls," the Beta says, grinning salaciously, "My money's going on you."
Bobby’s face softened. “No, you won’t. Now, get out of here, the two of you, and go dazzle them all.” Dean straightened his jacket and tried on his courtier smile- fake and bright and full of promise. It felt like slipping on a mask, familiar though it was. Sam was doing the same next to him, though his smile was always smaller, kinder.
"Whatever you say," he smiles up at Cas. The Alpha's scent is all around him, in the sheets and the pillowcases, and Dean finds it way more relaxing than he should. Cas smiles back down at him, a soft, affectionate expression. The room quiets around him as he lets sleep overtake him again.
"Sounds like you're doing it for me," he blurts out, and goes an even darker shade of red when he realizes what he's said.

He has to take a breath to refrain from saying some really fucking rude things, but it's not easy. Keeping his voice steady and relatively calm, he says, "What about Raziel?"
As dinner goes on, Dean notices a group of Omegas sitting close to the head of the table, near the King. Most of them are young men, but there are a few women among them as well. What draws Dean's eye is the dark-haired Omega sitting at Castiel's feet. He wears next to nothing- Dean averts his eyes from
"Thank you," he said, and sounded a lot like he meant it. "I've told your brother this as well, but I wanted to make sure you heard it as well- I'm grateful that you decided to come back to court. I know my father was..." he pursed his lips, clearly searching for an appropriate phrase, "Difficult to serve, but I always admired your dedication to him."
"You are on everyone's side until proven otherwise," he says. "You're loyal to the King, and to the Prince. Until there's an advantage to drawing the line and being on one side or the other, you're staying in the middle."
," he says slowly, like Dean's stupid. "And because, if Victor wasn't a high-ranking Novak and an Alpha, he'd be ruined by what he's doing."
"Alright, then," Dean says quietly, doing the same. He sees everyone else lead their horses onward, so he follows and pretends not to be slightly miffed when Castiel leads Inias' horse alongside his own.
Dean closes the distance and throws his arms around Castiel's neck, tugging him into a tight hug. Cas is stiff for a moment, and
"Good to meet you, Sammoose," Gabriel says, and there's a moment of silence. Then Adam snorts, quickly slapping his hand over his mouth and muffling himself, because
He pushes Dean back, further up the bed. Castiel mumbles in Enochian as he kisses his way down Dean's body, words of protection, promises of love, and most importantly, Castiel's
Dean shudders. He doesn't want to think about it, let alone talk about it, but his mind is already off to the races.
"Exactly," she says, the hem of her dress brushing Dean's feet as she walks past him. "They're-" she pauses. "I'll let them tell you."
Dean's first meal in the palace will determine everything, including which powerful lords of the court will be his enemies.
Dean doesn't speak for a moment. All of this is so much bigger than he thought- the honor of the Winchester name is riding on whether or not he can seduce the King. And he might drag down the Novaks with him if they back him and he fails anyway.
to give favor to anyone. It's easy! It's Novaks versus Shurleys, so what the hell is he doing? But Gabriel takes what looks like a handkerchief and gestures for Dean to stretch out his lance so he can place it on the tip. He does, and just to be
The Alpha breaks through Sam's almost-panicked thoughts with, "I should formally introduce myself, shouldn't I?" Again, it's aimed solely at Adam, so Sam doesn't get involved.
that is the case- he rebuilt Dean from dust and has seen every memory, every base instinct he possesses.
Dean makes a decision and quickly realizes that not everyone is on board with it. Giving up, however, is not an option, especially when Prince Gabriel gets involved.
how he remembers tiny details he's been told about Dean's life before court, or Sam, or Bobby. Hell, half the time Dean looks over in the middle of a sentence and Cas is wearing this soft, fond expression- he's relaxed, he looks happy (what the fuck), and his scent lingers when he leaves, his
Charlie smiled. "I've been well. The king has been very interested in bringing you both back to court since we proposed the idea months ago. I suppose he enjoys the intrigue you bring, even when you are not physically at court."
the King wrote to Bobby after the joust. The King was the one to suggest that I come to court, that you might want to see me. How'd you get the
"Thank you," he says, mentally kicking himself for enjoying the closeness too much. When he pulls back, Cas is smiling at him, which is arguably the best thing in the world, hands down.
"Thanks," Dean says, taking his reins back. The kid just smiles again and takes off, back to his mother. He leads Baby into the stables, picking an empty stall for her at the end of the row. As he takes off her saddle and places it nearby, he hears footsteps coming nearer.
Conversations like this aren't new, per se- they've been going on for about as long as Dean's known Cas. Nowadays, though, they serve only to twist up his insides and tug at his heart. He might have to act like a friend to the King, but Lord knows he doesn't want him like a friend.
"I don't want to go to court," Dean says. "It's- it's stupid. Dad didn't like it there, and I don't either."
Something changes after that. Dean starts to notice things- tiny, small, seemingly insignificant things that somehow make butterflies erupt in his stomach and make the whole room smell like
"I'm sorry to have kept you," the Alpha said, drawing Dean's attention back to him. "And again for knocking into you."
thirdly and lastly, this chapter gives me some heebie jeebies. intentionally. if it didn't we would have some problems. however- heebie jeebies. whatever, enjoy <3
OKAY SO the weekends are usually busy for me so updates then might be slower than usual (for example: tHIS CHAPTER), but HERE WE ARE, SIXTH CHAPTER, LET'S DO IT! sorry there isn't too much interaction between dean and cas in this chapter, it's a bit of a filler but it needed to happen anyway. here you go!
He must have said all that out loud, because Cas says, "I won't. I'm not going anywhere. I promise." It soothes him more than he'd have thought it would, and Cas pulls him back into a hug before he can say anything about it. Because Cas doesn't think he's weak for crying about this. He isn't pushing him away or insulting him at all, and Dean's so grateful for it he could cry all over again.
Dean's smile grows a little wider. "I guess I did," he says quietly, and there they sit- Dean sprawled out in the grass, Castiel seated nearby (almost beside him!) making sure the flower doesn't come loose. The sun is warm on their faces, the noise of the others seeming so much farther away, and the intimacy that seems to lace their every encounter has returned in full force.
Dean gets up from the table when breakfast is over, making excuses to his friends and going to find Gabriel. The Alpha's waiting for him just outside the room where Adam would be getting suited up for the joust.
The gardens are Sam's favorite places in the palace, he's decided. There are always beautiful flowers, and in the middle of the day, when no one's out there, it's quiet with just the noises of the birds in the trees. It's peaceful, and it gives him a place to think without the bustling of the court in the background.
Charlie laughs. "No, no, we do. It's just not the King's favorite, you know, so it doesn't happen often."
"Let me introduce you to a friend of ours," Victor says, gesturing at Dean. "Benny Lafitte, this is Dean Winchester. Dean, Benny."
to get this chapter out. srsly. life's been wild, i've been writing for other pairings and all sorts of things, and this had to be put on the back burner until i could finish it. luckily i did and here we are! thank you for all the continued support despite my looooong absence.
Zachariah. That alternate world he'd put Dean in had scared him, mostly because of what had happened to him and Cas. Future Dean was this apathetic, cruel man who would (and
i should note: the last few chapters have been pretty plot-driven, but the next few will definitely feature a good bit of ~ SPICE ~ so be ready >:)
he's almost giddy with it. Raziel is approached by Crowley once more, and when Raziel looks over at them, Dean raises his cup with a smirk. He rolls his eyes and lets Crowley lead him out anyway, unable to hide his smile.
"It's good to be back," Sam said, covering for Dean seamlessly. Dean watched as they fell into easy conversation, feeling oddly detached from the whole situation. Sam had slipped into his old role easily- almost too easily. He had always been the more level-headed one, even outside of courtly personas, but here, he had always been bright, witty, and ready to debate with anyone. Dean was the impulsive one, loud and energetic. Together, they were the two Winchesters, the two brothers who could charm anyone into anything. Dean didn't feel charming often anymore, but it was clear that he'd have to be- have to pull off
"Dean! What the hell are you doing?" Sam demands, holding his older brother up. He's breathing hard, grip tight on Sam's forearms. "You should be in bed."
Dean rolls his eyes so hard it looks like it hurts. "That's like asking me, if I was trapped in a cave with a bunch of lions, if I ever considered
Raziel arches an eyebrow. "You're not looking to settle down, Dean?" he asks, voice almost sardonic.
Dean nods, "Yes. I used to do it, all the time with Sam. It was one of our favorite hobbies." For whatever reason, Castiel looks... troubled. His brows are furrowed, and he is currently staring at Dean's shoulder instead of his face. "Your Highness?" Dean ventures after a moment.
Dean accepts with a smile. "I'd be honored, Your Majesty," he says, and sees Victor melt away into the crowd to let Dean play his part. Castiel takes the lead, because of course he does, and Dean lets him, because what else is he supposed to do?
"That's Inias," Charlie cuts through his thoughts, a bright smile on her face as if she was talking to Dean about something like horses. "Smile," she hisses quietly. "And stop staring."
"Holy shit," he breathes. That's the Shurley crest, alright- and whose initials are sewn into the fabric?
too funny, the woman tentatively makes eyes at Dean, and Raziel entertains them all with old jousting tales. Charlie's sitting with a few Shurleys tonight, and it's looking like she's got them on the end of her string. Her charm apparently surpasses even family rivalries.
"I will not punish you for telling me what you find displeasing," Castiel continues. "You will not be in trouble, understood?"
Dean keens high in his throat. "Yeah, yeah, yours, I-" Castiel groans and Dean presses himself closer. "
be some more. there's just gotta be some dynamic building going on before we get into it. keep calm tho- deancas is still our main ship and p much the endgame here <3 ily all
Dean wouldn't have to resort to liquor and depression to stay still if Castiel could have his way, he thinks. He would train Dean, make him want to follow orders the way he knew Dean could. He would allow the sarcastic, brazen, defiant parts of him to stay, of course- they are part of Dean, and he would never think of changing him so fundamentally. But he would be so
only gets worse, and as brazen as they are, neither of them go to their respective family to get permission to be together. Part of Dean, the romantic that has apparently wilted some since his arrival at court, wants to be happy for them. He sees how Michael flushes when Victor's around, and how quick Victor is to jump to the other Alpha's defense. But the more cautious parts of him aren't counting on their happiness lasting long, not with the bitter rivalry between their families.
Dean looks over to see Inias watching them with a blatant look of distaste. "No, he doesn't," he agrees, snickering a little. Raziel is biting the inside of his cheek to keep himself from laughing, and Victor is snickering into his hand. It's lighthearted now, but Inias spells trouble, and they all know it. But for the moment, Dean is sitting with his friends, at court, having just danced with the King. Inias has never mattered less.
yeah, so not much explicit sabriel in this chapter (or plot, for that matter, but I LIKE FLUFF), but there
The dark-haired Omega commands the King's attention almost immediately and so Dean slips away, plastering on a fake smile and shoving away his vulnerability to deal with some other time. Victor notices, of course- it
"Balthazar, don't harass anyone," the Alpha says, his gravelly, deep voice sending shivers down Dean's spine. And then he steps into his line of sight.
"Pardon me, Your Majesty, Sir Winchester-" Victor cuts in with a dazzling smile. He offers a hand to Charlie. "Might I interest you with a dance?"
"Crowley," Victor confirms. "A Beta, neither a Novak nor a Shurley. He's on his own side, along with a couple others, but nobody really knows what that 'side' entails."
. The memory of Sam being stabbed in the back by a half-demon is accompanied by all of the emotions. Anger at the hybrid, and Dean himself. Fear for Sam, sadness for him. The emptiness persists, opening wider and threatening to swallow Dean whole. And then there is a deep, dark, vivid splash of hatred.
"Are you joining, Winchester?" asks a slim Beta from across the table. The Alpha sitting next to him grins and arches an eyebrow at Dean, his gaze trailing over Dean's upper body. He pointedly doesn't think about that part too hard, and focuses on the question instead.
Inias has somewhat backed down from his job of seducing the King, which should be good for Dean, but it only makes him more nervous. Why would Inias, already in the King's bed, step away now? Dean hasn't eclipsed him in power with the King- if anything, they are just the same there as they were previously.
"Come on! She's lovely, Cassie. Just your type, too," says a second man, and Dean notices his accent.
Cas looks like that, but he presses his fingertips to Cas' cheek and hopes that makes it better. "'S okay, Cas," he says, forcing himself to open his eyes again. "'S not your fault. Shouldn't worry about me."
like he cares about what happens to him, like he'd be upset if Dean kicked it. The Omega parts of him that he's hidden away are practically preening under the attention, happy that somebody finally saw through the facade of acting okay. But the larger part of him that does that acting, that posturing as an Alpha recoils. He doesn't need anyone to care about him, he's done just fine on his own, hasn't he? But then- running is tiring. Maybe he should let himself have this. Doesn't mean Cas isn't making mountains out of molehills, though, because he totally is.
Dean looks up at Castiel, who's watching Inias go with a stony expression on his face. For a moment he looks down at his plate, but then he looks up and meets Dean's gaze, effectively pinning him to his seat. He decides quickly to take a page from Charlie's book and looks away to pick up his wine and take a sip. As he puts the glass down, he looks back up at the man on the throne, seeing that he hasn't looked away. A warm feeling floods him, and he has to hide his smile in his cup.
"You wouldn't know anything about my type," the first voice returns. As the two men get closer, Dean can smell one of them- an
"Sure it is," he laughed and dismissed it with a wave of his hand. "Anyway, as I'm sure you've already discovered, Your Highness, Sam's the intellectual of the two of us."
Future Cas looked at Dean the way his Cas sometimes did, with fondness and the occasional reverence and sadness and
The man shifted, and Dean caught a bit of his scent- an Alpha, one who smelled like the salt of the sea and sandalwood and something he couldn't distinctly name. It made his mouth water, and he swallowed hard. Now was not the time.
"This place reminds me of the countryside near my family's estate," Raziel says, running a hand through his dark hair. "It was my mother's favorite. We would braid flowers into her hair when we were younger."
?) it's not a great combo, not a scent Dean would wish on someone else. There's a reason he and Castiel haven't danced like that, that intimately, since then. It stings, but Dean's been through worse. He can manage.
"Dad told me everything I need to know about it," the eldest Winchester retorts, walking away from the older man and going to the balcony. He leans on the railing, looking over it and into the gardens.
But then Dean catches a glimpse of Charlie's questioning expression, and the moment is effectively shattered. He takes a deep breath and forces himself to drop Castiel's hands, to step away. He can't stay here, not now. Not with the King's eyes still on him, not with all these people around. He doesn't even remember to bow, just stumbles backward with wide, horrified eyes. He leaves, pushing through the crowd of confused people and trying desperately to regain some semblance of his control.
The next day, the King emerges from his chambers. Apparently, he'd been doing... kingly things? Dean wasn't paying attention when Raziel told him the day before, and he can't pretend he isn't bored by politics. The real kicker, though, is that Dean doesn't
"Serving the King is the top priority," Raziel says. "But after that? Gaining places and money and power always comes next. And that's the real bloodbath."
, Michael?" His tone is loaded with fake concern. "Can't have been too easy after dear old Dad died, catering to our little siblings' whims."
Cas comes in just then, holding the Vonnegut book. Dean sits up, pushing himself back onto the pillows behind him.
"Good," he murmurs, pushing Dean over to the bed until the backs of his knees hit the wood. Castiel leans forward and captures Dean's lips with his own. It's a sweet, slow kiss- it's supposed to be. There's no need to rush, and he wants to savor every moment of the sensation of Dean's skin sliding against his.
well, this fic is going to stay up. it might be edited, but only to clean it up a little. and i'm going to start a new one, with all of the court drama and politics and romance that this one had- if not more of it. the first chapter will be up at... some point this week, maybe next. if you want to check that out, just keep your eyes peeled for it in the near future. i do want you guys to still be able to read this and come back to it (seeing as over 5,000 of you read it, which is frankly insane to think about), so it's staying up.
Kate Milligan was the kindest woman on the face of the planet. Of that, Sam is pretty much certain. She only ever worked for the Winchesters, and when John Winchester died, Bobby, who was left the Winchester lands, gave her a definitely deserved raise, because John could be stingy. But she never had a bad thing to say about him, or anyone. She was a caring woman who raised her son to respect people and follow his dreams. And then, the summer Sam turned 20, a fever descended upon the countryside, and she fought it for almost two months before she died.
did it? If Castiel, the angel, the one who pulled him from Hell and fell from Heaven for him, decided that it was time to take Dean permanently out of the picture- well, hasn't Dean screwed up Cas' life enough? Hasn't he pulled him from purity and made him crawl in the dirt with him?
Dean forced himself to smirk, his stomach churning with dread and disbelief. "Well, I wouldn't know what that feels like. I live with Sam, a professional nag."
Michael glares down his nose at his younger brother. "I am happy to serve the King. As you should be, instead of letting your ambition rule you."
to them, but yeah, he supposes it's Dean's title now). He nods, "Yes, I am." She exchanges a quick look with Gabriel and then she's asking about how Sam likes the song that's playing, and the weird little moment's over.
Crawling up Dean's body, Castiel captures his lips with his own before positioning himself at Dean's hole. They lock eyes as he sinks in slowly, but halfway through Dean breaks eye contact to throw his head back, arms still resting above him.
"Have you heard about the joust?" Castiel asks as the music starts, his hands on Dean feeling like brands. It is very hard to think when he's so close, when Dean can smell him and
So it's the morning of, three days later, and Dean is caught between anxiety and fierce excitement. Adam excused himself during breakfast, claiming that his "sickness" had gotten worse. Dean and Gabriel pointedly didn't look at each other during it, nor did Dean look at Victor when Michael caught Adam's wrist and asked him with soft concern in his voice if he was alright.
"How old is Jack?" Castiel inquires as he twirls Dean around. He tries very hard not to focus on how big Castiel's hands are around his waist when he's reeled back in, closer to the King than ever.
The king had asked Dean, Sam, Charlie, Inias, and King Charles's (first) illegitimate son, Michael Shurley, who Dean did not like at all (for reasons he'd rather not go into), to go with him for a ride, so Dean was in the stables with Baby. (Baby was his horse, a big, black, hunter who Dean treated better than pretty much everybody, but what could he say? She was a classy lady.) But he'd expected to be the only person in the stables for a little while- and he was not.
"Sure, fine," Dean mutters, but smiles anyway, not caring if it doesn't reach his eyes. "Who's Inias?"
He sighs. "I hardly have him 'hooked'. We're friends, I think. Maybe. Anyway, he's just a nice guy, of course he'd write."
ALRIGHT! the plot speeds up a little bit from here, and sam's involved now so >:) we'll see how THAT goes. also adam! my boy! my sweet sunshine child! i love him. he had to be in here, the bby.
"Alright. What're we talkin' about?" he asks, even though he knows good and well what she's here for. He glances at the window. It's still dark out, and while Dean and the rest of the court gets up early anyway, it's never
The man has pale skin, dark brown (almost black) hair, and the most striking dark blue eyes Dean has ever seen. He's wearing a loose, white, button-down shirt, black riding pants, and boots. And his gaze is locked firmly on Dean, instead of his friend to whom he's actually speaking.
"No problem," he shoots him a wink. "Now, you know what to do, right? Both of you go up beneath the royal box and wait for Cassie to give the signal, or whatever."
is that you almost died, and I was worried about you. It doesn't have to be the worst thing you've ever experienced to still hurt, Dean. You are not
The voice of the King interrupts them- "I hear we have a newcomer today," he says, and Dean suppresses a shiver at his low, rough voice.
The room is almost silent as Dean makes his way up to the throne. His stomach churns with anxiety, but he forces himself forward anyway, determined not to embarrass himself on his first night at the King's court. And when he reaches the throne, he drops to his knees, keeping his head low and his eyes on the red carpet beneath him.
." And just like that, Dean arches off the bed with a broken sob and comes, painting Castiel's chest white with it. The sight of it alone is enough for Castiel to come, burying himself one more time in Dean's hole. "
Raziel nudges his shoulder, interrupting them. "Dean. Now," he whispers, looking up the table at the King. And Dean supposes he has no choice. He stands and pushes back his chair, careful to keep his eyes on the floor.
"And that is what makes your position so well-known," Charlie says, "You're out and proud about it. But Dean-" she turns to look at him. "You are currently undecided, which means many of the lords in this room will try to convince you to pick a side. Staying as undecided as possible for as
Dean tugs his shirt down and wills away the dark red blush on his cheeks and across his nose as Castiel returns with a plate of food. It's all little things you can eat with your fingers- grapes, little cubes of cheese, the like. He sits beside Dean and puts the plate between them, but before Dean can reach for anything, Castiel picks up a grape and wordlessly offers it to him.
"So should we be placing our bets on you?" a pretty Omega woman in a blue-green dress says, smiling demurely.
The human eventually moves from the chair he has been slumped in for the past thirty minutes to one of the twin beds in the room, the one closest to the door. It is moments like this that make Castiel want to show himself the most. Dean does not even realize what he's doing, not really- if anyone were to break in, Dean would be first in the line of fire, first to face it. It has always been like this for him. This cautious, dangerous, lonely life is all Dean Winchester knows, and Castiel desperately yearns to show him something different, give him the peace and goodness he has always deserved.
Lucifer's face twists into a sickly sweet smile with an edge of malice. "Why wouldn't I be?" He places a hand on Michael's forearm. "How are
Adam Milligan, as it turns out, is way more helpful than Dean originally gave him credit for. Gabriel (as he's instructed Dean to call him) roped him in in a second that night, knowing good and well that Adam has the probably short-lived gift of anonymity, which he and Dean don't. So the three of them stayed up entirely too late the night of the fateful dance, and came up with maybe the most insane plan ever to get Dean into the joust. As Gabriel had said when they started-
Despite his instincts to not share Dean, Castiel also creates a visage of a pretty woman, just Dean's type, to get him to enter the bedroom. So when the door opens behind him, the sharp intake of breath that follows is practically music to his ears.
ah yes, politics and dean's self-worth issues and a bit of fluff. my favorite! anyway, drop that kudos for more, and potential ~ spice ~ next chapter >:)
Castiel is already there, talking to Lord Novak. Everyone's seated by the time they stop, the two of them smiling at each other. Castiel even claps him on the back as he leaves. Raziel, who's sitting with Crowley and Victor across the table, shoots Dean a conspiratorial look. He knows just as well as Dean does- Castiel publicly chumming it up with a prominent Novak is practically outright declaring who's in power once more.
He slicks up his fingers and coos to Dean as he slowly circles the rim of Dean's pretty, pink hole. When he finally slides his index finger inside Dean, the human gasps and rocks down, forcing it deeper. Castiel can tell that it touches Dean's prostate by how he moans and tries to do it again.
He shrugs, "She's in with the heads of the Novak family, I think she knows. And I... Michael and I, we've been talking. He came to the garden again the day after you were there. He was upset about something, and we talked about it, and then I made him pick bugs off the bushes with me. So it... it started there, I guess."
Dean grumbled, but didn't argue. He scanned the courtyard- there were servants everywhere, maids and pageboys and men from the stables. In the crowd, he spotted a flash of red hair- Lady Charlie Bradbury, an old ally of theirs. She had been very new to court when they had left, but even then, everyone knew that she would become a woman of power and influence. She, along with Bobby Singer and Adam Milligan, had been mostly in charge of keeping the Winchester name alive within many social circles of the court. It was clear that she had done her job well.
Michael turns and finally looks at Sam, jaw tight and tense. "Yes. Our father was King Charles, God rest his soul." He mutters the last words as if he doesn't believe them. "I'm going to get a drink." He looks at Adam, who nods and offers a placating smile, then turns and leaves.
under Castiel, made obedient and coming only when ordered to. White-hot, twisted lust soars through Castiel, and he has to hold himself back so he does not inadvertently reveal himself. Because now is not the time, not yet.
"Sure," he agrees, and Castiel smiles down at him, standing and going over to the servants nearby. Dean stretches lazily, arching his back and baring his neck. As he sits up, Benny winks at him, and Michael- Michael is staring. Dean looks down- his shirt has ridden up, and a strip of his tanned skin shows to everyone. Raziel pays no attention, and neither does Benny, or Victor (beyond an exaggerated wink). But Michael and Inias are staring- and so is Castiel.
But he doesn't say it, because Cas would probably take it badly. He doesn't want to upset him. Meanwhile, the other half of his brain is screaming about
by the way, this chapter and the next few are where the plot really speeds up, so hold on to your hats !
Dean glowers up at him. "I've been a pretty damn good patient, and that's 'cause Cas asked. I think I'm allowed some leeway. Why is
"That's what I was going to say," Dean nodded, and grabbed Sam's elbow, steering him into the nearest room with an open door. They took the stairs up and into the maze of apartments and rooms. There were court ladies and pages loitering in doorways and on the stairs, and the sight was so familiar that it felt, for a moment, as if Dean had never left. But he could hear their whispers-
"You're really alright," Dean said, and let Sam excuse them both, however unwilling he might have secretly been to leave.
, and the Shurleys (but especially Inias) are sure to pick a fight about that once they figure out what happened. He's got to put some sort of distance between him and Castiel, he decides, as if there was really any to start with. All of their interactions have had some strange intimacy to them so far, and Dean can't believe he's saying this, but he has to tone it down. He has to act like any other courtier, all smiles and too-perfect to be legitimate. He has to be muddled plastic to Castiel's transparent glass. He needs to be... as ordinary as you can be in this court. He can be Castiel's friend if he does that.
Dean frowns, his protective instincts emerging despite himself. "You should get some rest, then," he says. For a moment he forgets his role as a charming courtier and presses lightly on Castiel's shoulders, getting him to sit down on the stone bench just behind him. Trying to lighten the mood, he jokes, "We wouldn't want our beloved monarch collapsing of exhaustion."
necessary, and it's mindless enough that Sam can let his mind wander as he helps Adam do it. Adam hums under his breath as he looks over the leaves, folk songs that Sam remembers his mother singing back home. Before her untimely death, that is.
," the Alpha says, and Dean looks up at him again. He's watching him with an intensity that Dean's only ever seen directed at other people
Castiel gently pulls at Dean's flannel, tugging it down his arms until it drops to the floor behind them. He is unable to stop himself from sliding his hand under the sleeve of the other man's t-shirt and placing his hand firmly over his handprint. Dean shudders against him, letting out a tiny whimper. He grinds his hips up into Castiel's helplessly, and Castiel pulls away from Dean's spit-slick lips to push him down and get him to sit on the bed. He doesn't move his hand.
The plan involves Adam signing up for the joust, which he's done. But Gabriel also underlined that for the two days before it, Adam's to play sick. The idea is to have Dean take Adam's place in the joust without anyone knowing. They're similar enough in size, and if it all goes well, Dean can get out of the armor and have one of Gabriel's servants pretend that
"Yeah," Sam says, like Dean should have known the whole time. "After you left, Bobby offered to take him in and send him to court. His mom was our neighbor a few years back- Kate Milligan, remember? Well, she asked, and he's here now, so Bobby delivered."
"Dean," the Alpha starts, but Dean's shaking his head and cutting him off. The fact that Castiel is even trying to
"We will," Sam assured her, and, after a few more pleasantries, she left, citing the need to inform Singer of their arrival.
"Yeah. He's- what, two years older than Castiel? And he's not married. I heard him say once that he doesn't want anybody tying him down."
The palace towered above them, an intimidating yet familiar reminder of why they had come, and what they were called once more to do. Sam tilted his head to look at the stained glass, but Dean kept his eyes fixed on the dirt below his feet.
"Hush, Dean." he says, holding Dean's hips down again with one hand. "You've never done this before, so we're going to go slow." Dean whines, but stops moving and lets him slide a second finger in. He pushes them in and out a few times and admires how the rim of Dean's hole clenches around them.
Dean suppresses a shudder. "I thought we were here to, y'know- serve the King and have fun and whatever."
Sam takes a step forward and catches his brother's shoulder once more as he paces past him. He spins him so he can face him head-on. "Dean. I don't know what Bobby or Charlie or anyone told you, but you have a choice. You do. Have you ever considered telling the King this?"
Dean tries to shrug before his ribs and shoulders remind him why that is a terrible idea. So instead, he opts to reach up, and blinks real slow. Everything's slow, now. Doesn't matter, though, because Cas looks scared and sad, and he smells like it, too. He can't really wrap his head around
"What's the point of doing all this if the King isn't even here to see it?" Dean sighs one night, slumped in a chair in Charlie's room. As she passes him, she presses a glass of wine into his hand. "Bless you," he mumbles as he takes a drink.
For a moment, hot envy floods through Dean. It takes trust to do something like that, especially in public. Like kneeling before an Alpha in a position of authority, hand-feeding isn't done much anymore. Sometimes old-fashioned couples will do it, or people who like the intimacy it provides, but it's not as big of a trend as it once was. But the trust it takes to do that- sometimes, Dean wishes he could do it.
"Daddy, look at Dean's horse!" Jack said, pointing at Baby. "She's really pretty, and her name is-" he cut himself off, looking troubled. He looked up at Dean and whispered loudly, "What's her name again?"
Victor places his other hand over Dean's. "You just keep doing what you're doing," he says, ignoring Dean's last comments. "The King's watching us, so whatever you did back there- keep doing it."
There's shouting around Dean, but he can't make out any words. It's all jumbled voices and incomprehensible noise, and there's a burning pain in his chest, right by his sternum. He tries to shift, but another flash of pain flares up from his ribs. He's breathing hard and his eyes are barely staying open. Someone rips his helmet off, and then there are hands, someone's holding Dean's face and talking, but he can barely hear anything.
the King who will take Adam's place since "he's so ill, he really can't be expected to ride". Without waiting for an answer, he suggests that one of his servants do it, the one they'd roped into the plan. Castiel agrees, seeming more distracted than usual. Or that's what Raziel says happened- Dean makes a point of not looking up at his King for the whole meal. Plan or no plan, for the last three days he hasn't been able to look Castiel in the eyes.
anyway. And he tries desperately to forget that stupid universe in its entirety. That won't happen to them. He has to keep Cas, can't let himself go down the road future Dean did. He wants to keep him. He
They lead their horses out, and meet up with Raziel in the courtyard, who's getting on a large, grey stallion. He blushes hard when Dean and Victor poke fun at he and Crowley, telling them to shut up and leave it alone (they don't, of course). Michael and Inias come out of the stables a few minutes later, and Dean has to look away as his insecurities resurface. Inias is a pretty Omega, prettier when you can't hear the venom coming out of his mouth. Dean reminds himself that at the moment, Inias is losing, so he must be doing something right. And in the end, it's not about whether or not Inias likes him, it's about whether or not
"Hey, what the hell," Dean says, his voice taking on a flippant air. "You probably tossed him out, too." As soon as it's out of his mouth he realizes his slight Western-esque accent and dialect showing their faces, as they do when he's pissed.
something kings did). "He tells me what he thinks I want to hear most of the time. The others do it too," he waved a hand, "But he does it... significantly more. So do you, and your brother, and anyone who was well-known before my coronation. Lord Michael Shurley. Lady Bradbury."
The first thing Dean notices when he wakes up is his headache. His mouth feels like someone's shoved cotton balls in it and his chest is tight.
So much had changed since Dean was last at court. He'd changed, himself- his face was more wrinkled, his clothes were plainer, and his eyes weren't as bright as they were then. But Whitehall had changed as well. There were more people there, and they whispered in hallways and gave both Sam and Dean considering looks. Five long years had passed, and he and Sam were once more new to this place and these people.
"The king will greet you at dinner," Charlie said, shaking Dean from his thoughts. "Lord Singer wants to ensure that you'll make a good first impression."
"This court is going to be the death of us all!" Victor explodes. "I loved him, and for what? It's not my fault that I fell in love with someone who doesn't love me back. But none of us can do anything- anything! that would endanger the family. The Duke rules us all with an iron fist, and for what? We might be the most powerful family in the country, we might be the favorites of the court, but our happiness will always come second. Love will never be the end goal, it's always ambition. I'm surprised he hasn't married you off already." He gestures bitterly at Charlie.
Raziel and Charlie are back at the couches by the time Dean gets there. Charlie is hiding a smile while Raziel just nods at him as he comes closer.
Michael frowns, but Gabriel cuts in before he can say anything. "Lucifer, let him go. You'll get to speak with His Grace if you're calm about this."
Dean locks gazes with Victor, who shoots him a wink. The Alpha subtly raises his cup to Dean and takes a long drink, finishing it. Dean rolls his eyes and puts his glass down. They're going riding today, and he doesn't want to fall off Baby and embarrass himself because he's drunk at
He looks over to his friends as the chorus begins- Charlie has schooled her expression into polite interest, Victor is hiding a smile, and Raziel looks impassive. It's oddly calming, and Dean keeps his eyes on the three of them so he can't forget the chords from anxiety. Dean makes it through the first verse, closing his eyes and letting muscle memory take over as the familiar chorus hits him for the last time.
," Castiel snarls in Dean's ear, biting at Dean's neck. "All mine, Dean. My good boy. My pretty boy."
"Nope," Benny says. "Been helping out at my grandmother's estate in Huntington. She's getting older now, can't do everything by herself anymore."
"Good boy," he says, and decides to reward Dean for his behavior by grinding his crotch against Dean's. Dean makes a soft, surprised noise and stares up at Castiel as he continues, rolling his hips and delighting in the sounds his human makes.
guy about it, even though nobody knows what this really means except Dean and Gabriel, he tucks the piece of cloth into his chestplate. Gabriel sits back, looking immensely pleased with the inside joke- putting someone's favor in your chestplate before a joust symbolizes carrying that person's favor close to your heart, for luck. It's enough to make Dean want to chuckle, but then Michael, on his horse, is moving, and so Dean has to move too.
"Relax, would you? It's nothing weird or sexual or anything, stop looking at me like that. We're friends, because to be honest, he needs one."
He takes a deep breath when nobody's watching and grabs a random glass of wine from a table. As he drinks (he's going to need another), there's a tap on his shoulder. He plasters on a smile and turns to see Prince Gabriel behind him, wearing possibly the most wicked smirk Dean has ever seen on anybody.
"How do you know you'd have won?" he asked. She just smirked, plucking Dean's cards from his hand and laying them out on the table. The hand was, admittedly, a terrible one, and not something that would have served him well.
," Dean muttered, and Sam shot him a warning glance. Charlie barely reacted, laughing as if Dean had said something funny. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a courtier nearby, clearly eavesdropping.
"What the hell," he mumbles, straightening up and pushing through the throng of confused party-goers. There's a sandy-haired Alpha lounging against the left side of the doorframe, holding an almost-empty bottle of wine. The music cuts off sharply and Sam realizes how quiet everyone really is. For once, the entire court is dead silent.
