“She explained that they are very comfortable for an Omega in your stage of your pregnancy and for this climate. She assured me the material would breathe and that there would be no chafing.”
It was while Sherlock was busying solving another case for the Met. John had been at the clinic all day and decided to drop by to see if he could be of assistance. It was the first time he had seen Lestrade since the case after the rugby game. John was wearing his new favorite outfit. It was a blue and white striped suit tailored to within an inch of it's life. It fit like a fucking glove. He was wearing a white shirt buttoned to show a nice bit of skin and his hair was coiffed and gelled to perfection. John Watson was a walking gay man's wet dream. He had been hit on 4 times today....three just attempting to get to the crime scene. Lestrade turned to greet him and his mouth fell open.
"OK, well good for you."replied the older man," want to meet up this weekend and watch a game and catch up."
The post-birth micro-heats usually happened one to two days after the omega giving birth. They were short and merely helped the omega begin to heal after the ordeal of giving birth. However, they could also be used as a chance for the previously unbonded couple to quickly bond for the sake of their child. Many old fashioned people believed that children did better when be raised in a bonded household. At the very least they would go ahead and publish their 'intent to bond' papers before he started to show. There was no way in hell John Watson was going to be seen waddling around in public carrying Sherlock Holmes' pup without a bond intent....being pregnant and unbonded was bad enough. 'Fuck,' thought John,'there was no way they would be able to hide their relationship now. Great, the press are going to have a field day now!'
"Why are you wearing shiny black tight latex trousers on a Tuesday?"John asked quite proud of himself that he had managed to get the whole sentence out with only a small amount of drool escaping. Nice job Captain he thought to himself. See you are the pillar of strength and stability.
“John! What is it? Is something wrong with the baby,” panted a very out of breath consulting detective as he sprinted into the room, coming to a very sudden stop when he encountered his angry and very naked pregnant mate to be.
Just as suddenly the door swung opened and the tall curly haired sex god formerly known as Sherlock stuck his head in and asked, "Did I get anything wrong?"
"Sherlock, Sherlock...Are you exciting about becoming a dad? How is Dr. Watson feeling? When will you bond?" Shouted the horde of reporters standing just outside of the poor girl's flat. This had been the first time he had been on a case since John had announced his pregnancy on his blog. To be honest Sherlock did not actually think people read John's blog. The throng of reporters and cameras currently flashing in his eyes proved that sometimes even the great Sherlock Holmes is wrong. Sherlock rubbed his temples and tried not to lash out at the crowd. That would be most definitely not good in John's eyes and could possibly upset the pregnant man. And that was something Sherlock Holmes had no intention of doing. His inner Alpha was preening under all of the attention that he had impregnated his future mate. Sherlock was shaken out of his reverie by Lestrade's voice.
It was so nice to see that Gertmond has not changed in the years I had been gone. The last time I had been home was for my Daddy’s funeral. Victor had opted to stay home. In retrospect he was probably fucking some uneducated harlot in our bed. Water under the bridge I suppose. Any hoo my daddy was a good man. He was quiet but would speak up if someone really pissed him off. That someone was usually Suga. God that woman was sent straight from hell.
It all came to a head when I discovered that Miss Butterfly Cassandra Wilson was pregnant. She of course would keep the baby and of course Victor would marry her and they would live happily ever after. Small problem, he is married to a man. Actually not really a problem at all because I found out at the same time that my marriage to Victor was not legal. My stupidity with this man is astounding. I swear to you I really am a smart man. A genius in fact. I can tell things about people just from looking at them. I knew that harlot was up the duff when I saw her coming out of Victor's office. I just didn't see who impregnated her. Funny thing about that. You fuck a man for years you kind of assume they are gay. Nope. Victor Trevor is bisexual. Who knew.
"So you were dreaming you and Sherlock were on a case?"the flannel wearing non nipple pierced female asked tentatively while stealing a glance at the good doctor's banana clad crouch which appeared to be pitching some sort of banana tent.
It was opened to the Tumblr site and the search tag indicated 'Sherlock Holmes and John Watson', John's heart briefly stopped when he realized what he was looking at. It was a post by some random person stating that they had the 'tea' on the couple. The tea was that Sherlock was in fact not a recovering addict but was still an addict. The post went on to state that he had begun using again when he found out that John was pregnant. It also stated that Sherlock was devastated about that news and did not want to be saddled with the Omega when he still hadn't found his 'soulmate'. John was livid. He knew that many considered him to be an old broken former Army surgeon but this was different. Sherlock was committed to his sobriety and to his marriage and life with John. There was no question, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were destined to always be together. This 'truther' bastard was going down. No one makes Sherlock Holmes cry and question his relationship. Not on John's watch.
I did happen to notice that she dropped several boxes of Benadryl into our cart full of fried chicken and Sanka. I did not recall Suga having allergies but perhaps this was a new thing. She and I had settled into a certain routine after her appointment with Dr. Sex. I would watch her like a hawk for any out of the ordinary craziness and she would bitch at me. I was beginning to get a bit stir crazy and horny. This had to be the longest time I had gone without a partnered orgasm since i was 12. I had run through three packs of batteries on old Buck.  I really needed to look into rechargeable batteries for him. Perhaps tonight I could sneak out after Suga went to sleep. The old gal went down at around 8 o’clock...that gave me plenty of time to find someone to take care of my own itch.
"We can't bond until after the pup is born. I want to show everyone that you are mine. That I am yours. That this was not an accident."replied Sherlock shakily unsure of what the older Omega's response would be.
John Watson did not want to be gay. He had seen the abuse thrown at Harry over the years. He saw the look of disappointment in his father's eyes. Nope John Watson would not be gay. He would be normal. He would be a doctor, go to war, find a nice girl and have a family. Instead he met a madman, fell hopelessly in love with the man and the madness. Madman died so that John could be normal. So now John is standing on the edge of 40 living in a semi-detached in the suburbs with a woman he doesn't really know with a child that isn't his.
“Relax old gal. There is enough aqua net in that bee hive to light you up like a roman candle. That hair is not going anywhere.” Though to be honest mine wasn’t going anywhere either. Might need to help that wayward curl to escape before we got to the good doctor.
It is now that I spend the quiet moments of my life contemplating exactly what the fuck has happened. My hold on reality appears to be precarious at best. On good days it is non-existent. The dreams come nightly and the voices stay to play during the day light hours. I have given up normal and now spend the time attempting to convince my captors that I won't end my life. I won't, but I am not to be believed. I tell them it was an accident. I needed the voices to stop. I needed to rest...they smile,they nod and they write in that hideous manila folder.
"Not really. Kind of kills the mood don't you think. Kind of like thinking about Mycroft of something." it was at the mention of his brother's name that Sherlock's python of an appendenge lost all interest in the proceedings which in turn caused the good Dr to gasp and mourn the loss of that meaty morsel he was close to having.
Sherlock needs to get out but his plans are sidelined by a crazy Suga. As always all mistakes are mine and I do not own these lovely characters, am merely playing with them.
Later that evening Sherlock informed his mate to be that they would be traveling to Bora Bora to work a case for Mycroft.
"Sherlock?" John opened his eyes and looked in the direction of his dear friend's voice which was up not straight. Straight ahead was the warm wet bulge which so happened to belong to a certain consulting detective. Fuck! thought John, it is really bad form to attempt to suck your flatmate through his shiny black tight vinyl trousers.
“Well, Sherlock. I am concerned with your mother staying by herself. Are you planning on staying here in Gertmond.”
Now some 20 years later I am back. This time to take care of the  bat shit crazy woman that used to be my mother. I might also be running away from that pesky restraining order. Everyone in Mississippi seemed to be on board with the idea of forgetting about the whole mess if I promised never to set foot in Oxford again. No problemo, I have always wanted to go back to that god forsaken place known as Gertmond Georgia to take care of my ailing mama, said no one ever.
John was beginning to show and had invested in some paternity wear. He made the fatal mistake of allowing that clothes horse he lived with to pick the pieces out. John did not even want to take a guess at the amount they had spent at the Omega store. John would never admit it out loud but it felt good to be fawned over by the Alpha. He enjoyed modeling the outfits in the store and  had  managed to sneak in a surprise for Sherlock which was modeled after they had returned home. Sherlock was very appreciative of the new undergarment and went back the next day to purchase a whole week’s worth of the garments. John was currently sporting a red pair with an embroidered Monday in gold thread.
"Hey Pete leave the boy alone, we don't want to get Doc in trouble with his man." added another player.
Dr. Sex chuckled and I blushed and the heavens smiled upon me as the curl sprang free just as the good doctor glanced my way. Of course the demonic one could not deal with someone else getting attention and decided to butt her big fat nose into the proceedings.
I came downstairs around 5:30 and found Lolamae in the kitchen making supper. Lolamae had worked for my family for as long as I could remember. I used to hang out in the kitchen with her and watch her cook. That woman made the best biscuits.
The boys finally get married.  The quote at the end is taken from Sophie's Vogue article about her dress(which I thought was just about perfect).
“Where,” quickly followed by, “Oh my, that boy is sex on a stick. Honey you better and go grab a piece of that before that other bloke does.”
"I can't believe Lestrade could not solve this one on his own. It was barely a three. Hardly needed to leave the flat. I could have solve this one from our bed."crowed the detective."John?" Sherlock found his blogger curled up on their bed sobbing. His face was red and blotchy and tear stained. He had never seen the doctor so overcome with sadness. "John, look at me. What happened? Are you alright? Is the pup alright?"It was then Sherlock saw John's laptop opened to his blog and quickly he began to read the comments section.
New Young Hottie chuckled low and smirked,"The good doctor is boringly straight and doesn't like to come out and play."
Later that week Sherlock had been invited to a boxing match at the O2 arena by Mycroft. Many people didn't know that while at Cambridge both Sherlock and Mycroft had boxed. He didn't want to leave Will and John home alone but his mate insisted. "Go Sherlock. We will be fine. It will be a nice for you and your brother to get some time together." John of course was right. He and Mycroft had a lovely time even though the fight only lasted two minutes. The next morning the skeptics were on the war path about the brutality of the sport and how Will should be taken from his negligent parents.
"yup"John really wasn't going to go there. Pretty sure it would be not good to go into the details of exactly what he had been planning to do with his vinyl clad sweetie. Nope not good at all.
I had met Victor when I too was a freshman at Ole Miss. I had spent a year traveling with a carnival as a magician's assistant and fuck toy. After a while it became tedious and I enrolled in college. I was a chemistry major and only took Victor's class because it was a requirement. He was lovely. All tanned and slicked back hair with chocolate brown eyes. I was smitten and after a year perfecting my cock sucking skills with the carnival he was smitten as well.
"Have you been looking at the porn on my laptop?"  John asked innocently.You see somewhere in John's reptile brain he had remembered where he had seen the current ensemble his flatmate was sporting right down to the silver nipple rings. John had many a good night with that particular video. He had chosen it for the sole reason that the actor had an uncanny resemblance to his mad flatmate
Brad and John spent the day together. Brad decided that John needed a new look to go with his new sexuality. By the end of the day John had been shorn and waxed and was carrying bags of potions and lotions. He also had managed to purchase a new wardrobe with his new friend's help. John was wearing new slim fit navy trousers and a very fitted navy and white striped polo shirt. A top his head was a jaunty white strawed fedora. There was one thing left to do.
Yes that was true. John had jumped at the chance to go on a case with the consulting detective. He did not ask the particulars of the case trusting that Sherlock knew what he was doing. That was his first mistake of the evening. The second was taking a hard look at exactly what  the good detective had on under his enormous coat. He was wearing shiny black leather looking trousers that were tight. Oh so very tight and oh so very shiny. And wait no they weren't leather exactly maybe more vinyl or perhaps latex. Yes latex...he would say latex. And black and shiny and tight. Yes latex and black and shiny and tight. John felt his mind start on a loop of black shiny latex tightness as he watched the 6 foot something detective prance(yes he is prancing in shiny black tight latex trousers) about the warehouse. John felt a wee bit dizzy and a lot bit confused. Why were latex trousers needed for a Tuesday night Wednesday morning case in an abandoned warehouse.
"Sherlock what happened?" John asked pretending that he had just been lying in the detective's lap minding his own business.
Sherlock had returned home, successfully solving yet another case for those imbeciles. It was good to get out but he had missed the doctor terribly. Not that anyone needed to know that. He could not wait to remove all of his clothing and take his pregnant Omega back to bed.
First of all a big hug to everyone who has read this and left kudos and comments.  This chapter is in reference to Ben and Sophie's trip to Bora Bora and those unfortunate pap photos of the dear couple.
"How to seduce your straight former flatmate and best friend or as I like to call it Knight in Black Vinyl"
"Sherlock love, babe, crumpet. WE NEED THE FUCKING KEYS to the handcuffs!". John really tried not to yell at his consulting lovely but dammit man. He needed that lovely sleeping hiding python to wake the hell up and invade Johnastan's rear alpine region NOW!
By the time the pregnant Omega made it back home his face was tear stained and red from anger. It didn't take long for the consulting detective to solve the mystery of his blogger's distress.
Victor and Miss Butterfly were feeding each other small bits of pound cake dipped in chocolate from the fountain. God I hoped a child had stuck their boogie covered finger into the fountain. I can be petty like that just in case you hadn't figured that out about me yet.
"I think the time has come for her to perhaps live in a place where she can get round the clock care," he said carefully.
The next day I would get the old bat all gussied up for her visit to the doctor. She had been telling me all about her trips to the good doctor. Apparently he was not from these parts. Had a funny accent she said. He had been married to a local girl and lived up in the old Latimer house in the country. Apparently his wife had up and ran off with the handyman they had hired to fix up the ole place. She said his name was Dr. Watson, Dr. John Watson she said. He was a former Army doctor she thought or something like that. He was very kind and always listened to her so she loved him. This Dr. Watson sounded very interesting.
As part of my ongoing therapy I am to write in a journal to express my thoughts and feelings in a more constructive (socially acceptable) way. My therapist is named Amber and that pisses me off  more than the damned journal.  I am curious if it would be considered constructive to write how much her fucking name bothers me.
"oh thank god it's back"John then lunged at his new toy/snack and then abruptly stopped mid air, mouth open, drool descending....
The next morning John had decided to surprise the Alpha with breakfast in bed. He wanted to make Sherlock’s favorite which required a quick trip to the market to replace the eggs the detective had used in one of his recent experiments. John did not want to know what he did with two dozen eggs. The Omega was walking down Baker Street on his way to Tesco when he spied it. There on the front page of The Sun was a picture of him and Sherlock, taken the previous day at the park. Sherlock was waving his hands like a madman explaining to John why it was important that the cake have a cream filling. And not just any cream filling but a filling from a bakery found on the other side of London. Apparently the owner owed Sherlock a favor. John was staring at his lover convinced that everyone in London owed his madman a favor. It was a good picture and John was thinking about calling the paper to request a copy of the image when he saw the accompanying article:
The Gertie house was made of heart of pine which meant no termites would ever bother it but it also meant that the damned thing could burn up in a blink of an eye. When I was a youngster the house was unpainted and had taken on a scary grey tinge one would associate with houses in horror movies.  My grandmother had at some point, painted the homestead white, which certainly perked it up a bit. Unfortunately  heart of pine and paint do not mix, leaving the house in a constant state of peeling.
Sherlock had been working a case for the past week and had finally solved it. He had stumbled home to a crying Will and an exhausted John."Go John. I am here. He will be fine."
John should have known the 'truthers' or 'skeptics' as they were calling themselves these days would stay down. The next morning on the front page of the Daily Mail were the photos of their walk. John didn't remember seeing any photographers around. Surely Sherlock would have said something had he known. The detective had been so enamored with his offspring he had failed to notice the woman in the tree taking pictures of the young family. John had to admit the pictures were adorable and baby's face was hidden so there was no legal action to be had. John logged onto Tumblr to see if he could find out the name of the photographer and try to get the proofs.
Oh dear god Dr John H Watson was going to blow and not in a good toe curling expletive spouting I just had the best orgasm of my life way. Nope. No no no. The shouty doctor was going to lose his shit.
"hmm" he said around the pert nipple in his mouth causing a certain detective to emit a interesting noise a cross between a squeak and a moan. Sherlock would deny any noise had escaped those perfect cupid shaped lips...
"No Sherlock I want you to stay. I WILL BE FINE!" John realized he might have said that last part a bit louder than he had intended if the turned heads and opened mouths were any indication.
“I have come to nurse you back to health. I  brought my white nurse’s outfit, it even has the little hat.” I replied know full well I was winding the old bitty up.
My mother is a lot of things but she is not a liar. She had not exaggerated a bit about Dr. Watson. The man was sex on legs. He had short golden hair that was turning shining silver. His skin was a coppery brown and his body. Oh lordy his body! He had forgone the white doctor’s coat and was wearing a blue button down with the sleeves rolled to the elbows and well fitting khaki pants. Now if my best asset was my ass the good doctor’s was his thighs. They were tight and muscular and my mouth watered at the thought of them wrapped around my head as he….Well enough of that train of thought. My already tight pants were getting a bit tighter. And while I am more of a grower than a shower, I needed to at least shake the man’s hand first.
I met with Dr. Hottie again today, except this time I wasn't alone. There was someone else in the room with us. A patient slouched low in his chair, fingers absently drumming on his thigh. As if he were playing an instrument....piano..no violin, based on the finger placement and callouses on his fingers. interesting. This man, no really a boy wore a scowl on his chiseled face, his grey blue eyes staring into me. It was as if he could read my deepest darkest thoughts. "Good luck with that" I scoffed.
“Don’t go teasin’ an old lady like that. You either put up or shut up.” She laughed batting away my hand.
In the end John went and had a lovely time. The next morning there were photos in the papers of the event. John looked lovely as always. "Bloody hell, why didn't anybody tell me i had baby powder on my suit." Sure enough right near John's crotch there was a smudge of white. Later in day Sherlock saw John slumped over in his chair with his laptop on his lap."What did they say now?'
In the end the wedding went off without a hitch. Although John felt the designer wedding attire was a bit over the top. Sherlock had dragged him to several fashion shows In Paris to see which designer would suit the pregnant Omega best. John was extremely flattered when Modern Omega magazine wanted to do an article about the making of his wedding suit. Sherlock preened about like a goddamned peacock at the thought of his omega being featured in the magazine and everyone knowing the desirable omega was his and his alone.
"Before or after you attempted to fellatio me?" Fuckity fuck fuck well that went well. The good news was that the detective's own member did not seem to mind the intrusion. Although John need notice a wee amount of saliva on the bulge. He wasn't sure what the appropriate protocol was in this instances. Does he wipe it off. Pretend it isn't there and hope it goes away. The problem with that is vinyl is not know for its absorptive properties...Damned those pants are tight and fuck is Sherlock really that big. At this point John's eyes may have begun to roll back in his head. It is hard to say for it was at this moment that John made yet another fateful mistake.
“Oh fuck it,” replied the always eloquent doctor and just went with his gut or in this case his rapidly filling cock and kissed Mr. Sex. He kissed him in the X rated, oh my god this is the best porno ever way. Sherlock quickly figured out what was happening, adjusted his hold on the good doctor’s arse and settled in for the foreseeable future. Brad just stood there and smiled and maybe checked out an arse or two.
John winked at the taxi driver and he slid out of the cab. He thanked him for the offer but politely explained his heart belonged to another. John sprinted up the 17 steps to the flat hoping the consulting detective had decided to join the land of living. As he opened the door to the flat he noticed that while the lump was indeed gone it had apparently decided to leave the flat all together.
The club was just as Sherlock expected. Dark, loud and smelly.  It did not take long for Sherlock to feel a hand against his backside and a strange voice mumbling pornographic phrases into his left ear. All the consulting detective could register was that neither of these things belonged to his John. He turned around and growled at this presumptuous not John. It was then he saw his John.
“That is good to hear. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about your mother’s care.”
"Do you really think so? I need to get rid of this pudge though," John lifted up his shirt to show the offending flesh.
For John. Sherlock hoped he was right. He loved his blogger with all of his heart. He had jumped to protect the man and now he was wearing make-up on his back to conceal the remnants of his time away. He never thought John would ever consider him more than a friend. John was straight. John was married. Now John was gay but was he gay for Sherlock? 'On to battle' thought Sherlock as teetered out of the store and headed out to claim his man.
All was going splendidly which John knew was never a good sign. He had noticed that the comments section of his blog only had positive notes to him and Sherlock. The Omega decided he did not want to know what Sherlock had asked of his brother to make that happen.
The good doctor cleared his throat and got down to business examining Satan’s bitch while I sat in a chair, crossed my legs, thrust out my chest and waited. It was a glorious appointment and by the end Dr. Sex was glistening. His cheeks were pink and if I had a dollar for every time he licked his lips well lets just say I would not  have needed to put that remote control vibrator on layaway. I hustled Suga out of the room so I could make my move.
“Do you think we could go home and maybe continue this with less leather on. I am beginning to sweat in areas I was unaware had sweat glands.”
My cousin Dorothy Jean works for the good doctor and I had not seen her since my daddy’s funeral. She was a large woman with an equally large bust and a tendency to squash my face into the large boobs. I think it was her way of attempting to turn me straight. Obviously it did not work. Today I was prepared. The hair could stand a lot of things but boob squishing was not one of them. I approached her and did the cheek kiss thing. Southern women love this. It makes them appear to be more cultured than they really are.
Dear god kill me now thought Sherlock. ‘For John’, he repeated like a mantra. Sherlock emerged from the dressing room. He was amazed he could still breathe. While his suits and shirts were tailored snug, this went past snug. He was dressed in the tightest pair of leather trousers. It required the pants to be removed and Bo Bo handed him some lubricant to help get the damned things up.’ For John,’ he repeated. On top was a mesh top of some sort. There were no sleeves and the mesh was really transparent. So the consulting detective did not understand the point of actually calling it a shirt. Of course the blasted thing got caught on one of Sherlock’s new nipple rings. He had gotten them pierced a few weeks ago while he was away on a case. They were, of course, for John. They had healed nicely. The detective wobbled slightly as he walked towards Bo Bo. Sherlock had worn heels before but this was too much. He was wearing a pair of knee high black leather boots that laced up the back and added a least a half a foot to his already tall frame. Bo Bo took one look at him and shrieked.
John was frozen in front of his laptop. Sherlock knew that John Watson. That was the soldier John. The John that had killed a man for him the first day they met. This was not good. Sherlock knew better than sneak up on this John. He cleared his throat to get the omega's attention.
God dammit this was how Suga was finally going to destroy me. If I put her sorry ass in a nursing home she would curse me until the end of time.
"The video, porn actors were being murdered and well the only way was to go undercover. They assured me I wouldn't need to do anything with anyone. They said I would be fine on my own..." Yes he was fine on his own John thought very fine. That thing he did with the plug fueled John's wank for a month.
Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson were seen out and about in a London park yesterday. The pair who are rarely seen being affectionate in public  were spotted having a heated discussion. It is rumored that Dr. Watson  is secretly seeing another Alpha and that he is the father of the Omega’s unborn pup.. According to an anonymous source Dr. Watson and the other Alpha are using Mr. Holmes for financial gains and that the consulting detective needs the illusion of a bondmate in order to further his career as a consultant for the Metropolitan Police.
“Somebody took a video on their phone of you and Victor and posted it up on YouTube.”She replied. What? I was an internet sensation and I had no idea. This would not do at all.
Sally and Anderson were both there waiting in the foyer having just witnessed the spectacle  on the sidewalk
“Oh honey I have missed you.” I said and gave her a big ole hug and kiss and just for giggles I grabbed one of her big fat titties.
I rolled up into the yard at 501 Latimer Street. The Gertie house looked as oppressive as when I had left it. It had been built in 1866 by Dr. Gertie after the war. The good doctor had been a Captain in the Confederacy. The house was built for his young bride and first cousin. They quickly filled the house with nine screaming youngins, 4 boys and 4 girls and one hermaphrodite. I suppose since she was a girl on the outside and a boy on the inside she was considered a daughter. My grandmother was the baby in the family. My great uncle Charley was a hunchback but the only time anybody paid that any attention was when he would have his Klan robe on. Everybody in town knew which one was Charley.
"Umm...good, I think. His highness is still inside tormenting the staff. How have you been?" John just giggled at Lestrade's attempt to make eye contact while at the same time not make eye contact."You look good."
I went up to the back of the house and let myself in with the key that was under the rock. The back porch had been enclosed when I was a baby. It had been screened in when the kitchen was added at some point. My daddy insisted that it be enclosed after I was born. He said there was no way he wanted his child to catch pneumonia attempting to get to the kitchen for food.
John had fell in with the lads seamlessly. It felt good to run around and get dirty. All of the exercise had certainly helped with his midlife pudge. it was all good. John had told his mad flatmate that under no circumstance was he to interrupt his rugby practices with anything less than an 8. So far he had behaved himself. John liked to think that it was how he looked in his rather short and tight white shorts.
"Hmm. Why", asked the Omega. Marriage was not a common occurrence among bonded pairs. It was seen more as a beta institution.
Fortunately I had made a visit to the seamstress before I left Oxford. Since I was once again single, I decided that I needed to make sure my suits emphasized my best attributes or my ass. I have a fabulous ass. It is what you might refer to as a ‘bubble butt’. It is round and perky like two ripe peaches. I made sure to have my pants tailored extra snug in that region. I also pulled out my extra slim dress shirts. Now I know most southern gentleman wear bow ties with their seersucker but I do not. I prefer to wear a simple cotton white shirt unbuttoned just enough to scandalize the church ladies and tempt the menfolk.
"Mr. Holmes that is not why you are here!"He sputtered."This was an opportunity for you and Dr. Watson to get to know on another."
Mr. Sherlock Holmes(A) and Dr. John H Watson(O) are engaged to be married. The couple who are expecting their first pup in the spring plan to marry shortly and will bond after the birth. It is expected to be a small family affair.
The stranger was thin, dangerously thing..Ah drug addict then....hmm something else....ah yes of course, suicide attempt, accidental. Oh a kindred soul. Oh Dr. Hottie match making are you? He is a wee bit young but young I can work with. New Young Hottie blinked and sat up. Hmm not as young as first thought. This could get good. It had been way too long....damned shame Dr. Hottie was a no. I did love a good threesome and my god new Young Hottie had a pair of lips that would look sinful wrapped around my cock.
“Oh my God, Sherlock Holmes, you are so going to get that fine arse licked tonight.” Sherlock turned a peculiar shade of red and attempted to scurry back into the safety of the dressing room.
“Love, I am pretty sure I won’t get burnt in that particular location. And sunscreen is not a substitution for lube.”John moaned, for his dutiful Alpha had given up on the application of said cream and now was simply moving his sunscreen covered digits in and out of his pregnant mate to be’s engorged hole. Both were moaning now and John was quite grateful to be wearing the thong. He was ecstatic that the detective was sporting a pair of board shorts with tiny skulls on them instead of his usual suits. A pair of tented board shorts, John smirked to himself.
“Yes, your haircut and mannerism. You stand at attention even though you are unaware you are doing it. Your hair is cut precisely and very well I might add. Otto always can be counted on to give a superb cut(Otto is the only decent barber in a 100 mile radius, he also gives spectacular head). Also,we sent a lot of boys out of Ft. Stewart so you would have been familiar with the area. We don't get many Brits in these parts and very few folks outside of Jeff Davis county have even heard of this hell hole so you would have had to have known someone from Gertmond and well we don't travel much so….Army. And the only two areas we have sent troops to in the last 15 years were Afghanistan and Iraq”
I should put a disclaimer on this chapter that the names have been changed to protect the innocent. Many of this was taken from my childhood of visiting my grandmother in the budding hell hole known as Hazlehurst GA. My family owned the oldest house in town which was built by Dr. Latimer who really was a Captain in the Confederacy. The house was miserable and it was true we couldn't sleep with the heat on and there were chamber pots in every bedroom. My grandmother was the youngest and one of her sister's was a hermaphrodite and her brother was a Klansman with a humpback.
"Sherlock what the fuck? Where did it go?Make it come back." John realized he a being a bit not good but for christ's the man was huge and well dammit he had waited long enough to have that between his cheeks.
Sherlock gathered his Omega up in his arms and closed the laptop. He held his doctor until the Omega fell asleep.Quietly Sherlock left their bedroom to make the phone call.
"Fuckity fuck fuck"The good doctor was thwarted in his attempt to yet again take the oversized detective in his mouth. This time it was not  by vinyl not latex trousers but by handcuffs. This was getting ridiculous. How hard can it be for two overly aroused individuals to get off. Apparently when you are Sherlock and John....very!
John did not know what Mr. Cheekbones problem was. In his heart he was afraid that he had misread the entire situation and that perhaps Sherlock was indeed straight. And after John finally quit giggling over that theory he thought perhaps the consulting detective simply wasn't into John. That was a sobering thought and one that the good doctor did not want to dwell on. Nope, not going there. He was an attractive ex Army doctor who had just come out of the closet. He had a fantastic arse and a pair of buttery soft leather booty shorts. It was time to put those bad boys to use. Besides he really really needed to get laid.
Sherlock finally succumbed to lung cancer shortly after their 50th wedding anniversary. John followed shortly after.
The exam went as well as one would think. Suga howled like a cat in heat and swore that there were bugs. She also might have suggested that she was not crazy. I now know that her hearing has not been affected by the bugs as her hand managed to find my right cheek when she heard my giggle at the not crazy comment.  I was in hell and not in the fun one where everyone is running around naked and having copious amounts of sex. Yes that is what I picture hell to look like. Lots of orgies and booze and drugs and a fine time had by all. A fine time was not being had by all. Well I suppose Suga might be having a good time after the good doctor shot her up with something and admitted her to the hospital.
Dr. Hottie interrupted our tet-a-tet to announce that New Young Hottie, I mean Sherlock and I were going to be our own little group. Ooh cozy.
"Donovan! Enough!" Shouted Lestrade rubbing his eyes. He was in no mood for this. It already took eight texts and four phone calls to get Sherlock to come out without his blogger.
I apologize for any errors. Trying to finish this so I can work on a fic with one of the boys in leather booty shorts. I might have a 'leather' problem!
Well, it was fun until he told me that he did not date his patients. Date? What? Uh no I just wanted a quick and dirty fuck. It has been awhile doc. Not a lot of demand for injured suicidal ex Army doctors you know what I mean. Shit! There went the fun. He asked me about the noise and the voices.He asked if they were still a problem for me. I refrained from my usual comments. Still holding out hope for the fuck.
"Hmmm"The consulting detective was kind of enough to stop his prancing which enabled the good doctor to collect some of his wits about him.
It was after his eyes adjusted that John saw him. The god in leather trousers.  The only person he had ever seen with such long legs had been Sherlock. John quickly pushed that thought away to fully concentrate on the sex god in leather in front of him. The sex god with thigh high leather boots and raven black curls. The sex god with cheekbones you could cut glass on, the sex god looking straight at him.
"Of course you do.....you always mattered I just couldn't....couldn't stop the noise ...the voices....the confusion"That was the part I should have kept quiet for that was
"I want them to go away. I want you to hunt down these animals and make sure they do not ever distress the father of my child. Do I make myself clear, brother dear."
“Seriously, Sherlock, what are you doin’ home. This is no place for you.” I always loved how Lolamae never called me ‘Locky’.
" I appreciate your concern Dr. Watson. I am going to go home and think about it. Perhaps we could discuss this further tomorrow."
I was right by the end there was screaming and crying but surprisingly enough it was not Amber. Damned! Amber did pull me aside and told me that I didn't need to always be a dick. Oh but I do I told her. She then went babbling on about defense mechanisms and letting people in. About the reason I felt the need to try to kill myself. I DIDN'T FUCKING TRY TO KILL MYSELF. IT WAS A FUCKING ACCIDENT! I JUST WANTED THE FUCKING NOISE TO STOP! God i hate Amber and her fucking pink kittens. Somebody kill me now since I am apparently shit at it.
"Let's go then. Later boys, duty calls."John yelled as he left the pub. Sherlock waited until they had got out onto the pavement before asking the million dollar question.
Saturday was John's first day off in over a week and he was looking forward to his morning out with Brad and even more to his evening out. He told the lump on the sofa that he was going to run errands and would be back after lunch. He really hoped the lump was his moody flatmate and not just a lump of blankets. It was so hard to tell since he would have gotten the same response from blankets, nothing. That was not anything new. Sherlock frequently ignored John and then got all indignant when he could not find his blogger to procure whatever he was too lazy to get.
It was two weeks later before Sherlock went out on another case for Lestrade. John had persuaded him to give the Di another chance. Mostly it was the fact that the Alpha was running him crazy. The pregnant Omega could not move without running into the possessive git. John was beginning to show a bit more and Sherlock's favorite thing in the world was to rub his nose along his bump and scent him. The consulting detective could not keep his greedy paws off of it. The Alpha had also become extremely randy and John was convinced that if it was possible, Sherlock would stay buried in him constantly. The Omega enjoyed the attention from his mate but the time had come for him to shower and actually put on clothes and perhaps even update his blog. He had not updated it since he posted the announcement of their pending marriage.
Brad had suggested that John wear a very tight and very small black v neck t shirt with his very tight and very small shorts. He also suggested that the former soldier polish up his army boots. He had said that every boy loves a soldier. John had also rimmed his baby blues with a dark kohl eyeliner which made them pop, according to Brad.
“Honey that was quite the show with Victor in the Golden Corral. I had no idea you were so good with a knife. I need to keep that in mind when Bobby gets out of hand.” Bobby was DJ’s husband. They had been together since grammar school and she had him so whipped and even I couldn’t ever imagine him getting out of hand.
"Oh dear god"John had created a monster. But it had been awhile since they had played and Mrs. Hudson had been clamoring to watch the little one."yes we can get some rope."
“He would say, ‘leave that boy alone, he aint hurtin’ nobody and it aint anybody’s business who he fucks.” My daddy would never say the word, ‘fuck’ but he would have told her to leave me alone.
"Actually I just got tired of pretending that wasn't married to a lying bitch."John gathered up his few belongings, texted his best friend and left his former life.
“Private, no one will see,”mumbled the detective from the now fully aroused Omega’s arse where he had buried his face.
We pulled up to the good doctor's and I helped Suga out. She looked good. I had picked out a pair of cream slacks and a black silk blouse. We had accented the outfit with a scarf and I had rooted around in her jewelry box and found a broach for her to wear. Her blue eyes were lined in jet black and I had used a soft mauve for her lips. Her hair had been teased to within an inch of its life and set with half a can of Aqua Net. She looked like my mama instead of some trailer park inbred.
There were six of us today. Four females and 2 blokes. Overall everyone was well behaved for a Monday. I have high hopes that by Friday someone will be screaming and crying. God I hope it's Amber. We talked about why we thought we were here. I am sure it had nothing to do with us trying to end our oh so rewarding and happy lives. This will not end well for all involved.
I am not really happy with this chapter but i need to quit rewriting it and just move one. There is no excuse why no one is naked yet in this fic!
This whole mess came to a head when I tracked the happy lovebirds to the local Golden Corral. Now I have personally never set foot into this particular establishment. I have heard rumors about what small children stick into the chocolate fountain. I also tend to avoid anything with the words 'all you can eat' unless it involves men with bare asses.
"We are done here Lestrade. I believe you can solve this one on your own."quickly responded the consulting detective. Sherlock pulled up his collar and drew his coat closer to his body and quickly left the scene. There was no way he was going to let those imbeciles see how Donovan's words had affected him. They did not understand. John loved him and he loved John. The good doctor saw beyond his prickly exterior and loved all of him. He wanted to bond with the high functioning sociopath. He wanted to have pups with him, Sherlock Holmes. The Alpha needed to return home to his Omega. He needed to scent him, to lay with him, and just be with his pregnant mate to be.
"I want you to fuck me." He replied while stroking his quickly hardening length. It was at this point Dr. Hottie had spit out his coffee and was coughing uncontrollably. As a medical professional I really should have helped but I was too busy laughing my ass off.
John was so done. It had been a month since the incident in the Pub. Mr. Married to my work had not said or done anything out of the ordinary. John wasn't sure what the problem was. Did the consulting detective not have a working 'gaydar'. My god even Lestrade had figured it out.
I told him about growing up, about wanting to be normal, about observing people and their stupid insidious behaviors. Another smile and nod. I had begun to suspect that he really didn't fuck his patients and yet for some reason I continued my verbal vomiting. It was horrible. So sentimental. I was appalled at my behavior. This was unacceptable. Finally I pulled myself together and told him to FUCK OFF. I was done being his afternoon entertainment. He smiled, nodded and left.
“Yes Sherlock he is.”John knew when he had been beat.”….let’s get you home, you sentimental sap and you can touch and look…”
Supper was a simple affair, just Suga and me in the formal dining room. Lolamae had fried up some chicken and made rice and gravy. We had field peas and  ripe tomatoes. The tea was cold and sweet. She had made  pound cake for dessert which we had with coffee in the parlor.
“Oh no Mr. Cheekbones. You are staying out of that closet. It is time. For John, remember. It is time that you be the best damned gay man you can be.”
“That was bloody brilliant!” Brilliant! Dr. Sex called me brilliant. Oh dear lord, it was going to be difficult to keep one’s hands to one’s self if he kept that up.
John was confused or was it aroused. At this point he really had no fucking clue.  All he knew was that he was in an abandoned warehouse at 3 fucking oclock in the morning with his barmy best friend. His barmy best friend who at this moment was trying to figure out how to get them out of the abandoned warehouse. So it was a normal Tuesday night or was it Wednesday morning for the good Dr. Never mind that he really should be in bed next to his lovely wife. Never mind that he had to go to the clinic in about 5 hours. Nope it was all good. John H Watson was all good. He was sitting on a pile of boxes in a damp warehouse in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and it was all good. Well it was all good until a certain consulting detective decided to remove his beloved coat. And then it all went to hell in a hand basket.
John arrived home to Mary singing to her daughter in the kitchen. She looked up at her husband and a slight smirk came across her face.
John wasn’t sure why he had thought it was a good idea to go to the Greg’s 30th year anniversary with the Yard party. Yes Greg was their friend and they owed so much to him. But...well John just wasn’t feeling ‘pretty’. He knew it was petty but dammit he felt fat. He was beginning to show a bit. Not enough to show but enough that his current suit was a bit snug in the tummy area. Sherlock pretended not to notice but John knew better. John put his jacket on and hoped to God everyone would just think he was getting fat.
“Right there in front of you,” smiled Sherlock a little too smugly if John was being honest with him self.
They had just finished up their weekly game and were celebrating at the local. John felt the consulting detective way before he saw him. Sherlock had a way of consuming all of the air in a room and this was no different. He also happens to be sex on a stick and there is no way in hell he would not capture the attention of 12 gay males working on their third round.
"Always something"Sherlock relaxed into John and began to card his fingers through the good doctors hair.
"Fine, Dr. Watson is recently invalided from Afghanistan. He is an Army doctor obviously. He has trust issues, obviously. An alcoholic brother. He attempted suicide but not really. He just wanted to quiet his mind. Something I do understand. "
So the idea for this chapter was the Evening Standard Awards when there were some allegations that Sophie had thrown a fit on the red carpet.
It had been a quiet couple of weeks for the boys of Baker Street. John had encouraged Sherlock to take a few non-dangerous cases to get him out and about. He had actually joined the Alpha on one that according to Sherlock was a 3 at a minimum. It felt good to be out running through London with his madman by his side.
“Yeah I know, that what happens when you best gay friend up and leaves you to the all you can eat Sunday buffet.” D J had been my favorite gal pal back in high school. We used to spend hours doing makeup and hair and talking about boys.
“Sherlock, get your arse in here RIGHT NOW!”, shouted a very angry and teeny tiny aroused Captain Watson.
Nor would he admit to his brother the great sense of envy he felt for the younger man. Mycroft had never once in his life yearned for a mate and a pup but at that very moment he felt that perhaps in the end alone does not protect you.
They had been venturing outside of the flat less and less as John’s pregnancy progress. He was now in his second trimester and the ickiness of the previous three months was behind him. He was feeling good and quite randy which was more than fine with his future bond mate. Sherlock was a most demonstrative lover inside of Baker Street. They both had agreed that public displays of affection left them feeling a bit off….they were after all British men!
“Not really. I have just noticed her memory not being as sharp and she complains of itching and quite honestly I am starting to think it is psychosomatic. I have given her steroids and nothing seems to work. In the last two weeks she went to the emergency room twice with this phantom itching. I was worried about her in that big house by herself. I am glad you are here for her.” What the everliving fuck? Suga has dipped her toe into the pool of crazy. I am not sure I am equipped to deal with an actual crazy Suga. This was not good, even if Dr. Sex was looking at me with those baby blues. Suga and I were going to have a chat!
'Drugs usually,'I answered,"uppers mostly but I must say going to war and getting shot at did a mighty fine job of shutting the fuckers up for awhile." He smiled and nodded.
Today we had group. A good time was had by all. Amber was in pink today. Of course she was. It was a fucking rainy Monday and she works in a loony bin. So pink it is. I would love to talk to her about this rather unfortunate wardrobe choice. Perhaps I could analyse her and find out exactly why in god's name she decided to wear a pink shirt with fucking kittens on it. Honest to god kittens. WTF?  We are already suicidal. Do we really need more to egg us on.
“Love, shouldn't we move this inside our hut,”asked John before all sense of reason left him along with his tiny red thong.
John knew what he had to do. Fortunately when you run with the world's only consulting detective you learn a few tricks and meet a few people. People who know more about the workings of social media and web addresses and IPs and how to get the bastards that made his mate cry. In the end, web sites were shut down and anonymous posters were outed thanks to the tireless workings of their fan base. In the end they opted not to proceed with legal action mostly because John's water had broken.
"Yes that one. For the record there was no dragging of anyone. I believe you met me at your door moments after I texted you.'
The boys had decided to take a stroll around Regent’s park and perhaps feed the ducks. It was a beautiful day. They had been indoors for the morning planning their upcoming wedding. Mummy had come over to fuss over John and aggravate her youngest son. Mrs. Hudson had made biscuits. All in all it was a lovely morning. They were wandering through the park discussing some of the options they still needed to decide upon. The biggest sticking point had been the colors of the serviettes. John had wanted lilac. Sherlock wanted a deep emerald blue to match the Omega’s eyes. They were walking side by side shoulders barely touching except when they would inevitably bump into each other. By the end of their walk all remaining decisions had been made and of course the serviettes would be the emerald blue.
"No what?" John then noticed that he was not alone in the being done party." Shit, shit, shitty shit shit!" So close and yet so fucking far. The python of his dream had deflated and appeared to be hiding. To be fair satin can be a bit chilly in the winter months. Focus Watson, you invaded Afghanastan. How hard can it be to invade Holmestan. John chuckled to himself, like he was going to be the one invading anything. Oh Johnny sometimes you are too funny. Ok one more time. Here we go.
"The freak impregnates the Doctor and what, now it is front page news. Speaking of which, where is the good doctor? Did he finally come to his senses. Off to take care of his mistake" Sneered Sally to the group inside.
I did however end up in the anger management therapy and now I am heading home to a special kind of hell.
"John? John are you alright" asked a very concerned consulting detective. John had at first found Sherlock's concern for his well being lovely but now, well let's just say there was very little John Watson found lovely. He felt bloated and nauseous and why the fuck was it so hot. He had no desire for sex and he actually growled at Sherlock when he tried to initiate some contact.
"Sherlock, wait….Donovan apologize! NOW!"Sherlock heard Lestrade yell as he threw up his hand for a cab.
It all started with a pair of shorts. John supposed they were shorts. They were so very small they could have been underpants. They were leather and black and very very soft. Like butter. They had called to him from the shop window. The mannequin was wearing them with black laced up boots and a tiny black billed hat. No shirt. John was mesmerized. He stopped and stared and then he did the unthinkable.
"Want to play some more since this idiot has managed to get himself banged up right at the beginning of the season."
Unfortunately this chapter is based on the ugliness that is playing out on Tumblr and the Sophie Hunter tags.
Shit just got real for the horny doctor and his consulting porn star. Dr. Watson was so done. Really he thought this is what finally does me in. Not the death faking, the sham baby, the killer wife, the shooting. Nope a pair of questionable quality handcuffs and satin sheets.Nope. Not gonna happen. This was not his fucking fault.
"I am assuming since we are about to take our friendship to a more physical level that you would want to talk about your pending infidelity"
"They went with the boots."It was at this statement that the good doctor's brain went officially offline. He quickly closed his eyes somewhere deep inside him hoping that he would open them and be back in his safe warm bed with his warm wife. Safe he knew Mary wasn't. That ship had sailed when she tried to kill his best friend. The best friend who currently had resumed his prancing.
The resort was private, Mycroft Holmes had made sure of that when his baby brother had called about his distressed mate to be. Mycroft liked John a great deal and he would do anything to make sure his brother and his Omega were happy. However, private resorts are not necessarily known for being high paying and there is always someone who can be depended upon to do the wrong thing. In this case it was a young boy of about 17, a beta who needed money for his family. His alpha father had run out on the family after his mother had failed to produce an Alpha heir. Mycroft felt for the lad but there were limits and unfortunately he had reached them with the British Government. One does not take photos of a pornographic nature of Mycrofts’ baby brother and intended bond mate. Even the photos of John in the red thong with Sherlock rubbing sunscreen on his distended belly was a bit much for Mycroft. He would never allow these photos to see the light of day.
“Oof,” grunted John from position atop the consulting detective who was now sprawled on the dance floor.
"what?" It was at this point things got a bit weird. Weirder than dancing bananas. We are talking what the fuck just happened. John realized that while he was in a bed in questionable sleep attire his bed partner was not the python hung vinyl clad nipple pierced male he was expecting. Oh no. It was a flannel wearing enormously pregnant blond non nipple pierced female.
"Ladies and Gentlemen I would like to remind you that this is a crime scene and Mr. Holmes is working." Lestrade shouted to the reporters while herding Sherlock into the flat.
Today Sherlock was wearing black trousers that looked like they had been painted on and an equally tight dark green button front shirt that looked like he had forgotten to button most of. I was in loose pajama pants and a old t shirt. I would be lying if I hadn't picked out the shirt on purpose. The shirt was from when I played rugby as a lad. It too looked liked it was painted on.  Sherlock began humming and shifted slightly in his chair, legs opening to an obscene position. Now the fun was to begin. Dr. Hottie cleared his throat in obvious discomfort.
John was going to kill the Alpha. No, strike that John was positive he was going to kill that mother fucking Alpha. He shouldn't have been surprised. I mean really when was the last time Sherlock offered to pack. John knew there wasn't really a case but he quite frankly didn't care. The resort was gorgeous and private. And he should have known better. Mr. Sherlock Holmes doesn't just randomly do something out of the goodness of his heart. Nope. Not gonna happen. Which is how Dr. John Watson got to this point. A grown man standing around starkers looking into his supposedly packed suitcase only to find, red. Lots and lots of red fabric. He couldn't really call them clothes. That would imply that these pieces of fabric were intended to actually cover something.
"Yes, sure." On the way back to the flat John was immensely glad he had let Sherlock get a car from Mycroft, a car that just happened to have ice cold A/C. He was just about to text his Alpha his gratitude when he got a text from him.
“That is clothing. They are thongs,” replied his consulting detective now smiling way too smugly for John’s taste and also looking more than a wee bit aroused.
"221B Baker St,"Sherlock quickly jumped in the cab leaving Lestrade and the reporters standing on the sidewalk wondering just what the hell had happened.
“A thong, don’t be obtuse John it doesn't suit you. The saleswoman at the Omega boutique said it would be perfect when I rang her about appropriate attire for this trip. I explained where we were off to and volia.”
It was in the parlor I noticed just how frail Suga looked. Her blue eyes once bright and clear were clouded. Her face was drawn. She looked like hell. This will not do. My mother might be the spawn of Satan but I will not have her going about town looking like she lives in a trailer park and watches reality TV while eating cheetos.  The pull on polyester pants would be burnt. It was a good thing I came home. I had no idea things had gotten so bad.
"God-dammit what the hell were you thinking?"Obviously not I thought to myself. At least I hoped it was to myself. Even in my weakened state I knew that would be a bit not good.
"So guys this is Sherlock Holmes, my partner. Sherlock, the guys."John motioned to the half drunk men who were quickly becoming interested in the proceedings.
"Really never knew.You should have told me. Could have been messy business with the gloves and all..."
In the end we managed to find Suga several outfits that were not manufactured out of a petroleum product. She looked very nice and after a quick trip to Eddie’s pharmacy for some cosmetics she looked almost back to her normal satanic self. No actually she did look quite lovely, until she opened her mouth. Oh well, baby steps I suppose.
John could not breathe. How dare they question anything about his relationship with Sherlock. Another Alpha!! That is a joke...never mind that there isn't a lot of demand for a wounded ex Army Omega Dr. Oh yes thought John darkly I have them lined up around the block waiting for their chance to mount me.
John Watson managed to regain some of his brain function shortly after he got his 6 foot something porn darling pretty much naked. The boots had remained on because well the good doctor had some kinks. Actually the good doctor had a shit load of kinks but as of right now he was focused on just the one. The detective had been demeshed and the vinyl not latex pants had been removed. That had been a bitch. Apparently Sherlock had been a wee bit nervous about how the whole evening was going to go down and had begun to perspire in his black shiny tight vinyl pants. John had not noticed due to the materials' non absorbing nature. There was a brief suggestion that involved scissors that was shot down in John's opinion a bit prematurely. He had been a surgeon for god's sake. His hands did not shake that much and did Sherlock really think he would in any way harm that mouth watering specimen between the detective's legs. In the end a brief tough tug brought the whole shebang down and it was quite fortunate that the consulting detective/former porn star had remembered to keep up his waxing regime. Now that he had the man as naked as he wanted him the good fun could begin.
"Sherlock,"he said placing his oh so warm hand on my bare arm,"we need to talk about your mother." Now that is a statement to cause permanent erectile dysfunction.
We had been there for at least 4 hours and it was now approaching 1 in the morning. I had not moisturized nor conditioned and lets just say I was looking like I had been ridden hard and put away wet. The good doctor caught up with me outside of Suga's room as I was planning my escape.
At the time it seemed like a good idea to get married on Valentine's Day. Now it seemed cliched and John was sure Sherlock was starting to regret letting his mother talk him into it.
The Holmes are a prominent family in Gertmond. Or rather they would be if any of them had stuck around. My father was a Holmes. My mother is a Gertie. Why yes just like the town name. Yall see where I am going with this. Both families prominent. Children married. Had blue eyed little boy and called him Locky. Doesn’t make a bit of sense. My mama’s name is Eugenia Weaver Gertie but everyone has always called her ‘Suga’ ‘cause she was always so sweet. I shit you not. My daddy’s name was Emment Sherlock Holmes. He was called ‘Yank’. I haven’t the foggiest idea why. He had been called that for so long even he had forgotten how it all started. So Suga and Yank had Locky.  I really suppose I should have provided barf bags on this adventure. I should also probably let you know that while my mama is named after something sweet, no one has ever in my life called me sweet. Also in case you haven’t figured it out yet….I am light in my loafers, queer as a three dollar bill, a fudge packer. Gay.
“I don’t want you to get burnt.” pleaded the consulting detective continuing his mission of covering his beloved omega in a coconut smelling paste. John felt like a giant cream pie.
Aqua Net is a hairspray. It comes in a can and is highly flammable. It also guarantees your hair will not move!
“Goddammit Sherlock move your hand,” whispered John when his soon to be mate’s hand had wandered to his small bump.
"Because he asked me to." And that pretty much summed up Dr John H Watson's life. He would do anything Sherlock Holmes asked him to. John also knew he was a bit gay for the mad genius, even if he didn't have a python in his pants. John was still pretty sure he did. I mean those pants he wears are really tight. Yes,  of course John looked. He was after all a bit gay.
Oh dear god why is there an earthquake in my bed when I am just trying to get off with my best mate. John then registered that it was not an earthquake but rather the good doctor was being shaken to within an inch of his life.....
God why do they always have to deal with decomposing bodies when it is bloody hot. How 'bout January? Hmm....here is an idea serial killers....kill in the winter months. It will take the Met longer to find the bodies and just think of how many you can get before they catch on. Jesus John needed to sit down. God it was hot. When did it get so hot? Christ it is hot.
Amber was not amused with yesterday's post. She muttered something about the sanctity of life or some other bullshit. It was a joke people. A little dark humor to brighten our dreary Monday! Anyway I have been moved from group. Some nonsense about not being quite ready to share in a constructive manner. Basically I don't play well with others. I also have a new therapist, a man, a very handsome man. This could be fun. Oh Boy!
"No Sherlock you stay I will be fine on my own. I will just go back to Baker Street and get a cuppa and put my feet up."There was no way John wanted expectant father Sherlock Holmes leaving a crime scene. Nope no thank you. Not feeling a bored and broody Sherlock today.
"John I am sure that whatever we need to talk about can wait until one or prefably both of us gets off."
"Sherlock, you haven’t had a case since we got the results. You need this." I need this thought John. I need to get home, get these fucking hot clothes off and it in a cool bath without being poked and prodded....
John tried very hard to saunter seductively in his army boots but he was in a fucking hurry to get to his honey in leather before the pumped up beefcake snatched him up. Fortunately, Mr. Sex in leather was still quite prickly on Not Johns touching him and beefcake was sent off with a seething deduction about a rather small appendage. John smiled and thought ‘that’s my boy’. Unfortunately the good doctor had begun to pick up quite a bit of speed in his quest to Mr. Sex and well, things did not go down exactly how John had pictured, in his quite frankly pornographic mind. Let’s just say that if you mix a short determined Army doctor in leather shorts with a rather tall consulting detective perched on very high stiletto boots, bad things can happen if you are not careful.
"yup."Yeah so not going to happen Mary. There is good danger and really bad and sucky and you could really die kind of danger. His wife wasn't the good kind. John knew that. He also knew in his heart of hearts that his dream wasn't just a dream. It was a cry for help. A cry to shed his banana pjs and don some black vinyl and pierce some nipples and to get a bit gay. It was time.
I really should have seen this mess coming. Victor had been distant with me for months now. I just wrote it off to the new semester starting and the pressure with a new University President. I had no idea that the real reason was Butterfly Cassandra Wilson. Sometimes I really hate living in the South. I mean I thought Locky was bad but Butterfly. Miss Wilson was from some hog waller in southern Mississippi. She was the first one in her family to go to college. I suspect that Victor and her mama were the same age but I could be wrong. Butterfly was in Victor's freshman composition class. I never understood why Victor continued to teach freshman classes. Apparently it was not the classes but the freshman in the classes.
John approached the situation with military precision. He needed to capture the good detective and hopefully lure him into those delectable shorts. God, he needed a good shag. It had been months since he had seen any action and years since he had had a nice fat cock up his arse. John called up his new bestie Brad to find out the best places to dance and possibly get shagged. Brad was ecstatic to help the good doctor and the pair spent Saturday morning getting all prettied up for their evening .
"About what" the detective opened his sea blue orbs to see what exactly had gotten into his new lover. He was mostly naked and handcuffed and aroused. Sherlock did not understand what there was exactly they needed to discuss. Ah the wife. He had forgotten all about John's wife in the excitement to leave the warehouse and get John as naked as quickly as possible. Sherlock is many things but he is not stupid. There was no way in hell he was going to have a talk with a Dr. John H Watson while they were naked and handcuffed in bed.
Sherlock is wearing a seersucker suit which is a type of suit common in the south. Seersucker is a cotton material and in our dear boy's case is Carolina blue with a white stripe. The caddy is a 1966 Cadillac  convertible coupe de ville in candy  apple red with white sidewalls and white leather interior.
I should have been flattered the way Dr. Sex eye fucked me but I was simply in no mood. I had not had time to freshen up and quite frankly the curls were a mess. Suga was rambling 'bout something totally unimportant. I vaguely heard the good doctor ask me some questions.
John carefully opened his eyes, this time steadying himself against the trousers. It just so happened that at this very moment the good detective decided to add a pirouette to his prancing routine and John found himself eyeballs to vinyl encased arse. And what an arse it was. It was like looking at two ripe vinyl covered peaches. They looked so plum and lush and juicy and Captain John H Watson found quite a bit more drool making its way out of his opened mouth. His hand had somehow wandered over to the front of his rather tight jeans and began to stroke the quickly hardening member as he began to think how lovely it would be to rut against the vinyl covered peaches. To nestle between the soft vinyl covered mounds. A sound might have escaped his mouth at this point the good doctor had lost all control of well everything. And here is where John third mistake of the evening came in. He looked down at the shoes that matched the shiny black tight vinyl trousers...He supposed they were shoes or perhaps more boot like he supposed. They were made of the same shiny black vinyl material which would explain why the detective thought they matched. They stopped mid thigh like pirate boots which John thought was fitting since Sherlock always wanted to be a pirate. There were laces up the back of the boots and the heels added a good half a foot to the already giraffe sized detective. John's hand that had moments before been caressing his rapidly hardening cock dropped by his side. And there might have been a groan heard. Hard to say because it was at this precise moment that the good doctor made his fourth mistake of the evening.
I hadn't practiced much in the past years but it is amazing what rage and a hand full of steak knives can do for a man's confidence. In the end I had Victor pinned against the wall under the picture of the Confederate flag, his body surrounded by knives. Not once did I hit the man. I was impressed. I know yall would have been impressed if you had seen me. Victor and Miss Butterfly were not impressed. The local police were not either. The only reason I was not immediately arrested and sent to rot in the local was my relationship with the Police Chief. I helped him solve his messy crimes and I kept my mouth shut about how he was the real father of his sister's child.
