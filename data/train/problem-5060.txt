"Jarvis, where's Tony?" Emma said thoughtfully as she chewed on her pencil, staring at her science notes. She'd been studying practically the entire weekend, trying to get ready for a test the following Wednesday. It's not that she didn't remember stuff, her memory was startlingly firm on some points. It was just that she didn't understand everything, like what the hell Amperes were, and why Volts were a thing. Bruce was at a conference, so she only had one genius to talk to, and sadly enough the less patient one.
"Too late for that," she said, mostly to herself, as the Hulk turned back around, and shiny green eyes met hers. The alarm went off, but not the one Emma was used to, the Avengers Assemble alarm. This was something else, something different.
"Dr. Pym is on his way," Jarvis relayed. Bruce tapped his fingers against the desk he was sitting at.
"Well, nothing, I suppose. Or take care of kids. Or pay someone to take care of the kids? I don't actually remember a lot from the Real Housewives I've seen," Emma said, wrinkling her nose as Bucky nudged her into the elevator and pressed the button for the common room floor, so he could get the keys to his bike. "Jarvis, what's the actual definition of a trophy husband?"
"No. You need to quit threatening my creations, Nat," Tony said, putting his hands on his hips, looking a little annoyed. Natasha raised an eyebrow at him threateningly, and Tony hid behind Steve.
"Bruce is cooling off somewhere in Asia," she said and grabbed another dress, a black, long sleeved one. "Clint's coming home from a mission tonight, last time Thor babysat alone, there was The Incident, and then there's you. Doing nothing but breathing and waiting for the next mission." Bucky groaned.
Finally the food was done, and Emma piled up a pretty big plate and set it in front of Bruce, making him roll his eyes exasperatedly. He picked up the fork when Emma raised her eyebrows threateningly though, and began eating.
"Yes, dear god, please tell me you brought a spider-book for Peter," he said a little desperately. The other scientist laughed, and rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses.
"Is it the major bloodloss? I've been told that the accompanying paleness brings out my eyes," Emma said, picking up a lip-balm in the shape of a cupcake and trying to pry it open.
"We made him," Hank pointed out, eyebrows furrowing."Why would he have to determine his own gender?"
"Yes, yes, I got Peter, take your time," Bruce said, appearing from behind the newspaper to wave him off. The moment Steve opened the doors to the stairs, there was a burst of wind, and Pietro appeared, holding a bag of Doritos and eating straight from it.
"I have a register over the full spectrum of color visible to the human eye," Vision relayed a little sheepishly.
"Everything, I guess. Just... Where we're going." He made a face. "God, doll, you're making me sound like a mushy rom com." Darcy smirked.
"Hey, Jay, if I die, tell Bucky I love him," Emma slurred, the lights going a little fuzzy around her field of vision.
"Toasty, in comparison to New York," Clint said with a wiggle of his eyebrows, and opened the file between them. "Undercover?"
"Well, I mean, you guys give a lot to charity, right? And help people who get out of jail get jobs? I know Tony works hard to make sure all SI-employees get a living wage and that he's working towards making sure every SI-building has like green energy and stuff. That's about as ethical as you can get while being that crazy rich," she pointed out. "Also while I wouldn't say I'm spoiled, I do enjoy the luxury of living in the tower that Tony's money built, and rebuilt post-Battle of New York, so I don't think I'm far enough away from the issue to talk about it without sounding way biased."
legal documents to make sure you stay in the Avengers, no matter what happens to us. Okay? Even if something happens, which it
Since Wanda and Pietro had come to stay with them, Clint had, as per usual, taken them in under his wing like they were defenseless kittens, even when they were anything but. After about two months of encouraging and silent trust-building, Wanda and Pietro would come to him with whatever they needed, whether it be a reassuring pep-talk or encouragement.
Something fluttered in his stomach, something warm and soft that terrified him. Despite that, he smiled. "I love you too."
"Wanda, probably. Bucky, without a doubt. Usually, I'd go with Tony, but Tony loves you, so he's not on that list for once," Emma listed on her fingers, with Vision's arms still wrapped around her. "Sam, definitely, he's gonna be freaked out but then accept you but still be wary of you, and mom doesn't trust you and Pietro doesn't like you, and Bruce could use all the hugs he can get, so you're greenlighted there-"
The doors slid open, and he walked directly into the ominously silent kitchen. Toys were scattered over the tiled floor, and there was a stray sock underneath the kitchen island. Crayons were all over the kitchen table, along with paper, and there were a few toy cars and action figures in strange places around the room, and a blanket halfway through the doorway leading to the living room.
Emma sucked in a gasp of air at the pain of huge hands impacting with her shoulders, and she definitely felt the whole floor scrape up underneath them, the loud noise like a whole forest of trees falling. She looked up into the Hulk's green eyes, and decided that she could see the flicker of blue in his eyes. Alright. Close, then. Just needed something to make him snap out of it.
"'S not so bad. You can pull it off, babe," she snickered. "You want to know where we're going? Okay, um. Well, I thought we'd stay together for a couple years more, at least, if that sounds good to you?"
Instead, when he tried to run, Emma grabbed him and slammed him down onto the kitchen floor with a thud and yelled "Tell me where my cat socks are or you have less than ten seconds to live!"
"Aunt Tasha. And Dada!" Peter replied, then happily telling Darcy about the billions of cupcakes that now hid in his fridge.
"I can't have kids, Darcy. Hydra didn't want me to have kids, so I can't," he confessed silently. Her determined frown relaxed into a relieved smile.
"So where's my patient? Up and walking already?" Helen asked, yawning a little. Clint didn't catch the last bit, but he caught the most important part, and tossed a thumb in the direction of the common room.
"Elevators don't excercise you, doll!" came Bucky's call from the living room, and she smirked at the sound of his voice.
"I thought the Winter Soldier would be more... Bad guy," she said quietly, more of a question than a statement. Peter was confused.
Vision did as they were told, and Bruce did some bending of joints, feeling of backmuscles, and stared in bafflement as Vision held a very amused Emma above their head.
Natasha stared at Tony, and he stepped back on sheer instinct. They stood like that for about fifteen seconds of pure silence, and then Tony cleared his throat.
"Obviously. Y'know, I think if I could pierce myself, I'd want like a nipple piercing," she said as she grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the store.
"He learns, then?" Natasha asked, raising a cool eyebrow at Tony. "How did that go for you, last time? Creating an android?"
"Just trying to get some information, relax kiddo!" the man said, rummaging in his bag for something. Emma tensed again, but Damian just sighed.
There was the sound of metal connecting with soft tissue, and Emma looked up at the two on the sparring mats. Bucky was grinning, and Steve was wheezing. He was probably the soft tissue the metal hand had connected with, and while Steve was on his ass on the floor, Bucky was almost crouched over in silent laughter, while Steve turned an alarming shade of red.
"Is your dada's AI sassing me?" Bucky said to Peter, who tilted his head in confusion. "Nevermind. Spaghetti and tomato sauce sound good?"
"C'mon, we barely ever go out! I love snuggling with you and watching shows, but we need to go outside sometimes." Damian made a frustrated noise.
"Back already?" he asked from the kitchen table, where he was reading To Kill A Mockingbird. He liked to flaunt it in front of Clint and get him lookin' at 'im with the kind of squint killers used on their tagets. So, really, he was getting a kick out of making one of his friends want to kill him. Bucky had weird hobbies.
"I miss papa an' dada," he sniffed. Oh. Well, that made sense. Tiny kid gets left without it's parents, gets distressed. Obviously. Tony had been gone on businesstrips and Steve on missions, but none of them had ever happened at the same time. Now Peter didn't have his papa or his dada, and he missed them. Right. How to fix that, then.
"Coming right up, my dear," Clint agreed, stealing one more kiss before he went back into the kitchen.
"Go with your sisters, go, get out of here," he sighed loudly. "Don't be a drama queen, and grab a jacket on your way out. No taking one of the cars that lets the top down! If any of you get a cold, it's your own fault, and I'm not going to run around cooking hot chicken noodle soup!"
Bucky's past was still splotchy to him, and his memory sketchy at best, but he did remember a few things. He remembered the Howling Commandos, and Peggy and Howard Stark. He remembered Coney Island and stick-sickly Steve's mussed hair and small wheezing breaths. He remembered his little sister and he remembered the way she pouted and the way he looked with short hair. He remembered how much he fucking hated homophobes.
," she declared in Sokovian. Vision had noticed that the rate of which the siblings spoke in Sokovian had increased recently due to them spending more time alone with each other. The amount of tests they were subjected to had decreased, as had the general population of people in the tower. Vision had also noticed that they were rarely noticed when they stayed in the same room as the other occupants, which was good. It made their observations easier.
"Yeah, Kate's still here," came Kate's voice, as she appeared in the doorway. "Clint's forcing me to socialize."
Bucky walked into the kitchen and decided that talking to Peter might also be a good idea, keep him awake now that he was up.
"Yup. Squirt is all tuckered out," Clint alerted him quietly as he walked into the living room with Peter in his arms. Natasha slid down onto the chair in front of him, and tilted her head at him like she was about to interrogate him.
"Hi Lucky," he laughed tiredly, petting the happy golden retriever. He looked up at Vision, and exhaled. "Wow. Hi again. How are your neurological pathways developing?"
"Come on, возлюбленная, you see our point. Would you let us go into the world less than twelve hours after we'd come back from a dangerous misison where we got very hurt?"
"Got a mean right hook, too. We sparred a few days ago, and she got me in the thigh. It's a surprisingly big bruise for such a little person," Kate said, rubbing at her leg, where the bruise undoubtedly was.
"Sure," Bucky said, not entirely sure he was doing this right. "Jarvis, video call Stark and Stevie on the tablet for us, yeah?"
It struck her that during her nearing one and a half years with the Avengers, she had never actually encountered the Hulk. She'd seen Bruce turn into the Hulk, yeah, and she'd ran past him once or twice in a battlefield, but she'd never been there for the crashing. She knew Tony usually got through to the Hulk before anyone else did, was the one who usually gathered Bruce up and brought him back to the tower after a fight, and if it wasn't him, it was Thor. Emma never encountered Bruce after he hulked out and before he'd gotten some sleep and some food and tea.
"Not really. 'S not like I have a lot else going on. Darcy's busy today anyways, and Steve's obviously off to get some."
The doors to the lab slid apart again, and Lucky bolted off the couch to say hello to Bruce, who laughed and dropped his over-the-shoulder bag on the floor.
There were curves rising and falling, a couple of numbers staying pretty much the same, and a few blue lines that looked like static on a graph that just kept going.
"Stark?" Natasha said calmly. Tony stopped and turned around a little, to meet Natasha's green eyes. Immediately he regretted that decision. Her eyes were blazing with cold, deadly fury. "The next time you put Emma in danger like that, I'm holding you physically responsible."
As for how I'm writing Vision, I'm literally floundering in the dark. I've read some short comics with him, but one was majorly screwed up with him having a wife and kids that looked like him and got murdered or something, so I really don't know what I'm doing. I'm mostly playing around with the robot, please be patient with me!
"Emma, get away from him, we've got this!" came Clint's holler, but Emma just stared into the green of Hulk's eyes, waiting.
"Let me," she insisted, and he huffed, but let her tie his shoes up. "How about a bouncer, then? That doesn't demand a college degree, and 's not like you're not used to late nights, plus if you don't know you, your face is terrifying at times!"
"Pssh. No. Yes. No?" Darcy said, and Bucky chuckled, putting Victoria back down, getting up, and moving over to envelop Darcy in a hug, sweeping her hair over her shoulder and dropping a kiss on her forehead.
"Damian's butler was a medic in some war! I don't know which one, but if my leg breaks down, which it won't because it's a good leg, I have a qualified medic who can check it out."
"I wouldn't dream of it," Damian said, steering her towards the exit. If the hand around her waist was partly there to support her weight, well, it wasn't like Emma had to call him out on it.
Darcy's sweet mouth dropped open a little, before she pursed her lips, a determined set to her eyebrows. "It could
"Matt's made sure that we've made a very long list of all the people who we know would make better guardians than Anne, and could take care of you, if something happened to us. You are never going back to her, Emma. I promise," Clint said fiercely, and he felt Emma nod against his chest.
"Do not make spill my coffee all over you!" Clint shouted as Lucky barked and jumped up to lick it off.
Some other Avengers had been in the room when they'd gone under. They'd find them. However, Emma wasn't sure when Bruce would be able to move again. From the way he looked like every move hurt, it might be a little while.
"What's his name?" Bucky asked suspiciously, crossing his arms and leaning back on the couch-armrest. The android blinked it's creepy-looking eyes, and Natasha stared at it thoughtfully.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm good, what about you?" Steve asked worriedly, cupping the back of his husband's head to check for bumps.
When Peter didn't answer, he crouched in front of the workbench, tilting his head in question. Peter's lower lip trembled.
"Jesus, you should be happy I'm very confident in my marriage," Tony said, but there was a struck look in his eyes. "Where are you guys going?"
"Let us think about it a little more, возлюбленная, alright?" she said, turning back to Emma. "You're not supposed to meet them until one, right? Let us think about it. If you can move without hurting, and I will not tolerate a lie that you're fine, then we'll consider it."
"What you can get, is out of my face," Damian snapped. "I have no comment on whatever you want to hear."
"Then trust me when I say love conquers all, and that you'll have kids if you want them," she declared.
"Stir-fry. Considering making bread later," Bucky stated, smacking Sam's hand away from the pot he was stirring. The two immediately got into a hushed argument, with a lot of elbowing involved.
So... again... I apologize for the crazy update-space. Um, essentially: I graduated, spent the summer travelling with family and stressing about my life choices, and then made the stressful life choice of beginning uni, and now, here I am, a few months into uni and... yeah. It's been hectic and my muses have been assholes. I think today is the first time in a while that I've managed to write anything of substance in a while, which is nice on one hand, because yay writing again! but also my god, has it been this long????
"You're no fun, Jay," Emma said as she and Wanda found a part of the workshop that was entirely dark, except for the lights coming in from the huge windows facing New York City. The little area was only lit up by a dim blue glow coming from a box the size of a casket. "Holy crap. What's that?"
They dispersed around ten, Emma and Bucky following Steve and Peter to the park outside. The two super-soldiers wouldn't let her chase Peter around, on account of her leg, but Steve gave her a piggyback ride, and Bucky gave Peter a piggyback ride when he became jealous. They played around until Peter got hungry, and then made their way back to the tower for lunch.
"Wanna consider what you're doing right at this moment?" Clint suggested, and Emma looked down at where she had Pietro pinned. Her lips pursed in a cute frown. "That's what I thought. I want to hear only apologies and sock-coordinates in the next minute, or you're both grounded."
"I swear to god, this place gets weirder every single time I visit," Betty said, seemingly to herself.
"Are you hungry, Pete?" Peter nodded and was sat down on the floor, but he immediately scrambled over to the stepping stool, getting up on the counter. Steve didn't mention it, but from the surprised look, it wasn't something he'd seen Peter do before. Alright, Bucky was now apparently leaving his damn
He ate with them, because Peter asked him to, and then he packed his shit, and he left the tower, taking in lungfuls of air as he stepped outside the building. Bucky sprinted home, unlocking his appartment with quick, practiced movements, and closed the door after him. When Natasha texted him Darcy's number an hour after he'd unpacked, he wasn't even surprised she knew. Natasha always knew.
He sucked in a deep breath. "I just don't want you to wake up in ten years and realize being with me was the worst mistake of your life."
"The chocolate to cover ratio is different. It makes the mini ones taste sweeter, and people generally like it when things are sweeter," Natasha said as Helen tugged away the dressing around Emma's wound and frowned at it thoughtfully.
"Pushed that a little too hard, huh?" Bruce asked, and Clint shrugged, shoveling his food into his face.
"Well, then it was just me and Bruce. I got Pym and Cho involved this time. And Janet for the general shape and size of him, which is why our buddy here looks like an actual GQ-model. According to her, my Iron Man suits are too 'blocky'. Which is obviously a lie, because they're awesome." Tony pulled the cord out of Vision's shoulder and smiled at the android. "Welcome to the world, Vision. Jay, help connect him to the internet."
"He looks at what Emma does when she's studying now, tosses his hands in the air, and curses in Sokovian. I don't think he's quite ready yet," Natasha said.
With a minor flick of his finger, the rubberband disappeared into the large office-area the field agents shared when they weren't out on a mission and had to do paperwork. When Natasha raised an unimpressed eyebrow at him, Clint held a finger up in the universal "wait for it" gesture.
"There's this girl who keeps making snide comments about Bruce and the Hulk, and I'm ready to sock her in the jaw, one-two," she grunted, demonstrating two swings in the air as she walked on bare feet towards him.
She brought her fingertips to her chest and rubbed in a circle, in a please. "I know, but I wanna hang out with him more! And I wanna pet his dog!"
Peter's mac and cheese was done pretty fast, and Bruce fed him as Steve helped Bucky chop vegetables for snacks and a stir-fry. As soon as the little boy was finished with his food, his head began drooping, and Steve swept in again, taking him into the living room for his nap.
"No, shh," Emma said, firmly pushing him down into his chair again. "Have you had anything to eat today?"
"Can't be worse than getting bow-burns, jackass," Sharon said cheerfully. "I can't wait for someone to boot your ass out of here."
Bucky didn't even realize that hours had passed and Darcy was still video chatting them, until Jarvis told him that it was time for a snack. Peter's tiny stomach growled, and Bucky was running on caffeeine and determination and years of practice.
. Nothing like that," he muttered, leaning back against the bike. Emma swung her legs around so they were facing the same way. "I think I'm just not... used to being in the same place for this long."
"Override Peter's statement and tell me where the hell he is!" Bucky demanded, nearly slamming his hand through a wall. If he lost Steve and Stark's kid, he was fucked. Natasha would kill him and skin him, and Barton would shoot his half dead corpse with acid arrows. And that was
"No matter what it says, I'm sure Darcy will knock some sense into them, or yell very heatedly. No offence Bucky, but she can be downright menacing sometimes," Bruce said, glancing over at Betty's phone.
"Jay, show me the readouts?" Bruce said, still looking a little awed. "Tony, have you called Hank and Helen?"
Emma could barely hear anything other than that, and lifted her head slightly, peeking over the arm of the couch as the swoosh of a door opening filled her ears.
"Fine," he said and ended the call. Natasha was sliding something that looked like a thigh holster over her athletic leg, and Bucky raised his eyebrows. "Really?"
"Hey babe, 's Emma home safe?" Darcy asked without looking up. Bucky took a moment just to drink the image of her, comfortable in their apartment and looking like a goddamn dream.
"So... You babysit often?" Darcy asked, a glint in her eye that made Bucky's heart go back to hammering in his chest.
"What! No way," she squawked as she pulled the dress off the hanger. "I don't like, go off and buy everything I want without being stopped! I'd feel way too guilty to do that, also I don't actually need anything usually."
"Wait what? Why do you need a training room?" Emma asked curiously, now pulling her headphones out of her ears and whistling for Lucky as the two men and the android moved out of the room. She followed them into the elevator, wrapping herself around Bruce. "I'm glad you're home."
"Yes, yes, I did. Don't worry. It's in my luggage. I met Natasha in the common room, she told me she'd take it to my floor,"
"Hey, do you think you'd ever get pierced?" Emma asked. Damian's eyes roamed over the shop and it's glittery, purple insides.
"Yeah, well, you got yourself shot when we told you to not do the thing that got you shot. So yeah, that one's on you. However, did we tell you to patch up your own bullet wounds?" Clint cajoled. Pietro frowned.
Emma could hear Natasha mutter a Russian curseword into the pillow her face was smooshed into. "возлюбленная, I'm so close to getting out of bed and getting you myself. This close," she said, displaying about an inch of space between two fingers.
"Darcy!" Tony exclaimed, Peter burrowing into his fathers neck with his hand pressing against the arc reactor.
It was ridiculous, that even after so long, she could still give him butterflies, but Clint was yet again reminded that Natasha wasn't just any woman when their eyes met, green on grey.
When the spaghetti was almost done, he felt a tap tap on his leg, and looked down to find Peter smiling up at him.
"No, but they've met during their business-dealings, and he was contacted with an invitation when the casino was finished. We intercepted it, and planned to decline on his part, and instead ask him to graciously accept Valentina Ivanovna Dorokhova, and her trusty partner Dmitri Mikhailovich Volotskoi instead. Russell agreed to do so, but we'd already created the identities before we sent it off, since he'd probably look you up."
"What?" Bucky grunted as he scrubbed a hand over his tired face. He hadn't been sleeping all that well lately. HYDRA related business. Not very pleasant dreams, but he supposed he deserved it for all that he'd done.
"Seriously, what is up with you today? You're all tense, Jarvis," Emma protested. "Hit the lights." Jarvis didn't follow her command, so she assumed he was still being pissy. "Fine. Wanda? Glow-stick, please."
"Yeah, sometimes I'll see white walls and it'll feel like I'm back at Ralph's place. Like I said, recovery is a bitch, no matter what got you on your knees in the first place," Emma said, kicking her legs a little, like a much younger child. "You're in a pretty good headspace nowadays, though. Got a bike, time to heal, a steady girlfriend, et cetera."
"Did it occur to you that maybe I'm not as available as you are?" Natasha asked in a distracted manner as she pulled a deep red, Jessica Rabbit-esque dress out of the closet and held it to her chest as she looked in the mirror. He ripped the black dress from his face, throwing it onto the couch effortlessly.
"What? We have very weird family dynamics and I'm trying to introduce them gently. This is me being very gentle. Pietro and Wanda got the gentle headstart, and Darcy and Jane, why shouldn't Vision get it?"
The door to the shared field-agent-office opened, and the tension in the room immediately rose a few notches. Coulson stepped into the room, a file underneath his arm. A mission. Clint and Natasha made quick eyecontact, and so did Sharon with her partner, over her shoulder.
"I won't be able to skip out of here until tomorrow. I still have a presentation later today, and I can't get out of London until then."
"I can read him," Wanda said, sounding a little shocked and a little dreamy, placing her hand on the casket-box. She pressed it to the glass, and her lips twitched into a smile. "He's dreaming."
"Tony! Just the guy I was looking for," she said with a grin. "You little minx." Tony grinned and winked at her, and Bucky rolled his eyes.
"Not that that's much of an achievement," Kate muttered mutinously under her breath as she went to sit behind the kitchen island. Sam burst out laughing.
"I'm hungry," he said as he crawled down from the counter with the million muffins. "My hands are sticky." As if to demonstrate just how sticky, he slapped a hand to the stepping stool, and it made a wet noise.
"You can't cook to save your life, Katie-Kate. Let the pros take over," he scoffed, swiping half of his coffee in one sip, and then sniffing the pancake batter. "This is... Not good. Please dear god, step away from the kitchenware before you hurt yourself."
"Yeah. That too," he said, surprising even himself with how soft his words were, and had the urge to ruffle Peter's hair. He didn't, but still got a huge grin and Peter throwing himself around his neck. Bucky was stunned for a full two seconds, and it was hard surprising the Winter Soldier. Then again.
"Well, you can't use team in both senses of the word, because that will be confusing," Kate reasoned. "Saying 'Let's go team!' leads us to think you're talking only Avengers."
"Don't talk with food in your mouth, come on," Bucky said, and noticed how his Brooklyn lilt got just that much stronger when he gave Peter a reprimanding look. Peter pouted a little and swallowed before he apologized. "Good hot dogs?"
"Well, I'd say she's pretty much fully healed. Normally, you'd want to do some physical therapy, but your powers seem to want you to be able to hit the ground running," the doctor finally said, a thoughtful look on her face.
"Functioning at full capacity," Vision replied, and it's voice was taking on a different tone now, again.
"Do we count as team if we're not on the team?" Darcy asked him from where she was leaning against Thor's shoulder, clutching her coffee cup to her chest like it was a life-sustaining elixir.
"Oh. Have you been out in polite company with no pants today? Rauncy," she added, stepping further into the room and tossing her tablet on the couch. She stepped out of her sensible heels and let her hair out of it's clip, feeling like she was shedding skin like a snake.
Dummy let go of the ball, and Emma tossed it deep into the pits of the workshop. Immediately, the bots zoomed after it, disappearing out of sight. Emma laughed,
So yeah, I'm sorry if the chapter is choppy or anything, but I've been writing this in stops and starts since May, so hopefully the next chap will run smoother!
"I'm gonna stop you right goddamn there. I don't need you to apologize to me for Tony. Firstly, he's a grown ass man, he can make his own apologies, and secondly, he pissed my partner off to a level I haven't seen in years. So you apologizing to me isn't going to do anything to fix anything," Clint said, hands in the air. Steve sighed.
"That's also a lie, because I could yell at your sorry ass to turn around until I was blue in the face and you'd still go barrelling forward," Steve shot back, cuffing Bucky upside the head with familiar ease as he went by him towards the coffee machine, and getting a solid thwack on the leg in return. Peter looked over at Bucky over his father's shoulder, and giggled.
His cooing continued, but this time, instead of the cat, he was smoothing his hand down her back and cupping her face, dropping kisses a little bit of anywhere close by. He turned her around so that Darcy's back was against his chest, and kept crooning in surprisingly soothing Russian, and Darcy just melted against him.
As Emma launched into explaining the backstory behind the show (Merlin this time, something new and historical and magical, in Emma's opinion), Clint walked back around the couch. He dropped a kiss on the top of Natasha's head, his heart fluttering ridiculously when Natasha tipped her head back for a real kiss.
This was the umpteenth time they were discussing this, and Bucky wasn't even one step closer to winning.
Wanda chortled, leaning forward a little, indicating interest. "You learned a language to make friends?"
"Alright," Clint agreed gently as she went back to dozing on the couch, "I think we could all use some sleep."
"How was the park? Did'ya have fun?" he asked as he walked over to the cabinet with the bread in it.
"Seeing as you are constantly surrounded by rich people, I didn't think you minded money too much," he stated as she tossed her shirt off and began untying her shoes.
She leaned her chin against her knee. "Would it make you feel better if I say that I don't want kids?"
Bucky got up, internally panicking, because shit, what if he started crying again? Twice in a day made Bucky feel like maybe he wasn't so good at this. And he kinda wasn't, but at least if he kept the crying to a minimum, he'd feel better telling Steve that his son was alive.
"We leave on Tuesday, meet-up with Coulson tomorrow. Tony's gonna fix some things for me, and then we're in the clear. We'll be gone for about a week, probably," Clint explained.
"Hey, watch it! People can get struck in the face with that thing!" Sam exclaimed, hands raised suspiciously over his head. Sam hadn't really gotten comfortable with Wanda since she'd shown up, and she wasn't doing anything to ease the way. Peter thought that Uncle Sammy nearly getting hit in the head with flying car keys was pretty funny, so he giggled from the chair with the booster seat he was sitting in by the kitchen table.
"Dumbass body," she said, loud and clear enough for Clint to register, and he pressed a kiss to her forehead, now frowning a little.
"Are you hot?" he asked, worriedly, and Bucky blanked out a moment. His parents had passed on their caring nature on him.
"There you go, buddy. It'll be lunch soon, and then we'll eat to our hearts' content. Don't you worry, little man," she hummed soothingly. There was the jangle of a dog collar, and Lucky came out of the common room.
"I'd like for you to haul your ass over here so that me and Steve can get going. It's a long drive, wouldn't want the old man to be driving in the dark."
"Right, and anyway, Emma's self-sufficent, you'll all eat together anyways, and Happy has promised to drive Emma to the places she needs to go if nobody else can take her. She does have a test tomorrow, and a book she needs to have finished by the end of the week, but other than that, you just need to know where she is," Clint shrugged, sitting back down at the table to eat. Bruce sighed.
"You guys are so overprotective," she complained as Bucky began walking towards the living room. Clint took the pan off the hotplate and hurried after them, grabbing Victoria off the counter as he went.
"I have various credit cards in my father's name on my person. I believe I also have Grayson's. I could buy you anything you want, including a dress your father would disapprove of." Emma grinned.
"Sure is," she agreed sweetly, and Bruce blinked a couple of times before his eyes widened in horror.
," he muttered silently in Russian, without even opening his eyes, the third time she came in, as Natasha laid a hand on Emma's ribcage. It was comforting to hear her breathe, but it was even more reassuring when she could feel it.
Sharon Carter was decked out in a SHIELD hoodie, hair up in a ponytail and looking decidedly done with a bored Clint's shit.
"I know how the Hulk can get when you can't control the change. Okay? I don't blame you," he said, and he did mean it. Clint realized rationally that Bruce had less control over the Hulk's actions when he hadn't controlled the change, knew that Bruce couldn't just snap out of it. That wasn't how things worked. Didn't mean Clint wasn't mad. He was angry his kid was hurt, he was angry Tony had even let her stay in the room, was angry Bruce hadn't gone straight to bed when he got home, was angry Emma was even out of bed. Angry, angry, angry, but that wouldn't change anything right now. "I don't blame you. Lie down here, Tasha's coming with some provisions."
"I'm fine. Oh, yeah, speaking of! Have you guys decided yet? I mean, I'm doing great! I can walk and run without feeling pain!" Emma said, which wasn't at all a lie. Sometimes there was a stab of pain but that was okay, that didn't matter. It would probably pass soon anyway.
Emma raised her eyebrows. He really was bothered by this. When he reached for the shoe-laces, she dropped down in front of him and waved his hands away. If he was this agitated, he was only going to snap them in half, and that always pissed him off even more.
," Natasha signed at Clint, who nodded and helped Bruce to his feet. Without hesitation, Natasha scooped Emma up in a bridal carry, being careful to let the injured leg rest rather than be pressed up against her. "Pietro, go call Helen. Ask her in a medical professional capacity what we can do."
"And how far into that circle would I have to go?" Natasha asked a little carefully. She'd been working with Shield for a very long time, and they rarely asked her to use her hard-earned seduction skills. If this Angus Russell was as high up as Coulson suggested, however, she was sure Shield would want to pull out all the stops to catch him.
"Looking forward to having your old dads' out of the house?" Tony asked with a smile at Peter as he sat up in the couch, his chin resting on the back of it. Peter made a muffled 'i dunno' noise into Bucky's stomach, and Bucky chuckled.
"Thought we'd check out Vision's... Other abilities now that you're here," Tony said, giving Bruce a side-eye, and Bruce's eyes widened a little behind his glasses.
At one am, the doors opened, and Emma, wearing headphones and holding her stuffed giraffe, entered the room. She crawled up on the couch, her dog trotting after her, and Tony didn't even really question it. Barnes' insomnia wasn't as severe anymore, probably from regular serotonin-bombs, courtesy of one Darcy Lewis, but Emma's was still a real beast.
"I'd say that's a good plan," Emma agreed as the android looked down at it's feet and hands with a concentrated look on it's face.
"Look who's here," Steve said, and Tony and Peter looked up at the same time, head snapping over to them with slight interest. The only difference was that Peter perked up when he saw who it was, and Tony squinted.
The next morning was calmer, easier, because Peter was in his bed and still sleepy enough to be carried downstairs and be set down in the couch with a blanket and bright tv-shows. He ate cereal and another apple, Peter had a weird love for apples, and Bucky didn't eat at all, because he felt like shit at the moment from the lack of sleep and nothing could change that.
Natasha was sitting on the coffee table, smiling at Emma, who was making a wholehearted argument for mini-M&M's being better than real M&M's, one hand waving in the air for emphasis and the other in Victoria's fur.
"Hey," Emma said sharply from where she was perched on Tony's desk chair. All adults looked up at her in confusion. "Vision hasn't decided their gender yet."
"Whoah, where's the fire, sweetheart?" Clint asked, turning around in his seat, and instead of replying, Emma pointed an accusing finger Pietro's way. While he was usually very quick, this time he set the plate he was holding relatively carefully down onto the counter, which cost him the precious seconds it would've taken to escape.
-sentient. She means, like, AI-sentient," Tony clarified. Wanda and Vision locked eyes, and she let out a breath.
"Not a lot of either, actually," Betty pointed out. Bruce frowned, and Emma put a hand on his shoulder.
About halfway through the movie, Peter made his move, and snaked his way into Bucky's lap, stunning the former assassin and HYDRA agent. Best way to throw him off: place a child that he had no intention to harm in his custody for over an hour. Peter's head dropped back against his chest, and he noticed just how fucking
tuchus, Mister I'm-gonna-fight-it-with-my-bare-hands-and-a-shield-the-size-of-a-dinner-plate," Bucky scoffed at him, eyes narrowed playfully.
"Mhm," Steve hummed, his voice low and intimate, and Tony raised his eyebrows at him. Steve raised his eyebrows back and moved towards the coffee machine to make his husband a cup.
"Vision's gender is as of yet undecided, dad," Emma said decisively as they made their way over to the elevator.
"That far, huh?" Emma mused. "Well, I don't see you itching much at all about anything but Darcy nowadays. I know you've met the rest of her family and it wasn't that awful. Are they pressuring you guys or something?"
Now that she tried to explore what else hurt besides her head and back, she felt her thigh burn with pain. She'd definitely had much much worse before, so she didn't pay it as much mind as she could've. Everything tingled with what Emma associated with her body healing; the odd sensation of flesh and muscle-fibers and occasionally bone desperately trying to knit itself back together.
"Agent Barton, Agent Romanoff?" Coulson said calmly into the room, and Clint whooped, hopping out of his chair.
"I do," Damian said, a light flush high on his cheekbones. "I just... Like it better when we're not around people."
"This is Bucky!" Peter said happily, and patted Bucky's face. Thank god Barton wasn't around, that gesture and Bucky's lack of arm breaking for it would have him laughing his ass off. Darcy's eyes widened.
Yet here she was now, trying desperately to ignore the pain in her thigh and her back as Bruce gathered himself. Yes, Bruce was the one who had taught her practically all of the breathing excercises she knew, and yeah she knew he needed those too for a reason, but she'd never actually made the connection that hulking out and then turning back into Banner would take such a toll on him that he needed to learn how to handle the pain like that.
"That's a nice morning-greeting," came Bucky's voice from the elevator. Everyone's heads turned to watch him come out carrying Emma on his back. She was wrapped up in Thor's old cape, her hair up in an asgardian braid, but looked very determined and not in pain.
"Uh-oh," Emma said almost to herself, and Tony let out an incredulous shout as he shoved Bruce out of the way of the laser beam.
"Is that Wanda's top?" he asked incredulously as he stared at the low-cut, tight, burgundy shirt Emma was wearing.
Finally, the glass doors parted, and Bucky walked straight in, not expecting the tiny sniffling boy sitting on the floor next to Dummy, underneath his father's workbench. He looked so sad that Bucky's hands, that were supposed to be resting on his hips with anger because the kid had
"Too old? You're neeever too old for Lego. Tony loves Lego, Bucky loves Lego, Kate loves Lego, and I love Lego, and you don't have to love Lego but I know you're going to, because I know you. Also, Legos are the
Emma shrugged, her eyes glinting with seriousness. "Worked pretty good with the head, I guess I thought it'd translate to other body parts."
"Dames, Damian, hey, maybe slow down, Mr. Rocket-rollerblades," Emma exclaimed, yelping when she put too much weight on her still apparently not entirely healed leg, and her thigh muscles screamed in agony. She dropped Damian's hand and nearly collapsed on the spot. Luckily, he was quick on the uptake, and caught her.
"You keep stealing my hoodies and stretching the arms out! If you use my clothes, I'm gonna use yours, dude!" Emma exclaimed, flipping her off, just as Wanda flipped her off back. They glared at each other for maybe four solid seconds, and then Wanda pursed her lips.
Exasperatedly, he stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the common floor. Natasha wasn't easy to anger or get on edge, but once she was there, you might as well just ride it out. As someone who'd had Natasha be pretty mad at him a handful of times in their long partnership, Clint was extremly aware of that. The other Avengers, well, maybe not so much. He would warn them, but honestly, Natasha could use the cathartic experience of igniting fear in mens' hearts or whatever. She could enjoy that sometimes.
"Alright," Natasha said entirely calmly, like she wasn't pressing a whole two-hundred-pound super soldier to the fridge with two fingertips and a glare.
She didn't expect a fast answer, so she settled down to try and figure out what the hell Ben 10 was. As it turned out, it was entirely useless, seeing as she got an answer almost immediately.
After that it was a bit of a blur. She jumped against the walls, rolling on the floor to get away from when he tried to grab her like a particularly tricky frog: with both hands and squishing her in the process.
"Darcy's got him in one of the panic rooms," he replied in his Captain America voice, clamping his hand down on Tony's metal-covered bicep. "He's okay, Tony."
Peter was just telling them that a zebra's skin was actually black, when the door to the stairs opened again, and Emma appeared, looking winded and sort of pissed off. She was still wearing her shirt from earlier, but had changed pants, and was barefoot. Her hair was up in a messy bun, and her eyes flashed in anger.
"Damian Wayne, right? I'm Jamie Grant from the Gotham Gazette. Can I get-" the man said, his eyes gleaming with excitement. Oh, a reporter. Well, shit.
"What, you think I can't be helpful? I'll show you helpful," he smirked at her, all cocky, and Darcy laughed, bringing his lips to hers.
"That he learns better when he's hearing someone saying something. Jarvis, you read him a lot of audio books, don't you?"
"Alright, kid. What do you wanna do?" Bucky asked. Peter looked up at him, his face confused and kinda... Cute.
"You do love your Aunt Tasha," he replied with a small smile. He looked up at the screen again. Darcy was staring at him, her eyes searching for something he wasn't sure he was showing.
"Oh, have you seen this headline? Can't believe Darcy let it pass print," Betty said with a concerned look on her face as Emma gathered their plates up to put in the dishwasher. "
"You haven't played with Lego before? Oh we're getting this," she declared, pulling the Avengers-box off the shelf and shoving it into Damian's arms. He grunted and turned his signature scowl on her.
"Probably the same reason as you, birdie," Bruce pointed out, squeezing her shoulder once before letting go. Emma stepped back from him and frowned.
"Layla and Damian. Hope's going on a weekend-trip with her dad and TJ had a band-thing, supposedly. I personally think it's just an excuse so she can stay out with Damian later."
"Morning, Thor," Clint grunted as he lifted Victoria into his arms to prevent his entire legs from being shredded. "How's Bruce?"
Bucky was going real soft, but he couldn't find it in him to care as Darcy patiently explained to him why his nickname was Anakin.
"Hey, this is a good learning opportunity for you, my electrical bud," Emma said, getting to her feet, and making her way over to the two collapsed super-soldiers. When Vision didn't move, she looked back. "That's you."
"Did someone seriously try to mug you? You, the huge, buff, metal armed guy who looks like he eats annoying people for breakfast?
"You should hit the road. It'll get dark in a few hours," he said, giving Tony a pointed look. Mournfully, Tony got off the couch, grabbing his shirt from where it was draped over the back of a chair, and started buttoning it up. Steve crouched down and held his arms out toward Peter, who came barreling into his papa's arms.
"Heh. I know," Tony smirked, but then tapped on his Starktab distractedly. "I can't believe it worked. Why'd Cho say it wouldn't?"
Emma watched in fascination as it stared, a hand coming up to touch the glass before it slowly descended and landed on the floor.
"We'll give Clint a dye-job and a haircut, and trust the magic of makeup on Natasha's part then. The party doesn't start until Wednesday, so you have four days to study the file and come back to me with any issues."
"Well, alright. Just promise me you'll be careful, okay?" Emma asked, eyes wide. "Don't want to become an orphan and be sent off again."
"Right," he said, but he sounded too sarcastic for Emma's liking, so she dashed forward to give him a kiss on the cheek before she tugged Bucky into the elevator with her.
"Jarvis tells dada what to do," he said from the floor. Bucky swept the cupcakes to the side for some cooking space, carefully aligning them instead when Peter made a horrified noise.
"Alright kiddo, I think it's time we got you into bed," he said quietly, getting a displeased squint from the heap of tiny limbs in his lap. "Come on. Up you go."
"It's wordplay, alright? It's funny. Steve laughed when I told him," he pouted. "To initiate the program, just go lay down, close your eyes, do some circulatory system rotations until you start to fade to black. Got it?"
"I apparently haven't been apart from you for too long, since I can tell that you just capitalized 'situation' in your mind."
"What are you doing!" Tony hissed, but it was just the distraction he didn't know he needed, because the Iron Man suit flew over Hulk's head as he turned to look at Emma again. She exhaled when she saw Tony jump into the suit, but the Hulk was still looking at her, confused and angry and without a clue as to who she was.
"Yeah, but not predictably. It's really willy-nilly on if you're going to heal quick enough that you won't bleed out."
"Yup," Steve replied just as happily, his cheeks flushing. Darcy chuckled, and Steve shot her an inquisitive eyebrow. "How long have you three been video-calling?"
"Emma!" came Clint's call from somewhere far away. She tipped her head back to look up at Clint's worried face from the floor above them, along with Natasha's silently furious one.
"Step away from me," Damian said calmly, but it's the wrong kind of calm, the kind of calm he is before he punches someone in the face. The paparazzi whipped out a camera from the bag, and snapped a picture of him. Emma winced.
"What? But I just got home," he whined and burrowed further into her hair, his hand seeking hers. "I thought we were gonna stay in and watch those old movies you like and eat pizza."
"Not at all," she sighed back, feeling his hand slip around her side and cupping her hip. "Oh, dude, there is no way I'm getting out of this skirt without help."
"Of course, Miss Emma," Jarvis said, and Emma beamed at Vision, kissed Natasha on the cheek, and then took off for the elevator, grabbing her science notes from Tony's desk as she went.
"They made a person. Emma named them Vision," Bucky replied, not looking up at her. Instead, he kept petting Victoria, the large white cat who was ridiculously stupid and prissy. Only Bucky, Natasha, and Emma were allowed to pet her, along with possibly Clint, if he was careful. She shed on everything, and was
"You got yourself in this mess," Natasha said patiently, pressing her lips together to stop her smile from widening. "Get yourself out of it by apologizing."
Bucky smiled, looking up at her and cupping her face with his metal hand. He was getting better at that, pretending like his left arm was just any other part of himself. "Yeah. That sounds amazing." His smile dimmed. "Just a few concerns."
"Mobsters only trust each other as far as they can throw each other. They're gonna check us for wires," she pointed out. "We won't be able to get anything concrete if we don't have wires, of a sort."
"Very mature, Barton!" Sharon called after him with a frown, and a couple of agents around them grinned, or rolled their eyes lovingly at Clint's antics. Sharon gave Natasha a nod, and Natasha nodded back, before following Clint up the steps.
"Hey, Dames, let's just leave-" she hurried out, tugging on his arm for the third time now, but it was like trying to push a twelve story building. She could've used some of her disproportionate strength, but the paparazzi was literally
"Okay," she said, and Emma smiled up at her when the elevator slowed to a stop by Tony's workshop.The child was always
"Hey look, your tongue's purple!" Emma laughed, grabbing his chin. At her insistence, he stuck his tongue out, and she giggled again. "I'd kiss you, but grape-flavor is gross."
"Hell yes, let me grab my jacket. Will you drive me to the mall afterwards?" Emma asked, and hopped over the couch. Wanda nodded and her hands flickered in scarlet as a pair of car keys flew through the air and into her palm.
"I guess you're right. How's the code and protocols?" Bruce asked Tony, who waved a hand, and the status reports appeared on the screen.
He grabbed a cup of coffee from the kitchen, it was apparently already six am, and sipped it whilst gazing out over the not so lazy streets of New York City. He'd gone back to Brooklyn a while ago, to check it out, and found that it didn't look the same, which was a really strange sensation, but New York City had sure as hell not looked like this back in his day. Somehow, the huge change felt better than the smaller one.
"I am absorbing a lot of knowledge, and have had to initiate several triple-Z protocols to categorize it and organize it," Vision said very seriously. Bruce looked baffled.
"Well, no, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't get to!" Bucky shrugged in a 'fair enough' gesture, and Emma waved Tony's confused face off as Steve abandoned his plate and came up behind his husband, sliding his arms around his waist and leaning his chin against his shoulder. "We're talking about Peggy, anyways, and not me."
, doesn't it?" she said happily, tugging her spring coat over her shoulders. It was purple, a hand-me-down from Kate, as were the shoes. Clint had no clue why Kate was so obsessed with dressing Emma up in Hawkeye-themed clothes, but he sort of appreciated the support.
"Oh, hey, Jarvis, put a blocker on social media, we don't need Vision on Twitter or Facebook or something until we've taught them to use their thumbs," Tony said hurriedly, tapping on his tablet.
"I don't know," Steve said thoughtfully as he picked Peter up out of his chair for a cuddle and a kiss. "I like team."
He considered that, and pulled his one leg up on the couch, so he could more comfortably face her. Darcy reacted in kind, pulling a leg up and tilting her head at him.
"Nice touch by Janet, I'll admit," Tony said distantly as he looked Vision up and down. "Very nice."
"Don't worry, puff boy. I was just calling for you," she teased, and Pietro tapped his foot on the floor a little angrily, before crossing his arms over his chest and tipping his nose up.
Emma didn't look as violently inclined once she had the other guy pinned, and Clint held his hand up.
"He won't," Bruce promised. "We made mistakes last time that we didn't repeat in this one. For one, he doesn't have a primary goal. That's what set Ultron off in the first place."
By the morning, Emma's leg was almost entirely healed, just a scab left behind, and she kept picking on it like it was stressing her out that it was even there. She wouldn't stop poking it until Natasha taped it over with gauze, not wanting to see the ugly wound any more than she had to on Emma's usually unmarred skin.
On the screen, was a beautiful woman, with brown hair up in a hair-do Natasha would call a 'messy bun', and black glasses. Her face was oval, her cheekbones prominent and eyes dark blue. Her eyebrows were currently furrowed, and she tilted her head at him in confusion. Bucky was left to stare at her in shock.
"Yes. Mobleader and her partner," he said, looking over to Natasha. "You know the ropes of an organized crime-ring very well, and we're expecting you to rely on that knowledge."
"Nothing, just... It noticed," Wanda told her softly, and Emma shrugged before continuing her fiddling. She could hear urgent beeping from the vital signs that she'd put on the holo-screen in the main area, and she flicked a switch on the controlpad that made the room around them light up like it'd been hit with a surge of energy.
"What am I, your personal chef?" he asked, but moved towards the fridge to see what he could scrounge up anyways, because he was good like that.
She hopped off the bike, crumpling the bag in her hand. "You know who you should talk to about this stuff, too? Your girlfriend."
?" Darcy asked incredulously as she stepped into their apartment. She blinked as she stopped about a foot from the elevator.
"I was reading," Vision complained, sounding remarkably whiny, and Tony thought back to what Wanda said, about the android feeling too real. Emma's remarks about how Vision was an intelligent life form, of a sort. Too smart to be Dummy or You, too solid to be Jarvis. They'd given Vision the opportunity to learn and unlearn, like humans do, and Helen had insisted that if they wanted a human android, the android would need to be able to sleep. Making sure Vision would be able to dream was a little too enthusiastic, in Bruce's opinion, but they'd added it to the list of possible modifications. They hadn't really been expecting Vision's behavior to be so influenced by the stone on his forehead, however.
Clint stopped walking towards the elevator immediately, gripping Emma's shoulders gently and trying to hold her gaze.
?" Darcy questioned in disbelief. Tony making many human-looking robots was not good for her sanity and having to explain it to the press. As their current PR-advisor and the only one who managed to handle the Avengers gracefully, the amount of shit she'd have to deal with would be enormous if he made plural, many fucking robots.
"Well then, we'll list you as unidentified until you figure it out. That's cool too. Take your time," Emma said with a reassuring nod. Vision nodded back, now looking more determined. "Read some books about gender and stuff. That's what Steve did to figure out it was cool to be gay nowadays. Also I'm pretty sure Tony drunkenly kissed Rhodey and nobody really reacted. You'll meet Rhodey soon, you'll like him. Very non-nonsense. Hey, are you two alright over there?" she then called over. Bucky had collapsed back on his ass too now, head tossed back and grinning.
Damian sighed, but seemed to resign himself to her antics, and slid down to sit on the little stool outside of the rooms.
They hit up Hot topic, and found the scrunchie for Bucky, as well as a Supernatural bracelet. After some wandering around, Emma found a toy store, which she dragged Damian into.
"I know," she replied and shook her red locks free from the messy bun she'd been keeping them in. His phone vibrated in his pocket, and he pulled it out with a sigh.
"Yeah, fair enough," Hank said, and crossed his arms over his chest. He still hadn't made a move to get up. Tony turned his eyes on his fellow scientist, and grinned, before turning to Emma.
"Remember that favor I asked of you?" she asked him, and Peter gaped at her for a second, big doe-eyes blinking in surprise. Then his squishy baby-face turned into a much more serious look.
?" Bucky said, sounding disgusted and angry. All surprised eyes turned to him. "Practically a fucking human being and you're calling 'm a project?"
Don't get him wrong, Peter was a huge dork, much like his parents, who adored spiders and his Aunt Tasha. He liked science, much to Tony's glee, and had big, doe-like brown eyes that could get just about anyone to cave. He'd seen the kid use the doe eyes Fury's way, and shit if it hadn't worked. Amazing kid, really.
"I dunno. It's Tony. He probably could, if you give him enough time," Clint shrugged as Vision silently slipped through the floor. "Holy hell. Does he do that all the time?"
, Emma!" he exclaimed, but Emma couldn't take her eyes off the bot standing in front of her. "Wait. Jarvis? Is that..."
Emma pulled Peter and Lucky out of the way, and Kate walked over them and towards the freezer to grab some leftovers, probably.
"Actually, I'm just here to get the soldiers and Nat to go running, but from what I've heard that might not be happening."
When Steve stretched a hand out, Clint stared at him and his ridiculously huge puppy eyes for a solid three seconds. God, maybe he wasn't that tired of them. Obviously they still managed to throw him for a loop.
"I'll add one more stripe. Choose carefully," he said, and Peter's tiny eyebrows furrowed as he stared intently at the cupcake. "What time is it even?"
Clint and Natasha met up with Coulson to discuss the details of their mission the next day, and Emma managed to convince them that she was perfectly healthy enough to go to Damian's place and hang out like she'd promised.
"That you better be resting," Clint said promptly, and dropped Victoria in her lap. Immediately the cat, who had been scratching at Clint to be let down, settled down and blinked at Emma slowly.
The elevator doors opened again, revealing Natasha and Clint, freshly showered from a workout combined with sparring session.
"PJB?" Peter nodded. What Americans saw in peanutbutter and jelly combined on white bread, Bucky will never understand. He still retrieved both containers, handing one to Peter to get him to unclench his hand from his shirt, and because he only had one hand, what with holding the tiny person.
"I'm hot either way," he said haughtily, and Emma confiscated the glasses for his attitude, throwing both pairs back onto the rack.
The issue at hand was that Bucky had been chosen to babysit Peter Stark-Rogers whilst his parents went on a two day trip to get some well deserved peace and quiet. Bucky was happy that his best friend had built a life and a family in the twenty-first century, he really was, but he wasn't very eager to join him. He didn't feel the need for love like theirs at the moment, and was glad to just hang out with Natasha, or Steve, and sometimes even Clint. He liked just... Being there.
"Alright soldier boy, be helpful," she snickered, and Bucky spun her around, tossing her over his shoulder. "Hey, careful with the goods!"
"Oh, god," Bruce said from the floor, eyes wide as he clutched at his chest, getting up on all fours. "Christ, no. No, no no."
"Hey, Buck, that's not how they mean it," Steve hurried to soothe. Bucky muttered a few choice words in Russian and took off for the elevator.
"Aunt Tasha! Bucky said a bad word!" Peter whispered. Clint bit his lip to stop from laughing out loud. Bucky turned to face him, and gave Clint the stink eye on the side.
"Bruce is in on this?!" she exclaimed, examining the box with her fingers, finding the controlpad. Wanda was still touching the glass, scarlet-flashing eyes locked on the bot-person's face. "How do we get it out?"
"You want me to die of an infection in my leg just so I'll stop beating you up for taking my socks? You absolute shithead!" Emma squealed, and Natasha pinned Pietro with a look. Natasha was generally pretty intimidating, but when she really did it on purpose, put some effort into it, the effect was startlingly horrifying and imposing.
"How dare you!" Pietro exclaimed, looking absolutely appalled and shocked. Emma burst out laughing too at the shocked look on his face. Wanda smirked.
"Calculated risk," Emma muttered, feeling sort of loopy with the blood-loss. There was a whoosh of air, and Pietro appeared with a bigger box of bandages in hand and a blanket.
"Jarvis, movie?" Peter asked as he patted the seat next to him on the couch. Obediently, because sometimes he was nice like that, he sat down next to the small child, and was forced to watch Toy Story 3.
"Hey kiddo," he said and ruffled Peter's hair awkwardly, but from the grin he recieved, he assumed it wasn't all that bad.
Darcy laughed, and got a smile back for her troubles. Not a good day, but not a bad day either. She could handle that.
"You're calling a suit," Vision pointed out incredulously, floating up into the corner of the training room with their arms crossed like a scolded child who obviously just wanted to test out their new protocols.
"Maybe. Where's Bucky?" Emma mumbled, as Clint carefully tucked a strand of hair back behind her ear, careful not to disturb her head injury.
"Well, it's too late to do anything anyway, Bucky's on his way there already. We did set a time," Clint reminded Emma.
"Mm. Nothing," she said as she let herself be dragged back to bed by Clint's strong arms. He nuzzled into her hair with a happy hum as she bit her lip and stared at the screen.
The form shot out of the box like a missile, and Emma was right in the way, getting herself tackled to the ground for her troubles. Years of instincts and training made her roll with the speed and use it against her opponent, tossing the android-person-bot-thing into the air with the push of her feet. She got her own feet back under her just in time to see the bot-person-android-thing slowing in the air, caught itself just before it crashed into the windows in Tony's shop. The thing stared out into the New York City lights, and stilled.
"Please tell me that's not what you actually named them, Tony," Bruce pleaded, alarmed, and watching as Vision shifted their density to enter the little bubble of light along with Tony. When Vision was safely within the bubble, Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket.
All the other Wayne boys have a Wayne-smile, the public smile, just like Tony does, but Damian doesn't. She hadn't actually considered why they have that until she's in the middle of a situation where it would be great if he actually had a smile he could plaster on to please the press.
"Cute. Alright, move you little gremlins, I gotta get something to eat before this place becomes a mess hall, emphasis on the mess."
"That depends on the situation," Steve protested as he gave Peter a sip of his milk to wash the pancake down. "Besides, I don't tell the team to go, the alarm does."
Steve and Tony got a hold of him. And Bruce. He didn't even want to think about his poor corpse in the hands of a grieving Bruce.
"That sounds lovely, but he was really freaking out yesterday. I want to know that he can handle it."
Emma attempted to shift her weight, only to yelp in pain. Quickly, Clint helped her back down into the least painful position.
With the help of Jarvis and some online recipies, they managed to make blueberry pancakes without breaking the kitchen, because Bucky is a
"If Wanda's my sister, and Clint's her dad, and you're Clint's... whatever. Does that make you my aunt?"
"Alright, you got me there. Do you trust me?" she asked, holding a pinkie out, one that wasn't covered in fake-cheese.
Tony was father to a toddler. He knew cranky moods, and he knew that Vision had been awoken rather rudely and abruptly, instead of like waking up from a particularly restful sleep, like they'd originally planned for the android's boot-up. More fitting that they were born too early and with getting manhandled the moment they were fresh out of the cradle, actually, now that Tony thought about it. A real birth indeed.
"She really hit it out of the park with the design," Dr. Cho agreed. "Vision? What color is this?" She held up a color swatch that looked red to Emma.
The top of the casket-like box was made of glass, and Emma crouched by the side of it, running a hand over the smooth surface. Immediately, the casket lit up from within. A face came into view, eyes closed and skin red and green.
"What?" he asked, even though he knew exactly which occasion she was talking about. From the frowny twitch to Natasha's lips, she also knew which time Kate was talking about. Kate only raised her eyebrows at him.
"I am an android," Vision replied slowly, eyebrow-ridge furrowing a little. "I have not been assigned a gender."
"Bucky!" Peter squealed and scrambled over the back of the couch, earning him a sharp intake of breath from Steve before he righted himself again and dashed right into the solid muscle that was Bucky's legs. Bucky felt that twinge of fear flare up and then quiet down.
Bucky stayed with Emma in Natasha's bed that night, and Natasha got up a few times during the night to check on them, waking Bucky maybe only once or twice.
there and let us dote on you as much as we want!" Clint demanded. Emma rolled her eyes as well, in perfect imitation of Bucky.
Peter lit up like the sun, and scrambled off the bed with his Iron Man plushie still in a tight grip towards a bookshelf. Who knew the Avengers Tower had a bookshelf? Probably something Steve had forced Stark to add to Peter's room.
"Look, Nat, I thought it'd be fine," Tony hurried out, and this time, when Steve tried to protect his husband from Natasha's anger, she jabbed two sure fingers in under his arm, immediately rendering it limp, before giving the Iron Man suit's chestplate a very solid punch. With a quick twist of her leg and a strategically landed elbow, she had Tony and Steve on the ground, pinning Steve with a foot and Tony by the hips.
?" Clint signed, and Emma's sign was a little wonky, what with Bruce being in the way, but she still managed a '
"Do not touch the cradle," Jarvis repeated, louder, and Dummy rolled over with a whirring noise, trying to grab her to pull her away, but she only batted at him as she cranked another dial, watching as the lights went way up inside the box.
He still didn't know shit about keeping a four and a half year old entertained for over ten minutes.
Peter was now firmly perched on a bar stool, swirling his spaghetti and tomato sauce and making noises whilst doing so. Bucky watched with a small smile from where he was leaning on the other side of the kitchen island, eating his own spaghetti. Peter kicked his feet and drank his milk, but otherwise didn't try to talk to him.
"Peter is four. You are a man of ninety-seven. That's over nine decades. I can't believe I'm telling you to grow the hell up."
That was the problem with having a kid with noble, good intentions. Damn Emma and her sense of responsibility for other's safety.
"Oh. Um, yeah. Sure. C'mon Vision, we're gonna head to a training room," Bruce agreed, and Vision let go of Emma.
"That was a good, harmless, poor little mug. What'd it ever done to you, Kate?" Clint mocked, and Kate made a face at him.
"Good. We got a mission, though, so we're leaving in four days," he said seriously. At Emma's worried face, he held his hand up. "Don't worry, it's just a little undercover work to get our feet wet again after our relax-period. It's not gonna be that dangerous. We'll call whenever we have the chance."
Natasha didn't reply, she only stood up with an unimpressed look on her face, brushing by Clint and grabbing some stir fry before she disappeared into the elevator.
They bought Dairy Queen and had only just tossed the plastic cups in the trash when they noticed a man Emma didn't recognize sort of following them. Immediately she felt her body tense and get ready to run, but Damian didn't react until the man was right in front of them, and when he did, he scowled.
Peter talked fast and loud enough that when the elevator bell dinged, it was soft enough to be drowned out by him. He still noticed though, and stopped mid-sentence to whip his head around to look excitedly at the opening doors.
"Doctor Cho said so. We trust her," he said silently, like that was the absolute truth. Natasha took in the protective curl of Bucky's body around her little daughter, the lock of her hair curled around his finger.
"I guess, if that's how it's done. I'm pretty sure Barton stole his dog, and Natasha knows too many shady russian cat-ladies for Victoria to be anything but a trade-off of favors," Bucky said, reaching back to smooth his hand over her fur, making her one eye pop open. When she saw who it was, she began purring, and settled down again to sleep.
That wasn't exactly the response she'd been expecting. When she moved to tug Damian away from the threat, he stayed put.
"Hi guy- I mean team!" Steve corrected quickly, shooting them a sheepish smile. Peter made a noise that sounded like 'hi daddy' through his mouthful of pancakes. "Hi team. How are you doing today?"
"Love you too," Peter said and got another round of hugs and kisses. The superhusbands piled into the elevator, and waved miserably at their son before the doors closed.
"Hey Peter Pan," Tony said, leaning his head on Steve's shoulder. The nickname made sense to Bucky now, given their book preferences.
"Good morning, archer. Asleep, I believe. How is our little warrior?" Thor asked back, frowning worriedly.
"Now you wrap your arms around me and squeeze back," Emma said. Vision did as told, wrapping their arms around the girl, and blinking down at her head.
"No," he said, appearing from out of the bathroom, pulling his shirt over his head. "I just... I didn't exactly have a good job back... back then. Don't know what I qualify as now. Can't be a firefighter, too much PTSD, can't be a police officer, never actually went to an academy and doing so now would probably trigger my PTSD, can't go to medical school or anyting, because I don't actually have a college degree, and oh, right, looking at bodies would trigger my PTSD!" he snapped, going for his shoes by the door and snatching them off the floor.
Bruce and Betty were in the kitchen when they got back, and immediately when he laid eyes on her, Bruce was up and standing.
"You're my vision for the future, kiddo," he said, clasping a hand over the android's shoulder that didn't have a cord sticking out of it. "You can have any name you want. Except I'm not allowed to name living things, and you, you are definitely very alive."
"Mother of fuck!" Emma yelped when she looked inside. "Holy fucking shit. That's a person!" Wanda came closer as Emma pressed her face to the glass. "Why is there a person in there?!"
"I'm glad we agree. Ugh, gross, you smell like a foot. I love you anyway, yes, yes, argh!" Emma laughed as Lucky tipped her over on her butt, still licking her in the face. The elevator slowed to a stop by the training rooms, and Emma was helped to her feet by Tony, before they exited the elevator. Lucky remained inside. "Good boy! Good boy."
"Nah, he's doing homework late, is all," Emma sighed. "He always procrastinates to the last minute and doesn't like actually study and he still gets straight A's! I wish I could do that."
"How are we getting in when we're fake mobsters, if he's only inviting his mobster friends?" Clint questioned.
, and Darcy, and Steve, and mom, and- actually, there isn't any sole credit to go to anyone, if you wanna hand out credit. You're doing good, is what I mean. Maybe the next step isn't to, like, move into a house in the suburbs, get a wife and 2.5 kids with a dog, maybe it's just acknowledging that that's not what you want." Bucky pressed his lips together. Emma's eyebrows raised. "Or is that what you want?"
"Is that us?" he asked, even though it obviously was. He felt strangely pleased to have this small child's appreciation and apparent trust.
"Nope. I didn't do anything the teachers told me to, I was building robots in class and being a general disturbance, along with ignoring learning how to write in cursive and not doing my reading. When they said I wasn't passing, my dad forced them to move me up two grades, and yeah, my grades went up, but I also got some serious beat-downs because I was a skinny, loudmouthed eight-year-old in a class of ten-year-olds. I remember Bruce telling me he only realized that he wasn't an idiot when he got a teacher that recognized that he was an auditive learner, and before that, his grades weren't amazing either."
"The lesson to take away from this story? Grades don't say shit about how smart you are," Tony told her very seriously. "Just because you don't think you're getting amazing grades doesn't mean you're not smart. You're crazy smart. You're gonna go far, kid."
She hushed him gently just to soothe, running a slightly shaky hand through his hair. Bruce's breathing was shot to hell, and she was pretty sure the burning sensation in her thigh was rebar, the blood spreading down her naked thigh. The feeling of it was all too recognizable, normal for her.
"I need to collect data for sensory input," Vision replied, and Emma blinked. They were in the gym, currently, Emma because Bucky and Steve were sparring and she liked to watch, and Vision because she'd managed to catch the android as it was floating through the floor.
"Don't be so impatient. We'll figure something out that you can do, don't worry. Push comes to shove, you can always go to college, I guess," she said, shoving her helmet on and straddling the bike.
"Why do you have to be so easy to undermine, Clint?" Natasha sighed. Emma blinked innocently up at the two of them. "You enlisted Kate for this? Are you that desperate to go meet your friends?"
"Quit it," Bruce said with an eyeroll, but he did look a little tired, and he kept rubbing his neck distantly. "Vision, run protocols."
"What do you mean 'it effing worked'?" he asked, sort of loudly, and with extremely wide eyes. His eyes immediately fell on Vision, and Vision stared back. "Oh, holy crap. Holy- What
"I'm sure. Like, eighty percent sure," Tony reassured, looking between his phone, the wallpanel, and Vision in the little dome. "We've done less dramatic tests with greater risks before." Bruce nodded, but he rubbed his hand against his breastbone a little nervously still.
"I see why Bishop wouldn't let you buy that," he said. The dress was red and had a bunch of straps running horizontally around her figure, making her look a little curvier than usual. It tied around her neck with red straps as well, and had gold accents all over. Damian's eyes didn't so much roam as dart around, like he wasn't entirely sure what to think. Emma grinned.
"Valentina and Inferno met in Chicago when he had his seat there. There aren't any of his henchmen in Bermuda, so you should be in the clear without having to change up too much of your appearance, unless you feel like it'd be needed?"
"Hi Auntie Tasha!" he squealed, hopping into her arms. Natasha caught him easily, and hefted him up on her hip. While she might be mad at his parents, she wasn't going to take it out on the toddler.
"Well I'm gonna go take a shower, get this grease off of me," he said slowly, not breaking eye-contact with Natasha. Clint moved out of the way, not really feeling like Natasha needed the backup.
"Emma, get out of here," Tony said, his voice surprisingly serious for being Tony as he pressed some buttons on his phone. "I'm not kidding, out!"
"She's kickass," Bucky agreed, a proud little smile playing around the edges of his mouth as he sliced some more bellpepper.
"You don't think that's exactly what I want, Sharon, dear?" Clint asked, and she used the rubberband to snap him on the forehead this time. "Oow! Tasha, rescue me!"
So sorry about the delay, I've watched civil war for the first time and then infinity war in like... the span of three days. So I'm a little ruined, and it's been like eating wet paper towels, trying to write (weird metaphor but like??? I can't think of a better way to describe it). Here's a late chapter anyways!!
"Want toast?" he suggested. Peter looked up at him, a furrow in his brow that was way too serious for a four year old to have.
"Can't convince you to dump more responsibility on Steve and Tony? I know they'd love to help," he tried valiantly.
"Hey, don't ever think that. I'm with you because you make me happy, James. You've never been the source of any unhappiness for me." Her eyes were soft when gazing at him, too soft. He couldn't look her in the eye and say what he needed to at the same time, for the risk of getting sucked into her sphere.
"Trust me, babe, c'mon," Emma whined, pushing her bottom lip out. Damian hummed, and let her guide him down the aisles towards the cashier. "One way to look at Lego is like a 3D puzzle, yeah? Except even cooler."
"I'm calling a suit to protect my bones and because he knows Iron Man! Don't shoot him! It just pisses him off even more," Tony said hurriedly, slamming a button on the wall by one of the entrances. "Emma, didn't I tell you to get out of here!"
Hulk charged for her, and Emma ran back into the alcove, jumping up in the still rings and swinging out of range with her heart hammering in her chest.
"Yeah, you keep saying that, babe, and I'm uber-supportive, but at the same time, I'm starting to doubt. You're usually pretty ready to go when you really want something," she pointed out. "Except when the PTSD pops up. Is it popping up?"
Suddenly there was a gust of wind, and Pietro was by his sister, clutching her to his chest as her fingers trembled where they had a claw-like grip on his shoulders, and Tony's head appeared from the entrance to the sub-basements. He stared with wide eyes at them all.
"Uh-huh. That was nice of him," Steve replied, his voice warm and soothing enough for Peter to nuzzle into Bucky's real side. The contact nearly startled Bucky, but he'd gotten more used to Peter's incessant cuddling, and could now handle it without flinching and/or freaking out as it happened.
"We both had too much discipline, now we give our daughter too little. Poetic justice," she hummed, and Clint laughed, his laughter rough with sleep. Emma had the sudden urge to drop down between her parents in their bed and sleep the day away.
"It's alright, Emma, you're good," Natasha soothed, smoothing a hand over Emma's hair and coming away with blood on her hands. "ебать. Pietro, hand me another- yes, good."
"Again, what am I, your driver?" Bucky asked when she bounced around his and Darcy's aparment, waiting for him to get ready and drive her there.
"So? We live in the Avengers tower. We don't pay for nothin' at all," he shot back. Darcy rubbed the back of her neck, trying to stretch the tendons out so they'd stop aching.
"Better, I guess. Nat's definitely still pissed, but Bucky's stopped hovering, which means he actually believes Emma when she says she feels fine."
"Dunno. I just like to roam. There was this cute dress at Macy's I saw when I was here with Kate and she covered my eyes and told me that dad would kill her if she let me buy that. I think you'd like it."
They had some popcorn and watched a bright cartoon, Bucky with the tablet containing Darcy in his lap. She was wearing a burgundy tee, her tongue poking out of her red lips. She was writing something, probably whatever she'd wanted to talk to Tony about, and the crease in her brows really made her look clever. She was a real spitfire, actually, from what he'd gathered. He liked Darcy.
"Hulk!" Natasha shouted, but he'd stopped listening to even Tony's voice after a while, too into the game to care about others. Natasha's voice made his head tilt a little, probably because it sounded like a gunshot in an entirely silent room, full of authority and righteous anger and protectiveness. Emma would've met her eyes to reassure her that she was okay, but you don't look away from your opponent when you're mid-fight. Emma's been shot on several occasions for doing that.
"This is my study cape. It makes me feel less angry about studying when I can make it swoosh around my ankles." Wanda gave her a disbelieving look, but said nothing. She'd learned during her time at the tower that Emma had her eccentricities, and it was easier to just accept it than try to find out the logic behind her actions.
"You think just cause it's a new century, I'm gonna propose to you? Oh no, if you want this hot piece of ass, you're gonna have to put a ring on it yourself. Are we done with this adult conversation now?"
"Goodie. Now, Bucky's gonna punch you. There are playful punches and there are punches that you use to hurt someone. This," she said, and punched Vision very gently in the shoulder, "is a playful punch. Buck?"
"Mmm. Blood loss is so annoying," Emma groaned, her eyes slipping closed as she felt her heart beat in her head. She heard Natasha yell this time, as black ink swirled under her eyelids, and everything went dark.
"That you're the perfect combo of Hawkeye and Black Widow. That was very Clint and simultaneously very Natasha of you," she explained. Emma beamed as Vision flexed their artificial muscles.
"Play nice," Tony said, nudging her shoulder. "New kid's not going anywhere, you'll be able to bully Vision later about your superior skills at color-naming."
"Not mine," Emma said, and felt her eyelids getting heavy again. She could feel as bloodvessels in her thigh reconnected, the new surge of wet against the bandages Helen had no doubt fixed onto her leg, as her body struggled to patch her back together.
"I do not have a name," he stated in a smooth voice, and everyone but Tony recoiled. Even Wanda hadn't seen that one coming, all of them staring at him. Tony beamed.
"Don't remind me," he muttered, and they pulled out of the garage with Emma's gleeful giggles echoing off the walls.
"Do another one," Emma demanded. Dr. Cho fiddled with her little color swatches, and held another one up. This one was bright blue.
Immediately as those words left his husband's mouth, Tony's shoulders relaxed, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief. Despite being the one in armor, he leaned his forehead against Steve's shoulder, and Steve, looking much more vulnerable except for maybe the shield, cradled the back of Tony's head reassuringly, like he was shielding him.
"She's in the living room, and she's impatient," he sighed. "Would you mind taking a look at her now? I'll whip you up some pancakes when you're done."
"Oookay, I'm gonna... Leave you to deal with that, Buck," Clint said slowly. "I'll put some tea on for you downstairs, alright Nat?"
"Bruce?" Tony asked casually, glancing at him from out of the corner of his eye. Bruce hands were shifting between his usual pale pallor to something greener, and Emma stared, wide-eyed. He shook his head, muttering 'no' under his breath, before he collapsed on the floor. "Bruce."
"Have at it," Bucky said, sliding a platter of stir fry over the kitchen island. Pietro heaved a put-upon sigh, but grabbed the plate and sat down to eat.
"Don't even say that stuff out loud, mom," Emma complained, knocking on the wooden kitchen table with a frown.
"Right. I gotta get going, make sure you get some knives and the explosives into your heels," he supplied as he grabbed his shoes of her bedroom floor.
"Doting cat-dad Bucky. Cute," she smiled, and Bucky picked Victoria up like one would lift a baby, getting bumped in the face by her wet little pink nose.
"Hey babe," Darcy said, shooting him an innocent smile. Bucky rolled his eyes fondly, but hitched Emma up higher. "Hey sugarbabe. How's the leg doing?"
Clint and Natasha stole Peter for the rest of the day, which Bucky was thankful for. They went to the park for him to let some steam off, and Bucky went to the gym to beat the shit out of some bags and to do some one armed pull ups. Tony had redesigned the arm nearly completely, making it lighter but keeping the same system of "touch" and the way he moved it. Even so, the fact that his left arm was that much stronger made him want to increase strength in the other arm, to make them more even, as if that was possible.
She put her hands on her hips decisively. "Well, I guess I'll have to remind everyone of how good I'm feeling!"
The light started to hurt her head, so she closed her eyes again, and listened instead. She could hear the clinking of Tony pacing in his Iron Man suit somewhere nearby, and heard her mom's voice a couple of yards away, talking to another woman who wasn't Darcy, Kate, Jane, or Pepper. Probably Helen Cho, then.
"Want me to wrap your hand again afterwards?" Steve asked as he handed Tony a mug of coffee and kissed him on the cheek, because he was a caring and loving husband. Emma thought it was cute.
"Was going to. You've got your parents back now. No babysitter needed," he replied truthfully, and Steve got a look on his face that seemed confused, and yup, now Bucky saw their look alike puppy faces side by side.
"Criminally too many," she laughed. "I know you're rich, asshole, that's not my point. It's too expensive for me not to feel guilty about letting you buy it for me. If if had been like, twenty bucks, I'd still feel a little guilty, but I'd let you. But it isn't twenty, it's 170 dollars. I grew up in a circus. I didn't own more than two pairs of pants for a good chunk of my life. My family get away with it because they're my family. Also Tony once made me look at his estimated net worth until I let him buy Victoria a new bed for the living room."
"Is everyone done throwing a tantrum now?" Clint asked a little irritably. "Seriously, as much as I love a good ole' scientific breakthrough, I was also trying to take a fucking nap when there was suddenly an emergency meeting. As long as it's not gonna murder us in our beds, I'm cool with him. Nat?"
"I don't-" Vision said, closing their eyes and shaking their head in a surprisingly natural-looking way.
"Uncle Clint!" he chided, and Natasha was holding a hand to her mouth to stop from laughing as well.
Vision hit the shield again, giving it two sharp rights, and pulled their shoulders back like they did before they did a forehead-beam, and just in that moment, the shield flickered again.
"Captain Rogers, it seems Sir requires your assistance," came Jarvis' resigned voice from the ceiling.
'. The archer frowned, but shifted until he was sitting comfortably in the rubble next to the two of them, instead of half-way on top of them.
"It was obviously not fine. You will not be in Emma's goddamn vicinity alone until I've decided you aren't a threat to her and her safety. Do you hear me?" she said viciously. When Tony just stared in complete shock, she grabbed the shoulders of the armor and shook him. Seeing as the Iron Man armor itself weighed a lot, and Tony weighed more when he was in it, the look of sheer disbelief on Helen's face was understandable. Clint knew not to underestimate his partner, however. "
"Maybe that's what you should do. Work in a restaurant?" Steve suggested, pulling Peter's mittens and hat off. The squirming toddler whined, and Steve softly shushed him. "I'm getting there, buddy, hold on."
"Alright, fine. Do what your papa says, and what Uncle Buck says, yeah?" Peter smiled and nodded. "Good. Love you."
Pym was now looking entirely confused and mildly terrified. Dr. Cho flipped Vision's hand over, pressing with the tip of a pen against specific spots on their palm and noting the responses she got in a little notebook next to her.
Also, thank you so much for being so many of you who still want to read things from this universe! Makes me super happy!
It was just... He could barely take care of himself. He lived in the appartment next to Natasha's, because she was the only one who he would listen to in the beginning. Her snappy retorts in Russian and Steve's pleading and talking had gotten him to where he was today. He still needed Natasha to poke her head in at least once a week to make sure he'd actually eaten since the last time she was here, and showered, and slept. Steve dropped by a lot too, and so did Barton, but only because he was there to make sure Natasha ate real food, and not just saltines and salads.
Jarvis didn't answer, so Emma dropped down on the floor to investigate. The box wasn't dusty, not really, but it clearly hadn't been used in a while. It was metallic and had a number of dials and numbers blinking on the screen lazily. She did the cool toss-this-onto-the-big-screen swipe with her fingers, and crawled out from under the desk again, peeking up at the big holo-screens above Tony's desk.
"If you survive a few hours in a mall with me, I'll reward you with me in my softest sweatpants, wrapped in your hoodie, lying in your bed with Titus, netflix, and some good chai. Sound good?"
"We really should act on punishments often than we do," Clint said thoughtfully, and Natasha gave him a look that said 'ya think?'.
"Where did you get that?" she asked instead of answering, pointing to the yellow crystal on the android's forehead.
Clint burst out laughing, and cupped the back of Emma's head, brushing a kiss against Natasha's cheekbone.
She could see hundreds of calculations flashing over the screen on top of the cradle, could see that there was still a bit of energy needed to make the circuit complete. Hopping up on the cradle on her knees, she pressed her fingers to the glass covering the face of the bot.
Just then, Natasha dropped down, crouching to absorb the shock, and immediately going for Emma on the floor. She paid no attention to Clint, entirely sure he had her back, and needing him to have Bruce's back as well, while she fixed Emma up as best as she could.
"Alright, let's initiate program triple-z, yeah? That'll give us all time to proccess all this new data," Tony suggested, clapping his hands together and rubbing them against each other. Helen rolled her eyes.
"I always wanted the police station. Think I asked for it for christmas once. I'd have to ask Charlie though, I don't really remember," she hummed.
"Yeah. I promised him I'd come. He won't mind if you're there too, and Peter will be thrilled," she said gently, not saying the words he still heard.
"Very pretty," Emma agreed. Vision stared at the cape around Emma's shoulders, and suddenly a yellow cape materialized around his own shoulders. "Hey, dude, cool cape."
"Yeah, kiddo," he replied, using his real arm to put Peter in a better position, so that he could see Darcy as well. Peter was a surprisingly tactile kid. Then again, Tony touched
Another bandage was pressed into her hand, and she dabbed it against the back of Emma's head, making the younger redhead hiss a little.
"Emma did what an entire group of scientists couldn't and managed to override whatever was wrong with our invention," Tony said, looking a little giddy as he plugged something into the android's neck. "Stay still for a second, buddy, just gotta do some readings now that you're out of your cradle."
"See ya, suckers!" he shouted victoriously as he skipped over to the stairs leading to the door, where Coulson gave him a bemused look. Natasha shifted her papers into a pile, and placed them in her drawer.
"Level three, only, actually," Coulson stated. When he saw the looks on their faces, he shrugged. "You said it yourself, you haven't been out in a while. How does a few days in Bermuda sound?"
"Yeah, sure, of course," Tony said, drumming his fingers against the glass protecting the arc reactor distantly. "Jarvis?"
"Oh, hey Lucky! Is Kate still here?" Emma asked in surprise, sitting down on the floor and pulling Peter into her lap. Lucky procceded to lick her and then Peter in the face, making the toddler giggle. "Pet nicely, sweetheart."
"I need that for now. Okay?" Natasha asked him, and Peter nodded as she set him down, toddling back to his dad as everyone gawked a little. All except for Bucky, who didn't care, and Clint, who knew what she meant.
"Thank you!" Emma beamed, surging up to hug Natasha and then Clint. Then she high-fived Kate and ran for the elevator to go get dressed for a day on the town rather than just the park.
"Yeah, yeah, have fun on your date with birdbrain!" he called as he grabbed the duffle from Natasha's kitchen.
"Is that my top?" Wanda exclaimed incredulously, leaning over the back of the couch with a wrinkle between her brows. Her hair was in a braid, that looked like it was of Thor's making.
"Too bad," Damian said, raising an eyebrow at her. When her phone began to vibrate in her pocket, Emma whipped it out to find Clint vid-calling her.
"Oh, very complicated. We would never be able to understand what he kept spouting," she said in a deadpan, and Coulson huffed in amusement.
"What's life without a little fun at your own expense?" Emma shrugged. "I'd rather laugh about it than cry about it. If I had to cry about it, I'd probably never be able to stop."
"Of course. Where am I a mobleader?" she asked. "The deep deep south? California? Canada? New Jersey?"
"Person in a box in Tony's lab! For all I knew, it could've been a fucking corpse for real!" Emma exclaimed defiantly, back to crossing her arms over her chest.
Vision was sitting on the common room couch, watching Pietro eat popcorn with surprising speed, even for him. It was fascinating, the fact that he hadn't choked on it yet. His twin, sitting on the other side of him, had a nose wrinkled in disgust.
Despite her best efforts, a time limit was set today too, though she convinced them to let her stay for dinner, if Bucky picked her up afterwards.
"Vision is being exposed to a virus, Sir," Jarvis said matter-of-factly, and Hank tapped on the computers and Tony on his tablet, and Helen pushed Vision into the chair Hank had just vacated, before snatching the tablet out of Tony's hands and taking over. Tony, in turn, swished his hand through the air, and the keyboard underneath Hank's fingers flew over to him instead.
"I don't trust that," he said, nodding towards Vision with a frown on his face. "What if he does like Ultron and tries to kill?"
Immediately, to appease his furry friend's demand, Bucky cooed at Victoria in Russian, his voice a little rumbly, but sounding loving and cherishing, and Darcy instinctively felt goosebumps all over her body.
"Shut up, Bruce, you need a nap, not a stressful situation, and there's a reason you're not our only medical professional," Clint said firmly.
Bucky conceded, and held his metal arm out to Natasha, who pressed the folds in all the right places, bless her, revealing the small space where he used to keep small explosives, and found a tiny wad of cash.
She'd jumped from still rings many times in her life, usually into someone's waiting, strong arms, but this time, she leaped just so that she'd be able to land on her hands against his shoulder. The force let her jump off his shoulder and onto the other side of him, rolling on the floor to absorb most of the shock.
Anyway, she didn't want to fight him, and she knew that the kitchen island, where she usually dropped down, was occupied, so she crawled over to the vent in the living room and dropped down there instead, dropping down into the couch and immediately sprawling out. The tv was playing an episode of Ben 10, it looked like, and she mentally shrugged.
He poked Peter up the stairs to the bathroom, helping him haul a sleeping shirt over his head and brush his teeth. When Peter was finally settled in his bed, Bucky sighed, running a hand over his face.
He'd taken a shower at around three am, and shaved his face, tied his hair back. There was a thrumming ache behind his temples, and he couldn't wait for this day to be closer to over so that he could run around his block until it stopped feeling like his lungs were shrinking in his chest.
," Natasha hissed back, immediately going quiet when Emma shifted sleepily, her fingers reaching out. The redhead grasped them and pressed a little kiss to the slim fingers with the chipped green nailpolish.
She saw just as Steve Rogers stepped into the room, in only shorts, a tank top, and with his shield on one arm. His hair was tousled, and the moment he and Tony met eyes, they hurried towards each other, grabbing each other's free arms and tugging each other in.
Um.... Do i think the next update is imminent? No! I totally forgot where I was even going with this little bit of the series. It's much more probable I'll end this and start a whole new thing than finish this, but like, give me four weeks to graduate and then we'll see if I'm inspired again.
"There you are, kiddo. Wanna go shoot with me? Kate made some new arrows she wants to try, and she also brought several whole canned chickens," he said, his eyebrows jumping up and down. "Have I caught your interest?"
"Oh, Aunt Peg was a real class act," Tony smirked, reaching back to stroke Steve's face and getting grease all over him too. Steve didn't seem to mind too much. "Pretty much one of the only two people I've ever seen put Howard in his place."
"Wait, don't-" Emma exclaimed, but was too late to stop Damian from snatching the camera out of the man's hand and snapping the lens clean off. She inhaled sharply as she watched the paparazzi's eyes widen.
"Peachy keen," she promised, dashing forward to wrap her arms around him. "Look, dude, I knew what I was doing. I'm alright, you're alright, nobody's hurt. I think it was actually a pretty successful attempt at calming the Hulk down."
"Watch me," he said, and Natasha rolled her eyes, but decided to amuse him, and leaned back in her chair. Clint took a rubberband, wrapped it around his finger with his hand in the shape of a fingergun, and pointed it into the air, squinting a little.
"Isn't there science behind that? That the mini ones are better than the originals?" Clint tossed in as he and Helen rounded the couch. "Obviously, you're right, I'm just asking."
"So what's on your mind?" she asked, looking up at him as she grabbed a chip from the red plastic bag. Bucky still wasn't entirely convinced that was actual chips, and they definitely couldn't be potatoes in any shape or form. The future held a lot of surprises, but the amount of bullshit and additives that went into food still blew his mind sometimes. 'Course, Stevie had pointed out that Bucky had smoked without giving it a second thought at one point. Tar in his lungs and lime green soda in his stomach were two different things though.
"Alright baby, papa and dada are leaving now. Be good, okay?" he said and stroked Peter's cheeks. Peter nodded and Tony crouched down too, giving his boy a bear hug and a huge smile.
"Any of your famous pancakes left, birdbrain?" she asked, and the warm tone said everything her hands and words didn't.
"Master Peter does not know how to tell time yet, Sergeant," Jarvis said, and Bucky narrowed his eyes toward the ceiling.
"Yes! Of course you are. I can't get a licence yet, and you spend all your time just hanging out at the tower. I can't commandeer you a little?" she asked, putting her hands on her hips.
"Hey feel the dress. It's a pretty cool material," Emma said, stepping out of the changing room and reaching for his hand. She settled it on her hip, smiling at him. Damian met her eyes and stroked his thumb over the fabric.
"I'm sorry I was mean to you," Emma pouted, and Pietro was gone in a flash. Emma gaped, and Clint resigned himself to having to mediate between these two until he and Natasha left for the mission, but then there was a puff of air, and Pietro reappeared, holding the socks in question in hand.
"No, don't encourage me. I'll accidentally do it, and then I'll get fired, and then we'll have no income anymore," she pointed out.
," Tony said, looking over at Vision, standing near the center of the room. "Well, Vis, time to show us what you've got. Shift through the field and we'll get started on testing your 'cool shit' protocols."
He tipped his head back against the wall of the elevator, closing his eyes tiredly and considering sliding into a pile on the floor. Jarvis knew where he was going, and if someone was in the kitchen, they'd probably just drag him out on the floor of the common room, check to see if he was alive, and then leave him be. That sounded nice. A nap sounded real nice right about now, actually.
"Don't you mean fiscally?" Tony joked a little nervously, which was not the smartest thing he could've done.
"Nat," Clint said lowly as he saw her eyes narrow just the slightest, trying to stop her and simultaneously not. Maybe just warning her that whatever she was about to do wasn't the greatest plan. Natasha stepped towards the billionaire, and Steve shot his shield out in front of Tony just in time to catch Natasha's fist against it.
The android obeyed, and Tony laughed as the material of the android's skin moved with the motion, checking his Starktab again and mumbling something under his breath that was probably along the lines of how amazing he was.
He trudged down the stairs to the common room and sent Steve a quick text about how Peter was fast alseep, and then asked Jarvis to call Natasha. She denied his call, and he was offended for a few moments before he realized that she was probably still out with Barton. So instead, he grabbed his shitty duffle and threw it into the guest bedroom, and did the dishes. He went to the gym and trained his ass off and tried calling Natasha at least four more times, and she still didn't answer.
He shrugged, again, because he was horribly unhelpful sometimes. "That Tony didn't protect you, and then shrugged your injuries off because you heal."
Bucky snagged his keys off the hook, and shot Tony a blank look. "I provide occasional free childcare and something you can never give your own husband, which is a piece of his past."
"Yes," Wanda replied softly. The weight of that seemed to press down on the entire room all of a sudden, and then Bucky gave a low whistle. Even Tony looked a little stunned.
Natasha pressed her lips together in displeasure. They had discussed that Emma's healing powers were unpredictable, but Helen had said she seemed like she was doing fine, and if Emma was really hurt she'd probably be moaning about it rather than insisting she was feeling fine. Bucky would also protest way more to her going out with friends if he didn't think she knew what she was doing.
"That's a dollar in the swear jar for you, Natalia," he said. Her face was a not very rare complexion of 'are-you-fucking-kidding-me', but he only gave the swear jar a glance. She rolled her eyes but got up and stuffed a dollar in the beat up swear jar. Then she went into the living room, grabbed Clint, and walked back into the kitchen.
Again to all my most patient, most wonderful readers: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for being the best and the sweetest!!! The original story now has over a thousand kudos, which?? Me in 2015 is bawling her eyes out with gratitude and I'm over here absolutely mute with awe. You're wonderful. If any of you are still reading, I appreciate and love you, so much.
"Currently with Miss Emma and Captain Rogers in the kitchen, making cupcakes, Sir," Jarvis said, sounding mildly amused. Tony grinned happily, thinking of his little family upstairs. Then he glanced over at Vision, their facial features relaxed like they'd been in the cradle.
She pulled a pair of sunglasses off one of the shelves and shoved them onto her nose. They were cat-eye shaped and plastic pink. She thrust a pair of purple glasses with the same shape onto Damian's face, and pulled him closer so they could look at each other in the mirror.
He shrugged, and sank down on the couch. Darcy tossed her legs into his lap, a worried frown edging in on her gorgeous face.
"Don't be a dick about it," Sam said, and grabbed some more bellpeppers. Kate rolled her eyes, but put her smoothie down and was recruited into peeling garlic cloves.
Pietro had come out enough from his shell to become a little sassy bastard, zigging around the tower like a little speedster. The only one fast enough to spar with him was Bucky, and Bucky really enjoyed putting him in his place. He was eating as much as Thor and simultaneously burning as much as two Steves, so he hadn't gained enough weight since he came to the tower, in Clint's opinion.
"Nobody's going to die of an infection," she said firmly, and Pietro hurriedly moved over so Emma could sling her arm around his neck, along with Clint's. Natasha carefully wrapped her hands around Emma's thigh, and met eyes with Clint so he could see her lips in the dim lighting. "One. Two."
"Not that I know of. Darcy's job is good with the Avengers, so they like that. Her mom's nice, and her brothers and sisters don't seem to hate me or anything. Her brother has kids, like... Real kids."
The pain of going through three floors wasn't all that bad, not really, not as bad as she remembered it. Once they actually stopped crashing, she saw the Hulk's huge shoulders shrinking, becoming less green, until it was Bruce's face she had tucked under her chin instead. He wasn't making any noise, mostly just making very small movements and and clenching his hands where they were right above her shoulders.
"It's too early for that kind of psych talk," Clint declared. He was silent for a while, and then she felt his hand splay out over her ribcage. "Please don't go," he pleaded quietly, and Natasha hated to leave Clint when he just got back from a mission, she really did. It was always a bad time for both of them to be alone.
Natasha pursed her lips, but she seemed pleased by the 'mom' part. Gently, like she was scared she'd just hurt her more, the older redhead brushed a few curls out of Emma's face, and Emma got a determined look on her face. She pulled Natasha onto the couch, and then proceeded to splay out on top of her. Her coppery hair had been tossed out over Natasha's stomach, her arm curled around her waist, and her leg tossed over Natasha's.
"That's like saying how can you make bad coffee! Of course you can make sucky tea," Kate argued, pulling her earbuds out. "Hey Clint. Guess what I hate about the Avengers?"
"Whoah, Natasha," Steve said in his calming Captain America voice, blue eyes a little wide. "It wasn't Tony's fault. It was an accident. Everyone's going to be fine. Okay? No need to fight."
"Hey, all I knew was that there was a person in a box in Tony's workshop, okay, and we love you Tony, but you have a tendency to make things that are alive, with feelings," Emma said angrily from her seat on the couch in the workshop, where she'd been sat when all the adults arrived. "You don't leave a person in a box just because you don't have time for them anymore."
"No seriously. What's the matter?" he asked as he swept her red hair back, diving in and kissing her neck, where he'd love to leave a hickey, but was unable to. Shield didn't like it's agents rolling around in the hay, and the team didn't know. That's how they liked it, really, but it still left him unable to leave hickeys where they could be seen.
As Peter and Natasha chatted, Clint made his way over to Bucky, shooting him a loopsided grin. He had a cut taped shut on his cheekbone, a bruise on his jaw, but he looked fine. Fine enough, concidering.
Clint stacked three pancakes on a platter and handed them to Bucky, who took them out to Emma, before he began making more for the rest of the people sitting by the kitchen table. By the time Steve came into the kitchen, everyone had at least had one pancake. Clint was helping Peter not choke on his own pancake, but the moment the doors opened to reveal Steve, he got up to make more. Damn super-soldiers and demigods and their metabolisms.
"It looks good on her," Wanda said, giving him a challenging look to say otherwise, and Emma beamed up at her.
"Stop cursing around Peter, you know Steve's gonna kick your butt," Bucky said, waving his spatula around.
"No moving until Helen can look at your leg, alright? You should be healing up but that doesn't mean you should put any more weight on it than you need to. We just care about you, okay sweetheart?" Clint sighed, sitting down on the coffeetable.
"Wanda are you sure?" Emma pressed, but the shocked, blissed out look on Wanda's face spoke absolute volumes. "Wow, yeah no. That is not a robot!" Emma shouted back. "What... Why is Tony making a robot anyway?"
"I believe it's the more elusive mahogany-red," Vision said in their now smooth and melodious voice. Emma quite liked that voice.
She turned around and was face to face with the wall full of Lego stuff. She rubbed her hands together and grinned at Damian, who smiled reluctantly at her.
"Gross," Bucky replied and grabbed a rag from the sink, it looked clean enough as he made it damp and crouched down to wipe Peter's hands and then the stepping stool. "What do you wanna eat for dinner?"
"So no tattoos either? Damn. You'd look hot with it, though," she pointed out. He pulled the glasses down just enough so she could see him roll his eyes at her. "Stop it! I'm serious, Dames, you'd look hot!"
"Man, you must be bad at math," Pietro said without any sort of hesitation, but he still looked a little worried, a frown on his face. Natasha snatched the box of bandages out of his hand briskly, ripping one huge pad open.
"She was reluctant at first, but I convinced her," Emma declared, and Damian snorted, giving her a look like he didn't believe that for a second. She laughed and stroked a finger down his cheek. "I've missed your 'that's bullshit' face."
"Oh, you have no clue. She's got zero patience for bigotry and if she decides she wants to whip you into shape, you're getting into her shape, even if you don't want to."
"I don't require food, no," Vision said, and it's voice came out a little less robot-sounding this time, a little more melodious.
"Yeah? You think you'd ever make an honest man out of me?" he asked, finally smiling and looking back at her. Darcy laughed, snorting as she covered her mouth and squeezed his thigh.
"Hamilton Princess & Beach Club is opening Bermuda's first casino. The wealthy British mobster who pushed for the casino to be added is called Angus Russell, and is the one inviting his mobster friends to celebrate. He's got his fingers in pretty much every pie; drug-smuggling, hits, large-scale robberies, child trafficking, pretty much enough to land him every life-sentence, if only someone could catch him. He's got contacts from all over the globe who offer him protection and help him stay under the radar. We need you to get concrete evidence on him, get into his inner circle."
"So you'd trust your daughter with the green rage monster that hurt her but not the people who tried to rescue her?" Bruce questioned. Both Clint, Natasha, and Betty immediately opened their mouths to protest that, and he waved them silent again. "Look, I know no people in this toiwer who are better equipped to deal with your walking disaster of a child after you, other than Steve and Tony. I say walking disaster very lovingly. Maybe Bucky, but Bucky is also a walking disaster most of the time, no offense."
"No." She decided on the dress and yanked her loose sweater over her head, her sweats joining it on the floor. Bucky respectfully looked away. "Clint owes me. He's lost so many bets to me that I decided I wanted a 'swanky' restaurant as payment." She wriggled into the red dress and struggled to zip it up all the way up. "A little help?"
"Hi baby. Miss us?" Steve asked as Tony kissed Peter's cheek and got a smooch on the nose back. Peter made a very childish noise, a 'mhm' that Bucky thought could only be achieved with a pacifier in his mouth. Apparently not.
"I don't mooch," Bucky said decisively as they stepped out on the common floor. Tony was by the kitchen island, looking like he hadn't slept at all last night, and was considering putting his coffee in an IV-drip, if only he could still get a taste of it.
"They're gonna shoot you," she told the Hulk in a low voice, looking for any recognition on his features as he breathed heavily. "You can just stop now. Let Bruce take over. You don't have to get hurt. Nobody does."
Of the two, Natasha was better at patching people up, but she still wasn't a medic. She did what she could with the wounds to Emma's shoulders and back, but once she came to the rebar, she hesitated.
He handed Peter two of the cupcakes with Natasha's seal on them, but skipped the arc reactor one. It was basically a sugarbomb, and Bucky knew enough about kids to know that they practically climbed walls after having too much sugar. He wasn't plucking Pete off the ceiling, that's for fucking sure.
"Sup, man? Dealing with Peter okay?" he asked, and eyed the pancake that was currently in the pan hungrily.
"You're right," Bucky agreed, without looking up from the pan. Clint got up and grabbed some of the food. "Bishop, Wilson, get your asses in gear and chop me some vegetables. Put the goddamn smoothie down, what is this, a café?"
"She's pissed, and she has all the right in the world to be. I'm gonna be relatively neutral until she and Tony try to fight it out, because I'd like to keep living here. Hard to squeeze so many people into a bachelor pad," he joked, and could hear Kate's eyeroll from by the counter.
"Riiight. Guadalajara. The Hershey thing?" Natasha nodded, and he hummed. "I barely remember anything from that mission."
"Is Peter a mission to you?" Shit. The way Natasha said it made him inwardly cringe. He was glad that he couldn't see any anger in her features though, he'd trained her well. A sick sense of pride settled within him.
"I just wanted to apologize on Tony's behalf," Steve began, and Clint held a hand up, because not only was he super-tired, he was also super-tired of Steve's puppy eyes. The other man's eyes widened in surprise.
"Dr. Cho, thank you for rushing over here in the middle of the night," Steve said as soon as Tony had filled him in, stepping around his husband to face her.
"Oh, poor Peter whenever he gets a significant other, they better be well prepared to handle the lot of you," Emma tossed back without hesitancy, and Tony grinned.
They stayed silent, for a while, only Peter's car noises droning out the silence, until Peter piped up.
"Is he sentinent?" Clint asked, and Wanda's eyes flashed scarlet as she stared with big eyes at the android.
As soon as Victoria spotted Clint, she meowed and jumped onto his legs, claws out, giving him a look like he better save her from the goddamn dog or she was going to flip her shit.
She exchanged a dollar for quarters at a nearby store, and got some candy from one of the little machines lined up in the middle of the mall. They were shaped like different fruits, and Clint called them Runts, and Emma hated the grape flavored ones. When she popped a handfull in her mouth, she made a grossed out face, and Damian sighed long-sufferingly.
After there'd been a lockdown in the tower, or a battle, or anything distressing where his teammates and friends could be hurt, Steve usually got very... Clingy. First it had been his teammates he clung to, and then when Bucky moved in, it was him. When he and Tony became involved, it was most often him. Now, though, it was mostly Peter, because Peter was not only a child, but he also wasn't a superhero.
"Well, we don't all work the same. Wanna know something?" he asked, spinning around in his chair again to look at her. Emma nodded. "I technically flunked third grade."
small, he'd forgotten) pajama pants. Tony wasn't even wearing a shirt, clearly not as eager to leave as he'd made it sound like over the phone.
She tilted her head at Vision, and shoved her twin with her toe again. "No. I think it's sweet. More effort than you make."
"We gotta put these in the freezer soon," Bucky said as he coaxed the frosting can out of Peter's small hands. He turned his doe eyes on Bucky.
"I go to a public school because I demanded to. Most of my clothes come from Target. I don't have any solid-gold items, or any of Tony's credit cards. I know the numbers to mom's, though her credit is questionable, and despite being offered a couple of times, I don't own a car, or a motorcycle, or anything like it. I don't know if I'd call myself spoiled by Tony's riches."
"That's what I like to hear," Bucky said with a wink, before moving towards the fridge for some juice.
"'S that such a good idea?" he asked as Natasha ran her hand through his hair, turning around in his embrace.
Hank Pym showed up in a flurry an hour or two after lunch, eyes just as wide and amazed as Tony's, and Emma stuck around the workshop as more and more scientists dropped in, some in Stark-Labs coats and one dude who was apparently named Reed Richards, and could twist his body like a piece of silly putty.
cook. Peter crawled up on the counter of the kitchen island and ate up there, because frankly, why the fuck not, and talked aimlessly about this kid named Wade that's really nice to him but really mean to other kids. Bad dad, sick mom, but he's really nice to Peter for some reason.
I'm sorry for disappearing again!! First there were exams, and then a dry spell, and then I just couldn't really grasp what I wanted to do with the story. I'm back now though! I will definitely not manage a schedule like I usually do, but I'll try to get some chapters out as soon as I can! Sorry about the delay, and thank you for being awesome and patient and great!!! I love you and your support so much!!!
"If you consider my boobs a limb, fine." That made Damian's lips twitch like he was surpressing a smile, which Emma considered a win. She grinned at him. "Answer me."
"You barely slept. I barely slept because of that. Hence, I'm napping, so you're napping. Simple as that," he said simply. Natasha pursed her lips, but didn't fight him on it. Clint internally fist-bumped himself in victory, before glancing over at Pietro's bag of doritos. "Is that your first meal of the day?"
"Oh my god, oh my god, I hurt you! I hurt you," Bruce gasped, his hands immediately going for her head and her shoulders. Emma batted his hands off.
Dinner was quick, mac and cheese because Bucky wasn't a constant overachiever, and then he put the tiny kiddo to bed. He read Peter Pan again, and tucked Peter in.
Darcy was curled up on the couch, glasses on and in sweatpants and one of his sweaters. On the coffee table stood a mug of hot tea, and a bunch of papers were scattered over the whole wooden surface, along with several highlighters in different colors. Her hair had been pulled away from her face with a clip, and she was squinting at the papers like they were currently the bane of her existence. Victoria was curled up on the other side of the couch, asleep.
And then he roared again. Emma turned tail like a rat, scurrying across the whole training room like they were playing cat and mouse, and that was probably what he thought, that this was a game, and not life and death. That was cool. Emma could work with that. Bruce Banner, one of her favorite uncles, was still in there, still underneath all that, and she could do this if it meant he could go back to being him without anybody hurting him or tranquing him.
"Really, James? Last time I heard you talk about your weekend with Peter, you were scared shitless," she reminded him.
"Oh, young love. Don't be out too late, and don't get pregnant. Your mom would absolutely kill me, even more than she already wishes she had," he grinned, but the tightness around his eyes said it wasn't a hundred percent a joke.
"Is it really moochin' if I'm not allowed to legally leave the premises?" Bucky asked, getting batted at by Victoria in his lap.
"You've been following me since I got here, and now you're going to stop," Damian said, his voice sharp and holding no argument.
"Think of the children, Stark," Bucky said with a mocking headshake, and his grin turned into a smirk.
Tbh, I feel like I've written Natasha a little too soft lately, so I wanted to counter it with some fighting. She feels like she could take down all the Avengers if she really wanted to, but hasn't had a reason to, yet? Is that just me who thinks that? Share your thoughts!
"C'mon, c'mon," she said, and saw the glass crack underneath her fingers just in time for the bot's eyes to snap open, and then there was a sudden burst of light and Wanda screamed, loud enough that it sounded like a siren, clutching her head.
"Of course, Agent Romanov," he said sweetly, and Natasha narrowed her eyes at him over her shoulder as the doors closed again.
"Bruce? With me?" she asked gently, stroking a hand over the jumping muscles in his shoulders soothingly. He made a whimpering noise, and Emma gently hushed him again, looking around them. They'd landed somewhere she didn't recognize off the top of her head, which suggested it was one of those places in the tower where people actually worked. It was currently entirely dark, probably because it was like two am, but the little lights flashing in front of Emma's eyes suggested she shouldn't be straining her eyes trying to look into the dark.
Emma grinned as she pulled the zipper down and shimmied out of the dress. She tried on a few shirts and a skirt with flowers printed on it. Finally, she bought the skirt, and a shirt with stars all over it. The dress was put back on its rack, even if Damian looked at it with a scheming look on his face.
"Kiddos," Clint sighed loudly. "C'mon. Emma, apologize for being mean, Pietro, let her know where she can find her socks."
"Jarvis, cut Vis off from the internet fully, before they catch another cold," Tony muttered, watching the output that had come out as Vision tried to fight the virus off.
"Bucky's a hero!" he said happily and with such conviction that Bucky nearly bought it. "Papa and dada tell me about how he helps beats the bad guys all the time!"
When Helen and Natasha stepped out, he brightened. Natasha was his favorite aunt, though Darcy could give her a run for her money some days. Helen was wearing the same polka-dot bathrobe she'd arrived in, but now her hair was a little more smoothed out. Natasha looked freshly showered, wearing a black t-shirt and yogapants, along with a fairly murderous glare that Peter didn't even seem to notice.
"Peter. Let me in," he said, louder this time. Then he remembered a trick Pepper used on Stark all the time. "I'm giving you to the count of three to let me in," he said, trying his best to sound stern and not pissed off. "One." There was some scrambling behind the door. "Two. Th-"
Tony tried to grab her out of the air a couple of times, trying to rescue her and stand in the Hulk's way, but Emma was getting a workout she hadn't had since last time she tried to run away from someone, and wouldn't catch his hand. The adrenaline was pumping through her body, her powers making her otherwise shaky hands steady and helping her calculate her trajectory as she jumped away from yet another ruined wall.
"Already rebelling! Good for you," Emma said, patting his shoulder without really thinking. Immediately, Vision returned the gesture, patting her shoulder. Emma grinned. "Attagirl. Or- boy? I don't know. You're a robot. What do you identify as? You don't even have genitals. Do you? Ah, I don't wanna think about Tony making a robot dick!"
"C'mooon, it's just for today! I'm going out with my friends later, and it looks so good on me!" Emma whined, leaning away from the older girl's hands.
"I just had some when I got here, but if you wanna stop for some, I'm down," Emma said, with that knowing look on her face.
"Yeah, soon. I think Damian might be picking me up? We'll see," she said, pulling her phone out of her pocket and disappearing back into the elevator. Clint rolled his eyes heavenwards.
"Hey, Bruce. How are you feeling? You doing alright?" she asked, smiling at him. He gaped a little, and then frowned, giving her a concerned look.
"Or go get me a coffee from the cafeteria. Otherwise, I'm taking this rubberband hostage and the liberty of snapping it on your person," Sharon threatened, and Clint pouted.
They stopped at a gas station, and grabbed some snacks in the store while he loaded up the tank. While they waited, Emma swung up on the bike, ripping open her bag of Doritos.
"In a secondary capacity, fine," Natasha said, meeting his eyes and holding them. "Can we trust you?"
s seal of approval on that we're not being overprotective, Captain America's! We're just being plain ole' protective, and you're gonna suck it up, young lady," Clint ranted as Bucky plopped her down on the couch.
moments? This is one of them. I need his brain, which means I can't let you beat him up," he said very quickly, smiling down at her. "Defend Vision's choice as much as you want, you know I'm all here for it, but educational moments. Okay? Please?"
Instead, he called Darcy and was once again surprised at the genuine glee in her voice as she spoke to him.
"Hey, I didn't make this one. This is on Tony, Bruce, Helen, and Pym. Alright? I have zero control over this one. The other two... Well," Clint made a so-so motion with his hand.
"Can't hear you, sweetheart," he sighed, and Emma turned a little so she could move her hands and he could see her face, making the sign for B and then 'grumpy'. "Oh, Bucky? He's in one of the safe-capsules with Darcy, and since Darcy's got Pete, with him too. They're safe."
"Your man calls," Bucky said very sarcastically, and Steve's ruffled hair appeared above the counter, his face still a little flushed.
"Yup. The car is ready to go, too," Tony said, his look still locked on Peter. Ah. This was probably the longest they'd had to part with Peter for in a long time, and both were pretty nervous. Well, never let it be said that Bucky wasn't a thoughtful friend. Kicking his best friend and spouse out of their own home would be his pleasure.
Damian turned his head, and Emma put a finger on his chin to tilt it so he was at a more kissable angle. She pressed their lips together and tasted his DQ smoothie as well as the tea he'd probably had before he came here.
"Hey, Vision, your dad's looking for you," Clint said when he'd wrapped an arm around Emma's shoulders.
"Like upstairs, helping Steve make dinner, or, I don't know, studying for your science test?" Tony challenged. Emma groaned, but slipped off his workbench.
"Were they now?" he said, raising his eyebrows at his tiny accomplice. Peter nodded seriously with toast in his mouth, and Bucky hummed. "Can't say I didn't see that coming. Was it gross?" Peter made a little 'euw' noise through his food to confirm, and Bucky smiled as he sipped his coffee.
Damian pursed his lips at her when she beamed and dumped the candies in his palm. As thanks, she kissed his cheek, and he tutted at her but ate the candy anyway.
Bucky didn't close the door all the way, wanting to be able to hear any commotion but still wanting to give the kid some peace.
"I appreciate it. However, I don't want him to dislike you more than he already does, and also it was like... 170 dollars or something. Like, crazy expensive," she pointed out.
"Yeah, I'll let Jarvis know where you can find me, sweetheart," Tony said with a wink his husband's way, and Steve smiled back at him. Kate wolf-whistled, and Tony laughed before he stepped around Natasha into the elevator, sipping his coffee.
Finally, they walked around Claire's. Emma looked at different earrings. She had pierced ears since before she was orphaned and genetically altered, but she didn't think she'd be able to pierce herself now without severe consequences.
His shit was already packed, the duffle waiting in the guest room a level above them, and now that Peter's parents were back, Bucky didn't feel like he needed to stay acutely. Tony handed Peter off to Steve, deciding to deal with Darcy now as she explained whatever she needed help with, and Bucky was just about to slip away when he heard Peter making his distressed noise. It was amazing that the kid had so many distinguished noises.
"Barton," Damian said, sighing as he slung an arm around her. "Are you aware of how many zeroes are in a billion?"
"Can we make pancakes?" Peter asked, and Bucky was a little bit too shocked to remember basic words to confirm that they could, so he just nodded, and let himself be led up the stairs to the kitchen.
"Your Aunt Tasha and Uncle Clint had to go. You're stuck with me, kiddo," he said as he walked into the living room. Peter was sitting up in the couch, rubbing his eyes.
"Christ, Buck, what are you, a walking safe?" Clint asked with a laugh as he dug a crumpled dollar out of his pocket, shoving it into the jar. Bucky shrugged.
"You're worse than Grayson in the cereal aisle," Damian complained, but his eyes shone with nothing but patient adoration, and Emma reveled in it, laughing and smooching his cheek whenever she wasn't busy picking up the next cool thing she laid her eyes on.
"That explains so much, and I can't believe you know that," Clint said thoughtfully, and crossed his arms over his chest.
Now happy, Peter looked up at Bucky with a blinding, truly innocently happy child's smile, and it was strange to see it directed at him. The last time a kid had smiled at him like the world is all right, was when he was training the girls in the Red Room. The girl had smiled at him with bloodstained teeth after beating a man enough according to his standards. She didn't last very long into the program, surprisingly.
With his precious cargo having been dropped off in her parents' bed, Bucky made his way down to his own apartment floor. Talking to Emma seemed to help his mind sort things out. She knew him pretty well, sometimes even better than he felt he knew himself. Steve was his best friend, of course, but Emma was something else entirely.
Natasha waltzed into the room in jeans and a black tee, giving Clint a look over her shoulder when he shuffled into the room.
"You bet, sweetheart. We'll bust him out of the box," he agreed, grabbing her hand and pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "How about a bed? Yours or ours?"
"What can you tell me about rumors that Brucie Wayne is about to retire and let Tim Drake-Wayne take over W.E.?" the man tossed out as he snapped a few more pictures. Emma saw Damian's look go darker, and his eyes narrow.
"See you tonight! Love you!" she called before the doors closed. "Hey, is he still upset about the Hulk going after me?"
