Dean shakes his head, scrubbing angrily at his eyes. “What if this is my life now?” he whispers, his voice scratchy. “What if I never swim again? What if this is all I am? Just a broken, pathetic mess?”
Ash stops, body sinking into the recliner as if he is a puppet whose strings were cut. He buries his face in his hands, silent sobs shaking his body. Dean watches and his heart breaks, torn between anger at Ash, anger at the situation, and a desperate need to comfort his friend. Unable to tolerate it anymore, he walks to the fridge and yanks it open. He stands, staring inside for a moment before pulling out two bottles of water and slamming the door.
Ellen flips a few pages. "There is a lot of pressure on you to get back in the pool."
Dean’s breath catches in his throat as he realizes where this is going. “Yeah, you can,” he answers carefully.
Dean steps back to give her room to pull the door open and he watches as she crosses the room. His attention is pulled away from Ben to the man Jody is talking to. Jody says something to him that makes him look up at Dean through the window and Dean can’t look away. His eyes are the clearest, brightest blue Dean has ever seen, like the Grabber Blue of a ’69 Mustang. They’re set off by a tousled mess of dark brown hair. It looks like he’s either just rolled out of bed or has gone a round or two with one of his students, and Dean’s fingers itch to feel what it’s like to delve into that hair. Dean figures it’s long enough to offer a pretty good grip.
Nothing happens. Castiel continues to stare right through John. Dean continues not to move.
John's eyes land on the box.
Except when Dean gets out a trash bag, Dad says, "Dean."
NEXT WEEK: dean and jack have a movie marathon, sam and dean finally talk about flagstaff, dean and john DON'T talk about flagstaff, and john finally gets his moment alone with castiel. see you then, and as always, THANKS FOR READING!!!
"I—" Dean clamps his mouth shut before he can say something stupid like
He stalks out of the storage room and into the hallway. The newly-repaired door slams itself shut behind him hard enough to shake the walls. John even thinks he hears the lock click shut.
No, no, no. They can't be. This is Dean's worst fear come to life. Michael perks up at the sudden drop of Dean's stomach, and the pounding on that door in his head makes perfect time with the racing of his heart. The gratitude Dean felt for Sam on the ride home is starting to fade; Dean's back to wanting to shout at him,
Cas says, "If it was too much..."
Good God. "No way," Dean agrees. "Look, most angels are dicks, but Cas, uh—he ain't like most angels. He's just a guy." He adds, hoping to win Dad over, "He's always nice to Mom."
Dean's hands squeeze reflexively around the wheel. "Nah," he says. He struggles a moment and then says, "Hell, Cas, I can't sleep with Sam in there giving Mom the talk. I think—I think maybe he figured out about Flagstaff."
Dean can't believe she remembers that, considering everything else that was going on at the time. He shrugs, rolls up his own sleeves, and gets to finishing the dishes Cas missed, just to have something to do with his hands.
John sighs. "Yeah," he agrees, and gets out of her way so she can leave. She takes the mug with her.
Dad looks absolutely mortified. "Well, we do," he mutters into the shocked silence, and ducks into the nearest doorway, neatly taking himself out of the room.
"Okay," Cas agrees quietly, like he's marveling at something. Dean feels him shift, and slip off his trench coat. In a moment it's draped heavy and warm over Dean's shoulders, and Cas holds him, one arm snug around Dean's waist, his other hand resuming its place at the back of Dean's head, stroking his hair. "Okay."
that kind of thing. He's not...okay with it, if that's what Sam's hoping for. He's never going to be okay with it. It disgusts him to even think about. His stomach physically turns every time he remembers.
Behind him Cas stands. They can all see the blood on his mouth, Dean realizes, panicking. Dad's disgusted stare, cocked by a horrible ninety degrees, is the worst of all. They know he was looking. They saw him looking at Cas, and now they all know, they all see him, they all see him, they all
Dean doesn't. "Cas, I was so fucked up—"
that i love very much. if you want more songs than that, both of these are on my
That's twice now, for Sam. The first time, part of John had been secretly glad—not that the girl had died, not that his son was suffering, but that Sammy would at least
Sam finishes with the candles. "I'll do the honors." He brings out his Zippo and lights them up. "I'd say make a wish, but Dean's wish is what got us into this mess in the first place."
Dean exhales. Cas's shoulders relax, mirroring Dean's relief.
Finished with him?
"People probably died while he was playing house with us," Dean says. He thinks about that a lot. "It was a fucked up thing for me to do. My dad wasn't a monster. Or if he was, I was just as bad."
"Yeah, Dad dumped a hell of a lot of crap on me," Dean says. "And I won't say there wasn't some of it that sucked. That I never had a moment where all I wanted to do was get in the car and drive and never look back. Hell, sometimes just making it through the day felt like the hardest thing I ever did. But most of the time I was so damn grateful."
Just as Dean knew they would, the weeks do stretch into months, and then into a year. Grief never gets easier, Dean knows from experience, but you do get better at it. After all, you can get used to anything.
(EDIT: he also drew the incredible art in THIS chapter, which you can see
Sam does neither, but in a moment, it stops mattering: John Winchester appears at the end of the hall, looking every bit as furious and scared as Dean is. If Dean had any doubts about whether the prayer he heard was real before, they're gone now.
Yeah, no. Dean would rather face down a horde of angry demons than let them finish that conversation. He clears his throat as he enters the kitchen, making as much noise as he possibly can.
Dean's heart is in his throat. His pulse pounds in his ears. "You can't be."
Castiel is seriously injured, but it was a hard punch, with an angel's strength—hard enough to send us stumbling. Even with his failing grace, Castiel managed to surprise us. In one swift movement he rolls, scooping up the abandoned archangel blade, and plunges it through our heart. The pain blinds us—the terror is even worse—
"Hey," Sam jumps in. He touches Dean's shoulder lightly. "Dean, man, why don't you go take a walk? Go find Cas. Get some shut-eye or something. We're okay here."
It's cold, dark, and silent inside the bunker. The red emergency lights flicker on and off like the last stuttering beats of a heart about to be crushed inside your fist. Dean stalks through the corridors, searching, searching—
," Dean says. His father is on his way into this library right now, and he's going to have more than a few questions about Dean's little Anastasia Steele moment. "Quick, get these off, don't worry about the movie—"
do?" he demands. "You said
Dean finally turns his head in Cas's direction to give him an appraising look. "That obvious, huh?"
Just there. Dean sits stock-still, his brain turning itself inside-out.
"What the hell was that?" he demands of Jack. "You just vaporized two dozen vampires in a second!"
"I don't know what you want from me," John confesses. "I fucked up. I can't make it right. You're..." He doesn't want to say
"No!" Dean shouts, but when Jack's got his mind set on something there's no stopping him. Raw power rolls off of him in waves, the kind that always makes Dean's ears pop, and one by one the vampires begin to disintegrate. They don't even leave dust behind.
Cas narrows his eyes back. He gives Dad the cordial, unimpressed kind of look that usually precedes an ass-kicking—or a smiting.
. Dean could say whatever he wanted and still get whatever he wanted—whatever that even is—and then in like a week max he'd be spared from ever having to deal with any of the fallout, because he'd be stuck on the ocean floor. The thought of ditching Cas like some cheap prom date makes Dean's stomach turn. He doesn't wanna use Cas like that. But he could. There's nothing stopping him. It doesn't matter about Michael or those other guys; Cas would let him do anything.
So they're good dreams, in spite of everything. They're good memories. There isn't much comfort to be had when Dean is caging an archangel inside his head, but he'll take what he can get.
"Your brother," Mom answers. "He made the eggs. But I mean, if there's anything worth learning to cook, it's obviously going to be bacon."
. They were only ever one CPS visit away from getting split up for good, after all. But the only lesson Dean learned was that he must never again get caught stealing. So he resorted to something else. Because when he got caught doing
Hmm. We look up. "And what'll you give us for it?"
How did he find out?
What did John love about Mary? Her bravery, her spirit, her kindness. That she loved the Beatles and had a wonderful singing voice even if she always hit the notes off-key, that she'd read everything Tolkien ever wrote cover-to-cover about a hundred times and was so easy to embarrass about it. That she was bossy and drove too fast and didn't like cats. That she had a right hook that could lay a man flat, and that she never started fights but always finished them. That she could out-cuss every Marine that John had ever met but never let a bad word slip unless she damn well meant to.
Castiel starts to explain, to say that neither Ben nor Dean is
Dean skims one hand down Cas’ chest, ghosting over his nipple and elicitng a groan that Dean swallows down as soon as it surfaces. He curls his fingers around Cas’ hip, biting back his own moan when Cas nips at his lower lip, the little shot of pain fading into pleasure. Breath coming quicker, he tugs at Cas’ shirt, pulling it free from his waistband until he can splay his fingers against bare skin.
“Oh yeah, definitely,” Garth gushes. Everyone knows the slender man for his bubbling enthusiasm, which makes him perfect for this group. At ages eight to eleven, these kids have been swimming long enough the novelty has worn off, but they lack the commitment of the older students. They’re not ready to train for competition.
Meg rolls her eyes. “Can’t you just talk like a normal person for once? Just say that he wants to jump your bones.”
Cas squeezes his hand. “It will be fine, Dean. You do beautiful work and everyone knows it. Soon Mr. Crowley will know it too.”
Meg glances over at Zar before settling herself against Cas’ chest, arms wrapped around his waist. She laughs softly. “I know how you feel. Do you think I wanted this asshole?”
He turns his head on the pillow so that he can watch Dean sleep. His long lashes flutter against his softly freckled cheeks, making him look years younger without the weight of the responsibilities he carries when he’s awake. Cas’ throat tightens when he thinks about how he almost messed this up, how close he came to losing Dean completely.
Ben keeps one arm around Dean’s neck for a few moments, then turns and says something that makes Dean shake his head. Ben repeats it more forcefully and Dean finally acquiesces, standing and walking back to where Castiel is standing.
Castiel looks down to where his fingers are intertwined with Will’s. It feels good to not have the urge to pull away from him, but Castiel doesn’t particularly want to take the risk of walking into a place with Will that he so closely associates with Dean. It seems immature to feel that way, but he can’t shake it. He just isn’t sure how to say that without making it sound like he doesn’t want to extend their time together.
Unloading the van at the club goes quicker, both because Raphael helps and because his girlfriend meets them there. Castiel snags Dean to help him set up his drum set, and Dean hands him the pieces as he points at them. Every time Castiel takes a piece of the kit from Dean, he brushes his fingers against Dean’s, sending a shiver skittering through Dean’s body. By the time they’re finished, Dean is so keyed up he would say yes if Castiel invited him into the bathroom for a quickie, consequences be damned.
When Castiel shifts, pulling his fingers out and sitting up, Dean lets out a whimper. Castiel places a firm hand on his stomach and murmurs, “I’ve got you, Dean. It’s okay. I can’t wait anymore.”
Dean shakes his head. “Don’t have to, but I want to. I meant it when I said this is important to me, Cas. I need you to know where we stand.”
Dean sighs. He should have known better.
“I can put her outside if she bothers you.”
During the ride home, Dean turns the radio on and fiddles with the tuner, so the conversation inevitably turns to music. When he pulls the big black car into the driveway, Castiel feels a pang of disappointment. He doesn’t want the evening to end.
“Not so sure about your toy chest, though,” he mutters between kisses. “Or at least not all of it.”
Castiel gives a small nod. “Of course.”
Meg chuckles. “So like kissing your sister?”
Dr. Harris purses his lips. “Don’t be a martyr. If you’re in pain, you’re more likely to experience dizziness and nausea, putting you at risk for secondary injury. My concern is not only for the blunt force trauma. Oxidants build up when your brain goes without oxygen, and they can continue to cause damage long after the injury. We won’t know for several more weeks how your brain chemistry has been affected. The more pain you are in, the more your body produces hormones to counteract it, and it will take longer for your body to display its current level of functioning.”
“Then what’s it about?”
Standing to head into the bathroom, Dean feels something crinkle under his foot. With a chuckle, he reaches down and plucks the strip of condoms off the floor, twirling them in his fingers. Heat rushes through him at the memories of the night before. Cas on top of him, mouth hot and insistent on his cock, Cas moving under him, the feel of his body squeezing around him. He runs the fingers of one hand down his rapidly hardening length. Maybe Cas will be up for round two in the shower.
“Balthazar,” Castiel warns.
Spinning around and executing a perfect block on the young Jedi facing him, Dean finds himself face-to-face with the black haired woman who was in Ben's meeting with Cas. She's wearing a smirk, one eyebrow cocked as she watches him hand the lightsaber back sheepishly. “Uh, Meg, right?” he says, giving her and the diminutive soldier next to her a military salute.
Dean pulls him in for a light kiss and Cas lets himself get lost in it. He hasn’t been with someone so comfortable with public affection since Michael, and he tells himself that Dean’s reluctance to put words to his feelings isn’t as important as his behavior. Dean’s casual touches and kisses make him feel wanted in a way he hasn’t in over a decade.
Ash is still standing just inside the door, his posture wary, like he isn’t sure if Dean brought him here to talk or to fight. After a moment, he shrugs and walks over the work bench. He fiddles with the bench vice and then says, “I guess so. Remember the first time we snuck a six-pack out of Bobby’s cooler? Between my parent and your dad, I wasn’t sure who was gonna get the first lick in.”
Dean lets go of Cas’ hands to grasp his cheeks. He cradles Cas’ face between his palms, stubble prickly against his skin, and brushes the tears away with his thumbs. Throat burning as he tries to hold back the tears stinging his own eyes, he leans in and presses his forehead to Cas’. Their eyes meet and hold. “He was full of shit. You are not broken; you’re perfect just the way you are. I want to be with you.” Huge words strangle him, threaten to come out and engulf them. It’s too soon, too much, too fast, but he takes a deep breath and says them anyway. “I love you.”
“I’m not saying he doesn’t love you, Dean. But that’s not enough. It wasn’t enough with Cassie or Lisa either. You just let other people do what they want, and then when it doesn’t work out it’s not your fault,” Sam continues.
Once the lids are securely glued to the corn syrup, water, and glitter filled bottles, Meg helps the children collect their holiday project packets and reunite with their parents. Unsurprisingly, Ben’s bottle has swirls of royal purple with silver and blue glitter that make it look like a galaxy. When he shakes it for Dean, his father gives his first genuine smile of the evening.
Castiel sneaks another look at the man. The shorter guy standing next to him says something that makes him grin, but he doesn’t look away. He narrows his eyes slightly and Castiel is fairly certain he’s been caught. He quickly glances back down. “Meg, I’m not here to pick up a man.”
Pain and fear war with hope and love to point that Dean can barely tell the emotions apart. “I know. I’m sorry, too. For everything.” He takes a deep breath. “You lied to me, Cas,” he says, then barrels forward when Cas gasps and starts to respond. “You said that we would be upfront with each other. You made me promise. You said that we would talk about things when they happened and I’ve been trying to do that. It’s really fucking hard and I’m shit at it, but I’ve been trying. I know I should have let you know as soon as Ash showed up that night, but you didn’t keep up your end either. If you had just knocked and come in that morning, I could have shown you that nothing happened, that you’re who I want. It would have saved us all a lot of pain.”
“Do you want a drink? There are a few bottles of beer left.” That was obviously not what Ash was expecting, because he looks even more nervous now. “I was led to believe you liked beer, but I also have wine, orange juice, milk, or water if you’d prefer.”
“I hate you both.” Charlie stalks over and executes a smooth dive into her lane. She comes up fifteen feet from the edge and ignores them.
Dean takes the edge of the wrapping paper and carefully rips across the top of the package. Inside is a plain cardboard box. He pulls the last bits of paper away and lifts off the lid. There’s a moment of shocked silence, then a gasp.
“Hey,” Dean says softly, his expression softening when he sees Castiel. He looks exhausted, more tired than Castiel has ever seen him. He walks to the couch and leans down to give Castiel a kiss that is more comfort than it is passion.
Dean has always enjoyed sex, and his partners haven't complained, so he figures he must be okay at it. He and Cas sometimes spend hours making out, and Dean has no complaints about that either. He can’t shake the feeling, though, that something is wrong.
“The legs didn't itch when you put it on before,” Dean tries. “What's different?”
“Cas? Why does everyone keep askin’ me that?”
Ash grins and holds up one of the boxes. “They’re electronics kits. The modules all snap together and he can make all kinds of stuff. Some guys I knew at MIT came out with them.”
There’s a pause long enough to indicate that Castiel is supposed to have something to say to this. “Okay? If that’s your point, Gabriel, it’s an obtuse one.”
At 6’4” and built like a moose, it’s not hard for Dean to pick out his younger brother amongst the crowd. Sam is standing at the bar holding two beers. Dean waves and Sam uses the beers to motion him to a booth along the back wall where Benny and Garth are already waiting.
Things aren’t any more perfect there than they are with Cas, but they’re a lot better than they used to be. Rather than being a shell where they rattle around barely interacting, the house has become a gathering point for the extended family.
Ben starts to make a low keening noise in his throat, so Dean holds him tighter against his chest. He cups Ben’s head with his other hand, trying to block out the sound while Ava glances through the curtain and makes a hurry up motion at Garth. Dean knows his breath is coming more rapidly and he can feel his heart racing so he takes a deep breath to calm himself down. The last thing Ben needs is for Dean to lose it too.
: the physical altercation involves john putting his hands on dean one time (not deliberately violence, but he roughly grabs him), and gets clocked real quick for his trouble. re-enactment of abuse is michael kicking more than one character in the ribs to deliberately invoke the memory of flagstaff. the extreme violence warning is due to multiple stabbings, broken bones, and at one point a character gets their hand melted off. along with the suggestively violent language mentioned above (sam gets called a LOT of bad names re: his history with possession), michael also makes suggestive moves towards all the other characters except jack - he presses dean against a wall, breathes on his neck, and touches his face; cuts sam's collarbone/neck with an angel sword; winks at mary and grabs her by the hair; and leers at cas's mouth. disclosure of personal information is michael outing dean and cas to multiple people, and also disclosing dean's past tricking to another character privately. michael really sounds like a freak when i type it all out like this, good grief. in my defense i've been waiting since 2010 to see him be this scary.
It's been years, but he still remembers how she prefers it. No sugar, a little honey, a lot of lemon, and even more lemon when she feels a headache coming on, despite how counterintuitive that seems. A dash of whiskey, but only on rainy days or when she's crying, which this isn't and she's not, so he leaves it out. The kitchen has everything he needs. Of course; she must have been making her own tea, these past couple of years.
John can't quite meet her eye. "Okay," he agrees, and retreats to the kitchen—but not without one last look over his shoulder at the shut bunker door.
Paranoia that has long dogged John's footsteps reminds him that if it isn't his own instincts that are off, it's Sam and Dean's. No self-respecting hunter, no son of John Winchester's, would shelter monsters if there wasn't something deeper going on. He taught them better than that. Unless—
This is all Dean's fault.
Jack gives him a skeptical look. "I thought it was the other way around."
Sam gives him half a little shrug. "I dunno. I guess you—you hold the pearl, and then concentrate on what your heart desires."
Now they all know.
Behind them all, the most protected, is Lucifer's now-human half-breed. This one no longer has any wings at all. We can perceive only the barest outline of where they were, or would be, or will be, should he live long enough to recover his grace naturally.
Dean spits at us. Snarling, we wipe the mess off of our face and backhand him for the insubordination. This maggot who dared imprison us—he only needs to be mostly alive to be tortured. We stand, kicking him in the ribs. Once, twice, three times, each impact ringing with a distant crack of thunder and bone—
, and the helpless, frustrated exhaustion that comes with repeated failure. Something Dean didn't tell anybody, even Cas, is that he took that beating without protesting or defending himself because he hoped that Dad would kill him.
"Dude," Dean says, flipping on his blinker so he can pull up beside the local grocery, "can we not do any touchy-feely shit, please? That's—"
"We got anything to clean up with in here?" he asks. He can't believe they did this out in the open. Anybody could've caught them.
"No!" Dean says, alarmed. Cas jerks back and Dean drops his voice, trying to explain where Dad won't hear, "The grace, man." The blood loss is bad enough, but add angelic grace to the mix and Dean won't be able to keep Michael in. There's so much grace in him already he's going to explode. "We gotta get the cuffs first."
John blows out a sigh. It's going to be a long ride home. "I missed you too, you know," he says. "More than
John nods at the metal box. The sigils on it look naggingly familiar, but he can't place them. "What's this, some kind of devil's trap?"
Mom hums under her breath. "You're not wrong," she says. "But that doesn't mean it's not hard on you."
Damn it. Best Dean can do is a straight. He sighs and lays them out. "Dude, you're not supposed to beat me on my birthday."
There has never been any sound in the whole world sweeter than the purr of Dean's baby after a long period of being apart. Okay, fine, it wasn't even a whole week this time, but somehow to Dean this week has felt like it's gone on for months, and he missed her almost more than he could stand. Dean roars across the thankfully-plowed roads doing 85, feeling more alive than he has since the day he said yes.
Dean waggles his eyebrows. "R-rated movies."
"Dean—" Cas starts, and Dean jerks away and hits him.
"Uh." Dean clears his throat. "Thanks, I guess."
John's face has twisted in revulsion. We take in every line of his expression, committing it to perfect memory. This is how Dean will remember his father for the rest of his life. "Enough," John says, and struggles to his feet, leaning hard on Mary. "You can tell all the lies you want. I know my son. He wouldn't—he'd never—I didn't raise him to—"
Sam slaps a hand over the volume knob before Dean can get there. "A little," he answers. "I mean, Dean—look, man, you're my brother, but I gotta say...I'm a little disappointed."
There's a pause. Dean swears and buries his face in his hands again, and in his head Michael crows over his victory. There's a lot to hate about possession, but in Dean's opinion, that's the worst part. It's very, very easy to forget where he ends and Michael begins.
"The kind of guy," Sam says slowly, "who breaks his own stupid 'no front seat fucking' rule."
Then one day about a year on down the line Dean wakes up and strolls into the kitchen to find three people at the table—Sam, Eileen, and Cas.
"I don't think," he says, "that you have any right to sit there and tell me that what I did to Sam was worse than what you did to him."
"We'll be lucky if I last a few more minutes!" But Dean is starting to give up hope. He can see it in Cas's eyes: "You're not gonna do it, are you? Not until he takes me."
the premise of this fic: i thought 14.13 did a terrible job of addressing literally anything, and i was also very disappointed that michael was not at all involved with the story. at the same time, i really enjoyed dean's loved ones triangulating around him as his support system when he was quasi-suicidal during the ma'lak box arc. i also found that most of the fanfics about john coming back focus more on either redeeming john or punishing john than they did on addressing dean's needs and his very complex and conflicted feelings about his dad. i combined those thoughts and got this story.
We fly, then, to top of the staircase, taking Castiel with us, metal groaning with the force of our landing. We slip our hand inside Castiel's trench coat and pull the archangel blade out of his pocket. "Thanks, Cas," we say, in a mockery of that moment during the vampire fight, and then turn our attention to the humans, the blade pointed directly at Castiel's heart. "The door!" we demand again. "You are all trying my patience. I can hurt you and heal you as many times as I like. I will make John and Dean torture you until you beg for death, and then deny you."
Numbly, John takes the mop and bucket.
"Who said I wanted to avoid my father?" Dean asks lightly.
"No kidding," John says weakly. He shudders, remembering the feeling of Michael taking him over, of that terrible, cosmic evil bending John to its whim. He used John's body like a weapon and rifled through his memories as easily as reading a book. John's seen a lot of shit, but that tops it all.
, Sam said, but Dean doesn't need to do that because he knows Cas will find him. Instead his feet take him in the direction of the garage. He misses his baby already. Even if he can't drive, he wants to be behind her wheel. He's just wondering if Cas will be there yet and deliberating over whether or not he could get away with doubling back for a beer when ahead of him the garage door opens.
It's a perfect revenge.
And she blames him for that, John knows. She said so in the truck on their way home from the vampire hunt:
relieved Dean's ever been, but it definitely makes the top five. "You did good today, kid," he says, quiet, just for him. "I'm proud of you."
"I already told you what I wanted," Dean adds. Right:
He wishes to God that Cas had never opened his damn mouth.
The Ma'lak box sits against the back wall where John left it. Now John's hands will be the one to destroy it. A squeeze of our fist and the box implodes, metal groaning under the pressure, all the human bolts and welding Dean worked so carefully to perfect becoming useless under the onslaught when the box isn't sealed. We open our fist, and it explodes, the pieces flying out to shatter the glass panels on the back wall, to blow the door of the storage room off its hinges.
, i'm happy to help everyone read safely.
But—yeah, John gets it. Sam's made his point clear: he's interested in actions, not words. He did say that if John was handing out apologies, John shouldn't start with him. John really
had enough alcohol, now or ever.
. if you have a tumblr, please go show these people some love, they deserve it <3
He's not just hallucinating. He's possessed. He's been possessed the whole damn time.
He starts forward and tries to take the mop and bucket out of John's hands, but John hangs onto them. "Yeah," he says quietly. "Yeah, I think I do."
In a second flat Dean's regretting every choice he made that led him to this moment, because now he's fighting on two fronts. Of course his most immediate concern is the vampire cutting off his air supply, but now there's also Michael to deal with. Michael can see and hear everything Dean does, and he has nothing to do while he's trapped in Dean's head other than to prowl around waiting for moments of weakness. As soon as Dean goes down, Michael lets out an earth-shattering scream that only Dean can hear. Sparks dance in front of Dean's eyes. His last thought as the edges of his vision go dark is,
A second ago Dean was furious, imagining Sam saying that to Dad, even under justifiably extenuating circumstances. Now all Dean can think about is Jack looking at Dad's hands the way Dean used to, and Sam standing between Jack and Dad the way Dean used to stand between Dad and Sam, and he's so grateful to Sam he doesn't know what to do with himself.
But if he goes after Dean, he can't stay with Mary. She's covered in blood but with no serious injuries; for a moment, when he heard her cry out, John had gone through the terror of her death all over again, thinking he might be made to witness it a second time. Not even for Dean can John leave her alone with this
But old habits die hard. This is what he used to do to soothe himself, many years ago. This hunt was the rock he turned to in troubled times. And not knowing what's the matter with Dean—yeah, that troubles him. Troubles the hell out of him.
a special sword to kill the devil with, he
And as Dean looks around the room, seeing his whole family together at last, he doesn't know what more he could wish for anyway. He's wanted this since he was four. He used to think being with his family again was an even more ridiculous pipe dream than him living to forty, and finally spending more time on earth than in Hell. But now he has it all. His mom and dad together, even if they're not really
It's just before dinner when John meets Castiel.
We scream as the blade sinks into us.
Thing is, Dean doesn't have a lot of time left. Every painful throb of his head reminds him that each moment could be his last. There's probably no making his peace with Dad, but after the way Dad died before, after how bad it tore Dean up—well, Dean's got to at least try to leave things between them a little better than they were last time, right?
John is about to excuse himself—he doubts very much that he and Sam currently have anything more to say to each other—when Sam guesses, "Extra lemon for the headache, right?"
Mary's face is pressed into his chest. "Long story. It was sort of an accident. I've been back about two and a half years now."
A shotgun cocks. An old, familiar voice whispers, "Don't you move," and an older, more familiar weight settles itself around Dean's neck.
," Dad explains, as though that should be obvious. "You're my son, Dean. I lo—"
Dean likes to work. This same, shitty old world is what they fought to keep, and that's a world that still has monsters in it. It's what he's good at, so that's what he does. Sometimes he works with Sam and Eileen. Sometimes he flies solo. Dean's favorite part of the job is after, when he gets to kick back at a bar and drink and shoot some pool, usually with guys that don't know him from Adam. It's not often he gets to be anonymous anymore. Kind of an unforeseen consequence of one-too-many times saving the world.
Dad can't quite look up from the rainbow sprinkles on his plate. "I'll be here."
Michael's going to break free.
Shit. Dean pulls out one of the chairs and collapses into it. "So it's a no-go," he says dully, pinching the bridge of his nose. Michael's fury has evaporated, replaced by an easy smugness. He knows Dean can't wrestle away control like Sam can. "I've had my shot at Michael twice now, Sam, and I couldn't beat him either time."
John can hardly look at her. He's had nightmares about this, and even those were preferable to this reality—the unshed tears in her voice, the years of pain and betrayal sitting between them. "And now?" he asks.
John narrows his eyes. "Because the Dean in that world said yes too?"
"I've been a dick," Dean decides, hitting upon an idea. He can't stand Cas looking at him like that; they've gotta move on. He gets to his feet, turns his head a little, and taps his jaw with one finger. "So I owe you one, right?"
But, no—Sam twists and picks up an actual mop and bucket from the corner behind him. The bucket is full of red-tinted water. "Go in the kitchen," he says, "and if Dean says you can use the sink, run some clean water with bleach. We gotta get the blood off the floor, because the longer it stays there, the worse it'll stain—especially on the hardwood."
It's a cold night, and their breath fogs in the outdoors. Dean didn't think to grab a coat—it was all he could do to keep that door in his head from giving way—but that's all right. The cold shocks him awake, keeps him in the here and now. No moments of weakness for Michael to take advantage over. No archangel using him as a sword. Not today.
Archangels don't do well in cages. A long imprisonment makes the taste of freedom sweeter; requires a stretch of new arms, a wriggle of new fingers. This body isn't as nice as the last one. But it is used to commanding, and to being respected. It is a face man and monster alike have been frightened of.
Sam makes an abrupt turn right and opens a door marked
If John's being completely honest with himself, he's not ready to face Dean just yet anyway. Dean doesn't know that John knows about what he—what he had to—how he kept food on the table. But everyone heard Michael talk about him and Castiel. No matter how much Castiel threatens him, none of them can pretend not to know that. But though Castiel offered John no assurances when he asked about Dean's wellbeing, Dean must be alive and safe. Nobody in this room would be standing here cleaning if he weren't. John remembers how angry Castiel was at the cut on Dean's cheek the night they met. If Dean had been in any real trouble, he would have gotten healed before John no matter what he asked Castiel to do. Because Castiel—?
"I'm sorry, Dean—"
"Mm," Mary agrees. She sits up to look at him. "More or less. We do a lot of hunting."
. Just you."
Cas is still so close Dean can feel him breathing. "Because he used his powers? Mary and Sam are with him."
Part of Dean is still horrified by all of this. He wants to yell at Sam 'til he's blue in the face. He wants to break his own nose for leaving them alone out there to fight it out without him. But another part of him, a small, traitorous part, sees Dad fall in line like this and wonders if maybe this was the only way. Dean could never have made Dad stop, if he had been the one there during the fight. Dad would have taken a swing at their kid, their very human, very
Sam flips the book in front of him closed. "It means that if you're handing out apologies," he says, and meets John's eye briefly, "I'm probably not the one you should start with." He stands up to return the book to the shelf. "I've got to get back to work. You mind?"
And Sam very nearly does. His jaw works, and his eyes brighten just a little, and he says, in a low and hurting voice, "Dean, he knew—" But as soon as his voice starts to waver he packs it right back in. One short sharp shake of his head, and then all that emotion is suddenly gone. Sam Winchester learned repression from the best in the game, after all. "It doesn't matter anymore," he says. "I told him he had to lay off Jack, that's all. You focus on yourself. You gotta stay zen right now. Was it that close, with Michael?"
"You first." We throw her the same kind of wink she fell for in 1972. "No, Sam Winchester, what tainted you came after your birth. Still her fault though," we add, whispering it viciously into Mary's ear. We look back up at Sam. "It made you the perfect vessel for my brother, but it doesn't mean you can't still say yes to me. Want to take another crack at it? See if you can pull off the same miracle twice?"
Sam has demon blood. He was born human, but now he might be something else, was well on his way to
never broke. When Dean dares to open his eyes again, Dad isn't even looking at him. His head is in his hands.
Mom's already shaking her head. "No, Dean—"
"Is there a reason," John says at last, scrubbing at Dean's potato pot, "that nobody wants to tell me what the hell is going on around here?"
"Don't act so shocked," we whisper into the dark. "This was always going to happen. From the moment he came back, this was inevitable."
Dean looks up.
You only get so many second chances, after all. Dean would be crazy to pass this one up.
For some reason, it looks like Cas is holding back a smile. "Perhaps we can locate another Hand of God," he says. "It wasn't powerful enough to take down Amara, but it should certainly be enough to destroy an archangel. Rowena couldn't find anything in the Book of the Damned to help us deal with Michael directly, but perhaps she could find a way to scry for something that powerful."
And then John realizes: that's why Dean still looks so scared. And not without reason, either. If John had caught Dean with a man when he was a kid—any man, for any reason, but especially a monster—he probably would have done a lot worse than Flagstaff, without caring about the reason at all. John's style has always been to shoot first and ask questions later, and he didn't raise his sons to
Cas's gaze borders too close to pitying for Dean's comfort. "Sam lived with him for eighteen years, Dean. No one is perfect, not even you. If your father truly couldn't control himself, there would have been at least one time where he lashed out at Sam before you could intervene. Dean," he says, tone unbearably gentle, "your father chooses how he behaves, just like everyone else. You can't make everything he does someone else's fault."
He takes another swallow, clenching and unclenching his hand into a fist where it rests on his leg. The rhythmic, repetitive action soothes him. He tries tapping his fingers, one after another, like he’s seen Ben do when he’s agitated. Maybe there’s something to be said for it.
Dean regrets the words at once. So much for keeping his cool, but John has a way of pushing his buttons worse than any other person in the world. Dean cuts off two thick slices and slides them into the toaster before he risks a glance at his father.
The smile only lasts a moment, because Dean suddenly shoves him until they’re both sitting up, inches of space between them. “You can’t—Jesus, Cas. Do you have any idea what you’re doing? You can’t do that.”
Visitor badge pinned to the pocket of his flannel shirt, Dean makes his way to Ben’s classroom. The hallways are already filled with tiny ghouls, superheroes, and princesses milling around. There’s even an eleventh Doctor carrying a replica sonic screwdriver that lights up and makes noise. Dean makes a mental note to ask the kid where he got it.
“Man, I miss listening to you play. Your voice has gotten deeper,” Ash says softly. His blue eyes twinkle with the reflection of the Christmas lights from down the hallway. The way he’s slouched in the doorway, it wouldn’t take more than a slight dip of Dean’s head to press their lips together.
Dean freezes and squeezes his eyes shut, hoping the bleachers will open and swallow him. Mackenzie “Mack” Griffen. Of all the old competitors to run into here, it had to be him.
Dean closes his eyes, but there’s just yawning darkness. He remembers arriving back at the pool in the afternoon, but everything after is a blank. “Don’t remember.”
Donnie leans back against the booth and points his bottle at Dean with a smirk. “When have you ever let that stop you?”
Dean throws his head back and laughs. “You’re kidding me, right? I can’t even imagine that.”
They’ve been skirting the edge of flirting for the last few days. Usually Castiel starts it, but talking to Sam inspired Dean to be more adventurous.
Dean smiles, finally glancing sideways to meet Castiel’s eyes quickly before looking back at the road. “Wouldn’t have offered if I minded, Cas.”
Dean has shared enough information about his childhood previously for Castiel to read between the lines. “Ash represented stability to you. No matter how much your father moved you around, you always knew he was here in Lawrence, that you would be coming back to him.”
keeps playing in his mind on a loop.
As if he’s pulled awake by the weight of Cas’ thoughts, Dean’s eyelids flutter rapidly before they drift open. There’s no confusion on Dean’s face, just a soft smile as soon as his eyes focus on Cas. “Mornin’,” he mutters, his voice a dry rasp.
“Sammy’s good with Ben,” Dean insists.
Dean must sense the movement, because he pulls back, eyes wide as he tracks the way Cas’ tongue flicks out to clean between his fingers. “Holy fuck, Cas,” Dean breathes, and his softening cock twitches against Cas’.
Ash lets out a low whistle as they pull into the driveway and Dean hits the remote for the garage door. “Merry Griswold Christmas,” he teases. “Almost expectin’ you to hit a button and start a light show synchronized to
Three and a half days of near radio silence from Cas is making him edgy. It’s not like they haven’t talked, or texted, at all. Between Dean’s research on good all-season cars and Cas’ messages about upcoming projects at school, they’d texted several times every day and even spoken on the phone twice. It’s not like the weeks after Christmas when they were avoiding each other.
There’s a long moment when there’s just the sound of Cas’ breathing. “I’m not hungry.”
“Benjamin Braedon Winchester, what have I told you about these goddamn Legos!” Dean yells, hobbling the rest of the way down the hallway. “If you can’t keep them off the damn floor, I’m going to throw every last one of them away.”
Dean chuckles softly and slides his hand across the bench seat to brush his knuckles lightly against the back of Castiel’s hand. The touch sends a warm current pulsing through him. He turns his hand over and lets his fingers tangle with Dean’s, only letting go when they pull into the lot next to the restaurant.
Cas flinches at the sharp ache in his chest and bites back a rebuttal.
“It’s fine. I mean, it’s gonna take a while since I’ll only be able to work on it in my spare time, but as long as you don’t mind buyin’ the parts and bein’ without a car, it’s gonna be fun.”
Cas taught summer school his first two years in Lawrence, but it had quickly become too much to handle. Although he enjoys the children immensely, he needs that time over the summer to recharge so that he can come back refreshed in the fall. He knows that Dean has signed Ben up for the part-time program, along with a recreational program at the park, but these last few days could very well be Cas’ last chance to see Ben until next school year. His heart twists painfully.
“Then I’ll start telling you twice a day.” Dean reaches for Cas’ hand and squeezes it reassuringly as they approach the cluster of people gathered under the large window on the far side of the room.
“It’s not bad, not what I was expecting.”
“He was,” he acknowledges. “Lead singer, guitar, a little piano, but that was a lifetime ago.” He inclines his head toward Will’s hand where it rests on his thigh. “You play guitar?”
Jolene nods in agreement. “Having a dad here is great, too. I’ve tried, but my husband just has no interest in coming. It’s wonderful that you’re taking the time to do these events with your son. Your wife must be so grateful to not have to handle everything. More men should be like you.”
There are still dishes in the sink from making the potato salad for the picnic, but Dean can’t find the energy to rinse them and load the dishwasher. He heats leftover meatloaf and slumps in front of the television, mindlessly thumbing through his Netflix queue. It’s pathetic how much Cas has changed his life. Just a few months ago, dinner and TV alone was normal, but now the silence in the house is stifling. Even when Cas is only sitting next to him, the sound of his breathing and the warm, heavy weight of him pressed to Dean’s side are enough. Dean shivers with a sudden chill.
Castiel stops at the small altar attached to the long back wall to light a stick of jasmine and sandalwood incense. He steps over to the mat in the center of the room and closes his eyes. He breathes deeply as the sweet smoke winds through the room, centering himself. Sinking smoothly down into butterfly pose, Castiel lets the music wash over him as he steadies his breathing.
His eyelids flutter open and he’s staring into Castiel’s eyes again. “Two, Cas. Just two, and one of them wasn’t Ben’s mom. Sex is easy, but it burns out and I don’t want that to happen with us. I want this to be about more than gettin’ off.”
“Will do, Joanna Beth,” he responds with the full name he knows she hates, unable to stop being the annoying big brother despite his gratitude for the way she saved the evening. He’s fully expecting the fist to his stomach that he gets in return, but he still grunts with the impact before laughing.
The salesman at the third lot, Aaron, is young, probably not much older than his mid-twenties, but he’s friendly, with a wide smile that lights up his whole face. As they walk in, Ben is still fixing his stickers on his index card from the last lot and the guy immediately asks him what his favorite planet is. That earns all kinds of bonus points from Dean.
Dean thinks about refusing, but his desire for Cas outweighs his embarrassment. He’s never been particularly shy about sex before, but he feels a little out of his element. He leans forward and peers into the open drawer. Completely unexpectedly, he’s assaulted by an image of being restrained to the bed while Cas has his way with Dean’s body. Another wave of heat passes through him, making his skin tingle. As good as that sounds, though, Dean knows they won’t have time for anything like that. He pushes the leather cuffs and paddle aside and reaches for the beads again. He forces himself to meet Cas’ gaze when he hands them over.
“Meg, darling, leave him alone. Cassie looks delicious. The hot teacher look is in this year,” Balthazar says amiably, backing out onto the road.
Dean looks up at the clock. “It’s almost two a.m. and you’re still drunk. Just sleep on the couch and stop being an asshole.”
“I can do that. Of course. Is he with Missouri?”
Castiel chuckles and stretches across the bed to reach the nightstand then presses a half empty bottle of lube and a strip of three condoms into his hand. Dean raises an eyebrow. “Feeling optimistic?”
Four more children in and out of the pool, and then Cas’ heart gives a pleasant flip-flop when he spots Dean and Ben coming toward him through the crowd. Just the sight of them raises his spirits more than anything else. He wants to run to them, wrap them both in his arms, and not let go until he feels more balanced and like himself. Instead, he raises one hand in a small wave to let them know he’s spotted them and waits patiently until the whole family comes to a stop in front of the booth.
Castiel smiles. “I do. I like watching people too. But you’re right, I don’t easily adapt to people.”
“I’ve actually never seen any of the Marvel movies,” he admits with a shrug.
Cas realizes that he never responded to Dean’s first comment. “Yes, I’ll be fine. I’ll wait here.”
When Dean was a kid, his family being friends with his doctor had seemed cool. Over the years, he has realized Jody may be more than a friend to his dad. Sometimes, Dean wonders if Jody had anything to do with his dad putting his life back together. It’s been nineteen years; neither of them has come clean, and Dean isn’t asking.
Dean is straining to obey, to give Cas everything he has, but it just isn’t enough. He shoves back with his thighs and then forward, driving his cock faster and harder into the tight circle of Cas’ fingers. Distantly, as if it isn’t even his body, he feels Cas’ hand on his ass again, reaching for the handle of the beads. With one rough, fast pull, he yanks them out and Dean howls with overstimulation before his body seizes up, orgasm washing over him fast and hard, like his entire body is pulsing with the same rhythm as his hole and his dick, shooting his release onto the bed under him in long, powerful spurts.
Chewing his bottom lip, Dean steps forward and extends his hand toward Cas. “I thought you might like—” He drops his hand, squeezing his eyes shut before turning away. “Never mind. It’s stupid.”
Cas nods slightly. “That’s true, but in this case, it may be a matter of picking your battles. There is a very good chance that if we don’t stop, Ben will work himself into a full blown meltdown, which we will then have to deal with when we arrive. Any time we lose by stopping may be worth it for Ben to be in a good mood when we get there.”
“I have to get my bath?” Ben asks, starting to tuck the crayons away.
Suddenly, he freezes. The music sounds familiar, like an old pop song from high school.
“But you adapted to Dean,” she responds, that sly look back in her eyes.
Dean squeezes the back of his neck. “I did. Cas was at the house the night it happened and he just wanted to do something to help Ricky’s family out. Paige knows. I called her the other day and asked if it was okay. She cried, Bobby. It’s probably not gonna be much, but she cried.”
“Hey, what are you still doing here?” She marches past him to shove her mug under the Keurig.
“Dad—”
“But not tonight?”
The shiver that runs through Dean has nothing to do with the temperature as he follows Cas’ directions. The friction of the soft sheets against his cock is maddening, especially when Cas grabs one of the pillows to slide under his hips. “Go easy on me, okay?” he mutters, shifting to get comfortable. “I haven’t had anything back there in over ten years.”
Ben laughs at something Ash says and Dean glances over to where they’re sitting on the couch, heads bent together over one of Ben’s robots. As much as he has longed for Ash’s presence in the past, he can’t wait for him to be gone. Dean needs some distance from the bittersweet ache of the end of their relationship so that he can focus on moving forward.
“He can be a little self-righteous at times,” she agrees, flicking a stray curl that didn’t make it into the ponytail out of her face.
“Gordon Lightfoot.
Cas doesn’t turn and look for his uncle. He doesn’t want to see the gaping hole where his mother lays in the dirt. He just wants to be away from here. He wants Dean to help him move, to make sure that he doesn’t grow roots and stay in this place, alone. “Take me home, Dean,” he says.
Garth shrugs. “Nothing to apologize about. I told them they aren’t welcome in Supersonic anymore.”
Cas steps forward and Dean drops his forehead to press against his. “I hate you,” Dean groans softly.
Castiel swallows hard and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment before opening them again. “I want more than that too, Dean.”
“Is that what I look like to you?” Cas asks, holding it with two fingers as if it might shock him.
Dean nods and turns back to the canvases propped against the wall, flipping through them slowly. At first, he doesn’t notice anything strange, but once he does, he goes back to the beginning and studies each painting in depth. Cas stands next to him and Dean isn’t aware that Cas is wringing his hands until he looks up. “Cas? This boy? He’s in all these paintings. Just the back of his head, but it looks like the same boy,” he says questioningly.
Ash scoffs, then looks at Cas in disbelief. “You really don’t get it, do you? If you told him to never talk to me again, he would do it. Without hesitation. You’ve got all the power here, man, whether you believe it or not.”
Castiel nods, eyes flicking away before he forces himself to look back. Dean growls, a soft sound that sends a spark of heat coursing through him, and his green eyes darken. He slides both hands up Castiel’s back, under his shirt, palms rough against the skin. “No one else? In two years?” he asks, palms sliding up and down, eliciting another shiver.
so casually. In the two months since school ended, they haven’t slept apart more than a handful of times, equally splitting their nights between the two houses. While Cas would be happy to move in together, Dean isn’t quite ready to take that step. Either way, home has rapidly become wherever Dean and Ben are.
Somewhere along the line, he’s even ended up with Balthazar’s number in his phone. While neither Gabriel nor Kali have contacted him, Meg reported that they are talking about flying out to ‘give Cas a kick in the ass,’ as she put it. Knowing that even Cas’ family and friends are pulling for him makes Dean feel marginally better, but it’s still no guarantee that Cas will come around.
On stage, Castiel shakes his head, flicking sweat-drenched hair out of his eyes. Dean finds that hard to believe. “We’re just friends.”
Castiel shrugs. “My assets are just fine, thank you.”
“Yeah, I’ll do that.” Ash looks back down at his plate, but there’s a small smile dancing at the corner of his mouth.
Dean smiles, lips quirking up. “So what’s the surprise?”
“Sorry about that, man,” Dean says, rubbing Ben’s head over and over. His eyes burn with sudden exhaustion as the anger drains out of him, leaving a headache.
“The workout makes the champion,” John responds, his voice low and angry. Dean slows to a lazy glide and instead of flipping to push off the wall, he treads water. John’s eyes narrow as he stares at Charlie, who floats on her back in her lane. “If he hasn’t got the drive to be an Olympic athlete—”
Trying to figure out where to split this chapter was a bitch. I'd say I'm sorry for where I ended it, but I'm actually not. :)
“You look like you’re about to face a firing squad. It's not that bad, I promise. Whose class is your . . .” she pauses questioningly.
“You bring it out of me.”
“You seem sad, like when Ash goes back to California.”
“It’s really not, Dean. You do it for me, too. You go to the museum with me even though you don’t care about art at all. Sometimes, intimacy can just be about taking care of each other and doing things that give the other person pleasure. Tonight, you asked me to let you take care of me. Sometimes you can let me take care of you, too.”
To his surprise, the women don’t seem shocked. Instead Jolene just nods again. “We all do, Dean. Everything is so much
“Welcome to
There are days when Castiel hates his complete ineptitude with cooking. He would like to be able to create exquisite meals made of fresh, healthy ingredients. After an unfortunate situation with a frying pan shot flames over a foot into the air, though, he gave up trying. Instead, he lives on a whole foods diet he supplements with take-out and things that are easily microwaved. The only things he makes on the stove anymore are omelets and he can’t even remember the last time anyone but Meg turned the oven on.
“Of course. Dr. Barnes doesn’t have any opening until two weeks from now. We will also be observing Ben during that time. He will continue to be in Miss Blake’s class, but we will ask you to sign a paper giving us permission to move him into a small class temporarily if he becomes upset. The teachers in that room are trained to help Ben with his coping skills and they would continue to make sure he is completing all of his work even if he is out of Miss Blake’s class so he doesn’t fall behind.” Jody pulls some papers out of the folder at her elbow and passes them to Dean.
He’s so caught up in the show that he doesn’t register Will standing beside him until the man slides his arm around Castiel’s waist and pulls him against his side. His first instinct is to tense against the intrusion, but once he confirms that it is, in fact, Will, he forces himself to relax into the embrace. Will leans over until his lips are just a breath away from Castiel’s ear and yells, “The lead guitar is a little tinny.”
“I want to be with you.” Cas takes a few quick, shallow breaths and Dean worries he will hyperventilate. His breathing calms again before he says, “I want you to be happy, Dean. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
Dean shakes his head again. A few more seconds pass, his lips moving silently. After a moment he stills. "Sorry," he says suddenly. "I got some stuff to take care of. Don't skip dinner, okay? I'll come find you."
"So why isn't it over?" John asks, voice dangerously close to breaking. Dean's in danger, this hellspawn is bunking with his family, and John is alive again after more than a decade. Why would he be here if his sons didn't need him? If his Mary didn't still need him?
"I'm sorry about Jack," Mom tells Cas. She sounds like she's a thousand miles away. "We...talked. John's not going to give him a hard time from here on out. Not you or the boys either."
"No," Mary says, too quickly. "No, God—it's their home before it's mine, John. Sam said as long as you—you can't treat Jack the way you treated them. But I think you should stay, if you can follow their rules, and they don't ask you to leave. I think leaving would be just about the worst thing you could do to Dean right now. But you and I..."
Dean was wrong. Flagstaff happened to Sam too, in its own way. It's been happening to Sam for five years, every time anyone mentioned Dad or their childhood or probably even the state of Arizona in general, knowing Sam. Shit, Dean's been stewing about Sam not being able to keep a fucking secret, but just a few weeks ago, right after he made the Ma'lak Box, Dean admitted that Dad used to send him away to punish him. Sam had sat shotgun the whole time, had known about Flagstaff the whole
something else when John died. John wouldn't know what he is now, because nobody will tell him a damn thing. What the demons wanted Sam to do was worse than either of his boys ever knew—John did his best to protect them from that. Sam's fate always balanced on a razor's edge. If he fell the wrong way, would Dean do what John asked him to, all those years ago? Or would he follow Sam down that same dark road? And if Dean could be made to love one monster, could he be made to love more?
Another pause. Dean gives Mom a look.
; it's stupid, maybe, but he always had a strict no-kissing policy with his johns.
, and takes a deep breath, hands gripping the steering wheel. "Eventually, uh, he just gave up. I heard him on the phone with Pastor Jim once—he said I'd either get around to it or I wouldn't, but either way, I still had to be ready. And then, when I was six or seven, he took me shooting for the first time. Bottles on a fence. I bulls-eyed every one of 'em."
But even after everything, after John's failures and his unexpected return, after his spur-of-the-moment decision to say yes to Michael that nearly got Dean into more hot water than it got him out of, Dean still fought for him. He fought for John with everything he had.
Transparent. Dean could blow him off, but...he needs a break. "Fine," he grounds out. He slips out of the space between his dad and the doorway. "Sorry, Dad," he says. "We'll talk later, okay?"
. Dean was supposed to be wishing for a version of Michael he could stab to death, not John Winchester rising from the grave. This isn't just a let-down on the Michael front; this is embarrassing.
Cas gives Dean a strange look. "He's a child, Dean."
Hm. "Don't see how it's any different from me. Not really something anybody
Michael goes so silent so quickly that for one terrifying moment, Dean's afraid that somehow he's gone. That illusion is shattered a second later, by what Dean hears next.
, and
drew some hugs
pulled Dean out of Hell." John sneers out their little nickname. "And by the way, when were you gonna tell me—"
At the time Dean could hardly stand to hear it. It felt so wrong, like something someone who didn't know his dad would say. Like something an ungrateful son would say. No one, not Sam or Cas, not even Mom, could ever understand what it was like back then: how alone Dean was, and how scared, and how Dad reached down into that darkness and pulled Dean out like his very own avenging angel. Dean hasn't been listening to them 'cause they just don't get it. They don't even try.
Sam's eyebrows lift, incredulous. "That I've got demon blood? Dad, I've known about that for a long time." And, considering that neither Jack or Mary seem surprised to hear it, that must not be a secret.
Dean likes being next to Cas. In the bunker, in the car, on a job. Having Cas close to him, at his back, makes Dean feel safer, not the opposite. And it wasn't that bad. That's what he keeps getting stuck on: it honestly wasn't that bad. It was different, and unexpected, but if Cas wanted to do it again, if that made him happy—
, Dean, oh my God!"
The grip around his wrists vanishes. The lamp flips on. Through a haze of panic and a deafening cacophony of angel screaming, Dean sees Cas, unbloodied and whole.
, he breaks away from Mary, and begins to hobble up the stairs. "Get back," he calls up. "Away from the door. You only go out of it through me."
, Sam said. God, this is so fucked up. Some old reflex has Dean pulling down his sleeves to cover the bruises on his wrists. "There's nothin' you can do," he says. "I've got it under control."
sons, not because they're mine. That's what it means to be a parent. And look, I know I'm the last person who...I can be closed off, sometimes. Distant, even cold. I know that. But they're worth the effort because they're my kids. Sons," she corrects herself. "They're not children anymore. They don't need to be babied. They just need us to do the hard thing—they need us to be there for them, to make up for all the times we weren't."
. One-way ticket to the bottom of the Pacific. Great job, Winchester.
Sam glances at it, his features smoothing until they're indecipherable. "Something like that," he says, easy, and reaches up to the shelf next to it to yank down a tarp. The box and blade disappear from view, and Sam says, "Goodwill grabs are to your right. First come first serve. You know how we go through clothes."
Dean can't move his arms.
"Wound up is what you are," Sam says. "You need to cool off so Michael doesn't bust out of your brain."
he couldn't have.
you make it out of this," Cas adds, "I know it will be better with you, because it will
"They told me it was a bust," Dad says. "Whatever we were after."
That seems to surprise Dad. "But we finished the fight. It was supposed to be over. You never went back to school, Sammy?"
Dean pulls off his boots and shuts off the lights. Tonight, he has the presence of mind to get under the blankets. And when he closes his eyes, and feels Cas sit beside him, he does his best not to think—of Flagstaff, or Michael, or his resentment at Cas's broken promises, or where he's likely to end up soon. He just reaches out for Cas's hand and holds on.
. What
Dean doesn't have time for this. "Either help me or get out of my way, Sammy."
, and
"I did," Cas says, very seriously, and turns to face Dean. "It's not just what he did back then. It's what he's doing right now. It's not fair of him to treat you and Sam like you're still children when you've accomplished more together than he ever did for you. He has no right to demand answers and explanations from you or lecture you about the choices you've made when he's the one who left you with no other options."
"Listen," Dean says to Cas. "You gotta lay off my dad, man. I know you ain't his biggest fan, especially not with—some of the stuff you know." Dean told Cas some of it, like Flagstaff, a long time ago. But he's got a sneaking suspicion that Cas saw a whole lot more than that, when he and Sam were in Dean's head trying to help him cast Michael out. They just haven't talked about it. Dean doesn't even want to think about it. "But he's still my dad. It wasn't his fault he got dealt a shit hand. And we can't have any more accidents like we did today with Jack. We piss off my old man and Michael's gonna bust that door in my head to pieces. Is that what you want?"
gets pretty damn bad sometimes.
"Man, don't you get it?" Dean asks. "I was fucked, six ways to Sunday. But then Dad gave me a gun and a mission and suddenly I'm a real boy again. Looking out for you was more than just my job, Sam—it's what got me out of bed in the morning. Because no matter how bad it got, at the end of it we still had us. If you think I got regrets, you're wrong. I mean, come on, how many times have you gotten your ass kicked for me?"
"Oh," says Sam, like he'd forgotten. "I wouldn't expect to see a girl on Dean's arm anytime soon. Or ever. That's just—something he struggles with."
Sam stops mid-word. "What?"
And if Dean killed Lucifer, then he remembers—he remembers just where to stab—
There are also board games, which Dean cleans up at. At first, everybody else held up better than Dean did because they haven't been sleep-deprived for a month solid, but as the day drags on, Dean's sheer practice at operating without any sleep at all wins out. Dean vetoes Monopoly, but they play a couple of rounds of Sorry!, a seriously weird game of Clue that goes on forever because they're all too wired to put together evidence (Dean bullies Sam into being Miss Scarlet), and an even weirder game of Mouse Trap that ends when the trap falls apart in the middle of Dad's turn.
Cas has his feet propped on the table, his coat draped over the chair. He's got a beer in his hand. He looks like shit, because he always looks like shit; he's just got one of those vessels. From this angle, Dean can only see the back of him, and his face, angled to look at Sam, in profile. He's smiling.
"Look at that," we muse. "Seems like you aren't a good enough, hostage, Sammy. I always knew everyone liked Dean better. It hurts always playing second fiddle, doesn't it?"
John can't remember the last time he did a basic household chore like this—their family never stayed anywhere long enough to build up dirty dishes, if they had dishes at all. Sometimes they'd rent a house when Sam and Dean were kids, so they could stay a month or two at a time for school, but even then John was usually out hunting. He'd have to leave his boys for days or even weeks at a time, and get in at all hours. Times like that, the sink was always empty, because Dean was something of a neat freak. Weapons obsessively clean, motel rooms and rented houses picked up, beds made with hospital corners tight enough to bounce a penny off of. He'd have made any drill sergeant proud.
That's what he used to tell himself, after Dad died. It wasn't fair to get angry at Dad for being dealt a crap hand, for struggling to do right in a world that did him wrong. Everybody's human. Everybody makes mistakes. When the anger did come it made Dean feel so guilty, like he was speaking ill of the dead, or being a bad son. So he reasoned it out the only way he could: there was no point in being angry with Dad, because Dad did the best he could. But Dean could at least be angry that Dad's best wasn't good enough.
Sam's mouth firms into a line. "One of us could try taking the shot. After—
Dean coughs, choking on cement dust and the grip we have on his insides. He holds fast to the archangel blade, as if it could possibly be of any use to him. "There's no...such thing...as angels..."
Sam looks up again. "You don't get it," he says. "We weren't there because you weren't. That's the world where Mom said no to the deal."
"Leave her alone!" Sam shouts, held back at the last moment by Dean and Castiel.
that they were going to want me to do that? To drink demon blood?"
And on that thought, he sits up a little straighter. Sam's right; wouldn't do to conk out and have Michael manifest himself in Dean's back seat. "Fall asleep?" Dean echoes. "And miss this? No fucking way, dude." He's pleased to see the set of Sam's shoulders is more relaxed than usual, that he's absently drumming his fingers against his knee in time with the music. "Admit it, you're having fun."
While we were distracted, Castiel somehow hauled himself off the floor, and hit us right in the face.
Shit—Dad. Dean actually almost forgot about him. Not that it'll matter, soon. Once Michael's made Dean his bitch again, Dad's gonna know everything.
Wow, isn't that the million-dollar question? "Uh," says Dean. His palms inch up Cas's back to rest on his shoulderblades, bringing them closer together. "Whatever."
," says Cas. "It's okay. It's okay."

And in the bustle of getting themselves dressed and presentable, John forgets entirely that she never told him what, exactly, Sam and Dean were wishing for.
modified the shot of the initials on the table to match their descriptions in this fic, which you can see
He's distracted anyway by Mary seeming to feel the weight of his gaze. She looks up, and for just a moment her face breaks into that hurt, ragged relief and joy she looked at John with when they reunited. "John!" She drops the broom and rushes towards him—
But Cas breaks before Dean does. "Dean, please, what
What? John blinks, struggling to stay conscious. "...why?"
to the list of things he needed to repress to function around Cas day-to-day and still be able to look him in the eye.
Dean's heart is in his throat. "Dad still loves you," he tries to explain. Why isn't she getting it? She was supposed to understand. She was supposed to remember. She was supposed to love Dad like Dean does. "Whatever you think he did—it's just because he was in such a bad place after you died—"
"Dean. Dean!"
"Which are?"
"Poker, obviously," Dean replies. "One round, all in, no folding."
Cas looks devastated. Does he know? Did he see? "Are you all right?"
Classic subject change, but Dean lets him slide. "You bet your feathery ass they do." He sets the plates down on the table, grabs them a couple of beers, and sits. "Dig in, pal."
, Dad! Dean did everything he could to protect me, but you didn't tell him what was going on, or warn either of us about what was coming! Dean made his whole life about watching out for me, and then you asked him to do the opposite and just
It takes about six whole seconds for that thought to properly catch up to Dean, but when it does it hits him like a sledgehammer. The smile drops off of his face.
"Dean," Sam says again, but Dean leans up and asks Jack what's on the radio, and that's the end of that conversation.
Castiel lets out a deep sigh and reaches into his coat. He sets a gold spiral blade down on the box shoved against the back wall, now uncovered again, the tarp lying in a heap on the floor. He looks—upset, actually, which is just as strange as seeing him smile in those photos tucked into John's journal. No one ever really gets used to an angel's presence, but John has come to expect that when he's around, he'll always wear that same implacable expression, looking at John like he'd very much like to throw him back down into the Pit.
"The distance might feel easier for us—safer, even. But even like this..." Mary gestures at herself, her thirty-two-year-old body that's eight years younger than Dean's. "I'm still their mom. I have to—I
And John's family, they kill monsters. Him and the boys, and Mary too. Why in the hell are they living in an underground bunker with one?
"Maybe—maybe with Dad's face?" Sam tries. "You said he jumped in him, right, back when we traveled in time? Maybe your wires got crossed."
John remembers how furious he was that Dean would do something so reckless, and how he thought leaving Dean for a few months would make sure the lesson sunk in. Dean always loathed to be separated from his family, so leaving him somewhere alone or sending him away when he screwed up was the most effective punishment John had. Of course, the lesson was supposed to be:
Cas looks around. "We have..." He finds a paper bag. "...extra Biggerson's napkins?"
"Ouch," Dean says, both sympathetic and relieved. "Guess you're eating it."
Cas steps forward. "Let me take care of it," he says. "It will give you three time to talk."
Well, there's not a dry eye in this house. Dean scrubs furiously at his face, and is gratified to hear Sam sniffling from beside him. Then Sam smacks his shoulder and jerks his head, because yeah, no, they've waited decades for this, and they're not gonna stop now. Time to beat it.
Dean looks at Jack. "Did they fight?"
She's immaculate, obviously. Dean doesn't park her outside these days and he washes her every week, come hell or high water (sometimes literally). Dad walks up to her real slow, and ghosts his fingers over the hood in wonder. "It can't be the same car," he said. "That semi totaled it. Did you find another?"
"John," Mary pleads. "John, you've got to fight him, you can't do this, John, please—"
There was almost nothing about Mary John
Cas presses his other hand to the small of Dean's back, fingertips dipped half an inch beneath his waistband. Any lower and Dean's alarms would all be going off, he'd have to bail on this whole thing, but right where it is now it's making him crazy in the good way. They're close enough that Dean's chest is flush against Cas's which is
Dean lets them go. "Oh."
"It's in your blood, too, remember?" We smile. "Or did you think you were a bastard? With the way John treated you, I would have wondered too. He certainly did. He just couldn't see his beloved Mary in you, not the way he always saw her in Dean. Maybe she wanted a weekend away from the darling husband; he's such a charmer, and she has such terrible taste in men. Or maybe old Yellow Eyes snuck into your daddy here, and she couldn't tell the monster from the man."
And at the turn of every day, the same offer, whispered in his ear: that it
. it's also embedded in the chapter itself on ao3!
John just wasn't listening. "You really could stay awhile. It doesn't have to be all the time, or forever. There's things to hunt and people to save. But for a little while. Special occasions."
For some reason that makes Sam laugh, but it's little more than a disbelieving puff of air and jerk of his shoulders, and his smile is brittle as it crosses his face. "I think I have some idea," Sam says. "I've been to Hell myself."
to one of those things? How could you?"
Dean shudders. "No way in hell," he says. "Last time we messed with that place was nothing but trouble. One Michael running around is bad enough."
Well, Dean did warn him he wouldn't like it. The guy thinks Jack is Satan 2.0, and he probably always will, no matter what anyone says, even Mom. But he can think what he wants if he can just keep it to himself. Right now, as far as Dean's concerned, what he does matters a hell of a lot more than how he feels about it.
A breeze blows through the trees, kicking up dead leaves, and Dean shivers. The cold has gone from bracing to unpleasant. He tries not to think about how much worse it's gonna be at the bottom of the ocean.
Mom's holding her own against the vamps, but they don't see Dean coming and he makes quick work of them from behind. "You okay?" he asks.
"You know, Dean," Mom says, "I may not know all the details, but I know you and Sam—I know you didn't have an easy childhood. And I know some of it was because of your father. But it's not all on your shoulders anymore. Sam has grown up, and so have you. And he and I, and Castiel and even Jack—we've all got your back. Whatever you need."
HELLO. happy thursday. welcome BACK to the john winchester hate club. thank you SO MUCH for all the love last week!! i can't possibly say how overwhelmed i am each week with the response to this story, you're all so rad <3
love Cas. He doesn't know what to do with that.
Mom helps him dry in silence, but after Dean scrubs the last plate and pulls the plug on the dishwater she says, "I want to talk to you about something, and you're not gonna like it."
"What was that?" John asked her, hunter's instincts tingling with dread. "Some kind of ESP or something?"
Something about the direction of the wind or a gap in the noise from the fire must have made them just a little louder, loud enough for angel hearing, because Cas glances up from the fire at them.
Oh. A small, quiet noise drops out of Dean into Cas's mouth, and he turns out of the kiss, panting as Cas pulls him out of his clothes. He's not sure what he was expecting, but this is okay. Just a handjob—he can handle that. It's good, actually. A little dry, but Cas has a light touch, and Dean has decided that he likes Cas's hands. He knows the shape of them very well.
"Nope," says Dean. He gets a couple of plates out of the cabinet—one for him, one for Dad—and starts loading them up with eggs and bacon. "That's Michael." On cue his head starts pounding, like Michael heard him and wants to say,
"I'm here," Dean grits out. "Don't have a coronary, Sam."
And Sam did—he took the picture to Dean, and the two of them got under the covers of their shared queen-size bed, all huddled up for warmth, and Dean whispered to Sam the stories that hurt John too much to tell. How sweetly Mary sang all her favorite Beatles songs, how she always let Dean turn the pages in storybooks, how good her Winchester Surprise casserole was. John stayed up late stoking the fire, but even when he finally drifted off in his chair, they were still going. He's certain they talked damn near to morning.
Cas? But he can't talk anymore, he can't tell, Dean made sure—
?" Dean demands. He's got that hot snarling feeling in his chest again. "You've been back for like a week, man! And you weren't gonna say anything? You were fine just leaving me to sweat it out? Are you pissed at me or something?"
Dad's angry expression breaks a little, real despair showing through the cracks. "I screwed up, Dean."
"It's not your job," Mom says, "to fix us. You've got enough on your plate. For once, Dean, let us take care of ourselves—so you can take care of you."
The noise in Dean's head drops a little further. It doesn't feel like it did before, when Dean was able to force it down. It feels like Michael is being quiet so he can hear what's about to happen. It feels like Dean has just walked into a trap.
, are in the end notes. this is a very intense chapter with (i hope) a very scary bad guy, and as much as i want everyone to be surprised, i also want everyone to read safely, so check below if you need to!
"Dean," says Sam again, but Dean doesn't listen to him. He spins on his heel and starts back down the road. That would take him around to the tunnel that leads into the garage, but that's a much longer walk, so on the way there, he ducks behind a tree, and it's dark enough that even though Sam and Cas tried to follow him, they can't see exactly where he is. They think he's still ahead of them, so they speed up, giving chase—and Dean turns right around and takes the shorter route back into the bunker.
Dean exits into the map room, looking around before he spots Dad heading up the little mini-staircase into the library. "Dad," he calls, just as his father pulls out a chair at one of the tables. He jogs up the stairs to join him. "Hey," he says. "Mind if I have a seat? I brought you breakfast. And it's been a while since I got to have a beer with the old man."
Dean's wearing a classic deer-in-headlights look. "We—we will, I just—just, look, now's not a—"
Sam has had much more sleep than Dean has, and he dodges Dean's ineffectual swatting easily, whooping with laughter. "How many years," he says, "did you say sex in the car was all well and good, but
Sam brings a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose. "I think you just did."
Dean waits until they're out of earshot to release the breath he was holding. "Thanks," he says. "God, I hope they don't kill each other before they get around to killing these vamps."
Michael played the whole awful thing out for him. Not just what Dean did to earn the money John didn't leave, but what happened before he decided to do it. How scared Dean felt, how cornered he was. Dean should have come to John the first time the money ran out too soon. If not the first, then the second or third, when it started to become a pattern. And he didn't—because he guessed, perhaps correctly, that John would blame him, or worse, that John would feel guilty about not being able to leave more. That time John left Dean in the boys home, when Dean got caught stealing, Dean said he lost the money in a poker game—John thought he was being careless with their funds, but he really was just trying to make the money stretch, exactly like John taught him. A string of bad luck led to a lost game and no cash, so Dean tried taking the five-finger discount instead. It wasn't even the first time. But his previous successes combined with sheer desperation made him sloppy, and he got caught.
With a start Dean realizes Sam's been staying up to watch him and Dad, hoping one of them would go to bed so that they weren't together without Sam there to keep an eye on them. Dean doesn't know whether to be touched or insulted. Mostly he doesn't want Sam to hit Dad again. He knows how hard Sam hits, and he suspects Dad would prefer not to get punched again either. But secretly, deep, deep down, a tiny little part of him is a little glad he's not the only one keeping Dad in check anymore. It was exhausting work. Dean is very tired, and he'd like a little rest.
"We've all been hit," John hedges. That's just how it was back then. Even Mary got a shiner from her old man once. John remembers icing it, being pissed as hell because real men shouldn't need to lay hands on their kids. That was before he became a parent—a
, something about this whole situation is definitely revving up Dean's engine. Dean loves it.
"Well, this is your second chance," Sam points out. "Might not be the worst thing to just sit back and enjoy the ride." He ducks his head a little to meet John's eye. "And in the meantime, you might want to be more careful about the questions you ask. You might not like all the answers."
Dean lets Cas pull him to his feet and hisses through his teeth. He hurts all over, and no wonder; his body's taking a literal pounding from the inside as they speak. Gross. "We'll be back," he slurs, as Cas slips an arm under his shoulders, because even half-unconscious he is very good at lying. If Sam thought there was any chance Dean
"Tell me one true thing," he says. "You and Dean have been talking over my head all night, and I'm sick of it. So give me something honest. Tell me something you and Dean did while I was gone. Make it something you know I'd hate. And we'll trade." Sam's smart as a whip, but surely even he can't put the whole thing together with just one woman's name.
And suddenly, we understand.
kid. Jack can still access his powers, at a terrible cost, but he doesn't heal from injuries anymore. Sam said Dad had his machete out, and Jack's still shaky on his hand-to-hand. Dad could have really hurt Jack, maybe even killed him. And then where would they be? Nothing anyone could say would stop Cas from killing Dad for that. Dean's not even sure he'd try.
firstly:
Other realities—sure, why not? After angels being real, John's prepared to believe pretty much anything except Godzilla and aliens. He's much more interested in what Bobby's helping with this time, but there's no quicker way to end this conversation than to ask, so he doesn't. And it rankles him that this is how things are now: that Sam controls his behavior instead of the other way around, that there's no way for John to play the dad card and force Sam to give him what he wants. "What other reality?" he tries instead.
There's a very long pause. John has been shocked silent.
What? Dean looks up. "Obviously I'm benched, I'm no good to anybody like this, but why the kid? He's handy enough in a fight. Be better for him to get out of here away from Dad, right?"
"Psych 101," Sam says finally. "A good apology has three parts: acknowledgement of wrongdoing, remorse, and restitution. You're stuck on the first step—you can't exactly acknowledge your wrongdoing when you don't understand what you're doing wrong."
And John remembers Dean saying, when he asked if Castiel was possessing someone:
"Why are you just standing there lurking?" Castiel asks flatly, without even turning around. "Don't tell me you're afraid."
After they're gone, Dean ventures out to find Jack sulking in the war room. "You're gonna be real glad we ditched Cas here in a few," he says. "I have a surprise for you."
"Me either," Dad sighs. "Good times. Wasn't that the year we helped you cram for your GED?"
"I was
He's got the first two down; might as well get started on the third. For Mary—and for Sam and Dean, he corrects himself.
Maybe Dean's being a little selfish too. The fate of the world hangs in the balance, and he knows he should yell at Cas and browbeat him until he sucks it up and does what has to be done—but Dean just doesn't want to take that coffin ride without making his peace. "Yeah," he says, still struggling to let go of his anger. It's easier said than done. "Yeah, okay. Whatever, man."
And Dean exits the kitchen, leaving his shellshocked brother with his mouth still hanging open behind him.
okay?"
"Don't you like it?" Jack asks. "I think it looks pretty." He passes a box of—thank fuck—plain white birthday candles to Sam, who opens the cake and starts sticking them in.
As soon as his lips are his own again, they call Castiel's name. He doesn't have to give Castiel instructions; Castiel knows exactly what he wants. And so, before the light has even died, Castiel leaps at John—
And then, the impossible: the demon told him that soon, he would get to see Dean again.
Everyone stills. John feels sick, suddenly. He can't have heard that right. "What?"
John's expression tightens. "How do I know I can trust you?"
of him, Dean still notices things, like: his head is killing him. His back hurts. His feet are going numb. He's about to choke on his own goddamn saliva. God, he fucking hates crying.
"No," Cas says quietly. "Sam's not an angel, and he wasn't the one looking. He didn't have the same perception that I did. I was the only one who saw anything, and you have my word that I won't tell anyone." Okay. Dean's shoulders slump. Silver lining. "I just didn't think you'd ever want—this," Cas adds haltingly, because he's trying not to say
for this fic too. we are canon-compliant until the end of 14.12, during which dean and cas got together (i suppose in this version of events, cas was able to bring jack back before being forced to deal with the empty, so there was no deal with the empty to stop them), but
. He'll gag on the words. He never understood what it was like to lose his voice the way Dean did until this very moment. He clamps his jaw shut and swallows hard against a sudden surge of nausea.
"All right, tough guy, come on," Dean says, and grabs Cas roughly by the shoulder as he walks by, spinning him around so he can't glare at Dad anymore. Dean doesn't mean to manhandle him, but he doesn't know how else to touch Cas when he can still feel Michael pounding away at that door in his head, and his father's eyes following them all the way out of the room.
Dad's thrilled to see her. Dean doesn't get to impress his old man very often, but walking into that garage lined with classic cars, even John Winchester can't keep his poker face on. He lets out a low whistle, looking around—and then his eyes fall on the Impala.
Dean draws back, incredulous. It doesn't make any sense, but he feels more violated about Sam having known all this time than he does about Sam telling Mom about it. "That's
Several things happen in very quick succession, so fast Dean barely has time to process them. Dad grabs Dean by the upper part of his left arm, and attempts to walk him back towards the door he came out of, even though Sam is in his way. At the same exact instant Michael seems to decide this is his moment, and starts kicking up a ruckus, fighting to get free again. Almost before Dad's hand makes contact, though, Cas snaps, "
"He asked Cas if he wanted to ride in the truck with him," Sam recalls suddenly. "I guess he wanted to talk?"
"Oh." Sam shrugs. "No reason."
Dean's hands are shaking. "You are so full of shit," he says, and goes to get a beer.
"Sam, so help me—"
He gives Mary a little nod, and endures the small heartbreak that happens every time he has to step away from her. On the way to the kitchen, though, he feels a pair of eyes on him, and when he looks up he finds Sam has stopped working to glare at him from all the way across the room. John rubs his nose, feeling the phantom ache of Sam's knuckles colliding with his face, remembering the way that even Michael was afraid of his force of will and trapped because of his warding. Suddenly, inexplicably, John feels as though he needs Sam's blessing to talk to Dean at all.
A family dinner. It's almost literally too good to be true. John has a fond and distant memory of Mary's meatloaf—best he's ever had. "Do you still cook?" he asks, hopeful.
