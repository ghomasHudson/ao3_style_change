“It’s all right, John,” Sherlock said quietly, and his hands moved again. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about your voice, John, it’s quite nice. Tenor.”
The first thing to penetrate his senses was a regular pinging noise. Then his head announced its agony, and the pinging increased slightly. So, a heart rate monitor, which meant a hospital. But where?
“Fair enough,” Jerome said, as he drove out of the airport and onto the widest, most terrifying highway John had ever seen. “I’ve booked you at the hotel directly across the road from the museum, so you can just head over when you’re ready to collapse.”
“And I know it’s too late now. I missed my chance. I’m sorry for that. Sometimes you’re looking at me, but you don’t
“The quality of your voice is of no matter for this purpose. You are much more aware of contemporary music than I am. It would really help, John.”
Some part of John told him to shut up and let Holmes mope, but he was warming to his theme. Time travel had made him quite pragmatic about fate and destiny. “If Mr. Cubitt hadn’t come to you with his concerns, you wouldn’t have taken him on as a client. You wouldn’t have solved the code, and you wouldn’t have known who the murderer was or how to bring him in for arrest. Mrs. Cubitt will recover, but she will recover to health and not to the gallows.”
Holmes’ head tipped to the side, and he stared at John as though he were a problem to be solved. “Are you sorry for kissing me, or are you apologizing for the fact that you didn’t seek my permission?”
He was lying. His feet were already itching to join, even though the dance was only a fusty cotillion. No matter.
John’s body was littered with scars large and small, and freckles, and fine blonde hair on his legs and chest and groin. His cock jutted out, hard and flushed with blood. Sherlock felt a throb between his own legs, and then John touched him and he groaned.
They passed another store on their way to Regent’s Park. The windows were shattered like all the other shops, but the shelves were picked over, leaving only a small fraction of the original supply. Sherlock thought of the echoing voices he had heard in the night at Whitehall, and realized that with more people alive than himself and Rosie, there were more people to compete with for a dwindling food supply. He gathered everything from the store that he could.
Running after the man would likely cause a panic, John thought, so he walked quickly and with purpose towards the man, who seemed oblivious to his presence. He needed to alert Jerome and Sherlock, but he had never been able to grasp Sherlock’s trick of walking and typing on his phone at the same time, so he pressed his speed dial and called Sherlock. It rang three times and went to voicemail, which surprised John at first, then he realized that Sherlock was likely backstage and might not want to give away his presence by talking out loud.
“That part of me, the part that I thought I’d buried long ago, the part of me that loved holding a gun, and hiding, and subterfuge, the sheer
“Well now, sir, you’ve caught me, and I suppose you know that I was here last night. I assume the squire’s dead?”
“You’ll have to excuse – terribly sorry. We have a… guest that often comes here for, ah, independent study. His methods are, shall we say, unorthodox, and… He is a genius, no denying, but a bit… Well. Let me, ah, introduce you.”
“There’s a showing of the art at the end of the session,” John said. “Displaying all the work that’s been done in the class, and that. I’ll probably show it there. But after, yeah.” A strange and unfamiliar sensation swept through him, and he understood why Sherlock straightened his spine a little bit whenever John praised him. “Thanks.”
“Take the cuffs off, Anderson,” Lestrade said, walking up. “I’ve warned you about arresting people before you hear the whole story.”
He dug through his Mind Palace and found some Shakespeare and Keats, and would recite those to her for a change. She clearly didn’t understand what they were about, and asked him over and over what a ‘fardel’ was, or what a nightingale looked like. She never asked him to repeat those poems, and he wasn’t sure if this was a relief or a disappointment.
Sherlock chuckled as he poured the hot water over the teacups. “Sexual jealousy and ambition rolled into one. Romeo’s understudy with unrequited love for Juliet. Shakespeare could hardly have written better.”
It was the work of a moment. When the recording was done, Sherlock slumped and turned his attention back to the fire. He heard Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson whispering again by the door.
Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on John’s shoulder, and John understood immediately. “Not at all,” he said.
Sherlock turns a colour red that I didn’t think was possible with his skin tone. “Yes, thank you John.” He’s clearly trying to ignore the fact that if his face was on top of an ambulance it could stop traffic, and he turns to John, eyebrows raised, expectantly.
Pavlović looked over at them, and smiled in a way that made Sherlock grit his teeth. “She’s going away,” Pavlović said, “right now.”
Bahdri shaved his face, carefully. John could almost feel the weight of the last few weeks falling away with his facial hair. He reached up and felt that Bahdri had left his mustache.
Sherlock was no longer sure who was leading and who was following, but they were moving in sync. They weren’t precisely the same, but each moving in their own way, their own style. John’s movements were tight and loose limbed at the same time, and Sherlock’s held the long lines that had been trained into his body since childhood. Sherlock tried to adapt a more relaxed and natural flow from John, and he could see John altering his movements to increase his stride, lengthen his limbs in imitation of Sherlock. They were dancing, together, each borrowing from the other.
“It will be all right now, you’ll see, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson said as she led him to the bathroom. The bath was already full, steaming and sweet smelling. “Detective Lestrade’s a good man, and he’ll take care of it. He won’t let Watson
Maja laughed. Her face was full of scorn, and she laughed, lifted her chin, and walked back into Serbia, into the waiting car, without looking back.
Rules and Risks – Planning – Distractions – Moderation Scorned – Ruffled Hair – Yearning and Laundry – Resolutions
John’s jaw jutted out mulishly, but he realized with a scowl that this might be the only way to figure out what Sherlock was on about. He yanked his book out of his bag, flipped through the pages until he found the sketches of the model, and shoved them into Sherlock’s hands. Immediately Sherlock’s eyes turned their sharp gaze onto the picture. After a moment, he looked up at John, and John was again struck by the confusion on his normally aloof expression.
John took his hand as he waved absently towards the controls. “She’s fine. She’s fine. Will you? Come on,
; all his organs are reversed in his body, do you see? And I’m trying to demonstrate to Inspector Gregson that the murderer knew that.”
“Thank you,” he said softly to her. Then he straightened his back, all business again. “You work on commission, do you not?”
Another old woman carrying a basket of bread passed, looking at them curiously, and Maja gave her a gritted teeth smile. The embassy seemed to get no closer, but Sherlock still walked.
Sherlock did later remember the feel of John’s hand in his, pulling him through the church to the privacy of their room; how John didn’t let him go as he firmly closed the door behind them. He remembered the electric shock of John pulling him close and kissing him – wildly, urgently, and with a level of passion that topped everything they had done up until then.
“Yes. A quick one. Then we can go tomorrow. It sounds… lovely.” John cursed his slow reactions, feeling sick deep in the pit of his stomach as he saw Sherlock’s face morph from confusion to wary watchfulness.
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson said, and her voice was strained and wet. “I’ll just – I’ll get a cup of tea for him. He – he looks like he needs a cup of tea.”
“He… he was married before.” He sounded stunned, as though he had suddenly had a massive paradigm shift in his life, and his boyfriend hadn’t even said ‘yes’ yet.
They kissed, and Sherlock’s heart and mind were overflowing with love for this man, who had survived so much, and was now here, with him.
Holmes was silent for a long time, long enough to make John wonder if he had in fact blown it, ruined everything. Then Holmes took in a sharp breath as though awakening.
Sherlock and Rosie leave Baker Street in search of Mycroft, but the impact of the bomb is greater than Sherlock's worst fears.
Sherlock danced for hours, focusing exclusively on the Goldberg Variation piece he had spoken of with Janina. He wondered if she was watching him live, or if they gave her a recording of his rehearsals afterwards. Part of the façade to maintain was that he genuinely planned to dance on Friday, when in fact he hoped that by then he would be on a plane back to England by then – with John beside him.
Mycroft laid a recording device on the tray beside Sherlock’s bed. “I am here to take your official statement, Sherlock. Kindly give us an account of everything that happened since the plane crash to the present moment.”
He gets up, and I worry for a moment that he’s just going to brush past me and disappear into London again, but he stops in the doorway. He glances back at John and Sherlock, then pulls me into the foyer. His hand, on my elbow.
“It’s a… unique proposal. I don’t know the gentleman personally, but he’s new to Persephone and his references check out. I will forward it to you. Have a look, Sherlock – in your spare time of course.”
He dragged John, spluttering and half dressed, up the stairs to the rehearsal space he had created in the upper room.
John’s mouth twisted again, and this time Sherlock saw that John was trying not to grin. He nodded sharply, and strode away from Sherlock towards his bedroom.
“Come on, man, chin up,” he said. He reached out and covered Holmes’ cold hand with his own. “Let’s go see what happened. We can at least find justice for Cubitt.”
“I know, Mr. Holmes, and I didn’t want to do it. But at that time he was a danger to himself and to my staff.”
Sherlock broke into a run, circling the space, John only a half step behind him. Sherlock lengthened his strides, running not for speed but to wake his body and to feel the air rush in his face. He heard John adding taps to his run, and not to be undone, Sherlock added a few pirouettes and ended with a turning jump.
John smiled as his heart melted. “Well, I think I know a potential cure, Mr. Sigersen, but could you wait until say, 5:00?”
They needed shelter. Soon. No building could be trusted now. The blast had probably damaged the foundations of most structures in London, and the risk of collapse was everywhere. Therefore, find shelter that wasn’t a building.
Sherlock had crept into John and Rosie’s room at dawn, just as Rosie was starting to stir. He had allowed himself a single glance at John, sprawled across his bed, mouth slightly open, his brow unknotted and clear in sleep. Then he gathered Rosie up and took her downstairs before she could let loose her morning cry.
Sherlock could feel his muscles loosening, letting John in. He looked up at John and was amazed at his expression: love, affection, lust, bemusement, all mixed together.
, Sherlock thought, mentally gritting his teeth.  “Indeed,” he said. He pulled a second chair away from the wall and sat opposite her. “What will it be then?
“Pardon the interruption to your story,” Holmes said smoothly. “I wanted to be sure that my colleague heard your entire tale. Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, North Walsham, Norfolk –  Doctor John Watson. Doctor Watson, Mr. Cubitt.”
Jim started kissing along Sherlock’s neck as his hands stroked, stroked. “What I don’t understand, Sherlock, is if you had figured out who I was, why did you come to me anyway?”
I’m ready to hear ‘wife’. I’m ready to hear ‘girlfriend’. I’m even ready to hear ‘husband’. I’m not ready to hear, “…flatmate.”
“I did my undergrad working at the Carlton theatre nights and weekends,” Jerome said. “I know that stuff.”
John blinked for a moment, then straightened in his chair, abandoning his notebook and facing Holmes dead on. “All right. You said I had been in Afghanistan.”
John was surprised; this was the most Sherlock had shared about his time away. He had known, intuitively, that the time away had not been all fun and games, but he hadn’t realized the extent of it. “What happened?” he said at last.
He had to admire the courage of the woman, speaking to him so quietly while he held a gun at her. She had said her name but it had already flitted out of his memory. A quick glance told him everything he needed to know:
“All right, I’ll go. I’ll take the morning train out,” Nathan Garrideb said, reluctance still framing his voice.
His eyes went up to Sherlock’s again. Sherlock’s eyes were twitching all over the room – from John’s eyes to his rumpled shirt, to the scar on his shoulder, to his feet.
Sherlock insisted that he no longer needed the hospital room, and John was quickly moved in. He had snarled in frustration when he was shut out of the room, but Mrs. Hudson reasoned with him that the doctor needed some time to evaluate John’s condition. Instead Sherlock had paced incessantly in the hallway until they had let him in again.
“A first edition of Gray’s Anatomy,” Sherlock murmured. He realized his heart was beating faster, and forced himself to breathe slowly. “This is priceless.”
The chaos in the dressing room area magnified by another degree. Dressers rushed past with racks of costumes, brushing past dancers stretching out in the hallway.
I keep trying to tell myself that mundane is fine. That there’s no guilt, no confusion, no mixed feelings with mundane. Boring, yeah, but easier.
“Just a mo, Hopkins,” Greg said. He’d just gotten his lunch, it was still hot. He wanted a hot meal, just once.
“You’ll get to see spring coming in,” Dunworthy said wistfully. “Seasons are more regulated now, since the Climate Control Act in 2038.”
“Lassiter can shut it. Department resources be damned. The moment I heard he’d sent you to 2007 Afghanistan I started putting together a recovery team. It’s a damn dangerous era, it’s an eight really, Lassiter had it moved to a five for his own purposes, and you ended up getting badly hurt.”
After the events on Miranda and the broadcast of the horrifying evidence of the Alliance’s role in the rise of the Reavers, the repulsed citizens of the Outer Rim planets began to rebel. The rebellion grew exponentially, leading to the Miranda Wars. Faced with the ire of a populace which had grown in numbers and firepower since the Unification War, the Alliance fell. A new government, referred to as the New Alliance, rose to take its place, promising a better synchronicity with the people it governed.
He was startled when he got a mouthful of water. Gagging, floundering, coughing, he fought against his exhaustion, but couldn’t stop imagining his lungs filling with water and pulling him down.
Both John and Sherlock had their coats on and were following Lestrade out the door before Molly could finish her sentence. They were in Lestrade’s car and in motion before John thought to say, “Oh – which cake won?”
Sherlock was laughing. His nose wrinkling, his chins folding up, his eyes streaming, he was laughing. Mouth wide open, he laughed straight from his belly – not the controlled chuckle or bemused snort he sometimes used – but full out laughing.
“What is she saying?” John says. His hand is all twisted in the sleeve of Sherlock’s coat. “Is it true? Sherlock?”
It was always a danger with time travel, to accidentally create a situation where timelines were affected. It was drummed into every History major before they were even allowed near the labs – ‘Don’t look up or try to find past family members.’ ‘Don’t get involved with historical figures.’ ‘Stay away from areas or situations of known historical impact.’ He remembered his first year teacher repeating ad nauseum,
Everything was chaos then, with the cracking of furniture and bodily thumps, and over it all, an enraged wordless scream. John’s hands pressed against the fire in his leg, feeling the stickiness of the blood on his hands. He remembered when he was shot in Afghanistan, feeling the blood sink out of him and taking all his will and hope with it. He remembered being evacuated, each jostle of the stretcher sending a new wave of pain through his body. Fever and infection made the days blend together, until he saw Colin Templar bending over him, dressed in a contemporary nurse’s uniform, saying, “You missed the rendezvous, Mr. Watson. I’ve come to take you home.”
Sherlock inhaled, almost dizzy with his confession, and nearly immediately began to backtrack. “Apologies, John, I spoke out of turn. Overtired, I suppose, coming down from the case. Excuse me, I’ll just-”
“Think, John, really think. Everyone here has a job, has a way to apply their skills. Millie, with the food. Eileen can organize the search teams, and is your right hand here. Gemma. Rajjit. All of them have a role to play to make this place work. What in heaven's name can I do here?”
Sherlock gesticulated - twice. “I had to file both versions, the German and the English,” he explained.
Lestrade’s mouth twisted into an incomplete smile. “We’re not complete morons, you know. Of course. Different dentists.”
“This woman saved my life,” he said. He stepped back to Maja and grabbed her by the arm, pulling her forward. “She would like to seek asylum in the United Kingdom.”
Sherlock looked down at his hands, at the paper dog his hands had created while he was talking. “Origami. It’s a very old art, from Earth-that-was. I learned it at the Academy. I do it after a case; it helps me order my mind.”
Suddenly his mouth was full of water. He gagged, and rose inelegantly to the surface. Despite his shock, he was able to look around and ascertain that none of the drones had followed him, and he was a fair distance from the skyhome. He could see the drones buzzing around the surface at the base of the skyhome, and poli-copters flying towards them from Edgewater. None of them noticed him. He nodded with satisfaction, and turned his attention to his breather.
John sat back in his chair and grinned as he took a sip of whisky. He loved listening to Sherlock and Rosie together; how he spoke with her as if they were having a university level discussion, despite the fact that she only had a couple of words in her vocabulary.
Holmes arched an eyebrow at John before shifting his attention to the slip of paper Mrs. Hudson handed him. “Interesting,” he muttered. In one swift movement, he stood, set the paper aside, and tapped out his pipe. “I am called for, to Brixton,” he said, shrugging out of his dressing gown and reaching for his jacket. “Put your coat on, Doctor Watson, and come along, should you wish to learn more about my profession.”
But dinner was relaxed, filled with conversation about last night’s case, and today’s shift at the surgery, and their plans to travel to Sussex to the Holmes’s cottage. Sherlock was breathtakingly beautiful by candlelight, and John was warm with happiness and hope.
Sherlock nodded, not taking his eyes off of John’s still form on the bed. He didn’t notice the doctor slip out of the room.
“She married Mr. Cubitt, not you,” John snapped. The man’s entitlement was deeply nauseating to John; it might have been appropriate for this era, but John’s modern sensibilities balked at it.
John considered. “Your wound is healing nicely,” he said. “We’d better tape some plastic wrap over the dressing. And you shouldn’t have any bath salts or anything like that. Just in case.”
John came and sat near Sherlock, but Sherlock noted that he carefully sat with his back to the camera. Sherlock tilted his head down, and found himself looking at John’s bare feet. He could see red spots and blisters forming at the heel and the ball of his foot. He realized that John had been dancing more than he had in years, and wondered what kind of callouses his feet had had back when he danced every day. His feet were vulnerable, and damaged, and hurt.
“Yes,” he sighed, impatiently. “I assume none of you want to come forward and confess? Never mind,” he said without pausing, “this is more fun anyway.”
“An excellent idea!” Garrideb said. “Come any time before four o’clock, and the landlady will let you in – Mrs. Tennant. Bennet? Henderson? Anyway, the woman downstairs. She has a key.”
He knew that Canadians were known for their diplomacy and their tendency to apologise for minor things. He had spent a fair amount of time in Canada, dancing in Toronto, Montreal, and Winnipeg, and felt confident in his ability to speak French and affect the Canadian affability.
“Ah, Watson,” Holmes said, putting on his gloves as John walked into the parlour. “This is fortuitous. I’ve just been called about a murder victim at Whittington Hospital. You can visit the morgue there while I examine the body. It’s a very modern morgue, I’ve been there several times.”
Sherlock shifted, moving even closer to John, then froze. He pulled away slightly and whispered, “Mrs. Hudson.” Only then did John hear her footsteps on the stairs.
Three days later, when Sherlock’s ribs no longer offered stabbing pain when he breathed, a large car pulled up to the shabby house.
Hours later, Sherlock was sitting on the bridge again, wrapped in a sheet and gazing out at the stars sliding past the window. He was sitting in the pilot’s seat, reclined back so he could see the stars and the tiny origami elephant he’d placed on the dash. He heard John padding up behind him, and felt his bare arms going around his shoulders.
Then Sherlock remembered the crates they had passed, full of equipment John had not yet unpacked. He wrenched himself from the bed and ran to them, running his hands through them until he found what he wanted.
Sherlock huffed. “I leave for all of three minutes, and you’re jumping to conclusions like a New Canaan sand bear. She’s not the murderer,
But Bahdri produced a passcard, and with a furtive glance around, swiped it and pulled John in. The building was darkened except for emergency lights, casting the familiar hallways into a weird glow. Bahdri didn’t answer any of John’s increasingly curious questions, just pulled him along the corridors.
Sherlock winced inwardly. It was one thing for him to be in the spotlight, he was used to it. He had hoped that John hadn’t been noticed. “Yes. He’s been assisting me.”
Sherlock looked down at his ruined ballet slipper. “And new shoes. From Bloch, in Drury Lane, if you please. They’re the best.”
The man stepped back, his arms rising in loose fists in front of him. John felt his face ratchet up into a smile as he did the same, and he could see Sherlock mirroring his pose beside him.
Their clothes seemed to melt off them, under the heat of John’s fingertips. John’s face was a strange mixture of sadness and joy as he kissed all of Sherlock’s scars, whispering love into them, tracing the lines of his still-too-prominent ribs. Meanwhile Sherlock was discovering the vast undiscovered territory of John’s skin and the varieties of texture and sensitivity.
Sherlock moved to the far left side of the mirror, standing at his full height. Then he began to glide to the right, while moving down. For all the world it looked as though he was going down an escalator. What made the impression all the funnier was the expression of pure boredom on his face. One could almost believe he was in Harrod’s.
"So you didn't attend, but I am the one being punished by being summoned to your stupid club for lunch?"
JOHN: My granny said she played euchre nearly nonstop for four years during the Blitz. Ready for the timestep?
“John put the earphones back on the skull, Mycroft. Just like it was, like nothing happened. The rug was ruined but we got a new one. John came back and he brought Rosie and now he’s happier.”
After a long time, he pulled his phone from his pocket and stared at it. His finger hovered over the phone icon, then over the chat icon. He held it there for a long time.
“I didn’t have many friends, as you can imagine. We lived on a large estate in Sussex, a good distance from the village. I had a nanny but she preferred to avoid work in general and me in particular, so I spent a good amount of my time alone. But there was another family that lived two fields over, and they had a boy about my age.
“You’re a good man, John,” Sherlock said without thinking. The second it was out of his mouth, though, he knew he meant it, as much as it ripped him open inside.
The daily rides back and forth to the studio were getting harder and harder. All Sherlock wanted was to lay his head in John’s lap, or have John curled up under his arm, or at the very least to hold hands while the city rushed past. To ignore him as though they hated each other was wearing thin.
“Yup.” John popped the P as he grinned, then winced as the astringent worked on his broken skin. “After Da died, weren’t no money at home. I was old enough and it seemed like the best thing. Happened that they needed medics at the time, so I learned how to march and patch folks up at the same time.”
He sighs, with his forehead tipped against mine. “I don’t fucking believe this,” he mutters. “After all this time.”
I don’t send him the address or closing time, but he shows up one minute before six. He’s wearing that coat even though it’s warm out, wrapped nearly twice around him, skinny bastard.
“I am for Scotland Yard. Tell Mrs. Hudson I shan’t be back for tea.” Holmes knocked on the ceiling of the cab, and it whisked him away.
But we don’t get very far before his phone goes off again. It’s on silent, but it buzzes. We both turn to look, and as we do, it buzzes again. It buzzes so much it’s kind of dancing around the table.
“Such a funny thing, borders and embassies,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I mean, here we are in the middle of Serbia, but within the gate, we’re actually in England.”
Careful to stay out of range of the cameras, John pulled from under the bed a length of rope fashioned from towels, sheets, and a rug from beside Sherlock’s bed. It was rough and ragged, but looked strong. Then he pulled out the poker from the fireplace. He had managed to bend it into a J shape, and Sherlock shivered internally at the mental image of John bending it, against the radiator perhaps, his muscles straining against the poker.
The rooms were large and airy, with large windows, and comfortable looking chairs. John was briefly mystified by the lack of a kitchen, then remembered that Mrs. Hudson would likely be preparing their meals.
Sherlock glanced away from the stove with an expression of mock dismay. “Don’t you believe in my abilities?”
“Excuse me?” John said. He was kneeling beside the open bag of amniculusite, looking around at the crowd.
He found himself pulled through the mass of people as if he was dreaming, pulled away from Commissioner Yun’s angry face, away from the swarm of hands pulling at him. Suddenly he was outside, and John was leading him away from the hotel, down the street to an alley.
John was quiet for a moment, and Sherlock thought that he had retreated, until John spoke again. “And why always the classical music?”
John’s face went utterly blank. “She knows nothing about all this. I was all alone out here and – she doesn’t know.”
John felt something huge and wonderful rise inside him like a bubble, and before he could stop himself, he let out a most un-Victorian snort of laughter. He turned his head away from Holmes, towards the window, to hide his face.
But there was something about Sherlock; as if he was constantly clothing himself in sackcloth and ashes and soot, and covered it over with a Spencer and Hart suit.
They lay down side by side, chest to chest. The only space they allowed between them was the space to hold each other’s cocks, already dripping. John wiped at the head, making Sherlock tremble, spreading the liquid over Sherlock’s cock, until it was slick. Sherlock licked his own palm thickly until the slide of his hand over John was smooth.
I lay the guinea pig in his arms, and he freezes for a moment, as if he’s not quite sure whether she’s going to blow up. Then he lifts one hand and starts patting her. God, his hands are enormous, his whole hand is as long as the poor pig. He pats her for a long time, and then he smiles down at her.
John was lying on the bed, still unconscious, an IV drip in his arm. “He was badly dehydrated,” said the doctor, “and a bit malnourished, and there’s some nasty bruising. Perhaps a cracked rib, but there’s nothing I can do for that. He just needs rest now.”
Slowly, the reporters dispersed. The moment they’d all gone, Mrs. Hudson hugged him fiercely, not hearing his gasp of pain. “Oh Sherlock! I was so worried! We thought – oh, we thought you had – oh, it’s just been terrible!”
Sherlock looked up, but his sightline was flooded with the image of a sandwich. John was holding it out directly in front of Sherlock’s face.
Somewhat predictably, Rosie fell asleep within ten minutes, her head pillowed on John’s leg. Sherlock sat with his feet on the sofa, peering over the tops of his knees, unusually silent for the whole film.
“…and we just find the one name in common.” John grinned at him. “That’s ruttin’ brilliant, that is.”
An explosion of muscle and sinew, the wind brushing his face, and then the slap of the solid steel of the girder under his foot.
Moriarty in person was much like the Moriarty in the proposal vidder, with a smile that was both inviting and shy, and eyes that were bright and wide as if something exciting was about to happen. His voice was soft but clear, and Sherlock strained to hear every note in the cadence of it.
John’s voice went hard. “That wasn’t a little spider, he was at least an inch around. And I’ve seen spiders in Kandahar the size of your big fluffy head. Heard a big American marine scream like he was twelve.”
“Time, and I guess some behavior modification therapy, if it’s severe. But why do you need to get over it?”
“Look,” Sherlock said as John came around to his side of the desk. “We were looking at the dentist as a common factor, but they were all different. But hygienists work in multiple offices, all over Persephone City.” He tapped the screen a few times. “See, there’s a list of the hygienists at the first victim’s dentist, and,” he opened another window, “the second, and…”
I’m half expecting to see a line of desperate cases queued up down the street, but there’s no one there except for some people getting coffee from the café next door.
Greg smothered his own laughter. He had done a similar trick with his nieces and nephews, and they had laughed as hard as John. He was fairly sure, however, that he had not done it as skillfully as Sherlock had just done.
In the end, it was easy. After some time, they saw a man sauntering up the road to the house, and he barely had set foot inside before Martin had the cuffs on him. John was glad to see the man surrender immediately, sitting sadly with his manacled hands dangling between his knees.
His body was wrung out, exhausted, but his mind was quiet in a way it never was after a rehearsal or even a performance. The closest feeling he could compare it to was the day when he first successfully performed multiple
Sherlock smirked. This was going to be good. He began to flick his tongue in a way he had learned long ago.
Sherlock sat with a sigh, buckling his seatbelt. The plane began to move even before he had settled in his seat.
“You admitted it to me, Sherlock,” Maja said. “Back in the alley. I’m wearing a bodycam; I’ve got the evidence now.”
Then Mrs. Hudson was beside him, her cool hand on his. “Come now, Sherlock dear,” she said, and her voice was soft and beckoning. She pulled slightly on his hand, and he rose and followed her.
could mean twenty minutes, or next week. John kisses him on the top of his head, and Sherlock’s left hand wanders up and cups John’s cheek, without looking away from the microscope. I go over and kiss Sherlock on his cheek. He wipes it off with an eyeroll.
Immediately John feels the rope jerk, and it rises, inch by inch. The moment John’s skin leaves the water and feels air again, he begins to shiver. He grips onto Sherlock’s clothes with his hands like claws.
“Nothing. I had planned some experiments, but they’re not urgent. I’ll do them if Watson naps, they’re not toxic anyway.” John opened his mouth, but Sherlock beat him to it. “And I’ll tell Lestrade no cases until you return.” He held out his arms, and Watson gave him a huge, cheesy grin.
“Would you kindly prepare the following for me, wrapped and labelled: one Burberry scarf, labelled G. Lestrade; one Burberry umbrella, for Mycroft Holmes, a Cartier watch Tank model, for Molly Hooper; a Smeg stand mixer, in purple, for M. Hudson; an Orion Observer 80mm telescope, for Rosamund Watson. How long to put that together?”
He took a breath, then turned to review their supplies. Thank goodness for Mrs Hudson, and her tendency to buy him groceries whenever she shopped for herself. Sherlock had often resented her motherly interference in his life, but for the moment he was grateful for the supply of food. He was glad that she had been visiting her sister in Kent and therefore was likely safe.
There was a desperation, a hollowness to Mycroft’s voice suddenly, and it made Sherlock freeze. He became aware of the sounds in the background of Mycroft’s call – shouting, running feet. Mycroft’s voice was echoing, as though in a hallway with bare walls and floors, not like the sound-absorbing carpet of Mycroft’s office or the hotel-like hallways of Whitehall.
Up to John’s old room. A nearly full bag of nappies he’d bought for Rosie – or was she potty trained now? Take them anyway. A moment of hesitation, then he opened the safe in the corner and took out his gun and a box of bullets. He tucked the gun into the back of his trousers, bullets in his pocket. Picking up the bag of nappies, he thought, for a wild moment, what joke John would make about carrying nappies and bullets at once –
“Don’t deny it, Sherlock. I know you don’t really have the family background to tell you that this is not the way to behave, but it isn’t. I should never have – I turned you away, and turned you away, and I hurt you over and over again. Mentally and physically.”
Sherlock moved across John’s body, tucking his hands onto his hips, and John’s arm snaked around Sherlock’s neck as he turned. Sherlock released his weight, trusting in the strength of John’s arm, and found himself parallel to the floor, mere inches above the ground. The crowd gasped, and John grinned down at him.  Sherlock placed one foot on the floor and pushed himself back up.
“No.” He moved into an arabesque, tested the flexibility of his lifted leg, lifted it higher. “Never felt inclined. I was always interested in perfecting the choreography of the pieces I’ve danced.”
“You heard my life story. Hell, you probably figured it out by the way I combed my hair this morning. I want to hear ‘bout your story now.”
“Yes, but I have a more practical set. That one is more for decoration. Too heavy. It was a gift from a client. Do you play?”
“You will be protected, Sherlock, be assured. As will Captain Watson, if that is your concern.” Mycroft raised his voice slightly. “Captain Watson, return your ship to the Docks, if you please.”
She stood up obediently, and he put her coat on. Two minutes. He grabbed the nappy bag and gazed over the flat, trying to think of anything he might have forgotten.  Picking up Rosie and holding her close, he left the flat, closing the door behind him. Quickly and carefully he took her downstairs, down to 221C.
Mrs. Hudson is watching telly in the sitting room when we get back. “Oh my,” she says when she sees me. “Another arsehole, dear?”
John stood behind him, his hands warm and firm on Sherlock’s shoulders, as Sherlock flew the ship into the Black.
John grinned. “Already started one. In the bathroom, out of towels. Which reminds me, can I borrow one from yours?”
John said nothing, but Sherlock could see a tear sliding along the side of John’s nose. Sherlock squeezed his hands. “Besides, she’s the best liar I’ve ever met, and I work in
John’s pencil stilled again. He could barely see the page before him, gone blurry in the light of the fire and the impact of Sherlock’s words. Sherlock had bared his body and his mind, made himself vulnerable in every way, all so John would see him. How could he possibly respond to this?
He finished the picture of Harry, and laid it next to the picture of Rosie. He looked at the two pictures for a long time.
“You own a café. You started it with someone but now run it on your own. One sister, lives abroad. Mother dead, father estranged – no, reconciled now. You don’t care for your stepmother but you tolerate her for your father’s sake. Former sex addict-”
“He was, and I am most distressed to hear of this development,” Holmes said. His voice was strong again, John noted with some relief. “I had hoped to prevent any harm to this household, and am sorry that I arrived too late. This is your case, sir, but I have worked frequently with Inspectors Lestrade and Gregson of Scotland Yard – do you know of them?”
“Of course! He is well known in the city, and still honoured. I thank you, gentlemen, and wish you good day.”
“It’s built up so much since I was last here,” John said, his head still out the window. “All those cranes!”
He’s down less time this time, but to John it feels like his whole life lived over again. Sherlock rockets out of the water at the same time that John can feel the weight lifted from his foot.
Earlier in the morning, Sherlock had overheard an argument between John and Maja. They were speaking softly and in Serb, but the house was too small for the conversation to be completely private. Sherlock didn’t hear every word, but John seemed to be worried about leaving his patients behind. Maja was snappish in return, saying something about “silly” and “holiday” before sweeping off to finish packing. Sherlock came out of his room then, and caught sight of John standing in the corner of the living room, leaning heavily on his cane, looking angry and forlorn at once. His face cleared when he looked up at Sherlock, and said, “Coffee?”
Sherlock kept walking, resisting Maja’s pull on his shoulders. He fixed his eyes on the Union Jack, at the gates between him and it.
Mrs. Hudson turned to Mycroft with a pointed look. He stood, buttoned his jacket, and picked up the recorder.
One night, he dreamed of a mouse on the Tube tracks. Its fur was nearly the same colour as the grimy floor, and it had a little hole near the tunnel. Rosie was down on the tracks, wearing clean yellow footie pyjamas, her hair in a tiny whale spout on top of her head. She was crouched over, trying to see the mouse in its hole. John was down there too, calmly suggesting to her that she should leave the mouse alone and come up to the platform. Sherlock was pacing along the platform, wishing that John would stop being so calm, grab the child, and come up, but John would not be swayed. Sherlock could see the train coming, and the conductor wasn’t watching but instead eating strawberries. Sherlock was shouting at John, but John couldn’t hear, and the train was getting closer and...
“Jesus.” John’s voice was hushed and worshipful. “Please tell me we can keep the costume after the run is over.”
Rosie blinked the sleep from her eyes and looked around, her forehead wrinkling in confusion in a way that was achingly familiar to Sherlock.
Sherlock moved across the room, pushing his hair out of his face as he paced. “There was another. Dancing men. But it was code and I solved it, and stopped someone getting murdered. John was very helpful with that one too.”
“Get the Glenn Gould recordings for me to perform to. Not the 1955 recording, the 1981 one, if your idiots here can manage that.”
There wasn’t enough air, there wasn’t enough oxygen in the room. All Sherlock could smell was curry and his own fear. “Just – just delete it,” he said.
Holmes slipped his hand through John’s arm. John’s shock completely dispersed his anger, then he mentally shook his head. Men were physically more demonstrative in this age; he could see others in the park doing the same and no one was looking askance.
Sherlock’s mouth was suddenly full of fluid, and he stumbled.  John steadied him but Sherlock altered their course, aiming for another side alley.
She came to the door quickly – she had clearly been waiting. “Oh, Sherlock dear, you’re back! He’s all right then?”
As John stepped into the hovercar, Sherlock noted that John had showered briefly, but that the water had been cold, either for economy or to expedite his waking up.
He left the stage and walked to his dressing room. The hallways were lined with eager fans, waiting to congratulate him on his performance. But as he passed, their faces froze from excited anticipation to shock to horror. Silence surrounded him, embarrassed and awkward.
There is a rumour that Audrey Hepburn, in her youth as a ballet dancer, smuggled secrets out of Amsterdam in her ballet shoe.
There was an extra layer of chaos at the crime scene when they arrived. When Sherlock had left, most of the police had been drifting around the overturned hovercar, but now they were huddled into two groups. The smaller group was still surrounding the security guard, but Sherlock could see one unfamiliar person in the middle of the other group, his head bowed.
“Ye-esss,” Sherlock said. He sat on the edge of the bed next to John. He looked less concerned that it would spin, and more that it would explode.
“Yes, dear.” Jim’s fingers rubbed along the crests of his hipbones, stroking deep and deeper into the angles of Sherlock’s groin. Sherlock swallowed back his nausea. “But isn’t it a lovely cage I built for you? I was telling the truth before, you know. I really do admire your mind. And now that belongs to me too. We can work together now. Picture it – us working side by side in that beautiful laboratory – it’s finished now, by the way – and creating the most amazing poisons. We’ll look at maps and blueprints in the library and devise the best way to break into banks.”
He pressed his face into Sherlock’s belly, the belly that had trembled as John drew him. He sighed as the tears came from him, finally, tears soaking into Sherlock’s skin.
John looked over at Sherlock, who was driving their hired car. He was momentarily hypnotized by the sight of Sherlock’s long fingers on the steering wheel, then shivered. “No. Are you?”
John and Rosie had moved back with Sherlock, and it was good for John, she could tell. The waves of sadness from him radiated a little less every day, and Rosie clearly blossomed at 221B.
“The average London house-thief would not understand the value of what is here – they would simply regard this as junk. Only aficionados such as ourselves would recognize the treasure here. Although – look! A telephone! A most helpful tool, but I cannot convince Mrs. Hudson to install one at Baker Street; she believes it would electrocute her. Now, Watson, we have a few minutes at least – let us explore.”
Hand in hand, they ran towards the gate. Sherlock stepped over the barrier, and Maja ducked underneath. Then they were outside the building that had been Sherlock’s prison.

“Mr. Maitland,” Sherlock said when he’d deemed they’d laughed enough, “tell me why you’ve chosen to call Captain Xu and bring us in rather than call the police?”
Sherlock let out an inarticulate bellow of rage, and charged after the car as though he might yank the radio out with his bare hands if he caught it. John was left laughing his silly arse off on the corner.
“Oh John,” Sherlock said. He put his face in his hands at the thought of John being beaten because of him.
Sherlock sighed. “A little. Poisonings are usually fascinating, but the whole point of using poison is to give yourself distance from the murder. Sticking around to gloat is terribly dull.”
“Well?” Lestrade said. Sherlock could hear the hope in his voice, and was angry at himself for not being able to tell them anything definite… yet. He would do it, though. He always did.
“I been handling amniculusite most of my childhood, on Regina,” John said. He turned and focused on Sherlock, ignoring the gaping mouths of the officers. “Amniculusite is blue, generally, but when you drag it on somethin’, it actually leaves traces of green.” He scraped the amniculusite along the pavement, leaving a faint blue tinge behind. “These are likely stultorumite with a good coat of paint. Actually, stultorumite’s a heap heavier than amniculusite, so it’s no wonder he couldn’t carry it far.”
“This is not a photography class, and I’m not going to teach you how to draw something with the accuracy of a camera,” she said at the first class. “Drawing is not about reproducing what is in front of you, but about bringing it to life on the page. In the hands of the right artist, art comes to life not in the lines you draw, but in the negative space between the lines.”
He saw John let go a breath, as if he had been holding it. “Well of course, you git,” John said. “You’re a ballet dancer. Dance ballet.”
Sherlock, meanwhile, was in his room having a minor crisis. He was confident in the chemical balance of yeast, sugar and warm water, and was pleased with its rate of rise; there would be a correct ratio of air pockets and bread in the finished product. But until he saw John diligently creating an (admittedly) pleasing design on his bread, Sherlock had not considered a ‘look’ for his loaf. Embellishment would, no doubt, be taken into consideration by the judges, and Sherlock’s competitive nature had been awakened. It was too late to, for instance, recreate the Mona Lisa on the surface of his bread without looking as though he had copied the idea from John. Besides, it was nearly time for it to go into the oven. He chewed at his lip, thinking, until the alarm on his phone alerted him to the conclusion of the second rise.
“That note was from me,” Holmes said. “I deduced your code and wrote the note. Mrs. Cubitt lies upstairs, near death. Your bullet struck her on its way to killing Mr. Cubitt.”
Yun slowly, carefully placed his teacup back on the tray. He sat, close beside Sherlock, and Sherlock moved even closer.
In the end, it took them over three hours to walk to Whitehall. It was arduous because all of Sherlock’s normal guides – the larger buildings, the Tube stations, the parks, the flats – were all collapsed or damaged. Trees were either blown into shards or lying across the road. While he was grateful for his innate sense of direction, it was more by luck than by skill he finally found himself in Trafalgar Square. Nelson’s Column had toppled, but the National Gallery and St. Martins in the Fields still stood, if badly damaged. The lions sat, staring out at the wreckage of London, unperturbed as always.
Jerome pulled up outside a building that staggered John’s senses. Most of it was a huge Victorian era stone building, with beautiful carvings across its façade; but on the north side of the building was a huge modern glass and steel addition, arching jaggedly at angles into the street. Even John, who was used to weird London buildings such as the Shard and the Gherkin, thought it looked a little out of place. Privately, John thought it looked like a flying saucer had crashed into the structure. Even Sherlock, who rarely noticed, let alone paid attention to non-crime related things such as architecture, paused for a moment to stare, frowning. Then he shrugged minutely, and they followed Jerome into the building.
“Terrible thing, down at the Manor. Inspector just came through from Norwich. One of the oldest families in the county, and now this terrible thing.”
Asif said, “Take a half hour break, Bernie,” then picked up the walkie-talkie to call security, but Moira raised her hand.
Sherlock raised his arm and waved lazily at the drones as if saying ‘hello’, and the drones swooped closer in response. “Careful, Jim. They’re still there.”
Sherlock blinked, and he realized he didn’t need to say a word – the answer was written all over his face.
. We chose that, he and I. But he’s gone now, so...” Her sight turned inwards again, and Sherlock knew she was lost in her memories of this man. “He said to me once that we all die alone. Goodness knows he kept trying to do so! But in the end, he died an old man, in his bed, and I made damn sure he didn’t die alone.”
“We’ll need to be quiet for a bit,” Sherlock said, “until they get into the champagne I left for them, then they’ll be making enough noise that we can talk without being detected.”
The day before he was to go to Jim, his vidder rang. The noise startled Sherlock; it hadn’t rung in several days. He answered without thinking.
“The Rim can be dark, and wide, and vast. Some think it’s cold, and lonely, but I never felt that out there. I was with the right people, and I never felt alone.” She laughed to herself. “Mal - the captain - oh, he was a
Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise. John was fully dressed and standing on the far edge of the shower room, his plaid shirt and jeans sharply dark against the white tiles. Normally if anyone had intruded on Sherlock in the shower, he would have snapped at them, ordered them out. But now, he didn’t.
Behind him, he could hear the recording of John and him arguing, and Maja’s breathing, fast and with the edge of a whimper of fear. John was absolutely silent, and somehow Sherlock took his greatest courage from that.
Mycroft sighed and studied him through the screen, across great distance, with Sherlock’s face only inches from the screen.
As they rose, Sherlock stared at the windows, at the sight of Edgedown Docks getting smaller and smaller. Soon all of Persephone City was laid out before him, and he could see the bustle of the people of the city transforming into toys, then ants, then specks of dust.
Be Prepared – Blame in the Wrong Place – Windowcases and Widows – Husband Material – Possession and Confession – a Startling Realization
In the glow from the phone, he saw Rosie raise her head and study the picture. After a long moment, she leaned forward and kissed the surface of the phone.
Nathan Garrideb bit at his lips, clearly trying to find an excuse that would get him out of going. “I don’t like to leave my-”
When we developed our arrangement, they insisted that I continue to date, with their willingness to back me up in case of bad dates. I think they’re worried that I’m going to get tired of them and want to move on. Truthfully, I’m rather happy with the whole situation at the moment. I only go out on the dates now because
Sherlock forced his shocked muscles and brain to move, to act, to think. He took Maja by the hand. She was still standing and staring at the window where John had disappeared, but he pulled at her hand until she moved.
“It’s unforgivable, Sherlock, and yet you do. You keep forgiving me. And all you wanted… was for me to see you.”
Sherlock pointedly turned his back on John, taking hold of the barre and cracking his neck a few times. Then he began a series of slow
“No, it’s just that…” Lestrade scratched the back of his neck. “Well, he’s not acting quite himself. I think.”
Sherlock was silent, and John broke off the kiss to study Sherlock’s face. His breath was slowing to its regular rate, there was a slight sheen of sweat across his forehead and upper lip, and his eyes were wet.
“That’s what I’m here to discuss, of course.” She strode forward, extending one elegantly manicured hand. “Your star turn. Your performance.”
Sherlock darted to the body and stared intently at its feet, and the deductions began to flow. John found himself unable to do anything but stare.
Sherlock jumped to his feet and paced the room, his arms gesticulating in anger. “Perhaps find a woman for you to marry to completely remove the hint of homosexuality from your character. Perhaps that simpering maid at the Cubitt estate, I’m sure she’d be willing in a moment to-”
“No,” John said, the word nearly silent, without breath, at first. He licked his lips and tried again. “No, thank you, Inspector Lestrade. I’m fine.”
Sherlock looked up from his study of the corpse. To his surprise, it was snowing, which meant that vital evidence would be eradicated unless he hurried.
At that point I had had to stop and have a little wobbly. So did John – that, or he had something in his eye.
He hummed to himself, then began to scrape long curls from a bar of rich, dark chocolate. Then he carefully arranged the curls on the top of the cake to read ‘221B’. It was still plain next to John’s trees, but Sherlock nodded with satisfaction.
Sherlock addressed John’s bruised and sore feet. “You’re the most loyal person I know, John. I understand, I do. I – I’ll figure a way out once I’m at the theatre, I suppose, and-”
He drew in absolute silence for a time; the only sounds were the fire popping and the rasp of John’s pencil against the rough paper.
John’s father had screwed up the note and thrown it in the fire, and gave John a thrashing for expressing an interest in such a ‘pansy’ thing as drawing.
Sherlock stopped himself in time from saying ‘my brother’. The ever present camera would love to have evidence like that from his own mouth.
“Think he’ll stay away, after what you said to him? Well, never mind, he won’t get to you here. My security will keep him out. In fact, they can keep everyone out. And they’ll keep you in.”
“I don’t – I don’t understand.” His brain had slowed to a crawl, and he couldn’t force his brain to calm and think the situation through.
Sherlock looked over at John again - the way he held his body, the tension around his left shoulder. If he hadn’t had family support, if he hadn’t had a lot of money to have another career, he would have stayed in the army. He wouldn’t have left the army willingly, so...
John lifted his chin. No matter how late it was, he would not go up to his room. He would not close his bedroom door on the next scene. He would wait for Sherlock.
“All right, I’ll spell it out for you. I do jobs for Pavlović every once and a while. About four years ago he calls me and says, ‘I’ve got a mess here. Found a nest of MI6 agents in Belgrade. One is down but the other’s gone to ground. I have a good feeling who it is, but I need confirmation.’ So he set me up with John. Get close, get confirmation, then I can bring him in.” She paused, looking thoughtful. “I’ll admit, he’s clever. Never let his guard down, even after I married him. I thought he’d trust me enough to tell me.”
There was a door opposite his bed, with a small window high up on the door. Sherlock could see the edge of a peaked, olive green hat through the window. Military hospital, with a guard. Really not good.
It was late evening, and the fire had burnt down to its embers, glowing orange and white in the gloom of the sitting room. Holmes was smoking a pipe, filling the room with aromatic smoke, looking through his notes from the case.
“You can tell from the splatter pattern on the wall this was a crime of passion of jealousy obviously the killer struck from behind with an improvised weapon my bets are on the garden shears check the garage they’re likely missing then dig in the garden under the roses he’ll have buried them there but you know I could solve all of this much faster if you had just called me earlier instead of waiting until the scene is completely ruined by all you lot trampling about and destroying evidence it’s a wonder any of you graduated from police school or whatever you call it you’re all a bunch of incompetent fools now show me the victim’s toenails that will indicate whether she was actually having an affair or whether it was all in the killer’s fervid imagination come on come on let’s go!”
Sherlock smiled, and John basked in this smile, the one that was for no one but him. “I will admit that I was reminded.”
A light flashed at Sherlock’s desk. Sherlock glanced, and knew it was Lestrade with another case. Sherlock grinned as he looked back, and saw that his opponent was sitting back with a smug look. He looked down at the board.
“I was so angry, at first, then I saw that there was writing, and – can you refold it? I tried but-”
In reply, Sherlock moved to the side of the window, the right this time. He began to walk ‘downstairs’, marching down an invisible set of stairs. When he was half way across the window, his face broke with a look of panic and surprise, and he collapsed out of view
The silence and emptiness of the streets were eerie as they made their way southward. He had a bad startle when they reached Marylebone and saw an enormous pile of bricks and wood, with bodies lying amongst them. At first, he turned Rosie’s face away, until he realized that the bodies were the wax dummies of Madame Tussaud’s. He didn’t know whether to laugh or choke when he saw John’s favourite James Bond lying face up, his face dented and gray.
In less than five minutes he had pointed at a platinum ring, seven millimeters, beveled edge; identified the size of ring required; declined an engraving; paid. There was one in stock, for a mercy. For a moment, he simply stood and stared at the small green box in his hand, until a tiny smile crossed his face. As he tucked the ring away in his breast pocket, she saw a glimmer of the happiness that this man had in his life, that he hadn’t had before.
He broke the surface with a gasp - partly for show but more real than he wanted to admit to himself. He flailed in the water, taking a moment to notice that the newsvidder drones had followed him down. He reached out to the closest one, as if asking it to help him, then let himself sink back down into the water.
“You had better,” Waters said. “Marie already snuck out with her gown.” She let go of the jacket reluctantly and stomped off to tell Colin to return his tuxedo.
“They cleaned it up and bandaged it,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Enough blood to give us a good scare when you fell, but no damage to your organs or major muscles.”
“You pretended to not know how to use your own ruttin’ medi-kit so you could prove somethin’ about me.” John glared at Sherlock, then broke into a rueful laugh. “You are the most irritatin’ genius I’ve ever met.”
Her nattering dialogue brought a sense of normalcy back to the moment. It was, for a moment, as though he hadn’t been away for weeks, as though he hadn’t been held against his will, as though he hadn’t been frightened out of his wits on more than one occasion. As though John had lived here for ages, as though he was not back in London for the first time in years, as though John had not been in a Serbian prison two days ago.
Several of the younger students flushed and giggled, but John shrugged. He was a grown man and a doctor and the flatmate of Sherlock Holmes: nudity didn’t fluster him.
He took off his clothes and stepped under the shower, partly to give truth to his original lie for coming back here, and also to wash off the sweat and adrenaline of his attempted escape. He watched the water go down the drain, and worked to prevent his hope from going with it. He had to keep sharp; hopelessness would keep him from seeing opportunities.
She uncrossed her legs, crossed them the other way. “All of those things are about other people. Outwardly focused.”
John blinked, and followed her dropped jaw and line of sight to the door. To his surprise, Sherlock had just swept in, leaving a sea of staring art students in his wake.
“If you’ll excuse me, Sherlock, I’m going to see about these mythical strawberries. Shall I bring you back some?”
In a normal bathtub, John could lie almost completely flat, his feet against one end and his head propped up on the edge – much like what Sherlock was doing right now. And while this bath was long enough for Sherlock to do so, the far end extended well beyond John’s feet. And with a slippery surface with no friction…
Sherlock flattened himself and Maja against the wall. From the corner of his eye he could see John try to draw his body up closer to the rope, to lessen the volume of his body in the air.
“And of course the best stage crew in Serbia. It’s a pity none of them speak English. And while I know you speak passable Serb, they will all be instructed to not speak to you at all. They don’t want anyone to interfere with your concentration.”
Brigit and Mrs. Perry glanced at each other. Mrs. Perry patted Brigit’s hand, and suddenly John liked Mrs. Perry a lot more. “Well now, sir, I’ll start, and Brigit can fill in what I miss. We were both asleep in our rooms upstairs - our rooms are right next to each other, mind. And we heard something, a loud noise like an explosion, and then nothing. I called out to Brigit, ‘Did you hear that?’ and she said, ‘Yes’, and we decided to go downstairs and see.”
The woman sighed. “I’ve heard about that happening. I’m glad you got her back. She’s very lucky to have you.”
One of the nurses standing by the bedside glanced at John, and he nodded. She carefully pulled the mask away from Sherlock’s face, allowing Sherlock’s voice to echo more clearly in the room.
JOHN: Seriously, it’s a good way to pass the time, learn something new. It’s not been that bad, has it?
Mycroft began to drone on about construction and rebuilding phases for the city of London, but Sherlock ignored them all, only drinking up the sight of John’s delight.
There was a long moment of John staring at Sherlock, and Sherlock looking down at the floor. Then Sherlock’s hands went to the buttons on his cuffs. Once started, Sherlock’s hands were steady and certain and unhesitating, stripping away his shirt and draping it over his jacket. John’s eyes were drawn, as they always were, to the small, neat bullet hole scar on his chest.
“Pity.” The man took a postcard from his jacket pocket and handed it to Sherlock. “Here. A small memento of your visit.”
understand how the world works?” Pavlović smiled, a thin varnish of calm over the anger Sherlock knew lay beneath. “Your brother. Mr. Mycroft Holmes. Now there’s a man that understands the world.”
“No. He has more jumpers than I can count. I have been told in no uncertain terms to leave his jumpers alone.”
Again, John’s face went hot. “I’m taking a night class on drawing. I just…” He hesitated, not sure how to explain. “I just… I like to…”
He looks at me, like he’s not sure whether I really want to talk about this or whether I’m just gathering ammunition to bust his balls about last night. “Yeah, my flatmate is a detective - a consulting detective. Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock’s disorientation upon waking lasted only thirty seconds or so, after which he swiftly deduced the orderly’s affair with the head nurse, then settled into insulting Mycroft’s new suit. John’s heart then settled back into his chest where it belonged, and he happily set about trying to convince Sherlock that he could not possibly leave the hospital immediately after being beaten unconscious by the McEwan gang.
The challenge ahead was not insignificant. There was survival, obviously; but there was Rosie’s mental health to consider as well. She didn’t really remember the loss of her mother, she had been too young, but at this age she would certainly wonder where her father was. Sherlock had no idea what was ahead, but he reinforced his vow there and then – to take care of Rosie, in every sense of the word, no matter what the future would bring.
John examined coins, books, manuscripts, and fragments of ancient clay pots. All was kept in excellent condition, and would be the envy of any museum. And unlike most collections and even some museums, all the articles appeared to be genuine. Holmes seemed equally fascinated, and John soon lost sight of him as they wandered around Garrideb’s room.
Ran back upstairs, found a large jug that used to contain white vinegar, rinsed the bottle in the tub, and started filling it with water. Rosie still fully entranced by telly. Another bag, filled with food from the refrigerator – leftover food, fruit. Thank God Mrs. Hudson had done some shopping before she left for her sister’s.
I seem to have finally gotten this idiot’s attention. He’s realized that I’m not focused on him anymore, but on my phone and on John and Sherlock.
“He just came in,” said Penny, a retired nurse pressed into service by John. “Eileen found him, but he doesn’t seem to be able to speak or tell us anything about himself. Shock. We see it a lot.”
John’s heart, which had only just begun to beat normally again, seemed to stop in his chest. “What?”
“True. But she can live knowing that her husband loved her and had concern enough for her to come to you.”
“I am not going to hurt you, or your baby,” she said clearly and slowly. “No one here is going to hurt you. We are not going to take your food. My name is Eileen. All right?”
“I know.” He gazed at her over the rim of his cup as he sipped. “We will see this beautiful story, hear the glorious music, see the costumes. You will watch the stage, while I will watch you, watch the beauty unfold on your face. Then we will return here,” he allowed his voice to deepen, “and I will show you a different kind of beauty.”
John showed Cubitt to the door and stood with him on the kerb as they waited for the cab to come around. Cubitt did not seemed to be eased by the sharing of his burden; he was still tense, clenching and unclenching his fists.
“Watson, I thank you for providing me with a new perspective on life, on my own thinking. You have given me much food for thought. And of course I accept your apology, unreservedly. But I’m afraid I require clarification on one point.”
“Okay.” I wonder if I can get the full story from John or Sherlock later, then I remember why I’m there.
John gazed at Sherlock. Curious: though the tension was seeping out of him now, it was clear that the party had terribly uncomfortable for him. John wondered what it was like for him, being around that many people, with deductions flying around the room like bees. He wondered why Sherlock had agreed to the party.
“Okay,” John whispered. He realized this was the first he had talked to Victor directly since this whole mess began. Victor had trusted him, so long ago, and so he had to trust Victor now. “Where?”
The tannoy whined into life. “Five minutes, please, ladies and gentlemen. Places for Ms Asbil, Ms Buchanan, Ms Davies, Ms Henson, Ms Coghlan, and Mr Reynolds. Warning for Mr King, Mr Shah, and Mr Watson.”
“Let us discuss this,” Evans said. His face smoothed into an ingratiating but unconvincing smile. “It took me planning for months to get that old codger out of this place. My former colleague and then my enemy, Roger Prescott, lived here, and had to leave his things behind. Look! Here’s his printing press, the best in Europe, and thousands of pounds already printed. No banker could tell the difference. Take what you wish, and let me run.”
“Let me touch you, please,” John said. His hands smoothed over Sherlock’s neck and shoulders, over the still wet silken robes he wore. “
Lestrade and Molly were safe as well; apparently they had been on a clandestine holiday in Bristol when the bomb hit, and returned as soon as it was safe to do so. Sherlock was so miffed at having missed that they were in a relationship it took him a while to respond to any questions about meeting up with them.
[This combo is faster, more aligned to the upbeat of the music. ‘Wow’ and ‘Like’ emojis are popping up, nearly obscuring the image of John and Sherlock dancing. Unbeknownst to our dancers, this video is going viral already.]
“You’re the crazy one,” Bahdri said. He released John, and John could see his eyes were wet. “Go and be happy, John. You deserve to be happy.”
John looked over at Sherlock, who was examining the handle on the vault from a distance of about two centimeters. “Looks same as usual to me.”
“I did. Found I liked it. Liked the runnin’ around, the excitement… living on risk, you know? And savin’ people… nothing like the rush of seein’ someone you thought was gonna die, stand up and walk out of the hospital.”
Sherlock’s head snapped back as though he had been slapped. He had known she was holding a secret from John, resentment of some kind, but he had no idea that it would be on this scale. And to hear her speak so coldly of John somehow hurt more than a fist would have.

“Well, dears, they’re both very nice, but in different ways. This one,” and she pointed to Sherlock’s, “tastes just wonderful, light and airy, while this one,” indicating John’s, “is a bit heavy – I think it was over-kneaded and under-proved, but the decorations are just beautiful.
At eleven, he went down to St. Paul’s. He sat on the same bench he had sat on the day he’d arrived, and thought about everything that had happened to him during this drop; how much it had changed him. He was in love, and he couldn’t wait to begin his life with Sherlock. It was a pity they had to leave London, but as he recalled, the furor over Wilde’s trial died down after a while, and although it took some time, the trial set into motion the movement towards gay rights.
“What did he say to you?” John says. He gets a murderous look in his eyes, and I worry he’s going to jump up and go after him.
Suddenly Romeo’s body arched, and he started to convulse. The actress’s eyes widened, and Sherlock heard a gasp run round the theatre. Sherlock’s frown deepened – he had read the play long ago, and deleted most of it, but he didn’t remember the scene playing out like this.
Hours later, they pulled up outside a low rise building, as elegant as a hotel but without signage. Sherlock was surprised – he was expecting they would be housed in a hotel such as the Metropol Palace or the Saint Ten. He looked at John, who shrugged. Maja looked slightly disappointed.
The lights faded to black, and the applause roared over Sherlock’s head like a wave. As soon as the curtain fell, he removed the mask, handing it to a stagehand, then crossed down centre to await his curtain call. Toby was there, his arm held high, ready to page the curtain; Toby had been the stage manager at the Royal for thirty years, and knew exactly how to judge the right time to open the curtain, at the absolute peak of the audience’s applause.
A few moments later he heard her breath go deep and regular. He allowed himself a glance at the photo, just for himself, then turned off the phone. He needed to save the battery.
Sherlock came up from behind him, and put his arms around his waist. “You’ll be brilliant. I already know you are, I just want everyone else to see.”
The question is, is the short blond guy the one for that? Problem is, you don’t know if someone’s going to be a bastard until it’s too late, and then you’ve got a bastard on your hands. So. Bastard-detector on full blast, and smile fetchingly.
John talked about the loneliness he had felt after Sherlock’s faked death, and the confusion that plagued him since his return. Sherlock talked about the places he had been while he was away, and how the memories of Baker Street and living with John had sustained him. John talked more about his mother’s alcoholism, and his father’s emotional distance. Sherlock talked about growing up with a house full of staff, very few of whom wanted anything to do with a small, curious child. John talked about being shot in Afghanistan; Sherlock talked about the injuries he had sustained while he was away. John talked about when he first decided he wanted to be a doctor; Sherlock talked about discovering chemistry as a teenager.
“There’s a lot of places to hide, either a person or the coin,” John said. “Look, the backstage of the theatre is right against the forest. That might go as far back as the road.”
“I don’t understand why you need to stay,” she said. Her eyes were reddened and still wet, her hands shaking.
“Mr. Reynolds, I think you’ll find that Sherlock can solve things quite quickly, with the right information. Would you please run down the situation for us.”
“Careful, Jim. The drones can’t hear us but they can see us, remember. They’re live to air too; there’s probably millions watching right now. This is a big event, you know – the last Companion, giving himself away. You don’t want to be shown on live newsvidder abusing your brand new personal Companion, do you?”
I send it before I think too hard, which I begin to wonder was a mistake as minutes tick by. I text again (grow up, you idiot!).
Bantam had a good head start on John, but John was a fast runner. As he closed the distance between them, John began to think about the situation: as much as John enjoyed an exciting chase and takedown, they were still in public and John was still not 100% sure this was their thief; his evidence at the moment was circumstantial at best. He decided to go with his earlier improvisation, try to talk to Bantam a bit.
He chuckled to himself at  Holmes’ image of a bullet frozen in midair by the power of love. Well, if anyone could do it, it would have been Mr. Cubitt; even from John’s brief time with him it was obvious he loved his wife very much. Mrs. Cubitt had regained consciousness while he and Holmes were there; she wept bitterly at the news of her husband’s death. So she had loved him too.
“Front row for me, then,” said Keith in his loud voice that sounded like he thought he was in a pub. John had taken an instant dislike to him on the first night – it seemed that Keith was less there to learn about art but had thought that the class would be a great place to find dates.
John closed the door to his room on Rosie sleeping peacefully. His hand still felt warm from Sherlock’s hand in his, neither of them letting go the whole walk back from the park. He could hear Sherlock pacing downstairs, and he let out a huge hissing breath.
He wondered if he was dreaming as he placed the cup against Rosie’s mouth. She drank slowly and solemnly, and he imagined that he could hear the cells in her body sighing in gratitude for the milk. Then he fed her soup and tiny pieces of the bread. From the corner of his eye he saw the cook wipe at her eyes and turn away.
John closed the door carefully after Garrideb, and looked up at Holmes. He was about to speak, but Holmes raised one finger in the air, until they both heard the door to the street close. Then Holmes put down his hand and said, “Well, Watson?”
“When they said you would be spending time at a rehearsal studio, I took the risk and brought my old shoes. Thought I might get a chance.”
“Am I expected to rehearse here?” Sherlock said innocently. “The ceilings are high enough, but there is insufficient clear space for me to work properly.”
A faint beep sounded from John’s panel, and John’s face collapsed even further. “Sherlock, I have to – that’s my boss, he – I’m sorry. I have to – I’ll talk to you later.” John disconnected abruptly.
“Ambassador! How good to see you!” Pavlović called out. “After the terrible plane crash, our medical professionals have saved the great dancer, Sherlock Holmes!”
Sherlock and the Admiral finished their tea in silence. Neither of them had spoken a word since Sherlock opened the door. The Admiral kept his head down, as if he was carrying a giant weight on his thin shoulders.
“I fucked everything up. Everything, Sherlock. I fucked up my original mission, and James was killed. I tried to go to ground, and ended up marrying an international assassin who
Instead, he quietly walked back out to the sitting room and retrieved his sketchbook and pencils. Then he went back into the loo and took the small mirror off the wall above the sink. Silently he returned to Sherlock’s room and placed the mirror on Sherlock’s desk opposite the bed. Then he carefully slipped back under the sheets. Sherlock didn’t wake, but grumbled adorably and burrowed his face into John’s hip.
They turned onto another small street, then down another alley. “How do they know? You get message out? How? Guards everywhere, all the time, I see this.”
“Are you two willing to make a public scene?” Sherlock said. “In the streets, right in front of the embassy? I can’t think that would go down well with your superiors.”
They manhandled each other down the hallway, Sherlock mostly leading the way but John pushing him along with his mouth and thighs. Sherlock’s jacket was wrestled off him and dumped just outside his bedroom door, and John’s shirt was mostly unbuttoned before they fell on the bed together. They grappled with each other’s clothes for a moment, until Sherlock got impatient and ripped his own shirt off, barely noticing the sound of buttons hitting the floor. John stood and stripped bare in mere seconds, then pulled off Sherlock’s trousers and pants, barely allowing Sherlock time to unbutton them.
He was dismayed to find that the ‘to let’ ads were few in number, and the ones that were there were more expensive than his research had led him to believe. If he wanted to stay in London proper, the forty pounds he had brought would not be sufficient for three months, especially if he wanted to eat more than once a day. Rents were cheaper outside London, as they always had been and always would be, but John knew that it would take him hours to get into the city every day. An alternative would be to get a job of some sort to supplement his income, but that would take precious time away from the work he had to do. If he wanted Dunworthy to follow through on his promises of tenure track positions and career development, he should at least return with research that would fulfil the requirements of the grant. John had never been one to settle for doing a half-arsed job anyway.
, he thought. He supposed that by Victorian standards, he would be excellent husband material – single, a doctor. Had he responded inappropriately? Should he have flirted back, or thwarted Brigit more clearly? This was something his etiquette training had not covered.
Sherlock went home. He waited for three days. He cleaned up his work but did not review his notes again. He sat in his sitting room, his hands steepled in front of his lips, thinking and staring into the fire.
Sherlock swiped at the tablet again to see the pictures of the victims: a Shepherd, a pimp, an Alliance soldier, teenaged son of a wealthy financier (his uncle had been a client of Sherlock’s), and now, a nurse. Absolutely nothing in common, nothing to link them together.
Their first stop was with Millie, who had fed Sherlock and Rosie when they first arrived. “I’ll never forget, as long as I live,” she said, dabbing at her eyes with her apron, “when the little one saw her father. Thought Dr. Watson was going to fall over where he stood. Proof that good things happen, even in the darkest times.” She gave Rosie a cracker, which was accepted with a mix of shyness and eagerness that made Millie laugh.
Sherlock lay on the sofa. He wanted a cigarette. He wanted to roar at the ceiling. He wanted to run. He wanted to turn up the stereo until the paintings rattled on the walls.
John pursed his mouth in a way that the cameras would read as irritation, but Sherlock knew was just for show. He wanted to kiss that pouting lip, to hold it carefully between his teeth. He hid his rising affection with a bark of, “Hurry up!”
“Professor Flynn - Maria. I am so pleased to meet you at last. The vidders do not do you justice – you are a stunning woman.”
JOHN:  So we put this together for you, for everyone out there who’s also isolating, for your amusement.
The nurse grunted, and Sherlock thought he was responding to his plea, but then it appeared as though he was affirming something to himself. He took a large vial from the tray, and carefully injected it into one of the IVs attached to Sherlock.
But Sherlock had already turned away from John and Mrs. Roshni to look at John’s pictures. Even though he knew Sherlock had seen them before, he felt his face flushing with the embarrassment he still couldn’t explain or prevent. He found himself anxiously watching for Sherlock’s reactions.
Janina uncrossed her legs, crossed them again the other way. The smile on her face was still there; she was clearly enjoying herself. Sherlock thought he was going to be sick.
“It’s difficult for you, isn’t it, General? Making decisions all day, every day, without rest. Decisions that impact other people. Decisions that could cost men and women their lives. And they follow you. They trust you to make the right decisions. It’s an enormous responsibility, and it’s exhausting you. So you make one more decision – to come and see me. Yes?”
He crouched over Rosie. She looked up at him and smiled, her blue eyes so much like John’s. She raised her hand and squeezed his nose.
[They run in a large circle around the room, tapping out the beats as they set the pace. Sherlock is adding a simple stomp-tap to alternating steps, while John is adding a counterpoint, staccato rhythm.]
They made brief excursions to Trafalgar Square, finding convenience stores and replenishing their supplies from the food shelves there. The smell of them was intolerable, with refrigerators full of dairy products without power for days, so they made such forays at the greatest speed possible.
Sherlock heard a soft rustle and sigh, as though John had shrugged. He wanted to reach through the layers of cloth and wood and springs of the sofa and touch John.
From his shuttered view of the floor between his feet, he sees John’s shoes. Cleaned but not highly polished; still spotted with sea salt from the boat; comfortable but not fashionable – John dressed prepared for activity, for a case unlike any other.
In fact his clients had been dropping off his roster. Embarrassed calls had been coming in since the bombing. Sherlock wasn’t sure if they were leaving because they were afraid after the bombing, or because of the rumours swirling as a result of the dance. He didn’t care. He barely noticed, and buried himself deeper into the case.
.  John shuddered at the thought of Sherlock at Reading Gaol, doing hard labour next to men who he had put in prison.
Finally he was able to crack his lids open a bit, and promptly closed them again. The room was filled with light, and it hurt his already aching head. He waited impatiently, his eyes barely open, for them to adjust.
Pavlović smiled, and the smugness of it both irritated and frightened Sherlock. He suddenly felt six years old, caught out in a lie by nanny. He tried to recover, keep his face impassive.
Sherlock was hit with a wave of exhaustion and an unfamiliar feeling of gratitude towards his brother, for understanding.
“I have clearly been sent here to dance, to prepare for the performance I’m to give as the price of my freedom. You’re here, but you’ve already made it clear that you’re not here to guard me, or babysit me; besides which there’s the lunk outside the door doing that already. So. Why are you here?”
“Of course I know your schedule, but the question was rhetorical, I know how it went. Your collar is still wet.”
They were admitted into the house by the maid, a pale young thing with tears standing in her eyes. When John explained who they were, she whispered, “I’ll fetch the Inspector for you, sirs,” and fled the foyer.
“I – Holmes, I-” John took a deep breath, straightened his back, and took courage in hand. “I do not regret kissing you, Holmes. I’ve wished to do so for a long time. But I should have asked your permission before doing so, and for that I ask your forgiveness.”
“There is nothing to be sorry for,” John said. “It is their loss that they cannot see the gifts you bring them.”
John had to go down to Mrs Hudson’s flat to deliver some mail and talk about a few things, but took a great deal longer than Sherlock had expected. He went down to investigate and found them, not locked in mortal combat with an intruder, but sat in front of the television watching a show that seemed to have something to do with baking.
He turned his head to see John, awake, gazing at Sherlock with his head propped up on his hand. He had a small smile on his face but his eyes were sad.
At one point in the night, Sherlock lay down on the bed next to John and they kept talking. Then John was quiet for a long time, but Sherlock kept talking, not realizing that John had fallen asleep. He kept going until he too fell asleep, mid-sentence.
John’s eyes roved over the silken cushions on the elaborate divan, the velvet lined walls. “I – I dunno where to sit down.”
Michael heard his name and came over. “Hey John. I think you’re the second last, it’s just Marie to come through now.”
“You’ll get it,” Sherlock said, shifting Watson in his arms as she stuck her thumb in her mouth. “I’m surprised Great Ormond even needs the interview – one look at your resume shows you’re quite qualified.”
“I won’t floor it unless I actually see someone after us,” John said. “Tryin’ to be as subtle as possible.”
Seiji Ozawa is a orchestra conductor whose origins are Japanese and who has conducted with the San Francisco Symphony, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Meanwhile, Sherlock had made a caramel, the boiled sugar precisely the correct colour. “I’ll do the first few, for the top,” Sherlock said. “I’ve spilt enough chemicals on my hands, burns don’t bother me anymore.”
Huge thanks to my betas, besina and shamelessmash, who helped immensely, emotionally and practically, by alternately challenging me and squeeing at me. Thank you as well to @weneedtotalkaboutsherlock, who did a beautiful cover art for this fic, but I haven't figured out how to attach it yet!
When the film neared its end, and Scrooge was capering through the streets of London, John risked a sidelong glance to Sherlock. Were his eyes slightly watery, or was that a trick of the light?
“I’m sorry for your troubles,” John said helplessly. There were some times, he thought, when etiquette really was a useful thing in uncomfortable situations.

He took Sherlock’s cock in hand, groaning himself at the feel of it, the hardness and silkiness of it, and at the feel of Sherlock’s response. Sherlock was leaking so much that John needed no further lubrication, and began to stroke. Sherlock jerked in his arms, his fingertips stuttering across John’s skin. John realized that Sherlock was close, so close; understandable if this was his first sexual experience with another person. He wondered if he should slow down, try to draw out the sensations for Sherlock, but then Sherlock’s eyes flew open as if in shock, his body froze, and then he was coming, spurting out over John’s hand and belly.
So much had been left unsaid for months, years. Apologies, clarity of intentions. Declarations. Definition of terms.
He didn’t know why he was twitting John so much. He was angry, angry at himself and his situation, at his own helplessness, and John was nearby. Good enough for Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson carried on, undeterred. “And it’s unlikely that that Pavlović fellow would do you a favour and confirm that the man they have is the John Watson we’re talking about.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to the camera in the corner of the room. He forced his face to be lax and without fear or tension. He unclenched and relaxed his hands. But he couldn’t stop the staccato beat of his heart, broadcast loud and clear by the monitor.
“Listen, arsehole.” John leaned in, finger in Sherlock’s face, then spoke quietly. “There, you see? That iron girder sticking out on the west wall? Do you think you can make that jump?”
The song ended, and John leaned over, hands on knees, panting. Sweat rolled off his cheeks and nose and to the floor. Sherlock stepped quietly into the room, not wanting to startle John. At the sound of his step on the hard wood of the studio, John turned to look at him, then straightened.
“Ah, right. Well, you’re not the first to make that assumption. But we’re not a couple,” John says gently.
A few days later, John learned that summer in Victoria, British Columbia, is extremely rainy. He supposed the lush green of the gardens and fields had to have this level of rain, but he was starting to feel claustrophobic. It was still better than the smoggy heat of Toronto, though.
I’m not as familiar with tap as I am with ballet, so I turned to YouTube for help. John’s warm-up is based on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjioNfZSVVY&t=187s (watch for the little monkey in the background!)
Eventually Sherlock made his way around the room and had arrived at John’s little display. “Hello, John,” he said as he walked up, his face neutral and unsmiling.
His voice had been casual, almost friendly before; disarming. But now, abruptly, it was cold and devoid of empathy. The gun wasn’t even pointed at him but Sherlock felt a rill of fear run down his neck. He watched in fascination as a similar shock passed through his attacker.
Bantam groaned, long and with a slight hitch in his voice. “We needed the money,” he said. “I needed the money. We’re not making enough from ticket sales.”
“Are you time-lagged?” Michael peered at John closely. “You were gone for a long time, right? Bound to have some lag.”
Sherlock whispered into his ear, and John didn’t understand but nodded anyway. Then they were standing and pulling each other down the hall to Sherlock’s room.
“Watch. Heel toe heel toe heel toe heel toe.” John’s feet moved in tandem to the side, then returned. Sherlock did the same, feeling his muscles spark and come to life.
He looks a bit weary, and I wonder how often this happens to him. The flatmate must be some handful. Still not convinced about the husband/wife thing though.
John laughed, feeling lighter and a little giddy. He pulled Sherlock to his feet, pulled him down the corridor to the bedroom. “It’s easy,” he said.
There had been a bit of a bidding war for Sherlock’s company to the Persephone Ball. It indicated the dwindling number of working Companions on Persephone, with Sherlock still considered the finest. Mycroft had handled the competition, balancing the factors of money, prestige, and personality. Sherlock had no interest in the money itself, nor the prestige; if it were up to him, he’d just pick the first name on the list and be done with it. He had to admit that Mycroft, with his diplomatic skills honed in the New Alliance, was better at figuring out the best candidate to accompany Sherlock, and was far better at soothing the egos of those who had not succeeded.
“And you fulfilled every prophecy of Ms Serra, and are more beautiful now than ever. It’s outrageous, it’s not fair.”
Pavlović, still smiling in a way that crept under Sherlock’s skin, walked out the flat’s door with the driver, closing it behind him.
The Commissioner’s eyes glazed over a bit as Sherlock bit into the strawberry. “I already have the best in the room with me now.”
The lock gave way. He opened the door, dragging everything into the flat, and then to the bedroom off to the side. The smell of mildew and dust filled his nose.
It was so unlike Sherlock to be at a loss for words that John sat up, a different kind of alarm spreading across his body. Sherlock was in his pyjama bottoms, an inside-out tee shirt and his blue dressing gown, fiddling with its belt. “Sit down,” John said softly. Sherlock hesitated for a moment before slowly entering the room and sitting on the very edge of the bed as if it was about to explode.
“We are not the idiots here,” she said, and smiled up at him. He nodded once more and left the room.
He wasn’t sure what either of them said when they were finally naked in front of each other, what exact words were murmured as they touched each other’s bodies for the first time. But the tone of the words was sweet and deeply loving and full of soaring joy of being alive, alive together.
“You’re too kind.” He turned to the Commissioner. “Commissioner, may I present Tjinn Harbord, my former classmate at the Naditu Academy. Tjinn, Commissioner Edward Yun. Who are you here with, Tjinn?”
Rosie was most comfortable when she was within arms’ reach of Sherlock, but she was also reluctant to let John out of her sight, as though he might disappear the moment he stepped away. The challenge was that John had duties around the church as the resident doctor and de facto leader of the group, and he therefore could not stay with Sherlock and Rosie all the time. She would consent to John’s leaving if she could curl up next to Sherlock, but would hum with anxiety, staring at the door until he returned.
“You let the Yarders take all the credit; you don’t seem to care. You hardly slept or ate for three days while you were working on this case. No one paid you. Why do you do it?”
Sherlock disconnected hastily and pondered. This was an unexpected turn of events. Without Lestrade, he would have no way of accessing the New Alliance resources and information about the case. No matter – he had solved cases without the New Alliance many times before. He could solve it himself and simply –
, you crazy man, you’re insane,” John said, laughing and shaking his head. He ran to Sherlock and pulled him into his arms and back towards the bed. “We could have –
It felt like failure of the greatest degree to reverse his steps, to climb back up the platform and back into the window. Only a few minutes ago the window had meant escape, it had meant triumph; now it was defeat to walk back into his prison.
was Pavlović’s smirk; a taunting reminder of the home he was likely never going to see again. His stomach jerked and turned to stone.
He heard the first woman, his guide, speaking to the cook. He wished he could remember their names so he could teach them to Rosie.
“We need to stop wasting time complaining,” Sherlock interrupted, “and more time solving this ridiculous matter. The facts, if you please.”
They stared at each other across the room for a long moment. Then John grinned, shy with an edge of mischief, and scratched the back of his neck.
“Eileen leads the teams who search for food,” John said. He waved over Eileen, who handed a large bag of flour to Millie before shaking Sherlock’s hand.
,” John says again. “That was fun for us, but not for you, I think,” he says, looking a little worried.
He turned; Sherlock was right behind him. The glassy look was still there, but a slightly amused smile broke through it. “May I?”
“Such a handsome man,” she whispered. “At least, when the bruises fade. His face has… character. What colour are his eyes?”
Mrs Hudson’s protests of ‘against the rules’ and ‘not the way it’s supposed to go’ were quickly drowned out by the exclamations of wonder: at the beauty and structural soundness of the tower, at the airy quality of the pastries, at the smooth, rich taste of the cream, at the exquisite detail of the tiny, chocolate garnishes.
Sherlock could not disguise his confusion, and Mycroft sighed again. “I’m not without influence, you know. Through my role with the New Alliance, I could-”
After only a few minutes’ drive, they pulled into the courtyard of a building. Sherlock waited in the car pointedly until the guard came around and opened the door for him. He looked up at the building, seeing large windows, with dim figures behind them. He wondered what would happen if he bolted, ran back toward the way the car had entered, or screamed “Help me!” towards those shadows. He looked back to the guard and the driver, saw the matching lumps at their waistbands under their jackets, and knew he’d be dead before he took a third step.
“How many times am I going to lose you, Sherlock? When you fell, it nearly killed me; you’ve nearly died so many times since, and every time I thought, ‘Don’t let this pass, don’t let another day pass without saying something,’ and then I would lose courage, because I’m a fucking coward. I was afraid of – oh God, it doesn’t matter, it all seems so trivial now, doesn’t it? The world ended, and I thought I’d lost the two most important people in my life. I’ve been on autopilot here, and when I saw you, the first thing that popped in my head was, ‘There’s another chance, don’t fucking waste it.’”
John was still so shocked that it took him a moment to notice Holmes’ proffered hand and remember to shake it.
And after a slow start, he’s off and running. The café’s quiet this afternoon, about an hour before I usually close, and so we can chat without interruptions. After a bit he offers to buy me a coffee, “So you can sit down with me without getting in trouble,” and that line is combined with a crooked smile and his eyes, and I’m done.
He went into the kitchen to get the necessary supplies. When he arrived in the bathroom, Sherlock had already started the bath, filling the room with steam, and stripped off his shirt. John had a flashback to when Sherlock had first been released – released, not escaped – and his chest had been painted with stripes of iodine, red streaks from the bandages and heart monitors irritating his nearly translucent skin, and mottled green and yellow bruises around the wound. All signs of healing, but the sight of it had made John furious all over again. He had worked hard to keep it at bay, but he was sure Sherlock had noticed. How could he not? He was Sherlock, he saw everything.
Nothing like the moment when the chaos of backstage, the whirling bedlam of dancers and crew and stage managers vanishing. Nothing like the silence that suddenly fell, when one could hear nothing except for the restless hush of the audience on the other side of the thick, red velvet curtains. Nothing like the moment when everyone in the company slipped into the wings, leaving one all alone on stage. Nothing like the soft dark of a blackout, with a faint glow of blue lights from the prop tables backstage, and the bare inch of light leaking from the gap between the curtain and the stage floor. Nothing like the collective subconscious sigh of the audience when the curtains rose.
“John, quickly, get underground, there’s something happening. Get underground, I’ve got Rosie and we’re going to 221C, get underground, please, John.” He was babbling, somehow he was babbling, and he hung up to stop. He quickly texted,
He turned and gave her his full attention. “An excellent nap, Watson,” he said, keeping his voice clear of his thoughts and worries. “Are you refreshed?”
John’s back really quickly and I look up smiling, but it’s not John that’s sat across from me, it’s some posh looking git with hair to die for and a long coat.
He imagined the audience’s first sight of him: laying on a stark iron bed, his limbs draped in lassitude over the sides of the bed, aligning with the drape of the sheets. One thin arm, nearly as pale as the sheets, lifting a cigarette to his lips.
Greg leaned on the door jamb, his stomach hurting from suppressed laughter. He looked at John, and thought about how the laughter took about ten years off his face: the lines of sadness and pain had lifted into happiness and joy. He had been through so much, and Greg was glad to see him like this.
John didn’t know which of the three options was ahead. He honestly didn’t know which would hurt most.
Upon sight of Maja, John had pulled her into a hug and swept her into their bedroom without a word to Sherlock. At first he could hear her muffled sobbing through the door, but all had been silent for some time. His brain was running, frantic, trying to make sense of the situation and imagine what was going to happen now. He cursed himself for overconfidence.
Holmes interrupted his gaze out the window of the train and fixed John with a glare. “Fascinating? What an unusual perspective, Watson. My client is dead – I couldn’t save him in time.”
