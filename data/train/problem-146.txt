keep me safe
He was losing his music. He couldn’t play his violin like this. He was losing control.
I know I have to eat. And I will eat. But lately it has been getting harder. My mother—as John knows… and I wish he didn’t—has been on my mind.
The front door slammed and steady footsteps traversed the seventeen steps up to the flat. John was home, Sherlock registered vaguely, heart leaping into his throat. If he didn’t act fast, he’d be caught….
“You could have killed me!” John said again. “What. The
“I—” Sherlock took several very heavy, very involuntary breaths. “I—”
“I—I was a bad kid. I deserved it, okay?”
Please,
A moment of peace.
Returning to Baker Street felt bitter like defeat on his tongue. Alone again. A strange sadness surged up and engulfed him. He clamped his mouth shut as he walked up the stairs. Eating seemed impossible. He was sure he’d end up spitting it out, if he even got food past his lips.
I let go of my parents. I let them go, even though I knew he would remain hitting her, isolating her.
John stood there over the man in his white coat like a helpless angel. He was by no means pure; he had seen too much, done too much. But he could not understand. He could not understand the depths of hell that existed in some people, so he could not give them compassion.
How funny.
Their garden has blue hydrangeas. The mulch is dug up in strange patterns. Either Matilda has been playing, or something is amiss indeed. When mulch is dug up so randomly and violently, it does not indicate an affair, it indicates something much more sinister.
“Fuck off, John. It’s just beer.”
“Tired, John.”
Lestrade chuckled. “That’s what I told them probably happened. They didn’t believe me.”
He rolled his sleeve up in the solitude of the theater. The cut on his right forearm was not deep, had not even really bled. Instead, the blade had skidded along his skin. A thin line of red had risen up but not swelled over. It was more like someone had taken a very fine pen and drawn an uneven, dotted battle line. He was surprised at how much and how little it hurt. Just this little tearing of the outer layers of skin. It stung—not too much, but it was a constant aching reminder of how
John walked into Ella’s office slowly. Everything was as it had been the last time he’d been to therapy, before meeting Sherlock. The clean space, the elegant planes of the dark hardwood floor and the floor to ceiling windows. The warmth of the dark walnut desk, the white chairs by the windows, the sweeping curtains. He took a seat across from her, his usual seat.
“Maybe some fruit with it?” John suggested solicitously.
“I was out shopping because I wanted to give my good boy a present,” Daddy begins, but his good boy has already perked up.
“Are you sure you don’t want this?” I ask Wiggins.
“Turn around,” Sherlock said. “God, you can’t even face me. You can’t face the freak.”
“Yes, my sweet boy.” Daddy goes to the desk and gets his toy medical kit, but sneaks in some real bandages. When they first played, Daddy had wanted to play with his real medicine tools, but Sherlock told him the importance of toy medicine tools, so they have this one set made out of plastic, and the box is white with a big red cross on it, and there are three little casts and ten fake plastic bandages in it, and one pair of blunt plastic scissors and a plastic needle. Sherlock counted.
Maybe the only thing that’s better is restriction.
It somehow always came down to this. John coming home, Sherlock coming home. John would always find Sherlock doing something self-destructive. Sherlock could see the insanity of the repetition and thought—impossibly, crazily—of never cutting again just to spite the routine.
The two responses came within instances of each other.
“Fine, okay,” Harry said, putting her hands up. “Stay. Clean my flat, don’t clean my flat. Make your back hurt sleeping on the couch. Do whatever you want. I don’t care. I’ll be drinking whether you’re here or not.”
Instead of potatoes, Sherlock had gotten them each a slice of toast. That was fine with John, if that was what Sherlock could manage. Sherlock started to pick at the salmon, watching it flake apart at the tines of his fork. He pushed it away.
I roll my eyes. “It’s very simple,” I say.
to eat. It was all John’s or Mrs Hudson’s. He could not make himself something either. The ingredients were not his. Besides, he didn’t deserve to eat. He couldn’t even eat a piece of bread.
“John, as a doctor, you know that the caretaker’s needs must be taken care of, too.”
“Yes, my sweet boy! A present.”
Out of professionalism, John left for work. The bills needed to be paid. He left Sherlock.
So John hadn’t been watching on tellie. Hadn’t seen him fall. He hadn’t seen the real him. Sherlock felt lost, all of a sudden. Abandoned. His breath shuddered of its own accord, tears fighting to escape. Lestrade tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hand.
He had thought John would understand the expressive quality of his—well, his actions. He’d subconsciously let John see him with the pills. Had wanted that attention. He wanted to be seen. He had wanted John to know him,
“Daddy, I wuv it!” Sherlock says, pressing kisses all over his new plush bee. “Hello, Bee,” he coos.
” Sherlock grabbed John’s left hand, pressing the blade into it. “
“Don’t be sorry,” John said. “I’m glad someone is looking after you now.”
Sherlock swallowed. Sniffed. Thought about his scars. “’Kay.”
The tears were slow; he was not sobbing. Strong, strong, strong, he thought to himself. Walk around London. His beloved London. Free after eighteen years of resentment. One foot in front of the next. He could face a blade; he could face anything. Push on. Look how brave. Brave boy. He did it all by himself. Look, Mummy, look!
“Sherlock, Sherlock!” Lestrade.
“I already said, I’m not hungry,” Sherlock bit out, steeling himself—against what, he didn’t know, but he knew something was coming.
He pushed forward. He was nothing. Just savage.
“Does that mean ‘no,’ little bug?”
John sighed. He trudged to the couch through Harry’s dirty laundry and lay down. He could still smell the alcohol from here and was reminded of his father. Harry was right. He was waiting for Mrs Hudson or Sherlock to text him—hell, he was even waiting for Lestrade to text him, asking him to help him handle Sherlock.
Everything was all right again. John made things okay. Sherlock nodded. John smiled briefly. John went on cleaning him and Sherlock closed his eyes, exhausted. Without thinking about it, he leaned in and rested his head against John’s shoulder.
“I will have to listen to your tummy,” Daddy says seriously. Sherlock nods seriously, too. This is important. “Hmmm….” Daddy says. “I hear something…. I hear… pancakes!”
Daddy unwraps an arm around Sherlock and reaches behind him. Sherlock hears the crinkle of the bag that Daddy brought back with him. He closes his eyes, not sure about how he feels without both of Daddy’s arms around him.
“You are a drunk, Harry.”
“Maybe, but only because I love you,” John said.
I’m different and this proves it.
“But you just saw…”
“What?” Lestrade said.
“That’s right, bub,” Daddy says proudly. “Daddy loves Sherlock so Daddy wants to make sure baby’s little tummy is always full and happy.”
He didn’t answer either of the texts. Sherlock would be fine. It was cold and dark. He wept.
Did the see his fear? His aloneness? Did people want to pity him? Did they see how thin he was? Did they see the long sleeves he wore in the summer? Did they see the emptiness in his eyes?
to know how I can help
He stood there, groomed well, on the stage in the lavish auditorium that belonged to the ancient core of the City of London. Lestrade to his left. A reassuring presence, though he’d never admit it. The podium to his right. An idiot prattling away, saying things about… “public safety”… “what’s right”… “protecting those in need”….
So he cut because he was guilty. If he didn’t, the guilt would build up until he broke.
“Oh, Sherlock,” he hears John sigh behind him. He hears John set something down on the coffee table. He hears John toe off his shoes. A warm body climbs onto the sofa with him. He feels icky, undeserving. He remembers the scratch on his arm and wraps his arms tightly around himself, trembling.
,” and moves his hips back to fuck himself on Daddy’s fingers as much as he can while Daddy’s holding him still, the hand on his back pressing him down securely onto Daddy’s shoulder. His noises get muffled into Daddy’s body—Daddy means safety and Sherlock can come apart however he needs to, ‘cause Daddy will take him all the ways he comes.
John kneeled on the floor at the side of the bed between Sherlock’s legs and reached out carefully, lifting Sherlock’s sleeve. He was laid bare to John—all fifteen new cuts and a lifetime of scars, no matter how light—but he didn’t feel any different. He didn’t feel vulnerable. He just felt nothing. It felt great.
Sherlock drapes his legs over Daddy’s like he is being cradled and snuggles into Daddy and opens his mouth and gets the pancake! “Daddy feed Sherlock.”
The hands before him were not his own. The hands stuck out before his line of sight like two ugly weeds. The only thing that was his was an ache. This was good.
221B felt small fragile, the blue kitchen light pressing back against the dark engulfing night. The heat radiating from his mug warmed his fingers and he clutched it, huddling into the soft scent of milk and chai.
“Sherlock,” John said again, but this time it was one of acceptance, of action. Sherlock closed his eyes again. Oh god, what now? What would John do? He couldn’t tell. He’d never been confronted in a situation like this, never been comforted. No one had ever seen him like this. He sobbed even harder.
“Hm?”
“Daddy doctor?” Sherlock says hopefully.
“Still only toast, Sherlock, that’s not enough,” John nags.
He waited five minutes. He didn’t get a reply. He sat in the park till dark, feeling the weight of his body press into the ground. He didn't get a reply.
But John was an army doctor, right? He killed people. For Sherlock. John was strong. He protected Sherlock. Just like now because he was shaking so John put his arms around him and held on tight.
“Mm. No. But it’s her seventieth. And Mycroft says she’s expecting me.”
“I am always here for my sweet boy. Do you remember why?” Daddy asks, soft, gentle, quiet.
He felt a hand push through his hair. Sick to his stomach.
I imagine I’m at sea
“Shh, it’s alright, Sherlock,” John said. It took all his courage, but Sherlock glanced at him anyways. Though was nothing but concern in John’s eyes, he had kept his distance, his hands resting neutrally in his lap. John’s respect only made Sherlock sob harder, curling his body away from John.
Harry walked to the fridge and got herself a beer.
Then it all happened very quickly, Sherlock thought: war-roughened hands, surgeon’s hands plucked the bloody blade from him, brushed it onto the floor along with the other blades Sherlock had handy, in case he needed a fresh one. Then those same hands reached for Sherlock himself.
“Go away, John,” he heard himself say.
Sherlock sighs, snuggling into his Bee. “Okay, Daddy. But, no needles.”
As I finish setting out the pistachios, I hear John coming up the stairs. I wipe my hands off and go to greet him.
It was a fucked up situation and he needed to get out. He got to Regent's Park and found that he wanted to cry so he went into the park and kept walking. If he kept walking, he could keep going, like a soldier. It was a fucked up situation and the mature part of him told him no one was to blame.
Lestrade chuckles again, and it reminds me so much of my brother that I impulsively snap, “Did Mycroft put you up to this?”
Daddy wraps me in a fuzzy towel, hugs me while I’m in it
Every time he came here, the cannibal extended the same invitation. When he was younger, he had seen the appeal in this never-ending night, had been good friends with the cannibal. But now he placed a hand on hers and gently removed it. He shook his head at the cannibal and winked. She smiled and inclined her head. She understood his silence. He had been silent when he was younger, aching with pain, muteness stoppering his heart. Now, older, he had not spoken a word in two weeks. He would not now, in this pure, controlled, discreet place. He would not until he needed to be someone, until he needed to exist. He took the keys she held out and left expediently.
It’s a bit of a gamble, but I take out the sweet vanilla yogurt and the honey. I can have that with a banana and some cinnamon. I can also have some pistachios. The honey and the pistachios are quite high in calories.
I head back to the gym. I run 7 more miles, even though I feel like throwing up.
There’s not much to say immediately after sex like this. Just, Sherlock needs to be held. He needs John to be so gentle with him, because indulging Sherlock’s daddy kink makes Sherlock feel so hollow inside, but Sherlock needs this. Needs to call someone Daddy. Needs to let go momentarily even if it reminds him why he shouldn’t, can’t.
Sherlock screwed up his face. Huffed. Pain in his chest. Shook his head. Soreness in his neck. Tried to roll over away from Lestrade. Realized he was too weak. Achey. “Turn it off, please,” he whispered. Pain in his stomach.
John stepped back after that and he found himself in a depressive spiral. There was just so much time. He kept busy. There was still too much time. He found himself thinking he could just disappear. He could stop existing. It would be easy. He had pills. He had blades. He had ropes.
He sobs even harder, silently.
I play with my boats and my ducks. Spish splash, splish splash
he thought to himself.
” he sobs. “I’m sorry, Daddy!”
“No, John…” Sherlock found himself answering. He felt released from something, relieved. His shoulders slumped. “Please…”
“For me?” he says.
Truth be told, John had always been protective of his friend, but now he was going to keep an eye out. Maybe… maybe his odd eating habits were more than just odd. Maybe the unpredictable time alone was when he cut. Maybe when he wouldn’t leave the house to go to the shop or to a low ranked crime scene—maybe he was… out of sorts. He wanted to help. He was Dr John Watson, Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. He made things right.
He was going to disappear tomorrow. Blank slate, move on. Let go. Nothing but achievement, frantic ambition. He went through his mind, mentally cataloguing what he would need to pack.
“Sherlock!” John cried. His hand was bleeding. Sherlock didn’t care. He needed to prove his point.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what that look means,” John said, calmly.
They slept.
Suddenly John was lowering himself onto the bed, too. The bed springs creaked, and Sherlock might have laughed any other day.
said that. Not me. I never said it.”
Sherlock relaxed even further into the words, sagging against John’s shoulder. “Mm. Don’t know.”
“I remember,” Ella said gently. “I’ve been following the blog.”
Yes, I would like ducks.
It was Harry. He stared at the screen, her name, Harry Watson, burning into his eyes. Could he do it? Could he do it one more time? Could he really do anything? He couldn’t for Sherlock.
“Please don’t leave,” Sherlock whispered. They were some of the most honest words he had ever spoken.
“Sherlock, please? My good boy, for me?”
Secreted deep below the consciousness of the average Londoner, in the dank bowels of this royal house, Sherlock Holmes sat at a round table with three others. He struck an intense figure, his dark curls and pale, pale skin—his long black coat and severe cheekbones—long limbs coiled and powerful—his light, iridescent eyes flashing in the dark. He never spoke a word. He looked hungry, hollow, muted, formidable. Elegant and ruthless. Today more than ever, the wild in him was heightened. He could go anywhere. He had no limits. He was lost, himself—could no longer become lost. Everywhere was home. Everything belonged to him.
He must do things. He must not sink lower. He must resist.
“What’s this?” I mumble awkwardly.
“Sure thing, Johnny,” Harry yawned. “anyth-thing for my lil broth…”
Oh, god, is there anything better than losing control and eating 4000+ calories in one sitting? Just vicariously eating whatever you want, whenever you want?
While Daddy cooks, Sherlock shyly tells him stories about Bee, like where he came from and stuff he likes. And Daddy lets him talk for the most part, but Sherlock knows Daddy is listening to every word he says, because sometimes Daddy asks questions like, “What is Bee’s favorite flower?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You- You alright there? You should’ve called for me… You were kinda… Out, like a light. Are you certain you don’t need to load?” John asked and Sherlock shook his head, stroking his hand through his curls gently.
He showered quickly, and when he got out, he could already see in the foggy mirror that the part around his eye and cheek was starting to bruise. His father's slaps were very powerful, too powerful. He sighed and dried himself off quickly, hurrying to his bedroom to get into his pajamas. He slumped down onto the bed in just an old t-shirt and his boxers, sighing once more. He hated this. Why did things have to be this way?
“I uhm… Well, I just got back so… And my old friends mostly live elsewhere… I have a few friends around me..” John thought back on Mike and his interaction and pondered if Molly was still around as well. He sighed a little, not sure what this deep conversation would lead to together with a tin can when it had done very little with Ella. “I… I do feel lonely, sometimes. I think everyone does. Some people enjoy being alone, but that’s different from being lonely. And even people who prefer to be alone sometimes can feel the need for someone to talk to,” John nodded. Sherlock hummed, trying to understand.
“John, I’m not sure this is-”
Chapter 28 -  I love robes
“John- Deep breaths alright? It’s fine, I think- I think Sherlock shut himself off. I saw him reaching for something on himself when I entered the room- I just don’t know what that does really- He’s not the same model- John? John!” Mike quickly put his arms underneath John’s as he collapsed to the floor. John’s breathing had only gotten quicker, his chest tightening with each breath, his knees went weak to the point that they couldn’t carry himself any longer and then it all went black.
Chapter 40 - Just you and me?
“That’s good, do you want to leave? Go back home for a bit before we go to that café perhaps for a light dinner instead?” John said, not wanting to deny the option, but wanting Sherlock to feel fully healthy. Sherlock took a deep breath and shook his head.
“What’s so funny?” Sherlock mumbled in his sleep, or rather, with his eyes closed. John smiled.
“I’m trying to show you something,” Sherlock argued and John let out a nervous laugh.
“Maybe the GPS person got lost in- oufh-!” Just as John was making the joke and opened the door, he bumped into Sherlock, quickly grabbing his hand so he wouldn't fall over. “H-Hey. There you are.” John said and beamed, squeezing Sherlock's hand as he pulled him up so he stood firmly on his feet. “I almost knocked you over! I was worried you wouldn't come.” John said and smiled, feeling much happier now. Sherlock blushed deeply, smiling softly. John was worried he wouldn't come. God that felt great. And John /looked/ great. Amazing even. John had a nice baby blue shirt on, it looked very new too. It wasn't buttoned all the way up, the top of the shirt left open just slightly. Enough to hint but not enough to make it look overly sexy. And the trousers... Sherlock didn't even think John owned tight trousers like that and- “Hello? Earth to Sherlock?” John said and Sherlock quickly shifted his gaze up to John's face. “Sorry. I'm here.” Sherlock said and nodded. “I just thought I forgot something and I wanted to figure it out before my ride had gotten too far away.” Sherlock said and John smiled. “Did you figure it out then?” He asked and Sherlock nodded. “No worries, it was nothing important.” Sherlock said, since there wasn't really anything in the first place, he had only lied to not have to tell him the truth. That he had stood outside like a coward for several minutes. John chuckled. “Well, good. Come on in okay?” He said and helped Sherlock inside, only then noticing the bag. He blushed. “Did you... Did you get me a gift?” John asked, looking at Sherlock. “Gosh you... You shouldn't have...” John murmured and Sherlock blushed deeply. Damnit. Mycroft was right after all. Sherlock shook his head. “It's just a tiny thing really, nothing too special.” Sherlock said and handed the bag to John. John sighed fondly. “You're crazy, do you know that?” He said and left to put the bag safely in Mike's bedroom. “I'll open it later okay? We're still setting things up a bit. Molly is here though, you can sit down with her if you want.” John said and nodded to the sofa. Sherlock looked at Molly and tried not to roll his eyes. So giddy, like always. “I'll do that...” Sherlock murmured,  but really didn't want to leave John's side. John smiled. “Don't worry so much alright? You'll be fine. I'm here and if something happens that you don't like you just come to me okay?” John said and Sherlock smiled, nodding softly before heading over to Molly like he had been told to do, thinking that that was the safest option for now since John clearly was busy.
Mycroft watched the interaction with sceptic eyes, though his expression softened little by little and when Sherlock finally settled, he cleared his throat softly.
I hope this longer chapter will make up for it, and I will do my best to get the next one published as soon as possible.
“I’m here. I’m here Sherlock, it’s alright, it’s going to be okay, come… Come here yeah?” John held out his hand closer. Sherlock’s eyes flickered swiftly as he looked at the hand extended to him.
Chapter 31 - The best superhero in the world
“Here's your tooth---- brush-” Sherlock breathed as he suddenly came out of the en suite, John flinching and crossing his arms in an attempt to cover his chest. Sherlock were frozen in place, holding the toothbrush, staring at John with wide eyes. John blushed heavily. “I- Uh- Yeah- Thanks-” He said and pulled the toothbrush from Sherlock's hand. “I... ehm... Let's brush our teeth then?” John suggested quickly and rushed past Sherlock and back into the bathroom. Sherlock was still standing in the same place, trying to sort out what he had just seen into his mind castle. John, almost completely naked, wearing the most garish... /sexy/ red boxers he'd ever seen. He let out a soft pant, the mere thought of that making his cheeks heat up. Except... He didn't have to think about it, he could just go back into the bathroom and look at John. His John. Suddenly he spun around and practically rushed back into the en suit, John already brushing his teeth, smiling a little as Sherlock hurried inside. “Forgot something?” He asked with a soft smirk, chuckling a little. Sherlock blushed and shook his head. “No... Just... I have very bad breath.” Sherlock said as an excuse, quickly rushing to the sink to start brushing his teeth as well. John didn't believe that one bit, but he didn't say anything about it.
The movie started and the two were cuddled up so very tightly. John had not been sure what Sherlock was thanking him about, but he smiled down at him and stroke his cheek as a response. “There's no need to thank me for anything Sherlock...” John whispered softly, looking at the telly. It looked like quite an exciting film indeed, and he was eager to watch it. But, it didn't take long before Sherlock was huffing and puffing, rolling his eyes at the plot and the film itself. John smiled. “Not to your liking?” John asked and Sherlock sighed deeply. “It's so bad!” He exclaimed. “I thought it wouldn't be, I mean, I've seen come exciting clips of it here and there, but now I understand. They only show the exciting parts in the trailer, and then the rest is just nonsense and not worth watching!” Sherlock complained. “You can already tell what the ending will be.” He muttered and John tilted his head. “Yeah? You can?” He asked and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, I can, but I'm not going to spoil it for you.” Sherlock said and wiggled around impatiently. John sighed fondly and stroke Sherlock's back. “You know, we can always change films if you'd like. I'm not that picky, and I want you to be happy, not frustrated.” John said kindly. A deep blush spread across Sherlock's cheek. John was always so nice... He nodded. “I... Yes please.” He said politely and moved up a bit higher so he was laying with his head next to John's. “I'd like to change the film... Please....” Sherlock said and bit his lip shyly. John smiled and turned it off, starting to browse through the selections. “Alright, let's try another one then-”
I'm sorry this has taken longer than usual! I'm starting to work again but I will continue writing, but sometimes it might take another day or two than my usual posting times! I hope you understand and that you are all enjoying this as much as I do :)! /NightOfFanfics
John got home earlier than yesterday, holding the book Sherlock had given him. Rugby practice had been cancelled due to a sudden rainstorm. The sky had apparently decided to open up and put on the waterworks despite the gorgeous weather they had been having. He had wrapped his jacket around the book, not wanting to get library property wet and soggy. But John was drenched as he stepped inside. “Oh! Quickly to the bathroom, chop chop.” Mrs. Watson tutted as John walked inside of the house. John sighed. “Yeah I know.” He said and rubbed a hand through his wet hair. He took off his drenched sneakers and headed upstairs to the bathroom, stripping out of his wet clothes. He really looked like a wet, soaked dog, his hair all frizzy and messy. Suddenly someone tugged at the handle. “It's occupied! For Christ's sake...” He muttered. Harry sighed. “Are you going to spend all evening in there little brother?” Harry smirked. John groaned. Great. Harry was home. “No, but I'll come and roll over your bed and make everything wet unless you leave me the hell alone.” John grumbled. Harry giggled. “Oh come on little brother, I've missed you. Come out here and give us a kiss.” She teased. John opened the door with a grumpy face, new pair of boxers on but nothing else than that. He stuck his tongue out. “You don't even like kissing boys.” He teased back and Harry flushed a deep red, punching John on the arm. “Not so loud you idiot!” She hissed, John smirking and rubbing his arm. He was the only one that knew Harry didn't fancy blokes at all, and she was not about to tell their parents about it anytime soon. John nodded. “I know I know. I wouldn't do that to you sis.” John said and walked to his bedroom. He unwrapped the book from his jacket, putting it on the bed. Harry glanced at it. “So it's true then, what mum says. That you are failing biology.” Harry murmured. John groaned as he pulled his sweatpants and t-shirt from the drawers. “It's true, but I'm changing it around. I was told this book was a good one and that it would help me understand.” John said, thinking back to his meeting with Sherlock at the library. Harry nodded. “I hope for your sake that it does.” She hummed before leaving the room.
Secretly, Sherlock was enjoying the drama. It helped him stay focused and hungry. It reminded him that he existed, that he mattered. Vain though it was, swishing his Belstaff coat around helped him feel on top of his game, aware that every small task needed precision and perfection in order for a successful result.
John looked up at Sherlock in surprise. “I didn’t know she was still alive.”
“You love it, don’t you, my good boy, all for me,” Daddy growls.
And Mrs Hudson had written,
Sherlock let his hand fall limp. Lestrade didn’t let go. Sherlock felt trapped. The sound of the heart monitor pounded into his mind. Unbearable.
He hadn't been eating.
Daddy smiles and drags his chair and plate to Sherlock’s side. He puts one strong arm around Sherlock and with the other brings a piece of Pooh pancake to Sherlock’s mouth.
It was rational to kill himself.
Despite his sister’s carelessness, he’d been careful to keep his sleeves down at all times until the cut healed over. And now that it had healed, it felt like it had never been there, like all of a sudden, he was living at Harry’s and the time between the army and the present didn’t exist.
“I’m not going anywhere, lad,” Lestrade said. “Can you open your eyes for me?”
He didn’t know what to do or how to help and that was unusual. He thought this was suddenly all too complicated. Shadows were getting longer but the sun was still as sharp. It was giving him a migraine. He shuffled his feet on the gravel, stared blankly at the bare stage.
He had no idea what people thought of him. This wasn’t insecurity, but genuine puzzlement.
“It hurts that he’s gotten distant after you discovered his self-harming tendencies?” Ella asked.
John bit his lip, hesitated by the stairs. “Do you understand, Sherlock? Do you get that what you just did was wrong?”
“I’m not enjoying this conversation, please go away,” Sherlock said stiffly and the android frowned.
“I heard that you agreed to accept the android… How’s that working out?” Ella asked and John put down his cup.
“Mate stop, stop okay?” Mike tried, taking John's arm. “Let go! God- I could've snapped his neck right then and there!” John growled, turning around to look at Mike. “Calm down John. I don't think he really realised what he was saying.” Mike tried. John frowned. “Are you going to take his side in this? You're supposed to be my bloody friend!” John hissed. Mike rolled his eyes. “I'm not taking anyone's side alright? I'm just saying that it looked like Sherlock was just stating facts and not saying it to hurt you!” Mike tried, looking his friend in the eyes. John straightened up a bit, puffing out his chest. “And how exactly did he get those “facts” hmm? Not many people know that about me Mike. You're the only one even, or at least I thought so.” John said, panting from being so upset and flustered. Mike shrugged. “I don't know how he found that out. Maybe his parents knows your parents or something. I'm telling you though, I didn't say a word. In fact, it was the first time I spoke to him today! You saw me introducing myself to him John. I promise, I didn't tell him, I promised you when you first told me about it and I'm promising you right now.” Mike said softly, licking his bottom lip nervously. John took a few steps back, nodding a little. “I just... Last night was bad Mike...” John said and ran a hand through his hair. “Let's just go to class yeah?” John said and turned around, walking off slowly.
John furrowed his brows though when his phone was suddenly buzzing, and he pulled it up quickly and looked at the screen. Molly? “Hang on,” he told Sherlock and answered the phone. John squinted as Molly started to frantically speak on the other side of the phone. “Molly- Molls- Calm- Calm down- It takes more than that for the flat to overflow-” John sighed. “I’ll be right over okay? Just, stay calm and grab a mop yeah?” John muttered before hanging up. He sighed again and pocketed his phone before looking up at Sherlock who was practically glaring at him.
The warm-ups had already started when Sherlock arrived at the field and he quickly hurried up onto the bleachers to find a good spot. He settled on a spot in the middle row a bit too the side, not wanting to be too close to other people. He looked around with a wrinkle of his nose. No, this was definitely not his type of crowd. He sighed, resting his head on his hands as he looked over the field, trying to spot John.
Eventually Sherlock pulled back and began taking off his coat as well. Mycroft cleared his throat, correcting his shirt. “There's some takeout in the fridge, Chinese, if you want some. I'll pop on the kettle.” Mycroft said and headed to the kitchen. John smiled. “Mmm, just what I need.” He said, not at all bothered that it would be something reheated. Sherlock on the other hand wished he had some skill with cooking so he could make John a warm meal. That was a romantic thing to do, right? He pottered into the kitchen, John following behind. “I- I could make you french toast! Or a grilled cheese sandwich!” Sherlock suggested quickly, knowing those were the two things he could manage fairly well. Mycroft raised a curious eyebrow. He knew Sherlock didn't cook unless he really absolutely needed to. John tilted his head and chuckled. “Sherlock, I'm fine. I love Chinese food.” John said and nudged Sherlock to go to the fridge, not wanting to take the liberty to raid it on his own. Sherlock pouted. “But- Alright...” He murmured and moved to the fridge. John frowned for a moment before breaking into a smile. He gently moved behind Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him from behind. “Did you want to cook me something special, hmm?” He said softly into Sherlock's ear. Sherlock blushed heavily and nodded. “Well, if I'm staying until later, maybe we could try cook something together then? I'd love some cinnamon-sugar french toast.” John hummed and smiled at Sherlock a bit wider.. “But let's do the takeout for now, since we're both hungry yeah?” He said and swayed a little with Sherlock from side to side. Really, at that moment, John could've said practically anything and Sherlock would've just nodded. He was so close to John right now, he could feel how warm he was, how safe he felt. It was incredible, and it seemed like both his mind had slowed down, as well as his speech. He nodded once more, smiling. “Yes... I'd like that...” Sherlock murmured eventually, opening the door to the fridge and began gathering the leftovers.
“”Who says that? That's stupid. Idiotic. How would one know if a baboon's promise lasts forever? I think that's highly unlikely. SH”” Sherlock wrote quickly back.
Meanwhile, Sherlock had just walked into the door of his house, his mother and father rushing towards him with big smiles. “Oh Shirley!! Myc told us the good news! Your very first party with new friends! And so quickly after you've started the new school!” Mrs. Holmes gushed and started to hug and pepper Sherlock's face with kisses. Mr. Holmes hugged his son too, sighing contently. “Good job my wonderful son.” He said and ruffled Sherlock's curls. Sherlock was positively blushing now and he rolled his eyes. “Mother, father, this is certainly not necessary...” Sherlock muttered. “Oh but it is. My little brother, all grown up.” Mycroft said suddenly with a teasing grin, appearing in the hallway as well. He frowned though when he realised that Sherlock wasn't wearing the same shirt he left in. “What happened to your shirt?” Mycroft said without thinking first, Mrs. Holmes looking quickly to it. Sherlock blushed deeper. “I... I spilled. Well, I didn't really spill but someone spilled their drink on me. This... This is a friend's shirt. He... He let me borrow it.” Sherlock said and Mycroft new instantly exactly what 'friend' this was. But for now he was a good big brother and didn't mention anything about it. Mrs. Holmes smiled. “Well that was very kind of him. We'll have him over for afternoon tea sometime.” She tutted softly and kissed Sherlock's cheek again. “Come luv, I've prepared some tea and biscuits for you.” She said and tugged him into the kitchen eagerly but gently. “We want to hear all about it.” Mr. Holmes said, following them inside.
Hello everyone, I'm so sorry that this took longer than expected. I've tried to keep posting a chapter once a week in case someone hadn't noticed, but the past week has been filled with anxiety and difficulties for me so I've had a hard time sitting down and actually writing. But I did it now, and I don't feel in the clear or better just yet, but I managed to write a chapter that I hope you'll enjoy as much as I do. Thank you all for being patient! <3 //NightOfFanfics
Sherlock frowned.
“You’re a good man John, please act that way,” she said before leaving with firm steps. John frowned and huffed at that comment before sitting down besides Sherlock.
John entered he house as quietly as he could, opening the door very slowly. He turned around, closing the door equally as gently. “Who was that?” Mr. Watson said, suddenly appearing behind him. John stood up quickly and spun around, swallowing hard. “No one. A friend”. He said quickly, unsure of what to say, but certain that he didn't want to say Sherlock's name outloud to his father. The living room had been so dark he hadn't been able to see that his father had been there, practically spying at him. “A friend your age with a car like that? I doubt it son. Now you tell me the truth or you know what the consequences will be.” Mr. Watson hissed, moving closer. John swallowed hard, shaking his head. “I'm- I'm telling the truth dad- sir-! I am, it's my friend and he has a driver that picks him up and drives him around and-” John was interrupted by a hard slap to his face, nearly toppling him over. “Don't lie to me boy.” Mr. Watson whispered, John stroking his cheek and looking back at him. “Now, tell me the truth.” He said once again. John sniffled. “I'm- I'm telling the truth- I promise- I promise I'm telling you the truth he's my friend from school and his family have a lot of money so they can afford him being driven around and you can ask Mike you can ask him and he will say that it's true-” John rambled in one breath, looking down at his father's feet. Mr. Watson got quiet, lowering his hand that had been slowly raising for another hit. He grabbed John by the shirt, pulling him up close. “You don't take charity from anyone. ANYONE. You are a Watson and you should be proud of it and if I hear about this friend one more time I promise that you will not get away this easily. Do you understand?” Mr. Watson said firmly, and John nodded quickly, finding it hard to breathe from the grip of his shirt. “Say 'yes sir'!” Mr. Watson growled. “Y-Yes sir!” John whimpered and was slowly put back down on the floor by his father. “Now hit the showers and then go to bed. You're already home late.” He continued, standing in place to make sure John did what he said. John nodded and took his bag, quickly hurrying upstairs to the bathroom.
“”I'm on my way out of class, see you by the bathrooms on the ground floor. SH”” Sherlock sent and as soon as John saw it he headed that way. Molly on the other hand began hurrying after Sherlock, who frowned deeply. “Where... Where are you going?” He said curiously and Molly bit her lip shyly. “I just... was following you I...” She stuttered. Sherlock bit his lip. He liked Molly, he really did, though he wasn't sure how this would work. “I... Okay... Just, I don't know what John will say...” Sherlock said and Molly's heart fell a little. “Oh, yeah, right, uhm, I should just.... See you at the next class then.” She said and nodded. Sherlock sighed. Being with John had made him understand emotions and feelings a bit more, and he noticed something wasn't right. “Molly? You can come along if you'd like. I'm sure John wouldn't mind.” Sherlock said finally, walking along with Molly. Molly blushed. “Really? I don't want to intrude-” She stuttered but Sherlock shook his head, his curls bouncing cutely. “It's alright, you're not intruding. You... You are my friend, if you wish to be so, and thus you won't be intruding.” Sherlock decided, blushing a little. Molly grinned widely and giggled again. “Of course I'm your friend you dummy!” She said and nudged Sherlock as they headed towards the bathrooms.
stand out as some sort of perfect specimen. But it was clear that Mycroft had thought otherwise.
“I, oh, uhm, wow, thank you this is… So nice I uhm,” John stopped, unsure of what to say. But as he struggled to get his words out, Sherlock had slowly swooped up behind him, still wearing pyjamas of course, and stared at Mike just as Mike stared at him.
Sherlock had started hurrying just as much when he got John's text. He was worried at first that they wouldn't see each other until lunch, but when he got the text he started to hurry to get everything together. Molly grinned, moving up towards him. “Did John text you?” She said with a soft giggle. Sherlock blushed. “Yes, he's wondering where I am. The recess isn't very long, I have to get to him quickly.” Sherlock mumbled quickly, sending a text back to John.
“I… I guess it would, yeah. I mean, I wish I didn’t have to go and leave you here but I can’t say no to helping her. You have to understand that don’t you?” John said and Sherlock tilted his head a bit.
She had said last night. And maybe, just maybe, she was right about that part.
John didn't waste any time, and grabbed the provided fork for his cake. He thought it was strange, used to using a spoon, but he realised it must be a posh thing using a fork for cake. He took a big bite, stuffing it into his mouth as if it would disappear if he didn't. “Oh my god-” John mumbled, his mouth full of cake. “This is delicious!” He said and swallowed down the piece of cake before taking another big bite. Sherlock sighed fondly, smiling at John. He had been collecting courage to feed John some of the cake in a seductive manner, but the way John was stuffing his face with it, he realised there probably wouldn't be any time, or cake, left for that. Not that he knew how to do it anyway, but he would improvise of course. John smiled, slowing down a bit. “You okay? What are you thinking about?” John asked, seeing Sherlock a bit lost in thought. “Hmm? Oh... Just... Cake?” He asked, taking the opportunity when John had paused to speak, putting a piece of John's cake on his fork and offering it to him quickly. John blushed. “Oh... Okay.” He said and swallowed nervously before taking the bite. This was different than at the restaurant. They were all alone, and it was a lot more intimate. The cake tasted a million times better, if even possible, and John smiled shyly, doing the same for Sherlock. “Your turn.” He almost whispered, holding the fork up to Sherlock's mouth. “Close your eyes.” John said and Sherlock frowned. “Why?” He asked and John smiled softly. “Because it's your first bite, and you'll be able to taste it better if you have your eyes closed, trust me.” John said and Sherlock nodded, though found it odd. “Alright.” He said and closed his eyes gently, waiting with his lips slightly parted.
“I can imagine he has,” John said wryly. “He has a way of doing that.”
Father hated him. Sherlock wants to claw himself apart because he is alone, abandoned, and no one could ever love him.
Lestrade nodded once. He clapped Sherlock on the back. “Alright then. I’ll text you.”
I’ll never tell anyone it hurts.
“So… Mrs Talbot…” Lestrade said, scratching his head, mouth open.
Daddy starts filling the tub. “Ducks?” he says. He pulls out baby wash and bubbles and a small yellow washcloth.
“Okay, it’s okay, Sunshine. It’s okay.”
“I’m sorry.”
“I’m not asking you to talk, Sherlock, not right now,” John said quietly. “Right now, I just want you to eat some breakfast.”
Father would—father would be
He was lying on the couch. John was pulling on his coat. He didn’t want him to go. They had a conversation about it. John was going to work. He was a professional. Sherlock wasn't.
HELL—what the FUCK is wrong with you?” He turned from Sherlock. “You could have killed me.”
He texted Mrs Hudson,
John sighed. “Are you doing all right? I’ve noticed, you know.”
Red scratches on the patient’s chest. Caused by the patient’s own yellowing nails. What drove people to this? What drove people to obliterate their own existence, slowly, seemingly without conviction? It was as though they wanted to commit suicide but chose instead to live in this shrunken state. God, why didn’t they just kill themselves? No… God, he didn’t mean that…. Feeling sick, John covered the patient up again, as though he were trying to respect the dead, and looked in the patient’s file. He was here for a drug overdose. Self-harming tendencies had been noted by a careful female hand. No family. No emergency contact. The name was probably fake, plucked from a fake or stolen ID. Once he was released, he would most likely be out on the streets again. Another overdose, or a petty stabbing, or the winter cold… it was too easy to imagine this man’s death. He was no one, lost already to this world.
Lestrade paused. “Why?”
“So you’re saying I shouldn’t give him space? What if he rejects me?”
John slid into the bed, under the covers, and scooted over to cuddle Sherlock. “Sleep now,” John said. “Close your eyes,” he whispered, covering Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock could feel the warmth leaking from John’s hand to his eyelids. It was the strangest, most comforting sensation….
“With his sister, I expect. He doesn’t know you’re here.”
“No… I made him leave. He doesn’t want to hear from me,” Sherlock was gasping now, adamant. “Just leave him alone. Just let him be.”
“Yeah, like that’s something to be proud of. Your drunk arse all over the news.”
John watched his sweetheart lean against the sink and carefully spoon out and flatten two tablespoons of peanut butter. Sherlock licked the peanut butter slowly, as if taking small bites would make more sense to make up for how calorific the food was.
Lestrade didn’t pull his blankets down like Sherlock thought he would. He reached under the blanket until he found Sherlock’s hand. Lestrade’s hand—the one that had steadied him, had caught him when he passed out on that stage—was warm and rough. It was doing strange things to Sherlock. His insides twisted. His throat felt tight. He felt like he was going to fall apart and he was terrified. This was a new body—he didn’t know how to keep himself from crying—and Lestrade was just… holding onto him, holding his hand tight, as if he were squeezing the last tears left from a land that had endured years of drought. Sherlock clutched back at Lestrade. Tried to breath in and out.
One last time, though. He crept into his room and took out his blades. He pressed one to his arm and, absently, sliced between the older wounds. He let the blood trickle, then placed his blade again on new skin. He was not really thinking. He was just doing. The familiarity of the action comforted him. It wasn’t like the ritual of going for a run everyday or showering at a certain time of the day. This was special. This was his. His alone. To enjoy, fear, keep secret, protect. No one was allowed to destroy this thing that he owned. Was it any surprise that the cutting had briefly ceased during his drug years? Was it any surprise that, as he began to climb up the ranks of life—first getting clean, then getting a flat and a job, then getting another flat and another job, and then getting John, public acclaim, and reputation, something of a steady job—his old habit had escalated? No, it made perfect sense to him. He didn’t need to explain it to John, John who got his kicks out of Sherlock’s oddness, his freakishness.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry, I have to go. Please…” John took a deep breath, shook his head. “Please eat, okay?”
“Oh, probably… I don’t know. Tea and cake. A game of cricket on the lawn. Whatever out of touch old ladies do.”
“How should I know?” I grumble.
The cannibal and two others sat with him at the table. It was rumored that the others were travellers. Sherlock didn’t care much. They were probably not travellers. The word was a euphemism for a much less innocuous trade. He felt an affinity with these people. He sat in the dim light, blending into the dark, and remembered the days he lay in alleyways, a needle full of clarity in his arm. He thought of the days he loitered deep into the night, people hurrying past to their homes, treading paths and possibilities and meetings as they went. He stayed behind. Each night he froze in a different part of London. A different awning, a different alleyway. A different bench. No one gave him a glance. He had been invisible. Would always be invisible in a way.
“John has a tendency to overreact,” Sherlock said smoothly, because in all honesty, he had no idea what John might have told Lestrade.
“Would you like a bath, little one?” John asks.
He could see her weighing her options.
“Two spoons,” Sherlock said. “Then I’m done.”
I feel very sick. And very unhappy.
“Someone’s feeling cuddly, hm?” he says.
The new fixation allowed him to breathe easier, still through his nose. He lay back on the bed and reached out to turn the lamp on. The interaction with Lestrade today had left him feeling inexplicably guilty. It was as though the more he did, the more he stood up for himself, the more the bad feelings built up.
Slowly, carefully, Daddy withdraws his fingers. His boy gasps, shaking, clutches him so tight. “Daddy?” he whimpers. “Need you, please Daddy?”
“Please.”
He was sorry and he thought about those pills more than ever. He knew they didn’t weigh much in his hand.
Sherlock let out a sob. “I don’t know! I just want it all to stop.”
In the beginning, I balked at this treatment. With all my intellect, I surely could not take pleasure from being treated like an infant. But John has a magic about him, something I don’t understand how he does. He makes his words wash over me like I am sinking down into a cloud of comfort. He makes the whole room feel warmer.
” Sherlock hissed, eyes wide. “I DECIDE WHAT’S BEST FOR ME!”
Sherlock sniffed. “Go.”
“I don’t know what to do for you,” she whispered. “I don’t!”
“Oh, never mind, Lestrade. Either Donovan or forensics will bring back the evidence you need. I solved it from the case file. Honestly.”
, Sherlock thought, as even more tears welled up.
“Oh my god, IT IS NOT JUST A CUT! You—you could have KILLED me, Sherlock!”
there—an—an—”
The preoccupation with thinness in times of stress is something that confuses even me. I understand that in some ways I am certainly vain, but I don’t think I’m doing this because of my body image. It partly is, I suppose, but I do it chiefly for the control. The pure feeling of a dry, empty body. Feeling so light I could fly away. It’s a secret I can keep to myself. I use it as a barrier I sit behind and survey others from.
Sherlock grimaced. “I’m sorry,” he said again.
March
“Good job, my sweet boy,” Daddy says. “Bee needs a band aid to be better.”
John laughed, shaking his head.
John squeezed his hand. “Missed you today,” he mumbled.
Maybe he didn’t know himself either. Everything he said about himself, every attitude he projected, was a lie manufactured for the situation he was in. A chameleon.
I get changed back into my regular clothes at a 24 hour gym. My head is pounding.
I’m not sentimental, but some things have a way of getting to me. I feel these things in my stomach. A deep feeling of grief stills my stomach. The shame deadens me. And things become too wild for me. I cannot eat, and I also don’t want to eat.
“I feel like passing out just walking through the Yard,” Sherlock admitted.
That was the wrong word. Almost as soon as John had thought it, one of Sherlock’s eyes opened and, even without the assistance of the other eye, radiated with piercing accusation.
“You’ll be alright?” John asked.
“Well,” he bit out, “it would help
“I can’t, Sherlock, I really can’t.”
Daddy knows this happens. He has a soft towel and a glass of water on the nightstand and wipes his partner down, gives him the glass of water, watches to make sure he drinks it. Then, he gathers a shaking little boy into his safe hold.
“Hm—Daddy!” Sherlock squeals, “A BEE!!!!”
He had gained some respect. He had a place to live. He had money. He had some stability.
His sweet boy was curled up against his chest, still sleeping. John stroked his hair and placed Bee back in his arms. He was glad Sherlock had liked his present so much. He thought about planning a trip to an apiary. He loved Sherlock so much.
He watched Harry and his parents and they didn’t watch him. For the first time, he wondered if that was because they didn’t care about him, because—he was never hurt and he only watched, so maybe they’d just written him off. Maybe he’d never been hurt—because Harry’s coming out must have hurt, must have created ripples of pain that he, John, had been insensitive to—so he wasn’t really part of the family.
For all his disordered thinking, Sherlock thought if John was always there, he’d eventually make it out of this mess. It was what he ached for most—a companion who trusted him, believed him, stayed with him, provided warmth and constancy. He ached. He hurt. He wished John hadn’t stepped back.
John could tell from the doorway that the cuts on Sherlock’s arm weren’t deep, but they were somehow more grotesque than any wound he had seen on the battlefield.
“He’s been… self-harming. I
“Mm,” I say. “I checked up on the experiments, wrote on the blog.”
He was mad, the others thought. The spectators, the other two men—they eyed his silence, his blankness, furtively. No one ever knew what to make of him, even here. They thought he was crazy, and he smiled, baring his teeth. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. But that was exactly why he should do things.
“Sherlock?” John says, and that voice is everything.
Thank you for reading. Thank you for staying with this story. I don't say it enough.
“Shut up,” Sherlock said shortly. “It’s not a big deal. Yesterday was unusual. I don’t like to make a big deal out of my self-harm because I don’t want it to become a
I avoid the gym mirrors on the way out and head home.
“Hmmm.”
I’m back at zero, anyhow. The running ensured that my calories in were canceled out by my exercise. I could eat all the microwave meals John has in the freezer though. All of them. I know it.
Oh… he passed out… huh…
This way was better. He was trying, at least, to be good. Trying to lead his life, trying not to fall in between the cracks.
God, what was wrong with him?
To everyone who commented on the last chapter, thank you so much, so much. I still am in the process of answering to each of your comments, but in the meantime, I just want to say thank you. I know this is sappy and a bit sentimental, but your comments helped me more than I can say. I sobbed when I saw the first one. I was literally sitting at my computer refreshing my stats page, and then I wasn’t alone anymore. Thank you.
“I heard raised voices, I hope you three are playing nicely.” Mr. Holmes said and sat down in another one of the armchairs. The three of them nodded quickly, shifting awkwardly in their seats. “Yes Mr. Holmes, just a heated discussion that's all.” John said and shrugged sheepishly, smiling at Sherlock's father. He smiled back and nodded. “Good. Well, help yourselves, my wife does make the best sandwiches after all.” He said and John leaned forward to take a sandwich. It did look delicious and John was more than happy to tuck in. Sherlock couldn't help but giggle a little, taking a smaller sandwich for himself. He hummed softly and leaned against John shoulder, snuggling up beside him comfortably. “Can I...?” Sherlock said, moving to his side so he could drape his long legs over John's lap. John almost dropped the contents of his mouth out, wanting to say something like 'we can't do this in front of your parents' or 'are you really sure about this', but out came nothing, except for his red face. He nodded. “Y-Yeah- Yeah of course.” John said quickly and Mr. Holmes and Mrs. Holmes looked at each other, smiling fondly. Mycroft though looked quite annoyed, mostly because he was upset that he didn't have someone to cuddle with of his own. But he would never tell anyone that, of course. But Sherlock knew. Sherlock knew just by looking at his brother. And he also knew that Mycroft already fancied someone, and that Mycroft just had to get off his fat arse and do something about it. “Maybe you should ask that Gavin bloke out, Myc.” Sherlock said suddenly with a grin. Mycroft paled. “First of all, it's /Greg/, second of all, I don't have time. I'm too busy with my studies.” He said and waved his hand angrily. His mother looked over at him with a sigh. “You know... I don't think that's such a bad idea luv.” She said and smiled a little. Suddenly, Mycroft stood up and took his sandwich. “If you excuse me, I don't have to sit here and listen to this.” He hissed and stormed off. John was sitting speechless, not sure at all what had happened. Mycroft was interested in men as well? And why was he so angry when everyone around him was so supportive? He didn't understand, but decided to stay out of it for now. “Oh dear...” Mrs. Holmes sighed, her husband rubbing her back reassuringly. “It's alright dearest, he needs to hear these kinds of things to open up a bit.” Mr. Holmes said and Mrs. Holmes nodded. “You're right... You're probably right...” She said and sighed. Sherlock fiddled with the knot on his robe, sighing softly. He hadn't meant to upset Mycroft that way and he felt quite guilty now. John tilted his head, smiling understandingly as he saw the regret on Sherlock's face. “Maybe you could bring him his tea and you know... apologise?” John suggested and Sherlock blushed. “I'll... I'll do that when we're done...” He said and sighed, nuzzling against John's shoulder. “Didn't mean to make him that angry...” Sherlock said quietly. John nodded. “I know you didn't. You were just trying to help, in your own way.” He said and smiled lovingly.
“I can and I have for a long time,” Sherlock answered standing tall. The anger in him swelled. “It’s easy—here.” He took a razor blade. “Here, take it!
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock couldn’t tell what John was thinking. So he pushed on. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he clipped out, drumming his fingers on the table and letting his voice stiffen into an upper class drawl he knew would set John’s teeth on edge. He held his head up. “I have a very strong will. Don’t make me cut you off from our… domestic arrangement.”
He sliced into his arm.
Starving again. Thank god.
She was drunk. “Yeah? What else is new?” John asked.
Matilda lives in a small flat house painted a dull grey. The windows look like hooks piercing through a fish’s gaping mouth. I spend some time simply standing at the bus stop across the street, observing the house. It is around 4pm and I know that John will be returning to Baker Street soon. So, I know that Sylvan Rabbit, Matilda’s father, will also be returning home soon.
“Sherlock, I’m in it for the long haul, in it with you. You keep heads in the fridge, and you think this would make me leave? Hm? Just because you’re in pain?”
John loaded his own plate and came to sit down across Sherlock. He began to eat. “I know,” he said. “You’re usually not hungry. I just want to make sure you’re okay, you know, after last night. Being upset takes a lot out of a person.”
“I tried,” I say civilly. After all, John has kept his peace on a lot already.
He lay in a dark murk for a long while. Or it felt like a long while. Thoughts of pills stashed away, thoughts of John calling Greg and telling him he could no longer take cases for a while, and nothing and nothing and nothing.
There was a pause. Sherlock felt it eating away at the time it took. “Can’t, I’m sorry.”
Sherlock smiles, keeping his eyes closed. He feels floaty. Maybe he
“You could,” John said slowly, measuredly, keeping his eyes on Sherlock. Sherlock glared back, cold and hard as steel. “But you wouldn’t.”
I shower. I pack up again. My stomach is growling. I feel every muscle fiber in my body twitching with hunger.
“Daddy,” Sherlock whimpers into his shoulder.
so i need Daddy to sweep me into his arms
Sherlock rolls over. “No…” he is very tired. He holds Bee to his face and cries a little bit. Bee is very soft but now his fur is getting a little wet. Sherlock rubs his face against Bee. He feels soft and slow and a little bit painful.
He swayed slightly. Lestrade, standing to his left with his left hand clasped over his right, reached out and steadied him in one of those Lestrade-like movements. Economical. Minute. Concise and purposeful. Almost hidden. Lestrade’s wedding ring (more like divorce ring) glinted at him. Offensive, really, the shine. Almost worse than the stage lights. They were for appearances. He hated them on principle.
“It’s all right, John,” Ella said. “Clean slate, okay?”
“Yes, you are,” Sherlock said.
Then Daddy deposits something soft and squishy and furry in his arms! “You can open your eyes now, sweetheart,” John says gently, kissing his boy’s eyelids.
never leave me alone.
It feels like he can’t stop crying. Daddy puts all the toys away quietly and gently without leaving the bed. Careful and safe. Then Daddy scoots over and takes Sherlock into his arms. Daddy noses at the top of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock feels Daddy’s t-shirt get soaked with his tears. It feels kind of gross against his cheek, but Daddy is warm, so he keeps his head there, where Daddy can kiss him.
i hurt john and i don’t know how to stop
“I love you too, Sherlock,” Daddy says. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here this morning, and I tried really hard to be back before my sweet little bug woke up, but do you want to know where Daddy went?”
Sherlock brings Bee up to his face with his other arm. His chest feels so full, like his heart is about to burst. He feels Daddy run something cool and wet against his arm. Suddenly he wants to cry, because no one before Daddy even knew about his arms. No one touched him there. But… then Daddy is rubbing the sewing thread thing around his arm and then there are real bandages, not toy ones, and Sherlock feels good now, a lot better. Then Daddy is wrapping some cloth around his arm. And there were no needles, because Sherlock doesn’t like needles, but Daddy still made him all better.
He stopped outside Angelo’s. He watched the business going on inside. No one could see him, though. He hovered like a dark waif. He thought about going in. He didn’t think he was welcome. He didn’t want Angelo to see him. He didn’t want to smile.
John nodded once, then made his way to the kitchen. Taking care of Sherlock started now, and after yesterday, Sherlock needed sustenance. He started on scrambled eggs, sausages, and toast, hoping the sound of the pan wouldn’t waken his friend. All he wanted was for Sherlock to get some sleep, eat enough… (he wanted to hold him when he got lonely, bath him when he was too sad to so himself, feed him when it was hard for him to eat…)
Sherlock made sure his voice was sharp, cutting. John wanted to talk—he might as well get it over with. Might as well try to push it aside. He clenched his stomach muscles, feeling the strength in his body as he sat up straight, waiting for John to speak. He rested his arm on the table. The soreness was a harsh reminder of last night, but it centered him, made him remember to fight.
