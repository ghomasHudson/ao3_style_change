“Yes, because it’s terrible!”
"So the empty. It's just gonna take you as soon as you feel happy?"
Sam does a quick sweep of the place, lingers a little bit too long on the family pictures framed on the dresser, and then decides to take a quick shower.
Misha is looking at Sam wide-eyed, the mix of shock and realization clearly written all over his face.
“It didn’t feel real at first,” Cas begins quietly, keeping his eyes trained on the photograph. “When I first got here I thought it was the Empty messing with my head. I never thought I’d wake up one day with a wedding band on my finger and kids running around the house.”
Somehow, one more chapter sneaked into this fic so this isn’t the ending quite yet. I’m aiming to have the last chapter up by tomorrow so it’ll be a short wait at least :)
From where he’s sitting, Sam can see all the markings taped on the floor and Dean standing awkwardly in the midst of it. Castiel is still standing in the back corner, hidden from the cameras’ view.
“Cas is dead, so who the fuck are you?”
“Hiya Jared,” Alex greets with a wave and a big, happy smile. “Is Misha here yet?”
Dean shrugs his shoulder and gives him a sweet smile. “Someone’s gotta do your job.” He pockets his phone and stands up. “Let’s go, Sammy.”
“Nothing to talk about,” Dean dismisses with his back still turned to Sam.
A second later Dean finds himself pinned against the wall with Cas protectively standing in front of him.
“I’m not going to let Billie hurt you, Dean.” Castiel’s voice begins to falter and there are traces of doubt highlighting over those words. Dean watches tears form in the corner of Castiel’s blue eyes and he follows the train of one slowly rolling down the side of Cas’ cheek. He resists the urge to wipe it away.
“At least we know now that Chuck is definitely behind all of this,” Cas says and watches Dean take a big swig straight from the bottle.
“Just fucking stop! Whatever you’re about to say isn’t going to change anything. We’re about to dance with mistress D here, so let’s fucking prioritize already.”
“Sure, I’ll take a burger.” Dean shrugs his shoulders at Sam who widens his eyes at Dean impatiently.
“What do you mean?” Sam looks up from the
“I can wait for you.”
Cas opens his mouth, about to say something, then closes it again. Solemnly, he takes another step towards Dean until Dean can feel Cas’ breathe settling warm against his skin.
Both brothers, on instinct, reach for the gun their alter egos don’t carry.
Dean shrugs and swallows down more food. “I don’t know, man. I mean, we don’t even know what’s going to happen when we get back to our world. Cas might be thrown back into the Empty for all we know.”
A smirk appears on Sam’s face and he takes a big bite of his toast. “I think I might have an idea.”
Seven takes later, Dean flawlessly runs from one arrow to the next and the final cut is called.
Jack nods solemnly. “Just a few more days of shooting and then this will all be taken down. I still haven’t cleared out my trailer. Everything’s just happening so fast.”
Dean swallows audibly. "I'm glad you told me, Cas." He forces himself to smile.
Before the sense of foreboding can creep into Sam’s consciousness, everything goes black again.
Dean shrugs his shoulder. “Could be. Would explain why it still exists.”
As big as Dean’s grin is on his face, however, it’s not contagious and Jack looks solemnly back at them.
Dean smiles and keeps driving and he doesn't think about the weight on his chest. He doesn't think about the eleven years he's wasted. He doesn't think about the Empty and Cas.
Later that morning, they get a call from
. Well, Sam’s not that lucky. Jared’s phone is asking him to enter a full password. No pin, no pattern, no knock code. A full fucking password. It’s going to take hours to crack.
"Remember what?"
“I need to borrow your phone.”
Dean can hear Castiel sigh. "I thought it would. The emptiness never took me, so I don't know. I thought loving you was the happiest I could ever be."
Sam rolls his eyes at them and picks up the 15x19 script that’s laying on the table. He flips through it out of habit but nothing seems to have changed since last night.
Determinedly, Dean covers the distance between them again and takes a hold of Cas’s hand.
.” Dean feels physical pain as he forces the words through his teeth. “Playing us on that stupid TV show.”
Sam brushes past Dean, back into the kitchen and grabs the paper stack off the table, holding it up for Dean to see.
“Not everyone,” Jack says with a soft shake in his head. “Just the people Chuck vanished over the last few days.”
Castiel takes a threatening step forward and looks down at Andrew who’s still sitting in his chair. “Why would Jack ever want to kill Dean and Sam?”
Dean’s eyes widen and he immediately takes a few steps back.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t get here sooner. Crossing the border took a bit longer than expected.” Misha takes a seat next to Sam and longingly eyes the stir-fry on Sam’s plate.
Sam clears his throat, double-checks that what he’s seeing on the screen is real and valid. “I don’t think we’re in the same universe as last time. Misha – the guy who plays Cas, he’s still alive in this world.”
“We’re still you’re family, Cas.”
Cas shakes his head and takes hold of both Dean’s hands in his. Dean grudgingly allows his fingers to be intertwined with Cas’s.
A little voice in Sam’s head tries to tell him that she’s right. With both Eileen and Cas here, they could start fresh. For a moment, Sam doesn’t think about Jack or Bobby or Jody or Donna or anyone else for that matter who’s still trapped and vanished by Chuck in their world. For a moment, Sam believes that Dean, Cas, and Eileen are all Sam needs to be okay.
Sam does a double-take. His throat feels dry and he gulps and licks his lips before he even attempts to speak. “End?”
Sam wakes up the next morning with the feeling you get after a vivid dream and it takes a few minutes to sort out which memories are real and which ones are just part of the dream.
“Sure, for what episode?”
you. I made up every universe you’ve ever been it. You're nothing but characters in a story that I created. And still, you couldn’t play your goddamn parts.”
Before Sam even dares to read through the rest of the script, he goes back to Jared’s trailer to take a quick shower and
Before Dean can say anything else, the door bursts open a second time. This time, Andrew walks in.
, staring at him. Lights are blinding Sam’s vision and there are at least three big ass cameras focused on his face.
“Dean, what are you- How did you get here?”
Rob takes a sip of his beer and furrows his eyebrows in thought. “Just a few days ago. I think we were shooting that scene at the beach.”
The next punch lands in Cas’ ribs.
Dean stops walking when they stand on top of the two markings. “Cas, wait, there’s something I gotta say to you. Something I didn’t get the chance to say before the Shadow, I mean, the uhh, the
“You okay?”
Dean stares at Cas in complete bewilderment. “I, uh, I-”
The crew does a quick off-camera run-through with Dean, and Sam busies himself reading over the script again.
“What do you mean we can’t get him here?” Dean barks at Andrew.
After a few bites, Dean breaks the silence. “We gotta find a way to get back to our own world, man. The people we’re supposed to be here? We don’t know what happened to the real Jensen and Jared. What if we’re possessing them, or what if we switched places with them? They could be getting tortured by Chuck as we speak.”
"What the-" Dean turns to look at Cas.
What's that? A hat. Crazy, funky, junky hat? No, it's a chapter full of fluff! I'm procrastinating writing the ending of this so there's a final chapter coming at some point to you in the near future. For now, I've decided that Dean put "Thank You" on his Led Zeppelin mixtape. There's a reference to it in this chapter so I would give the lyrics a quick read-through. I also never wrote an actual script in my life and the reason there are so many script scenes in this fic is because I wanted to have Dean/Cas moments without changing perspectives or having Sam present. I didn't really think that through when I started this story but it is what it is now, I guess.
Andrew glances up from his desks and gives them an annoyed
“He’s part of the show!”
Cas frowns but then something changes in his expression and before Dean realizes what’s happening, Dean’s back in Cas’s arms with Cas’s lips pressed warmly against Dean’s.
“So what’s with all the masks?”
the phone replies to him.
Sam is leaning against the dining table and, being the closest to, he goes to open the trailer door.
Sam puts the groceries away, grabs a beer for himself, and then joins Dean on the couch.
. Whatever's in the script can't be good.
“What if the script is real, Dean? What if this is actually going to happen in our universe?”
. C’mon in.”
“Bring us back, Chuck.”
Dean’s jumping out of his chair and swinging the door open before Sam can even put down his fork.
“I guess so.”
Dean mumbles something and walks over to the kitchen. He opens the upper cabinet that’s next to the fridge and grabs one of the three bottles of whiskey they got at the liquor store.
. Any chance you can bring the scripts over to my trailer?”
“I’m here to save you, you stupid son-of-a-bitch.”
When Dean only response is furiously blinking at him, Cas sighs and tries to start over: “Dean, you’re human-”
Billie staggers over to them, holding one hand to her infected shoulder. She’s swaying with every step and her voice is reduced to a quiet threat, the thunderous, clear-cutting edge to her voice is gone.
“So what did Andrew want to talk to Misha about?” Sam asks, remembering the way Alex had lost his shit around them earlier.
“Away where?”
Sam doubts it, but he shrugs his shoulders in response. “I don’t know.”
Dean finds himself stumbling and speaking with his heart pumping in his throat: “I love you, Cas. Never really let myself think of us this way because, well, who would’ve thought, right? But I’m sick of watching you die and going through life finding things I miss about you that shouldn’t even remind me of you. But then they do. And all the things we haven’t tried yet haunt me when you’re not around. And I- I wanna try, Cas.”
The relief Sam feels at not having to act vanishes completely when the lights turn back on and Eileen is nowhere in sight.
“Dean! What are you doing here?”
“Dean?”
Sam reads through every article. He reads the script of the final two episodes until he’s remembered every line. When Dean wakes up from his passed-out nap and joins Sam at the table, it’s six in the morning and Sam’s a fucking mess.
They don’t bother to knock first before storming into Andrew’s office.
Sam’s cheeks flush involuntarily and he turns the picture over, playing with one of the metal clasps of the frame. “I, uh, I read the script. Everything we’ve ever done is pretty much word-for-word in there.”
“You’re Chuck, aren’t you? You goddamn son of a bitch!”
They leave Sam alone in the office with Alex.
He gives Sam a timid smile and crosses the short distance to the table. “Hello, Jared.”
Dean grudgingly loosens his grip enough for Chuck’s reddened face to stop from turning purple. A few more coughs fill the silence as Chuck tries to clear his lungs and normalize his breathing.
Sam waits until they hear the bathroom door lock and the sink getting turned on before heleans over the table. “What the hell, Dean?”
“You caught me!” Chuck says mockingly. “Took you long enough.”
“Then call him up and face-time him.”
Dean shuts the door behind her and takes a long sip. “Wait, so you’re you? How do you know we’re us?”
“You really need to change characters. The appearance alone is a dead giveaway,” Dean taunts with a smile devoid of all humor.
Sam holds up the script and shows it to Dean. “This is about Chuck making everyone disappear. Cas’ uhm, Cas’ death is described in here.”
“Okay.”
After Dean’s liquor run and Sam’s insisted grocery run (“You don’t know long we’ll be here for, Dean. We can’t just live off beer and take-out”), they arrive back at Dean’s trailer feeling exhausted and overwhelmed.
Sam waits for Dean to give him a slight nod before Sam drops the script into the fire.
Cas shrugs, not showing the slightest guilt. “I like hearing you say that you love me.”
"I understand."
phone begins to ring and Dean fishes the phone out of his pocket and puts the call on speaker.
“Yeah okay, Hollywood,” Sam scoffs with a tang of jealousy. If Sam’s scene this afternoon is going to take more than seven takes, Dean’s never going to let him hear the end of it.
“Well what if it is real, Dean?”
“I’ll bake you a pie if you can do it in seven takes,” Sam teases with Schadenfreude. That’s not to say he doesn’t feel bad for Dean, because Sam would probably die of embarrassment if he was in Dean’s shoes right now. However, sympathy pushed aside, if Dean messes up often enough, Sam reckons there’s a good chance they won’t have time to film Sam’s scene this afternoon.
Dean exhales deeply and a woman rushes over to apply more make-up on Dean’s ever reddening cheeks.
Dean drives the rest of the way contemplating, debating, hating himself, but always coming to the same conclusion.
Disinterest in Dean, Chuck turns to look at Sam and his expression turns mournful. “What about you, Sam? All you have to do is film those two episodes and you could have a normal life here, just like you’ve always wanted. Picket fence house, taking the kids to school, Thanksgiving with the fam…”
Heart pumping in his throat, Sam opens up the contacts and scrolls down the list.
There’s a slight breeze in the wind and it helps Sam straighten out his thoughts. It mostly helps him focus on the fact that Eileen is here,
“So what? That’s a deal-breaker now?”
“CUT! Misha, you’re not supposed to be scared!”
“Or what?” Chuck jeers. A moment later and Dean is thrown to the ground with Chuck looming over him. “How often do I need to tell you that I’m God, Dean?”
“I thought it contains your entire future?” Eileen asks and looks at them in bewilderment.
Jack looks at him oddly. “Pretty sure it is. Are you okay, Jared?”
“Hungry?” Sam gives him a teasing grin and slaps Misha companionable on the shoulder. Sam then remembers that the person next to him is technically a complete stranger to him and Sam awkwardly withdraws his hand. Then again, Gen did tell Sam on the phone that he and Misha are friends, so it might actually be perfectly normal if Sam treated Misha like he normally treats Cas. However, Jared probably doesn’t treat friendships the way Sam does so Sam might still be acting weird around Misha by treating him like a friend.
It’s a moment where everything happens in slow motion. Castiel lifts his arms, the blade of the scythe glisters, Billie’s eyes widen in shock with the realization that this is it. Dean lets go of her arm and takes a step back, just as the blade cuts through Billie’s neck, and her captivated head falls off her body. The sound when it hits the ground is too low, too quickly over to accurately represent the significance of it.
“Dean! That’s not Chuck, we got the wrong guy!” Sam shouts just as Andrew storms over and pulls Dean away from Rob.
Dean can feel Cas' eyes on him. The questioning look that's sure to be taking over his entire face.
Andrew's eyes widen and he mouths something to Dean that Dean chooses to ignore.
“Are you sure you didn’t miss anything?” Sam asks in his best attempt to keep this conversation professional.
“Do you have any idea what this means? Every script matches our life to the exact detail. What if this is like the AU version of Chuck’s books? What if it’s another prophecy?”
Dean’s eyes widen and he balls his hands into fists. “But I… I shot that scene! It was amazing. I put my heart and soul into that scene!”
"He can't!” Sam exclaims, “He uhm, he hasn’t memorized his lines yet."
“On….set?”
“I don’t know. Maybe we’ll find something useful in there? I mean, if the scripts run somewhat parallel to our lives, then maybe we missed something?”
“Well that makes sense considering what’s in there has already happened. Can’t really change the past,” Dean explains to Sam like he’s a little bit on the slow side.
Fuck, Sam’s missed this. He and Eileen being together like this, just a normal couple out for a stroll, holding hands. They could have this moment every day in this world.
It’s dark for just a split second. A blink with tightly shut eyes and then it’s over. Sam finds himself back at the beach. Pain shoots through his body and he’s crouched down in the sand with Dean right beside him. He recognizes the silhouette of Jack standing somewhere in the distance before his eyes drift over to Chuck still standing in front of them, left arm raised and ready to snap his fingers.
Sam rolls his eyes, his excitement causing him to be impatient. “Whatever you told him must’ve changed something. I mean, in the first script Cas wasn’t mentioned at all but now that he’s here-”
“Hallelujah.”
Sam definitely agrees, but there’s something else he wants to discuss with Dean first.
Eileen, Jack, and everyone else are waiting for them in their own universe.
Cas decides to switch his gaze over to Sam, shooting him a puppy-eyed, pleading look to get him out of this.
“Hey guys,” Chuck walks right past Dean and inside the trailer, giving Sam a nod. “Thought you’d be here too.”
Thank you so much for reading, commenting, and leaving kudos:)
Dean simply adds 'Kill the Empty' to his list of things to do and only for a second, does Dean allow himself to think about what he'll say to Cas when they beat the empty.
“What the fuck?” Sam exclaims in disbelief. There’s an urge to grab the script out of Cas’ hands and flip through the next pages but that’d be useless. Sam balls his hands into fists instead. They know the rest of this story anyway.
“And you’re absolutely sure that’s him?” Dean asks for the fifth time and Sam tries to reassure himself with every nod he gives Dean in return.
Although Dean is still in shock, some parts in his body must be registering Misha’s words because Dean’s arm pulls the door further open and his feet take a few steps back to allow Misha enough room to brush by Dean and step inside the trailer.
Chuck -or Rob- is standing outside and grins up at him.
“Dean!”
I know it's not the weekend yet, but I neglected a few responsibilities and, with everything going on, writing this is actually very therapeutic. The word sizzling is thrown in there for extra measures. There's also a somewhat heartfelt scene I wrote while listening to jolly Christmas music so if you're not sure how to feel while reading it, that's why.
Sam skims over the first half of the script, which is just a highlight reel of their past couple of days in this universe. Dean’s private conversation with Cas outside of Andrew’s office didn’t make it into the script, but Sam is
“So what do you say?” Eileen takes a step closer and takes hold of his hand, lacing their fingers together. Sam closes his eyes and gives in to the sensation. Eileen’s touch is light, her skin a bit cold from the breeze, and Sam tightens his grip to warm them.
“You think he’ll pick up?”
“Fucking weird man,” is all Dean has to say and they shortly have lunch after that and then Dean is researching on Jensen’s laptop and Cas is examining the script for anything useful. Sam’s not doing anything, which is weird, because it’s Sam. A sudden drowsiness has taken over his body and he sprawls himself out on the couch and rests his eyes.
Sam nods obediently and walks back to
“Let’s just sit down and figure this out, okay?” Sam-the-mediator says.
“Hey Jared, mind if I come in?”
“Dean! Wake up!”
Without waiting for Sam’s answer, Alex walks straight past Sam and inside. His eyes immediately fall on Cas and Dean, not failing to take in the close proximity in which the two are standing to another in the kitchen.
Castiel blushes and smiles timidly at Dean in return.
“Do you uhm mind putting the pen down?” Sam gives him his nicest bitchface.
Eileen’s face is overcome with confusion and she turns to Sam for help. Sam gives her an unsure smile in return. He didn’t expect
Sam doesn’t want to believe that this is happening. He holds up his hand and shows the ring on his finger. “Well, for once, we’re both married. And secondly, this isn’t our world. We can’t just stay here. We don’t belong here.”
Not a word has passed between them. The hum of the Impala keeps Dean’s sanity going as he speeds through the empty highway. Cas silently stares out the passenger window, watching the row of streetlamps merging into one as Dean races past them.
Dressed in their usual plaid and leaving a trail of cosmetic products behind them with every step, Sam makes sure that Cas is the first person to enter through the door that leads to today’s set.
Andrew is looking at Dean, his entire face scrunched up with confusion, trying to understand just what the fuck is going on with his two superstars.
“Misha? It’s uh, it’s… Jensen, hi.”
Dean gives him a funny look like Sam’s finally lost it. “Kill who?”
“So?” Eileen takes another step forward. “He’s not
Dean stares at the phone, thumb hovering over Misha’s name. Dean looks over to Sam, his eyes wide and scared.
Dean opens his eyes and looks at Sam for help. They really didn’t put much thought into this plan before executing it.
“Jared just got here… yeah we’re having supper together… okay I will … bye sweetie I love you too.”
Sam risks opening his eyes again and looks at Chuck. Chuck is dressed in all black and Jack, in the distance, is covered in white.
As warm and physically relaxing as the hot water on his skin feels, however, Sam’s thoughts are anything but. After just two minutes, Sam dries himself off with a towel and slips into a pair of sweatpants before settling on the couch.
Dean tries to swallow down the sudden dryness in his throat. “Yeah okay,” he manages to say intelligently and watches as Cas’s gentle smile disappears along with the rest of him, and Dean is left standing alone, tightly clutching the air in his left hand.
“I’m not sure. The Empty exists in a different realm where the concept of time doesn’t apply.”
Sam nods in response and tries to look disappointed. Truth be told, Sam’s fucking glad they’ve put a hold on filming. When Sam was younger, he’d tried to get involved in theatre, but with John dragging them from one state to the next every few months, Sam had never landed more than a minor role that could easily be added or erased, depending on when Sam arrived or had to leave again. If acting in a production play was anything like the torture he and Dean were put through the last time they had to pretend to be themselves, then Sam is almost thankful to John for never making Sam go through that hell voluntarily.
Sam watches helplessly as the phone goes quiet and Gen’s name on the screen gets replaced by a Missed Call (1) notification.
Before Sam can even
“We spent all night tearing the entire trailer upside-down looking for the final script,” Dean adds and the wink he gives Sam makes Sam question the validity of his brother’s statement. Sam’s eyes involuntarily dart to the open bedroom door and he deliberately doesn’t think about the other reason why it’s a complete mess in there.
“This is bullshit!”
“You think that hate and anger that’s what drives you, that’s what you are. It’s not. And everyone who knows you sees it.”
“SAM!”
Cas awkwardly grabs Dean by the arm and pulls him over to the next set of X’s on the floor.
The lights flicker for a moment before neon brightness fills the beach from left to right.
Dean fumbles. Long seconds pass where Dean takes deep breaths and calms himself down, figures out what the fuck to do now.
“Well, think about it! What if the script doesn’t determine what happens in our universe. What if it’s the other way around? That whatever happens in our universe gets put into the script?”
None of this feels real. Part of Dean is half-convinced it’s just Chuck fucking with his head again. His heart is filled with fear and worry and Dean is content with that. He’s not about to make room for his patiently waiting hope to enter and take over.
When Sam unlocks the trailer, Castiel takes a seat on the couch and doesn’t look up when Sam plops down beside him.
Dean rests his head against the window and watches the raindrops slowly gliding down the glass. Although it’s around lunchtime, there’s no rush hour traffic and barely any people are seen outside on the sidewalks.
“Right,” Sam scoffs. “So Cas gives you a love confession that ends with him sacrificing himself for you and there’s absolutely
“I just got off the phone with Gen.”
. The sound echoes in Sam’s head, but instead of having his insides explode or torn to shreds, the pain in his knees doesn’t worsen and the air in his lungs doesn’t leave.
All their groceries are still in Jensen’s trailer so it makes sense to have breakfast there. Sam quickly heads back to the bedroom and pulls out some fresh clothes from the closet.
Dean blushes and mumbles something that Sam would pay good money to have deciphered. The small smile Dean shoots at Cas tells Sam only half the story.
is too much for Sam. He gets up from his chair and starts going through the trailer.
Sam is quick to lift his head again and bring a smile to his lips. “I’m fine.” He motions at the pan of stir-fry sitting on the counter, “Help yourself, Dean cooked plenty-”
Sam swallows and brushes away the memory before it can fully surface back into his consciousness. The phone in his hand is still ringing and Sam tries to focus on the little lock symbol instead. One problem at a time.
“Such a relief,” Dean comments sarcastically and puts the bottle back on his lips for round two. “Let me guess, the script ends with us reading it.”
A sardonic grin spreads over Dean’s features. “What are the chances of Chuck pretending to be that Misha guy?”
“Well, sorry to disappoint,” Dean bites back and his grip around Chuck tightens yet again.
Chuck makes another face, clearly frustrated with their lack of understanding. “You guys wanted to write your own story, so have at it! See how much you enjoy being trifle, mundane human beings that billions already exist of. Because you know what? Your story, regardless of
“We need you to come on set.” The words leave Dean’s tongue sounding final and pertinent.
Kids are screaming at the other end of the line. The repeated ‘dad’ impossible to miss.
A sudden breeze of wind dances around them, accompanied by the rustling of paper. Sam’s eyes are drawn down to the script in Alex’s hand.
"I'm sorry, Dean. I thought telling you would save you, but, evidently, I was wrong. I understand if this changes things between us and you want me to leave."
“Castiel.”
“What do you think the next script will be?” Dean asks Sam when they’re back in Jensen’s trailer.
“Only one way to find out.”
Even without the arrows leading him, it’s easy for Dean to find his way around the Empty. He stops, short-breathed, when he finally catches sight of a familiar trench coat.
“Cold pizza?” Dean stands by the open fridge, holding a white cardboard box in his hand. He’s grinning at Sam, mouth already filled with a slice.
“I wonder who’s playing Cas now,” Dean muses flipping through some pages and happily sipping whiskey from the bottle.
“Sam?”
Sam’s ready to throw everything in the Dream category but then he opens his eyes and finds himself in a small bedroom and every memory gets dramatically pushed into the Real category.
Everything happens too quickly. The door bursts open, Billie crosses over to them within seconds, Dean tries to push Cas' hand on him away -ready to fight with whatever he’s got still left in him-, while Cas successfully shoves Dean against the wall.
Dean nods unhappy but doesn’t argue with him any further.
“And I’m glad I did because the real Cas would never stop seeing us as family!” Sam snaps offended. The picture of Jared’s family is mocking him and Sam picks it up to give it a dirty look. Who needs a fake family when Sam’s apparently got one right here.
Sam’s too confused to gasp but he feels his heart skip a beat in terror.
took you and
“So what, we’re stuck in an infinite loop? How’s that even possible?” Sam asks while Cas flips to the end of the script.
“Two weeks,” Sam supplies dryly. Two weeks of waking up to finding Dean passed out on the kitchen tiles.
"That was the deal we made."
“I…I don’t know.”
“This all you got?”
universe. We’re screwed, Sam. Whatever it says in these goddamn scripts doesn’t matter. We’ve lost either way.”
Castiel shakes his head and fixes his gaze on the coffee table. “Nothing I haven’t told you already. I got taken by the Empty and then I was brought here.”
“What’s that?” Sam’s heart begins to beat faster with hope.
“I mean,” Jack continues, “I’ve only been on this show for a few seasons. I can’t imagine what it must be like for you. Fifteen years. Crazy to see it end like this.”
The tension between Dean and Cas over supper is not only palpable, but also extremely awkward to be in for Sam. By now you’d think he’d be used to the constant glaring and hopeful side glances but it never gets any easier to ignore.
“That was weird,” Dean notes as soon as the trailer door shuts behind the other two.
up all night. “I found out who’s meatsuit Chuck is in.”
Dean goes back to flipping the bacon but stops again when Cas comes back to fill himself a cup of coffee.
“Yeah,” Sam agrees quietly. “Jack’s got most of the other universes back running. Made sure there was a vaccine for the one we were trapped in.”
There’s a knock on the trailer door that startles them both.
“What new script?”
Next to him, Cas is getting his hair tousled up and Dean, at the end of the trailer, is getting his stubbles shaved off.
“What’s that?” Eileen tries to take the script from Sam but Sam easily pivots and holds the paper out of her reach.
“That’s good.” Dean hates the small talk they’re having but he doesn’t know what else to say. Thankfully, he sees Jack and Cas walking over and approach them.
Castiel is the first to break the silence: “When did the two of you get here?”
“You hear that, Andrew?” Sam says loudly and twists around in his chair to look at Andrew. “The script doesn’t make sense. If Billie’s in the Empty and Lucifer killed the last reaper then it’s impossible for anyone to die!”
There’s a pause. “Well, that explains why he texted me.”
“Hello, Jensen.”
A shiver runs over Sam’s back when he realizes what event this script revolves around. The further Sam gets into reading it, the sweatier his hands become. The fact that his emotions are written down right next to his actions, right next to the line signalling Eileen dying, vanishing in front of his very own eyes is… too much.
“Dean?”
“But they’ve gone into oblivion,” Dean adds grimly. “All that runnin’ around those stupid arrows for nothing.”
“How’s our new God?” Dean asks happily and claps a hand on Jack’s shoulder, while Dean’s other hand stays firmly glued to Cas’s. “Brought everyone back, huh?”
Sam groans and sinks down in one of the smaller chairs in Andrew’s office. After a moment, Dean follows and they both ponder defeatedly in their chairs, trying to come up with a way to get them out of this.
“No,” Castiel shakes his head but narrows his eyes and stares at Alex with a strange expression on his face.
don't have a destiny, Dean. You have a plot and it's not in your hands to change it. You do as it says and follow my story.”
Andrew looks personally offended. “I think it’s a great plot twist and so does the network.”
It feels strange to read about the little private moments you lived through and have them be written and described by someone else from a third perspective. Sam’s thoughts keep drifting back to those memories and remind him of the ones that happened between the lines. Eileen and him going out for supper, holding hands, taking an evening stroll around the port. A normal couple on a normal date. Of course, that didn’t make it in the script. Somehow, Sam catches himself wishing it had.
Sam fights the urge to pull his older brother back on his feet. Sure, this is Dean’s way of dealing, Sam’s witnessed it enough times, but it still doesn’t make it any easier for him to sit back quietly and watch his brother drink himself into a stupor. Then again, Sam can’t imagine what he would’ve done if Eileen had sacrificed himself for him the way Cas did for Dean. Sam’s guilt level is on an all-new-high as it is.
Huh, guess he’s still married to fake-Ruby in this world.
The sight of Dean mercilessly ripping the air out of Jack’s lungs isn’t even that strange compared with the rest of the situation and Sam immediately feels ashamed of that thought. Dean’s only doing this because it’s Chuck. It doesn’t matter whose body he’s in.
“Thank you, have a good night,” Dean yells merrily and drops the pile of scripts on the table.
“Hello?”
That question seems to fill Andrew up with excitement and he jumps out of his chair and starts pacing around the room like a ball full of energy. “He doesn’t! You see, it’s an accident, like when we killed off Mary. Jack is so guilt-ridden he then hides in another universe and Chuck goes back to being a BAMF god. Genius, right? And it allows us to make Destiel happen without having to pull Castiel from the Empty. It’s a win-win for everyone.”
Dean nods nervously at the woman and gulps at the sight of two dozen arrows taped on the floor, pointing in all various directions. Sam wonders if this is the norm in this world, following arrows. He’s seen them everywhere, the supermarket, the liquor store, the studio. Sam’s not sure what the point of them is and makes a mental note to ask Clif about them later.
“I’ll clean up. You can take the bed,” Dean nods at the open bedroom door. The sheets on the bed are rumpled and tossed carelessly over the mattress (Dean’s doing when they tore the trailed apart looking for the scripts). Otherwise, the bed is the exact replica of the one in Jared’s trailer.
Sam’s voice came through the phone as a handful of broken pieces.
Castiel opens his mouth, but before he can give Dean a response, there’s a knock on the door that makes him close it again and break eye contact with Dean in order to glance at the door.
It’s the first time Dean’s spoken to Cas directly since he’d punched him. Cas bites his lips and shamelessly runs his eyes over Dean’s features, drinking in the attention he’s finally getting from Dean. As if Cas hadn’t spent enough time over supper studying every single freckle on Dean’s face. Sam yawns obnoxiously loud.
Sam walks around the studio grounds aimless and lost, but he keeps on walking. The air is chilly and the stars in the sky are few but other than the sound of crickets, the place is quiet and leaves Sam alone with his thoughts.
"Yes, Dean?"
Sam pointedly holds the door open for them and is the last to enter the trailer after Dean.
“Dean?” Misha repeats, this time his voice is filled with recognition and hope.
of falling asleep, there’s a knock on the door and Sam jumps off the couch.
Dean fishes the script back out and reads over his first line again. Sam watches Dean mouth the words and, okay, Sam is starting to feel a bit bad for Dean.
“At least we don’t hate each other in this universe,” Sam throws in weakly.
Andrew shrugs his shoulders. “Chuck killed Eileen and when Jack makes Dean and Sam explode, Sam goes to hell. Not sure we can swing that around.” After a moment of internal debate, Andrew looks at Sam. “Although, there’s something we can do!”
The woman stares right back. After a moment, she rolls her eyes with an exasperated sigh. “Well, put them on. I know you guys are tested but we still gotta follow the policies.”
Despite the little voice in his head telling him it’s not their universe, not his Dean, not their story, Sam’s heart begins to beat faster and his grip around the pages tightens. He skims over the rest of the scene, not wanting to picture what’s described to him in black and white.
“Considering God is an all-knowing being, that's not something I can easily prove."
Chuck looks between the two of the brothers and a sad expression crosses his face. “I know with everything that’s going on it’s not easy to see people right now, but if either one of you ever wants to talk about it, I’m here for you. You know, maybe it’s good that Misha’s coming. We never really got to say goodbye to him, maybe we can all say goodbye to the show together.”
“First time I don’t see you boys going over the lines before a shoot,” the woman mentions, directing her comment to all three of them.
“I filmed Scene 14, though,” Dean tells him proudly. “Only took me seven takes.”
“And Jack?” Sam hears Dean bark. His voice comes out sounding somewhere far off in the distance, even if Dean is still standing right next to Sam.
“Well, then you know how Dean reacted.” The crisp dismissal in Cas’ voice is another custom he must've learned from Dean.
Dean slides into the chair across from Sam and gives him a concerned look.
The scene of Dean and Cas locking themselves up in the bunker, waiting for Billie to break through the door catches Sam’s attention.
Sam sighs and rests his head in his hands. It’d be easier to just come clean to Misha and tell them who they really are, but Dean made it pretty damn clear to Sam that they would act their parts.
Sam doesn’t open the piece of paper Rob gave him until they say goodnight and Sam is alone again in the trailer. The note is in Jared’s handwriting; Sam’s seen it enough in notes that are scattered all over the trailer.
“Are you okay, Dean?”
Dean grumbles something incoherently but slides his hand into the back pocket of his jeans and pulls out Jensen’s phone. Dean unlocks the phone first before handing it over to Sam.
Castiel puts the picture back on the table and finally makes eye contact with Sam. "I don't think I've ever been without a family. When I was in heaven, I considered the other angels my brothers, and when I sent to earth, it was always you and Dean. And now... I suppose I have a new family.”
Dean takes a threatening step towards the man, who, in turn, takes a step back. “Six feet, Jensen.”
Dean squints one eye open and looks at Sam. “Guess that means I’m getting myself a dog.”
. After what he’s just read, he decides Part 2 can stay in Jensen’s trailer until tomorrow.
Chuck fucking winks at Dean. “What’s the fun in being death in a godless world?”
“You wanna go for a walk?” Sam suggests, needing the fresh air and wanting to talk to Eileen in private.
Dean grabs the script from him and flips through the pages. A chuckle escapes Dean that Sam can’t even begin to understand. There’s nothing funny about this situation.
Cas takes the hint quietly and gets up.
The call gets picked up on the fourth ring and Sam lets out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding.
"It did. I'm not sure what happened. One moment I'm listening to the Empty complaining about the noise and the next moment I'm in a bed with a woman."
Chuck coughs and feebly holds up his hands in surrender.
No Genevieve, but Sam’s not willing to give up that easily. He scrolls down further until he finds the name
The urge is too strong for Sam to fight it and he pulls the phone out again and turns the screen back on. This could’ve been his life. The missed call notification feels like it’s mocking him.
Sam stands up, feeling no pain in his body other than sore muscles and exhaustion. He quickly crosses the short distance to where Dean is currently getting up on his feet.
Typed in big, bold letters on the front page are the words
“So we’re back to being…
The two of them leave the trailer and the first few minutes are filled with the crunching of their footsteps in the gravel as they walk around the deserted studio grounds.
“Fuck,” Sam swears out loud and puts the phone on the kitchen table. He walks over to where Dean is passed out on the couch and shakes his brother ruthlessly awake.
“So Jack kills us and Dean ends up living happily-ever-after with Cas in the Empty?” Sam cries out, not believing that this is actually happening.
Sam watches his brother carefully. Dean’s nostrils flare up as Misha moves past him. Dean closes his eyes for a split second, then he shakes his head and slams the door shut. His knuckles poke out white, the grip around the knob tight enough to strangle a person.
It’s Dean’s turn to sigh and roll his eyes. “Oh c’mon Sam. First Chuck sneaks into your dream and then he’s literally spelling his plan out in here.” Dean walks over and taps a finger at the script in Sam’s hand.
“We can get Sam to meet Rowena in hell and Rowena can mention that Eileen went to hell too! So they’re technically getting a happy ending as well.”
Eileen to be here. Hell, Sam still hasn’t fully grasped the fact that they’re in this universe, let alone have Eileen suddenly appear in front of him. It’s making Sam’s head spin.
The blank stares Chuck gets in return make him sigh. Resigned, Chuck summons something out of thin air and a second later, he’s holding a long scythe in his hand.
Dean lets go of the bottle. It drops down on the floor with a thud while Dean rolls over on the couch, facing away from Sam.
“Don’t see what other options we have.”
Castiel doesn’t say anything nor does he move. His back muscles tighten and he presses himself deeper into Dean. Dean wants to fight him off, take Billie on himself, but something stays him. Cas’ stance is too firm, his hold on Dean too tight. Memories of Cas staring at him, tilting his head in a way that somehow made Dean understand that he could trust Cas. Every hopeless, fighting moment floods back to Dean’s consciousness and he finds himself blindly placing his trust in Castiel.
Sam presses his eyes closed tightly, preparing himself for what’s to come.
“CUT! Misha this isn’t improv, say your goddamn line.”
The two things I really wanted to have in this fic were bad acting and the script being changed to something worse than canon. The good news is, I finally figured out the actual ending and it looks like the story is going to wrap itself up in the next chapter or so. Thanks for reading ❤️
Andrew stares at him, silent fury building up in his body. “Just what in the worlds of fucks was that?”
Dean looks at Sam wide-eyed. “You think Misha’s here already?”
Dean blushes and looks away. “Private, Sammy. Why do you think we left the room?”
“Yeah, I saw that too.”
“Yeah, you’re right. So what’s the plan?”
Dean's heart stops beating for a moment and he feels himself start to panic. He finally slows the car down to a legal speed and risks a glance in Cas' direction. "I don't want you going anywhere without me, Cas. I just... don't see us ever becoming that."
“Wait what?” Sam does
“What now, Sam?” Dean snaps from where he’s sprawled out on the leather couch doing absolutely nothing other than staring at the white ceiling of the trailer.
Dean shrugs and pretends not to notice. “If I’ve learned anything over the past few days, it’s how out-of-place mom must’ve felt when she first got here. This wasn’t her time. Her world. I guess I kinda understand her struggles now. It just wouldn’t be fair to force a version of mom here, no matter the state of the universe she’s in.”
What. The. Fuck?
“Dean,” Sam starts, the word unsure on his lips. He feels as if he’s crossed a line, read something that he shouldn’t have.
Dean exhales sharply. Even if it’s not the real Cas he’s talking to, it’s still the same deep and gravelly voice, the same deadpan responses, the same familiar shiver getting send down Dean’s spine and making his heart ache with longing. It’s not his Cas, but it’s a start.
It’s dark again and Sam feels his whole body being shaken.
“Script changes every five minutes anyway,” Sam tells a protesting Dean before leaving Jensen’s trailer.
“It doesn’t feel real does it?”
Dean rolls his eyes at him but there’s something warm and fuzzy spreading over his chest and his grip around Cas’s hand tightens.
“Are you sure it was Chuck?”
“This universe isn’t all that bad, you know?” Dean tells Sam with a grin. “Like it seems pretty fucking normal and apocalypse free.”
“Whatever you said to him must’ve changed the script!”
Sam doesn’t waste any more time on the two. He grabs Alex and shoves him forcefully into Dean’s direction. Alex stumbles for a few steps before Dean pins him against the wall. The script flies out of Alex’s hand and the breeze carries it over to Sam’s feet. Sam swiftly picks it up and stuffs it into his pocket.
“Cas, I could kiss you right now, you beautiful bastard.”
“Heard production’s gonna be delayed again today,” Alex notes.
“You’re not in that scene. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Well, if that’s the case,” Sam sits up straighter in the backseat, excitement rushing through his body. “Chuck might not even know we’re here.”
Sam pulls out Jared’s phone and checks the time on the lock screen. The kids in the pictures smile at him and Sam realizes he misses them. A one-hour phone call with a group of strangers and Sam misses all of them.
“We’re still your family,” Sam says quietly, “and I… I wouldn’t read too much into Dean’s silence.”
“Let’s get that impersonating feathery son of a bitch down here.”
“You- you have kids?” Dean stutters all the color draining from his face.
Dean rolls his eyes and turns back to the stove. He grabs two plates from the counter and starts loading both up with bacon.
“Goodnight, Sam.”
“Goodnight, Cas.”
“To Heaven. Cas says he’s going to help me rebuild it. Plus my mom is there and I want to meet her for real this time.” Jack is beaming but Dean can’t share his happiness.
Instead of waiting for them to ask, Chuck smiles broadly around the three and gives a little spin on his axis to show off his new outfit
Andrew’s face visibly falters and Sam smirks victoriously.
“I’m gonna grab a shower first, but you can head over there now if you’re ready.”
Dean lifts his eyebrows at him and puts the phone on the counter. “My fake family.”
When Sam and Dean arrive at Andrew’s office, Andrew isn’t there, but they find Alex and Castiel arguing about something in hushed voices.
Dean keeps his eyes sternly on the road.
“I’m the new Death now, boys.”
“It’s me, Dean. I’m not the real Shoshannah.”
Sam is the first to yell: “What the fuck?”
That basically answers all subsequent questions Sam had planned on asking. “It’s weird isn’t it?” Sam says instead, to which Dean gives a short nod.
“You are the most caring man on earth. You are the most selfless, loving, human being I will ever know. And ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of hell, knowing you has changed me.”
Misha doesn’t stop staring. “When did you get here?”
“4:03 if you wanna be exact,” Sam answers Dean and quickly puts the phone away before he can give the photo another glance.
pops up and Sam selects it.
“So what do you think is up with the new script,” Dean asks him, keeping his voice low.
Dean doesn’t turn around and waits for Sam and Eileen to finish walking over until they’re standing in the space Cas’s left.
Dean groans and gets up from his chair, taking the script with him and stuffing it in his back pocket.
delighted to find his nightmare replaying itself near the end of the fourth act. The “act” then skips to Sam leaving and Dean and Cas having a conversation alone in Jensen’s trailer.
“So what’s the next scene?” Dean grabs the script out of Sam’s hands and plumps himself down in the chair closest to Sam.
you have to say about that?”
Sam stares at the picture until the screen turns off. Only then does he realizes the way both corners of his lips have involuntarily shot up and put a sting in his eyes.
Dean doesn’t have to think. In a second, he’s on Billie. His finger’s digging into her infected shoulder. Billie’s scream is agonizing and pierces through Dean’s ears. He feels a shift in her body when Cas successfully rips the scythe out of her grip.
“Jensen, cut it out!”
“Jared, Jensen, six feet!”
Something, call it intuition or just desperate hope, but there’s something inside of Sam that makes him trust that the person currently occupying Misha’s body is Cas.
Dean raises an eyebrow but keeps the rest of his face completely stoic as if his life depended on him not showing any emotions. "And we’re supposed to believe that? How do we know you're not Chuck?"
Clif takes advantage of the red traffic light to take his eyes off the road and give the boys a you-guys-are-fucked look. Out loud, he says: “Pandemic, can’t go anywhere in public without wearing them.”
“Not now, Cas. Sam, what the fuck are you talking about?”
. The memory of Dean speeding to Eileen’s place, the promised text they’ll be there soon, it feels like a nightmare Sam has finally woken up from.
Chuck tilts his head and slides down in the chair across from Sam. “Look guys, I know this year has been tough and I won’t pretend to understand what it’s like to let go of something that you’ve been part of for so long. But demanding Misha to come back here isn’t going to make this any easier. Not for you, not for me, not for the show.”
“Sam?”
Dean gives him a curious look. “What do you mean?”
“Somehow I’m getting a strange sense of déjà vu here, Dean,” Sam says, bending over slightly to whisper the words in his brother’s ear, careful so the strangers won’t hear him.
His eyes still closed, Sam can hear the rattle of the fridge door opening and shutting. Must be Dean getting himself another beer.
when I was pretending to be a lousy human being. Imagine the stories being Death will inspire. The spur of creativity will be endless!”
Sam stuffs his hands into his pockets and keeps his eyes on the ground. “I’m sorry, Eileen.”
The phone buzzed a few seconds later. Castiel’s name popped up on the screen, with a text notification. Dean opened it immediately. ‘I don’t wish to speak to you currently. I’ll be home tonight.’
“My phone.” Cas was digging through his pockets, eventually producing his phone. “It’s Sam.” Answering the phone, Cas scooted away a couple of inches. “Hello, Sam.”
Cas didn’t reply, so Dean put his phone away, grabbed a beer, and settled in to pass the day with a Western movie marathon. Moping over Cas wouldn’t solve anything.
Dean dropped the tray on the counter next to the sink, not registering his brother’s exist, or the fact that Cas managed to angel magic up a clean kitchen before he left. He’d call Cas and apologize. Once Sam was gone.
The angel’s eyes widened in surprise. Where Dean would have immediately denied an accusation like that especially because it was true, Cas simply said “How did you know?”
After a brief silence, which Dean spent trying to figure out if he should punch Cas or kiss him he said, “That’s a really weird thing to say, Cas.”
“Your diet will give you a heart attack long before my me frightening you possibly could.” Castiel’s reply was instantaneous. He tilted is head, studying Dean.
Fact: Dean Winchester was gay. He slept with women only for show and he got nothing out of the experience.
“I always want to be naked with you, Cas. That’s part of the problem.” A very small part. The concession appeased Cas, who finally opened his blue eyes. The intensity of emotion he could convey with nothing more than a look never failed to shake Dean. “I’m going to grab a bite to eat with Sammy. Want me to show you how sorry I am later? I have a couple of things you haven’t learned yet.”
“Wow, what the hell, man? We take you in, we let you into the family, and then you turn my brother into some sort of-”
‘Your weakness makes me sick. So I…’
No, Cas could NEVER know. They’d never speak of it again. Too many lives were at stake, and the most important one (to Dean) was Cas’.
The memory faded, as Castiel willfully blocked out the next scene, and Castiel was again pondering a generic flower bed. The memory surfaced without his consent, and Castiel was forced to recognize the reality that ruined his moment of bliss. This morning, Dean had woke up late, blamed Cas for it, then threw on clothes and ran out of the room before Castiel had time to consider getting dressed. When Castiel arrived at the breakfast table, Sam was on his way out the door, and Dean had already gone out to the car. They were getting an early start on a hunt, Sam said. He’d told Castiel to relax and enjoy the break.
He hadn’t returned Castiel’s text, but Cas hadn’t returned any of the dozen calls Dean had made to him, or any of his stupid ass prayers. Dean stalked out to the garage, carefully backed Baby out, and tore ass onto the road. He didn’t know where Cas was, and he didn’t have to find him. All Dean had to do was keep it together long enough to get away from his brother before he lost his mind. Cas was listening now, so Dean was very careful to keep his thoughts from avoiding any form of a prayer or a curse. Nothing to summon Cas until he far enough away that no one would hear him scream at Cas for being so... stupid. He wasn’t worried, he was pissed. He was happy to pretend that he wasn’t worried to begin with.
Dean stopped putting food in his mouth for a few seconds, and replied to Cas, though he was looking at Sam the entire time. “By all means, Cas. Fly your feathery ass in whenever you’d like.” The words were about as nice as anything Dean tended to say, but there was an edge in his voice that Sam picked up on.
“Babe… get out of here. Now!”
“...and he went to school like that?” Cas asked
“Fuck yeah.” He grunted to himself, pushing in a little more. Once about an inch or so of it was in him, Dean pulled the toy back and started fucking himself with small movements. The thrusts became deeper in time as his body allowed the intrusion until he was finally filled, exactly the way he’d needed to be. This was the overwhelming desire that was ruining Dean’s life. This was the feeling that he /had/ to have. It had been eating at him, gnawing away at his brain, reminding him of its presence about four times a day. Today he’d had an intrusive thought at least once an hour, and he hunter decided he’d had enough of himself. He had to feed that inner darkness, and here he was, doing exactly that. He’d hate himself more when this was done, but right now the hunter was flying on a high.
“We need to talk.”
“Let’s just get the hell out of here before you get all sappy with me.”
“I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
The excitement dissipates from Sam and it’s his turn to look out the window with disappointment. “Yeah, you’re right.”
“Dean, stop it!” It’s Sam yelling not Cas. So much for a fucking reunion. Sam gets up from the table and tries to pull Dean away from Cas.
Dean’s eyes flicker left and right, reading over the lines he’s about to say in front of everyone.
“Heard what you said to Jack,” Sam mentions and the look he gives Dean is
Andrew looks at him confused, then his face changes and he points a finger at Sam. "HA! Good one. Two episodes left and you think we should just leave Cas in the empty? HA!"
“Yes, but when we get back-”
Dean bites his lip and turns away from Cas's boring stare and Dean makes a face at Sam.
“Yeah, I know what you mean.”
“Watcha looking for, Sammy? If we need another key to get out of this universe, I don’t think it’s gonna be in this trailer.”
“I don’t feel good,” Cas states and holds a hand to his stomach for extra effects.
Andrew disappears back into the hallway and Dean starts flipping through the pages of the script. With every page, the wrinkles on Dean's forehead deepen and his mouth is slightly agape until he reaches the last page completely wide-eyed and mouth open in shock.
“Never!” All three of them yell at the same time and Chuck looks at each of them calculatingly. Slowly, a thought crosses over Chuck’s face and his smile widens. “You know what? You’re right. Let’s bring you back.”
Fact: Dean was exhausted with his own lies and bullshit.
I hope you enjoy and it takes away some of the pain. We're all clowns together <3
The phone clattered to the floor and Dean turned in the dark room, grabbing his chest. “Cas! You gotta quit doin’ that!”
When he first fell in love with Dean, the angel thought that it was an impossible situation. That there was no possible way such a perfectly flawed being, full of so much love that he didn’t even realize, would ever look twice at him. But… he did. It was a rocky start, but from the moment the two idiots finally stopped being stubborn and admitted their feelings for each other they were inseparable. There was an unspoken agreement not to work cases together unless Castiel’s intervention was needed. Cas would be too focused on if Dean was okay than what he was supposed to be doing and vice versa. That’s what the angel had assumed at least. It was unspoken, because the two of them never talked about it. At all. Dean had been taking less and less cases recently though, and that pleased Cas. Maybe he was going to do the one thing he never thought that he would. Maybe it was finally time for Dean to retire. Cas could fatten him up with pies and steak, then argue about eating salads the next day for his health. Maybe they could get a house somewhere suburban… with a big fenced-in backyard. They could be friends with the neighbors and maybe… dare Castiel hope… start a family together.
He was so distracted by standing there dumbfounded, that Dean realized Sam and Cas’ voices were fading down the hall and he had to rush to keep up. Couldn’t Cas see that this was a bad idea? Like a really bad idea? There was a reason Dean wanted to talk to him later, after he avoided Cas for another hour or three. The guy didn’t even eat. Catching up to his brother and his... his Cas, Dean found Sam and Cas laughing about something, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
Faster and faster his hands moved, stroking his length and fucking himself while he thought of Cas. The fantasy kept shifting now. Cas fucking Dean in various places and positions, all over the camp. He knew he was getting close, and he wanted to shove every scenario he could come up with into the small window of opportunity. After tonight, Dean planned on locking the Cas thoughts up with the toys, tightly sealed and buried under multiple layers of security, not to be seen again for a very long time, never if he was lucky.
Sam was impressed, Cas was usually pretty off the mark, but he got it on the money this time.
It was a risk with Sam home, even though he’d be fast asleep. They didn’t have anything going on the following day, and Dean was hoping Sammy would wake up early and do... something. Anything.. Go for a twenty mile run, or go back to Eileen’s where Dean had dragged him from. What if he didn’t though? Sam was up early. He wouldn’t check on Dean, but he might peek in on Cas since he never slept. If he wasn’t there, what would Sam think? Probably that Cas went somewhere and that he’d back, not that he was in Dean’s bed. He was starting to battle with himself when a gruff reply from Castiel interrupted his thoughts.
It was funny, in a tragic sort of way, when Cas really examined it. Here he was, an angel of the Lord, turning his back on heaven time and time again to save one man. It took him years to understand why, to recognize the feelings he had for Dean for what they really were. When he had connected all the dots and realized he was in love, Castiel did the one thing he now realizes he never should have done. He’d told Dean everything.
“No really Dean, It’s late and I’m already here. I’m not leaving tonight.”
Dean settled onto his pillow almost immediately, puling the blanket back around him as he mumbled. “Don’t tell Sammy.”
He stepped out of the Impala, calmly walked to the front of the car, and leaned against the hood.
“Morning, Cas.”
“Yeah, we’re good. No crap to figure out.” Sam was watching Cas while his brother said that line, so he saw the hurt that flashed across Cas’ face. He wasn’t surprised. Dean avoiding his problems wasn’t anything new to him. Dean must have seen the look too, and it surprised Sam when he spoke again, in a quieter tone. “We’ll deal with it later.”
“You had headphones in. In the dead silence I heard the song, said ‘huh. Cas is weird’ to myself and went back to sleep.”
A non-committal grunt was the only response Dean offered and his breathing evened out within seconds. Cas was still sitting in the middle of the bed. He stayed there for about twenty minutes, but the position was not one particularly comfortable for him. An attempt to lift Dean’s arm so he could move was met with resistance. Dean not only didn’t want to be moved in unconsciousness, he pulled at an unaware Castiel closer to him. The angel hadn’t expected that, and he fell onto his side, next to Dean. The hunter’s lips curved into a smile, then softened out into the peaceful expression of slumber.
Were Cas aware that Dean had to be up early, he certainly would have woken him at an appropriate time. He was as startled as Dean was this morning when Sam banged his fist on the door and yelled through it for Dean to wake up because they were going to be late.
Dean turned his attention to Sam, and his glare melted into shocked disbelief. “You want me to get up and go sit over there?”
The hunter eyed his bed, but shook away the thought. He had to sleep there later. Instead he draped a towel over the couch and plopped down. The only thing he was wearing was his socks and he propped his feet up on the coffee table, legs spread. Slouching down the shabby piece of furniture, and scooting until his ass was hanging off the edge, Dean started with giving his length a few tugs. He’d had a chub since his hand touched the dildo. Still slowly stroking himself, Dean picked up the toy and wrapped his lips around it. He sucked on the silicone tip, tongue teasing it as if it were the real thing. He pushed the toy into his mouth slowly, and the first time it hit the back of his throat, he choked on it. Dean groaned loudly, his length fully hardening from that more than his own touch. He pulled back and started again, until he was able to relax his throat enough to take most of it into his mouth.
“What do you want, Lucifer?”
“Can you guys work your crap out later? This salad is delicious.” A smug smile spread over Sam’s lips as he realized the perfect solution. “Or, we can sit here and hash this out. You can both tell me exactly what the problem is and we’ll all find a solution together.”
Dean was well aware of his own sexuality, and he hated himself for it with every fiber of his being, but he’d made it this far in life without succumbing to that deepest desire. Sort of. The only man who’d ever fucked Dean was himself, and tonight he was going to do the honors once again.
His first crush disappeared under mysterious circumstances, last seen with John dragging him off. His one failed attempt at actually dating a man went up in flames before it got off the ground because Dean couldn’t bring himself to fully admit his fears. When he tried to explain about his trauma, about John, that man had left and run away. He ran straight to another time period, preferring the 1800s over the possibility of ever running into Dean again. And Cas... no. Cas couldn’t be touched by this. Cas was the only thing that made this life worth living. He was the only one who understood even a modicum of the weight the hunter carried on his shoulders, and even Cas didn’t know Dean’s true secret. It didn’t matter how bad Dean wanted Cas. He couldn’t have him, not in any form. Not ever. He couldn’t risk Cas.
He crouched next to Dean, first carefully removing one boot, then the other. The jeans were next and he folded them as he rose. Grabbing one set of pajamas from the folded pile of clothes on the table, he brought Dean’s flannel pants, holding them up with a small smile.
Hoping the yelling was done for now, Dean pulled the Impala onto the road. Sammy was probably enjoying the show, and this wasn’t a discussion anyone but him and Cas needed to be involved in. “I’m exhausting?”
Cas managed not to laugh. In fact, all he did was stand at the bedside, patiently waiting for Dean to complete his inspection. “That is supposed to be much better for you and the package promised it would taste similar.” There was a tinge of censure in his voice, though he tried to keep it from crossing the line to bitterness. “Usually breakfast in bed is better received in the movies.” In the movies, there wouldn’t have been a mess of burnt toast, dirty pans, and batter drying on most of the surfaces in the kitchen, but Cas was hoping he’d have time to clean that up before Dean saw.
“You look... awake.” Dean was sarcastic but wholly lighthearted.
Dean piled his dirty dishes into the basket and took out the deck of cards.
“Over that way,” Castiel held his hand up and to the left, motioning towards the general area, “is the Andromeda Galaxy. It’s the closest major galaxy to the Milky Way. We’re actually on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy.”
Dean smiled, “Yeah, so whenever you’re ready let me know.”
“We’ve had them for about 2 months now.” Charlie answered.
“Can we take him for a car ride?”
“Those are to protect the bees from ants. Bees are very susceptible to pests, so you have to be careful of that.” Stevie put the frame back and shook her hand so that the bees fell in. “Varroa mites are the worst and most common problem with bees, what I do is dust a cup of powdered sugar over the top of each box to knock the mites down, and I coat the bottom board with cooking spray so they can’t escape. Your best best for pest control is just going to be close monitoring.”
Dean scratched his head and laughed awkwardly. “Yeah, okay. Definitely.” he looked at Cas, “You ready to go?”
Dean scrambled to follow him to the bunker garage, “You’ll see.”
“Can I give these to him now?” Castiel asked, somewhat tentatively.
“Me and Cas are gonna check out Stevie’s bee farm today, wanna come?” he offered.
Cas and Dean followed her out the sliding glass door, on the balcony there was a structure shaped like two square boxes on top of each other, standing on four legs which were each in their own small bowl of water.
“Are you ready to go home?” Dean asked.
Dean let out a small laugh, “Yeah, he’s a puppy, Cas. ‘Course he has energy.”
They walked silently again for a moment before Dean continued, “You should see him in the car, the other day I swore he was gonna jump out.”
Dean only had to wait a couple minutes before Cas came clambering out in sweatpants and a hoodie.
“Okay that’s it.” Dean grumbled then tore the blanket off of Cas and threw it on the floor.
Dean smiled, “Hi, Stevie-“
All Castiel did was sigh and shift his shoulders a bit. “Cas!” Dean tried a third time, raising his voice from a whisper. Castiel curled into the fetal position and tucked himself into his comforter.
The next morning a text from Charlie was waiting, all it said was ‘come today’. Dean left his room only to find Jack in the kitchen eating a bowl of Fruity Loopies.
“Why were you driving around in the middle of nowhere?” Cas raised a questioning eyebrow.
Dean picked up the flower and put it back, “Did you like your food?”
He poured them each a cup of coffee, “...so I hope you’re hungry.”
Then Dean hauled the basket out to his car, and came back to Castiel’s bedroom where he was still sleeping soundly. Dean cracked the door and looked in on Cas, he was on his stomach with one arm above his head, one leg outside the blanket, and his face was buried in his pillow. Dean pushed the door further and quietly walked over to the edge of the bed, then he placed a gentle hand on Castiel’s shoulder and whispered, “Hey, Cas.”
“What is this for?” Castiel looked at Dean questioningly, taking the coat.
“But you’re afraid of flying.” Cas deadpanned.
Dean only smirked in response, just then he stopped the car and got out.
“Oh?” Castiel said through a mouth full of bacon.
“Vermont maple.” he said with a smile.
He tried again, this time fully pushing Castiel’s foot a few inches to the left but Cas was still too enthralled in Empire of the Black Sea  to notice apparently. He had taken up reading as a hobby since they defeated God, but it was always in depth history books that he read despite the fact that he himself has existed since the dawn of time.
Charlie laughed, “Oh, Cas, baby, I was just messing with you guys.” she pulled them each in for a literal breath-stopping hug.
Castiel immediately put a small amount of sugar in his coffee and downed half the cup.
Stevie smiled wide and gave them each another hug, Charlie came around to do the same.
“Every few days, yeah.” Dean looked at Cas but continued walking.
“It’s November in the middle of Kansas, and we’re gonna be outside. Wear the damn jacket.” Deans words were a little harsh but he looked at Castiel with nothing but love. As was usually the case.
“You don’t like it?” Dean asked, feeling the beginnings of self-consciousness.
So, when he was done cleaning up Dean texted Charlie and told her they wanted to take her up on the bee offer, then he went to bed.
“You know we’ve never been on a date.” Dean said.
“Yeah, I’ll tell him.” Dean pulled the dish towel off his shoulder and dropped it on the counter.
Castiel chuckled and Miracle popped up at the sound of plastic.
Castiel watched Miracle thoughtfully, he was digging a hole.
“We’re in the middle of nowhere.” Castiel stated the obvious.
In the car on the way home, just a few minutes into the ride, Cas turned towards Dean, “I want to start a bee farm.”
In the car, Cas couldn’t contain his excitement, “Do you think the farm is big? Do you think there are a lot of bees, Dean?”
All that came in return was a grunt from Castiel.
Cas looked at him, “I love it.”
“Who goes there?” she asked even though Dean had texted her prior to their arrival.
“Charlie said we could check out the bee farm today.”
Dean smiled a little wider, “Let’s take him for a walk.”
Dean fumbled to put on jeans and a t-shirt, ran his hand across the top of his head, and then he rolled up his comforter into a ball. Slipping his feet into his boots without tying the laces, Dean slowly opened his bedroom door. He peeked out left and right, the last thing he wanted to do was wake somebody up and ruin his plan. Upon concluding that everyone was still sound asleep, Dean opened the door further so he could walk out and tiptoe down the hall with the ends of his shoelaces clicking on the floor.
Dean busied himself feeding Miracle and taking him outside, and when he got back Cas had appeared on the big corner chair in the library.
They finished their circle around the general bunker property and when they got back to the entrance Dean handed Cas the leash.
He opened the basket on the island, and inside he put two plates, forks, and coffee mugs. He added a bottle of syrup and a small container of sugar for the coffee. Then Dean went to make waffles, eggs, and bacon, all of which he put in their own Tupperware and stacked in the basket. He made a pot of coffee to add to the basket in a thermos, and at the very end he added another small container containing milk, also for the coffee.
Cas paused a minute before answering, “Both.”
Cas arched an eyebrow, “I’ve never heard you talk like that before.”
“Yes.” Castiel replied. “Thank you again Charlie, Stevie.” he nodded and grabbed Dean’s hand to lead him out the door.
“It’s astounding how factually inaccurate these historical ‘nonfictions’ are.” Castiel said mostly to himself. This time Dean drew his foot back and actually kicked Cas in the shin.
Miracle jumped and twirled and pawed their feet at the mention of a walk. Castiel leaned back down to scratch his ears lovingly while Dean stepped into the store room to get a leash.
Dean returned and clipped the leash to Miracle’s collar; he continued prancing around and it caused the leash to jump around in the air with him.
After about ten minutes Castiel asked, “Do you walk him all the time?”
“Come here, boy.” he waved the dog over, then he sat down cross-legged against the wall and urged Cas to do the same. Castiel seated himself next to Dean, slowly, in an attempt to not spook the dog, however the attempt was futile since animals typically loved him. Castiel was an angel, he was capable of great things and small things, including talking to animals. Miracle instantly crawled into Castiel’s lap and began pawing at his chest, so he lifted a hand the the dog’s back and scratched his fingertips under the fur, Miracle nuzzled into his chest. Dean reached a and over to rub the dog’s head, “Good boy! Yes, who’s a good boy!”
“Did ya get stung?” Charlie joked.
“You should come over more often.” Charlie looked pointedly at Dean, “We can play D&D.”
Dean replied, “I hate to pass up home cooked burgers but we got the kid waiting back home, so we should probably hit the road.”
“What are the bowls of water for?” Castiel asked.
Dean, relieved at seeing the pup was all right, knelt, “Hey, buddy!” he scratched the dog enthusiastically. Dean stood back up and moved towards Castiel across the hall.
“What.” he said it so soft, still mostly asleep.
“Night.” Dean lifted a hand to his temple in a lazy salute, and as Sam walked off Dean bumped Castiel’s foot under the table.
“Also, watch this...” Dean stood up and Miracle followed, jumping around like his life depended on getting that dog treat. Dean held one hand out, palm up, and the dog sat so Dean gave him a piece. Then he pinched his fingers and made a circular motion, Miracle stood on his hind legs and turned around in a full circle. Dean gave him the rest of the pieces.
“Food’s gonna get cold, Cas.” he said it very quietly compared to how he was talking earlier.
Dean rounded the corner with a grocery bag in hand, he held the bag out and shook it. “We have options.”
“Where are we going?” Castiel asked, standing up.
Stevie ushered Castiel and Dean back inside where Charlie was now watching TV.
“That’s about the gist of it.” she said.
There was a rustling from the library, where the two were watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, before they came hurrying to the kitchen.
“No, you answered all of my questions. Thank you, again.” Castiel said.
“Want to play Uno?” he asked Cas who was licking his fork.
“I dunno.” Dean came to a halt in front of one apartment building, “I guess we’ll find out.”
A little later, after they’d finished eating and the credits were rolling, Cas said, “I think it’s time to go to bed.” he looked pointedly at Jack dozing off in his chair. Dean nodded and got up to grab everyone’s dishes.
Cas was asleep.
“I ordered them from a beekeepers’ guild. That is the most roundabout way to raise bees, though. You can also get a young hive with a newly laying queen from a beekeeper, but, if you do that, make sure you know who you’re buying from.” Stevie gave them both a stern look.
“We’re not going very far.” Dean replied, there was a slight incline like they were driving up a hill. Slowly, wild poppies started to appear around them, the bloom was something that happened in the late spring every year.
“Okay,” Castiel nodded. “I'd love to see Stevie’s bees.”
Castiel nodded, “What about honey?”
Castiel was patiently waiting in the passenger seat of the Impala when Dean came out with an armful of what appeared to be blankets, and he moved around the back of the car to shove it all in the trunk. When he got in the drivers’ seat he handed Cas a coat.
There was a buzz and a click and Castiel was able to open the door, they turned left and climbed the stairs.
Dean rolled his eyes and held down the button again, “You know who, open up.”
By the time Dean shuffled and dealt the cards, Cas was putting his things in the basket.
“Mhm, okay. Yup, love ya too.” Dean grabbed the phone and held it properly.
Dean smiled at him and picked up his cards, they started playing Uno. They bickered a bit but it was lighthearted, Cas wasn’t lying about being a card shark and Dean accused him of cheating, and on and on. Eventually they stopped playing cards and just relaxed together among the poppies until it was time to go back home.
A minute later Castiel entered the kitchen with an additional three glasses and set them by the sink, “These are from Jack’s room.”
“Go ahead and break it up a little, the treat’s too big for him.” Dean said.
Cas blushed harder and hit Deans knee with the back of his hand, “Let’s just play cards already.”
“Oh! Hey, Dean.” She went to hug each of them. “Hey, Cas.”
“Come on in! Stevie won’t be home for a few, but the bees are out on the balcony.” Charlie swept her hands out wide.
Dean unrolled his comforter and pulled it around both of them; even though it was getting close to summertime, that day was particularly cool.
She walked into the kitchen, the apartment had an open floor plan so they could all still see each other.
Castiel was taking notes on his phone and Dean stood to the side, hands in his pockets.
Dean laughed, “Don’t worry, sunshine.”
They both got in the front seat and pulled out of the garage, car rumble echoing off of the ancient stone walls of the bunker as they left.
They sat there in the hallway and coddled Miracle for another fifteen minutes, until he was completely curled up between Castiel’s knees, calmer but still wagging his tail.
Dean proceeded to dump a significant amount of syrup on his waffles, to the point that Castiel’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline in alarm.
“Well, the first thing you’re gonna need is a brood box and bees. You start with one and expand as your hive grows. Also, try to have it facing south.” Stevie began.
Castiel looked down at Miracle still hopping around with as much enthusiasm as before. Cas led the dog over to a nearby bush and plucked a flower; he knelt to tuck it under the dog’s collar, then he scratched Miracle’s back and kissed him on the head.
Dean took the bottle of syrup out of the basket, leaving only the deck of Uno cards, and he shook it.
Dean glared at her but Cas stood still, confused for a moment before he said, “Castiel.”
He wordlessly held the poppy out to Dean, who took it, broke most of the stem off and tucked it behind his ear. Then Dean picked a pink one and did the same for Cas.
“You’re gonna love him.” Dean was wiggling the bunker key in the lock, almost too excited to even let them into the bunker. When he at last got the door open, he and Castiel stepped through, but Miracle didn’t come running like he normally did. The dog was an enthusiastic one to say the least, he never failed to greet his caretaker, so this was unusual. Concerned, Dean started down the stairs, followed by Castiel.
Stevie rolled her eyes, “Is there anything else you guys needed to know?”
Dean woke to a sharp beeping sound, he held still and willed the sound away, but when it became apparent that it wasn’t going to disappear on its own he sat up and violently ripped the alarm clock’s cord out of the wall. He had very specific plans for that day so instead of going back to sleep he groaned into his pillow for five minutes, before he rolled out of bed and onto his feet. The previous day it had dawned on Dean the he and Cas had never been on a proper date. They’d literally been to hell and back, purgatory and heaven, they’d fought endless fights and repeatedly saved the world together, but they’d never had a date. So Dean decided he was going to orchestrate one, a picnic. It wasn’t much, but if there was anything he and Castiel shared it was an appreciation for simplicity; Dean’s born from a childhood of sacrifice, so that as an adult he provided for himself the basic things in life which he previously went without; and Castiel’s from an eternity of having most everything at his whim, wearing him weary of heaven’s grandeur.
“Ah, here we go,” she held up a small bag, grinning.
“You know what, we can just go ho-“ Dean started but Cas interrupted by leaning up to catch his lips in a chaste kiss.
Dean already had his own plate in hand and was walking to the library to watch with them. It was still playing when he got there, right at the part where Ferris picks up Sloane from their high school in Cameron’s stepdad’s Ferrari. Just as Dean was seating himself, Cas and Jack shuffled in with their spaghetti.
Dean held Castiel’s elbow to guide him towards the counter where Charlie poured three glasses.
Cas rustled slightly, “Thank you, Dean.”
“He recognizes the word, so if i say it he’ll get excited again.”
Dean huffed a laugh, “Hey, kid.”
“Yeah, yeah, love you too, Cas.” Dean smirked under the collar of his own jacket. They settled back down, watched the sky and listened to Keane and whatever else Dean put on the mixtape while Castiel pointed out constellations and named stars.
“Wherever, we got time.” Dean held Castiel’s gaze for a moment then looked into the rear view mirror to turn around. They drove for a while with Miracle in Cas’s lap again, he stuck his head out the window, his tongue out, his fur blowing in the wind. They drove until they decided to stop at a burger shack where they could eat outside with Miracle, they even ordered a plain burger for him, and they enjoyed their lunch like the happy family that they were.
He was finishing the last of his eggs and went to pour more coffee but Castiel had taken the rest of it. He rubbed his hands together.
Dean chuckled, “ Thanks, Cas.”
“We have Beggin’ Bits, which are his favorite,” Dean plopped back down next to Cas, “we have these tiny ones, and we have Greenies.”
Castiel picked up the dog and carried him instead of walking him, and they got into the front seat of the car.
“Do you wanna give him a t-r-e-a-t?” Dean glanced at Cas, who was equally amused and perplexed.
Dean sat down and patted the ground next to him where Castiel placed himself.
“I didn't say I wanna go there.” Dean looked at Cas next to him, “Besides, I found this place a few weeks ago and I thought you’d like it.”
“We’ve never had a dog before.” Dean replied.
“A picnic?” Cas guessed. “In the poppies? Oh, Dean.”
Cas and Dean stepped through the door and Castiel immediately started asking questions.
“Yeah, we really appreciate it.” Dean said.
“Sure sounded like it.” Dean teased.
Cas suggested, “Let’s give him the first one?”
Dean nodded with a smile.
“This is delicious.” Jack said around a bite of meatball, he plopped himself down in the chair right next to Dean’s. Cas sat down across the table, then they ate their meal and watched the rest of the movie together.
“Yeah.” Cas rolled off the top of the car, dragging the blanket with him, and lumbered into the front of the car. Dean packed everything into the trunk and when he sat down in the drivers’ seat Cas had fallen back to sleep. He started the car and pulled back into the road, then he placed his hand over Cas’s.
Charlie was waiting at the door, “State your names.”
After he finished chugging coffee Cas asked, “What made you even come up with this?”
“Yeah, Charlie.” There was a pause.
Castiel walked up to look at the bees, they were climbing on top of each other and there was a thin comb beginning to form in there. From a distance the hive looked like an optical illusion of sorts, but up close you could see how much life was inside it.
Dean pushed the other bags behind him, then opened the Beggin’ Bits and took out a piece. He broke it in half and gave one part to Cas.
“Are they difficult?”
Castiel leaned over to the nearest bunch of flowers and plucked one. It was peach colored with a small bud and a long green stem.
He put them away, grabbed his picnic basket, and tiptoed back down the hall.
Dean made his way to the storage room. Every once in a while someone came up on something that they didn’t know they had in there and, conveniently, Dean found a picnic basket just a few days prior and he’d stowed it on the top shelf in the back. He spotted the basket in the far corner and easily weaved through the shelves to get to it, but when he reached up to retrieve said basket, a series of plastic cups came tumbling down with it.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean whispered and knelt to pick up the cups.
“All righty then, have fun.” Dean grabbed a breakfast bar and walked out.
“That didn’t answer my question in the slightest.” Castiel was able to effectively glare at Dean this time. Dean glanced at him out of the corner of his eye.
Cas was bleary eyed and suffering from bed head but he still attempted to glare at Dean. His attempt failed.
“Okay, then let’s start a bee farm.”
“Oh, really?” Cas perked up. He loved bees, he’d even talked recently about starting his own bee farm, so going to see what it was like first didn’t sound like a bad idea to him.
Castiel was ready to go at eleven o’clock, so they said their good byes to Jack, who was finishing the first Back to the Future, and they left.
Dean’s worry grew, he whistled and patted his thighs, then proceeded to walk the bunker repeating the actions until he heard a faint scratching sound. Dean and Cas followed the sound all the way to the storage room at the end of the hall, past him and Sam’s rooms, and Dean opened the door cautiously. Miracle jumped out from behind and pawed at Dean’s knees.
Dean smiled softly at Castiel, “No, she started a bee farm. Charlie told me today. She said we could go check it out.”
“Ow!” he looked up from his ‘factually inaccurate historical nonfiction’ to glare at Dean, “What did you do that for?”
“No, thank you. I want to watch all three Back to the Future movies today.” Jack answered.
They snacked on seeds and sipped their juice, talked for a while until Stevie came in the front door.
“It’s no problem.” Stevie smiled at the couple. “Let me know if you decide to start one of your own, I’d like the grand tour.” she hung her gloves back up.
“Sure.” he was too absorbed in cleaning his plate of every bit of food to give much of a response.
“Jesus Christ.” Castiel was still going on about his waffles.
Cas held the coat in his lap and Dean started the car, driving up the ramp and out of the bunker garage. The car ride, for the most part, was silent aside from the usual sassy comment from Cas. They drove past farms; and then the farms became tall grass; and then they eventually got into such a rural area that they ran out of road to drive on, so Dean parked the car facing the open field and got out, door hinges creaking. Castiel stepped out of the car and arranged himself in the coat while Dean took the blankets from the trunk. He started by draping an old blanket over the hood, then he layered it with a few more. He propped two pillows against the window, and finally he hauled the comforter from him and Cas’s bed out of the trunk and placed it atop the cacophony of fabric. Dean turned to smile at Cas and held his arms out in a ‘voila’ manner.
“I want to take you on a date.”
“Perhaps I could go? I wouldn’t mind chipping in on occasion. I do live here.” Cas said, standing and walking out the door with Sam.
This was the perfect opportunity to make a dirty comment, one that came easy to Dean. He almost did, but he made the mistake of glancing over to Cas before talking. He looked so confused and lost that Dean could no longer bring himself to razz him.
Cas, on his knees between his legs in front of the couch, while Dean held both his legs and watched his best friend relentlessly slam into him. A couple minutes later the image shifted and Dean moaned loudly as he pictured the toy he was using as Cas, fucking him from behind in the shower while the hunter had his hands splayed on wall bent over and legs spread.
“Wow.” It was the only response Castiel seemed able to muster, and Dean took pride in that.
“It was a genuine and unique compliment. I truly spent most of the day and night thinking of them.”
Dean applied a generous amount of lube to two fingers. He could always sneak another bottle on a raid or something if he used too much. He’d done it once or twice before. Ignoring his length for now, Dean slipped his left arm under his left knee and lifted his leg off the coffee table, pulling it to his chest so his foot was dangling in the air. His other knee dropped, falling wide and opening his legs as far as he could in this position. The hunter teased his hole with one finger, circling it, covering it with lube, just poking at it. As soon as he could, he pushed one fingertip in, just to the first knuckle and he started working himself in a circle. Dean hated how long it took to prep himself. He wish he could fuck himself close to raw, pushing in until he was too sore to properly sit or walk the next day. Fuck, but he /loved/ that feeling. It wasn’t an option right now. Tomorrow Dean had a mission and he was stuck with Cas. There was no way. Dean was taking his time tonight so he could fuck himself the way he needed. This was his night off with himself to take care of things so life would return to normal— as normal as this life ever got, anyway
“Oh c’mon, Cas. Seriously?”
As the high from his climax dissipated, the shame set in. Looking down at himself, Dean didn’t see evidence of an extremely satisfied and satiated man. What he saw was his own weakness. He removed the toy from himself and stood on shaky legs, picking up the towel to clean himself off. He’d need a shower, but this was good enough for now. The towel got buried in the middle of his laundry pile and Dean went to the sink, once again scrubbing his toy completely clean. It needed to dry before he put it away, so the hunter covered it with a kitchen towel, double checked the locks on the doors, and took his clothes to the bathroom with him. A quick scrub down in the shower removed all evidence of his own pleasure, and Dean focused on the future.
There was no reply, other than a soft sigh that turned into a quiet snore. He had not expected one. If Cas thought it was possible for Dean to consciously hear him, he’d have stayed silent all night. The words Castiel spoke were solely for his own gratification. Had his beloved hunter heard Castiel, he’d be halfway out the door, with his pants on backwards. As it was, Dean slept peacefully, with the ghost of a smile on his lips, and Castiel was content to hold him as long as he could, simply reveling in the feeling of belonging and home that he got from Dean.
“You. With me. No trench coat or tie.”
Dean relaxed under the angel’s touch. He couldn’t be mad, even if he wanted to be. Right now, he didn’t. They’d gotten into too many arguments in the last few days. He was tired of fighting, especially with Cas. “It’s really annoying when you’re right and I want to be self-righteous.” The corner of Dean’s mouth twisted into a half smile and he turned his head enough to press a quick kiss to Cas’ head.
Just like that, the lights went black, Lucifer and his demons disappearing.
“Demons!”
“You’re something else, Cas.” The smile that accompanied the words made Cas believe, perhaps fraudulently, that Dean meant that as a compliment. “If Sammy went to Eileen’s, he’ll be gone all day. Sit. Hang out with me.” Castiel immediately sat on the small space of mattress at the edge of the bed next to Dean, and Dean sighed heavily. “Cas, you’re an idiot. Get in this bed with me.”
“What was I supposed to tell him? Sorry Sammy, you overheard me swearing at you because you calling made Cas move across the car and I wanted to cuddle? Outside of the fallout of that, do you know how that sounds? Do you? I’m a dude that doesn’t use the word cuddle! Especially to his brother.”  Dean probably could have been more eloquent and less loud, but it was Cas. Lately all roads with Castiel ended up with the hunter frustrated, usually with himself.
“Don’t do what?” His eyes widened in confusion, and he sat back against Dean’s thighs, deflated.
Looking back now, he could see that Dean wasn’t read. Castiel now understood that for someone as beautifully complicated as Dean was, simple emotions would not be simple to him. Pure love wasn’t simple to Dean, it was complicated, convoluted, mixed up in fear, trauma, and repression. In hindsight, Cas realized that he also forgot to factor in Dean’s entrenched ideas of genders, sexuality, and that any relationship he had was doomed to end in physical and emotional pain.
The hunter’s eyes strayed down to Cas. The angel had the same dopey smile Dean had, so he knew Cas was teasing. Huh. Castiel, angel of the lord, teasing. That was... different. He didn’t give himself the chance to decide if it was good different or bad different. Dean cleared his throat, physically and mentally shaking the urge to say something incredibly sappy that he’d regret later. “Sam thinks it’s a siren, not a wraith. We’ll poke around tomorrow morning and see what we can find.”
Something was going on. Sam didn’t know what happened, but Cas was pissed. Neither of them said a word on the way over; Dean didn’t even turn the radio on once.
If Dean didn’t push Sam away so hard to get away from John when they were younger.
Cas wasn’t wrong. That wasn’t a bad solution, actually. Even if Dean wasn’t aware it was something the happened. “Let me grab those.” He lifted the much heavier bag over the bench, and put it on the floor next to his own bag. After a brief glance at Cas, Dean focused his gaze on the road and cleared his throat. He made sure to not look at Cas at all, because that would make this little speech impossible to get through. The hunter hadn’t said anything yet, and his heart rate had already picked up. He could feel the steering wheel slicken beneath his palms, and Dean took a deep breath to try to calm himself. It didn’t work. He hated this. “I know I’ve been a pain in the ass, Cas.” Literally. Dean smirked to himself at that thought and continued. “I know how hard it is to put up with me. I don’t know that I’m going to get easier to deal with. Thank you for not giving up on me. I’m trying, Cas. I want to get there, but I’m not.”
Castiel deepened the kiss, clinging onto Dean. His tongue swept out across the hunter’s lips and Dean opened, wanting to taste Cas. The world faded away for that moment, and they were two people... beings... something, together. In lo- Making out. It was hot.
There were no winners in this godforsaken life. There was only surviving, and the hunter wouldn’t be able to even do that if he allowed himself to /ever/ think about this again.
“Alright, alright. I’m moving!” Dean shrugged Sam’s arm off as he stood, and adjusted his jacket, as if that earned him some dude points that he’d lost from Cas’ small speech.
Dean had told Cas to wake him up early, didn’t he? He couldn’t remember now, but he thought he had. That didn’t matter. What mattered is that Dean saw that look on Cas’ face all day. Every time the hunter closed his eyes, Castiel’s blue eyes widened in hurt as Dean all but ran from the room. He heard Sam’s voice in his head as they left that morning.
“Yeah. Bobby loved telling that story. It was the one and only time he supervised our formal education.”
“Yes, of course.” There was an expectant pause, and Dean glanced over to the angel, waiting. “Together or separate?”
“Dean, c’mon.” Sam dragged his brother up by his arm before he started arguing with Cas again.
He had just flipped the covers off of himself when Cas bustled in with a tray of food. Dean’s eyes lit up. There was bacon and coffee on that tray. He pulled the covers back over himself and scooted so he was sitting against the headboard with a big grin.
“Yes, I’m going with you. Sam wants to spend time with his girlfriend, get rid of us, and avoid us fighting all at the same time.”
“One of these times you’re going to give me a heart attack,” Dean said in a bad attempt at a joke to cover his still-racing heart. It was because of being startled, that was all. His eyes narrowed and he looked Cas up and down clinically. “Not a scratch on you. Of course there isn’t.” He started to pace, pulling at his hair. “Where the hell have you been? What were you doing?” ‘Who were you with’ almost came out of his mouth, but Dean knew better.
“Crap.” Dean muttered under his breath then louder. “Yeah I’m up Sammy! Still in bed.” He shot Cas a panicked look then flapped his arms in an elaborate shooing motion.
“Are you going to kill me or not?”
“What did Sam want? He said there was a change, and then you interrupted. Quite rudely, I’d like to add.”
Castiel turned back towards them. Both the Winchesters picked up their forks at the same time and went back to eating in such perfect synchronization that Castiel’s eyes narrowed in suspicion. Neither Sam nor Dean reacted to Cas.
He quickly rinsed himself off and got out of the shower and dressed with his back to the mirror. Dean couldn’t even stand to look at his own face right now, he was that ashamed of what he’d done.
“It’s like six. Want to grab some dinner?”
“I honestly have no idea, Sam. They are rather comfortable, though.” Cas picked at the cotton pants, once again marveling at the comfort.
“I didn’t realize I woke you.” Cas stated solemnly. “I’m so sorry.” His hand was resting on Dean’s chest above his t-shirt; he slid it under the flannel, his arm curling around the hunter’s side. Dean wasn’t a hundred percent sure what was happening until he felt the other hand slip under his jacket and flannel behind his back. Both of the angel’s hands linked together just under Dean’s ribs and he squeezed. Huh. Cas was hugging him in the car. It was a damn good hug too, not that Dean was planning on speaking that out loud. The hunter’s free arm moved from the back of the seat to around Cas, pulling him closer and squeezing him in return.
Reaching out, Cas crossed the small distance between them and took Dean’s hand in his, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “I thought you’d be on a long trip because you left so early. I didn’t understand what happened this morning, so I went to a park. I spent all day trying to find a plant that matches your eyes exactly, and there isn’t one. I think it’s because the color shifts. It’s something I’ve never seen on a human before. Your eyes are the same color, but they’re somehow... effervescent. No, that’s not the word. They change with your emotions, and it’s incomparable to any vegetation that’s ever existed.”
Before Dean could answer, the waitress arrived with their food. A chicken salad was placed in front of Sam, a burger for Dean of course, and Cas had ordered a plate of chili cheese fries as a meal. He didn’t touch them, even as the Winchester brothers both dug into their meals. Sam saw Dean try to subtly steal a fry, which meant what he was doing was obvious to all three of them. Cas pretending not to notice.
Dean took a deep breath to calm himself, but it did no good. His body was on alert, and no amount of shame was going to stop him now. He’d locked and barricaded every door, closed the blinds and curtains on all the windows, and put a sock on the door. It was old school, but it was an efficient way of getting everyone to leave him alone. After the camp was long asleep, he’d quietly remove the sock and let anyone who’d walked by wonder whose company Dean had been keeping tonight. Either no one would admit to it and he’d be a mystery, or one of the more boastful ladies would claim credit, and Dean wouldn’t bother to set the record straight.
Sam gets up from the couch and walks over to the door. “I’m gonna try and find Jared’s trailer. See if I can find anything useful there and get some fresh clothes.”
“Then it must’ve been Chuck. Sam didn’t do anything but sit and watch us all day,” Dean says in his little brother’s defence. “Did you get a chance to talk to Eileen yet?”
Dean winces and shuts his eyes. “Stop yelling, I feel like shit, Sam.”
“Yeah but we’re still not brothers!”
“Motherfu-”
A short woman with brown hair and a black mask runs over to Sam and Dean and hands them both a white cottony mask.
Sam successfully locates the hummus he’d bought yesterday and puts it on the counter. “What I don’t get is, why did the script change in the first place?”
and clicks on the
Sam’s heart begins to beat faster and his palms become warm and sweaty. He pushes his hands into his jeans pocket and walks over to the set of brunette hair Sam has gone far too many days without seeing.
“Just what the hell did you tell Cas?”
. In disbelief, Sam navigates back to the front page to make sure it’s the same episode Dean and Cas had just filmed. Scene 15 is NOT what it used to be. Sam goes over each scene, his heart beating fast and faster with every new scene that had not been in the script before.
think about his stupid Chuck-infused dream.
“Alex just asked me to return this to you, said you dropped it the other day,” Rob fishes something out of his pocket and hands it over to Sam.
All four of them give Andrew an odd stare.
. At this rate, we won’t finish this show until next year.”
Sam blinks heavily and pockets the phone away. It’s ridiculous, he tells himself, to feel jealous of an alternative version of himself. Sam should feel happy knowing there’s at least one universe where they don’t get screwed over by Chuck.
Dean shoots Sam another look. “Uhm… all of them?”
“This isn’t my family,” Sam interrupts and as he says the words, something cracks inside of him and he realizes that what he said is true. Gen, the kids, this life. It’s not Sam’s.
“What?” Dean spins around to where Cas is still sitting at the table.
“Equipment’s down again,
It’s Dean. Sam can feel his brother’s hand on his shoulder, shaking him awake.
“But the current script, it’s not actually how the show’s going to end, is it?” Sam interferes, changing the topic to the reason they burst into Andrew’s office in the first place.
Both Dean’s and Cas’s eyes snap up to him and Sam tries to keep his voice sturdy. He’s pretty sure he knows who it is, anyway.
“We’re ready to film the scene between Sam and Eileen now if you want to follow me to the other set.”
Sam doesn’t trust what he’s hearing. “Are you saying that this- this show, it’s ending?”
Sam and Dean both stare at her.
Sam shrugs his shoulder and wraps an arm around Eileen’s waist. Then a teasing smile appears on Sam’s face and he pulls something out of his pocket.
“Then what?”
“Me neither,” Sam echoes. He’s pretty certain that fake Chuck is just an actor but it would also be a Chuck thing to write himself a role into this universe. “Then again, if Chuck did follow us into this dimension, he could be anybody and we’d have no way of knowing.”
“But I brought back the other universes and she’s still alive in some of them… I could- I could transport her here if you want?”
it took a fucking archangel to get us out of here. There’s no archangel in this universe. There’s no archangel left in
“How long were you in the Empty for?”
Dean hangs up with a silent thank-you prayer to Cas.
“Production was shut down,” Castiel informs him and Andrew sighs in response.
“Not really.”
He gets up and walks out to the living area where he finds Castiel already awake and showered sitting on the couch.
“Perfect Jensen! That was great. Let's take a quick break and set up for the next scene.”
As they walk together in silence, Sam keeps his fingers crossed and tries his best not to get his hopes up.
Sam can do this.
“Dean! What are you doing here?” Cas exclaims and walks over to the blue X that’s inches away from where Dean is standing.
No one spoke for several minutes as the boys ate. Eventually, Dean mumbled out “I’m not mad anymore, Sammy.” Sam paused his eating and gave Dean a confused look, but both Cas and Dean were staring at their plates.
Castiel had known war, he’d known times of peace, he’d been present and nearly every biblical battle, and he could say with honest conviction that nothing had ever given him the sense of contentment, of perfect symmetry and bliss, as Dean had last night. He’d never felt anything like that.
Two months stretched into three and three to four. No one came down to check on Castiel, no one came down to torture him. Dean never found him. Maybe Dean had moved on, found someone else… someone who wouldn’t put his life in danger. The thought was agony itself and brought a greater pain than any physical damage could do, but there was a spark of hope in it too. Sure, it felt like the wait of a piano was sitting on Castiel’s chest, but what if it had been Dean? A human wouldn’t have survived this long, alone with no sustenance, no companionship. The only thing Cas could hope was that Lucifer made Dean believe that Castiel was dead… because to think that Dean was feeling as lost and hopeless as Cas was? That he too cried himself to exhaustion every night, missing the warm arms that wrapped around him, bodies fitting together like two puzzle pieces… if that’s how Dean spent every night, then Castiel was better off dead. His baby was strong, but he’d been through so much already. The uncertainty, the pain, the loneliness… if Dean was experiencing any of it, then it was Castiel’s fault. Dean wanted to stay in that morning, but Cas had pushed. If they were safe in the bunker, watching tv, making sundaes out of each other in the kitchen, doing anything, they would be okay. But here was Castiel: stuck with the consequences of wanting to go on a date with his boyfriend, and daring to hope for their future together.
“Yeah, of course. You guys ready? I’m starving. It’s Dean’s turn to shop which means there won’t be anything to eat here until he runs out of beer.”
He knew that he was wrong, but he couldn’t offer any more than an apology so he was avoiding it. How could he put into words what he struggled to admit to himself? He wanted to, but he simply couldn’t. Cas had to know that. Hell, he’d said it to Cas more than once. Every time Cas got too close Dean pushed him away, into a little corner of stolen moments and quiet nights. He knew it wasn’t fair, but he didn’t have a better answer. Cas always understood, eventually, but he couldn’t blame the angel for leaving in a tiff. Even rightfully pissed at Dean, Cas still covered his ass. That settled it. He pulled out his phone and called Cas. It went to voicemail after two rings. Did the angel grow some balls and decline his call? Dean wasn’t even mad. He was pretty impressed at that. It was no less than he deserved. Did he annoy Cas, or give him space?
“Yeah, sure. Why not?” Dean was hoping Cas would be back, but his text was encouraging. Speaking of, Dean needed to clear that off his phone. “I’m going to grab my jacket. I’ll meet you in the garage.”
“Fuck.”
“That’s what the problem was?” The words were almost a squeak and he proceeded to choke on air for a moment while his body tried to remember how to breathe. “You let me go on and on like a moron, and your problem isn’t that I lied to Sam, your problem is with the pop star I picked?”
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice was in that monotone Dean was eighty percent sure he used just to annoy him. It didn’t reveal anything. With Cas it could be anything from a chick flick speech to a random fact about a battle during the crusades, and any inappropriate question that popped into his head in between.
The discomfort in Dean was clear, so Cas leaned up and pressed a kiss to Dean’s cheek. “But you did, simply  by being you.” Color flooded Dean’s cheeks. He was... blushing? Castiel committed that to his memory. Dean, in a wrinkled t-shirt, his hair all pressed to one side, with a tray on his lap, and a shy smile. It was absolutely beautiful. “Why don’t you get out of your pajamas while I work on the kitchen?” Cas moved, lifting the tray and placing it where he was just sitting. He took the tray’s place straddling Dean’s lap. Cas was fairly certain that he had won that exchange. He leaned in for a kiss, intending to climb off Dean a moment later and depart.
“Why don’t you enjoy the remainder of your day and evening alone, Dean.” Cas sent Dean what was meant to be a reproachful look then was gone a moment later.
Dean draped one arm across the bench of the Impala, and his fingers toyed with the fabric of the angel’s trench coat. “The weirdest part of what you said is that I’m not weirded out by any of it. You’re an idiot for picking me, Cas.” His lips widened into an affectionate smile, his eyes straying from the road for a brief glance down at the angel. “You’re my idiot, though.” It wasn’t a declaration. It wasn’t what Cas deserved to hear. It was half a compliment wrapped in an insult, and Dean knew it wasn’t nearly enough, but that was all he could make himself offer.
“I need like three more hours.” Dean had rolled onto his stomach in the middle of the bed and was mumbling into Castiel’s pillow, where his head now laid. One arm swung across Castiel’s lap.
‘Found it!’
“Books. A couple that had an information about wraiths, and a couple of novels.” Dean glanced over to Cas, and he looked... sheepish? “I thought I could read in bed while you sleep. As much as I enjoy being in your arms all night, I don’t think you want me to watch you sleep every night that we spend together. That’s strange, even for me.”
Dean pulled himself out of the memory and pulled over on an abandoned stretch of road. He was about twenty minutes outside of town.
“Where’s Dean?”
“I was in a park in Tennessee, pondering foliage.”
Sam’s head was going back and forth from Cas to Dean as they volleyed words. He still didn’t know what they were arguing about, but they were definitely fighting. One Dean started yelling, Sam decided to intervene. “Alright you two, that’s enough! In case you forgot, we’re out to dinner In public.” A couple of heads had turne their way, and Sam lowered his voice. “I want to have a nice dinner, and we’re going to whether you two want to or not.” Sam swapped his plate with Dean’s, swapped their drinks, then stood. Sam used his height to his advantage while he towered over where Dean sat. Dean was busy glaring at Cas. “Get up.”
His own tone was wary when he replied. “Yeah?”
In hindsight, he would realize he really should not have done that, but at the moment it seemed like the perfect thing to say.
He was still in the middle of the bench, but Cas was far enough away that Dean felt the loss of his warmth against him. “Dammit Sammy.” Of course Sam was calling now, when everything was perfect and well out of town. He was definitely going to ruin this.
What did Dean expect, that he’d crawl under the bed so Sam didn’t see him? He got to his feet, glaring at Dean.
About halfway through the second movie, Dean fell asleep. He woke up when Sam threw a handful of popcorn at him. His phone was still in his hand and he tried to discreetly check it. Cas’ name was on the screen. The preview had the whole text. It was those heart emojis again, and nothing else. Dean quickly flipped his phone over so Sam couldn’t see it.
When he was clothed again, he put the lube and his toy away in the bag, sealed it back up, placed it back in the box and locked everything away. The small safe was returned to its place beneath the floor board. The key was hidden back in the lock box at a separate location, and Dean dropped into his bed, staring at the ceiling.
“I won’t tell your brother anything you don’t want him to know.” Castiel said seriously. Whatever plagued Dean and gave him that nightmare was clearly related to his brother, though he wasn’t sure what the connection was.
“You’re certainly right about that.” Cas agreed with Dean completely.
“Dammit, Cas!” Dean really didn’t know how to follow that up, so he didn’t.
Castiel pressed a finger to Dean’s lips to hush the protest. “You’d trust me to save your life and you’d trust me to make sure your brother is safe. You don’t trust anyone with your heart, Dean, not me or even yourself.
In this scenario, safe in his head, alone in his home, knowing this would never EVER come to fruition, he knew the answer. There were no limit with Cas. He’d let Cas do whatever he wanted, and Dean would enjoy it all. Cas was the only person in this world that Dean fully trusted. The reasons he craved Castiel so intensely was the same reason he could never have him. Trust. If he took Cas’ trust and acted on his desires, he’d lose Cas. That wasn’t an option.
‘I told you not to disappoint me again.’ His father’s words echoed in his head as the water ran down Dean’s body, his head hung in shame, cheeks flaming with embarrassment for what he’d done. ‘You’re not sorry until you’re as sorry as I am that you turned out like this.’
