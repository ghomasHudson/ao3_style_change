Tony’s heart skittered as his eyes flew to the clock hanging on the far wall.  Sure enough, it was already 7am.
Peter rolled his eyes as he opened the door. "Well, it's not like I'm not gonna ask," he said as he stepped inside, stopping short when he saw Dad sitting on the edge of the comfy armchair in the corner. He at least was wearing his dress shirt and pants, but his purple tie was loose around his neck and his suit jacket was still carefully laid out on the bed. He was leaning forward, his elbows resting on his knees, and rocking slightly back and forth.
Tony rolled his eyes, shooting his friend a funny look.  “Sam?  Sergeant Barnes?  You guys ready to roll?”
"Or just cut off his arm," said Tony. "Either would work, so long as we get our hands on the gauntlet."
"Nah, not too much," answered Ned. "Flash got a new car for his sixteenth birthday, he keeps posting all these dramatic instagram stories bragging about it."
"Absolutely not," Steve said in his Captain's voice, glaring at Tony for even daring to suggest such a thing. "Tony, I won't allow Thanos to get his hands on that stone, and that's all there is to it!"
"But he's doing all of that because he loves you," Peter said. "I've seen it. He loves you like my dad loves my papa."
were the first words that he'd ever heard Papa say to him, after he'd brought him back from the dead in the middle of the desert. Dad had told Peter later on that Papa had been begging Peter to breathe before that, but Peter didn't remember it. Just like he didn't remember most of Dad's panicked freakout before Papa got there.
"Something's—!" Peter broke off, gasping as the bolts started coming so fast they were nearly continuous. His heart, already pounding from confusion and fatigue combined with adrenaline, began to thud even harder, making his head swim.
He had overheard Dad and Papa arguing in Dad's lab late one night when he was trying to retrieve one of his books from the living room. Peter normally didn't like to eavesdrop on his dads when they were bickering, as their disagreements usually were something along the lines of how Dad wasn't taking care of himself the way Papa wanted him to or how Papa was working himself too hard in the gym. But then he had heard Papa say his name, and his curiosity ended up getting the better of him.
"Um, yeah, I guess," answered Peter. He rubbed at his nose, watching as Uncle Bucky awkwardly lowered himself down onto the hard chair next to his bed and wondering where Uncle Sam was. Uncle Bucky looked absolutely exhausted, with huge purple circles under his eyes and his hair all knotted and messy. Papa had told Peter way back in the beginning that Air Corps pilots—or at least the men, since Auntie Carol's hair was long—were required to get haircuts once a week, which meant that Uncle Bucky had already missed at least one of his.
Tony scoffed, his hand still clutching Steve's. "Did you seriously just say 'hitherto undreamt of'? Who are you, some Shakespeare wannabe?"
Steve's eyes burned with the tears he'd been desperately trying to contain as he looked down at his sweet boy, all pale and bruised and so, so small in the huge, stark-white hospital bed.
The elevator doors had barely closed when JARVIS spoke up. "Pardon me, sir, but Mr Beck has now been officially escorted from the Tower. Mr Hogan reports he will deliver the contents of Mr Beck's office as soon as possible."
And while Peter knew that his dads didn't blame him at all for what had happened, he also knew that at the moment, they had absolutely no idea of what to do next.
"That's 'cause I am!" Clint answered, clinging to Thor's arm for support as he caught his breath. "So why the hell don't you two get a room and spare us the unwelcome sideshow, eh?"
"Oh, thank you so much," Pepper said as she slumped back in her chair. "I'll have Happy bring them up tonight actually, I'd like if they could be completed as soon as possible. There are a few project leaders who like to drag their feet with reviews, and then we wind up reviewing work that was done over six months ago, and, well, like I said, that's just not acceptable."
"I'd very much appreciate it if you would allow me to accompany the team from New York, Mr Stark," said Stacy. "I know I'm not a superhero, but my experience as a SWAT team member should at least allow me to hold my own, and it'll be a lot easier to coordinate with the FBI teams from the field than from here."
Tony lifted his head, his eyebrows knitting together. "You want to take another break? After taking the entire summer off?"
But instead of the second fireball landing in the same spot as the first, it suddenly veered at the last second, landing in the yard only about fifteen metres away from the building. A split-second later the shockwave hit, blasting Peter back hard enough to knock Gwen right out of his arms as the back of his head slammed against the roof. He let out a choked scream as he watched her fly towards the edge of the building, barely having the wherewithal to activate his web shooter and launch a web towards her before she disappeared, just like she had in his vision all those months ago.
Steve's blue eyes crinkled at the corners, his lips curling into the slightest of smiles. "Yes, I think so. We'll arrange for transportation back to California for you, Mr Lang."
Howard's head snapped back as if Tony had slapped him, his eyes wild. "I never meant to hurt the boy, Tony! I would never do such a thing on purpose, so—"
Thankfully, he and Dad had been able to take enough notes—with Shuri's blessing, of course—to give them plenty of stuff to work on over the summer, once they got back from the vacation Papa was planning. Hopefully it would be enough to keep Peter from moping around the house too much, as he'd overhead Papa suggest to Dad after dinner the night before.
—Tony tapped a few commands into his keyboard, bringing up the newest encryption layers that Peter had given him the night before.
And now, as he held his entire world in his arms, all he could think about was that it had all been worth it.  That he would go through it all again, the pain, the suffering, the twenty years in the military and struggling with PTSD—
Steve curled his arm around Peter's shoulders, planting a kiss on the top of his head as Tony came into the panic room and sat down on Peter's opposite side, his tired eyes radiating his own nervousness. He had been up for most of the night, checking and double-checking and calibrating and adjusting everything at least a thousand times, trying to make sure that he had thought of every single possible permutation. Steve had attempted to go to bed without him, still wiped out from their whirlwind trip up to the Compound, but after tossing and turning for over three hours he had just given up and made some food for them instead, finally convincing Tony to rest with him on the couch for an hour or so before Peter woke up.
"Daddy, I don't—I don't know what's happening," he said as his fingers scrabbled at Tony's armour. Tony had assumed that both he and Peter would be safe when they didn't disappear like the others. But now, as Peter clung to him for dear life, whimpering in pain as bits of ash floated away from his skinny body, Tony realised what was happening.
Intellectually Steve knew that Anthony Stark wasn't personally responsible for the death of his father since Anthony had only been a small child at the time of the Battle of the Continents. But Steve had heard enough stories from his ma about Howard Stark's infamous trial for treason following the battle—and about how he'd pretty much pissed his life away afterwards—to believe that he would be perfectly fine with never associating with either of them.
"Yeah, I know it sounds crazy," Scott said quickly. "But I just can't stop thinking about it! I mean, Hope's mom survived for almost thirty years inside the Quantum Realm, and when she came out she looked exactly the same as when she went in! So there has to be a way to do it, there just has to!" He huffed out a sharp breath, throwing up his hands. "And I figured if anyone would know how to do something like this, it'd be—well, it'd be the Starks—I mean,
"Yeah, I can't say that I blame you," Natasha said with a smile. "Or, not too much. Anyway, Clint and I were talking about hosting a party for them the week after their graduation ceremony, and we wanted to make sure that you and Steve would be okay if we held it here at the Compound."
Steve's shoulders sagged, his chin dropping to his chest as his fingers curled around the sketchbook. During the war, he'd managed to lead the Howling Commandos to a final victory over the Red Skull after he had thought Bucky was dead. Even as he had blamed himself for it.
"Well, I'm sure it won't be the last word you make up in your lifetime," said Dad. "I'm pretty sure that the boy who saved the entire planet is allowed to make up as many words as he wants."
"Well, wow!" Pepper said with a surprised smile. "You guys are actually going on vacation? Not that I don't think it's a fantastic idea, I'm just really kind of surprised."
"All right, all right, enough with the goddamn chatter," Colonel Phillips cut in. "I've already got enough of a headache without all of you yahoos adding to it. Captain Rogers, how close are you to your first deployment?"
"Daaaddd, I'm not seven years old anymore," Peter said around his massive mouthful. "I don't choke!"
"Unfortunately, no. Director Fury stated that the final perpetrator took his own life to avoid capture."
And ever since then, in his own grumpy, sometimes rather off-putting way, Phillips had always looked out for Steve.
"Yeah, with you and Liz," Ned said. "Flash got bumped down to Varsity, and Cindy's now Scholastic like me."
"Like the universes where you never meet Hank Pym, for example," said Bruce. "Or where the Chitauri don't attack New York. Things like that."
Tony frowned.  That couldn't be right.  “Okay, but you told me that there were eighteen thousand units sitting in that warehouse, yeah?”
Obie breathed in, his sneer making a reappearance as he struggled against the cuffs.  “Oh, you think so, hmm?” he spat out.  “You think you're brave enough to take this all the way to court?  Well, then you’d better buckle up, you little asshole!  ‘Cause if that’s the case, I’m not gonna be holding anything back!  You and your entire entourage is gonna get dragged through the fucking mud, so you’d better be ready!”
"Oh, God!" Steve cried as he slammed the last closet door closed, raking his swollen, throbbing fingers through his sweat-matted hair. "Oh, God, I can't—I just can't do this! I just can't!"
"I don't know anything," Steve snapped, wincing when Natasha's eyes went wide. "Look, I'm not saying that—well, to be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm not saying. All I can think of at the moment is that this just seems way too much like
“Oh God, Tony, I’m so sorry I was so blind,” Steve says.  “I've been in love with you for so long, I was just too afraid to say anything.  I’m so sorry I didn't tell you sooner.  I love you, and I love Peter so much, and I’m sorry I made you think all this time that I didn't care about you.  And I’m sorry that we never got to go on a real date.”  Almost against his will, his dry, stinging lips curl into a soft smile.  “‘Cause I can guarantee it would’ve been a lot better than this.”
Suddenly, all the hair on the back of Steve's neck stood straight up as the air around him sparkled with electricity. He immediately slammed his cowl onto his head and leapt in front of the prince, raising his shield just in time to blunt the force of the explosion that tore through the trailer like it was nothing more than tinfoil.
There was a pause before Anthony answered. "While I'm sure the Air Corps leadership wouldn't mind that, I'm afraid that the actual reason is still classified. Sorry."
From the Control Room, Tony tapped his fingers on his data pad as he watched the three aircraft fire up their engines and slowly roll out of the hangar, switching on the brand-new viewscreens Phillips had ordered installed in the Control Room to monitor the runway and takeoff points once they were out of sight.
After filling a paper bag with two of just about everything, Steve made his way in the direction of the X-302 hangar, where Tony's office was only about a hundred or so paces away. His heart started to thud as he rounded the corner and saw the strip of light under Tony's door, wondering if Tony had been able to break away from work and see Peter that afternoon. Steve had asked Colonel Phillips to try and ensure that Tony was able to leave on time to visit Peter at least a couple times per week, and Steve had already noticed a change in both Tony and Peter because of it. Peter especially looked better than he had in days when Steve had visited him the day before, and he'd noticed that Tony seemed to be a bit less stressed as well.
"But I already did!" whined her brother, holding up his soaking wet hands that were still covered in smudges of dirt. "See?"
Steve tilted his head, chuckling as he ran his fingertip along the lid of his cup. "Well, I've kinda been what Peter might call a hobbit this morning."
"Yeah, yeah, it's always tomorrow lately, isn't it," grumbled Bucky. "One of these days I'm gonna hold you to it."
“Was that your father?” Steve asked once he’d pocketed his phone.  He’d sat back down on his stool while Peter was on the phone, lowering himself down onto it like he was afraid it was going to scoot itself out from underneath him.
He trailed off as Dad and Papa looked at each other again, their eyebrows moving in their silent communication method that was equal parts amazing and infuriating to watch.
"Oh, I won't!" Peter exclaimed, so much so that it triggered a brief coughing fit. He couldn't imagine that in the so-called "new" Langara that officers would still be punished by the questionable actions of their significant others, but he supposed it was better to be safe than sorry.
"Sweetheart, stop. You're so much stronger than you think," Steve said, gently but firmly. He cradled Tony's beautiful face in his hands, pressing soft kisses to his forehead, nose, and finally his lips before pulling back to meet his eyes. "I love you, Tony. I love you with all of my heart and soul and everything in me, and no matter what happens—"
But since God or fate or whoever’s turn it had been to roll the cosmic dice that day had somehow deemed Tony worthy of becoming Peter’s father, then Tony was going to make sure that his precious son had everything that Tony could possibly give him.
Steve's smile grew wider as his eyes scanned the length of Tony's body, his fingers ghosting down Tony's side until he reached underneath him to press their hips together. Tony moaned as his legs instinctively wrapped around Steve's waist, craving more of his touch, more of his taste, more of his scent.
Peter tapped the tip of his pen against the book, his lips pressed tightly together. No wonder Papa refused to get help for the nightmares that plagued him almost every night. He tried so hard to hide them from Peter, but like Dad, Papa often discounted—or simply forgot—how well Peter could hear now, especially in the middle of the night when there wasn't anything else happening in the penthouse. And while his dads' bedroom could be soundproofed—thank
"No, I'm good," said Tony, which was true. Before he'd started dating Steve his meals—if one could even call them that—had consisted mainly of whatever Rhodey brought him on any given day. Tony had always made sure to keep the house stocked with food for Peter, even spending the extra credits for delivery since he usually couldn't leave the base in time to do the shopping himself. Howard had always been useless, only venturing out to the store when he needed to replace his bottles of whisky, but since Peter had been in the hospital Tony hadn't thought too much about groceries.
It was amusing, Tony thought as he made his way towards Peter's bedroom, finding Steve sitting in the armchair while Peter brushed his teeth. There was a time when he would've been appalled at the thought of not being in New York City on New Years Eve. Not that Tony had ever gone out to Times Square or anything, but hosting a hot party at the Four Seasons that ended with a girl—or guy—or two inside his lavish suite once all was said and done… well, that's what was typical for Tony Stark back in the day. Complete with his face plastered across the front page of every gossip paper and magazine in print.
"I just did," answered Steve. He reached for Tony's hand, relieved that he didn't try to pull away. "Please, sweetheart, we need to talk about this. These dreams you're having are upsetting you, and I'm not the only one who's noticed. Peter's worried about you too."
Steve waved her off with a nod before sitting down at the workstation over in the far corner, hoping it would help prevent him from being interrupted. He didn't really feel like answering anyone's curious questions at the moment.
"Well, yeah, I know that," muttered Peter. "And mine works great, by the way, so if you think about it, it's kinda your fault that I'm here."
"Please pardon the reaction from my colleagues, Captain," said Davis. "I'm sure you can understand the unusualness of your situation."
The general nodded, letting out a heavy sigh. "Just getting the Emergency Broadcast System back up and running has been huge, so please extend my deepest thanks to Dr Banner and Colonel Rhodes the next time you see them."
"God, I hate you," Bucky muttered, smirking when Sam dropped his gaze to his plate, his lips pursing into a soft smile. Peter had explained to Steve that Sam and Bucky's 'I hate yous' were usually code for 'I love you', something that Steve didn't quite understand, but still found amusing.
"Well, for a girl we're gonna go with Aisling," Joseph answered, only a bit sheepishly as he removed his mask, allowing it to dangle off to the side. "And if it's a boy, he'll be called Steven."
“Probably more than you might suspect, Tony,” Steve murmured.  He knew Tony was pretty concerned how this whole shakedown was going to affect company morale, but the way Steve saw it, knowing for certain that someone was no longer working for a war criminal would certainly do nothing but increase morale, wouldn’t it?  Even more so since Tony had at least a ten-item list of new projects he was going to launch almost as soon as the arrest was made.
Rummaging around in a cabinet, Nebula emerged with a foil packet, ripping it open to reveal a sort of trail-mix-like something-or-other that both looked and smelled like cat food, or what Tony would imagine cat food would look and smell like. He tried to hide his grimace as he took the packet, pouring a small amount into his palm.
"Stand back, Tony!" Clint ordered just before he fired the arrow, landing it directly into one of the splits left behind from the first. Tony braced himself as it exploded, a hair-raising
Which Steve had every intention of doing so, starting with the first Avengers training session in the newly remodelled training centre.
As soon as Gwen exited the room, Steve let out a sigh and glanced down at Tony, nearly jumping out of his chair when saw that Tony was awake, his sleep-dulled brown eyes staring straight up at him.
But Quill just shrugged as he walked through the damaged hull of the ship, pulling a yellow device from his pocket once he got outside. "What the hell happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis, and the gravitational pull is all over the place."
Tony was just about to point out that coffee was a perfectly acceptable alternative to lunch when Steve chuckled, giving him a knowing look.
"Oh really?" asked Steve as he popped the button on Tony's pants, tugging them and his underwear off and onto the floor. He ran his hands up Tony's lean, muscular legs up to his thighs, watching as they quivered under his touch. "Well if that's the case, then why doesn't my gorgeous fella tell me what he wants, and I'll see what I can do?"
But Tony knew the truth then just like he knows it now.  Obadiah was more afraid of a tiny, helpless baby than of the thousands of guns and rifles and rockets that he and Howard built in their weapons’ factories.  He was afraid because he knew that as Peter grew, it meant he’d have to figure out how to control him when he already had his hands full with keeping Tony at an arm’s length.  Tony had suspected for a few years that Obadiah was up to something that was less-than-copacetic, but was never able to prove it.  Howard tossing Tony and Peter out of the company surely did nothing to quell those suspicions.
Tony scowled. "And why not? If you think he knows something then I would think you'd have every right to ask him—"
Never see his head bent together with Tony as they worked on one of their projects together, tinkering with this or that, or some other thing.
"Yep. Sure looks that way, buddy." The whole Giant-Man thing was pretty damn cool, Tony had to admit.
"Yes, I do," Green Lady said evenly, reaching for Blaster Guy's blaster. "So why don't we all take a deep breath, and back off."
"Listen to me, Птер. You are stronger than them. You are the strongest person they have ever seen, and you can fight this! Ты сильнее их! Now, show them!"
"Tony, two choppers just landed not too far from the main entrance," said Natasha. "Clint's heading out there now."
, it had said.  And how convenient indeed that it had already been seconded by three of the nine Stark Industries Board of Directors.
Not that it likely mattered much. By his calculations, the ship had only about twenty-four hours worth of life support left. He could maybe extend that a bit if he happened to hold his breath every now and then, but after that…
Unlocking their door, Tony pushes it open so Peter can step in ahead of him.  After reminding him to take his wet swimming suit and towel out of his bag and hang them up, he shoos Peter off to the shower, then heads directly for the kitchen, and the coffeemaker that’s calling his name.
team—is expected to arrive in Sokovia in a few days’ time.  February 5th, 2019.  General West sends a follow-up communique indicating a slight change in orders.  February 9th, 2019.  My team arrives in Sokovia.  February—”
“Comes with the territory, bud, you know that already,” Tony said with a smirk.  “Have a good day.  I love you.”
"Shh!" Steve said as he reached for a sandwich, biting off nearly half of it in a single bite. "That's still a secret, Buck!"
The grocery store was packed when they arrived, not too surprisingly since it was close to dinnertime. After picking up what they would need for the linguine dish Peter was planning to make, they headed over to the freezer section to check out the desserts. Peter was examining the selection of ice cream bars when Gwen suddenly burst out laughing from two doors down, pointing to the Ben and Jerry's section.
Steve chuckled, his lips now trailing down to meet his fingers, still trailing back and forth across the sensitive skin of Tony's waist.
For a moment everything went white, and Steve briefly wondered if he had been transported somewhere else when the light suddenly disappeared, as quickly as it came.
"Oh, that's wonderful, Peter," Steve forced past the rock in his throat. "Um… but I still have to get going, okay?"
Tony gasps, slapping his palm to his chest in overly dramatic fashion.  “Oh, that’s it,” he says.  “You aimed right for the heart with that one, bud.”
Tony dropped to his knees next to the cot, trying to ignore the way the cat was glaring bullets at him.  “Steve, honey, I am so sorry!  I messed up and I messed up bad.  I didn't—I never should’ve—that was so shitty of me, and I’m—look, Steve, Pete and I, we’ve been worried sick about you all weekend, so if you could—if you don't mind, um… I’m gonna just touch you on your shoulder here, okay?”
"Well, it kinda was, when you think about it," Peter said with a shrug. "I mean, Papa's serum still hasn't ever been exactly replicated, and whatever they gave you was—"
"I'm gonna spend the rest of my life being good to you, sweetheart," Steve said. "And that's a promise."
And Peter had long since suspected that Obie was padding the books somehow too.  Even if he’d never found any concrete evidence to back his suspicions.
"So," he said as he nuzzled the soft skin on the back of Gwen's neck. "Did you know that no one born blind has ever developed schizophrenia?"
"That's what Phillips said," replied Steve. "And I don't think he'd be joking about something like that."
"Yes," Papa said grimly. He let out a heavy sigh, leaning against the counter. "Kinda puts things into perspective a bit, doesn't it?"
"All right, but that still doesn't answer my question," said Steve. "Is there any of the serum still left?"
"I'm just gonna wear something that I'd wear to one of our Decathlon competitions," said Gwen. "We're only going to a matinee, so there'll be people there in jeans and stuff."
The hard jab of Ned's index finger poking into Peter's arm made him jump, and he reluctantly returned to reality to find Ned holding a potato chip and glaring at him over his lunch tray.
Tony gave a quick nod. "I build them into each of the Avengers' uniforms, so if Pete built himself a suit he probably put one of 'em in there."
"And Mr Stacy will be there too, don't forget," Peter said. "I'm sure he'll be keeping his eyes open."
“Oh.  Uh huh,” Peter said, not without a touch of melancholy.  He crumpled up his chip bag and slid off the stool, picking up his backpack.  Then he stopped short, glancing between Steve and Tony like he was contemplating something.
"Well, then I know they both appreciated it," Steve answered. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony's temple then took his hand, interlacing their fingers. "Sam and I discussed my plans for the raids today on our run, and I'd like to go over them with you once Peter goes to bed, is that okay?"
Sucking in a deep, lung-searing breath, Steve continued on, holding his shield at chest-height as he scanned his surroundings, listening intently for more of the telltale buzzing sounds.  When no more appeared after a hundred metres or so, he checked his compass again, noting that he was still over ten kilometres away from the bunker’s location.
“It’s the humidity in the air,” Steve murmurs.  “Cold, dry air triggers the inflammatory response, but—”
"All right, all right. Let's just get Tony here so we can start," Steve said as he pulled out his phone. "JARVIS?"
Arriving at their favourite coffee shop, Steve made pleasant small talk with the barista as she prepared their drinks and chocolate croissants, then led Tony over to their usual table in the corner, right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out onto the bustling street.
"You're implying that we will be at some point?" Tony asked, incredulous. "You know what, nevermind. Can you—can you just come down here, Pete? Papa's gonna be leaving soon, and you need to be getting to bed."
Nebula shrugged. "Because following the Chitauri's failed invasion, Thanos saw the Avengers as a true threat to his plan."
Tony's arm tightened across Steve's waist, his fingers slipping underneath the hem of his t-shirt to ghost across his skin, causing him to shiver.
"Yeah? And what is it?" asked Tony. He didn't really feel like tracking down a pair of his glasses at the moment.
"And we're done too, Cap, so we can be wheels up whenever you guys are ready," Natasha said over the comm. She, Clint, and Sam had been scouring the rest of the bunker for the better part of the night, searching for any further clues as to what HYDRA had been up to.
"Goddamnit, JARVIS, what the hell's taking so long!" Tony snapped just as his frozen ears picked up the sound of his suit flying towards them, followed by the tell-tale
The little boy narrowed his eyes, glancing around Gwen at Peter's scattered schoolbooks and unzipped backpack. "Yeah, sure," he said. "Is that why your cheeks are all pink too?"
“Good afternoon, Mr Stark,” he says as he shakes Dad’s hand, who seems to be just as awestruck as Peter—and maybe even a tiny bit more?  “And you must be Peter?”
And then Schmidt turns his back on Steve and lifts himself out of the pool, shaking his head and muttering as the announcer comes over the loudspeakers to announce the winners.
"Fine," Tony huffed. "I'll make the calls as soon as we're done here. Maybe we can even get in to see Smythe too."
"Let's go, Mr Stark," the officer said, tugging on Howard's arm. Howard stumbled as his foot caught on one of Tony's many contraptions that littered the porch area of their house, wishing for nothing more than to be able to cover his ears against his son's panicked screams.
"Hey, you two," he said, rolling his eyes when he saw that Dad wasn't quite ready yet. "You are still thinking about getting married this afternoon, aren't ya, Tones? Does that still fit into your schedule?"
They celebrated with plenty of pizza, Dr Pepper, and obnoxious music once everyone was safely back in the Stark Industries building. Tony hung back from most of the festivities, trying to keep an eye on Peter without making it seem too obvious. For his part, Peter did pretty well, managing to maintain his brave face for almost an hour before Tony noticed Gwen Stacy taking him by the hand and exiting the boisterous room, heading down a quieter hallway where Peter immediately started to cry.
"Holy shit, I can't even believe you," Tony whispered, pressing his lips to Peter's ice-cold palm. Then he looked his father straight in the eye, his jaw so tight he could hear his teeth grinding. "You are never to come near him again, you understand? Not. Ever. Again!"
"One of them should be an FBI transport chopper," said George Stacy. "I've already made arrangements for a secured holding facility in Atlanta until we can figure out what to do with the prisoners."
"Try and sleep now, bud," Dad murmured as he kissed Peter's forehead. "You'll feel better in the morning."
Unfortunately, he hadn't found all that much since then, and there weren't all that many files left to decrypt. Auntie Nat had uncovered some more at a few of the bunkers they had raided, but so far none of them had panned out either.
"Got it," said Peter as he finished tapping the cinnamon into the mug. "And your ma used to make you this when you were little?"
"Huh?" Dad croaked, his eyes flicking rapidly between Peter, Blaster Guy, and Green Lady. "I never said—?"
"And I miss him," said Steve. "We're gonna be heading out in about fifteen minutes, okay? I'll see you soon."
"Let's not do this again anytime soon, yeah?" he said as Steve kissed the top of his head. "In fact, I'd really prefer to never have to do it again. Like, ever."
"Sorry buddy, I wasn't trying to wake you up," he murmured, guilt shadowing his eyes. "I was just gonna kiss you goodbye."
"Captain Rogers, I'm afraid that I must interrupt," Dr Strange cut in. "We need your help, you and the rest of your team, and there is no time to waste."
"No, it's not," Peter agreed. "And that's why we're gonna change it. But first you need to go and call Uncle Sam, okay?"
"Get Captain Rogers in the water right now, Tony," Helen commanded without even looking up. "How long was he submerged?"
“The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield,” JARVIS answers.  “This technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base that we’ve taken.”
Dr Cho nodded as she draped her stethoscope around her neck. "As long as there are no further signs of collapse, I'll be able to take out the chest tube later today," she said. "And then once that's out—"
The headrush that Steve gets as the crowd erupts into cheers is like none that he's ever felt before.  A huge smile splits his face as he raises his hands to wave at the adoring fans, many waving American flags as they chant his name.
And if he has his way, he’ll be doing it with Tony by his side.  Which is why, thirty minutes later when they’re both safely back on the Quinjet and tucked under warming blankets with IV fluids flowing into their veins, Steve extends his hand towards Tony, gasping in relief when Tony doesn’t hesitate to take it.
Mr O'Carl said as they exited the store, with Ma carrying her brown paper sack filled to the brim with what food and other supplies they could afford for the next week.
"Grandpa!" Tony hissed, his left hand clenching into a fist. "According to the military leaders Grandpa doesn't even exist anymore,
"Well, you're wrong," Steve stated, smiling slightly at Tony's confused look. "Or, should I say, you're wrong about the most important part of that statement." He leaned forward, pressing a quick but firm kiss to Tony's lips. "I was never happy, Tony. Yeah, I guess I was a bit of the hotshot pilot that you mentioned, and I know that I enjoyed it, but I would not have called myself happy because I really wasn't. I was just kind of… existing. I had decided long ago to close myself off to any kind of relationship that could lead to marriage and family, because I was too afraid that if I got those things and then lost them again, it would destroy me."
"All the time, little guy," Steve said fondly. "Cinnamon's actually good for a lot of things. It helps keep bugs away, it's good for upset stomachs, and it's great for opening up your airways."
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  Questions, theories, I love them all! 💗
name is on that list, Tony," Steve insisted. "So I don't care if it's personal or not to them, it is to
"And you'll be working on your newest painting while I work on some newfangled thing for one of Pete's kids," Tony added. He sucked in a shaky breath as a single tear trailed from the corner of his eye. "Steve, I want that. I want that so much."
Dad hugged Peter even tighter, planting a kiss on the top of his head. "If you're sure that you won't be too scared, then I guess you can go. I'll make sure that Happy's got the guards in place."
"You're welcome, Peter," Steve said as he patted Peter's back, kissing his cheek before he released him. "So, how's it been going in here?"
Steve stumbled backwards, trying to scream, but with no air in his lungs it only came out as a sort of choked gasp as he stared at his husband, his beloved fella, the man he had sworn to love, honour, and protect as long as he should live.
that there are actual people out there who can afford to spend half a million dollars on a car that’s not only completely impractical but also begging to get scratched up—or worse—on the New York streets, Peter is still glad that whoever these rich people are, they know that Dad’s the best person to take care of their fancy, rich-people cars.
"That you are," said Ma. She nodded in the direction of Steve's childhood bedroom. "Bucky and Sam got him all set up in there."
"Well, then maybe he won't come here after all," said Quill. "Asshole's only interested in finding the stones."
"Nope, we're not going there," Tony said, covering Steve's lips with his fingers. "You know you don't have to be sorry. Well, maybe for falling flat on your face 'cause you were too stubborn to wake me up, but… not for the rest of it. You were a prisoner of war, honey, and I'm just relieved that Pete was able to find you."
"Oh, sure," Steve said. He stepped back, still holding onto Peter's hand as Sharon listened to his heart and lungs and checked his pulse, smiling and patting his shoulder once she was finished.
"Thank you," Steve answered as he gave Peter's hand a quick squeeze, then placed it carefully under his blanket and turned to Bruce. "But whoever that is out there, he doesn't come within five metres of Peter, understand? Code green?"
When the glass was finally empty Peter laid back, breathing in as he tried to get his bearings. He had awoken so suddenly that for a moment he'd forgotten where he was, and who he was with.
"Yes, Spider-Man," Peter answered, clearing his throat. "If somewhere down the line this Spider-Man happened to officially join the Avengers, would your opinion of him change?"
"Yeah, 'cause living in that Tower with a bunch of superheroes has to be just exhausting, right, little prince?" Flash sneered as he slid into his chair behind Peter. "Give me a break. It's not like they're making you scrub the floors like freaking Cinderella or something."
"And again, Pym doesn't get a choice in the matter," Tony said. "I'm sure he's got plenty more of 'em at that house of his."
Until he did.  And as it stands, Tony’s had absolutely no contact with either Howard or Obadiah since that day.
"Oh, of course, Colonel," said Thor, clearing his throat. "Mind you, I will be relaying the story as it was told to me hundreds of years ago. By my mother."
Fidgeting again in his chair, Steve tipped his head to the side, caressing the back of Tony's hand with his thumb. Tony's skin, which had been very dry and crepey when he first returned, was finally starting to regain its usual softer, supple feel, which hopefully meant that his severe dehydration was starting to correct.
"Yes," Natasha said with a somber nod. "That was actually the first thing he did once we confirmed that no one was missing."
"You doing okay, bud?" asked Dad. He looked exhausted too, with deep purple circles under his eyes. Peter highly doubted he and Papa had been getting much sleep lately.
"So, did you hear about the guy in Japan who took DNA from luminous jellyfish and inserted it into other animals?"
"Probably 'cause he doesn't know," Tony said. He stepped back as one of the SHIELD guards unlocked Lang's cell, leading the three of them into a nearby interrogation room. Once they were settled, Steve leaned forward, his hands folded in front of him.
"I'm pretty sure neither of those choices are very good ones, Buck," said Steve, wincing as the Mets batter swung and missed for strike three. He gestured towards the scoreboard, displaying the rather embarrassing score of 8-3 in favour of the Washington Nationals. Sam, having been a resident of the D.C. area for several years, was of course rooting for the Nationals, and hadn't let up on his needling ever since the third Washington batter launched a ball over the left-field fence with a runner on second in the top of the first inning.
A bolt of pain shot across Tony's fingers, and he flinched, slowly flexing open his clenched fist as his wedding ring caught a beam of the dim sunlight reflecting off of Titan's surface.
Steve and Tony watched them go, with Steve wearing a rather bemused expression that Tony knew mirrored his own. "Been good for Pete having Thor around lately," he said. "Even if he can't understand why we don't use ravens as a method of communication."
Too choked up to speak, Tony merely nodded, covering Steve's hand with his own as he closed his eyes. Tony knew better than to believe in promises, especially promises that were impossible to keep. But Steve's solemn vow that they were going to get through this—whatever
Steve pursed his lips, blinking more sweat from his eyes as he tried to suck in a deep breath. His cockpit was so hot he felt like he was literally melting inside his flight suit, and the storm raging inside his mind wasn't helping.
That was all Tony had ever wanted. For his sweet, beloved boy to look at him like he loved him, and was proud of him.
“Okay, honey, we’re pretty much set,” Dad said as he tapped a few final commands into his keyboard.  “Last call for potty breaks, snack breaks, sleeping breaks, running breaks, or—”
"And why is that, Colonel?" he demanded, riding a sudden surge of either bravery or stupidity, he wasn't quite sure. "What's in those files that they don't want me to know?"
They nearly tripped over each other in their mad scramble to escape the lounge chair, with Steve grabbing onto Tony's waist once they were upright, practically carrying him inside the villa to their bedroom. As soon as the door was closed and locked behind them he turned towards Tony, backing him up against the wall.
As long as they both understood what they meant, Steve supposed it didn't matter how they said it. He just far preferred to say the words outright. And often.
Steve moaned against Tony's shoulder as he started with gentle rocks of his hips. "Oh mo grá, braitheann tú chomh maith! Chomh fucking maith!"
"You don't need to explain yourself to me, honey, you know that." He brushed his lips across Steve's, slipping his tongue inside Steve's mouth as he rolled his hips up again, pleasure shooting through his body like a rocket as he guided Steve's hand to his ass. "Now, get me ready already."
“Oh, come on, Pete!” Tony says, starting to lose his patience.  “Isn’t this the kind of something that I, as the parent, should be asking you,
of a bat connecting with a baseball briefly drew Tony's attention, and he watched as the ball sailed over the left field fence, the various cadets all whooping and yelling as they reveled in the batter's prowess.
"Yes, I'm sure you did." Papa finished spreading the shredded cheese across the first pizza, popping a few pieces into his mouth. "Now, let's get these pizzas into the ovens before Thor ends up eating our entire supply of peanut butter, okay?"
"Actually, it does," Steve answered, not without a hint of regret. "It's time for me to go for my run."
Thankfully, he didn't have to wait long, as it was only a couple of minutes later that another man stepped out from a nearby clump of bushes and approached the van. Peter watched as he and the sellers examined the various weapons, discussing firepower and pricing, until one of the sellers picked up a handgun and fired it right over the top of the overpass, not too far from where Peter was sitting. Peter jumped up at the booming sound, which reminded him of one of Dad's repulsors times about a million, immediately firing a web towards the weapon and yanking it right out of the man's hand.
"It'd just be for the summer, Peter," Gwen said, as if she'd read his mind. "If I got it, which is still a pretty big if, I'd leave for England three days after the end of school and get back about three or four days before our senior year starts up."
Peter shrugged as he sat down by the huge windows that overlooked the arena, popping a meatball into his mouth. "Dad likes to joke that I have hollow bones. You should see our grocery carts when Papa and I go to the store."
"Yes," Steve said. He tapped his compass, allowing his nanite quantum suit to flow back inside, and offered Tony his arm, which he eagerly took.
The look that Tony shot him, so full of anguish and self-loathing, was almost enough to cause Steve's heart to shatter right there in his chest, like a piece of porcelain dropped onto a concrete floor. He audibly gulped, his back as straight as an iron rod as he forced his swirling emotions back down into the pit of his belly, where they could continue their festering.
“Ahh, yeah?  So?” Tony says, his cheeks no doubt the colour of Mags’s marinara sauce.  “I’m allowed to notice when a guy’s got a particularly nice set of forearms, aren’t I?”
With an audible gulp, Steve gave a nod, pressing one final kiss to Tony's lips before climbing onto the motorcycle, heat tearing through his chest as Tony climbed up behind him and wrapped his arms around him.
Steve stood next to the life-sized simulator cockpit located in the far back section of the hangar, trying very hard to ignore Bucky's impatiently drumming fingertips on the hull of his own simulator. Colonel Phillips had informed their team just the previous day that since Anthony Stark had finished uploading and testing the new space-travel programs, their usual patrol schedules were being altered to reflect a four-hour simulator session every third day, with the option to stretch the session to six hours if Anthony deemed it necessary.
"Ah, not well, according to Wong," said Bruce. "In fact, it almost resulted in the demise of our entire realm, but that's kinda getting off point a bit."
Until that awful day when it finally hit Tony that Steve was suffering too, just as much as Tony. He had just been better at hiding it.
"Right, but still. They may have had some of HYDRA's resources at their disposal, but for them it was personal. This," and he swept his hand around the lab, "isn't. This is just another HYDRA research lab, albeit one that's very large and very high-tech and apparently that came with a list of enhanced individuals."
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he pondered a couple different options in his mind, finally turning to Tony.
"Well, we've already seen that HYDRA can mess with people's memories, right?" said Clint. "With that drug?"
Uncle Bucky thought for a moment. "Okay, that makes sense. But then if it was there the whole time, how would your dad have missed it? He doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would miss something like that."
If Tony’s making noise, then that must mean he’s alive.  And if he’s alive, then Steve must still be alive too, which means that what he heard might actually be real and not just inside his head.
And, if Peter was able to take care of this on his own, maybe it would help Papa and Dad be just a little less anxious about everything.
“Who are you?” he asked in his Captain’s voice, or at least what was passing for his Captain’s voice when his mouth felt like it had been coated with sand and his tongue weighed as much as the
"That's my boy," Tony said proudly. "So you think we're ready to start running some tests on the channeling program?"
"Aw, yeah!" Tony heard Rocket, the goofy raccoon, exclaim from the ground. "Now that's what I call an entrance!"
"Oh, just go ahead and kiss already, will ya?" said the colonel. "'Cause I'm sure as hell not gonna kiss you."
He waited until Bucky gave a nod. Steve had asked Tony before he'd left for his run to be extra careful with anything that might trigger memories of Bucky's torture and captivity at the hands of HYDRA. Unfortunately, since Bucky's memories were all messed up due to Zola butchering his brain way back when he was first converted, not even Bucky was aware of everything that he had been through, and Tony was in no mood to find something new out now.
"Yes, yes, but he was victorious in his slashing," said Uncle Thor, raising his beer bottle. "Therefore he must be celebrated!"
Weapons that were then used to target U.S. Army Special Forces units.  Including the unit that Steve used to lead.
The truth was, the blaring alarm clock aside, Tony had felt none of the usual awkwardness he'd always had when disentangling after sex, none of the panic he'd always felt when anyone had tried to get too close to him in the past, and, despite the fact that Steve was built like a literal god, none of the self-consciousness that he'd expected to feel during their sexual activities. While Tony knew that he wasn't exactly anything to sneeze at physically, he also knew there was no way he could compare to someone like Steve. But either Steve hadn't noticed or just didn't care, because over the course of their three lovemaking sessions during the night, Steve had showered Tony with more affection and passion than Tony had ever experienced ever in his life. Tony had always thought that he was a generous lover, but for someone who'd been as inexperienced as Steve had said he was, he was definitely a quick learner.
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Which means as of 1354 hours yesterday, I'm technically a civilian," said Bucky. "They even told me that they already cleaned out my room, said I could pick up my belongings once I got out." He glanced up at Sam. "Good thing I had most of my stuff at Sam's, or who the hell knows where it would've ended up."
Steve had been so distraught with guilt the previous night that it had nearly crushed him, the weight of it squeezing all the air from his lungs until he was gasping for breath. Tony had done his best to soothe him, holding him so he could hear his heart beating beneath the faint scar marking his chest. Tony had confessed to Steve a few times that he'd always hated his scar, believing it to be hideously ugly, a loathing that only grew after Peter's diagnosis.
Peter didn't have much time left, which meant that none of them did. Project Phoenix needed to find its wings soon, before the whole entire thing just burned up, leaving nothing behind but ashes.
"Apparently Secretary Pierce got there first," said Bruce. "Anyway, we're assuming that both Gill and Bench were taken to that Mongolian base, and—"
Peter pulled back, his lower lip shaking. "One of the files that I decoded tonight, it was talking about the same kind of technology that the old SHIELD helicarriers had, the retro-reflective panels? Well, I thought that kind of tech could only be used for planes and other stuff that can fly, but now—now it seems like HYDRA's figured out how to use it to cloak a building, and—"
"With all due respect, Your Highness, I disagree," Steve rasped, groaning as he hoisted himself up. "Thor—?"
"I just got one of those damn tickles in my throat, honey. It's nothing," Tony muttered as he gulped down another drink of water. "And I didn't sleep down in D.C. 'cause you weren't with me. And 'cause Senator Stern is a first-rate asshole."
"Ahh, sort of," answered Steve. "He was more like our civilian colleague. I lead a team called the Avengers, and Fury works with us."
"That's right. And you love me for it," said Steve. "And because of that, I'm going to be setting some rules, all right? First, you're gonna let me take care of you until JARVIS and I both say you're completely better, is that understood?" He raised his hand, cutting off Tony's attempted protest. "No arguing, sweetheart."
"Hey, hey, hey, little guy, it's okay. I've got you," Steve said as he attempted to grab onto their flailing son. Tony cringed as Peter managed to twist out of Steve's grasp and grab onto his IV needle, ripping it right out of his arm and causing blood to spurt from the open wound, dripping down his arm and onto the bed.
“Mmm,” mutters Steve as he fiddles with a loose corner of the apple juice label.  Natasha is right that he could use the money.  Even a couple hundred or so extra dollars a month would go a long way to paying down his mountain of debt.
"Yes. It's hard to maintain a working civilian government when you're constantly giving in to the military. From what I was able to learn from my father, even the president's own top general tried to advise him against certain things, but he either wouldn't or couldn't listen."
"No, it's not," agreed Steve, his tone suggesting that he suspected what Tony was implying and did not like it. "Which means our objective is still to find Thanos and take him out."
Steve leaned back in his chair, draping his arm across Tony's shoulders as his teammates continued their banter. This was what being in the Air Corps was supposed to be like. This was the type of camaraderie that he craved. An entire team of people all willing to do something very difficult and dangerous just because it was the right thing to do.
"As long as they don't figure out where he's hidden his arrows," Natasha answered, barely hiding her smirk. "Or ask him for help with their math homework."
Rhodey had also informed Tony that he’d recently started seeing someone, a former Air Force test pilot who was now an FBI agent.  That little tidbit had launched an entire slew of ideas on how Tony might be able to solve his issues with Obie, but he couldn't afford to be thinking about that now.  He had to get to Steve first.
“That very well may be the case, Master Peter,” JARVIS said gently.  “However, I am afraid that I am finding nothing in that document that explicitly connects Mr Stane with the pseudonym Iron Monger.”
"Dad?" Peter said, sounding surprised and more than a bit concerned. "Are you okay? You never call me this early?"
"I'm afraid that's unlikely, Doctor," answered JARVIS. "We are already at over one hundred and fifty percent of capacity. Any more and we will compromise the flight power of the armour."
"Oh, nothing, just making sure," Peter said with a rapid shake of his head. "Um… there's a red-haired girl, her name's Wanda, and she was being held captive here too. She's the one who got me out of my cell, and she told me that once she found where they were keeping her brother, she was gonna head down to get Papa out."
He was there, and then he wasn't, yanked down over the precipice by the deep, loud moan that rumbled up from Steve's chest as they both came all over Tony's stomach. For a moment it was as though Tony forgot how to breathe at the sheer beauty of Steve's face staring down at him in the pale, bluish light of their bedroom, his hair all mussed up and his lips kiss-swollen.
"Thor, now!" Steve nearly choked as Thor immediately launched his axe towards Thanos, aiming it directly for the giant brute's neck.
But the song ended all too soon, and Peter reluctantly released Gwen's waist, trailing his fingers down her arm to squeeze her hand. It was time.
“Uh huh, it was okay,” Peter answered, frowning.  “But it sure doesn’t look like yours was very good.  What happened?”
Mopping his eyes on his soaked-through t-shirt, Tony pushed himself up to a sitting position.  His bleary-eyed glancing about eventually fell onto his monitor, and the schematic of the new defibrillator machine he had been working on.  After the incredible success of the pharmaceutical printers, Tony had, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical scientists, decided to focus next on developing a new type of defibrillator that didn't require a separate power source.  Expanding on a technology that he had discovered in some of Howard’s old files, Tony was working on developing an innovative power source that theoretically could power a device the size of a portable defibrillator for about fifty years.
"That's just 'cause you got stuck with a name like Tomis," said Chester, followed by one of his characteristically loud guffaws that was thankfully muffled by the underlying buzz of the X-101's engines. "That'd be enough to make anyone wish they had more time to think of something."
"It does not seem like he wants to do that," said Mantis. "Maybe because he knows we will lose if we—"
Steve blushed so hard that the tips of his ears turned pink.  “Ah, yes sir,” he said.  “Reading is one of the best ways to keep up with things.”
"Uh huh." Peter huffed out a sharp breath, glancing at his clock. "Well, I guess we better get going."
"You deserve it all, sweetheart," Steve said as he captured Tony's lips in a hot, messy kiss. "Now, come for me!"
"I want you to ride me," Steve said, so bluntly that Tony froze in place, his eyes nearly bulging from his head. They had been together for four years, married for two and a half, and for how often they were intimate—which was a
"Oh, you have no idea," scoffed Grandma. "Oh, but my parents absolutely loved him. Matthew was a bit older than me, already a Lieutenant Colonel by the time he tried to court me, and so smooth and charming that he had my mother practically eating out of his hand after only one meeting." She scowled, waving a dismissive hand. "And he was indeed very charming, and an absolute master at telling people what he believed they wanted to hear. But there was something about him that just… unnerved me. Something… sinister."
"Okay, I think I'm ready," Peter said, carefully clutching his perfectly-wrapped bundle of gifts. "We're supposed to pick Gwen up at the police station now."
Tony silenced him with another kiss. It was on the tip of his tongue to say something funny, but he held back. Despite what they had found at the Mongolian bunker and how worried Steve was about it, at the moment he seemed completely relaxed, and Tony wasn't about to ruin it with one of his ill-timed snarky remarks.
"Mr Stark's body temperature is currently thirty-eight point eight Celsius, Captain," answered JARVIS. "Heart rate is one hundred and ten beats per minute, respiratory rate is twenty-two breaths per minute. All three are elevated."
"Which means we have even less than that to find these guys," answered Steve. "All right. Sam, pull Redwing back, I don't want to give them any warning. Bucky, let me know as soon as you're in position. Nat and Thor, keep as close as you can without putting yourselves at unnecessary risk. Do not, I repeat, do
"Wakanda is a very technologically advanced country," Steve added. "Which means that they have means of defending themselves that we currently don't."
smile of his that Tony absolutely adored. It was times like this when he really wished that he could paint or draw even a fraction as well as Steve could. Steve had drawn and painted countless pictures and portraits of Tony, and of Peter as well, and it just wasn't fair that he couldn't do the same for Steve.
"Shh, honey," Tony murmured as he stroked Steve's hair, matted and covered with grime. "Pete's with Bucky and Sam. They're taking care of him so Helen and I can take care of you, okay?"
Pursing his lips, Tony refilled his coffee cup and headed back to the lab, pulling up the MAUDE schematic.
"You feel so incredible," he rasped in Tony's ear as he began to move, his thrusts shallow and easy. "You're all around me,
Steve truly was the most beautiful man that Tony had ever seen, and he was already counting down the minutes until he could drag him back inside and have his way with him.
"Yeah, I guess it is." Peter gave her hand a final squeeze before gathering up his backpack. "I'll see you tomorrow, okay?"
All the better for Steve to ask the two most important questions he had ever asked in his entire life.
As soon as they exited Peter's room, Steve took Tony's hand, trying to guide him back down the hall to their bedroom.
For a moment everything went so hot and blindingly white that Tony honestly believed that he'd been transported to some kind of afterlife. It wasn't until Steve tucked him against his sweat-glistened chest that he realised they had both come within seconds of each other, their hearts beating in tandem as Steve's hands splayed across Tony's back, holding him as close as he dared.
"Okay, Mr Toomes said whatever was happening was happening about a half a kilometre from here," he said as he looked up, cursing the lack of skyscrapers to swing on. Apparently no buildings taller than two stories were allowed in that particular suburb, so he was just going to have to run there. "JARVIS, can you give me the most likely location around here for something illegal to be happening? Radius is about half a kilometre."
He broke off then, his lower lip shaking. "I can't—I can't go through that again, Steve, and neither can Pete. We just
"Redwing's just about done with his sweep," Steve answered, watching as various blinking green dots appeared across the screen, each indicating a perimeter guard for the base. Despite the massive size of the structure and surrounding outposts, which were easily twice the size of the bases they had just cleared out in Iceland, there weren't all that many guards.
carefully wrapped his purchases in brown paper, tying the package with a piece of twine while his teenage son scooped out Little Steve's ice cream, giving him an extra half a scoop when Little Steve thanked him.
“Yes, Iron Man, I am,” Steve says in his Captain's voice, or at least what’s passing for his Captain’s voice at the moment.  “Because until I say otherwise, our mission isn’t over, which means that you're still obliged to follow my orders.”  He ducks down when Tony drops his eyes, refusing to let Tony break his gaze.  “Is that understood?”
"Hey, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said as he stepped into the room. "Thought maybe you might be up for another chess game now that you're done eating?"
"Bucky, you can't be saying stuff like that!" Steve said as they made their way to the locker room. "I can't risk Tony getting into trouble just because you can't seem to resist trying to tease us!"
"Yeah, I know," Steve said after a short pause. "Just… I need to talk to Tony on my own first, before we mention anything to Bruce. Something like this… I just need to handle it very carefully."
"But you told me that Colonel Phillips thinks that it might work," Peter said. "And Uncle James, so—"
"Oh, it wasn't just any wedding," said Grandma. "It was the wedding of the son of one of their top colonels. You see, despite the fact that the country was still technically a republic at the time, certain people inside the Air Corps were already starting to realise the power that they held, and already beginning to silence those who didn't agree with them. Whether the president knew about what was going on or not remains a mystery, but I'd be hard-pressed to be convinced that he didn't have at least some clue."
"Because I—" Steve started, then immediately paused, fighting the urge to clap his hand over his mouth. "I was just wondering, sir. Nothing more."
Peter, who deserved everything that was good and decent in the world, and yet somehow wound up with Tony as his father.  For thirteen years, Tony had thrown himself into being the best father he could be, all while trying to keep up the appearances of the flippant playboy that Obie seemed to feel was necessary for his image.
"Well, I can't fault you there," said Steve. He carefully peeled a banana, biting off a large piece as Bucky's words bounced around in his mind. "Tony and I both really appreciate you sticking around to keep an eye on Peter for us."
And right there, about fifty metres away from where the palace had once stood, was the Soul Stone, glinting bright orange in the rubble.
"What the hell are those?" Bucky asked as the first of the war dogs smashed themselves against the force shield. To Steve's shock, more than a few of them managed to make it through before they were literally burned in half, shedding limbs as they kept on running until they dropped.
Gritting his teeth, Peter pushed himself up to his feet, scanning along the outside wall for a door or a window he could sneak through and letting out a small "whoo!" when he spotted one about ten metres up from the ground. He launched another web, aiming it just below the window and immediately flattening himself against the wall as yet another sentry suit flew by. As soon as it was gone he planted his feet, bracing himself against the wall as he attempted to pry open the window, which was far thicker and stronger than it had initially looked.
"Babe, come and get ready for bed, yeah? You've gotta be tired," Tony said as he emerged from their master bathroom to find Steve slumped in the armchair in the corner, his elbows resting on his knees and his chin in his hand, with his worry wrinkle etched so deeply between his eyes that it looked like it could've bitten Tony on the nose if he got too close.
"You mean the one I used to have to physically drag you down from every day when I got home?" asked Tony.
“Ah, your hair is wet, young Peter?  Out in this cold?” she asks as she walks them to a table.  “You had another soccer game today?”
"I see," said Ms Sharon as she set down his tray, prepping her stethoscope. "Well, your heart rate is still a bit higher than usual, so I'm just going to keep a closer eye on it today, okay?" She patted the top of Peter's head, looking down at him with that pitying look that he abhorred. Peter knew she'd overheard what that dumb doctor had said too, and he'd already begged her more than once not to say anything to his father. The last thing Peter needed was for Dad to freak out over something that he could do absolutely nothing to prevent.
Captain," Tony would say, as he tried to hide that little half-annoyed smirk that Steve still found irresistible over four years later. Even when it was directed at him.
"Mmm. Well, I'm still gonna have Happy double the number of guards around the school, and if there's anyone there that you see that you don't know, any substitute teachers, any new staff members or students, anything at all, I want you call me right away so I can come and get you. Understand?"
If it wasn't for Tony and Peter’s support during the last year—actually, ever since SHIELD pulled him from the ice—Steve isn’t sure what he would've done.
"Copy that, J." Tony had created what he'd called 'practise satellites', which while similar in size and weight to the real Phoenix devices would self-destruct so as to not cause issues with the deployment of the actual functioning satellites later on. It had been essential for him to test whether or not the deployment mechanisms would function properly in a vacuum, and judging by his readings and Steve's comments, they had worked just fine.
"I'm ready," Bucky said firmly, his rifle trained on the alien now barrelling towards them, flanked by four Chitauri warriors. "Should I take 'em out?"
"Oh, you think?" Dad yelped. "Even more reason to get the hell off this rock! The Avengers need our help!" With a grunt, Dad pushed himself up to his feet, bringing Peter with him. "Buddy, I know you're pretty fried at the moment, but let's see what we can do with this ship, yeah? Papa needs us."
"I finally rest. Watch the sun rise on a grateful universe," answered Thanos, and Peter could've sworn that he looked almost sad. "The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
“Buddy, I’m almost positive that any goggles you might unearth from that mess wouldn't even fit around your head now,” Dad says.  “Why don’t we just stop at the store on the way there and pick you up a new pair?”
"Yeah, little guy, everything's all right," Steve whispered as he kissed him again. "Go on back to sleep now, okay?"
Tony suddenly cut in from next to one of the capsules, causing Steve to whip around. He'd been so stunned by everything else that he hadn't even realised Tony had left his side. "Steve, these are—I think these are stasis pods!"
"Yeah, I know, but Dad's got us on a complete lock-down right now. None of the people here can even leave until the new security systems are in place, so…" Peter didn't add that three people had already been arrested and removed from the Compound's premises due to suspicious activity on Papa's orders. That information would only invite more questions for which they still had no decent answers.
In his desperation earlier that morning, Tony had even asked Colonel Phillips to escort him down to the brig so he could speak with General O'Brien. Langaran troops searching through the various underground tunnels on the main Meridian base had already managed to find and arrest Justin Hammer—who then immediately broke down crying during his subsequent interrogation—but so far Hank Pym had managed to evade all attempts to find him, and Tony had been hoping that maybe once the general realised that his gig was finally up he might be willing to answer some of Tony's questions.
Tony thought as he breathed in, trying to contain his patience. "Yeah, okay, but we're not in an episode of Star Trek, Pete. This is actually happening, so I really don't think that—"
The Tennessee senator frowned as she leaned over to listen to her aide, whispering something that Steve couldn't catch.
And now, he didn't know what to do. The Wanda girl seemed to have some kind of manipulative powers over both mind and body, and while Steve had a feeling that she was just as much a prisoner of HYDRA as he was, his first priority had to be freeing Tony.
"Tony," Steve said with a frown. "I know you and Howard didn't get along that well, but I doubt that he was disappointed in you."
"Yeah, I do," Uncle Bucky said. He moved one of his knights, taking Peter's bishop with a triumphant smile. "And especially Стив. Тони has been with you since you were born but Стив hasn't, so it's maybe a bit harder for him. He never knew his own papa, and then his ma died when he was eighteen, and… he never thought he'd be able to have a family, so…"
"She was assigned to help protect me," Peter said. "She just told me this afternoon, Dad. Colonel Phillips arranged it."
He supposed he should’ve known it wouldn’t be just as easy as Pepper offering them a twenty percent higher salary, especially since three of them had already accepted research positions at pretty prestigious universities.  Tony had actually been forced to gather all five of them into a secure virtual meeting and pitch them his idea, one of the most difficult pitches of his life, as it turned out.
"Uhh, does someone wanna tell me what the hell's going on here?" Tony said warily. "In my son's hospital room? At his bedtime?"
T'Challa smiled slightly as a table server poured them all a large goblet of wine. "As I said earlier, Captain, there will be plenty of time to discuss such matters at a later time. Please, for now, let us just enjoy this lovely evening."
"Sleep well, bud," he said as he tucked the blankets under Peter's chin. He planted a kiss on Peter's forehead, thankful beyond belief that Peter still allowed him to do so. "Love you."
"No, thanks," Tony said quickly. "I'm… I usually just stay in my office most of the time. Much easier to work in there with the lights than it is at home where it's dark."
Steve flinched as the first sleek blue shots fired by the Wakandan warriors zoomed across the plain, aiming for the incoming warg-like war dogs. Above him, Sam and James swerved and dipped as they skirted along the very edge of the force shield. As James flew, he released small bombs from the back of his armour, trying to keep the war dogs that managed to break through the shield from advancing.
"They are?" Tony said with a worried glance towards the clock. It was only around ten; the dance wasn't supposed to be over for another couple hours. "Is Pete with them?"
, if it meant that he could wind up here, in a beautiful upstate home with the very husband and child he’d always wanted.
"Sounds to me like someone's a bit jealous," Sam said out of the corner of his mouth, followed immediately by a loud whoop as the leadoff Washington batter's bat connected with a fastball, bouncing towards the right-field corner for a double.
"Steady!" Steve cried over the thunderous pounding of footsteps, the adrenaline already buzzing through his bloodstream spiking when Thor let out an affirmative roar.
"Yes it is, Captain," said Anthony. He gestured towards the two simulators. "If you gentlemen don't mind climbing in we can get started right away."
Not surprisingly, the entire six-hour patrol shift seemed to go by in only a matter of minutes, such that Steve was actually disappointed when it was over. The X-302 had handled like an absolute dream, the smoothest aircraft he had ever flown, and he already couldn't wait to take her up again.
classify these devices as anything resembling a ‘toy’,” Tony said, low and tight.  “These printers are manufacturing medications that are vital to the well-being of the people the Stark Relief Foundation is trying to—”
Despite the pain throbbing with every single beat of his heart, Steve felt himself nodding off again, the dinosaur tranquilliser apparently even stronger than Bruce had said. Right away, he fell into a dream, a happy, peaceful dream that he instantly decided he never wanted to wake from.
"Copy that," Stacy said through yet another gunshot. "Most of the flying suits have exited the building, but we're still rooting out the rest of the ground personnel inside."
How Steve could possibly be interested in Tony was another matter altogether, but he supposed there was no harm in looking halfway decent when he picked up his son.
"No, I will go first, to make sure it is safe for you," insisted Drax as he drew Mantis behind him. Then he pulled out a pair of long, slightly curved knives that had been tucked into his belt, holding them with the pointy end down. "If I am not immediately murdered, then it should be okay for you to follow."
Dad let out a sigh as he glanced in Peter’s direction, grimacing as Peter hoisted himself up off the floor.
"It's one of her colleagues at the U-GIN group, Tony, who's already been vetted by Fury at least three times," Uncle Bruce said. "And you know that we've both taken extra precautions to remove all possible identifying characteristics. The only people who'll know who we're talking about are the team and Nick Fury."
They were mostly silent as Peter drove to Gwen's house as slowly as the traffic laws allowed, pulling up to the curb in front of her walkup about fifteen minutes later. Tears welled in Peter's eyes as he put the car into Park and reached for Gwen's face, drawing her close for a kiss.
It hadn't been too surprising that Dad had programmed JARVIS to block Peter from listening in on Papa's locator chip frequency during his trip, forcing Peter to use yet another of his complicated override programs in order to work around it. Peter was used to sneaking around, and as much as he hated having to do it so often, he wasn't about to stop just because his dads still thought he was some helpless little kid.
"Yep," Peter said as he did the same, making a mental note to grab both his glasses and the extra hoodie from his locker before heading to class. He hadn't slept all that great the previous night, with both he and Papa winding up in the kitchen at around three in the morning raiding the refrigerator. Papa had made Peter a cup of hot chocolate but thankfully didn't press him to talk too much, likely because neither one of them seemed to be in the mood for too much talking.
Gwen shot Peter a side eye, placing her hand on his knee under the table. "Well, I guess if whatever this thing is gives your mom some peace of mind, then it's probably fine. My mom has a police scanner in the house. It's what she listens to during the day, off and on. And my dad knows that he's supposed to check in with her at least three times during his shifts or else she starts to worry."
"Yep, just another typical day in a school full of geniuses," said Chief Stacy. "Have a nice evening, Captain, Peter."
"Maybe a little bit less chatter up there, guys, all right?" Steve said over the comm. Tony immediately whipped around, grunting in relief as he located Steve about ten or so metres away, fighting a group of Chitauri in a triangle formation with Bucky and Thor. The whole time they had been fighting, Tony had had to remind himself that Thanos didn't have the Soul Stone yet, and that their current main objective was to ensure that he didn't get it.
“Yeah, he did, bud,” Tony said as he ruffled his son’s messy curls.  “And your papa was the bravest man I’d ever seen during the whole thing.  I could not have been more proud.”
If nothing else, his back could definitely use the break. Even though the chairs he and Steve had been sitting on for the past week were pretty comfortable, they still weren't a bed.
Which, as far as he knew, meant getting the Time Stone—and the wizard attached to it, he supposed—back to Earth as soon as possible. Steve had wanted both stones in Wakanda so as to keep the fighting on only one front, and Tony had every intention of following through with that plan.
"It's okay, Uncle Bucky," Peter said softly. He hopped down from his chair, taking Bucky's hand and leading him over to the hologram, pointing to the offending dust. "See? Dad's already found the problem. You've just got some dust stuck down there, which is really easy to fix. Right, Dad?"
Steve yelled inside his mind, giving his head a quick shake. It didn't do any good to dwell on the 'what ifs', Sam always said that was like letting the demons win. Thanos had been defeated, Peter and the others had returned from the dead, and Tony was going to make a full recovery. Fighting against the demons left behind would be a lifelong battle, but one that Steve was more than willing to fight if it meant he'd get to keep his family intact.
"Mmm. Probably about time to pull out your heated undershirts, don't ya think?" said Dad. "Don't need you to be shivering out of your skin while you're at school."
“Let’s just say that they’re way above your pay grade, and leave it at that,” Fury said.  “And since we don’t know how far up this thing goes yet, I’d be extra careful about where you open ‘em.”
Tony sat back down at his workstation, pinching the bridge of his nose as he attempted to force his exhausted eyes to stay open. He had sent Bruce back downstairs when he started nodding off into one of his notebooks, but Tony at least needed to stay awake until Peter got home from the dance.
"But if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you could cancel my alarm for the morning," he added. It had been over three weeks since he'd taken a morning off from running, and despite his blatant attempts to ignore it, his left foot was definitely starting to notice.
Used to the abrupt halt as he arrived at the predetermined coordinates, and the brief breathlessness that followed.
"Okay," Steve said, nodding rapidly. He licked at his dry lips, still staring at Tony like he was afraid he would disappear. "Tony, I just—"
Steve let out a contented chuckle as he emerged from the bathroom to find Tony already dozing on the bed, his computer still on his lap and his glasses askew on his face.  He had taken Peter to a Mets game that evening, the first baseball game he’d gone to in over a decade, and had arrived home to find Tony holed up in his lab working on the new power source he’d been developing.  After regaling Tony about the game for almost half an hour, Steve had finally shooed Peter off to bed, allowing Steve to try and cajole Tony into doing the same.
“These are so awesome!” Peter said as he selected a bright blue bookmark containing one of his favourite
“Johann Schmidt!” the announcer’s voice booms over the speakers, followed immediately by an eruption of cheers from the stands.  Against his better judgement, Steve glances over to his right as the tall, handsome German swimmer with the wide, cocky smile raises his hands to his mouth and blows a kiss towards the section of the crowd waving German flags and carrying signs embossed with his name.  The defending champion in the 100 free, Schmidt placed first in both his qualifying heat and his semi-final race, where he also broke the Olympic record, landing him comfortably in lane four as the odds-on favourite to win the gold.
T'Challa smiled, in the way a parent would smile at a child who didn't quite understand something. "Not exactly, Ms Romanoff," he said. "You see, in my culture, death is not the end. It's more of a stepping off point. You reach out with both hands to Bast and Sekhmet, and they lead you to the green veld where you can run forever."
"Ah, yep," answered Tony, his voice shaking ever-so-slightly. "And unless I manage to find the steering wheel in the next six seconds or so, I'm thinking I'm gonna be here awhile."
"Hmph," Dr Strange said, scowling as he turned on his heel. "Let me know when we're close to landing."
Well, there wasn't anything he could do about it now. Hopefully he didn't smell like he'd worn the same clothes for the last two days.
He had just managed to take a true, deep breath and wiped the tears from his eyes when someone knocked on his door.
"Uh huh," said Peter. "But you're my dads. You're supposed to say stuff like that. But what if—what if I hadn't caught Gwen when she went over the edge? Then what would've happened to her?"
Since he had already seen the movie two previous times, Peter was able to anticipate most of the explosions and brace himself against the noise. Uncle Sam had suggested that he try to wean his dependence on his earplugs during one of their recent talks, thinking that if Peter was better able to keep his senses under control during normal daytime activities that it would maybe help with the severity of his nightmares, and so far it actually seemed to be working. Whether it was due to the fact that maintaining his focus without the extra help was so exhausting that he was simply too tired to dream or he was actually getting better Peter hadn't yet figured out, but he was pretty much to the point where he didn't care
"It would mean that my papa was killed by a Langaran weapon instead of a Meridian one," Steve said, almost spitting the words. "And it also would mean that the Langaran military deliberately attacked our own power plant, which then threw the entire country into chaos."
"Base, this is Lieutenant Rogers. Be advised, I'm checking out what appears to be a rogue aircraft that's on a direct course for the mountain power plant. Any info you could give me on this would be greatly appreciated."
Steve thought as his eyes swept across his teammates, all waiting expectantly for him to give the word.
"I need to eat something," he gasped. His heart was racing and sweat was still pouring off of him, dripping into his eyes and onto the floor of the hangar as Bucky planted his palm on the middle of Steve’s back and guided him to the self-service section of the mess hall.
"But it's not okay!" Peter rasped against Tony's soaking wet chest. "Daddy, I was just—I only wanted to help, but now—we're not—we're not ever gonna—!"
As to what exactly Peter believed that might be, Tony could only guess. And since he didn't really have the time to be guessing at the moment, Tony supposed that a deeper dive was going to have to wait until after they won the battle.
Tony moaned as Steve suddenly sat back on his heels, sliding Tony's pants and underwear off and tossing them onto the floor. He bit his bottom lip as Steve's eyes swept across him again, like he was trying to memorise him, and the thought of it made Tony shiver.
It'd been bad enough having to say goodbye to his sweet son the first time, but after Thor's dramatic arrival at the Tower and the grim proclamation that followed, saying goodbye the second time had been even more difficult. The intense fear that Steve had seen in Peter's eyes had been even worse after Thor dropped his bombshells, and it had taken nearly all of Steve's strength to put on as brave a face as he could as he tucked Peter back into bed before the team departed.
"No, I will not," Howard said firmly, his eyes narrowing into a fierce glare. "As you may know, my young son is still trying to recover from nearly dying during his surgery on that fateful day, so I do not believe it would be in his best interests for me to leave the house at the moment."
"I just got off the phone with Colonel Phillips," he began. "Carol and the other backup patrollers were up there for three straight hours, and they couldn't find a damn thing that might give us a clue as to what the hell happened out there today. Phillips already has the secondary backup crew up there with the current patrol shift, but again, he's not expecting them to find anything either."
"I'm gonna keep working on it, Dad," Peter said firmly. "I've already written a whole bunch of new code today, so—"
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to tell Bruce that he had no intention of picking up a pencil or paintbrush ever again when James grabbed hold of his arm, holding it steady as Bruce jabbed him with the needle. The drug hit him like a truck, making his head spin even more as James guided him to lie back on the gurney.
"Are you okay with all this?" he asked as he drew Tony flush against him, tucking his head under his chin. "I'm sorry that I didn't ask you first, but—"
Seeing what he’d seen and living what he’d lived through over the last twenty—or really for most of his life, if he were honest—Steve had been convinced that nothing could truly shock him anymore.  But he would now swear on about a thousand polygraph tests that
Steve huffed out a ragged breath as he stripped off his jeans and underwear, shocked he didn't tear them in his haste as Tony slid off his own, tossing them onto the floor in a heap.
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered. "If it helps at all, I'm just as scared. I've had to watch Pete battle some pretty serious stuff in his short lifetime, but that coma down in Miami, that was the worst of it. If you hadn't been there with me, well… let's just say it wouldn't've been pretty." He pressed a kiss to Steve's forehead, suppressing a shudder at the awful memory. "But all that being said, I still think we're gonna have to let him do this. If Bucky goes through with the test and it's successful, our fear won't be a good enough excuse to say no."
Once he had regained his voice, Tony had briefly tried to talk him out of it.  Surprisingly, though, he had been overruled by Sam, who then asked if it would be all right for himself and Sergeant Barnes to accompany Tony as well.  According to Sam, while Bucky was a bit further along in his PTSD recovery than Steve, the fact that he’d lost his arm still caused him a lot of anguish and pain, both physically and mentally.  Being able to look Obie in the eye while he went down would give both Steve and Bucky the type of closure that other soldiers in their shoes could only dream of.
"Yeah, thanks, J," said Tony. "And if you don't mind, go ahead and dig into Howard's archives and pull up the number of that FBI agent that he used to have drinks with whenever he was in D.C., yeah? What was his name?"
, he’s been what Peter would call obsessed, trying anything and everything to locate the rest of them.  In the almost twelve months since the Battle of the Triskelion, Steve has led the Avengers on six separate raids, trying to hunt down the HYDRA remnants scattered across the globe.  Add all that to the ongoing search for Bucky, who so far has managed to evade every single one of their efforts to find him, and Steve can’t exactly say that he’s been the most fun person to be around lately.
Steve was told by the surgeon before his operation that the recovery process following a rotator-cuff repair was one of the most painful joint recoveries out there, and
"No need to thank me," she said. She nudged him with the glass again, holding it steady while he swallowed. "Here, now take another. That's right."
"I'm kinda hoping that Thor might show up again once we start," Steve said, watching with amusement as Tony scooped up the remaining sauce on his plate with a second slice of bread. For all his grumbling about Steve making him eat regular meals, Tony never complained all that much about the food itself.
In any case, if the way Steve is shivering is any indication, they’re just about out of time.  Which means if he’s going to say something, he better do it soon.
Steve was reaching for Tony's face before Colonel Phillips had even finished speaking. They were both almost smiling too hard to even kiss, but they still managed to get in a couple of lingering pecks, finally separating when Cam Mitchell let out an ear-splitting wolf whistle and the entire crowd began to applaud.
"Ten minutes?" Tony yelped, sitting bolt upright on the bed. "But how in the hell—Steve, that doesn't make any sense! How—?"
sorry! I didn't—I didn't see you there, and I—I wasn't paying attention, and I didn't—I didn't think you'd be…" He paused, tilting his head back a bit as his eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Um… why were you standing outside the boys' locker room, exactly?"
"Yeah," Peter said. He curled his arms around her waist, ducking his head so he could kiss her. With him up at the Compound every weekend, they didn't get very many opportunities to do things together outside of school, and he had been looking forward to this evening for the entire day, in spite of the reasons for it.
Steve didn't even justify that statement with a reply, choosing to simply glare at the man until he shifted on his feet.
"Yeah, it makes sense," she said. "Just as long as you don't think that you can't talk to me about it."
"Okay, guys, I think we're all set out here," Bruce suddenly said over the intercom. "Peter, we can start whenever you're ready."
"Well, not if it means that we don't pancake ourselves down in those trees, but, okay," Sam said warily. "You're the boss."
He was cut off by Tony's lips, his tongue slipping into Steve's mouth as Steve's hands splayed across Tony's ass, groaning in appreciation as he dug his fingers into the round, firm flesh.
Pursing his lips, Steve checked his compass—another gift from Tony—and adjusted his stance, leaning a bit more forward to hopefully keep from slipping again.  His pace, although brisk, was still far slower than his usual due to the need to keep an eye out for traps, and as the sun began to dip further and further behind the tall, pointed trees, Steve found himself almost tiptoeing, crouched low behind his shield as he carefully took each measured step.
"I agree," said Fury. "And you're welcome. Now, I'm sure I don't have to remind you that this information is only on a need-to-know basis. You have permission to share it with your team, Captain, but no one else."
"I'm ready too, Tony," Steve said as he too leaned back in the water. "One more run just like last time."
"Tony," he said gently as he worked his hand underneath Tony's arm, giving him a slight shake when Tony didn't respond. "Sweetheart, come with me, okay?"
Tony thought as a violent shiver raced down his spine. He glanced behind him, his heart flipping as he saw that Peter was already shaking on his skis. He was already wearing a wetsuit designed for much cooler water due to his inability to regulate his own body temp, but the air temp had been close to thirty Celsius when they started, and it now felt closer to fifteen.
A huge thank you to my awesome friends allthesinnersandallthesaints and jehbeeeh for their help with prereading this prologue!  💖
"Yeah, probably," Tony said, his shoulders sagging in defeat. "The materials I use are patented and specific only to Stark Industries, but there are alternatives out there that are available, and the guy is pretty damn smart, I'll give him that."
"Mmm. You and Stevie both, apparently," grumbled Uncle Bucky. He shifted on his chair, tossing a quick glance at the door. "All right."
Steve's hand tightened on Tony's shoulder as he burrowed even further into Tony's neck. "Then we fight back, just like Peter said."
"Uh huh." Peter crossed his arms, sticking out his bottom lip in such a perfect pout that Steve almost laughed. "It's too bad you can't meet my dad, I think he'd really like you."
Despite his grandfather's best efforts to just heal his messed-up heart and lungs with the serum, Peter was now officially an enhanced human like Papa, with the heightened strength, senses, and appetite to prove it.
"Yeah, I know, but—" He huffed out a sharp breath, taking hold of Gwen's hands. "Look, this—this is gonna be huge, Gwen, okay? Bigger than the Battle of New York, so… my dads, they're gonna need my help. I need to go help them."
"Yeah, it's all right," Steve murmured as he sat down on the side of the bed. "I'd be the same way."
"Oh, that's okay, I probably had more time to work on mine anyway," Peter said. "You can finish it now if you want."
"He's a kid?" a woman's voice suddenly said from somewhere off to the side. Peter gasped as she stepped into view; tall, dark-haired, and completely green.
"No, it's not, but it's also not up to me," Phillips grumbled, and Steve's head snapped back in surprise. He couldn't recall ever hearing Phillips speak anything less than admirably about their military leadership.
Ever the gentleman, Steve insisted on coming around to Tony's side with an umbrella before they headed inside the hospital, the hallway dim and quiet as they made their way down to Peter's room.
“Tony!” he tries again as he drags himself across the frigid floor.  “Tony, please!  I need—I need—!”
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 😊
“He identified himself as Tony Stark,” Lorraine says.  “Which, I wanna say I’ve heard that name before somewhere, but I’ll be damned if I can remember where.”
And ever since then they've been trying to get him back, either to figure out where they went wrong, or use him to perfect their conversion process.
“No!” Tony forced between his clenched teeth as he helped Peter to his feet, tucking him behind him.  “Just… don't!  Don't you dare try and say anything else!  You fucking broke his finger, Steve!  I need—I need to get him to a doctor!”
, Steve thought. As often as he used the "going for a drive" as an excuse for his afternoon disappearances it had been a pretty long time since he'd actually just gone for a drive, and there was a pretty nice lake not too far from the base that Steve had been thinking about heading to for awhile anyway.
A sentiment Steve could also sympathise with, given that he still had no idea if Tony and Peter had survived the snap, or even where they were.
of the bell with each answer rubbing against Peter's already fried nerves like a cheese grater. JARVIS had informed him about an hour ago that his dads had finally gotten home and would be able to pick him up from school, and he just knew that they were going to figure out that something was very wrong the second they laid eyes on him.
"No!" he yelped as he twisted around again, this time seeing Uncle Clint attacking people in what could only be called a murderous rage, no doubt mad with grief over losing Auntie Nat.
“All right,” says Steve.  “Then next, we should figure out how much food and water is available.  There were quite a few soldiers stationed here based on the resistance we encountered, so I’m hoping there’ll be enough supplies for a few days, but—”
They had celebrated Steve's birthday a few days ago, his ninety-sixth—or thirty-second, however one chose to look at it. After a huge dinner and dessert that Peter had prepared almost all by himself, Tony and Peter had presented Steve with a brand-new Harley-Davidson motorcycle, a 1958 Duo Glide model that was nearly identical to the bike Tony had given Steve for his ninety-second birthday, shortly before the Malibu house was bombed. Ever since then, Tony had searched far and wide for another like-new Duo Glide with no success, and had finally just ended up commissioning the people at Harley-Davidson itself to custom-build one for him.
"Only the best climbing trees that I've ever seen, buddy," Tony said. He ruffled Peter's hair, trying hard to contain his emotions. Over the past few days he had cried enough tears to last a lifetime, but still they insisted on coming. "And Papa and I can't wait to see you climb 'em."
"Were you planning on telling me that you'd broken your glasses anytime soon, or was I just supposed to guess?" asked Dad.
His teammate. The man Steve had known since he was four years old, through good and bad, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, through peacetime and war. A man Steve had thought he had once loved, and who they rescued from the brink of his HYDRA-induced madness.
lately, and the bright, sun-shiny weather he could see through his window didn't help. It had been so long since he'd been able to play outside—or even go outside at all—that he'd pretty much forgotten what it was like.
"Yeah, you might've mentioned that a time or three," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "In the last sixty seconds or so. There! It's right there, right by your hand!"
"Colonel!" Tony said as he grabbed onto the side of the console. His mind was racing so fast that he felt dizzy. "Colonel, what the hell
"So, now you're telling me that I stink?" Bucky asked as they headed towards the shed housing the golf carts, just as Wanda, Natasha, and Clint took off towards the Compound's residential building. The nearly three-kilometre-wide training dome was situated a good kilometre away from the rest of the Compound's structures, just in case something happened to go badly wrong during one of their training exercises.
“First things first,” Tony muttered as he quickly scrubbed shampoo and conditioner into his hair, digging his fingertips into his scalp as he rinsed.  Years of perfecting his complicated beard made shaving all that much faster, so it was only fifteen minutes later that Tony stepped into the kitchen to find Peter sitting at the breakfast bar, eating from his usual massive bowl of Lucky Charms.
Gritting his teeth, Peter had just managed to get the hole big enough to shove Chief Stacy through when a bolt of lightning appeared, striking the fire demon directly on the top of its head. The monster immediately roared again, looking up towards what remained of the ceiling as Thor suddenly dropped out of the sky and disappeared inside it.
“Nah, bud, you know I don’t mind,” Dad replies.  “There’s not too much in the shop at the moment anyway, so the timing worked out fine.”
Even the news that Loki's sceptre had been taken had been kept a secret, with the official word from Director Fury being that a malfunctioning, out-of-control satellite crash was to blame for the attack up at the Compound.
Steve's piercing blue eyes flashed with anger, glaring down at Tony. "It tells us that Peter isn't safe, and that it's all my fault."
Tony murmured, his brown eyes sparkling in the bright spring sun shining in through the training dome's windows. "If you must insist, then yes. You are the finest time-traveller I've ever seen. So do me a favour and be careful in there, yeah? 'Cause I'd kinda like it if you came back in one piece."
Peter cried as he pulled Gwen to her feet, placing her behind him and cursing the fact that he hadn't brought a set of web shooters with him. His dads had taken his suit away, but Peter had built no less than three extra sets of web shooters since then, and usually had a set on him at all times just in case.
Tony held Peter's hand as the medics took hold of the stretcher, guiding it towards the door. At the last second he grabbed the worn notebook from Peter's bedside table, tucking it under his arm as they stepped outside, the red flashing lights of the transport vehicle almost too bright against the somber darkness of the neighbourhood. Climbing into the transport after Peter, Tony glanced back up at the house to see Howard standing in the doorway, his head down and his shoulders curled in.
Chomping down hard on his bottom lip, Steve tips himself to the side as Tony wrenches the shield out from underneath him.  He grits his teeth as the pain crests and then ebbs slightly, just enough for him to be able to draw in a single deep breath.
Hurrying into the officers' locker room, Steve dumped his bat into the trash bin and headed straight for the showers, turning up the water as hot as he could tolerate in the hopes it could somehow burn away the uneasiness that had been slowly trying to consume him from the inside out.
Even the fact that Peter was the one who had figured out where HYDRA had taken Papa after they arrested him back in May didn't seem to matter. Without his goofy spider-vision that had enabled him to see through the retro-reflective panels surrounding the building, Papa may very well have been dead by the time Dad and the rest of the team managed to locate him.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments on the first chapter!  I’m so glad you guys are enjoying the story! 💖
Steve was quiet for a moment, his thumb tracing soft circles on the back of Tony's hand. "I do think it's selfish, yes," he finally said. "But I also don't think it's very wrong of us to be selfish in that way. He's our son, Tony, and it's our job to protect him. And in certain cases I think that includes protecting him from himself."
"It appears so, sir, but the data was processed through an innumerable number of routers, so I am unable to determine exactly where it was accessed from, or where the data ended up."
"Yeah, it's better to be safe than sorry," Steve said after a short pause. "We'll just keep most of our big equipment on the jet."
Breathing in, Papa leaned forward in the chair, staring at the image of himself as he spoke with his teammates over the comm.  Peter gulped as Image Papa suddenly tore off his helmet, clutching it to his chest as his breathing grew more and more ragged.
"Ahh," Papa said with a short laugh. "Yeah, that was only a week or so after my procedure, so neither of us were quite used to it yet."
“Ha.  Hammer Industries,” Tony scoffed.  “Like they've ever developed anything that’s actually worked.”
"You're just deflecting again, like you always do," Peter cut in, frowning. "You know, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to tiptoe around me as much as you do."
"Always so antsy," Steve said with a smirk. He leaned down for a deep, sloppy kiss before reaching for the bottle of lube. "Back on your back now, okay?"
Peter huffed out a sharp breath, closing his eyes as Papa pulled onto the street. "I know… I just didn't wanna bother you."
Tony could only nod, not at all comfortable discussing the relationship he had with his husband with the man Steve had confessed to once being in love with, and even less so in front of Peter. Deep down Tony knew he had nothing to worry about, that his petty insecurities were all in his head, but he still didn't enjoy being reminded of them.
At least, he was until Tony started going over the details of Beck's proposal. As soon as Tony uttered the words CTX-616, all the colour drained from Steve's face and he grabbed Tony's hand, squeezing it hard.
As soon as the screen went blank, Steve huffed out a sharp breath, dropping his chin to his chest. All unique perspectives aside, the disaster they were currently going through wasn't anything that Steve had even ever imagined, much less experienced. World War II had disrupted a good deal of the known civilised world back in the day, but this… this was something else.
"What?" Steve snapped, giving his head a quick shake when the cadet blinked. "Oh, yes, cadet, I'm fine. As you were."
on the window of his cell startled Steve awake, and he groaned, slowly peeling his eyes open and shielding them against the harsh white light as the silhouette of a bespectacled brown-haired man dressed in a very expensive suit came into focus.
It happened as if in slow motion.  The way the backpack swung around Peter’s body, swiping across the end cap display and knocking three of the books loose from the shelf.  Steve’s stomach dropped to his knees as he lunged forward, trying to cross the remaining distance before they had a chance to hit the floor.
"Not yet, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said quickly. He shot Peter a conflicted look before returning his gaze to the chessboard. "Colonel Rhodes is heading back up to the base to see what's going on now, so hopefully we'll hear something soon."
"Hey, little guy!" Papa said from the monitor in Peter's room, his over-enthusiastic greeting doing absolutely nothing to hide the intense fatigue and worry lining his face. They were sitting inside what looked like a huge stone building or bunker, not too unlike the one where he was taken by Obie and Killian.
Rolling his eyes, Peter slumped forward, resting his chin in his hand as the teacher began her lecture and trying not to think about
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, bud, although I wouldn't've exactly called it a fight. Mostly he just kinda stood there like a lost puppy while I yelled at him, and then he told me the same things you just told me."
"Probably not," agreed Ned. "It is a pretty cool car though, even if I'd never admit it to his face. Oh, and my mom found something out the other day at one of her book clubs. Apparently there's a new deputy police chief in our area, and he's got a daughter who'll be starting at Midtown in our class." He paused dramatically, leaning in closer. "And according to my mom's friend, this girl's supposedly even smarter than you."
"Me too," Steve said. He slid his fingertips down Tony's arm, interlocking their fingers before guiding them to Tony's cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts. "Please, sweetheart. Ba mhaith liom go dtiocfadh muid le chéile!"
And, because of that small delay, Tony now had no doubt that Peter knew something extraordinary had happened.
"Well…" Steve said as he picked up Tony's left hand, twirling the titanium ring that encircled his third finger. "It might have something to do with this."
Reaching for his water bottle, Peter chugged over half of it in just a few seconds, wiping his sleeve across his chin before tapping open the next file. He breathed in, letting it slowly out as he allowed his eyes to relax into their unfocused state so he could decipher the text.
"Yes sir, I understand," Joseph answered as he sharply banked right, swerving around until he had once again manoeuvred directly behind the unknown aircraft.
It took Steve a moment for her words to sink in. "Wait. So you're saying that what's happening here—"
"Yeah," Peter said as he backed out of the garage, carefully navigating the long driveway and onto the main road. "My dads told me that Uncle Bucky helped them pick out the colours."
“Oh?  What’d you find?” Steve asks, because he actually googled Tony last night too.  And what he found only made his curiosity spike.
Steve’s cheeks flushed a light pink.  “Yes, I did,” he said quietly.  “Drawing is another hobby of mine.”
"Me too, mo grá, me too," Steve said as he kissed the top of Tony's head. "And I know Bucky's relieved as well. He would hate for Peter to have to see him as anything other than his true self."
As soon as the screen went blank, Peter huffed out a sharp breath, scrubbing at his eyes with the heels of his hands and wincing at the pain that shot through his damaged fingers. Sleep had been so hard to come by lately that his vision kept warping into the honeycomb-like state that it always took on when he was extra tired, but he hadn't wanted to arouse suspicions by wearing the glasses Dad had made for him so he'd just been trying to deal with it.
"Are you saying that we did it?" Phillips asked. "Are you saying that this whole goddamn thing was actually worth it?"
"I'm afraid not, both Mr Stark and Captain Rogers are asleep. Would you like me to give them a message?"
"There," Peter murmured as he finished shading in his latest drawing of Mrs Bird and her three chicks, tilting his head as he added a single wayward feather sticking straight up on the top of the smallest chick's head. It was something that Peter could empathise with, always having had such crazy hair as a little kid.
"Yeah. The Quantum Realm," Scott said as he fiddled with the cap to his water bottle. "Okay, so… however many months ago when… well, you know—"
“Hey there, big guy,” Tony murmured as he tucked Steve close, smoothing his sweat-dampened hair from his forehead.  “It’s okay, yeah?  I’ve got you.”
Dad pursed his lips as he looked over at Papa, who tilted his head and frowned. Peter couldn't quite tell if it was the, I'm-not-sure-about-this frown, or the I'll-let-you-decide-sweetheart frown, but he knew it was at least one of the two possibilities.
The tone of Tony’s voice, so melancholy and devoid of hope, is enough to make tears burn in Steve’s eyes.
"Tony hasn't even noticed," Steve spat out, instantly hating himself for speaking so badly about his husband. "He—he can't. He's so locked up inside his own mind that he—he—"
"Uncle Bucky, stay with Gwen!" Peter yelled, locking eyes just long enough with his beloved uncle to show him that he was serious. Uncle Bucky's metal arm would only attract the monster, and that plus the fact that he couldn't reveal his enhanced abilities without blowing his cover meant that he just needed to get Gwen to safety and let Peter take care of the rest of the people.
Steve shook his head, making a poor attempt at a smile. "It's all right, Bruce. I know all of this has been a bit tedious, and keeping you from your other work, but I also know that I don't need to remind you how important it is." He paused, his eyes sweeping around his teammates all gathered around him. "I know it's sometimes hard to remember, but we're not only doing all of this for Peter's sake. From what we've witnessed so far it does appear that these semi-enhanced individuals were aiming directly for Peter, but we also can't forget to look at the bigger picture. The fact that these individuals even exist in the first place is because someone, or a group of someones, has taken it upon themselves to decide what they think is best for everyone else, and has done so without consideration for anyone else but themselves. Now, I'm not sure about you, but I don't think a true democracy would allow that to happen, which is why we not only have to continue what we're doing in light of recent events, we also have to be even more careful about it. Because until we're able to gather all the available evidence and tie all of these seemingly random events together, we're just as vulnerable as any other average citizen when it comes to the whims of this new government, and I know that's one thing that I'm not personally willing to put up with."
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves yet, little guy," said Papa. "Let's just take things as they come."
Rumlow's bright pink lips curled into a sneer, one so awful that an ice-cold shiver raced down Steve's spine. "What makes you think i was gonna sell it to anyone?" he said, letting out a laugh that was so slimy it made Steve's blood run cold. "Hey, how's that kid of yours doing, hmm? He still getting those… what'd you call them? Premonitions? Does he still think I'm a bad guy who's gonna come and get him during the night?"
"Copy that." Steve made one final glance around the circle of his teammates, ending with Tony, whose face was broadcasting exactly what Steve was feeling.
, so I had no choice but to pick him up. And then I tucked him to my chest, with his tiny head resting over my heart, and he grabbed onto my shirt with his little fist and fell asleep in about three minutes. And once he was out, Rhodey made sure that there were bottles and diapers within reach and took off. And then it was just the two of us. And I didn't let Pete out of my sight for longer than a few seconds until Rosa came to live with us."
"Ten seconds," Steve whispered. It didn't seem like a lot, but in a firefight, when a fraction of a second could mean the difference between life or death, it may as well have been ten years.
Peter gritted his teeth as he fumbled with the combination lock on his locker, trying to get his fried eyes to focus on the tiny little numbers so he could actually get the thing to open without breaking it. Normally when he was as tired and anxious as he was he would've already been wearing his glasses, but since he had managed to break one of the arms off of them earlier in the day they were no longer an option. Apparently this growth spurt he was in was affecting a bit more than just his appetite, as he hadn't been able to control his strength well at all since pretty much the beginning of the school year. In addition to the broken glasses, he had also torn the shoelaces on three pairs of shoes, ripped the zipper on both a backpack and his favourite hoodie, and nearly yanked the passenger side seatbelt in Uncle James' car clear out of its socket. Papa had suggested that he and Uncle Bucky try some arm-wrestling sessions the last time Peter had spoken to him and they had helped some, but he still felt like his enhancements were coming out all over again, and it was all very unnerving.
The drive back to the Tower passed in a daze. Leaning his head against the wall of the elevator, Peter closed his eyes, bracing himself for the inevitable third degree as soon as he stepped into the penthouse.
He closed his bruised and swollen eyes as bright flashes of light raced across his mind, sprinkled with various images of his husband and son that were alternatively heart-wrenching and terrifying. Peter lying unconscious, crushed underneath three tons of rubble. Tony being attacked by some electronic whip-wielding lunatic while he was driving. Peter being attacked by the very defence drones that Tony had invented to protect him, while Quentin Beck looked on and laughed.
"Greetings, my dear friends," Thor cut in as he clapped Steve on the arm so hard that it nearly knocked him sideways. "I must apologise for my abrupt entrance, I'm afraid my landings tend to be a bit touchy without my hammer."
