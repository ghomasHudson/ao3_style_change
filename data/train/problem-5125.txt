Dean hums. He lays on his back, arms folded behind his head, his chest still rises rapidly and his lips and neck look completely flushed. Castiel curses the existence of the refractory period. If here were still at full power he’d make it so that they could both perform for as long as they wanted.
“Then I lose anyway; you won’t be happy.”
“Dean.” Cass says.
to stay behind? That was a blow Dean never recovered from. They hung out. They made a home in the bunker. They trained with each other in their free time and watched movies and drank beer.
Sam scoffs. Grueling indeed.
Castiel stills, unsure of what happens next as Dean basks in aftermath of his release. He lays almost serenely, Castiel thinks, on the bed now; his expression dazed and thoroughly content. His heart pinches, seeing the hunter in what must be a fleeting moment of freedom.
It’s better if he keeps his distance.
Strangely… Dean finds his feet trembling as he tries to move towards the box.
Dean stalks Chuck Shurley.
But now Aziraphale is introducing a small tanned lady with Harry Potter glasses and his heart is beating way too fast and somehow the only thing he can think of is the way Dean is looking at him.
“I don’t know.” Cass says, oblivious to him. “I didn’t look at it long before…” Cass trails off as his eyes rest on the broken pen.
Castiel rushes over almost knocking him back down with his enthusiasm. Dean snarls. “Do not touch me. Do not help me… your help is equivalent to enacting a death sentence.”
“It’s okay. I love you.” Dean’s voice trembles as he forces the words out.
Loud laughter booms as Lucifer steps into the room. His hands spread wide, spinning in a circle and taking in the scene around him. “Oh.” He coos. “Look at my little birdies.”
Just as he opens his mouth, Adam’s hand covers it. He shakes his head sadly. “I don’t want to coerce it out of you.” Adam admits. “I wanted you to trust me.”
And Cass probably knew that too.
“Um…” Dean trails off, his hand on the door. “Cass, buddy, where you going?”
Dean doesn’t reply.
getting into this.”
“I’m doing it because I want to Dean.” Cass tells him gently.
Castiel wakes alone. The curtail billowing in the cool night breeze, but Dean noticeable absent from his side. He hears noises down in the kitchen and immediately thinks that Dean is just sneaking a few bites of the pie. He plans to sneak down and tease him, maybe get in a few bites himself.
And Dean releases.
Even in the face of his imminent defeat, he’s found a way to take victory away from them.
Now that he knows Cass never saw him the way others did - that he saw Dean as something kind and loving - Dean doesn’t know how to unpack that. He doesn’t know how to cope with the fact that Cass cared about the world because of Dean.
This visual; Cass on his knees, licking at his cock like it’s a friggin popsicle, it turns him on like no other. He squeezes his eyes shut as Cass laves at the tip, purposefully teasing him.
“You need help?” Sam nods over.
Sam stares at him expectantly. “For hours?”
The only possible response to this is: “I love you as well, Dean. I won’t give up. You’re too important to me.”
*Dean's Dr. Sexy fantasy
“I- I think –I –” he breaks off in a whimper.
See you next week <3
Cas hesitates, still squinting at him, eyes blazing, “You've called me that before.”
Dean nods, fidgets with his hands. Sam's absence at this table is glaringly obvious. For a moment, Dean contemplates reaching over to take Cas' hand and thing is – he could, he totally could. Eileen would be the last person to say anything about it. Still, they're kind of in public and Dean--
Dean looks up when a different signal pings from the screen.
Dean remembers Jack giving him some food for thought. About heaven, working the way you wanted it to, but also the way you needed it to. He sees now, that he needed to find happiness in other ways than with Sam and hunting. So when Sam came along, forty years older and wiser and independent, Dean would be able to deal.
He wipes his hands on a towel, cleans the plates around the burgers from where some of the meat juices dripped around it, then heads out to serve them.
“Well, we're here now,” Cas says, like it's simple, and wraps his arms around Dean's middle. And so they sit there, on this comfy sofa that Dean got for a buck and a half off of Craigslist and they listen to Billy Joel wax poetic about taking the good times and the bad times.
Dean laces their fingers together. Huffs out a laugh, looks up at the first stars.
Cas smiles, lifts his hand, and Dean watches it start to shine, bright and golden, as he feels himself drift off into a different place.
But so is Sam, and that’s turned out just fine for him, so far.
he thought to himself.
A woman in a white dress had made her way to their table. Cas’ eyes went impossibly wider and he started chugging his beer. Dean chuckled lightly.
Dean couldn’t believe his ears. He rolled with it anyway. “Wait, not to go back to the whole God thing, but- can only He hear prayers? Or do angels hear them, too?”
Dean was on his couch in the living room. Sam was down the hall, working on homework. Dean had wanted to tell him about it, about Cas, but- he also didn’t want to look crazy if Cas decided not to show up. So he chose to tell Sam when Cas was there. If he was okay with it. He let Cas know where he would be earlier that day. Just in case.
-but Dean grabbed his shoulders, keeping their faces a few inches apart.
He and Dean were on a hunt. They slashed the heads of a couple vamps, then came across something neither them or Bobby could identify right away. Of course, they called Cas in to help them.
Laughing, Dean relaxed slightly. “Yeah, well, I don’t think that could happen.” He shrugged as he continued. “I do know that I will be as annoying as possible. Just because you won’t stop teasing me.” He smirked, tongue in cheek. “Maybe I’ll start teasing back.”
alright, thank you sm for reading!! leave me a comment with your thoughts, and I hope to see you in the next chapter!! ily, have a wonderful week <3
In other words, it was almost midnight. All the beings from the other world would be gone in five minutes.
That’s how they ended up standing in front of their open room, hand in hand, mouths open. Dean squeezed Cas’ hand then let go, grabbing their bags and taking them inside. Cas trailed after him, putting his jackets away and looking around, an expression of awe on his face.
Cas a fry dipped in milkshake. Cas ate the fry, giving Dean an approving grin. He said something Sam couldn’t hear, and Dean laughed, waving him forward and gently holding his face. He wiped a bit of shake from Cas’ lip, and smiled.
Cas thought for a moment, looking down at the floor between them. Dean watched his hair fall slightly into his face. “Well, it depends. If you pray to God, He’ll hear it, we won’t. But, if you direct it at one of us, then yeah. I would be able to hear it if it was directed at me.”
“Hey,” he said, smiling at Cas gently. The angel felt his stomach flip. “If you really, really don’t want to, we can go do something else. But you should try. I mean, no consequences, remember? No tomorrow. Okay?”
Dean let out a noise of disbelief. “Cas!” He said, a grin beginning to overtake his face. “This industry runs on absent fathers. It’s, like, the natural order of things.” He chuckled, shaking his head fondly before he saw some security guards coming into the hall. “C’mon,” he murmured to Cas, grabbing the angel’s hand and pulling him towards the exit.
The man nodded, and Dean felt his heartbeat quicken. “Yeah, okay,” he said, smiling a little as he put his hands in the pockets of his trench coat.
It worked. Dean quieted, his wails becoming whimpers before dispersing completely. Cas stayed long after Dean had quieted, holding Dean’s head in his lap, running gentle fingers through his hair, rubbing his shoulder. Sam decided, as he watched Dean curl his entire body toward Cas, that his brother deserved the comfort. So he went back to sleep.
“Huh.” Sam blinked, looking back as the bartender placed the three beers in front of him. “I guess I am a wingman.” He brought out his wallet, threw a quietly surprised look at Cas and Dean, then handed the bartender the money, plus some tip. “Thank you.”
Dean nodded, opening the passenger door for Cas, who thanked him and got in. Cas continued. “I’ve never- I haven’t been in a car before. I usually just-” he snapped his fingers, “- get where I need to be.”
Cas rubbed the back of his neck, focused on the floor, then on Deans shoes. They looked pretty cool, actually. Maybe he would ask to borrow them.
, Cas?” He winked as Cas blushed, then picked up the angel, carrying him to the back seat of the Impala.
Dean had spent the last year convincing himself that it wasn’t real.
Dean laughed, kissing Cas quickly. “No, it’s okay. You look cute in them.” He watched Cas blush and Dean sighed. “You and your sex hair are gonna make me come at you for round two.”
Dean broke the kiss and put their foreheads together. “Jesus, Cas,” he muttered, a smile tugging at his lips. “You beat me to the confession.”
Cas blinked before chuckling. He followed Dean with a bit of a smile. “Um… We could go back to the motel,” Cas said, just loud enough for Dean to hear.
this was... what 3000 words long???? incredible. i think i'm gonna sleep until the next update.
Dean listened quietly, his chest full of warmth, and he decided that he could have kissed Cas right there, just for those words alone. Instead, he watched as Cas turned toward him and opened his eyes. The blue he was met with was deafening, the visual equivalent of an ocean roaring in his ears.
Cas turned from his spot, where he was staring at his thumbs from a desk in the corner of the motel room. Sam had left, saying he was getting some painkillers, claiming that whiskey couldn’t numb Deans side forever. “What?”
“You’re being weird. Over an angel. Like dad didn’t talk about them all the time. Like they don’t show up every year.” He nodded his head towards Cas. “No offence to you, but- What’s up with this one, Dean?”
“Oh!” Dean’s whole face went an embarrassingly bright shade of red. “Sorry, I- I wasn’t calling you by your, uh, species? Like, not the same as you calling me ‘human’, but like a-a pet name- this is embarrassing, okay, I can stop if you want-”
Dean smacked Cas’ arm, laughing. “Cas! Playing the role of a rebellious teenager.” He exclaimed, raising an eyebrow.
Cas was seated on the hood of the Impala, Dean next to him. Their hands were resting between them, their fingers barely touching as they looked out at the stars. The Impala was parked on a gravel path, looking out over a large field, which Dean had described as a park. There was a handful of people out and around the park, and Cas could see what looked like a playground far off to his right.
Sam had found out that Dean prayed every night, and almost every spare moment, to Cas. He only prayed out loud once, when he didn’t know Sam was listening, and Sam left immediately. He felt like he was reading someone's text messages to a room full of strangers.
“I don’t want you to go.”
Deans hand landed on Cas’ shoulder.
Cas laughed, and Dean already missed the sound. He watched as the angel’s hand left his arm. He felt a little cold. “I’ll be back. I-If that’s okay.”
“This is a dare, I can tell. Look, just tell them I figured it out.” He shrugged and took a sip of his soda.
He had pretty much avoided his friends entirely while the Winchesters were staying with him, for no other reason than he hadn’t felt especially inclined to be around them. It wasn’t that he didn’t miss them—more that he had been careful until now to keep his time with the Garrison from overlapping with his time with the Winchesters, and it just seemed best to keep it that way. He had essentially disappeared from whatever radar they had him on. He remembered Gabriel’s suggestion that he bring anyone he was seeing around, but he also remembered Anna’s cold shoulder that still hadn’t quite let up. He still hadn’t seen her either. He showed up at work, but he usually arrived before the others since he had chosen to walk to avoid being stuck in the car with them, and left earlier in order to make it to work on time. He either worked through lunch or took it after they did. He wasn’t really surprised Anna still hadn’t spoken to him—she could be incredibly stubborn when she set her mind to it, and he hadn’t really done anything to ease tensions between them. He promised himself he would fix things once he was sure that Sam and Dean could go back home and be all right.
Castiel smiled a little from behind his mug, glad to hear the warmth back in Dean’s voice.
Castiel opened his eyes again, “I used to. I miss my grandmother from time to time. But I’ve realized long ago that my father was never very interested in being a father. Not to me. So after a while, I just stopped. I was the same age as Sam is now when my grandmother died, and I didn’t have time to waste on wishes that weren’t going to come true. The Garrison helped with that. Gave me a place to fit for a while.” He sighed and moved to change the subject, “What are we doing out here?”
Because he was friendly. It had been one of his selling points when he was trying to get himself hired. And on the rare occasion he was asked to man the store when Claire or Jody were sick, he could sell something to almost anyone who walked through the door.
They had spoken at the same time, and both stopped when they realized they had. It was an old habit of theirs. Neither of them ever knew what to say until they did.
There was the possibility that Dean was backed up with other jobs, more oil changes or tire rotations, whatever it was that mechanics did, and hadn’t gotten to his bike at all. Despite the fact that he felt a little bad he hadn’t shown up after a few days to check-in, particularly when he remembered the earnest way Dean had asked him about it, he eased his guilt by telling himself that if ever Anna finally forgave him for whatever it was she was specifically angry about, everything would be fine. Dean would probably forget he existed once his bike was finished and Castiel paid him, whereas Anna would still (probably) be his oldest friend.
Dean had to bite his tongue to keep himself from making any rude remarks, and took a moment to collect himself as he stuffed his key back in his pocket, before he plastered a fake smile on his face and finally looked up into drown-you-blue eyes.
Castiel rolled his eyes and sighed, “I’ll be sure to remember to shave the next time we have impromptu sex.”
“Lighten up, will you? Let’s just have some fun while we can.”
Castiel turned, a bit startled, and found Coffee, black, two shots espresso, leaned casually against the wall next to him. His earpiece was resting on his shoulder again, and his arms were crossed over his chest.
Dean must have caught the look of terror in his eyes when the lightning struck, because he moved closer to him and smoothed Castiel’s hair from his face, “Shhh, Cas,” gently, he brought him to his chest, “Come here.” He shifted, and situated Castiel’s legs so that they were facing one another, Castiel’s knees up by Dean’s hips. He hugged him, but kept their embrace loose enough that Castiel could easily pull away if he wanted.
“I thought we should invite you to dinner, but someone didn't think you'd want to come tonight. But one of these days, you'll have to come over and Dean will cook for both of us.” He gave a pointed glance in Dean's direction, and when Castiel looked at him, he was a little surprised to see that Dean’s eyes were on the steering wheel, and, he looked almost embarrassed.
“Dean, that isn’t what I meant and you know it. You just…” Castiel’s eyes were fixed to his, like he could find whatever it was that he wanted to say in them. “You’re so beautiful,” he said finally.
If he was honest, he wasn’t even sure he liked him. Of course, there was the obvious- he liked looking at him, liked watching him—what was not to like—but they didn’t know one another. Castiel had never stuck around long enough to try to get to know him because he had always been too worried about giving himself away. He had never really bothered to try to get to know anyone outside of the Garrison before, had never really cared to, and the idea that he now had an opening to try to get to know Dean, whatever the outcome might have been, was a little daunting.
Dean looked momentarily surprised, but gave him a wry grin, “You sure?” His hand was at the ignition.
Dean laughed, “So you just let some guy put his mouth on you because the picture wasn’t that good? Was he at least good-looking?”
“Oh yeah?”

We get the steam 😏
“That’s enough, Josiah,” his voice came out even rougher than usual, and he had to clear his throat before he continued. “Anna’s right. Starting a war over something so… trivial,” it hurt to say that too, because to him it wasn’t trivial, but in the grand scheme it was, “… makes no sense. There has been relative peace lately, and as long as we’re beating them in street races, and they aren’t crossing any real lines, there’s no point in doing anything drastic.”
“Thanks, got it,” Dean called. “You wanna talk about it?” Dean asked gently as he turned his attention back to Castiel, his thumb rubbing back and forth over the bones in Castiel’s neck. It was too dark to make out much, but Castiel imagined his expression was as soft as his voice had been.
Now, with no soldiers, no battles, no Vietnamese people to photograph going about their daily lives, nights stretched on endlessly, and even if he managed a few good hours, the rest of them were riddled with horrors. He usually woke either drenched in sweat or so near tears and trembling that he could barely see, let alone hold his lighter. It was a kind of hell he hadn’t yet grown accustomed to, but one that he was slowly learning to live with, so long as he didn’t spend too much time in the company of other people. Even awake, he found he was prone to drifting off like he had with Sam at dinner, though he thought that he was able to avoid that for the most part if he kept busy. He just needed to find work soon and lose himself in it. He stripped out of his pants and shirt, and pulled his bag into his lap while he sat cross legged on the floor in his undershirt and shorts. He dug through it until he found the thick leather folder that served as his portfolio. He flipped through it, each one a look at people and places he had found interesting while he’d been in Vietnam. A lot of them were candids—he liked to observe and catch people looking the way they did when they weren’t worried about what others thought about them—but some of them were posed. There were waving soldiers, gap-toothed and grinning children, and stern-faced officers. He only had his best ones printed, but he knew that if he lined every photograph he had ever taken end to end, there would be a clear progression of skill. He had gotten better a little at a time, and it was a mild source of pride for him that he had managed to make something of himself. He reached the back of the portfolio and ran his fingers along the back cover to lift a flap that was meant to hold a resume or some other document.
Dean shrugged, “I have before. I know how.”
The nightmares made him feel like he might as well have taken up arms. The ache he still had in his thigh where a bullet had torn through muscle and flesh made him feel that way too. “I was there on assignment.”
“Do you play?” he asked as soon as Dean handed him his beer.
Castiel did as he was told, though his frown didn’t lift, and he felt Dean settle his hands on his shoulders so he could steer him where he wanted him to go. If Castiel didn’t trust him so implicitly, he might have been nervous walking blind through a strange shop filled with all sorts of tools that would have been unpleasant to run into even if he had been able to see.
“Well?” He took a long drink from the bottle. “Has Bobby put him to work yet?”
“Sam?” Castiel’s eyes grew wide, and Sam’s smile grew with them.
“Yeah, well, when you said you were going to get him up, I guess I didn’t realize which part of him you were talking about,” Sam said flatly. He furrowed his brows, “Happy birthday, by the way, Cas. Looks like it’s working out for you so far. I’ve gotta get to class, but I’ll see you this evening, okay?” He cast Dean a disapproving look, “I left everything covered in the oven to keep it warm.”
“See you later, Sammy.” Dean closed the door for him, and immediately pressed Castiel against it, so he could pick up where they left off.
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s middle and tucked his chin over his shoulder, “Anna isn’t my ex.”
"Tell me why you just left like that. Why you never came back for me."
It’s not that he’s ungrateful. He’s not. He knows how lucky he is to do what he does.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shrugged, “If you’re insistent though, I guess we can swing by and I can show you what I’ve done with your bike so far. It’s not much, I still don’t have all the parts, but if you’re interested-”
His mother had always told him that feathers were lucky. And when things had gotten hard, and he’d had nowhere to turn, he always looked for feathers. When he found them, sometimes it meant he lucked into a nice meal, or simply found shelter just as it started to rain. Whatever it was, and whether or not it really meant anything, when Dean found a feather, he took it at face-value, and looked for the good things in life where he could find them.
“Just... “he sighed again, “I’ll bring him along some other time.” He still liked the idea of keeping Dean and the Garrison separate, but the spheres were drawing ever closer to one another, and he knew that eventually they’d cross again. Dean was their go-to mechanic, so it wasn’t like they weren’t already touching. It was just that Castiel wanted to protect him as well as himself from everything that would come with people being more aware of their closeness. Even if they didn’t admit it outright, Castiel had the feeling that people could see it on him—how much he wanted Dean, how it was easier for him to be around Sam and Dean Winchester than it was for him to be around the people he had known for most of his life. It made him feel vulnerable and exposed, and those were things he wasn’t used to feeling around the Garrison.
That's a wrap, folks! How's everyone feeling?
“Cas, I-”
“Hey, mister,” Dean said breathlessly when Castiel had finally found enough self-control to pull away from him. He had that teasing lilt to his voice that let Castiel know he was about to get wise with him, “Aren’t you happy with the services I’ve provided? I expect to be paid in full.”
Castiel’s flush deepened and he scowled, “You’re one to talk. Anyway, I can’t help it.” Having Dean call him ‘Mister Novak,’ hadn’t helped much either. Nor did the way Dean rolled his hips when he leaned in to kiss him, this time full on the mouth. Castiel managed to free his hands enough to interlace their fingers, though he didn’t bother moving them from above his head. He’d wanted to belong to Dean. He’d give himself to him anyway he’d let him. Dean pulled away and grinned down at him, and Castiel’s heart tripped all over the inside of his chest as Dean pulled his shirt over his head, and then walked the fingers of one of his hands down Castiel’s still-clothed chest. He made quick work of the fly on Castiel’s pants, and never seemed the slightest bit concerned that they were together this way in broad daylight. He hadn’t been sure he was really prepared to attempt anything so scandalous in such an open place, but he found his body had been much more willing to do what his mind had established as a bad idea. The only problem being that Dean’s weight was suddenly gone from him, and he laughed as Castiel sat bolt upright, “You didn’t think I’d be that easy, did you, Cas?” He was grinning, “Catch me, and see if you win a prize, hm?”
“All right, now that’s settled,” Gabriel broke the tension, his brows lifted, “What say we go find ourselves a party? Ingrid’s gotta break her jacket in, and I’m overdue for a good sloshing.” There was a cheer, and even Castiel couldn’t help but look amused. He wanted to beg off and slink back to his apartment where he could be alone with his thoughts about Dean and everything that had gone on that day, but he had already arrived late, so he needed to make an effort for another hour or so before he could plausibly excuse himself.
“You’re not exactly a chatterbox, yourself,” Dean shot back. “I’m lucky to get ten words outta you on a good day.”
Dean looked up at that, his eyes a little bigger than they probably should have been to really sell the lie, but as far as Castiel was concerned, it was the truth. Anna and Gabe had been bothering him to bring Dean around, and they were already on their way out. There was no need to mention that they’d already eaten. Judging by the look on Dean’s face, it would have rocked the boat a little too much for comfort.
Dean doesn’t know his name, but he wants to.
Castiel shook his head and Dean sighed. He seldom told Dean about the things he dreamed, reluctant to relive any part of the horrors he sometimes saw when he closed his eyes. He cleared his throat, “It… I think it was just the thunder. Startled me. I’ll be fine. I need to smoke.” He unfolded himself and took a deep breath as he shifted to put his feet on the floor.
Anna sighed again and shook her head in a way that meant that if he was going to continue to be so stubborn she wasn’t going to be able to tolerate it for much longer. She started for the car and Castiel called her name before she opened the door. She turned to look at him, brown eyes curious.
“I’m always scared,” Castiel told him, honestly.  “Dean, I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified of you since the day I set eyes on you. You know that. Because you just… You can look at me, and I want to move mountains for you.”
“Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint,” Dean said meanly. “I stayed a townie.”
It was completely infuriating, and Castiel gripped Dean, who had busied himself with placing kisses along his abdomen, by his hair and forced him to look up at him. “If you don’t let me finish, I’m going to show you exactly how a gentleman deals with being denied,” he ground out. Dean had been teasing him all night, both verbally and physically, and to make the current situation all the more infuriating, he looked amused rather than cowed by Castiel’s threat.
By the time everyone had gone, and Sam and Dean had more or less cleaned up the apartment, Castiel was just drunk enough to fall directly asleep once Dean had helped him clean up and tucked him in. He rarely drank, had never much cared for it, but he’d wanted to enjoy himself, and he liked the look on Dean’s face when he’d stolen a swig of his beer without asking. “Was a very happy birthday,” he’d muttered as he drifted off, the feel of Dean’s lips still warm on his forehead.
He cut him off, “I left that night, Dean. And everything from that point in my life forward revolved around the fact that you weren’t there. Because I thought you would be. You promised me that you would be.”
Castiel let his head fall back against the car, the heat from the sun-warmed metal seeping through to his scalp. It reminded him of Dean’s hand on his jaw- weeks ago at this point- and he scowled at the thought. “I know. I’m okay,” he told her. It wasn’t what he wanted to say, but he didn’t know how to tell her what he wanted or needed. He couldn’t imagine telling her that he wanted to leave town, that the thought that he could leave one day was sometimes all that got him through the day. He didn’t know how to explain to her that he had been avoiding them, not just because he needed the space—to think, to breathe—but because the only person he had ever really wanted for himself in his entire life was someone he simply wasn’t allowed to have. For more reasons than he could possibly count. He wanted to tell her; he just couldn’t.
Chapter 5 is finally up! I liked writing this chapter, though sometimes it felt like I'd never get it finished. I like the back and forth between Dean and Cas, but I also really enjoy writing Sam and Cas centered scenes. His relationships with Anna and the others can also be fun to write, and I like exploring things from Castiel's perspective. In the past, I've always been too afraid to write things from his viewpoint because the fact that he's not human in the show always made me a little nervous. I wasn't sure how that would translate into my own writing, and particularly while writing him as a human. But, this idea grabbed me, so I've been running with it.
Oh man, I can't believe I actually finished this before the end of the month. I mean, it was the goal, but a massive struggle for me. My birthday was last week, and my mom's birthday would be next week, so it has been a rough month over all, but this has been about the only thing I've been motivated to work on.
He nodded, and then seemed to notice Castiel’s presence for the first time, “Who the hell are you?”
Castiel nearly broke his neck with how quickly he turned to look at Dean at that question. He must have looked confused or something because Dean quickly followed up.
It was silly, but that commonality between them made him smile, and quieted some of his earlier doubts about the future of their relationship.
Castiel stopped to talk to him, and out of some subconscious level of respect, dropped his cigarette and rubbed it out with the toe of his boot even though he had scarcely finished half of it.
He had planned the entire thing out the night before, right down to what he would do if he got to the garage and Dean wanted absolutely nothing to do with him.
Sam knocked on the door a few minutes later, a party hat tilted jauntily on his head, nearly lost in the waves of his overgrown hair. “Hey, uh, Cas, can I come in?”
His mother pulled her fingers through his hair, and nodded carefully as he spoke to her and listed the practical reasons he should have Dean as a companion, rather than ones based on any feelings that might have been stirred in him by Dean’s tears or quiet gaze. It was the extent of her affection for him, for they seldom embraced or kissed one another. He eventually reasoned that it was as much to protect him as it was to protect herself from her husband’s wrath. He simply detested Castiel’s existence, which meant that he would feel the same about anyone who extended him more than standard courtesy.
“We weren't swimming naked, Dean. I'd just rather we come prepared than not.” Nevermind the fact that if skinny-dipping had been what had occurred, Castiel was sure they'd be having a very different conversation right then.
It didn't matter though, because the grin that Dean gave him was almost as goofy as he felt.
“Do you miss it?” he asked.
“You like baseball?” Sam’s brows were lifted, apparently genuinely curious about his answer.
“Hello, Anna.”
Dean put the sign back up, took Castiel by the hand and led him around the desk, “I think that went well. Though I know that look on Sammy’s face. He’s going to want to talk about our feelings later. Just you wait.”
So a week in, when he felt like his ears were going to start bleeding if he had to spend one more second in a car with any of them, he elected to walk home. It was something he hadn’t done since he had been a boy, and even then he had rarely been alone, usually walking home alongside Anna, so he thought that it was just what the doctor ordered.
Castiel’s fingers twitched, and he smoothed his hands down the sides of his pants a few times.
Castiel took a drink of his coffee and they ate in silence for some time before he asked the question that had been crowding his thoughts all morning, “Have you ever been with anyone else before?”
No one else had ever gotten close enough for Arete to approve or disapprove of them very much, but Castiel was pleased that she seemed to like Dean as much as he did.
He shuddered, but carried on like nothing had happened. “No, of course not. They’re all I’ve got. Even if they can be… tiring. I might not want to spend my whole life as a part of the Garrison, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care for them.”
There were a couple of guys, bottom-feeder types, wannabes that probably didn’t belong to a gang with any sort of credible reputation, if they belonged to any in the first place, hassling a gangly kid a few yards ahead of him. It wasn’t really an unusual scene, and on an average day, it was generally dependent upon Castiel’s mood whether he stepped in on a situation like this. The thing was, the kid, with his back pressed against the brick of the drugstore- his features somewhere between fiercely defiant and deeply offended- was the floppy-haired, younger Winchester.
"Cas," Sam shifted to look at him, "what exactly happened between you two? When I got back from Bobby's that summer, you were just gone. And I'd never seen Dean like he was...he never talked about you, not even when I asked. Just said that you had gone. It was almost like you'd never existed, except that I knew you had. And I knew how happy you'd made him."
The look on Dean’s face amused him, but he didn’t push. He found that Dean responded better when he didn’t try to force things. Castiel turned his attention back to the birds to hear what else they had to say to him. It wasn’t like talking to people; he really had to listen to understand what animals wanted to communicate, but he had learned the patience for it over the years. It was more like when he spoke to Dean, though he didn’t think he was very good at that yet—while he felt the birds understood him, he was never quite sure whether Dean did. And it was only Dean’s sudden appearance before him that broke his concentration again. He’d turned his back on him to listen to the birds, and Dean had come around and gently tugged at the front of his tunic in the way Castiel had come to realize meant that he wanted his attention for a specific reason.
Castiel felt his heart sink in his chest. He dreaded this conversation. Despite Dean’s reassurances that he wanted him, there was always a tiny part of Castiel that told him he wasn’t good enough for someone like Dean, that eventually he’d wake up and realize he was tired of him.
A lot happens.
Castiel tilted his head, “Much the same, I suppose. I wouldn’t say I’ve settled, no. I don’t think I’d be here if that was the case.”
If some street punk didn’t kill him first, Dean Winchester would be the death of him.
“Sam, no,” Castiel sighed, “It just caught me off guard. It’s fine. Your brother… had already given me a shock not too much earlier. I just wasn’t ready for another one quite so soon,” it wasn’t quite the truth, but not really a lie either.
Castiel barely had time to process what was happening, or how Sam had managed to notice he was there, before Dean was coming for him next. There was a look in Dean’s eyes that Castiel had never seen before—something impish and determined, and wholly arousing—and Castiel knew instantly that if Dean got a hold of him, he was absolutely done for.
Sam picked them up, as planned, and they drove to Dean’s apartment toward the edge of the city. They laughed, and talked, and Castiel and Sam attempted to make dinner for the three of them because, despite all the time that had passed, Sam hadn’t forgotten the last conversation he’d had with Castiel. They were supposed to have had a family dinner that Dean didn’t have to cook, and he reasoned that Castiel was probably more family now than he had ever been. Dean found their efforts painful to watch, and ended up taking on the role of head chef so he could boss them around and tell them what they were doing wrong, which he made up to Castiel for several minutes while Sam set the table.
“Did you see the looks on their faces?” Dean started the truck and “Rock Around the Clock,” crackled through the speakers.
But he didn’t. He couldn’t.
Dean was quiet for a long time, and the only sound in the room was that of the storm outside their window, no sign of letting up anytime soon. “Okay,” he said finally.
“Well, I mean, it’s just that Sam’s not gonna be home for me to get dinner ready for, and I kind of owe you for helping him before… I’m almost finished up here, so I thought if you wanted to wait around, I could buy you a drink. Or… you don’t have to, I mean, I just thought I’d ask. I don’t go out much, so it’s probably not really a good idea anyway.”
“What are you doing?” Castiel questioned Dean while one of the other guys was racking up. “You do understand that they’re probably regulars here, and the two of us don’t stand a chance against the two of them? I don’t have fifty dollars to piss away.” He didn’t mean to sound as irritable as he did, but this was not what he intended when he agreed to come out with him, and despite being a decent pool player himself, he wasn’t confident enough in Dean’s abilities to place a bet on them.
“Well, then can you get me a date, at least?” She nudged him in the ribs with her elbow.  “I know I was steamed the other night, and he was kind of a mess, but he’s a real flutter-bum, you know? Good-looking as the day is long. Even with the bruises.” She sounded vaguely wistful in a way that reminded Castiel that Anna, for all her hard-edged bravado, was not immune to the charms of men.
“Hey, hey, Cas, shh, it’s okay.” Dean’s voice was groggy, and Castiel jumped at his  touch, still not totally aware of his surroundings.
Her mouth twisted slightly, “Damn. Well, it’s not surprising. Guy like that can’t possibly be hurting for dates.”
A shudder ran through Dean, and Castiel squeezed him briefly to let him know he wasn't going to have to face this sort of thing alone if he didn't want to. Maybe Dean had started as his mechanic, but the more time he spent with the Winchesters, the more he found himself wanting to maintain their relationship, even once Dean was done with his bike.
Skepticism colored Castiel’s features as he glanced up at him.
“I saw his bruises, Castiel. You expect me to believe he doesn’t-”
Dean didn’t say anything else, just did as Castiel asked, kissed and touched him until he had almost forgotten that it was raining at all. And when Dean finally slid into him, just as slowly and carefully as he had done everything else that night, Castiel could think of nothing else. They didn’t usually do things this way, mostly because he found it completely overwhelming to have Dean inside of him. He’d never have been able to function on a daily basis if they did it like this every time. He wanted him slower and he wanted him faster; he wanted it to go on forever, and he wanted it to end right away, and no matter what he did, or how good it felt, he didn’t think his body would ever be able to process it all at once. It was a feeling he didn’t have words for, one he didn’t think he’d ever find words for no matter how often he allowed Dean inside of him this way, and it was the absolute perfect distraction from everything he didn’t want to think about, simply because he couldn’t think at all.
“That’s the only picture of us all together.”
Castiel smiles almost lazily, “You make us sound like saints. Like angels.” He reaches out and lets his hand settle on top of Dean’s wrist, draws his fingers down over his knuckles as he leans forward, “I like the way you see it though. You remind me of why I like flying.”
“Castiel!?”
“If we don’t clean up, you won’t thank me for it later. I’ll come right back.” He wiped his face with the back of his hand and took a deep breath. He hadn’t realized he’d been crying. It was certainly something that had never happened with anyone else he’d been with, and he wondered if they were tears of grief or of joy. He wasn’t really sure where one began and the other ended when it came to things with Dean.
“You ruined me for everyone,” he murmured. He leaned in and kissed Castiel softly.
Castiel gave Dean a lift back to the garage so he could pick up his truck. Despite the hand that Dean had discreetly snuck under his shirt when he had climbed on behind him, and the way the feel of Dean’s fingers against his skin as they rode gave him goosebumps, he couldn’t help the sinking that came over him as they pulled up at the garage.
So, Chapter title: We Belong Together- Ritchie Valens (1959) I actually had a really difficult time picking a title for this one, but this song just seemed to fit the best when I thought of it.
“I missed you too,” Dean whispered against his ear. He ran his hands back and forth through Castiel’s already unruly hair, kissed the shell of his ear. “I’m not letting you go again,” he tilted Castiel’s head up and gave him a brief kiss as he reached down to unzip his pants.
“Our old man,” Dean started, recoiling a little when Castiel dabbed the cut on his lip, “...is a real son of a bitch sometimes.”
Bobby grunted, “Well, come on in. Got it all packaged up neat for you. It was a bitch to find, by the way. Might as well have some lunch while you’re here.”
“Usually,” Dean started, his eyes flicking to Sam in the rearview, “that would be the case. But since
Catching rides to work with Gabe or Inias was something Castiel decided he absolutely never wanted to do again. Of course, he had ridden with them to various places in the past, and he had been prepared for the close quarters because too many of them were piled into one vehicle. That was tolerable, as he was usually in the front seat instead of cramped between any of the others in the back. But what he absolutely couldn’t stand, and what made him miss his motorcycle more than anything, was all of the
Sam pressed his lips together in that way that made his dimples stand out unflatteringly, and sighed through his nose, “Fine. Whatever. Just make sure you put it back after you wash it.” He rolled his shoulders and ran his hands over his hair, “So, then, what’s the plan? We just keep going until we make some money and hope we don’t burn half our guests to a crisp in the process? Or do we spend whatever we have left, and hope we can make it all back before the bank comes for us?”
“What?” Dean asked distractedly.
“Yes, ‘Really,’” he mimicked. “I finished top of my class, Sammy. Have a little faith. And he, uh, owes me a favor. Anyway, it’s gonna cost us supplies and time, not labor, and everyone knows that’s the gut punch. So, we’ll be fine.” He finished his last bite of pie, and stood up, lifting the plate, fork, and his eyebrows for emphasis, to show Sam he intended to take it away to wash.
They parted, and Castiel went to inspect the bike, his hands sliding over every curve, while Dean went and found Jack again. Castiel listened while he explained where the bike had come from, and how it had been used as a stunt bike on various film sets. When he finished, Castiel shook his hand, and then, just because there was nowhere left for his feelings to go, he hugged him too.
“No.” He surprised himself with the speed and certainty of his own answer. Especially considering that he had entertained that very same thought not so long ago. “I don’t want either of them near the Garrison. And they don’t want to be anyway.” He sighed, “They’re my friends too, all right? Maybe I should have told you that I’ve been spending time with them, but I just… they don’t want anything to do with what we do. And I like that about them. I… like how I feel when I’m with them.”
And there’s so much emotion there—Dean just always
“Doesn’t he?” Castiel took the shirt from Sam, who looked like Castiel had just slapped him for no reason. Castiel sighed, and reached over to put his cigarette out in the ashtray he had brought out with him. Of course he had said the wrong thing. Didn’t he usually?
After he had peeled off his work shirt and made dinner for himself (which consisted of baked beans and leftover cornbread that had stretched the limits of his ability when he made it), he sat in the window, and debated about going next door to borrow the phone and call Anna. At lunch, he had half-convinced himself that he could tell her about his feelings toward Dean, and why exactly it was that he wanted to keep them separate. Maybe he’s even work up enough nerve to tell her about his feelings toward one day leaving The Garrison. On the other hand, a simple apology on his part would probably be enough to soften her, despite the fact that he had meant what he said. He was tired of her avoidance.
“I think I like this… the second date.”
Dean got up and started packing his gear, filling shells with salt and sharpening his knives, just in case. “What was what?” He countered, giving Sam a weird look. “I just asked the guy if he was okay. He’s got a war on his hands, Sam.”
He's so blissfully, absolutely happy, he doesn't have words.
He's alone.
“Jack got me out, as soon as he took over,” Cas clarifies, “I wasn't there for long. We proceeded to restructure heaven, teared down all the walls, made it new and whole again. It practically runs itself now, with some tweaks to the infrastructure.”
“Sam puked all the way from the exit point until you hit the atmosphere?”
“Dean--” Cas says, almost shocked with the sudden movement, but when his head hits Dean's jacket and the corner of the door and backrest, understanding dawns on his face. Dean is pulled down into grinning lips while still sorting out their legs.
But safety systems are there precisely to deal with the unheard of.
They always had each other. And Dean can finally allow himself to breathe, to enjoy this, to touch and to openly love. He just needs to cope.
Dean leans down, places a kiss on Cas' temple, rests his forehead against it.
It hits Dean all at once, and at least he can look at Cas now without coming his brains out right this second. For now. “You know I never blew a guy, ever.”
“That? A virus, a few generations ago,” Eileen smiles. “My people aren’t hearing.”
, Sam. How are we supposed to find mom on a planet where she might be, among billions of people that look Terran, but aren’t? We know nothing about how she lived, lives, who she might have met… we got nothing.”
Dean leans his hip against the small table in the kitchen, crosses his arms in front of his chest, and Cas deflates, too. With both hands at the sink behind him, he watches Dean carefully.
It's not like it matters. Sometime between learning that angels are dicks and one does not fit with the others--
Dean is beyond happy to announce this particular arrival, and hollers through the silent Roadhouse, “Well, if it isn't Donna Hanscum!”
And yet, Dean wants to make this happen. It just scares the shit out of him.
Dean sighs, and Cas' hand twitches in his, like he wanted to reach.
Dean shrugs with a lopsided smile. “I guess you could say I had it coming.” The second time around, Dean has to admit that he kind of likes the liquor.
Cas has a dopey grin on his face, and Dean knows he probably looks no better himself, so he pulls Cas upwards, kisses his own taste off of his lips.
Can't think beyond Cas, in his arms, can't think beyond his own hands, clutched around Cas' shoulders. Dean puts his feet apart, lines them up properly, grinds his thigh between Cas' legs as Cas meets his every move with a tilt of his hips.
And oh, the words 'penetrative sex' out of Cas' mouth should not be as hot and bothering as they are. Dean swallows. “I didn't mean to uh, talk it down. It was our first time together, after all.”
“Jack,” Chuck pats his grandson's shoulder, who startles. “Would you do the honors?”
Did you notice that this fic is like 95 % dialogue? Well. We need a break. Enjoy!
'You are not your anger, Dean,' Cas said, and he's right. He's not. Even though he always doubted good intentions making up for bad results and casualties.
“Cas, I swear, if you say something about you not being my type again, I’m gonna whack you with a spoon,” Dean mumbles, sleepily.
And Dean has had no qualms whatsoever about going over to Sam and then leaving again.
So Dean rubs over his rim a few times, lets him enjoy that sweet sensation he loves so much when Cas does it to him, doesn't dip his finger into him – no lube, no fun – but prods the pad of his finger against it at every other thrust of Cas' hips, just for a bit of pressure.
Cas is as in over his head as Dean is.
To Bobby and Rufus.
Cas shakes his head, his eyes closed. “You would only be able to see my wings in my true form, which I would advise against, and my true form does not match this vessel.”
The meal itself isn't half bad. The food, of course, is fantastic, but conversation is easy enough as well, talking about their houses, what they spend their time doing, about the Roadhouse. Just chatter between bites of food.
Because Sam is his own person. So is Dean.
He rubs his hand over his mouth. He's screwed, isn't he.
Castiel pulls boxer briefs over muscular, hairy legs, then steps into his pressure pants and a shirt that hugs his body tight around his chest and… well, that ass is something Dean noticed, obviously, but in those pants—
“Me? I'm just here, watching over the souls in my charge.”
When he turns around, he doesn't expect Cas to slam him up against the fridge in one fell swoop. There's hands at Dean's waist and Cas' mouth on his and the kiss is quick and insistent and promises a later and something dirty and Dean finds himself less weirded out by stubble against his cheeks than he thought he would.
“Finally found your way in, huh, Dean Winchester?” Ellen shouts, laughter around his name.
“If you say you're not worthy of being an angel, I swear I'll kick your ass,” Dean threatens, reflexively.
He can do a date with Cas.
A naked
Mary gets up to clean the table, and Sam hurries to help her. They're still in earshot, since the dinner table is in the room right next to the open kitchen, but at least there's the illusion of less people listening in on them, now.
Dean huffed a laugh and kissed Cas again. “Please.” He licked his lips. Cleared his throat. Tried again. “
He kissed Cas softly, only pausing to close the door behind them. “Anything you want, Cas,” he murmured. “I’ll give you anything you want.”
Cas put a hand on the side of Deans face, tilting his head up slightly. “You’ll be fine,” he murmured, eyes tracing Dean’s features. “I’ll talk to you so much, you’ll be sick of me before I even get back.”
The weird look Dean gave him only made Cas laugh wearily. He complied, though.
“I think that’s a good idea,” Cas replies, still looking at their intertwined hands, before Dean starts walking. He follows, and thinks, this isn’t quite the same normal he had gotten comfortable with. This wouldn’t have happened before. Maybe an arm around the shoulder, but not this.
“No,” Cas murmurs, immediately trying to figure out what he should do. No grace, so he can’t do anything to the security guard. He’s fast, but soon his vessel would tire, and he would have to stop and get caught. He keeps running, turning his head to see if he can catch a glimpse of Dean. He wouldn’t leave him behind, would he?
Dean pulled back and grinned at him, one eyebrow raised. “Hmm… the
Dean’s laugh was loud, and Cas watched with a small smile as some of the tension melted from the man's shoulders.
PLEASE READ!!!!
Dean stared at Cas with his mouth open. Then he let out a groan of a laugh. “You fucking- Jesus, Cas, you’re-” He kept laughing, and Cas rolled over so he was next to Dean on the blanket again. He intertwined their hands. “That’s a whole year. Usually, the third date is within a
Dean was shaking his head, unable to understand where this was coming from. “Cas, no, what’s happening? Is there something you’re not telling me?” He couldn’t wrap his head around the difference in the angels reaction to his injury now and in the past. His own voice had grown louder, his yelling more confused than anything. “Why are you-”
Cas laughed, and– did Dean even have to explain at this point? It made him feel like he could fly. “I’ll put that on my to do list for next year,” he responded, smiling gently as he pulled Dean closer.
“I love you, too.” Cas kissed him, long and slow, before pulling back and resting his forehead against Dean’s. “And I miss you, so much. All the time.” He smiled sadly.
Dean grinned, hands in the pockets of his leather jacket. “Dean Winchester. Nice to meet you, Novak.”
A laugh from Cas, and Dean involuntarily bit his lip.
This time, they’d hunted something like a shapeshifter, though the lore and it’s powers were a little different. It turned into whatever it’s victims feared, cycling through their worst fears and using those to render them powerless until it could kill them. Each person saw something different when looking at it. Sam saw harrowing things: Dean on fire, back in hell; Bobby’s death; Jess, then his mom, burning on the ceiling.
But… They left. Cas left.
“You’re taking him to the park, right? I swear to God, Dean, this is obviously some sort of soulmate thing, and if you fuck this up for yourself-”
Dean glared at him halfheartedly. “Sh-shut up, Angel. You’re- this is so unfair.” He groaned and buried his face in Cas’ shoulder, turning red as Castiel’s laugh filled the room. “You’re the worst. The absolute worst.”
Dean expected Cas to laugh a little, maybe crack a lovingly teasing joke, but the angel seemed to be as adamant as he was about not letting go.“I missed you,” Cas murmured in between kisses. “Even though I could speak to you, I-”
He could almost feel Cas stiffen and sigh. It brought a smile to his face. Dean had learned, over many nights, that his prayers didn’t need to be holy to get through to the angel. In fact, since he’d figured it out, he’d tortured Cas with thoughts and images that would send the angel short circuiting.
“Here!” He exclaimed, proudly showing off his car, grinning at Castiel, who let out a low whistle.
One more kiss– and Cas disappeared.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Looking at me like that.” Dean kissed him again, then pulled back, groaning as Cas did exactly that. “You’re making me so nervous.”
Alrighty, thank you sm for reading!! I love you (yes, YOU)!! Feel free to leave me a comment or check out my other destiel works while you wait for the next chapter ;) Thank you for starting this lil journey with me <3
And as the sky darkened and the clock reached 6:01pm, Dean heard a soft
“Dean.”
“Nope.”
Dean stuttered through a reply, unable to say anything that sounded right. So, he sighed, and took Sam's hand, placing it on Cas’ shoulder, where it promptly went straight through. Then, he ignored Sam’s face (if “duh” was an expression, it’s exactly what Sam looked like) and placed his own hand on the angel’s shoulder, where it landed firmly.
Dean rolled his eyes, murmuring “Shut up and kiss me, Cass,” before crashing his lips against the others.
“Cas,” Dean said, grinning again. Cas could feel Dean’s body shake as he laughed. The alley was small enough that they were pressed chest to chest, faces inches apart. Cas blinked and a thought popped into his head.
Dean nods, and peeks out of the alley, stepping out once he’s satisfied that no one is there, waiting to ambush them. “Okay,” he says, holding his hand out without a second thought. Cas’ eyebrows rise at the gesture, but he gladly slips his hand in Dean’s. He feels his own pulse stutter. “Back to the motel? Sam’s probably waiting.”
“Because I love you, Dean!”
Nodding, Cas glanced at him. “And what about on- with a second date. What do people do?”
And there it was. (Maybe all that practice helped.)
Dean cut him off.
The angel hesitantly opened his arms, and Dean collapsed into them. First hug. With an angel. His life was turning out to be so goddamn weird.
And as Dean checks himself, he notices. There's a small, but very visible hickey on his neck, right above his collar bone, right beneath his field of view.
“No, and if he had, you know I would've handled it,” his Mom chuckles. “No, don't worry about me, or us. He was pretty quiet at first, and then he started asking me questions. When I knew, when I suspected, if you told me.”
who has nothing to do with any of this, who flew eight hours just to get parts for Baby, as a
Castiel has him on the brink of orgasm in no time, and with both their hands around each other’s cocks, slipping, sliding together, skin hot, burning, he realizes he can’t look away — is still looking straight into Castiel’s eyes when he hits his orgasm, hard.
"Yeah, well. Suck it up. Grocery run as soon as Crowley’s money is in?"
Dean walks backwards to the door, points at Cas. “Like throw you on that bed and get all of those clothes off of you again.”
That, to Dean's surprise, gets an eyeroll out of all three of them.
that he-- that
And he'd have Cas under him, and Dean will be his first and there's his possessive streak again. There's that kick about being in charge, showing Cas how good it can feel. Hopefully.
They work around each other much like when they cleaned up the garage – silent and completely in sync, even better than they were in a fist fight, like the winning team they've been for how many years? Dean has to admit, it's so easy. It's wonderful, having Cas in his space; it has his heart full and his mind going in circles. There's so much simmering between them, Dean doesn't even know where he should begin tackling it all.
Cas does, without questions.
So he tries to unclench. They’ll get to Sam in just two hours. They’ll be fine. The weight of the world drops off his shoulders, and judging by the sigh and slump of Castiel’s shoulders, he feels it, too.
“I showed you. She knows the truth. Someone like her among the vigilantes would greatly further our cause. Just like having you two would,” Crowley explains with barely restrained impatience.
“I know,” Sam groans, rubs his hand over his mouth. “Just… do it.”
It's more of a stretch in his jaw than he anticipated, but he doesn't get to dwell on that thought.
It's a beautiful scenery, mountains around him, the bridge crossing a wide river, water splashing over rocks as birds cry in the distance.
“I dunno, Sammy.”
With his head held high and no looking back, Castiel walks past her, and Dean can’t help but stare after him. His spine is rigid, there’s tension there, Dean sees it — but also an undeniable amount of confidence.
“You'll make do,” he says, his smile fond.
That's... weird.
Sam has a very hard time keeping in check what his face does. She’s stunning. Drop-dead gorgeous, stunning. “Hey, nice to see you. What’s up?” He tries to play it casual.
They work in silence for a while, just passing glasses and dishes back and forth, until Mary picks up the conversation again. “John and I, we had a lot of blanks to fill in. I missed so much even though I knew what had happened from what you and Sam and Cas told me, and from John's journal - but John also missed a huge part of your lifes. When I told him how many times you'd saved the world, he was speechless.”
For a moment, their eyes lock, and Cas opens and closes his mouth around words that don't quite make it.
“My own.”
He has no idea what happens next, and isn't that exhilarating?
For the younger survivors, the comparison was meaningless. The bomb, dropped over Shanghai, spread an atomic firestorm across the globe in a matter of hours, leaving their planet contaminated, uninhabitable and the survivors homeless.
Dean swallows. To this day, it's one of his better hookup experiences, and while the kink never occurred to him before that, he got it, that night. “There was... another girl. Just someone I picked up at a bar and she was already talking about me fucking her ass on the way to the car. Honestly, I did not know just how obsessed she was with it. In a good way, though. We barely got any foreplay in, she knew what she wanted, and I just laid there and watched her do all the work, prepare herself – which, since she didn't do this for the first time, took her like thirty seconds but, man, that was
There's a familiar face popping up at the end of the bar, and Dean hangs his head in relief.
Thank you for all of your kind comments! <3
Dean looks out at the lake, warm golden sunlight spilling out over the slow ripples across the surface. “Then what is that truth?”
Dean's spinning thoughts come to a screeching halt. He stares at Cas, at the lake, at the trees around their house, and at Cas again. “Makes sense, I guess,” he says with a flutter of his heart and leans over to kiss him. It might be obvious, but seems like he sometimes needs people to state the obvious so he gets it. “I just feel like I've only been dragging you around all the time. I want to do things you like to do for fun, too.”
But at least Donna is smiling again. “So, everyone has their place here?”
And if you want to spread the word on tumblr,
For a moment, he dares to think about them, in bed, naked. Who'd be the one to top? They could always switch, of course, but Dean squirms where he sits on the porch swing, just thinking about it. He needs to talk to Cas about it, and it's going to be awkward, but so what.
Cas is still standing between Dean's spread legs, which is not making things easier to conceal.
Dean’s insides are curling with heat. Just his name, who would’ve thought, that just his name would send him—
Cas is the one who pulls away. “Dean, should I--” And he looks down at Dean's open jeans, at the splash of spunk over Dean's t-shirt that dripped back down over underwear, dirty white drops covering his hand that's resting on Cas' thigh. “Oh,” Cas says, a regretful grin on his lips. “I see.”
The road is just like all the roads, in heaven. Long enough to enjoy the walk and the stars and Cas being here, but short enough to not arrive completely chilled to the bone.
(See the end of the chapter for
It's freedom and relief and it's not perfect, just like Dean thought it wouldn't be. There's awkward pauses and overenthusiastic nips that turn into bites. When Cas becomes too eager, he pulls back, lets him wait and reboots.
Dean wraps her up in his arms. He makes sure to lean back before he says, “I know. I miss him, too.”
Cas' eyes are closed and his breath is even. He's on his back, head tilted to the side, facial features relaxed and at peace. It's rare, seeing him like this.
He does it again. Up, teasing Cas for the longest time, then back down as much as he can – which isn't far.
His heaven just became a bit more complete.
Within a minute, Dean and Cas have a beer each, Jo argues with Dean over who gets to play the guitar first, Cas amicably settles for the drums, while Charlie explains the difference between 'hard' and 'pro' mode to Dean, and Ash rolls a blunt.
He can own that like he can own the damn hickey from last weekend.
Surprise and happy holidays to all of you!
And then he’s gone.
He likes the living room, though it takes some convincing to get Cas to accept the red sofa instead of the brown one they had before.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shut it, not everyone of us is into humanoids."
“Bye, Cas,” Dean says, and finds himself looking up the hallway, where Charlie just disappeared into the guest cabin, closing the door firmly behind her.
It's that thought that makes him increasingly aware of Cas' morning wood against his ass.
dork nonetheless.
– it's her. “Goodnight, guys,” she waves to them, at the door.
When he sidles up to Cas and presses against him from shoulder to knee, he blames it purely on the fact that the roadhouse is as full as it is. “You always this busy?” he asks Jo, who puts away shot glasses into a dishwasher and wipes the countertop.
want to?” he replies.
Pamela looks around the bar. “So who's the lucky lady, before I proposition yet another wife tonight?”
Dean kills the engine, gets out, breathes, prays.
Dean chuckles, sitting up. “If it means you're coming in my mouth, I'd like a heads-up next time, yeah.” Really, taking a load on his first try, he's a champion.
tingle down his spine as he thinks about yesterday, in the kitchen.
So Dean goes to shower.
In fascination, he watches as Cas turns red-cheeked under his gaze, then hides behind his beer. Dean leers, doesn't break eye contact once.
They drive without a goal in mind, maybe for minutes, probably for hours, without hurry. When trees open up to a hillside high up over a lake, Cas nods towards an overlook. “Dean, would you pull over, please?”
Donna looks at her, for a long time, frowning, edges of her mouth drawn downwards. “I don't want to intrude. You guys haven't seen each other for so long.”
Dean runs his hand over his flaccid dick, once, twice, then steps under the shower head again, tilts his head back and closes his eyes as he rinses off. He blinks to see what Cas is doing and finds him gone.
So, is Cas in trouble? We'll see. Will the boys go to Akkarea? We'll see. And what about Mary? We'll meet her soon, I promise you that.
No wonder Dean still has issues just thinking about sex with Cas.
Cas is across from him, nursing the obligatory bottle of beer, and Dean is working at his second whiskey.
Still, Dean can't quite connect the dots between his friend, the angel – Cas, the guy holding his hand – and loving this person who is not what he ever thought about, physically.
“Hi, Dean,” she says, ducking under the countertop, and Dean can see it. Another lifetime, another universe, another world where he doesn't have an angel by his side
Worst part of it all? When he worked at the Roadhouse the night before, that hickey was not hidden under a loose flannel collar. Because Dean only wore a t-shirt.
Sam checks the scanner to register a small vehicle of unknown origin and puts his empty bowl aside to zoom in on the main screen. The person on the caterpillar quad is heading right for him, and he knows that because there's nothing else but their ship around here.
Dean shakes his head. “I didn't recognize my
“I wasn’t kidding. You know I was sure they were dead.”
Dean closes his eyes.
He takes the heat out of the kiss on principle, pulls back, tips his forehead against Cas, breathes.
And Dean loves Cas.
Thank fuck she's got leather seats that are easy to wipe down and clean.
it, he needs to
“And people who love you,” Cas adds. “Who have been waiting for you.”
Dean hands one of the glasses to Cas, then sits down, looks him dead in the eye and says, “Just because I didn't say so before doesn't mean you're not smoking hot.”
Dean sighs. “You pissed or something?”
He wants to stop, he wants to drag this out, it's oh so good. Cas' fragrance in his nose, Cas' hands on him, and Dean can only hold on for the ride. Meet the twitch of his hips as he notices Cas' breathing becoming shallow.
For a second, Dean can only stare, before he a chuckle breaks out of him. “Of course he did. But you know, Sam Leahy? Doesn't sound half bad.”
“Okay?” Dean asks. “That was... anticlimactic.”
Later that morning, Dean sticks his head through the back door towards where Cas is working on the beehive in their garden. “Cas? I'm going for a drive!” he hollers.
“I'd like that.”
Dean wonders, for a moment, before he remembers Jack. It seems like a thing Mary does, just in case, and it makes him smile, to see Jack would always be welcome.
She hesitates for a few long seconds. “I knew you and Cas were close. I guessed it was... like this. To see it, how much you love each other, that's great.”
Because Sam is a sap, he pestered Dean until he agreed to do a wedding waltz. Dean still earns an epic bitchface from him when Sam realizes he picked 'Traveling Riverside Blues'. It works, for them, though. A bit fast, and not a waltz, but anyway. Cas twirls Dean around the room and nobody notices that they practiced it about two and a half times. They got distracted in the middle of the last rehearsal, but Dean's sure nobody notices if they exchange a heated look at
Dean smiles a tight smile at Cas. “You feeling alright?”
“Alright, leave the hard stuff to me, you get everything beer and soft drinks?”
“Gotcha,” Ellen says, “Now if you don't intend to work on your first night in heaven, get your cute ass over to that angel of yours.”
The king-sized bed is more than enough for both of them, and Cas – mirroring Dean – snap-changes into a plain white tee and checkered, wide boxers.
Dean feels heat creep up to the tips of his ears. Cas chuckles, beside him, ducks his head.
The course of events would later be described by one of the only surviving historians as, “not unlike the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but at planetary scale”.
Ash burps.
Under the table, Dean nudges his boot against Cas' ankle, hooks his foot around it. Cas doesn't break, only turns towards Dean and winks at him. Or, at least he tries. The guy can't wink to save his life, which is adorable. Instead of kissing him like he wants to and foregoing that because of the awkward and weird angle, Dean rests his hand on Cas' thigh, his go-to for public displays of affection.
The blow is softened by a cheeky smile Jody shoots at Donna, and the two even exchange a high-five behind their backs.
This morning, they had enjoyed one last breakfast on the beach and an hour of lazing in the hammock, and then Cas had grabbed Dean's hand, Dean had nodded, and like that, they zapped back home.
Last time: Dean and Cas have a breakfast date and move into their house.
The back of Castiel’s head hits the headrest as Dean shifts forward, rolls his hips against Castiel’s to make his point.
Dean gives in, exasperated. “Yeah, lay it on me, House.”
Sam handwaves her concerns. He knows what daytime on this planet means. “Only at night?”
Because he knew humans are miserable bastards who rarely got what they deserved or wanted.
Dean and Cas alone in a bar with some drinks, what could possibly go wrong? It's a good thing Dean got reminded by Charlie earlier... so what do you think will happen? ;) Also, yay for meeting Dorothy!
With a wary frown, Cas shakes his head. “What do you mean?”
“He'll tell us once he's back.”
The ‘hello’, he gets. The rest, not so much.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas grins, surprised, and they both chuckle.
“Yeah, no problem.”
Sam awaits him with a lopsided smirk, turning away from chatting with Ash over the counter. "Aw, I hope you were gentle when you broke his heart," he bats his eyes at Dean.
Dean nods. “Still thinking what I should do about that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And when he opens his eyes again, the kitchen became quite more modern and a little less worn, with a new stove and a freestanding fridge with magnets of all sizes on its front, waiting for pictures to be pinned to it.
Uriel, being the only one who’d possibly get the joke in the first place and actually find it funny, chuckles. “Well, we’ve been looking for you.”
Now that's taking flak from where Dean did not expect it. “Two weeks,” is what he eventually says, letting their attempt at trying to make this a less tense conversation fall flat. On purpose.
“Takes one to know one,” Charlie says, nudges his elbow. “You think it was easy for me, coming out?”
What he does know is that he might as well start to face those feelings. The attraction, the sex, they can work that out, later. This, this is far more important now.
He dips his tongue into Cas' navel just to see him squirm, make him relax, before he slips his hands into the back of Cas' jeans. Cas lifts his hips with an elegant roll that accentuates those hipbones in ways Dean never thought about and that's just unfair.
“Makes it seem like he really wanted to be there, first, huh.”
Wednesday morning, Dean spends entirely in bed with Cas, too lazy to get up, and by the time lunchtime rolls around, they have gotten each other off two times
Of course, by the end of the day, Dean has found at least ten other little things that need fixing, some rust here, loose screws and a cable rupture in the wiring harness, the radiator hose, of course, but also the fan. He makes a list. If this were him still alive and on earth, he'd groan, because there's so much to do.
He turned this time, more than a little confused. He had no idea who out here would know him by name, but there hadn’t been any mistaking it that time.
They lapsed into silence after that, and Dean reached for the radio dial to fill it all up again. Castiel realized that he hadn’t managed to get much more out of Dean than the fact that he had been on the baseball team while he had been in high school, and most of that had come from Sam. Sam seemed to be naturally inquisitive, and he sort of liked that about him. It was just that he wished he could turn it on Dean rather than himself. Of course, seeing as they were brothers, Sam had no reason to play twenty questions with Dean. Castiel would need to get better at using Sam’s questions to redirect the conversation to him when he got the chance.
Dean sighed again, but this time he was exasperated rather than relieved, “We argued. He went to see a friend for a while.”
Castiel could barely hear him let alone answer because there was Dean, possibly looking as shocked and terrified as he currently felt. Sam stood close behind him so that he was practically boxed in between the doorframe and his body, and Castiel was certain that if that hadn’t been the case one of them—either Dean or himself—would have bolted.
Castiel could not breathe.
Castiel dragged himself up from the floor and opened the door again to take the fresh linens from her, which she offered to replace for him, but was flatly turned down. He didn’t mean to be rude, but he also didn’t currently have the capacity to deal with her at the moment. She had brought a paper up for him as well, and he thanked her before closing the door on her again.
“Dean did some repair work for me,” Castiel said coolly. “We have similar taste in music.” Not quite a lie. Castiel didn’t have any particular taste in music to begin with, but he liked watching Dean sing along or move to it.
Dean glanced over his shoulder at their waiting opponents, both getting ready for what was about to be the easiest 100 bucks of their lives.
“Everything all right, Sammy?” Dean had poked his head through the door, and Sam rolled his eyes at Castiel as if to say, ‘told you so,’ before he looked his brother’s way.
Castiel frowned, “Why?”
Dean chose that exact moment to return to their room, still dressed in his pajamas, and looking perfectly cheerful.
“Can I-”
“No. Well, I guess he does now. But I never told him you and me were anything. Not like that. It’s just...I tried it out with a few different people before I decided it just wasn’t gonna work for me. And I wasn’t especially careful while I did. I even went back to that club a few times. Guess I hoped I’d find you there,or something, but when I didn’t, there was always someone else who was willing. It didn’t take too long for Sam to catch on, and I’m not entirely convinced he didn’t suspect something earlier than he said.” He shrugged, “Anyway, Sammy’s never been the kind of kid that cared about that sort of thing. He says he wants me to be happy,  and if guys make me happy, then that’s fine too.”
He finished his cigarette and climbed back through the window so he could use the toilet and clean himself up a little. Just because Dean wanted them to eat in their underwear didn’t mean he couldn’t make himself half way decent.
“In the kitchen… was it true? About your friends wanting you to bring me around? Or were you just saying that to keep dad from getting angry about dinner?”
Castiel turned to face him, his brows drawn together in confusion, though he doubted Dean could see any more than he could, “What are you talking about?”
"No," he'd said. "Can’t say I know it." Lying hadn't ever been his strong suit, but he thought Sergeant Laffite had swallowed that one. He’d spent too long at that point trying not to think of how he’d left that place behind. He hadn’t wanted to talk about it, or how he now figured that the Sergeant Benny standing next to him was the same Benny that Dean had been caught with by Bobby so many years ago. The same one that had gotten spooked and enlisted shortly thereafter. The seeming impossibility of it was enough for him to keep his mouth shut if his desire not to talk about a guy he hadn't been able to shake for years wasn't. It was a testament to his absolutely rotten luck. He’d crossed an ocean, and still Dean Winchester followed him.
Dean drove them to the shop, and Castiel expected to wait for him in the truck, so he was a little surprised when Dean came around and opened his door for him. “C’mon, I dunno how long it’ll take me in there, and I doubt you want to twiddle your thumbs out here. Not with the sky looking like it does.”
Dean looks over at the passenger seat, keys hovering in front of the ignition. “Pick up Sam and Eileen, then drive over to my parents?”
They sit down on the porch swing together, and Dean tips his boot against the floor.
“So you don't expect anything to happen?”
“Whenever you're ready,” Cas squeezes, just a bit.
Doesn't he yearn to be here with him the way Dean does?
He's sure that Cas felt the twitch in the muscles of his abdomen, and the tiny circle Cas' hand starts to rub into the skin there, right over his happy trail, is all the confirmation he needs. The roll of Cas' hips against him, as small as it is, is also a clue, maybe.
fit into the universe as it is. What is their role, and why should they rebel? Sure, the status quo is far from perfect, but so far it hasn’t affected any of them all that much. They’ve kept their heads low and did what needed to be done to get around. Sam has never seen himself as someone who’d join a rebellion.
Castiel’s eye-roll in response is almost a full-body motion. “I do. Do they look like they care? As long as the ship has been reported missing from the Akkarean fleet…”
scratch that. He's good on his own on this one.
Dean reaches for Cas' knee once he feels like it, and Cas covers his hand with his own. Holding hands, fishing, in comfortable silence.
Cas snorts, and the sound is entirely too human for him, but it makes Dean grin all the same. “Most might have questioned my loyalties at some point, but some stayed on our side nonetheless, even if they pursued their own goals.”
That, on the other hand, makes Dean falter. “Hunting?”
Very unimpressed, Jo levels him with a raised eyebrow. “And? You do that all the time, charming fucker that you are.”
Dean drives, lets Baby rip across the German Autobahn and enjoys the fact that there truly is no speed limit.
Instead of letting this get to him, he goes to take care of his bladder, and finds Cas getting dressed when he re-emerges. Still, he gets an eyeful of underwear being pulled up and over that perfect, perky ass. There are so many feelings swirling in his guts — not shame, never shame, but a weird mix of insecurity and guilt, inexplicably, and desire, and there’s a tingling in his toes. Frankly, he's out of his depth here.
Which is unfortunate.
With a chuckle, he kisses down Cas' jawline. The beard stubble is not fazing him at this point, he's been kissing that for days now, and it may not be smooth skin under his lips but it has an appeal all on its own. More kisses follow the line of Cas' neck and Adam's apple, stop over his collar bone because Dean knows what he's doing, of course he does. Cas groans, low in his throat, and Dean can feel that groan vibrating against his lips.
Also, in case anyone wonders, I really do write and put up these chapters in real time. When one is done, I put it up, then write the next.
Dean grins at Cas, and Cas pats Sam's back once before joining Dean, standing at his side. They exchange a quick grin, watch as Sam spins on his heel, and wraps Jack in a bear hug as well. “Hi, Jack.”
Castiel looks at him, wide eyed, almost taken by surprise, as if he wasn’t aware that Dean has maybe led a life where he had to fight his way out of a… situation once or twice.
Cas nods, like he understood perfectly. He wraps his arm around Dean's shoulders, squeezes once, and takes his mind off things. “To answer your question, I do think we could've made it work, built a house together somewhere, live a quiet little life, you could've run an auto repair shop with some hunting on the side. What Bobby did, be a mentor, of sorts.”
Shaking his head, helpless, Dean pulls Cas against his body with both arms around his hips, curls his hands upwards, grabs Cas' shoulders. Cas' arms wrap around his neck in reflex. “Not better,” Dean rasps, his voice rough and shot too hell.
Cas hasn't seen half of what's possible, and Dean gives a few more experimental bops of his head, tilts it this way and that, notices that the strain on his jaw is definitely there, and this isn't half as easy as it looked when girls did it on him. Wrapping his hand around the part he can't get into his mouth, Dean jerks Cas off as he sucks him, plays with his tongue around the head of his dick on his way up.
“Status report,” he mumbles towards the ship’s on-board computer.
Ever so slowly, Cas' fingers trail up his side, to where the hand print is underneath Dean's flannel. “You know that marriage is just a sentiment?”
Dean takes a deep breath. “Just so you know, I didn't forget what you said, and we need to talk about the elephant in the room--”
Harsh breaths, a last grapple at control, reddened lips on stubble.
For the life of him, Dean has no idea what she's talking about. Well, he does understand what she's saying, but he can't figure out what it means, for him, or Sam and Eileen, at the moment.
Chuck clears his throat.
Oh, you're gonna hate me for this one.
Ash points to Dean’s left, down the bar, and winks as he does it. “Dude over there. Went all wide-eyed when you came in. Guess these odds are in your favor.”
