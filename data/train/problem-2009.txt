"Should we try to get him to a hospital?" Mary asked, concern in her voice. Though it annoyed her to no end that the obnoxious detective had once again stolen all of John's attention, she did not want him to possibly die on their hands.
He heard a shuffling at his side and did not even have to open his eyes to identify his visitor. The breathing at the mattress edge (someone eager to get a close look at him) as well as the weight of the figure leaning there (not the skinny one) was enough for an identification.
The younger Holmes had already cheated death on far too many occasions, and every time he had miraculously come out unscathed, or at least without acquiring lasting damage. That, Mycroft realized, was not strictly true. Certain events, some of which happened quite early in his relatively short life, had left Sherlock with permanent and incurable psychological scars.
"You CAN move!" Sherlock insisted and knelt down in the grass next to his struggling friend. He retained his hold on John's hands but did not pull. To have any chance of getting the older man loose, they needed to synchronize their efforts.
The room was dark when John entered, but as his eyes adjusted, he saw that Mary was still awake. Lying under a sheet, she calmly looked up at him as he awkwardly removed his trousers and shirt. She turned over, expecting the dipping sensation of a body joining her in the bed, but instead she heard the shuffling of his feet against the carpet. Then John bumped into a drawer and she heard him whisper out a curse.
Though the airport was loud and busy, a male voice shouting “OH BLOODY HELL!” rang out amidst the crowd, turning numerous heads. Sherlock calmly strode over to the couple as though he had not heard John’s outburst.
Mycroft patiently waited for an answer while his little brother deliberated with a theatrically pensive expression on his young face. He was willing to spice the deal with a few additional touches if William refused, as the boy was known for driving a hard bargain, no doubt presently weighing the pros and cons in his mind.
Although what difference did that make now? John was dead. His feelings no longer mattered. A corpse could be neither hurt nor comforted. Sherlock began to wish he were a corpse as well. Maybe if he wished hard enough, he could make it come true.
"Why was I not called?" The civil servant interrupted him. "You were to contact me if anything important occur, and Sherlock regaining consciousness, much less waking in distress is important."
John's head was feeling several sizes too big when he blurrily came to. He could feel himself being carried, and not at all with consideration or gentility. Whomever was lugging him about did so as though he were a sack of grain. He did not reach full consciousness until he felt rough hands lifting him by the arms and tying him to something from above, thus leaving him hanging rather painfully by his wrists. Like his partner, his mouth was bound with duct tape, and he could only make muffled noises of protest.
Lifting a very hesitant hand, John patted her doughy, bare shoulder. “We’ll find her,” he said. “There ain’t a case Sherlock hasn’t solved.”
"But..." John objected, although he did nothing to stop her when she pushed past him into the kitchen area. She tore two cans out of the six pack of beer in their mini fridge and then wordlessly retreated into the room she - up until now, anyway - shared with her boyfriend. Whatever thinking she was required to do, it was clearly not something she wanted to do sober.
Despite their occasional disagreements, Sawtooth and his firstborn shared a unique bond which allowed them to practically read each other's thoughts, and Three-finger intuitively knew exactly what his father demanded at this moment. A pair of dirty old pliers were passed into the leader's outstretched hand, and Sawtooth pried the whore's mouth open by applying pressure to his mandibles. Predictably, the whore squealed and struggled against the treatment, but his struggles were kitten-weak and Sawtooth had no difficulties restraining him.
He had received no calls from the hospital, which could only mean Sherlock's condition was unchanged. Mycroft felt ambivalent about it. Part of him - the biggest part - hoped for a speedy recovery, but another, hidden part wished that Sherlock would remain comatose for the rest of his life simply so that Mycroft did not have to deal with the consequences. If he'd been one to carry sentiment, he almost would have been ashamed of his thoughts. Mycroft Holmes was never one to take the easy way out because he did not want to work hard. Unlike Sherlock. Realizing his bitterness, he pushed those thoughts aside.
His voice had steeled and he gave his partner and friend an expectant glance which asked him to lead the way. Sherlock nodded and together the two men walked the road, following the tire tracks. Though neither spoke, both were hoping they could reach the destination of the criminals before nightfall. Thank goodness for summer hours.
"You went through my things?" he croaked out, as if he couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. Sherlock's features took on what John referred to as his 'snarly face'; eyes bulging, nostrils flaring, mouth curled. The detective was ready to defend himself, tooth and nail.
John also swore he could hear a very distinct, deep voice laughing, but once he glanced in Sherlock's direction, the detective was visibly busy stuffing his own luggage away.
"Sherlock…" John stood before his friend, faced with the mammoth task of trying to talk him out of going, based on a hunch alone. Sherlock sneered derisively at 'hunches' not substantiated by hard-boiled, empirical data. And still, John's gut told him that they were both in grave danger, and if he could not convince Sherlock to abandon the search, he could at least say he tried.
“You and I both know that food is no way to deal with stress,” Sherlock retorted, purposefully ignoring his friend’s point. “I don’t want to end up looking like you.”
“No,” John shook his head. “No, I’m not sensationalizing anything. I came with you because I wanted to. Yes, I’ve had problems. But you were the one I wanted to solve those problems for.”
"She's only been gone one and a half hours, John," Sherlock replied, and his tone was surprisingly gentle. "There's hardly any cause for concern at this point."
"I am not hungry for food," Sherlock cut in, emphasizing his statement with another kick to the long-suffering wall.
Were they out preying on a new victim? Mary had only been dead a few hours; they would not be needing more meat for at least a week, unless they had a habit of 'stocking up' during the summer months to last through the harsh Appalachian winter.
Less than a minute later, Three-finger's distant laughter picked up in excitement, and Sawtooth knew this meant their meat had been found. One-Eye was likely not far off, and as useless as the oaf could be at times, he could at least be trusted to hold onto their prey with a grip of iron if need be. Though not quick, Sawtooth hurried onward, grip on his bow tightening in anticipation.
The curtains were drawn in Bobbi Ferguson's trailer, and there was no certain way of telling if she was home. If his first destination failed, he could think of a few more probable places to look for her.
Though Mycroft Holmes was usually the last person John wanted to speak with, he was still an intelligent man who knew his younger brother better than most. Even if he was an overly-preened windbag. Mycroft would know what to do... hopefully.
"They've been getting away with this for decades," Sherlock replied. "Either they've picked up a few hints on how not to get caught over the years... or out of pure coincidence they've made a very good choice on their trophies."
They both looked in the direction of Sherlock's finger, but not even the slightest trail of smoke could be seen. The angle was right, and even John had to admit he recognized the environment from the photograph; it all matched up. Only the smoke was absent.
"They'll be there for later. Now please keep your head still and try not to blink." Despite the request, Sherlock blinked furiously when John checked his eyes, but fortunately his pupils seemed to respond as they should to light.
He brushed a hand through his thick curls and John was briefly reminded of the mental image of his partner's partially shaved head.
"Now ya listen to me, Eli. This here's a man, and he's been shot. Run back up to ya Mama and ask her to call an ambulance. We gotta take this man here to the hospital, or he gonna be dead. Can ya do that, Eli?"
Sherlock backed away hesitantly. He thought for a moment that perhaps John had snapped. He certainly hoped not, not only for the chance that John would become a liability or undependable (would he wander off for some unknown reason?), but because losing his partner and dearest, closest friend was unthinkable.
His hands were free now, but that hardly made a difference, with one arm useless and the other outside grasping distance of anything that could be used as a weapon. Sherlock briefly entertained the idea of lunging for something (a mad dash, in lack of better words) sharp and pointy that could be driven deep into the slow creature's neck. He pictured twisting the weapon - cutting through the carotid, jugular, and trachea in one fluid motion - and being showered in a spray of the creature's blood, his fading strength momentarily fuelled by adrenaline and perverse satisfaction.
The one of Sherlock's eyes that was not grossly swollen shut made a feeble attempt to open, and Mycroft could see the flash of a well-known turquoise iris, now surrounded by a blood-red eye-white; subconjunctival hemorrhage. Sherlock could not speak, but a flicker of recognition passed over his tormented and abused features, suggesting that he had retained sight in the bloodshot eye.
Mary - his Mary - had been butchered and hung from the ceiling like a slab of meat in a slaughterhouse.
Technically the trailer used to be red. Time and sunlight had faded the paint into a dull pink. John and Sherlock looked around, noting that they had reached the U-turn which navigated cars back to the beginning of the main road. For someone so uncomfortable about being interviewed in the forest, Bobbi had her trailer incredibly close to it.
He was being silly. This was some subconscious attempt to bring work with him, to worry about someone showing up to bring him back for a case or other emergency, away from his well-earned vacation. He needed to ignore it and pay attention to what he had with him at present. He needed to focus on the lovely woman at his side, smiling at him.
Due to the large amount of flames sent to us recently, my co-author and I have decided we need to make something infinitely clear.
He jolted at the sudden opening of a door, though Mycroft still held him fast. A nurse entered, confusion inherent on her face at the sight before her.
The pilot did as told, and though the day had been long and sunlight was now only available for a few hours more, a glittering caught Mycroft’s eye again, and the aircraft made its way toward a clearing, quite large by the elder Holmes’ estimate. Instead of a pond, he found himself staring with wide eyes at a massive gathering of automobiles.
Eventually John stopped fighting it. He experienced brief moments of clarity following, during one of which he attempted to write Sherlock's name in the ground beneath him. It did not go well. The mud was too loose, the ground too soggy, and the letters he formed disappeared before he could start working on the next.
, Mycroft thought as he removed a handkerchief and patted his face. The entire tri-state area looked to be stuck in the seventies as far as resources were concerned. Still, it wasn't West Virginia, a state which he had more than his fill of even after speaking with John.
Sherlock expected to return to the likely now repaired plywood prison from which he and John - oh, dearest John - had escaped, but instead he was lowered onto a tattered, lumpy cushion on the floor. He yelped when his arms were deliberately moved, binding him to the rusty leg of a heavy iron stove, but otherwise, he was left where he lay.
The copious presence of thick, deep mud likely obscured other clues, but the most telling were also the most frightening to John. Fragments of broken glass from a vehicle, deep tire tracks from said vehicle, likely stuck in the thick muck... and a trail of blood leading away from the scene.
Mycroft both wanted Nasim to hurry up as well as to postpone the inevitable. He took a seat in one of the uncomfortable plastic visitors' chairs and suddenly felt a dire need for a cup of strong, black coffee, awful though it was in this region. Lunch was still several hours away, and he needed something to sustain him until then. It was tantalizing to head down to the cafeteria and order something high-calorie and sugary from their appetizing if somewhat limited menu, but Mycroft did not want to sabotage his diet, not when he'd finally managed to reach his target weight after so many years of carrying excess pounds. He could resist whatever cravings that came over him. The ability to do that was what always separated him from his brother.
They proceeded to swim together, back and forth. They both swam at a relatively similar pace, though Mary was just a little faster.
That whore seemed to cause more and more trouble the longer they held it, he thought bitterly. And even more likely, its plump little companion had survived its escape and told the piggies. His grip tightened on the shotgun, and he resisted the urge to furiously shoot the damnable thing down from the sky. Instead he turned about and ran as fast as he could, straight back to the cabin.
John suppressed a groan and rubbed is forehead against the surface of his partner’s chest, a weak attempt to distract Sherlock from the subject. He felt a perky nipple against his hairline, and Sherlock subsequently wiggled at the sensation.
John stood up and reached for his wallet, snatching out a 20 dollar bill and passing it on to Mary. She stared at him with confusion.
Something about the notion of laying down to sleep, to be at his most vulnerable in front of these people, unnerved him. No, that was not true. Sleep was not the most vulnerable he could have been. To do so would have involved openly weeping, and he would never do that.
He swept his eyes across the interior of the picturesque little lodge, seeing if he would discover something not previously noticed, until his gaze landed on Sherlock's laptop. John had hooked it up to an adapter last night before going to sleep, and he assumed the battery was fully charged now. Perhaps he could while away some time by surfing online? Granted the WI-FI connection was insufferably slow to someone who was used to the speed and comfort of modern broadband, but it was the only thing available, and John supposed they should be grateful for that. The area did not even have mobile phone service.
John pressed on the power button, and the device buzzed back to life. The photo he had been studying yesterday with Mary while Sherlock lay passed out on the sofa appeared on the screen, and John clicked it down to the taskbar. There were no more clues for him to figure out. He proceeded to the small Firefox icon on the desktop, half-fearing that Sherlock's internet access would be password-protected. The detective, however, was not that paranoid, and John thanked his lucky star for that, as he never could have been able to guess Sherlock's password.
Anger and frustration flared again. Fists clenched, he tried to remain calm as he wrote out his explanation. He had not wanted to leave his friend, partner, and lover behind. In fact, he still cursed himself for leaving Sherlock's side, especially when all it got him was being stuck and voiceless in a hospital bed with a condescending ginger bastard giving him the third degree.
“Wasn’t I any good?” Sherlock asked, and all the accusation in his voice was strangely gone. Instead he seemed purely curious in his despair.
Sawtooth was furious. His eldest son's impetuousness had once again ruined things for him, this time by getting in the way of a clear shot. Now their prey had slipped out of their reach, and even worse, the plump piece of meat had managed to drag Three-finger with it.
John hesitated at first, but finally tossed the bottle to his partner, who caught it effortlessly, opened it, and poured a copious amount onto his palm. The room instantly filled with the peculiar scent. John only stared as Sherlock slathered the substance over every inch of his red body. He considered mentioning that the lotion belonged to Mary, but what good would it do?
As of present, Sherlock had no trouble sleeping, not when he had some persuading from the medical staff and their drugs. Mycroft gave a quiet sigh. How useful sedatives would have been when they were younger, although back in his earliest years back he would have likely gotten wise to drugged food and drink. Perhaps a tranquilizer gun would have been useful...
Mary was the first to retire. John was not sure what was expected of him at this stage. Was she interested in anything besides sleep? After such a long and trying day, and with Sherlock next door, he did not believe so.
So eager was he to rise and prepare himself for what lay ahead that he almost stood straight up, caution be damned, but ever the rational Holmes brother, he kept a cool - albeit throbbing - head as he composed himself. He slowly but steadily consumed some of the bread and meat before taking the tablets, silently meditating and reorganizing his thoughts. Shower or no shower, headache or no headache, he would be of no use to anyone, especially not his brother, if he left the infinite space of his mind in utter chaos.
The few times John had been lucid enough to understand the voices around him, he heard someone mention that paramedics were on their way. How would they get here again? Where the hell was he? Where was Sherlock? Was he even alive?
John wanted to block out the sounds of Sherlock calling his name, of being reminded that he was present and could do absolutely nothing to help his friend. He wanted to look away, and yet something compelled him to keep his eyes firmly trained on the scene taking place before him. He watched as the giant held down Sherlock with one hand and freed his bloated member with the other. Predictably it was huge, proportionate to the rest of his body, and bound to tear Sherlock up, especially if inserted dryly.
"I'm sure we'll find something to use when we get there," Sherlock said. "Also, they are probably quite used to victims that cannot fight back. We may be able to surprise them yet."
he had taken the sedative he'd been seconds from ingesting when the fateful news of Sherlock's overseas interment reached him. At least then he would have had an excuse not to take immediate action.
John pretended he had not heard his partner’s answer. With their carry-on luggage and boarding papers, they proceeded towards the plane.
"I won't!" he growled from between tightly clenched teeth and simultaneously sent his tormentors an eyeful of hate. The mountain men of course ignored any attempts at defiance from their captive, and the skinny one poked him with the fork again, this time marginally harder.
He was broken from his trance by the repulsive sound of the toothy giant's throat driving up a noxious concoction of phlegm and saliva, spitting it into his palm, and John knew precisely where the event was headed. It nearly made him sick. He felt he should be crying, but the shock of what was about to happen left his eyes dry. Instead, he felt tiny rivers of sweat pouring down his naked skin, shivering as he hung exposed and manhandled by the two remaining clan members. He barely paid them any attention, watching in horror as their leader rubbed himself slick and pulled the struggling young man's legs far apart. Sherlock gave a choked cry of insolence and fear that might have sounded funny in dreadfully different circumstances, and he frantically tried to escape the giant's grasp, but the struggle did absolutely nothing to change his fate. Dirty nails dug into the flesh of his bottom and spread the cheeks open.
Only one way out, and said way might just kill him. But if it meant getting away, if it meant the possibility of getting further away from these bastards and a little closer to help... he would gladly take the risk.
If John failed to get Sherlock out alive, he had absolutely no doubts about his own fate at the hands of Mycroft Holmes. He would be, quite literally, a dead man regardless if he got away from these cannibals if Sherlock did not.
could have made it to the store and back within forty minutes, and so would anyone with half a brain, but he managed to restrain himself, realizing that John likely wanted to hear words of reassurance rather than stone cold facts.
Sherlock only ever called him by his last name when he was angry with him. Even though he knew that the scolding had been justified, John did not like falling out with Sherlock. While he was sure that they would soon be on speaking terms again, Sherlock was known to hold grudges for a very long time; his relationship with Mycroft was a good example of that. John was not even close to knowing what had caused the rift between the brothers, and since neither was willing to talk about it, it didn't seem like he'd ever find out.
The whore cried and clawed at the floor, struggling to escape, but in vain. The commotion woke One-Eye, though the big oaf did not seem to mind. He watched the torment for a short while, then simply got up and went looking about in a pile of clutter for something to bide his time with until Three-finger returned.
"Yes, I know!" John snapped. Just when they had some peace on this trip... "Mary," he said carefully. "Let's go outside for a moment."
Mary smirked and played along, whispering back. “Why is that such a scandalous thing suddenly? Oh wait, let me guess… you broke in, didn’t you?”
At least his leg still hurt, and it had no suspicious odor yet, he mused with a combination of fear and relief. Had it gone numb, he would be far more worried. Sherlock could not closely inspect the wounds caused by the bear trap, and he was not presently certain if he would have wanted to. What was the point of looking for signs of septicemia if he was slowly dying here anyway?
"What?" The detective looked from his friend to the woman, wondering why they both seemed so cross with his proposal. It made perfect sense, didn't it? "I was only suggesting a way for dear Mary to be of some use while we investigate. Now how about that map?"
Already having experienced one near-death event, John knew that what they said about your whole life flashing by in a flurry of images was not true, at least not as far as he was concerned. All he saw was darkness, penetrated only by the occasional glimpse of light when he managed to break the surface of what was very likely to be his watery tomb.
"Well, the trip itself wasn't originally going to involve this amount of forest," John said, not without a certain level of exasperation. "Also, the trip wasn't originally supposed to turn into a case."
The plump one cried out from beneath his gag, clearly trying to get the patriarch's attention, likely arguing against his companion's treatment. Sawtooth only ignored him, and his relatives turned their interest towards the whining piece of meat, Three-finger clawing playfully at bits of flesh and One-Eye rubbing his hands against a disgusted face.
Crouching down behind the steering wheel to make herself as small as possible to avoid being hit by an arrow, a bullet, or any other projectile that her attacker might feel like hurling in her direction, Mary considered abandoning the car to seek refuge amongst the foliage. In here she was an easy target; too easy. She would put herself at risk when crossing the road (she now thanked the fates for the narrowness of it), but if she managed to launch herself into the thicket, her chances of survival would increase by far.
Another arrow was fired toward her, this time shattering the driver side window and embedding itself in the headrest of her seat. The pane of glass practically exploded, showering the woman's hair and features with tiny shards. Mary screamed, even though she could not feel any pain at the moment. Her adrenaline-fuelled body did not allow it; her two choices consisted of fight or flight, and thus far, she was set on flight.
She cowered at the floor by the pedals for another few seconds, which seemed to stretch on forever in her fear-riddled mind. She even asked herself the - mostly rhetorical - question: what would Sherlock Holmes have done? Rhetorical because she was not Sherlock Holmes.
"Yes, of course," he muttered half-heartedly, but then cleared his throat. "Yes. We have to see this through."
The American law enforcement officers in their standard black SWAT gear, strangely reminiscent of ants or worker bees, shouted commands and exchanged information at decibel levels that were decidedly damaging to the civil servant's eardrums, and Mycroft suddenly wished he had received the phone call
Who was he kidding, anyway? Between his hours at the surgery and the time spent as Sherlock's steadfast assistant solving crime, he had very little time or energy for a healthy lifestyle. And to think that he would actually turn forty next year...
Her decision was taken from her when something massive landed on the roof of the car, heavy enough to make a dent in the steel. A scream lodged deep in Mary's throat finally broke free, and she surrendered fully to panic.
Sherlock's thoughts momentarily drifted to contemplate the obvious and glaring inefficiency of the local police department and their inability to even protect their own, but the furious howl of his attacker, no longer in a playful mood, quickly made him forget thoughts about anything but the present.
The clues were clear that Mary had lost her way when trying to find the main road leading to the dollar store. In some paths of the road, she had doubled back and driven through multiple times, suggesting she had not noticed in some moment of lost nerve. John looked around at the trees, noting they all started looking the same after a while. Someone would have to pay very close attention to details to keep track of where they were.
Admittedly her smile was infectious, and John found himself smiling as well. How could Sherlock possibly compare Mary to some repulsive, unwashed native of marginalized mountain society? If anyone were to resemble such a person, it would be Sherlock himself.
The thought that Sherlock really did have bipolar disorder weighed heavily on john’s mind. Had he known about this sooner, would he have had more patience with Sherlock? Would they still have been together?
"Fuck you!" John hissed with such vehemence that the detective actually took a step back from him, visibly startled. "You're no better than they are, you fucking sociopath! You're probably even pleased she's dead!"
“We also took a look at her former parking space. Not much there, though, not to my surprise.” Reaching one end of the pool, he gripped the edge. “Sherlock and I had a bit of a row.”
John rolled his eyes. "We don't need to have you collapsing again, so I'd rather you not exhaust yourself today. There should be food by the time we get back, and you do need to eat, as much as you don't believe so."
"Enjoying your little vacation to the Land of the Free?" the elder Holmes inquired, and as always, he was able to make a simple question sound like a disguised insult... or threat.
There was nothing more Sherlock could deduce from the parking spot that Sarah used to occupy - the near-week that had passed since her disappearance had obliterated practically all traces of her in the public area - and Bobbi announced she would return to her trailer, claiming she needed some time by herself to "digest the news".
John closed his mouth, biting back his own response to accept the offer of coffee from their hostess. Sherlock had clearly forgotten that he was there.
The woman did not even make three steps before she hit the ground. She looked up to identify her approaching attackers, but already her vision was fading. She could only see three shadows.
John's self-preservation instinct told him to get himself someplace safe, which in this case meant as far from the wretched cabin as possible. If he simply ran, in whatever direction, he was bound to get to a road sooner or later… wasn't that so? He was fairly sure he would not find his way back to Avalon without Sherlock to guide him.
Pocketing the pill, John looked at Sherlock and considered waking him for a direct confrontation. But he stamped down the panicked impulse and simply sat. Sherlock would be unpleasant to deal with regarding the sunburns alone, and outright demanding answers would cause the detective to immediately retreat into his mind. Sherlock would respond like a tortoise being attacked by a predator, and thusly hide behind a shell, and rightly so. No, this would require gentility. Sherlock was oftentimes like a child, and so oftentimes he had to be treated as such.
"And knowing what an utter shit I've been to both of you, she likely left for good and got a plane ticket back home." John rubbed his face with his hands and sank back onto the bed, feeling hopeless. "What the hell is wrong with me, Sherlock..."
Almost as though fate had granted him a favor, John spotted something only a few paces away. Even in this poor light, he could see it. The tree stump had several ugly marks in it already, and hopefully the damage in the wood indicated that the axe presently lodged into it was very sharp. He nearly gave into the impulse of running straight out into the open to snatch the newfound weapon, but he restrained himself at the last possible moment. Being cautious was vital now, with every move he made. John listened again, desperately hoping he was not about to run straight into the welcoming arms - or shotgun as it were - of an unseen attacker. He peered into the darkness, seeing nothing and no one.
Trees, trees, mountains of trees… occasional clearings in the seemingly endless forest caught his attention, but they always appeared to indicate nothing of importance. A man with any less self-restraint might scream. Mycroft simply kept searching.
Rapid footsteps came louder until the giggling madman was suddenly upon him. Sherlock could not help the scream that erupted from him when their bodies connected, and he silently hoped John would not double back just from hearing his cries.
"Maybe there's no cabin," John said. "What we saw in the photo could've been just a bonfire. This is a police matter now, anyway. We should leave this to them."
"Think about it, John," Sherlock said. "Our giant fellow with the curved spine would be a most memorable figure, were he known in these parts, hardly someone who could hide in plain sight. The only way for him to stay unnoticed is to live like a hermit in these woods."
Of course. They wanted him to watch. They could tell he and Sherlock were friends and delighted in tormenting him just as much as his partner. The skinny one giggled and shook the face in his hand. John deeply wanted to bite, to reduce the fingers on the little bastard all the more. Maybe that would be painful enough for one of these assholes to feel.
Limbs were splayed out like an animal ready to be skinned. Licking the split of his lip and gums, Sawtooth lowered his hand and slowly inserted a finger into the whore. He relished the squeal which escaped the quivering body he had penetrated, as well as the near vibration of pain around his finger. He removed his hand... and inserted two fingers.
Three-finger seethed at the order, although he knew well enough to keep his impudent response to himself. Scouting was something the family took turns doing - or rather two of them did, as One-Eye easily got lost on his own. It was important to keep Outsiders from intruding on their home, but the skinny hunter knew the reason behind the command easily.
Sherlock said nothing, once again cautiously looking around before standing upright. He glanced through the shattered front passenger door. As he suspected, Mary's purse and other belongings were still within, of no interest to her captors. When carefully lifting the purse open, he noted her money was still present as well. Of course, the group of criminals had no use for money if they were simply living in the middle of the woods like wild animals, likely not having access to electricity or plumbing either.
“This is your case, not mine,” John said, glaring. “If the case really is that important. Why are you out here, really?”
The smell hit against them like a physical wall when the shed door was opened and revealed the macabre contents. Mycroft had seen - and smelled - his fare share of corpses in various stages of decomposition, but nothing could have prepared him for the sight dangling from the ceiling.
No, I don't want to go, a voice in his brain whined. Why did he have to wake up anyway? Was it time for school?
Sherlock gathered himself up from the bed and lit the ceiling lamp. The shade was a ghastly, soiled thing, probably white once upon a time, but now a faded yellow. Nevertheless, it did its job providing the room with illumination, bleary though it was, and Sherlock shuffled over to the small mirror hanging on one of the walls. The glass was scratched and held a few suspicious stains, but he could see himself just fine. He was a horrid sight. Giving a shaky sigh, the detective brushed his tangled hair back from his forehead and let his eyes slide shut. Then he inhaled deeply a few times and counted to ten. It helped slightly, but he still felt - and looked - a sodding mess.
The figure in the dark shuffled around, hulking and terrible. It seemed to pay him no attention, distracted by some object it was working on. In its work, it dropped something which clattered to the floor.
The little madman spun the revolver in his fully developed right hand and decided to use it as a blunt force weapon instead. Sherlock barely had time to raise his arm to shield his neck and face from the blow that followed, and he could hear a sickening crack when the gun barrel connected with his forearm.
In the end, she chose to take the right turn, not intimidated by the lack of pavement, as she had been driving on dirt roads for a good while now. She assumed it was more of a standard in these backwater communities.
Sherlock gagged for a moment from the mere taste and smell of the vehicle antifreeze which had been forced down his throat, but he did not vomit. He was especially relieved that he managed to keep himself from swallowing. Of course, the intent behind the wiry bastard's actions was not unreadable. Even an idiot could have deciphered what had nearly happened.
John received a face full of dirt upon hitting the floor, and he hoped he was not tasting excrement. Spitting the worst of it out only launched the remaining dust back into his face.
Mycroft, for all his savvy, did not have all the answers. This was John's mess, and thus also his to sort out.
“Can we not bring up your brother when we’re about to fuck?” John said with a groan that was partially out annoyance, but mostly due to Sherlock’s fingers wrapping around his cock once more.
John wrapped both arms around the detective's narrow waist and pressed their bodies together, his soft, burgeoning belly flush against Sherlock's almost concave one, the younger man's weeping arousal trapped between them. John could feel every single one of Sherlock's ribs through his skin, as well as the crests of his hipbones. For someone dangerously thin, Sherlock was certainly anything but dainty.
I'll manage, John thought, but he could not even manage to utter the words. He started to speak again, but was cut off by the horrendous cough which rattled his insides and sent him collapsing onto his stomach once more. He likely had pneumonia. He would withstand diphtheria if he had the chance to get back to the cabin and find Sherlock.
Despite the littered ground Sherlock's move to the helicopter was swift and efficient. Stepping out of the way, Mycroft watched his brother pass. The tendons in his jaw tightened, and for a moment he wanted to keep in step with the gurney, to perhaps fulfill some natural contract of keeping an eye on him like a real big brother would. A mental image passed of him clasping Sherlock's hand like some serialized medical drama. But it passed without incident. This was not how he did things. Even so, his current state would have likely put him on the ground after only a few hurried steps, and then he would have been of no use to anyone. Instead he followed at his own pace, Anthea trailing close behind as though even the uneven terrain of this hellhole meant nothing on feet used to parading around in heels.
Flashback to an event which contributed to making Sherlock Holmes the man he is today. What part did Anderson play in that?
"We should go back out," he said. John faintly nodded, but he did not seem to leave his reverie until a long pale hand touched his shoulder. He winced, but finally looked Sherlock straight in the eye.
Mycroft's sighing as he took a seat was so quiet even Anthea could not have heard it. Over the next two hours, he silently dreaded the inevitable reaction when Sherlock finally awoke, when he would see one leg half-missing and be alert enough to remember what had happened to him. Hearing the outbursts from the amputation would be bad enough, but what the local examples of bipedal putrescence had done to him was barely something to be shelved away in the mind palace. It was a miracle that Sherlock had turned out as well as he had, what with...
He was never so happy to see Sherlock's face. Sherlock allowed himself a smile, and though his expression was marred by discomfort and pain, his smile was genuine.
John picked up his struggles against the unforgiving forces of nature, forcing his oxygen-deprived brain back into action, which in turn commanded his muscles to move. The will to live was the most fundamental component of all in a matter of survival, and John was not prepared to give it up just yet. He resurfaced and his straining lungs greedily inhaled.
A few more seconds of wet, open-mouthed kissing and frantic grinding against each other, and  John's pleasure finally erupted in a long-awaited climax. He thrust up into Sherlock until his spent cock flagged enough to make continued penetration difficult, and then fell back against the pillows, chest heaving and limbs simultaneously both lax and tingly from the intensity of the orgasm.
John exhaled from relief. A vengeful lunatic with a major grudge against Sherlock was the last thing they needed to deal with at this time. Though his general opinion of Mycroft Holmes remained the same, John couldn't help but be grateful for the man's influence and resourcefulness.
“Yes, but somehow I was under the impression that I was predominantly straight. Ugghh…” He dropped his head against Sherlock again, causing the detective to wince. “I might be the worst gay man ever.”
A quick glance at the man told Mycroft that he had spent somewhere between three to five years stationed in Iraq, and though his record appeared spotless at first glance, there was a reason why J. Bening had never advanced above the rank of corporal in the military. The man had a fondness for gambling and prostitutes, some of which were on the young side.
John itched to ask the question, "but do you find me attractive?" Yes, he was overweight, short, and had bags underneath his eyes which blatantly told of his years as well as the harrowing ordeals he had been through. One could read about it on his face like a road map. Sherlock had said so once.
Of course, John figured. The man had probably not even caught on to the fact that 'Sherlock' was a name, as it was not something people would commonly name their male children in this area. Not that that was true for any part of the world, considering…
John smiled, squeezed out a tiny bit more aloe, and reached over to Sherlock’s face, applying it to his friend’s nose.
The sun was beginning its lazy descent past the mountains, and the place was getting dark, helped all the more by the trees surrounding the cabin. John really wished he had thought to bring a torch. Or a penlight. Or even a cigarette lighter would have been better than nothing.
Picking the lock on Sarah's trailer took Sherlock less than a minute, and he only had a piece of steel thread at his disposal. If he'd had his usual lock-picking toolkit, John guessed he could have done it in thirty seconds.
The boards constituting the wall above him cut painfully into his back, and the doctor felt his eyes tear up from the struggle to withstand the impulse of crying out. Sherlock's grip on John's hands became more forceful when he noticed the lack of progress by his friend, and he tugged with increased effort.
The idiot had also arrived on the scene and was now staring at him with a questioning look in its one remaining eye. The scar, which had blinded him on the left side, had distorted his features to the point of giving him a permanently surprised expression on his otherwise slack face. The creature, however, was not so retarded as to being completely unaware of its surroundings. The single eye, now focused on Sherlock, was gleaming with obvious childish interest. Like a child with an eye for a shiny new toy.
“In that case, I’m equally glad. I truly don’t know how you can handle him. He seems like he can barely handle himself.”
"Sherlock, I swear to God, if you're not answering just because you 'don't feel like it', I'm gonna…"
"The institution where Dr. Watson is located is a disgrace," Mycroft interjected. "Send Sherlock to the Maryland hospital."
COOLEX ANTIFREEZE was printed on the label in bold blue letters, though he could not read or decipher the letters themselves. He knew what the fluid was used for, and what could happen if someone were to drink it. Three-finger experimentally shook the bottle, listening to the slosh of the chemical within. It would be enough. Grabbing an nearby roll of industrial tape, he strode to the bed where the Outsider lay. The little whore's eyes were closed, but he had visibly winced at the sound of someone approaching.
Thankfully, a distraction arose. Turning their heads at the sound of laughter, the pair saw the two men exiting the sauna. Mary grinned and swam back to the pool steps.
“He’s going to need some help back to the lodge,” John said, his tone almost apologetic. Mary rested her hands on her hips as she watched the pair hobble towards the door, but she finally hurried over to them, grabbing the camera bag, towels, and John’s robe, allowing him a better grip on Sherlock. John was starting to lose count as to how often he felt like garbage towards her.
“What is that?” he asked, looking for the zoom option on the device. Finding it, he zoomed in on the sky. Fortunately, the scene had been photographed in high resolution, and the detail was still in clear quality. An area of the sky was slightly darker, stretching upward and dissipating.
John glanced down at his form, disgusted at the rolls which formed whenever he sat down. Then his eyes moved lower to the bushy nest of brown curls which surrounded his manhood, short and thick like the rest of him, now completely soft. He hated the way his pubic hair concealed nearly half of the shaft, making it appear even smaller. He should have at least thought to trim it down a bit.
"I'll make some tea," Mary announced, standing up. It was bad enough that she already felt like the fifth wheel on what was supposed to be a romantic getaway. "You want some?"
The blast of a shotgun tore through the air moments later, and John felt a sudden and intense pain in his right shoulder. The greater part of the leaden shots fired at him had missed their target and entered the coursing waters beneath him, but a few embedded themselves in his body with enough force to throw him back several feet. John landed heavily on his back, momentarily stunned, and could now discern the massive alpha standing on the rocky ledge above him. But more importantly, he saw the giant loading a new pair of cartridges into the double-barreled shotgun.
“Alright,” he said, his voice quiet. His mouth suddenly dry, he swallowed and looked up at her once more, not finding those angry, betrayed eyes any less difficult to speak to. “You said it perfectly earlier. This trip wasn’t just to be taken lightly. I wanted to go with you across the ocean because I want to be with you.”
A flicker of the past emerged in Mycroft's mind: an image of home, the home he and his brother knew decades ago. In the fleeting moment of regaining such a memory when the two of them were mere children, Mycroft Holmes responded to long practiced ritual. In a motion unbecoming of a dignified civil servant, he leapt onto the hospital bed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's twisting body. Though he did not wish further physical harm, he knew he had to squeeze tightly or else his brother would break loose and try to hurl himself off the bed.
The Outsider took in a mouthful of the foul liquid, but he refused to swallow. Three-finger was not surprised. A clever whore like this had figured out his plan very quickly. Once it swallowed, it would vomit. Three-finger would replace the tape when that happened, and if it was not enough, he had another roll to reinforce the barrier. The bitch would choke and drown in his own sick, and with a little luck, the chemical would not be detected by the time Sawtooth discovered the death of his plaything.
Yes, we finally have an update! To compensate our loyal readers for the long absence, we will provide you with a longer-than-average chapter. Enjoy!
“Ugh…” John rubbed at his face. “Must I say it? Thanks to my service in the Middle East… it’s… difficult when I have sex.”
"Nothing," Sherlock admitted, placing his fingers through the gap of the wall to once more make contact with his assistant. "I was just thinking about how it wouldn't have been the first time."
These three, however, could not be predicted to behave even like the most capricious human. Sherlock had no idea what their motives were, apart from the obvious desire to fill their stomachs.
Mary was still finding the notion of Sherlock naked amusing when she looked up at John, who seemed to be stuck in another world.
“Dirtier!” Sherlock snapped, clenching around his friend’s cock. It caused an unbearable, wonderful jolt of pain and pleasure to rush through John, reaching every extremity.
"Of course." Missy inclined her head and sauntered off, but not before giving the doctor a quick yet pointed glance, as if wordlessly asking "how did it go?" The smile remained on Nasim's face, friendly but strained. Mycroft was fairly sure of the type of news he was going to share.
John decided to let it be and seated himself behind the wheel. Predictably, the GPS refused to reveal any coordinates for the Avalon resort. The biggest town in the area turned out to be Cumberland, Maryland, and he set the GPS to that instead. If things got really bad, they could hopefully at least find a motel.
“You were different,” he finally said, though he could tell from the look in Sherlock’s eyes that the detective knew he had hit a nerve.
John and Mary passed through security without trouble and the flight departed on time. Their seats were coach class, and they thus had little space to move, but they still managed to sleep for some of the six hours of their first flight. They had to switch planes once they reached the United States, but their journey still went smoothly. Even so, John could not help a constant glancing behind him. He had to have been doing this every time they turned a corner. His behavior did not take very long to get noticed by Mary.
Some more unpleasant imagery ahead. Sensitive people be warned, but if you've come this far and are still reading, we really needn't warn you.
He nearly shook his head. His little brother insisted on not being treated like a baby or even the small child he was, and yet he still needed comfort from physical contact and plush companions.
Another kiss, followed by small nips at his throat. Not painful in any way, but nonetheless something that would leave marks.
"Oh, only sometimes," Sherlock replied, replacing his hand on the shoulder and giving a small smile when John took the hand in his own, squeezing back. "You handled me quite well when I collapsed in the sauna, after all. We'll have some tea, wait a little longer, and then take a look around, alright?"
"He's certainly never made them known!" John snapped back, realizing that this was exactly the reason for his bitterness toward Sherlock. The detective had his chance with him, but he'd elected to ignore it.
Despite what John said, he had not wanted her to die. There were times when he'd wished she would disappear out of John's life, when he'd purposely tried to drive her away and alienate her by his rude and uncouth behaviour, and when he had, admittedly, done his very best to sabotage her budding relationship with John using methods his friend referred to as 'morally depraved'. But he had never, ever wished the life out of her.
Bobbi  Ferguson meanwhile, was waiting for the detective and the doctor at the outdoor pool. As the weather was now warm enough, the pool outside was being used by substantially more people. Not to John’s surprise, most of them did not have particularly healthy body types. Not that John had ever thought of himself as especially prudish in the past, nor had he thought poorly of individuals who were overweight, as he hardly had the right to complain around some people, but suddenly seeing everyone so… exposed… It made him wary. Suddenly the thought of no clothes to separate him from others made him very nervous.
Sherlock shook his head. "Not yet. I'd like to have more to go on before sharing the news with my client." He took another sip of coffee. "We should investigate. I believe it is of vital importance to find the source of that smoke, as well as the man whose silhouette we see right here."
Before leaving, he glanced back at his brother's motionless form one final time. Anyone else might have spoken a farewell or reassurance to their own sibling were they in Mycroft's situation, perhaps held his hand, but the civil servant did not. Sherlock was unconscious; what good would it do?
“Right, then,” Sherlock announced quietly. “Now we…” he trailed off as he turned to address John, realizing the doctor was no longer by his side. In fact, John was already walking down the main road.
John briefly felt his face heat up from shame. No, he would not allow himself to feel guilty about that. Sherlock was a grown man - even though his behaviour sometimes contradicted it -  fully capable of making his own decisions. He had entered their so-called relationship very much aware that it might not work out. And they had remained friends... hadn't they?
John looked down as Sherlock easily worked the latex piece over his engorged organ. He caught the sight of several red marks in his peripheral vision and stared at them for a few seconds. The nips on his chest had been just enough to brand him, but only for a short while. Self-conscious and sensible, John preferred no marks at all, but if necessary liked these best. Though Sherlock could have cared less, he was considerate of his assistant.
“Did you really bring lube with you?” he asked. He should have been annoyed at Sherlock’s planning, but he could not help being amused.
The giant: size, weight, brute strength, experience. But his size is also a drawback, as well as his advanced age. A son challenging his father for leadership? The small one: fast, agile, dexterous, and quick-witted, but psychotic. The last can work as an advantage as well as a disadvantage. Not nearly as strong as the giant, naturally, and he's used to bending to his father's will. Will he this time?
Sherlock wanted to lie, both to Mycroft and himself. He did not want to remember anything from his stay in this damnable country. But his brother would no doubt retell what he knew of the story. The younger Holmes finally squeezed once.
Sherlock groaned at the sound of a door closing with a little more force than was necessary and opened his eyes. His head was throbbing with a dull pain, and his entire upper body, including his face, felt like it had been doused with gasoline and set on fire.
Mary pursed her lips, wanting so badly to believe every word John Watson was saying, to forgive him, to pretend he had not just shagged another man during her brief absence. Her pride and common sense, however, strongly advised against it. One did not simply forgive infidelity without at least thinking it through first.
“For now, let’s just enjoy each other’s company…?” he said, taking her hand. She nodded, nuzzling him until their lips met. John relaxed a little, fumbling with his caresses, but otherwise alright… until his belly touched her. His body tensed up, an action not missed by Mary, who cupped his face.
Again Sherlock found himself trudging through what felt to him like a very tactile fog. As his awareness slowly, uncomfortably returned to him, he only found himself not wanting to move from where he had been for the past few hours.
He was drawn back to his miserable state of existence by the giant alpha's harsh voice barking out an unintelligible order to the small one. Though clearly still displeased about the situation, there was nothing defiant in the three-fingered maniac's body language. He returned to his father moments later with a battered, oil-stained cup containing some kind of liquid.
Lifting his shotgun, the seven-foot-one hunter stomped forward like the veritable bull he was, cleft lip curled and serrated teeth exposed in a snarl.
The bedroom was certainly not the locale Sherlock had become used to over the years when it came to sexual interactions. In fact it was an improvement over the usual places where years ago he would offer favours of pleasure in exchange for money or drugs... or money to buy the drugs. Here it was warm, and much cleaner, and he was with someone he trusted and - though he would not quickly admit it out loud - cared about.
Sherlock shook his head, angry. Their bond had been strained in the past few days, but would the events of the week have been enough to allow John to escape with no further thoughts of his once partner, friend, and lover? No, not possible. Sherlock knew John much better than that. John was a soldier, loyal to the end.
“Mary, wait!” John followed her, but she hurried into their bedroom. As John entered, he saw that she was hurrying to get dressed.
"Amongst others..." the detective murmured, his attention now focused on the smallest set of prints. "This one worries me," he said, pointing to them. "The stride is different. See?"
The pulling suddenly shifted to a drop. If he really was not dead, he would have a new array of bruises to add to the old.
Mary's smooth, sleek body rubbed against his own underneath the surface of the water, and the contact predictably brought forth a familiar stir of arousal in him. His cock twitched with interest, accompanied by warmth pooling in the pit of his stomach which quickly spread downward.
The decapitated corpse had been mutilated to the point that it was impossible to tell if it was male or female. Strung up by its ankles, the amount of dried blood on the floor below it strongly suggested that the killing had taken place in the shed. The body was virtually devoid of soft tissues, further hindering identification.
“Don’t argue with me,” Sherlock said, locking eyes with the doctor. “There’s no argument, you want to have sex with her.”
"The man nearly killed you. You're telling me you're not even the tiniest bit afraid he might try again?"
"No," Mycroft said curtly. He didn't believe that Sherlock's history of drug abuse or mental illness was in any way relevant to his postoperative health status. "Apart from being slightly underweight, my brother is in good health."
"William," Mycroft hissed, his voice low and quiet despite its sharpness. "Our father will wake and he will seek us out if you carry on like this."
A mosquito whined in his ear, causing him to reflexively swat, and he moved on, this time to the beds. Only two were present, and they further strengthened his suspicion of the group being relatively few in number, unless they shared sleeping space.
A single tear formed in the  corner of the detective's left eye and slowly trickled down his cheek, leaving a clear trail of clean, visible skin in its wake. Sherlock himself was unaware of the tear. He watched the John of his memories, busy doing all kinds of domestic chores abhorred by Sherlock himself; filling the kettle, heating the kettle, pouring tea into a pair of mugs, one for Sherlock and one for himself, then adding milk and a teaspoon of honey to Sherlock's tea and two bits of sugar to his own.
"You're lucky to have a brother like him," the doctor said, surprised to realize he really meant it.
Mycroft poured himself a generous helping of whiskey and leaned back in his chair, letting the liquor warm his mouth and insides. He tried to convince himself that nothing untoward was going on. Only two days had passed, and his brother and John Watson were on a vacation.
Back against a tall pine tree, the ex-army surgeon contemplated his options. Damn it, he was supposed to be better at this. He was a soldier, after all; however not a strategist. Making a plan of attack had never been his forte.
"Yes, strange, isn't it?" Sherlock countered, his bright blue eyes boring into the woman. "Don't you ever wonder why no decent-looking folks become nudists?"
According to the detective's calculations, it would take forty-eight hours of silence on his part before Mycroft began making inquiries, perhaps sixty, depending on his brother's schedule. If they could manage to stay alive that long…
It was different from last time. His conscious mind had blocked much of what happened when he was shot as a coping mechanism, but certain bits remained accessible in his dreams; not as coherent, structured memories but fragmental pieces from here and there. The blazing sun, the blue sky, the baking hot desert sand against his face, and what was perhaps the most pungent memory of all: the smattering noise of machine gun fire coming from a variety of directions.
"You should have alerted me," he continued, gripping the receiver to the point of whitening knuckles.
John opened his mouth to yell further insults at the detective, and though it would have been momentarily gratifying, he came to realize how unproductive it was, and Sherlock, despite his emotional shortcomings, did not deserve to be used as John's outlet for frustrations. He sat next to his friend on the couch and redirected his attention to the laptop screen.
"Can we at least get dressed this time?" John asked, looking down at his dressing gown and slippers with a critical eye.
His drowsiness must have been taking over now, because Missy seemed to vanish within the blink of an eye. Stifling a yawn, despite having no audience, Mycroft first removed the damnable Kevlar vest he had been wearing for hours now, though it felt more like days. The coolness which reached his sweat-soaked shirt and skin placed a mental note in him to get a shower after he awoke. Still taking the time to smooth out his suit before settling himself, he lay staring at the ceiling for a half minute until he closed his eyes. He found the racing thoughts inside his brain slowing much sooner than expected, and within minutes he was asleep.
Sherlock drifted in and out of awareness as he was carried back to the cabin. His first moment of consciousness brought the odd sensation of bits of his hair being tugged on, and the deep-throated chuckles of the inbred madmen caused him to realize that he was being teased and played with by the mid-sized cannibal, who had become very fond of his dark curls. Sherlock passed out once more.
"Quite right, but that wasn't the first time that man had hit Sherlock. He'd sported some suspicious bruises before, but he insisted it was nothing, and I didn't take action. I could have had Moran apprehended and incarcerated on a multitude of charges, ranging from assault to fraud to possession of narcotics, but I didn't. I suppose I didn't want Sherlock to despise me more than he already did."
Mycroft sat quietly and calmly back in the room where his brother still lay unconscious, only looking up when the door opened to reveal Dr. Nasim. The physician was smiling, but doubt shone in his eyes.
John was not as fit as he'd been during his military days, and one casual, off-hand comment from Sherlock about the length of his endowment had affected him deeply. It had happened during one of their infrequent sexual encounters. Sherlock's mouth, not rattling rude deductions for once, had been tightly wrapped around his cock, and John was doing his best not to simply grab his flatmate's unruly curls and fuck his face hard.
Mycroft never thought himself the superstitious type, but he was the type who could never be too cautious. Part of his mind nagged that the moment he stepped away to freshen up, something might happen... although even if it did, was he able to do much about it? He was about to make up his mind when a doctor, face initially obscured by a surgical mask, turned the corner to join them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "You can either shout at me and call me a heartless wretch, or you can come look at my findings. Which is it?"
“I’m fine, don’t touch me!” he snapped venomously as he reclined spread-eagle on the furniture. He looked nearly ready to snarl as John approached him with a penlight for further inspection.
Anthea had already arranged a flight for immediate travel over the Atlantic Ocean. Ever reliable, she had made all the arrangements; not that Mycroft was incapable of making them himself, even in situations worse than this, but having a trustworthy PA certainly made things easier.
"Sherlock!" the doctor objected, noticing with despair how Mary's features closed up entirely once more.
The officer who had unzipped the suitcase and was consecutively the first to behold the contents promptly ran over to set of bushes to throw up. The sound of his (rather loud) retching could be heard by his colleagues as well as Mycroft, and they all, elite tactical team training aside, seemed hesitant to look into the suitcase again.
"It was a shithole. And you know it. You chose it simply because it was the cheapest you could find."
"I suppose you might call it that," John confessed. "But we have them all the time. You know how he is!"
Curiosity burning like Sherlock's sun-baked skin, John clicked the sign-in button. The contact list was scant, to say the least. However, there was one name present which left John torn between surprised at its presence and not surprised whatsoever.
Sherlock stared at the floor for a few seconds before answering. John patiently waited for an answer. Patience was the least he could give him, after all.
"Perhaps you can imagine my disappointment," Mycroft began, "at crossing the ocean and reaching this damnable hospital, only to find that the Sherlock Holmes who was interred here is not Sherlock Holmes at all."
Mycroft dispassionately scribbled his signature onto the documents and thrust them brusquely back into Anthea's hands.
"My bloody girlfriend, that's what's going on!" John hissed, and shame over what he had done washed over him like a huge black wave of crude oil. What had he been thinking? And more importantly, what could he do to make things right?
Only after his initial frustration had eased slightly did he notice the writing equipment the other had passed him. He might not be able to speak nor move his right arm a whole lot, but John was left-handed and fortunately his left hand still obeyed his brain's commands relatively well, even though it was shaking moderately when he picked the pencil up and positioned it over the lined paper.
"John..." The gap was infiltrated by pale fingertips, and John quickly put his own hand forward, their fingers meeting. The contact was not much at all, but it was something.
Lovely. This bloody country and its mountains...! Sherlock nearly threw his mobile phone as he had John's pillow, but he hardly wanted the phone itself to break.
"I do not care what you think," he finally said, keeping his head high. "This is no business of yours. You are not a part of this relationship, whether you like to believe so or not."
Pressing a knee against the whore's hips, Sawtooth maintained his full weight on the naked body beneath him, and he did not ignore the cries of fear and discomfort; in fact he reveled in them. Three-finger cackled at the pathetic Outsider's pain, gleeful like a child over the inevitable.
A stop sign. Her heart leapt. The sign was very small, but she could see it nonetheless, and a sign meant higher traffic. Opening the driver's side door, she lifted herself above the hood and tried to make out the location of the street beyond such dense vegetation. If she was seeing correctly, she would have to turn around and regularly stop to keep her bearings of the sign itself. But her hope had been reignited.
"He has not come out of his room since yesterday," John said slowly, unsure of how much he should reveal to Mycroft. "And he refuses to speak to me. He's not even invested in the case anymore. I fear he might be lapsing into a depression."
No sooner had he readied the pill in his palm with intent to swallow that his mobile rang. He instinctively picked up, replacing the capsule into its bottle.
He looked up at the face on the screen. If Mycroft was feeling any pain from the memory, he was certainly hiding it extremely well.
“If you could pass that to me within the next few hours…” Sherlock trailed off venomously, gesturing to the nearby bottle of aloe that Mary had left out.
John glanced back at Sherlock once more, and saw the way his friend gritted his teeth, glaring at their captors. Despite their horror, both doctor and detective shared in the anger of the idea of harm directed toward the other. Still, though he looked desperate to speak (a silent Sherlock Holmes was a rare thing indeed) John's friend remained silent. Any other individual might start begging, but not Sherlock. Even if they could understand English, what was the use of reasoning with monsters like these?
Nasim left, and Mycroft was once again left alone with his unconscious sibling. Sherlock looked slightly less like a gross and mutilated corpse now that he had been cleaned and had his wounds dressed, but even now it was painfully obvious that parts of his skin would be left with permanent scarring.
Sherlock scoffed, leaning back in his seat. "Of course, that is the only way these "people" can communicate." He suddenly felt his thirst and regretted not buying a drink from the airport. John, however, had bought a bottle of 7up and stuffed it into his carry-on bag. Sherlock reached for the drink, thinking that he had preferred another brand - preferably something containing caffeine - but he decided not to mention it.
The simple-minded man was ordered to pull him up into a more seated position, likely to prevent him from choking. Sherlock glanced at the meal on the tray table, knowing it was meant for him. An idiot such as the one lifting him up could have figured this out.
“Yes, yes…” John replied, rubbing his temples. “And I’m sure it will be an engaging case indeed, but for now, it’s getting late and we haven’t had any proper sleep since before we were on a plane. I think Mary and I might turn in for the night.”
The little madman was visibly fidgeting. Sherlock chalked it up to more than the creature's innate restlessness; how the three-fingered mountain man's hand returned over and over to touch the blade stored in a sheath by its belt only to let go the following second, as though catching itself doing something it shouldn't.
Only to realize that he couldn't see anything. Darkness. He was enshrouded in darkness. The momentary relief of not being assaulted by bright light quickly passed into a feeling of great unease. Why could he not see anything? Where was he? Memories of having been shoved into a closet flitted through his memories, first by Mycroft to keep him safe from Father, and later by Sebastian as a punishment for angering his then-boyfriend. In recent years, Sherlock often sought out the closet on his own accord, as it was the perfect place to quiet the noise inside his head.
"Is he in any pain?" Mycroft asked in a muted voice. The graveyard atmosphere of the ward made him hesitant to speak up at his usual volume.
Sherlock was able to move through the rooms of his memory palace with preternatural speed, and his next destination was John's bedroom one story up. There, in the doctor's modest wooden-frame bed, he saw himself and the doctor having sex for the first time.
Mycroft kept his expression like a blank slate, not only from the grotesque sight before him, but the question put forth. He hardly wanted to think of Dr. Watson at the moment, his own emotions barging in against rational thought.
Not until he saw the reflection of sunlight did he look closer. It could have been from a body of water, but…
John scribbled down a quick question on the notepad for Mycroft to read, although he dreaded the answer.
He finished his breakfast quickly and in silence, doing his best to ignore the fact that the tea was watery and the scones tasted like dry paper towel. He decided it didn't matter. What he needed at this point was carbohydrates to provide energy for his brain and last him through until lunchtime.
As his eldest proceeded to prepare for their emergency evacuation and leading the youngest outside, Sawtooth glowered at the whore, still unshackled on the floor in a little ball. Based on the trembling alone, the pathetic creature was likely unable to get up and escape even if it wanted to. But what would be done with it? The clan was going to escape detection, but their captive had a distinct chance of being nothing but a liability in their journey.
"If you don't stop, you could hurt yourself," John pointed out. "And I'm not taking you to the A&E again."
Sherlock uselessly tugged on his bonds, reaching the conclusion he had already suspected: there was no way he was getting out of here on his own. The unnatural and static position he had been forced into began to take a toll on his body in general, and his shoulder joints in particular. The detective prided himself on having a high tolerance for physical pain. Oftentimes he was able to ignore amounts of it that had stronger men crying like newborns. But even the great Sherlock Holmes had limits.
Sherlock was, from a single look in his direction, able to deduce the outcome of the evening and gleefully shouted deductions from his small laboratory set up on the kitchen table, until John could not take it anymore and retreated, wordlessly, into his bedroom. He had prepared for a lonely, sleepless night in misery, but sometime later, with John still wakeful, Sherlock crept into the bed, naked, all lips and hands and cock, blissfully silent except for occasional gasps and groans. John had welcomed the contact, clinging to Sherlock while the detective fucked him, and almost-crying against his long neck. His own cock had kept up, despite the multiple beers, and he came practically in tandem with Sherlock.
One-Eye glanced at his bitten fingers. Three-finger could have a look at it, perhaps fix the damage done... if he was in a forgiving enough mood.
"All the better then," Sherlock retorted acidly. He marched over to the kitchen counter and ran his burnt hand under a cold tap under absolute silence. Though John utterly failed to deduce what had caused Sherlock's pitch black mood, he could tell from his friend's bearing, as well as the granite muscles hidden beneath his silk robe, that it was a serious matter.
The patriarch glared down at Three-finger, who was getting dressed, twitching and snorting through his nostrils like a giant hairless weasel. Glancing back at the whore that was still trying in vain to get the head away from itself, Sawtooth kicked at his son, snapping at him to get up and go scout the woods.
John could not help feeling as though he should be laying down on a sofa as Mycroft took notes. He then had to wonder how Sherlock himself would do in a psychologist's office. He had to have been sent to a psychologist at least once in his past, and knowing Sherlock, the interaction could not have gone well.
It had to happen eventually, he conceded to himself. Unless Sherlock simply stayed asleep, never having to worry about the agonies that came with the trauma. But that was the option only a coward would take, no matter how many times he could weakly excuse it to himself as doing his little brother a favor.
Glancing toward the now closed shed, hiding the macabre sight within, John was struck by a thought. He did not want to go back into the shed, never again. And yet…
"Western Maryland Health System is relatively close to us, and its supplies are more up to date," a medivac worker shouted out in suggestion as they all gathered inside the thunderously loud aircraft.
Anthea nodded, though she had already predicted his answer and chosen it for him. Hell, an idiot could have predicted it.
Mycroft's voice was instantly recognized, breaking Sherlock from his unsteady train of thought. The tangible fog still clinging around his brain left him assuming he was home, except that very telling smell was back. The smell he remembered from his last waking.
Rolling onto his side, partly to get closer to the knife, partly to recoil out of instinct, he watched as the skinny hunter staggered to its feet, reeling a little from the impact of the butt of the leader's shotgun against its head. Even with a pain threshold like few other creatures, a concussion was not something to simply shrug off. Still, the maniac hissed and sputtered like a cat, yammering out some unintelligible argument, and stepped forward to once again challenge the giant. But following the blow to the head, the shorter hunter was now the slower of the two, and the clan leader grabbed his troublesome charge by the neck.
They left Avalon with only a few words uttered between them. The sun was quickly descending into the west, and John estimated they had less than two hours of daylight left. He hardly dared to consider the options if they came up with nothing on this excursion.
"The police say she left voluntarily," Bobbi said, slightly stunned by Sherlock's brusque approach. "But I don't believe that. Rich - that's Sarah's husband - is kind of a dick. He's cheated on her in the past, he drinks, and he has a temper. I don't believe he's ever hit her, but once she told me he pushed her to the floor..." Bobbi caught herself rambling again and cleared her throat.
Though tempted to bring the subject to light of only to simply apologize, John decided against it. For all he knew, he had alerted the criminals to their presence from screaming like an idiot for Mary. If so, had his crying of her name cause them to panic and thus kill her? His brain was traveling in loops upon retread thoughts and worries, and it was doing neither him or his partner any good. Instead, he kept his eyes wandering as they traveled the road, following the tire tracks.
Doctor John Watson closed his eyes, but that did little to block out the continuous drumming of Sherlock's feet against the wall. It had gone on for a while, and John knew better than to cater to the other's infantile need for attention - it would only exacerbate the situation - but it was still getting on his nerves. Especially as he was trying to focus on reading.
Mycroft hesitated ordering (no, "suggesting"; he had to remind himself he was on US soil and technically had no jurisdiction here) the SWAT team to unearth the grave, fearful of what they might find. He tried to convince himself that it would not make any sense for the mountain men to have buried a freshly killed corpse, as their primary motivation for hunting humans was to put food in their bellies, and that the recently upturned soil was more likely to contain meat buried for preservation purposes.
"People at the resort are being questioned," he replied. "Discretion is difficult due to the locale and structure of the place, much to my annoyance. It escapes me that any institution could be so poorly organized, but perhaps that says something of this country... my point being that we are continuing to search for clues as to where you've been. Perhaps something can be shaken from your brain...?"
John tried to search the other man's face for clues to this sudden aversion toward him, but as always, Sherlock guarded his emotions well. What reason did
"That's all?" he sputtered, feeling a strong urge to want to throttle Mycroft Holmes. It was surpassed only by the even stronger urge to end the lives of the abominable men who had done such terrible things to Sherlock.
John fears Sherlock is lapsing into a depression and turns to the one man he can trust with Sherlock-related matters: Mycroft Holmes.
"In your first email to me, you hinted at something. I dismissed it then, didn't figure it had any relevance. Now I believe it might have."
Sherlock's outburst proved that gentility would no longer be effective. All Mycroft could presently do was hold on.
John was the first to awake the following morning, the sun hardly yet illuminating the sky. Sherlock had to have still been asleep, as no noises of the detective's usual bored activities could be heard through his closed door. No banging on walls, no dangerous experiments involving any household products he could find in the lodge... John opened the door as carefully and quietly as possible, peeked inside, and saw his partner curled up in a foetal position, limbs twisted in bedcovers as though he had lost a fight with them.
John's question was met with a scoff from the red-haired man. "Not I, Doctor. I work for the government. I would never have been granted security clearance if I'd had a mental illness. But our father."
"Too much of a coincidence?" he asked. Sherlock joined hands together as if in prayer, leaning back. A ghost of a smile moved his lips and was gone just as quickly as it had appeared. "I have a question or two to ask our client." Closing the laptop, he stood and began to remove his clothes.
Some unpleasant discoveries are made, and our heroes suddenly find themselves engaged in a game of life or death.
"That's right," Jed encouraged. "Jest lie there. Stay put and relax, and ya'll be in a hospital in no time."
Mary immediately noticed the dogged expression on his face, and her eyebrows shot up against her forehead.
It seemed the other two family members were out at the moment. It surprised the detective slightly that they trusted the idiot to be left alone with a captive. Granted he was tied up and largely incapacitated, but he didn't doubt for a moment that the giant and the scrawny one were unaware of his wits and resourcefulness.
He was unable to deduce further, however, because the hand which pulled away from his teeth formed into a fist and slammed down on his head, sending him into oblivion.
After at least ten more seconds of gazing at his brother, Mycroft nodded as though in approval, then turned to the doctor.
Sherlock's bout of consciousness fortunately did not last long. Mycroft abhorred the thought of his little brother being aware of what had been done to him - that he had not only been raped and tortured, but
John shook his head, wishing there was some way to talk Sherlock out of pursuing this trail. Not only was it illogical and against all common sense, but completely absurd. Even if they could locate the man in the photo, what would they ask him? If he had abducted any women recently? If he enjoyed hiding in the undergrowth to spy on naked hikers? If he was an inbred lunatic?
“You’re right,” John said, picking up his luggage. “Let’s go. We could use all the daylight we can get.”
John sobbed for perhaps two minutes before he was able to get a hold of himself again. He hardly needed any further burden to his breathing, and he had allowed himself his moment of tears.
Pressed against the tree trunk like a squirrel, he crept around its circumference until he could see the cabin and its grounds. Though his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, the nightfall had not brought moonlight with its arrival, and looking for anyone creeping about on the property proved difficult. In addition, the flickering lamplight brought moving shadows that deceived his vision. Despite the difficulty, he heard no footsteps, and he considered this a good sign.
The air inside the trailer was stagnant and stuffy, but John assumed it was simply from the amount of time the trailer had been uninhabited. Sarah Cavanaugh had been missing for six days.
Standing on all fours over the bound, slender detective, the retarded mountain man continued the intimate groping and exploration of Sherlock's body, but it made no attempts to spread his legs or to free its engorged member from the layers of clothing. Instead it seemed content to simply dry hump him, thrusting aimlessly and slobbering like an over-excited dog.
“How was the casino?” he finally asked, desperate to sound casual. Instead he sounded like an idiot… or a smug bastard.
John glared at him. “Do you want to help me with Mary or are you really just trying to drive us apart?”
With the eagerness of a child knowing they had a special occasion coming up, William leapt into his sibling's bed and giggled gleefully as he crawled in underneath the comforter, Bee firmly clasped in the bend of his elbow. The mattress squeaked out a protest at being pounced on so roughly, and though he knew it was unlikely, Mycroft worried that any sound out of the ordinary might rouse the slumbering Holmes patriarch.
Sherlock thought he might have blacked out from the pain, because the sudden presence of the man-child's relatives remained undetected by him until the giant leader stepped right into view. He growled and shoved the heavy oaf off of their quarry and was soon joined by the smallest, who closely inspected the leg which still sat in the grip of iron jaws. The scrawny madman was soaked through, clearly having gone into the distant river. John was not with them presently, but blood still decorated wet overalls. Sherlock's powers of deduction were beginning to suffer from his current state, and rational thoughts of reassurance made way for the awful fear that his best friend was now dead.
The boy considered. The offer almost had a certain superstitious ring to it, as though his brother's bed were a little invisible hovel of protection. Protection from other accidents... from their father, possibly. William wanted to believe he was too old to believe in such things, but the notion was terribly persuasive.
They followed the path for about half a mile, an oppressive silence heavy between them. Sherlock had done a better job than John keeping his emotions reined in, but the way he clenched his jaw suggested that the detective was either very nervous or upset; probably a mixture of both. John couldn't help feeling like a liability that had done nothing except inconvenience Sherlock the whole time, and there was no doubt the younger man still held a grudge toward John for his earlier words.
Would he be raped again? Would part of him be eaten? Sherlock's brain still worked well enough to deduce that he would not. He heard no cackling from the skinny psycho that might indicate the excitement of oncoming torture. Glancing aside, he happened to see the idiot standing nearby, yawning and rubbing at his solitary eye. It was then that Sherlock realized the darkness of his surroundings was not from weakened vision, but rather from the approach of night. Obviously the hunters wanted to use their beds, and their wretched guest was taking up too much space.
This was good enough of an explanation to Nasim, and the doctor went on his way with a mumbled encouragement to page him if something went amiss.
He had just enough time to take a step to the side when the creature pounced, or he would have been caught underneath it and probably killed on the spot. With nearly catlike grace, the attacker landed and then righted itself, holding the knife Sherlock had glimpsed seconds before. The fading light revealed a man, Sherlock's height or shorter, and slight in build, but nonetheless sporting a well-developed musculature. Those, however, were the extent of his humanlike qualities.
The man-child reared back, whimpering pitiably and raising a hand to shield his face from blows. Sawtooth, not easily swayed by displays of submission from his dumb youngest son, delivered yet another swipe for good measure. This time One-Eye more than whimpered; he virtually howled, and a disgruntled hiss sounded from Three-finger, protesting against further punishment inflicted on his sibling.
"Our suspicions were correct," the younger man said gently. "Rumors have been going around for decades of something being in the woods.
With the combined effort from both Mycroft and the second nurse, Sherlock, despite his raging and flailing, was turned onto his side as the first nurse prepared a syringe. After their patient's bare backside was exposed, the first nurse drove the needle into one of the soft, pale cheeks.
John could imagine how such an episode had played out, but only a little. Considering how both Holmes brothers behaved, their childhood had to have been far from ordinary, even without mental illness.
John reacted as though he'd received a physical blow to the gut. Sherlock always knew where it would hurt the most.
For a split second, John considered the possibility of being about to outmaneuver this man as well, but he was quickly proven wrong when the giant adjusted his grip on a rifle.
Missy still did not touch him, but she determinedly steered him toward a small clutter of uncomfortable-looking plastic chairs reserved for visitors, clearly intending him to take a seat in one of them. Mycroft's sore, aching body abhorred at the thought, but he did not have it in him to protest. He sat down, holding back a pained groan. He must have pulled a muscle, crouching in that goddamn ditch.
"We've investigated for quite a while," John noted aloud, not without a little trepidation. "We should get going."
With trembling hands, Mary reached for the capped water bottle in her purse, suddenly wondering if she ought to ration it. Keeping her breathing slow and her eyes shut, she unscrewed the lid, took a careful gulp, and fumbled with the cap as she tried to close the bottle. She could not stay hidden in the car all day, but the prospect of wandering in the woods all alone still frightened her. Mary took a deep breath, opened her eyes, and opened the door... And froze as she saw the movement of sunlight on metal not twenty yards away.
A throbbing headache had already started beneath John's temples, and the descent of the plane made it much worse. He wondered if he could blame that on Sherlock too.
"Close it down!" Sherlock shouted, making stabbing gestures at the screen and his brother's image. "If I have to look at that face one more second I'll be sick!"
The elder Holmes glanced up at his PA, and for a split second his unyielding dark blue eyes - a different shade than Sherlock's, but no less piercing - looked ready to shoot flashes and Anthea feared he would actually strike her. Immediately she wished she could take back her pathetic attempt at comfort. It was not her place.
John was about to give up and close the laptop when the window expanded and a familiar face filled the screen. Already Mycroft looked vaguely annoyed and slightly puzzled to see not his brother but his brother's assistant.
"Do we have a map?" Mary asked hesitantly. "What if we get lost trying to find our way? I hear that area can be difficult to navigate."
On the inside, the trailer was messy, with clothing haphazardly thrown about, as well as lots of stacked boxes. John was relieved not to see any obvious filth or dirt, but he would not have wanted to sit down on her couch with nothing between his skin and the fabric of the cushions. At least Sherlock had thought to bring his own towel.
Taking a deep breath, the doctor then left Sherlock's bedroom, almost hoping that his flatmate would never awaken so that John would not have to confront him about his findings.
Giving William an outright bath at this time of night may cause a little too much noise, Mycroft reasoned. Flannels and a sink would have to do for now; the bath itself would have to wait until morning.
He had barely started his descent before he heard that damnable laugh in the distance, something that he might hear in his nightmares if he were to survive this ordeal. Stumbling as he climbed, he scrambled downward and clung to a small wall where land had been carved out from floods in the past, suggesting that for all of the trouble he would have in crossing the river, at least the waters were not as deep as they once had been. He pressed against the wall, listening as the deranged giggling became steadily louder.
When Sherlock nudged him on the shoulder, he looked up to see a crowbar being offered to him. Clenching his fists for a moment, John stood up and took his weapon.
"Yes, I'm here," Mycroft replied. His tone, though quiet, was not one of gentle reassurance, but rather plain confirmation; though a relative keeper of the peace of their home country and a born diplomat, he was not exactly known for his bedside manner.
The doctor promptly sat up. He had only registered the words, not the good-natured, teasing tone they were uttered with. "No, Mary, that's not true...--!"
John's jaw quivered and he looked ready to argue otherwise, but then he shook his head and looked back at the shed. Sherlock watched, alternating between disbelief and a lack of surprise as John sat back down, back pressed against the shed's door.
“I’m going out,” she simply said. Though still in a daze from the alcohol, the shock had sobered her temporarily.
Sherlock gestured at John to be quiet and follow him, and together they hurried along the edges of the field, the detective clearly intent on showing something to his partner. Though Sherlock's stony mask of a face did not reveal anything, his near-spasmodic grip on John's wrist suggested he had made an unpleasant discovery.
The one-eyed brute jumped up from his seat and rushed forward towards Sherlock, but the detective did not so much as flinch, ever defiant. Sherlock might have also suspected a clan member this childish might not be as big of a threat as a blithering psychopath or a tower of muscle, but John was nervous all the same. After all, people were capable of awful things when they did not know any better.
Mary threw herself at the driver side window, hell bent on getting out before this monster could get a hold of her. She was blind to everything else, uncaring that she cut open the skin of her forearms against the shards left by the broken window, or that she was likely to be intercepted by him as soon as she had gotten to her feet. All that mattered now was to get out of his reach. The car was a fortress she had to abandon. The siege was over.
"Sherlock, will you be able to walk?" John asked, placing his arm around the detective's back to encourage him to stand up.
"Now is a perfect time," Mycroft cut in, taking the clipboard with the documents from her. He knew, naturally, that Sherlock's treatment in America would not be given for free, but money had never been a problem for the Holmes family, and he would happily finance anything that was needed to ensure his brother's recovery out of his own pocket. Sherlock, given his lifestyle and the dangers that went with it, had not enjoyed paid-for health insurance in years, instead having relied on the NHS and Mycroft's influence as a "minor" government official to fund his - admittedly rather frequent - use of medical resources.
An enormous scarred hand grabbed the thrashing young man by the neck, thus effectively immobilizing him, and with his other hand, the clan leader pinched Sherlock's nostrils shut. For a moment, everything blackened before Sherlock's eyes, and when he came to several seconds later, he was gulping for oxygen like a fish on dry land. The mountain men had achieved the desired reaction in their victim, and while Sherlock was greedily inhaling mouthfuls of air, the smallest hunter shoved a forkful of meat into his mouth.
“Hopefully the rooms are comfortable,” Mary remarked. A hand touched John’s knee, making him squirm out of instinct. “With a nice big bed.”
No! John refused to think it. Instead he continued his run into the woods surrounding the cabin grounds. He could hear that... thing following him, deep, gravelly voice laughing like a child as it lumbered along. Careening into the undergrowth and feeling the scrape of shrubbery against his skin, John glanced back only briefly, worried he might stumble or collide with a tree or low hanging branch. Though large and bulky in stature, the freakish man was still fast. John could only hope that he might be able to outmaneuver his attacker - or even better, outsmart it. If so, the doctor would have to think fast and hope he could keep his bearings better than a criminal who had been living in these woods all its life.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, and immediately John withdrew his hands, afraid to have hurt the other. "I'm sorry, Sherlock."
Sherlock never brought anyone home - that much John was certain of - so he assumed these casual encounters took place in a shoddy men's room, or in the backseat of someone's car. Perhaps even in the shadows of a dark alley way. What he could not be certain of, one way or another, was if Sherlock bothered to use protection.
Varied possessions - camping equipment, travel-sized games for children, sports gear - had been left haphazardly about the site, deemed useless by the criminals. Much of the blood stains he saw had gone brown with age, and John wondered just how long these bastards had been committing their acts of cruelty. According to the news articles, the stories went as far back as the fifties, but had this group - no doubt several generations of a family - been preying on the innocent even longer?
Sherlock responded by giving the doctor one of his derisive half-sneers. "Only when you find it convenient, isn't that right?"
The detective and his assistant made their way up the hill behind which Sherlock had claimed they would find the cabin. John momentarily lost his balance, sending a small current of rocks tumbling down the slope. Sherlock's hand shot out like the head of a striking cobra, grasping the doctor's arm, while his other hand wordlessly gesticulated the need for absolute silence.
The patriarch growled out a reminder: they had little time to waste. That certainly put a damper on his son's plans. Perturbed, Three-finger pressed his face to the whore's neck and inhaled the stink of sweat, infection and fear. He had to think of something. Something swift and satisfying, that left the little creature to suffer.
Watching Sherlock had distracted John from the tortuous inspection by his captors, and he yelped in both pain and surprise when he felt the hand squeezing his stomach replaced by the tip of the awl. The smaller man cackled at his reaction. John looked down instinctively to inspect the damage, but he could not see if skin was broken from the angle at which he hanged. Even so, he felt no dripping of blood. Another prod with the awl had him shouting muffled curses of anger and pain, but again he did not think he was bleeding.
The feeling in John's arms returned painfully when the skinny freak behind him wrapped arms and legs around him, hanging by the doctor off of the ground. He felt the fine edge of the dirty blade against his throat, saw the underdeveloped stump of what would have been a middle and ring finger on the monster's left hand, which held the knife. A drop of spittle landed on the junction of neck and shoulder. But John could do nothing; the three-fingered monstrosity was wrapped around him tightly, stuck on him like a leech.
"We have a trauma unit working to repair the damage done to your brother. The best of the best. I want you to know that he's being given the best possible care--"
John could both hear and feel the rush of blood in his ears. "Nothing that we haven't done a hundred times before," he murmured and purposely avoided looking into the camera.
"When Bobbi Ferguson first wrote to me, she mentioned "disappearances". In plural. When she described the case to me in closer detail, I paid no attention to her initial words, dismissing them as a simple typo, but today I began to wonder about their significance."
John wasn't sure if Mycroft's "us" was a reference to Brits as a people, or just the two of them, and he didn't ask. He could care less about the Americans and their patriotic celebrations. He would only celebrate if his best friend and lover was brought back to him alive. Mycroft's information regarding the date was troubling.
Though he was at first loath to admit it, the younger man's appearance brought back long forgotten memories of Sawtooth's deceased mate. She had died giving birth to his youngest son, who had entered the world as a tiny, screaming, pink, dumb lump and eventually evolved into a big, fat lump, all grown but still just as dumb. Had Three-finger not been so attached his younger sibling, Sawtooth would have put him on a spit and roasted him before he got to experience his fifth spring. He could tell by then that One-Eye was useless and dumb and would never contribute to feeding the clan. Now, twenty-eight springs later, all the clan's youngest was good for was manual labour.
Where the IV needle had been attached was now being irritated by the young genius, forcing blood to resurface even more profusely. Sherlock's vision was compromised, as was the strength in his body, but he "wrote" in large letters, smearing the claret across his sheet. At the current size of the writing, Mycroft was able to decipher the crude penmanship across the pathetic thread-count linens.
"I am remaining with my brother for the remainder of his care," he immediately replied, not slowing in his steps. The nurse held out a hand, though she thoughtfully did not touch him.
“Thank you,” John said gently as he was passed the batteries. Tossing the dead ones, he inserted the replacements. “I’m sorry things are going so lousy.”
Right. He was almost dead. His brain was barely working. He felt time moving like molasses. The progress of the paramedics could not seem to go any slower.
John suspected he had passed out once again, because in the length of time he took to blink, he noticed he was being moved, albeit very carefully.
Mary only made a noise of agreement. She had not interacted with Sherlock very much, but she had a very good grip on his behaviour, partly from John’s own descriptions and anecdotes, partly from observation alone. She felt like David Attenborough, witnessing the behaviors of mollusks.
"You're so great at this, Sherlock," the doctor had said, hand tangled in the detective's sticky, damp curls after having shot his load down Sherlock's throat. "You're just a natural, aren't you?"
"And so I'm trying my damnedest to win her back, convince her that it was all a mistake, that it wouldn't happen again. And of course she's not buying it, and..."
"What does that look like to you?" Sherlock accepted his cup of coffee and took a sip, but without taking his eyes off the screen.
The relentless shock of discovering Sherlock, believing him dead, then realizing he was alive collided with exhaustion. In standing up, Mycroft felt a numbness pass through him so fleetingly yet so powerfully, enough to make him dizzy and lose balance. His hand shot out and landed in the dirt surrounding him and the suitcase, preventing complete collapse. Even so, his exhaustion was painfully obvious to the SWAT team.
He quickly spun on his heel, ready to exit the sauna, when it occurred to him that John had remained seated and made no move to follow. His face took on a look of exhilarated desperation, bordering on mania.
"Hello sir," the woman - five foot six, dark wavy hair in a ponytail, name tag "Missy", mid-thirties, kind face, but lines on her brow suggested she had experience with difficult patients, clearly deliberately chosen to deal with him - automatically greeted him. "Are you feeling alright?"
"There is no "but". I really do want to." He swallowed nervously, trying desperately to re-moisturize his suddenly parched throat. What he was about to say was one of the most embarrassing things that could happen to a man, but Mary needed to be reassured that the problem was his, and his alone.
John was now close enough to Sherlock where they could see one another's faces. To the older man's confusion, Sherlock's eyes held no tears. The detective looked right at him, and though he looked miserable and in utmost agony, he was staring at John pointedly, expressing a wordless message to his partner.
Once his vision had become clear, he began to truly feel the relief of being in a hospital room. However, he was not alone in his thoughts for more than two seconds before he realized he had a visitor. Upon recognition he wondered if he really was in hell.
Sherlock gave her a supercilious smile. "We won't need a map, when we've got something much better," he said.
The doctor, naturally, paid him no regard. John yanked the door open, and the first sensory impression made aware by his brain was the sickeningly sweet, tangy odor of blood and rotting flesh combined. It struck him in the face like a physical wall, and he instinctively reared back from its pungency, not even helped by his medical training which he believed to have desensitized him to the smells associated with death and decomposition.
Sawtooth stared at the skinny, unblemished body hanging so delectably before him with a sudden hunger that was different from the kind that demanded he fill his stomach. He desired this Outsider. As a food source the man would be poor; his body, as had been established, consisted mostly of skin, bone and sinews. He was considerably lighter than a man his height should be, which suggested he'd been starving. Outsiders rarely starved these days. Rather they were fat, slow, big to the point that hunting them down came easy.
He would drown, he realized now. Strangely accepting of his fate, he stopped fighting the stream, instead allowing it to take him below the surface. At least if he died like this, his body had a chance of being discovered and not end up as some fucked up steak tartare for a bunch of sadistic, inbred degenerates. It might not be much, but having a body to bury would at least offer some sense of closure for Harry and the few friends he had left. Closure was always preferable to the ever-present limbo of not knowing what had become of a missing loved one. So in a way he'd been lucky.
