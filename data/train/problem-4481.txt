“Listen, I...”  Then it hit him.  His mind replayed over and over the words Cass had just said.  Suddenly the world narrowed, becoming only himself and the man who owned his labor contract, standing here in the dark hall.  For a moment, Dean couldn’t move, couldn’t speak, could barely breathe.  Somehow, he found the strength to nod.  “Yeah, ok, sure.  Sorry to disturb you.  I’ll just go back to bed now.  Whatever you want, ok?”
The way he smirked at that made me groan again. “Perfect.  But let me guess.  We have to delay our announcement even longer?”
“I’ll protect you, Dean,” Castiel vowed.  “I’ll make Project Samandriel work, and if anything...  If anything goes wrong?”
Dean dared not look at Ellen, but he could sense her stiffening.  “I’m sorry, Mistress,” she said quietly.
Once again, Castiel wondered what he’d been thinking to ever leave Dean behind.  He smiled.  “Alright.  Back to the grindstone it is.”
Ketch didn’t respond.  Meanwhile, Dean was practically bouncing in his seat.  “Where are you, Sammy?” he asked.  “I want to see you.”
All it took was an oddly-worded notice in the personals section of a few newspapers.  They had their answer a couple days later.  Cass and Dean had been lying low in another no-tell motel, eating fast food from the Gas-N-Sip and wearing clothes hastily acquired from St. Vincent DePaul.  Cass’s phone, a burner he’d acquired for the occasion, rang four times with people he’d simply hung up on before Rufus Turner finally called.
“It’s my fault for resisting, but I can’t help it!”  It was never easy to see Michael like this.  Castiel was used to the strong, confident image the Angel presented to the world.  But so soon after an overload, his emotions were still fragile.  Now he was clinging to Lucifer’s hand, his dark skin flushed and his eyes pleading.  “My mind falls apart, Luc, and all I want is you!  If they’d only let you in, let you be with me?  I’d never fight control!”
“Dean, as Sam’s guardian, I can start setting things up for him and already have,” Lucifer said, his voice strained.  “But you’re a legal adult.  I can’t check you into your school or do much of anything at all for you until you sign these papers naming me your legal guardian and conservator.”
“I don’t either,” Ketch agreed, “but there seems little harm in letting him try.  Alright, Winchester.  Go talk to him.  But mind me, don’t touch him or answer any questions about us or where he is.”
“Let’s see how grateful you are when you really have to start dealing with Naomi on your own,” dad sighed.  “Unless and until your legal guardianships kick in due to one or more of my Angels becoming incapable of making decisions for himself, you’re still just bodyguards. That means Naomi outranks you. She’ll milk that for all it’s worth to try to separate the two of you from the boys.  But she’s still an employee, just like the two of you, and the Angels absolutely out-rank her!  They’ll need reminded of that.”
Blood.  Shrieks of pain.  Broken bones and falling bodies all around.  I could feel myself shutting down, watching as though from a distance as Lucifer and the Winchesters were joined by the security team, making short work of the remaining attackers.  But Castiel had hold of me again, my furious, amazing brother holding my head down protectively against his chest even as he flailed with a fist against a man struggling with Dean.  I clung to Castiel until he shoved me at another familiar golden figure.  Raphael, out in the middle of all this fighting, just as crazy as Castiel and Lucifer and fighting just as hard even as he held me to his side.  But Michael was here too, and so was Gabriel, both standing protectively over us, attacking anyone who came near.  They were all here, all of my brothers, Angel and otherwise, together as one.  And in some small portion of my mind, I dimly realized that I was the only one who wasn’t fighting.
Cass’s head snapped up.  He blinked at the flames that had started licking around in the ruined television, made a small noise of dismay, and raced towards the kitchen.  To Dean’s relief, he quickly abandoned the gun on the kitchen table.  Cass got into the cupboard under the sink, dragged out the fire extinguisher, and turned it on the flames.  A couple sprays of billowing, choking dust later and the fire was out.
Ellen was her usual pleasant self.  “I’ll keep to the dusting and the sweeping for now, but you’re the new handyman,” she told him.  She’d been giving him a bit of a tour of the house, something Dean still hadn’t had.
“Castiel, I went up the steps five minutes after they did, while Crowley was having Ellen sign her release papers, and made sure,” Chuck insisted.  “They were both standing outside the door, laughing and making fun of him.  But they were outside.”
“Well, I don’t know about salvage,” Dean admitted, “but I’m a decent mechanic.  I had to be, to try to keep the pieces of junk my dad drove on the road.”
Outwardly, Dean hoped his face gave no sign of his thoughts.  Cass didn’t seem to think anything was amiss.  The former prisoner of war was sitting on the futon, up against one side.  It seemed obvious he’d hoped Dean would join him.  Cass was apparently oblivious to the fact that the side he’d left open was the same one he’d chained Dean to last night.  No thanks.  Dean had taken the bean bag, pretending not to see the disappointed look that flashed for a moment across his captor’s face.  Now, back aching a bit from the lack of real support, Dean kind of wished he’d sucked it up and taken the offer.
“Because he sent one of his goons out to talk to me,” Dean explained.  “He wants me to sign over Sammy to him.  As if that would ever happen!”
Dean reached for Cass’s hand, weaving their fingers together.  “It’s going to be tough going for a while,” he admitted.  “The best thing for you once you’re out is to stay with me or Sam.”
He existed.  He ate and drank whatever was put in front of him.  He went through the motions of his day, stared at the television screen without seeing it, heard talking around him that he couldn’t comprehend.
Castiel managed to open his eyes.  The drum, he realized, was the sound of his own heartbeat in his ears.  His head was throbbing.  The lights felt like someone was stabbing him directly in the brain.  He moaned again and squeezed his eyes shut.
“You’re angry with me.”  Spots were starting to dance in front of Castiel’s eyes.  “You don’t want me anymore.  That’s why you wanted to stay with Rufus, why you fought me.”
After that, the talk turned to boring numbers of supplies and materials that Cass would be shipping to the new site.  Dean felt sorry for Cass.  Just listening to the numbers was making Dean’s head hurt.  Cass deserved every penny he made for having to deal with this crap.
Dad moved to the center of the room, holding up his glass.  We all held up our glasses with him.  “To the Angels of Heaven’s Angels,” he announced.  “May this company bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to the whole world!”
That was crazy.  Castiel was self-aware enough to realize that he was falling in love with Dean, that losing his bodyguard now would tear him apart almost as much as losing one of his brothers.  But Project Samandriel would place so much responsibility on whoever was given the primary wristband!  What could a mere bodyguard do?  How could he possibly justify saving Dean, putting that responsibility onto the beautiful man who haunted his dreams, and expect him to do the work of an Angel?
Pained blue eyes met his own.  “Dean, if something happened to you?  I don’t know that I could handle it.”
The angel had already discovered that for himself.  He’d done a complete circle of the narrow space where he’d been confined, confirmed that there was no exit, and now stood glaring at the candidate.  He couldn’t remember the last time he was so humiliated and furious with a simple human.
“Which means Naomi recreated what you discovered in Luc to get you all addicted to the jacks,” Sammy said.  He was clinging tightly to Gabriel’s hand.  “That’s how she got you back on the jacks without Samandriel!  And she used that new diagnostic jack to give Gabe that loop!”
Ellen nodded.  “That he was.  She told me what he was doing, showed me the marks where he held her.  And she cried.  Oh, how she cried!  So I held her tight and told her mommy would take care of everything.  Then I packed her bags and sent her to her friend’s for the weekend.  And when Jeff came home, I was waiting for him.  With a loaded shotgun and a box of shells.  I emptied that entire box into that piece of shit, Sam.  Every single shell.  By the time the police came, there was nothing left of his face.  They had to identify him by his fingerprints and DNA.”
“Some bastard called Lucifer Nicholas has him and wants to adopt him,” Dean growled.  “He’s connected somehow with Rooney.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Dick soothed.  “Harper knows the debt he owes to society.  He’s been serving for two years now, and he’s the happiest executive laborer I’ve ever seen.  Cheerful, efficient, obedient, and ready to serve in any capacity asked.”
Cass didn’t answer right away.  His hands gripped the wheel tightly.  His mouth was set in a grim line.  “Just find the cuffs.”
“Hael!”  Naomi’s voice was enough to halt Hael, but she didn’t look at the copper angel.  Her eyes were locked with Castiel’s.  She reached out a hand towards him.  “Come home, Castiel.  There’s nothing for you here.”
That stung a bit.  It was hardly the first time Dean had been called dumb.  He’d thought that about himself.  But being compared to a monkey was pushing it.  “I said I was sorry,” he repeated.  “You don’t have to be a dick.”
I’ll see if they can’t give you anything good before we leave, since you’ve still got that IV in you.”
Wetness, something warm and wet rubbing gently on his skin.  Castiel opened his eyes.  He was sitting in a tub of warm, soapy water.  Dean was here, sleeves rolled back, busy bathing him.  The bodyguard smiled.  “Hey!  There’s those pretty blue eyes!  Haven’t seen them in a while!  It’s nice to see you alert and oriented again!”
“Because of the size of the bounty on Dean’s head,” Dick explained cheerfully.  “As I said, that explosion damaged a lot of valuable property.  But it also killed two guards.  I’m of the opinion that the guards were an accident.  The bodies were found behind the building, with drug paraphernalia.  I believe they went back to get high while on duty.  Dean’s group approached, believed the building was unoccupied, and blew it up.  But I’m afraid the law doesn’t see it that way.”  Dick shook his head sadly.  “If another bounty hunter finds Dean Winchester, he’ll be in one of your sister’s labor camps within days of his arrest.  But I don’t believe he deserves that.  I believe that Dean Winchester can be rehabilitated.  In fact, I’d be willing to reserve his contract myself.  After all, a family should be together, don’t you think?”
“Which means Dean’s got some hardcore connections.  And it would have allowed him, assuming he switched DNA profiles when he switched identities, to continue using that identity long term.  But that means Sam had to have known.  He would have had to have been signing his brother’s name for years!  That means proving it is a simple matter of tracing known signatures and finding out when, exactly, the handwriting changed.  However, if Sam knows about the switch?  Then chances are very high he’ll be monitoring for anyone sniffing around.  The last thing in the world he would want is to get saddled with the criminal past Dean slapped onto his good name, right?  So honestly, it’s in his best interests to keep his mouth shut.  And he’d be damned vigilant about making sure no one tried to take the good ‘Dean’ identity, because if that happened?”
Cass continued to fiddle with the new television set.  His forehead wrinkled as he attempted to puzzle out the instructions.  Dean, he mostly ignored.
“You have your assignment.  Now go meet him.  And be careful.  He doesn’t do well with changes in his personnel and is likely to act out.  It’s not unheard of for him to go into a funk, throw a temper tantrum, have panic attacks, or even go completely catatonic. If that happens, call the handlers.”
“There’s smoke coming out of the vents,” Cass reported.  “It’s starting to get a little thick in here.  Can’t you smell it?”
Lucifer swore.  “This is what comes of assigning caregivers instead of a real bodyguard! Why Winchester worked so hard to keep Bartholomew away is beyond me, but look at this!”  Lucifer pointed accusingly at Castiel’s hair.  “It’s snarled here, too!  Hold still, I’ll get it.”
Dean obviously wasn’t happy about that answer, but for once, he didn’t argue.  He raised his hands instead. “Fine.  I’ll go do something human-y while the angels talk about grown-up stuff.”  He turned and headed up the stairs. Somehow, even his footsteps sounded irritated.
“Well, it’s still a good idea,” Dean argued.  “Someone might get wise, figure out you’re the best person to find me, and come by for a chat or something.  And besides, if they start getting murdery ideas, it’s best you’re hidden sooner rather than later.  Hey!”  He slapped at Angel’s hand as it again inched towards the dressing.  “Leave it alone!”
“We don’t know that,” I called quickly, seeing Luc’s stricken expression.  “After all, we have certain advantages here, with
“Nothing.”  Dean let himself rest back on the seat, hurting and confused and miserable.  He had no idea what was going on, but apparently, this Ketch douche had no intention of telling him.  Dean knew that, even if he jumped out of the car, he was in no shape to run or fight.  Somehow, he had a feeling that trying it would only piss Ketch off.  His maybe-rescuer had already murdered four men in cold blood and had barely batted an eyelash.  What would he do to Dean if Dean tried to cross him?
tries something?!”  Castiel scoffed.  “I saw the look on his face.  You had him pinned down on your bed and he looked like he would have rather been just about anywhere else.”
“I want Dean with me,” Cass said stubbornly.  “He saved my life.  And if you’ll recall, Evaluator Crowley?  My life is still very much under threat.”  He looked around.  “You may have noticed I don’t have a bodyguard at present?  Dean stays.”
Castiel didn’t say anything.  He held still, letting Michael shave him.  Then, at Michael’s urging, he changed out of his work clothes and into the suit Michael had provided.  “You look very nice,” Michael told him, adjusting his tie.
Castiel thought it over.  Both paths, he knew, had risk.  If he investigated the criminal case, and Gabriel’s people got caught?  Castiel had no reason to think they wouldn’t turn on those who’d hired them.  That would lead investigators to look closer at the Novak family.  Their new identities, he knew, could hold up to a great deal of scrutiny.  Not even a DNA test would reveal the deception.  No computer could link the two families.  No database had been overlooked.  The only easy way that the Novaks could be revealed as the Shurleys now would be a human one, identification by someone who had known the Shurleys.  Someone who could perhaps produce information, such as photos kept in personal storage and not in any cloud-based databank, that couldn’t be reached easily.
Dean’s door was wrenched open.  He turned and saw Azazel.  The man was smiling, pointing a pistol at Dean.  “Unless you want to get shot too?” the detective called.  “I suggest you come on out of there.”
“We’ve been trying to avoid that,” Rufus warned.  “Taking Castiel underground?  You know why that’s always been our last resort.”
Cass’s answer was to throw back the covers and wriggle out of his sleeping shorts.  “I certainly hope so!”
Sam quickly turned around.  “I think it’s best that you stay away from my brother for a while.  Let him get his head straightened out and decide what he really wants.”
“He’s still an angel!” Bobby yelled.  “He’s probably calling down a shitload of friends right now.  What the hell are you thinking?”
Lucifer’s voice was an insane shriek.  The blade moved, slicing into Castiel’s neck.  How close was it to the jugular?  Already, blood was pouring from his jagged wound, soaking the collar of his shirt.  His arm throbbed from the pressure of Lucifer’s fingers digging into his flesh with his enhanced strength.  But more than the physical pain, the horror, the grief of losing Samandriel was driving into Castiel once more.  “I killed him,” he said numbly.  “I murdered Samandriel.  I did it, it was me!”
“Well, when I left him, it didn’t seem likely he’d ever show much interest in anyone ever again,” Dean declared.
“There’s three men,” Cass called, his attention still fixed down the hall as he switched to another weapon.  “They’re our back-up.  By now, they’ve figured out something’s wrong and should be coming in.  I need you to watch the windows.”
I remember the way her eyes widened, her jaw dropped.  The way her eyes moved amoung our faces, seeing nothing but sorrow and regret.  And finally the tears that welled in them as she realized, too late, that the son she favored could no longer stand to face her, and the sons she’d neglected would have done anything to protect her.  It was only a couple of months ago that Samandriel had finally gone to visit his mother in prison.  But all of the rest of us had been visiting her every week since she’d been arrested.
Bobby cleared his throat. “We, meaning Rufus and me, have every intention of protecting Castiel.  You, on the other hand, need to get the hell out of this mess.”
Dick frowned.  “Is your remote not working, Castiel?”  He produced a remote and, before Cass could protest, pressed a button.
Castiel spread his hands.  “I need to know if you’re going to experience any sort of medical issue.  You don’t have any track marks in your arms, but there are plenty of drugs that don’t require...”
Dean pounded a fist on the desk.  “Where is he?” he repeated.  “He needs his real family, not some strangers, and I want to see him.  Where is my brother?!”
“Yes,” Castiel whispered back.  “The atmosphere should be very casual when the executives aren’t there.  You can act fairly normal, within reason, of course.  Just remember the rules if an executive is there.  Executives tend to come in at the last minute, so you’ll probably be the only one here for a while.  Be polite.  As a new laborer, you’ll be expected to have questions.  Just, well, don’t expect the nicest conversations.”
Neither got much sleep.  That morning, Dean dragged out the bodies, leaving them in a pile in plain view right outside the porch.  Who cared who saw it now.  Next, he raided the kitchen, creating a huge breakfast with lots of fruit.  It still amazed him that the Novaks had access to fruit.  It wasn’t the tiny, misshapen stuff available for high price in regular grocery stores, either.  The Novaks had fresh orange juice, big ripe apples, even nectarines.  Sam would have fainted at the sight of it all.
“Yeah, well, she’s the bitch that took my little brother away.  And I’m here to tell you, she did take him away.  And Lucifer absolutely has him.  I saw him, Angel, with my own eyes.”
Dean clearly sensed the tension.  The green eyes rarely left Castiel’s face, even as the human constantly fidgeted and paced around.  When he saw Castiel straighten as word traveled through angel radio, Dean froze.  “It’s over,” Castiel told him.  “They’ve rescued Samandriel.  Just a matter of time now.”
“Millions, easy!” Barney predicted.  He waved his arm, now in a cast, back at me.  “I’ll have more than enough to make up for this after I sell your robot ass, Winchester!”
“Come with us, Dean!” Sammy urged, suddenly excited.  “Luc can help us.  We’ll have a big house with a pool and plenty to eat.  You won’t have to steal or...”  He swallowed hard.  “You’d be safe, Dean.  You wouldn’t have to fight to take care of us.”
Dean’s voice.  Dean had somehow managed to wedge his six-one frame into the tiny dumbwaiter, the only way in or out of this room that wasn’t covered by a security barrier. Now he was struggling to get out. His eyes were fixed on Lucifer. “It was me, you red-eyed bastard! I’m the one who took Gabriel!  And if you ever want to see him alive, you’ll take your fucking hands off of Castiel!”
Castiel rounded a corner and stopped.  Ahead of him, he saw a tall man with shaggy brown hair.  The man wore a pristine white suit complete with polished white shoes.  The man’s back was to Castiel, hands clasped behind his back as though he hadn’t a care in the world.  His head was tilted back.  He appeared to be stargazing.  Castiel stayed where he was, knowing that Lucifer was aware of his presence.  He knew the archangel would acknowledge him in his own time.
“He had every reason to do so!” Dean yelled, throwing up his hands.  “He fucking killed someone else, trying to shoot me!”
“I’m not sure,” Castiel mumbled.  “It’s a mystery.  At first, I’ll admit it disturbed me.  I’ve never felt myself so drawn to a human before.”
Much to Dean’s relief, Cass climbed off of him and hauled him to his feet by his arms.  While that certainly hadn’t felt good, it was still better than what he’d feared Cass was about to do to him.
That was crazy.  It was the middle of the night.  What would Dean think of him if he just knocked on the door connecting their rooms, went inside, and actually discussed things?
“Yes, but then he’ll just be staying out with the car.  These are more for a laborer you’re planning on using as a personal attendant.”
“After we go in!  Come on, Dean, don’t be a jerk!”  Already, the eleven-year-old was trying to twist his hand free from Dean’s.
He shivered, blushed as prettily as any girl, and leaned for a moment into my hand.  Then he ducked his head, going back to his work.
Good advice.  Dean headed into the kitchen, determined not to give into his weird fucked-up urges again.  Cass had enough trouble.  The last thing he needed was to be pestered by a teenaged idiot with a crush.
But Cas was just too scared to listen.  By the time we got back, he was completely freaked.  He was flailing at me, crying out for help again and again, kicking and squirming so much I nearly dropped him.  But at least he was back at the cabin.  I dragged him inside and kicked the door closed.  I’d lock it later.  Right now, the most important thing was for me to get control of Cas before he ended up hurting himself.  The way he was struggling now, hurting himself was a real possibility.  I was worried Cas would go back into another funk, like he’d been in when I’d been assigned as his bodyguard.  Or worse, go completely catatonic like he’d done the first time I’d taken him out here.  Cas was spooked for sure.  But why wouldn’t he be?  For some reason, Cas didn’t seem to remember anything about being at the cabin or what had happened there.  Those precious days that had come to mean everything to me had somehow been completely wiped from the Angel’s memory.  But Cas absolutely remembered the roof of the Heaven building, and my desperate gamble to free him.  No, that’s not right, I realized.  Cas doesn’t understand that I was trying to free him.  He doesn’t understand why I had to hold him like that.  Even though I repeated the words he’d said to me to try to trigger his memories, he didn’t remember ever saying them!  And he still doesn’t!  Now he’s here, trapped by the guy he thinks just tried to commit a murder/suicide off the building with him, and he has no idea why.  No wonder he’s freaked!
Gabriel Novak, Dean grudgingly admitted, was a hell of a director.  While the group had managed to veto the idea of a musical score, the footage he’d acquired told a story all on its own.  Now they were broadcasting it via the satellite link-up in the abandoned labor camp.  Dean sat with Cass, watching on the main screen in the overseer’s building as Gabe’s video played dome-wide over the hacked Roman Enterprises network.  He watched as Chuck Novak himself explained the truth behind the Convicted Laborer Program, how so many were drawn into it as a source of income, rather than because of any crime committed.  He’d recorded that part in their last hideout, just before they’d made their attack on the tunnels.  Then came the footage of their journey into the tunnels, and the fight.  The video got choppy just after Castiel was hit, Gabe fighting to try to reach his brother and ignoring the camera for a time.  But then it picked up again with the dramatic rescue and drive to freedom.
“What I should have done a long time ago,” Chuck said grimly.  “The only reason I haven’t done it before now is that I need to be on site to access the mainframes, and there’s no way I’d be able to get into it without giving myself away, putting my family at risk.  But now?”  He glanced at Castiel.  “Now, my family’s already at risk.  Castiel, your brothers and sister are at a safehouse the company has no idea I own because I purchased it under a fake identity.  It's in another section.  You’ll follow them, along with everyone here and anyone else that you feel needs to be taken to safety.”
Dean forced himself to smile, even as the message hit home, loud and clear.  The private vessel that had ferried him to the island had contained several silent, hard men.  Dean hadn’t missed the weapons they carried in holsters at their sides.  He had no doubt they were Lucifer’s men.  Neither he nor Sammy would be going anywhere without someone knowing it.  Despite the wide expanse of beach beyond the dock, Dean suddenly felt claustrophobic.
Castiel kissed him again.  Dean was so pliant, kissing Castiel in return.  He was still and quiet when Castiel pulled back, looking up at him.    “Cass?”
All I need to know is your medical history, as much as you want to tell me, so that I can treat you.”
“He’s not dead,” Rooney repeated.  “Neither is Michael Abel.  Michael survived, crawled back into the house, and took a shot at Lucifer.  It distracted him enough for Novak to move in and take Lucifer down.”
Sam ignored him.  “The people I bring in deserve punishment,” he declared.  “But even they don’t deserve to be trapped in a broken system.”
“Does being in a gang mean you lose your minds?” Dean ask.  “Too many drugs fry your brain cells?  Or is this just some sort of ink poisoning from all those stupid tattoos?  Because you’re an idiot if you think I’m going to do that!”
Dean was too panic-stricken to care about the leer in the other man’s tone.  “I swear on my brother’s life, I don’t know where Cass is.  Please, you can’t hurt him, you can’t, he’s only fourteen, leave him alone, don’t hurt Sammy, don’t, please, don’t!”
Dean’s cheeks darkened in anger, and his jaw set. But he went quiet.  Naomi was right, of course.  As Castiel’s bodyguard, while Dean was occasionally present for meetings of high-level staff, his contract stated that he was there only in his capacity as bodyguard and was required to keep quiet and maintain confidentiality.
Dean didn’t miss the catch in Cass’s voice.  “It’s not personal,” he soothed.  “I really like you, Cass.  Maybe... Maybe even more than I’m ready to admit right now.  But my brother?  How would you feel, if it was Gabe?”
“There are ways to override the hard limit,” Naomi admitted.  “But this is only done in the most dire of circumstance, when stopping work represents an unacceptable and clear danger.”
“I don’t belong to you,” Dean snarled.  “You bought my contract, and you get to shock me while you own it.  But you don’t own me!”
“Oh?”  Dean peered over the back of the seat, smiled and reached for the box.  “Ooo, fireproof safe, nice!”  He opened it, and his smile faded.  Dean looked up at Castiel with narrowed eyes.
I bolted towards the private garage and grabbed one set of keys.  I already knew which car I wanted.  The first time I’d laid eyes on the ancient beauty, I’d fallen in love.  The fact that she’d been on the losing end of an argument with a semi didn’t make a bit of difference.  She’d been the first thing I’d repaired when Bobby had sent me out here to work on the two “junkers” while he’d worked with Cas.  And in my spare time, I’d continued to work on her, replacing the windows, repairing or replacing the interior and the dented, rusted panels, repainting, polishing, and buffing until she shone.  Now the 1967 Impala’s engine purred as I got her on the road.  I’d already approached the subject of buying her with Bobby, who had smiled through his beard and said we’d work something out. Now my Baby – so what if I already thought of her as mine? – was eating up the road as I searched for my angel. I had no idea what to do.  Cas and I had gotten cell phones, but in less than a day he’d already torn his apart and integrated it into whatever he was building. If he was lost, hurt, or taken he had no way to call for help.  I had to find him!
Dean groaned and released his brother.  “Yes, he made me an executive laborer, but trust me, nothing happened, ok?”  He hesitated.  “Listen, Cass is...”
That only made it funnier.  Dean laughed, gave him a cup, and laughed again when Castiel took a drink and his eyes bulged.  “Now you’re a man!” he announced.
Dean was red-faced and upset, but his voice, and his hands as he removed my brother’s belt, were gentle.  “Did you put this antigrav belt on yourself?  Cas, it’s not even properly fastened!  You could have fallen out of it!  Oh, angel, I should have realized how excited you’d be and paid more attention to you instead of setting up that perimeter with Luc.  No no, shhh, don’t be upset.  This is my fault.  I’m the only one here who knows what you’re like.  I’m sorry.  Come on, let me get you taken care of.”
“Well, Cassie’s got a role to play,” the Trickster explained.  “I can’t have him forced to choose between you and the cause.  So I kind of need to know where things stand between you two.  So tell me.  Do you feel something for him?”
I pinched the bridge of my nose.  “Three things.  First, and I am really tired of having this discussion with you, the fact that I am my father’s biological son does not mean that my brothers are in any way lessened.  I was born his son, but they were chosen and adopted.  In his eyes, as well as the eyes of the law, dad now has six heirs who should all share equally in his company, and that is precisely what is happening.  Second,” I called loudly before she could interrupt and protest, “Michael was literally built to lead us.  And third, I don’t want it!”
When I first heard the noise, my initial instinct was to push Castiel behind myself and reach for my weapon.  Then I forced my hand away from it.  No.  The last thing I wanted to do was draw attention to myself.  I crowded Cas off the road, my eyes on the odd mechanical device coming closer.
They were still tangled together, their faces inches apart.  But now Cass was pulling away.  No.  Dean held tight to him.  “Wait!”
Castiel took the tube and looked at it.  Personal lubricant?  Ah!  Dean was very clever.  The substance was well designed and worked far better than saliva.  Before long, Dean was open and ready for him.  Castiel looked at Dean, saw him nod, and then gently entered him.
Dean was already getting out, smiling as Castiel rounded the car.  “You won’t regret this,” he promised.
A man’s face floated above the table.  It was a handsome face, symmetrical and masculine, although it wouldn’t be a stretch to call it pretty.  Green eyes with a hint of a smile, a slight quirk to the lips that said “I know something you don’t know.”  But then again, Dean always looked like that.  He always seemed to be somehow amused by some private joke only he got.  And this time, the joke was on them.
Castiel brightened.  “You liked it?  Does that mean I can have you again?  Because next time, I want to try it with you on your hands and knees, and...”
“It would use up too much data, and probably cost us clients,” I told him. “Gabriel, is the loincloth really necessary?”
“Right now, nothing.  Because he also told me who you are to him, and why you bought his contract.”  Sam looked hard at the other man.  “Is it true?”
“Ellen, Dean,” Cass sighed.  “I have no doubt she was threatening Ellen.  I’m sorry you misunderstood and let yourself be put through that over a misunderstanding.”
“Actually, you were hurting me,” Castiel mumbled, staring at the table.  “That’s the problem!  Dean was upset because he saw what happened before.  And he attacked you because I was yelling at you to let me go, that you were hurting me.  You just weren’t listening, as usual.”
The smile was gone.  Angelo looked troubled now.  “Be that as it may,” he began, “your friend was programmed to murder a United States Senator and potential President.  That’s not something we can ignore.  We also can’t ignore the fact that you clearly helped him get you out of the Senator’s mansion.”
“Do you think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around?” Castiel asked.  “Do you think I should be at your beck and call while you do whatever you choose to do?  There’s a bigger picture here, and you are only one small part of it.  You should show me some respect. I took you away before you could be dragged down to Hell.  I can just as easily throw you in.”
“Well, the thing about them is, they’re all, um...”  Charlie swallowed.  “They’re all super hot, ok?  Like, smoking hot?”
“But you should have the deciding vote!” my mother insisted.  “Michael’s perfectly suited for the day-to-day running of the company, but you have four doctorates...”
The green eyes shifted rapidly for a moment before settling on the angel.  The lips curled into a scowl.  “Whatever, just tell the story.”
“Happy to.”  Nothing about it being his job.  Nothing about no one else being willing to do it.  Dean said that as if he really was happy to care for Castiel. And now he was rising, preparing to step out and give Castiel privacy.
Dean climbed into the sofa next to him, sitting sideways.  He pushed Castiel forward a bit, sliding one leg behind him against the back of the sofa. Then he was pulling on Castiel, dragging him down to lie against Dean’s chest.  The afghan over the back of the sofa was pulled down, wrapped snugly around them both.  Dean slipped his arms around Castiel, holding him tightly against his chest.  “How’s that?”
Dean looked like he had something more to say, but he remained silent.  Castiel shrugged and continued.  “As I said, I plan to take you to the executive level.  They’re expecting you, of course.  I will still have to check you in when we arrive, so that you can pass through the doors to run any errands I send you on.”
Dean wasn’t sorry.  Harper had just stuck a finger in his mouth and then quickly dipped it into Dean’s pasta. Dean stabbed it with his fork.  Harper withdrew the hand, but not before it snatched Dean’s drink.  Dean seethed as Harper took a mouthful of Dean’s drink, spit it quietly back into the cup, and gave the cup back.  Dean could only eye Harper’s drink, safely out of his reach.
Gabe spread his hands.  “You have no reason to believe me, I get that.  But I’m telling you, I didn’t know the dome was poisoning people.  The party line I was fed was that, while the land was viable, it would take time before it was ready to support the population of the dome.  So we needed to keep the truth under wraps, to avoid a stampede of people looking for land, going out into a wilderness that couldn’t keep them alive.  I didn’t even know how much good land there actually was out there.  I still don’t.  Naomi filled us in a bit more on that, and I’ll pass it along...”
Interesting.  Dean was using words like he was angry, but he was anything but.  Castiel decided he’d made the right choice by relying more on instinct than what he’d gleaned from the porn.  The majority of his brain was a computer, but apparently, there was still enough left of his physical brain that his instincts were letting him please his lover.  He rolled his hips, triggering that spot inside Dean again, and Dean went to pieces. But Castiel was coming apart, too, heat building up deep down, causing him to cry out and thrust deeper into Dean. He reached down, took Dean in hand. And before long, something hot was running over his hand, just as he felt himself release inside of Dean.
The void was in chaos.  All around, the individual souls circled the confused reapers while above them, angel fought angel near Heaven’s gates.  The very structure of Heaven itself was being tested, but Castiel knew his forces would win.  They had to.  There was no other choice.
Cass was moving closer, raising up a hand to cup Dean’s cheek.  “Dean?” he began.  “I’m not angry anymore.  Whatever your reasons were for doing this, they’re your reasons.  Tell me if you want, or don’t tell me, it’s your call. But I would never threaten Sam, or anyone else.  I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I do,” Castiel insisted, “because if you don’t, I’ll have to leave you cuffed to something the whole time you’re here.  Not only will that be extremely uncomfortable, but very soon, the metal is going to wear through your skin.”  He held up the cuffs.  “I’m sorry about the leopard print.  It was all they had available at the time that suited my needs.  But if you’ll put these on your legs?  I can take off the handcuffs and let you move around.”
Sure enough, the Winchesters soon came in, poured their own cups of tea, and quietly sat with us.  I gave them a smile.  “Work everything out?”
“Angels,” the Trickster said, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling.  “They like to hear me say their names.”  He gave Dean a wink and then looked back at Cass.  “Think you can give me a few minutes to talk with Dean?  I imagine he’s got questions.”
“Yeah, lady, I brought a whole wardrobe.  Of course I don’t have any other clothes!  This is a prison uniform!”
“No, Cassie,” Gabriel murmured.  The other Angel had hold of Castiel’s arm, was holding him in his chair as he started to rise.  “Stay here with us.”
“Oh, you have got to be shitting me!”  I looked up, saw a group of idiots with stockings over their heads and pistols in their hands waiting for us at our vehicles.  “Seriously, Barney?  You didn’t learn from me beating the shit out of Lenny, and you seriously want to try this shit right now?!”
“That...  You...  Cass, you were camped right outside my door!” Dean sputtered, flabbergasted.  “We’re in some super-secret underground bunker.  That door looked like it could take a nuclear blast.  I have no idea how I would even open it.  Nothing could get in here without dynamite and a backhoe, but you were seriously still afraid that while you slept, someone would somehow get in and drag me off unless you chained me to this bed?!”
Sam shivered.  “No, Bobby.  I’m pretty far from it.  But I’m good enough to finally think clearly.”  He glared at the older man.  “How could you let him do it?  How could you let my brother take my place, become a convicted laborer?”
“No.”  Dick dabbed at his nose.  “You will give me Sam Winchester, one way or another.  But like I said, I’m a fair man.  I’ll take you first tonight.  You can experience exactly what I will do to Castiel.  And then you’ll watch it happen.  You’ll make your decision then, won’t you?  Your lover, who has bravely been here, at your side, begging for mercy for you and taking everything I can give out for your sake?  Or your brother, who has yet to show his face, yet to contact us to ask for your release, yet to indicate even once that he cares at all for the brother who has been taking the fall for him all this time?  The choice is yours.”
I snorted.  “You don’t have to worry about that, Dean.  He would never leave Castiel in the shape he’s in right now!  I have no doubt he’s already postponed his travel plans.  He and Naomi were pretty far out, dealing with lawyers and setting things up for the Angels to take over, but they should be here any minute.”
Angel was reaching down, picking up his trench coat.  “The only thing I can.”  He tossed the coat over Dean’s face.  “Use that to protect your eyes, and keep them closed tight!”
“It’s a mess, Naomi, just like it always is!” Cass snapped.  “If you could be bothered to take a look, you’d see that.”
Finished unloading groceries, Cass looked over at Dean.  “Sit down,” he offered.  “Make yourself comfortable and I’ll turn the TV on for you.”
“So we can torture him for information instead,” Dean said dully.  “Tell me, what the hell’s the difference between us and the demons if we do that?”
“Sammy is correct,” Dad confirmed.  “But until they contract, Heaven’s Angels cannot interfere.  And if these atrocities are really happening now, they won’t contract until they’ve crushed the rebellion.  And meanwhile, the people are suffering.  That’s why I’m going there.  I’ll do what I can on my own, try to either expose any atrocities so that those responsible can be brought to justice, or negotiate a peaceful surrender.”
Dean didn’t know what to say to that.  Fortunately, he didn’t have to.  The entire procession had started moving.
“Winchester.  Staff Sergeant Dean Winchester, United States Army Special Forces.  And I’m not a robot, ok?!  There’s an explanation for...”
Of course, that raised another question.  “How did it happen?” he asked, looking between Uriel and Balthazar. “How did Michael get Dean?”
“Alright.  So I was trying to clean up the mess, and Dean came over and tried to help, mopping up chocolate with his shirt...”
“Sam, you are in no shape to do much of anything yet!” Bobby protested.  “You just chucked a bottle at an imaginary Devil.  You really think you can help your brother while you go all Fight Club in the middle of Rich Central?”
Nicholas gave him the finger.  “Medications, at least.  If he’s bad enough, long-term hospitalization or group home treatment.”
Azazel was cursing.  His fingers dug into Dean’s arm, dragging him to his feet.  “See what you’ve made me do?!” Azazel was raging.  “Just look at this shit!  Dammit!  I should have done this in the first place!”
“At least Samandriel wasn’t so eager to get silver that he didn’t check all the protocols were in order before she handed an unauthorized vessel to Lucifer,” Uriel reminded.
I could practically hear his scowl.  “It’s not what you want to hear, buddy, and I’d prefer to keep this good relationship between the two of us going.”
Silence from behind the door.  Then it opened again and Dean got a face full of clothing.  “Go back to the garage and change.”
“No they’re not!  Angeli Quinque provides leadership in all of those areas, but the member clients have to agree and sign off on anything we do.”
“Since you restored my name, my powers have been returning,” Samandriel reminded.  “I no longer require sustenance, Dean.”  He managed a small, painful smile as Dean grimaced.  “Thank you for offering, though.  It was kind of you to think of me like that.”
“No, Dean, we can’t.”  Cass rubbed at his face with a hand.  “When I was discharged from the hospital, it was with the expectation that I was going home to my wife, to a safe, stable, secure environment where I could finish my recovery.  But instead, I’ve got no stability to speak of.  I’m on the run.  I don’t know who to trust, and to be perfectly honest?  I’m terrified.”
“I don’t give a shit who or what he is!  He was hurting you!  My job is to protect you, alright?  And I failed you tonight!  I fucking failed you, Cas!  But never again.”
Dean paid little attention to Rooney’s speech.  They’d gone over everything during a computer conference with Crowley the night before.  Dean had been able to discuss things more or less in private, although he had no doubt that someone somewhere was listening.  But the lawyer had assured him that, from a legal standpoint, what Rooney had in mind should go far towards clearing Castiel’s name for the assassination attempt.  Crowley was also confident that the phone call Rooney made with the infamous Bart the Fart would result in charges against Dean being dropped.  Bobby’s estate would get his beloved salvage yard, assuming he had any heirs.
Nosering cocked an eyebrow.  “You know, you’re right.  You probably would make it as a male escort.  But that’s not what I meant either.  Word is, you’re a fighter, Winchester.  You got into this mess in the first place because you worked over our guy we sent to get the money from your boss.  Tooled him up pretty good, from what we could see.  That’s a talent we can use.”
Gabriel considered the question.  “Some sort of threat against one of us, maybe, because you are the lead bodyguard.  That’s about the only thing I could really think of.  Cas?”
The scarred arm was the focus of the woman to Bobby’s left.  Like everyone at the table, Ellen Harvelle looked like someone who had survived a war.  She had the same battle-hardened look about her that they all had, making her tough, defensive, and easily offended.  Now she was glaring down at the mass of scars on Cole’s right arm as he sat with his hands folded on the table.  “What I don’t get is why you’re here,” she said, finally breaking the silence she’d fallen into from the moment Cole entered the room.  “It’s pretty obvious you’re an angel candidate, although it looks like you tried to change that.  What did you do, try to burn it off?”
He was still asleep when he felt himself falling.  Dean opened his eyes to see the world spinning around outside the windshield.  With a sickening jolt, everything stopped.
Lucifer sent an end table flying, shattering as it smashed into the wall.  He stalked menacingly towards Dean.  “Where is he?!  Where is Gabriel?!”
Luc’s eyes went wide.  “That’s my authorization!  You’ve already got highest clearance?  How...?  Oh, this is to do with that missing time!  That’s why you’re here with Cas, because I assigned you to him?!”
“Watch and learn.”  Rufus took careful aim and expertly arched his shot into the can.  But it bounced off of something already in the can, rolled off the rim, and landed once more on the floor.
Dean felt as though his heart would tear in two.  Cass was right.  Of course he was right, but that didn’t make his terrible choice any easier.  He froze, looking anguished at the man he loved until Rooney took his arm.  “Come on, Dean,” he said quietly.  “It’s time to go.”
“We’ll talk about that later,” Bobby declared.  He exchanged a look with Jody.  Moving to his desk, he retrieved a box of kleenex and handed them to Dean.  “You just sit here for a spell.  I need to have a word with Jody.”
“Hmm?”  Roman appeared surprised by the question.  “I simply asked.  Despite her mistakes of the past, she wants to be an upstanding citizen.  She took a risk, helping us find that bunker.  Naturally, I’ll see to it that she’s rewarded.”
Dean had heard Ketch talking to someone while he was in the bathroom, but couldn’t make out what was being said.  He had no idea if the other person was still in the building.  Ketch had brought Dean to a two-story house that screamed “old money.”  They’d arrived by traveling down a long driveway through sculpted hedges and planted flowerbeds.  No one had been there to greet them.  Instead, Ketch had simply scooped Dean up like a damned fairytale princess and carried him inside.  Other than Ketch and the doctor, who had also disappeared somewhere once she was finished, Dean hadn’t seen a single soul.  Ketch had yet to let Dean walk on his own, ignoring his protests to carry the teen from the door to the bathroom, then to the exam room for the doctor, and finally into this dining room, where a meal had been waiting.  Dean sullenly wondered if he’d been lucky Ketch hadn’t insisted in bathing him, but knew better than to question it.  Ketch had asked him if he’d needed help, Dean had refused, and Ketch had taken up his post outside.  Dean had no intention of pushing things.
“It’s just that I know exactly who that first archangel was,” Dean grumbled.  “The candidate he chose was my brother.”
Paydirt.  The glowing eyes went wide with surprise, and then moved to regard the wristband I was still wearing.  I smiled and nodded.  “Yes, Cas! You showed me that project, made me part of it.  And that’s what brought us here.  It worked, angel!  You said the one problem you couldn’t get past was the equation of time with acceleration, that the process required subjects to reach a velocity of at least 50 miles an hour.  You said that even if I was in a plane crash, it would work, and as long as we were in close physical proximity, we’d both go back together!  That’s why I jumped with you!  I’d already activated the wristband, but to be honest, actually jumping off that building was the scariest damned thing I’ve ever done in my life.”  My smile softened as I looked down at the now-still Angel.  “I did it anyway, I took that literal leap of faith, because I believed in you, Cas.  I trusted you with my life.  Now I need you to trust me.  Will you do that?”
“Alright,” Bobby soothed.  “Just stay calm.  At least we have a month before the bastard comes back for you.”
“Bobby’s fine,” Dean assured.  “He won’t hurt me, I promise.”  Ketch, of course, he couldn’t be sure about, but he couldn’t do much about that now.
“So he’s a laborer for the rest of his life?”  Castiel couldn’t tear his eyes away from Dean.  His hands clenched into fists.
Castiel clenched his fists.  “You know the rules, Naomi.  He’s my executive laborer, and you do NOT have permission to touch him.”
“You won’t have to,” Castiel promised desperately.  “I won’t take you back to the office.  And I already planned to get you away from my family.  I’ll get our own place, somewhere you’ll be safe...”
“Castiel,” Alfie said immediately.  “We’re all feeling the same sort of things here, and we’ve all got the same sort of questions running through our heads.  How could this happen?  Why didn’t I stop it?  Where was I when Castiel was taken away?  How could it have taken so long for us to get to him, and why didn’t we go to him instead of whatever it was we did, no matter how haywire a network might have gone?  Well, brothers, I can at least answer that last.  If those bastards left an Angel in overload running a makeshift network, then people were dying!  You did what you had to do!  It was my job to go to Castiel, and whatever happened after that?  It happened, and I have only myself to blame for it.  The takeaway from this is that we don’t let anyone steal one of us ever again!  And meanwhile, we find it in ourselves to forgive ourselves.  Lucifer, I am sorry to single you out again, but I know who among us feels the most guilt, closely followed by you, Sam Winchester!”
Cas, I noticed, hovered close to Dean.  Even with no blade, I’d seen what a fierce fighter he was.  But he wasn’t fighting now.  He mostly just dodged, and occasionally moved to shield Dean from a flying object.  His eyes were fixed on my brother.
Castiel waited, but Dean didn’t elaborate.  Castiel cleared his throat.  “I’m part of a group of angels who believe that what the archangels are doing is wrong.  We’ve been working in secret, an underground network of angels and their allies, to undermine the system.  Now, I now you probably want to escape, go back to your...”  He grimaced.  “I know you said Ketch isn’t your friend.  But I’m sure you do have friends you’d like to get back to.”
Dean sighed and irritably opened the e-mail.  “If he’s expecting me to come down there on Christmas and file a report on those guards, he’s out of his mind.  I’m not about to...”  His voice trailed off.
He didn’t seem concerned.  “Well, just know that I will treat you respectfully, only take apart what I’m sure I can put back together, and then I have no intention of forcing you to stay, especially if you’re sentient.  Work with me, Dean, and I promise you’ll be safe, and with all your wires intact.  Do you understand?”
Mike, however, wasn’t finished with him.  The eldest Novak boy circled around him.  “You’re kind of useless, aren’t you, Sammy?  I mean, we all know Cassie didn’t buy you for actual work, but it’s not like I want to use you the way he does.”
“Yeah.”  Dean tried hard not to smile.  Cass must have really done a number on the bastard.  It made Dean’s heart swell.  He’d done that for him.  For Dean, Cass had given the sick, corrupt cop what he deserved.
“I have to say, that guy was exceptional today! If he hadn’t figured out a way to get in here, we might have lost Angel Castiel today!”
The box contained all of the hardware associated with creating the boundaries as well as the hub.  It wasn’t light.  The idea of manual labor apparently didn’t sit well with Crowley.  He huffed, muttered something under his breath, and picked up the box.  The weight and bulk of it caused him some difficulty with the door.  His scowl deepened when Cass and Dean made no move to help him.  Crowley managed to get in the door with a bit of effort.  Then he went stomping through the house to install the hub.
“Yeah,” Dean said.  “And I gotta tell you, we’re confused as hell about what we found there.  What’s it mean?  Where did it all come from?”
Dean frowned.  “Cass, these guys have got to have a hotline into Roman Enterprises.  If we try to take them out, they’ll just scream for their boss.  Roman will have those bastards from the bunker on us in no time flat!”
Strength flowed through him.  Soon, his wounds would heal.  The sigils all around him still blocked most of his powers.  He was still strapped into the chair.  But at least he finally wasn’t getting any weaker.
Castiel grimaced.  How could he be so selfish, thinking only of his own pain, when Dean’s was still so raw?  He twisted around to face Dean.  “Dean, your brother is more important, alright?  If you have to choose...”
“Luc!  Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?  Because it was dead!  Ask me if I’m a truck!  No, why do you ask?  Why did the frog cross the road?  Because it was stapled to the chicken!”
“Thank you, mother,” I said politely, kissing her cheek.  “I do love you, you know.  But your plans for me do not coincide with my own.”
“This is no joke!”  Gabriel leaned closer, lowering his voice even more.  “The law says you can’t buy a contract of a present or former relative, spouse, romantic interest, friend, or acquaintance.  You can’t bid on anyone you know.  That’s how they keep people from buying their friends and family back.  If you do it anyway, you could be arrested, possibly even sentenced as a laborer yourself!”
Dean Winchester was still unconscious, wrapped in a blanket.  His face had been uncovered for the phone call, but the blanket had been carefully positioned over the rest of his body.  It had covered Winchester’s hands, securely bound in front of him.  Ketch nodded towards the restraints.  “How, exactly, do you plan to explain that to your young friend?”
“I don’t know.”  Castiel got up.  “You haven’t told me.  Let me get cleaned up and into some dry clothes.  You get settled and drink the rest of your water.  When I come back, I’d be happy to listen.”
“Cass!”  Dean rubbed at Cass’s shoulder.  “Until we know different, let’s operate under the assumption that they didn’t get on the transport.  Where would they go?”
Still, he hadn’t been expecting a five-star hotel room with a mint on his pillow, but a pillow, or even a bed, would have been nice.  This asshole knew he was coming.  Would it have killed him to even throw out a freaking blanket on the floor?  Anything would be better than just letting him wake up on the thin carpet.
That, unfortunately, was a real possibility.  If Novak felt he was out of options, murder-suicide was definitely something to consider.  “We need to get in there,” Ketch said.  “Give me some cover.”
“He’s not another assassin,” Rooney said, his voice firm.  “He’s a teenager, a kid with a broken heart and nowhere to turn.  I’m not leaving him alone, tied down and afraid.  I’m letting him go, Angelo, and I want you to tell the staff to arrange for him to be transferred back to the house.”
Dean turned back around to face the detective.  Azazel smiled at him and continued to speak.  “Novak is wanted for questioning as a person of interest in a case of threats made against a certain well-connected individual.  As chance may have it, it was that same individual who arranged for your brother to be placed with my current employer.”
I smiled.  “I wouldn’t try to talk to her yet, but give her a little time to cool down and then go out of your way to be nice to her.”
“Alright, I know you’re angry,” Castiel called.  “But I’m not going to just let you sit in your room and sulk.  I’m coming in.”
“While you’re here, I’ll keep you comfortable, of course.”  Castiel was becoming increasingly confused the longer his charge failed to respond.  “Any item you wish, I’ll do my best to provide.  You seemed to enjoy cooking?  I can get you any food item.  I can provide multiple forms of entertainment, although I’m afraid I have to restrict your access to the internet or telephone.  You can’t contact anyone on the outside.  It’s simply too dangerous.”
Dean steadied his friend and was about to try moving again when something caught his eye.  Looking up, he saw a familiar set of snaking purple-black clouds.  “No,” he groaned.  “Angel, what do we do?”
Cass gave Dean’s hand a squeeze.  “If you want to stay here, Dean?  Then you stay.  Bobby’s a good man.  I can’t think of a better person to help you.”
“So tell him.  Once Dean’s cleared, he can make the decision for himself about where he wants to go.”  The Senator smiled at Dean.  “I’m sure he wants to see his brother, too.”
Cass didn’t answer.  He’d climbed out of Baby and was walking around behind her, clinging to her as if to keep from collapsing.  In fact, once he’d taken a few steps away, he did exactly that, dropping to his knees on the ground and cradling his head in his hands.
“The dome itself!”  Cass kicked at his chair.  “It’s the dome, Dean.  Don’t you see?  In the inner city, the air is the cleanest because the dome’s effect is the strongest.  But out towards the rims, it’s getting overwhelmed by the double dose of pollution.  For whatever reason, that lessens the effect of it.  And that’s why the bees can survive there.”
“Add the word ‘fatal’ to the list of things to never say with ‘plane crash,’ please.”  Dean shuddered.
“I couldn’t,” Dean confessed.  He’d slumped in his chair, bruised eye forgotten, staring at the bottle in his hands.  “I just couldn’t, Bobby.  I couldn’t face you, knowing what I would become.”  He looked up at Bobby, seeing the hollow expression in his eyes.  “Losing Sammy killed a part of you, just as much as it did to me.  And dad? Whatever you may think of him, in the end, he died trying to correct his mistake.”
I was only partially paying attention.  The bulk of my awareness was fixed on Dean.  I’d noticed immediately how Dean’s shoulders hunched, how the corners of his mouth turned down and his eyes narrowed, and how he’d immediately reached for Castiel, drawing my brother back around the table to sit not in his own chair, but in Dean’s lap.  Now Dean had his arms snugly around Castiel’s waist.  His entire body radiated defensiveness.  “Dean?” I called.  “What is it?”
“Yes!  Because this isn’t right, Lucifer!  I had no right to take away his free will, and I will never, ever let it happen again!”
Ketch didn’t answer.  His eyes, and his thoughts, were fixed on Winchester.  So much didn’t make sense, especially given what he’d found in the bunker.  He couldn’t wait to speak with the teen.
“What?!”  Gabriel gaped at him.  “But Cassie, I...  Er...”  Ellen was glaring at him again.  “S-sure, Ellen, you can borrow mine sometime.”
Azazel raised his hands in surrender.  “I think we got off on the wrong foot.  I’m not your enemy, Dean.”
“Oh, Castiel, I fully intend to!”  Dick crouched down, looking Dean in the eye.  “Maybe that is what it will take to get you to talk to me.  Which one of you should I take to my bed tonight?  Or perhaps I should just take you both? We can take turns again.  You want to watch me take my pleasure from your precious Cass?  Hmm?”  Dick shot Cass a wink.  “I always thought you and I would be great together, Novak.  Maybe we could make your lover watch us while we...”
When the sun came up, he somehow, with a great deal of twisting and freezing every time Dean moved, managed to squirm free from Dean.  Dean immediately frowned, but he didn’t wake up.
Realization hit him like a kick in the chest, knocking the wind out of him.  With John Winchester out of the picture, Sam Winchester was an orphan.  That meant that only Dean could potentially get him out of foster care.  Azazel had come to Dean, wanting him to give up his rights to his brother.  But John had a stronger claim to Sam than Dean did, just by virtue of being his biological father.  Why would anyone come to Dean, unless...
Then the man was roughly kissing him.  The kiss was as hard as it was unwanted.  There was no passion in it, only a rough claim that re-opened Castiel’s split lip.  Castiel could see his own blood on Roman’s lip when the CEO pulled away.  Roman’s tongue licked out, cleaned off the blood.  Castiel’s stomach rolled in disgust.
Silence from behind the door.  Then, so quietly Castiel had to strain to hear, came a near-whispered “Yeah.”
Uriel nodded, allowing himself to be led aside.  “Balthazar, do you have any idea what just happened?” he wondered.  “You knew Castiel.  He was a dreamer, but he was never any sort of threat!  How did he suddenly become so powerful that Naomi is... is...?”
At the word “casualties,” Gabriel whimpered.  Naomi reached over and squeezed his hand.  “Not Cassie,” she assured.  “He’ll be fine.  He would have been locked up somewhere, away from the fighting.”
“I joined the Army right out of school,” Castiel explained as he continued to cook.  “I was your age then.  Felt like I didn’t know a thing about the outside world, and I was correct.  But I worked hard.  I managed to impress someone, because about four months out of basic, I was recruited for a special group.  We were trained and deployed deep into unfriendly territory on missions that generally never showed up on any official records.  Our mission was to find and free hostages.  We were very successful.  We would hit the location, get the hostages out, and get sent off again.”
“Wrong question to ask.  First thing we need to discuss is what you’ll do.  And what you’ll do, Cas, is resist.”  His eyes were serious as he looked at Castiel.  “Remember that wherever they’re taking you will be worse than where you are, so don’t cooperate unless you have no choice.  Do whatever you can to keep them from taking you. You got that big nasty Angel blade, so use it!”
Dean’s heart pounded.  He held tight to Castiel’s hand, waiting.  His eyes were fixed on the door.  All around him, the house was in a shambles.  Blood decorated the wall to Dean’s right.  The source of that was the man slumped against the wall.  The man’s eyes stared straight ahead.  A gaping hole was in his chest.  Naomi Novak, it turned out, was hell with a shotgun.
“Can’t you shut him off or something?” Idiot One wanted to know, climbing back up amid a mixture of swearing and laughter.
Cas smiled.  “You do, sometimes.  And you take wonderful care of me, but when you do, you tend to focus on me and your work suffers.  It’s best that I’m with caretakers.”  He reached up and put a hand over Dean’s.  “Dean is a wonderful bodyguard.  He takes very good care of me, and I’m sure Sammy can help him when he’s not busy with Gabriel!  I just...” His shoulders slumped.  “I’m a burden now.  The only thing I’m really good for is work.”
“What did you find?” Dean wanted to know, picking up his chair and sitting back down.  “I thought I was a dead duck!”
Across the table, the chair Winchester was seated in creaked a little.  He could hear a sharp intake of breath. The angel frowned, looking up to see a pair of wide green eyes.  “This isn’t something I should be explaining to a human.”
Dean shut up.  He followed her, stewing in resentment, as she led the way into the house.  The place was even fancier inside than out.  Dean hoped he’d be working mostly outside.  Along with the added bonus of not having to be around Little Miss Sunshine, he was afraid of what might happen if he breathed too hard and something shattered.
Hearing that said aloud from someone else’s mouth was a bigger shock than anything the collar had given Dean so far.  But Cass wasn’t finished.  “Frankly I don’t care,” he was saying.  “I won’t do this halfway.  If you want to be with me, then I need you to be with me.  And not just when I’m kissing you.”
“Fuck.”  Dean sat quietly, staring out at the road.  “I shouldn’t have told you.  But I didn’t want to lead you on.”
Outside, Dean was looking frantically after him, even as he struggled with the Angeli Quinque security.  Armed, uniformed security guards were racing through the lobby of the Heaven building, shouting.  The alarm sounded, lights flashing to alert of security lockdown.  The driver of Dean’s car had leaned over, reaching out to drag Dean backwards and head-first through the passenger side window, the stabilizers of his vehicle fighting to keep the car upright.  Dean’s feet were sticking out, half of his body still out of the car when the driver stomped on the accelerator and the car launched forward, scattering security guards and pedestrians slow to react.  It was the last thing Castiel saw before the armored metal barriers slammed shut.
“I’ve always hated this life, especially what first bankrolled it.  I’ve been planning to leave for some time.  I just never had the courage.”
Dean carefully pushed the car.  It wasn’t easy.  Fortunately, the driveway was on a bit of a hill.  Once he got it moving, it started to pick up momentum.  Eventually, he was able to jog along next to it as Cass steered down and out into the street.  He coasted for about a block before the car came to a stop.
Bobby returned alone and paused, looking at Dean’s pale face.  He nodded, somber.  “Dean, I’d offer to pay for a funeral for your dad, give him a proper burial,” he began, “but it seems to me that our best option might just be to get out of town.”
“Because this was all for you!” she exclaimed. She caught my head between her hands and fiercely kissed my forehead.  “Samandriel, my sweet, sweet angel, everything your father and I have built here was for you!  From the first day we were told that you’d be born with most of your brain undeveloped, your father swore to me that he would not let you live your life as a vegetable in need of constant care.  He built your computer, we surgically integrated it with your brain with our own hands, we kept up the updates as you grew, and look at you now!  We made you everything you are, both through birth and through technology!  You are the first Angel!  And once he realized your potential, he adopted your brothers and specialized them to form the company.  But it was always, always for you!  Your brothers were designed around you, my darling Samandriel, because you were always intended to be the true leader, not Michael!”
“But why?”  Dean couldn’t bring himself to care about the way his voice cracked.  “Dad was just some drunk!  Why would anyone kill him?”
Castiel turned and did one last sweep of his room, making sure he hadn’t forgotten anything.  Of course, the most important thing was Dean’s letters.  Looking at them always made him smile.  The teen had written to him almost daily at first.  But as time went on, Dean went to school and then on with his life.  The letters went to weekly, then monthly.  In the end, he hadn’t heard from Dean in nearly three months.  It was alright.  While he couldn’t deny it hurt, Dean would be twenty-one by now.  He’d been a busy man.  The last he’d heard, Dean had gotten his degree and was joining Rooney’s business as a bodyguard.  He was looking for an apartment, while Sam was graduating a year early and already out west at Stanford.  The brothers, as he’d expected, had blossomed under good care.  That had been all Castiel could wish for them.  He hoped they were happy.
“Hey, Cassie, you’re preaching to the choir about free will,” Lucifer agreed.  “That’s why I left the first time, and look what happened to me?”
“Can’t happen,” Benny warned.  “Even if they do capture your family, if you turn yourself in, you’ll only get them killed.  Your only real chance is with us.”
“They’re with the Hunter leaders, learning what I’m about to tell you.  And I know you’re not going to believe me.  I know that, alright?!  Even if I brought in what they’re showing Alfie and Gabe right now, you wouldn’t believe me because you’re influenced and Alfie was so busy working on Cas that he never had a chance to fix it!”
“Am I reading this right?” Raphael continued. His hand was scrolling through information being projected in front of him.  “Winchester had just recently returned from a trip to Purgatory?  What was a top-level Angeli Quinque bodyguard doing in that godforsaken place?”
Dean breathed a sigh of relief.  He definitely needed a leash, but at least he’d found the angel before he’d gotten himself into any more trouble.  Siding up to Angel, Dean put a hand on his shoulder.  “You hungry?”
Mikey reached into his pocket.  “On that note, let me give you this.”  He produced a wristwatch and began fastening it to Dean’s wrist.  “It’s got a tracker in it.  It’s also waterproof and shock resistant.  Do not take it off, under any circumstances, because if you do, it will alert me and I will come running.  If the worst happens, and you’re taken, I’ll be able to find you.  You just stay calm, cooperate, and wait for me.  Do not, under any circumstances, resist.  These people will hurt you to force you to do what they want.  Understand?”
“I have a question,” Luc called, raising his hand. His eyes were still bloodshot and damp. “Why the hell did you guys jump off the roof in the first place?  You two weren’t in any danger, so why take the chance?”
He got dressed, pulling on the new suit he’d managed to obtain.  The tie was a problem.  He hadn’t worn one in so long he’d forgotten exactly how to tie it.  He was fairly certain he’d gotten it backwards somehow.  Oh well.  His hair was a mess, too, after sleeping on it wet.  Didn’t matter.  It’s not like he had anyone to impress.
“Yes,” Castiel confessed.  “I’ve been negotiating for some time with another executive, trying to gain ownership of a piece of property.  He’s polite enough, but he doesn’t think too highly of me because of two reasons - I was given my position by my father, and I have never owned an executive laborer.  In the time I have worked there, I’ve managed to prove I have what it takes to hold my position.”
“Well, congratulations!  Now, let me explain a few things.  It’s pretty damned obvious you two aren’t from around here.  I haven’t quite figured you out, but I get the impression you’re in some sort of trouble.  Why isn’t my business.  Now, I like to flatter myself that I have a fairly good instinct for people.  My gut tells me you two need help, and that you’re decent enough sorts that I won’t have to worry about you cracking me over the head and robbing me blind.  That true?”
“I’m just worried about you, boy,” Bobby admitted. “I’m worried about you both!  I know Castiel knows what he’s doing, but every time I see that damned wire sticking out of your sleeve, well, it turns my stomach a little.  The idea that the government will one day hardwire its soldiers right into the war machine, take free will right out of the equation?  That’s a damned nightmare!”
Luc had jerked Dean’s arm brutally up behind his back.  His shoulder protested the treatment mightily.  Before Dean could recover, Luc had dragged him off the back of the car, trapping both of Dean’s arms and turning him to face Mike.  “Time for a lesson in manners, Sam.  Give him hell, Mikey!”
“No one is disputing that!” Michael snapped. “The only reason I didn’t have him escorted from the building is because Castiel insisted it was a misunderstanding and requested probation for him!”
When the door opened, revealing a smiling Barney and a frowning, grey-haired, elderly Asian man, I was ready.  “Help me!” I cried.  “I’ve been kidnapped!  Please, call the police!”
Annoyed, Castiel flew after him again.  Catching the candidate by the wrist, Castiel jerked him to a stop. “Enough,” he ordered.  “Why are you running?  You must know you can’t get away from me.”
The sight of his father in cuffs made Castiel want to throw up all of the coffee he’d just consumed.  He pushed past the guards to embrace Chuck.  “Dad, what are you doing here?” he exclaimed.  “What happened?  Did Lucifer figure something out?  Dad, they think Naomi...”
“You look good,” Dean told him.  “That outfit makes you look a lot younger.  You could pass for a college kid.”
“Dean, if necessary, we will go to court on this, but you’ll be doing that on your own,” Lucifer declared.  “Mr. Crowley has been advised he is no longer your attorney.  As my ward, I will be providing you with a new attorney, one that’s well versed in these matters.”
“Well, I’m sorry!”  Lucifer crossed his arms defensively across his chest and slumped. “Still doesn’t mean it’s ok for him to hit me!”
“That could actually work,” Lucifer grudgingly admitted.  “I’d never put my brother at risk like that, though.  How did you know someone in that bunker wouldn’t hear the news, march right down to Cassie’s cell and put a bullet in his head?”
Dean went out to find Cass pulling a new pair of boots out of a box.  Dean blinked in surprise, and Cass blushed.  “Sorry,” he said.  “It’s just, your sneakers had holes in them, and I was buying you clothes anyway, so it made sense to, you know...”
“But you said Angeli Quinque would have done it for you for free when you started working for them?”
Cass was gone.  Cass had left.  Cass didn’t want him.  He’d told Cass how he’d felt, and Cass had immediately left Dean behind.  What was wrong with him?  Why didn’t Cass want him around?  Dean had thought Cass would want a relationship with him, but obviously he was wrong.  Little wonder.  Why would he?  Dean was no one, just a pathetic loser who...
Chuck was smiling as he signed.  “Big day!” he exclaimed.  “Ellen, I’m going to miss you so much, but I’m glad you’ll finally be free.”
The candidate’s eyes went wide.  He quickly snatched the wallet and looked through it, frowning.  He pulled a card out and stared at it, his expression going from surprise to anger.  “You know, it’s bad enough that I thought you were going to give up the poor sod you’re wearing’s money,” he growled, “but this isn’t even the guy you’re wearing! How did you get this?”
My voice had trailed off.  I knew everyone was staring hard at me, but I couldn’t meet their eyes.  I was kicking myself for not making this connection before. But at the same time, I knew exactly why I’d refused to even consider it until now.
“Yes, and that is very important!  I’ve been negotiating with this country for years. They’ve always wanted you, Cas, as we all know only too well.  But now that they were able to utilize Luc to end their civil war, their restored government is finally taking a real interest in what Angeli Quinque can do for them as a whole.”
“So?” Dean echoed, incredulous.  “Angel, what is the point of living if you’re not happy?  You’ve got all of eternity ahead of you!  Do you really want to spent it miserable?  Ah,” he said, seeing Angel look away again.  “That’s why I don’t want to be Michael’s vessel.  Whatever he might do to you?  If he took me, it would be worse, because he might
The blows stopped.  Dean peered around the legs of his tormentors to see that Dick was getting up.  A cloth was pressed against his streaming nose.  “I will break you, Winchester,” he snarled.  “Do you think the worst I can do is beat, torture, and rape your lover?  I want him alive, but he certainly doesn’t need to be in one fully-functional piece!  I can still enjoy his body if he’s lobotomized, can’t I?”
Cass was paying way too much attention for Dean’s liking.  For days, he’d been nosing around, hanging out or showing up wherever Dean was, even when he had no logical reason to be there.  Today, the guy was sticking his nose into everything.  Dean’s clothing.  “Sam, are you sure that’s what you want to wear?  I thought you were rotating tires today, wouldn’t this be more appropriate?”  What he ate.  “Sam, is that really all you want for breakfast?  You’ve got such a busy day ahead of you.  Are you sure you don’t want some toast?”  How long he worked.  “Sam, you’ve been at this for three hours. You should have taken a break by now.  Come inside and sit down for a bit and have a drink.”  By the time Cass was coming after him with a comb, trying to talk Dean into giving some attention to his hair, Dean had finally had his fill.
Of course he’d ask that.  I tightened my hand on his.  “Let’s just keep walking, alright?  Don’t worry.  I’ll figure something out.”
No answer.  He frowned, checked the address he was given.  Yes, he was in the right place.  He brightened, hearing a sound from the room to his right.  It sounded like a small moan, as if the one making it was in pain but trying not to express it.  He quickly moved towards the room and opened the door.
Dean gamely climbed under the bed and examined Castiel’s work.  Castiel had been carving a series of letters.  “ACTHUMBINDEXPINKYDW,” Dean read.  “Ok, I’ll bite.  What’s this?”
“I didn’t have anything to do with this harebrained scheme,” Bobby defended.  “That was all this idjit here.”
Dean speared the sausage and placed it on his plate, but he didn’t start to eat.  Instead, he stared at it.  “It’s not your fault,” he said at last.
Trust him.  Did he really have a choice?  Dean swallowed and nodded.  “I pick choice C, none of the above.  Hey, did I ever introduce you assholes to my guardian angel?  Meet Castiel, angel of the Lord!  Say hello to my little friend!”
Sam, of course, largely ignored Dean.  Once he and Samandriel had done their speeches as Best Men, Sam’s attention was almost entirely on the organist.  Dean had been surprised to learn that the lovely young woman Chuck had suggested to play for their ceremony was actually deaf.  She used a thin metal rod held in her teeth to feel the vibrations of the instrument.  From the beginning, she’d fascinated Sam.  He’d even studied hard to learn enough sign language to communicate with her, even though she could read lips.  Sam was clearly smitten.
The Chief cleared his throat.  “First, while the general public is told that Angel Castiel is eccentric, the truth is that his condition is far worse.  He’s not actually capable of caring for himself.  He has difficulty focusing on anything outside of his work for any extended period of time, but his programming, his work is something he will focus on exclusively.  What this means is that while he will perform his duties at a high level, he will also neglect the physical care of himself to a potentially harmful degree.”
“Please, just come closer and take my hand before this stupid thing breaks and we both end up in the drink?”
Family.  If Dean needed any proof of the threat to Sammy, this was it.  He met Gabe’s eyes.  “Nothing matters more than family.”
Lucifer and Gabriel both went wide-eyed.  “Cas, you’re really upset about this!” Lucifer exclaimed, moving to embrace Castiel.  “Listen, if it’s that important to you, I’ll raise your limits.”
Sam could remember that.  The heady rush of sensory input, suddenly feeling alive in a way he’d never felt before?  Even now, he could feel the appeal, feel himself longing for...  Sam shook his head.  “Anyway, the Devil is a manifestation of my subconsciousness,” he continued.  “By following him, I was tapping into my own heightened senses.”
Lucifer laughed, patting Sam’s back and moving closer.  Dean did not care at all for the way the man’s hand rested possessively on his brother’s shoulder.  “No need to be so formal, Dean,” Lucifer was saying.  “Please, just call me Luc.  After all, we’re going to be spending a lot of time together.”
Gabriel’s face looked odd.  It was rare that he wore a serious expression.  “Castiel, this is serious.”
“Crowley, as I’m sure you know, has a bit of a flare for the dramatic,” Ketch continued, completely ignoring Dean.  “He had a photo taken of himself with his captive, alive.  I was able to use my contacts to obtain a copy.”
“Yeah, well, the whole picture kind of sucks,” he grumbled.  “Sammy, I don’t know what the hell is going on anymore. But there are three things I do know. The first is that I love you, brother, and there is no way in hell I’m going to let anything happen to you, or to Samandriel.”
Sam opened his mouth to tell the Devil off.  Then he paused, considering.  “You’re a projection of my subconscious mind,” Sam said.  “That means you’re tapped into the areas of my mind I can’t easily access.  That includes my memories.  So, what did I really find at that warehouse?”
Charlie nodded, finally serious.  “We get so many hits on our various boards that it’s impossible to track them all, especially now that I’ve lost most of my team.”  She swallowed hard.  “But someone trying to hack that board certainly got my attention.  I was on it fast, traced it back to the middle of nowhere halfway around the rim.  I’m hoping he tries again so I can narrow it down.”
“Huis is a small African nation, pretty young in the global scale of things.  But they’re located right in the middle of a vital trade route.  For a small nation outside of the Angeli Quinque network, they’re very well developed.  Their leaders are proud.  And although certain members of their government have been trying hard to get to you through various means, they’ve been adamant for years about maintaining their independence.”
I write to music.  The main song I used here was "The Night We Met" by Lord Huron.  Song and lyrics can be found here:
“Speaking of incapacitated?” Charlie called.  “Are you guys willing to listen enough to not freak completely out when I tell you that we really, really need Castiel to jack into Gabriel?  We’ve got a bit of a problem!”
I pushed at her, straining to get up when my body wanted nothing more than to slip back into unconsciousness.  “Let me up! I want to go back to my brothers!”
“Tell me about it,” Dean agreed.  “And I fucked up, Bobby.  Big time.  Now these people know Cass lied about ditching me.  Somehow, someway, that is going to come back to bite us in the ass.”
Castiel quickly dialed and held the device to his ear.  As soon as he heard a voice, he said, “I have him.”
“Actually, yes.  It’s the theory that one single event sets off a cascade that affects all the events after it, right?”
Chuck whirled and saw his youngest son peeking in through the door.  “Gabriel, get in here.  No, go and get your brothers first.  Oh, they’re right there with you, why am I not surprised?”
“We should talk about how Castiel was captured in the first place,” Roman began.  “Based on what we saw on the traffic cameras?  It doesn’t appear that his laborer was part of the abduction.  In fact, he appeared to be struggling, resisting being taken away.  That doesn’t match at all with what we know about Sam Winchester.  However, Dean Winchester, until now, seems to have been reasonably law-abiding.  If the reports we’re getting are accurate, and the man Castiel brought into your home was, in fact, Dean Winchester?  Then obviously, Dean is going to serve time as a laborer for identity theft.  And if that’s the case, I believe I should...”
Rooney came closer, crouched down next to him.  “Dean, I’ll do everything I can to get Sam into a safe place until you can claim him.”
Cass looked down.  “I know your time here so far has been, well, rocky, to put it mildly.  You’ve already been beaten and assaulted, experienced a level three correction...”
Dean felt like his heart was about to explode.  Any moment, something would come out of his mouth that would destroy him.
Castiel was shaking, but he didn’t feel cold.  He felt more like his nerves were somehow hyperactive, sending random impulses that made his muscles twitch and jerk. He didn’t understand it.  But of course, neither did Dean.  Dean only took care of him, just as he’d always done. He brought Castiel over to the sofa in front of the fireplace and wrapped a warm quilt around his shoulders. Then he squatted down in front of Castiel, bright green eyes peering up at him in concern.  “You’re not sick, but you’re still messed up for some reason, Cas. That any better?”
“I don’t care.”  Grabbing Dean by the arm again, Bobby started marching back towards the library.  “That’s the last time you go near that angel, Dean.”
“Alright, that’s enough!” Michael exclaimed. “Castiel, this is not optional. We need this to happen.  They’re not signing without a demonstration, and you are the one they most want to see in action!”  He shook his head.  “Do you know that they actually said that the primary job of the rest of us is to support you?”
Chuck Novak watched the monitor in Dick Roman’s situation room and fretted.  The screen showed a scene of complete chaos.  Smoke was pouring out of the partially-hidden bunker CLaIM was using as a headquarters.  Bullets were flying from all directions.  A particularly loud explosion made him wince.  Roman patted his hand sympathetically.  “I know this must be very hard.  None of you have to be here.”
More than anything, Dean wanted to tell her exactly what was in it for Cass.  But Sam’s words from earlier were still echoing in his head.  “He has his reasons,” he mumbled.
Dean quickly looked down at his plate.  Breakfast.  It was getting cold while he sat here staring at Cass.  No way he’d let good food go to waste, especially not after he’d gone hungry so many times.
“Breakfast?!”  Dean clenched his fists.  “The only thing I am doing is saving my friend.  You can come with me or not, but I’m not about to sit around eating when Angel’s out there being tortured by demons!”
“Hey, you know it!”  Gabriel reached up and pulled the jack out of the port in his plate.  His chair was moving automatically, raising him to a seated position in front of his holographic projectors.  He turned to his visitors, smiling as he winked one glowing eye. “Just another day’s work, right, Cassie?”
Uriel gaped at her.  Hael sputtered.  “We’re going to spy on the Trickster and not go after him, even though you just said he’s a threat?”
Dean remained as he was, listening.  He sucked in his breath when he heard Cass’s car come to life.  Then came the sound of wheels rolling down a dirt road.  Dean kept listening until the sound faded into the distance.  Only then did he let himself breathe.
“Rocks or magical potions won’t be much help,” Cass replied, completely missing Dean’s amazing humor.  “I’m not sure how long it will take until I reach full size.  I hope it’s not more than a couple of days.”
“So, I assume you’re going to kill me anyway,” the driver said.  His voice was maddeningly calm, even as he merged onto a highway with inches to spare between two tractor trailer trucks.  “Death from a bullet or from a car accident, what’s the difference?  Besides, I believe you told me to get us out of here now.”
Balthazar’s face wore a pinched smile as he regarded the pair of demons who had arrived to escort them to Lucifer.  “Meg.”
Maybe that was the key?  Could he pretend Cass was Immanuel?  They had the same color eyes.  Same dark, perpetually-messy hair.  In fact, now that he thought about it?  There were definitely some differences in facial structure, but overall, Cass actually looked a bit like Immanuel.  Small world.
“Michael?” the cashier asked, peering into Dean’s eyes.  “Archangel, can you hear me?  You’ve taken your vessel by now, right?”
For once, Dean didn’t argue.  He let me help him up, still looking incredulously at the group on the floor.  I smiled fondly at them.  Violet, gold, silver, red and white eyes ignored me, still fixed on the wide blue eyes that looked back up at them.  My Angels were beautiful.  And no one, not even the big brother who had basically raised me, was going to threaten them.  I gave Dean a little push.  “Let’s go.”
Lucifer rolled his eyes.  “You know what, Mike?  Why don’t you stick to your sales figures and leave the fighting to real men?”
That was a mistake.  Cas immediately went into another panic, kicking and trying to buck me off.  “No, stop, get off of me!  I don’t love you, Dean, and we were never in a relationship!  We never made love, and I don’t want to!  I don’t want this!  Please, let me up!”
Gabe sucked on his lolly.  “Why not?” he asked, still talking around the sweet.  “You’re a good-looking guy.  You single?”
“Then I guess I’m lucky you make good nanites, right?”  He suddenly looked up, his eyes widening.  “Those nanites, they don’t stay, right?  They’re not, you know, still in me?”
Despite being positive he wouldn’t sleep a wink, the morning sun shining through the window roused Dean.  He blinked his eyes open.  They immediately focused on the figure seated in a chair right next to his bed.
We sat there quietly together as I processed what he’d told me.  Then I shook my head.  “Dean, none of this makes any sense!  It can’t be true!”
Castiel looked at Dean for a moment.  Then he went back on the computer.  “Dad knows how to hide his tracks,” he announced.  “If Lucifer realized something was wrong at the transport, maybe he thought he couldn’t trust CLaIM.”
Dean winced.  “Well, I think I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t move that arm, buddy. It’s awfully damned sore!”
“Dad?” Gabriel asked, incredulous.  “You’re the one who suggested to Cassie that night that he look for a mechanic.  But how did you even know Sam’s contract would come up?”
Cas certainly fit the part of the terrified victim. If anything, he was more freaked now than he’d been before.  He caught at the doorway, clinging frantically.  “No!  No, Dean, I don’t want this!  Please, stop!”
The image rose in his mind.  Dean Winchester, a teenager, looming over him.  The malice, the hatred in his eyes.  He could hear his own voice pleading, begging for mercy.  But Dean had given him none.  He could almost feel the sensation of Dean’s hand pinning both of his wrists above his head.  His body ached from remembered pain, Dean’s fist pounding into him again and again.  If he reached up now, would he still feel the tears he’d cried?  Dean had looked at Castiel without a flicker of recognition.  Did he even remember what he’d done?  Did he have any idea how he’d destroyed Castiel’s self-confidence, his sense of security and self-worth, over the space of a few short moments?  Had Dean ever in his life been forced to feel what he’d made Castiel feel?
Cass’s hand tightened on Dean’s.  Why were they holding hands?  Holy shit, had Dean seriously held onto the guy’s hand when he’d pulled it off of his cheek?  He was still holding Cass’s hand!  Even staring down at it, Dean couldn’t will himself to let go.  It was Cass who finally broke the contact.  “You should get that iced tea cleaned off,” he was advising.  “It will get sticky, otherwise.”
“So no one was there?  My brother was stolen and damaged to the point that he mangled his own arm, and absolutely no one was there to help him?!  He may be an Angel, but he’s still human!  He could have bled out so easily!  We could have
Castiel froze.  Fortunately, Gabriel was there, and this time, he came to his brother’s rescue.  “It’s not exactly an unusual name,” he said, his voice perfectly casual.  “Not like his name’s Jehosephat McGillicuty, right?”
“I’m doing exactly what you are - whatever it takes to protect the people I love.”  He brought Dean’s hand to his lips, kissing the scabbed knuckles.  “Do you remember that escape route I set up for you?”
“How could you take me?!” I accused.  “You know that I need my brothers!  Why the hell would you take me again?!  You promised me that last time would be the last time!”
Michael looked just as worried as Castiel felt.  “Then it’s possible we could be dealing with a Hunter breach!  Why was I not informed?!”
He went quiet again, letting go of my hand and looking down.  I forced myself to put both of my hands on the wheel, ignoring the instinct to crush him to me.  By now, we’d pulled into Singer’s Salvage Yard.  I parked Baby outside of Bobby’s garage.  But neither of us made any move to go inside.
Castiel had said it to be polite, but he hadn’t lied and told her as much.  For some reason, that stopped her whispering.  She still held tight to his arm, but spent the remainder of the walk looking at him, a puzzled expression on her face, as though she wasn’t quite sure what to make of the angel.  He decided it was probably best not to mention it and continued to walk in silence.
“No.  Thank you, but no.”  Dean was scowling, trying to undo the wristband, why was he trying to undo the wristband?  “Ok, how do I get this off?”
“No!”  Dean looked frantically around.  “You said you just need him to come in, right?  So you can use whatever pull you have to get him back into treatment, deprogram him?  I can make it happen!  Just let me talk to him.”
I watched him go, feeling a little ache in my chest.  If I’d needed any more proof that Dean was delusional, the fact that he’d just accused my husband of sending me on a suicide mission was plenty.
Castiel kept his eyes on the CEO, but saw Dean wince from the corner of his eye.  Still, there was little Castiel could do.  His executive laborer had caught the attention of the CEO.  There wasn’t a better compliment for Dean, no matter how uncomfortable Castiel knew it made the laborer.  No choice.  “Of course,” Castiel said, smiling back.  “I have to warn you, Sam’s new to being an executive laborer.  He won’t know any of the protocols or customs.  Today was his first day, and I mostly brought him to get a feel for things.”
Benny sighed.  “You ever hear the expression that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is?  Well, Castiel Novak turning his back on his entire life and biting the hand that feeds him just seems a little too good to be true.”
“It was a setup, Cass!” Dean exclaimed.  “Sammy’s smart.  He got wind of something and poked someone in Roman Enterprises where it hurts.  He’d been on it like a bloodhound, trying to find out whatever it was the company was hiding.  That job he went on should have been quick, easy money.  It’s precisely why he took it, so he could finish it and get back to his so-called research.  But he never called back, didn’t check in, he just disappeared.  So I went after him and found out he’d been jumped by a bunch of goons in a black van, dragged off.  I had no idea where he was.  It’s just luck that I was near the neighborhood when I heard the call over my police scanner about a man with black eyes out in the street.  Even the scanner said he was on a rampage, but that isn’t what was happening, Cass.  The whole thing was a set-up from beginning to end.  I scooped Sam up just moments before the cops would have.”
“I’m glad you see things my way,” Mikey declared.  “For what it’s worth, my men and I will give you as much privacy as we can while still maintaining due vigilance.  We will be as unobtrusive as possible.  But you must understand, there is a real danger here.  Someone wants the Senator dead.  That someone is just as likely to want one or both of you gone as well.  You represent several million votes each, just by standing up there by the Senator and waving to the crowd.  Do you think whoever is after the Senator doesn’t know that?”
“Of course I believe it!” Rufus snarled.  “After what that fucker did, there’s nothing I wouldn’t put past him for a chance to get ahead.”
“Alright, but that really begs the question then,” Dean said.  “Gabe, why the hell would you give something like that up?”
“Not really,” Cass corrected.  “I’ve told you about my nightmares, but you still haven’t talked about yours.”
Cass flinched slightly.  Wide blue eyes slowly shifted, fixed on Dean.  To Dean’s immense relief, the barrel of the gun stayed pointed at the smoking remains of the television.  Hopefully, things would stay that way.
Now the computers were really working.  The whine of the coolant system kicked in, cooling down the processors as Castiel pushed them.  All around him, the numbers and figures flew by.  Castiel spun and twisted, moving them this way and that, combining and tearing apart figures and equations.  He was close.  He knew he was.
Dean asked his new friend a bit about what the angel hunters had in mind.  By the time they finally reached Bobby’s cabin and parted ways, Dean was ready to explode.  “What the hell?!” he roared, storming in the door.  “Whose idiotic idea was it to tell the cops I was a kidnapping victim?!”
“Azazel?”  Jody frowned and shook her head.  “The name doesn’t sound familiar, but I can look him up, see if he’s got any record anywhere.”
“Yeah, I know,” Dean sighed.  “But how the hell was I supposed to know he was an angel?  I was just trying to shake his hand, you know, like normal people do.  Surprised the hell out of me when he grabbed my wrist, shoved my sleeve back and clamped his hand on my arm.”  Dean slid back his sleeve, looking at dismay at the marks scarred into the flesh of his forearm.  His finger traced the old scars before lingering on the new ones.  “It didn’t hurt the first time, when I was registered.  It didn’t hurt this time, either.  Just tingled a bit, almost itched.  But there was this glow under his hand when he was doing it.  Of course, I figured out right away what he was up to.  I tried, Bobby.  I tried hard to pull loose.  But the strength of this guy!”
When Castiel opened his eyes, the first thing he did was check the other bed.  Dean was there, sound asleep.  The relief he felt from seeing that the teen hadn’t run away was surprising.  His conscience was bothering him about keeping Dean with him.  Castiel firmly believed that the murders and the fire at the cabin were related, that someone was driving him out of his familiar haunts and keeping him stressed and on the run.  Why was a mystery.  Dean’s question was a good one.  Why would someone simply burn down the cabin, with Baby’s presence an obvious indicator that someone was near?  It didn’t make sense.
“Not all of it,” Sam corrected.  “There’s a network of tunnels going out of the rim, but only for a couple of miles.  Then they come up to the surface.  Because what we didn’t know was that, once you get through the worst of the mess outside the domes, you get to the real outside air.  And that’s where those tunnels surface.  In the outside air, where the farmlands are.”
Ellen emerged from the kitchen, bringing a steaming mug that she placed on the table in front of Dean.  “Coffee,” she explained.  “Looks like you need it.”
“It’s too bad that we can’t use ours to travel through time,” Gabe was saying. “I would so love to see what dad was like as a teenager!”
Cas went still.  “Naomi, with one of her techs.  A couple days before I was stolen.  Gabriel, you’d been having nightmares again, about Sammy?  Samandriel was spending nearly all of his time with you.  So Naomi was using the diagnostic jack to keep tabs on the rest of us.”
Miserable, I roamed through the darkness outside of the cabin, waving off the guards who came to see what I was doing.  I sank down next to the frog pond on my haunches, looking moodily into the water. The electric light of my own eyes competed with the stars, reflected in the still water.  No wonder the guards had noticed me so easily.
Cass nodded.  “I left him my coat, hoping that it could help trigger his true memories.  When it didn’t work, I expected him to destroy it.  The fact that he didn’t gives me some hope.”
“Of course not.”  He gave Castiel a gentle smile.  “Here, give me the toothbrush, you’re finished.  Rinse, please!”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably.  “At first, there wasn’t anything.  When we lost Samandriel, we started refusing to go on the jacks.  The handlers had to force us.  Every day, they’d drag us in, strap us down, force the jacks into our plates.  Once we were on the jacks, we’d do the work because that’s what we always did, what dad programmed us to do.  But obviously the work suffered,” he continued, missing the expression on Dean’s face.  “We’d max out the jacks and they’d let us go, but we, well, I suppose Samandriel would have diagnosed us with depression.”
He froze, staring at the figure in the hall.  Dean looked up, taking in the tactical outfit, the weapons, the silenced pistol in his hand, and the still bodies of the guards on the floor near the door.
“You want to save him, get the truck up to him so I can drag him in!”  Bobby shoved at Dean.  “Move your ass!  Sam, get the second truck going.  All of you, move!”
“No, there aren’t.”  Dean was pushing him now, moving him back until he bumped against the sink.  “Maybe we can get a bit of exercise in after all? With no cameras, well, that opens the door to some possibilities!”
“Oooooh!” Lucifer breathed, leaning back.  “No wonder you’re on Mikey’s shit list,” he whispered.  “That’s practically blasphemy!”
Rooney opened his shirt.  There, carved into the skin of his chest were a set of broken scars spelling out the word “PIG” in capital letters.  Dean stared, forgetting to blink until Rooney closed his shirt again.
Castiel struggled to pay attention.  His thoughts constantly drifted back to Dean.  He couldn’t imagine what was going through Dean’s head.  The laborer tended to his duties, serving drinks and rubbing Donavan’s shoulders when the other executive decided to try his massage technique.  Castiel wanted to punch Donavan.  But at least it kept Dean occupied.  Dean kept his gaze obediently down, his face perfectly neutral.  It was impossible to tell what he might be feeling.
Dean thought he could come up with about half a dozen better lines, but had no interest in pressing the subject.  Cass, his Cass, was back.  Somehow, despite all odds, Cass has broken through the mind control.  Now he was here, badass as ever, fighting hard to protect both him and the very man everything had been about in the first place.
Cass shrugged.  “Not sure.  I need to get my head straightened out, decide what to do next.”  He beamed at Dean.  “You being here, with me?  That really helps.  Plus, we can work on our relationship.”
I felt like every nerve in my body was on fire. In a way, it wasn’t far off from the truth.  I was lying on the floor of the cabin, flat on my face with my head turned to the right side.  And my cybernetics were going haywire.  My right arm was jerking as if in the throes of a massive seizure, fingers, wrist, and elbow joints twitching and bending without dislodging the broken cable that still jutted from my right sleeve.  The rest of my body, though, wasn’t any more in my control than my prosthetic arm.  I had no control over my muscles.  All I could do was just lie there and twitch. My optics and aural implants were fried as well, assaulting me with static, random sounds, and weird, unfocused sights in various colors and magnifications.  But it was getting better.  Slowly, everything was fading.  Not good.  I was losing consciousness fast.  I strained to stay awake.  “Cas!”
Bad enough to have walked as far as he had on a poorly-maintained dirt road with the stupid sex cuffs still locked onto his ankles.  He’d fallen twice and had scraped-up palms and knees to prove it.  Worse was how embarrassingly easy it had been for Cass to get him back.  The former POW had apparently driven out to the end of the long, winding dirt road, parked his car just out of sight, and found a comfortable seat behind a grove of trees.  Dean had come wobbling his way down the road, completely oblivious in his quest to walk without falling again.  He hadn’t even realized Cass was there until he’d been pounced on.
I was barely in the other room when freezing cold air blasted through the cabin.  Son of a bitch.  I raced outside, kicked in the night vision, and went after him.
“It’s more than just the GPS!”  Dean slid his hand out from under Castiel’s and suddenly seized Castiel’s wrist in a painful grip.  He raised Castiel’s arm, shaking it accusingly.  “Come on, Cass, your family designed these things.  Did you really believe whatever bullshit story Roman sold you?  Look at this, Cass!  It’s not just like my collar, it’s exactly the same.  It’s another collar!  The only difference between it and the one I’m wearing is that I can’t use mine to shock you.  But we’re both slaves now.  To Dick Roman!”
Indecision raged in Ellen’s eyes.  Then she lowered her head.  “I believe you,” she said quietly.  “Don’t know why, but I believe you.”
Dean slowly got to his feet, thinking that he had to be the dumbest son of a bitch alive.  Here he was, trapped in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with a PTSD sufferer who probably believed he was still in a hole in the desert, about to be tortured again at any moment.  The guy had a gun in his hand that was obviously loaded.  And here Dean was, providing him with a perfect target.  Dean swallowed hard.  “Cass, look at me,” he pleaded.  “Please, won’t you just look at me, Castiel?”
Dean hovered near Cass, waiting as the room emptied.  Now it was just the three of them.  Dean kept his eyes on the carpeting and saw Roman’s polished black shoes approach.
“As much as I can to hold them off.  There’s nothing I can do to save myself now.  But I still have a chance to save you.”  He gave Dean a shove.  “Go, Dean!  Run!”
“Exactly.  And that means that all of my projects are back at my lab.  Except one.”  He went back to work, clearing out the remaining errors.  Then he smiled.  “That’s it! The control framework for Project Samandriel is finished!  Now all I need is enough processing time in my lab at Angeli Quinque to put it together.”
Cass didn’t answer.  Dean stiffened.  “Wait,” he called, “Angel would have his mojo and his name, but still be hurt and trapped.  And you think he could somehow get out from under the King of Hell and his demons?”
Harper gave a small smile when the two executives looked at him that turned into a smirk for Dean when they looked away.  Dean leaned over and coughed onto Harper’s plate.  The smirk vanished.
Of course, the demon trying to force him to eat didn’t know that.  Samandriel realized it was to his benefit to keep it that way and reluctantly opened his mouth.
Mind made up, Dean made his list.  He looked through Bobby’s lore, found the best angel wards that looked easiest to draw, and got to work.  The wards, he quickly discovered, were tough to do, especially on the underside of the hastily removed seats.  Dean simply couldn’t bring himself to deface his Baby by putting them anywhere obvious.  Didn’t matter.  Wards were wards.  The fact you couldn’t see them didn’t matter in the end, just that they were there. And Dean was about eighty percent positive he’d gotten the right wards, painted correctly.  A little mistake here or there couldn’t hurt.  He’d only be out for an hour, an hour and a half at most.  He’d taken more time than that getting ready.  Too bad he couldn’t use the fake credit cards.  It was a small town, full of people who would know Bobby, and likely know about the cards.  Dean searched, but couldn’t find any stash of cash.  Dean’s own stash was still back in the room he’d banished Blue Eyes from.  But at least he had his wallet, with his own credit cards.  It was ok.  If he was quick, he’d be fine.
“Far as I know it does.  Alright, I’ll throw some shit together and meet you out there.”  He paused.  “Dean?  You sure you’re not being followed?”
Castiel had heard Dean’s door open immediately.  He’d responded by instinct, heading out to keep Dean from leaving.  Now that Dean was back in his room, Castiel realized sleep was an impossible dream.
With my hearing cranked up, my phone ringing sounded like a gong hit right next to my head.  I swore, dropped my hearing back to normal levels, and answered.  “Dean?” Bobby’s voice told me.  “We got him.  Lenny found him lost out in the field.”
“It does.”  And it must have been even colder at night, when Dean was left alone up here without even a blanket for warmth.  Guilt preyed on Castiel.  “Listen, I’m sorry for leaving you up here.  I never should have done that.”
Balthazar gave her a look.  “So, instead of accomplishing one impossible feat, we’re now working on two?  This is a great plan!”
I saw Dean’s eyes widen as he understood, saw them flick to Gabriel, still cradled in the arms of a frantic Sammy.  “Dean!” Sammy yelled.  “Please, I’m sorry about what happened to you, but it’s not Gabe’s fault!  If you can help, then please!  Do it!”
The other angel nodded at Dean, before turning his attention to Samandriel.  He winced in sympathy.  “The King of Hell did a number on you, brother.  Of course, you wouldn’t look much better under Naomi’s tender ministrations.  Or maybe she’s already had her chance?”  His finger gingerly touched the wound in Samandriel’s skull.
“Well, that much is simple!” Lucifer exclaimed. He made a chopping motion with his hand, dismissing Dean’s personnel file.  “We find that bastard, and we shoot him in the head, preferably twice to make sure! Problem solved.  Hey, great meeting!”
“Fine!”  Dean put the bottle back, dug into his pocket, and produced his wallet.  It contained a twenty and a five, all that was left of the money he’d mowed lawns all summer to earn.  For a moment, he considered breaking the twenty.  Then he shook his head.  That was stupid.  Sammy wanted something that cost five bucks, and here was that exact amount.  He reluctantly produced the five and handed it to his brother.
“Yes and no.  They’re jealous of you, but since I’m a guy and the rest of those assholes on the board with you are apparently straight?  They don’t see me as competition.  Dude, you would not believe the shit I am learning!”
Castiel chuckled.  “No, Dean.  I’m trusting your judgement now.  I’ve been thinking about you, how to keep you safe.”
Paydirt.  Cass’s eyes grew wide.  They flicked around, finally seeing his surroundings.  His breathing sped up, turning into harsh, panicked pants.  “I’m...  But I can’t be, they won’t let me go, they...”
“You still took a human life,” Dean pointed out gently.  “That’s not something you can just shrug off.  Whatever you’re feeling right now, whatever you might feel later?  You’re entitled to it.”
“You know, you really are being a bitch about this, Cassie,” Lucifer began.  “Mike’s been busting his ass with these people!  He stalled as long as he could, but all they want is you and they’re not willing to wait until Winchester’s back!”
“Yeah,” Dean managed, unable to look away.  Fuck it.  Two steps and he had Cass in his arms.  Kissing him qualified as one of the best things in the world.  When Cass pulled away after a moment, Dean frowned and tried hard to pull him back.  “C’mon!”
“You know how groups like the Demons have been making a lot more threats lately, since the announcement?" Dean said.  "It was one of those groups, the Stynes.  Luc’s people believed it to be a legitimate threat, so you were assigned to lead a team and investigate.”
Castiel stared into the mirror at his own face. He looked pale, drawn.  He could feel himself shaking, teetering on the edge. No.  Keep it together, Angel Castiel.  But he’d come close, so close, to losing Dean.  What if, the next time, the shot wasn’t in Dean’s arm?
Castiel breathed deeply, using Dean to center himself and calm.  “I know,” he admitted.  “Of course you’re probably right.  But how can I take that chance?  I can’t risk you being taken away!”
Bobby leaned over with the others.  The phone displayed a photo, along with some information about a man he’d never heard of or seen before.  “James Novak,” he read.  “Who’s this?”
“I’ll be on the books, as Chimera.  I know.  The only good thing is that it shouldn’t matter too much.  Cas fixed the dates on the wristbands.  We’ll be going back to the cabin, so I shouldn’t trip too many alarms.  As long as he disconnects me and blacks me out fast, I’ll be alright.”  I looked towards Cas.  “Cas says that we should instantly replace the current version of ourselves, creating a brand-new timeline from that point on.  It’s why we won’t be able to use Project Samandriel again, because from then on, we’ll be chronologically displaced, and our personal timelines won’t line up with the natural one.  But we’ll be us, with every freckle and scar, and have full knowledge of everything we’ve experienced.”  I smiled.  “Honestly, it’ll be nice to go back to the cabin again.  The blizzard takes out the coms, which means we’ll have time to just sit quietly together and talk a bit.  I’m shit at the chick flick moments, Bobby, but even I know we need to talk some shit out.”
“No one’s making any accusations about him,” Benny cautioned.  “It’s just that, you gotta admit, it’s a little suspicious.”
Castiel’s hand moved from Dean’s shoulder to cup the back of Dean’s head, holding him still.  The kiss was long and sweet and everything Castiel wanted.  For a moment, he was young again, sharing his first kiss with his first love.  But no.  He was no child.  And here he was, kissing the laborer that his father had specifically ordered no one to touch.
