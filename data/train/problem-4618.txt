"Cas, we're family. We need you.
Cas enveloped Jack in what must have been a bone-crushing hug, and a lump formed in Dean's throat. He wished Jack could stay, not just for his sake, but for Cas's too. He almost wished that Jack hadn't been born a super-baby so he could have had the chance to grow up normally before going to run heaven. He briefly considered what it would have been like to raise Jack like that, him and Cas taking care of Jack as a baby, and something tugged at his heart. Jack hugged Dean next, and if Dean held on a little bit longer than usual, no one said anything about it.
A chill travelled down his spine as he stepped into the hall. The hairs on his arms rose and for a a second Dean thought he smelled something almost like iodine. Damn. He really needed to get about fixing the air-conditioning in this place.
"Geez, don't look so shocked. I can be nice sometimes."
Dean was already halfway done with breakfast by the time Cas dragged his ass out of bed.
know this song. He whispered the lyrics against Dean's ear, and Dean found himself with a newfound appreciation for whoever had written them. A shiver crept down Dean's spine, and he stepped impossibly closer to Cas, letting the warmth of him seep into Dean's bones.
and never mentioned it again. Now it was Cas who sometimes needed someone to stay up with him. He never told Dean what his nightmares were about, but Cas had a tendency to talk in his sleep and he'd heard Cas call out his own name more than once followed by a string of words like

too far gone on him. Not that he would do anything to change that. Reluctantly, he turned away and creaked open the door, trying not to let too much light creep into the room.
Cas hadn't known. He'd spent god known how long feeling the same way as Dean, and not saying anything because he somehow thought that there was no possible way that Dean could ever love him back. How many times had Cas almost said it before this? How many times had Cas tried, but Dean was too stubborn to hear it? And now Dean couldn't fix it, couldn't even tell him because Cas was-
some delusional part of him thought as he shivered. There wasn't a ghost in the bunker, that he knew for sure. After the whole Mrs. Butters thing, Sam and Dean had double and triple checked the bunker for any other spirits or entities currently living there. Sage, exorcisms, the whole deal. Besides, despite Dean's current state, he hadn't felt any cold spots before... whatever the hell had just happened.
"Okay, Claire that's enough," Jody cut in, setting the duffle bags on top of the map table. "I think he gets the message."
The main melody tapered off slowly, and Cas pulled Dean's head down and tilted him into a kiss as the last note rang. It was slow and sweet and Dean realized for the tenth time that day that he was an idiot for waiting so long when they could have had this the whole time.
Castiel blinked, his own name echoing through his brain as all the walls Naomi had put in him came crashing down.
Cas was back. They had won. Everything was okay.
Castiel leaned forward, watching as Dean's eyes closed, ready to receive benediction. He pressed their lips together, waiting for the response, for acceptance, but Dean's lips were still. Motionless.
Castiel was powerless as he watched Dean die in front of him for the second time.
. It was enough to put together a nasty picture, especially with how, on the worse nights, Cas would cling to him like he couldn't believe that Dean was still there.

Dean cast his gaze downward, and Castiel was enraged, if only for a moment. He stepped forward and captured Dean's jaw with one hand.
"Oh."
going to smell smoke when he walked down that hall. At least Kaia had the decency to look guilty.
“What are you looking for?” Sam asked.
He hopes God won’t smite him for potentially lying and manipulating his best friend, because Dean is just trying to protect Cas. Good intentions count, right?
And Willie Mays,
Cas was about to say “Yes” but the phone cut out before he had the chance. He hated when companies did that.
“What? A guy has needs,” Dean argues. “Also, you gotta get up. I can’t have dried come staining Baby.”
Cas didn’t believe that he’d actually want to feel like this ever again. He could only remember the first winter vacation during freshman year, and how Dean and he stayed on campus. One night, Dean came up with the brilliant – if stupid – idea to do their own version of the ‘Polar Plunge.’ You know, skinny-dipping in ice-cold water for a supposedly good cause? Except there wasn’t a good cause or rational reason for Dean and Cas to freeze. There’s never any method to Dean’s madness. Cas had learned that in the following years.
He picked up his fork and started eating, but Dean caught his arm.
“Correct. My brother Gabriel was in charge of it, though. Are you in the fraternity, too?”
To try and save your home
When I was 4 years old, Dad bought me toy guns so I could play cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians with the neighbor’s kids. When Mama found out, she snatched them out of my hand and threw them away. She spent the rest of the afternoon locked in the bathroom crying. I kept calling out to her, banging on the door – hoping she would open it so I could help her.
“Yes. Now, let me return the favor.” He reaches over, pulling Dean back down on the hood of the car.
“We’re four years apart!”
sitting on a dildo, may I ask?”
“Second of all, yes, you can die from heatstroke. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on average, over 600 people die from complications related to extreme heat each year in the United States - more than tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, lightning or any other weather event combined.”
Cas laughed as soon as he recognized it as one of Dean’s mixtapes – this time, labeled as “Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.” His best friend had spent the better half of high school teaching Cas what good music was.
“Huh?” Still shaken, Dean had trouble forgetting what just happened.
Circle of Hell Club quite well. Many years ago, Crowley brought him in as one of the first employees and was grooming him to take it over one day. But as Dean became older than most of the club’s patrons, he knew that this party lifestyle wasn’t for him. Thankfully, that was around the same time that Dean’s dad named him the head of daily operations at their family business, Winchester Auto. Dean’s first project there was to oversee the buying of Singer Salvage Yard. It was sad because Dean honestly liked Mr. Singer, but Dad was counting on him. If everything went right with that initial sale, Dean was on track to one day inherit his father’s business and become President and CEO of the company.
“What about girls?”
Halfway through his stream, Dean said: “I can feel your eyes boring into the back of my skull. It’s creepy to stare at someone urinating, you know.”
They kissed and Dean turned off the camera recording them on Cas’ bed.
The man rustled around in his pockets to find two packets of lube. Dean heard the rip of foil and the anticipation made his cock that much harder.
missing that. No one had to know about his guilty pleasure except Cas. Though, Dean would admit that the bending and stretching did help with their sex life).
Dean stuck his tongue out and replied: “You’re my brother. That’s different.”
And castles in the sand.
Dean finally came out of his room many hours later, much more sore than he originally had been during the earlier part of his hangover. Sam saw his sheepish look and nodded towards him, accepting the apology that might never be spoken. Sam’s job was done – maybe he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it turned out right in the end.
Yeah, I know, I know.

The younger Castiel pauses. He stands still, weapon at the ready. Light glints off the blade.

Eileen grins widely. She gives a sly grin to Jack, then points at herself.
Dean, Sam, Eileen, Donna and Jody are sitting at the library table, pouring out shots for each other. A few people are still milling around in the war room including the Wayward Daughters, but the library is otherwise empty.
"Yep, just like in Star Wars, buddy."
Sam was smiling down at his phone, completely transfixed by whatever conversation he was having. He chuckled and began typing furiously, his protein shake half forgotten.
There was a picture of a guy so young he might as well still be in high school. Short hair, brown eyes, all freckles. At first glance he reminded Dean a bit of Alfie the Weiner Hut angel.
"Why all the secrecy? I mean, couldn't you just tell Sam or Jody to go look into it? And why did you wait until now to ask?"
"Yes, I'll take care of him tonight," Cas said. He squeezed Dean's hands one more time before standing up to wake Jack and lead him back to his room.
"Thank you for breakfast," Cas said, flashing that gummy smile. Dean loved him. Dean loved him so much it hurt. He squeezed Cas's hand.
"I'm-" He couldn't remember what happened. His heart was racing in an uneven gallop, and he felt like he could go to sleep right now and not wake up until tomorrow night.
Dean really needed to get the air conditioner fixed.
"Kill him." The order came through clearly. Castiel's jaw clenched and he tightened his hold on Dean, pressing the blade up against Dean's neck. Castiel expected Dean to fight back, but instead he relaxed, leaning back against Castiel.
"Thanks kid."
Thank you to my lovely beta: Grammarly, for making sure I didn't make a fool of myself while posting this.
"Where's Donna?" Dean asked, "Also, what about Patience and Alex? I thought we were getting all the girls in one place for once."
The order came through clearly, leaving no room for interpretation or leeway, but when he saw Dean coming up to him he just, stopped. Castiel didn't raise his fists, didn't unsheathe his blade, and when Dean swung at him Castiel didn't move to defend himself. Pain shot across Castiel's face as Dean's fist made contact. He was vaguely aware that the blow would most likely leave a bruise, but right now he didn't care. They couldn't make him betray Dean, not again. He let Dean hit him over and over again, each blow a physical reminder of what he was fighting for. He could hear Naomi telling him to fight back, to kill him, could feel how much easier it would be to let himself sink back into the lull of following his orders and trusting that they were right and just.
"Wait. He's only
Tags will be added with each chapter that requires a new one so as to avoid spoilers as this is being released, and I will issue warnings for anything that might come up.
Dean laughed. That was certainly one way to put it. Then her face softened into an expression usually reserved for when she didn't think Jody was looking. "You really love him don't you?"
"Yeah, I thought I did too," Eileen sighed as she leaned against Sam, wrapping a hand around his waist.
"Oh, don't worry I'll be there. And I'll come back before the wedding too! Heaven is nice, but I miss you sometimes."
"Fuck you."
team here."
going on here. He couldn't just let that go. He still had a job god damnit. He opened up a new tab and began to type "Ghost Stories Hell Michigan" when a tap on his shoulder made him nearly fall out of his seat.
"Tell us what?" Cas asked, a smile ghosting the corners of his lips as if he already knew what was going on.
with Cas. Some days everything he wanted to say got stuck in the back of his throat and no matter how hard he tried he couldn't get it out, not the right way, not the way he wanted. This morning though, the words fell through his lips as easy as breathing.
The bad boy whistled low under his breath, shaking his head. His brightly-colored mohawk blew in the afternoon breeze.
Whenever I was sick or upset, Mama made me a sandwich. So that’s what I did. I dragged the step-stool from the garage and climbed up on it to make her a sandwich. It didn’t look as nice as when she made it. I tried to cut the crusts off, but I’m not old enough to use a knife in the kitchen yet. Daddy says I have to be a ‘big boy’ before that happens.
“No, Dean. I’m not. You’re the one always complaining about how water will ruin the interior of your car.”
Putting a hand on his shoulder in mock seriousness, Dean said: “You’ll understand when you’re older, Samantha. Let the grownups talk.”
Dean ripped open the man’s pants, sending a button flying across the room. He distantly heard the ‘kerplop’ sound it made as it hid the inside of one of the toilets.
“Yes, just… “ Cas hesitates, unsure if he needs to finish that sentence. “… be careful, okay? Go slow.”
, Dean thought. Maybe this wasn’t the place for that specific sequence of events, but it still was a prominent fantasy he dreamed about every so often.
That did not go how Cas wanted it to. He hadn’t seen Gabe since the end of last semester in May because they spent the summer with different halves of their divorced parents. Cas was counting on this party to reconnect. He thought that this year would be different – their last year.
The stranger raised one eyebrow as if to challenge him. “Then prove it to me. Show me why I should waste my time with you.”
of a wedding.
, and what a nice cock it was. The revelation shook something loose inside of Dean, and he stroked it several times. Feeling both the hardness and the curves, the velvety smooth skin with veins running up and down the length. Veins carrying blood that told him this was real –
Cas groaned, throwing a hand over his eyes to add drama.
Oh yeah, Sam was coming up to stay the week with them before they all drove back to Kansas together. How could Cas have forgotten?
The stranger sped up his thrusts and reached around to jerk Dean’s dick off to the same pace. They were both close, and a minute later, Dean found himself spilling into the bottom of the toilet. At least there was minimal clean-up.
way… because Dean could make anything sexual (don’t dare him to try – he will always win). Cas wasn’t even looking at Dean, but could feel those eyes leer at him from across the room.
“By all means, go ahead. I need some time to regain my flaming heterosexuality.”
His friend hesitates. A blush creeps up on his face.
“Ooh, clamoring. Big word, Mr. Bookworm.”
After looking back at Dean one final time, the stranger left. The slam of the bathroom door reverberated on the walls, and Dean felt safe enough to stretch. He didn’t bother touching his ass as it was still a bit sore. He’d deal with it when he got home.
Dean and Cas had been going out for almost two months now. At the beginning, Dean was hesitant to start a new relationship, as he had just been kicked to the curb (quite literally – his clothes were thrown from a third-story window and he was chased outside by an old lady with a broom and a frying pan) after his last attempt. But Cas was kind, and patient, and… “dreamy,” according to his best friend Charlie.
“What the fuck, dude?” he spat out, pushing back against the surprisingly heavy weight.
Dream while you can
“Hey,” Cas says as he pulls Dean’s head closer so they can look at each other. “I want
“You.”
Dean grabbed the front of the man’s shirt as he plundered his mouth with all he had. He licked inside and within seconds, engaged in a battle for dominance as both men’s tongues met each other. If you were to ask Dean’s opinion, he thought that it went pretty well.
“Hmm?” Cas’ boyfriend didn’t want to separate their lips. He could feel the vibration of the words on both of their mouths. Why did they have to talk
“What? No… okay, yeah. What gave me away?”
“Meg, leave the poor kid alone. He’s just here to have a good time.” Dean hadn’t noticed another stranger beside them, but he was grateful for the interruption.
“Are you sure?”
“Okay. Let’s practice it again, then.”
“Winchester, you’ve got to man up. It’s just a date, one simple date. You’ve been on those before. You’re with Cas, there’s nothing to be afraid of. He’s not going to tie you up and murder you, and Jo is on standby for an emergency call (though she’d totally make fun of you later for using her as an excuse). You can do this.”
When Sam and Cas headed outside, the impala was gone. Apparently, Dean had driven home drunk. The two men called a taxi cab to pick them up. Once they were back at the bunker, they tried knocking on Dean’s door, but he didn’t answer. He had classic rock music blaring through the stereo, though, so they knew he was there.
“Hello there.” Cas said brightly to the cashier as they moved to the front. Obviously he was a morning person, unlike Dean.
Dean saw the flap on the bottom half of his bedroom door lift up. That right there was one of his smartest ideas. He was actually a little proud of it. During his frequent temper-tantrums, he usually wouldn’t venture outside of his room – even for food. So, he cut a rectangle of wood out of his bedroom door and installed something that looked like a doggy door. It allowed Sam or Cas to bring him food or water or mail until he was in a better mood, which was exactly what seemed to be happening right now.
With that, he pushed away from the table and stood up. Cas grabbed his arm, but Dean shook him off.
“Dean, I’m serious! You give off that type of confidence that girls love. Like you’ve done this before. I don’t stand a chance. Who’s gonna pick me, a shy virgin with little to no people skills?”
“It’s not my fault you guys can’t keep up. I guess you two lightweights really are made for each other. I’ll just have to find someone that won’t hold me back. Being a third wheel isn’t my thing.”
“You – you wanted it?” Dean repeats, not comprehending words and thoughts this early in the morning.
Cas saves those words and tucks them into the corner of his mind for later. Now, though…
“I hope you prepped yourself before coming here,” the stranger added, pulling down Dean’s pants and underwear. They were only held up by where Dean’s thighs pressed against the toilet. “It would be a shame if you had to wait any longer than absolutely necessary.”
“No,” Cas replied as he took Dean’s hands in his. “I quite prefer a different Winchester.”
’ to go. Cas ended up spending an hour there and coming out with bags full of items that he said “would be perfect for the Gishwhes challenge next year. It’s good to stock up  early, Dean.”
The man took one photo just of Dean, and then they had a few together with silly poses. Before handing the phone back, the man sent the images to himself.
he thinks. He wants to rewind the moment, say something different, be a better friend – something, anything besides letting his stupid mouth be in control – but Cas has already turned over to the other side and is lightly snoring. Dean figures that the least he could do now is remove his jacket and fold it into a pillow to lay under Cas’ head. He watches the sky for a bit, not noticing the shooting star as he, too, drifts off to sleep.
He kissed Cas once more, and they laid like that for a long while.
“Is that too much to ask for these days?” he finally asked.
Cas nodded his head and Dean pulled his underwear slowly off his body, moving downwards.
Cas rested his head on Dean’s shoulder, and Dean lay his head on top of Cas’. He could hear the faint click of a camera a few feet behind them taking a picture, but Dean couldn’t be bothered to move. Whatever the reason, he wanted to stay like this for as long as possible.
Sam stood up, and noticed he was missing one sandal. Perhaps it fell off during the game?
Around half an hour later, Dean finally was able to come back to the car. He opened the backseat door and squatted, putting his hand on Cas’ thigh.
Dean didn’t know why Castiel’s approval meant so much to him, but he fought off a blush nonetheless.
He kissed Cas’ forehead in reassurance. It was their “thing” – whenever they said goodbye to each other for a long period of time, or someone needed to be calmed down, that person kissed them on the head. Dean kissed Cas the first week they met in kindergarten, and Cas kissed Dean when his mother died a couple years later. It didn’t mean anything, just two friends caring about each other.
“Dean, I’m serious. You can’t distract me with sex whenever there’s a problem. Orgasms don’t fix everything.”
Dean really needed to shut up now, or else he would miss the small smile and glint in Cas’ eye.
“I wouldn’t dream of it. You’re a proper lady.”
“What? Cas, you must be joking.”
If Dean were honest, he’d say that the light blue dress shirt brought out the man’s eyes. However, he settled on one last look and led with: “Why don’t you unbutton it?”
Cas stuck his tongue out at Dean. “Yes, dear.”
Rolling on his side to face his friend, Cas says: “Will you fuck me?”
I know we cut off his head, but he’ll be back in no time – with yet another name and human vessel.
“So… you like getting pounded into a wall, do you? I can work with that,” She leered at him. Dean backed away, feeling creeped out.
- - -
“What are you saying, Cas? That I should just slam into you like the pornos I know you watch? Don’t lie – I can see through that bedroom window of yours!”
“Dean.” More insistent this time, but the owner of that name was still in a haze, caught up in the scene before his very eyes. Cas was facing away from the screen, holding his ass open with one hand while trying to push his cock into the waiting hole with the other.
As Dean pulled away, though, Cas felt himself chasing his lips. He kissed Dean back, leaving them both wide-eyed and speechless. Dean quickly got with the program, though, and covered Cas’ mouth with his own. Pushing one hand through Cas’ thick head of hair, Dean trailed his lips down Cas’ jaw and neck. He pulled the collar of Cas’ t-shirt further down to expose more skin. His right hand moved from Cas’ neck down his back.
It should be illegal to go from a serious expression to puppy dog eyes in the span of a second. Dean is no match for the deep blues in front of him, and he folds like a cheap paper plate.
Dean took a big breath and sighed. “Relax, Cas. Try and get some sleep, yeah? If you’re still worried about this in the morning, we can talk about it then.”
So dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Cas turned towards his boyfriend. “Don’t you have an extra stash of clothes here saved in case of emergencies, Dean?”
“That too.”
“I hate you so-ohhh” Dean couldn’t finish his sentence. He let himself close his eyes and get lost in the pleasure. ‘Hate’ was such a strong word, he thought. How could he dislike anyone that made him feel like this?
“Ooh baby, talk nerdy to me,” Dean joked.
Dean punched his partner on the shoulder and blew him a kiss as he walked away. Dean spotted Ed and Harry doing their thing, but he surprisingly didn’t envy them. He was happy just where he was.
not a signal.”
Dean knew his mind was playing tricks on him, so he laughed and shook his head, blinking several times. But the bird was still there, not moving a single muscle. They stared at each other for what felt like an eternity.
Dean knew the basics (and then some) of a good blow job. It had been years since he’d given one - probably hadn’t been since the Crowley era, if he was being honest. He had perfected his technique in the stalls of this exact bathroom, back when glory holes were all the rage. Dean hoped that Crowley had enough sense to build new stalls – those things were highly unsanitary and the legality of them was questionable at best.
Thankfully, Cas comes to the rescue. He leans forward to whisper: “Have you ever touched yourself back there, Dean?”
Cas gave his boyfriend a merciful kiss before saying, “If you mess with the bull, you get the horns, Dean.”
Dean walked closer, slapping them both on the back. “My best friend and my brother getting married. Who would have thought? How about we go celebrate, yeah? Drinks are on me.”
It was a short drive to the neighborhood park, but it was hard to find a parking spot that suited Dean. He dropped Sam and Cas off at the front, opting to drive around the lot once again before choosing a stall under some shade.
“Let's go, loser. Time to burn off some steam. Sam's on his way. We're all going to the park down the street. Also, Sam and I are totally gonna kick your ass, because we're the
“Okay, I’m doing something wrong then.”
Cas writhes on the bed – the stimulation being both too much and not enough. Dean holds him down, pushing Cas into the memory-foam mattress. It will be a reminder of their sweet lovemaking long after it’s over.
Cas is the first to wake up, noticing Dean’s warm embrace around him. His hand is resting on Cas’ hip and Dean’s face is buried in the back of Cas’ neck, emitting puffs of air every so often. As Cas regains consciousness, he notices the inconvenience of his morning erection – now growing thanks to Cas’ proximity to his best friend and long-time crush, Dean Winchester.
Just why they had to die
“What can I say, we spend more time with each other than our own girlfriends. You learn a thing or two along the way. If we can’t help each other out every now and again, who will?”
“- Assbutt?” Cas helpfully supplies.
“Rough day?” the stranger from the other night asked as he bent to pick up Dean’s map. He held it out with slender fingers.
“Not that I’m interested, but I did see a booth advertising ‘Daddy Cruises’ down the street. The cruise offered an optional day of service to a local group in need, such as participating in a food drive for a local LGBTQ center. That might be something Cas would enjoy.”
“But that’s an unfair advantage!” Cas says as he reluctantly gets up and crosses his arms in protest.
It was the last week of their senior year, and the summer weather was at an all-time high. Of course Cas had to choose the one college dormitory building that was located on the top of a hill, which made each step feel like a million miles. Dean still reminded Cas about how he almost crashed his prized car going down the hill during an especially dark and rainy night. Summers weren’t any easier, it seemed.
Dean stopped at his locker to get the books for his next class. Shutting the door, he said: “Wait, you’ve got a long dick.”
“Condom?” Dean asks.
“What? Benny told me about it, and you know he knows what he’s talking about.”
“Cas? You there, buddy? How many times have I told you to stop sharing your screen with me while watching porn?”
“You’re an asshole.”
A couple minutes passed. Dean was falling asleep when he heard Cas rustle around next to him.
Dean woke up around 6 or 6:30 the next morning. He didn’t get much sleep the night before thanks to the thoughts swimming in his head. He carefully rolled Cas off of him, put his swim trunks on, and trudged out to the water’s edge. Maybe an early swim could help. He decided to grab a pair of sweatpants for later, in addition to the dirty underwear he had to clean from last night.
The man pulled out behind him, and Dean involuntarily grimaced. Apart from that, though, he remained still, watching the man pull off his condom, tie it in a knot, and throw it in the waste receptacle just shy of Dean’s face.
Cas gently shut the door behind him, as if he could read Dean’s mind.
The stranger looked at him as if Dean was the crazy one. “We’re making out in the bathroom of a club – what did you expect to happen?”
They drank in silence for a while, before Gabe knocked shoulders with his brother.
Street and about to walk into one of the most notorious clubs on this side of town. His secretary Becky was always telling him to “loosen up, take a night off, and have some fun, Mr. Winchester.” She didn’t specify
“He agreed to the deal. By the time he got to the bottom of the river, though, Phaeton was already dead.”
“Hey Dean? Is that what sex hair looks like? Because everyone keeps telling me I have it.”
“I’ve got you. It’s okay.”
“I know how we could pass the time until it comes back on,” Dean replied as he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
A gust of wind blew the map from Dean’s hands. Dean groaned, watching it dance farther across the lawn as he tried to chase it.
“Duly noted.”
Dean grips Cas’ cock, stroking it and watching it grow in size and stiffness. He thumbs at the slit, causing Cas to throw his head back as pre-cum leaks out. Dean licks at the vee of Cas’ hipbones and sucks marks into his body until they bloom into marvelous colors.
“I’m poison, Cas.”
Benny stuck his hand out. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, brother. Dean talked a lot about you that summer.”
“Dean?” he whispers.
“I promise.” They twisted their pinky fingers together like they did when they were kids.
“And how you kept pushing me and Cas to share a room on hunts, while you got your own? What, you tryin’ to save yourself for marriage or somethin’? Because I think it’s a little too late for that, Sammy. I mean, you and Jess sure looked cozy when I broke into your apartment all those years ago, and you guys weren’t
They continued talking through dinner, and then it was time to go. Michael stood up, addressing the table.
“I need to renew a monthly order of medication.”
Dean and Cas were walking from math class early one morning when Cas looked at his phone for the millionth time. No new Grindr notifications.
The cashier blushed. Cas rolled his eyes as yet another woman fell prey to his boyfriend’s charm.
- - -
“There, now you have my number.”
Cas turned over. Looking at Dean, he brought his friend’s hand up to his mouth and sucked. Cas’ tongue plunged between Dean’s fingers, caressing every inch. Dean’s eyes rolled to the back of his head in pleasure. This might actually be better than any blowjob he’s received from a girl, and Cas wasn’t even touching his dick!
“I said ‘I’m horny, not careless.’”
Dean walked out of the girls’ locker room, tucking his latest pair of stolen panties into his back pocket.
The boys were finally ready to go home. Dean opened the trunk of the car, rummaging around.
“Weird,” he accidentally says out loud.
Cas raises his legs a little more so Dean can line his cock up to Cas’ hole. Cas feels a dull pressure at the base of his entrance, and then Dean breaches him and everything changes. Although Dean only manages to push a little inside at a time, Cas thinks he might be splitting in half with all this stretching. He did not anticipate how big Dean actually was! It doesn’t exactly hurt, but it feels…
, Dean.”
) would enjoy it much more.”
“You think we used too much lubricant, yes? If that were the case, then you’d glide smoothly in and out of me – no resistance or friction. However, there
Dean went off to save his boyfriend from the tiny aliens currently attacking him. Sam decided to start cleaning up the remains of broken balloons on the ground, not wanting to leave a mess.
“Did I forget to refill the toilet paper dispenser?” Cas asked as he walked towards the bathroom. “I could have sworn I did that already.”
Dean raised his hands in surrender. “Okay, fine. Have you tried sitting on a stool or table or even putting books under you to hold it in place?”
“I really fucked it up this time, didn’t I?” Cas said as he scratched his cat behind the ears. It was the time of the month for Cas to order flea medication for the cat, but of course he forgot. It must have slipped his mind somewhere between remembering to pay his various bills on time and making sure the front door was locked when he left the house each morning.
Dean swore that if he didn’t love his boyfriend as much as he already did, he would kill him one of these days…
The pleasure was short-lived, however, as the stranger pushed his hand away and trapped Dean’s cock against his stomach.
“I tried following your instructions, but my hand keeps slipping. I can’t keep my dick in there. Do you have any suggestions?”
“A little too late for that.”
The two of them were incrementally getting louder by the minute and starting to make a scene.
“Come on, old man!” he yelled behind him.
“Do I want to know what’s in your cup, then?”
Dean laughed and his eyes sparkled with amusement. “Oh really? I would have never known.”
Dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Barely containing a smile, Dean said: “We had to take care of some business.”
“So, let me get this straight - or gay, I guess? You’re telling me that I’ve basically been a dumbass this entire time?”
“I did not! That was
He opened his laptop, and within 5 minutes of logging into social media, he received a video call from Cas. However, the view that greeted him was definitely not the typical one.
- - -
Well, that wasn’t ominous at all. A chill went up Dean’s spine, but he swore it was just the wind.
“Are you cold, baby? Because I can make this so much hotter,” Dean says as he latches on to one of Cas’ nipples.
The end of summer was always bittersweet, it seemed. No one liked going back to school, homework, teachers, and days scheduled down to the minute. But at least they could look forward to the annual Sunset and Sunrise party. The premise was simple: the soon-to-be freshman and the graduating seniors would meet on the beach every year the weekend before school started. Watching the sunset symbolized saying goodbye to the past, while waking up and seeing the sunrise symbolized new beginnings. Teachers were present until 9 or 10 at night, but of course they always became tired and went home. That’s when the real party started…
And through it all you'll wonder
A minute later, a second text from her came through his phone:
“I’ll say!”
Looking at the confused faces around him, he decided to make the most of this situation.
“Nah, it was easy.” Dean smiled, slinging one arm around Cas’ shoulder and throwing his other arm out in a big gesture. “Welcome to Kansas University! Come on, I want you to meet some people. Today is the first day of the rest of our lives,” he shouted.
Cas closes his eyes and is almost asleep when he feels a cold stream of liquid hitting his stomach. It is definitely NOT come, of that he is sure. He looks up to see Dean holding two water guns aimed directly at him. In his peripheral vision, Cas spots a bucket filled with water balloons by the door.
Although the cashier attempted to remain unphased, her face was becoming even more red than her hair.
“You know how much I love to participate!” The adorableness of Cas’ pout should be illegal. That, combined with the puppy-eyes that he learned from Sam, was what made Dean ultimately crack.
Cas (well, not his, but more like the Cas that he supposedly felt closer to than anyone else), wanted his help while
- - -
It’s hard being a hunter, but not because of an obvious reason. It’s hard because you have to go find a target. You waste gas, money, time… it’s so much effort. But in Purgatory, the fight comes to you. Need something to kill? Your wish is my command. Before you know it, you’ll be fighting off 5 leviathans and making an ally out of a vampire. They’ll be lining up to get a piece of you. You can kill from sun-up to sun-down, and anywhere in between. There won’t ever be a shortage of what you want, I can guarantee it. A buffet of everything you’ve ever dreamed of as a hunter.
“Maybe next time,” Cas replies. Dean wants to correct him, wants to say there probably won’t be a next time, that this is just two boys experimenting before college demands a better sex life out of them, but he takes one look at Cas’ face and can’t find it in himself to break his best friend’s heart.
They drove in comfortable silence to the restaurant, which was located just outside campus. As they met with the others in the group, Cas strode up to the head of the table.
“I’m Dean,” he said.
“They still haven’t caught on?” the local punk said as he leaned against the flagpole outside the gym. “What is this, the third week now?”
The room still dark, Dean pulled down his pants and separated his ass cheeks a little, being careful of his soreness. Indeed, what he saw gave new meaning to the phrase ‘the sun shines out of his ass.’
- - -
not how tonight – or this morning now? – was supposed to go. Dean sat up, pulling his best friend into his lap and wrapping his balled-up leather jacket tightly around Cas.
With a wink, he let go from the branch and took off in the other direction. Dean would normally go after him, as chasing and hide-or-seek was his favorite type of foreplay, but came up with a better idea.
He finished up in the bathroom before heading to bed. As he was falling asleep, one last text came through.
“Come for me, Cas,” he commanded as he licked the shell of his ear.
“Dean, there’s something you should know. This isn’t a typical event. The guys are going to take you and your date to a nice restaurant, and then they’re going to expect you to ditch and leave your date with the bill. It’s one of their stupid pranks. I’d suggest taking someone that you don’t care about, or someone you don’t see a future with.”
Dean ducked his head, hiding the blush that was now appearing on his cheeks. “It doesn’t hurt to hear it again, though,” he said shyly, looking up at Cas through his eyelashes.
“Smooth, real smooth… Castiel?” Dean looked up from his phone. “That’s a mouthful.”
“Whoa. Slow down there, cowboy. What’s the rush?” Dean asked, still panting. “You have somewhere else you need to be soon?”
Looking around the car, he states: “I need lube… Cas, I don’t have lube.”
While Dean wasn’t as ruthless as the man back at the club, he wasn’t known for long-term relationships. He hated when Jo was right.
Dean ducked his head beneath Cas’ shirt, eager to explore his flat stomach. His hands roamed upwards, caressing Cas’ chest and rolling his nipples between his thumb and forefinger. Cas breathed shallowly, trying to rein in his reactions. Every so often, Dean would hear tiny mewls and gasps of pleasure. Dean smiled, knowing that he was doing at least one thing right. He wanted to distract Cas from his worries. Dean also knew that Cas would be worn out from this, so sleep would come easily to them both. No one had to know that Dean himself was enjoying this, too. He squeezed his growing bulge in an attempt to delay the inevitable.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, fighting a blush. “Yeah, well…what did Cygnus decide?”
“They’ll be clamoring for your attention – “
Castiel sighs at the unfamiliar feeling of being safe. He sighs at the feeling of being wanted and cherished. He sighs the idea that he possesses a capability for a love so great it astounds him. He sighs, knowing his love is returned. Without even needing to look at Dean, he knows it to be true.
Without another word, Dean walked up to the bed and climbed behind Cas, putting a hand on his back. Dean could have imagined it, but he thought Cas might have mewled at the contact.
After a few strokes, he stupidly opened his mouth to finally introduce himself. Better late than never, right?
It wasn’t that Charlie didn’t know what happened to Cas, but she had a different relationship to him and Dean typically wasn’t one to discuss his feelings. People thought he had moved on. Dean was good at convincing everyone, including himself. And then out of the blue, something like this would shatter his carefully-constructed wall that he kept things like this behind. It would hit him like a freight train at full speed, and yet… he’d willingly step in front of that train and go through the pain if it meant he could relive these memories and hold on to Cas for a little longer. Dean could feel him slipping away, and the more Dean chased after him, the farther away he seemed.
“Let’s work up to that, yeah?” The man patted Dean’s cheek. “Don’t want to overwhelm the newbie. You might run away and never come back.”
“Hm?”
Dean stood up quickly. “I appreciate your offer, but I’m straight.” He wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince more – himself or this stranger that he was drawn to.
Neither one could hide their smiles.
Who was Sam to disagree with the logic of a kid? Instead, he replied: “Did you have fun today?”
“Benny told me I missed Student Orientation earlier today. Any idea how that could happen, Mr. Tour Guide?”
A few minutes later, Sam felt a tug on his shirt sleeve. He looked up to find a small girl staring back at him. She couldn’t have been older than 4 or 5 years.
The man patted Dean’s cheek. “Good boy.”
Cas sighed, holding Sam’s hand for the third time. Both of their palms were slick with sweat.
“Oh man! What happened? Did he die?”
“Isn’t speed related to friction? Didn’t we learn that sometime this year in physics class? Maybe we used too much lube.”
“The cups. Blue is for people that like to top, green is for people who like to bottom, and orange is for people who are versatile. Makes it so much easier. Anyway, I’ll see ya later!”
“Hey!” Dean shouted a little too loudly. He wasn’t actually angry, but he wanted to show this guy who was in charge. He could hear the guy's friends say something like “ooh, you’re in trouble!” before disappearing into the crowd, leaving the guy behind. To be honest, the man was unjustly attractive in his solid gold spandex booty shorts that complemented his tan and hugged his tight ass. Oh, if only Dean could get his hands on those mounds.
“Sam and I were worried about you last night.”
“Ready?”
And then it happened. A head popped up with hair that looked eerily similar to Cas’, producing one syllable he was conditioned to respond to.
, he thought “- summer we were apart.”
The two of them had been fighting for what seemed like hours on an age-old topic. Cas wanted Dean and Dean wanted Cas, but Dean didn’t think he deserved such a wonderful angel. He would only pull Cas into his web of chaos and destruction. It’s what always happened, and always will.
Cas reached for Dean’s other hand, putting it in between his legs.
His reply?
“See? I’m doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!”
He knew as soon as his mouth closed around Cas’ dick, that even a whole lifetime wouldn’t be long enough to enjoy it. Dean groaned, sending vibrations up Cas’ body. He could feel Cas’ fingers run through his short hair as Dean pulled the cock deeper and deeper into his mouth. When Dean swallowed around it, he could swear Cas threw his head back in pleasure. This caused a whole-body chain reaction: Cas arched upwards, sending his hips thrusting forward. If it weren’t for Dean’s strong hold, he would have choked. Dean pulled back, lapping at the tip and tonguing Cas’ slit. With each taste of Cas’ pre-come, more dribbled out. Dean greedily drank it all, begging for another drop to quench his thirst.
“Michael.”

Charlie finally jumped on top of the table with the phone, reading aloud: "
“I don’t think that would be a good idea, Cas.”
“Are you sure, Cas?”
“It is here.”
As promised, a knock on Dean’s door arrived just on time. Opening it, he was taken aback by how nice his friend looked.
“It’s too hot to have sex, Dean. My body feels like it’s on fire.”
Sam shook his head in disbelief. “I’m seriously starting to doubt your previous statement that we are indeed related. No brother of mine could be this focused on one activity.”
As Dean turned the corner and walked down the street, he pulled his leather jacket a bit closer and checked to see if anyone was following him. Although he was headed for the club, he hardly wanted to draw attention. He hoped his jeans, t-shirt, and flannel were inconspicuous enough.
“I was right!”
Cas rolled his eyes at his friend’s childish behavior. “Yes, Dean. You were right.”
There once was a man that claimed he was a healer. He had everyone fooled – everyone except me. The queen of Russia kept him close as her personal advisor, and the ladies fell under his spell as well. He loved being in the limelight, but soon the fifteen minutes of fame would be over. Even
“So, who’s the lucky victim tonight, Cassie?” Gabe said as they stood in the kitchen, surveying the crowd. There was always a good turn out, but first-of-the-year parties were his favorite.
“You’re welcome.”
“And when exactly would that be? We spend every waking minute with each other, Dean! To be honest, I’m getting kind of sick of you.”
“Oh, I intend to.”
“Give me a minute. I might have one in my wallet somewhere,” Dean says as he fishes through his pants pocket and thankfully finds a small foil square. He squints at the expiration date and checks for holes.
"Actually," Sam cut in, pausing at the counter, "I was going to take Eileen out for dinner tonight."
Dean buried his face in his hands as a sob wracked through his body. He couldn't believe it. Any of it. Cas had made a deal without telling him. Hadn't they been through this enough already? Didn't he know how it would end? But Dean couldn't even make himself be mad about it, couldn't twist this sadness into rage.
This was the only chance he was going to get now.
"You don't hunt," Jody cut in, "and you weren't there."
"Hello Dean," Cas whispered into Dean's ear.
"Cas, buddy, it's me. It's Dean." Castiel marched forward, he had a mission, orders that had to be followed. Castiel shoved Dean up against the wall, his forearm pressed against Dean's chest as he held his knife to Dean's throat. Dean swallowed, looking Castiel straight in the eyes. "Cas, please." He grabbed Castiel's shoulder,
He opened his eyes to darkness.
that Claire managed to decapitate four vamps with one machete swing.
They ran away before anyone could stop them.
Dean backed up slowly, holding his hands up as he tried to reason with Castiel.
"'morning," he said, pressing a kiss to Dean's cheek.
"It's true," Kaia said, "saw it myself."
"'ome back to bed," Cas muttered, reaching one hand blindly out to where dean lay a minute before. Dean hesitated for a second before grabbing Cas's hand and squeezing it once before letting go. Cas didn't seem to notice his hesitation, grabbing the remaining blankets and pulling them over his shoulder and burying himself in them.
Dean felt another kiss to the back of his neck as Cas settled against him. "Goodnight, Dean."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean didn't understand a lot of sign language, but he more than understood the look on Eileen's face as she watched Sam carrying the bags around. That girl was going to eat him alive.
Look, I actually wrote a second chapter. Yes, there is actually a town in Michigan called Hell and it is a few hours away from where I live. Yes, it is fucking cold there.
down for this. Dean loved morning sex, always had, and morning sex with Cas was always something worth waking up for. Cas pushed down Dean's sweatpants, wrapping one hand around his dick as he began to grind against him and
He waved at them, and then he was gone. Sam and Eileen dispersed back into the kitchen to finish what was left of the food and start cleaning up. Cas hovered at Dean's side, staring into the space where Jack had been.
Fuck he was an idiot. They both were. Always dancing around it- this thing between them. Always saying it however they could without daring to actually cross that line. Dean should have done something. He should have said it in purgatory when Cas stopped him, should have told Cas to "let him speak god dammit" and get the damn words out in the open. He should have said it before then, when Cas came back from The Empty the first time, should have told him that he loved him and missed him and to never do that again because Dean didn't think he could handle losing Cas one more time. He should have said it when he gave Cas the mixtape with his heart inside it. He should have said it when Dean had thought that killing Amara would be a suicide mission. He should have said it when he found Cas on the side of the road after believing for so long that he'd left Cas in purgatory to die.
Dean lunged at him with a knife, the glint of the angel blade in his hands was almost as cold as the light in his eyes as he swung at Castiel. He dodged it easily, stepping back as Dean stumbled past him. This Dean wasn't nearly as good a fighter as the real one, they had gotten that bit wrong, and it served as a reminder to Castiel that this wasn't really Dean. But like the real Dean, this one turned around and lunged at him again. Castiel grabbed Dean's wrist as he swung, easily taking the blade from his hand and throwing it to the other side of the room. Once again, Dean didn't say anything as he stared at Castiel, his face frozen in a familiar expression of rage. Dean exhaled sharply, and Castiel thought he would stand down, but instead he twisted sharply, trying to get out of Castiel's grasp. Instead, Castiel used the momentum to jerk Dean back, pulling Dean's back against his chest as he held his own blade to Dean's throat. Dean struggled against him, trying to escape, but Castiel was stronger.
"Castiel," she said, breaking the tense silence that had fallen between them. "You are a good soldier, a warrior of God." She stepped closer, the click of her heels echoing against the concrete. "But you have forgotten your mission, your truth."
"Dreamwalker."
"Dean!"
The two of them fell into a comfortable rhythm as Dean showed her everything in their impressive (though admittedly outdated) kitchen. They were good like that together, throwing in a few jokes or stories to pass the time, but ultimately enjoying each other's company.
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, maybe not the best idea there."
Dean. But it was Dean's laugh and Dean's smile and Dean's hands that were holding on to him and weren't letting go. It wasn't Dean, but it was close enough. Castiel stepped forward so that they were chest to chest, bringing his hands up to cup Dean's face and pull him into a kiss. It was rough and messy and desperate and it wasn't how Castiel had ever imagined kissing Dean, but if nothing here was real then he could at least have this, a moment of happiness to match however much longer he would be trapped here. He ran his hands through Dean's hair, and he felt Dean's hands settle on his hips and Castiel knew this couldn't last but he also wouldn't stop because he knew that any minute now-
