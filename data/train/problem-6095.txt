“Let me read you this pile of names, Cathy Dale, Janice Cord, Gretl Anders, Dr.SuYin, Whitney Frost, Bethany Cabe... Either they die for you or lose everything because of love for you."
It's my fault. I was so careless. All I wanted to do was run out of the house. I knocked over the last bottle of wine on the table. It's hard to get wine now. He is forced to stay at home to take care of me, and I’m always annoying him. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I deserve it. I deserve it. I deserve the whip.
Steve's right hand slowly raised, swept Tony’s hair lightly, slid along his face angle to ear, then supported his face with palm. His blue eyes were fixed on Tony's. His other hand’s thumb gently wiped the tears from Tony's eye, ran across his cheek, ran across his labial angle, stopped between his lips, rubbing them around.
"How about... Why don't you owe me a favor today?" Bain said.
He only wished that the punishment would begin soon. Because waiting for punishment scares him more than the punishment itself. Every minute seemed like a century.
A building next to the Baxter Building, New York City. A few days later, at night.
"You've let me down. I tried my best to devote myself to getting him out of the room, but you got nothing. "Bain said coldly.
"Don't follow me..." Iron Man shouted before flying out.
"I know, Tony."
He grabbed Tony, hugged him from behind, through his waist, stroked him.
"So I said it."
"It's urgent and I can't wait for you to put on your armor again. But since you remember the causes and effects of the creation of this earth, I don't need to explain them to you all over again."
"It was like the last straw broke the camel's back. He gave Roddy the Armor and Iron Man title, and ran away. Nobody knew where he'd gone. If he didn't want to be found, no one could find him. His friends gradually gave up the search, and returned to their own lives.
"Probably thousands of times."
"It would be nice if that handsome black-haired boy could come." Said Hellcat.
"Tony Stark?!"
"If the stolen armor design could be retrieved today, it would be helpful to build it."
"I'll find you."
"So you only came back because Tasha called?"
"Tony."
"Did they already know?" Tony asked Steve quietly.
"Good night, Kris." Tony said.
"What do you mean 'again'!"
“Tony, can I have a word with you in private?"Steve put his hand on the Iron Man's shoulder.
"Okay, I'll bring it in."
"I have taken your advice and moved the headquarters of Carbonell Industries to New York City, then took my wife and daughter to our house in Southampton. It's been a busy time, but we have settled down now. Thanks to you, the Cabonells survived the Depression."
"Either of mine."
"It was horrible, it was raining all the time, my bones were drenched, I felt like I was going to be next door to Namor."
"You'd better come back soon. The Old Man can't run any longer."
It would be a two-story cabin with a fire in winter and an old ceiling fan in summer. The walls are covered with yellow photos and my paintings... My children, my wife, the countryside... The children's toys were scattered all over the house, tripping Peggy and me. Peggy's face would have wrinkles, her hair would be dyed with silver gradually, but she is still beautiful. Because of housework and children, her temper might be a little bad. Sometimes she might teach these little bad kids a lesson, then they would hide behind me, seek refuge. I must soothe their angry mother.
"Got it. I'll take it as the old version 3.8."
"Thank you for your speech, Cap." Tony said.
"In fact, I am also short of money. I launched a project in Silicon Valley, currently seeking investors. A lot of investors are interested in it, calling me. But as you know, I am busy, and this matter has been delayed."
"I don't believe it."
"I'm talking about that British girlfriend of yours, Megan? DeGann? Yep, Kris DeGann."
"Avenger business, thank you for your cooperation. I need to use your computer." In fact, everyone in the restaurant had already hidden under the table, no one stopped him using anything.
"Mr. Carbonell, there's a Mr. Krats at the door who wants to see you. He said he has an investment plan for your steel plant."
"But he looks like a bunch of upside down buckets put together. He's ugly."
“Yes, they're Irish heathens! "said another little boy with dark curly hair.
"It is true as you say." Peter grinned. "What do you find out? What's Doctor Octopus up to on that island?"
"And not only that, you interfered in that street fight."
"Gea.(Yes.)" Thor said.
"What about me?" Peter interjected.
"I know."
He took off his bloody clothes, bathed him, dried his body and the water from his hair. He dressed him in some pyjamas, carefully buttoning up every button. Then he carried him to a room full of his paintings. He put him to bed and tucked him in. All the while, Steve never took his eyes off him.
"You misunderstood me. I meant that no one other than me would bother you." Said Bain, closing the door of the room.
Steve caught the bag, his anger gone, a smile on his lips.
The Vault, Colorado. Before dawn the next day.
"That's what I am going to ask you. Why only you? Where's the Hawkeye?" Steve said.
Kris's brother has a thick Yorkshire accent. Kris jumped out of the carriage and gave him a big hug.
"Or we should rush out, look him in the eyes and say. ‘We are not at all wrong’. If he hits you, we'll fight back. There are two of us." Bucky said, shaking his fist.
"I'm so sorry, Captain, it was all a misunderstanding." The chief shook Steve's hand.
"We've always been a family, Jane, always. We will always come back even if we get lost. "Steve said emotionally.
"Yes, I had trained him. But he asked for it, and the training had saved his life many times."
"Just call me Tony." Tony held out his hand enthusiastically to shake, but found that both Sebastian's hands were full. Tony had to pull his hand back.
"Isn’t it?"
Tony looked around. Most of X-Men were already in a cold sweat. Many were shaking.
At this time, Steve's attention was focused on the crew entering. Thor was still on alert for attacks from the air. No one noticed that Tony was slowly falling down... Until Giant Man jumped in.
"All right, the party's on. Spider-Man, if it's no trouble, music, thanks. Let's dance."
"Oh yeah!" The children cheered.
"Tasha, you didn't have to do this, you did a good job, you were a great chief." Steve said with a slight surprise.
"Believe me, there's no one who doesn't make mistakes, no matter how old they are."
Before following the doctor into the ward, Tony looked back at Steve again.
You were flying a knife. I didn't have to duck, because I knew you had an order not to kill Tony Stark. You were trying to poison Kris, but when you found out it was me; You freak out. So, you asked me that question immediately just to make sure I'm not going to die."
"Okay, now that you have cooked."
"But you like it, don't you? You like me to be mad, don't you?" Tony said at the end of the kiss.
"Yeah, it is a little unusual. It is still raining at this time of year." Kris said.
"Does that make him sad?"
Steve said, throwing the shield out and heading for the weak spot where Iron Man's elbow was connected. Tony leaned out of the way. But Steve's trick was a sham. The shield was just trying to get his opponent's attention, which was his usual tactic. In fact, he had already gone around the back of Iron Man, kicked hard at the right knee of the armor. This time Iron Man didn't get out of the way and was kicked straight. Tony lost balance, lurched forward two steps. Before he could control his balance, Steve, who had caught the shield, raised it and hit the Iron Man's left knee. The joint is always the weak point of the armor, and if hit this time, the armor will be damaged at least 30% more. It was too late for Tony to duck, so he fired his jet boots. The armor crashed into the trees. Trees were smashed into each other, but the impact of the armor was lessened; Iron Man fell to the ground hard.
"But it can save your life. Fortunately, he gave us the implant before he died, or else we didn't even know how to save you. And he saved you again today, saved us again."
"Wow! Oh!" Peter's cheers drowned Tony's words. Peter was instantly transformed into Iron Spider-Man.
He sneaked a smile on his shoulder.
Tony stared at her enchanting figure. Her white slender thighs, with red high-heeled shoes, stepped on the floor and issued "dada" sounds. Her round hips wrapped in a short skirt swayed gently up and down to the rhythm of her steps. It was obvious that the slow walk was a mild torment as he imagined the landscape beneath her skirt, which made his body agitate. Finally, Bain opened the door to the mainframe room.
"If you want me to follow, just say it directly. I'm not you, I'm so honest. If I were serious, didn't follow, what would you do now?" Steve punched the Spymaster’s face. The Spymaster wiped the blood from his own mouth, and stared hard at Steve. But Steve was clearly not paying much attention to him.
"Right! And you were so reckless!”
"Nothing. Same old, same old. To do some scientific research in outer space." Tony answered with a shrug.
They were taken to the chief's office. The chief lowered the blinds, stepped forward, personally uncuffed Steve and Tony.
Too bad, Aha? Last time I nearly killed Meredith. This time the victim was Kris. How many such mistakes I made before I can recognize the fact that I am not him at all, and I will never be him. Because I am far behind him, I'm not a hero. I simply don't deserve Iron Man, don't deserve the Avengers. I am just a dazed, confused, conceit, arrogance, selfish bastard!"
All the mutants present joined in making this container. Several lights appeared in midair, creating a shield over Central Park. At the same time, a silver light glowed from the machine Tony was operating, throwing into the vortex of space-time turbulence.
"What's the result of your analysis?" Tony, a scientist, is clearly interested too, so he pressed on.
"Are you in good captain didactic mode again?"
"Hey! Would you two guys please consider a serious fight with me?" Ignored for a long time, Frostbite raged. An ice storm swept them.
"He broke into the school and destroyed many parts of the teaching equipment. We simply don't have enough money to rebuild it. The surrounding children will have to go to another school 10 kilometers away."
"Going to D.C. with Tony to deal with some private matters, being held up by the local police, etc."
"Barring any accidents, we should be in New York in two hours."
Kris, I really haven't thought about her in a while. Tony added in the memo: "Date Kris, priority 3."
"Well, Dr. Octopus, thank you for your help." Tony said and turned to leave.
The man with the flowers stretched out a hand, wrote on the visitor's register: Rand Flowers and Gifts Shop.
"Er... So that means I'm grounded?" Tony said a bit frustrated.
"My sonic attacks can only temporarily dissociate him and contain him, but soon the electrostatic particles still accumulate, which is not the ultimate solution." Tony said.
"Scare you? because I didn't even coma."
"Look out! "Tony clutched Steve, flashed brush. "I've saved your life again. Hehe."
Tony was not angry, but rather amused. He stopped Steve, and stepped forward.
"Hulk, smash!" The Hulk shouted.
"Are we back in communication now?"
"Well... It's nothing." Said Spider-man shyly.
"Trust me, sometimes it's better if you don't answer, just say Avengers’ secret mission." Tony tried to calm down.
Tony 19
Kris DeGann, Level A Contact: Tony, you haven't been to Univ in a long tiTony 19
Tony was busy with his college life, with lots of courses, experiments and inventions. He sold several patents to get some money, to create a digital technology company. Like all the tech nineties in the IT industry, he yearned for California's Silicon Valley in this era of the boom, which made him more certain that he would not go on to become a weapons-maker, definitely not become ‘him’.
"Tony?!"
"Good heavens, Mr. Carbonell, what's happened?!"
"Tony, are you over thinking again?"
"Old Man can't pilot."
“I don't know if Tony Stark's henchmen are protecting me or hurting me. They treated me like a little kid, trying to protect me from That-Tony's world, from his enemies, from his network, from his empire, from everything he stood for. But belong to his past constantly looking for me.
"Oh, well done!" Steve stood up and clapped.
"Do you want to talk?" Steve was used to the rambling nature of Tony's ideas.
Tony did not retort. He suppressed the emotion that was surging inside him at Doom's words and made fun of it.
"It has been restored. I've contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. They'll send someone to take the mercenaries and Zodiac agents. The Quinjet that Hawkeye and Spider-Man drove was too damaged to be repaired. For a few repairs, the Jet Cap and I piloted should be used. We can go home soon. I'm going to fly over and fix it now."
He was trembling with anger. He was angry. He swung his fist as hard as he could at the boy in the cap. He hit the boy, but he didn't pose any threat.
"Tony..."
Tony's hand froze in the air. Hawkeye laughed, and went into the vortex.
New York City, 2:35 a.m.
Tony stared at the card, wishing his eyes could shoot a flame and burn out the card. Damn ‘superhero daily’. Tony thought angrily.
"You like it?! That... Too good. I can draw more for you, I..."
"What if I say 'no'? I said the plan would be bet..."
"Thanks for understanding, Tasha." Tony said.
"I didn't ask you for hot chocolate."
"Yes, Captain. I have executed all your commands, then thought you should need a hand."
Once again, Steve was on his motorcycle, searching the streets of New York, this time totally aimlessly... Finally, he stopped in Central Park, parked his motorcycle in the same spot. Then he sat on a bench, staring at the lawn. The lawn they had battered was now restored, but lifeless in the bleak wind. A feeling of powerlessness came over Steve.
“What?”
"I don't want to calm down. At this time, you told me to calm down?! Who wasn't calm at first? You may think everyone has a switch, just like you, to quickly switch between cool and not cool."
"What? !"
"This is a dimension of space outside of all time and space. I am not really here. I am only speaking to you through the Forever Crystal."
"Let them in! Then let's take down the Zodiac base!" Steve decided.
Tasha followed.
Steve held Tony in his arms, ran his fingers through Tony's hair, which had grown a little too long to cover his ears. Steve smoothed down his curly hair.
Steve sat by the fire polishing his shield, which he had done dozens of times. From time to time, he stole a glance at Tony beside him. Tony's mind was clearly fixed on repairing his armor. His face was orange in the firelight. Squinting his eyes, he pulled one tool after another from a small box spread out beside him.
Christmas Eve, Avengers Mansion, New York City, USA.
"I didn't own it. All I did was bypass its protective device, got into the system, exploited a flaw in the system, operated it."
"You could say the Avengers evacuated Tony and Peter to some other safe place, and then we could come back later."
"This is wilderness survival training. You can't bring any technology." Steve made an announcement before his departure.
"Black Widow, may I speak to you privately, if it is convenient?" Tony said.
The screen switched to the local hospital in the Yorkshire Dales.
“Fire!”
"Did he fly back?"
"What?! Are you really on his side?"
A red ray from the chest of the silver-barrel-monster struck the shield and sent sparks.
There's no time for an antidote, and there's only one filter...
"I knew it." Kris said.
"I don't want to... Don't want to... I don't want to date other girls for now."
"Rubbish! Don't insult my mother!"
"But you..."
"I knew, I should never have joined this organization."
"Isn't that the kind of secret a good friend should share? I always wanted to tell you afterwards, but one thing led to another. I had no chance, so have you forgiven me?"
Tony's Longest Day 04
"Ridiculous! Do you think you've solved the problem by beating it up? I had solved it, of course, had no intention of fighting with you Avengers. I immediately led the gang out of New York."
Tony 19
"Dani! "Seth shouted. "Dani..."
The moment he lay next to Steve, Steve immediately hugged him and buried his head in his chest. He rubbed his hair, which was still wet, and began to tell the story.
"Yeah, it was at the end of my life, or at least I thought it would be the end of my life. All I could think of at that moment was him. But he was not with me at that moment. There were so many things I regretted, so many things I wanted to tell him, but I could never say them... But God gave me a second chance. I didn't die. Sharon made a deal with Red Skull, and saved me. When I solved the Red Skull thing, I went to find him, and found that he was no longer himself. I traveled to 10 years ago, found you, wanted to stop him, save him, let you wake him up... But everything was too late, he finally died in my arms. And you know the rest."
Over the Atlantic Ocean, Iron Man was flying, holding Spider-Man's arms. Peter's eyes were tightly closed.
"Do you need to ask Bucky to accompany you?”
The door opened, Tony slipped in, relieved.
Krats opened his suitcase. In half an hour, Carbonell was shocked. He had never seen anything like this in his life.
"What are your recommendations for the general public?"
"But very few people know who today’s Iron Man is". Jane said.
"I know."
"I see. You take risks every day. I'm almost used to them. Tell me what it is. I'll follow you." Steve replied.
"So, during this period, I finally cleaned up the things you left in my room. It is now much tidier."
"Neither of mine. Now Tasha is leading the team. And she's deciding who to call."
The crowd on the ground floor was a mess. The flames and smoke were drifting up to the second floor. Tony's head began to clear a little. He realized what had happened. By the way, where is my backpack? He had too much drink yesterday, and they had poured him a few more bottles just now. He had forgotten all about the backpack. Where is the backpack? Right, he left the backpack in the car. Sure enough, I am a rookie superhero, and once again forgot to take my armor with me. I have to find my backpack, put on my armor where no one is looking.
"How long have we been flying?"
Tony got in his flashy red sports car, bought a bunch of flowers, prepared to pick Kris up for the art exhibition. When he parked the car downstairs in Kris's dormitory, took off his sunglasses, it caused sighs and onlookers. Lots of girls walked up to his car and gave him their phone numbers.
"So, you didn't lie to her."
"Oh, My World! You are absolutely a primitive, boring, backward, completely out of time man. By the way, shouldn't we be enjoying some delicate moment in the first sneaky taste or second, or whatever?
The Electro behind Tony staggered to his feet. Steve without looking, flew out of his shield, knocked him unconscious again. Then they continue to kiss each other.
“I'm sorry, Tony." Kris said with emotion.
"It’s time to... Avengers... HMM..."
"It's eight o 'clock in the evening. Dinner's ready."
"Thanks, Tasha." Steve was honest.
Steve didn't watch out. It hit him directly. Liquid poured over him.
"What's the difference?"
"Let's call it a day. You have college classes tomorrow." Steve said.
"How do you know if he's a good guy or a bad guy at the beginning of the story?"
Under Frostbite's fierce attacks, Steve's options were limited. He wants to delay until the other Avengers return to support him.
Really transforming to this, rather than a hard hologram, is a small compensation for the brain being directly connected to Libra once in a while. The night is long. It's so far into the '30s that it's finally time to go have some fun. The famous Hellfire Club. That-Tony was a regular. I'd love to see it in the '30s.
Stark's bodyguard came, Japanese couldn’t be far -- Financial Times
"Aha, that's right, school lesson?" Steve continued to follow Tony.
“Is that your New Year's wishes, Tony?
"Cap, you're so..." Wanda's eyes widened in surprise.
"I've been to see Doctor Octopus, Peter." Tony said.
"Nope, he can't."
"As I expected." Steve said.
me. Your friends all worried about you. I'm worried about you. I haven't thanked you for last time. Maybe we can go out together when you are free. As a thank you, let me buy you a drink or a dinner.
"Well, I know she's a pretty, lovely girl, but I..." Peter said.
"Fags, you are too arrogant." Said the leader.
“Besides, we're not all lost tonight, and I think I found something very funny, very-very funny." Bain said with a narrowed smile.
"Now it is the right time. It's good to have so many people. As soon as possible, no excuses, no delays. "Tony replied.
“Stupid woman! Let me go!"
Peter touched her head and said, "It looks like you're the only one who wants to be with me tonight."
Tony had no reason to refuse the warm invitation of such a beautiful girl, and he did not want to, so he followed Kris upstairs to her room.
"I don't know, I don't feel him. I just know that with you by my side, I'm not so scared. Will you stay this time? I mean, are you coming to see me again soon? I understand... You live far away and you're busy... I do hope you'll come and see me more often. Or you can tell me where you live and I'll go and see you." Steve's voice trailed off until he dropped his head and ceased talking.
"Captain, if it's convenient for you, please sign for my son. He adores you." Said the policeman nearby.
"I'm sorry." Peter folded up his armor. Then he hugged Tony again. "Thanks, Tony, I don't know, I don't know what to say..."
After that, Tony wanted to get up. But, Steve, who was pressing on him, seemed to have no intention of moving. The damaged armor is also a bit heavy. Tony can’t get up.
"That's impossible. Otherwise, he couldn't have ambushed us at the exact time and place. Baseball tickets. Did you buy them with your name?"
"Shh." Steve grabbed him, motioned him to shut up.
Everything went according to plan. The invisible armor eluded their monitors and infrared scanning systems. On the 65th floor, Tony found the mainframe, plugged into his armor system, hacked it in, skipped the Jocasta project, the Detroit Steele, the Pegasus... He found Stark's designs. Delete, simple. Wait a minute, there's a source, on the 77th floor. They have a backup. Tony could only go on to the 77th floor.
"If I could drink alcohol at the party," Tony replied in a low voice.
"Jarvis, finally, you came." Tony began to cry. "You warned me... You all reminded me of that... I shouldn't have been drinking... But I think you're all overreacting. I did it recklessly. I think I can control it, but I can't... I'm absolutely a bad seed. I'm him. No, I'm not him. I'm worse than him. Don't wait until 29, don't need Kang's corruption. I'm a murderer now..."
Steve looked up at Bucky.
A mob of masked men with baseball bats darted through the surrounding trees, blocking Steve and Tony's path.
"What are you drawing? It's so ugly." A sweet female voice, like the cry of a canary. The sound came up in Steve's dreams so many times. He looked up in disbelief. His face was flushed, and his tongue was tied as before.
Steve kissed Tony again.
"Believe it or not, the reason I'm here so late today is because I received feedback from the security services. Bain's mainframe system had been hacked in the early hours of yesterday morning. The intruder was very careful, an expert, coming and going without a trace, the camera had no record, and our alarm system did not detect any malicious programs. Until you tampered with it tonight, they realized there was a trace of the program being implanted. The program is harmless to the system itself, but it emits a signal of a certain frequency. Because the signal was blocked by the building's interference, it was not immediately noticed. I also hurried over after being told of this. And would I leave it in an unprotected drawer so obviously?"
Tony thought carefully.
Wanda came, sat down next to Tasha. She wore a long red frock, narrow and strapless, with her long curls pulled back from her red headband.
A dilapidated house in Brooklyn, New York City, 1930.
"I can fly!"Peter went straight to the top of the building, and then he fell. "Ah... Ah..."
Not long after that, in the middle of the night, his father woke Steve from his sleep by shouting abuse. He was afraid. Indeed, he was always afraid when he heard his father's voice, and he was even more afraid when he was angry. He didn't know if he was annoying him again. He got out of bed and hid in the closet as usual. He curled up, covered his ears, prayed that he would hurry away, that it would be over.
Doctor Octopus waved at Steve with his robotic claws, and a lot of green smoke came out of his paws. Green smoke burst into the laboratory immediately, floated in front of Tony.
"Aha! At Dr. Octopus's lab, I almost lost my life trying to save you."
Tony 19
"They can."
"What were you doing on that island in the Atlantic Ocean if your experiment was based in New York City?"
"Nothing."
"Good morning everyone. I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm just a lost tourist."
"I did sign it on my behalf, but it was voted on by the resident superheroes. Special peacekeeping members were also elected by voting." Steve spoke slowly.
"This is real, Wanda. It is real."
"It looks like I have to change the head of our security department again. The peripheral security system is useless."
"What's going on?" Tony finally asked.
"Time is a living organism, which may be likened to a plant. So it needs to take down roots and get enough nutrients to grow and be strong. You need to create that initial environment for it."
"Tony! You liar! Tasha can locate us."
“Are you going back on your words? Doom."
Steve sighed again.
"You guessed it? You guessed that I'm afraid your identity will be exposed, cause a scandal?”
"Spymaster thing has been settled, I'm not busy... And now?"
"I... You know, I’m really not... Since my father lost his job, he's been a little... Easy to get angry. He used to be kind. This is where he used to take me fishing. The warehouse next door is where he used to work. He took me to baseball games too... The factory shut down last year and my father lost his job. My mother had to go out to work. They prefer to hire a woman because they pay her half as much, so she can only do two jobs. I almost can’t see her all day... I don't have any friends. They say I... You've heard what they said today."
"No, I mean..." Paige still didn't look at Steve’s eyes. "They knew. They knew about me sneaking back from school with you and going into the toy shop. They all say it's not good for me. They say you are strange, your family are pagans, and the Puritans aren't supposed to hang out with pagans."
If only Bucky is here right now, sitting opposite me, he would say to me, "the monster just has a scary shell...", "You can't hide in a closet all your life..."
"I think you've got the wrong person. I'm an exchange student from London." Kris bowed her head in embarrassment. She thought, when I bail him out, I would kill this bastard.
"Nonsense, it's noisy but warm here. It feels like home. I appreciate you inviting me and my friend Peter." Tony came to himself. He kissed Kris on her cheek and soothed her.
"A child under five years of age? !"Tony was surprised.
"Bucky, you played a prank again." Said the blond-haired child.
"Well, at least let's go into a large open place."
"I know... But my friends can't understand... I don't want to be weird, at least not the way they see me... They are my friends and I don't want to lose them. So, this will be the last time I see you privately. I'm sorry, Steve, I'm so sorry..."
"Could you tell a story about Iron Man and Captain America?"
"Hide! Be careful of your behind! Don't leave my sight!"
His hand was seized again by the brown-haired boy, and he began to run with him.
"Don't move anything. Turn off the light. Have you heard of me? Don't touch anything, don't tell anyone, don't open the door for anyone. I'll be right there. When I get there, I'll manage."
"Has he wings?”
The man who had been helpless and vulnerable vanished, became a reliable leader again. Perhaps the best cure for him is fighting. Maybe Tony is the same.
"Well, I seem to have misunderstood you." Pretending not to notice, Tony bent his head and quietly typed in the security code.
"Something like that. I thought you always wanted to be a father."
Steve was standing next to the fire hydrant. He split it open with his shield. A large amount of water gushed out. Then he used his shield to adjust the direction of the spray, directly into Electro. Electro short-circuited by the water, emitting a sizzling sound, falling to the ground.
But the consolation didn't work. Against the brilliance of Captain America, Tony felt more and more gloomy and small.
"Welcome home, Tony." Jane shed tears and hugged Tony for a long time. "When are you moving back?"
"You see, he was a famous playboy, who people on the fringe like me read about him every day in the papers. In the social, financial, tech, and entertainment sections. He was the target of big or tabloid reporters."
“Tony, is that you?”
"Oh my God, you can be invisible. You made invisible armor. I want that in my future armor."
Tony looked at himself in the mirror, seemed to look sloppy. He touched a layer of stubble that had grown above his lips.
"Got it."
"Margaret Carter, but I prefer to be called Peggy."
"Wait a minute, but how was this Earth created?"
Usually crowded lively houses now seem a little empty, the others have not come back, a rare holiday, they are enjoying a day outside like ordinary people. He and Jarvis were left alone in the house. By this time Jarvis had gone to bed. Works every day for the Avengers. He needs a vacation, too. So, Steve tiptoed across the hall to the kitchen, and got himself a drink. He sat down on a chair in the living room, looked around at the pictures of the past, his mind drifting away again. And just as he was half-asleep, the phone rang wildly. The living room clock struck two. This is a daily contact phone, and the only person who answers it is Jarvis. The Avengers has a special contact channel, so it's not an emergency. Steve really couldn’t think of anyone who needed Jarvis at 2 am, but he didn't want to wake him up, so he answered the phone.
With those words, Tony appeared at the door, pulling Spiderman.
"Clint..." Tasha gave Hawkeye a quiet poke with her elbow.
"Okay, I'll start cleaning tomorrow. Now, will you begin the story of the Barrel Monster?"
"Since I came here by your time machine, I can only find you and return as I was." Tony put stress on the words "as I was".
"Is there anyone here?" He shouted.
Chapter 24
Oh, My World! I put her in the middle of a pile of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen tanks! He flew into the attic immediately, but it all happened so fast... A loud bang, the whole attic exploded.
"You know what, Pete?"
"I’d be happy to give you a crash course in the defense arts, Mr. Stark."
Tony got off the line and came over to Peter. "Peter, good news or bad news?"
"Come on, what's the hurry, looks like you run full of energy."
"Yes, back then we were just close friends. In order to make up for my mistake, I didn’t give up searching. It was a very cold winter in New York City. It was snowing heavily that day. On such a blizzard night, I was very worried about him, so I drove my motorcycle to every tavern in the city... When I finally found him, he passed out in a dark alley wearing a single coat. I picked him up, took him back to the Avengers Mansion. He was shaking in my arms all the time. I put him on the bed, covered him with a quilt. He was still shaking, pulled me, begged me not to leave. So, I stayed..."
"Well, think about it. I don't want to get beat up by Cap again."
‘Wait a minute, if I call you directly through my brain, can you get it? For example: Oh, Libra, can you pop into my head quickly and fulfill all my needs? I need to transform, I need to teleport, I need to eat ice cream.
It's easy. The armor is on my body, the equipment is in my hand. This is the way Tony likes. It feels like everything is under his control. The detector swung harder as Tony approached the target. After a few turns, Tony made his way to the jamming facility. In the middle of the cave was a large silver-shining device. The left of the device was a mainframe, and a man stood next to the input panel. The man was dressed in a pale frock, wearing a mask, which represented the constellation Libra. Tony raised his gauntlets at him.
"I have already done so."
"Not everyone has the talent to make money. You must have. At least Hawkeye confirms that That-Tony's most useful asset is the Avengers' moneybag."
Steve's smile stopped. He saw the sparks in Tony's eyes. His voice grew deep, with a hint of defiance in it.
"You, little city cheat, I've seen lots of fellows like you. Do you know how many boys who peeped at her were beaten down by me? I'm looking at you. If you dare lie to her... You'll know Yorkshire men are tough." Seth said, rubbing his hands.
"You're the one who helped me figure it out." Tony said.
"I think he is your enemy. After all, every day with a flag face in the street has been you."
"Waiting for whom? We're not waiting for the Widow to send help, are we?"
Tony 19
"Mmmm... Steve..."
They sat down and talked.
"Calm down, you calm down, let me check him." Giant Man pulled Tony out of Steve's clutches, laid him flat on the ground.
"Is your armor powerful enough to get us back to New York?"
"I wouldn't dare. You know, mother is old and goes to bed early, but she told me repeatedly to get to you. The kids knew you were coming back and tried to stay up, but eventually they fell asleep."
"Thor, I quit drinking." Tony said.
The brown-haired boy leapt up from the water, grabbed him by the ankles and pulled him straight under.
"My ideas are always better."
"Thor? Are you telling the truth?"
"Well, since the real Peter is in Portland all this time, the person you know is me. And it's because of me, I keep making rookie superhero mistakes, failed to sense, failed to support teammates, had no survival skills in the wild, and often caught." Said Spider-Man gloomily.
Avengers Mansion, 2:30 a.m.
"I thought I'd been doing this part-time."
"Nothing. Write them in a small notebook."
"Whatever you like."
In addition to ninjas along the way, there are some people with red masks. These ninjas may belong to The Hand in Japan, and they are more likely to be hired killers. It’s not known whether the one who hired these killers was the same one who had hired Whiplash. But then Tony dropped the speculation. They were obviously not after him, or he would be dead by now. The men in the red masks, whom Tony did recognize, Zodiac agents. Not long ago, they made the black circle of New York City.
"Do you miss me again?"
"Doom, you know precisely what is going on. The only way to fix the timeline is that I go back without the memory of this year."
"I believe you..." Tony fell slowly.
Look, he knows.
"Time is an organic organism. Like all living organisms, it has been metabolizing itself every day, repairing the cracks in time and space, but the wound caused by your time travel is too serious for it to repair, and that's why it keeps generating visions. With enough energy, it can be repaired."
Peter spent the rest of the evening taking care of the kid and switching music. Until Cap came up, handed him an old disc, asked him to play an old song, a love song from the '40s. Peter hesitated for a moment. He didn’t know why he wanted an excuse to refuse, but any excuse didn’t come into his mind in time, so he put the disc on the phonograph.
Spider-Man is near California beach. He should be able to provide backup. I have recently teamed up with him. He has proved to be a very reliable team-mate. I hope you will consider putting him on the official register. This is an opportunity." Tony fiddled with his watch to locate Spider-Man.
“Oh, Tony.”
"I do na witan thou midd.(I don't know what you mean...)" Thor faltered.
“That doesn't mean we need your help. We Yorkshiremen can look after ourselves. Get out of here!" Seth punched Spider-Man.
"No strings attached."
"I think Hawkeye and Spider-Man can wait for us a little longer."
There was constant rustling and Mrs. Rogers crying on the phone. The expression on Krats's face grew grave.
Steve came out.
"I'm just so happy today."
"What was that before? I think we talked about it. Iron Man's life is Iron Man's life, and Tony Stark's life is Tony Stark's life. And I don't have a label attached to my head." Tony said angrily to Peter. "Peter, you're my best friend. I thought you should know me."
"And what else? What happened then? I don't remember anything. Maybe you hit me too hard, broke my head."
The brown-haired boy said a bunch of things he didn't quite understand. He looked at him with a smile and couldn't get a word in edgewise.
"Exactly."
"Whichever side we want to. Good shot!" Tony stood up and whistled.
"That's better, thanks, Thor." Tony said.
"No, don't." Tony stood up, grabbed Steve and buried his head in his arms.
Eleven years on, the castle remained eerie, and it was where Tony's journey to the future began.
When Wanda heard this, disappointment came into her eyes. Steve was perceptive, so he put aside the idea of visiting the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C., and said, "I don't have anything in particular in mind. Tea, painting and a quiet day is a vacation for me."
"What battle? None of our Avengers ID cards rang. "Said Peter doubtfully.
"I'm not sure why, but I think it's probably because of the implant in my chest."
"You're being direct this time." Doom said.
Tony connected the satellite, located the track of the signal, and where it finally disappeared was Baintronics. It was clear that the high level of encryption and frequency interference at Baintronics Headquarters made transmissions impossible.
Ebbets Field, years ago.
Does she have a special relationship with me? I haven't seen her before. Looks like That-Tony’s bad debt. But she was an attractive woman. Tony could imagine his future himself falling into such a woman like her.
"At home? You mean the home you are in now?" Kris said, her eyes wide with surprise.
Spiderman crawled up and down the walls of buildings on either side of the street, apparently not in a hurry, beside him was the slow-moving Iron Man.
"Where are you? Where is it here?" Tony asked.
The top of a building next to Baxter Building in New York City.
"Iron Man!"Spider-Man opened his eyes wide. "I mean Iron Man, are you Iron Man? No, I mean, is the one inside you the same one? No, I mean you're Iron Man and Tony Stark? The 19-year-old Iron Man and 19-year-old Tony Stark?"
"Maybe, let's forget all these details." Tony diverted the subject. "There should be another Quinjet in the garage."
"Huh?"
“I trust you, I can follow your plan, but you shouldn't keep it from me. You shouldn't try to take all the responsibility, try to solve all the problems on your own. Meanwhile, all I could do was just stand at the door of the lab and watch. "Steve said.
"Gambit, what happened?" The Black Widow asked calmly.
"You know, I was afraid, too... I'm afraid of the dark."
Christmas Eve in the village of Gawthrop, Yorkshire Dales, UK.
It's a gruesome prison where superpowered criminals are housed centralized. Tony went to see Dr. Octopus. Tony didn't take Peter with him. He went by himself. Iron Man's identity allows him to be unquestioned.
"Tony?!"
Tony clapped his hands.
"Mm." When the warm water and cozy kisses fell on Tony, he was too lazy to speak. He had not slept for days, and the feeling of sleepiness came with comfort and relaxation. He let out a big breath, let Steve do the rest, then fell asleep just as he had done that day.
The moment Steve entered his body, Tony felt pain, a great pain. Despite all the preparation he had done, mentally and physically, it still hurt. But right now, what he needed more than anything else was pain. The pain reminded him that he was still in the world, that he and he were still alive. The pain could make him feel his presence acutely, feel that he is not far away from him. The pain freed him from the weight that was weighing on his heart. The pain gave him a reason to cry, and Tony cried... He bit his lower lip heavily, but the tears ran down the corners of his eyes and into his ears.
"It's not fair. They will certainly continue to play favorites in Avengers, and Stark will..."
"Thank you, Tasha. Beaten by Stark, that's enough. I didn't expect Cap to hit me so hard."
"You fool! Do you all have a pile of rubbish in the Avengers' database? It's his son you need, Franklin."
"Or you're just protecting someone. Don't you think I don't know anything? S.H.I.E.L.D. knows everything. I'm watching you. I'm watching you both."
Tony 19
"What's going on exactly? You should know it's life and death for all of us."
"Does anyone else have anything to add?" Cap finally said the words Peter had been waiting for.
‘Relax. I'm not going to snoop on your life all the time. I'll intervene only when I'm alerted that your actions are causing serious time turbulence. Given that we've just stabilized this timeline, you'll just have to live with this little inconvenience if you don't want to cause more space-time collapse.’
Iron Man's shouts and his jet boots roared at the same time. Peter watched the red flame disappear into the sky.
"Is that so? Will it be better than mine?" The man drawled his voice.
Iron Man used to be Stark’s bodyguard, and was still active after Tony Stark’s death. His old club, Stark Enterprise, has now been acquired by Japan's Fujika. Industry insiders called this Iron Man's operation a rescue, which was actually a publicity for the Japanese capital, and predicted that Fujika would pour large sums of money into the UK after that. Square Mile people have been on edge...
You were disappointed after the hospital made sure she was out of danger. You had to work against time to kill Kris before she knew or I knew. So, you set up another scheme to sneak into Stark Armor base, steal the designs, and then framed Bain, lead me to Bain, hoping that Bain would haunt me so that you would have time to execute your killing plan. But what you didn't expect was that Bain would let me go.
"Basic fighting and survival training are required courses for every Avengers."
"Tony..."
"You have a hearing in an hour about the state of New York suing Tony Stark."
"All right, I also need the last thing". He muttered.
The puzzled Tony watched carefully as the mask slowly lifted. For the moment, he saw a boy with tawny hair and tawny eyes. It was exactly what Tony had expected.
"So, with Iron Man under investigation for murder, I’m without a bodyguard. Fair game for kidnappers, terrorists, anyone. If you could possibly...?"
"We have a government contract to protect the safety of soldiers of the state. We are now a major government arms contractor, especially since Stark Industries is out of the arms business, which makes Bain vulnerable to terrorists." Bain lamented.
Where did I put Kris just now... There seems to be something else in that attic... Tony called up the video in the armor...
"Back to Avengers Mansion." Tony answered.
"Aren't we adding Spider-Man to our list? Let him replace you." Tasha said with a laugh.
“But I think there's something wrong with us! I know how they lost contact. The Grand Canyon became Bermuda."
Tony could not guess how much Tasha knew. There was a trace of guilt for lying to them. Should he really confess everything to them? Like Tasha said, trust his teammates? But he dismissed the idea. Some guilt can only be borne by himself, and some things he is just guessing now.
Built-in communications blackout, Steve didn't call Tony by his name to protect his identity.
On the Quinjet to California, now.
"Handsome, are you alone today?" A little brown-haired boy came up the side road and walked beside Steve.
"It's not your fault." Bucky raised his hand and stroked Steve’s cheek. "It's not your fault that he screwed up his life, and you don't have to punish yourself for his mistakes."
Now, are you ready for the challenge? Check!"
"No wonder Dr. Octopus quipped that we were a bunch of 'headstrong idiots'. I finally understand now, who is leading the charge."
"Steve." Tony shouted.
Tony Stark is dead. He died like a hero, but he didn’t get a hero’s funeral. Before his death, his mind had been corroded by Kang, he only woke up at the last moment. And the one who defeated him was himself 10 years ago. 19-year-old Tony Stark became the Iron Man, the only Iron Man.
"Even if I told you, you can only watch at the door of the lab." Said Tony dispiritedly.
After a long time, Steve, who had not seen them return, followed the tracks, and found a pile of scattered sticks only.
"Tony, where are you? Zzzz..."
"Look, Steve, my new backpack." He pushed a button on the strap, the pack bounced off, his armor unfurled from the bag and fell on him. "I've upgraded my armor. You're going to lose this time."
"What did I say before?"
"Steve... Steve..."
"Should I go after him?" Spiderman raised his hand again.
Steve cried out in pain, but his look gave him away, and he laughed. Tony straddled him and leaned over to give him a long kiss. Then he parted from him at a distance and watched him squint at him, the tiny wrinkles at the corners of his eyes filled with unconcealed delight. It's been a long time since I left him, and there are so many things I want to tell him. Then Tony launched into a whimsical conversation.
“Nonsense!” He blushed and retorted. 'We are very religious!”
“Well, in this case, hide yourself."
"Now I can fix it if I want to, but I don't have to fix it for you. You'd better use it carefully." With those words, Tony flew to Steve's right, and he hit him with another iron fist. Steve leaned back to dodge the attack.
"But I'm going to destroy science lessons if I don't turn in my paper tomorrow! No, today is tomorrow! I mean, today is Friday. I'm going to have it done before class." As if at last he had remembered this important thing, Tony rolled over to his feet, dashed to the laboratory.
"I see. It's just like transplanting plants. They need to make earth, water, fertilize, sunbathe and catch insects. Could you be more specific? What the hell am I doing now? I'm still naked and the planet is about to be destroyed, so can you skip the theory section quickly? By the way, how soon will the earth be destroyed?"
"I want to go to bed early!" Tony said aloud. The Spymaster was a little confused about what he was selling.
“Good night, Jarvis." Steve said.
"Until he's frozen... That's fifteen years!"
"I'm afraid I don't have time." Peter said, "I'm working at Daily Bugle this weekend. By the way, I remember that the appointment with my tutor is almost up. Sorry, guys, I have to go."
"Something interesting. Which means there's no space-time turbulence in that new place, no Weirdo Doom. That’s perfect."
"Are you being too hard on him? We don't need him to take so many missions. We have plenty of hands now. He is still young. His experience can be accumulated in battles. None of us knew how to fight on the first day." Jane said a little sadly. Tony shambled from the training room back to his room that day. The house wasn't that big, and the news was always spreading fast.
"Don’t bother, I'm not thirsty."
"I thought you fancy men. It's just, you know, you're... Of course, it's nothing, it's really nothing, whatever, as your friend I will support you. I am your good friend Spiderman. All right?"
"There was no time. And you know he followed me, but you don't say a word. Have I been trusted in this team?" Tony said.
"Check in." The nurse pushed the register.
"You can take advantage of this opportunity to find Zodiac to pay for it." Said Tony tentatively, joking.
"Is that so strange? What about before?" Tony asked.
"Ironman, you are always the same, just play verbally. Breaking in here alone, aren't you afraid I'll kill you? I think it would be easy to kill you now."
"I'd like to borrow your mainframe computer."
"As I expected." Steve said.
Night. In the National Mall, Washington, D.C.
"Iron Man came to the castle to save the world."
"Maybe one day you'll be the leader, you can arrange the courses." Peter said.
“Then I'll stay in bed, Cap.”
"I'm going back, change and get some sleep. Yesterday's beer made me a little dizzy."
"Yes, a matter of subsistence. Upgrading to full Avenger makes me even more in a hurry."
"All right, all right. Don't get lost in there, wait for me to find you." Tony had an impulse to lift his mask and rub his eyebrows.
"I made the black circle disappear. "Libra replied calmly.
"No, thank you. I quit drinking."
"You command him?! Wait a minute, didn't you say he took your Avenger ID card?"
“Perhaps she needs some help, Tony.” Steve said.
"That's wonderful! It's so hot, I'm going to jump." With that, the brown-haired boy quickly took off his half-sleeved striped shirt, overalls and sandals, and jumped into the water.
"They still treat me like a kid. They seem to have forgotten that Iron Man is on the permanent roster. I'm Iron Man now. I don't need to be cared for like a fragile item. Have you forgotten that the Zodiac came not long ago and we won a battle together?"
“Is he a bad guy?”
"Peter, you know you're not going to make any difference, are you? You're not the original Spider-Man. You don't have any space-time energy, so there's no need to take pointless risks."
"Avenger for a day, Avenger for a lifetime!" With his hammer raised, Thor shouted as he flew into the vortex.
"The thing in today, it can be big or small. If I call the police or press now, the headlines tomorrow will be about the Avengers break-in Bain illegal. And Stark Enterprises will be sued."
Whiplash just thought already got, saw this kind of circumstance, instantaneous be frightened. I just upgraded equipment, never thought so kind of useless. Although there is a whip remaining, the opponents have cracked its technology. Better not lose all.
Tony didn’t know what to do with a pile of bottles and cans. He took blood samples from Spiderman and the golden mask girl. But cell biology is not his area of expertise. Dr. Pym and Dr. Banner are, and it's a little difficult for him to come up with an antidote in such a short time. But he's immune... Not by neutralizing the poison, but by an implant in the chest. Whatever, he took apart his chest implant to find out why he was immune to the poison.
Steve is a lurker, but Tony is not.
"So, the current situation is that you are immune to poison but you don’t have armor, which means you can’t fight, and those fighters are not immune to poison. It's over, it's over."
"Hulk is completely out of control now, how are you going to get him to hit the right spot?" Steve said.
"They entrusted me with predicting global anomalies."
"Wait a minute." Tasha thought again and called out to him. "You contact all the heroes who can come to New York right now. Gambit, you tell me the story again, don't omit any detail..."
"So you mean this universe, like an egg, is now going to be crushed."
“His name?”
"Peter Parker and Spider-Man are one and the same, but I'm not Peter Parker, also not Spider-Man."
"You know what? You're not alone. Captain America is always there. He's in your heart. He guards every child, accompanying them out of darkness, out of fear, out of the closet."
"Can you hack into their system?"
Tony hung his head for a moment. Then he continued, "Well, I apologize. I'm sorry that I'm not a holy man with the Avengers Charter in my Bible, and that I can't play by your and his rules. I am sorry to be a stain on this sacred organization and on your perfect leadership. Do you want me to put this apology on the record, Cap?"
"But I can't go like this." Tony pointed to his naked body.
"Once up a time, there was a dark castle, in which lived a king in a metal mask and a green cloak."
The last message, dated this morning, is listed as an S+ contact.
You, sadly, an old fool.
Bang! Click! Another empty bottle broke.
"I don't know, but I don't think it's a natural phenomenon."
"Are you strong enough to do it, old man?"
Then Tony went back to Steve's room as if he had never left. But of two spaces joined, and his head was a bit dizzy. Steve also noticed Tony's absent-minded.
Chapter 29
“You two should be full now. Going to bed. Farm people wake up early, won't let you be late.”
"Don't you forget it? I was Tony Stark before I was Iron Man, a young genius. None of that is a big deal. Do you want to hear good news or bad news first?
"A monster, you see, has only a frightening shell. When we know what it is, we will no longer be afraid, and we will conquer it. Your terrible father is just a sad drunker, a coward who is afraid to face his life and the truth."
The super serum is so restorative, it won't leave any traces on his body. But Tony didn't need to look in the mirror to know how many traces of himself he had left on his body that would last a long time. The distinction between human and superhuman is unfair. Maybe some science can be done. A local inhibitor is a good idea. Where should I brand it? Maybe it should be in a place that is not easy for others to find. A wicked thought flashed through Tony's mind, he smiled evilly.
"Jarvis, give us each a bottle of soda."
"What the hell is this?"
"Actually, I have no plans to..." Tony said.
"Come on, Cap..." Hawkeye's words were stopped by Tasha.
"All right." Dr. Octopus told Tony where his New York lab was located.
Gym, Avengers mansion. Now.
"The man who dragged you in."
"That’s because Iron Man was pulling him, and he was flying."
"But even so, it's not going to be enough for us to implement it." Said Tony, looking around.
On the second scan, the data was read slowly, and the patrol guard was about to return.
The room was a bust, all the drawers were opened, the mattress cover was turned up, but the room was empty. He peered out at the door. There was nothing, but empty bottles and crumbs of glass on the floor. There was no one. His father was gone.
"Ah!" He was so frightened that he let out a cry. He fluttered wildly and knocked the spider off his neck. He knocked over a row of shelves and the models on the shelves fell to the ground. The models stood up and moved toward him. He just screamed out of the shop. He splashed the water outside the door and disturbed the neon reflection in the water. The neon sign said:
"Neither. In short, I was Tony Stark 10 years ago. I helped the Avengers defeat the current Tony Stark, and then I took over the Iron Man title."
"That's it. Don't relax too much. It's a big favor, you'll have to pay it back someday." Bain smiled sweetly again. "You're the Iron Man. I know you're not going to default. Now, you can go."
With everyone watching, Tasha followed Tony out of the room. Thirty minutes later, Tasha returned alone.
“It's not true at all!”
"He used to call me ‘Master Steve’ a long time ago." Steve said with a wink and a smile.
"It is Steve's. It was made for him by Mr. Krats. He worked hard for it. It's his favorite thing. You can't sell it. Please, please."
"What about Tony and Peter?" Kris looked over Spider-Man's shoulder.
"You're kidding, I'm Tony Stark, a genius inventor. How hard it is to make money in the 1930s, uh?"
"But...... But I want to wait for you there. Didn't we agree to grow up together?" Said Spider-Man scratching his head.
"You are Peter Parker." Tony said.
"Guessing and being told the truth are two different things, okay? I was never prepared to take on the responsibility of keeping such a big secret. In comparison, selling your own ‘criminal’ photos to the one who frames you in order to pay tuition and bills is really just a piece of cake. But as the old saying goes, 'With great power comes great responsibility'."
"At last, you've made a difference today. I should think of some way to get home quickly."
Libra turned to Tony before leaving and said, "As a thank-you, I'll tell you something. I have looked into multiverse, almost every earth has an Iron Man and a Tony Stark, so I know who you are. And, you, you're the most special of them all, so never ever give up, believe in yourself Tony, believe in yourself..."
"I'm still on duty."
"Listen, Wanda, this is not the time to mourn. Focus on what I'm saying. I promise you, if we ever get back alive, I'll fix Vision. I'll fix him completely. We need you now, the Avengers need you, the world needs the mighty Scarlet Witch right now."
Kris sat across from Tony, talking about the Yorkshire Dales. Tony tried to concentrate on what she was talking about, pushing back his thoughts.
External defense breached. 58% of the power left. System data was displayed in front of Tony's eyes.
“I'll give you a shilling for what you think now." Kris opened the door and stepped out, putting her arms around Tony from behind.
You lunatic, Tony, you lunatic." Steve said. When he leaned over, kissed Tony, he could taste himself in his mouth.
Steve could feel the tension in Tony as he lay on the bed with his head on his side, the stiffness in his back. So he took his hands, which lay on either side of his head, and clasped them with his fingers and squeezed them. He kissed all the way down from his neck, feeling his body gradually relax under his passionate kisses. Tony gasped softly... Then Steve split his buttock petals and entered his body.
Tony didn't resist. He leaned on Steve's chest, felt his kiss fall into his hair. And then Tony really has to dwell on all the shits he's sworn to throw out of this bed.
He had run out of words made up in advance. His answer was to hand the picture to the girl. His face went red to his ears. Just as the girl reached for the painting...
Tony's Longest Day 02
"Emmm."
"It's more naive than brave." Tony shrugged a little dejected. "I guess I'm not mature enough to cover it up perfectly. So, I did this stupid thing tonight."
"I think Jarvis will be able to take us. He deserves a vacation too."
The farmhouse is small, only two floors, but it is neat and tidy.
"You fool, you still don't understand why my time machine doesn't create parallel universes? Because the core that powers it is such a substance."
“Actually, I just wanted to ask, everyone is a team of two, why only Cap is a team of one, but Black Widow agreed."
"Thou ne wynna.(You are really disappointed.)"
"In real fighting there are a lot of distractions. If your body isn't good enough to have reflexes, you have to concentrate on getting rid of them. It looks like you need more practice."
"But this is the only time you can beat me."
Then Tony yelled to the window, "Old man, you've been listening under the window for a long time. Now you can come in. Don't test me those fights you taught. I can't beat this kind of hard hand."
"Now it's my turn to appear."
"I'll try... Found it."
"Certainly, if that is your wish."
Chapter 34
"I let him run. If I didn't let him get away, how could I trace who was behind him? 'Catching Ghost' was more than a joke. I knew they were sent by you, but I only believed the evidence. I let him run back, tracked his frequency and confirmed that his boss was you. "Tony said slightly, then he sarcastically.
To be continued......
Krats put down the phone, rubbed his forefinger, thumb between his eyebrows. His brain was spinning at high speed. Tony Stark, what are you gonna do?
"What do you have in mind?” Steve, who was nearby, interjected.
"What do you know, stupid woman, Mr. Kolsky took a fancy to it, and there were bigger men behind him. Just give it to him, then we'll make great friends, be rich and get out of this damn place."
"I'm back." Tony came in, closed the door behind him, naturally went to the other side of the bed where he had slept in the morning.
Kris was awake by this time, still a little pale. She tried to crack a smile when she saw Tony.
“Night, Tony, Seth, and Peter." Kris said. "See you in the morning."
"That's all right with me." Tony said.
"Em."
"Your new red-headed assistant told me. Paper? Pepper? Piper?"
Then Kris took Tony's hand and ran through the rain to the barn. Although they ran very fast, they still got their clothes wet. Kris pulled Tony down onto the haystack. Her half-wet hair stuck to a pile of hay. Then she laughed.
"I haven't heard of it." Tony's laughing stopped.
"I think there's been a misunderstanding. I was defending myself." Tony raised his hand.
At the sound, Tony turned around.
Steve had that dream again. He was running in it. It's a similar scene, but it seemed a little different. This time his uniform was not torn, his shield was in his hand, and his heart was not frightened, but full of anger. There was a red figure in front of him. The red figure was not walking fast, as if to lead him forward. He was almost catching up with him by a hair's breadth. Steve began to see him clearly. It was a knight in red and gold armor.
With a thin moon, a can of chickpeas, a pot of coffee and an acoustic guitar, it's like jumping into the West in 1872. Everything was so calm; It would have been a vacation if he hadn't thought of Hawkeye and Spider-Man getting lost.
Clint tried to adjust the stick, but still couldn't pull it up. The Quinjet lurched precariously toward the Canyon wall.
"Criminal mastermind, creating chaos, Ha-ha." Libra suddenly laughed, he raised his hand and slowly turned around. "Tony Stark, very well, very well. Just yourself today. I've been waiting for you."
"My world! My girl! No, your girl! If it wasn't for the girl in your painting, you wouldn't have been targeted. Never mind the painting! Run! Trust me, prison is no fun."
"Done!" Tony took the child's outstretched hand.
"And you say you can't polit?!" Tony imitated Steve’s education mode. "Half a truth is still a lie, Steve."
Well, making money in 1930 is harder than I thought. Tony sighed.
"I have a... message for Iron Man. The next time you talk to him... tell him I know he’s innocent. And tell him if he needs anything... ever... I hope he knows... I’ve got his back."
"Now, Steve!" Tony shouted.
A secret base in a cave on an uninhabited island in the Atlantic Ocean.
"Like you said, if the earth was destroyed, I would have no more territory to rule over. Take it."
"I was actually trying to steal a date with a man in the barn without Seth watching me." Kris said, charmed.
"I found... I found that..." Tony's memory was a blur. "It was just an old broken phonograph."
"Because I have to look at the shop. And Mr. Krats will teach me."
"Jarvis, if my memory serves me, I gave you explicit instructions not to disturb me. Looks like I need to tweak your program again."
Tony felt his hands clenched tighter by Steve, and the palms of his hands were wet with sweat. Then there was more pain, and then there was a thrill of pleasure in the pain. Tony's body caught the thrill and found the rhythm to chase it, and more pleasure came over it. Groans of joy and sobs leaked out of Tony's mouth.
"And you promised to follow my plan... And I... I chose to be a coward this time. "said Tony thoughtfully.
"No more of those little toys he built to help you in the simulation room this time. You couldn’t beat my new upgraded armor with the same old tactics."
Then they went back to doing what they had been doing before Tony fell asleep, and that's when the Avenger ID card went off. Tony, who already knew where Steve's Avenger ID card was, took Steve's card to hand.
He knows when to provoke me, when to make me laugh, when to lose patience, when to be aroused... Even when I fell asleep last night, it was because he wanted me to.
“What?”
"Throw in the towel? You made three mistakes today:
What difference does it make whether you move your things back or not? You are all right in my arms. Steve wasn't going to tell the truth to silly Tony.
"Well, then? Mm... Yawn..."
"What exactly?"
Steve lifted Tony, who was already naked, to the bay window, opened his legs and leaned down between them, unbuttoning his pajamas one by one, kissing his body as it came off.
“Besides, there doesn't seem to be any village nearby that can get horses. We're not going anywhere until the armor is fixed. And according to my calculations, Hawkeye and Spider-Man..."
“I'm sorry, Thor, but I'm not very good at parties like this. But I'm glad you found your power again." Steve said.
Just then, two policemen on patrol noticed what was happening. They came running from a distance and pointed their guns at them.
"Thank you." Mrs. Rogers took the card.
Besides, my ‘old’ is not made up, it is accumulated from many battles. As you said, ‘age is not a mere addition’, right?" Steve returned a provocative look this time.
"Oh, so close to having snowmen next door."
"You're not the only one watching from behind a mask at this party. You haven't looked away from him all night. But when he got what he wanted, he forgot about you." The gold-mask girl continued with a sigh. "Whoever you really are, remember what I say ‘he's a playboy, anyone who falls in love with him has no end’."
"Many years. Not long ago, my super soldier serum went wrong. My body was rapidly aging. He awakened me from a coma, made me wear armor, so that I could fight in the last moments of my life. Fulfilled a veteran's last wish to die in battle."
"I just want you to come in with me." Doom said.
"You're just too smart. You've always been too smart. You always think too much, too complicated. It's good to be silly once in a while. Sometimes we don’t need to be too smart, the simple way is the good way.”
"Look at this." Tony said.
Tony left Doom's castle with a full stomach of questions. Although Tony was full of doubts, once again he was inspired by hope, the hope of staying in this era.
Five minutes later, Spymaster was knocked to the floor. He stumbled to his feet, wiped the blood of his mouth, and looked angrily at Tony.
"Yeah, Superhero Daily." Steve sighed.
When Tony walked into the boardroom room at Avengers Mansion, all eyes turned to him.
"Peter? !"
“That sounds interesting. What did you do, Tony?" Kris interjected with interest.
“How did they get back there?”
Thor stepped forward, patted Tony on his shoulder.
"Libra? "Said Tony in surprise.
"Spider sense, tap blinding?" Spiddy said awkwardly, "Well, I can't."
"Oh? So do you actually like baseball?"
"I hope his prediction comes true. I can get the money before the Avengers really close." Said Tony, tightening a screw. "Pete, do you want to work on Jet with me? I can tell you some secrets."
Tony 19
"No." Tony swallowed, moistening his dry throat.
Chapter 42
"So do I. Let’s do it."
"Did you eat dinner last night?"
"How long have you been staring at the screen? Tony." Victor said.
"Oops, it's broken now, you don't have to think about it anymore."
Tony looked thoughtfully at Jarvis as he left. When he turned around, he saw Thor and Steve both staring at him.
"We must concentrate our utmost force on the spot where its shield’s weakest. I think I can detect this spot."
"Yes, there's nothing, the Avengers can't solve." Tony's hopes rose again.
As Wanda spoke, Iron Man's voice was heard on the team's public channel.
"Steve."
"But not more than my dignity. That's why I am going to give it to you. That's why I've been waiting for you to come to me. But you, heroes are as slow as ever."
"Mr. Krats has cut short his experimental work for today. He's going to take a rest. So I'm coming."
"Let me escort you back to your dorm." Tony said.
"Was that what he thought?"
"Because he has gone far away."
A man walked slowly to the station with a large bouquet of flowers. The bouquet was so large that it hid the giver's face.
"I swear, I really didn't. It's just that I accidentally destroyed the samples. We may have to do it again."
Thirty minutes later, Tony was on the old man's back enjoying the afterglow of the orgasm. He didn't want to leave his body just yet, and he was going to keep the night going. He was going to do everything he wanted tonight. He had already thought about what to do next, this way, and that way... Just imagining these pictures made Tony tremble with excitement.
“Well, Mrs. Rogers, this is an accident, no one's fault. He's an alcoholic, he fell, that's all. But you know, we can't call the police, we can't, it would cause a lot of trouble. None of us wished him any further harm. Harold is waiting at the door. He'll help us dispose of the body and clean up the blood. But you must be strong, you must stay in this house, so that suspicion will not arise."
"Gambit?! It's you. What about Professor X? Where's the Cyclops?" Hawkeye first spoke with curiosity.
"Last time, you also praised my elevator shield, said it is very handsome and saved your life. Is your ideology broken now?"
“That Sonny Spencer?”
"I just took a wild guess." Tony smiled mysteriously. "Well, it's settled. I'll meet you at the door of your dorm tomorrow."
Postscript to Tony 19
Tony's armor had not yet been repaired. The only thing he could use was a pair of gauntlets, which he carried with himself. He used the power of the gauntlets to activate the detection equipment. An unknown force field interfered with all transmission lines. New York City was covered by a black barrier. Meanwhile, signals of alien technology were sent out in the sewer. Tony followed the signal source and groped his way through the sewer to the exit. A small Zodiac airship was in front of him. Thor and Steve were fighting heartily with a bunch of Zodiac agents. Tony pulled on his gloves and fired repulsors, clearing the way for them.
"Tasha, I know, I was delayed, I..." Steve's voice has returned to the captain’s voice.
"Not only that, but the most important thing is, you didn't deliver the bat!"
"It doesn't matter if it's iron or not iron. There's nothing alive in front of my high voltage." With these words, Electro sent out a high voltage to them again.
The door was not wide enough, and Bain was standing in the doorway. The Iron Man squeezed sideways, the armor sweeping Bain's breasts. It was not a personal touch, but Tony seemed to feel the softness of them.
"Well, all right." Spiderman was eating, looking at Hawkeye with admiration.
That's it. She's dead. No one will ever know his secret again. The flower giver leaned close to the woman on the bed, by detecting her breath, confirmed that she was a corpse. Because everything was going so well, he let his guard down. At that moment, the person on the bed, who was supposed to be a corpse, reached out and seized his outstretched hand. His guard was not up, he was flung out violently against the window on the other side of the bed. The glass broke clanging. He fell hard to the floor. But he is an expert. He reacted quickly. He got up, wiped the blood of his mouth, saw clearly the person who got up on the bed.
"Young Master Antony, I brought the hot chocolate," Jarvis's voice sounded outside the door.
The earth is not exterminated today, so Tony has to hand in his paper. After spending too much time in the lab, he almost got lost at Columbia University again, but Kris showed up just in time to save him. She went over to Tony, held him in her hand.
"His name is Billy."
"I believe you, but I think you should believe me, too. You should have told me the truth when the cave fell in. You didn't come out. I was really worried..." Steve said to Tony.
"I'm not stupid. But I'll need to be a little closer to him to test his new gear. You protect me for a few minutes."
"Actually, I have no plans to move back." Tony replied helplessly.
What Libra said reminds Tony of some recent Avengers missions, most of which he missed. He only read about later in the database: dealing with California coastal surges and protests by Atlanteans; submarine testing water in the Atlantic ocean with unknown malfunction, undersea rescue; extinct volcano erupted suddenly, emergency evacuation of local residents; A meteor shower smashed a town, supported the cleanup of damaged buildings...
"They were petrified and looked at us with disgust." Steve whispered in Tony's ear.
"I want to hear you tell me."
He turned off the bedside lamp and prepared to leave. Steve held him back.
"Who?" Peter wondered.
"I didn't mean to leave her behind ten years ago."
"Miss DeGann, I've come to bring you flowers." He said, standing in the doorway.
"Aren't you curious how I got to be 19?"Tony went on and made more effort.
"I can take care of myself and give you two a hand." Tony knocked down the Zodiac agent in front of himself and stood back to back with Steve.
"You're so smart, Pete."
Avengers Mansion, New York City.
The night color is thick before dawn. New York, a noisy city, was also a little quiet, only drunks and stray cats crossing the streets now. A motorbike was speeding along, smoothly skirting the yellow taxi on the main road, weaving into the lane. Although there were few vehicles and no traffic jams at this time, Steve still took a short cut, rushed to get back to the mansion.
"A playboy? It sounds dangerous and attractive. Since you're not interested, next time I see him, won't you mind if I talk to him a little more?"
"When did the Tony Stark I knew become a coward?"
"What about the sense Dr. Marvel sent us back?”
"That's stupid of you. Do you think my time machine is a normal time machine?" Doom listened to Tony's long speech and raised his voice. "The Avengers flew back in my time machine to the exact point in time from which they started, without creating any parallel universes. That's why your very existence created a paradox, and when I sent my men to 'kill' Iron Man, I've already implied that you should go back. You couldn't see the logic and effect."
"You should have some confidence in yourself. You're a good leader." Tasha said.
"Tony, you understand that critical time points can't be duplicated, right? If rewriting will create more paradoxes, more instability, more cuts in this timeline, the universe will collapse at an accelerating rate."
"Maybe not much, maybe a little."
Tony 19
After receiving the DJ job, Peter finally got his wish, hid in a corner. He watched in silence. He saw Thor laughing as he put his arm around Tony's shoulder; he saw Jane holding Tony for a long time; he saw Cap looking at him, and Hank cutting in every now and then... The five founders of Avengers got together, Tony just fell in. They all love him; they all think of him as family; and they are waiting for him to come back home.
"Something has happened to Professor X. The negative feelings that have accumulated over the years in the Professor's mind have merged with Magneto's hatred of humanity, and in the Professor's head a monster has been born, a monster that none of us can stop..." Gambit's face was frightened. He could not speak for a long time.
"Maybe you should count on us. Because you're all a bunch of headstrong idiots." Doctor Octopus scolded.
Krats frowned at this answer. He took off his mask and put down his spray gun, picked up the extension in the basement. Mrs. Rogers's voice came over the phone.
"Cap, morning meeting..."
"Okay, okay...” Tony held out his hand." Next time, try not to make my decision for me, will you? Vic."
Investment? The financial market has collapsed, securities dealers have run away, entrepreneurs have jumped off buildings, and there are only people who have nowhere to collect debts. Will anyone invest at this time? The Carbonell Steel had been in his hands for the third generation, and he was already heavily in debt. Despite several layoffs, it was still hard to keep going. All that was left of the Carbonell family was an empty shell.
"The joke is not funny. Captain America must not lie."
"Cap, he'll figure it out when he calms down." Wanda went to comfort Steve.
"Actually, Tony walked in, lit the mansion on fire," said Peter defiantly. "His family love him, don't they?”
"You know, I hate tearful parting."
"Tony?!"
But all these only in Peter's imagination, stayed in Peter's desire. He finally didn't do anything, because he clearly heard the name he murmured was not his name. At this time, any action he took will destroy his trust in him, will destroy everything they built up between them. So, Peter tried to suppress his lust. He curled up.
"I've got most of his data, but I need a sample of his whip."
"Cap, it’s really hard for me to understand you. You're a terrible ascetic. I'll take the opportunity to go out and have fun with girls." Clint interposed.
Then Steve walked off stage and Tasha passed him by.
"And that time in Colorado..." Tony went back to the story of the escaped prisoners.
