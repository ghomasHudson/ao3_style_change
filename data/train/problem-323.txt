“What is that?” Sherlock asked, curiosity getting the better of him.
Sherlock froze again, remaining silent. His jaw clenched, and after a moment, he spoke. "I don't think that's any of your business, Mycroft."
“It’s just taking the edge off.”
“Sorry, am I hurting you?”
“From what I’ve heard of your parents, I’ll be in for an in-depth chat,” John pinned the invite to his calendar. “What have you told them?”
And winter arrived with a grip of cold iron over Britain that froze pavements and blasted icy winds down the streets. The weather reports said it was something to do with winds from Siberia, or something about winter storms, but John wasn’t really listening. All he knew was that people walked through London hunched over and faces hidden in the necks of their coats. There was no snow – something about the wrong type of wind, or air pressure or something, but there was no respite from the bitterly cold air.
Sherlock’s head suddenly hurt, and he handed the pencil back to John as he pressed his temples. The implications of this were too much.
“You’re back quick,” John looked up from his paper as Sherlock slumped onto the sofa. “Oh god… are you ok?”
“It will all end in tears,” Mycroft shook his head. “Mark my words.” And he vanished.
” John looked up. “Am I crazy, or is he saying what happened was my fault?”
John landed his hand into Sherlock’s, and Sherlock gripped it tight.
“It’s… an omega thing,” Sherlock said, going red. “We’re not supposed to – to
“How about a share?” the woman asked.
“It was a hug, Sherlock, not rimming on the asphalt,” John snorted. “You’ve got no right to get jealous.”
The arms tightened, and there was a snarl close to his ear.
“Several times. He simply had no urge to try and get well. When he wasn’t deducing the staff and patients (and often suffering for it, once he’d suitably insulted them), he was trying to trade medications with other people, or seeking inappropriate company.”
“It means,” Mycroft said, “that Sherlock is an omega, and there are plenty of alphas out there who might take advantage of him, particularly in that sort of situation.”
John stood open-mouthed in the hallway. “Oh, you git,” he made a fist. “You absolute git. I’m going to fucking
"I wouldn't let that sort of bravado get a hold of you,” Sherlock said. “It wouldn't make for a fair fight.” He lifted a hand to where James held his shirt front.
Sherlock looked up. He’d been expecting to walk further than this to be approached. “Why, do you have something?” he tilted his head to one side, the hood on his head obscuring his face.
But now, Sherlock thought as he wiped his eyes, finally, John would only ever see that dead girl.
Sherlock looked up. "Sorry?"
“But still. You’re an om – only parent,” Sherlock plunged awkwardly onwards, “and it’s not fair to expect you to… I mean, carrying bags alone on the most basic level…”
“Maybe we could do this inside?” John offered. He was quite hoping for a cup of tea and a sit down, and the public avoiding them were making him feel increasingly embarrassed.
This time, the picture was of a girl, laughing and smiling, her hair blowing in the wind as she tried to hold it back.
They went into the lounge, where Sherlock was propped up on cushions on the sofa, another cushion held over his chest with his folded arms. He was staring sulkily at something on the television, but looked up and brightened as he saw John.
Sherlock stared. “Are you kicking me out?”
John looked away. He shut his eyes, and took a deep breath through his nose. Then gagged. “Uh. What is that?”
John forced a smile of his own. “Good to know he’s… happy.”
“Uh…” he looked away, trying to shake off the nausea that had suddenly gripped him. His stomach rolled, and he had to swallow hard.
John reached for Sherlock’s hand, their fingers both wrapped in wool and leather to keep the cold away.
“It’s nothing of the sort.”
Sherlock nodded, not looking back as he went down the stairs and got into his brother’s car.
“I… do.”
John’s dad gave him a sad smile. “I know. But, Johnny… you are an alpha. You’re going to be one properly before very much longer. Sherlock’s an omega. A boy omega, so a lot of people will want him.”
“I don’t… I don’t know.”
“I live with – it’s a bit complicated,” John crunched up the plastic, and flopped onto the grass beside his bag and clothes. “I’m… engaged, and I, like, live with his family.”
Sherlock thought. “Learning things,” he decided. He sighed. “It sometimes feels like you’re the only one who
He considered the yellow mess the creature had produced. Perhaps that wasn't ink, after all. But what animal would give up undigested food? How utterly wasteful.
Sherlock blushed with excitement. “Thank you. Thank you, My John.”
John stroked a hand over Sherlock’s hair, teasing through the curls. Then pulled his head forward.
Sherlock winced as Pixie let go and re-latched with enthusiasm. “But this is… this is one thing I can do properly. It's the only thing I do that shows her I love her.”
“More?”
“Alright, then. Thank you,” she disappeared.
John demonstrated defending his throat with his arms. “I couldn’t move away, you see?”
‘No!’ John cried in horror at the thought. ‘God no. That’s not what I…’ he plugged Birdie’s bottle back in. ‘I just don’t get why you’d do this for me. For us,’ he said.
He made a soft noise in the back of his throat, and opened his eyes.
“Fine.”
The policeman checked the ID, then took a photo of it. “Straight through, go to the blue sheeted area, as for Detective Donovan.”
John smiled, relieved that they had found some common accord. “So, you’ll take me on? I should mention that I would like to keep my father near during the day, just to keep an eye out for his needs. Would that be alright?”
If that was really what his mother was offering, he would jump at the chance and never look back.
“It’s crooked,” John said, unable to resist nagging his sister where he could.
“Yes, that is what I am saying, Sherlock.” Jaituna smiled at him, but it did not show her teeth and looked a little pained. It was obvious that she did not want to send her son away. “I believe that we still have one or two allies that I trust to take you in and teach you their ways. I will speak with your father about it in the morning—”
“Let Harry do most of the lifting since she’s older than you, John. You just hold that rope steady so she doesn’t drop it.” John patted John on the head and gave Harry’s shoulder a brief touch before he went back across the deck to continue working on the net piled against the rim.
Harry, son of Wat
This occurrence, often as it may repeat, warms something in Sherlock. It is certainly another piece of evidence of John's affection for Sherlock. As always, his doctor is taking care of him.
“I’ve met Wat. I like Wat,” Sarah said, then continued after a pause, “Your sister is something else, though. Can you hear me alright?”
“No, I, you can’t really believe that,” John said, voice choked and hoarse with tears. “
Sherlock is waaaaay OOC for an 11-yr-old child, even a precocious one (like I imagine John to be) but hey, he's Sherlock.
Harry suddenly flung his hand away and yelled, “Race you, brat!” Then she was already yards ahead of him, kicking up the soft clay in her wake. John sped off to catch up. Harry, with her much longer legs, beat him to the boat while he was still a considerable distance behind her. She disappeared onto it.
Yep. One more chapter! or epilogue, as it is.
Harry had taken the remaining two ropes and looped them around a post on the deck, pulling the rope using a different method since her muscles were not as strong as her father’s. Wat was going much slower than Harry, who was pulling and wrapping the rope as fast as she could, so that the net ascended evenly.
“Let us just confirm,” she started, and then had to stop because she was laughing so uproariously. “Let us confirm that today you have fallen into a snake pit, foiled a regicidal plot, and—” she lowered her voice significantly, but it was still full of laughter, “—learned the secret of your birth, and the first thing that you say is that you are bored?”
Siger started at that, turning swiftly in his seat to look at Sherlock, the excess fabric of his robes falling around the throne in an uncoordinated cascade. Sherlock had barely felt the first stirrings of panic being the focus of his father’s scrutiny when he finally saw it.
Eight months after being snatched up by Jim, John is living in misery, selling himself for his sister's sake. He tries to understand Jim, but it seems hopeless.
“I didn’t mention it because Mycroft told me I should not to give information freely to our enemies.”
John began to make his way home. Even though there were a few other vendors leaving at the same time, no one spoke. To John, the entire world seemed quiet. The sun had set some time ago, and the sky had begun darkening. Even the cicadas that buzzed and chirped at the oncoming night seemed muted.
To be fair, Harry was the loudest person that John knew. She was louder than even their father. On market days their father, Wat, allowed Harry to do most of the calling to customers since her bellowing voice was brash and high-pitched, carrying clear to the other side of the market and cutting sharply through the clamor of the marketplace’s assorted noises like the peal of a cymbal. If John yelled as loud as he could, his family could hear him from across the house. In the market, they could barely hear him across their stand. John was sure that if Harry yelled, he could hear her across the entire district.
John cleared his throat and resumed the conversation, “Well, anyway. I guess we’ll see what happens. What were you saying about leprosy?”
Author's Notes: Not that it matters, since we all know our boys well, but I thought I'd include the specific photos that kind of guide my imagination.

“Yes, it’s me, Harry,” John replied, smiling, and he stepped forward to hug his sister.
As Sherlock came through the door, he saw the mage again. This time, the man was not doing anything so innocent as simply walking down a palace hallway.
Sherlock was also close enough to hear Mycroft conversing with the young Lady Tufaena. Upon closer inspection, Sherlock could see how the servants moved most of her dinnerware around for her, helping her even more than his nanny helped him. She held her own eating utensils and brought the food to her mouth, but everything else was handled by the servant at her elbow. Her servant even held the cup to her mouth for her to drink.
Jaituna motioned for the group to continue, and as they all entered the dining room, replied to Sherlock, “Now, don’t speak of your brother that way, my dear. You know it’s inappropriate.”
Siger waved a hand and his guards approached from either side, dragging the frozen woman away and presumably to the dungeons. Sherlock was still breathless with excitement, almost panting, while Mycroft visibly composed himself after the unexpected outburst. Siger looked torn, likely between commending Sherlock on his findings or reprimanding him for his uncouth manners.
“Fish! Harry look at all the fish! Papa! Papa!” John clenched both fists in excitement and jumped up and down while Wat slipped out of the loops of rope. The body of the net had formed into a roll, securing the fish on all sides. John though they were like the filling in a dumpling and giggled.
Jaituna stiffened and a discomfited look passed over her face as she looked at Hadsana. At Sherlock’s words, Hadsana had brightened considerably, but after seeing the empress’ expression, she replied, “Oh, no, not at all! Perish the thought, your highness!”
Mik placed the milk, lemon, and cream in the center of the small table, then retrieved the coffee kettle to set next to them.
In the end, Siger simply sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, then tilted his head toward Mycroft and Sherlock. “Perhaps it would be best if you two went ahead to meet your mother for dinner. I will finish up here and join you shortly.”
Sherlock shot his gilded chair one last disdainful glare before clambering into the oversized thing. He wondered how, after all of the cautionary tales in literature and folklore, people still continued to fall in love and suffer for it.
“Then, your mother was offered a position in a noble household. She was so excited that she had been hired as a gardener for a rich lord’s manor. She was thrilled at how grand everything was, and how much magic was there. You see, the lord who owned the manor was very powerful, his magic so strong that he had multiple mage apprentices. Emma, whose nurturing personality endeared her to everyone she met, gained the lord’s favor. There was magic everywhere in that house and he loved to show her those things. Some were practical like the fey balls of light that floated through the air, eliminating the need to light candles. Some was fanciful, like the tree on the wall in his study, which had golden branches that showed every member of his noble lineage.”
“I’ve got enough on my hands with the outbreak, I’m telling you! And all of my research… there just aren’t enough hours in the day, John.” Mik turned into a room, seeming to finally run out of steam for his rant.
“Then why –”
you move schools? Not that I’m complaining,” he laughed, it coming out slightly high-pitched.
Sherlock just looked up at the sky. His face was very smooth – John doubted he’d started shaving, yet. He was pretty, and different, and striking, and John’s heart fluttered slightly as the thought of touching his friend’s smooth, white skin.
Mycroft was in the sitting room when Sherlock got back. He looked up sharply as Sherlock walked in. A look of sheer relief passed over his face when he saw Sherlock was neither beaten nor bruised.
Sherlock grinned, and leaned down to kiss him.
“No, you’ll be a
“No, that’s not properly,” he said.
“A lot of shouting?”
“Mm?”
“Sherlock! What have you
John went very, very still.
John climbed up the bed, and opened his arms.
John didn’t move.
“Chemistry,” John repeated. “We’ve got Chemistry, now.”
But there was a more immediate problem at hand.
“Weirdo.”
The possessive stung, deep down, but John was too much in his heat to care a deal. “Yours… You know. I’ll stay. Yours. When I leave.”
“Yeah, I do,” John forced a laugh. “I really do.”
Or pitied him.
“Please leave,” Victor said in reply. "Just... get out of this flat. Now."
Sherlock had lost.
“Well, it makes sense to me. If you’re dysphoric enough to… yeah, then increasing your dose might actually help.”
“Alright, Mike.”
“Then… what?” Sherlock looked him over. “Oh god, did you not want me to –”
“I don’t know how much.”
“I know,” Sherlock sniffed, and John could smell his tears. “I just… miss them.” He relaxed further into John’s arms, turning his head to rest his cheek. “I didn’t think I’d miss them.”
John snorted. Sherlock’s leg pressed against his, and felt incredibly welcome. “It’s difficult to explain.” He took the card back. “It’s like… my whole life, I’ve been able to trick everyone into thinking I’m something I’m not. And when the truth came out… no one really carried on treating me like they had before. Except you,” he added, blushing.
“I haven’t ‘got’ John,” Sherlock sighed, swinging his legs over the sofa. “He’s not my
There was more laughter, and, to Sherlock’s delight, a few ‘oooh’s to declare him the winner of that particular exchange.
John knew why – the bullying had made Sherlock question their relationship, and, as he was getting older, he would be throwing up barriers to try and stay his own person for as long as possible. The boy still showed no signs of going into heat, and his sixteenth birthday came and went without a hitch, and John was grateful for it. Now, more than ever, he was unsure what they would end up being to one another.
But it didn’t.
But it didn’t.
"Please don't molest me in the night," John yawned, before he went to sleep.
Sherlock nodded, breaking their eye contact. “I am sorry.”
“I promise to take care of you, John,” Sherlock said, as he kissed John on the top of his head.
Sherlock’s eyes shone, and he puffed out what could only be described as a sigh of relief. “Me… me, too,” he whispered. “Thank god, I – I thought I was going mad.”
“Which were?”
He sighed, and put down his book. It was very strange, having someone else in the flat. And a teenager, at that. John didn’t have any experience with young people outside of medical work, and he didn’t want to mither Sherlock into feeling like John was his parent, but at the same time John wasn’t going to change his mind about mating with him. They would have to find middle-ground as friends, more or less.
“Fuck,” John almost laughed. “About halfway, if you must know.”
Sherlock yelped, the stretch immediately aching and painful, but he couldn’t dream of telling John to stop, now. This was what he needed – what his body was craving. A touch of love, of sheer closeness and intimacy. Not a stretch to fit a cock inside just to start a heat. Not mating or breeding. Just… making love. Two men, in bed together, touching one another, because they were in love.
“I don’t…”
John looked up, feeling all the blood in his face drain down to his stomach, where it turned into a stone. “Oh. Afternoon, Mycroft.”
Violet didn’t say anything. Her face was curiously blank.
Sherlock grit his teeth as John vanished into the underground. John was
Once, when he was high as a kite, just taken cocaine, and he started writing an epic email that explained what it meant to be transgender, and how that applied to him, and how he was so in love with John, wouldn’t John just accept it?
“…yes.” Sherlock looked back up. “Oh. Oh, come here,” he gathered John up in his arms, and they locked together face to face, gently moving together as their friction rocked their baby to sleep.
“Sherrinford, what’re you –”
John peered closer at the glossy image. “What am I –”
“Until secondary, yes… We should start looking at schools soon,” his father drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.
“Slept well, did you?” Mycroft sniped, carrying his morning tea-tray.
“Through some arrangement out parents made without our consultation,” John said gently, closing his hands over Sherlock’s. “If we’re going to do this… now, in the future, whenever… I want it to be something we’ve both chosen to do. Not something we do out of obligation.”
‘You could have held it in.’
John made a show of coming back into the lounge. “Everything ok?”
Sherlock let out an alpha snarl of frustration, and fucked up against John harder, making the man push back, forcing Sherlock onto his back as John straddled him again, taking them both in hand.
John stared back. “Um. The wound. In that man’s back. It’s an exit wound.”
John had never been happier he’d refused scent blockers. He felt pleasant shivers run over his skin, and warmth blossom inside him as Sherlock kissed him, the kisses moving back to his mouth, John accepting them happily, moving his hands to Sherlock’s waist, chancing touching below the belt.
, a nasty little voice in Sherlock’s head added.
Her tiny toes flexed.
John has guilt, Sherlock is worried, and Mycroft is on the scene.
“I don’t,” Sherlock shoved the man in the chest. “My mistake. I don’t know her. I got the wrong house.”
“It is ok, really,” Sherlock’s hands ran up John’s arms, touching through the wool, holding on for a moment. “I don’t mind.”
“How much of a shock could it be? He knew there was a chance, surely?”
John started automatically rubbing Sherlock’s back, but the omega swatted him away.
The driver leaned out the window, his eyes darkening. “Get in, omega, I’ll take you where you need to go.”
They’d gone a bit further with one another in the days since the university bombshell had dropped, as if they could override the universe simply by making love to one another. There was an ease to what they did, now, verbal consent giving way to simply
“Yep,” John licked his lips nervously. He’d come for his medical on his own, though Sherlock knew it was happening. The alpha had declined to accompany him, choosing to flounce out of the flat, instead, in a whirlwind of alpha scent and annoyance.
“I think it’s normal not to love someone you haven’t met yet.”
Victor nodded. “Thought as much. I heard through a colleague there was an omega man in who’d delivered early, something about his mate’s sister… You don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure that out.” He looked at the cot. “Is that her?”
“I can’t just make them- ” John stopped and laughed as the baby pressed a foot against their father’s hand. “Oh, maybe I can make them move on demand.”
The student’s face flinched, just a touch. “Is this about Holmes?”
“I’m here to give
John could only let him go.
“Struggling to get a grip on things? That’s the price to pay, I’m afraid.”
Only… John wasn’t sure where Sherlock fit in his definition of a friend, anymore. He missed him deep-down, in his bones. Sherlock was who John thought of when someone said the word ‘friend’. But now, he was who he pictured when someone mentioned ‘omegas’, too.
“You want me, I – I see it all the time, in your eyes, in your body…” Sherlock glanced down at John’s still-obvious erection. “You could just have me. I – I’ve shown you I’m clever, I’m… I’m no longer with…”
Sherlock dripped some solution into a petri dish, and put it under the microscope.
Sherlock lowered his head, tear-tracks visible on his face. “…what?”
"And where would the extra bedroom be?"
‘Oh, fffff…..’ John bent back over.
But he never got the rest of that sentence out. Because Sherlock moved, quickly, and planted a kiss right onto John’s mouth.
Sherlock just nodded, staring at the screen as his baby’s side-profile filled it. “It’s got your nose, John.”
John looked up.
“Stop fishing,” Sherlock sighed. “I just… it’s a big thing for me. Even just a kiss. It’s a big thing.”
Sherlock was going to die.
“You need to stay still,” John said again, bringing it over. The silver burn was still creeping up Sherlock’s arm, halfway to his elbow. He needed to stop it in its tracks. He tore off strips of kitchen paper, and soaked them quickly in blood before applying them straight to the burned and decaying flesh.
Sherlock shook his head. “Mummy used to buy cakes from the bakery. She was never a good cook, that’s why we had staff. I didn’t realise cake that was handmade could be nice, until I was older, and went to a few birthday parties…” he picked at a thread on a cushion. “Not that we went to many. We weren’t exactly popular children.”
John rolled his eyes. “Fine. I’ll get my room-service sundae, you get in the bathroom,” he pushed Sherlock away. “Christ, I hope you know what you’re in for.”
“Thank you.” He rubbed his nose. “Um… I’ll see you in a bit? I don’t think I’ll be long…”
Sherlock carried John into his – their – bedroom. John was weightless in his arms, as he ever was. Sherlock’s strength meant that John was, and always would be, like a china doll compared to him. Sherlock was capable of crushing the man into a heap of bone fragments, or tearing his throat out, or punching straight through his chest like wet cake. He could kill him in any number of different ways.
Sherlock stared at the man, then shrugged. "Because I'll be gone soon, I suppose. I suppose once every five hundred years it's all right if someone knows a little about me."
“No…” Sherlock settled back as John chased through the channels, eventually ending up on some programme about ground-breaking science and research in medicine. It was something they would both enjoy staring at.
“Oh! What’s her name?”
This place, this flat, had been somewhere to stay. And it had turned into a refuge, a haven, a love-nest if you wanted to be slightly creepy. Somewhere John enjoyed being, with an alpha who listened and understood him, who was handsome and kind, and clever and annoying… and John would never find another one like him.
Sherlock slumped to one side as if he’d lost his balance.
John looked up, guiltily. Sherlock pressed his lips together, a pink blush creeping up his neck.
“Mummy,” Sherlock choked out, his hand still doing damage to John’s joints. “Mummy, you… you told me I had to find a mate. You told me I had to. Look – look at my neck!” he wrenched his hand free, and yanked down his collar, exposing the ugly bite-mark. “This is what an alpha did to me when he learned that. To try and get me to present omega. Have you any idea?”
Sherlock laughed. “You don’t like odd numbers.”
Sherlock let out a soft moan. “John…” He licked his lips apart, and John could see the
He pulled on his dressing gown, and got out of bed, creeping out of his room and down the stairs. The house was all in darkness. He undid the back door, and slipped out into the garden, lifting the wobbly bit of fence he used to sneak into John’s garden. It was a quick (though cold) climb up onto the wheely bins, and then up onto the conservatory roof. It was a little difficult in his slippers, but he managed to steady himself, and tap on John’s window.
John sat up. “What?”
Sherlock nodded. “Someone I… used to know. It’s his style.”
That was true. John’s school cost a lot of money, and included lessons about manners and etiquette – lessons John’s sister did not have, and she mocked him for them.
“John Watson,” the medical examiner said, looking over his glasses at him. “Eighteen, unbonded omega…”
“They might bond with me, and then I’d be trapped with them…” Sherlock looked up. “If you matured right now, you could bite me and bond with me.”
“Hey,” John looked up from his book, going red, as he was sure Mycroft could smell sex in the air, even though John had insisted on opening all the windows and washing the sheets in the aftermath of their morning frottage. “You ok?”
“Ok.”
‘Her dad just went to the café, he should be back at any moment.’
“We met at Bart’s.”
The policeman sighed, looking him over. “How old are you, lad?”
omega forced into a bond. Sherlock, if he is one, or one who would end up as Eurus’ mate. It is a situation we must avoid at all costs.”
Sherlock snorted. "Thank you for that history that I certainly did not ask for."
Until Pixie opened her mouth and squawked like an angry goat.
Sherlock saw the bite. Couldn’t prevent it. The scent of John’s blood hit his nostrils. He crashed into Moriarty a moment before the vampire vanished, and reappeared behind him, holding John, bleeding in rivulets…
Cam nodded. “What else would you like to know?”
“Not at all,” the man smiled. “Thank you for making time to come to me. A silly request.”
“I…” Sherlock stopped as the sound of John’s shower clunked off. “I don’t know,” he whispered.
“We will talk,” Melody said. “It won’t be quick, John, but we will keep on at this, for as long as you need. Your feelings are valid, and reasonable, and you dealt with what happened to you as well as you could. You were such a brave boy, and you are a man I very much admire. Do you feel ok to leave this room?”
Sherlock blinked, and realised John was no longer hitting him. He tested his jaw, and found it could move. His head hurt, but touching it revealed it was the shape it should be, at least.
He pulled a face.
“I wanted to discuss this,” Sherlock rolled up his right sleeve and planted his forearm, palm up, on the desk.
John’s hips rolled up, and Sherlock felt the much larger erection press against him. He pressed back, the two of them working into a sort of thrusting rhythm, back and forth, John’s pants being worked down so the pink head of his cock was exposed.
Sherlock would have given everything not to blush at that point, but he did. “Take a wild guess.”
John raised his head slightly, looking straight into Sherlock’s eyes.
It was only when he got home that night that he realised what going to college would actually mean.
“You don’t need to be sorry,” Sherlock said softly. “I… I have no idea what to say to make you feel better. I have no idea how you feel. I can only promise to listen to you.”
“Nope,” Sherlock popped the word out of his mouth.
“You’re upset,” Sherlock said. He leaned back.
‘It feels weird,’ John said. ‘I bite things differently, now. Like, biting into an apple? That’s different. And it’s, like, stronger?’ He looked at Sherlock, who had a weird expression on his face. Somewhere between nervousness and admiration. ‘It hurt so much when they grew in,’ John said, trying to get away from talk about biting. It made his insides feel funny.
John’s heart swelled so rapidly he thought it would burst. Everything he’d not felt during his pregnancy – every lack of connection, every worry was swept aside at the sight of the man he loved holding a newborn baby. John’s hormones went berserk, and he held his arms out to reach for his baby, his throat tight.
James brought John’s coat through. “Have a good one, John. Looking forward to seeing the photos.”
, Violet’s warning sang in John’s head.
“Jesus Christ.”
Sherlock nodded, though he wasn’t sure what he was agreeing with.
John went over to the sofa, taking Sherlock into his arms, forcing him to stand. “Sherlock, look at me, sweetheart. Please?”
Siger laughed gently. “No, no, that’s their boy. Their youngest. Michael and David are the couple. They were asking about you, actually.”
John barely registered his feet moving away, from the doorway. “Sherlock…”
“No, it’s… fine,” Sherlock looked at him, blinking some of the cloudiness away from his vision. The young doctor was blushing slightly, his ears redder than his face. He glanced at Sherlock, again.
Victor leaned over the cot, and smiled genuinely at the baby. “God, she looks like Sherlock,” he said softly.
He typed:
John looked up from the letter at Mycroft’s slightly bemused face. “This is my new school?” He looked at the prospectus. “It looks like Hogwarts.”
“I didn’t forget how to,” Sherlock shrugged. “It seems easier to, when you’re around.”
“That wasn’t what I was…” Sherlock waved a hand as if John’s words were in front of his eyes. “I have something to do, this afternoon, and… medical eyes might be helpful.”
'Sprogging' is what happens to a necktie if it is yanked at one end whilst around someone's neck. It usually causes a tight knot that isn't easily undone, and the tie might have to be cut off from around the wearer's neck entirely.
“Oh god,” Sherlock whispered, John hearing him perfectly.
Sherlock leaned, and John melted against him like wax.
John smiled, and inched closer, gently running his finger up Sherlock’s arm, memorising the touch of him, remembering their closeness of the night before.
“I agree,” Sherry nodded. “It’s just a case of guarding what you say. She’s… she can be harmless, if she chooses.”
Victor frowned, but his little smile remained. “You know Eurus?”
But not answering the door, which was pretty bizarre.
“Get the
John took his hand, then thought again, and went in for a hug, feeling Greg tense in surprise before patting him on the back.
“No,” Sherlock patted his pockets.
John brightened, and grinned, showing too-big front teeth he hadn’t grown into, and a couple of gaps besides. “Are you coming out to play?” he asked.
“Oh.” John blushed, and grinned. “Right.” He undid the coke bottle. Sherlock watched his hands, the way the skin bunched up against the plastic bottle-cap before it turned, the dirt in his finger-creases, the fine blond hair on his wrist.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock woke to a horrible burning smell. He sat up immediately, hand to his nose, eyes flying wide as he saw what was causing it.
Sherlock laughed softly. “Oh, well, in that case…” he licked a stripe up John’s throat, making him moan. He scented quickly at the curve of John’s neck, before kissing the spot where his scent was strongest.
Sherlock tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair. He was screwing up the courage to say what he was thinking. ‘I think…’ he paused, then took a deep breath, ‘I think I might get bonded.’
“Good. Then, we can continue to work with him.”
Eurus went into heat, and this time Sherlock left with his older brother and father.
“What’s wrong, then?”
“It’s not stupid,” Sherlock tore his hands away, and wiped his face again. “It’s…” he took a shuddering breath. “You already have to put up with me not having a… And now you’ve seen what I used to…” his voice dissolved, and he started mouthing wordlessly.
war. "Yes. Sorry." He rolled his shoulders back. "Right. So... Where'd you want to start?"
“You’re – not going into - heat,” Sherlock said, haltingly. “Just… natural reaction to…”
“Sherlock!” Violet came out of the drawing room, and embraced him. “Oh, congratulations!” She kissed him hard on the cheek.
John smiled, just a touch. “You’re ok, then? With me going on… suppressants?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Trial at military court and then discharge and probably prison,” John shrugged.
And she snapped the gun forwards, and shot her father straight between the eyes.
“All babies have the same nose,” John sighed.
“Don’t say that,” Sherlock pushed himself off the door, hearing footsteps approaching. “You’ve barely scratched the surface, John.”
“Me?”
“It won’t kill me to have it dry-cleaned.” John pulled the clothes on and hung his towel up. He went out into the kitchen, and smiled at the sight of Sherlock making tea.
“I know it won’t,” Sherlock said quickly, the words digging painfully into his throat. “I know I’m going to die. But… it still doesn’t feel real.”
“Is this your first baby?” John didn’t even bother apologising as he put an ear to the omega’s stomach, lifting her dress out of the way. He could hear a gentle whooshing sound that wasn’t an adult heartbeat.
“You too,” Sherlock sighed, head rolling back as John kissed at his throat. He didn’t resist as John opened his collar buttons, and inhaled deeply at the patch on his throat that begged for a bite. John could feel a burning ache in his chest and groin, telling him to bite, to claim… but not now. Not now they were as close as this… Wait. Wait until Sherlock smelled like heat, like fertility and breeding… John rutted his growing against Sherlock’s thigh. Even the thought of that happening soon was doing a number on him.
John nodded, then sighed and changed the subject. "So, if it were up to you, you would talk to my parents, take me out a few times, marry me, then shag?"
“Ha. Alright for some, when you can turn down a free holiday abroad,” John rolled his eyes.
“Sorry,” Sherlock made to move his arm away, but John caught it.
John bit his lip as the place filled up to around two thirds full. Some young men had brought their parents with them, but most, like John, had come by themselves.
Sherlock scrunched his nose. "That smell is horrendous."
He hit John harder than he had ever struck anyone in his centuries of life. He felt John’s skull cave under his knuckles, and the vampire was knocked across the room, landing with a moan against the fireplace.
“Oh,” Sherlock blushed, for a moment. “It was close to the till. I, er… I didn’t think you had… It’s just…”
Cam kissed him.
John couldn’t help thinking it was all too surreal.
“Har har,” John rolled his eyes, thinking of how the alpha he knew who claimed not to be interested in omegas had almost attacked him. “No, he’s just a decent guy, that’s all.”
Sherlock came out of his room, and John wiped his eyes quickly. “I’ve put the rest in a bag, with the boxes.”
“Oh, ok,” John pulled some of the tape out. “Thanks.”
“Twenty… four weeks?” John said. “No. Five, today. Fifteen to go.”
John went over to him quickly. “Sherlock, why didn’t you lie down if you needed to?” He picked up Sherlock’s legs, noting how they were mostly bone, and swung them onto the bed before pulling his shoes off.
Lestrade sighed, and handed the file over. Sherlock’s wrist almost gave way with the weight of it, but he managed to steer the falling papers into his lap so that it almost looked intentional.
“Why would I not want to?”
“I’m so bored,” Sherlock groaned, heaving himself off the sofa, hands to his lower back. “I thought you said
Sherlock stopped, a lifetime of younger sibling conditioning making him give in. “What?”
“…a relationship?”
Justice Eyre made a note. “Thank you, Mr Mayhew. Miss Ali, can we assume your client also has a statement to make?”
John had to admit, he felt much the same way.
"I won’t. If you tell me no, I won't do it,” he amended. "It takes trust, and… you don't even like me." He released John's jaw, his hands instead feeling up John's firm torso, his fingertips raising red marks where they pressed into the skin. "It can enhance the experience, if you're open to it, but panic can cause fainting."
John closed his laptop. “You mean about Victor being there?”
‘Your smile has changed,’ Sherlock said by way of explanation of his noticing. ‘Not in a bad way, though. Just…’ he pointed at his own mouth, ‘looks more… adult.’
Cam raised his eyebrows. “You are asking me to influence the scholarship scheme?”
“I can’t smell anything, obviously,” Lestrade shrugged, “but to me, he still looks like a kid. If you’re hoping to rescue him, maybe don’t rush into anything?”
“I think you’d better, before you fall down -”
“Are you sure you’re an alpha?” he managed to slur as they broke apart for breath.
John couldn’t speak. His throat had closed up, and the baby inside him was kicking and stretching for his attention.
Sherlock smiled. “That man in the waiting room. The bald one. What was he arrested for?”
“Which means something burst out of him that was already there,” Sherlock slapped his own forehead. “Ow. Look – they were together, the two men, maybe they were hugging or something, I don’t know, but whatever was inside the first man is somehow triggered, and it shoots out of him and straight into the second. This steel bolt. That’s is. It has to be.”
John shrugged, the picture of innocence. “We share a flat, it’s going to happen.”
Mycroft went purple. “That’s… What in God’s name were you
Unluckily for Sherlock, the next day was the first day back at school. He got himself up, and found an empty sofa in the living room. A note from John on the counter read:
“It’s not a sleepover until someone’s sick.”
They were made for each other.
“Yes, but that was a relationship arranged with the help of your father,” Tabitha pointed out. “Was that consensual on all sides?”
John sat up in bed, listening to Sherlock brushing his teeth. He heard him wretch a few times, and a nag grew at the back of his mind. Sherlock had acted strange all evening, curled up on the sofa, grumbling and barely speaking, not eating, only drinking sips of water…
John woke early the next morning. He rolled onto his back with a sigh, and waited for the weirdness to wash over him.
There was no reply, but he heard the wardrobe door close upstairs, in John’s room. He hadn’t left yet, then.
“Get out,” John gasped, hand moving to his aching cock. “Get out, quickly. I might hurt you…”
The spare room was stripped, no bedding on the bare mattress, the curtain drawn over the window.
“Sherlock…” John looked back, fear showing on his face. “Sherlock – Sherlock, I –”
‘You’re the only other boy here, so it means a lot to me.’ Joseph looked out across the Swiss slopes. ‘I’ve broken it off. I can’t keep seeing him, even if he was my first. It’s too dangerous.’
Later, in the ambulance, John would realise they hadn’t said
“Heats? A few days. Maybe a bit longer, since you’re… late.” John kissed his shoulder. “Are you ok?”
A pigeon flew past one of the windows, disfiguring the street-lamp’s orange light into a flurry of shadows, unseen by the flat’s occupants as they lay in bed, wrapped around one another.
"I really can't," Sherlock said, starting to sweat. If he leaked through his trousers...
John couldn’t survive on just love. Love, and domesticity, and heats and children before he was twenty. He needed academic stimulation – he got very high marks at school – and he needed to be able to help people. It was what he had always wanted.
Sherlock put his pencil down and tried to loosed his collar a little. It felt chaffing. In fact, all his clothes felt chaffing. He felt twitchy and hot, and…
“I know,” Sherlock forced out. “I know it does.”
“I am far more noble,” John nodded. “Thought it might be this week, actually. He was a bit off this morning, but I’ve not heard from him. He’ll probably come home with a stinking cold.” John went for his phone.
“Sixteen.”
Mycroft glanced about the wreckage as if seeing it for the first time. “…I understand.” He cleared his throat. “Let us at least take up residence at my house. We can… discuss dinner options later.”
John laughed. “I love you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock lowered his hand. “John…”
“Bonds can break.”
John flicked through the books, and for the first time felt oddly sick. He could one day be reading these stories to his children. His and Sherlock’s. He closed the book with a thump, shuddering. They were a long way off doing anything like that. Sherlock hadn’t moved to touch John below the ears, and John almost hoped he never would. The ghost-touch of Siger Holmes had never quite gone away.
“Thank you,” John said loudly. “Amy, where does it hurt?”
“Christ, that’s Sherlock in a nutshell,” John wiped at his eyes. “One previous action determines all future responses. He’s not as clever as he thinks he is. Or as other people think he is.”
“As in…?” John glanced deliberately at Sherlock’s cock as it strained harder against his trousers.
He smiled to himself at the bus stop, flicking through the green booklet.
“Please – please don’t cry,” Sherlock reached out, then held his hand back, as if John was dirty.
Sherlock piped up. “They’ll write it off as teenage mood-swings, Mycroft, you know they will. Courts are biased against omegas. John needs more than one witness. Even if you are an alpha, you’re the one they’re accusing of kidnap.”
“Then… you must know Sherry, and Mycroft?”
“Unless you pulled the trigger, you’re hardly to blame for that one.”
He felt over the creature's nipple, attaching a sucker gently to one, and feeling the skin change beneath it. The land-walker gasped.
Sherlock smiled, just a shade. “That might be nice.”
“Come on, gay boys,” someone crowed. “Get a move on!”
“Just tell Lestrade I’m here!”
The was a bang to the door that made John jump. “Captain Watson?”
“I know,” he said, spreading the spoons out. “It doesn’t matter.”
John stared.
The bond that John had shoved down, out of sight for so long, had tried to ignore, tried not to let take over him as he lay crying in bed on those nights alone in the barracks… ignited. It was as though connections were being forged in his brain where they’d previously been halted. It was as though by walking away that morning six years ago, John hadn’t let his mind fully adjust to what it meant to be a bonded omega.
His fingers tingled.
There had been daylight, and moonlight.
“You smell so ready for me, John.”
The alphas all exchanged glances. There was a silence.
John’s face shut down. “Fine,” he said. “Nice to know where you stand, Sherlock. I never thought you’d be so selfish.”
“But what am I meant to
“John…” he said, his voice much closer to normal. “John, please tell me you’re on the pill?”
Then Sherlock rolled his hips, out and in, and John knew almost nothing else, as dark pleasure bloomed inside him, blanking out his mind, chasing a peak he came to long before his mate did, but finding a second even as the alpha’s pace became a snap of the hips that drove into the omega with months and years of unslaked lust.
John clicked his tongue. “Maybe we don’t have to give this a label or anything. We can just… see how things go. Like we were doing before?”
It was hateful that Cam stole even a single day from him. John burned with hatred for a moment, then turned over and tried to empty his mind.
The sound of his name made John feel strange, but there was no time to dwell on it. "I... I need to go home. I need to get to shore. The shore?" John looked around the cave for something to help him explain, but there was nothing but bare rock and puddles. "God above, this is frustrating."
“Honestly?”
Sherlock just nodded. ‘I came out this way to get out the house. Mummy’s in bits. Mycroft doesn’t know what to do with himself. It’s all going wrong.’ He sniffed, and brushed at his eyes, frowning. Then wrapped his arms tight around himself. ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen.’
“Yes, I…” John covered his mouth as he started crying. “I was just coming to see him, I…” he checked the towel. “Fuck, it’s bleeding through, Jesus Christ, how long is this ambulance going to be?”
“Fucking hell.”
John’s smile twitched. “Old flame?”
“I don’t expect it to be,” John said. “I… I could never expect it to be. On some level, I’m actually glad you found someone to love, as much as it hurts me to say that. I’m glad you weren’t alone.”
John covered his eyes. He felt as if he was skirting on the edge of something dark, and so utterly tempting. He tried desperately to keep his hips still as Sherlocks hand began to move, loosely over his cock, moving the softer skin over the erect flesh beneath, torturously. Each stroke was like a shock of electric heat running over his groin, and prickling up his body.
John touched Sherlock with his free hand. “Sherlock… I…”
you start – Quinlan, I don’t care if your book’s been on fire, you’re going to have to find a clean page…”
“And I am?”
John raised his arms to hug Sherlock, then hesitated.
“I’m here with my family,” Mycroft said, looking unfazed at the comment. “That’s enough.”
Mycroft looked up, sadly. ‘I thought you might say that. Candidate in mind?’
“Sorry,” Ryan said. “I have a fiancé, but he’s younger than me. Mum wants me to go on scent blockers. But… you know. I like a few guys at school, and… I don’t know. Seems like Quinn got the happy ending, even if he is fifteen.”
John tried not to show how angry he was with Victor, instead turning his rage into affection, and kissing Sherlock firmly on the head. “Sherlock, look at me? I get it. It’s fine. You can say
A shudder ran through John.
John smiled. “Oh, thank god.” He untied his robe at the waist, and let it fall to the ground, exposing himself completely, and watching Sherlock’s eyes go as round as saucers as he saw what sort of fate he’d let himself in for.
John accepted the water handed to him, and barely noticed as the sick-bin was carried away after he spat into it. His head was swimming. “He knew. He knew, and he never said, and he tried to get me to…” he shuddered. “Oh god…”
"Sherlock," She greeted happily, pulling the vampire down for a kiss to his cheek before doing the same to John. "And you must be John. Sherlock told me you'd be coming so I've stocked the refrigerator upstairs for you and started a pot of tea."
“Don’t say sorry,” Sherlock said. “Please. I don’t want you to be sorry. I… I love you.”
“Watson-Holmes?” Sherlock asked, after John read out the draft of the letter he’d sent to Sherrinford. “You never changed your name.”
Had it not been for John.
John took a deep breath, before answering. “I told you,” he said, “either is fine.”
They’d arrived to find Victor was, thankfully, packed. His cases were in the lower hallway, and there were a few boxes on the landing. John had to admit he felt relieved, though the scent of Sherlock mixed with a strange beta man lingered so heavily in the air he could feel it bringing his morning sickness back on.
John nodded, looking at the pictures of the premature baby nursery, the family rooms, the swimming pool… “Thank you, Uncle Mycroft.”
“You’re asking me to give you up again!”
“John is coming home with me, where he belongs,” Sherlock said. “You’ve caused enough damage. I admit that hormones may have played a significant part in this… obsession of yours, but this has to stop. You are not your feelings, James Sholto. Don’t let what you can’t have tell you what to do.”
“Emergency services, what service do you require?” the switch board picked up immediately.
He went into a church, a few weeks after Christmas, and went over to one of the candle-stands, and lit a candle, thinking of John as he did so. He was aware he was being watched by the vicar, and decided not to linger in case he was engaged in conversation. He was certain that John, if John was real after all, would appreciate the gesture nonetheless.
James smiled sadly. “There’s a smoothie bar I know that isn’t too far.”
John took his coat from the peg, and tossed it to him. “I’ve heard the botanical gardens are lovely at this time of night.”
“…Lestrade?”
Greg nodded. “When did Sherlock find out?”
“Mm, thank you,” John said back.
“Fuck,” John breathed, holding tight onto Sherlock’s arms. “Oh… God…”
He eventually dragged himself out of bed just after seven, and set about getting something to eat. He was just considering boiling water on the hob for tea, to avoid the kettle noise, when Sherlock appeared at the sink, filling the kettle with water.
“What – now?” John asked.
Cam’s words swam around Sherlock’s brain, just like the fish.
“You know who sent you that powder?”
And felt… ok about it.
“John Watson rode with you in the ambulance. He kept pressure on your wounds until paramedics arrived, and he has not left your side since you were admitted. He’s only not here now because I made him go and find something to eat,” Mycroft’s ears went red. “You are luckier than you realise to have him as a friend.”
Sherlock looked up at his dad, who looked as if he was torn about something. “Dad…”
John’s scalp prickled.
Lestrade patted Sherlock on the shoulder. ‘I get it. We’re all soaked in it, in alpha supremacy. We should be past all that shit but we’re not. We should all be able to be who we are. If John feels he’s a beta, he should be allowed to live as one. If you hurt an omega, you should face the consequences. But what can we do? We’re just two blokes.’
Lestrade flexed his hands. “Don’t suppose you’ve got a first aid kit, have you?”
A wave rolled him into the air, crashing him down in a haze of painful bubbles. As John was shoved beneath the water, the more buoyant oar spiralled away, shooting out of his grip and whisked away by the current. And when John kicked to the surface, he realised he was in serious trouble. The rain was only increased, and visibility had dropped to only a few feet in front of his face - salt-water was stinging his eyes and skin, and he began to feel extremely frightened. His fear of drowning was giving way to his fear of freezing to death in the water before he could even get close to shore.
John blushed, the protectiveness in Sherlock’s words stirring something in his omega instincts. His mate wanted to look after him.
you are.”
“Calm down, darling,” her husband said. “They’re likely just coming to introduce themselves. We can call around properly once the vans have gone.” He opened the door –
“That’s a good thing, if you ask me,” Sherlock said.
“Mine,” John suddenly snarled against Sherlock’s throat, making the omega gasp and shudder at the possessive pheromones and powerful need rolling from the alpha beneath him.
John nodded, keeping his distance, but Sherlock was already coming forward with a hand held out to shake.
“Unsurprising, darling. What did you say to her?”
John almost said. Almost blurted it all out, right then and there. Then he glanced up. There was a group of alpha boys a few lanes down, obviously looking over at the omegas. One of them nudged the other, and made an obscene gesture. They laughed.
Sherlock couldn’t let him get to John, and start interfering with his mind, too.
“Fanks,” Sherlock said from inside the scarf. He watched as the alpha boy he’d seen earlier left the church with his parents. He didn’t spot Sherlock, but went over to Violet and Siger with his parents, who were both male. Sherlock’s mother and father smiled politely and said something, before both families moved on. “Who’re they?” Sherlock asked.
“Woah,” John squeezed Sherlock’s arms. “Woah, Sherlock, slow down. You’re… you’re scaring me. We don’t have to – to do anything you don’t want to do. That – that wasn’t why I called for you today! I just… I… like you.” John’s face burned. “You don’t have to like me.”
to. John was about to lose his senses. “I’m going to Mycroft’s.”
Tabitha inhaled sharply, and John screwed his hands into fists, knowing that it was all about to spill out. There were reporters watching the hearing, and they’d print this in the paper, and then everyone would know. They’d all know John let another alpha scent him for
“It was worth a try,” Sherlock grinned.
When John got home, he started up his computer, and wrote the email he’d been putting off.
The same man. But limping – injured. But not in the leg. Stress. Therapist.
John couldn’t speak for a moment. “On your birthday?”
“The difference is,” John said aloud, “you’re in a relationship with Victor. He loves you, and you probably love him. It’s not a quick thing I can expect you to drop for someone you haven’t seen for six years.”
He reached in, and fished out something very small, and very soft, and very white.
“Don’t inhale too sharply.”
Sherlock tensed. “What?”
The doctor stopped. “Miss Holmes is a murderer,” she said, her factual tone making John’s insides coil. “She is here because she is mentally unfit to stand trial. Since being in this establishment, she has repeatedly become a danger to herself and others. Twenty-seven staff members have resigned from working with her. Fifteen of those require ongoing therapy. If you believe Eurus Holmes is not dangerous, then I advise you to about-face from this hospital this instant, Mr Watson.”
“S’ok,” Sherlock breathed, looking down, and pinging the elastic waistband of John’s pants. “Can I..?”
Sherlock smiled. “I know.”
“God, really?” Victor dropped a hand to touch himself. “I didn’t…”
Switzerland was like a Christmas cake, all snow and frost and plastic-looking pine trees. But the school was warm, and you didn’t have to go outside if you didn’t want to.
John made to get up.
Soft breathing turned to laboured gasps as knees hit the floor.
Sherlock laced his fingers together, and pulled a
“Ok…” he said aloud. “Time for school.” Concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other, he walked up the path towards the school buildings, and probably would have made it to Maths where he could sit quietly and recover, if Ms Tressle hadn’t caught sight of him.
“Mycroft?”
It rang twice.
Sherlock shook his head at the empty space where his brother had been, then followed John up the stairs.
The colour disappeared from Mr Thorne’s face, and his eyes popped. To his credit, he didn’t deny it. ‘Joseph told you, I suppose?’
“Can we do it now?”
“God, I wish I could hate him – that beta,” John said. “I’ve met him. He’s… nice. He’s kind, and he’s not a bad person. He works in a pharmacy, helping people. You couldn’t make it up.”
“John…” Sherlock pushed him back gently. “John, I…”
something to him, and John had done as he said.
“To help you. With… this.”
“That’s understandable,” John said. “I’m not looking an apology, Sherlock, or even an explanation, it’s just… if I end up living with you, again… It has to be make or break. I can’t do anything stupid again, and neither can you.”
“I doubt it. Anyway…” Sherlock smiled, “better than the other way around.”
“I think so, why?”
me anything. I didn’t know about a sponsor for uni. I didn’t know about how alphas think. I didn’t know… no one tells me this stuff, they just expect me to know it, but you don’t. That’s what I like.” He could feel himself going very red.
“I don’t have to do a lot of things.” Sherlock propped the door open, and leaned against it, watching the corridor. “But I do them.”
Sherlock tried to be himself. But some things got under your skin.
John pressed his hands to the small swell between his hips, and felt a rush of tingles creep over his back, and down his spine, a sort of frightened anticipation. He suddenly wanted to cry.
“No.”
But Sherlock was already against letting John go. Letting his mate go might be more than he could bear.
John pushed the empty chest of drawers into the corner, and checked he had just enough room to open them before each drawer hit the wardrobe. It was a squash, but he’d measured up and it turned out that cots were bigger than he’d thought. He’d looked at Moses Baskets, but the guidance said the baby couldn’t stay it one for long, so he decided not to bother. He could put the cot beside his own bed with one of the sides down.
John's hands tightened on the steering wheel. The sooner this was over, the better.
“I’d probably cry a bit, but I’d get over it,” John said, filling the awkward silence with a bad joke.
Sherlock blushed, stroking his fingers loosely over the soft skin, watching in near-fascination as it moved over the hardness beneath, moving his hand to pull back John’s foreskin, exposing the pre-come soaked glans.
“Ok, ok. It’s just… if it’s safer to call the police, or anything.”
Mycroft came in, and John blanked his phone, reaching for the milk, instead. “Good morning, John.”
“Here,” Sherlock put a glass on the bedside table.
“…three?”
“His name’s Lestrade,” Sherlock let go of John and wiped his face with a hand. “He’s a police officer.”
“No, you’re not!” Sherlock insisted. “You’re kind and nice, and you’re not forcing me or hurting me… It’s just a different kindness to the one I was taught to expect.”
John felt useless, and worse.
John gasped as Sherlock fell sideways, the bike on top of him, with a
“Take a leaflet, boys, there you go,” the careers fair was in full swing on the first day of September. John and Ryan were the only two omegas attending Sixth Form, and they collected flyers as they walked through the hallways, not really paying attention to what was on them.
It wasn’t as though they were mates.
It didn’t matter.
“I don’t care,” John said. He watched the baby curl its back a little, then settle again.
Sherrinford glanced at him, but didn’t ask him to elaborate. It was probably for the best. John had been to another midwife appointment, and had been asked outright what he was planning on doing for contraception when the baby was born.
Sherlock stroked over his cheek with the back of his fingers, the barest scratch of fingernail tracing over John’s skin. Gooseflesh raised in the wake of the touch. “What are you afraid of?”
. Manor. John had only set foot in a manor whilst visiting National Trust properties. He knew Sherlock came from old money, but still… “I’m going to need to go shopping,” he said.
“But you live with him, how does that work?”
“Only in every other area of my lifffffff…” Sherlock bit down on his lip as John kissed his neck, teeth dragging over his skin as he continued to tease at the alpha’s nipple. This was all backwards. Sherlock was supposed to be in John’s place. Alphas were supposed to take charge, and yet here he was, being reduced to an uncommunicative mess by a few simple touches.
John grinned. “Good, it’s working.”
“So,” she looked up. “You can call me Melody, you don’t have to call me Doctor Smith. And what is it you would like to accomplish through talking therapy, John?”
“Sorry, Sherlock,” Greg said immediately. “Are you ok?”
John shifted against the pillow. “I’ll think of a name for her.”
Whether the fogging-up window gave him away, or whether Sherlock had a sixth sense he didn’t know, but John grinned as Sherlock glanced up, and his eyes widened.
“He doesn’t know,” John said, miserably. “I haven’t told him yet.”
“So… you ready for Christmas?” she beamed.
"Not in the slightest." John picked up his own laptop, and opened his emails. "Made any headway?"
“Carry on?!”
‘Almost time for a feed,’ Sherlock nodded at Birdie, who was stirring.
“Not whilst Victor is there,” John said. “No way.”
‘We’ll get you there,’ Mycroft said, pulling him into a hug. ‘I don’t know how, quite yet, but we will. This isn’t the end, Sherlock. I promise you – you don’t need to lock yourself into a bond.’
“Oi, this is a genuine shark-attack scar,” Sholto stuck his chin out. “Look, you can see the teeth-marks!”
“Try to look happy, darling,” she said, kissing him on the cheek.
John had to go down three steps at once, to hide the thump of his boots. His backpack was digging into his shoulders.
“Squashed fruit seems like the perfect way to follow up ruining someone’s relationship,” John sighed. “Let’s do it.”
But he could tell, just from the way Sherlock was holding him, that he didn’t know. He didn’t know what was going to happen.
John forced himself upright, and shoved the covers down his bed, picking Lucy up and putting her on his bed before she could really get going. The scent of her mother made her relax, and her dark blue eyes opened as she sniffed the warm, sleepy smell around her.
John licked his lips apart. “Did you… want a cuddle?”
“Well, here I am,” John gestured at himself in his three-day-old pyjamas, aware it was the middle of the day. “Take a good look.”
John nodded. “Well, thank you. For saying that.”
“I thought, perhaps… if you agree… you could move in with Mycroft, until 221B is… ready.”
John swallowed, his tongue flicking out after, licking his lower lip.
Something like resignation, and expectation.
John looked back at the table, and caught his dad staring at him. “What?”
“Do you like them?”
Sherlock stared. Then nodded, once.
“Thank you…” Sherlock carried on wiping the gel from himself.
Sherlock raised his hand.
“Last night.” Sherlock sighed. John could have sworn he leaned into his touch. “I didn’t realise it was bruising so badly. I didn’t have a mirror to look in.”
“What would you do?” John asked suddenly. “If they said… they didn’t want me. To join your family?”
Sherlock sat still for a moment, then reached over and took his hand.
Sherlock stared, and John’s internal prey-alarm started to chime, but he forced himself to maintain the eye contact.
John nodded. “Was he a bastard then, too?”
“I’ll risk it,” Sherlock decided, taking the warm cup and popping the plastic lid off. It was a hot chocolate. He tipped it down his throat quickly, his stomach groaning at the hot liquid, his insides shuddering at the sugar rush. “Ah,” he wiped his mouth, sighing at the half-empty cup. “Thank you.”
“Um…” John thought about the six weeks of being holed up in his room, doing his homework. He’d only really come out for meals, and to make a trip to the dentist by himself, though Violet had made the appointment for him. John had spent the summer reading; working his way through the library. He’d deliberately chosen to read through every medical dictionary, Sherlock’s A-Level Biology textbooks, and anything science-based he could get his hands on. It felt like a sort of petty revenge for having his future snatched away – they couldn’t steal his knowledge and memories, could they?
“Can you feel baby moving?”
He couldn’t help wincing at the idea of being a disappointment after all this.
“-but I can help you,” Sherlock ploughed on. “You don’t have to be like me, or like Moriarty. I can help you. You don’t have to do this alone.”
Sherlock dropped his own trousers, and John couldn’t help licking his lips at the tented underwear beneath. Sherlock saw him looking, and gripped at himself through his underwear, letting John see just what size of cock he was to be dealing with.
“It’s ok…”
“You want me safe,” Sherlock said dully. “Safe, and fed, and in school and bring home good reports like I’m your kid. That’s all you ever wanted.”
And inside.
John didn’t say anything. He felt quite in shock.
Sherlock nodded. “It’s weird.” His fingers were itching, his insides felt fluttery, and he wanted… he just wanted to not be stood in the doorway, and to… He bit his lip, glancing at John’s neck. He wanted to scent the alpha who’s den this was. He needed to. It was like trying to hold back a sneeze.
BRITISH ROYAL NAVY
“That’s one way of putting it,” Sherlock smiled. “He’s interfering?”
“Yes, but I know it would have hurt you –”
“What do you think happens when you die?” Sherlock blew smoke as he spoke.
On the afternoon of the day before they were scheduled to leave, John was collared by Sherlock in the crooked corridor that separated the bedrooms.
“I had to cut it with the art scissors,” Sherlock said tonelessly. “The end was burnt.”
“Not found a flat yet, sir?”
By the time the front door crashed open, thirty minutes later, John was crying.
“It’s ten, Sherlock.”
John smirked, and Sherlock’s mind immediately replayed all the times his teeth had sunk into John’s neck, their naked bodies pressed together in lust and desire, the taste of thick, rich blood filling his mouth as his cock filled John’s body, the two of them shuddering in multiple types of pleasure.
“It is, though. If you lose this –”
A pair of red eyes stared back at him.
John coughed, feeling thick mucus at the back of his throat suddenly dislodge, and make him heave.
Sherlock had to smile. “I know. Thank you. But… John did all the work. Still does.”
“As long as you like.”
He was just thinking about how to silently boil water for tea, when Pixie let out a cry.
Then, several things happened at once.
John put a hand to his chest, trying to ease the ache. He’d missed Sherlock so much. It had been easier to push the thought to one side than to try and deal with it. After the initial tears and shock, John had plunged himself into work and distraction. He hadn’t realised how much Sherlock’s absence had affected him. And when the omega stepped back into the flat, John’s urge to scent him had almost been overpowering. Thank god Sherlock had asked. John had been so close to pushing him down on the sofa and –
Sherlock blushed. “I want you.”
“Belong to him?”
Sherlock took a seat at one of the barstools. “Is this fast food?”
Was Sherlock a spy? Had he run off into the wilderness? Had he come after John? What the hell?
Sherlock went from red to white like flicking a switch, but luckily for him the boys took it as a joke and laughed at the absurdity of it.
“Hopefully she’ll get his brains,” John nodded.
“John...” Sherlock’s eyes glowed with hunger, though not entirely for blood.
Sherlock was down to one case file a day. His brain couldn’t think like it once did.
“Legally… but my sister said it can happen whatever an omega says.”
Sherlock stopped walking, and John’s instincts forced him to stop, too.
"Text me the specifics."
“- wanted to kill me, and now my body gets to do the honours.”
Sherlock shook his head, feeling somewhat thankful that it wasn’t him, this time. He was good at fighting, now – he knew how to use his skinny body to hurt people. It meant his tormentors stuck to verbal abuse rather than physical. That was much easier to block out. It only got loud at night, when Sherlock tried to sleep. He didn’t know how to turn off the name-calling that surfaced in his mind as he lay in the dark.
Familiarity was dangerous.
“No,” John kissed the bump. “It’s not a case of preferring you this way or that. You’re my mate, Sherlock. The man I loved before I bit you or slid a ring onto your finger. I love you now, aged nineteen, and I’ll love you when you’re ninety, if I’m still around.”
“Oh god,” John gasped, leaning over and kissing every bit of Sherlock’s skin he could reach. “Oh god, my Sherlock. My omega…”
Melody nodded. “Do you want to continue?”
Sherlock smiled. ‘Thank you. I know he thought a lot of you. Cam.’ The nickname, once so easily applied, now tasted sour.
Sherlock held back a snarl of desire. The things John was doing to Sherlock's self control were criminal. He kept on hand on the man's hip, and the other unbuttoned his own trousers, pulling them down quickly and unceremoniously before pressing his own length against John's, his hand squeezing them together.
“With… my body?”
us. We have nothing. No connection. Nothing. How could we have
Sherlock had been too desperate for blood to take proper aim. He was going to suffocate John, drown him in his own blood.
And still, Sherlock did not come.
“Yes,” John admitted.
“Well, it’s sort of a suit,” John shrugged, his eyes flicking down over Sherlock’s body, not even trying to be discreet. “Bad blazer, though.”
“Yeah.”
“Why were you there?”
“We’re not all emotionally constipated,” Sherlock shot back, but his eyes were glittering with good-humour. “Don’t you have paperwork that needs doing?”
Who was being taken to another omega. It wouldn’t matter how badly he said he didn’t want her. As soon as he inhaled the scent of her heat, he would want her, and her heat would kick-start his own maturity, meaning they could knot and bite and bond. He’d be as in love with her as he could be once this was over.
“Ok,” Sherlock smiled, as if he was in on a secret. “I don’t know what to choose.”
“No!” John darted to one side, but Mycroft made no attempt to grab him as John skidded under the table, drawing his knees up as he sat, trembling. “Leave me alone!”
Sherlock couldn’t help wondering if he was decomposing, or if he was simply deprived of blood. It was difficult to say. This was nothing he had ever seen before.
"I can. You don't believe me."
‘Is she alright?’ John asked, worriedly.
“How much I love you.”
“Sherlock,” he whispered, staring into nothing.
“I know,” Sherlock said. “I’m not trying to influence your decision, I just… liked it. And I thought you might like it, too.”
John looked at him. “You and your mate…”
“I would. I mean, I will,” John said, gasping as Sherlock bit the side of his throat, though not with fangs, not yet. “Jesus…”
Mycroft clicked his tongue. “Fancy having alphas falling for you left, right and centre. Honestly, Sherlock.”
“This! This… living situation. You cannot
Lestrade let out a sigh, and made to step closer, then stopped. His shiny shoes were scuffed on one edge, and the heel was worn down. He walked a lot. John gripped his own legs tighter, the acrid smell of on-edge alphas filling his nose.
“What… happened?” John touched his neck. “I think I passed out, or dreamed… I don’t know. How did I get out of there?”
“Maybe we’ll get you all the way home, next time?”
Outside the classroom, Sherlock found himself slowly relaxing. He felt like a tight-coiled snake that had been startled, and now was beginning to trust the space around himself again. Ever since he and John had parted ways, Sherlock’s world had felt grey and flat. Now, it was growing again. Not far, for the school was still a school and freedom came with conditions, but it was enough for him to begin to make peace with what he had decided to do with his future.
“I can see why you need those wings,” Sherlock laughed. “Look, stop trying to balance your legs. Put your balance in your stomach. Look…” he demonstrated how to keep one’s hips loose, but stomach muscles tensed. “Trust your own legs not to give way, and they won’t.”
Sherlock had always been quiet, and kind enough. And now he was snarling and raging and
But he could probably tolerate it for John.
, as a chew-toy, and nothing else.
“I know,” Sherlock smiled. “I am so sorry that things still exist to make you unhappy. I promise you I won’t rest until they’re insignificant, or gone altogether.”
In some way, that was a relief.
“Oh…” he stretched, feeling Sherlock’s hand on his stomach tense, then relax as he, too, started waking. John wriggled out of the covers, and limped to the bathroom as Sherlock started coming to.
“He must be very protective,” John said.
“No, Mrs Trevor will have a general anaesthetic, and we will come to tell you as soon as we know how the baby is.”
“Why would Mrs Hudson stop Sherlock reading my letters? That doesn’t make any sense.”
Victor nodded, and put his phone away. “Call me, yeah?”
It made John happy that he was alright with that, when he was around.
Sherlock returned it, and watched the teenage alpha go bright red before looking hurriedly back at his hymn-book.
Twenty-one weeks.
There was a moment of awkward undressing as they both kicked off their underwear, and Sherlock covered his fingers in lube as John settled back over him, this time no cloth barrier between them. Their erections pressed together in a heat that felt right, and John rocked against Sherlock for a moment, making the alpha swear under his breath. The thrust felt almost unnatural – John wasn’t designed by nature for thrusting and penetrating in the same way, and his hips were wider than a beta or alpha’s – but the fact he could do it, and feel that skin-on-skin-over-hardness thill made him dizzy.
“Just stop it, Sherlock,” John said, pressing his hands into his eyes. “Just… give it a rest. I don’t need you to protect me. I managed years in fucking war zones on my own. I don’t need you.”
“Well, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to find out,” John said. “And I’ll just listen to you. The yeses and the nos. I’m not in a hurry.”
“I’ve not had a heat,” John said, sadly. “I don’t know if I can, anymore.”
Conversation leads to annoyance, and revelation leads to anger.
The midwife went over to the presentation. “Now, this is obviously a woman giving birth. Let’s compare it to a man doing the same.” She pressed a button, and another image popped up beside the first.
“Yeah,” Sherlock moved, and felt John’s cock move with him, growing harder, trapped under Sherlock’s weight. “Am – am I squashing you?”
"Watson, back down." Major Sholto met Sherlock's gaze evenly. They stared at each other for a good ten seconds before the enormous man twitched his lip. "Very well. The captain will still be your escort. John, have a detailed report drawn up for every day. But, keep it to yourself. I won't see it until the investigation is over. Is that good enough for you, Bloodsucker?"
“God,” John turned his head, inhaling Sherlock’s scent like a drug, his own cock throbbing at the friction, but needing something else. “I…”
“Then… it’s back to Heaven.”
A growl crawled up John’s throat, and rumbled in his chest. He rolled his shoulders back, trying to gather himself as Sherlock went still – letting the alpha in the room see he wasn’t a threat. He was responding more easily, now, his growing mind and body recognising the threat an angry alpha could pose to him.
“Uh, really?” John groaned. “Can’t we do ties and not ties, or something?”
Unbidden, an image of John popped into Sherlock’s head.
John leapt up, and almost ran into the room. “That’s me. Sorry.”
“Have you… made your peace with it? The whole bringing up another alpha’s baby thing?”
There was a horrible silence.
Acting instantly, Sherlock shoved the limp mass of body up to the surface.
“This is an
John ordered them both coffee, and they went to sit down. “Would it bother you? If we went with that? I’ll be out of here before too long, and... if you do relationships... did you want to try it?”
“I didn’t get the message until today,” Sherlock didn’t sit down. He looked at John, sort of leaning over him, sort of perched on the bed, hands either side of John. “I’m so sorry.”
“John?!” Sherlock’s voice came from above, slightly high-pitched, as if he was about to be caught. The lounge door was shut, which was unusual.
Soon, Sherlock told himself, there would be more.
“Not really. Lestrade wants me to figure out how –”
John scoffed, and put his glass down. “Since you asked, the date was a bust. And yeah, it was a date.” His face fell.
“Knickers, you mean.”
Relief ran through John’s limbs.
“Pixie Rose Watson-Holmes,” Sherlock finalised.
Sherlock groaned at the scent, giving up on his buttons and tearing his shirt off, instead, coming over and touching John gently on his sweaty arm. “John, you smell so beautiful…”
It took John only seventeen minutes to find Sherlock, by which time he was on his second cigarette.
This Harry was slow, and tired, and sick-looking. She didn’t laugh, or try and tickle him, or chase him.
They made it to form group with seconds to spare, and took their usual seats at the front, fingers brushing beneath the desk, just once, before they got out their planners.
In John’s arms, the new baby gazed around at her worrying new world.
John nodded, and twirled his fork in his pasta.
“Davis,” Sherlock gave him a tiny smile. He inhaled again, cursing his underdeveloped sense of smell that couldn’t permeate through the scent of unwashed bodies and stale lager to find out if the people in the room were alphas, betas or omegas.
"Yes. I'd like for you to take Colonel Jane Mathers into custody, if you will. I would like to question her."
They had all the time in the world.
“I shouldn’t think that matters,” Sherlock murmured. “But it was only the first try. We can... try again.”
alpha, beyond his own good reason?”
Slowly, the agony dulled, and Sherlock felt a sweat break on his brow.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you do at - at your parents’?”
“You have got it, you just need to be confident enough to keep going,” John said to the tree-tops. “You’ll get there.” He unscrewed the top of his steel water bottle, and poured half of it down his throat. He looked up, at Sherlock in his stupid tight dressy shorts and top, his nice trainers ditched by the dust and muck in the woods, mud splashed up the back of his calf from the bike… John had to look away.
“I’m alright,” Sherlock smiled. “We don’t have to take turns.”
"Tell me, John," Sherlock demanded, biting John's earlobe. "Did he make you come?"
“What for? For having your… thing? Or… not being allowed over, anymore? Which, I’ve got to say, is working out great so far.”
He gave it another five minutes before deciding to go into his bedroom and crash about a bit, hoping to hear Sherlock make a noise in response.
Sherlock came into John’s room to find a sleeping John, and Victor Trevor holding Lucy with one hand, and reading a magazine with the other.
“He must be so…” Mycroft shook his head. “Get out now. I…”
Sherlock’s people were oral history-keepers. One member of the tribe was expected to remember all their records and stories, and to pass them on with regular re-tellings. But this… with this you could write down anything, and look back on it as much or as often as you liked. You could learn so much more, and even forget it, because you could always look back at the papers…
Sherlock inhaled again, the warmth spreading into his lungs. He could almost feel his bloodstream and brain thanking him for the nicotine. It had been his first addiction. Unlikely to be cured, since it was legal, and perfectly pointless to try, now.
‘You don’t understand!’ Sherlock half-heartedly thumped him. ‘You don’t understand, and you never will. Whatever I do with my life, it’s going to be shit. I can’t have what I want, I can’t do what I want because in the eyes of the fucking country you’re serving I am not a real person. I’m cattle. I exist to be looked at, and then to reproduce. That’s why I exist. I’m not a person – I’m an
“I hate him,” Sholto laughed, and John had to smile. “So, what, is it someone at school?”
“I said: Where is home?”
happen at school,” Sherlock said suddenly, looking up from his laptop, “you have to come and get me, straight away. Even if you’re at work.”
“God, please,” John grabbed back at the bedstead, trying to hold off some of the feelings building inside him. “Sherlock... fucking just... please...”
“Yes. He… He’s not like a normal bully, John. He’ll tell people, just because he can. He doesn’t want anything. Just to cause chaos and pain.”
He shook himself, trying to get the memories to fade off as he stepped into the hot shower, and started to scrub at his skin.
Victor watched them both, for a moment.
Molly stared at him. Her mousy brown hair blew in the wind, and her eyes were wide. “I… I thought we were… friends?”
John shook his head. “But… I’m not going to hurt him!”
John shrugged. “Nothing much. Just told her about the baby, put in a copy of the scan photo, and told her a few things about the army. Sherlock said it wasn’t wise to include anything overly personal.”
“Yeah.” Sherlock’s eyes stayed on the floor. His left hand was clamped over the right-hand side of his neck, and blood was soaking through his skirt. “I…”
John gagged, and turned his face away. "No. No, I'll be sick. Stop it."
“No, thank you,” Sherlock huffed out a breath as he shoved his pants down, kicking them in the direction of the laundry. “Uh…” he leaned on the sink for a moment. “I miss being able to bend.”
Cam snorted. “It’s the holidays. And Sherlock isn’t a child.”
“Poor kid,” Greg winced in sympathy. “Epidural, then?”
He didn’t want him.
John waited for the door to bang shut. “I’ve been asked to give you this,” he lied, and handed Victor a printed copy of the university policy for dealing with assault.
John bit his lip before answering. “Then I’ll always smell like a beta. Always look like one, as much as I can. Always pass as one ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I won’t be an omega, Sherlock. And I’ll have none of the…. omega-ness that comes with that. Is that… can you stomach that?”
“What I mean is, not everyone is like your family. And not everyone is like me,” Cam said. “There are people out there who look at you – who will look at you – like meat. They will want you, as soon as those hormones get going. It’s not your fault, it’s nature, but you have to be responsible.”
summer,” the surgeon said. “And you’re not at school. Four weeks, Sherlock. No binding, no sports bras. You need to heal.”
But at that moment, with Siger Holmes scenting his virgin throat, he learned there was a third option: Freeze.
John exhaled, and actually leaned forward, to rest his head on Sherlock’s chest. But the alpha stood, and John had to catch himself, feeling strange. Had he
John surveyed him, taking his time to look over the alpha’s head, face, neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, hands, fingers, chest… down and over every surface and body-part, making Sherlock very aware that he had nowhere to hide.
But there was nothing for it. If John didn’t help him, he could lose his hand. He took a deep breath. “Ready when you a-”
But the mental image of being pregnant was surprisingly comforting. John imagined himself all round and soft, full of Sherlock’s babies, his alpha’s hands on his taut skin, his kiss at his bond-bite.
?” Mycroft asked.
“I’m a boy, I’m your son,” Sherlock said, tears escaping, now. “I’m not telling you this because I’m seeking attention, or… I just want you to know. I’ve always known. I’m not a girl. I can’t… not be myself, anymore.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t know anymore.”
He caught the eye of the speaker, and his mouth dropped open.
John glanced down at himself.
“Sherlock… you’re…”
“You went to the antenatal classes.”
He stared at the wooden thing, having half a mind to kick it across the floor.
John smiled, and came over. “Have a nice one?”
, the voice sing-songed.
‘U’ meant ‘unpresented’.
A newspaper seller folded up a sandwich board and threw it into the back of his van. Sherlock caught sight of the word
“Because they could say no!” John stepped forward. “They could weigh up the pros and cons and decide they don’t need the hassle.”
John wrenched open the door.
“I need to see her,” John said, ignoring him.
There was no sign of Eurus as Sherlock and John ate toast and marmalade in the kitchen the next morning. Mycroft was leaning against the counter, looking as if he hadn’t slept for days as he typed on his laptop.
There was a heavy silence.
shining in his eyes in the gloom. A throb of hot desire went straight to John’s cock, and John had to shift again to hide the twitch, the scent of his arousal permeating the room.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
"No," Sherlock said. "No, I don't need the light."
John had spent the evening in tears, crying in the dormitories, his soul in agony as he felt the bond he had with Sherlock throb, like a golden cord connecting them both, refusing to go away, refusing to hurt less.
" - can wait," Sherlock said, baring his teeth. "
He flinched, and turned to see Cam watching him from the doorway.
John didn’t remember much of it, taking a few notes on his pad about deployment (scary) and physicals (he was fit enough, he was sure), and pensions (for old people, surely?). He didn’t hear anything about the Royal Medical Corps.
She put on her reading glasses. “… ‘The inclement weather made it difficult for officers to take a sample from the asphalt. Detective Inspector Dimmock reported that…’”
“I was being careful,” Sherlock looked into the doctor’s dark blue eyes. “
Molly actually took a step back. “You… you left…”
John looked away. “It’s taken a lot of time for me to see what she was doing. Even when Mycroft brought her to yours, that day… she told me I didn’t deserve you. It was like she was undoing months of therapy in just a few words, I can’t explain it.”
Victor half-collapsed into a chair in the waiting area, and John got them both coffees from the machine.
Sherlock looked at him, and, for an instant, John thought he could see a little sparkle of interest. “Maybe tomorrow. I’m tired.”
How could Sherlock even ask that question?
“Well, that’s good.”
John’s breathing was ragged, the loose grip on his cock driving him mad. “Sherlock,
“Fucking hell,” he clamped a hand to his chest as he looked at the vampire standing at the foot of his bed. “Who’re you?”
John let out a groan. "Fuck! Sherlock! I feel like I’m – ” John's words melted into swear-filled moans as Sherlock’s fingers finally rubbed against his prostate, and his tongue pressed against the head of his cock.
“Why didn’t he answer my calls?” John asked.
“You ok?” He leaned in to scent, then stopped.
“Right, then. Clean slate. And next time, let’s actually finish our dinner, right?”
And Sherlock had chosen not to come.
"What if this weekend takes a... turn?"
“Sick to learn the truth, Holmes?” James spat.
“Everything.” Sherlock stuck his chin out.
The silence that covered them both was thick, and unpleasant.
John, settled back on Sherlock’s thighs, traced a finger over the thick and heavy length of Sherlock’s erection, the feel of his skin making the alpha tense, his cock twitching as John moved the skin over the achingly hard shaft, up to where the skin had pulled back to display a shine of rose, glistening and wanting.
Sherlock wasn’t stupid. John couldn’t have known what Sherlock had been going to tell him, and if he had known he would have been even more upset. John liked him.
John slammed his laptop lid down. Then regretted it, telling himself that giving in to alpha instinct was both immature, and pointless.
“Not like that,” Sherlock said. “It’s more… traditional alpha stuff. It’s not like this,” he put a hand over John’s. “It’s… more intense.”
John nodded, and Sherlock made a noise that meant he’d been listening before wheeling John into the wet area, and clicking the brake on.
“Sherlock, it isn’t that I don’t want you to have friends,” Siger said quickly. “It’s just… You and John are just on the cusp on growing up, and we might both be progressive households, but there are some things that alphas and omegas just can’t do.”
But John liked Sherlock as a boy.
Sherlock didn’t reply, but John could see him arranging his pillows in order to receive his snack in bed. The young omega looked glowing and healthy, his body curved and soft with pregnancy. Sherlock’s hips had widened, and his chest had gone slightly puffy along with the roundness of his belly. It would snap back to how it was before; he was young and fit. And they couldn’t be having another baby in a hurry. Though John had adored the changes Sherlock had undergone. He was never in love with his mate simply for how he looked, and he knew that, now. It was deeper than that – more honest.
John frowned. “I think you’re reading too much into this.”
“Yes?” a small, mousy woman peeped through the door. The chain was on.
“Could be ammonia,” Sherlock took it from him. “Either ammonia or cat urine.”
“She helped to poison Sherlock against me,” John said. “We know that much is true. I can’t forgive her for that. Or for things she said to me when I was little. I know it wasn’t her fault… but…” he pushed his drink away. “I still hear her, you know? Her, and your dad. I still hear them. Feel… him, sometimes. When Sherlock and I are… sometimes it doesn’t feel like Sherlock.”
“But…”
If he had killed him…
Sherlock, John tried to tell himself. Not just any omega. Sherlock. His Sherlock.
And everything went to hell.
John held his hands up. “Fine, but don’t come crying to me when you get blinded by my white skin, it’s not seen daylight for years.” Everyone laughed.
“Oh,” Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “Nothing like that. It’s just status in the family group.” He pushed John’s duvet off his face a little. “I’m at the bottom, so no change there. Probably why it’s not bothering me.”
Then he reeled.
“Take your time, Sherlock,” he said. There were lilac and black bags under his eyes.
John wandered away from the group hugs and photographs at the door, and touched the shiny body of the car, thinking about how fragile the machine was, really, under this thin case of metal.
“Yes.”
The fingers inside him scissored, opening him up, stretching his hole so his skin burned in pain. It was a good pain, though. The pain of being prepared, and it soon gave way to a different burn – one of pleasure that radiated from his entrance to deep inside him, and the tip of his cock, still throbbing in Sherlock’s mouth.
“Congratulations?” John put his bag down, and loosened his school tie. “What for?”
Sherlock brushed his hair out of his eyes, and licked his lips before moving in close to kiss John again, putting a tentative hand on the other boy’s hip.
Sherlock inhaled, feeling pain lance across his chest again. “Am I in a psychiatric unit?” he croaked.
Sherry was staring at John like he’d fallen out of the sky.
‘Oh, yes,’ Magnussen sipped at his sparkling water. ‘Apparently he was having an affair, with one of the students.’
,” the voice was closer, now. “Last chance. Fuck off.”
“Sherlock, go and choose what you want to keep,” John sighed, pulling the scarf down. “I’m not going to ask you to burn everything or erase years of your life. Go and choose what’s special.”
“Oh yeah? He was like a teenager with a crush. So were you.”
Sherlock arched his back, so his soft chest wouldn't touch Mycroft's flat one. He pressed his forehead against his brother's chest, and tried to steady his breathing.
“So… they don’t love each other?”
“No!” John held his hands up. “Fuck no. I…” he sighed. “I’m being realistic, here. I’m a bonded omega. I can’t have children with anyone except Sherlock. And this might be my only chance. If I got rid of this… I’d still have to have Sherlock come over for my heats. We’d keep making potential babies and I’d keep on not having them, and I don’t know how long I could keep that up. Seeing him every month or so, and the both of us leaving in anger again. This… might be my only real chance to be a mum. And I can do it on my own. I’ve got a job, and it might lead to something permanent. I’m a decent age, ish, and it just makes sense. I want this,” he put his hand on his abdomen, “but I’m not insisting anyone else has to be a part of it.”
Sherlock did, and a jolt of desperation and need followed in him. The vampire gripped at the nape of John's neck, his hair long enough now for Sherlock to hold as he hand John’s head fast, and sank fangs into the man's neck with no preamble.
“No, I’m – I’ve come on my own,” he said. He could feel the blush starting to burn into his face, even as the lie came out: “He had to work, he couldn’t get out of it.”
“You said… ‘we’.”
“Oh,” John raised them, realising this was the first time Greg had seen him without long sleeves on. “That’s, er –”
“Such a kind omega,” Cam said. He loosened his arms, indicating Sherlock should get up. “Very well. I’ll pull some strings, and see if there can be arrangements made. You’re certain he will want your help?”
“It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock dropped his hand. “Utterly ridiculous. I’m being punished for trying to –”
“And you’re not supposed to give a single shit!” John spat.
John’s bed was now
Mycroft went over to Sherlock like lightning. “
It seemed perfect.
“…did I pass out?”
If his theory was correct, and Eurus had been whispering things to Sherlock, it would take more than a simple declaration of
Sherlock looked at her again. “What – what do you mean?”
“You don’t know –”
Sherlock looked up.
Sherlock stepped back. He actually stepped back, as if he could avoid the words coming at him.
“London Ambulance Service, please state the nature of your emergency.”
‘Well, the law made betrothals illegal, but it couldn’t stop the shady dealings behind the scenes. Men with omega children might mention them in job interviews to their alpha bosses, to gain favour you see? Not a promise, more a sort of… incentive. Come over for dinner and met my family, they might say.’
“Fine.”
John inhaled slowly, the scent of Sherlock filling his lungs. Sweeter than ever. It was only the first real day of him being home and the place smelled so intensely of him that coming home had been like walking into a cloud of airborne candy-floss. “I’m just wondering if it’s… safe.”
Breasts. Curves. Nothing in those clinging pyjama bottoms.
John pecked him on the nose, and pulled him close. “We don’t have to do-”
“Kind of,” Sherlock’s mouth twitched, then dropped as if it was too much effort. His arms hung limp by his sides.
“I… Sherlock, I warned you,” John said, starting to well up, “when I was going to leave, I warned you I was going to… You knew I was leaving, you knew I was going into heat…”
Mycroft nodded. “And Sherlock has told you of our family circumstances.”
Lestrade bit his lip. “Do you think something happened to him?”
“- and is therefore entitled to several funds,” Mycroft quipped. “If you need any money –”
That wasn’t a new thing – he’d dreamt of Sherlock many times before.
John blinked. “When did you lie to me? This… is really none of my business, is it?”
“I’m not sure if it’s warm enough for a swim,” Sherlock looked at the pool in trepidation.
“Of course not –”
“I am asleep,” Sherlock whispered back. He glanced at John, and they both hid in their sleeping bags as they started laughing again. There was something delicious about sleeping in the same room, on the floor.
“Potentially, yeah,” John grinned again.
Inside… the thought made his knees weak.
“Are you going to be ill?” Sherlock asked as John paused, halfway up the stairs. “You’ve gone so white.”
He got Mycroft on the temple, this time.
‘No different from a wedding.’
“I know what we were doing… We probably would have ended up bonding, anyway,” Sherlock said to the tiles. “But he… he forced…”
He sighed, looking up. “Of course you didn’t.”
These lips were his, now.
“Mummy…”
“It doesn’t matter,” Sherlock said, his head ever so slightly on one side. “You did what you felt you had to do. For yourself.”
“…yes.”
“But,” John said, sensing it coming.
John frowned. “So you and… you never…”
“Get out,” John gasped, hand moving to his cock. “Get out, quickly. I might hurt you…”
The doors on the floor above opened, and the students started filing up and through. Sherlock pushed his worries to the back of his mind, or tried to, and took his usual seat beside John before the teacher waved to get his class’ attention.
“It won’t, if you don’t want it to.” John smiled. “I just… I wish I knew what Cam’s done to earn everyone’s trust. I’ve never hurt you. And I never will. You – you do know that, don’t you?”
Sherlock chased his lips, pulling him closer by the hip in a very confusing display of dominance, but John didn’t object. “I can’t believe they’ve made us have separate rooms.”
John put his letter down. “I’m sorry for being a bitch.”
“No,” Mycroft’s voice came from the right. “Not yet, anyway.”
, and it made John wrinkle his nose.
He stood up, pressing ‘send’ on the essay feedback, and picked up his tea mug. He needed a bit of caffeine to get through the rest of this marking. He let himself out of his office to the staff kitchen, and clicked the kettle on to boil.
When John was about nine, he wanted to be a doctor. He wanted it almost as much as he wanted to be a soldier, and was thrilled when he learned that he could do both. By now, he was somewhat smaller than his classmates, and people assumed he would grow up to be a beta. Still a soldier, and a doctor, too.
“I can’t ask him to do that,” John said. “I’m not going to force him to be with me. If he’s with me, he does it off his own back.”
“John,” Sherlock seized his wrists. “Tell me.” It was an order.
Two days later, he passed his first exam with flying colours, and Mr Thorne gave him an excellent Christmas present – a Baccalaureate application form.
It suddenly occurred to John that this was what Sherlock would look like when he passed away, and he leaned forward slightly, just to check he was breathing.
“Here,” Sherlock handed him a glass of water. He was fully dressed, and smelled clean, like he’d had a very intense shower. John could barely smell his alpha scent.
John stared. “You don’t think that after this week, and what happened the other night... you don’t think I give a damn?”
Twelve weeks, in fact. Twelve weeks John anticipated he'd be coming home in the evenings, grabbing few slices of dry bread and a packet of crisps or biscuits, before running upstairs and locking himself in his room.
Sherlock realised his cigarette had almost burned down. He stubbed it out on the arm of the bench. “Yes, the circumstances do leave something to be desired…”
-click-
“I’ll arrange something for you…” he didn’t seem to know what to say. “Do you need anything, at all?”
Sherlock smiled. "I suppose I am. Mycroft said you called for me, last night?"
“Work.”
“Doctor Watson?”
“I suppose not. Privately educated, no real friends… You know, even though I kind of wanted to rip your throat out,” John saw Victor smirk, “I was grateful you were his friend. He never had anyone before you. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised at what happened.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock reached for him, pulling him down for a kiss, increasing the pace of his movements, his cock sliding in and out of John’s hole as though it was designed for it, slick running out with every squelching thrust and slap of skin that made John wail, his orgasm catching him off-guard, his cock pulsing useless fluid over Sherlock’s stomach, his insides clenching on the thick invasion, making the alpha thrust hard once – twice – and then groan as John gasped, Sherlock’s cock pulsing inside him, flooding his insides with come, a knot pressed against his entrance, though not breaching as Sherlock came, and came, spilling his seed into the omega with moans that turned into sobs for them both, the two of them ending up a tangle of limbs, Sherlock covering every inch of John in kisses as the exhausted omega tried hard not to fall straight into the arms of sleep.
“I know, I make it sound like a chore,” Sherlock sighed. “But two weeks with Mycroft would send me over the edge. And I’m not one for sitting on a sun-lounger.”
He reached down between his legs, and touched at his entrance. More blood loosed into the water, this time with a film of what looked like omega slick, but not quite.
John shifted on his mattress. “Sherlock… I’ve got to ask. What’s going on with Cam?”
Sherlock shut his eyes. John’s calm demeanour watching him was almost as painful as the abscesses inside him. He wished he would panic. Shout, like Myroft. Cry, like his mother. Show some emotion that wasn’t just
Sherlock took the hand, and shook it. “Thank you.”
“But you would with me.”
“Ok,” John took his hand away. “Here…” he helped Sherlock perch on the edge of the bed, stripping him quickly of his legwear and socks, putting a gentle hand to his sternum and pushing him onto his back. “Would you like to lie on your side?”
Cam shook his head. “Sherlock, you mustn’t do things like that.”
Sherlock moved his face, looking down at John as if trying to read something in his eyes. Then curled his hips, just a little, just enough to rub his erection against John’s.
Sherlock blinked in surprise. ‘You… like chemistry?’
Sherlock looked away, shyly.
“Is it my scars?”
John rubbed between his eyebrows in exasperation. “He’s just a lad, alright? Just like any other lad. It doesn’t matter what’s in his pants.”
“What’s up?” John lowered the book he’d been reading.
“Let’s just go to sleep,” John turned away. “But we do need to talk about contraception once the baby is here. Unless you want a big family in a hurry.”
John staggered up, opening the landing window as he passed it, dragging himself along the wall into his bedroom (open the window) and bathroom (and that one, too), running the cold tap and sticking his mouth under it, drinking until he felt sick and had to sit on the toilet lid, catching his breath.
"No drug use, though. Recreational or medicinal. The bullet that hit him was... Oh. Army grade."
Below, in the neighbouring garden, Sherlock ruffled his hair and rolled his shoulders back as his father unlocked their front door. He looked up, as casually as he could, right up at where John sat in the windowsill.
‘Good. I think. We don’t do exams til May, though.’ John kept glancing at Sherlock. It was weird, he hadn’t really changed  but at the same time… it was like John could see him better, now? Like he’d been in black ad white before and was suddenly in colour. His scent, always nothing but a passing sidenote in the past, now sank into John’s nose and throat. Sherlock had always been the most beautiful thing John had ever seen, but now it felt dangerous. Before, John had felt like only he knew about it. Now, he understood what everyone else could see, and smell, and taste.
Sherlock watched him struggle, for a moment. John clearly had something to say, but why would it be… oh.
“Oh, I know,” Sherlock smirked, with a final, deliberate, look at John’s tented towel.
“He would be an absolute idiot to let you go,” Sherlock said. “You’re the best doctor the precinct has ever had, and you’re invaluable to my cases, besides.”
“No,” Sherlock shook his head again. “No, we’re not.”
“I don’t think you’ll be waiting too long,” Sherlock groaned. “I need to get out. I need to move around.” He sat up, wincing at his body. “John… I’m worried about it.”
“School, and stuff,” Sherlock said, wincing at the lavender wallpaper of his room. “And I started doing some experiments in the labs, and I found out what happens to human tissue when it’s exposed to…” he started talking. And found he couldn’t stop. John’s happy face was beaming at him, and it felt like everything that had happened over the last fourteen weeks had to pour out of him before he burst. When Sherlock finished, John took up the conversation and talked about scouts and cadets and his sister and going to visit the secondary school the next village over, and how much he wanted a dog, and he could do wheelies on his BMX now. The two of them didn’t stop talking even when Siger summoned them for takeaway Chinese food, and they sat at the dining table, oblivious to everyone else as they gassed on and on.
“Omega things?”
Sarah cleared her throat. “Do you need a minute?”
John grinned, and brought up his biology homework. They could work through this one together.
Finally, the mystery is cleared up, and we find out what happened to John.
“Yes. Didn’t sleep for long.” Sherlock clicked the kettle on, and got two mugs out. He looked at John. “Caf or decaf?”
John kicked at the pavement. This was what growing up was, then. The adults around you starting to fail.
“Thanks,” John took the offered loungewear. “Greg gone?”
Sherlock broke their kiss, and knelt up to shrug off his top, whilst John did the same, wriggling on the mattress as he yanked his top up and off, tossing it onto the floor before Sherlock settled back over him, the duvet over his shoulders as their kisses resumed, soft caresses over lips, teeth grazing as Sherlock tasted the omega he loved, before they came together with deeper exploration, tongues pressing and meeting in touches that sent sharp flecks of electricity down John’s body.
John shuddered, and Sherlock drew him close, fussing and loving him gently, a hand splaying out over John’s stomach, protective of their baby.
"Hm?"
Cam sat smugly on his sofa, enjoying the fuss he had created.
“But you can only bond with one person at a time. That’s what they said in Biology.”
John conceded. “Alright, maybe a
“Mycroft said so. I’m guess she hasn’t written back.”
, when the thought of armfuls of snuggly babies came to him, all smelling soft and sleepy, and warm and clean… “…I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s best, for us.”
"Worried I might suddenly find you absolutely, irresistibly tempting?" Sherlock asked, staring at John directly, with his red eyes, sultry and seductive, letting John know that if he wanted, he could do it in a heartbeat.
“On what grounds? Sherlock – the only way I can do this is if you confide in more people than you already have. Transphobic bullying may well be enough to have Moriarty expelled, but to charge him with that, I would need you to come out to more people.” Mycroft ran a hand over his face. “I’m sorry. There’s nothing else I can do.”
“Indeed. Now get in the car.”
“If it
“I know you’re me, fifteen years ago,” Joe said. “I had to claw my way up through TAs and sneaking in when the betas doctors were doing medicals, and I was off my head on scent-blockers. Damn near killed myself. I swore I’d be there for any other omega who wanted to do what I do. And when I saw you come in… I want to help you, John. If you’ll let me. How old are you?”
Sherlock let out a dry sob. “What do you even get from me? I’m just… some toy that doesn’t work properly. I’m a beta who doesn’t smell right, or an omega who won’t have a heat. I’m… I’m such hard work. I don’t know. What do you get from me?”
Sherlock smiled. "You remember what I said about unnecessary noises. Good."
Sherlock killed his victim. Unfortunately for her, she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Humans should know not to walk down alleyways in the twilight. Not a mistake she would make again, anyway. Sherlock took everything he could from her, but it wasn’t enough. A sort of rage was building up inside him – rage at himself and rage at the world – and he wanted to kill again. So he did. This time, an old man returning from shopping. The man saw him coming and begged for his life, but Sherlock ignored the human pleas and only let go when the man’s heart stopped beating.
John went cold all over. “Child protection? What –”
Sherlock wanted to dissolve through shame.
“But aren’t you worried about what people will think? Or say?”
Sherlock paused at the top of the stairs to the lounge, watching John put his briefcase down, and take his coat off. The scent of John’s den was very much in the omega’s nose, and for the first time he felt nervous. He used to live here. But a lot had happened in his time away. His sense of smell was much, much keener. Not enough to detect hormonal changes in the people around him, or to smell fear, or an oncoming heat of a fellow omega, but on walking into the alpha’s den, Sherlock was immediately on edge.
But there was something… In Mycroft’s house, Sherlock seemed like a different person. Over text, he sounded happy to hear from John. It could all be an act. Unless the Sherlock from before was an act.
Sherlock groaned in want, parting John’s arse cheeks with one hand as he positioned his cock with the other, pressing the head of his cock to John’s hole.
There was a tense silence.
“Thanks,” John poured boiled water into two mugs. “What does Mycroft think to you coming back here?”
“So stop taking your pill.”
And Sherlock’s heart suddenly sang with happiness as he realised what a gift he had been given. John… come back to him. He thought he had lost him forever, but now -
John pressed his nose into Sherlock’s chest. “Do you hate me?”
“John!”
“Here,” John rooted around in his holdall. “Try this.” He held out a deep blue scarf with a faded tartan design almost washed away.
“You think I haven’t thought about you every day?” Sherlock touched his own bottom lip, tracing the ghost of a kiss. “I… I
Sherlock watched John as he slept again. His cool fingers brushed against the man's cheek, felt through his hair. He ran his thumb along the veins in the back of John’s hand, feeling the rush of blood beneath the surface. None of the touches seemed to disturb John’s sleep, and if anything made him seem to fall deeper into sleep.
John smiled. “I thought we still needed a chat about all this?”
“Right…” Lestrade’s eyes flicked towards the bar.
“So, you don’t like anyone?”
“It didn’t feel like a good thing,” Sherlock closed his eyes. “You…” he stopped, eyes screwing up.
Sherlock’s shoulders dropped a fraction. “What… what do you mean?”
John stared at the table.
“You get bored just as easily,” Mycroft said from the sofa. “Perhaps he simply exhausted all the ideas he had.”
“Please,” Sherlock nodded, putting his hands on John’s hips. “God, please, just… slow…”
He raised his head, noting it seemed to take a long time. He was in a room that looked as though it had been closed up for a while – there were sheets over the furniture, and the curtains were drawn. The air was sharp and cold.
It was December. The Christmas holidays were mere weeks away, and the lesson was heavy on revision for the exams they'd be having in January.
When John did wake up, it was nearing noon. He'd slept more than twelve hours, and it looked like it had done him well when he opened his eyes. He glanced around, eyes settling on Sherlock, looking almost surprised, as if he'd thought the night before had been a dream. John smiled. "Just like you said you'd be," he said quietly. "Christ, I've not seen you in six months but it doesn't feel like you ever left, now you're here again."
“No, John,” Sherlock’s warm breath washed over John’s skin. “Lower your hands. Show me your face.”
liked.
“Discharge papers, and confirmation that your half-way house has been arranged. They needed a next of kin to come and sign you out, but…”
“Sherlock –” John managed to croak out.
He barely remembered anything but snatches of the days afterwards. He recalled Sherlock sponging him down with cool water. He just about remembered one instance of lowering himself onto Sherlock’s cock, moaning in pleasure as Sherlock sank deep inside him, the alpha’s hands on his hips and cock, stroking up his chest as he was the most beautiful creature on earth. He remembered one post-orgasmic cuddle, Sherlock still locked inside him as John half-cried against his chest with exhaustion. He remembered Sherlock kissing his neck, his arms, his hands, his cock… anywhere but his mouth.
Definitely.
Sherlock knew he was shaking, trembling with anticipation and the helplessness of his position, but he could do nothing about it. John was taking care of him, going to make him feel good, going to come inside him and
John put a hand on Sherlock’s chest. “I’ll wait. If you want me to.”
Sherlock nodded.
‘Please!’ Sherlock clutched for his shirt front.
He was beaming with pure happiness.
And the warm spring air seemed heavy, as though thunder and lightning was brewing in the microcosm between their faces.
The kitchen door opened, and John squeaked in fright.
There was an uncomfortable silence.
“No,” Sherlock shook his head. “Days ago. I haven’t left the room since… I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t… move.”
“Sherlock, are you..?” John’s hand hovered near the omega’s face.
The door is closed, as if there’s an audience they’re denying a view to.
She smiled. ‘We’re more alike than you think, darling. I did a chemistry course, and learned about elements.’
Thank you, one and all, to everyone who has read and supported this fic. I can't believe it's nearly at 16,000 views - this is completely phenomenal and I can't tell you how happy this has made me.
Sherlock pondered this. ‘Cam’ sounded like a young person’s name, whilst ‘Charles’ sounded old and stuffy. There was something to be said about choosing your own name. Sherlock’s first name was, officially, William. But no one had called him that since he was a toddler.
That was the name of the wee vampire he had created in a fit of grief. An evil little cesspit of a person even as a human being. Enjoyed it when other people got hurt. Ratted everyone out, but never got caught. Never got his hands dirty, but reaped the spoils.
“Sherlock…”
“I can’t bond, anyway,” John sighed as Ryan took his turn. “I don’t have heats, so there it is.”
Molly twisted a roll of paper in her hands. “I was just coming to make room in the chamber. I’m ready to put my sample in.”
face.
Sherlock answered the door to a dirty and bloody Lestrade, and a John who was white as a sheet and stinking of alpha anger and his own piss. It took Sherlock a second to think to step back and let them both in. “What the hell…?”
“If that’s who you are, that’s what it should call you.” Sherlock dropped his hand down. “Anything else would just be a lie, wouldn’t it?”
That alpha - Sherlock Holmes - knew what he was. John had seen it in his eyes when they shook hands. Read it in his face. That look of curiosity. That
He kept walking, the cold making itself felt through his clothes now, and still no sign of how to get to the city centre.
Sherlock was against the far wall, his facial expression utterly impassive, as one of John’s alpha students – Gregory – scented him slowly down his throat, hands on the Unpresented boy’s shoulders.
“I don’t know,” John shrugged. “I’ve not got a lot of experience. But this… it feels more serious than just a break up. But why should it?”
“Have you been to London before?”
“Our living situation, yes,” John said quickly. “Temporary, yeah?”
“I think I need a shower,” Sherlock said, flopping face-down onto the bed.
“But what am I meant to do for
“No,” John gasped as he went for Sherlock’s shirt buttons. “No, it’s fucking perfect.”
“September,” Sherlock said, without looking at him. “I’m working a year ahead.”
“I’m not trying to be your dad,” John held his hands up, keeping his distance. He gave the air a subtle sniff – no changes there, so this wasn’t a sudden onset of maturity, thank goodness. “I’m trying to stop you slicing your hand open.”
“I know, but it’s not shopping,” John said. “Just… a bit of family bonding stuff.”
‘Is that
CW: Parental death, discussion of past sexual assault
Victor shook his head. “No, but he shouldn’t be too long… he’s been out to see his sister.”
Eventually, the smell of John’s dead body would alert Mrs Hudson, and the neighbours.
John picked up one of the sticks, and took it into the bathroom, feeling slightly stupid as he pissed on it, then put the cap on the end, and waited.
“We’re here,” his mum sing-songed as they drew up to one side of the enormous house. “Have you got your shoes on?”
And both of the brothers vanished.
“As if,” John laughed. “You’re tiny. In a good way. You feel…” his gentle strokes resumed, “you feel as beautiful as you look.”
“We’re just going to call in to Cam’s,” Siger called as they left the motorway.
“As long as he pleases.”
"Should I have woken you?" Sherlock asked, keeping his voice at a low volume. "I heard you beginning to stir in your sleep, but... After a while, I thought it best not to interfere, as it can accelerate reactions."
what was supposed to happen. John was supposed to be in a hospital, and not for another three weeks at least. This was a
Mycroft glanced at John. “It appears that there is more to your bonding contract than we first anticipated.”
“I thought so. But we don’t have to let them know. I’m a grown man, Sherlock, I can keep my counsel. What you did to me, it won’t happen again. Will it?”
“No, Dad, you can’t… I don’t want this!” Victor stood his ground, fists clenched.
A tentacle dipped shallowly to his urethra, making him hiss in distress, before going back to touch at the softer skin covering the head, manipulating it back and forth until John let out a soft cry. The suckers felt like deep kisses against his skin, and the motion was just so curious and careful...
John raised his eyebrows. “Mycroft is ok with that?”
Mycroft gave his tablet a tiny smile as he went back to it.
, a voice in his head said.
“Just… your hair. In your face.” John said quickly.
“Sherlock,” John said in a this-is-important voice.
“Well… plenty of alphas go with betas.”
Sherlock nodded. “That seems agreeable.”
“So, clearly, playing hockey hasn’t made him less desirable,” Mycroft said softly. “It is only old-fashioned fools like Siger who think like that. I know that a lot of alphas prefer their omegas to be physically fit and active.”
Sherlock was strapped onto a board, and Jane, the paramedic who wasn’t driving, started taking his vitals.
Tabitha looked taken aback, but Poppy was clearly unfazed, as she leaned forward. “It matters, John, because you are a person. You have a choice about where you live. And you don’t have to pick the lesser of two evils. We can arrange a foster carer, if you prefer.”
“Oh, fuck,” John dropped the thermometer. “No, no, no, no, no…” He staggered up and out of bed, the covers falling to the floor. “Ok. Ok, fuck. Shit.”
John looked up.
“I know,” Sherlock picked up his wallet. “And… and you.” He left, leaving John alone again, torn between wants and decisions.
“You used to,” John said to a crumb on his plate. “I think. When I first moved in, after Mum and Dad…” he shook his head. “What happened isn’t really about you.”
“Do you need money?” Sherlock asked, looking up from his phone.
Victor waved a hand. “Don’t worry. He was always Mr Safety-First. And I mean for
“John?” James shouted as John all-but sprinted past the lounge. “John, wait – hold up –”
“There are tablets you can take, to delay coming of age,” Mycroft said quickly. “Sherlock suggested them as soon as you left the manor that first day – he was very concerned about your age. Siger was furious – he lashed out at Sherlock, and forbade him to mention the subject again. I broke them apart.”
Tangerine amongst the vanilla-cake of youth.
“Ok.” John reached over and put the cup of tea back in Sherlock’s hand. “Stay hydrated, at least.”
Sherlock’s stomach clenched around the food inside it, and a sweat broke out on his back.
‘I love you,’ Sherlock said, touching his hand.
John wiped his face, and fished in his bag for his prenatal vitamins. He needed to pull himself together.
“Her?” Sherlock frowned.
“It’s not that interesting,” John picked some clothes out of his drawers. “I’m still at school.”
“I’m fine, thank you, John. Have a good evening, both of you.” He gave Sherlock a look, which Sherlock couldn’t quite interpret.
John swallowed.
He ignored the other students as he trotted down the stairs. They were all dull, all predictable, all cast from the same mould. None of them could ever play as well as him. None of them would ever be told they were perfect and it be true.
‘Anything. You can do
John wasn't the only one in the showers. The block was a hastily-constructed breeze-block and plastic affair, with water that was lukewarm at best, but John had had worse. He soaped up, and scrubbed himself clean quickly, ignoring the doubled heavy breathing coming from the other side of his cubicle. There was no such thing as privacy, in the army. He considered running a soap-slick hand over his own semi-erect cock, since he wasn't planning on seeing James, then decided against it. He had a sneaking suspicion Sherlock would know, if he did.
John moved over on the sofa, his intent quite clear. Sherlock sat beside him, and let John crawl into his lap, straddling one leg either side.
“He tells me we can at least rule ‘alpha’ out of the running.”
“I can try and –”
It was as though he could finally think.
“You’re supposed to avoid too much Vitamin A,” Sherlock said as John got the Marmite jar down.
“Oh god, am I going to have to be your mum?”
And now everyone would know he was an omega.
John’s mouth dropped open. “What? No!”
“Here you go,” the nurse manoeuvred the baby into position, her head resting in the crook of John’s elbow, her body encased in the blanket. “That’s it, just support her head. Perfect. You’re a natural.”
“She doesn’t have a name,” John repeated. “I… I don’t even know what to name her.”
John’s head whipped around, and his fangs dropped down like knives. “What the
“Sherlock?” Eurus raised her head off the pillows.
No one loved him.
And then the real agony began.
“I didn’t know that.”
“No,” Sherlock whispered.
“If I should?” John blinked. “Should?” His heart sank like a stone through water. Sherlock was saying John didn’t deserve him. John wasn’t good enough.
‘Fuck off,’ John sighed. ‘You can run me a bath. A warm one. And did you bring me a mirror?’
“You’re so warm,” Sherlock smiled, moving a little beneath the alpha. “I like it…” his lips found John’s again, moving more easily, now, softer to open and allow John’s tongue inside to taste, to stroke over the omega’s own.
He stood back from the re-arrangement of the furniture, and caught his breath. Although the temperature outside had started dropping, John couldn’t seem to cool down, lately. He was topless as soon as he got into his bedroom, and didn’t even take more than a jacket when he went out. Still, it would save him the expense of buying a winter maternity coat.
Sherlock’s mouth turned down.
Sherlock looked at the bathroom.
All Sherlock had done was leave him.
“How long?” John fidgeted on the leather seat.
Sherlock didn’t bother saying he’d heard. “That’s... fast.”
“Where you from?” a boy hissed to his right.
Mrs Hudson had had a daily hug from her tenant, and there had also been less gunfire than usual.
Sherlock ignored him, rubbing the head of his cock over, around, over John’s entrance, omega slick easing his touches, tracing John’s pleasure, before his mate’s body was open, and hot, and wet, so wet, that when Sherlock pushed inside, he sank half way in with no effort at all.
Sherlock looked up from his book at John, who had recovered enough to come out poolside. He was wearing some garish print swim-shorts and carrying a beach-ball. Sherlock glanced down at himself. “My costume, why?”
He was tempted to get a cab home and hide, but forced himself into the next estate agency, where he had more luck, and was given a bundle of possible flats to look at, and a promise they’d call if anything else came up.
“Or were you spying on him?” John narrowed his eyes. “Come on. I know you’ve had a leap up on your career ladder since I left. You knew where you find me. You still work for
John had to smile. ‘Yes, sir.’
The bruises on his thighs, where he hit.
So tiny it barely happened.
John stroked a finger down Sherlock’s cheek. “I wouldn’t go if I had a choice.”
, and Sherlock technically had the upper hand as a mature man, but John was an alpha and if he decided to… Sherlock would be entirely to blame.
, John was getting so hard. His cock strained in his trousers, excitement over a kiss, a touch after so damn long sending him practically into rut.
“Hey,” John pulled him close, and kissed him on the chin. “I know we can’t go back to yours, and mine is… not the best idea, but… How about, this weekend, we go somewhere… that isn’t a dressing room?”
“I can’t stay there much longer,” John said, as he flicked through the racks of jeans to try and find his size.
“I should go,” Sherlock whispered. His eyes were closed. He looked pale and peaceful, in the moonlight.
John blinked, the towel’s warmth soaking into his skin.
Sherlock looked confused. Properly mystified, and for some reason John found himself feeling extremely annoyed by it. Did Sherlock not know how to restrain himself? He’d only been talking the other day about how omegas like him weren’t supposed to advertise the fact they had a sex drive at all, and now he looked disappointed because John had put a stop to a grope? Did he expect John to be up for anything just because he was an alpha? That didn’t make sense at all.
“… are you sure this is a heat? Perhaps you’re just ill.”
“No, it’s ok,” John closed his eyes for a minute. “I want… to stay engaged to Sherlock. For now.”
“Yeah, but we can’t talk about work all night.”
“That’s fine.”
Sherlock gave him a shrewd look. “Take a guess.”
Eyes filled with sadness.
"Uh oh. Trouble in paradise?" James asked, sounding amused at the thought of the two of them actually getting along.
“Have you discussed gender testing, at all?”
John pressed his lips together. "That's fine with me. So, what do I call you, then?"
Siger sighed. “These betas. It’s a wonder her parents produced an omega at all, with those genes. You’ll have to keep an eye for any insubordination, Sherlock.”
He realised it was his own name.
“Yeah,” John said, one hand going for Sherlock’s soft curls. “I suppose it isn’t… too awful an idea…” his thoughts were threatening to de-rail as Sherlock’s tongue was joined by teeth, scraping over the skin of his throat, working up to his jaw. John’s skin prickled, like tiny stings over his body, as if it was waking up after a long winter sleep. Warmth ran over his limbs, chased by cold and nerves as Sherlock’s breath ghosted over the shell of his ear.
“I know we’ve not known each other for long, like, but I mean it.” John leaned forward on the bench they were sharing.
A shudder ran through John, settling at his crotch. “Oh.”
an idiot, in fairness. Not so much as some people, but still… a sentimental idiot.
John almost laughed. He nodded, smiling. “That sounds… amazing, actually. Let’s try that.” He looked out of the window, for a moment, then turned, and held his hand out. “Hi,” he said. “I’m Doctor John Watson. I’m a former soldier, and omega, and I’m having your baby.”
John gasped, and stood, knocking his chair backwards. “How dare you? I want to speak to your manager.”
“Come on,” Mike pushed his glasses up his nose. “First game of the season!”
John kissed Sherlock’s head, and ran down to the bathroom, washing the tub out quickly, and starting the taps again before going back upstairs to find Sherlock standing, leaning over a chest of drawers, legs wide apart in what would normally have been an erotic position, but right now screamed
Sherlock said a polite goodbye, as did his parents, and the Watsons drove away with loud sighs of relief from John’s parents.
“Holmes?” A nurse called, opening a door.
“No,” John said, feeling his scalp wrench.
“I might be late to bed,” Sherlock added, his eyes never moving from the test tube he held up, eyes obscured by goggles. “If I make it.”
“For… what?”
“Then what – when he’s eighteen? And out of education?”
Moriarty retracted his fangs enough to speak. “Oh, Sherlock. It’s been so long. Does your blood call to me?”
‘I got a place at Cheltenham College,’ John said, smiling. ‘To enlist in the army at sixteen, and learn a specialism. I’m going to do medicine! It’s… a dream come true for me. I never thought I’d get in somewhere like that, but the college wrote to my school – can you believe it?’
It was the best outcome they could have hoped for. Sherlock swept John into his arms and held him tight for over a minute once the hearing had been dismissed. There was nothing to say at that moment – the two of them just needed one another.
Sherlock glanced at him, gratitude in his eyes.
Mycroft made him have a blood test, conducted at home with a kit provided by a doctor Mycroft was friends with. Sherlock wouldn’t let Mycroft stick a needle in his hand or elbow for fear that Magnussen would see it and ask questions, so they had to use a vein in Sherlock’s foot. Fortunately, there was little bruising afterwards, but the test confirmed the presence of pregnancy hormones in Sherlock’s blood.
John felt Sherlock squeeze his hand. He wanted to turn and curl into Sherlock’s chest, this did not seem to be going well.
“My face!” the alpha boy screamed, blood pouring from his nose and mouth, chips of tooth scattering on the table top.
“Sherlock, sweetheart?” his mother touched his hand.
He couldn’t stand.
John decided to be evasive. “I know one. He’s a family friend. My parents know his parents.” He didn’t need to give them any details.
His phone vibrated gently under his pillow. He fished it out and read:
John backed away from the banter, blushing as he cottoned onto what the older boys were talking about. The bell rang, thankfully, and the group broke apart, Mike and John heading for their tutor group as the older boys want off, punching each other and laughing. It was weird – John was almost scared of how rough they were with one another, but at the same time they were so easy and happy in their friendship. John had Mike, but he didn’t really have anyone like that.
“John,” Sherlock moved his hand a little stroking John’s back in small circles. “John…”
“Oh god,” Sherlock breathed. If he did this, he’d belong to Victor, forever. He’d be wanted forever. “Yes…”
“I don’t expect us to. When I went over to you the other day… Christ, I only wanted to talk to you. And… finding out you were seeing someone…” John clenched the covers in his hands without thinking about it. He looked up. “Does he know you’re here?”
“If I said it wasn’t safe for you to come home, one day,” John said carefully, “would you be able to go somewhere for a few nights? Mycroft’s maybe?”
“I think I understand,” Sherlock said. “You think that, once the baby is here, people will only ever see you as an omega, correct?”
Siger didn’t reply.
“John!” Sherlock rolls his head back, exposing his throat, and it’s all John can do to kiss it and drag his teeth over those jutting collarbones, and taste that detoxing skin. Sherlock is moving his hips up in little thrusts, his cock rubbing against John’s own and his hand in a way that makes him want to die. “John, I…”
“Did you want to write some more?” John offered. “More?” he flipped through the pages.
“Bath,” Sherlock puffed out another breath. “Hot bath. Well. Warm. Please.”
Pre-heat – the painful cramps the proceeded the mounting lust and need to breed – usually lasted a couple of hours before giving way to slick and arousal and desire.
“Well, we’re so near the end.”
“Just lean this way,” John held his arms steady at the elbows. “Let your insides relax. I know it hurts. I’m not saying it doesn’t. But we can make it stop being quite as bad without even moving off this bench.”
“The pelvic MRI confirms it,” the doctor smiled. “Congratulations.”
“I’ll make it better,” Sherlock’s voice was a low rumble. “Make you feel so good, my John.” He bent down to scent John’s neck, running his nose along his damp skin.
“What the fuck…” he sat back, away from the splinters of side-table. “Sherlock?” He looked at the vampire in horror. “Sherlock, what the fuck’s going on?”
“That’s…” Sherlock shook his head. “He couldn’t…”
Birdie was asleep.
“Hour ago,” Sherlock gasped back, then bent over with a groan, clutching his stomach. “Uhh… John!”
If John wouldn’t come to him, maybe another alpha would.
“I don’t know.” John pushed his tea over for him to take. “I genuinely don’t know what the answer is. I want things to be how they were, because I – I miss being with you like before.” He touched absently at his neck. “I don’t want this mad bastard to drive a wedge between us. But if it’s not this that does it, is it going to be something else?”
“Have you done something to Molly?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock just blinked.
“You had a case, right?” Victor blinked.
“Oh god,” John rolled his head back. “Sherlock…”
That left Sherlock with another decision to make. Sherlock could stop chasing the man now and leave him to whatever nefarious purpose he intended, or Sherlock could pursue him and trust in his own capability with magic to deal with whatever spell the mage had just cast. It took him less than a second to decide and he did not pause when he raced around the corner after the man.
Sherlock as falling face first towards the stone floor. The two storeys had seemed to be a great height when he had been climbing the stairs to the balcony, but now the ground was rushing at him in mere moments. He tried the spell once more and could finally breathe again as he felt some resistance come underneath him, stopping him from falling so quickly.
Previously, his control over them had been absolute. Before John. Though Sherlock thinks he can surely at least partially credit this lapse to the fact that he hasn't slept in several days, as well.
Sherlock’s face wrinkled in annoyance, but Siger released his arm and allowed him to continue to his seat. Sherlock loved his mother, sure he did.
A lady approached the throne and addressed Siger, though Sherlock did not bother listening to her concern. He turned to his brother.
Harry laughed at his big smile and teased him, “It’s weird that you like peaches so much.”
Call a warning? No, too vague. Sherlock did not know exactly what to yell a warning for, the pitcher or the vase. For all he knew, the servant carrying it could be in on the scheme and find some fumbling way to carry it out, or worse, act on a contingency plan Sherlock had no idea of, so would likely be unable to counter in such a short amount of time. No.
With a wan smile, Mycroft engaged Sherlock in a game in which the petitioners seated before them became subjects of their intense scrutiny. As these were the exact same subjects who had bored Sherlock practically insensate only moments ago, Sherlock considered that this was proof his brother could truly make anything interesting with the power of his mind.
Wat returned to them and sat cross-legged on the deck. He went to pull Harry down to cuddle next to him but Harry balked, crying that she was too old to sit in his lap. Wat laughed and pulled John down instead. Harry settled herself in against Wat’s side to stare at the fish with them. Wat angled his head down to speak in John’s direction.
“Hey, you think it’ll be windy enough to need to let the side flap down?” John asked, eyeing it from where he stood need the table.
After several minutes of deep breaths, Sherlock tried to stand once again. This time, he was able to get to his feet, wobbly though they were, and head back to the dining room. He did not know whether his nanny would have excused herself already, probably saying that she had sent Sherlock back to his room or made up some other excuse to cover her lapse, or whether she was still at the table under the pretense of waiting for him. He did not know then, that he was not going to find out.
