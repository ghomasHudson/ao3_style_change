What did that even mean anymore? Doing more?
“I told you, you could call me.”
“I will always be there for the team. I will always be there to help them, I owe all of that to all of you. To the world. Everything else, I’m working on it, Steve. When I was feeling…” Guilty. Devastated. Suicidal. “This way. I’d get reckless. Reckless has only hurt more people. I’m not doing that anymore,” Tony took in another deep breath. “I’m going to work on it.” He was going to get better because that’s what he did.
Tony blamed his misstep on his alcohol to blood ratio. “So that’s what you want me for? To get to work in the kitchen? How forties of you Steve, I’m absolutely charmed.” Tony exaggerated with fluttering his eyelashes toward Steve while Steve rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony muttered, rolling his shoulder so Steve was forced to release where his hand had been.
“Tell me to stop,” Steve challenged and waited, staring down at him. Tony felt more than a little awestruck at the crimson that proved Steve to be just as human as he was. Always felt that way upon seeing it, that, and a deep gut wrenching despair. Idols were not suppose to bleed. Were not supposed to fall. Were not suppose to hurt you.
It was easy to think, but sometimes he could see Steve so clearly that it was as if he was in the room with him. Towering over him. That thick gaze of disapproval lighting into him like a match. He didn’t need to open his mouth to tell Tony that he should be doing more than drinking himself into an early grave.
“Not everything serious has to become a joke Tony.”
It was exactly what he wanted. “This is better than I’d ever imagined,” Steve growled, reading Tony’s thoughts allowed. His voice the cause of devastation.
“Always so adamant here Cap,” Tony turned his head away, studied the lack of patterns on a white wall. He couldn’t remember why he preferred muted tones anymore.
Almost too much that he could afford not to.
“He’s not very subtle,” Steve deadpanned while watching Peter make his way into the Avenger’s facility. “Nice kid though.”
“On your little road trip?” Tony questioned. Wanting to turn his gaze elsewhere, but it felt like admitting defeat.
Tony paused and thought about that for a moment. Rhodey couldn’t get past it either, especially if he beefed up the security as he flew to location. He doubted Rhodes would help Steve to begin with, but there was a margin for error here. Regardless of whether or not he would help Steve, it would be added onto the lecture he was already returning to. It made more sense, was safer for everyone if he brought Steve along. Getting Steve and the others back under the umbrella of an Accords revision wasn’t actually as important as all the lives within that blast radius.
He had a bottle of something expensive in one hand. Had been contemplating it for hours. Taken in the smell of it, but didn’t dare to drink any. It would start with one sip and end with the whole bottle. He had too much on his plate to be able to afford even one drunken night.
“The beard is not a good look Rogers.” A lie. Look away and upon returning there would be nothing. Nothing but your memories left. “Didn’t you know I have the market on facial hair?”
“Oh so we are attempting to make illegal backroom deals? I couldn’t be sure.” He still looked too content for Tony’s liking.
“Meanwhile your common sense is tripping and falling into every ditch it can find.” It was mostly annoying because Tony wanted to laugh at that, but wasn’t allowed to anymore. Had that right taken away from him.
Steve recoiled a bit. Tony understood that too. He’d thought he had a better handle on his emotions than he was currently displaying. Even had begun working on ways to improve Steve’s shield, prototype in the works. He’d walked himself through what had happened multiple times. Made himself see and comprehend Steve’s actions. Hoped it would allow him to look at Steve again without all of this clouding his judgement.
Tony’s fingers glided over the keys, creation filled the notes that drifted in the air. It was melancholy and sadness, but maybe that would answer Steve’s endless questions better than Tony was currently able to. When Tony listened he couldn’t help but wonder, what each note must be taking. What the price was in building up the melody for only his and Steve’s ears.
There was no point in denying it. “It’s a little what it looks like,” Tony admitted, pasting on a fake smirk. If he thought his heart had been pounding before, the concept of battle had nothing on this. Whatever this fucked up thing was, it was no longer just between just Steve and Tony. It had escaped into reality and Tony could see the full extent of his mistakes reflected back at him through someone else’s eyes. What he found there was damning.
“What happened?”
Steve used his free hand to tug Tony’s head back, exposing his throat. He bit down on the sensitive skin there. Tony cried out when Steve continued lower. Mixing the sharpness of teeth with sucking bruises into his skin. Upon reaching the collar of Tony’s shirt Steve moved his hand there. Ripped it clean down the center.
“Well,” Tony started and brought his hand to a table top. He thrummed his finger against the surface. “During the rebuilding process I thought since it had been renamed the Avengers Tower it would make sense to give all of the Avengers their own spaces in the tower. So I designed living quarters for each of you in the case you were in the area.” Tony changed his posture so he could easily speak with hand gestures. “Uh don’t feel obligated to use them after today or anything. Just they’re there if you ever need a place to crash or if we are getting ready for a group mission. Not really sure what the arrangement you have with Shield is.”

He recognized the piece of cloth immediately because, after all, he made it.
“Of course not,” Steve put in harshly while sidestepping Tony. Any chipperness gone. He smoothed out the lines of his bright blue shirt, a callback to the colors Steve had preferred when they all lived in the tower together.
He lay there dazed, he could hear a buzzing in his ears. There was nothing but that buzz for an eternity of moments. The rest of his body too busy playing catch up to process what was happening. When his surroundings floated back into focus Tony couldn’t concentrate on his cracked eye slits or the different graphics FRIDAY was rapidly displaying for him. All he could concentrate on was his own breathing. Taking stock of that before moving onto the body. His legs moved his toes. Then all the way from his shoulder to his fingertips. Tony rolled his head and grimaced. He may have survived it without any last damage to his person, but getting out of bed tomorrow was going to be an experience.
“Rhodey can help you with that better than I can. Much better team player.”
Tony rolled his eyes. The things Steve faulted him for. “Fair enough,” Tony said choosing not to engage. He could see the straight path to them stupidly bickering if he did and where would that land either of them? The silence went on longer than both could take.
“It’s my battle to face. I need to do this my way,” Steve’s words were steady, insistent, deliberate. Meant to squash the inquiry for good this time.
Tony had been reaching for the remnants of coffee when he knocked the mug right off the table. He blinked, turning to Steve. Steve stared back with a concerned smile. Tony flushed, realizing he’d dumped coffee all over the floor. “Dum-E can you please?” Tony ran his hand through his hair glancing back at Steve. His heart was pounding and he knew Steve could hear it and wasn’t that worse somehow? That Steve knew his secret. That someone like Steve believing in someone like Tony meant everything to him. That it could cause his brain to short circuit because he’d never thought of that as a possibility. It felt a little bit like someone handing you the world and that was ridiculous. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of money SI spends on coffee mugs,” Tony joked, looking back to his work hurriedly.
Steve had found his voice by clearing his throat. He pasted on an uneasy smile and placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder. It had nothing to do with steadying him this time. “You’ve helped me plenty. I don’t need your help here.” Despite Steve’s earlier words all Tony could hear was I don’t need you.
Tony frowned. “I do.” But Steve already knew that their quarters were directly across from each other.
“Tap another resource. This isn’t happening,” Tony said decisively, making it clear that Steve wasn’t going to be able to question this out of him. At least now he had a better understanding of why this was happening. For a moment Tony had allowed himself to believe this was all because of warped, misplaced jealousy. He should feel relief that it was an interrogation.
“No civilian casualties. Managed to keep it out of the news. Think we did alright without you Cap.” Tony said dryly looking up at Steve from under his lashes.
Amora’s smile turned into something sharper, the unease growing, and Tony kept himself on the edge of firing off. He could sense Steve getting just as tense beside him. “I was exiled from Asgard several of your lifetimes ago human. Watched it fall deeper and deeper into ruin under the old king’s rule. The king is gone to madness. The crowned prince is off gallivanting. The imposter can’t hold the throne… Not when I’m the one coming for it.”
“Oh, let him up then.” Tony put the tools down, wiped soot off his hands and gave himself a once over. It wasn’t great. He hadn’t slept in a couple days and he knew it had to be reflected in his hair and face. The shirt he was wearing had coffee stains and creases in odd places. Tony tried to smooth that and his hair out before Steve Rogers could arrive.
Some things were easier thought than done. The tick in Steve’s jaw was readable from here. Tony had to smile at the small victory. Winning one skirmish after he lost the war seemed pointless.
“Hey Cap,” Tony said, mostly to break the silence. Steve had been studying his appearance and wasn’t doing the best at masking what he thought of it. “Bruce’s workshop is a floor down if you are looking for him.” He could also be in the smaller workshop that connected to the common area, but Tony weighed the probabilities and found it unlikely.
“Because that went so well last time.” Steve was baiting him and Tony couldn’t help but take it. Part of him missed these moments while the rest loathed every minute of it.
That got Steve the rest of the way there. The kind of smile that started at the mouth, but lit up the eyes and had his entire body thrumming with a dangerously contagious energy. “I’ll be seeing you tomorrow Mr. Stark.”
“I’ve never made a smarter move in my life.” Tony decided on, trying to work his face up into a glower. “So that’s not why you’re here?”
Tony had gone back to half kneeling at Steve’s side. His gaze flickered up quickly to Steve’s amused smile. “Nat and Bruce? Hopefully not. That would be a disaster. You can put your arms back down.”
Time to get this over with now that Tony had well verified that Peter was in one piece. No telling what happened prior to the assistance of rapid healing, but his high spirits made Tony come to the conclusion of not much. If anything, the kid probably found this to be one whole exciting adventure. Meanwhile, Tony was still recovering from what felt like could be a mini cardiac episode.
Tony shifted on his knees in front of Steve running a hand down his left leg in a soft, fleeting touch.
“She wasn’t wrong.”
“Yeah and they all start with Tony Stark.” Steve used his free hand to fumble through one of his pockets.
“I’d like them just as an assurance. I won’t call the suit unless I need to,” Tony tried again with less animosity. He could reliably keep himself to that.
Tony blinked up from what he had been soldering, not quite certain he’d heard that right. “Captain America, Captain Steven Rogers?” he asked for clarification while staring blankly at the tool in his hands.
“Thanks for offering. Again.” There was a teasing note there, an effort to lighten the conversation.
There wasn’t colder ice water in the world. They jumped apart like magnets of the same polarity. Steve had started for his clothes with quick military efficiency. Tony couldn’t help being thankful for the fact that he only needed to zip up his pants before running down the hall. His clothing was otherwise in a complete disarray, but that would hardly matter once he had his suit on over the ensemble.
Tony’s original question had melted away back into the depths of his mind. Another one, an older one stood out in contrast in its stead. “I keep offering to help you find Barnes and you never let me. Why?” Tony pushed himself up to his elbows to watch Steve’s reaction. Steve was much closer than he’d originally thought. Their legs only an inch away from brushing.
“I’m worried about you choking on your own vomit,” Steve responded dryly.
She brought a finger to her face in a thoughtful gesture. “But I might as well hedge my bets. I’m here because Earth has been the God’s playground for eons. You wouldn’t believe the things Odin has hidden here. I’m going to take what I’ve come for and be on my way… And if I have to stomp on a few ants in the process, so be it.”
“And a Tony Stark prediction is as good as gold,” Steve said dryly.
“Really, Tony?” Hearing his name in Steve’s mouth was a shock to the system. He wanted to shovel it out so Steve would never be able to use it again. The idea of wedding invitations hadn’t pleased the former captain in the slightest. If anything he appeared to be gathering up anger as he stood there. And what right did he have to that anymore? Assuming he had any right to begin with.
“You know you should have called me.”
Steve pursed his bottom lip, glancing down at Tony. “You don’t think it’s too flashy?"
“Funny, but incredibly reckless. It really works in our favor if the Secretary of State doesn’t know we are attempting to make backroom deals as conversing with you like this is currently very illegal. So I’m a little confused as to what you are doing here.”
“I wasn’t-” Steve started looking frustrated. “I’ve had sex before Tony.” He emphasized Tony’s name. “Which you know. You also know why we need to talk about this.”
Tony was back to looking at the trees, thinking on the best way to handle this. “Yeah. Fine. Let’s discuss the Accords. Bring your team and we can talk about everything that is wrong with your revision and how I can fix it.” Since that’s the only reason Steve was coming back to him really. To fix this for him. There was no telling how many lies crawled under every conversation they exchanged.
“The shields a weapon Tony. Not having it doesn’t erase my expertise in hand to hand combat.”
“Not an Avenger,” Tony muttered. “He’d get into more trouble if I wasn’t around. I think. We’ll see. Big fan of yours though,” Tony said as Steve walked back out of the light. Not closer, but edging around a perimeter Tony had made up in his mind. One that Steve appeared to be aware of.
Steve sighed and released Tony from his grip. Appeared to be preparing to back off and stand up. Possibly leave the building just like Tony had wanted to begin with. Wouldn’t that be great? Everyone walking away in one piece.
“I like what you’ve done with the place. Seems like you’ve put in a lot of work since the attack.” Tony jerked at the mention of said attack. Didn’t really appreciate the whole small talk niceties thing happening right then. Would rather have Steve insulting him again or at least get to his point.
He didn’t need to hear FRIDAY’s urgent warning to know what was going to happen next. More of the green aura dripped from her fingertips into the water, causing it to go from glowing to blinding. The shields threw itself up as an almost transparent blue around his entire armor. The shields weren’t designed to take all of that energy at this close of a range. It had managed to handle the brunt of the damage, but Tony felt more than processed the pressure of the resulting explosion throw him back towards shore. Repulsor technology temporarily rendered useless as his body was flung into the nearby seaside restaurant.  He took the window and part of the wall with him. Tony tumbled headfirst into the floor and the tables. Body doing an uncontrolled somersault before slamming to a halt against the other wall.
“Point?”
“We have don’t know what the extent of her abilities are, it’s not safe to engage her by yourself,” came Steve’s voice over the comms. Disapproving and if he was still the Captain Tony knew it’d be an order not to go at all.
Steve’s face scrunched together like he’d tasted something disgusting. “I wasn’t romantically interested in Howard, Tony.”
Steve stopped. Turned his head back, hopeful.
“No reason.” Definitely not beard burns or rush of blood from the high you got over an idiotic decision.
“You rarely are.”
Tony put all of his weight into aggressively shaking Steve’s hand off. It didn’t budge. “Knock it off Rogers. I’m on a clock and this is not up for negotiation,” he broke out his reprimanding voice again, but it was going higher pitched than he’d like. It wasn’t the most intimidating words and it did nothing to deter Steve from glowering down at him.
“If the patriotic frisbee wasn’t such a giveaway,” Tony continued, just wanting Steve to know that was the only reason. It didn’t matter what their personal feelings were, Tony would never have Steve in a disadvantage in a fight like this if it was avoidable.
It had been five days since he’d met with Steve last. Tony knew better than to ignore Steve for too long. He would always take matters into his own hands if given the time. Tony knew that, but with every questioning text and missed call to the ancient technological device Tony found it harder to respond.
Hello readers!
Steve started laughing, either at Tony’s tone or the question itself. The sound cut off as abruptly as it had started. “No, if I was flirting with you I’d say your lip is healing nicely,” Steve’s voice had drifted down several octaves. The blue in his eyes heating even as they were eclipsed. “That I haven’t stopped thinking about that night and it drives me crazy when you don’t answer my calls.”
“Keep doing that and you are going to be bald by two hundred Rogers.”
“I tried to do more. I tried to do what you asked.” There was shame in having stepped away. He wasn’t giving up, but he was better suited behind the scenes than on the battlefield. Time had shown him that. How many times would he put the lives of the people he cared about on the line before he’d understood that the world was telling him the most he could do was stop pretending to be a savior and stay put in his lab?
Steve’s chuckle vibrated through him like a roll of thunder. More enthralling than a show of lighting. Tony was all but forced to cling to him. Force their mouths back together once, twice.
“Can we just-“
“You shouldn’t be here.” He’d also communicated as much on the goddamn flip phone when FRIDAY alerted him to Steve approaching the premises. He’d had about fifteen minutes to clear any personnel from the less used back entrance. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t trust the SHIELD employees not to leak any of this back to the state government it was just- It was exactly that. If his time with Natasha had taught him anything spies were generally biding their time for a chance to stab you in the back.
“I wasn’t asking about me,” Tony said, still not putting his arm down. He was getting tempted to fire a blast off on principle. This wasn’t heading anywhere good. The two Asgardian men behind her had weapons at their sides, one a broadsword and the other a spear. You didn’t walk up on a beach packing that and expect to get out without a scuffle. He still would have a better idea of how to approach this if he knew what she was after. Amora was a talker, no harm in letting her talk.
“Also, the Secretary of State is wishing to be put through to you Boss.”
It could be the beginnings of a panic attack. His anxiety making him hear phantoms of sound. When he looked up there would be nothing but the stranglehold on his throat left.
He could see Steve with blood trailing down his face. Dying, and it was no less bearable than the first time. A world where he was alive and Steve was dead… A world where the entire team was dead. A world where he wasn’t dead. It didn’t make any sense. None at all.
“I wanted to see you.” Tony could feel himself working past fear and into the anger he saw in the face of an enemy. Let it grow in him, partially hoping it would swallow him whole.
“I don’t get that one a lot.”
“Start over?” Tony asked looking up into blue eyes that appeared as earnest as the sun was bright. He blamed his heart picking up on fear. It was the easiest emotion to own up to in that moment.
Steve gave in and started really laughing hard then. Tony was so shocked at the sound of it that he just stared open mouthed until Steve had finished. If he found out he’d dreamt all of this while nodding off he would not forgive his subconscious. “Tell you what,” Steve began. “You get some sleep and you can take me wherever you want tomorrow.”
“Sure, why don’t you let me have my glasses then? You don’t fight. I’ll punch.” Tony took in their position and began to think up counter measures against it.
“Yes,” Instantaneous in his reply.
“Of course not,” a flat inflection and a step back before Tony could breathe evenly again.
“What else do you got for me?” Tony muttered, tapping rapidly against his watch. His suit was waiting and raring to go.
“We don’t know enough about what the Asgardian is up to, to clearly know how and if we can counteract.”
An ongoing problem as of late, he’d kept continuing his disappearing act. At this rate Tony was actually going to have to put surveillance on the guy. It felt like the board had been flipped around and Tony was in charge of keeping track of all the pieces. Right then, he would much rather be swiping them all onto the ground.
for beta reading this chapter, you continue to be amazing!
“You wouldn’t be giving it to me if you didn’t think it’d work,” Steve said, that annoying smirk on his face.
Peter looked mildly put out. He kept glancing at Steve nervously, not because he’d been caught-- It was a long car ride upstate and a majority of nerves related to the initial capture had run their course--Tony bet the anxiety stemmed from the way Steve was drowning everyone else out in his increased brooding energy. It wasn’t at all helped by the scruffy beard. His mouth just drawn down into a frown that could set anyone on edge.
“What about you?”
I wanted to end the year with a bang by posting a chapter of TSBU. I hope you all enjoy it. (I also promised myself I wouldn’t leave rambly paragraphs in the author’s note section, the restraint I’m showing in enormous.)
The landing was just as smooth as their initial one. Tony was up on his feet, debating whether or not to wait until he got to his quarters to take the suit off. If Steve got a solid look at him under all of the metal casing the lecture was only bound to be longer. Tony had definitely not missed that part of being together on a team. When the doors slid open, he’d been expecting the med team to be waiting. He wasn’t wrong, but who was standing in front of them was the real surprise.
Steve had other people he hung out with but these were the people he was closest to and he thought it was pretty amazing to have them.
Steve knew there was more to Natasha but he also knew pushing for it was the worst idea.
When Steve arrived in his room he just fell down on his bed and was out like a light in two minutes but his sleep was definitely not peacefully, his mind wandering around his mom and the mystery man.
Not that college was dangerous, at least not more dangerous than Brooklyn but nothing could ever make Steve feel the same as home.
Her tight close showed every curve of her body which were in perfekt proportion.
“Yeah”, said Steve “I promised my mum I would visit her this weekend.
She is complaining, that since I left for college she never gets to see me and if I wouldn't come visit her soon she would come here to visit me and then there would be drama.
“Really?” Steve raised an eyebrow, “Isn’t this place a little bit far from the campus?”
Almost out of the door he wondered if he should take his books and notes with him to study but then he just shrugged it off. He was always ahead of his work.
Sarah Rogers was not the kind of person that had a TV or even a phone in her bedroom.
Steve finds out who the man in his mothers bedroom is and he is not happy.
After he changed, he grabbed his phone, checked the time, it was now 6:13 and wrote a note to his mom that she knew why his car was in front of the house but he wasn’t there and went out of the door.
Clint ones said that being vulnerable was different and harder for Natasha than it was for most people and Steve wanted to respect that.
No he would like to look back one day at his first time and be able to say it was good, it was with the right person, a person he cared for or even loved and it was a good time.
He said goodbye to Sam and Bucky and waved to the ceiling there was a 50/50 chance Clint was up there.
Natasha was beautiful. If you looked at her you would not be able to find one mistake in her physic.
Steve and Bucky were just unpacking Bucky's stuff in his new room when Sam walked in and introduced himself.
Her arms and legs were slim and fine nobody could imagine which strength could be behind them until they witnessed it.
So he had to listen and got the bleeding fixed.
But again Steve didn't want that of course he wants to be somebody's first choice but because they knew him or want to get to know him as a person. And he wants his first time to be with someone special. The blond was aware of the fact how cheese that sounds but it was the truth.
It was just a short drive up to the house Steve used to life in making him wonder why he does not visit her more often.
The boy basically knew every stone ever bird and every tree on his route. There wasn’t much that could surprise Steve but one of these things that could was Tony Stark's car right in front of the coffee shop.
Even though Steve and Bucky were close Steve did not need to know what Bucky was doing with his partners.
When you meet Clint you might not think he could keep a secret because he talked basically nonstop, it was horrible ocean of noises whenever he and Tony saw each other, but it was most of the time just rambling.
Steve thinks about his friends while driving home.
So he decided just to go to bed. He wasn't hungry after all the chips and beer he just eat earlier the day.
In a way Clint was as secretive and mysterious about his life as Natasha they had just different hiding techniques.
He was standing in the middle of a fountain which was full of coins.
Steve looked at his Phone it was 9:30 PM not super late but he knew his mom liked to get a lot of sleep and needed it because her job as a nurse was really exhausting.
But Steve always felt dirty like an intruder when he would touch himself the the sounds.
The young college student opened his door to go to the bathroom right across the floor when he heard muffled noises and another door opening.
He also knew he wouldn't get out more of Clint.
Natasha put her body on display to hide her soul deeper but also didn't hide that she was mysterious.
Since then Bucky and he were basically attached to each others hips.
Steve still couldn't believe how many friends he had now.
After a few seconds it was obvious that the noises were people talking and one of them was definitely male. Oh fuck, his mother had a man in her bedroom. Steve starred at the door like it personally killed his puppy. How could somebody dare to touch his mother. In that moment a noise that was a mix out of a moan or a whine got through the door a voice saying “That is so nice, to have somebody that takes care of you”
Sam smirked: “You're such a Mama's boy Cap. I mean in a good way. You and your mum are close but don't you call like almost every day?”
From what Steve heard before he ran to help the boy was that he apparently took something from his big sister who was one of the girls.
Funnily enough it was with one of the girls Steve later walked in on who were busy with Bucky.
It was tradition for students who lived on the west campus to throw a coin in it before an important test for good luck.
Tony looked at his feet still sitting on the floor and not showing any signs of getting up,”Oh you now just getting coffee and breakfast”
It gave the students a sense of solidarity and being there for each other even if it is just with a few encouraging words.
Sam's dark skin was smooth and looked really soft the bright red shirt he was wearing gave a nice contrast.
He was also wearing thigh pants in which his thighs looked amazing. Bucky had a thing for strong legs.
Steve always liked that,
There was of course his childhood and best friend Bucky Barnes.
Tony shrugged “Well you know me I love good coffee and someone told me that this place had the best, so I had to check it out. I must tell you it was definitely worth it.” with these words Tony stood up and tried to get the dust of his pants.
So this weekend it was option three.
Checking the clock, he noticed that it was only 5:30. His mom would probably not be awake yet but maybe that way he could skweez in a little morning run before making some breakfast.
Then finally the man turned his head just so slightly that Steve could see half of his face and realized that this was a very young person and not just any young person but a really well known Tony Stark! What the fuck!! How? How? Why? Why was this man coming out of his mom's bedroom? Even worse the bedroom they both Tony and his Mom spend the night in together! How was that not a mean prank the universe was pulling on Steve?
Steve was back in his room I'm the matter of seconds so Tony wouldn't see him. He just couldn't understand the world anymore. He didn't know who he was more shocked by his mom or Tony? No no it had to be Tony how dare he sleep with his mom.
He could feel how a weight was lifted off his shoulders, because he knew this was home and it’s  safe.
He once told Steve that he loved when a person could wrap their legs around Bucky's head while Bucky...yeah.
Steve was pretty sure the only people who really knew Clint and Natasha were Clint and Natasha.
If he needed something else over the weekend his mom would have it at home.
Second: Nobody knows if you put money in their or not because tests were for different people at different time so if you forgot or just didn't have the money nobody would judge you like in church.
“Which brings us back to why you are here and I know it wasn’t to bring Peter over so you could rub your knowledge of him monitoring you in my face. So let’s skip past that.”
“Behind you Tony.”
“No.”
“They weren’t made for that close of range-”
Steve dragged a hand away from his hip, only needing one to keep up his punishing rhythm. Pulled at Tony’s curls hard instead. Tony responded by letting one of his hand trail underneath Steve’s shirt, what he could reach with the belted restrictions. Dragged his nails down as his palms felt the muscle. Hoped Steve would look at the quickly healing wounds and remember that Tony did this to him. Caused him to lose all control. Steve fucked into him hard enough that they reached a line where Tony wasn’t sure if he was more in pain or pleasure, just knew he loved every minute of it.
“Sure. Happy to host the living legend. Nothing to thank me about. Just doing my civic duty or something. Really it’s everyone’s tower now. Come over whenever you want. I’ll probably be back on the west coast full time again after the rebuilding of the city is done. So you don’t even have to run into me.”
“Oh.” Steve is rubbing the palm of his hand with his thumb. No, not rubbing,
“Yes.”
Him and Rhodey walk through the big glass doors and immediately Tony’s surrounded by people greeting them. He talks to them as his eyes wander around the room: everything’s been decorated in Christmas fashion since the holiday season has already taken over most of the city and Tony mentally winces.
There’s a long silence and Tony doesn’t even realize he’s holding his breath until his lungs start burning from the lack of oxygen. Steve’s eyelids are barely open, he’s falling asleep again, but before he does close his eyes, he whispers:
now!”
But the Captain had been quick to turn his head back to Fury even though he couldn’t help the clenched jaw that settled in and he still hadn’t been able to get rid of.
“You earned these,” Nat says, tapping his chest. “Why be ashamed of them?”
Everybody leaves the room but Steve frowns following Tony’s movements and after a moment of indecision, he goes after him.
“Macallan, isn’t it?”
“Why the hell didn’t you stop me!?” Tony buried his face in his hands, grunting. His cheeks felt like they had caught fire.
There's a moment of silence and Steve narrows his eyes.
They sneak around until they catch up with the mercenaries, silently following them from a distance.
It takes a few seconds for Tony to process, this dominant behavior from Steve being extremely unusual, but he does what he’s told without complaining. He’s been trying to get him to do this forever, so now that Steve’s found his confidence, he’s not going to ruin the mood. He lies down on the bed while he hears rumbling sounds, but waits patiently until he feels the mattress dip by his side. Tony lets out a small gasp when he feels Steve grabbing his wrists and closing a pair of cuffs on them and around the top of the headboard.
Steve frowns at that and approaches the bench to sit down next to her, suddenly interested.
He chooses to hide in the gym because he thinks - quite rightly - that’s the last place in the compound Tony would want to go in.
He feels a shudder as the knuckles make contact with the punching bag and the sound echoes through the big, empty compound gym.

Steve is sitting on his bed, legs bent upwards to serve as surface for his sketchbook. He’s very still, trying not to move a lot so he doesn’t scare the couple of hummingbirds hanging out on the branch directly next to his window. He looks down at the paper: not his best work. There’s a knock on the door that startles him and he shifts in the bed abruptly. He watches with sadness as the couple of birds fly away.
“Steve,
Steve feels like the room is shrinking by the minute. Every time someone walks up to him and starts chatting away, it creates a ripple effect and suddenly he finds himself helplessly surrounded by at least ten people. When his anxiety starts taking the best of him, he politely excuses himself and makes his way through the crowd as fast as he can, only to cross the room and hang out on a different corner. He’s been repeating the same procedure for nearly an hour and a half.
He can’t help it. He squeezes the hand in his as a little treacherous tear escapes the corner of his eye, so subtle it’ll surely go unnoticed. Tony stirs in the wheelchair, slowly waking up and wincing when he moves his head to the other side. The song changes as they silently stare at each other.
Tony winces at this. He remembers the pool of blood surrounding Steve’s body.
“Nat?”
“Hawkeye, do you have a visual?”
“No!” Tony cuts him off, panic quickly rising. “Let’s just… take me to the Tower.”
you every time you say something like that. Would that make you stop?”
“Tony…” Steve whines between hot, open mouthed kisses, but he’s decidingly pushing him off and Tony feels he should feel embarrassed by the whimpering noise he makes when they pull apart.
“Are you going to tell me what happened up there?”
“Good morning, Shellhead. Long time, no see.”
public events where he’s in the spotlight because it reminds him of that time he was used as a publicity stunt. Tony sighs, mentally kicking himself for even bringing it up.
Tony has to admit things escalate pretty quickly after that.
“I- I didn’t feel like being around Cap for a few days, okay?” He throws his hands in the air, defeated. “It’s no big deal, I’ll get over it. I just- I need some time to myself.”
Natasha lets out a tired breath. “Steve, I've known Stark for a long time now. Studied him, his behaviour, his personality, his severely unhealthy coping mechanisms... I

and this was so fucked up. Oh, how he would have loved Steve to get a little rough every once in a while and just use him, like this one was doing. He would have loved for Steve to talk really dirty and maybe even tell him what a cute little slut he was while Tony blowed him. He tried as hard as he could but couldn’t help his hips buckling up, looking for friction. This

Steve sighs heavily.

“What happened? I- Everything’s foggy.”
He opens his eyes and he still has his faceplate on but the suit is rebooting. He lifts it off and when he looks around, he wishes he hadn’t.
“About what?”

like Steve at all. Although his kinky ass had been trying to get Rogers to engage in some slightly more out-of-the-ordinary activities for as long as they’d been together, the answer was always a resounding no. Of course Tony loved doing all those things for Steve, but his cock twitched in his pants every time he thought about Steve tying him down and just having his way with him. He’d even suggested once that Steve topped and the look on his boyfriend’s face had been one of pure terror.
, but the other man had already finished the sentence in his mind for him and…
Then suddenly, there’d been a voice in the background. A male voice. Steve had snapped his head in the screen’s direction and his gut clenched in an uncomfortable knot.
“And tell him I have-” Steve feels the words die in his throat. God, he can’t even say it out loud to Sam, let alone confessing to Tony. “He- It would break the team up.”
He turns around to find Steve holding a short glass with a very appetizing caramel-colored fluid inside. His brain isn’t fully functional because that’s Steve, looking gorgeous and smiling sheepishly while offering him a glass of his favourite scotch.

“I’m fine,” Tony quickly assures him, waving a dismissive hand in the air.

Steve shakes his head.
He can hear one of the guys shouting and someone hurrying them:

“Well... for one, I'd like you to make this decision sober-"
“I’m busy.”

Tony clears his throat, finally getting a bit of a grip on himself. “So, how are you enjoying yourself?”
Suddenly, they hear shots coming from inside. They both look at each other and Tony breaks the silence on the comms.
Tony sighs.

Panic sinks in quickly.
“And that’s why I’ll never be good enough.“
... this inexplicable situation unfolding in front of him right now makes no sense at all and it's making his blood boil.
“Come in,” he says with a sigh.
“In a minute. Don’t mind me, I’m not even here.”
“I know it’s a lot to take in, Cap, but trust me. Things are very different now… If I’m being honest, I was kind of hurt that you didn’t want to talk to me about it, you know?” he says, taking his hand off Steve’s back and resting his elbows on his knees. “We’re friends… or at least I thought we were-”
show- I will not give him the satisfaction of seeing me all worked up about this. Nuh-uh.”
He looks at the messages again and that same warm feeling spreads through his chest, only more intense this time.
“You do, Tony. You do-”
She steps between him and the full length mirror and adjusts his khaki tie. He’s wearing his dark green military uniform because Nat had convinced him it would be a nice touch, given there were going to be several vets and high ranked officials in the crowd. The silly amount of decorations and medals hanging from the breast of his jacket already makes Steve deeply uncomfortable. It’s so
“No, you’re a middle aged man still recovering from three cracked ribs!”
Tony lifts his head, concern and a growing horror plastered across his face as ‘Steve’ looks up straight into the surveillance cameras that hang from the corners of the ceiling.
Steve’s hips roll against his and Tony’s head falls slightly back, letting out a loud, wanton moan that was by itself an answer. Steve seizes his opportunity and latches onto his exposed neck, licking and sucking and biting. Tony moans again but his brows are furrowed. What’s gotten into Steve? This is... so not like him.
Silence. Punch. Punch.
“Because Tony likes sleeping with everything that moves.” He can hear the bitterness and jealousy in his own voice, and he hates it.
Everybody agrees with him in silent nods. Well,

He gets a puzzled look that slowly turns into a frown as the meaning behind Steve’s words sinks in.

The silence that follows Steve’s words is thick one, uncomfortable and tense. Tony is still not facing him, but his movements have stilled. He seems to recover fairly quickly, though, as he returns to his tinkering with the blue screens in front of him.
Steve desperately eyes the door. He’s gotta go before he makes this any worse…
right, aren't I?" She gives him a lopsided grin of satisfaction.
“Yeah...” Tony quickly backpedals as a defense mechanism in the face of possible rejection. “I mean it’s fine if you can’t, no big deal, it was just an idea...”

Steve feels a shudder run through his body. The fact that Sam is openly speaking about it, like it’s no big deal at all, it’s both liberating and… unsettling. He’s been hiding for so long, trying to
“The truth, Tony. That what he said hurt your feelings. Hear him out, maybe he wants to apologize...” Rhodey explains as he sighs, the way you would when you’re trying to make your point to a five year old.
Sam walks over the bed and sits next to him to rest an empathic hand on his shoulder.
Tony can feel the tears pooling in his eyes, vision getting blurry. He didn’t- he didn’t love that

His head falls forward as he takes a deep breath, apparently trying to regain some self control. He manages to do so because when he speaks, his voice is a lot softer. “Do you really think I’d ever lay a hand on you?”
And they’re close, they’re
life. He’d been trying to distance himself from that image, subconsciously trying to make Steve see him as something other than a slutty manwhore who would get in the sack with anyone that glanced his way. It had never seem to make much of a difference to Steve that he stopped fooling around, but he hadn’t even been in the mood for it the past few months regardless. He’d been starting to notice a shift in his preferences when it came to checking out people, too. They were always blond, tall, strong guys. Preferably with light blue eyes. It took Tony an embarrassing amount of time for a genius to put two and two together, but once he did, that’s all he could see when he looked at them: Captain fucking America.
But Steve doesn’t move. It’s a little insulting how he’s just standing there looking concerned for him, like he’s not carrying sixty pounds of steel in his arms.
Steve bites down on his neck,
Tony panics and starts pulling at the handcuffs.
“On it. JARVIS, zoom in on that panel.”
Tony stumbles forward. To the untrained eye, he just looks like he’s casually strolling towards him. Tony’s eccentricity always works in his favor in these situations. However, Steve knows better. He is drunk, as he’d suspected.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he says as he cradles his left arm and stacks three of boxes of capsules against his chest.
Tony turns around and the minute he lays eyes on Steve, his heart melts. The broad, muscled blond is looking at him like a little puppy begging his owner to go for a walk.
Punch.
PUNCH

Just a few minutes go by before he hears the elevator doors sliding open. He doesn’t bother to look up though, it can only be…
‘Steve’ takes advantage of the fact that Tony’s mouth is still wide open, gasping for air, to shove two fingers in it, coating them with saliva. When he removes them, he lifts himself off to crawl down his body, knees nudging Tony’s legs open.
Tony is an inch away from him and the strong smell of scotch reaches Steve’s nose. Tony’s clutching the front of his jacket, holding him against the wall and his eyes are wild and unfocused and Steve is suddenly a scared kid again.
Turns out when it comes to Tony, Steve has zero chill.
“Please, please don’t...”
She walks towards him. “You’re right, you are opposites. And sometimes that works to our advantage because what one might miss, the other spots. The skills one of you lacks, the other compensates for. You keep saying telling him how you feel would change things for the team, but things have

The toaster spit out the bread with a loud ‘ding’ sound. Steve’s movements stilled for a second, but he regained composure quickly and spread some butter over the toast and grabbed his mug, turning to leave. Tony couldn’t quite understand why Steve was grinning in an almost mischievous way until he walked past him on his way to the elevator and muttered:
“Sure you don’t.”
Particularly hard punch. More silence.
“Where do you want it?”
“Like a
‘Steve’ is pounding into him, relentlessly hitting that spot, while jerking him off at the same pace. Neither of them last very long. Tony comes first, screaming Steve’s name, his orgasm hitting him so hard he sees little white dots behind his tightly closed eyelids. ‘Steve’ follows soon after, groaning at the way Tony’s clenching around him rhythmically, still riding the post-waves of his orgasm.
“Well, it’s not like you’ve given me much of a heads up.”
He doesn’t say it... because he knows it’s true and because that hurts. He can feel Steve turning towards him on the couch. He flinches a little and blinks rapidly to keep the tears from falling when the blond grabs his wrist and squeezes. He can’t look at him, but there’s a hand on the side of his face that makes him turn.
“There’s no

Tony’s gaze snaps up and after a second, he frowns, confused. “Why what?” he slurs and Steve feels sickened.

“Let’s review those reasons for a second, shall we?” Natasha says casually, standing up from the couch and walking slowly around the room.
Tony’s eyebrows fly up, looking confused. He was expecting a punch, not a lecture.
He tries to remember what happened the night before.

Steve laughs. “The brand. That’s the one you like, right? And don’t worry, I was very specific, see?” He wiggles the glass in front of him. “No ice.”
.” Tony blinks. This conversation feels so surreal that it borders on ridiculous. He wants to laugh his ass off, but Steve looks so exposed and vulnerable right now, he feels he might take it the wrong way if he does. He blinks again. “Okay.”
‘Steve’ pulls out of him roughly, panting a little and running his fingers over the sensitive hole with a smirk on his face.
Steve frowns and eyes him for a second before he slowly moves towards the bench. “Ok...”
Why had Steve pushed him away? What had he done wrong? Wait, was he- did he read this wrong? But he had kissed him back! Tony’s head feels like it’s been hit by Mjolnir all the sudden. Steve must recognize the terror in his eyes because he’s quick to clarify.
“Of course. ‘Genius, billionaire,
“Je baiserai ce cul toute la nuit…*” Tony sighed, smirking at her and raising his eyebrow.
Her scrutinizing gaze and her spot on analysis leave Steve’s mind in a haze. He thinks for a minute, really trying to come up with something else, anything else. He finally gives up with a sigh - he might as well come clean.
after?”
Steve swallows. “It’s- is it a big event? With- uh… a lot of people?”
“Man, you’re so obvious around him!” He pats his friend on the back. “Honestly, I think the only one who still doesn’t notice is him.”
Nat has turned his back against the counter, leaning on it as she eyes him silently and sips her coffee. Tony has never been more jealous of the woman. God, he
“Hey, hey, hands off! You’re drenched in smelly water.” Tony tried to hide his arousal with a laugh.

“Then why?”
“Don’t you think you should hit the shower first, Captain Gross?”
Punch. Punch.
Punch. Punch. Punch.
“So… you wanna tell me about it?”

After what seems like an eternity, the blond lets go of Tony’s head and pulls out, a string of spit connecting his cock to the abused pair of panting lips.
After a minute of just staring at each other like

“Let me go,” he murmurs, and there’s a hint of sadness there that Tony will surely miss, because it’s Tony.
“Tony!”
Some random, blond, tall, muscular guy in the background of Tony’s bedroom, stepping out of a door dripping wet, in nothing but a small towel wrapped low around his hips.
Steve pulls back at the same time he frees the top button of his pants and undoes the fly, slipping a hand straight under the waistband of Tony’s boxer briefs and grabbing his hardening cock.
The memory makes Tony ask JARVIS to play, at a very low volume, Steve’s playlist from the workshop. He figures even if he’s still asleep, maybe he can hear it. He would feel better with his music.
He tried not to think about it but Steve’s look of disappointment and anger was embedded in his mind like a tiny splinter under the skin. Everytime he brushed past the memory it stung like a bitch. He knew what Steve thought about one-night stands and his

“It’s
“I--” Steve stops abruptly. He goes back as far as he can, searching through his memory for an unfamiliar face in an oversized t-shirt clutching a coffee mug. He frowns. “Well, uh--”
Natasha smiles.
Tony’s eyes widened as tried not to gag on his coffee when he couldn’t help spit it out, coughing so hard some of it went up his nose. When he recovered, the elevator doors were already closing and Natasha was laughing silently, covering her mouth with her fist.
He needed another drink.
She flashed him her signature smartass smile and snatched the coffee pot from Tony’s hands.

to work out at all?”
“You know how he gets when he’s on one of his tinkering sprees. Don’t read too much into it.”
“Humor me, Rogers.” He sighs and silently nods, an expression of resignation on his face. “The reason you can’t tell Tony how you feel is...”
That Hydra clone is right. He really is broken.

Tony loses his patience and closes the tiny little space between them. This kiss is nothing like the one on the roof. This kiss is heated, it’s wet, it’s passionate and deep. It's full of longing and emotions and secrets and pain. Tony's lips dance softly against Steve’s like waves and, after what feels like a lifetime, he pulls away to breathe in harshly, opening his mouth just a little to let his tongue poke out and slip past the blond’s parted lips. He tries to hold back and not ravish him, but when their tongues first touch, Steve

He closes his eyes with a sigh and as soon as he does, he sees Steve’s face full of disapproval and his outraged flared nostrils. He wants to punch him for some reason.
Natasha cuts him off with a sigh. “Do I really need to answer that question?”
He hears Steve chuckle and for the first time ever in his relationship, he feels fear. This isn’t... it doesn’t feel safe anymore. Something’s wrong.
When ‘Steve’ removes his hand, he’s panting, neck uncomfortably twisted to look at the blond in disbelief.
“It appears Captain Rogers was granted access using Colonel Rhodes’ ID card, Sir.”
“Can’t think of any?”
It was stupid. He knew Tony was anything but chaste. However, seeing it with his own eyes…
Steve went over to the fridge and retrieved some butter, his back turned to them. Tony couldn’t help himself as his eyes roamed through the broad shoulders, down to the small waist and that peachy ass, the globes looking so appetizing trapped in the loose cotton. Tony could almost taste the flesh under his imaginary bite…

“Tony, it sounds to me like he was

“Answer me, you little whore!”
Tony cringed internally and quickly decided that he didn’t have the brains or the proper amount of caffeine in his body to fool this woman, so he just sighed and gave up.
“The change in the relationship dynamic could affect the team and jeopardize our duties as Avengers.”
Tony nods to himself. Good, that’s good. All the gang together, impressing the biggest fish in New York. He hates playing nice to half of these assholes, but good networking means more projects for the Foundation, and that means more people getting the help they need. It’s not just about money - he’s got plenty of that - it’s about being in good graces with investors and CEOs of different companies in various areas and have them work together to create social and environmental projects. Even if the other companies only did it for the PR, Tony felt like this was his duty. He owed it to his mother to make sure this organization fulfilled its purpose.
“Sorry about that. Go on, Nickie.”
The first concern on the genius’ mind, however, had been whether or not Steve’s sweet words before he passed out that night had been nothing more than the sedatives talking. Tony confronted him about it as soon as Steve woke up again, the drugs fully out of his system, and he reassured him.
He keeps chanting in his head, in a desperate attempt to control the physical reactions he’s having, because this
Natasha sighs, exasperated and sits up. “Ok then. What do you want to do?”
, so much, but I also… I wanna do this right.”
That’s when Steve’s mind goes into override.
Tony blinks a couple of times, like his brain is working on making sense of Steve’s words. When he does, he snorts angrily. “Oh, I’m sorry Mrs. Doubtfire, I didn’t realize I was being babysat tonight-“
“They’re coming in through the main entrance.”
Tony gives him a small, tired smile. “What you are is a pain in the ass, but you already know that, right?”
“What? Do you want me to put on a show for you?” the smaller man says, halfway through unbuttoning his shirt.
He hears the metal bar creak and bend slightly under his grip. He forces himself to take a deep breath, trying to remember to remain calm.

“Shrapnel” he whispers, breathless. “
if I’m not a walking, talking Captain America encycloped-“
There’s a heavy silence that follows Tony’s rant and lasts for what feels like an eternity. Tony grabs the bottle from the glass table in front of him and pours himself another drink. Something in his mind is yelling at him that that’s the worst idea right now, but when does he ever listen to the responsible part of his brain, anyway? As the liquid pours messily into the glass - and some of it out - Tony hears Steve’s heavy footsteps as he walks to him and sits on the sofa by his side, careful to leave space between him and the brunette. Tony looks at the gap between them and huffs. He’s probably scared that he’ll jump on him again and the thought makes him bitter and depressed.
The order sends a shiver of anticipation down his spine. He doesn’t know what the fuck’s gotten into his boyfriend but he likes it.

And right there, for a second, in a blink-and-miss moment, his eyes landed on Steve. Not on Nat, Clint, Rhodey or Sam.
“Yeah... you’re hating this.” He hears ‘Steve’ laugh softly in amusement and God he wants to die of embarrassment. “I guess that’s why you’re spreading your legs for me like a bitch in heat, isn’t it?”
“Hey,” he cuts him off, palms in the air as a sign of surrender “I’m the one who acted like an idiot. I didn’t- I should have waited-”
Steve stirs in his sleep and Tony doesn’t think twice about it, he leans forward in the wheelchair and places a hand over his arm to still him.
He wonders for a second, narrowing his eyes at the blank screen. He has to be bluffing, surely.
“Steve.” He corrects from behind him.
Both of them turned around startled. Steve was walking into the room as the elevators’ doors closed behind him. He was smiling brightly – that annoyingly-perfect white smile of his – and coming over to the kitchen area. His forehead was sweaty and some gold strands of hair stuck to it. His baby blue t-shirt was soaking wet and it clung to his muscles (abs, pecs, shoulders, back… all of them) in an extremely sinful way that left very little to the imagination. He was wearing a pair of loose grey cotton sweatpants that gracefully fit his perfectly round ass. Tony crossed his legs under the table, knowing very well what was already going on in his lower region and wanting to avoid causing a scene he wouldn’t be able to explain. Why did he have to look so ridiculously hot
A pathetic little moan escapes him, as well as a silent tear from the corner of his eye while he chokes on ‘Steve’s cock and his own shame.
Steve lets out a ragged breath and looks down at the destroyed punching bag.
“Steve--”
He hears the man hum in approval and the bed shifts. The sound of him fumbling with clothes makes his stomach drop. This can’t be happening.
on my- how shall we put it? Lifestyle choices? He hates homosexuals, basically.”
naive sometimes… He laughs softly. “Of course it’s the museum!”
Steve had tried really hard not to eye the screen in a lustful way, keeping his gaze either on the documents in front of him or his own lap.
Natasha sighs and rises up from the bench, knowing defeat when she sees it.
“It’s been an honor, Capt’n” he says with a cruel smile on his face and salutes ceremoniously towards the device.
Natasha sat down next to him and eyed him carefully while she sipped from her own mug. That calculating, calm and scrutinizing gaze always made Tony want to cover himself, even if he was fully clothed. It felt like being under an emotional x-ray and it was so fucking uncomfortable. She lifted her legs and rested her calves over the corner of the table, dangling her feet off.
Tony breaths in annoyedly and crosses his arms over his chest, leaning back on the chair. “Whatever,” he murmurs, quite childishly.
No, that wasn’t true.
“Please... please, don’t” his plea was barely audible.
Punch
“He left the party in a rush, which meant he was fleeing from something. His face was a deep shade of pink, and it wasn’t from the alcohol, so he was embarrassed. Also he had dried his eyes but the sclera was reddish, so he must have cried. Then you came down, practically bursting through the door and frantically looking around the room, so you were chasing after him,” she explained as if it were the most obvious line of thought. “I’m guessing… you guys had a fight, one thing led to another, you kissed and then he ran away ashamed.”
Natasha yawns as she stretches over the couch while Steve’s left gaping in the middle of the common living room.
“Yes,
, as you’d say.”
She snorts. “Tell me something I don’t know.” She pauses and lifts up a brow. “Besides, you’re no walk in the park either.”
“Tony-”
He wants to snap at him, he really does, but he’s way too focused on this goddamn stupid mission and Steve’s hurtful words are still echoing through his mind.

“Well, so much for friendship!” Tony stands up, outraged. “Why should

He lets Steve take him to his bedroom, following after him like a lost puppy.
Tony starts walking back to the sofa, trying really hard not to stumble or slur and failing miserably at both. “You know, everyone’s always giving
Rhodey rolls his eyes as he shifts from foot to foot. “That is completely false and you know it. I’m not taking anybody’s side, I’m just saying, the guy tried to reach out! In his own way, but he tried. Just- talk to him.”
“I wouldn’t leave your side,” he assures him as he raises a solemn hand to his chest and the other one in the air, as if he were swearing an oath. He drops his arms with a loud thud against his thighs and smirks at him. “Is that a yes?”
“Tony-”
“I’m sorry, Tony. I- I asked Rhodey to let me down, I needed to talk to you and-”
Punch.

It’s just jealousy and he knows it. Nevertheless, he needs to be angry at Tony right now. He needs a reason to justify snapping at him when he goes back down and tells him he’s leaving…
The last punch throws the bag across the room and the sand spreads through the floor of the gym.
“You know,” Tony explains, “the gala SI hosts to raise money for the foundation named after my mom.” Steve doesn’t miss the detail of Tony’s juggling of words to avoid mentioning his mother’s name. “I thought, you know, if you guys could make an appearance, it would boost people’s interest...”
“He’s alive. And if you behave, we’ll keep him that way.”
. The shame and the self-hatred is just as intense as the jolts of pleasure coming from his groin.
Rhodes looks at him intently, calculating his next move. Tony can see how he’s carefully constructing his next question - because of course there’s gonna be questions. He leans against the desk next to Tony, sticking his hands in his pockets.
“Nothin’ to talk ‘bout,” Steve says as he hangs the bag and takes position.
“I want you to feel exposed and vulnerable and I want to see you
“Slower” Steve orders from the shadows when Tony picks up the pace.
“You feelin’ okay?”
He physically bites his own tongue to prevent anything else from coming out of his big mouth and grabs the towel sitting on the bench, walking towards the door ready to storm off the gym without even looking back, but Tony in his infinite stupidity has the audacity to grab his forearm as Steve passes him by.
Natasha and Steve ride quietly back to the compound in their issued black Audi. He suspects she just faked exhaustion to give Steve an excuse to leave and he’s ever so grateful for that. The minute he steps into the facility, he’s already asking JARVIS to give him access to Tony’s floor.
“On the bed. Face down.”
, Tony.” He grabs his neglected cock firmly and smears the precome over the head with his thumb. Tony’s hips jerk off the bed as he moans loudly and he feels his face catching fire. ‘Steve’ laughs again, pleased. “You want this.”
Wrong choice. Tony immediately lost interest in the conversation and waved a dismissive hand.
“I--” Steve really doesn’t want to talk about it but it has nothing to do with trust. He fears if he says it out loud, it’ll become too real to ignore, and he wants to forget what he saw. It hurts a little less if he avoids it. “There’s no reason for me to be angry at Tony.”
Tony breathes with difficulty but nods his head, very slowly, eyes wide in fear.
” he hears ‘Steve’s voice.
And Steve winces because that hurts. It hurts a lot. He’d been honest with Tony about his anxiety when exposed to big crowds and now he just used it as a poisonous arrow, aimed directly to cause pain. He’s angry, he’s disappointed and he remembers the young man at the party and his nostrils flare and it’s all too much. He feels his upper lip retract and he spits his next words like they’re venom.
Tony lays on his bed, the image of Steve’s clenched up jaw and condemning gaze still painfully fresh. He’s already kicked the guy out as politely as possible.
“Okay...” Happy eyes him through the rearview mirror, clearly aware that something’s up.
me?” Tony can’t help the surprised chuckle.
not to drink too m-”
“Say it. Say my name, Tony.”
the one who’s got every right to be angry.”
. When he talks, his breath falls over Tony’s swollen cock and it makes him tremble.
“Mercenaries were discussing who was taking the intel to the boss and the argument got heated, a few shots were fired,” he pauses, apparently trying to decide the best way to go on. “Steve and Nat were hidden and had turned off the comms to avoid being detected, so when you tried to contact them, they didn’t hear you.” Tony frowns and closes his eyes. He didn’t… He didn’t think of that. He could have asked JARVIS to give him a scan of the room to check for Steve’s and Nat’s body heat signatures. He could have approached carefully and tried to get a visual on them. He could have done so many things - less risky things - but as soon as he heard the gunshots all he could think about was
“You don’t want me to take this seriously because then I would be forced to do something about it.” Smile sliding off his face. Chin jutting out in defiance at this captain of his. Don’t make me do it running through his mind.
When the door opened to his apartment in the tower there weren’t a lot of people it could have been. One footstep in he knew or maybe he’d known the whole time and that was the confirmation he needed. Steve seemed good at giving people distance when they needed it unless that person was Tony Stark. At every corner, Tony turned to try and tuck tail and run he was standing there. Not letting him get very far.
“Steve,” he responded, most likely out of politeness. A pointless answer to an implied demand for reciprocation. Steve had moved over to one of the other workbenches. Curiously reaching out to touch one of the many projects Tony had there.
He knew the answer.
“Nothing. I love it when you talk about technology I only half understand.”
Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth. Not wanting to hear another word of it, afraid of coming too quickly if he did. Steve brought a finger into his mouth, thrusting harder because of it. Tony gasped at the sensation of Steve’s tongue sliding over it as he pounded into him. Steve bit down. Tony cried out and retracted his hand quickly before more damage could be done. Before he wanted more damage done.
“You’re one to talk.”
Meeting small rings of blue that were more familiar than his own eyes was startling. It reflected back everything he’d ever felt. Ever thought. All the moments of restraint because the world would come crashing down the second they came together. Tony waited for his vision to be filled with rubble next. Breathed in a shaky breath that Steve was temporarily allowing him. Tony looked down at all the complicated straps and zippers happening in Steve’s outfit.
Tony snorted. “They didn’t know how stubborn you are obviously.”
“I think I just said that. The pleats, Cap, the pleats.” On anyone else those khakis would have been a complete disaster. Steve’s legs were nice enough that he could get away with it, barely… But when you looked as good as Steve you shouldn’t be barely getting away with anything.
“Think I said that Cap.” Tony tried to not let anything telling into his own voice. Trying not to show how shaken he was by hearing that voice. One that couldn’t seem to leave his thoughts or dreams. He should be attempting to determine the level of hostility present without riling Steve up. “Oh right, should probably figure out a new nickname. Not exactly Captain America anymore are you?”
“I don’t want to fight,” Steve said and it appeared honest. He may have not have grown up with Tony’s childhood, but he sure lied like he had.
Peter shouted Happy’s name as he neared the building’s entrance. Tony grimaced and his hand went from carding through his hair to tugging at the strands.
Tony huffed. “You’re staying right here. I can’t have the public seeing us together before we get the Accords hammered out. It would be a nightmare and I’d lose leverage I need to get you back here legally.”
“I think it’s cute.” Tony knew if he looked at Steve, he’d be smiling. He had enough restraint not to look, ignoring the pull in his stomach.
Tony looked down at himself. At his scars and heaving chest. Back up to Steve who had straightened and was staring at him with the kind of reverence reserved for deities. Tony knew then that Steve would tear him apart searching for the answers only a body could give. Take him to pieces to figure out the truth of this. Tony would let him, help him, because he’d wanted this for as long as he could remember. Lied to himself about it into the ages. There was no more room for that, no more air left to breathe a single word of contradiction.
“Iron Man,” Amora purred at his approach. “Just in time for the fireworks.”
“How did your shields hold up?”
Steve smiled instead. “No, it’s alright. I should talk about them more. If it wasn’t for my mom- I was a pretty sick kid. I’m sure you’ve seen my pre-serums files.”
“And the extra padding on the arms won’t be bulky? I’m worried about restricted movement.”
Tony could pretend he had. Fake drunkenness. Use it to his advantage when Steve let his guard down. “Just thinking about it. Have all these new responsibilities with you gone. Weird kid keeps hanging around. Good influence, you know the drill. Sorry, did know the drill.”
“I was under the impression that the alarm still meant we assemble,” Steve said giving them both one of his more sterner expressions. Tony was under the impression that clothing wasn’t an optional part of said assembly, looked like they would both be reeling from new found revelations.
“Surprised you have someone so young on the team.” Disapproval.
Steve stuck his hand out. “I’m Steve Rogers. You may know me as Captain America.” A teasing nature to the words.
Tony had been told that he’d learned to invent before he’d learned to walk. He’d grown up in his father’s workshops and those of SI all throughout childhood. Tony may have some grievances for how his childhood went, but he could never completely begrudge the inanimate objects that had come to surround him like family. That had made him into who he was just as much as he had made them into what they were. Science, mechanics had become a safety net. A place to fall back to, a place that he could come out of with something bright and new that could impact the world in a different way than before.
“Tony-”
“Talks a lot.”
“I get the big picture Stark.”
“Couldn’t shut up about you,” Tony said because even now there was something about that smile. He’d wager Howard had screwed him up real good because even now a smile could be everything despite the pain that surrounded it. “Do you have to keep telling people you are from Brooklyn? Everyone knows that. It’s like knowing the capital of,” Tony paused looking for a word. “Massachusetts.”
Steve lightly shoved into his shoulder playfully. Tony looked down at his own arm with scrutiny. “It wasn’t really on me. I think I did everything possible to endanger my health, drove Ma and Bucky up the wall. I just got stuck in a mindset where any day could be my last, so I couldn’t let a day go by where I didn’t stand up for what I believe in. Do you know what I mean?”
“-Having experienced it up close I can make adjustments. FRIDAY got a lot of reading that should be helpful.”
Ignoring the barb, “The spider boy?”
Steve said things like that. Empty words. They didn’t matter.
“I’m not getting there until noon at the earliest Captain Rogers,” Tony responded back with a patented smirk. He’d be there after he consumed every hangover cure known to mankind.
“There’s your opening,” he had no doubt Steve would take advantage of it. “Get the civilians into the helicarrier. I’m going after Amora.” He shot up from the ground, adjusting his angle to catch up to where she was over the water. The green energy was permeating every wave that lapped impatiently against the shore. He didn’t need a visual timer to know they were in a countdown now.
wouldn’t think that,” Tony responded dryly, still in a daze.
Tony ignored that sentence. He ignored every letter within every word of it.
Only when Tony imagined Steve, he was never questioning.  Unsure. There wasn’t any lightness or concern in the depths of his iris. He didn’t hesitate to move closer into his space. This Steve hesitated. Took in Tony’s languid pose on the couch. His rumpled up shirt and loose pants, mussed up curls and the lack of stylization with his facial hair. This Steve’s mouth turned down in a deep frown.
The reminder of the exercise was pointless. Terror had him right where it wanted. Steve was knelt over Tony barely breathing at all. It did nothing but emphasize the height and size disparity. Steve didn’t let go of either of his hands. The one held against the glass was in a tighter hold than the one pinned to his side. Tony debated kicking Steve but didn’t quite have the leverage for it.
“You look amazing.”
“You’re right,” he repeats with a sigh, looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows and contemplating the New York skyline "I haven't shared enough of me with you." He rubs his hands together, Tony notices, just like he always does when he’s nervous. There's a long silence in which neither of them speak or look at each other. The air in the room is dense and Tony keeps looking down at the glass in his hand, waiting, not knowing exactly what for. Then Steve takes a deep breath and speaks in a very soft, very low voice. “When my father lost his job, he started drinking heavily. Soon enough he lost all touch with reality and he would just sit in that couch, staring into the void and occasionally yelling at us. At first it was only yelling, name calling, that sort of thing. But it got real bad real fast.” He stops for a couple of seconds and it’s quite obvious he’s trying to keep his voice steady. “He couldn’t hold down a single job for more than a couple of days because he would show up wasted. Then one night, my mom was making dinner and they started fighting because he had been fired again, and he just.. snapped. Slapped my mom right across the face. Broke her lip. I was scared, so scared Tony, but I just ran and threw myself on top of her, begged him to stop. He took out his belt-”
Steve nodded tightening the various straps of an outfit Tony had designed. It was for the Shield agents and wasn’t tailored to Steve’s wide shoulders, but he still managed to make it work.
“What do you mean by tripped?”

“The man behind the mask?” Steve questioned. Appearing thoughtful, bottom lip pursed as he looked around a room that held no answers. Tony knows, he had looked.
“I’m scanning for heat signatures and it looks like the police did a decent job. Probably forty or so civilians within the perimeter, most are leaving in the correct directions. The majority of them would sustain little no impact from their current positioning. Blockades have successfully been set up. I’m only getting seven humans deep within the perimeter that would without a doubt result in fatalities…” Tony frowned, squinting at the screens he’d brought up. “They’re on the beach with the Asgardian.”
“Haven’t had time to send out invitations yet. Promise I’ll send you one,” Tony lied. “So no need to come hunt me down.” He plastered a media worthy smile on his face even as his legs trembled. Wouldn’t it be simpler if that were the extent of it? Steve condemning his and Pepper’s relationship. Tony could handle that. Couldn’t handle much more at this point.
“Contrary to popular belief, the fake flattery comes off as condescending. Try not to bring anymore kidnapped children to the facility Rogers. I’ll see you and your band of criminals at nine tomorrow morning.” Tony straightened out his suit. Steve tracked every movement wordlessly. He took the win much more gracefully than Tony would have. Appearing more solemn than anything else.
Steve could still feel tears framing his face he couldn’t see tony now, he couldn’t see his mate, his pregnant mate like this because of him.
On the top of the file Pepper placed a wedding band and his broken in half dog-tags with one half still attached to the chain and all fight left Steve.
Tony needs Steve to have an answer for all of this, a reason, a reason compelling enough to make Steve wanna do this, a reason worth it for their relationship to be broken like this. He doesn’t want to carry this weight alone, he has this cardinal need of sharing this weight with Steve.
“Could you please come here?”
Tony had opened the curtains the moment he had regained the consciousness, he tells pepper he never wants to be cold again.
He is just doing these because he is the only one who can do it, so no point being a child, hiding his toys, disagreeing to share.
“Just go Steve, there’s nothing left anymore.”
Rhodey and Pepper were looking at the doctor dumfounded, they didn’t know how to react.
“God! You need to sleep kid and eat something that’s not sandwiches”
Steve nodded.
“You sure about that?” asked pepper
Pepper repressed a wince then then plastered a smile and said “We will try our best. Thank you, Doctor.”
The concept of having his baby was so foreign to Tony , it made him feel so profoundly overwhelmed as if his mind was reeling to grasp the concept that he actually was going to have a baby, his own baby.
“Tony please, just please listen to me I am sorry , I will fight for you, I won’t let you go. You are my husband Tony, my mate, you are my one in a million, you gave me a home Tony, you made me love the future, my chance and my future too, so no I won’t, I won’t let you go, you my kid I won’t let it go so easily.”
“I am not letting you go Tony, I refuse….I will….I cannot…for you Tony…for our child…..Tony…
He can’t meet, can’t look at Steve not now, not right now.
Steve’s head snaps up as if he is hearing his name for the first time. He tries to takes a step with all the energy he can muster, he takes a step towards Tony.
“I said you need to leave. You here is making a lot of people antsy with you being a fugitive and all and I can’t deal with the added stress.”
Tony ran a hand over his chest and realized there was heavy bandages on his chest, he panicked and tore off the buttons from his chest and opened his shirt. Under his shirt was his chest heavily bandaged but for the life of him he couldn’t figure out from where did that come.
The silence was pricking Steve, in spite of  being filled with ex-shield agents, guard ,and doctors the compound was eerily quiet, as if at any moment the walls would start speaking weaving tales about the humans that had once occupied those rooms. He wondered what would they say about him.
He opened the file and began reading
“Yes Tony, yes a baby, we are going to be there Tony, every step of the way, you are going to have a baby.”
Wait. Pre-natal what?
He had to be there for Tony, he had to face the consequences of his actions, he was going to do anything, anything that Tony needed just to earn his forgiveness.
End flashback
“Oh Anthony!”
“Anthony?”
Today was a tough day, lately a lot of days have been tough. Howard was home today, Howard was also drunk.
“You have to understand we thought his heart was going to stop but thank god it didn’t, his baby is fine, though he did give us a scare, his chest is going to be heavily bandaged, he had multiple broken ribs, we had to stabilize him. He is unconscious right now, he does have a heavy concussion so he has to be monitored for some time. His baby needs to be monitored. As to when is he going to wake up, it is a little difficult to say given his current state.” explained the doctor
There was a sharp intake of breath behind him, Jarvis knew what Tony was thinking at this exact moment, realizing why he was here, what was going on.
“Nothing has ever been easy for you Tony” replied Jarvis
Steve are you listening to me?
Steve took a step out of the washroom and towards Tony’s room, his legs were cold, they felt like jelly, his hands were shivering, he was pretty sure it was hot outside.
“ I think you are here to understand few things, maybe you have come to old me for some good old fashion advice.” said Jarvis
“Well, you can’t teach an old dog a new trick.” replied Tony.
Jarvis walked from the middle of the room towards Tony and sat beside him.
Jarvis chuckled.
The hospital staff had given them Tony’s stuff his blood stained shirt, his trousers, his wedding ring, his broken in half dog-tags. All of them had been collected by pepper.
“Yeah you are”
“You are not cold Tony, heartbroken definitely.” said Jarvis.
Somewhere in a safe-house on the outskirts of Ethiopia-
Steve looked at the dog-tags and couldn’t decide whether they depicted his heart, Tony’s heart or Tony’s broken trust.
Steve takes a step towards him. In the next moment there is a red and gold gauntlet encasing itself around Tony’s right hand and the repulsors start to charge up
Rhodey was on his bed on Tony’s left side. It was cruel because in all of the scenarios he had imagined him and tony always side by side this was not one of them, never one of them. Vision was sitting on the sofa at the further corner of the room trying to still grasp the situation, still blaming himself for rhodey’s legs and now for Tony’s state. The spiderkid had called happy a lot of times trying to know how Tony was, happy would go out of the room every time to talk to him and console him and reassure him that everything was fine.
They couldn’t afford something like this back then but it had never been about being able to afford it or not, he could have given Tony a tin foil ring and Tony would have given the same answer, it was about keeping his promise, it was about trying his best everyday to keep the man of his dreams happy and it had been a coincidence that Tony had liked the ring and it had coincided with Steve’s plan of renewing their vows. They couldn’t have the wedding of their dreams back then but now that  they had a more firm footing, stability,  now that he could do it, he wanted to give Tony everything he deserved, fulfil his promise.
