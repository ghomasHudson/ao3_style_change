John makes a sympathetic sound in response. “He must have been really worried about you.”
Sherlock crawled off of John like a reluctant panther, somehow still sleek and elegant even while conveying his profound disappointment at having to part with John’s naked body for one second.
Ignoring the sailors who are readying his launch (which has still yet to be lowered into the water), the captain strides directly past the man from shore and climbs down the side of the ship into the boat he just arrived in, giving the order in broken Portuguese for the men piloting the boat to cast off.
Sherlock knows better than anyone that it’s impossible not to smile when John laughs like that, but who is
“How was that?”
So he stays in the flat, haunted by memories, sitting sometimes for hours at a time staring at Sherlock’s chair, his chemistry set, his violin, the bullet holes in the wall, until he comes back to himself and it is dark outside, the empty hallway gaping like an open wound, the corners of the room lost in shadow.
What if John’s worry over Sherlock’s wellbeing was simply motivated by concern, nothing more than that?
There has to be.
In the aftermath of his brush with danger yesterday, and his subsequent terror and worry over John, Sherlock completely forgot about the detail in the sailors’ conversation that had most grabbed his interest. The sailors had mentioned that the ship was going to make port in Rio, but Sherlock had no idea they were so close to the South American city.
John crawls onto Sherlock’s bed first, unable to stop a tiny groan from escaping his lips as the mattress sinks under him, tugging the thin sheet up over his legs before reaching out an arm for Sherlock, holding the corner open for him.
John reaches a hand out to cup Sherlock’s jaw, tilting Sherlock’s eyes up to his own. They are full of flame.
“Good day to you, Mr. Holmes.”
Fifty feet to John’s left, a second boat was being lowered to the water and was almost halfway down when the same lurching motion overtook it, turning the boat violently on its side.
They both stare at it in Sherlock’s hands.
He sucked hard on Sherlock’s neck as his hand began to move, wanting to leave a mark there, letting his teeth bruise the skin as his thumb slid over the moisture on the tip.
“But John,” he begins, laughter already spilling in around his words. There is a curious feeling unspooling in Sherlock’s chest that makes it difficult to get the rest of the words out. “Don’t you see? That’s exactly the idea!”
They found Lestrade just inside the front hall with a team of other officers. John released a quiet breath of relief he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. Even the sight of Andersen, standing with his head bowed next to Sergeant Donovan, was a reassuring sight. It meant they weren’t alone in this.
“Did he say anything else when you gave him the first letter?”
The men are doggedly silent. Sherlock can feel their resistance in the air around him as clearly as if they were shouting it.
John slowed the movement of his fist, but didn’t stop pumping until every last emission was wrung from Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock collapsed against him, breathless and shaking.
“But… won’t it seem suspicious?  Why would I go to him all of a sudden to tell him that? Won’t… won’t he assume I’m working with you?”
. Her exploration of so many of the side characters in OFD is rich and wonderful--do yourself a favor and read it. After all, it will give you something to do while waiting for the next chapter of OFD! :D
Sherlock leans forward to press a curious hand against John’s stomach, to feel the muscles flexing in John’s abdomen as he strokes, his eyes raking over John with awed wonder, and John’s breath leaves him in a long hiss.
“It isn’t.” Sherlock is stubbornly belligerent, still thinking of all the people he’s met and hated over the years. “It isn’t difficult at all to know that you’re worth a hundred of them.”
“But how is it possible?” He can feel how tightly his body is gripping John’s finger, and John has not pushed it farther than the first knuckle. How could he possibly take more than just one finger? Much less something much, much thicker…
Molly nods, looking nervous, but determined.
“Good evening,” she says to her shoes, before dropping into an exaggerated curtsy.
Sherlock watches him go with a tight feeling in his chest, trying not to think about how long it might be before John has the chance to write to him again.
“Yeah—Yes, that’s—”
Sherlock experiences a sick swoop of fear at the sudden pressure, a memory rising unbidden to the top of his mind of Steven’s hands in the same place, choking him.
“You may have a rule about no sex during cases, but I follow no such rule.”
“What about the falling out with his son?”
He then attempted to swim bravely to shore with John in his arms.
to think about the curve of Sherlock’s long body tucking in behind his own, the way his hipbones might feel under John’s hands. He would
He hates himself for stopping this, for even raising the possibility of John leaving him, but the risk of John’s punishment if he is late now is too great and Sherlock cannot bear the thought of being responsible for John’s suffering.
They were in a residential neighborhood, the street on both sides lined with posh-looking apartment buildings.
Sherlock paid the cabbie and John slid out after him. They’d tied on their masks in the cab and if John had felt silly before, he felt absolutely ridiculous now—making his way up to a party on board a ship in a tux and a black mask; he felt like a character out of the pulp novels he’d read as a boy.
This time, John couldn’t hold back his cry.
“Sit down.” John took Sherlock by the upper arms and steered him towards a nearby crate. “And shut up about the bloody criminal.”
Anderson is missing as well; he’s not standing with the other midshipmen who are gathered by the capstan.
He’s starting to think this bag of John’s must have magical properties for all of the treasures it continues to produce. But of course, Sherlock knows that the real magic component is John himself.
“Yes, my love?”
John dips his head again to press a kiss to Sherlock's belly. “Being here with you is all I've wanted in the last four days. I could hardly think through the wanting.”
John stumbled as the memory gashed hot and painful through his mind. He fell against the doorframe, his forehead pressed against his arm. His cock was still throbbing, furious and neglected between his legs.
“What would you like? I’ll order us something.”
Terror wipes his mind blank. He can’t think. His body has gone cold. This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening. He doesn’t know what to do. What can he do?
“Finished the experiment, then?”
He doesn’t need to look; he remembers, too late, the trail of livid marks running from his jawline to his hip. The flash of accompanying memory—John’s mouth, hot and wet and biting—is like a sudden flare in a dark room. He knows, without having to look, that the marks are as red as freshly opened roses.
A feeling of awe, of wonder comes over him, such that Sherlock almost forgets his own arousal. He only wants to go on stroking John here until he’s crying out with pleasure, until his body is clenching around Sherlock’s fingers as he comes. Sherlock wants to know that feeling, he
John’s arms come up around him, wrapping warm around Sherlock’s back. “Oh, love.”
John leans in to meet him, sliding one hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock wastes only half a second of worry for the fact that John now seems to be blatantly ignoring the injuries on his hands in favor of touching him, before the thought dissolves in the presence of John’s soft mouth on his, John’s tongue slipping sweetly in past the seam of his lips.
Surely, if John had been found out, the commotion such a crime would arouse would have reached Sherlock by this point. Surely, the whole ship would be discussing it by now.
John pulled back and changed his grip, seizing Sherlock by the arse with both hands and maneuvering him backward toward the couch.
Anderson’s sullen silence is audible even from the other side of the crate.
“Sher—Sherlock…”
Sherlock glances up; distracted, wiping a trickle of sweat off his cheek with the hand still holding the paintbrush.
“No. This isn’t happening.”
“God… John.”
His senses still feel blown open by the music from earlier and every scent, every touch resonates through him at ten times its normal resonance.
He does not know now if he will ever get that chance again.
with want.
The sorrow in John’s voice as he sings the last line is so clear, so sharp, it’s like a blade at Sherlock’s throat. He can hear in that moment the echo of every time John has said those words to him.
Sherlock looks up and locks eyes with Lieutenant Deverall, who’s leaning against the far end of the table, looking as dashingly disheveled as one might expect an officer to look who’s finally cutting loose on shore leave. He’s clearly been drinking—there’s a slight slur to his words, and just the faintest tilt to his stance that suggests his balance is off, but other than that, irritatingly, he somehow looks more put together than the last time Sherlock saw him. Alcohol seems to agree with him. His dark curls look glossier, his brown eyes glowing in the dim light.
He almost considers telling her about Ms. Simpson—he has a feeling it would make her laugh. But as soon as he thinks it he catches himself.
sharp eyes, full mouth agleam, dark curls
Sherlock shuts his eyes briefly, whispers a silent thank you to whoever might be listening for letting John survive.
, he commanded himself.
“There is nothing to forgive,” he says, and he hopes that there is enough conviction in his tone that John will believe him.
. Just listen.”
As his eyes begin to register the shapes around him, Sherlock sees a group of sailors sitting and playing cards at a table halfway down on the starboard side of the ship—and another group, closer to him, talking and drinking on the larboard side. He recognizes some of the sailors but none of them are part of John’s mess.
“Let’s get up top before they drink all the rum without us!”
He takes John’s hands in his, holds onto them like a lifeline, thumb stroking the inside of John’s wrist, willing the erratic pulse to slow.
And then John’s shoulder is bumping companionably against his, his arm threading through Sherlock’s to draw him near.
“Don’t test me, boy.”
“Well,” Sherlock fluttered a disinterested hand. “I knew you had to feel … especially pressed. Besides, I saw how you looked at me this morning after I got dressed.”
Sherlock’s heart performs a complicated lurching motion in his chest.
It seemed a shame that such opulent surroundings should go to waste. Especially that bed. Sherlock hardly slept in it most nights and John was usually so exhausted by the time he crawled into it that he was asleep before his head touched the pillow. But there were
“Was that the first time you ever… thought about me like that?”
John didn’t know what had come over him, why he was suddenly revealing to Sherlock all the messy and intimate details of his failed relationship. Part of it was the wine, but part of it was also the fact that Sherlock was
“Bit difficult to take the pulse of a patient who won’t sit still.”
“Good. I can tell. You know what else we can do to work on your arm strength?”
John leans closer, but he’s still miles away—the shadows that separate him from Sherlock lengthening by the second. "If I had the chance to do it all again, to go back and drag you off that bloody rooftop, I would. I'd do it in a heartbeat. And if it meant never meeting Mary... I wouldn't look back.” The incision of John’s whisper is as fine as a scalpel, slicing its way into Sherlock’s heart. “I'd have no regrets."
It’s always crowded in Sherlock’s narrow bed. There’s scarcely enough room for them to lie side by side. Of course, Sherlock doesn’t mind—even if it’s hot and sticky in the candlelit dark, the air in his cabin warm and close—it’s still John pressed against him, which makes even the discomfort pleasant, he gamely tells himself.
He tries not to think too hard about how he’s also washing off the unwelcome touch of Steven’s hands on his shoulders—around his throat—and finds himself wishing for one impossible moment that he could somehow scrub away the faint bruises that still linger on the skin of his neck so that he could erase every trace of the incident.
Without saying a word, he reaches out and grabs hold of John, pulling him into his arms.
It was too much.
“Well, look lively,” Anderson barks. He eyes John critically as he stands. “Seems to me you’re lagging behind these days, Watson.”
The combined sensation of Sherlock’s long finger penetrating him with the tight circle of Sherlock’s mouth around his cock was almost too much for him. John couldn’t keep his hips still any longer—they thrust up, encouraging Sherlock’s finger to push deeper, for his mouth to sink lower around John’s cock.
John makes it sound as though it was easy to arrange but knowing the captain of this ship, Sherlock suspects there is more to the story.
But as soon as she’s gone, closing the door carefully after her, leaving behind the lingering scent of dried lavender, Sherlock finds himself wishing he’d stopped her from going.
“I come from a little village outside London. My father was a farmer but he was committed to his children having a better life. We helped him in the fields during the day but he taught us to read and write nights. I was going to learn a skill, he said, so when I was fifteen, I moved to London and was apprenticed to a surgeon in Fleet Street. I was old for an apprentice but the surgeon took me on anyway because he needed the help. I was saving up to marry a girl from my village—Mary was her name. She was going to wait for me. Said she didn’t mind waiting.”
and I just couldn’t get the image out of my head.
Sherlock made a disapproving noise above him, settling his chin against John’s hair, but when John twisted his head up to find Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock acquiesced, his lips tender and kiss-swollen, he felt the corners of Sherlock’s mouth tick upwards in smile.
Sherlock wonders what John is doing now—will he go straight to bed? Only to lie alone in his hammock and think of Sherlock? His eyes on the swinging shadows, trying to drive out the sound of stamping feet from overhead and concentrate on the memory of Sherlock’s skin under his hands, Sherlock’s body bending over him...
The fact that that knowledge still stings only makes Sherlock angrier yet.
He and Sherlock were back on the ship, on the observation deck just above the line of the flames, but this time, no helicopters came to their rescue. There were no police boats waiting down in the water, no Met officers with life jackets and fire blankets at the ready, it was just John and Sherlock staring at each other through the flames.
Sherlock’s fingers are crawling up the notches in John’s spine, each one a reassurance to his terrified brain that John’s presence is not merely a piece of his imagination come to life.
A thousand anxieties swell to the surface of Sherlock’s mind, quenching his desire as effectively as water to a flame. What if John finds his ignorance, his lack of experience childish, unappealing? What if John decides Sherlock is hideous without his clothes on? What if Sherlock does something to offend him? What if John finds him foolish, awkward, clumsy?
Lestrade nods once, deeply. “You have my word.”
John’s eyes had now fully adjusted to the dim light beneath the desk and he saw that the collar of Sherlock’s shirt was open. The groove between his collarbones was shining with sweat. John felt his mouth watering as he imagined licking it off.
John is there, sitting in the gold-flecked shadows, patting the ground beside him, motioning for Sherlock to come and sit.
Sherlock nods, his throat still tight with misery.
Sherlock frowned against him, the corners of his lips twitching down with distaste. “Really, John. In future, please spare me all instances of poetic fancy.”
He does not open his eyes as he knows the saltwater will sting, but he reaches out to find the line of John’s shoulder by touch and then slides his hand up the curve of John’s neck until his fingers are cupping John’s jaw.
Allllllll the fucking fluff. All of it. Fluff to make up for all the pain you went through with them and then some, enough fluff to keep you happy until the end of time. With a generous helping of angst thrown in too, of course. But beware of the fluff. It might actually kill you. I myself almost destroyed half the furniture in my house while writing it, I was so unable to handle it. You have been warned.
“Well, there’s been a change,” snaps Anderson. “I’ve just had a conversation with the Captain, and he has put me in charge of your mess. Any complaints you might have about this decision may be given directly to the Captain.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, edging John closer against him by the grip on his arms until John’s thigh is nudging in between his own. “We can use my cabin. It’s more private than anywhere else.”
“I can still hear you, you know,” Sherlock said but his eyes were closed. His forehead was drenched in sweat. John could feel his grip around John’s neck weakening.
John shook his head as he poured antiseptic onto a swab of clean cotton.
He cannot stop himself now—the soap, the water, his own overly active imagination, they have all joined forces to conspire against him, and he finds he is absolutely powerless to resist.
He stops again. He can’t do this.
“Will you… kiss me again? On the mouth?”
Worse than the scenes of physical pain though were the moments when Moriarty appeared to influence his interactions with Sherlock. He dreamed he was back in Baker Street, and he and Sherlock were talking in the kitchen, Sherlock’s worried face hovering in the steam from the mugs of tea between them, leaning forward to take John’s hand in his. John pulled his hand away but Sherlock reached for it. As soon as Sherlock’s fingers curled against his, Moriarty was at his shoulder, bending low over John’s neck to issue a warning.
The demon that plagued him in the dark last night crouches over him again.
The sailors are obviously fond of him. They treat him like a favorite pet when they’re not asking him to help with other duties, rumpling his hair, teaching him how to smoke a pipe, but he’s still something of an outcast because of his age. The fact that Anderson would take advantage of this boy’s status at the very bottom of the pecking order is perhaps more despicable than anything else Sherlock has seen him do.
“Good.” John says, and then stands up. “We’ll start tomorrow. Go on and get a good night’s sleep.”
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest. “Well. Here I am. So what is it? What’s your magical remedy?”
Sherlock can see Lieutenant Lestrade standing in the center of the crowd, visibly clinging to his last thread of patience as he attempts to manage the situation.
“Yes—oh god…” John’s mouth is open and hot against his as Sherlock strokes the pair of them, hard and fast, the way he knows John likes it.
“I think…” he begins, careful with his next words. “I think it’s his way of thanking us.”
John scarcely heard him; he was too busy laughing, his torso convulsing with mirth.
He feels John press a kiss to his matted curls. “How are you, lovely?”
John could hear how much of an effort it was for Sherlock to speak. John felt Sherlock’s fingers clutch his hip in frustration.
He wants to keep playing, that warm bright energy inside of him has only increased as the afternoon has gone on, but the crowd has surged forward now to offer individual words of praise, pressing drinks into the hands of the musicians in thanks.
It was so little but he has had nothing for so long that to Sherlock now it’s like a feast of sensation and it takes him longer than usual to tuck each part of it so carefully away inside his mind.
. Anything Sherlock attempts now will only make matters worse.
His legs had slid off of Sherlock’s back. He could barely lift himself off the pillows so he was glad when he felt Sherlock hook his hands under his thighs and drag him closer, when he felt the slick head of Sherlock’s cock nudge in against the entrance to his body.
John wasn’t much for art museums but he did enjoy the portrait galleries—studying the faces of humans from centuries past, their images preserved in time by the painter’s brush, men and women who looked no different than the patrons strolling through the galleries. He found it fascinating. He’d had one afternoon at the beginning of the week when Sherlock was up to his ears in bank documents and John had been able to slip away. He’d set off for the part of the city where many of the finest museums were housed and chosen one at random.
Sherlock is relieved to see that there’s no anger in John’s face, only a slow smile pulling at the corners of his mouth, as if he can’t help but smiling just looking at Sherlock.
Billy nods solemnly as he tucks the letter deep into the corner of his jacket out of sight.
John keeps stroking Sherlock’s hair. There is no reason for him to do this. Sherlock hopes that he will never stop.
He wants to tell John that Ms. Simpson’s room is next door, that the hole leads to the space under her bed, so he’ll be alright as long as he hides under there, but the footsteps have come to a halt outside Sherlock’s door, and now there’s a sharp knock on the wood.
“I have no doubt you will.”
, all of the time!”
He knows exactly what he wants to do, what he wants to give to John, if he can.
John couldn’t stop himself from emitting a low chuckle. “You look like you got caught in a mini-sugar blizzard.”
That night, as Sherlock lies in bed, thinking back over his conversation with John, he is seized with the desire to compose.
yes, perfect—good.”
“Well, there was,” Sherlock replied, unconcerned, looking down at the pristine front of his jacket and flicking away an imaginary speck of dust before tugging it into place. “He was here hours ago.” Sherlock waved an impatient hand. “I never would have sat waiting for him to get out of a meeting when I could just go in and talk to him whenever I pleased. No, we have a meeting with him tomorrow.
in all my days have I ever met anyone as extraordinary as you.”
He still felt a faint flutter of guilt at the lack of attention he’d given Sherlock that morning. He intended to make up for it now.
“I’m yours.”
“Do you think there’s a connection between this guy being slaughtered like this and the fact that he was a butcher?” Lestrade was hanging back a few steps, a look of disgust plain on his face. John didn’t blame him. As far as crime scenes went, this one was particularly gruesome.
John felt sick at the realization. It was as bad as his nightmares: Sherlock offering himself up to John against his own will, whether by compulsion or simply because he felt he owed it to John for some reason or another—both possibilities made John feel equally queasy with guilt.
The man had a strong American accent. There was an almost humorous lilt to his voice, as if he was on the verge of mocking John but only just holding himself back.
“But that may change depending on what new information comes to light. Based on the speed with which he contracted symptoms, it is most likely that the Lieutenant imbibed whatever it was that made him ill sometime in the course of that evening. Did he eat or drink anything while the two of you were together?”
This tune is slower than the others, the tempo slightly different. It takes Sherlock a few seconds to realize that it’s a waltz.
Sherlock is so worn out from his exhaustive regimen of exercises that he almost does not go to dinner. His body is so sore that lifting himself off the bed seems an insurmountable feat and he’s half-tempted to simply fall asleep with his clothes on where he lies, splayed out on top of his dingy blankets, one arm dangling over the side of the mattress.
Then he lifts an arm to drape it over John’s hip and bangs his elbow hard against the wall.
“If you had known, you wouldn’t have done anything differently. He needed the paramedics, John. It couldn’t be helped. He’ll be alright.”
Sherlock pulled his mouth away but he dropped one arm down to loop possessively over John’s shoulders. “You’re a bastard and a liar.”
, he tells himself.
Sherlock shuts his open mouth; he doesn’t know what to say.
to spare him the continued misery of life trapped on this floating capsule of other humans and their hatred, their mocking judgment, their disdain.
But sense wins over in the end, and Sherlock reassures himself with the knowledge that the John of their future interactions will not want to touch and lick a Sherlock that is still encrusted with the remains of their last encounter. Just the thought of that future John, his hungry eyes eating up the sight of Sherlock’s smooth, clean skin, sets him to shivering, and for once, Sherlock is grateful for the lack of hot water. The bite of the cold water against his skin helps to dampen the flames of his rising arousal.
. I was a client of hers to begin with. But we got on so well, we became friends. Turns out we made better friends than lovers,” John says smiling.
Silence as the rusted cogs of John’s memory turned. “Yyee…ss.”
Sure enough, Sherlock’s head fell back, his fingers stuttering around John’s cock, losing his rhythm, but John didn’t care because just as he had hoped, Sherlock’s head tipped back and everything in John’s body came to a shuddering halt at the sight of that fierce blaze of sunlight beading in Sherlock’s matted curls.
He lies in the sticky silence for several minutes before he hears it, the sound of the ship’s bell, ringing out in the dawn.
John wanted to shut his eyes and let himself be swallowed up by it, to let the voice blot out all memories of himself so that he could live inside it, dark and warm and unknowing; but the bitter smell of burning plastic was suddenly stinging the inside of his nose.
more. However, he will have to do some serious strategizing to come up with some way to convince Knott to talk to him again. The man has clearly terrorized himself into a state of absolute silence.
John said to get himself
There is no practical reason for Sherlock to avoid the upper deck during daylight hours; John’s mess will not be on duty, which means that Sherlock will not be putting any of their lives at risk, but still he almost turns the invitation down.
Sherlock can hear the menacing drag of the captain’s bad leg as he draws closer to Anderson with malicious intent.
“I heard they had a falling out.”
With this promising thought in mind, Sherlock wastes no time shucking off his breeches, which are the only article of clothing he re-donned since he and John came up from the beach, and stepping, without ceremony, over the rim of the enormous copper tub and lowering himself down into the water.
“It was ever so nice playing cards with you this afternoon, Mr. Holmes.”
Lestrade offers to take her home and before she goes, Sherlock pulls her into a hug, kisses her cheek. “Thank you for everything, Molly Hooper. I’ll never forget what you did for me.”
Sherlock’s cheeks grow warm again, and then, to his surprise, he finds himself smiling into the pillow.
But he’s too curious to know what it will feel like to actually be inside of John, and now that he has the thought in his mind, now that he can almost imagine it, he knows he will never be satisfied until he’s felt it.
John’s voice is low and heavy. It seems to work on Sherlock like a spell. That, combined with the feel of his fingers, combing slowly through Sherlock’s hair, pulls Sherlock down into an almost trance-like state.
Sherlock is pulled from his reverie by the sound of singing. He recognizes the voice of the old sailor who led the first song at the party below decks, the one who has a remarkably sonorous voice in spite of his age.
Rage fills Sherlock then, a rage so hot and all-encompassing that for a moment he cannot see the deck before him.
Sherlock kissed the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock was suddenly treated to the memory of John, standing on top of the barrel they had been hiding behind (quite remarkably, in light of the fact that the ship had been heaving to and fro, the decks pummeled by waves and salt spray) and shouting at the top of his lungs, “WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOU LILY LIVERED COWARDS? DIDN’T ANYONE EVER TEACH YOU SEA DOGS HOW TO USE A CUTLASS?”
John cleared his throat, feeling suddenly, inexplicably self-conscious. “And… how was that?”
“What was missing?” Sherlock’s voice was low, meditative, and once again John found himself answering without hesitation.
“How much time do we have left?” he asks, mouth dry with sudden dread.
John takes his hand and pulls him to his feet.
John rounded the corner into the living room and stopped dead in his tracks when he caught sight of Sherlock. He had to shut his mouth to stop himself from gasping. Hardly surprising that Sherlock in a three-piece tailored suit transformed him into sex on legs, but the sight of it still literally took John’s breath away.
“Come on. This way.”
John licked and pushed, and licked and pushed, alternating the speed, the pressure of his movements to coax the flexing muscle into submission beneath his tongue.
“It’s the perfect place,” John continues, voice lowering with every word, as he leans in closer, his eyes on Sherlock’s mouth. “It’s completely secluded, hidden from sight. In the springtime, the air—it smells like heaven, the ground so soft with flowers. The sunlight coming in through the branches overhead covers everything in a patchwork of light, makes a dappled pattern that’s constantly shifting with the wind—god, what I wouldn’t give to see that play of light on your bare skin.”
He slid his fingers into John’s belt loops and dragged his hips closer.
However, his terror at the prospect of being left alone again with his own thoughts is so real that he finds he cannot bring himself to say no. He also doesn’t think he could live with himself if he refused Miss Hooper this one chance at real company in her aunt’s absence.
He loves music.
His own shame swelled around him, reverberating in his ears with every difficult step.
The mockery in his voice is unmistakable, as is the implication that Sherlock’s upbringing has made him foolish and weak, completely unprepared for a life at sea with all the various hardships it brings.
To Sherlock’s immense relief, the two sailors do not linger at the top of the stairs.
The melody is beautiful but sad, the voice singing it low and full of longing. It makes Sherlock's chest ache, fills him with an indefinable sorrow.
Sherlock looks at John across the room, his face, smiling and patient as ever and feels a bit of his boldness return.
“He didn’t have to tell me!” John gasped, furious. “Everything he said—I already knew. He just proved it to me.”
“There’s something else, isn’t there? What did you think would happen?”
“Perhaps you could enlighten me, John,” Sherlock said, his voice low and rough in his ear. "Tell me why I should ignore what your body is screaming at me every time I get close to you."
Whatever the reason, at Sherlock’s words, the forced calm in Ferguson’s demeanor flickers and then vanishes abruptly like a candle going out.
“Let’s have a little more light. After all, the whole reason I invited you here was to show you around.”
“Alright?”
He dreams of a white bird flying over the ocean, diving down over the cliffs along the coast not far from where he grew up, and Sherlock is following it from the shore, desperate to catch up with it. He runs along the shoreline, but he cannot get close enough. He is high above the water; if he slips, he will fall to certain death on the sharp rocks beneath him, pounded by the surf.
“Come on, Johnny Boy, you can tell me. I won’t tell a soul, I promise. How did you do it? Did you take my advice? Did you flash a little extra skin one morning on your way to the shower? Rub up against him in a tight corner? Or was it your damsel in distress act on the cruise ship? Was he so
“John, can you hear me?”
None of them had stayed long enough to see the coach leave the drive.
“I think I’ve had too much wine.” He struggled to lift himself off the couch but he felt a hand on his wrist, stopping him.
“In some ways, I think it started the first time I laid eyes on you in St. Bart’s. I didn’t realize it then, of course, not consciously, but I knew—I knew there was something about you.”
In the bright light of the setting sun, his eyes are a more vivid blue than Sherlock has ever seen. They look like crystal.
Sherlock is practically sobbing by the time John’s fingers start to move. He had great plans—he was going to touch John too, in so many places—push that jacket off his shoulders, put his mouth all over John’s chest, but all he can do is lean his head back against the cables, biting his lip hard to keep from making noise as John strokes him with the perfect tempo, his own breath hot and fast against Sherlock’s ear.
John is exhausted. However the thought of sleep terrifies him. His eyes have started to drift closed of their own accord but he doesn’t want to take the risk of falling asleep only to discover this was all a dream. The thought of lying alone in his dark bedroom, the curtains and the walls riddled with the memories of his nightmares—he cannot face it, not after everything that’s happened.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker upward to look at the bed over John’s shoulder and he moans again at the sight of it.
It was only now that he realized how he felt, that he began to notice how close he had drifted. This realization would have been jarring enough on its own but because the knowledge had come to him from Moriarty, something about John’s desire felt perverse. Somehow, his arousal was all tangled up in the whole nightmarish experience.
“Er…”
“Well, now that we’re thoroughly sticky… in more ways than one, I suppose it’s finally time we went for a swim. What do you say?”
He can see a cluster of ramshackle buildings up ahead that mark the beginnings of the town, toward which their small group is now heading, and where, he imagines the other members of the
There is something raw in his voice, a longing that resonates through every word, the depth of emotion in each note so present that Sherlock feels an ache in his chest at the sound. Sherlock is certain then that if anyone else were to sing this particular song, it wouldn’t be half so full of feeling. But listening to John sing it, the downturned corners of his sorrowful mouth as he sings the refrain, it hits Sherlock like a punch to the gut.
Sherlock looks at him, feeling fear, cold and irrational, begin to fill him.
This is the first time in his life he’s ever had more than one person he’s liked so much, so he’s never had the experience of getting to introduce them to one another. He finds the experience not altogether displeasing.
The press of bodies and the heat from the candles were starting to make John sweat in his suit. He fought the urge to tug at his collar; he wasn’t used to having so much starched fabric at his throat. He still felt painfully out of place in the elegantly dressed crowd—this was the world Sherlock and Mycroft had grown up in, not him.
Sherlock grabs her by the shoulders. “What is it? Tell me, Molly!”
The other man’s voice was cold and clipped. He spoke with a middle-class accent. Briggs.
“I don’t want to stay,” he says, shaking his head. “I want to leave—now—with you.”
“There, all done. You can squirm as much as you like now.”
“How long have you known each other?”
, to do anything that would help alleviate the tension pulsing hot and dark all through him.
Sherlock can feel the sound John makes in response all through the length of his cock but still, he resists the urge to lower himself fully down against John.
He stays there for several long moments, inhaling deeply.
“I know,” John whispered, kissing his thighs, feeling a rush of tenderness fill his chest at the sight of Sherlock so apparently helpless, lost to pleasure. “I know. I’m sorry.  Just wait one minute. I’m going to make you feel so good.”
John stood at Sherlock’s elbow as they watched the last of the vans headed to the shelter pull away from the warehouse.
“Soon you’ll be able to have real food again,” John tells him. “Well, as real as food gets on a vessel of Her Majesty’s Navy, which isn’t much more appealing than this, I’m sorry to say.”
The men guffaw again and Sherlock doesn’t care if he’s seen at this point, he cannot stand to listen to another word. He feels hot all over; his skin too tight—his ears are full of a buzzing sound. He makes to bolt for the ladder when he hears the sound of voices coming up from down below.
“Will there be officers?”
John’s voice would be moving enough on its own, but the accompaniment that he plays on the guitar adds a depth, a texture to the music that enriches what would otherwise be a simple melody. Set against John’s lovely voice, the march of the changing chords lends gravity to the words that he sings. In contrast to the quick sweet sound of the high notes there is something dark and inevitable in the deep reverberation of the low strings. Sherlock can feel them resonate in his chest.
Sherlock understands this perfectly. It is precisely how he has been feeling, torn open by his longing, terrified by the power of it, the immensity, afraid every moment that it will swallow him up completely; but to know now that John, too, is affected by the same feelings, to see evidence of it in the small, even letters of John’s neat hand—it makes Sherlock feel as though he’s falling and flying simultaneously.
But as he glances towards the center of the room where the dancers are moving over the floor he realizes that there are several pairs of men dancing together—and even one pair of women, their heads thrown back in laughter their arms tight round one another’s waists—and Sherlock realizes no one in this room would give them a second glance right now if they were to dance together, and even if they
He’s reassured by the sight of Molly’s smile out of the corner of his eye. He still isn’t good at… this. Talking about…
“John…”
The corresponding realization that he was naked, in a bathtub, with Sherlock Holmes, and all the intimacy that went along with that realization made John feel suddenly, completely overwhelmed. This was beyond his greatest fantasies. And what’s more—it apparently
“Watson,” John says, the magnitude of his smile increasing by several degrees as he puts out his hand and takes the gloved one offered to him by Miss Gibbons. “John Watson. And the pleasure is all mine, ma’am.”
John licks his lips, shifts up to his elbows, and Sherlock releases John’s hips to watch hungrily as John takes himself in hand.
“Hang on, Sherlock. We’re almost there.”
The captain is standing at the desk in the center of the room (the very desk, in fact, that Sherlock hid beneath yesterday when he returned the manifest), his attention focused on a series of maps and nautical charts spread out before him.
Sherlock shifted closer against him, pushing one leg insistently between John’s so that they were tangled together from toe to hip. “Of course I saw right through your base motives from the beginning but that doesn’t change the fact that you’re a lying bastard.”
Sherlock tries to get a look at the address on the envelope as the courier takes it from Billy’s hand but he cannot read the writing before the other man slips into the front of his coat.
“What do you want?”
Sherlock follows the man to the door of his cabin, where he instructs Sherlock to wait in the corridor while he ducks into his room to fetch the tobacco.
He thrust desperately up against Sherlock’s groin but this time, Sherlock lifted his hips away. He caught John’s bottom lip between his teeth, releasing his hold on John’s wrists to slide his hands down John’s sides and push his hips down against the mattress.
There was a sick, burning sensation in the pit of John’s stomach. Why did he feel ashamed? He had no reason to be ashamed.
for John to eat the pie.
“And we’ll—we’ll see what happens when we reach Rio, yeah?”
, Sherlock.”
“I’m going to go now. I can’t—we can’t—do anything.” John’s voice is brittle with frustration and disappointment. There’s another emotion too that at first Sherlock cannot identify because he’s so unused to hearing it in John’s voice. It’s self-hatred. “I can’t touch you, Sherlock, so it’s pointless.”
“With absolutely no concept of personal boundaries.”
Sherlock looks up to see John’s eyes falling closed, one hand coming up to grasp his own forehead.
“What is it?”
But before he can get too lost in his jealousy over John’s past lovers, John is sliding back in against him, covering Sherlock’s partially opened mouth with his own and slipping his tongue between Sherlock’s lips as he reaches to twine their fingers together again, effectively grounding Sherlock in the present moment.
“This is the friend I’ve told you about,” he says in a carrying voice. “My old school friend, Marcus.”
“And they wouldn’t let the guests on the lifeboats till they’d handed over their valuables?”
Sherlock sees that the sun is completely gone now—it has vanished into the glittering dark of the ocean and Sherlock is glad because the darkness means he can no longer see the pain on John's face, the way his broken hand clutches the handle of his horrible cane.
Lestrade came around and took Sherlock’s other arm. This time he didn’t protest. Between the two of them, they managed to get Sherlock out to the curb. Several hospital attendants passed them on their way with inquisitive looks but John’s expression stopped all of them from offering any kind of assistance.
It had occurred to Sherlock that for all the times John told him how fantastic he was, he rarely did the same for John.
Sherlock knows full well that he has been dismissed, but he was prepared for this. He knew the captain would have no interest in granting him his demand, not without something else to interest him in exchange.
When he hears the sound of bells ringing as clear and sweet as sunlight, he tries to sit up but finds he cannot wake himself.
“Bathing with you in the blue-green ocean, kissing you in the surf…”
John looked at Sherlock through his lashes, his voice much less steady than he’d anticipated. “Happy now?”
“No time!”
Lucky for him, John was thoughtful enough to fill Sherlock’s pitcher with fresh water before he left. Sherlock fills one cup to the brim, drinks it greedily down, and then instantly fills another.
“It was nothing. I simply thought of how I would feel in your position if John and I were—”
His fingers slide into place against the clasps with practiced ease and he doesn’t even realize he is holding his breath until he pushes the case open and sees the violin tucked in its familiar bed of worn blue velvet, and all his breath leaves him in a sigh.
Third, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He places his hands on John’s breastbone, positions himself over his hands, compresses his chest in quick succession, thirty times; checks for breath.
“No, before that. Before the part about me wanting you.”
John steps closer, reaching forward to hold Sherlock gently by the hips, the smile blooming fully on his mouth as he pulls Sherlock in against him.
“John—”
“Mycroft was of course no comfort to her either. He’s even more unlovable than I am, if you can imagine it.”
“They’ve probably moved inside the walls.”
“What I don’t understand is how anyone could bring themselves to exert the energy it would take to murder someone in this weather,” Lestrade said, pressing a soaked handkerchief to his brow.
He reaches around with his other hand to grip John’s arse, kneading the muscle there, pushing his own body closer in against John’s so that he brushes his own stomach with his knuckles while he strokes.
His arm is trembling where it’s planted on the mattress by John’s hip. It’s unbelievably hot in the tiny room and Sherlock’s hairline is soaked with sweat—he can feel a drop of it now, creeping down his neck.
Sherlock expects much more resistance to this part of the plan than Molly gives evidence of. It’s a testament to just how desperate she must be that she seems to have hardly any qualms at all about drugging her chaperone. Just in case any latent conscience asserts itself later on, Sherlock reassures her that the effects of the potion are harmless. It will only make her sleep longer than usual.
“Good!” Sherlock can hear the sunny approval in John’s voice behind him without even turning to look. “That’s good.”
He watches the complicated business of the crew unloading the ship with fascination, watches as they remove the gratings, the men down in the hold lashing the enormous casks with rope and maneuvering them up through the decks with giant winches and pulleys that swing out over the sea to deposit them in the waiting boats.
Sherlock lay back. He looked irritated but it was clear he was getting exhausted. He shut his eyes. “I hope this isn’t how you treat all your patients. You have a terrible bedside manner.”
Sherlock turns, stricken, at the sound of alarm in John’s voice.
This emission prompts Sherlock to open his mouth—finally—and swirl his tongue liberally over the head of John’s cock, feeling his own arousal bloom within him at the taste of John, the slippery wet heat of the fluid leaking from the tip.
Any activity that results in a kiss from John Watson is not one Sherlock is going to expend energy protesting.
Sherlock released his grip on John’s hands, and within seconds, John’s fingers were reaching between them and tugging down the zip on Sherlock’s fly.
"Oh, my own, my beautiful boy—my pearl."
However, it has the unfortunate side effect of quadrupling the other man’s already manic rage.
“It isn’t…” Deverall clear his throat, looking only marginally less uncomfortable than Dimmock. “There are rules against crew members ah… fraternizing with passengers, you see.”
“Thank God for you, Billy. I don’t know how I can thank you for what you’re doing.”
The kiss is long and deep and Sherlock feels something in him flutter happily at the knowledge that maybe he does have the ability to make John feel as good as John makes him feel.
He was still shivering in the grips of his own orgasm as Sherlock came apart around him, above him, within him, and the feel of it somehow impossibly pulled more pleasure from his own body. He pulled Sherlock fully down against him as they shuddered through the final shocks, pressing his sticky hips to Sherlock’s stomach, feeling the sweat between their bodies, the hot smear of his come.
Sherlock feels a flutter of excitement move through him at John’s words.
Sherlock is so taken aback by this open display of good will that he does not think of a response until the man has left the room. Perhaps, Sherlock thinks, blinking at his retreating back, perhaps he has been too quick to assume that everyone on the ship despises him; perhaps he hasn’t been paying quite enough attention.
And then Sherlock bit down, hard, on the skin of his palm. John yelled and tried to snatch his hand back but Sherlock hung on, sinking his canines in until he drew blood.
John’s lips are skimming now along his hairline, his palm making a slow journey back up Sherlock’s thigh towards his hip.
The bar maid has finally finished with the group of drunken sailors and comes over to take John’s order.
Sherlock exchanges a panicked look with Molly.
But perhaps it was better to stick with something more plausible.
“Shh.” Sherlock slid forward, until he was occupying the space between John’s parted thighs, and then to John’s surprise, reached for the sponge by John’s elbow. “You said you wanted to get cleaned up, didn’t you? Let me help you.”
“Take my hand.”
Then again, he knew exactly what had come over him—it was relief.
He might actually be whimpering, and he must look the worse for it because suddenly, John is rushing forward, his cool hands on Sherlock’s arms, guiding him to a packing crate nearby to sit, dropping into a crouch in front of him, his blue eyes bright with concern.
Old Leroy grins up at Sherlock. “Of course! Pull up a chair, laddie. Or stand if you like, whatever pleases you.”
Sherlock sits up straighter on the bench. “You’ve seen John?”
He’s about to approach the group of working sailors to ask them about John’s whereabouts but before he takes a step forward he remembers John’s explanation from last night for how he came by the cut on his face.
He can feel arriving on the heels of his abating terror, a rush of aching loneliness, of purposelessness, now that John has gone.
“But then when I saw how eager you were to play, how eager the others were to hear you… I realized that would be selfish.”
Sherlock nods again, still fighting the hard knot of fear in his throat that makes it difficult to talk.
.” John reared up against Sherlock and seized his mouth. He kissed him slow and deep, with all the promise of what he wanted to do to him. Sherlock moaned into the kiss. “Yes, Sherlock. I can do more than that if you like. Anything you want. Anything.”
John drops himself down on the deck and reaches into his waistcoat to pull out a small canteen.
Why on earth had he assumed that this is what Ferguson had intended to do with the manifest?
He leaves the table before the meal is over, with a quick sympathetic glance to Molly as he passes her by. He cannot bear another minute of the boisterous eager conversation about what delights await in Rio, and how each passenger plans to spend their time.
He pressed his forehead to John’s, breathing hard, his eyes huge in the darkness.
Moran backhands him across the cheek. “Your defiance is touching. Sadly, I don’t have time for this.” He straightens up. “No matter. You’ve made my decision that much easier.”
“It’s all right,” he murmured into Sherlock’s hair. “You’re all right.”
Sherlock hates to leave him, but he knows nothing about poisoning other than that every second he hesitates this man’s life might be slipping away.
lean suggestion of a shoulder, and then,
It’s clear to Sherlock now that the presence of his mouth here should feel good to John—but what Sherlock cannot understand is how the feel of John’s hot, soft skin against his lips and tongue should feel so good to
“Alright love, it’s time to come for me now.”
you?"
John tugged on his waistcoat, felt his cheeks heat slightly at the unwavering force of Sherlock’s gaze.
“Oh, so, eating food like a NORMAL PERSON doesn’t count as necessary but making POISONED PIES DOES?”
“Do you know…?” John says, crawling toward Sherlock on his hands and knees, his smile shifting imperceptibly the closer he gets, glimmering at the corners with something dangerous, something full of hunger. “I also couldn’t stop thinking about you all day. No matter what task was before me it seemed to disappear as I found myself thinking of your hands, the sounds you made… your mouth.”
Sherlock sits back on his heels and spares another moment to look up at John, who’s looking down at him, breathing hard, his eyes heavy-lidded, the color high in his cheeks, his cock standing out from his lean, muscled torso like an invitation to Sherlock.
John was so aroused his hands were shaking. He clenched them tighter against Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Sherlock…”
“Oh, Sherlock.” To his surprise, John’s voice, when he speaks, is full of sorrow. “You beautiful, brilliant, foolish thing.”
“Oh, and Sherlock? One more thing.”
“I was at sea for three years, fighting against the French. I was on board the
John fights hard against the disappointment that emerges as a result of this and fails. After all, they are only dreams, arguably no less disturbing than his reoccurring nightmare. But that’s just it. They are nothing like his nightmare. There’s something about them, some quality John can’t put his finger on—the only way he can describe it to himself is that they
Sherlock keeps on talking, suddenly eloquent with anger.
It’s a good thing Anderson was already so deranged with fury—otherwise Sherlock’s obvious ploy to distract him would not have worked. Even if provoking Anderson in his current violent state was maybe not the best idea Sherlock’s ever come up with, at least it was effective.
He is the best man for the job, Sherlock knows, now picturing the smiling sailor without any teeth who sang John’s praises when he tarred the ropes.
“I saw you up there, on the yardarm!” Sherlock bursts out. “Walking along without holding onto anything. You were—” Sherlock struggles to find a word to convey how John looked—how to express the grace, the power of his body, the amazement Sherlock felt just seeing him up there, like a part of the sky. “It’s like you were born to walk those ropes.”
“Wait—wait a moment,” he murmurs, breathless, tilting dramatically to one side so he can set the thing on the ground, hating that the movement pulls him away from John’s mouth for even a second. “Just let me…There, god—there.”
“Don’t wind up your fist. That lowers the power of your punch and it’ll make you lose your balance. You’ve got to conserve your energy. Keep your movements small and tight. Like this.” John demonstrates again, his jab fierce and quick. Sherlock’s eyes follow the movement with something like hunger. “Try again.”
In contrast to the warm, loose pliancy of his own body, pressed up against John, Sherlock is suddenly aware of the tension present in John’s. There is a tremor running through him, as fine as a ripple of wind across the surface of still water, and Sherlock sits up a little higher on his elbows, feeling determined. He wants to give back to John what John has just given him so selflessly.
“John,” Sherlock slides forward on the bed, taking John’s hands in his. He feels prompted to action by John’s sudden helplessness. “Look, it’s fine—we’ll be quiet. We can do better, we can—”
Henrietta Long, a blonde-haired, buxom young woman who is only too fond of displaying her myriad charms, leans forward with undisguised eagerness. “Oh, do you really think so, Mr. Jackson? A party? On this ship?”
“Come with us,” they sing in their lovely heavy voices.
Was it you or was it me
Sherlock did not break Anderson’s rule. But would that matter to Anderson if he heard that Sherlock had been found down on the gun deck presumably looking for John?
John watched him as he swallowed, his eyes tracing the tendons in Sherlock’s long throat.
John lunged for Sherlock’s dresser, yanking open the top left drawer and pulling out the bottle of lube. His hands when he went to flip the cap were shaking.
He will make it up to John, he thinks fiercely. As soon as John is here, he will show John just how much he missed him.
He pulled his fingers out of Sherlock’s grasp, his hand reaching out to push Sherlock away, but faltering as soon as his fingers closed around Sherlock’s bicep because Sherlock had tossed the gun aside and his free hand was now sliding down between them, his long, dexterous fingers spreading out over the bulge in John’s trousers and Sherlock was
Sherlock knows he should head straight below so as to avoid calling any further attention to himself—especially since his goal right now, above all else, is to keep a low profile, to ensure that he will be able to leave the ship tomorrow morning on the first boat bound for shore.
John’s heart was hammering in his chest. In his panic, he’d grasped the sides of the tub with his burned hands, and was now wincing at the result. The pain made him irritable and he didn’t bother to conceal the irritation in his voice.
, he tries to tell himself.
“I’m not teasing you. I really mean it. I’ve seen you watching me work. And I know that look, like your skull might crack if someone doesn’t give you something to keep your hands busy with. I can show you if you like, help you keep yourself occupied.”
Lestrade was chewing gum. Spearmint. As soon as John smelled it, he knew he was going to be sick. “Sorry,” he gasped and then bolted from the room.
“Oh, and one more thing, Lieutenant.”
John could still taste Sherlock on his lips. He wanted so badly to grab Sherlock and push him to the ground and finish the kiss, but instead he climbed to his feet. “I refuse to be your experiment!”
He spends the rest of the morning safely out of sight in his newfound hiding place under the foremast at the prow of the ship.
John grins at Sherlock, the white of his teeth a flare of brightness in the dark.
“I’m going to have a smoke. Care to join me?”
Dark waves, bright sky.
John drops his hold on Sherlock’s arm to reach out and scrub a hand through Patterson’s hair in a gesture of rough old brother affection.
The vulnerable part of him, the part that was connected to Sherlock now, that had glowed like a white light beneath his breastbone during the events of the last twenty-four hours, had gone dark. He had to shut it off, shut it down, in order to go through with this. He couldn’t acknowledge that what they were about to do could signal the end of everything that had only just begun between them. There was no point. If they ignored this trap, Moriarty would simply create another more impelling, more insidious scenario to ensnare them. They had to do this. He had to face this.
“—should have known you would go behind my back. I made you an offer that you
John did
Once again, he finds himself utterly incapable of movement.
“Did you talk to the captain? What did you tell him?”
But somehow he finds he cannot manage it. And even if he could, he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want to be reasonable. He doesn’t want John to do the right thing, the nobler thing, and give up his chance of seeing Sherlock.
“I felt…” John paused and shook his head, as if he could shake away the memories. “He got inside my head—just like you said. He made me doubt that you could ever want me. But it started with my own self-doubt. He must have seen it in me, and known he could exploit it to destroy me from the inside out.”
He’s trying to work out exactly what to say when John opens his eyes.
When John finally breaks the kiss, he leans his forehead against Sherlock’s cheek, and closes his eyes, his breathing rapid. His hands are trembling where they lay, palms upward, against Sherlock’s chest.
“You’re the perfect pet because you’re
John’s head drops back sharply with a cry even as his hips buck up as if their own accord, and with this gesture, Sherlock feels his self-restraint collapse.
, John wasn’t wrong when he described the feeling of this—the motion of his fingers is so smooth that it’s all Sherlock can do not to just keep touching himself until he finds release. If he always had something like this when he touched himself… my god.
“I can’t stay, John, but remember what I said. Remember.”
Sherlock can hear John trying to keep himself together, to keep that calm, cold mask in place, and he does not understand. Why is he doing this? What is he trying to hide?
Sherlock groans at the thought.
“I can’t lie.” Sherlock watches John lick his lips, his pale pink tongue shining in the low light. “The thought of being the one to make you come apart, the first one to touch all the secret places in you that you don’t even know yourself,” Sherlock can hear John’s breathing growing less and less steady as he goes on speaking; the thumb at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth stroking gently over Sherlock’s bottom lip. “It’s kept me up most nights.”
Sherlock has seen the boy around the ship. He’s a green hand, which means he’s responsible for all the jobs no one else wants to do—slushing masts, sweeping and clearing up decks, assisting the seamen in their duties and running errands for the officers. He’s the youngest person on the ship, but he works harder than anyone. Every time Sherlock sees him, when he’s not up in the rigging with the sailors, he is running somewhere with his arms full.
When John is there, everything is different.
Sherlock made a muffled noise into the pillow.
Sherlock heads to the gangway at the center of the ship that leads down directly to the sailors’ quarters on the upper gun deck.
Sherlock sucks harder in response, hips pumping into John, his mind flooded with thoughts of the way John’s mouth felt around his cock the day before. He imagines suddenly what it would feel like to have his mouth not around John’s fingers, but his cock—the hard, silky heat of it against his tongue, his lips stretching wide to take it into his mouth. What would it feel like on his tongue? Would he be able to fit it all? What would it taste like?
Sherlock swallowed down another inch of him—so slow, so wet—providing just the right amount of suction and John quivered under his mouth, felt the low curl of arousal in his belly building force.
And then, at the end of yet another long corridor, he finally hears the sounds of people—two people, to be precise, talking in low voices, murmuring to one another.
He has eyes only for Molly, whose hopes have clearly not been renewed by the good news. She picks at her food, her head bent in quiet defeat above her plate, responding to Grimsby’s few attempts at conversation in dull monosyllables.
At the last sharp jab of his hips, he felt Sherlock tense beneath him, and he reached forward to take hold of Sherlock’s cock as he came, to feel the hot spurts of Sherlock’s come pulsing through his fingers. He hadn’t even touched Sherlock’s cock the whole time he’d fucked him and Sherlock had managed to come just from being penetrated. John was impressed.
He interrupts his own words with a moan as he returns his fingers to his cock, and Sherlock lowers his arse back down to John’s thighs to watch.
True to Matthews’ word, the space is deserted, the hammocks all neatly stowed between the low-hanging beams above their heads, leaving John and Sherlock alone in the patchwork darkness. Sherlock has not been down here since the night of Lestrade’s poisoning, when he came down in such a hurry to fetch John’s surgeon kit, and the space, in the daytime looks completely different.
“I’ll be back, all right?”
But more than any of that, what struck John was that the expression on his face was still full of that soft, open look; that look that John realized—with a sudden pang of feeling—was only for him.
John turns and sees Sherlock standing in the threshold, one hand on the doorknob, looking oddly indecisive.
“Nope. Not until you tell me what’s actually wrong.”
Sherlock subsist on when John was away? Mold fumes?), but after several minutes of expletive-laden investigation John managed to find a bag of bread that he had bought before he went away with a few, only-mildly mildewed slices left.
He let go of his hair, his voice suddenly vicious. “A man like that deserves worse than death.”
he can do almost as well as John fills him with a confidence that he rarely gets to experience in John’s presence, and he finds himself filled with a newfound appreciation for all those hours Mycroft spent up to his knees in filthy pondwater coaching Sherlock how to breathe out of one side of his mouth. He’s never been more grateful for the knowledge than he is now in this new context—in these warm tropical waters with John at his side.
He steps back in against John, reaching up with his arms to loop them around John’s neck. He pitches his voice low, as low as he can, and into it he pours every fragment of desire that has been burning through him since the very first time he laid eyes on John.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered. “That was—” He cleared his throat nervously, and turned away. “Completely inappropriate to voice at a time like this.”
And now it’s clearer to Sherlock than ever that whatever the particulars are of Ferguson’s meddling in Knott’s business, his motivations are clearly financial.
Sherlock has no proof of it, but he is sure, as sure as he is of his own bones under his skin, that somehow the captain is responsible.
His mind keeps circling endlessly back to his interaction with John from this afternoon, the way the weariness in him seemed to have blotted out the light, as though the darkness in his face was welling up from somewhere deep inside of him.
of nightmares. What was it like, nightmare-free sleep? He honestly couldn’t remember.
He lets Molly change in his room. He waits outside in the corridor while she does, pacing, worrying at the too long piece of hair on his forehead, trying to keep his mind off of tomorrow morning, but it’s becoming more and more difficult.
John looks down for a moment, and then lifts his head and begins to sing.
John rubbed a reassuring hand over Sherlock’s shoulder. He lifted his head slightly off of Sherlock’s throat to answer, his voice slurring with sleepiness. “For making you come?”
“So do you believe the rumors?” Colonel Jackson leans in conspiratorially before asking in a stagey whisper, “You think the man himself is actually going to make an appearance?”
“I had another dream,” he breathed, “It was even better than the first one. You had vines instead of arms. You were a… oh, god!” He cried out as Sherlock’s tongue pushed between the flesh of his buttocks. He was panting now, shameless. “You were a flower and you were feeding off me… just—just like this.”
This question freezes Sherlock where he stands, one hand on the back of his chair to push it in.
Or it was, until Lestrade texted Sherlock to report that the gang of smugglers they’d been monitoring for the past six months were back in London, and their ship was ready to leave the port.
“Would you like me to relay these concerns to the captain?”
Sherlock reaches to remove an invisible speck of dust from his sleeve with a bored expression. “Tell him I have some information that I think will be of interest to him.”
“John—”
There must be
Sherlock leaned into his touch with a soft sound like a sigh.
Sherlock is touched by the man’s genuine expression of concern and startled all over again that the Lieutenant considers him worth speaking to, much less congratulating him on surviving a deadly illness.
John’s self-defense instincts kicked in. He was prepared to elbow his assailant in the kidneys with deathly force when a hand clamped over his mouth and Sherlock’s voice in his ear hissed, “It’s alright. It’s me. I doubled-back so I could surprise him. He’s coming this way. Don’t make a sound.”
“I am sorry about this,” he says, and then spits generously onto his fingers, smearing it over the tar under her eye.
“We’re like the walking wounded.”
Reaching a hand up to the back of Sherlock’s neck, he dragged Sherlock’s mouth down against his and kissed him with an ache in his chest that was only made better when Sherlock’s lips parted and his tongue came out to meet John’s, warm and slick and deliciously wet.
“Here, yes.”
“Still quite an uncanny resemblance.” John pulled his mouth off slowly, licking at the pads of Sherlock’s fingers. “Should I be worried?” John breathed as Sherlock started sinking backwards down against the pillows, pulling John with him by the grip on his hands.
John regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth. He heard the rushed and desperate quality in his voice when he said the word ‘kiss’ and hated himself for how stupid he sounded; like an infatuated teenager stumbling around his first crush, stammering and blushing.
“Did I do it wrong?” Sherlock’s voice is smaller than a speck of dust.
“So what was this one like in school?” he says, lifting his pint in Sherlock’s direction.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, rubbing his hands down John’s bare sides and then back up to brush his nipples again. “Yes, yes yes.”
“Especially not John Watson,” the man adds with a low chuckle. “If ever there was a risk-taker—and I’ve known many in my day—he goes by the name of John Watson. Never known that man to say no to a bet. The trick of course is getting back on board without arousing the attention of the sharks.”
Whatever it means, they have time now to figure it out—they have all the time in the world—and John plans to use it and use it well.
“It didn’t work. He went right back to Baker Street and he’s clearly not going to leave. Why is he being so
For the second time that day he is caught like a rabbit in the presence of the hounds.
“That was incredibly fucking brave what you did.”
John makes a little sighing sound against Sherlock’s lips, the corners of his mouth turned down in an expression of mock sorrow. “I know… to tell you the truth, I’m not sure how I will manage.”
“I told him I had information that would interest him, that I would give it to him in exchange for removing Anderson from his position.”
He is startled by the feel of a rough palm gripping his shoulder; Sherlock looks up in surprise.
Sherlock kissed the corner of his mouth, smiling against him. “Greedy.”
’s midshipmen sit with Deverall and Dimmock. He tells himself it’s because he doesn’t want a run in with Hopkins, but again, if he’s honest with himself, he must admit it’s because he doesn’t want to have to look at Deverall’s stupidly handsome face any closer than is strictly necessary.
They’ve reached the upper deck and Sherlock heads straight for the railing by the capstan. He leans against it with some relief.
The ringtone on John’s phone shatters the silence—stark and familiar all at once. He’s never changed it in all the years Sherlock’s been away.
He hears John make a low sound of pleasure in response, somewhere in the back of his throat, and Sherlock feels a flare of heat burst into life between his legs at that sound. He slides his hands back down John’s arms until he’s caught hold of both of his hands and then surges forward, pushing his tongue into John’s mouth.
Sherlock must have sensed John’s disquiet. John heard Sherlock shift in his chair, lean forward across the table. He started speaking, his voiced filled with hesitation.
Sherlock knelt beside him on the blanket, his eyes wide, his own arousal evident in the prominent bulge pushing up through the material of his pajama bottoms.
“I’m sorry. I want to, Sherlock—but we can’t. We just can’t.”
Ferguson wastes no time with pleasantries.
“Fuck, John. Yes!”
Sherlock’s voice was ragged.
Miss Hooper smiles at him forgivingly, but her eyes are tight. “You misjudge the virtues of my sex, Mr. Holmes. We are considered rather…wanting in certain qualities if we cannot find a husband by my age.”
Sherlock yanks his breeches up his thighs, his shaking fingers fumbling with the ties.
“Don’t you dare.” Something is happening to John’s face as he says it, as he takes in Sherlock’s utter revulsion at the tiny vase of purple flowers. It’s a strange sensation and he realizes he’s smiling. Grinning so widely his face actually hurts.
The shock of the cool air on his bared skin made John’s breath catch but the sensation only emphasized the stark contrast between that and the pliant heat of Sherlock’s fingers as they brushed against his nude thighs, only intensified the forbidden nature of what they were about to do. John felt his erection twitch to life under the lapels of his coat that Sherlock hadn’t bothered to remove.
“Sher… Sherlock…
Sherlock wriggles his hips against it and feels John stiffen in response, breath catching.
“John—”
“And nobody’s buying…” Sherlock murmured, stepping back and looking up as he did so, up to the tops of the very tall windows where a haze of grey light was filtering through. “Who found them?”
Sherlock threw himself down on the living room sofa and started flipping through a magazine at break-neck speed, not even bothering to look down at the pages.
John opens his mouth to protest but before he can speak Anderson has whirled around to face him. “I would advise that you think very carefully about your choice of words before speaking to me,
“I’m glad,” John says and Sherlock feels John lean a little closer still.
A strange question for John to be asking, Sherlock thinks distantly. It’s so nice lying here, why does John need to ask him questions? There’s no need to talk just now.
When Sherlock reaches his cabin, he wastes no time digging through his trunk and pulling out his deep green tail coat, his velvet knee breeches, a fresh pair of stockings, and a clean shirt. The waistcoat he chooses has slender golden stripes stretched horizontally across the breast, and a row of golden buttons that gleam when they catch the light. The neck cloth he selects is a creamy ivory.
As far as Sherlock can determine, his brother’s letter reads as follows:
below his narrow hips, and
“About time, I dare say! Those musicians would have had a hard time rousing me from sleep the way they were playing. Let’s hope they improve now that they have a concrete objective.”
“So good to see you get some time on shore. It seems I never see you when you’re not standing over that sweating monster of a stove.”
He lights only the candle on Sherlock’s desk, the movements of his hands, even while bandaged, so practiced and precise, and Sherlock thinks he could watch John do anything, anything at all, and it would look like art.
He tips Sherlock’s face down towards his and when their mouths meet at last, Sherlock feels relief pour through him like summer rain after a long drought.
John turns, and seeing Sherlock he freezes. Sherlock can see John trying to will himself to calm down.
“Well,” Lestrade says again, and there is a long uncomfortable pause before Lestrade rises to his feet.
John pulled back and then ground forward with his hips, watching Sherlock’s shoulders flex in response. Sherlock made a sound like he’d been punched.
“Yes, thank you, Billy.”
know her—or at least, he did once, it seems, quite intimately.
John grins back at him, for real this time, the worry sponged away in the blink of an eye, until he’s beaming at Sherlock, reaching over to grab him by the shoulder. “Welcome to a party with the other half of the ship.”
Sherlock feels suddenly uncertain what to do with his hands. He tugs at his waistcoat.
“Hold on. Hold on. It isn’t far now.”
“John…” Sherlock’s voice was urgent. John felt it before he heard it, Sherlock’s breath hot on his neck. “John, look at me. Look at me, John.”
Sherlock watches John’s expression harden as he goes on speaking. “I don’t trust the man, not one bit. And I don’t doubt that your suspicions are entirely correct. But I think the Lieutenant’s right.”
When he finally stretches out in bed, years could have passed—the ship could have capsized, been taken by pirates, been blown to pieces by enemy fire—and Sherlock would have no idea.
“He’s a trouble-maker that one. If I were you, I’d stay as far away from him as you can manage.”
Sherlock is so deep in thought over the puzzle of the captain’s motives that it is not until he is back up on deck in the open air that he recognizes the sounds of shouting, and looking over, sees a crowd of sailors gathered to one side of the deck.
He doesn’t open his eyes; instead, he reaches out for the hand that he knows is hovering just beside his own, feels John shift the empty mug to his other hand to let him take it.
John coming inside of him, filling him up in a way he didn’t think was possible.
“Hey,” he says, and Sherlock’s heart swoops and plummets several leagues into his own belly where it continues pounding, loud as Fionn’s drum.
John kisses him then, desperate, and his hand starts to move, the callouses on his palm sliding against the sensitive skin along the length of Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock is grateful then that John’s mouth is covering his because the cry he makes is muffled by the presence of John’s mouth.
Moriarty wasn’t always there to begin with but no matter the situation, no matter the place, he would always appear, gliding out of the corners with his mouth twisted in a smirk, coming to rest his cold hands on John, to murmur things that filled John once again with shame. Sometimes he would try to fight back but any time he went to lift his fist he would find that his hands were bound, his ankles shackled, strung up like a puppet on strings. The angrier he got the harder Moriarty would laugh.
When he came to sit back down, he sat right next to Sherlock, pressed his shoulder in against him.
Sherlock watches John's hand make a fist, swing through the air at nothing, and then clench hard on the handle of his cane. He drops his head. This gesture is worse than any of the others.
John’s fingers are gentle but steady as he pulls the fastenings free and then moves to tug the material down.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Oh please. They only sell it in the Virgin Islands, and I know this is your first voyage. Besides, no midshipman could ever afford it.”
Sherlock stayed silent in an attempt to honor John’s recent request.
“How do you wake up every morning knowing you’re the one who sold him out? That you handed your brother over to a criminal mastermind? You
Sherlock can see the grey outline of John’s cheek curve upward in a smile. “I was five years old the first time I kissed a girl.”
Sherlock made an abortive gesture—John saw the corresponding ripples strike the walls of the tub.
From this angle, he could just make out the fringe of Sherlock’s eyelashes against his cheek, the bone in his jaw as sharp as a blade.
It’s only the third time they’ve managed to find time to do it and in spite of his renewed commitment to the strengthening exercises John taught him, Sherlock is feeling his weakness keenly today.
He feels utterly laid bare—hot and searing; he wants John to take all of him.
He gives it up as a lost cause and then, with one last longing look at his violin case where it’s poking out from under the bed, he exits his cabin and makes his way to the upper decks.
As the
“It was like magic,” he says risking a look up at John, and is rewarded by the sight of a slow smile unfolding over John’s face, making his features look softer, warmer, like he’s lit up from within. It encourages Sherlock to go on speaking. “You made everyone forget—just for a few minutes—all of the terrible things that have been happening. And that’s like magic. That you can do that… that you did that.”
It takes Sherlock until the end of the first verse to realize that of course, this is not a song that John has written about himself from Sherlock’s point of view—but is obviously meant to be from the point of a view of a woman.
Terrorized by embarrassment and fear though he may have been, John found he was also harder than he’d ever been in his life. He could feel the tip of his now-neglected cock leaking pitifully at the slit.
him—off the ground, his hands supporting John’s buttocks. John didn’t question it. He lifted his legs and wrapped them around Sherlock’s waist to give him better purchase. This new turn of events meant he was closer to Sherlock than ever, his groin pressed into the heat of Sherlock’s stomach, Sherlock’s hands warm and firm on the crease of his buttock and thigh.
“Which floor?” The elderly man asked politely, his gloved finger poised above the buttons.
“He—” Sherlock is staring at her with a kind of nonchalant intensity. He isn’t fooling anyone.
“Yes,” John says, covering Sherlock’s hand with his own. “Our departure is long overdue. Farewell, lads. See you back onboard tomorrow.”
However, his fingers aren’t enough this time. He reaches for the comb he keeps, bending his head over the bucket as he begins to work the teeth through the ragged snarl of his hair, wincing at the pressure on his sensitive scalp, water running down his naked arms to form a puddle on the floor beneath him.
The effort of shouting costs him. John feels the sweat running like a river down his back. Sherlock is right. He isn’t going to last much longer. It’s taking all his energy to remain standing.
Sherlock wonders if it’s possible to be drunk from pure happiness.
Speech is beyond him but Sherlock hears himself make a whimpering sound, and John seems to understand.
“You have the most beautiful mouth I’ve ever seen,” John says and his voice is heavy and slow, like liquid sunlight; full of beautiful, unspeakable things. Sherlock can feel the effect of it traveling from somewhere below his sternum deep into his belly.
But somehow, by some miracle of the gods, one by one, the hours pass him by, until Sherlock is pacing the length of his room like a caged animal, anxiety pounding through him with every beat of his heart, listening, waiting for the sound of the ship’s bell to ring out four times.
Sherlock winces as he hears the sharp crack of Anderson’s hand against the boy’s cheek.
Sherlock can feel himself blushing at John's words. The things John is saying… they should sound completely inane, but coming from John's mouth, in his low voice, deep in his throat, slightly rough—it turns Sherlock's bones to jelly, makes him squirm against the mattress in an unconscious effort to find some relief for the throbbing heat between his legs.
Sherlock opened hazy eyes and looked up at him. “I admit, I’m feeling weaker than I’d like but say the word and I’ll help you. Don’t know if I can stand though.” He frowned and tried once again to sit up.
Sherlock arched his back slightly and his answer was a sigh. “Yes. God, yes.”
Sherlock parts his thighs and then using his grip on John’s neck, pulls John down until their mouths are only a hair’s breadth apart.
apologize for what you just did for me—not under any circumstances.”
He turned, thrust his feet into his shoes, and made his way down the stairs of the flat, out through the front door and onto the street.
The man walks in a wide circle behind John—the sound of his shoes on the concrete floor echoing strangely in the cavernous space.
“Some of us have had sustenance,” Sherlock murmured, mouthing the shell of John’s ear.
The eyes behind the holes in mask were pitch black.
Carefully, Sherlock withdraws his finger from the heat of John’s body, and with some reluctance pulls his mouth off John’s softening cock.
“My god how I’ve missed you.”
Whatever just happened, Sherlock hates it. Whatever it is inside of John that makes him ashamed of his feelings, ashamed of his own desires, Sherlock wants to find it and destroy it.
Lestrade must sense Sherlock’s insolence from his silence because he continues, his voice slightly pleading.
“…because I knew it made you insensate with lust? Yes, very good, John. As always, a bit slow to catch on, but you do always get there in the end. I’m just going to have a word with the driver, tell him to take us directly to the club.”
“What is it?” he asks, before adding in an undertone. “What did Deverall want?”
He’s never given Sherlock so much as the time of day before but now he’s walking up to him as though they were lifelong friends.
He eats as quickly as possible, avoiding eye contact with the other passengers, shoulders hunched up around his ears.
Anderson, momentarily disoriented by the blow, sags in Dimmock’s grasp. But as soon as Deverall reaches to take his other arm, he begins to struggle again.
Lestrade shakes his head in disbelief.
“The thing is… it’s a bit more challenging to be on the receiving end, so I thought we might try it with me in that position first, the receiving position that is… that way you can learn how it’s done, and the next time well… we’ll work up to it,” John says with a sudden grin, and it’s like the sun catching on a pane of glass; Sherlock is momentarily blinded by it.
“Does he send you away after he fucks you? Or does he make you sleep at the foot of his bed? I’m surprised he hasn’t put a collar on you yet.” He squeezed the hinge of John’s jaw, stretching it open. “How many ways has he marked you? How many of your filthy little orifices has he
All anyone can talk about is Rio.
John finally looks up at him; he seems to come back to himself.
Sherlock’s hands were grasping John’s shoulders, desperate.
Sherlock nods—the barest dip of his head to show he’s heard.
“What do you know about sound-proofing floors?” John asked, this time reaching for his wine glass.
“Jesus, Sherlock—”
He doesn’t like to think about the reason he is here, of all the misery he left behind him back in England.
“I have not been avoiding you. You’re the one who hasn’t been speaking to me! You’ve been following me around the flat like a tetchy cat!”
“Sir, you must understand—”
John’s mouth is pressing kisses to the skin just below his ear; his voice, a warm rush of breath against Sherlock’s ear, is filled with regret. “I hate that I can’t see you.”
“We should play another game of whist again soon. We made a good team, didn’t we? Well, I’ll leave you to your walk with Miss Hooper. Enjoy the rest of your morning, Mr. Holmes.”
“I like to know how things work,” he says quietly.
And then signs the letter before he makes it any worse.
Sherlock is so shocked and confused that for a moment he cannot speak at all.
He didn’t actually speak to any members of John’s mess—Stevens is part of the same watch but he’s on a different mess which means he’s under the command of a different midshipman—so
Sherlock has to admit he’s grateful for the alcohol. Even after just one pint, the razor sharp edge of his anxiety over John’s absence and the ticking clock has diminished slightly. He can still feel it—like a constant pressure against his heart—but it’s easier to bear with the alcohol, makes his awareness of the passing time less acute.
“Well, give it to me,” Sherlock snapped, his patience worn thin by exhaustion and misery.
“Yes, my love?”
“Burn to death or bleed to death. Didn’t really have a preference.”
In the wake of the heat of John’s mouth against his skin, the issue of whether or not to light the lantern has fled from Sherlock’s mind to make room for much more pressing concerns, such as where John’s mouth will go next.
John remembered the sounds of Sherlock throwing himself against the door, the wild, animal force behind it, and he almost stopped halfway down the stairs and sat down, so overcome was he by sheer, raw sympathy.
Sherlock clings to the shadows, listening hard.
John dropped his other hand to the bed and leaned into Sherlock with the full weight of his hips. He heard Sherlock gasp as he pushed all the way in. Sherlock dropped his head back against the mattress, his eyelids fluttering shut.
“You just tell me if it becomes too much, all right?”
“Welcome to Rio,” John says, and grins, then tightening his arm around Sherlock, he guides the two of them up through the surf and onto the bright sand.
Sherlock can feel the warm, low pulse of his desire building in him and never has he longed so much for his release, or worked so hard to find it. Its impending presence makes his throat go tight, inexplicably makes tears prickle hot behind his eyes, and he suddenly remembers the whole point of all this was to convey to John his own importance, but Sherlock forgot, he got distracted, and just as he’s opening his mouth to tell John, his orgasm bursts through him—searing and bright and all encompassing.
They seem to have gotten into every crack and corner. He’s almost certain he has found them all but then horrifying visions of John slicing his foot open on an undiscovered shard makes Sherlock shove aside the case that stands at the foot of his bed just to be sure he hasn’t missed a stray fragment.
“I have an hour or so before my next watch. Are you still interested in my proposition?”
John reaches up and traces the curve of Sherlock’s cheek with the tips of his fingers, his eyes full of the same dazzled expression.
He is standing on the quarterdeck now, yelling something to the sailors on the mizzenmast, and Sherlock follows the direction of his eyes to see if he can make out the instructions.
He leans down to kiss John’s mouth even while his hand begins to creep down John’s belly and towards the line of his cock.
“About a week ago. I was cleaning up some broken glass when I found it. Didn’t really think about how useful it might be. It’s doubly fortunate that it’s Ms. Simpson’s room.”
But the truth is there’s no telling what John will do; he might very well decide it’s a safer bet just to stay put.
“No, no, no, the message! What did the message say exactly? I need to know, what were the
Then, just as John reasoned that Sherlock may very well already be asleep, the Sherlock-shaped lump under the duvet rolled over and curled up against John, sliding one leg in between John’s, pressing his chest into John’s side.
When Sherlock bent down to kiss the arch of his foot before pulling on his sock, John had to put a hand up to cover his mouth, he was so overcome.
Sherlock blushes as John reaches out to take his hands again and pull him closer.
“Lieutenant! If you’d just take a moment to say hello, I’m sure you’d understand why I’m keeping you from your drink.”
“That’s right—if the captain doesn’t break the ship in two tryin’ to get us there.”
Sherlock’s head snaps up in disbelief.
“You’ve said that a lot tonight.” Sherlock’s voice is soft, his thumb still stroking over the groove in John’s hip. It feels so good he never wants to stop touching him there.
John makes no reply to Anderson’s comment other than to raise a single eyebrow in his direction.
He doesn’t say anything though because John is back against him now, his hands pushing the waistcoat off of Sherlock’s shoulders, his mouth at Sherlock’s ear, gently coaxing him to sit up so he can free him of the garment.
Sherlock turns, half-afraid that he’s imagined it, that’s he conjured John up out the depths of his misery and longing, that when he turns around John won’t be there at all.
“No, I just have an excellent teacher,” Sherlock says and then he recaptures John’s mouth with his fully and doesn’t let him speak for several minutes more.
John’s hand slid up into Sherlock’s curls, his other arm looping around Sherlock’s neck to bring Sherlock closer against him, and before he knew what was happening, Sherlock was lifting him—
He coats his fingers with it before stroking slow, all the way to the base.
Sherlock seemed to notice it in the same instant as John. He let go of John’s face to pull John in against his chest. John let go of Sherlock’s coat. He lifted his chin to Sherlock, wetting his lips. Sherlock leaned down and kissed him, tugging the edges of his coat around John’s back.
It makes fear clench hard in Sherlock’s gut.
“Our John can sweet-talk the bristles off a coconut but that doesn’t make a single word of it true!”
“Well, I can tell you that she’s twenty four years old. Her father is a widower—mother died when she was very young. She has three sisters—all older, all married with children. Her family is firmly middle class; she has no inheritance. She is on this voyage because she is headed to a position to be a governess for a magistrate’s family. She likes children but she resents the position; she would rather have children of her own. She is not close with any of her sisters. She is comelier than all of them. She’s terrible at mending, loves reading novels, and she is left-handed, in spite of the serious interjections of all her governesses.”
He’s looking at Molly with an amused expression on his face.
Sherlock looks up at the tone in his voice, feels dread begin to pound beneath his heart.
Sherlock was drenched. His hair was soaked through from the rain, water still dripping off the tendrils of curled hair around his neck. His scarf hung sodden and bedraggled down his chest. None of that caused John any distress. Neither did the fine spray of blood on the right side of Sherlock’s face, alarming as it was. What made John instantly regret his decision was the look of abject terror on Sherlock’s face.
He doesn’t dare look up again until he hears the soft sound of the door closing behind John.
Sherlock does not get a chance to talk to John again that day. He’s no longer up in the topsails when Sherlock goes back on deck after supper. He waits for a while to see if John will re-appear, but somehow he knows that he won’t see him—they’ve been granted too much good fortune already today.
It is in this manner that Sherlock whiles away the remaining hours until the midday meal.
