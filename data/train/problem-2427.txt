Castiel couldn’t say anything. It was as if his tongue had turned to stone. He looked again at the mask in his hands, at the rumpled peacock feathers. Had it truly only been just moments ago that Dean had been wearing it, that they’d been dancing, together, in this very room?
“Fuck, Cas,” he whispers reverently against the skin of his stomach. “You're amazing.” He nips at Cas’s hipbone, sucking a bruise into the sensitive skin against it, just as he’d fantasized, and it's Cas’s turn to gasp, the sound sharp and beautiful.
“I love you, too, Dean.” Castiel said, knowing deep in his heart, this would be the last time he said it. “I’ll always love you.”
“Save some for the rest of us, Cas,” the voice of Charlie said, brusquely, and Castiel stepped away from Dean. “You guys can have eye sex later.”
Dean busied himself with getting everything else ready, including snagging a bottle of San Pellegrino for Princess Bitch out there from the fridge. Cappuccinos were relatively easy, so he cranked on out for Her Royal Pain-in-the-Ass before he grabbed two clean glasses from the rack next to the sink and headed back out into the café, where he saw Cas studying the café’s surroundings while his date scrolled on her phone, her nails clicking on the table as she strummed her fingers irritably.
Castiel, too, felt a growing panic deep in his gut. Sam had to know that Dean would never allow him to take his place, that he’d die a thousand deaths to protect his baby brother. And yet, Castiel also understood it from Sam’s perspective; had he been given the chance to go back in time and trade his own life for Jimmy’s, he had done it without a moment’s hesitation. He understood what that kind of love felt like.
Cas is gorgeously sensitive, and Dean takes his time mapping out every place that makes him tick, makes his gasp and moan and clench his fist in the bedspread. Dean flicks the tip of his tongue against a nipple, and Cas jolts beneath him.
Cas grins and crawls under the covers with him. The cool sheets feel fantastic on their flushed, sweaty skin, and Dean sighs contentedly as Cas presses himself against him, molding their bodies together seamlessly. Their legs tangle, and Dean reaches around Cas to pull him closer. He tucks Cas’s head under his chin, and gently rubs his hand up and down Cas’s bicep.
No matter how much it killed him to watch the man he loved be murdered in front of his eyes, Castiel would never dream of letting him die such a death alone.
“Variety my ass,” Dean grumbles. “You can keep your damn freaky root; I'll stick to good old fashioned spuds.”
Castiel felt something inside him shatter. The pain was agonizing, splintering through his very soul, irreparable and final.
“I'm serious, Cas.” Dean wishes he could put everything he's feeling in this moment into words, the downright
He wishes they could have confessed their feelings for each other under better circumstances, but Dean can’t bring himself to regret any of it, nonetheless.
Dean turned to look at him, and Castiel noticed how his breathing had gone ragged. His green eyes were wide, and Castiel knew him well enough to know he was terrified.
“Carry on with the festivities!” Naomi announced. “For tomorrow, we rid the earth of Dean Winchester! And then, the search continues for his brother!”
Satisfied that Sam was safe, Castiel let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding since he’d seen his friend in the garden, and dropped onto a carved bench in an alcove. He buried his face in his hands and rubbed his stinging, sore eyes, clearing them of the crust of dried tears.
“I doubt it was the honey, or the soap, either. They’re from the same vendors you always buy them from.”
Castiel winced as he peeled the fake mustache from his skin, the adhesive surprisingly strong for what looked like a large bushy caterpillar that had decided to take up residence on his upper lip. Gabe had unceremoniously slapped it on him right before he’d ruffled his hair and pushed him out the door, telling him it would “add to his mystique,” whatever that meant in Gabriel terms.
Naomi stood, eyes wide and mouth open in shock as she took in the amass of people on the dais, standing in front of Dean, protectively. A wall of people stood between her and the thief that had been a thorn in her side for six years; a wall of love and loyalty, ready to fight and defend until the very end, if it came to that. And it was led by her brother.
In the end, they manage to make dinner without any major fiascos. Dean had shown Cas how to make, prepare, and cook his signature meatballs once he'd finished buttering bread for garlic toast. Sam had wandered in halfway through, enticed by the smell of hamburger meat cooking in a skillet, and Dean had put him on noodle duty.
Cas hums in acknowledgment and leans back to wipe the tears from Dean’s face. If it were anyone else, Dean would be floundering, embarrassed at his moment of weakness, but with Cas…
“You fools!” Natalia cries as she holds up the severed iris stalk. Her hands are shaking, and she screams incoherently for a moment. “Look what you’ve done!”
Castiel felt his ears flare again at the mention of Dean. His brother, ever astute, took immediate notice.
“Plain water is fine for me, thank you, Dean.” He said. He smiled gently at Dean, and Dean felt that stupid crush go up another tick.
“It appears that Natalia was in a hurry to leave,” Castiel reasons. “And she took her plants with her.”
vacuuming her out.” Dean gripes. He glances in the small folding cart Sam had taken from the trunk of the Impala. He points to a grayish lump sitting snugly on top. “Dude, what even
He stops at the edge of one of the smaller beds, where several plants are still standing. He instantly recognizes them as rosemary and sage bushes, both herbs being main ingredients in witchcraft rituals. He’s beginning to think that Sam was right, and Natalia Jennings is, indeed, the witch that cursed the iris, and subsequently murdered Marjorie Porter.
The woman picked up her cappuccino and took a sip, and Dean supposed she was satisfied, since she sat the cup back down without a comment, but she did fix him with a glare that told him that on no uncertain terms was he welcome here.
He found the cell relatively easily; the two guards stationed outside the thick wooden door was an easy clue. Castiel squared his shoulders and held his head high, channeling every ounce of royalty in his veins, and approached.
“Hey, I’m Taylor. I’ll take your order whenever you’re ready.” He flips open a notepad and poises his pen over it.
“Thank you, Sam.” Castiel squeezed Sam’s shoulder. No matter the fact that he and Dean shared a much more profound bond, Castiel had always valued Sam’s friendship and camaraderie.
Castiel frowns and steps away from Dean, who is still working on the lock, and walks into the backyard. What
Still, he and Gabriel talked frequently, with near daily texts and the odd phone call, in particular when Gabe would get drunk with his friend (and bodyguard) Luke. Castiel had definitely missed living with his brother, and seeing him more frequently would not be unwelcome, the daunting publicity and obligations that came with coming home notwithstanding.
Dean was, Castiel could tell, a sweet soul. He blushed whenever Castiel praised his food or the way he decorated his apartment, which was endlessly adorable, in Castiel’s book.
.” Dean presses. “Don’t be so hard on yourself. It’s happened to me an’ Sam lotsa times. It happens. It’s not something
Together they moved about the other dancers, occasionally stopping to switch directions, their palms always touching. Castiel felt his heart pound in his ribcage, the familiar fluttering in his stomach reaching a crescendo as Dean smiled at him, green eyes glittering with mirth behind the mask as they danced. Dean really was a good dancer; he wondered where he’d learned.
Castiel nods, and takes the position Sam instructs of him. On Sam’s cue, Dean tosses him the tennis ball, which he catches without issue.
“You snuck into my masquerade to seduce my youngest brother so that you could steal from us?” Naomi said, her voice as sharp as steel.
Sam shrugs. “Actually, not really. I got an address not long after you and Cas went to bed. I found it pretty easily once I started searching for articles about the competition from previous years. Natalia Jennings lives on 126 Lakeview Drive, on the north side of town.”
Dean loved the way Cas threw his head back and laughed, as though Dean had just told him the funniest story he’d ever heard. It would be so easy for him to fall in love with that laugh.
“I remind you that I lived in New York City, Dean.” Cas said, a smile at the corner of his lips. “There is very little that could faze me at this point.”
Cas snorted. “She’s hardly a princess, though she obviously thinks herself one. She’s Lady Bela Talbot, the only daughter of the Duke of Talbot.” He explained. Dean decided to pretend he even knew where Talbot was. “We’ve known each other since we were children, though I don’t think we’ve actually met more than a dozen times since then. My mother believes that she and I would make a good match, that solidifying a marriage with Talbot would strengthen our allyship.”
Cas let's out a disappointed sound, but still doesn't say anything as Dean rinses his hair. He grabs the other towel from where he'd flung it over his shoulder and throws it over Cas’s head.
“I know this is difficult for you.” She said. “And I know that you must think me callous. But Castiel, I only want what’s best for you. Please believe that.” She stood and leaned down to kiss his forehead. “Traditions survive because they
He slips out into the hallway and closes the door behind him as quietly as he can, and makes his way into the bathroom.
Bela loudly cleared her throat, and Castiel turned his attention away from Dean to look at her. She was glaring at the two of them, her arms crossed. Her red polished fingernails tapped peevishly against her bicep.
“Of course.” Hannah promised. She looked confused at how easily he spoke of Dean’s impending demise, but he didn’t have time to explain. “I will see you there.”
“Cas,” he says softly, leaning over to set both mugs of coffee on the bedside table. “Cas, it's time to wake up.”
“Dude, just gimme. I'll give it back.” Dean promises. Castiel fishes it out of his pocket and hands the crumpled piece of paper to Dean, who scans it before he grins and hands it back.
“I have to urinate,” Cas declares, and climbs out of the car. Dean follows suit and throws him his wallet.
Dean and Sam, as thieves, worked expressly alone. They had their family, who helped them, of course; Charlie, their adopted little sister who was an inventor; Eileen, Sam’s bright beau who, though deaf, was an expert hunter and could fell a deer with her bow from a hundred yards away, and had taught Castiel the intricacies of sign language; Bobby, their adopted father and Ellen, their adopted mother, who, along with their daughter Jo, made sure that everyone in their little village on the outskirts of the kingdom’s capital were fed, whether they could pay or not; Jody and Donna, who together ran both a mitigation agency of sorts for the village and a home for wayward girls; Kevin, a genius young man who helped them count and distribute the funds to those who needed it most. But the stealing itself, they did not allow anyone to assist them. The bounty was on their heads and their heads alone. If they went down, at least their family would not go down with them.
Castiel finds that the Roadhouse is not what he was expecting, and the bartender is something else entirely.
Dean vows, right then in there, that he will do everything in his power to never betray that trust, to protect it like the precious thing it is.
Bela’s jaw fell open, and Castiel resisted the urge to laugh. He quickly climbed out of the car and hurried to the other side.
Dean brushes his teeth, and runs a hand through his hair in an attempt to tame some of the evidence of the previous night’s sexcapade. Two hickeys adorn his throat, one near the bolt of his jaw and the other where his shoulder and neck meet, loud and proud and undeniable in their existence; he presses against the one on his jaw, relishing in the slight stinging ache. Dean doesn’t care; they stand as a testament to what was frankly the best sex of Dean’s life, and he can’t bring himself to be ashamed of them. Cas has several dotting his body from his own mouth, marking the former angel as
Cas’s eyes light up, and he sits up in bed, stretching languidly. Dean watches the muscles in his shoulders as they roll under his skin, and his throat feels dry. He schools his dick, telling it to
A few moments later, he hears footsteps crunching through the gravel of the greenhouse floor, echoing pleasantly against the birdsong beyond the greenhouse glass.
Cas sobs against his shoulder, and Dean pulls back to cradle his face in his hands. Watery blue eyes stare up at him, one hand covering his wrist, and he leans in and kisses Cas softly. Cas tastes like blood and potting soil, but Dean doesn’t care. It’s over, and they’re safe, and alive. That’s all that matters.
“Because for a moose, you're surprisingly light footed.” Dean deadpans. “I should make you wear a bell, like a cat. Then we’d know when you were coming so we could shut up.”
He smiles as he takes the shirt from Cas, and gently eases over Cas’s head and torso, avoiding his sprained wrist. A part of him cries out at the injustice of having to cover up all that perfect skin, but the other rational part that isn't directly linked to his downstairs brain is relieved; Cas is always distracting to Dean on some level, but he's less so now fully clothed than he was just a few seconds ago.
After breakfast, Castiel excused himself to his room, knowing that the afternoon would be full of obligations and performative photo shoots. He was not looking forward to it in any way; he was drained already, and he hadn’t even stepped foot outside the palace yet.
They climb out, and Cas crouches down to get the cart from the backseat. He sighs as he opens it and gingerly lifts the iris into it.
King Charles Shurley of Caelum, first of his name, was not what most people expected upon meeting him for the first time. He was on the shorter side - Gabriel had inherited that from him - and donned a short and scruffy salt and pepper beard. He preferred soft clothes any day to suits or semi-formal clothes, and was seen in his flannel pajama pants more often than not if he could get away with it. He was rather quiet and a bit of an anxious person most days, and an absolute wreck on his worst. But he was kind, and loved to laugh, and was a doting father and husband. He and Naomi were polar opposites, and yet somehow, they’d managed to build a strong bond and sleep in the same bed every night for over thirty years without smothering the other with a pillow.
“Yes, Dean.” Cas answers, and Dean turns back. Cas has already pulled the boxers and sweatpants on, leaving the sweatpants just where he'd kept the towel, low low
Naomi nodded. “Of course. I’ll make sure no one bothers you for the rest of the evening.” She smiled at him. “Rest well. The execution tomorrow is bound to draw quite a bit of excitement.”
to fuck me into the mattress? Gotta be careful, Cas. A guy like me could get used to that kind of treatment.”
“Like that, sweetheart?” The endearment falls from his tongue, and Dean can't bring himself to care. This is Cas; there is nothing to be embarrassed about.
Castiel had never witnessed agony like that before, the way his brother, who had been nigh on catatonic since Castiel had arrived back in Caelum on the first plane out, had completely and utterly shattered when he discovered that he’d not only lost his wife, his soulmate, and his Queen, but his child too.
. And suddenly, out of nowhere, you're kissing me, telling me you want me? I'm suddenly…” He swallows, and looks away, shaking his head. His jaw ticks and he bites his lip. His voice is soft and broken when he says, “I'm hexed with a luck curse and I'm suddenly getting everything I've ever wanted? And you expect me to believe this is real?”
“There!” He says brightly, pulling the towel away abruptly, leaving Cas with an epic case of bedhead that rivaled the way his hair had looked all those years ago, when he'd still been wearing Jimmy and his ill-fitting suits. “That should help.”
“If you can beat Ellen to it, I’ll let you.” Dean said, depositing a sleepy Alex in Jody’s arms. He ruffled Claire’s fine blonde hair, and she squawked in protest, glaring at Dean and smacking his hand away. Dean laughed. “Feisty, just like your moms. Never change, kiddo.”
“Besides, I never pegged you for a romantic, Cassie.” Gabe teased, and took another hit from the flask.
Oh. Right. The iris. The luck curse. In the euphoric afterglow of last night, Dean had almost forgotten.
Castiel stood aside and waited as the rest of Dean’s family got the chance to hug him, and tell him how glad they were he was alright. Donna kissed him squarely on the cheek.
“Aren’t I, though?” Natalia laughs. “Oh, Dean, you really are all brawn and no brain.” She holds up her hand, and her fingers start to glow purple.
Dean shudders, and quietly slips into Cas’s bedroom to retrieve a pair of sweatpants, boxers, and a Looney Tunes t-shirt Claire had found for him at a thrift store in Chattanooga and had sent to him with a card that said, “To Doof, Love Claire.” Cas still has the card propped up on his desk next to the lamp, next to the growing stack of postcards Claire and Alex sent him from their travels.
The need to find Dean, to make sure he was alright, to touch him and see him, if only one last time, was overwhelming. Castiel knew that there was absolutely no chance for a jailbreak; Perdition was the most heavily guarded prison in all of Heaven, impregnable, sinister, and deadly. The keeper, Fergus Crowley, was known for the way he ran the place like a well oiled torture wheel; Crowley often boasted that it wasn’t called Hell for nothing. Castiel shuddered to think of the stories he’d heard of Crowley’s cruelty towards the prisoners; to him, dealing with criminals such as Dean was an art.
“I, uh…” Cas looks down at the iris, still radiant and stunning, despite its darker properties. “I’m just going to go back to my own room.” He turns to go. “Goodnight, Dean.”
“I was.” Cas says. “But...I’m having a hard time with the wrist I sprained.” He looks up, and Dean can read the shame in those big blue eyes that he knows all too well from his own glances in the mirror. It’s hard for Cas to ask for help.
“Alright, I don’t know about you guys,” Dean says after they’ve cleaned up dinner. “But since you two dragged my smiling face outta bed at ass-o’clock, I’m beat.” He looks at Cas. “You comin’ or what?”
Cas turns his watery blue eyes back, and Dean leans closer. There's heartache and so much pain in those eyes, and Dean feels an ache so profound, he can feel it from his toes to the heels of his hands.
Castiel sighed. He knew Balthazar wouldn’t stop pestering until he told him about Dean. For reasons he wasn’t quite sure of, Castiel felt oddly...
In seconds, Cas is laying on top of him, bearing him down against the memory foam, kissing him, deep and hungry and
Dean scratches at one of the flakey pieces on his own stomach. He reaches into his bedside table for the wet wipes he keeps there (next to a bottle of Überlube and a dildo he's had for years) and shows Cas.
Cas turns out to be a quick study; he’s slowly making his way down Dean’s body, just as Dean had done to him, and it's driving him
“No, but I know we have a few in the laundry room for when we wash our winter coats.” He says. “Just...get me one, okay? Me and Cas will be outside.”
“No.” Dean said from the floor, his voice hard and clear despite the knife at his jugular. “He didn’t know who I was. I tricked him. I told him I was a lord from the countryside.”
Castiel jumped to his feet. Maybe he couldn’t save Dean; maybe he couldn’t raise him from Perdition, but he could still make sure that he was alright, that Castiel got the chance to say goodbye. He couldn’t bear the thought of allowing Dean to go to his death without hearing he loved him one last time.
“Then promise me one thing.” Dean looked at him seriously. “Take care of Sam and the others for me. Please, Cas, take care of my brother. Make sure this doesn’t happen to him. Get him outta the kingdom, away from here. Please, just make sure he and the others are okay. That’s all I ask.”
“Dean!” Cas cries, and steps forward to help him. Natalia sends him flying across the room where he slams into a table of Gerber daisy displays; several of the plants rattle and fall, terracotta pots shattering against the concrete. He gasps in pain as his back collides with the edge, and falls to the ground in a heap. He drops his gun as he does, and Natalia kicks it away from them until it clatters under a table somewhere in the depths of the greenhouse.
“Here, lemme see.” Sam takes Cas’s hand in his, and Dean tries to stamp down on the flare of jealousy, hot and striking, that sparks in his gut for a split second. Sam cradles the back of Cas’s hand in his palm, and gently runs two fingers down Cas’s forearm.
“I bought it at the greenhouse.” Castiel explains. “Dean thought it would be a good addition to the garden I'm planning.”
“Is there any way to find out who else was in the contest? Anyone Marjorie would have made an enemy of?” Cas asks. Sam shrugs.
“I also found a sage and rosemary bush.” Castiel points in the direction of the bushes. “Which areー”
The last time Castiel had seen his brother had been just under two years ago, when Gabriel had flown out to New York to visit him shortly after the second anniversary of Kali’s death. Gabriel and Kali had met quite by accident at a hotel called
“What the hell, lady?!” He hollered. “You come in here, acting like you own the place, bad mouth my staff, break my shit, and then have the balls to demand a new dish?!”
“I would like to speak with you both sometime very soon.” She said to the brothers. “If what Castiel says is true and you have both been providing some sort of vigilante income services to the poor of Heaven, I would like to know the circumstances that led you to take up such a profession in the first place. However,” she looked at Castiel. “I can see that you are both tired, so we will postpone our meeting until you’ve had the chance to get some rest.”
“Too bad Charlie is at her LARPing thing this weekend.” Sam says morosely. “She definitely could have helped.”
Dean smiled and a faint blush crept across his cheekbones. Immediately, Castiel wanted to see it again and again.
Dean gently eased the Impala to a stop on the curb across the street from the palace’s back entrance, the one Castiel had used to sneak out the week prior to go to the Roadhouse. He turned to face Castiel across the bench seat, and Castiel noticed he was worrying his lower lip between his teeth.
“Great.” Dean claps his hands together. “In the meantime, I'll make us some dinner. Since Cas is the unlucky one today, he gets to pick.” He turns his gaze to Cas, who looks back at him impassively, though Dean can see the makings of a smile twitching at the corner of his lips (lips Dean can't wait to get against his again very, very soon).
Then it’s like there’s a fucking foot on his windpipe as Natalia twists her wrist. Dean chokes, hands flying to his throat, coughing as he tries to breathe. With a pulse of magic, Natalia has him pinned to the wall, like a bug under a microscope.
But losing Dean? Was a completely different kind of loss, a deeper, robust ache that permeated every nerve in his body.
to be hitting it off, if they were going on what appeared to be a date downtown. Castiel wished he could share in her excitement.
Sam huffed out a breath, the corner of his mouth twitching up, and he reached out an arm to pull Castiel into a hug by the shoulders.
“Of course not.” She said, and Castiel could hear the false niceties in her voice. “How about we go into town, hm? I’d love to get a taste of the Caelumean culture.”
“We’re back to square one, I guess.” Dean scratches at his ear and levels Cas with a look he hopes says,
Castiel felt his heart stop, his breath completely stolen from him. He felt as though the world had suddenly tilted on its axis, as though a rug had been forced from beneath his feet. He felt the carefully manicured walls of his heart crumbling to ash, leaving him completely and utterly defenseless.
“I know.” Castiel kissed his forehead, and felt how his lips trembled against the skin there. He was just barely holding it together, trying to stay strong for Dean. “I love you, too.”
“I said I love you, okay?” He says, so fast that it almost comes out as a single word. He strokes Cas’s hair, heart in his throat. “God, Cas, I fuckin’ love you.”
Cas does as instructed, settling his neck on the towel. Dean uses his hand to cup water and spoon it onto Castiel’s cranium, using the other to shield his eyes. Once he's gotten most of the dirt out, watching it swirl down the drain and leave a thin layer around the bowl of the sink, he pours a generous amount of shampoo into his palm and gently lathers it into Cas’s thick hair, massaging the suds into his scalp, tugging lightly at the bubbly strands.
“I am not going to execute you, Castiel!” Naomi said, and he could hear the anger in her voice. “Now stand aside!”
Marjorie Porter’s headstone isn’t hard to find at the Hastings cemetery on the edge of town. It’s a large, shining slab of polished pink marble, with a half ogee top, nestled beneath a shady maple tree. The freshly tilled earth from her funeral a few days prior is a dead giveaway as Dean and Cas slowly make their way through the grass towards it. They stop in front of it, and regard it for a moment.
The woman shrugs. “It came with that sign stuck in the pot. Your guess is as good as mine.” She pulls a sale pad from inside a lockbox on the desk and starts filling it out. “Either way, it's a gorgeous iris. I'm kind of sorry to see it go.” She smiles at Castiel. “Are you giving it to someone? Your mother, maybe?”
Gabe steered them down the hall, and Castiel shoved his arm off of his shoulders, feeling too boxed in all of a sudden. He sighed and ran his hand through his hair, trying to stave off the migraine he could feel beginning to form at the base of his skull.
“I–” Dean gathers every shred of courage he's ever had. He's faced down demons, wendigos, vampires, angels, demigods, and even Death himself, but nothing has scared him like this.
“Are you dizzy or somethin’?” He asks. “Did you have something to drink back at that farmers market and didn’t tell me? Some of that kombucha crap Sam likes?”
Dean licks his lips and finally raises his head. Sam’s face is sincere, his smile soft. He really is happy for them, and even though this isn’t exactly how he’d pictured this going, he can’t deny that he feels relieved, like an added weight has been taken from his shoulders.
Castiel could not help it; he was endlessly charmed by the sweet, somewhat shy side of Dean he was slowing getting to know as they sat together on Dean’s couch in his small apartment, dunking their grilled cheese in bowls of tomato rice soup.
“Yeah, man, just a second.” Dean’s eyes the ex-angel for a few moments, still trying to grouse what the hell is going on here as he moves back to the sink for more water. Just as he hands it over to Cas, the glass slips from Cas’s hand.
Castiel slid into the back seat and buckled his seat belt. Haley turned slightly in the front seat to get a better view of him.
Cas is sitting in the passenger seat, the iris in the footwell of the backseat, swaying merrily as the Impala cruises over dips and cracks in the asphalt. Cas is looking out the window, watching the flat Nebraska countryside as it passes. They're about ten minutes out of Hastings, having left after a shower that had taken too long for them to even grab breakfast to go if they wanted to make it to Hastings. Dean can't find it in him to regret how he'd pressed Cas against the wall of the shower under the steaming spray and dropped to his knees to give Cas the blowjob of his life. Cas had threaded his fingers in his hair and pulled just the way Dean liked until he'd came down his throat, moaning so loud Dean was sure Sam heard it.
“Hey, this ain’t your fault.” Dean assures him softly, stepping closer to Castiel’s chair. “You didn’t do this on purpose.”
“Hey, don’t do that.” Dean’s hands move to cup his face. “We’ll figure this out, Cas. I promise. We’ll find a way to break it.” He presses their foreheads together, and Castiel reaches forward to fist Dean’s jacket in his fist, allowing it to ground him. “Me an’ Sam, we’ll find a way to get this fucking flower juju offa you. I promise you, Cas, we ain’t givin’ up. I ain’t losing you now, not after I’ve just gotten you.”
Naomi glared. “I only nag because I care.” She said. “I want what’s best for Castiel, and I wish all of you would take the issue at hand much more seriously.”
Now, without the comforting and familiar presence of Jimmy at his side, masquerades held no place in Castiel’s heart. Even now, almost six years later, the shape that had grown from the absence of his twin brother was an ache so profound, it did not have a name.
Luke stopped the car, and another guard stepped forward to open the back door. Castiel steppes out, followed closely by Gabe.
Dean helps him sit down in the chair, and he frowned, looking down at his best friend in concern. Warning bells were going off in his head like fucking tornado sirens; it wasn’t like Cas to be so clumsy. Something was very wrong here.
It's a beautiful flower, there is no denying that. It stands regal and proud above all the other luscious plants in this particular row, like a king atop a terra cotta throne, looking down upon his kingdom. The petals are lush and velveteen, the color vibrant and stark, with a sturdy stalk. Castiel smiles slightly; it calls to mind the irises that had been present in the Garden, before the fall of man. He wonders if this iris is a direct descendant.
CASTIEL: Then there would be no need for your child’s sand shovel because she would die of a heart attack right there if she knew I’d smoked weed in New York.
“Castiel,” She said sternly, voice clipped in that all too familiar way of hers. “I understand you’re put out by all of this. But it’s
And, through the countless nights spent sneaking out of the palace to meet in the forests at the edge of the village, of making up excuses to go into town, of meeting in pubs and alleys and stables, Castiel had fallen deeply in love with the kindhearted green eyed bandit. And at the same time, unwittingly, he had made his first steal; just as Dean had stolen his heart, he’d stolen Dean’s too. Two completely different worlds had collided, but neither of them cared too much. Castiel could still remember the first time Dean had told him he loved him, before pressing him against soft moss in a moon bathed glade in the forest to whisper it into his skin.
“There’s nothing in the law that says your suitor has to be royal or a member of the nobility, Cassie,” Gabe reminded him. “Kali wasn’t either.”
Castiel shook his head. “Strippers will not be necessary,” he said. “But thank you, Gabriel. If I need to talk, I will come to you.”
Castiel slowly stands, rosebud still in his hand, and walks a bit farther into the yard. He leaves the iris on the concrete of the back patio, and ventures forward, looking at the destroyed garden before him. Some of the holes in the beds still have roots, jagged and mangled in the soil like bones in a mass grave, and it is clear they’d been hacked at in a hurry. Castiel realizes he’s gotten too far from the iris when he trips in one of the holes, barely avoiding a broken ankle as he stumbles to the side.
Castiel swallows. In the months since he's been human, he's had this happen several times, mostly written on napkins in bars while on hunts. And while Castiel can appreciate the flattery that comes with both men and women finding him attractive enough to slip him their numbers in the hopes of a response, no human has caught and kept his rapt attention whatsoever.
“So, you gonna call her back?” Dean asks as Castiel crumples the receipt and drops it into his canvas bag. Castiel shakes his head.
“This’ll do the trick.” The guard said, kicking one of the halves of melons away as he cleaned the blade of the knife. “Sorry to say it won’t be much of a show, but at least it’s sure to kill Winchester right and proper.”
And yet, Castiel could not deny that he wanted to get to know him better. That there was something about Dean that intrigued him.
Dean didn’t deserve this. He was the best man Castiel had ever known, after Gabriel and Jimmy. He was kind and compassionate, with gentle hands that had always touched Castiel as if he were something precious, something fragile. He had never, not once, treated Castiel as though he were anything less than his equal, and Castiel had treasured that about him. To Dean, he was just Cas. Not a prince, but a man.
“Hey, little brother!” Gabe pushed away from the car and grabbed Castiel in a big bear hug. “Long time, no see!”
“Fine.” Castiel concedes, and reaches out and gingerly picks up the iris’s pot. Its awkward to walk with it, considering how large it is. Dean reaches out and grabs one end of the pot, and they walk with the iris between them to the little desk set up in the corner at the front of the greenhouse, where a young woman with black hair sits in a lawn chair reading a country chic magazine. She smiles as they approach.
on the other hand, can get the fuck out. I’d suggest you see yourself out; you won’t like it if I have to do it for you.”
It’s just that ever since Cas became human, for real this time, it’s been harder and harder for Dean to keep his hands to himself, and to keep his mind from wandering. But he can’t help the way his palms sometimes sweat when they sit too close in a diner booth while on hunt, or the way he can’t stop looking at Cas’s hands when he cleans his weapons, or how the way he smells when he’s sweaty and gross after his morning runs with Sam is distracting and makes Dean think about all the ways
“I have missed it.” Castiel admitted. He had especially missed the summers here; the summers in the city had been scorching, and the heat had caused the smell of the garbage on the curbs and in the dumpsters to fester. It had been the one thing he had not loved about New York. The summers of Caelum were mild and usually very comfortable.
Within seconds Dean had Castiel in his arms, kissing him soundly. Castiel raised his hands to cradle Dean’s bruised face, and kissed back. Dean tasted of blood and the dirty cloth of the gag, but Castiel didn’t care.
Before he could overthink it, Castiel leaned across the bench and kissed Dean’s cheek before he unbuckled his seatbelt and climbed out of the car.
Dean surges forward, and Cas meets him halfway, their mouths crashing together. Their teeth knock, but they don’t care; Dean has never had a better kiss in his life. Cas kisses him like he’s the very air he needs to breath, unlike the first time, which had been soft and sweet, this is fire and passion, and Dean pours every ounce of everything he’s ever felt for this extraordinary man into it.
He feels his cheeks and ears burn in embarrassment as the Winchesters burst out laughing. He points a glare at Dean when he jogs over and offers Castiel his hand.
“Isn't that the point?” Cas asks him, and if he weren't so fucking turned on right now, Dean would roll his eyes at the former angel’s sass.
Laying here, naked as the day he was born with the man he's pined after for nigh on a decade pressed warm and heavy against him, Dean supposes that none of this should come as any sort of surprise. He and Cas have been caught in this dance for as long as Dean can remember. They've always been hurtling towards one another, always destined to collide, to end up here, in this moment, wrapped together in one another’s arms. Nothing has ever felt as
Castiel very carefully makes his way back to the patio, taking care to watch where he steps, where he grabs hold of the iris’s cart, instantly feeling simultaneously better and annoyed at having to rely so heavily on a flower for relative safety. He holds the rosebud out to Dean, who frowns and takes it from him, holding it up to the light to get a better look at it.
A guard brought forth a large melon and sat it on the block, and held it in place to make sure it would stay steady and not roll off before he stepped back and picked up the sword another guard handed him. He raised it, and plunged it downward, severing the melon in half with a single stroke.
“Yeah, Cas is right, don't bother with Crowley.” Dean agrees. “He’ll just bitch and moan about it for weeks. Make our lives a living hell. No thanks.”
Castiel nodded. “Good. And, if you see Master Crowley, you are to inform him that I have a royal command that this man be treated with dignity and respect until the time of his demise draws near, and if my orders are disobeyed, I will see to it that he receives the worst treatments Perdition has to offer for himself.”
“Okay, I think we’re starting to get a picture here.” Sam muses, nodding. “Let's do eight feet, Cas.”
“You’ll have to forgive Lily,” Castiel said as he gently ushered Bela away from the car towards the café. “She doesn’t have much of a filter.”
“Don’t care.” Dean said. “I’ve seen enough to know that you’re a spoiled bitch that needs to be taken down a peg. Get the fuck out.”
“Cas!” Dean and Sam both are at his side in an instant, reaching out to grab him by the upper arms to haul him back to his feet. “You okay?”
, and you still find something worth wanting in me.” Dean presses a kiss to Cas’s forehead; Cas lets him. “That...detachedness had nothing to do with you, or how I wanted you, Cas. It had everything to do with me, and how I'm...I'm poison. I infect and hurt and break everything and everyone I touch. I mean, fuck, Cas, you gave your
again. “If this is anything like the time Sam and I found that rabbit’s foot, things could go sideways fast. Didn’t that iris’ last owner die under mysterious circumstances?”
Tessa held the kitchen door open for them, on her way to grab an apron from where they were hanging nearest the time clock. Dean patted Kevin on the shoulder as he walked past, and Kevin gave him a half smile, half grimace.
Cas raises his head from the pillow. “I believe this is what they mean when they say that the moment is ruined, Dean.” He says, and buries his face back in the pillow.
Dean groaned quietly, and Castiel gently lowered his head down onto the floor. He soothed him instantly with a touch, knowing that he would not find the strength to leave him should Dean awaken. If he was going to leave, it would have to be now.
The idea of hurting Cas gives Dean pause. It's been a long ass time since he's been with a man, and he's not sure Cas has ever had sex at all, save that one time with the reaper the first time he became human. For all intents and purposes, Cas is still new to all of this, and the trust Dean sees in those eyes when he gently pushes the former angel down onto the bed are enough to make him weak in the knees.
He pulls aside the collar of his shirt to mouth at his collarbones, which elicits another breathy moan, and Cas’s hand comes up to cradle the back of his neck.
“I keep wondering if I really did die.” Dean said softly. “And that this might actually be heaven. That maybe I did something good enough to deserve it.”
Losing Jimmy had been like losing a part of himself. Jimmy had been his best friend, his confidant, his rock. Losing him had been the hardest thing to ever happen to him. There had been times when Castiel had been sure he wouldn’t be able to go on without his twin at his side, when even looking in the mirror was a bitter reminder of just what he’d lost.
“Not surprised,” Gabriel said. “She’s been talking about it ever since you turned 25. The good news is, you’ve got six months til you’re 26. That’s plenty of time to find somebody moderately tolerable enough to spend the rest of your life with, right?” Gabe winked and dug around in his jacket pocket, producing a worn flask, which he promptly handed over to Castiel.
A tall young man with long brown hair rounded the corner. He held up his hands in surrender, stance apprehensive, and Castiel’s shoulders slumped immediately when he realized he recognized him.
Castiel takes a twenty from his wallet and hands it to the woman. She gives him a smile and hands him his change and his copy of the receipt.
“Dean Winchester,” Natalia chuckles darkly. She spots Cas as he comes up behind Dean, and she quirks an eyebrow. “And his angelic
to find an auspicious suitor, Charles. And on top of that, he’s expected to appear for publicity hearings and outings, he must establish his community ties through charity events and the Art Gala at the end of June, as well as hospital and youth center visits, and needs to begin preparations for managing the estate he’ll inherit after his marriage, not to mention the ties he will have to forge when a match is made.”
“Cas,” he whispers. He swallows, takes a deep breath, and leans their foreheads together. “Tell me you don't want this and I’ll stop.”
“It’s just a flower!” Brandie defends, trying to put as much space between her and Natalia as possible, but Dean can see she is literally backed into a wall. “What is so special about it that you need it that badly?”
In an instant, Cas pulls on the release mechanism for the arm holster, and his angel blade drops into his hand. He charges at the witch, blade at the ready, but she easily dodges his attack, dropping her arm maintaining the spell. Dean falls to the ground, landing in a heap, pain flaring through his entire body as his head swims. He watches as Natalia flings out a hand, and curls her fingers, and Cas gasps in pain as she manipulates his sprained wrist. She keeps twisting, until finally, he sinks to his knees and drops his angel blade. With her other hand, Natalia summons the blade into her palm, closing her fingers around the hilt slowly, getting a weight on it.
“Let’s go home.” He whispers. He turns his face and kisses Dean’s jaw. Dean feels him grin against his skin. “What was it you said when we got up this morning? You
Dean splashed a bit of milk into the mug and gently pressed the coffee before pouring it into the mug. He added two sugar cubes and stirred it well before he poured himself a cup black and grabbed the mugs. He handed one to Cas as he sat down on the couch next to him. Cas took the cup and smiled appreciatively.
Bela humpfed and didn’t say another word as she sat down in the chair Castiel pulled out for her. She immediately began clicking away at her phone, not even bothering to peer over the small menu stuck in the little holder next to the condiments, though Castiel definitely did.
“That’s the idea.” Cas grumbles grumpily. He scratches off another ticket, and Dean sees he has four more in his lap. He hands the next one to Dean, who blinks at the $10,000 winner symbol shining up at him from the shiny cardstock. Filaments of the scratch powder stick to the pads of his fingers.
As soon as his sword caught, Castiel used all of his strength to carry the force of the parry upwards, and he raised a foot to kick the executioner squarely in the chest, sending him stumbling backwards and away from the block.
“It’s called Lobster Butter.” Dean explained. “It’s from Ann Arbor, Michigan. It’s my favorite. Sam got it for me when he went there on a trip once, to tour the U of M when he was considering law schools. I have to special order it these days, but I think it’s worth it.”
“No!” A new voice rang out through the air, and Castiel turned to see the tall frame of Sam climbing the dais, followed closely by Eileen, Jo, Kevin, and Charlie. Bobby and Ellen had pushed forward to stand at the base of the dais, while Donna and Jody hung back, Alex and Claire shielded in the folds of their skirts to keep them from witnessing the scene.
Dean turned Baby around the corner, pulling her into the lot behind the Roadhouse. He parked her in her spot underneath the carport, safe and sound from any bird droppings or freak hailstorms, and killed the engine.
that he would be beheaded rather than hanged. That he felt lucky to have been granted one death over another.
Cas nods, slowly. “I understand.” He smiles, and Dean can't help but smile back. He loves the way Cas smiles with his whole face, the way his eyes light up and his nose crinkles. It's adorable.
“But what does this have to do with the iris?” Cas asks, tilting his head and squinting at the little picture of Marjorie next to her obit. Marjorie had been a tiny African American woman, with a crinkly smile that makes Dean think of every grandmother he's ever met, his own notwithstanding.
Naomi smiled a tight lipped smile, and for a moment, Castiel thought he saw pity in her eyes. She reached out and ran her fingers through his hair, like she used to do when he was very young.
Dean led the way to the back of the building, opening the door that led into the back stairwell. A flight of stairs to his left led to his apartment, whereas the door immediately in front of them led to the kitchen of the Roadhouse. Dean motioned for Cas to follow him up the stairs.
Brandie nods. “Went right down the drain.” She said. “No stains, even. Gotta love poured concrete and a high pressure water hose.”
After a long moment, Dean pulled back and pressed his forehead against Castiel’s, letting out a shuddering breath before he dared a half smile.
“I...I don’t know.” Cas shakes his head, and lets Dean help him to his feet again. “I don’t know what’s gotten into me.”
, where they’d both been staying, Kali for a skiing trip, and Gabriel for a meeting with a non-profit he was interested in funding that helped underprivileged children go to summer camps. It had been, as Gabriel had put it, love at first sight, and they’d hit it off, spending every free moment they’d had together for the remainder of their respective trips, and they’d begun dating shortly thereafter. They’d married three years later, in a huge cathedral wedding with thousands of attendees, and Castiel had been honored to be the best man.
Dean turns his head to Brandie smirking at them. The left side of her face is bruised, and a cut oozes blood from her upper eyelid, but she’s smiling as she holds out his and Cas’s guns.
“What are you doing here?!” Castiel demanded softly. “Are you insane?! If you got caught, do you have any idea what the repercussions would be?!”
Cas hesitates for a moment, but does as he's told. He wrinkles his nose at the cooling mess in his boxers and reaches for them, but Dean stops him.
Cas smiled. “I don’t mind.” He said. “I like your apartment better than Starbucks, anyhow.” The sincerity in his voice made Dean blush even harder than he had when he’d been checking out Cas’s ass.
“Exactly!” Sam grins. He holds up the tennis ball. “So here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re going to test the range of the luck by having you catch this ball. That way, we can better pinpoint when, exactly, your luck starts to go south.”
“Yeah, I actually, uh, live above the Roadhouse. Ellen - that’s my boss who is also like my second mom - rents me the studio apartment upstairs.”
“Why not? You were just talking to Claire the other day about planting flowers when you gave her the tour of the garden you have outside the bunker. May as well get started, right?”
Dean made a heartbreaking sound in the back of his throat as he nodded and looked away from Castiel, sniffing and wiping a hand over his face. He shuddered.
This, of course, did not stop them. All it took were a few very well timed ducks behind a column or underneath a tablecloth to quickly exchange their masks, which only caused further headaches for those trying to differentiate the two.
“Of course.” Cas says without hesitation. He stands, and grabs the handle of the cart. He nods to Sam, who raises his beer in acknowledgment. “Goodnight, Sam.”
Cas takes another long sip before he puts his mug back on the table, and falls back against the bed with another groan. He throws an arm over his eyes.
“Yeah, I get it.” Haley said, stopping at a red light. “I mean, I’m only 19 and all that shit, but my parents are pressuring me to quit driving and go to university. I dunno how to tell them that university just isn’t for me. I’d rather be doing this.”
“I wasn't kidding about you helping, though.” Dean says. He grabs the loaf of bread from the cabinet and the stick of butter, laying them in front of Cas. He rummages around in the utensil drawer and pulls out the dullest butter knife he can find and hands it to Cas. “There's no way in hell I’m letting you handle anything sharp until that thing–” He points to the iris at Cas’s side. “–is taken care of. So you, Castiel, former angel of the lord, are on toast duty.”
Castiel closes his eyes and leans into Dean’s touch. He isn’t sure he’ll ever get used to how comforting, how affirming human touch can be.
. His hands shake as he rubs his thumbs along those same cheekbones, whole now but still fragile, in a way they weren't before. He wants so badly to make this good, make good on the trust Cas has always placed before him. He wants to be worthy of it.
“I don’t.” Dean shrugged. “Andrea’s husband Benny is one of my best friends. Andrea got a call from their daughter’s daycare that Lizzie got sick, and Benny’s running his own restaurant so he couldn’t get away. Anyway, Andrea needed someone to cover the shop ‘til Tessa comes in for the closing shift, so she called in a favor.”
“If that’s what you’d prefer to call it.” Cas responded, and Dean’s brain puttered to an abrupt stop.
Cas keens, and jackknifes off the bed. Dean grins against his neck, and repeats the motion again...until he feels the wet spot that's formed at the front of Cas’s boxers. He pulls away, realization dawning quickly as he looks down, his fingers coming away slightly tacky.
Cas chuckles and kisses him one last time before he pushes himself into a sitting position. He stands and walks over to where his clothes lay haphazard on the floor, and he stoops to pick them up. Dean gets a good look at his bare ass, and takes a moment to appreciate it as Cas uses his already come stained boxers to clean off the excess of Dean’s spunk from his chest.
Castiel couldn’t help the smirk that crossed over his face. It was always so easy to banter with Dean.
“Mom’s trying to do damage control as we speak, but fair warning, she’s pissed.” Gabriel said. “Bela’s threatening to go to the press, saying you ran off with a waiter after he verbally abused her and threw her food on the floor when she asked for an exchange.”
Castiel could not help but feel as though a noose had been placed around his neck, and his mother was the one in line to kick the stool from beneath his feet.
“Cas,” Dean said against his lips. “Not that I don’t want to, but I’m way too tired to do anything right now. I didn’t sleep much after you left last night. I’m lucky I’m even standing right now.”
Castiel winced. He could only imagine the inflated story Bela was currently selling to his parents, likely making it sound as if Castiel had spurned and embarrassed her in public, rather than the fact that the truth of the matter was that Bela had embarrassed herself but mistreating Dean as she had. Still, he knew he needed to get home before any further damage was done.
But he couldn’t deny the buzzing in his bones, the way his very being as vibrating with a need he couldn’t quite pin down.
“Your Majesties,” the flight attendant - a pretty young woman named Lydia - smiled as she stepped into the cabin where Castiel and his mother were sitting. “We are about to descend into Caelum. If you wouldn’t mind securing your seatbelts, that would be wonderful.”
“I will.” Sam promised. He hoisted himself onto a low ledge of an ivy covered parapet, where it was easy to jump to the height of the outer wall surrounding the palace and back into the city below, where Castiel assumed their horses were waiting for them: Sam’s bay gelding, Ruby, and Dean’s beloved black friesian, Baby. He could hear Sam cooing to them quietly, and two sets of hoofbeats were heard running into the night.
that little voice in his head is back, and Dean is certain it's suicidal from the way it keeps popping up where it's not wanted.
Later, after Dean had return the favor and the two of them had emerged, pink skinned and warm, from the baths, Castiel had led Dean back to his chambers, and the two of them had slid, naked and still slightly damp, under the warm sheets, facing one another with their legs tangled together.
After, Castiel wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and stumbled farther into the garden, his vision blurring and throat aching from the burn of vomit. He leaned against a pillar heavily, and grief exploded across his senses, pulling him under and robbing him of his breath, before finally pressing his back against it and sliding to the ground.
“I remember.” Castiel smiled. “I also remember vividly the night you ran into my room and begged me to hide you so that princess from Providence couldn’t find you. What was her name again?”
“Won't the patrons find it a bit odd that we’re accompanied by a nearly four foot tall iris?” Cas asks as they head for the door. Dean holds it open for him.
“I did a little digging,” Sam explains. “Turns out Marjorie was a master gardener, and entered a flower contest right before she died.”
Cas smiles then, with his entire face, and threads their fingers together on the sticky tabletop. It's hard to eat his burger one handed, but Dean wouldn't let go of Cas’s hand for anything if it makes Cas smile like that.
that Mother arranges for us, and all she could talk about the entire time was the colors she wanted for our wedding and what she wanted to name our corgis and our kids.” Gabe fixed him with a terrified look. “She wanted
Dean looks down and realizes that his hands have stilled on Cas’s sides, and that there are a scant few inches between their bodies right at this moment. Dean swallows thickly, but can't seem to tear himself away. Cas is warm under the soft cotton of the t-shirt, that warmth radiating into Dean’s palms and searing into his very core.
He throws open his bedroom door and stalks inside, beelining for the dresser to grab a pair of sweatpants. He yanks off his shirt, and turns to find Cas standing awkwardly in the doorway, the hand not holding the cart clenching and unclenching at his side. He looks shy, chewing on his bottom lip.
He drops one of his hands to the hem of Cas’s t-shirt. He fumbles with it for a moment, unable to get a solid grip from the way his hand shakes.
“Shit,” he said when he saw Gabriel’s name flashing across the caller ID. “It’s my brother. I should probably take this.”
“Grab your shit.” He instructs, and Cas nods wordlessly and retrieves the lavender mint shampoo he uses from the shower stall he uses most frequently. He hands it to Dean.
Natalia is standing at the little desk, her hands flat on the surface as she leans forward. Brandie is leaning back, her eyes wide and face pinched with fear.
Bela smirked, and Dean saw her reach for the cup of cappuccino on the table. He had the frame of mind to close his eyes just in time for Bela to throw it in his face, the hot (but thankfully not entirely scalding) liquid unpleasant as it burned his lip and eyelids. He yelped and pawed at his face, sputtering as it dripped into his nose and mouth.
He was debating between a club sandwich and something called a fragel when two water cups were placed on the table and a very familiar voice rumbled,
He knew their time was growing short. The guards would be wondering what was taking so long, and why they weren’t hearing the sounds of Castiel torturing who everyone believed to be the man that had nearly taken advantage of him. But he couldn’t bear to leave, not yet. Castiel was selfish; he wanted every last moment he could get with Dean.
Castiel very carefully rises to his feet, gingerly stepping around the broken glass and pie guts still littering the kitchen floor, half holding his breath as he waits for the next mishap to befall him. He sighs in relief when nothing does.
“Shut up!” Natalia hisses, and Dean whimpers - fucking whimpers - as the hold on him raises him just slightly higher. She turns back to Cas and cocks her head, eyeing him from head to toe.
“Could you get me some more?” Cas asks. His blue eyes have taken on a feverish look all of a sudden, and it sparks further worry down Dean’s spine like ice.
Dean, unable to fight against the exhaustion that pulled at him, safe and warm against Castiel, did as he was told, and was asleep in moments.
it's amazing. He sinks his fingers into Cas’s dark hair and gasps Cas’s full name; he tries to remember how to breathe. After what feels like hours but could only have been about a minute, Cas hums and pulls off.
That's all Dean needs to hear. He grabs Cas by his t-shirt and hauls him into the room. Cas squeaks in surprise, and the cart with the iris nearly tips over as he pulls it behind him. Dean takes the cart from him and places the iris in the corner of the room, where it remains at a safe distance for Cas to move about the room. The last thing he wants are stubbed toes and smacked foreheads while they do this.
Dean clears his throat, trying - and failing - to keep his eyes above Cas’s shoulders. “Think you can handle the rest?” He asks.
It broke Castiel’s heart to know that Dean likely thought that Castiel had broken his promise to see him through his death, and had abandoned him in his final moments.
. He aches to grab Cas, throw his arms around him and never let go. But he understands Cas’s reservations; it was obvious that Cas wanted him, as much as (if not more than)  Dean wanted him, and now that he was getting it after being cursed with a luck curse...where your luck turns in your favor…of course he would question Dean’s intentions, especially when Dean, in all his repressed, I'm-allergic-to-feelings glory, had never acted on them before this moment.
Love and appreciation for these incredible people swelled in Castiel’s chest, and he dropped his sword onto the sawdust.
Naomi released her son, and looked at one of the guards in black suits with earpieces standing behind the vehicle. “If you wouldn’t mind grabbing Prince Castiel’s bags?”
“Thanks for the gift.” She says. She delivers a swift kick to Cas’s stomach, and he doubles over with a grunt of pain. “Now you just sit tight while I take care of that nasty Winchester problem, hm?”
Dean slowly opened his blurry eyes to find Cas grabbing more napkins from the dispenser on the table, continuing to mop up the liquid running down Dean’s face. He saw that it had completely soaked the front of his AC/DC shirt, too, and though his apron had caught most of it.
He supposes that should scare him, but it doesn't scare him half as much as losing him does, as living a life without him does, and that makes all the difference.
Bela regarded him with a steely look, but Dean refused to back down. He had taken too much shit for too long; he knew that Andrea wouldn’t want someone like this bitch stinking up her cafe, so he didn’t worry about that; what he did worry about was Cas, who had taken a half step towards Dean, though Dean refused to look away from Bela to see his facial expression. Dean hated to think that this could be the last time he laid eyes on the pretty prince, hated that he had likely ruined his date (despite the fact that Dean fervently believed he deserved better than his awful woman), hated that Cas would probably think him to be rude, unprofessional, and thus unworthy of any of his time from this moment on. But Dean had been shit on way too many times in his life to allow someone this petty, this narcissistic, to walk all over him for even a second longer.
The two of them made their way to the dance floor and turned to face one another, aligning their palms flat.
“Dean,” Cas gasps, and he sounds absolutely wrecked. Dean groans as he feels his cock twitch in interest. “Dean, please.”
The rest of the ride was filled with small talk between reunited brothers, Castiel telling Gabriel stories from New York, and Gabe returning with details about the Quidditch team he’d help form at the local youth club, where he was the coach. Gabriel liked to grumble about it sometimes, but Castiel knew how much he loved doing the charity and community service events that he did. Gabriel, underneath a carefree, often frivolous exterior, was a soft and caring man. He’d been a good husband, and would have made an excellent father, and Castiel knew, without a doubt, that he would be one of the greatest kings Caelum had ever seen one day.
He repeated the same thing to himself four years later, sitting in a small room that was generously called the "interrogation room". But he wasn't handcuffed to an iron table with countless dents on it, and the door and window were left open, letting in the stale air of Chicago, the city breathing by lungs of thousands of drunks and sick people, sewers and car exhaust. Dean didn't know any cleaner, more decent areas — people can't be fooled there by the tricks that he and Benny pull out, so there's nothing for him to do there.
Milton slid a piece of paper across the table to Dean. Dean made no move to pick it up. Only warily studied from a distance.
Milton could have walked the way to the Abbess Anna while asleep – it was his mother's room before, after all. In those years of hers, when the line between the reasonable and the painful, between monsters and routine maternal responsibility was erased so much that it became a thread on which Eva Milton did not even balance, but walked here and there, back and forth, like a child who plays the game "don't step on the cracks on the tiles".
A coat, a crumpled white shirt, a twisted tie flashed from under his coat, and Benny bent his head down, cleaning the shelf under the counter, casting short, rare glances at the visitor.
Dean leaned on the wall pasted over with ragged flyers, a few buildings from the pub "Lloyd`s" when Dean noticed a figure in a trenchcoat down the street. The hat is new, the coat is a bit rumpled but still vividly beige. His step was sure and even, his gaze fixed on something straight ahead - like someone with purpose would act, with a place to be. Maybe he was even waited for. A damn rare case in these places - these times. Dean felt a ping of jealousy - only for a second whatsoever.
Dean buried his nose in the collar of his jacket and breathed through his mouth, pushed the board away – it was time for him to dig out some gloves, it was too cold for November. He slipped through the crack, trying not to touch the bulging pieces of iron with his shoulder, and with an accelerated step crossed the open space behind the theater, which always made him feel naked, in full view of everyone who would bother to look.
With a light chuckle, Dean straightened up and cleared his throat. Looked the man over from head to toe as if he only just actually saw him. The corner of Dean`s lips twitched in a crooked smile. In the radioactive red glow, he couldn`t make out the color of the stranger`s eyes. Something light.
With the only exception that this one did not move from city to city, but was stuck in poor God-forsaken Chicago.
An unknown girl will go to a grave as an Unnamed Victim. By that time, Cas had lost all hope that even a single body from a thick folder would be identified.
Benny Lafitte - the bartender and accountant and all that this lousy hole needed, with an owner who had gone too far from the land of the living - could not say that he knew Dean Winchester well. It was fair to assume that no one, in fact, in this city (if not the state, there were such doubts) knew that musician with a loud voice and not a single trustworthy word.
Perhaps he could have defused the atmosphere thirty minutes ago at the identification of his father's body. Only shreds of torn flesh remained, converging on prominent cartilage and holding together only thanks to dried blood. There was simply no face, as well as half of the skull, and the sight in consistency could only resemble an exploded watermelon that later dried in the sun.
Having modestly knocked on the door frame — because again, the door itself was open — detective Milton stepped into the beam of light from a single bulb.
"Call me Dean," and then, seemingly with almost indifferent curiosity, which in itself was a lie, he asked "Can you fill me in on the details of the case? I need some idea of what I'm dealing with."
"Rise and shine," Dean said, too high and too cheerfully, clapping his hands and resting his hip on one of the boxes opposite the chair.
The thing he pulled out was an ordinary pocket watch wrapped in a black, inappropriately elegant handkerchief, one of those that were kept in many hiding places of his father, scattered throughout the city. With a simple ornate engraving on the case and a short gold chain, the watch stopped at 3:16. A thin, as if artificially made crack passed along the dial. After weighing them in his hands – not because he was checking for something, but just to stall for time – he pushed the watch, and it skidded across the table. They drove across the smooth surface directly into the thin, aristocratic, greedy hands of Bela.
He didn't put much emphasis on the part about "all the other things", but what's the point, after all, of playing conspiracy in a hunting bar.
There was nothing unrealistic about Adam's theory. Moreover, after taking a fresh critical look at the whole place, this was the first thought that came to Cas' own mind – and would have come to the mind of any decent detective who knows his business, anyone who arrived at the place on a damp, cold morning.
Maybe not now, but sooner or later – probably later - Cas will agree. With Dean Winchester, you never know for sure. That, after all, is the whole problem.
"What's weird?" he managed to squeeze out, glaring at the lacquered door a few feet away from him, now seemingly incomprehensible.
And that seemed almost enough. Almost. Dean leaned forward, from this distance he could count the detective's eyelashes and smell the stale papers that littered the police station, and coffee, and the tension lodged in his skin.
Ten steps away, Dean fixed his hat so it`s slid a bit sideways, and he plastered a stupid smile on his face, which still could have only tipsy students or a town jokes.
And he smiled. Tiredly. Thankfully. Barely lifting the corners of his lips so that almost imperceptibly. This smile reached the edge of his softened eyes and whispered about shared secrets.
Running away now would not be the best solution – if this man was someone to whom Dean owed money or whose pockets he emptied, then the best solution would be to stay in a public place. If it`s a cop, he`s probably not the only one in here.
By this point, Dean was almost sure that they were beating out confessions here simply by threatening people that instead of prison, they would spend the rest of their lives in this nice comfy place. Dean wasn't sure if it was the coffee stain he was seeing in that corner on the wall or mold — he was more grateful than ever for the poor lighting.
"The fact that the murder fits Hunter's signature when the main suspect has been dead for a week. Maybe a copycat?"
With a heavy sigh, as if he was carrying the weight of the whole world on his shoulders, Dean looked around, absorbing every small detail of the familiar bar, a small, constantly poorly lit room with cracks in the walls and notches on the tables and wooden panels.
Detective Milton just nodded before taking out another folder, did everything the same as with the first one, and Dean once again said that he had no idea who it was and how he could have ended up where he did. Clearly not because of something pleasant. Castiel didn't appreciate the humor — neither did anyone in this precinct if you start pointing fingers.
The hollow corridors were not an echo of their past life or a crooked mirror as it always is, but, in Dean's opinion, an imitation of a decomposing body. Clods of dirt that had come from nowhere were nesting in different corners and right under your feet, ropes and wires were hanging from innocent-looking corners. Traces of plaster on the floor and whole pieces of the ceiling fell as if the theater was suffocating under its own weight, trying to return to earth - to where everything came from. Maybe then something noteworthy would have come out of it.
On the other hand, the man could be an ordinary visitor, who Dean just so happened to have bumped into earlier on the street, and now whose wallet was resting in the pocket of Dean`s coat in the back room. Could be.
. But first, he needs to visit the apartment of the detective in the ridiculous un-ironed coat. And then he needs to make a call. Home.
"You know this is just a fucking nightmare, right? I wouldn't let anything happen to you," he tried to catch his brother's eye under all that hanging fluffy bangs. "Sammy?"
"You know I'm done with this," he objected quietly so that his words could be lost in the static noise of voices and the cheerful clink of glasses.
And he clearly understood that it was better for him to look away and keep his mouth shut when a man in a beige coat marched into the room, with a look full of intent and purpose, which was often absent these times, and with a posture shouting "soldier".
And it looked... the first time Cas found himself in such a place after breakfast, he was impossibly tempted by the prospect of bending over in half in the nearest dark corner, emptying his stomach.
and also the client remembered. Everything was left to chance though, this piece of paper was lost in the archives — I stumbled upon it myself by accident. But what a coincidence that I know a farmer's son with a scar above his eyebrow and a shady past and present, not to mention the aggressive temperament of his father, which the entire farmer's market was talking about."
First of all, you need something unsightly to wear. Something grey, with specks of ashy green. And you need an innocent face - but know your measure. You don`t want to pass as
Without paying the slightest attention to the hall, Dean dived around a dark turn hidden in the very corner. He fished a flashlight out of his jacket pocket as he descended the narrow but steep stairs. He breathed through his mouth, fighting the musty smell.
This earned an unexpected laugh from Dean, the sound coming from his throat slightly distorted, with a hint of surprise.
In the old days, such rituals were performed. And in the vast majority of cases, they could be obtained in churches. In more ancient times - for nothing, in those times when stories about Hunters were perceived as facts. Cas wasn't sure about the situation right now.
It was strange, this sincerity of silence. No conventionalities Dean was used to. The old and long-sleeping feeling of intrigue, those hundreds of little knots of anticipation in his ribs.
"What kind of information do you need?" Bela got down to business, not even exchanging barbs and third-party comments. Either a really important trinket or a busy evening and she wants him out of here as soon as possible.
It was a subtle and almost imperceptible change, but something in the shade of Bela's gaze changed. She looked at him as if he was something new, unexpected. Incomprehensible. Unpredictable.
There was someone's anger. There was a punishment. A devil was rising on the dry land of a forgotten ivy-covered church. Visions of an unfamiliar cemetery and Dean, directly at the opposite side of Sam, with a serene calm face —
Dean did not say that he didn't appreciate their common contribution to this world, but he also didn't believe that someone who knows how to contain the amount of alcohol that can kill a horse has the right to consider themselves better than him. Especially not after they have consumed a fair amount of booze to the extent that their tongues are slurred and their hands do not obey anymore, they start sending him greasy smiles.
Leaning back in his creaking chair and folding trembling hands in his lap, Dean smiled, crooked, tight.
She turned the watch in her fingers, carefully balancing it on the handkerchief and not touching the watch itself directly with her bare hands, looked at this and that angle, studied the chain and engraving – and then, carefully putting the reason for the negotiations on the table, turned her studying gaze to Dean. Waiting for him to start a story about the thing. Start bidding.
"So what are you up for?" She tilted her chin slightly, looking into his eyes, into his very soul. "You gonna tell an old friend?"
Anna knew that he was a detective, knew about a series of murders, and was one of the smartest people Cas knew.
"Not sixteen years old. Fifteen," Dean noted in a tone as if he were telling a joke. "You'd know that if there was a date on your little piece of paper."
"This trinket was stolen from a drowned girl in Wisconsin a couple of years earlier," Dean nodded at the clock, sitting down in a chair, relaxed and lifting his chin. "No one knows for sure, but there was a rumor that she was... special. She could predict the future. And I mean read fortunes on the palms of people's hands, laid out tarot cards and all such things. But when she predicted that the Saturday freight train would crash and kill one worker and a couple of kids on the rails - then they began to listen to her. Go to her doorstep in droves. No one is sure how or when she ended up in the river, but all they found on her was a nightgown and this watch, clutched in her fist. Presumably, that was a gift from her watchmaker father. The stories claim that those who take possession of the clock will gain something like the gift of providence – they'll be able to predict their own death. Nothing particularly sinister, but the" predicted " deaths seem a little premature to me, but what does it matter to you or your clients?
Dean sighed and some of his playfulness and lightness was erased from his face, disappeared as if into a dark, impenetrable corner, that corner in everyone's head where unpleasant "befores" and vile "what ifs" live, regrets and memories and guilt and the rest of the monsters. A symbolic subconscious attic, if you please. The under-bed space.
But then again, he was in the army, he was a detective. He knew better than to believe in the soul and the otherworldly. Personally, in his opinion, the thought of heaven did not bring him any relief, and the idea of hell, while well deserved for him, was not attractive either.
It's even more useful to know the right people who may know something about something. And tell you all about it. For a price.
Almost no one understands after talking with Dean that they'd left, in fact, with nothing. Half a city of unfortunate, contented idiots, fed on inconsequential shiny trinkets. They swam through the bar in the rhythm of tides, not so much ignoring that they were fooled - just not even realizing it.
After running through the chaotic lines of someone's crooked handwriting — one, two, three — Dean looked up at the detective, and on Castiel's lips, there was an almost identical to Dean's venomous grin. Only if it came out with Dean as an arrogant, self-confident criminal, which he was, then with Cas it was like an angel of retribution. A mere moments before the punishment will fall on an entire city of unbelievers and disobedient.
And noticing the reflection of something on the ground next to the girl's body, in the dirt at her open ankle, silvery and disgustingly familiar, with an unnaturally neat spot of blood in the corner, Cas recoiled.
"Miss Masters," he muttered, pretending he hadn't jumped half a second ago. "I'm surprised you haven't been kicked out of such a revered place yet. How long have you been pinching unhappy parishioners in the confessional?"
"Of course, of course," Bela nodded into her glass of whiskey, confirming that she had nothing more to say, but she didn't stop when Dean got up from the table, ready to leave. "This is all strange."
"Eventually, the department got one description. The officers thought it was due to the inexperience of the seller, but they didn't find him anyway. I don't think they even tried to find him — although it's not for me to say, I wasn't here at the time. And who would go after such a violator of order, even sounds absurd. Sixteen years old. Dark hair, cropped short, farm clothes, and a coat two sizes too big. A scar above the eyebrow. Bruises on the hands. A fresh burn on the neck. Everything that the...
Inside, as expected, it was never quiet. The rustle of footsteps, muffled conversations, prayers uttered in secret whispers, and the crackle of burning wax candles. Something so vast, so revered, closed to the point that it's almost hypocritical, cannot contain silence.
In the dusty, damp air, Castiel took a breath and pulled a single piece of paper from the stack of folders. Yellowish, crumpled at the edges and one time in the past folded four times, judging by the marks. The edges look like a torn page from a notebook.
Dean waved away her hints, jerking his head and leaning forward, moving to the very edge of the chair, as if he was ready to jump and run at any moment.
Dean had almost managed to get up and march out of the old bar when Bela suddenly asked him in such a different and completely serious, cold tone.
Drunk heads started lifting, eyes lit up with interest, and by the end of the first verse the audience was at his feet. You just go and pluck them like April dandelions. He grinned to himself, focusing attention on the string, knowing damn well what this smile does to women in here - in some men, too.
He inspected the stranger`s figure once again while he was still about twenty steps away from Dean. He knew trenchcoats like this one - qualitative, seams are strong. Fuck. Gotta do it the old way then.
"My father is dead," Dean cut him off with a charmingly venomous, warm smile. "Come up with a new excuse for keeping me here."
"And we all know that Daddy Winchester doesn't screw up," Bela's gaze darted to Dean, more focused. "So you're hoping that with the help of a detective, you'll find out what happened? Maybe you will tell him all the otherworldly nonsense that you yourself have been fed since childhood, and you will hope that he will believe you for pretty eyes?"
It wasn't so much the smell – something rotting, not sharp, but overwhelming his entire nervous system, a heavy cloud of decomposition and burnt herbs permeated the entire neighborhood. But the thing was more in the way the crime scenes looked. Ridiculous and careless, as if a child had forgotten to put away toys, but even so, they never found any murder weapon. Not once.
Fortunately, this kind of bar had another property, much more useful than the first two. It was filled with information.
At first, shortly and almost embarrassed. Hesitantly and slowly, giving every detail as if someone had put a rusty knife to his throat. As if afraid of judgment or, worse —  pity. The look that is given to the delusional wretches in dirty alleys and the freaks from mental hospitals. Sometimes to those who read sermons with leaflets about the wrath of God and the punishment from Heaven.
The drawing depicted a cross. Almost similar to the usual one that all Catholics wear, but even from the awkward drawing it was clear that it was different. Heavier, bigger, with engravings and words crawling on the sides, it was not intended to be worn, but to be held.
In her aggressively warm spirit of all the women of the Harvelle family, Ellen made him feel needed here with just two phrases. Someone she wants to see, despite how much he screwed up the last time they met. This seemed to be starting to be his personal trait.
Such spontaneous christening may bring reporters a bonus in salary, and people pleasant memorable memories apparently – but Cas, like any other self-respecting detective, only considered it a pain in the ass.
But he didn`t grab Dean`s sleeve. He didn`t start spitting insults and threats. Instead, he just sat there.
During the day, the air in the bar seemed to be lighter, as if the sounds did not require any effort to break through a thick wall of alcoholic fumes and confused voices. Nevertheless, Cas took off his coat, the skin under his shirt itched with discomfort completely not physical. Moreover, a shirt picked up just this morning from the floor by nature could not be uncomfortable, in Cas' opinion.
The tension in Dean's shoulders spread like hot metal down his spine. He clenched his fists under the table, forcing his face to look relaxed, damn it.
He could get lost in the crowd. Even if he was out of practice for years, even if he never planned on coming back to town in these obstacles.
So he answered that to the ridiculously nervous medical assistant — Dean concluded that he was seeing the body for the first time. The medic, looking away at his papers, which might not be connected with his father at all, replied that in this case, they would need a ring for a fairly large box of evidence.
"My father is dead," he said coldly, waiting for some reaction from the woman, some surprise or at least one twitch of a muscle - nothing. "And his last hunt… I think something went wrong."
Dean only caught a glimpse of the theater hall itself, leaning and grieving for the past, the hall, like no other part of the building, was teeming with ghosts. Looking at the collapsing corridors, you just see the collapsing corridors and, perhaps, an article on safety. But when you see the seats, you see people. Who were here once, frozen in anticipation and spilling cheap soda on the fancy red seats. Things created for people will always be more echoes than things.
"Dean," he didn't take a second look at the glass, the outlines of smooth shoulders and focused eyes are all professionalism, which Dean didn't actually feel, not really. "Where were you last night?"
As soon as his coat fell on the back of a chair, a glass of whiskey appeared in front of his nose, which Dean poured with such precise and rapid movements, as in the rhythm of breathing. As if he'd been doing it all his life. Which, in its essence, could be true.
"Since this is sorted out," Dean lightly slammed his palm on the counter, as if putting an end to it. "I think we need a drink."
Dean peeled himself off the wall without hesitation, squared his shoulders, and went straight ahead into the stranges`s trajectory.
"Statements for the year 1943," Milton leaned forward and clasped his fingers on the table. "Cases of arrests in the area have jumped. Brawls, fights, just random drug junkies who were found in the wrong place at the wrong time — everyone was addicted to some muck, which suddenly began to be sold through closed networks. When asked to describe those who sold them the product, they were mostly useless — either too pumped up, or claimed that they met in a dark alley behind some club and they were wearing a mask.
Rehearsed words took their own tempo, coming to life on his tongue, and from this point Dean no longer owned them but they allowed them to coexist. Dean knows that this is the moment when he should list his head and start looking for potential idiots - the ones too drunk to understand what`s going on but not too much to know that there`s still something in their wallets.
People who, sacrificing themselves, traveled around the world and fought evil, worked effectively, and left no traces, leaving nothing behind them before moving to another city, to another Evil that terrorizes the human race. Often it was a family business, even more often they did not make themselves known. Some sort of protectors, guardian angels, thanks to which you breath and live and can tell your child bedtime stories about them.
"Don't you dare doubt it, Detective Milton," Meg protested in a low voice and disappeared behind one of the columns. How she moved so silently and imperceptibly, even though she always remains right in front of you, is a mystery for another day.
"But you don't know anything? No dirt, I mean? No strange near-supernatural signs in the personal file, no missing relatives, maybe his childhood friend were possessed by a demon or a neighbor three blocks away pierced his eye with a key? Or maybe he has connections among the hunters?" he was aware that he sounded paranoid, slightly incoherent, and spoke too quickly, literally on the exhale. With a feverish gleam in his eyes, he couldn't help it.
It can be said that he didn't like being reminded about his past – about a business that he'd long ago abandoned for the good of all. He didn't agree with his father about many things in his last days, but this was certainly their common dislike. A room that smelled of stale beer and metal (from weapons and some indelible bloodstains), bars that were always filled with hunters who, with an undeserved sense of arrogance, considered themselves "better", enlightened, people who take the body count behind their backs, not for work, but a reason for pride.
The smile that Cas gave him was probably the most sincere in all their acquaintance. He looked as if someone had lifted a great burden from him at the very last crucial moment.
"Are you in trouble, Mr. Winchester? Or is it personal interest?" she asked with a hint of mockery, raised an eyebrow, and curved her bloody lips in a smile. "I thought you wanted the story of some cursed trinket again, but some detective…"
"I'm sorry," he dropped his gaze to the table for a second, respectfully, as if he was really ashamed as if he regretted it. "I couldn't find the time. You know, with work and all the other things."
Bela pursed her lips almost imperceptibly, her hand hovered over the glass before she raised it to her lips and took a neat, measured sip. Her eyes seemed to darken at the promise of a deal, although everything is possible with the play of light.
However, at the last crucial moment, something from the very inside of Dean took over, something so instinctive and fundamental that his hand trembled. Every time. Like clockwork. He couldn't finish what he started.
Having trampled on his hopes with her smooth heel with an almost audible crunch, Bela shook her head.
"I'm here for one business," Cas answered because as much as he wanted things to be different, he was really here for work.
"You know that you need to order a drink here to stay, right?" he spoke hardly above the quiet music (some damn jazz again, Dean can't let Benny near the player anymore), flashed a smile. "I'm afraid flirting with the bartender is not acceptable as payment. Do you have any other interesting suggestions?"
On Thursday morning, Cas stood under the Michigan Avenue Bridge and wished with all his chilled being that he'd refused coffee for this. It's one thing to go to a meeting with a corpse after an official call from your boss... but to run into a couple of officers cordoning off the crime scene with yellow tape, all while he was driving over the bridge after another sleepless night for the single place serving caffeine at such an early hour? It can only be his luck.
With a martyred sigh, as if deep down he was above all this – which, they were both well aware, was far from the truth – Dean reached into the inner pocket of his coat. Bela didn't even flinch, didn't even imagine that it could be a gun. They're long past this stage. Too fast, in Dean's opinion.
But something in him made him stop. To listen to the inner voice, even whisper that made itself known during the hunts before some creature attacked him from behind, or when he passed a dark, sadly famous alley.
The detective pinned him to the spot with a look, causing only truly sinful thoughts, and angelic analogies do not help at all.
The room – a cubbyhole, in fact - greeted him with a moldy smell, something resembling a swamp, a wet slap, and impenetrable darkness. With the knowledge of his business, Dean moved in the direction of one of the boxes displayed against the wall, on which a kerosene lamp rested. A rarity, in fact, he could get some money for a trinket, but in such places, there is usually no electricity, and there is no need to throw useful things around.
Hunters have been something of a local bedtime story, since the days when people still believed in monsters and threw animal bones into large bonfires to scare away evil spirits from their homes.
And, unable to resist, Dean smiled, making Cas only draw his eyebrows to the bridge of his nose. He knew where this story was leading, and that nothing depends on him here anymore — does it make sense to pretend to be an exemplary member of society? His father always tried, and look where he ended up.
And Dean couldn't help but notice the attention to his own body, and then interpret it in his own way. He flashed a short, sharp smile, like a fragment of a broken mirror.
"Winchester!" She crossed her arms over her chest with her trademark crooked grin as soon as she saw Dean on the threshold. "Do you want to explain to me why the hell you ain't showing your face around here?"
"It`s still on", Dean winked and threw back his head, consuming a shot of God-Knows-What that was the closest to him...
"Oh my God, please, I am so sorry!" Dean patted the stranger`s shoulders, awkwardly checking if he was okay. "Shit, forgive me, I didn`t see you..."
This one was, right to any expectations, slightly intimidating. The one on the steps of which you would adjust your collar and comb your hair back. It towered and exposed the ornate details of architecture on display.
Ellen just nodded. She patted him on the shoulder and went to a client, who's been trying to attract her attention for the last three minutes.
Since it explained a significant part of all the troubles that he got into both in the army and as a detective, it would explain a lot.
It was a few days later, probably on Thursday, much earlier than the first time, when the dimming light was still making its way through the wide windows and most of the visitors were still sober enough to keep up a conversation. Which made it much easier for Benny to strike up small talk with one of the girls who had just reached the age that allowed her to drink. Benny, perhaps on purpose or not, deliberately ignored the glares Dean was boring into his back.
Dean forced an embarrassed smile and slid into a high chair at the bar, one of those that didn't creak when you leaned forward a little. He had never gotten around to fixing them, even though he'd worked in these walls for a decent four years since he was eighteen and happened to stumble into Ellen's bar with a map of bruises all over his body and a couple of cracks in his ribs, and asked for help. Because of an old friendship with his father.
He pushed open the doors of the bar "Roadhouse", allowing the heat of the pipes and the breath of dozens of people to envelop him from all sides. Like entering a steam room, or a room in the middle of which a bonfire was lit. Almost suffocating.
Bela Talbot, as was her custom, occupied a tiny table at the far end, half-hidden in shadows and secrecy. It could have been thought that she was waiting for a secret lover, about whom she did not want people to find out. If not for the dark-blue suit of a strict cut, men's shoes with pointed noses and the cold, calculating look of a person who sees in the interlocutor not character traits, but numbers. Dark red lipstick, a shade of rust and dried blood. Dean wouldn't have been surprised if it really wasn't lipstick at all – if you think about it, Bela could have sunk her teeth into the neck of a random passerby right now and Dean would probably have said only "I thought so".
Exactly "filled". Or more like a tangle of loose threads. You hear a word here, a rumor there, a thought that accidentally slipped from drunken lips over here. You need to have the experience to unravel this.
Cas was more drawn to eternal oblivion, silence, emptiness, not being concerned by nothing and no one for the rest of eternity. One moment, he is here, and the next - he isn't. Gone. And there was no one to grieve, except maybe for a couple of his colleagues and perhaps Meg Masters, but he didn't want to know what Meg herself felt on that part, how she would react. As any mortal would not want to stand in front of a box in which a bomb could potentially lie, and being ordered to kick the said box.
A heavy pause. Dean could hear every boot clatter and every glass clink, all the drunken voices at once together and separately. Someone to his right had lost a game of cards, judging by the swearing.
To his credit, Benny didn't take it personally. It's just that there is a type of people, even some sort of subspecies. The type who averts his eyes when asked where he comes from and cracks jokes when someone else's eyes accidentally catch the outlines of scars on his wrists under his sleeves.
He looked up from his shoes and examined a group of soldiers a few feet from him - everything about them screamed "military" starting from flashy stripes and posture to drunken their jargon, Dean could recognize the time from a mile away. Those are already drunk to the brim. That means they already left their money elsewhere. Too bad.
"My name is Castiel Milton", Dean, unable to resist, looked at Milton, and he only smiled slightly. "I`m going to have to ask you to come with me to the station."
"Information," Dean said shortly, sounding almost indifferent as if he wasn't the one asking for a favor here. God only knows how much he hates asking them.
Dean was ready to strangle Benny with his bare hands for leaving him to deal with the detective alone. But, to be fair and in circumstances directly opposite, he would have done the same.
This is, in fact, the only thing worth saying when describing Meg as a person, if she is a person at all.
The word is rare, and it would be appropriate only in letters written by hand. Letters to loved ones and dear ones, teasing and completely serious. A brief "I promise I won't stab you in the back at the first opportunity." Presenting your own carved heart on a porcelain tray with the words "Please".
"I know," she shrugged elegantly. "Although, rather, more heard about him. A decent guy. Grew up in the local church, since childhood was brainwashed to become a priest. Maybe the plan would have passed. If it wasn't for the war of course – and there you know, everyone's plans for life would have fucking collapsed, not just plans. He got into the army, by some miracle became a captain at the age of twenty – I don't know who he had to sleep with or cut whose throat. There is a sister who, unlike him, has achieved something in the church. Despite his success and popularity in army circles, he returned home in the winter of 1945 after mysterious events about which I could not dig up anything. But you know, so far I was driven by one curiosity. If I had a real motivation…"
And he only smiled - Dean couldn't exactly see its outlines on his face but Dean felt it, the buzzing under his skin and barely recognizable tone in his voice when he said:
“Lucifer has Sam.” Dean said. “He has Jack. Cas! I don’t have a choice!” Castiel didn’t say anything. Dean was right and he knew it. There was no other option. Dean turned back to Michael. “If we do this, it’s a one time deal. I’m in charge. You’re the engine but I’m behind the wheel. Understand?”
He relaxed physically, but he was screaming at himself not to start calling again. It’d turn into a fucking mess if he did, and a Winchester mess was infamous for being hard to clean back up. Pieces were always missing, loose ends always remained untied. Dean was probably the guiltiest of all the people in his family for this. But screw it- he had saved the world, what 5 times now? 6? The tension in his mind fell away when he let his shoulders drop and took deeper breaths, following all the motions of calming down, even closing his eyes.
It was quiet out. Of course it was- Dean was sat on top of the impala, beer in hand, all alone. He’d driven himself out to a little clearing he’d found in the woods some time ago, a little over a mile from the bunker. Sam had been breathing down his neck all week about something, what it was exactly he still hadn’t fully figured out- all he knew was that it was annoying the hell out of him. He needed an escape. So after half an hour of Sam bugging him over something or other, Dean stormed out and took Baby on a drive to the most peaceful place he could find, hoping to clear his thoughts.
On the sixth day, Cas started doubting what he’d learned the other day. He looked down to see his legs were fading in and out of existence in sections, just like his trench coat had done. He would be lying if he said he didn’t start panicking a little bit. Or a lot.
“Right.” Dean faced Cas again and leaned in, their foreheads touching. “I’ll be back soon. I promise.”
“Hey Cas, uhh.” Dean looked to the side. Now really wasn’t the time to get nervous about this. Now was the time for getting nervous about killing archangels. Or becoming an archangel. But not this. “Look I know I said I would be back- and I will- but in the very unlikely event that I don’t… there’s something I want to do.”
Dean dropped his hand, and it hurt a bit. Michael looked more than amused by the sappiness of their situation. They were kissing each other goodbye and proclaiming their love because they didn’t know if they’d ever see each other again, but of course neither of them wanted to admit that this could be their last chance to say anything. It was a cheesy chick flick moment, just less chicks and more dick angels. Next time either of them saw each other, Dean might not even be Dean. Just an archangel walking around in his body.
“What? She was hot.” Dean shrugged. He picked up the bottle Cas had returned to the cupholder and looked inside to see if there was anything left. There wasn’t. He set it back down, disappointed.
“And what’s that supposed to mean, hmm?” Dean raised an eyebrow in an attempt to brush off whatever Castiel thought was going on.
Dean took the entire box of nachos and held it close to him, closing himself off. He wasn’t pouting anymore, and he didn’t look childish. He looked almost sad. The nachos, however, looked delicious, and from the way Dean was stuffing them down his throat, Cas would have to act fast if he wanted anything for himself. He reached over quickly and almost stole a few, but Dean tried to move them away. In the end, Cas ended up knocking the box of nachos away. They went flying, getting all over the front seats of the impala.
“Oh, god, I thought you were gone,” he said, his speech airy. It sounded like he was taking his first breath in months.
“But I was?” Dean shrugged in response. “Then why do you regret me? If you were calling out to me, asking me to come to you and keep you company, why do you say you think of me as a mistake?”
By eleven that same night, the splotches had moved up to his hips and he no longer had visible feet. Cas had probably sped up the process by pacing around the hallway in a panic, trying to find a way out of this. Nothing came to mind.
“I did not start a fight!” he snapped back, curling up into a little pout. He was like an angry little child who’d just been told he couldn’t get candy because he’d hit another kid. Stubborn and prideful. Dammit, it was adorable.
Castiel returned ten minutes later, with two bottles of beer and a serving of nachos with extra cheese from the 7-Eleven around the corner. Dean had moved over to the passenger seat. Great. Drunk driving and car crashes were exactly what Cas had been looking forward to that night.
‘Who cares, not like I can even get drunk anymore anyway,’ Dean thought, compulsively taking a swig from his bottle to prove it to himself.
“Oh.” Dean’s grip on his arm loosened for a moment. A second later it tightened again, shocking Castiel a bit. Apparently Dean wasn’t done. “Just to clarify- who were you jealous of? Me or the girl?”
Everything up to his shoulders, with the exception of most of his right arm, but it was so covered in the splotches it looked he had some weird disease.
They kept kissing, Dean dropping Cas’ wrist so he could hold his head with both of his hands. Cas, personally, had never felt better. He couldn’t even remember how long he had been thinking about doing this, Dean’s lips against his. Everything outside of the impala was unimportant to them. Cas was too busy relishing in the joy of his years of wishing finally coming true- Dean was too busy taking Cas’ coat off of him and tossing it in the backseat once again.
It was just as amazing as Dean had dreamed. Better, even. They melted into each other, fitting together perfectly. The kiss wasn’t long, but when they pulled away they were both already craving more. Just one more. But they couldn’t. Dean could hear his cell phone ringing from inside the car, likely Sam calling him to question his whereabouts.
That was when he realized Dean was still holding his hand. Dean clearly wasn’t aware. He was staring wide-eyed at Cas like it was the first time they’d met. As the color returned to his eyes, Dean smiled wide and pulled Cas into a tight hug.
“Dean, I could write three pages worth of all the dumb crap you’ve done tonight and would probably still have more to say.”
“Cas, not now.” Dean shook his head. He clenched his fists, trying to summon up the courage to say what he needed to say.
The fifth day, Cas began to wonder if he really was a ghost. He spent the day trying to summon the energy to push things over- anything. The random knick knacks on Dean’s dresser, the salt shakers in the kitchen, even the pillow propping his (real) head up, but nothing seemed to work. When he tried to touch anything, his hand would become transparent, fading back to opaque a few seconds after he would move his hand away. By seven that evening he felt just the same as before, if not a bit more frustrated at the situation. No reaper had ever come for him, and the Empty was nowhere in sight. At least he knew he wasn’t dead.
Dean looked down at his beer. He had one other remaining, and now this bottle was almost empty itself. His flask was in the glove compartment; maybe he could use getting it as an excuse to both get even more drunk as well as to get away from the interrogations of the angel next to him. No, it wasn’t worth it. Dean knew how it would go. Cas would leave him alone, for now, only to run off and tell Sam that Dean was busy being upset again. And then they would try to get him to talk about it, he would say no and run off again or divert the subject, and the three of them would be left in the same positions they were in just before Cas had showed up behind him. He could let that happen like it had a million times before. It was just as routine as Dean drinking (or dying. Take your pick, Dean was okay with both).
Silence. The only sound was of the wind passing through the leaves of the trees, blowing the occasional reds and oranges down to the earthy forest floor below. Did he dare break it? Dean finally looked up and met Castiel’s eyes. Even in the darkness of the night, the moonlight still reflected in his blue eyes. Dean could drown in those sea colored eyes and he would be perfectly content with it. He was faced with the same moral dilemma as before. Was what he’d just said enough for now? He could just lock himself back up in his own mind if he so pleased.
“This is it. No more after this, okay?” he said as he slid into the passenger seat. Again, Dean didn’t do anything but nod distantly and take one of the beers straight from the angel’s hand. Cas sighed as Dean forced it open and drank it like it was the first drink he’d had in 7 days. He still had the other bottle in his hand. He still couldn’t get drunk but he cracked it open anyway and took a sip. Cas never really got why Dean liked the bitter taste so much. Maybe his grace-enhanced senses were just getting in the way.
“I’m not a fake psychic, Dean.” Cas said. Dean sometimes hated Metatron more than usual for giving Cas the ability to understand his references- it took away the fun of seeing the angel’s confusion when Dean did it. “I can actually read your thoughts. I do know when you’re calling for me.”
Dean, of course, didn’t hear a word. He was still sitting at the desk, pouring over books about ghosts. He looked like he was going to pass out at any second.
“The apocalypse.” he continued, trying to pull himself out of him lonely slump.  “Ben and Lisa. “Another apocalypse.  Our little roll in the mud with Crowley. Being a demon in general…and-”
At least Dean was having a good time. Cas looked over to where his friend was. He was dancing up against a girl, beer in hand, clearly pleased with his current situation. It would be no surprise if Dean forgot about Cas when he decided to drive him and his dance partner to the nearest vacant motel room to spend the night. Again.
Cas would have told Sam that he felt far from fine, but after spending the entire first day shouting and trying to wreck auditory havoc, he’d learned that no one could hear him. Dean reluctantly left the room and got food, but brought his plate and beer with him, because he “wanted to be there when Cas woke up.”
“Dean, you do know I can read your thoughts when you’re calling for me, right?” Well there went that plan.
The entire bar seemed to freeze. Hell, someone even turned off the music as everyone turned to look at Dean. The guy who he’d bumped into was glaring at Dean like he was ready to rip his face off. Once Dean got back on his feet, he was sending the same expression back.
The morning of the fourth day, Sam came in once again with some more food. Dean groaned when he felt the crook in his neck.
“Y’know, you really should think things through before you get into trouble.” Cas said as he slid Dean a plate of nachos and took one for himself. “You shouldn’t be so impulsive.”
Sadly, without the insane barking coming from his younger brother to distract him, Dean was thinking more than he had wanted to. He had come out here to relax and get himself together, not become a sad little crap. He had almost gone to a bar to drink his worries away, but he knew that that was the first place Sam would have looked for him. He was an alcoholic, not stupid. So instead, he drove to his private clearing and drank there.
“About holy comas?” Sam said. “No. But I did find some apple pie in the fridge. Eat something and calm down. Cas will be fine.”
“I’m not impulsive.” Dean muttered as he took a chip and shoved it in his mouth. He knew Castiel was right, he was just too prideful to admit it. “Not my fault the guy can’t watch where he’s going.”
Dean jumped at the sound of the voice behind him, almost falling off the roof of the impala and crashing onto the pile of broken bottles below. He turned, fingering his gun, which tucked safely into his belt, ready to blow out the friggin’ brains out of whoever had almost just gotten him killed, or at least left him with a couple more scars.
But in all of his millions of years of living, he had never been put in a situation where he was standing in a bedroom staring down at his own body. He’d honestly never expected it to happen and, naturally, had never prepared himself for it.
