He needs to lift his arm towards the handle. He needs to uncurl his fist. He needs to stop standing in the kitchen like a moron.
What does that even mean? Cas’s justifiable arrogance? Dean’s? What does that have to do with Blackpink?
have a type. Dean knows that Cassie and Cas are two extremely different people, but he’s struggling to explain it.
Visiting the shelters had been a bust, too. No one could identify the missing men. Eileen only had photos of two of the six recovered victims' faces. The others had been too busted up to identify. Combined, the details merely told Eileen what she’d already known: whatever they’re hunting is smart.
So, yeah. Things have been fine. Things have been normal. Cas and Sam and Dean have been teaching Jack human things. Dean and Jack go fishing, or driving without talking because Dean is useless, but Jack seems to like it. Dean's planning on teaching the kid how to grill next weekend. A bunch of people are coming through. Sam suggested it as a way to let everyone know that they were welcome at the bunker, and to float the idea of installing a hunter network for real this time, but Dean knew it was just a very elaborate way to get Eileen to come over.
The atmosphere shifts immediately. “What is it? Everyone okay?” Dean leans forward, ready to spring up and go.
Dean searches for the right flower to respond with, but he’s frustrated to find that there either isn’t a flower meaning “congratulations,” or else he’s not searching for it correctly.
“If it’s not bad,” Patience says, looking up at Dean, not even trying to hide the tears slipping down her cheeks. “If it’s not, then why can’t he — why doesn’t he —”
A whisper of tell-tale fluttering, and then Cas — whose eyes are a shining blue, so much sharper and brighter than the lake — stands before him. “Dean.” He says in greeting, and Dean enjoys how it sounds.
makes him think of the brief moments in all the shitty idiotic plans they’d made when they realized they were actually, somehow, going to win. Plus, Dean imagines Cas, earnest and deadly serious, saying
“I know.” And Cas had smiled — happy, content — and Dean couldn't see anything but black and black and black.
When he’s able to listen to it without his breath fighting him, he pulls out the papers. He rubs his fingers over their slightly glossy texture, contemplating lighting both on fire and lying to Cas — saying they got lost, caught in some kind of crosshairs.
“Jeez, I'm sorry! If I'd known you were going to find out about them, I'd have left them in your bed.” Dean weirdly thinks that would be preferable. He doesn't like having a dirty kitchen. It's reasonable, he thinks, to do your dishes as soon as possible. You never know when you're going to end up on the road for 2 weeks, and mold is the MOST disgusting thing they've ever fought.
Ah. That's such a reasonable question, given how often they've traipsed in and out of Hell on errands since Jack was around. Heck, after Jack came back, they had to pop into Hell because Rowena demanded to see the Darling Boy. Jack and Cas visit her sometimes. Dean actually tries not to think about it. Their lives are notably different now from when all this started.
Dean lets the song slide away as he pulls into the garage. He busies himself with putting the groceries away and lets the lyrics rattle in his head. He thinks
Eileen tries not to think about dying, since she doesn’t enjoy torturing herself. She tries not to think about Hell either, but that’s easier somehow. Something about how Sam built her new body blurred her memories of Hell, the amount of time too vast and too foreign for her new brain. Maybe it’s good, old-fashioned repression. Whatever it is, it works for her.
When Dean pulled back he smiled, a little shaken but glowing nonetheless. “Who knew, maybe I am strictly into dick now” he laughed, but Cas looked confused.
“His name is Crowley” Cas muttered looking down at the aquatic bird thing. Dean let out a snort as he held out his hand to pet him. Cas gave him a look of warning but Dean didn’t seem to notice, or if he did he didn’t care.
“I have nothing left, Castiel. My psyche is shot to shit. I completed my life long goals and I still feel like garbage, Sam is taken care of, and free will or not I have never felt more alone.” Dean didn’t realize his fragile state would lead to the break in the floodgates of built up emotion he had been repressing for far too long. “It doesn’t matter anyway, I don’t know why I’m telling you, I’m sure you’re just another fucked up thing my head created to try and help out.” He mumbled that last part, almost embarrassed of expressing himself.
Castiel watched as Dean tried to process his words. He looked so confused, so scared. Cas wished he could reassure him, but he knew he couldn’t keep rambling on. The feeling that engulfed his stomach and body was so freeing, it was though he had allowed for the weight of the world to be lifted off his shoulders. Cas would be whisked off to the empty and that was okay.
“Oh but it is.” Sam didn’t sound like himself, he sounded like he was possessed or entranced something, but it couldn’t have been him. “They’re both dead. I’m alone, and I can’t blame anyone but you Cas. It’s your fault. Your fault.” The phrase your fault seemed to echo in his mind as Cas bit his cheek to hold back any sobs that seemed to rise in his throat.
“Woah there, pizza man, why don’t we revisit this later, Sam and Eileen are waiting on us.” Dean let out a short laugh as Cas pulled away, ashamed but completely elated at the same time. When Dean and Cas had finally left the room (after maybe one more kiss, teenage desperation style) Sam and Eileen were sitting at the table smirking.
“A man of simple taste doesn’t change much does he.” Dean smiled, it was meant to come off as a joke, but something in his tone read a bit more somber. Cas noticed this too, but he just nodded rather than address it. Time would heal all wounds, at least that what Dean had hoped. The younger man cleared his throat, choosing to continue the game rather than address the unspoken tension. “Question 5 when was the last time you sang, to yourself and to someone else.” Cas actually cracked a smile for this one.
Everything had managed to work out just as it was meant to. Cas was back, and alive grace and everything. Jack, the optiminent, popped in and out for Bible sesh’s and beer nights. Sam had Eileen, who despite how classy the two may seem, were definitely not so reserved at night, to Deans despair. Yes everything was just as it was supposed to be. laughing and talking, the four, and occasional five (six if you counted miracle) reveling in the defeat of Chuck, and the start of a new world.
Dean's response is to pull Cas on top of him and wrap his hand around Cas' dick while he kisses him hard, biting his bottom lip. "What're you waiting for?" he asks when they pull apart.
"Nah," Dean exhales. There's one or two pulls left on this joint, maybe a couple more if he makes them small. "Alcohol is more like...lights out, see ya tomorrow. This stuff— it makes bein' awake nicer. Like right now...everythin's soft."
ii. it is your last day of being sixteen years old. you look at the boy working reception at the motel. he has kind eyes and it makes your bones feel warm.
In the greenhouse, a smile pulls at the corners of his mouth at the scene in front of him; Cas, holy warrior and aeons-old being, gently handling the only plant that survived the scuffle. He's covered in blood that's not his and Dean can make out the handle of his blade in his coat pocket.
Dean's been on either end of shotgunning before— he knows lips don't need to touch when you do it, knows Cas could have just formed a tunnel with his hands instead, but he's finding it difficult to bring himself to care. Cas fists his hand through his shirt and half-climbs into his lap and he's loose and lazy about it like they've got all the time in the world.
"Shit," Dean swears, awkwardly climbing out from Cas' lap. "Hey, Sammy," he says into his phone when he finally finds it.
ii. you pull him out of the void and into your bed. you listen to his prayers when you get on your knees and you do some praying of your own when he takes you apart and puts you back together again.
A day and a half later, Dean watches Cas walk to his death for his future self like it's the easiest thing he's ever done.
"How was the job?" Sam asks over breakfast the morning after they get back — they'd pulled into the bunker in the middle of the night and tiptoed inside trying not to wake him up.
"I bet he wouldn't do this," he breathes into Dean's ear, and when Dean turns their faces are only apart for a short moment before Cas takes another hit of the joint and presses his lips to Dean's open mouth to exhale the smoke there.
Cas smiles. "About four jars." He sets the container down on Dean’s desk and looks up at him. "I didn't expect such a big harvest, but I guess I underestimated how much it would grow."
"Asshole," Cas shakes his head, but he's smiling. "I found a 'smoke shop' in Salina. After he saw me looking at them, the shop owner practically handed me this one."
And the thing is Dean wouldn't let anyone else talk his ear off about grow lights and fertilising and watering schedules. But he loves the way Cas' eyes light up when he's detailing his latest project while he listens and asks a question here and there over breakfast or a while he nurses a beer. He likes to watch him work too, the way Cas' brow furrows when he's focused.
Cas smiles the most understanding smile in the world, and Dean kind of wants to punch him in the face for it. "I understand. Get some rest and talk to your brother. I'm sure I'll see you soon."
ii. he prays to you between the trees and you hear what he isn't saying. each time you embrace each other it gets harder for you to let go.
"C'mon," Dean breathes, reaches for Cas and pulls him in close. He's arching his back and his eyes are boring into Cas. The way he bares his neck when Cas twists his wrist while he's fingering him is enough to convince him to let his grace do the rest of the job. He sinks his teeth into Dean's neck in a way that makes them both shiver, tastes sweat and soap and cologne and the familiar hint of a soul he knows down to the marrow.
"More than okay," Cas smiles. "It's just..." he bites his bottom lip before he speaks again, and for a second Dean worries that he's ruined everything, but then— "can I shotgun you?"
He's just about to kiss Cas again after catching his breath when a hand on his chest stops him. "Everything okay?" Dean asks.
"I think about building a cabin in the woods. How some of the trees there are over a thousand years old. I think about how even though I had lived a lifetime by the time those trees were seedlings, it feels like we were so young the last time we were there." He pauses as if he's looking for his words. "I think about how I knew what I wanted then, but the picture is clearer now."
For a second Cas looks like he's considering it, then he says, "I suppose," and Dean figures he doesn't have enough weed left to teach Cas how to smoke properly without having to roll another joint and he feels too high to do that, right now, so he shuffles closer to him instead.
The angle is awkward at first with them sitting side by side but then Cas grabs at the front of his shirt and pulls Dean into his lap, and Dean lets out a low, wanting noise from the back of his throat. It's been years since anybody's grabbed him like this outside of a fight; on the rare occasions Dean's gone out of his way to get laid in the past few years people have just assumed he'd be the one doing the throwing around. And he doesn't mind, not always, but  Cas' hands on him are just what he's been aching for and he's dizzy with it.
vii. when you light the pyre you pour his favourite whiskey on it. you know he'd hate to see you waste it. you watch the flames grow angry just like he was.
It's the same voice he's using now, locking eyes with him, and he's such a sight with Cas' dick thrusting into his mouth, his cheeks hollowing out while sweat starts to bead at his temples. "You've missed this," Cas says between thrusts. Dean's response comes in the form of a choked-out moan muffled by Cas hitting the back of his throat. The way his vocal cords vibrate with it ripples through Cas, his grip in Dean's hair tightening. "Dean—" he starts, cuts himself off with a moan when Dean pulls him in even closer, grabs his hips hard enough to bruise.
viii. he looks back at you standing inside a ring of holy fire and you want to sink to your knees in front of him in prayer, regret, apology, desire.
ii. you've seen him die before but this is the first time you admit to yourself that you're a coward.
Cas quirks his eyebrow at him; "this?" he has the nerve to ask like he doesn't know what Dean's talking about.
"Fuck," Cas lets out, and it always does things to him when he swears but especially now that the high is hitting him again and he can taste Cas' skin on his tongue and Dean moans in response.
Cas comes inside him with a snap of his hips and he doesn't pull out when he reaches between them to wrap a hand around Dean; he moves his fist in ragged, desperate pulls, rests their foreheads together. "I love you too," he breathes, inches from Dean's mouth. "you are, without question, the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in this world."
xiv. the angel throws you into a fence in a back alley and it feels like a kiss. you chase his fists and hope he touches you more, more, more. when you look up at him from down on your knees you feel like taking communion.
v. you grieve for him like a widower even though you don't think you deserve to. you finally get the scope of you and him and it engulfs you.
xv. you try the apple pie life but you feel empty. you figure maybe you're just not meant to have a family and your hands have shed too much blood to be gentle.
It feels like it goes on forever and Dean can tell Cas is getting high when he pulls away, sees the dopey smile on his face. "Dean," Cas breathes, pulling him closer.
There's a pause and Dean rolls down the window. "Of course. See ya tomorrow," he tells Sam, and then he hangs up.
"Nah," he adds, moves a hand from Cas' back to the back of his neck. "'s true. There's no o— nothing like this." He pulls Cas into a searing, deep kiss, licks into his mouth like his life might depend on it, and Cas cups his face with his right hand. Dean's left palm comes up to rest against the back of Cas', layered on top of the handprint.
So when he gets handed an unlit, expertly-rolled joint in a shitty cabin in Camp Chitaqua, it's not that he's intimidated. It's more the fact that his future self (according to Zachariah, anyway) is sitting across the room from him, holding a beer and cleaning his guns in the exact same way he does, with his process and weird techniques and tricks. Seeing himself from the outside is a way trippier experience than any amount of pot, Dean thinks.
"Unless you wanna—" Cas takes the head of his dick into his mouth and swirls his tongue around it, drags precum down the rest of Dean's cock with his tongue. "Fuck—"
Dean pulls on the joint and inhales what's left of it, opens the window just enough to flick it outside before he rolls it back up, and when he turns around he puts his mouth right on Castiel's and exhales. He knows lips don't need to touch when you do it just like he did five years from now.
They're quiet for a long time in the aftermath. Cas rolls over onto his back and breathes hard even though he doesn't technically need to— something he picked up when he was human. Dean is boneless once he's cleaned them up like he always is after sex and Cas understands why he used to use sex as a coping mechanism; it knocks him right out. He sprawls out on his front and holds a pillow to his face. He doesn't have to tell Cas he can stay. They're used to it, to falling asleep together but not necessarily waking up next to each other.
For the first time in his life, Dean buys his own weed. Cas doesn’t get it, not really, but– well. It’s almost comforting to see him be clueless about it, sat next to him in the backseat. He’s doing that thing where Dean can tell he’s studying him, not judging but definitely cataloguing him.
"Yeah, I mean it's about as big as your head," Dean gestures with his coffee mug, to which Sam rolls his eyes. "I guess it's legal in Colorado so people are growing it."
He grabs Cas' wrist and takes his fingers out of his mouth, wipes his spit on his chin. "Cas," he croaks out, then, halfway into a moan, "please."
"I guess so," Cas sighs a little bit as he gets up from the floor, more from the balancing act of holding the plant than from any physical effort. "it may have survived all this but it's looking a little worse for wear and I'm confident I could care for it." The plant is fairly young still: there are about four or five leaves growing from it and it's banged up but it looks like it'll survive.
He's felt tense all day in a way that he hasn't been able to kick with the adrenaline rush that comes with hunting and it had been all too easy to find a dive and buy the information about the local plug with a smile in a fuck it spur-of-the-moment decision. Which is how he ended up here, parked in some isolated alley with an angel watching him dig out a gas station lighter to light a joint.
Dean's legs wrap around his waist tight when Cas kisses him and they moan in each other's mouths, close and intense. Cas slows his rhythm then, starts thrusting slower and deeper into him, and when they pull away from kissing his left hand finds Dean's left shoulder, rests on the raised handprint mark he left there a decade ago.
"I love you," Dean lets out in between two thrusts. It's been building up in his chest for years, taking root like an evergreen tree burrowing deep in the soil of his life.
Being high makes Dean feel like every sensation is amplified tenfold, he knows this, but he surprises himself at how loud he moans when Cas fingers him— he's always been loud but he didn't know he had these sounds in him anymore, and when Cas twists his wrist at a particular angle and hits his prostate dead on over and over and over, unrelenting, he comes with a scream that's only muffled by Cas' shoulder against his face.
“You know, some of the lore I was reading last night talked about creating church grims by burying the dog’s body under the foundation stones of the church,” Sam noted.  “What the hell do we do then? Borrow a backhoe?”
As she strutted away, Sam leaned in and whispered, “I’m not hallucinating this, right?  We’re in a bar full of Fairies?”
But Cas knew he was there even before he said anything.  “You know, I remember when the moon was captured by Earth’s gravity.  It was magnificent.  Even now, with my vision limited to human perceptions, it’s quite beautiful.  I can understand why so many human societies thought the moon was worthy of worship,” she mused.
When Dean asked for sewer system maps, however, the overly helpful desk clerk suddenly turned cold, insisting that those maps were not available to the public.  “Homeland Security directive, you know,” she explained with a thin-lipped smile.
“Not according to Wendell.  He said the dog ran off as soon as it heard the police sirens,” Sam explained with a shake of his head.  “Witness testimony is always pretty unreliable, especially when it’s from a victim, but he was really clear it was a dog or wolf of some kind – fur, four feet, fangs, the whole nine yards.  So, despite the attack happening at a full moon, it’s definitely not a werewolf.”
The last thing they needed was someone telling the same people covering up the green lady’s murders exactly where they were searching for her.  Gritting his teeth against the urge to give the clerk a piece of his mind, Dean thanked her and told her not to worry, he’d let his boss deal with it.
Again, she was thoughtful and took her time.  “No, I’m sorry, that doesn’t ring any bells at all.”  She pulled off her glasses and wiped the tear streaks from the lenses.  “Wait . . .  a few months ago, Matt joined a darts league.  They played out of a pub in Belchamp but I don’t remember which one.  I never went with him because I teach a late class on the night they play.”
Hwang lowered his voice to a whisper.  “This is a good town.  A real good town.  Moved here when I got out of the Marines because after six years in the sandbox I wanted a quiet, green place.  I’ve been happy here.  I don’t want to lose that.”
Sam agreed that there was something unusual about this kill, if it really was a vampire.  He consulted the coroner’s preliminary report.  One thing jumped out at him immediately.  “There’s no sign that this guy was subdued before he was sliced and drained.  No rope marks or restraint marks, no bash on the head, no defensive wounds.  The tox screen is still out for analysis, so I guess the cops are thinking drugs.”
before Dean had de-railed things with references to Boris Karloff movies. It was also nice to be able to avoid sitting through Dean’s favorite movies or favorite albums for the thousandth time without a scrap of guilt. Now Dean could inflict them on Cas instead.
“Sam,” Dean protested.  If this was another “you and Cas should hook up” hint, he was going to punch his brother, regardless of his broken head.
“You – you’re right. I should have talked to you.  But you had already sacrificed so much,” Cas said, painfully quiet but still loud enough for Dean to hear.  “I couldn’t be the one to ask more from you.  I – I - just couldn’t.  I was trying to – to – protect you.”
“Because we’re going undercover at a pub and you’re dressed like an FBI nerd.  You’ll stand out,” Dean said.  “You don’t want to give us away to what we’re hunting.”
Dean was sleeping on the couch, curled on his side so his legs fit.  They’d argued over that twice now.  In this new body, she was shorter and smaller and could sleep (or more likely not sleep) comfortably on the couch, while the king-sized bed in the master bedroom fit Dean’s larger frame.  But Dean had insisted that he’d slept in worse places and that she deserved the extra comfort of a proper bed while she was still adjusting to being human and needing sleep.  Rather than being helpful, Sam had simply shrugged in amused exasperation at his brother’s stubbornness.
“You don’t have to, you know.  You could stick with the research and still be a huge help on hunts,” he noted, giving her the choice that he’d never been given.
Ada considered carefully, looking to Father Pederson.  Wordlessly, they came to a decision.  “I don’t see why you couldn’t look through our records,” Father Pederson said.
“Wait, is that . . . Ogham?” Sam broke in, running his fingertips over the warding marks and peering at them closely.  “Cas, this is amazing, you
“We’d like to see current investigation files on the Boddicker, Stupak, Nesbitt and Ponca homicides, please.  It would also be helpful to talk to Detective Drummond,” Sam asked.
She heard him, she understood him, but it seemed too facile, too simple by far.  Shouldn’t she hurt more for all the evil she’d done?  “Dean, if I don’t have a soul, what’s the point of it all?  If I don’t have a soul, I can’t possibly –“
“Humans have souls, Dean,” she explained, regret and sadness forming a tight lump in her chest.  “Creatures with souls can be redeemed.  They can atone and be forgiven.  Angels don’t have souls.  We can’t be redeemed.  Like Lucifer.”
“Whatever you think is best, Dean,” Cas said, the overtones of ‘please go away’ painfully clear.  Dean knew how to deal with Castiel warrior Angel of the Lord, he knew how to fight with Cas, he knew how to deal with angry Cas, but he had no idea how to deal with sad, broken, human Cas, so he left her alone and went shopping.
“Yeah, well, that was when you were an angel.  And a dude.  You haven’t been renting this meat suit for all that long and you don’t know how it will react.”  Dean used his best “I’m the big brother and I know better” voice, even though it only worked on Sam about half the time these days.  Cas grumbled at him but didn’t argue.  So point Dean.  “Just promise you’ll call if you need anything at all,” he insisted.
The waiter, a tall white kid of maybe nineteen who was over-eager to please, glanced at the fliers when he brought them their food.  “Green Lady.  Cool place,” he volunteered.
Perhaps, if the angel way of doing things no longer worked, a human way might.  She knelt beside the couch and laid a hand on Dean’s arm, right at the spot where she had left her mark when she dragged him out of Hell.  “Dean, it’s just a dream.  None of it is real.  Let it go,” she whispered.  He flinched.  “Dean,” she repeated as gently as she could, “it’s all right.  I’m here.  I’ll protect you.”  It sounded foolish, ridiculous almost, coming out of her graceless human mouth, but she said it anyway, hoping that Dean’s dream logic would remember her as an angel.
The clerk gave a critical once-over to his badge and ID, then adjusted her glasses along the bridge of her sharp nose.  “Well, I just don’t know. Chief Ramsey was very insistent about keeping that sort of information out of the wrong hands.  Maybe I should call him and check that it’s okay.”
, and how they might be combatted.  Castiel felt proud of what she’d done today.  It felt surprisingly soothing to be given an assignment and accomplish it.  It felt almost as if she were herself again, a good soldier who was good at her job.
“Yeah, yeah, black bean burger and leaves,” Dean assured him, settling comfortably into their familiar rhythms.  He browsed through the cabinets and refrigerator to see what they had to work with for supplies.  He found the coffee maker – thank God – and the coffee, plus some stinky herbal tea and a nicely stocked liquor cabinet, but very little in the way of edible food.  There was some canned soup, a couple boxes of pasta and rice, a moldy loaf of bread, expired milk, and some leftovers in the ‘fridge that were busy mutating into something that would probably need silver or iron to kill.  No surprise.  No one had actually lived here since the Swanson family had their accident.  “I’m going to pick up some other stuff too.  The cupboard’s pretty bare here and this might take a few days.”
Sam offered up his most sympathetic expression as he and Dean flashed their badges. “Mrs. Ponca?  I’m Agent Gillan, this is my partner Agent Blackmore and our expert consultant, Professor Glover.  We’d like to ask you a few questions about your son John’s death.”
The hospital community room was large and airy enough to let Dean take a full breath without feeling like he wanted to puke.  It also had one of those fancy pod coffee machines that made much better coffee than the usual hospital sludge.  Dean picked the closest thing he could find to ordinary plain coffee, no fancy flavors or weird names, and drank it black.  The vending machine contained only drinks, but he grabbed a packet of crackers from the basket next to the coffee machine and let the food and hot drink work their magic.  Stupid to get all worked up like this over a smell, he thought.  He was going to have to get over this thing frickin’ quick because hospitals were a constant part of the hunting life.  He couldn’t stick Sam with every single victim interview in a hospital.
And there it was at last: Castiel the warrior angel, the Cas who stood up to archangels, the Cas who could go toe-to-toe with Dean himself in what Bobby used to call “sheer cussed stubbornness.”  But Dean knew better than anyone what went along with that kind of courage and determination.  He sipped his bourbon and searched for the right words.  He settled on just okay words.  “Just don’t . . . ya know, don’t pay everything.  I like having you alive.”
The morning was soon enough to deal with Sam’s hallucinations, life insurance money, Leviathans, and every other damn thing.  He had his brother.  He had his best friend.  It wasn’t perfect.  But it was good enough.  He’d figure out the rest when he had to.
Dean pulled out his phone and dialed Ada Beach’s number.  “Ms. Beach.  Yes, this is Agent Peart.  I’ve found a consultant who reads Swedish. . . . Yes, we can come back first thing in the morning tomorrow.  Thank you.”  He put down the phone and shot Cas a broad grin.  “There ya go.  Tomorrow morning you are an official fake FBI consultant.”
After more deliberately rambling questions, Father Pederson had nothing to add to Ada’s information about dog attacks or church history.  Dean ran through all the usual ghost hunting questions, but neither Father Pederson nor Ada admitted to any cold spots, unusual noises, moving objects, or anything else that might indicate a ghost.  They’d never smelled sulfur or noticed anything amiss in their nice, quiet old church.  In fact, they both reported feeling safe and secure in the church and on the church grounds no matter how late they worked.
Well, it only took 10 months for me to get my fiction-writing mojo back.  I apologize to everyone patient enough to wait for this.
“Dean, Sam, more than half these people are Fairies of some kind.”  Cas sounded strangely unnerved, but Dean didn’t have time for that right now.
Cas ducked her eyes and fussed with dumping crackers into her tomato soup.  “You’re going to need to lie to the police and you know that I’m not any good at that.  I don’t want to make a mess of things for you.”
By the time Dean and Sam returned to the hotel, Castiel had finished carving the warding.  After that, between them, she and Maisie had compiled an array of confirmable facts about Fairies,
The dog was huge and black.  Jason Erickson had called it a Rottweiler on steroids.  He wasn’t wrong.  It reminded Dean uncomfortably of a hellhound, only its eyes were electric blue instead of fiery red.  It didn’t growl or fuss.  It simply stood there, looking at each of them in turn, waiting.
Cas was quiet, her hands folded on the record room table, looking at Dean.  This was his cue, if he was going to take it.  “Hey, let’s take some time and think whether there’s another way to handle this short of a backhoe,” he suggested.  At Sam’s look of surprise, he added, “Look, we’re not on the clock.  The grim has only attacked people twice since 18-frickin’-41.  We’ve got time to be creative.”
“It could be a kyrkogrim.  In old Scandinavian tradition, at the founding of a new church, they would kill and bury an animal, usually a dog, on church grounds to act as a guardian spirit,” Cas explained.  “I thought it was just a myth like so many other human church practices.  I had no idea it might have any real power.”
Castiel was about to dismiss the offer.  What could she possibly need to talk about that she couldn’t discuss with Dean?  Or failing that, with Sam?  Then she remembered the myriad problems of modern female clothing, and the way the brothers all but fled at any mention of menstruation, and who knows what other problems having a human female body might present that she hadn’t anticipated yet.  “You’re very kind.”
for answers as though less than a year of living on Earth as a renegade had taught me everything we needed to know.  The more they kept asking me what to do, the more I . . . I started to think that I did know the answers.  I was prideful. So very prideful.”
“I see . . . everything that I did.  Every single horrific, bloody thing.  I watch my hands kill my fellow angels.  I destroy Rafael so utterly he will never come back.  I kill humans without the slightest hesitation.  I watch myself arguing with you from inside a ring of holy fire, and I know that you are right and I want to change everything that comes after that, but I can’t.  Sometimes I dream of the Leviathans, of the feeling of suffocating in oily blackness.”  Dean could see tears starting to gather in the corners of her eyes.  “The pills make the dreams less frequent, but all of it is still there behind my eyes whenever I shut them.”
“Dean!” she said again, then threw her arms around him in a quick, awkward hug before stepping back and staring at him with a disturbing intensity.  “You got my messages!  ”
Cas pulls his fingers out of him, wipes lube off on the sheets and idly runs his hands up and down Dean's ribs, lying on his side next to him.
Cas lets out a small laugh and kisses his shoulder. "Ancient Greece, mostly," he says into Dean's skin.
Regardless, the version of Cas who's sitting next to him on the futon slash couch slash surface he definitely wouldn't want to shine a black light on takes it as a sign he is in fact intimidated.
Cas gives him an inquisitive look. "Okay," Dean repeats, not sure if it's to Cas or to himself. "I think we can do something about that." He tips his chin at the near-finished joint in his hand. "Yeah?"
Cas gives him a glare that's more fond than annoyed. It's a look Dean sees more and more these days, something Cas never did when they first met that flourished over the years, and it bowls him over every time. He watches while Cas works the grinder a few times with his fingers and thinks about Castiel, cosmic being, watching a video tutorial on it. He thinks about how Cas' hands have been bringers of destructions and miracles and now he uses them to grind weed and make shelves and water plants. Well, not always these exact hands, as Cas would probably remind him, but the point stands, regardless.
Before he can overthink it, Dean flashes his signature flirting smile and finishes rolling the joint. "Ladies first," he says when he hands it to Cas.
"Not like anybody will be coming back for it anyway," Dean tips his chin in the direction of the corpse sprawled in the corner of the room, in a pile of glass and dirt and viscera.
Sam wipes a hand across his face, exasperated, then he takes a deep breath and says, “okay,” and looks at Dean in a way that means
He's not really sure when he ends up in Cas' lap but he does, his thighs loosely bracketing Cas' hips and his arms slung over the back of the seat. Cas kisses him lazy and deep and sloppy, his hands on Dean's hips. Time, again, turns liquid.
Cas pins his wrists down on either side of his face again and leans back, leaves them there while he sits on Dean's lap. "Do I need to get the handcuffs?"
Dean half-snaps out of it when Cas shifts his weight and moves close to him, puts his right hand on Dean's knee like it's the most normal thing in the world.
Dean knows he's rambling, can hear himself talk in circles because he's high, but Cas still looks at him like he's making perfect sense.
"Should we put the mixtape on?" Cas asks while he undoes Dean's belt unceremoniously and pulls his jeans and boxers down in one smooth tug.
Not that Cas knows any of that, looking at him with a shitty flickering streetlamp reflected in his all-too-earnest blue eyes. Dean can barely take those eyes on him when he's sober; it's too much, the way Cas always looks at him like he's something worth looking at, but he's starting to feel loose from the weed and everything is softer around the edges including him, so he looks back.
"Mhm," Cas hums, and he runs his hand across his bearded chin idly. "Past me certainly wouldn't have been the type to do this."
“I like to keep it close,” Dean takes a swig of the beer that’s been cooling down on the table for half an hour and makes a face at both the temperature and the conversation. “He came into my room and he played me.”
"Off," Dean groans into his mouth with Cas' belt buckle in hand. Cas leans back on his knees, makes eye contact the whole time he undoes his belt. He rolls over to step out of his pants —he's not wearing any boxers, rarely does — and when he goes to climb back over Dean, Dean pulls him towards his face. He's hungry for it, holds Cas' hips close and wraps his mouth around him with a moan. Cas looks him in the eye and finds what Dean had once referred to as his 'fuck my face' look, so he does; he knots a hand in Dean's hair and thrusts into his mouth, rolls his hips obscenely deep.
Cas laughs and Dean feels it against his cheek. "Here's to a life of never being normal," he tells him softly, and, well, Dean can't exactly argue with that.
"Here," he offers, shuffling closer to Cas and lighting the end of the joint for him. Cas hums in response and the air feels thick before he ever breathes out any smoke.
"Soft," Cas echoes. He shifts in the backseat slightly, like he's thinking. "like the way the earth felt in the Cretaceous era. I see," he says more to himself than anything else.
He exhales into Dean's mouth and pushes him backwards until he's flat on his back, the mattress shifting when he climbs over him. Dean breathes hard, looks up at him through semi-closed eyelids and watches Cas lean in to run his right hand over his face almost reverently. His fingers come to ghost over his lips and Dean opens his mouth, sucks Cas' index and middle finger between his lips.
The rhythm they find is slow and solid, deep enough that the bed hits the wall hard on every other thrust of Cas' hips, sending various things on Dean's shelf collapsing at the same time as the both of them are, coming apart together.
Dean sits back and watches his cheeks hollow out while he takes a toke, and when he exhales he passes it back to him. They sit there in comfortable silence a while, passing it back and forth and getting pleasantly high until Dean sees the telltale signs of Cas being lost in thought.
He sits up on his bed and looks at him, at the way he's wearing a t-shirt that says 'real men make latkes' that Dean is pretty sure was a belated Chanukah joke gift and some thrifted jeans.  He keeps looking at him when Cas walks around the bed to sit next to him.
"Getting cold feet?" Cas asks, and he's looking him right in the eye the same way the Cas Dean knows always does but it feels much more intense; there's something else swirling in there that he can't really place and it makes his insides swim.
x. in the gas station mirror you don't see any of the scars he gave you. you look for every single cigarette burn and glass shard mark and don't find any of them.
"Must be that angel green thumb," Dean jokes, then he rubs at the back of his neck thinking about what they're going to do with the weed. Smoke it, obviously, but— well. Dean isn't a scared thirty-year-old anymore, he's on the wrong side of thirty-five and he's had plenty of time to get to grips with what and who he wants, but something gnaws at him about missed windows and opportunities. There's always been an excuse or a crisis trumping it, is the thing— the world ending a few times and demons and holy wars. But now, with nothing on the horizon for the next while, Dean can tell a window is opening; he's just not sure it's what Cas wants anymore.
Cas quirks an eyebrow and regards him for a second, considers it. "No, I think we could both use the stress relief." He undoes his tie, lets it fall into the sheets. The next thing Dean knows Cas is biting down on his bottom lip hard while he's working on his shirt buttons, touching every expanse of skin he can get his hands on.
Dean picked up the thread.  “The more you share with us, the sooner we’ll be out of your hair and then our report is just one more thing on our boss’s desk.”
“Then I started thinking maybe a vengeful spirit of some kind.  But the local lore about Saint Brigitta’s is all over the map, including that Indian burial ground thing, a couple stories of white ladies, the dead priest, a dead nun, and, get this, ghosts of Confederate soldiers on the run from the Union army,”  Sam continued.  He was rubbing his forehead, whether from eye strain or repeated hallucinations of Hell, Dean couldn’t tell.  Sam stood up, rolled his shoulders and shook out the tension in his neck.  He finished his beer and tossed the empty bottle in the bin labelled “Recycling.”  He looked ready for a break.
going to do anything that might fuck up that friendship.  Why is that so goddamn hard to understand?” Dean insisted, trying to keep his voice down because the last thing he wanted was Cas herself getting in the middle of this particular conversation.
While Maisie walked away to fetch the beer, Castiel caught Dean’s attention.  “I believe she knows something about our case.  She is willing to talk to us, but not here.  Tomorrow, noon, at a local church,” Castiel explained, being sure to keep her voice under the din of the music and the crowd.
I wasn’t expecting to feel Cas’s hand on my shoulder or hear the deep throb in Cas’s voice.  “Dean Winchester, you are the most wonderful, infuriating, beautiful creature in existence.”
Father Pederson chuckled ruefully.  “Well, the Berglands just had twins last month. But otherwise church attendance is going down, not up.  Every Sunday the pews seem more and more empty.  I feel like I should be doing more somehow, but I just don’t know what.”
That seemed to have the desired effect.  Maisie laughed and the fear retreated from her eyes a little.  “Then I’ll keep bringing you drinks so you stay happy,” the bartender replied.
Stunned by silver candlesticks, Dean noted.  That sure sounded like a skinwalker, but half the critters out there hated silver.  “So what did this dog look like?”
“Well, we think we’ve pieced together how to summon the church grim, and maybe how to talk to it.  I don’t know if we can re-program it, though,” Sam explained.  “If we had enough iron and salt to lay around the grave, we could probably trap it.  We might be able to re-work the binding ritual to dismiss it.  Worst comes to worst, we dig up the body and salt and burn its bones to put down the spirit.”
Castiel sighed.  “Is that another reference to a movie I’ve never seen?”  That was always a safe bet when Dean used a phrase she didn’t understand.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know where she goes when she’s not at the pub.  Somewhere near water, maybe.  The hems of her skirts are always wet.  Sorry I don’t know more.”
“Dean, I am, at the moment, ‘a chick.’ If I’m going to spend the rest of my life as a human female, shouldn’t I be at least somewhat familiar with 'chick' things?”
“Sure then.  When we get back to Minnesota, we start real hunter training.  Get you in shape to learn how to fight.”
The prim-faced white woman who sat behind the desk at the Belchamp town records office was more than willing to let the friendly FBI man with the nice smile look over anything he asked for.  By the time Sam called, Dean was sure he had looked at every single building plan, street map and spec map on file with the town of Belchamp for every building between the Green Lady pub and the river.  Unfortunately, he’d found nothing that shouted out “hiding place for killer Fairy.”  If the town records were also part of the great big Fairy conspiracy that was this stupid town, he had no idea where to go next.
“Well, it helps to be able to read the original languages,” she answered.  “I’m still downloading some better images of a couple of Pictish carved stones from an excavation in Scotland, but I’ve got enough here to confirm that yes, a
Someone who wasn’t Dean was snoring lightly and that didn’t make any sense because he knew he hadn’t gone home with anyone last night.  He should still be curled up on the couch in the Minnesota ranch house where they were crashed while they worked out things with Cas’s new life and looked for their next case.  But there was a definitely a dead weight against his chest and the softness of long hair against his hand, and those little snores sure as hell didn’t belong to his Sasquatch baby brother.  He opened his eyes slowly, inching one hand towards the gun stowed between the couch cushions, but then pulled up short.  Cas was sitting on the floor next to the couch and had fallen asleep with her head resting against his chest.
“Oh, I think you were doing a little more than just trying, weren’t you?  Throwing a little glamour into the mix, maybe?” Dean asked, dropping the pretend flirtation and reverting to pure hunter.
She ushered them in to the living room.  Based on the quality of the leather couches, the lush rug and the handmade artwork on the walls, the Poncas were doing well for themselves.  The slate mantle across the top of the fireplace was covered with elaborately-framed family photographs.  Sam examined the photos while Dean took a seat across from Mrs. Ponca.  Cas spent a few long moments looking uncertain before Dean nodded towards the other end of the couch, encouraging her to sit.
Cas must have known I was there because he opened the door the second I knocked.  “Hello Dean.  Can I help you with something?”  He had a book in his hand and had taken off the trench coat and his jacket to sit in his room and read.  Like he had been making himself comfortable.  Like this was his home.  The sight nearly made all my practiced words go out of my head.
“Yeah, yeah, road to hell, good intentions, all that,” Dean snapped back.  “You lied to us.  You lied to me, after I went to bat for you.  You fucked up Sam’s head.  How am I supposed to get past that?!”
The three of them meet in the church record room.  Cas had taken notes in neat, compact, but completely undecipherable handwriting.  A second look confirmed for Dean she’d taken notes in Enochian.  He’d have to remind her that they needed these things in English for him and Sam.
There was so much.  Being out and mingling among ordinary people, watching them go about their ordinary business and wondering for the first time what their lives were like.  The way she’d felt when she’d played pool with Dean, so happy to be sharing a thing that he enjoyed and surprised to find that she enjoyed it too, for she could not recall playing a game before.  The drunk man who’d slapped her.  Dean’s reaction.  The bartender who assumed Dean was her boyfriend.  The revelation that she wasn’t as human as she’d hoped.  The uncomfortable, incomprehensible things she’d felt watching the Fairy woman flirt with Dean and watching him flirt back.  How could she pick just one of the things churning in her head right now?  Finally, she asked, “May we get out of the car?  I need some fresh air.”
Cas gave him the head tilt, confusion written all over those big (gorgeous – nope, don’t go there, he chided himself) blue eyes.  “I don’t understand.  You slept better after I was here.  The only good night’s sleep I’ve had since becoming human was our first night in this house when you stayed with me.  If being near each other lets us both sleep without nightmares, what’s wrong with that?”
Somewhere in the middle of the third game, Dean began to notice the way Cas’s shirt rode up as she bent over the pool table, revealing just enough skin to be intriguing and reminding him how nicely those jeans hugged her ass.  He should have let her keep the damn trench coat on, he thought.  Not that the trench coat had ever stopped him from thinking things about Cas that he knew damn well he shouldn’t.  The trench coat and that sloppy tie . . .
Before they left, Dean went to check on Cas.  She was awake, sitting in a pile of blankets and pillows, alternating between drinking from the water bottle Dean had left for her and holding its cool surface against her head.  “Morning, sunshine,” Dean said, tossing her a banana.  She didn’t try to catch it, but Dean’s aim was good enough that it landed in her lap anyway.  “How’s the head?”
“I don’t hear you complaining that we’re not gonna get jumped by red caps in our sleep tonight,” Sam retorted.
, human and needing his help, could he forgive her enough to give that help?  Son of a bitch, why did these moral dilemmas always fall on him?
Fortunately, Sam had spent countless hours researching the FBI for moments just like this.  “Chief Ramsey, we are not here to step on your toes,” Sam explained in his most respectful voice, the one they’d both first learned to use on Dad when he was in a mood.  “We are here because the murders in Belchamp appear to follow a pattern that we’ve also seen in Sioux Falls and Baltimore.  If your killings do match the pattern and the profile, then this is an inter-state case and it is FBI business.  But, for now, my partner and I are just here to look, make an assessment and write a report.”
While Sam checked around the foundation for runes or inscriptions, Dean considered what Cas said last night.  Only two attacks in nearly 200 years.  He thought about Ada and Father Pederson telling him that they felt safe here no matter how late they had to work.  Maybe it wouldn’t be the worst thing if the dog’s body was somewhere they couldn’t get at it.
By the way Dean and Cas both flinched when he walked into the kitchen, Sam knew he was interrupting something. Again.
“Get outta your monkey suits, you two.  This Green Lady place serves food.  We can get dinner there while we check for Fairies.”
Cas got the hang of the game pretty quick.  With practice, she might even be pretty good.  He knew he should be trying to talk to people, but it was hard not to get caught up in the rhythm of playing and the stupid happy feeling he got from watching Cas.  He liked the way she’d smile whenever she’d line up and land a shot, as if she was actually enjoying herself and not just going along with something he wanted to do.  No one else came for the table, so they played another game, then another.  If not for needing to keep half an eye on the Fairies who moved and mingled now among the growing crowds, he was having more fun than he’d had in months.
movie.”  Maisie wiped a tear away with the back of the hand that wasn’t fidgeting with her shirt.  “Tim and Rosie shoulda known, naming a place in Belchamp ‘The Green Lady.’  They shoulda known – maybe they did know – that one of
They were not surprised at all when Alex Waddington confirmed that he and Matt Stupak had played darts at the Green Lady in Belchamp every week for the last five months.  With no word from Detective Drummond, Dean and Sam returned to the hotel to see what Cas had dug up.
“Are vampires usually this fastidious?” Cas asked.  “I was under the impression that they preferred to bite victims.”
Dean nodded and took the card.  Hwang finished his coffee in one gulp and left without another word.
He was right, of course.  We shouldn’t play happiness roulette, not ‘til we had a plan for dealing with a pissed off cosmic entity.  “Yeah, I know, I know,” I assured him, leaning my forehead against his, wondering how I’d never noticed that he smells like a thunderstorm.  “We’ll be careful. The goddamn Empty can’t have you.”
“My God, that’s awful,” Ada whispered. “Nearly two hundred years, trapped here, constantly awake, all because someone was afraid of the natives?  Or worried about some rowdy townspeople?”
Sam picked up the thread.  “John tagged a lot of references to something called a green woman that appears in the lore from Scotland.”  He grabbed the book and began reading.  “A green lady or
Looking back on it later, Dean didn’t even remember moving.  The next thing he knew, he had the drunken asshole’s face smashed flat against the pool table with one hand while the other hand pressed the arm that had slapped Cas up behind the guy’s back in a wickedly simple hold that would let him dislocate the shoulder with only a little more pressure in the right places.  “You were rude to the lady.  You need to apologize,” Dean growled.
“Not on Tuesdays.  But we will have a DJ later tonight to play some tunes for dancing.  If you’ll be sticking around.”
Cas unfolded herself from the chair and shivered, noticing the temperature for the first time.  “But as I said, I wouldn’t trust my judgment on such things,” she added sadly.  “I’ll go try to talk to Sam, now, if you think he’ll be willing to listen.”
Not surprisingly, her hospital room was in the psych ward.  Dean rushed the disapproving nurse out of the room with a message for Sam, ignoring her questions and offers of help, then shut the door behind her.
“I didn’t say heal him,” he corrected. “I know you can’t fix him without your angel mojo.  You apologized to me.  You need to apologize to Sam too.  He deserves to hear you say you’re sorry and you need to say it to him, for your own sake.”
“I will if you will,” she volleyed back.  “I am serious, Dean.  I can’t heal you any more when you get hurt.  I can’t keep undoing the damage you do to yourself by drinking too much, eating poorly and not sleeping enough.”
When Fenella came back, they ordered three flights of the house craft beers.  If not for the Fairies, Dean reflected, this place would be pretty awesome.  They were serious about their booze and they had cheeseburgers infused with Guinness stout.  He ordered one of those with extra fries covered in cheese sauce and bacon bits.  Sam muttered something about cholesterol but Dean ignored him.  As if he’d live long enough to die from heart disease.
“What if that’s the only reason I’m alive again?  To atone and fix all the things that I broke?” Cas asked.  “My life seems a fair trade.”
For a change, Cas wasn’t looking at Dean.  She was looking at the table, her glass, the kitchen night light, the floor, everything except the only other person in the room.  “I’m sorry for everything Dean, so, so, sorry.  I thought I was doing the right thing,” she said.
“Not the right answer, douchebag.”  He wasn’t angry – he was in that cold, calm headspace that he slipped into when hunting.  This drunken asshole was just a monster of a different kind.  “So, are you going to apologize, or am I going to bust up your arm?  It’s up to you.”  Some of the guy’s friends started making noises about coming to their buddy’s rescue, but Dean stopped them with the same glower he generally reserved for things that ate people.  “Don’t make me kick your asses too.  This is a nice place and I don’t wanna make a mess.”
“Yeah,” Maisie laughed, a little uneasy.  “We just won’t mention to her that you, like, kill Fairies sometimes.  Might harsh her mood.”
“Wendell and his buddy Jason Erickson are pledges at a fraternity at the local U. Minnesota campus.  Their ‘pledge challenge’ was to steal a prayer book from Saint Brigitta’s Church to prove they’d been inside at night.  It’s the oldest church in the county and has the reputation of being haunted,” Sam explained.
“Oh, no.  I’m so sorry Dean.  He was a good friend to you.”  She sounded honestly sorrowful, almost humanly so, Dean thought, not at all like the cool, distant angel.  He didn’t want to unpack that right now.  Or talk about Bobby with someone who might be a shifter or a demon or a Leviathan or some other horrible new trick that the universe was pulling on him.
“Look, hospital food blows.  Don’t judge all food by that slop.  You’re human, you need to eat now,” Dean insisted.  He wanted to get some kind of reaction out of her, but she seemed to have retreated somewhere he couldn’t follow.  “You ever try a cheeseburger?”
“But you didn’t just steal a prayer book, did you Jason?”  Dean pressed.  It took so little effort to put the fear of God into this kid.
I know all the back roads around the bunker like the back of my hand.  I know which roads have easy curves and very little traffic, where a guy could just drive and get out of his own head for a while, and not have to worry about dodging around beat up pickup trucks or lost antiquers in their trendy hybrid wind-up toys.  We weren’t going anywhere in particular.
It was pure bad luck that Maisie chose to ask how Castiel had come to Fall just as Castiel was working the fussy strokes of the
“The Ponca family is bitchin’ on the website that they haven’t released their son’s body yet. County morgue our first stop tomorrow?” Dean asked.
But this weird “thing” between Dean and Cas was starting to become actively uncomfortable. When Cas had only been around sometimes, usually in the middle of a major crisis, it had been easier to overlook the way the two of them could just stare at each other and ignore everything – and everyone – else in the room. Sam used to wonder if there was some kind of angel telepathy between them, but they were still doing it now that Cas was powerless. Plus, when it came to Cas, Dean was constantly pushing the limits of what could reasonably be called “big brother concern.” Sam certainly couldn’t remember Dean being quite so hands-on when teaching him how to drive or do chores.
Dean wrapped up the leftover burger and stashed it in the ‘fridge on the hope that he could encourage Cas to eat more later.  The fries, however, were beyond excellent and he wasn’t giving those up.  While he finished off both servings of fries, he compared notes with Sam, telling him the story he’d heard at the bar.  Sam had been productive while he’d been out.
When Dean finished changing, the dynamic nerd duo was still focused on the lap top screen, staring at a high-res image of some sort of carved stone.  He looked at the image from at least three angles but it was all gibberish to him.  “Gimme the meathead muscle version of what we’re lookin’ at,” Dean asked, pulling up a chair.
She teetered on the edge of crying again, but inhaled deeply and steadied herself.  “We were both working as much overtime as possible to earn extra money for the wedding and the honeymoon.  We barely saw each other the last three months.”
Maisie frowned a little and began rolling the hem of her brightly-colored shirt in her fingers.  “This sewer map, what would it look like?  Like something out of a D&D game?”  That brought Sam right back to junior high school when other kids had tried to interest him in fighting paper monsters.  He’d accepted their invitations because he’d wanted friends badly but he couldn’t take the game seriously knowing there were actual monsters out there.  Maisie grabbed a pen and paper from the table and sketched out a rough image of lines branching and intersecting and converging in a large central circle.  “Something like this?” she asked.
Dean pulled his phone out of his jacket and dialed the number for the spare he’d left with Cas.  She answered it after only a few rings, sounding sleepy.
Before he could respond, the nurse interrupted.  “Come on now Michelle, you need to leave that nice man alone.”  The nurse -- an older white woman with her blonde hair in a tight bun and a disapproving frown -- tugged on the woman’s arm as if she were a disobedient toddler.  The woman was having none of it.
She raised dopey, half-lidded eyes to him and he wondered how little rest she’d actually gotten last night.  “I saw that you were having a nightmare. You seemed to sleep better when I was here, so I stayed,” she explained.  “I meant to go back to my room once you’d settled.  What time is it?”  She rubbed her eyes and tried to focus on the clock.
About five minutes in, Cas pulled a cassette tape out of the breast pocket of his trench coat.  It was the mixtape I’d made him, back the first time I’d thought about telling him.  “I brought this in case you wanted music.”
“Thank you, Agent Gillan,” Barbara responded, her cool calm reasserting itself.  “What else do you need to know?”
“You got that right.”  With a grunt of disgust, Dean pulled him off the pool table and threw him at his friends.  “I don’t want to see you douchebags in here again, do you understand me?”
Sam was deeply relieved to be getting back to work. Rest was great and all, but work let him focus. Focus mostly stopped his head from coughing up flashbacks from the Cage or, worse, manifesting a chatty, distracting Lucifer. Well, focus and the sheer amount of valerian and Saint John’s wort he was downing with his coffee every morning. Over-the-counter calmers only went so far, though.
The woman drew a deep breath and leaned hard against the front door.  “Thank God.  At last.  Someone listened.”
Chief Ramsey did not invite them to sit down or make themselves comfortable.  He stalked around his desk, pushed a pile of papers off of his phone, and then smacked the intercom button.  “Desk Sergeant, my office now.”  Ramsey crashed to a seat in his plush office chair and glared at Dean and Sam silently for the few minutes it took for the Sergeant to respond.  Dean supposed Ramsey was trying to be intimidating, but it was like being glared at by a substitute teacher, and that sort of thing had stopped working on Dean sometime around 5
Dean and Sam scoured the church property for EMF, but the presence of so many graves nearby threw off all the readings.  The headstones were no help.  Most of them had only had names and dates, and any older inscriptions were all in Swedish, which meant they’d need Cas to read them.  “Would it have killed them to do a memorial plaque or something?”  Dean said in frustration.  “Or even a Beware of Dog sign?”
“Dean, the way I am now, I can’t heal him or replace the wall in his head that protected him from memories of Hell,” Cas protested.
Now here they were again, Cas looking at Dean and Dean looking at Cas and Sam feeling like a third wheel in his own life.
In the hallway, Sam paced while paging through a file of hospital records.  “Hospital administration was more than happy to turn over her file to her ‘cousin’ who happens to be an FBI agent,” he explained.  “I didn’t even have to tap dance around why I didn’t know the exact name she was admitted under.  Apparently they’ve never heard of patient confidentiality in Wabanquot.”
Father Pederson sighed.  “Because they were very irresponsible, and likely either very drunk or very high, doing something they shouldn’t have been doing, and want everyone to pay attention to something other than what they did?”  He shook his head in bewilderment.  “Those boys got attacked by someone’s stray dog.  Nothing more.”
The walk to and from the men’s room was an excuse to take a good look around.  He found the board that advertised the various musical acts coming to the bar that week, the area where a group was lining up to play darts, and, yep, right where he thought it would be, a pool table.  Perfect.  He hadn’t played pool without having to worry about earning money off of it in way too long.
“Cas?  Izzat you?” he murmured, still mostly asleep.  His eyes cracked open halfway but she wasn’t sure he was seeing anything.
On the drive, Dean and Sam did their best to recap the last several months, the Leviathans, and how they ended up as wanted murderers with their faces on CNN.  Cas asked a few questions but grew more and more still and silent as they talked.  Dean managed to spit out the story of Bobby’s death by getting angry because anger was the only thing that kept the grief at bay.  Well, anger and booze.  When they finally finished, with Sam explaining why they’d been in Wabanquot in the first place, the silence from the back seat had heft and weight.
“I hope you don’t mind if we take a look around the church and the grounds while Ms. Swanson does her thing with the records,” Dean asked.  “My partner here is a big history buff.”  In case the records didn’t pan out, they had a few other ideas on finding where the dog was buried.
Dean opted for honesty over comfort.  “A little.  Not much.  Mostly I think the Hell nightmares don’t happen as often now because I have a bigger selection of shit to have nightmares about.  Wish I had better news.”
The wind rose with each syllable.  A blue glow rose from the markings on the slates.  Something began to solidify within the sigil.  A low, throaty canine howl split the night.  Ada made a low sound of fear then pressed both of her hands over her mouth.  Just in case things went wrong, Dean had his shotgun at the ready, loaded with salt rounds.  Sam had an iron crowbar.
.  The Chief barely closed the door to his office before he started bitching at them.  “Look here, Agents,” he said with thinly-veiled contempt, “you can’t just come waltzing in here infringing on my jurisdiction unless one of us calls you first and I sure as hell didn’t call you.  If you’re here because of that Ponca woman I’m filing a protest with your field office.”
She may not have paid attention, but her hands were shivering whenever she paused her typing.  Dean couldn’t hold in a sigh of frustration.  “We talked about this.  You gotta listen to the meat suit when it tells you things like it’s cold or it’s hungry or it’s tired.”
And Cas, the ancient celestial being trapped in a normal human body? She seemed perfectly happy with all of Dean’s over-protective hovering, all the clasps on the shoulder, and all the other little touches and almost-touches that his brother couldn’t seem to resist when it came to her. When they’d watch movies or TV together, Sam could swear she spent more time watching his brother than watching whatever was on the screen. She would even smile, shy and hesitant as if she were afraid she’d be scolded for it, every time Dean time smacked her arm and told her to watch carefully because the “good part” was coming up. Plus, even in an entirely different body, she still had that weird Castiel way of gazing at Dean as though he were the most wonderful thing in the universe. Sam had watched a lot of people ogle his brother’s good looks over the years, but the way Cas looked at Dean was so far beyond anything that simple.
They saved the day, the vamps were dead, but something was terribly wrong. Pain shot through Deans stomach and abdomen, making it difficult to remain upright. Something had pierced into his lower back, and god Sammy looked so scared. Minutes felt like hours as the younger brother held him, trembling, and unable to keep himself composed. Of course Dean understood, he held onto his brother best he could and reminded him just how proud of a big brother he was. It wasn’t long until Dean was slipping, his vision growing dark and fuzzy, and with those simple words he allowed himself to drift off.
I’m sorry, but I’m still trying to process this. I mean I can’t even get your name right, I feel like I don’t know you at all.” Cas muttered, but Dean quickly shook his head. He moved closer to Cas, not so close that they were touching, but close enough.
“Fine. Fine, right before Cas died, and went to the empty- he said he loved me.” Dean was sure he was mumbling, but Sam’s look of complete bafflement proved he was heard loud and clear.
“I’m ready. I’m content.” Cas shouted, seemingly to no one, but someone must have heard because the voice in his head laughed. Nothing more was said, but a strong force was quick to make its presence as it grabbed the back of Cas’s head and yanked it back, hair, and scalp coming off in clumps as the empty began to take its toll on first his physical form, then his celestial form all while completely destroying his mentality. This is what Castiel had been told to prepare for. He just hoped he was ready.
“Fine, but only because I know my consciousness will keep me awake if you get eaten alive.” Cas held the door open and Dean slipped in. The cabin was big but definitely run down. It was old, as it had gone untouched for far too many years,  off the beaten path yet still owned by the Novak’s Dean was surprised it was just a duck who had taken residence.
“He said he loved me” Dean sighed, this time with a bit less strain. He wouldn’t say he relished in the words, but saying them felt almost freeing.
“I’m sorry, I know I’m still learning about sex, and sexual health, but I don’t think I exactly get this one.” Jack was looking up at the boys as if they were going to be any help with this one.
As Jack plunked in the question, and hit search, a few weblinks popped up, in which Jack clicked on the first one. Dean’s eyes scanned the first few lines, and immediately his eyes grew wide. His blood felt very hot, and suddenly he found his mouth to be full of cotton.
“Nothin Jack, Cas was actually just leaving.” Dean muttered moving to close the laptop but Jack was too quick as a slow smile crept across his face.
Dean was rounding the corner of the bunker, heading into the kitchen when he heard Jack quietly singing to himself. He stopped when he didn’t recognize the weirdly upbeat number, usually he wouldn’t have given it a second thought, but the lyrics sounded weirdly deep.
So Dean just smiled. Bringing the beer bottle up to his lips, and drinking in the feeling of purely being okay.
“I’m sorry he said what?” Sam sounded exasperated, his eyes were wide in shock, and Dean was ready to move the hell on from this conversation.
It wasn’t Dean’s, or Sam’s, it was Jacks. Long guttural screams, screams every parent would never imagine but the sound was enough to raise a deep and dark panic Castiel had almost forgotten he had. His yells, and cries tore through the angel, enough to make Cas thrash as if he were trying to run towards the sound. The pain seemed to grow more intense every time he moved, every flinch every wince only added to eternal hell he would have to live through. Cas didn’t care.
at Dean. “Not for nothing Cas, but the last time you looked at me like that? Well let’s just say I had a hard time walking the next day.” Cas looked up, eyes wide, as if he was a kid who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
“Yes it does! He’s not me and I was singing to him about strawberries! I think that counts.” Cas was laughing now too, and for a second things felt normal. “Now please go before you make me sing the strawberry song for you too.” Dean shook his head, still giggling at Cas’s words. He put his arms up in defeat, to which Cas grinned at.
“Yes and no, I spent a lot of time in Texas, but uh wasnt born there.” Cas was frowning again, he closed the passport and passed it to Dean. He looked as if he was gonna walk away, leaving Dean out here to get ax murdered or something, but the younger man was quick to stop that train of thought. “Uh wait, there’s one more thing” Avoiding Cas’s exasperated glare, Dean reached back into the Impala this time pulling out the old packet he had found earlier on his drive. He held the papers out to which Cas took them reluctantly. He let out a short scoff as he scanned the first words.
“Cas, Cas can you hear me?” The voice was familiar, and far away. Castiel slowly blinked open his eyes and bright fluorescent lights came flooding in, he immediately shut them again understanding it would take a while to adjust. What really mattered right now was that he could see. He could see and he was surrounded by light, and voices who weren’t hurting him. “Castiel? Are you awake” Cas took a moment to realize he was lying down, surrounded by warm sheets and soft pillows, a sensation he never understood because he never had to sleep. Castiel blinked a few more times forcing himself to look up at the figure standing above him. He smiled as he began to recognize him.
His first wing was almost completely gone, black goo from his eyes were beginning to clog his nose and mouth as it slipped down his throat, slowly suffocating him. Sam’s accusatory cries, and Jack's screams of pain were clogging his mind as if the voices were battling to see which one could be louder. Sam’s torment, Jack’s pain, and Dean’s silence was fogging all sensibility Cas once had physical pain aside. It was all too much, and Cas couldn’t do anything to escape it.
“No, no you don’t get to do that. You don’t get to waltz in on my finest hour, after you left us, left
“Yeah no of course not,” his voice was gruff, yet understanding. “Cas I’ve been thinking a lot about that night. In fact I don’t think I’ve been able to stop thinking about that night, and I want you to know I have never openly considered to be into- uh other dudes” he cleared his throat daring to look at Cas, who was now staring at him with such an intensity that only muddied Dean’s mind more. “I always knew we had a connection, different then mine and Sammy’s, different then I have had with anyone else. I didn’t know what it was until you- until that
“I didn’t mean for you to hear that Cas. You weren’t supposed to hear my little freak out, and you certainly weren’t supposed to hear the first things I’ve said of substance in weeks, to Sam, when I really should’ve been talking to you.” Deans words stung, why did they hurt so bad? Cas had felt pain, torture, both physical and mental. Dean’s rejection speech was not something monumental, but god did it feel like it was.
“Because I made that mistake once before. And I’m not letting you walk away again, I shoulda stopped you the first time, never again” Dean sounded determined, like a man on a mission. A mission to do what? I’m not even sure he knew.
A few more days go by and Cas works up the courage to make his way into the neighborhood where the Winchesters reside. Mary, John, Bobby, and now Dean would call this their eternal home, and Castiel almost turned around. He pushed on though, reminding himself that he couldn’t stay hidden forever, and he honestly did want to check in on Mary, he had cared for her so deeply. As he grew closer to Bobby’s residence, that’s when he saw him, the smiling, content rugged figure, climbing into the driver seat of that damned impala.
“JACK” Cas screamed, as if it would do anything. He should’ve known better, known it was all just a simple mind trick, something to cause him pain, but the voice, the screams, they were so real. He sounded so scared, so hurt, and Cas couldn’t do a thing about it. The lines between reality and fiction were beginning to blur and the angel couldn’t help but lose himself in the sound of his son’s cries that ripped through his form. He was supposed to protect him, be there for him. He failed.
“Yeah uh, it is.” Cas gestured to him to keep going. “I mean not much has changed, but being completely honest, no shits and giggles, I have learned that you gotta live every day as if it was the perfect day.” Cas’s face had softened. “I know that’s the cheesiest thing I’ve ever said, but uh you never know what the day could bring, and tomorrow always has the possibility of being better than today.” Cas looked like he was about to take Dean's hand, but like the impeccable timing they had, both boys jumped when a large crash came from outside. The rain was coming down harder, and now the trees appeared to be toppling over as well. “Jesus Christ.” Dean muttered under his breath. “Uh here you go so I can focus on that and not the fear that my car could be crushed at any minute.”
“Actually, yeah, yeah go get a hotel.” And with those final words from Dean, along with the pure look of fear in Sam’s eyes, the Angel and Dean were finally going to make up for the years they had spent apart.
It was so cold. The air, the metal, everything was so fucking cold. Dean in his drunken state stumbled over to the wall in which the empty had taken its form. In one swift motion, Dean slammed his fist into the concrete. The shot of pain he felt in his hand was quickly forgotten about despite the warm blood that seemed to drip down his knuckles and wrist.
“Uh hey Cas, it’s your husband.” Silence. Dean paused waiting for a response, he didn’t get one. “Alright I know I deserve this, but I really want to talk to you alright? I mean I could keep talking to this door but the door isn’t nearly as sexy as you.” He let out a dry laugh. He had a feeling Cas was not amused, which almost made it funnier. “Okay so either you’re my husband, or you’re a complete stranger who’s squatting at my husbands house and if that’s the case I’ve got a shit ton of guns in my car.” He paused. “Or uh- unless I got the wrong house, in that case my bad. But I’m pretty sure this is Cas’s place” Silence again. Except for— what was that? Quacking?
Yeah, it was hard. But Dean had Sam, and as long as they continued to do good for this world he would be okay. Things had actually begun to feel somewhat normal again when the boys got the vampire case. It didn’t feel like anything out of the ordinary, nothing special or strange, just a regular vamp nest who would go after families who lived out in the countryside. It wasn’t anything too difficult, it shouldn’t have been.
Cas’s breath hitched. He looked completely in shock, and Dean took his moment of bravery to do what he should’ve done years ago. He pressed his hand against the angels jaw, and in one swift motion pressed his lips into the others. Cas’s eyes widened, but soon fell shut as he melted into the feeling, his hand pressed up against Dean’s while the other rested on his waist, as if they had done this a thousand times. Everything felt right, and while both understood none of this would have been possible on earth, they also recognized this was heaven, it was okay to let go.
The panic in his eyes, the expression of pure fear and shock was the last thing Castiel saw on Dean’s face when at last he allowed himself to be engulfed by the dark black mass. Heavy cold material stuck to his coat and legs, dragging him and swallowing him into a deep abyss. However, Cas could barely process the horrific feeling as he was still entranced by the glow of being. It was like a weight off his shoulders, he was completely and utterly happy solely off of fully acknowledging his love, his real and true love, for Dean. The moment wouldn’t last, not as long as it should have as soon Cas was surrounded only by dark, the empty had taken him and a dark voice filled his head.
Cas took a slow step towards Dean, who had tears staining his cheeks, yet his face was stoic, and emotionless. The angel brought his hand up and gently pressed it against his cheek, using the pad of his thumb to wipe away a single tear. It was then when Dean no longer held back. In one Swift motion, the two were one. Their lips meet in almost a desperation as if Dean was trying to prove to himself that Cas really was there. When the two finally pulled away, he wrapped his arms around the angel and they stayed like that for a long time.
“Were you looking at the song I was singing earlier? I didn't realize you liked it so much or else I would’ve played it for you.” Jack looked elated, Dean liked something he liked, and that was really cool.
The words were soft, but so heavy. Cas wanted to rip through the wall, save him, do anything, what should’ve been a breakthrough moment was ripped away, and he would be losing Dean for what. Big heavy tears fell down Cas’s cheeks, his eyes wide as he watched in fear as Billy seemed to intervene.
He was pushing hour 8 of driving with no plans of stopping when the tire popped. He changed it in the rain. It was probably around hour 14 when he got sick of the music if that was even possible. He turned it down only for a minute to recognize that without music he was left alone with his thoughts. Quickly he cranked the shit out of it.  Around hour 22, maybe because of the exhaustion or the desperation, or both, the cheesiest idea struck Dean like a stroke of genius. While pushing 85 down the highway he shoved his hand into the passenger glove box and dug around until he found it. A crumpled yet salvageable packet Cas had left there on their first date. This could be dumb enough to work.
“No, no you don’t have to explain yourself to me. I expected this. That’s why I never spoke about it, any of it.” Cas’s words were gruff, and he refused to make eye contact with Dean. The hurt angel seemed to be struggling to find the means to get out of there without further embarrassment. “I think I’ll sit out of tonight’s escapades, thank you” he muttered, pushing past Dean and making his way down the hall towards his room.
It was quiet for a moment. The silence of the room allowed for Cas to be with Dean, and hold him until the world eventually ended. The stillness of the room almost allowed for Cas to forget, after all this couldn’t be real, nothing about this moment was real. Then he heard it, the soft buzzing of deans phone, oh.
“You should’ve come back sooner. If you knew how I felt.” Dean was still angry, that was obvious, but his voice held less aggression.
Sam was here, but Dean was holding him back from the life he deserved, a life he always should have lived. Castiel was gone, dead, murdered. Then the kid, Jack, was living his destiny. But despite winning a literal war against god, the feeling of pure abandonment and guilt had never gone away.
he took another drink. His tolerance was nowhere near enough to handle the onslaught of emotions that had washed over him, urging him to make his way down to the storage room.
It was perfect. Except for of course- Cas wasn’t exactly talking to Dean. Sure there were pleasantries! Quiet grunts of hellos and goodbyes, the casual “how are you” or “pass me a beer” was passed around quite often. The former spoken more by Cas, and the latter— Dean. But what was Dean supposed to say? “Hey pal, I know you’re gay, and that’s really fucking cool, but what do you expect me to say?” None of that really like it rolled off the tongue. Besides, Cas wasn’t exactly jumping through hoops to talk to Dean either.
“You mean If I come in I won’t be eaten alive?” Dean shot him a teasing glance, and Cas faltered for a second. It’s hard when the man you loved three days ago effortlessly is now a known pathological liar and everything that you thought you knew might as well be dust thrown into the wind, Dean couldn’t imagine what Cas must be feeling right now. Rather than answer Cas just gives him a small smile only to look back seemingly much more interested with the broken light bulb and exposed wire then he is with his husband. “I brought all my documents, my fake ones I mean, the ones that say Michael Singer? I brought them thinking maybe you’d want to burn them- I mean we could burn em’ together, kill Michael together, and then maybe you can get to meet Dean?” Cas stiffened at Deans words. Poor guy looked as if a single poke would shatter him; he was so tense.
“Jack.” Was all the angel had managed to choke out. His voice was weak, in fact his entire body was weak but none of that mattered because for the first time in what felt like an eternity he was with someone he loved. Soft silent tears fell down his face as he reached out to take Jack’s hand, who gladly took it pressing his other hand on top giving him a reassuring squeeze.
"I can show you more of what I've learned," Cas offers as he kisses higher up Dean's neck, until his mouth is level with his ear. "If you want, I can use my Grace to skip your refractory period."
With a smile, Cas pulls Dean's dick out of his mouth to respond. "That's the idea, yes." He's unlacing Dean's boots without even looking down, muscle memory kicking in.
Cas pulls his pants all the way off past his ankles and crawls back up, hooks his arms underneath Dean's and manhandles him so he's further up on the bed and not dangling off the edge. Dean's breath hitches. "Thank you." He lingers with his whole weight over him, their faces just far enough that Dean can't lean in for a kiss. "It's always nice to have my blowjob skills recognised." He leans down to ghost his lips on Dean's neck, hands moving to hold his wrists above his head.
Cas fishes a lighter —black, no outrageous pattern this time— out of his pocket. It sputters when he tries to get it to light and he makes a frustrated noise around the joint in his mouth. Dean reaches into his bedside table and fishes out a zippo he got in the middle of who knows where.
“Are you alright? It’s okay if you’re not, I understand how this became much darker then I’m sure you anticipated.” Cas seemed to be rambling, well as close to rambling as the angel would allow. Dean just nodded letting out a cough as if he were clearing his throat, or maybe just filling the silence.
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Dean’s voice pierced Cas’s mind, derailing his thoughts only for a second that allowed him to wonder what if? What if this wasn’t a good idea? What if the pain of the other would outweigh the good that would come? What if he loved him back? The pain of delving into any of these would be too much, best to leave it unsaid, and keep powering forward. Dean needed to live.
“You didn’t answer the question.” Cas glanced down, a small smile crept onto his face. He looked back up to meet Dean’s eyes and passed him the papers.
“No I think you’re right, I see us too.” Cas sounded so sure of himself, he was staring at Dean with such an intensity, not that that was any different for Cas. “But, at the end of the day one of us always comes back.” This statement should have been light, and should have broken the tension, but the way Cas was looking at Dean, it caused for the Winchester to freeze up completely. He swallowed hard, and struggled to find anything at all to say back.
“Times up boys.” Billy bent down and touched Dean’s shoulder, in which Cas saw his eyes shut, and his body grow limp and lifeless as he slumped against the wall. As Death disappeared it was only then that Cas could run towards him. He was quickly on the ground, his eyes still wide with shock as he pressed his hand into the wound. He should’ve understood, should’ve handled this like he had been able to every other time they lost someone, but this felt different.
“Uh, Arms Tonite, it’s by Mother Mother, it’s all over the internet.” Jack tilted his head ever so slightly “I can stop if you want, sorry if I bothered you.” Dean shook his head at that.
“I know you feel like everything I told you was a lie, but you know more shit about me than anyone else I know.” Dean paused for a second,  pursing his lips. “Alright uh, me and Michael? We both have the same taste in music? Led Zepplin all the fucking way” Cas almost smiled at that, Dean took it as an invitation to keep going. “Me and Michael both love the shit out of a good Apple pie, we both have the same amount of love for the old car parked out front.” He paused “same taste in guys that’s for damn sure” Cas rolled his eyes, but now he was looking at Dean. “I want you to know everything, not because it’s fun for me, actually if I had the choice I’d rather stick a knife in my eye, but I want to do this for you.” Dean didn’t like how raw he sounded, he hated that this whole exercise was based around his vulnerability. “But uh, I gotta work up to that, so at this point let’s just get to question 4.” Cas was always an amazing listener, every time you spoke to him you just knew he’d take in every word. Dean admired how easy Cas could drink it all in, and the patience he could have in any given moment, especially in times where Dean felt a bit more sporadic. That quality would especially come in handy in a  super common situation like this.
“Oh yeah I’m totally good, I just didn’t realize how much this related to us-“ Dean cut himself off when he realized he had said too much, sure he meant for that to be implied with everyone who had fought for team free will, but right now, in a room with just him and Cas, it looked an awful lot like Dean had just admitted he had seen himself and the angel within the context of the song.
“Well I don’t really sing, but the last time I sang to myself was when I was stress fixing the bathroom sink this morning, and the last time I sang for someone was when I wanted Crowley to eat his cut up strawberries.” Dean laughed, like really laughed, probably a bit louder then he should’ve, but what can he say? He wasn’t expecting that at all.
“Oh my god you drove all the way out here so we could play 36 questions.” To say Cas looked annoyed would be a bit of an understatement. Honestly Dean should be used to it by now, but he knows his husband, and he knew if Cas really wanted him gone he wouldn’t still be here entertaining this charade, and that was pretty promising on its own.
“If I could have dinner with anyone in the world, dead or alive it would be Dean.” His voice was gruff as he continued to speak. “I could have dinner with Gandhi, or Da Vinci, or Oprah, but if I had to choose, I would throw it all away to have dinner with Dean. Dean who I had never met, or thought I knew, just Dean Winchester. I would have dinner with you.” Dean couldn’t help but smile at that, how could he not? Cas wanted to have dinner with him! Okay maybe under different circumstances but hey he’d take it. “There, okay I answered the question, let's move on to the next one.” Cas was avoiding his glance again, almost embarrassed by his honesty. Dean shook his head.
“That’s not the question is it.” Dean shot back. Cas let out an annoyed sigh, it was probably the 5th time he’s made this noise within the hour and Dean woulda called him on it too if he wasn’t interrupted by another loud clap of thunder.
“Seriously Dean? You really think everythings normal? Trust me I have gotten used to your and Cas’s little fights believe me I have. But this? This has lasted way too long.” Sam took a breath to gage Dean’s reaction who seemed to have just been shrugging off the statement.Sam shook his head, his hand rubbing the bridge of his nose. “I know Cas scared us, but we got him back, he’s okay! Are you really still offended that he sacrificed himself for you?”
“I just mean that- ya know that uh- that we fight for eachother, all of us, to make sure we’ve got eachothers backs.” Dean was fumbling over his words, he was 1000 percent sure he was red as a god damned tomato, and his anxious stutters did him no favors. It was so stupid how one song got him into this god damn predicament.
“I- yes I am real.” Cas looked down at himself and back at Dean “I suppose I owe you an explanation, but- but we can’t just avoid what you’re doing, what you wanted to do.” Castiel looked scared, anger and emotion welled behind his words, but his eyes were wide and desperate.
“Cas, I know the last thing I deserve is your forgiveness, but I really want to explain myself, I really want you to get to know me.
“I’m gonna kiss you now, Castiel. Unless you gotta problem with that?” Cas’s eyes widened, quickly growing flushed as he struggled to find the words.
Cas seemed to have glanced over them too, because his usual confused expression, now looked even more confused, if that was even possible.
“I’m sorry Castiel. But it was his life, or mine. I’ve seen how this story goes.” She pulled the staff from Dean's chest causing him to gasp. Castiel stared in horror, his chest heaving as he fell to his knees, his hands shaking as he went to heal the wound, but Billy was too fast. The angel was tossed to the side and pinned to the wall, unable to pull away.
The more Cas spoke, the warmer it seemed to get. Of course the Angel knew how to put it into words, man can’t understand certain idioms, but he sure had his way with analysis.
“I uh, I’m just looking at these lyrics, the kid was singin it earlier. I was trying to figure what it’s about” Dean muttered, his eyes darting from the laptop to Cas’s face, who looked as if he were in deep thought.
“And it has your real name on it?” He sounded genuinely curious, maybe a little bit hopeful, which Dean was eager to hold onto. Cas had his head tilted ever so slightly in question, Dean nodded.
“Cas, it never mattered.” Any filter Dean had previously was gone, his voice sounded raw as he took a step closer to the angel. “If you didn’t look like this I can’t promise I wouldn’t have realized years ago, but either way it would’ve been you, it’s always been you. I have never
“Question 1. If you could have dinner with anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would it be?” Dean looked up at Cas expectantly, he had an idea of who he would say but he would like to hear it from him. However the more Cas seemed to squirm the less Dean was sure.
“You know we can go to a hotel if you want?” Eileen giggled, causing Dean’s face to grow red. Cas let out a short cough as he straightened his tie. “I think we can manage.” Cas muttered giving Dean a small smile.
“Hold on I didn’t get to answer.” Cas looked up for a brief moment, Dean was staring at him with a childish expression. “I bet you could guess who I would pick?”
“I’ve always wanted you. It’s always been you.” Dean felt his voice waver, but pressed on. “You were the first person that really saw who I was, you were the first person I cared about who wasn’t my blood relative, you were the first confusing ass bundle of feelings that I was afraid to unpack. And I have missed you so goddamn much I haven’t been able to comprehend it.”
“Please.” Castiel was now facing him, with a sense of desperation that Jack couldn’t manage the courage to argue with.
“You already apologized for that Dean, you don’t need to make up for it again, besides I’m not leaving I’m just taking a moment of absence.” Cas had made the mistake of looking up, where he had met the eyes of a very sad looking Dean.
“Yes, I probably could,” Cas grumbled, taking a moment to look over at Crowley, who was most definitely judging Cas right now. Dean was still staring at him expectantly, as if he wanted Cas to indulge him, and play the game. “Dean-“
“Dean, you deserve love. You’ve always deserved love. I wish you saw you the way I see you.” Cas took a shaky breath before continuing “I heard every prayer, every apology, and I felt every single emotion you have had since I was able and I once again broke the rules for you. Because I can’t sit idly by and watch you kill yourself I won’t do it.”
The days, and weeks which had followed Cas’s death were hard. While pouring all energy into Chuck’s demise was a reliable distraction, once that was over and done- well.
“Maybe.” Cas said with a shrug as he gently ran his knuckle down the back of Crowley the duck, who didn’t seem as  opposed to Cas like he did Dean. “The name kind of fit him though, he’s a bit of a trouble maker, but I found him quite  literally lounging in my living room so I figured he could stay.” Dean was smiling now, he couldn’t help it, for a second things almost felt normal, with the exception of the break in ducks of course.
The sound of flesh and bone cracking under Death’s scythe had managed to interrupt Cas. The empty that had begun to form was now disappearing almost in fear as the angel slowly gazed down to see the long curved piece of metal barely holding Dean together. The Winchester met Cas’s eyes before falling to his knees.
