Live and forget.
The deep timbre of the voice he so long to hear caught him off guard and he turned his head towards the source.
Still, snores.
Castiel was still aware that one of Dean's friends—the alpha guy was watching him silently with a heavy gaze.
Without thinking much, guessing it was probably Sam, Dean picked up the phone.
He was a complete mess that day, the hole in his aching heart was getting deeper and even deeper each time he tried to pretend or ignore how it screams for one person.
"What are you doing here?"
Minutes later, Dean came back and found Cas was apparently sleeping; dark ruffled hair, with his lips parted and Dean smiled at the adorable sight.
Then he's gone as fast as he reached out and talked with Castiel just few minutes before.
The demon's voice was silky rich deep with sated lust as he rolled over from the motionless body. Castiel gritted his teeth, trying to ignore the sudden burning feeling inside his chest seeing the demon had laid with some random human.
He proved his point with another forceful thrust and smirked when he heard the small gasp let out by the alpha in front of him. He growled low enough in warning, before finally releasing the pathetic excuse of an alpha.
“Was it you?” he asked.
alpha, living under Dean’s shadow.” He huffed a chuckle, rubbing against the blisters around his hand; a solid prove from the undoubtedly
Dean was silent and Castiel turned fully to stare at him directly on the eyes saying, “You can't leave nor be away from me. Not anymore.”
in the air as he let his backpack off his shoulder, letting it slide onto the floor before he wrapped his arms around his boyfriend's neck, fingers grabbing at Cas' dark hair while he bare his neck to make more room for his alpha to bite on.
“….so bed it is.” Dean continued for him, moving forward to catch Cas' lips into a deep with tongue kiss. “You think you can hold it until we get home?” He asked soon as they separated, a string of saliva in between their lips.
Their gazes never left each other and Dean tried not to be distracted by the furled and unfurled of the angel's wings.
They were on a hunt, something about people's hearts gone missing at the next town near Lebanon and since Sam was hunting with Eileen on another case; both Dean and Cas for the first time partnered up on a case.
Dean didn't push any other questions to him but instead, he asked, “So now, we're kind of connected?”
Benny kissed the top of Dean's head before asking again, “Care to share with the class?”
The pregnancy test fell onto the floor with a loud ‘clack’ as Dean's began to clutch his head with his now free hand. He pulled on his hair, his mind was screaming at him, grasping and trying to process everything that just happened.
“Winchester.”

dress shirt that the collar slipped down his left shoulder, showing the fair unblemished skin beneath it, and Dean never felt so
The air surrounding him smelled so foreign and different from what he used to
Swiping off the snooze on his alarm, which had already went off for Chuck knows how long—Dean yawned before rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms. Puffs of warm breath fanned on the back of his neck making him shuddered as he slowly entered his consciousness.
Castiel was no heaven's angel no more but he'll be Dean's angel. Always and forever.
With his bag slung on one shoulder, phone in his hand, he pressed in the speed dial number for Cas.
Soon they were kissing, clothes were thrown haphazardly onto the floor and the TV soon fades into their background as they made love on the couch for the night. When Benny's knot had calmed down, he slipped out and carried Dean towards their bedroom for another round of love making; sweet words of love whispered into each other's ears before they were soon retired to sleep; bodies flushed together, hearts beat in sync.
“It was an order. So I obeyed.” She said without blinking.
Dean grinned happily at the adorableness of his angel and he wrapped his arms around Cas' neck, his fingers playing at the short hair on the nape. "I'm not going anywhere, Cas." He chuckled.
Whenever Castiel came by and fed Adrian, the assigned nurse was always smiling kindly at him, saying that it's been
“You're smiling. What's on your mind cher?” Benny's gruff voice anchored him back to the current world; where both of them were cuddling up on the couch, watching some reruns of a horror show.
“Lucifer is one of the original beings,” Crowley drawls. “He’s hard-coded into the fabric of the universe. Somehow, I doubt an egotistical seraph hopped up on souls is one of the five things that gun can’t kill.”
“You got a better idea?” Dean leans forward.
Cas’ whole body jerks. The words are a slap in the face.
This is when he visits Jack.
Sam hugged him as well, and both brothers clapped him on the back and said
These many years later, Cas suspects that Anna that day noticed something growing within him that he himself had not. That she gave him that memory, those desires and sensations, to bring him lower, hasten his fall. At the time, all Cas knew was that she had opened something in him, something new and dangerous, something that he didn’t understand. A ravenous pit he feared would eventually consume him.
. Ready to receive whatever Dean plans to give him.
Dean rolls off him, breathing heavily. Cas reaches over to stroke his hair, feeling as he moves the wet stickiness of Dean’s mess sliding out of his vessel, beginning to cool. He could disintegrate it with a thought, if he wished, but he actually enjoys the grossness, the physicality of it. And he likes it when Dean marks him as his own.
” Sam’s voice has gone high with frustration. Cas pulls out a chair on Dean’s other side and sits down, folding his hands in his lap.
Cas isn’t sure what he did wrong, on that first hunt, but since then, Dean doesn’t invite him along.
“I’m saying he had a plan of action, Dean. He was gonna drink cattle blood. He was gonna buy a bus ticket to Texas and live on the plains. It’s not like vampires get heat stroke.” Cas hands Sam his beer. “Thanks, Cas.” Sam says, glancing in his direction.
“Cas I gotta- I gotta say something. We need to- I’ve had a lot of time to think about what you said. You know. Back then.”
“Mm. They teach you to word it like that in megalomaniacal murderer school?”
Choking, icy relief filled him at the thought. They really could just go back to the way things had always been. Never having to speak of it. There would be no irreparable crack. No schism. Only more of the same.
“For one thing, I never once stuck my dick in you,” Dean says. “...Least as far as I can remember.” He shivers, thinking about that hospital room. Standing over the bed, watching him press a hand to her forehead.
Grace pools in every part of his vessel Deal touches. In his collarbone, under Dean’s lips; in his shoulder, under Dean’s hand; in his guts, where Dean penetrates him. Everything that makes up
“Hmm. I guess that would also be an apt metaphor.” Quizzical. The smile has disappeared, replaced by a tilted head that Dean isn’t looking at but can still see, clear as day.
Cas watched Dean as he bit his lip and glanced to his left, the opposite direction from where Cas was sitting.
Dean doesn’t hunt so much anymore. It might be because there is simply less brutality in a post-Chuck world. But Sam still seems to find hunts for himself.
And he swallows.
Hopeless.
Powerless.
There is a beat.
On the TV, Dallas and Leeloo made love in the recovery chamber, and the credits rolled. Cas nestled closer to Dean.
Dean asked him, once, guiltily, if he had even moved while the brothers were gone. Cas had, of course, lied. But now he always makes sure, a few hours before the Winchesters’ return, to create a small, insignificant mess in the Dean Cave, or the library, or Dean’s bedroom, in order to give a more human appearance to his waiting, and alleviate Dean’s concerns.
“What?”
Dean squeezes his eyes shut, and pulls the trigger.
So he prays. And he hopes - for what, he doesn’t know. Perhaps for this new god to spit out the chewed remnants of his son and allow Cas’ love to piece him back together again. Perhaps for a quick and merciful death to the parts of Jack that still live. Perhaps just that Cas’ prayers give him solace, wherever, whatever he is now.
Cas doesn’t even blink.
“What? What the fuck kind of question is that?” Dean stops. He almost turns. Almost.
“That’s not- Okay. That’s another thing I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. You know you can… talk to us, right? About stuff that’s upsetting you. About Jack.”
Bobby tries to banter with him, intimidate him a little, but Dean cuts through the crap:
“Well, first of all, I'm not gay. Jesus, buddy, you can't just say shit like that. Dudes don't talk that way to each other.” For a moment, Dean is talking to a friend. Is remembering talking to a friend. A friend he can chide and teach and mentor and mold. It's nice, for just that moment.
Dean has blood splashed across the front of his favorite jacket. But it’s not his, not even human. Cas can smell it. Vampire.
“Wasn't my fault they sent the psycho angel to get me out of hell.”
There's no flutter of wings, not anymore. The thing walking behind him has no need of them. The only announcement he has of its presence is a second set of footsteps not quite in rhythm with his.
is. And I can get it for you.”
“If you have it, and you’re so confident, why not use it yourself?” Dean asks, stepping a little closer, the toe of his boot almost touching the edge of the Devil’s trap.
“Because,” Crowley says, “on the off chance I’m wrong… well. I don’t want it to be
It's during one of these drinking sessions that he first tells Bobby
Wordlessly, Cas extends a hand and brushes it against Dean's sleeve, letting grace flow through his fingertips and heal Dean’s cut arm. Dean gives him a look, lips pursed, eyebrows raised, and Cas looks down. He knows Dean doesn’t like him using up his limited grace on what Dean would consider small things, but Cas could see that Dean had already popped out three of the stitches that Sam had put in just driving back to the bunker, and he wanted to forestall any more pain. He leaves the black eye and the split lip, and busies himself retrieving cold beers from the fridge.
Sam and Dean arrive home after the sun has set. Cas waits at the bottom of the staircase. When they come in, Sam looks upset. Dean’s face is stony.
The first time the three of them went out on a hunt together after he saved Cas from the Empty, Dean had seemed to draw into himself. He was angry. Touchy. He didn’t touch Cas or talk to him beyond the required, and he didn’t meet Cas’ eye once. When a random civilian tried to speak with him, instead of charming them, he would snap, or brush them off. When, once they were back at the motel, Cas tried to stroke his hair to calm him, Dean shook him off with a short,
and other usual things. Cas was glad for the way they were both holding his arms, since he was fairly certain he would have collapsed on the floor without the both of them supporting his weight. Dean tossed him a beer once they reached the bunker’s kitchen, and they stood around like old times.
“But are you guys… good?” Sam pauses. “I mean…
Cas climbs to his feet. The knees of his slacks are filthy, and in one spot, torn. His lips are swollen from pressure. His chin is flecked with drool.
“That’s private,” Cas repeats, louder, the hallway beginning to spin around him.
He locks himself in an empty room, and stands there, back against the door. He finds that he is panting. Not from exertion, but from something else. A weight pressing in on him from all directions. This cannot continue.
Dean licks his lips, and takes a breath. Another pause.
“Oh?” The smile is back. The smile responds to blood in the water.
“I mean the kid was- Oh, hey, Cas.” Sam’s composure snaps into place as he looks down, and he smiles in his apologetic way.
“It didn’t work on Lucifer,” Dean says, and sees realization dawn on Sam’s face.
So, this was it. Would Dean eject him from the bunker? He didn’t sound angry, but Cas had never found reading Dean to be an easy task.
Strange bedfellows, indeed.
But. The look on Cas’ face.
do is take a step forward. And then another. And another. Until the barrel of the Colt is inches from his face. Wide blue eyes meet Dean’s.
Dean himself was standing. Gripping the back of a chair, leaning over it, as though there was something he needed to see more clearly on the other side of the room.
Cas’ favorite type of evening, however, is when Dean wants to go for walks. In the darkness and loneliness of the woods outside the bunker, Dean will hold Cas’ hand. The absolute isolation allows Dean to be a little more free. The eyes he seems to feel don’t extend all the way out there. Once, he swung Cas around on an impulse and kissed him against a tree. Dean is never so spontaneous, conducting their life on a rigid schedule, within rigid boundaries. There is something freeing for him about being alone, outdoors, and Cas reaps the benefits with pleasure.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says. Cas stops in his tracks. He is making his way from the library to his secret shrine. He has no excuse, no reason, no explanation for why he is in this particular hallway.
“Let's go home, Alpha.”
He was glad he's wearing his scent blocker or any people around his radius might smell how he's already leaking a bit of slick whilst practically oozing sex pheromones right fucking now.
He cursed internally, gripping his pen tight.

Dean's heart shattered.
He would purposely fed in any open area; sometimes it was at a field, under the highway bridge or motel rooms whenever he felt like doing it. Dean always waited at his feeding place a tad bit longer than he usually was—black eyes always roamed searching for any signs of the angel to come by.
"I'm gonna give you blue balls if you don't wake up, Cas. I mean it."
"Cas, I gotta pee for goodness sake."
so it’s technically your fault.”
i don't know a thing about Pontiac or Illinois for that matter, so i just went with my imagination instead of how the city would be and so on.
“Because Heaven told me so, Castiel. It was written down in your destiny. To be a fallen angel and fell in love with a outcasted demon.” She smiled as she continued, “You guys really made a pair—though it was quite challenging for me to execute such rare order.”
Being so damn close to the demon, Castiel fought the temptation to feel those lips again. To kiss the man breathless until he falls down into the pit of Castiel's mercy. He gulped, shoving those forbidden thoughts away into the back of his mind.
“You should show me some respect.” Castiel lowered his voice, “I'm an angel, I could kill you anytime I want.”
Dean began to type another reply as fast as possible when his class was about to continue.

Glancing at the alarm clock on the nightstand, it was already 10:12 AM which explains why he didn't feel the need to sleep again. Since after their sexcapades last night—they did a full three rounds, and Dean's ass might be a bit sore—he should feel worn out and tired but for some reason he felt..kind of energetic?
He nodded, then the class continued on as if nothing's happened.
Standing up, not caring that he's barefoot and all; he unfurled his dark wings from the hidden space and made a few experimental heavy flaps, liking the way his wings muscles and tendons moved so effortlessly.
He stroked his thumb gently just beneath his navel through the thin shirt he wore, and felt a single streak of tear slid down from the edge of his right eye. He quickly rolled over onto his side, curled up whilst his arms wrapped around his stomach as he began to weep silently.

and finally lets Dean go. Dean took the chance and quickly made his way out of the room, literally running down the hallway, bee lining towards the bathroom only cladded in nothing but his boxers.
No morning sickness, no weird cravings, and never positive results.
Maybe it's better this way. He didn't deserve to be saved.
“Remind me to not being in the same room with you the next time you spend your rut.” Cas groaned, flopping onto the small couch, finally after what felt like days—freshly showered and dressed in his most comfortable shirt and pajama pants. He shut his eyes, leaning back against the backrest with his head tilted up. “I don't think I could get it up anymore.” he whined almost weakly.
"Didn't I tell you? I'm here for

Then—someone was clearing his throat upon entering the kitchen and Dean rolled his eyes when Sam sauntered casually towards the table, a tablet in his hand as usual, pretending he didn't just purposely ruining the moment.
What took Benny so long anyway? Dean glanced at his phone for the millionth time, it was already 8:40 PM and Benny's shift for every Tuesdays was supposed to end at 8 PM. Their apartment was only fifteen minutes away minus the traffic so..why do Benny's not home yet?
Cas actually is with those messy hair ruined just because of him.
alpha, Dean inhaled deeply, just for reassurance and braved himself to stride into the cafe with his head held high.
Dean pulled away, and began to mouth at Cas’ neck instead, leaving Cas free to speak.
Dean searches for something to cover himself with before he sees Sam and Bobby again.
So Cas allows himself twenty minutes to weep. Then he stands. He brushes off his coat. He snaps away the tears. And he makes himself Dean’s again.
Like very old times.
“Where
For millennia, he had no thought of

you happy?”
The problem, of course, is that the child is beyond his reach, and the lover is warm and breathing.
Cas’ kneecaps hit the cement floor, and suddenly Cas is staring up at Dean, eyes still wide, and much more of the gun disappears between Cas’ lips. Dean realizes he’s taken it deep in his throat.
Cas pulls off. It’s a slow, smooth movement. Careful. Practiced. Cas lets the spit-slick tip of the Colt fall from his lips. His eyelids fall for a moment, and he looks up at Dean through his lashes. Cas licks his lips. His head darts forward, and Dean nearly drops the gun as Cas licks a strip up the barrel.
. He lies to himself about his own intentions. But when he steps outside the wards, he's disappointed that no one is there to greet him. He's disappointed the next night too, and the one after that.
And Cas presses a kiss to the tip.
“Bind?
“How’s the mass killings treating you?” Dean clenches his left fist.
What he
Dean still wasn’t looking at Cas when the lightbulb just over his head burst.
Cas froze. He did not move from his pose, but the casual arrangement of limbs changed instantaneously from a relaxed, ready posture, to a prison from which he was unsure he would ever free himself.
He slides to the floor. This cannot continue.
Finally: “I know where
A year later, when Dean asked Cas to remove him from her mind, he had sifted through her memories as he was taking them. He saw that she had wanted as well, that there was togetherness in wanting. Like with Anna, he found himself in communion with her, though she did not choose it, was not even really present.
“I love you both as well,” Cas whispered.
Dean was no stranger to stealth missions. He would be able to sneak around no sweat, but he wondered…
“I'll be right back, Cas,” he called over his shoulder, “Go ahead and get comfortable, okay?”
"Papa," Jude prayed, shivering in the cool air, "Help me."
“Okay!” Sam exclaimed, having to pause to breathe before continuing, “I – I'm – I'm with Gabriel, alright?”
seems a bit hungry.”
“Your turn, Oliver,” he said, nudging Ollie's shoulder.
“Not everyday, Jess,” Sam replied slowly, reaching over to curl her hair behind her ear, “Sometimes, uncle Dean and I just help people. That's what hunting is really all about.”
Sammy was already standing at the toilet taking a leak, hunched over to block himself from Dean's view. Dean instantly gasped in surprise and spun around to avoid being blinded. Dammit! Why didn't Sam lock the door or something?! Dean huffed a breath of annoyance as he bolted back out of the bathroom.
Dean looked up into his angel's baby-blue eyes and smiled. Did he really not see the connection?
“Jude... Being an angel does not define you,” Papa said, holding Jude's cheek in his soft hand, “You are a smart, kind, beautiful young boy. And your father and I love you just as you are... Can you forgive us for being so insistent?”
Dean sighed loudly, hanging his head to rub his eyes. Oh, for the love of God. Why did things always have to result in a chick-flick moment? Why did everything always have to turn so damn dramatic? Why wasn't he in a motel room with Cas somewhere right now, having his ass pounded like there was no tomorrow? Why did he have to sit here and talk about his feelings?!
“It’s okay, Papa. I promise,” Jude assured.
And so it was, that Clarence met his biological father for the first time. ;) Yeah, I know. Caldwell is an... interesting person, to say the least. I can't tell you much more about him at the moment, sorry to say. But this bizarre plot will make more sense as it goes on. (I hope. Lol) :) Yes, Death will be making his way into this story, too! (We've got all kinds of guests this time, huh? Lol) I hope that you all enjoyed the tense interaction between Clare and the warlock. I would love to hear about your reactions to his story and his feelings toward Clare! :) Thank you guys so much for reading and reviewing, and I hope you're enjoying everything so far! :) Next week's chapter will be out soon! :)
Castiel smiled to himself, recalling the memory of the cabin Jude was born in. He, too, remembered every fine detail of the day Jude was born. The pain, the blood, the tiny sweet cry that filled the room. And the memory of transferring Jude – still wet and swaddled in Castiel's trench coat – into Dean's arms. The look of pure joy and astonishment on Dean's face was engrained into Cas's memory like marks on a stone. It was possibly the best moment of Castiel's entire existence.
"But he didn't!" Sam pointed out, "Oliver can't just take her without my permission! She's my daughter!
A gentle knock at the fitting room door made Jessie flinch out of her thoughts.
That also included his urge to attract Castiel's attention.
What's more, Castiel knew why he's here.
Castiel zipped up his bag, and slung it onto one shoulder. This time he was the one who spoke first. Can't really help it, since he actually had a

but shock to see the human shaped figure suddenly lunged forward towards the demons, then sounds of screaming echoed throughout the dark forest with blinding white lights surrounding them. When it finally stopped, Dean's body was rolled over by a pair of gentle but firm hands so he was lying on his back whilst the black figure crouched next to him.
, ass still so deliciously sore and he could feel the dark blueish mark left by Cas on his
things he'd done with the alpha.
“It's up to you to assume anything, Castiel. But I give you one fair warning. If you don't give yourself to the temptation of love itself, you'll lose what you had. See you again, brother.”
“Where the fuck am I?”
Thank god he'd sprayed himself with a scent blocker this morning since he had a gym session and somehow he's hoping that it will cover up the smell of his arousal.
It has been a struggle, with him being an omega and all that hormone shit he had going through but a year after, with the adequate supports from Sammy, and his family alongside with his co–worker and practically everyone around him; Dean decided and had been absolute in taking the big step forward.
Dean smirked again with two pointed fangs showed between his lips. His eyes were zeroed on the patient, as he licked his lips, imagining the taste of his new founded meal.
“Wanna kiss me,
"Why would you—" Cas stopped, blue eyes squinted, eyebrows furrowed watching Dean watching him.
"I just—" Cas stopped short, rubbing his forehead adorably like a goddamn kid against Dean's shoulder. "I love you, Dean."

"Shit, Cas. I bet we could try that next time, huh baby? But for now, I'll leave you to yourself."
When there was not even a single silhouette, or flutter of wings, Dean would leave the scene and teleported himself towards the top of the tall abandoned building and stared down the city line. He didn't even bother to clean up his messes as he left those dead corpses to rot.
He went back home, totally forgetting the main reason why he wandered down the streets towards his favourite bakery without any breads and pies accompanied him back to the apartment.
“Fine, just—be good, okay?” Dean stared into his eyes with a silent
“Well, in that case I ditched mine because of your

his eyes up and down the very naked alpha whom sitting on top of him; with his knot still locked deep inside the constantly clenched hole.
The sun was setting down in the horizon, blue of the sky gradually covered in orange and pink hues as the sun went down. Castiel sighed, hands in his trench coat pockets as he stared at the beauty of the nature through the opened window of the hospital room.
The more they stared at each other, the closer the invisible pull Dean felt towards the angel. He didn't realize that he was taking the one step forward, now both their breaths mingled; noses almost touching and lips were just mere inches away.
was watching him.
ridiculously enough; he had an allergic reaction towards Omegas’ scents and Omegas’ pheromones in his close vicinity to the point he’s on medication to null the effects.
When the man's soul was at least healed; hollow broken patches were mended albeit not perfectly as before—Castiel wiped his memories regarding the demon before he teleported the man to his apartment after making sure he was already fully clothed, all with the help of Castiel's grace.
“What's it look like? I'm
Castiel was well aware of how people were still staring at him, mostly omegas but he ignored them as usual; and stride towards his class. The pink little piece of paper felt like it weight a ton in his slack's pocket.
we're talking about, then why is he so fucking weak?”
"Morning, sunshine." Dean grins lewdly, biting his bottom lip for show.
"Cas, dude—" Dean tried to pry Cas' arm away from curling around his waist but to no avail.
That night, Dean went into bed with a thought of a certain blue eyed alpha in his mind as he tried to ignore the heavy pulls from his inner omega that demanded the alpha's presence.
“She can't hurt me too bad,” he mumbled.
Dean actually let out a fake, high-pitched chuckle nearby.
Jude turned back to his parents and nodded. He was still super happy about his car, but he was slightly bummed about not being able to take it for a ride yet. Dad was right, though. The best things in life were earned, and getting to drive something that he helped work hard on seemed more rewarding. Clarence seemed to be the only one in the group that noticed Jude's hint of disappointment, because he stepped over to Bobby's truck and opened the door to reach inside.
“Dean,” Sam started in, his voice high and unmistakably defensive, “I know this looks bad -”
“Angel grace will burn you to a crisp if you get too close, lad. And nephilim grace is even more powerful,” Crowley informed.
The depth of Cas’s calm voice greeted him early one morning. Dean knew it was early because he blinked one eye open long enough to see the glowing numbers ‘6:34’ on his bedside clock before realizing that the angel who spoke was hovering over him. Usually, Cas woke up in bed next to him – naked, of course, just the way Dean liked. But on this particular day, Cas was standing fully dressed next to Dean’s bed in the bunker, leaning down so that their faces were close in the dark. Dean blinked toward the outline of his boyfriend’s eyes, nose, and mouth, unable to think about anything other than Cas’s scent filling his lungs with each breath.
“No, you're not,” Jude denied, shaking his head, “Clarence, you are not going to turn out like either of your parents.”
Thankfully, Dean didn't have to answer Bobby's question – because at least five possessed men were running toward them. Once again, Dean's hunting side was activated. As the demons started pouring in, he put his head down and took his first shot; throwing Ruby's knife into the eye socket of the first guy before running forward to rip it out and plunge it into the chest of the next one. Dean caught glimpses of Gabriel and Bobby fighting them too, while he did his best to stab a path down the midway. The demons were just coming out of nowhere, throwing themselves into the scrap like mutts.
“Okay. Let's meet downstairs in twenty minutes,” he suggested, edging toward the door.
“What's going on?”
Gabriel looked smugger in that moment than Clare had ever seen him. He sat up straighter and crossed his legs, looking like a teenage girl about to spill the tea. Next to him, Sam groaned and tossed his head of hair into his hands, bracing both of his elbows on his knees like a man defeated.
“I know... But your father did this for me when I was pregnant with you. I believe this practice is called ‘paying it forward,’” Papa hummed, smiling a little.
“Gabe.”
Jessica gave him a small smile, but Jude could tell that his statement wasn't very effective. Poor Jess. She really wanted to get married to Ollie...
“I love you too, Papa. Thank you so much for bringing us here. I'll call you soon, okay?” Jude replied, wanting to put his mind at ease.
“Nope. There's another one out there. It's in Hell, where uncle Crowley lives,” Gabe carefully explained, “Your Grandpa built that one for your

“I know,” he winked, “Now, are we gonna eat this or what? My arm's getting tired.”
“Yep. And it's never been opened,” Dean nodded, “We found it in one of the dorm rooms.”
“You built a portal to hell itself?” Rowena asked, “Why did you do such a dark deed?”
With his husband’s voice echoing around the trembling room, Jude forced his muscles to clinch tighter. He was eager to receive Clare’s donation this time. So ready to help make magic happen. Using his elbows, Clare crawled his way up to a sitting position for better thrusting power. Jude moaned at the difference of speed, cradling the back of Clare’s head as they blinked at each other. The room continued to quake in the presence of Jude’s grace, reinforcing the desperation of it all. With two more hard thrusts, Clare bear-hugged Jude’s torso and shouted out.
deserve all the love he could get. The smile on Cas's face dimmed a bit and he looked back at Chuck like he was still confused.
“I like it, too,” he nodded feverishly, “Really, I do.”
With all that in mind, I really hope that you guys enjoy this big finale! There will be at least 14 chapters. And, as always, I will try to post every Friday morning until it's finished. :) I cannot thank you guys enough for following this story for so long (two whole years!) and I hope that you will continue to enjoy it until the very last sentence. :) Again, Happy Valentine's Day to you all! I love you with all my heart! *kisses and hugs* The next chapter – which kicks off the angst – will be out soon! :)
Sam shrugged off the mention of his torture like it was nothing; like only a truly experienced hunter would. The ridiculously tall man gently sat down on the end of the bed, accompanied by Gabriel who basically plopped himself down near Sam.
“I – I love you... Cas...” Dean mumbled, feeling the heaviness of sleep draping over his mind.
on the lot of you. Ya haven't even given the poor lass a chance to speak!” Rowena barked before stepping over to give Jess a half-hug, “Don't let these boys scare ya, love. If you want to come with me, I'll take good care of ya. What d'ya say, dear? The choice is yours.”
While Oliver was touched by Jess's compliment, a single word from her last sentence captured his attention. From the moment he heard it, he was unaware of anything else.
Jude glanced between his parents and could practically feel the love and acceptance radiating from their eyes. Deep down, even though he didn't really want to admit it, Jude
An understanding smile rested on Sam's face.
“A pleasure, senior,” Juanita said, immediately jutting her hand toward Dean, “Jane has told me all about you.”
Clare kissed Jude’s collarbone a few times as he dolloped some lube onto his own fingers and brought them down between Jude’s legs. Of course, Jude allowed it, separating his knees even further to give Clare better access. By this point, the two of them had sex so many times that this preparation was second nature. Jude knew the feeling of Clare’s fingers all too well. They were thin and gentle; a stark contrast to Clare’s erection, which was always much larger and lacked control at times. But on this occasion, Clare seemed to move even slower. His lips eventually found their way to Jude’s ear again, where his tongue flicked Jude’s earlobe.
“Damn right,” he hummed.
. And she loved her papa so much...
“The bunker garage?” Dean said, “Why?”
“You could have come
Putting on his best smile, Jude stood up from the bed and reached out to take Clare's free hand. It was all tensed up, like he was full of anxiety, but his fingers willingly greeted Jude's.
“Not as good as you,” Meg mumbled, taking in his entire outfit, “Looks like you're headed to a red carpet somewhere.”
Cas's mouth was open, allowing air to pass in and out while he panted, but his dominant face was unwavering. His eyes followed Dean's, staring the man down and making him feel like a naughty child. And Dean was moaning for Cas, letting out cries with every single bounce. He knew for a fact that Cas was enjoying this. The angel was gently thrusting into Dean as he moved, showing that he wanted to come just as much.
Jude rolled his eyes. Ugh, why couldn't Lucifer go five minutes without whining about things being 'unfair'? Wasn't he listening to anything that was being said? Instead of answering Lucifer's sassy remark right away, Grandpa raised his hand – and everyone was suddenly standing outside again. Oddly enough, Jude didn't even feel the sickening inertia from flying. When Grandpa transferred them to a new place, Jude felt great even after he landed. Now, he looked around to see where they had gone, and found Dad's Impala staring him in the face. Overhead, the sky was almost totally clear, making everything visible with the sinking sun. Clare's motorcycle was still parked next to Dad's car, uncle Bobby's truck was still across the parking lot with Jude's new blue Impala on the trailer behind it, the birthday decorations were still ruffling off the picnic table in the breeze, and even the cake sat untouched. Everything was just the way they left it. It was almost like Jude's birthday hadn't been canceled, just postponed.
Cas stepped closer too, close enough to hide the box between them. The angel's eyes were glancing around the parking lot with paranoia, as if he was afraid someone might see. But he lifted the lid anyway and gave Dean a clear view of what was inside. A couple pairs of panties were suddenly staring Dean in the face. The man gulped and briefly copied Cas in looking around before pulling the box up to inspect the contents better. Yep. It was feminine underwear, alright. Two pair in a uniform row. One strongly resembled the same pair the stupid dog had ruined, Dean's original pink satin panties. The second, however, was a thong made of jet-black shimmering lace. Oh, man, were those meant for
“He taught you how to throw it, didn't he? He taught you how to ball it up and throw it?” Dean continued, trying to get the toddler to follow.
choice of food...
“Mornin' Dad, Mornin' Papa,” Jude sang, “Have you guys seen Clarence yet?”
“This should be interesting,” Crowley purred.
“But, you didn't,” Gabriel reminded softly, his voice sounding so good against the silent parking lot, “She's sitting next to us right now, kid.”
' she imagined her Papa's voice saying to drown out the scary noises, '
Castiel brought his attention back to his own stomach as he thoughtfully observed his son.
“You're welcome,” Bobby replied.
“I'll start, darling,” Crowley promised, holding Bobby's hands firmly and looking him in the eye, “From this day forward, I vow to always be at your side and fight for you whenever it is necessary. Your heartaches will now become my heartaches. What hurts you will now hurt me. Therefore, I will protect and honor all that you care about, even if that includes those plaid-wearing morons out there,” he mumbled, nodding toward the crowd.
“Don’t be,” Bobby interrupted, shaking his head as he pulled Jessie close for a gentle hug, “Yer an honest-to-God angel, Jessie. You don’t have to be sorry for nothin’.”
Jude dropped Bumble Bee and jumped up to race over and hug Daddy, circling both arms around his warm neck. Jude loved hugging Daddy. He was strong and had big shoulders, just like Batman. Daddy patted Jude's back and laughed.
Jessie's middle name was Mary. Jude glanced back at his cousin, who was slumped against uncle Sammy in the backseat. Both of them were sleeping while uncle Gabe played with Dickie in his lap. In the front seat, Dad nodded in the mirror again.
your house. But ever since the munchkins were born, I feel like we've worn out our welcome. We
The moose-man chuckled a little bit but kept his stride. He carried Gabe without a word of complaint and Dean and Cas started leading the way again, heading in the direction of the portal that they all hoped would take them back to their kids.
“Yeah, yeah. I know. This isn't a bed and breakfast. Blah blah blah,” Gabe grumbled, “Lighten up, would you? It's gonna be like a big sleepover!”
Strangely enough, the statement made a breathless chuckle come from Gabe’s mouth. The archangel hung his head and nodded, wearing a weak smile.
Clarence flinched back with a grin, like he was prepared to take all the wrath Jessica's dad was going to throw at him. But Jessica knew that Clare was just saying those suggestive things to get her dad angry. Making people angry seemed to be his favorite pastime. Jessie ignored the purring tone of Clare's question but decided to answer him anyway.
“Yeah! Can we slide?” Oliver nearly begged.
Wanting to ease Dean's distress, Castiel flew inside the police station in the hope of catching Gabriel before he ruined the Winchester's case. In the foyer, Castiel spotted the archangel strolling to an open window, where a desk-worker was going about her business. Cas assumed that Gabriel was going to do something disappointing, perhaps tell her that the Winchesters were on their way with fake ID badges or reach through the window and try to grab something – but what Castiel found instead, was that Gabriel was actually
“It looks as though Lucifer is attempting to get our Father’s attention,” Michael deduced.
want you to be part of my family. More than anything. I just... I don't want to lose you, man. You're too important to me.”
“You don't have to worry about the future,” he said quietly, his brown eyes so comforting above the purple bubbles on his face, “I might not have any angel powers, but I can take care of you. I'll do whatever it takes to make you comfortable and happy. I'll cook for you, clean for you, take you to fancy restaurants. We can go to the water park, and the beach, and visit cities like New York and London,” he went on excitedly, “And wherever we go, we can show off our matching wedding rings. And I can say, “See that hot blonde girl? That's my wife. I married her, like a boss.”
“Ha! I
Once they were both dressed, Dean dashed over to slide open the study doors, revealing Bobby's vacant kitchen. The morning sun was cascading in brightly from the windows, making the room appear extra inviting. Dean guided Castiel to the nearest kitchen chair and sat him down before retrieving a couple of pillows from their bed. He carefully stuffed the soft pillows behind the angel's back, giving his spine some added comfort. The man also pulled up another vacant chair in front of Cas to prop the angel's feet up, removing the pressure of gravity from his already-swollen ankles. Castiel watched Dean do all of this with a radiant smile on his face, feeling as though he were floating on a cloud. Dean was such a loving caretaker and his nurturing nature only made Castiel adore him more and more.

"Castiel." The angel whispered, as he leaned in closer.
Father once taught them how to defend and became one of the greatest warriors of Heaven, always put their missions first on top of everything else. Castiel had killed, smite, and led armies as they fought in the War of Heaven along with the other angels in his garrison.
I’m investing all of my savings to keep buying you pies.” Cas joked, voice groggy from his deep sleep just few moments ago before Dean decided to ride him in ecstasy. Dean just smirked in that sexy way of his, loving the way Cas’ thick fingers massaging the inner part of his thighs.
“It's fine, Dean. It's not your fault.”
, fate was really siding up with them when he discovered he'd gotten into the same university as Benny. He remembered knowing it from Sammy just a day after he'd finished with his heat. He couldn't help a fresh gush of slick at the news making his younger brother grimaced with
Cas smiled in that little quirk of lips before he voluntarily dropped his forehead onto Dean's shoulder with a sigh followed.
Jessica opened her mouth and turned toward the door to call for someone older to give them advice – but found uncle Cas already standing in the pantry doorway. Raw professionalism was draped across the angel’s expression as he shoved himself into the tiny room.

“We were –
“I don't care!” Gabe interrupted Sam's comments by shaking his head, “We're gonna eat this cake whether you like it or not, Moose!”

“Dude. Not in front of the k
The angel replied with a quiet 'alright' as Dean ducked inside the bathroom. The man quickly went about his business, tugging his pants down to free his dick and let the urine start flowing. As the pressure was being released from his bladder, Dean sighed. Man, he had a crazy day today. His emotions had gone for a roller coaster ride, bottoming out just to shoot back up. And the extremes had left him feeling exhausted. At least he would get to fall asleep next to his angel, now...
“Drink this, honeydew!” Papa said, holding a water bottle toward her mouth.
"Sure," Jude answered.
After a few seconds, though, Jess felt her own hands slide down to crawl under the hem of Oliver's shirt. Her fingers slowly inched up his heated stomach and to his bare chest, where she could feel his heart beating. In so many of her future dreams, Ollie's heartbeat was the main focus. Many times, Jess dreamed of laying her head on his chest and listening to the sound, while they lay naked on their marriage bed. None of it had actually happened yet, of course; those were things that were still to come. But the comforting, relaxing feeling of it still lingered in her mind. Being intimate with Oliver was Jessica's greatest stress reliever.
“What were you talking to them about anyway?” Gabe spat, “Was it about how you decided to make a beer run in the middle of the freakin' apocalypse and abandon your own kids? How you left them to deal with all the consequences while you laid around on a beach somewhere drinking booze from a coconut? Huh?”
“We?” he asked.
“Now, the trick is to get it pretty tight around the waist without cutting off circulation,” Gabriel informed, sounding like an expert.
The light in the hallway burned Jude's eyes as he stumbled toward Dad and Papa's door. He gave a tiny knock before proceeding to walk in. As he suspected, his Dad was still asleep, snoring loudly in nothing but his boxer briefs and clinging loosely to Papa, who sat up straight on the bed when Jude entered the room.
Sam turned to give the car a glance and look at the archangel in the front seat. The tall kid scratched the back of his head and sighed like he was worried.
“We totally get it, Jane. We would be the same way with Jude and Jess,” Dean agreed.
“I just wanted you to know that this man saved my life,” Clare went on, “I'm marrying him tomorrow. And I'm fine, now... Thank you so much for taking care of me. Especially when no one else would. I love all of you. And I know I'll see you again some day.”
“Y – yeah,” Clarence agreed with a massive grin and glistening eyes, “I'm right here, Jay!”

“For the last damn time!
Michael pursed his lips and nodded once, eying the scythe with disdain. Gabriel’s small hand tightened around the wooden shaft, gripping it like a vise.
When Sam and Gabe finally got home from their school interview with the Impala, Dean swiped his keys back and hopped in to go get the rest of the groceries on the shopping list. He and Cas didn't get to finish it the night before because the kids were wired to the max, so he planned to get it done today before they ran completely out of milk and fruity pebbles; Jessica's favorite breakfast food. Plus, Dean knew that getting out of the bunker and being by himself for awhile might actually help him. Ever since that stupid thing happened in the garage at Oliver's party, he had been in a weird emotional funk. He tried not to let it show on the outside, of course, because he didn't want Cas or Sam to worry. But man. Those slandering words really cut him to the bone...
Sam stood up straight and blinked several times, feeling confused and at a loss for words. Making this portal involved strong elements of dark magic and it left Sam wondering why Bobby would ever go to such lengths to insure a trip to hell. Bobby knew better than anyone that dabbling in dark magic was dangerous. Would he still be willing to get to hell if it meant putting himself in harm's way?
The question gave Lucifer a stir of emotion. It would be easy for the devil to say ‘yes.’ The nephilim would sleep and disappear forever, then Lucifer would finally have the peace he had always wanted. But something was preventing him from saying it. Maybe it was the touch of guilt that Michael’s tears left in Lucifer’s system. Maybe a spark of sympathy had been struck within him. Maybe because they were both stuck in the same predicament, but the nephilim had lost much more. Whatever the case, the devil felt that he couldn’t let the nephilim go to sleep.
“Sounds like your grandpas are awake,” Jess mentioned to her daughter.
The dog barked back and eventually broke free from Sam's hold. He jumped into the floor and raced over to the side of Crowley's throne, where he sniffed and licked at a particular space of air. Sam quietly sneaked away from the group of people to go after the dog, wandering what he was doing. It wasn't until Sam heard
Jude squinted his eyes. Jessie couldn't stay in the pillow fort with some people? Who was he talking about? Uncle Gabe let out an angry breath before crawling toward uncle Sammy.
Meg smiled a little and eventually made her way over to sit down. Clare could tell just from the lack of motion on the bed that his mother didn't weigh very much at all. She was extremely skinny and pale – just like he had been when he first started his own rehabilitation. Meg took a deep breath and finally removed her hands from her pockets so that she could stare down at them.
Gabe’s head raised up and he finally looked at Sam for the first time that night. Tears were glistening in his eyes and his jaw was tight.
, Dean thought to himself,
“Me too, Jude,” Ollie gulped behind him, “But you... you said you can fly, right? So fly us home!”
“My cousin Tony has an original '61 Lincoln Continental,” one of the guys mentioned, sounding proud of himself, “Not a spot of rust on it.”
Cas glared at Dean for a few more seconds, holding fistfuls of Dean’s shirt and jacket, before he whimpered and buried his face into Dean’s shoulder. Dean instantly wrapped both arms around Cas at the weird angle, trying his best to comfort him. Cas’s behavior suddenly made sense. The reason Cas kept Dean locked away wasn’t because he didn’t trust Dean or his skills, but because he couldn’t stomach the thought of losing him again. Dean’s death in this universe had a catastrophic impact on Cas’s entire being, and now that Dean was back again, Cas was going to do everything in his power to save him…
Castiel cleared his throat and pressed his own hand a little harder against the skin. The cells had already begun to group into organs by now, sprouting out from the fetus's fragile spinal structure.
“The sky is sad,” Jessica mentioned over the roar of the Impala's engine.
What was causing that strange sensation?
The angel's head tilted a bit as he listened to the man speak. His voice was faintly familiar. The pitch was a bit lower than Castiel remembered, but yes. Cas had heard this man's voice before. Perhaps the man had been out of breath the first time Castiel heard it, because the angel was suddenly imagining strenuous noises mixing with his voice. Did Castiel hear this man moan before? It seemed highly possible...
“I agree with Pinky,” Gabriel said, planting his hands in his hips, “I've got places to be and a moose to do. Somebody toss me a garden hose.”
! :D Yep! That is exactly what you think it is. Their first night as a married couple and Jess and Ollie make more than just a little magic. They make a whole baby! Lol! And yes, I totally stole that line from the first chapter of “Purpose.” (Is it stealing if you steal from yourself, though? Lol!) XD Btw, the Spanish that Ollie said in this chapter is supposed to translate as: “My love, My angel, My wife, I love you” ;) So, obviously there is going to be more to this story. We still have Jude and Clare's wedding, as well as the rest of Jess and Ollie's new predicament to see. (I'm sure Sam and Gabe will be

Dean couldn't help but silently marvelled at the perfection of the angel's side profile complimented with a set of strong jaw. He suddenly imagined leaving trails of kisses on that skin but soon distracted from the reverie when Cas said,

The whole day
After another few sharp breaths and hips grinding—those beautiful blue irises gradually came into view whilst Cas finally opened his eyes.
Dean fell into depression just a year ago, but Benny—the perfect alpha he was—always been there for him. He was patient with Dean's crazy random moodswings, and he was still solidly just there whenever the nights Dean wanted to be held and loved again. Then when Dean went missing for a week, Benny kept calm and searched for him to bring him home again even when Dean's scent was mostly sour and pungent in distress. It was Benny who managed to bring him back to the end of the tunnel, where the light shone the brightest. Benny was there, with him and waiting for him to regain his strength. To be Dean again.
he almost blacked out and came untouched as he rode on the euphoric pleasure. He swore on the Impala, he never felt as satiated and well fucked as he is right now.
This was his third meal for the day, when he one day suddenly
His wings—tucked closely into his body, only to be unfurled and spreaded wide when he felt like flying again. Some days he just spent most of the time, by walking on feet and actually mingled with some humans. It actually shocked him at first—when a good–looking young man walked up towards him in a bar and asked for his number, said that he had been interested in knowing him. Dean smirked at first, totally had the sudden desire to just manipulate the man and then have his way with him; just like what he'd always done in the past. Then, he shocked himself for the first time when what he said out loud was a complete opposite of what he had in mind.
“You were dying.” He answered short.
Dean cried all the way to the hospital with his hand rested on top of his still flat belly, eyes slowly drooped before he fell asleep.
Dean remained unmoving–
Castiel liked it. How the silence was comfortable around them and with Dean's presence by his side, their thighs were so close they're touching; Castiel suddenly felt like he wanted more.
“I don't know and I don't care.”
you came.”
Well, gladfully with the unlimited golden credit card hacked by Charlie in their possession, now shopping would never be a problem anymore.
Castiel drew out his angel blade on instinct, but then the scent of red roses mixed with lilacs caught his nostrils, making him stop dead for a second.
“Oh.” Castiel fought a smile that beginning to spread on his lips.

Dean is pregnant.
Rather than that, Castiel felt…addicted. Like he wanted more than just a simple kiss on the lips. He yearned for something strong, something that could tie the demon with him and never let go. Without him realizing, his wings furled out from its hidden space; white feathers fluttered in despair.
The omega looked a bit shocked, but soon fidgeting nervously before a faint red blush dusted his fair cheeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
The omega's hazel eyes widened when he stammered out, “Tyler. Tyler Calix.”
After giving a last gaze towards the disappearing man in between the crowd, Castiel turned back towards the road, not realizing a stray of black silk feather that landed on his shoulder.
"Dean, are you jealous?" Cas couldn't help but slowly broke into a wide smile that never cease to flutter Dean's heart.
“You overfed on him. You consumed some of his soul.”
She was speechless at first and totally had jumped a little in shock, before she finally gets the message. After scribbling down the orders, she bowed her head, eyes lowered in shame before she scurried away. Dean smirked triumphantly while Cas frowned at him.
Dean laughed, as he too—dressed in a simple black shirt, with his infamous hotdog pajama pants before he plopped onto the couch next to his boyfriend. He hissed—however, soon as his ass landed not too gently on the cushion.
The last time he remembered was, the light brown trench coat and dark suited angel, but this time he was apparently met with a different version of the angel. Dressed in a set of all black three–piece suit, the angel looked so
"Ah fuck—I'm fucking close," The man grunted, his deep voice moaning sounded so beautiful in Dean's ears as he rocked into that tight hole again, hitting that one spot inside before he came with a hard last thrust; filling the man's wet channel with his thick release.

“Mama! Mama!” The boy began again, small arms wrapped tightly around Dean's neck.

please." Dean then—not so gently, slammed down the menu he held onto the table, their mugs rattling on the surface and stared up to give her one of his fakest smiles as if he didn't just caught few pairs of eyes to himself upon the apparently loud sound.
“Benny...I'm—I'm sorry!”
"Dean. What was that all about?" Cas asked, handsome face looking a slight confused.
“Thought I could get a shot since you're
Goddammit, Dean couldn't wait to tell his alpha.
His eyes zeroed on a hospital building few blocks away.
He stammered, “Y—yeah, I'm good. So, uh, yeah. You're in a hurry so...”
The bed gave a constant creaking sounds and Cas began to palm the delicious curve of Dean's ass. Shit, he'll never get enough of it.

“It was me, isn't it? I'm sorry I didn't tell you about bringing them in advance. They tagged along and I can't actually leave them—”
“I've been watching you,” She said, adjusting her blood–red suit, before dusting her equally red dress pants which matched the red of her lips and the rest of her attire down to her red laced shiny dress shoes, leaving her long black hair fashioned in a high ponytail as a stark contrast. She slipped her hands into her pants' pockets; looking as sharp but at the same time casual as ever. “And I've been watching that demon

” Cas answered, though reluctantly.
The lingering thoughts of liking the smell of fresh after-rain that burns on the black tar of the road never did cross his mind.
In this case, it's the former.
The man came too, spurts of cum landed on the sheet below him and Dean landed heavily against the man's back, his dick still buried inside.
“You—” the alpha groaned, helplessly trashing around to be let go but to no avail.
There he was. Cas.
“Please tell me it's not
It's exhausting and suffocating.
This time, he gritted his teeth as he spat out in a low octave of his voice.

But then, the bell chimes and Dean couldn't help but turned and saw a red head omega, so pretty with a small child holding her hand as they went in. She made an eye contact with Dean for a brief second and smiled. Dean smiled back, just when the boy wiggling his hand to be freed from her hand and ran towards the booth
"Y–yes. We will look into this immediately and hopefully with your help we could put this on end." Cas was taken aback for a sec, but continued his act on being professional as the sheriff smiled seductively towards him.
Dean's breath hitched, unintentionally caught a few of his classmates' glances towards him. He ignored them, pretending to take down notes whilst all he got in his mind thinking was; how his ass

“Dada! Dada!” the boy exclaimed happily as he jumped enthusiastically into the alpha's arms.

for that matter. The last time he had a meal was three weeks ago but he's never been hungry or to be honest; had none of his appetite ever since then.
Castiel shook his head, then walked out from the empty class. Few sets of eyes fell on him again as he walked passing the hallway. He sighed, praying that the day would just be over soon.
Castiel just stared, but remain silent.
Smirking, he scooted closer and soon their lips met in a hungry lewd kiss. Dean moaned at the delicious scent of joy, lust and satisfaction lingered in the air as he sucked all those from the man beneath him. Soon after, the hazel eyes went dimmed, as they stared into the nothingness. Naked body went limp and only the constant rising of his chest indicted that the man was still alive albeit seemingly lifeless.
“I think we need to be ready, yeah?” Dean moved closer, both their groins touching.
insisted－ignoring how upset his own inner alpha in response to not being dominant towards Dean, but though the offer was very tempting, Dean still found himself couldn't do it.
“Cas, you okay?”
A single tear slid down his cheek as he finally realized he was crying. The small hands of the boy now cradling his face, cute little thumb caught the tears just in time.
The nurse smiled genuinely in response, before went back to her job.
“Does it make you feel better if I said it was?”
The small boy still staring deeply into his eyes, not even responding to Dean's question before the kid suddenly jumped forward and before Dean react to it, the dark haired boy mashed his face into the crook of Dean's neck.
