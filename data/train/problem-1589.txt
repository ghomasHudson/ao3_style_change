“John.” A rich voice cut through the thick air, causing the strings to shake around him. He turned, his vision taking a moment to catch up with the action. He saw the vague outlines of Greg and Molly, frozen where they had been standing. “John, look at me.” There was that voice again. He turned in the direction of the voice and felt his knees go weak. Sherlock was standing before him, looking crisp and clear amongst the distorted colors.
"Thank you." Sherlock mumbled, blushing lightly as the boy grinned, shrugging and pushing his hands into his pockets.
"I love you." John whispered, shifting so he was facing the other boy as best he could. Concern flashed across Sherlock's face as he watched John, and he started anxiously chewing on his bottom lip. John felt a flare of guilt and reached over, using his thumb to gently coax Sherlock's lip from between his teeth. "Hey, what's wrong Love?"
“Goodbye Sherlock.” John pushed the vessel away from the dock, slowly drifting away from Sherlock.
“You have nothing to be sorry for Love. Now, can we please get a cab? I can’t feel my fingers.” Sherlock chuckled softly, even the tiny smile lighting up his eyes. “There’s that smile I love seeing.” John kissed him softly once more before pulling the taller man to his feet and stepping to the curb to hail a cab.
“Nothing that concerns you Mr. Stamford. Thank you for your help. You can assure Mr. Watson that his Med Bills are paid for and will be covered until he is no longer in need of medical assistance.”
They were silent aside from the occasional hiss of pain from John as the muscles repaired themselves.
“Why did you leave me?” He asked, his voice wavering as he remembered the hurt and pain he had felt when Sherlock hadn’t been there when he woke up.
“I remember my father writing in it when I was a child, telling me stories when he was sober enough to do so.” John sighed heavily, the few good memories he had of his childhood weighing on his heart. “I started writing in it when I was in the War, carrying on the tradition as best I could.”
"Of course you didn't, you are horrendously unobservant-"
“No! No, don’t do this. Please don’t, not now. I just got rid of you!” John felt panic in his chest at the image before him. He had been seeing Sherlock everywhere since he found out the Siren had died. The voice in his head talking to him and making him see his dead friend’s ghost.
“John-”
He glanced around and caught sight of an unnaturally large wolf stalking him and felt the panic set in.
“Thank you!”
“Why?” Sherlock chuckled, kissing John tenderly once more before backing away, taking out the watch from his pocket.
Sherlock felt an overwhelming pain behind his eyes and pushed his way out of John’s grip, stumbling to the bathroom and locking the door.
"Where the fuck have you been?" Sherlock flinched, blinking away tears as he heard the pain and anger in his boyfriend's voice.
"A few hours." Sherlock groaned and threw himself back onto the mattress dramatically, covering his eyes with his arm.
“No, just not interested.” Sherlock stepped away from Moriarty turning to make his way to the library, hoping the man would leave him be. As he walked away, he heard Moriarty’s companion, Sebastian, whine to him about his obsession with Sherlock.
"I-I'm flattered, Jason-"
“Mike, this is Sherlock. He saved my ass from that storm.” Sherlock nodded curtly at Mike, his eyes scanning John’s friend and his jaw clenching. If John didn’t know any better, he would say the Siren was jealous of Mikey. “Sherlock, this is Mike. We were on the same Med Unit in the War.” Mike stepped forward and pulled Sherlock in for a hug, whispering something in the stunned Siren’s ear before pulling away.
He had made a terrible mistake. John wasn’t going to hurt him. John would never hurt him.
“Sherlock-”
“I love you.” John felt Sherlock tense in his arms and he pressed more soft kisses to the younger man’s shoulders and neck.
Hey Tiny Dancer! – JW
He saw red as his fist went through the bathroom mirror.
“Greg!” Mycroft shouted as the ashes burst into flame, quickly covering Sherlock’s body in a layer of green flame. As quickly as they appeared, they were gone. Leaving the room to be filled with a thick silence.
“Get him back!”
Mike obviously hadn’t gotten the ‘No Emotions’ memo, as he spent the entire night flirting with, and clinging to John. It was obvious John had an emotional connection with the other man, as he flirted back.
“Do you read fairy-tales Sherlock?” The young man shook his head, unable to find his voice. “Well, in this little story, you are the damsel and I am the prince, and honey you should see me in a crown.” Sherlock fought back the tremor that threatened to give away his fear.
Sherlock drew his knees up to his chest, trying to keep his breathing steady. They had only been dating for a little over a month, and Sherlock had no reference as to how fast things were supposed to go. He was on the verge of a panic attack when his phone buzzed.
“Nah, I got transferred a while back. I’m working on the Intergalactic Peace Council now.”
"We should go, I uh- I made reservations at Angelo's-"
When it came to physical strength, both boys were pretty close to tied, but it was in moments like these when Sherlock found himself thanking every deity he could think of that his boyfriend was a Rugby player. The older boy was able to keep Sherlock's hips pinned against the glass with little effort as he slowly worked more of his length into his mouth.
Less than an hour later, they were standing in a private hospital room, crowded around the bed.
"Please John, I-I want to." Sherlock whispered, nuzzling into John's hand. He glanced up and met John's eyes, reading the concern there. "I-I want you."
When he arrived at Sherlock's side, he noticed that the boy wasn't stuck, and looked scared and embarrassed.
The party was loud, obnoxious, and borderline dreadful. Sherlock winced as one of the students swung from the banister, landing on the floor in a heap of screaming laughter. He shifted closer to his boyfriend's side, taking a sip of whatever mix John had handed him when they had arrived.
"You are a far cry from the timid little boy that used to play in the halls of the Royal Court."
“Unfortunately, yes. They met on set one day when Mycroft came to sign some contracts. Have been together ever since.”
“Show us.”
"Fine, I'll come. Only if you're alright with it, Mrs. Watson. I can pay for-"
“How do I switch the boat to automatic?”
They all jolted slightly when John's phone blared loudly.
“Hello Gavin.”
“Eighteen days. My company tracked me down and got me out. We were ambushed on the way out. They didn’t walk away, I did. Took me months to recover then when I did, all I could see in my friend’s eyes was pity and fear.” John looked up and met Sherlock’s eyes, blinking away the tears and taking a steadying breath.
Sherlock stood outside the door to John's flat, fussing with his shirt collar and desperately trying to ignore the voice in the back of his mind that was screaming at him to run.
“I suppose I am.” John down at the dark curls resting on his chest, running his fingers through the hair fondly.
He existed like that for many months, slowly allowing his transport to run wild whenever John cursed. It was making him miserable, but he didn't dare say anything. Things were still uncomfortable between them since Mary disappeared with the baby and John moved back in, and Sherlock wasn't willing to lose John again because he lost control of his transport.
"It's none of your concern, Greg. He's just jealous because he wanted Sherlock to go to the dance with him. Tell the guys, if anyone bothers him without valid reason, they will have to deal with me."
“Please shut up, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock looked as embarrassed as John felt as he stumbled into his flat.
“I’m sorry John.” He whispered to the unconscious man, drawing forth every ounce of power he could to solidify his body. He reached down and lifted John into his arms, carrying him down the hall to his room. John whimpered and squirmed, the intensity of Sherlock’s energy no doubt uncomfortable for him.
"The date was not boring John. I just tend to shut down when I get anxious. It's a defense mechanism." John watched the boy for a moment, trying to wrap his mind around the fact that Sherlock Bloody Holmes was his date.
Sherlock fled from the flat, John’s voice shaking his mind palace as he ran, hunting for the front door.
“I’m sorry Mike. I’ll keep in touch, I promise.”
"Hey Watson, do you know who that kid is under the bleachers? He's been there since practice started." Greg asked, nodding over to the bleachers. John couldn't help grinning when he caught sight of the boy hiding under the stands.
Panic coursed through him when his eyes met the eyes of Gregory Lestrade.
“Take me out and show me a good time, like you did back on S13 and we’ll call it even.” Mike winked and laughed as John blushed. “Alright Mate, see you soon.” John signed off and tucked his Video Cell back into his bag.
“Buddy of mine has a scar that is tainted and I’m trying to help him get rid of it.” John spun the camera to face Sherlock, clearly missing the terror on the Siren’s face. Sherlock had yet to change back to his Siren form, but he saw the recognition cross the other man’s face instantly. “This is-”
“Let’s summon Death.” John grinned, he was going to find a way to be with his Ghost.
“J-John-”
"Yes, I believe we had some classes together last year." Greg blinked, mildly shocked that the other boy remembered him.
“You didn’t know me back then John. I wasn’t a good person-”
His mind went into overdrive.
“I know, that’s why we have to be quiet and get the samples quickly. They’ll kick us off E2 if they see him.”
“Y-Yes Captain.” John grinned, kissing Sherlock sweetly before letting him go.
"Sorry-" Sherlock hurried to fix his laptop as he finally cleared his airway. "Sorry, I'm alright." John looked concerned, chewing on his bottom lip and rubbing at the back of his neck anxiously. "I just- I didn't expect that." Sherlock blushed as John smirked and leaned closer, glancing at what Sherlock assumed was his bedroom door briefly.
"My name is-"
“Oh, look at that Time, you found yourself quite the brave little soldier. That gun will do you no good Dear.” John held his ground, not even trembling. Fate was right, he was brave.
Sherlock sighed, rubbing his hands over his face and leaning back, shoving the microscope away. He was tired, frustrated, and reaching the end of his rope with this case.
“M-My heart?”
“Why are you hesitating Pet? Kill him.”
“You will need to cover his ears.” John nodded and turned to his bag, pulling out his earplugs and handing them to Mike.
"You're welcome Dearie. Would you like a ride?" Sherlock nodded and stood, shoving the bag of supplies into the duffel he had packed, and reaching for his jacket.
Once the waitress was gone, John turned his attention back to Sherlock, not missing the way the other kid was twitching restlessly and fussing with the collar of his shirt.
He had to get out of here.
The young man drifted off to sleep, his mind plagued with adrenaline and fear, tainting and corrupting memories.
"Well, she wasn't very subtle about that, was she?" Sherlock huffed, glaring at the small stack of napkins that Mary had placed beside the plate. John glanced down, blushing when he saw the number scrawled on the top napkin.
The curtain rose, revealing Harry posed on the far-left side of the stage, her arms reaching for the ceiling and head bowed. On the opposite side of the stage, her partner was curled in on them self, both students frozen until the music started.
His Beast.
"I'm too tired to argue." John laughed and pulled out his phone to text Lestrade.
"I just want you to be happy." John rolled his eyes, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to Sherlock's lips, smiling fondly when he pulled away.
“A-are y-you serious?” The Beast grinned, rubbing his hand over the back of his neck, looking sheepish.
“Yeah, your brother just called. Wants me to meet him at his office in about an hour.” John could almost feel the tension coming from the younger man as he packed up his stuff. “Hey, so I’m going to stay-”
He felt his chest tighten at the sight, his mind slowly wandering back to their conversation in the car.
“That’s not true. Despite popular belief, Greg and Molly helped me last time.”
"Don't even think about it."
He could feel the arousal pouring off the other man from across the room.
"Good, we have lots of time." John laughed as Sherlock pulled him off the car, opening the door and pushing him into the back seat.
“Here we go.” He whispered, picking up the sterling silver blade he was to use for the ritual. “Watch the door. Warn me if someone is coming.” He inhaled and drew the blade over his skin, wincing as the blade cut him. He let the blood drain from his hands, chanting a few words in Latin as he soaked the herbs in his blood. He then moved closer to Sherlock’s body and lifted his hand, slicing the palm and letting the blood flow and mingle with his own and the herbs. Once there was enough, he wrapped Sherlock’s hand tightly and set the bowl on his chest.
Once he regained some of his wits, he opened his eyes, catching sight of Sherlock, still kneeling in front of him. He hadn’t touched himself, waiting for his Captain’s command. John grinned at him, cupping his cheek and kissing him softly.
“God, please don’t call me that. It’s such an antiquated title.”
Standing beside Mikey was a tall, thin man, almost inhumanly beautiful, with dark curls and too-pale skin.
“Do you have anything new this week?”
It was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for him.
“Why is he yelling at the spoons now?”
"I'm so fucking glad that worked."
John arrived at the school, making his way to the Ballet studio. He knew he looked a mess, face covered in mud and scuffs on his jeans. He had come straight from Rugby practice and hadn't bothered to shower.
"J-John-"
"John is captain of the Rugby team, actually." John blushed as Sherlock smiled proudly at him.
"No, Eurus, this isn't your fault-"
“There is fluid in his lungs. Prep my needles, I need to extract it.” Greg leaped into action, using the heat from his flame to sterilize the instruments. John cleaned the wounds on Sherlock’s chest and thighs, taking extra care to ensure the skin around the injuries was cleaned and ready for him to pierce it with his needle.
He felt the familiar surge of energy in the tips of his ears and looked forward, barely catching sight of the massive energy wave looming over him before it crashed into him. He was knocked from the boat, falling through the stars as the storm absorbed all the gravity in the surrounding skies.
“J-John?”
“That’s none of your concern.”
“I agreed to let you summon Death so you can try to bring me back into a life that I deliberately removed myself from. Why would I do that for anything else but love?” John felt his cheeks burn, knowing that was the closest thing to a complement he would ever get from Sherlock Holmes.
"Sherlock, I don't have time to help you find your missing coat-"
“So, you love me too?” Sherlock stared at him as though he were mad.
"Oh well, say hi to him for me, will you? Come on, the team wants to meet you." Greg jogged away, calling for the team.
"Fuck what everyone else thinks. They're just jealous of us." Sherlock chuckled, dropping his head against his boyfriend's shoulder and giggling. "I don't blame them, I'd be jealous too if you were with someone else." Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's neck, blushing and hiding his face as he felt John begin to laugh along with him. "Seriously though Babe, where have you been? Do you know how worried I was?" Sherlock sobered almost immediately, guilt pushing at his chest uncomfortably.
"I have condoms and lubricant." That seemed to shock John, and the shorter boy blinked up at him. Sherlock blushed and glanced down at his feet. "Mrs. Hudson was concerned about me." John snorted, dropping his head against Sherlock's chest and giggling.
“Is he going to die?”
“You really love this John, don’t you?” Sherlock nodded, knowing it was irrational to love someone he had never actually met before. Victor knelt before him, a soft, sad smile on his lips and he gripped Sherlock’s hands in his. There were tears in his eyes as he looked at Sherlock. “Then go, be happy my beautiful enigma.” He kissed Sherlock once more before fading from his sight, leaving him cold and alone, lost in his own memory.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
He was quickly surrounded by wolves, the largest standing directly in front of him, teeth bared and fur standing on end.
“Your Sherlock Holmes is dead John. Time to move on.”
"Can we please go inside now? I'm starting to get rather cold." Sherlock mumbled, nuzzling closer. John felt his boyfriend begin to tremble from the cold and hugged him a little tighter.
“I-I was-” Sherlock hesitated, unsure of how to explain why he was there. “I was out for a ride and I lost the trail.” He explained simply, deciding to keep his secrets to himself.
“Damn it Sherlock, we promised your family we would be there on time. Now, you are going to get dressed, go hail a cab, and we are going to sit through your family’s dinner like adults.”
"I eat when I need to."
"And so the shining knight comes to his damsel's rescue." John froze, the voice echoing through the studio sending a spark of anger through his mind.
As he lost consciousness, he heard the rumbling voice of The Beast cursing and felt his head connect with the stone.
“Fine. I still have some friends down at New Scotland Yard. Want to help me solve crimes? I used to be pretty good at it.”
Fate was lying on the ground writhing in pain as she clutched her chest. The air was crackling with a red energy and Sherlock could feel a dreadfully familiar presence. John still stood where Sherlock had been thrown from, his gun now aimed at a different corner of the room. Sherlock glanced back at Fate and noticed the wound in her chest. That wasn’t right, John’s gun shouldn’t have done more than knock her back slightly.
"Babe-"
He had failed, and now Sherlock was dead and John was alone.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asked, and if Greg hadn't known better, he would have believed the boy was genuinely concerned.
"Sherly, so listen, I was thinking about what you said the other day-"
“I just wanted to tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed filming with you today.” His voice was soft and sincere as he brushed his fingers along John’s cheekbone.
Sherlock's feet were covered in blisters and the skin was torn along the side of his big toe on his left foot. John sent a disapproving glare at the younger boy, who blushed and chewed his lip.
He stepped closer to John, taking his hand and smirking at the look of shock that crossed John’s face. He let himself be led to the middle of the floor. John swung him around, pulling him into his arms and holding him firmly against his chest.
When their lips met, John pulled away almost immediately.
Then he came home to find one of the science textbooks flying towards his head.
"D'ya mind, Mate?" John growled, the warning tone he used barely phasing the new boy, who merely glanced briefly at him before focusing on Sherlock again.
He found himself in a darkened hall, the walls looking ancient. There were deep gauges and slash marks in the concrete walls and floors. The tapestries were shredded and there were paintings on the floor. It looked like a battlefield.
"I love watching you dance." John growled in Sherlock's ear, placing a soft kiss just under the corner of his jaw, grinning when he heard the dancer's breath catch.
"I love you too."
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock tenderly, a slow slide of lips that spoke of the love coursing through his veins. He traced the shape of the scar on the Siren’s chest, where Moriarty’s blade had pierced his body and almost took him from John. Sherlock in turn ran his hands over John’s body, tracing the scars the torture had left on his skin. He felt the Siren start to shake beneath him and he moved his hands, which had still not fully healed from the damage they sustained, and ran his fingers through the Siren’s curls, gripping as much as he could. Sherlock looked up at him and John saw the pain and fear in the creature’s eyes and pressed a soothing kiss to his lover’s lips.
Sherlock clung to John's shoulders, gasping as John broke the kiss and moved his lips down to his neck, nudging Sherlock's chin out of the way.
“Stop it Mikey!” John snapped, spinning around to yell at the other man, his torn hand forgotten.
“John I-”
But I think it may have something to do with seeing my bf in tight shorts – SH
“Because this is what I do John!” Sherlock shouted, gripping at his curls and pulling. John could see the panic in the younger man’s eyes and suddenly understood. “I say things and I hurt people and I don’t give a fuck about who I hurt!” Sherlock’s chest started heaving as he appeared to forget how to breathe. His long legs gave out and John caught him before he could hit the ground, gently lowering him onto his knees in the middle of the cold street.
"Y-You mean- you want me to- really?" John grinned and nodded, leaning up and kissing his new lover softly.
Well....that's all folks!! Hope you enjoyed it!!! This was probably my favorite of all the AUs I've written so far (I'll post my others soon)
"Backseat, I have something for you." John climbed out of the car, ignoring the slightly irritated huff the other boy sent him. He slid into the backseat, reaching into his jacket pocket and breathing a sigh of relief as he felt the item he had hid in there. Sherlock also slid into the backseat, his cheeks slightly flushed and an amused smirk on his lips.
Sherlock let his hands wander timidly, ghosting them over John's sides and back before wandering into his hair. The soft sounds John had started making as Sherlock touched him, told him that his actions were appreciated.
“A little less, what?”
"John-"
“You remember the story?” Sherlock asked, suddenly turning to face John, the concern evident on his face.
“Of course.”
“Neither are you, Sherlock Holmes.”
“John.” Sherlock whispered, sounding as breathless and wrecked as John felt. “Talk to me John. Please say something.” John could hear how ragged his breathing had become and had no doubt he looked completely disheveled. He managed to make one of his arms move, wrapping his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him close, lips just barely brushing the Siren’s.
“Yeah Mate, your heart stopped. You’ve been out for almost a week.” John felt his chest tighten. He shook his head, breathing in shakily and feeling an uncomfortable weight on his lungs.
“I don’t want to be with anyone but you Sherlock.” The taller man grinned and pulled John off the wall, dragging him down the hall until he found a supply closet. The pair stumbled in, Sherlock abruptly pinning John to the wall. John felt the air get knocked from his lungs as Sherlock latched roughly onto his neck, biting and sucking a dark purple mark there. “Jesus Sherlock! W-We can’t- someone will hear us.”
"Thank you," he finally says, weaving politeness into his tone. "I'm sure it'll be delicious."
"I heard you… Sherlock," John says quietly. He reaches out, hesitant, evidently not quite sure if he’s welcome. In the end, he settles a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "I didn't plan it. I didn't plan to be with you and then push you away. I just… I didn't decide on some expiration date, I didn't invite you over because you were leaving. It just felt safer to know if I ruined this, if I screwed this up, and I wouldn't have to avoid you for the rest of my life. I've enough things to try to avoid in my head, hm?"
"Not really. He's recovering, but…" You sigh, watching how his breathing deepens. His position looks uncomfortable; he'll have a crick in his neck in the morning. You need to wake him up and get him to bed.
Suddenly, there is a burst of activity behind them, orders being barked out.
What had it been about? You know better than to ask. The way he's coiled into himself telegraphs both embarrassment and fear. He hates it when his logic betrays him.
She continues, pushes on despite her unease. "I never wanted him to find out; we decided it was for the best. Why make a deal out of something that was never… that wasn't even…"
"So, are you here for some work, or…?"
The man should know better than to attempt small talk with Sherlock, who loathes it.
"Prep her for the CT," Sherlock commands dryly.
They drive to the lighthouse which juts up like an ivory phallus out of a northwest headland. John says there are two small islands just off the shore inhabited by lots of birds, but they're not visible from the gravel path to the door since the headline cliffs are so high. Limestone formations which look like tidepools surround the lighthouse, but the water cannot have reached this high in hundreds of thousands of years. Soft moss grows on the limestone slabs with only the occasional small, low flower stem sticking out. The wind is harsh, and the violent breaking of waves creates a constant churning ambient sound somewhere below.
— Florence Welch
Angus taps his nose conspiratorially. "River says er week, if yer lookee."
"Which makes you less prejudiced than most. Or wilfully ignorant."
Sherlock is impressed by how long it takes for the line to go slack.
He coughs weakly, his lungs then heaving.
"Can you drive?"
Industrial metal pounds like a heartbeat in the narrow corridor as they make their way back to the main floor. Sherlock straightens his form and sniffs as he follows Christian to the cloak room, the cocaine already taking effect and accelerating his decision-making.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock enunciates slowly to drive the point home, then fishes out his phone from a jacket pocket to shut Lestrade out.
I have questions. I don't have questions. I just want to get out of here, with these medications stuffed into my pockets so that people might assume, at most, that they're just packets of cigarettes.
"I didn't insinuate that you should have explained to him the details, just that it is not harmful for a child to see their parents emotional when there is cause for it. The pregnancy was not planned, then? The boys didn't know that you were expecting?"
"No, no, he never found out, either. He was at Harrow, and we didn't want to distract him from schoolwork. No benefit to him worrying about his Mummy. He knows Sherlock spent five days away, but we told him it was to help him adjust to Harrow in his big brother's wake. Mikey seemed to believe us."
You realise she doesn't know. To you, she's more than a landlady but still a landlady; to Sherlock, she is clearly a dear friend. You secretly enjoy watching them interact; Sherlock never speaks of her with the exasperation reserved for his parents. From her, he allows such open caring and mollycoddling you doubt he'd welcome from anyone else. She's a chosen surrogate parent, someone who sees him,
"You're not just saying that? It really does… that?"
Sherlock can't help the smile creeping up. "I'm sure I would have said the same, watching you in your old element, so to speak."
There is a bit of sheepish hesitation from her son-in-law, then a chuckle. "He keeps leaving his phone on silent, says that if someone important needs to reach him they should know to text, instead. He's buried his head in the latest issue of one of his neurosurgery journals and keeps forgetting to eat any of his breakfast. I can take the phone to him if you'd like?"
You didn't stand up and cross the expanse of the floor to kiss him. That day will come, but it wasn't time for that yet. This is you and this is Sherlock, and steps need to be taken in the right order so that he can savour them, categorise them, understand them and make sense of them in a way that he can weave into the rest of his existence. He needs you to understand that — a step into a relationship for him is as momentous and earth-shattering as the shaking of the core of your sexual orientation was for you, which he brought forth.
"Well, there's also the fact that I like to see my patients doing well. Satisfaction of a job well done et cetera."
Sherlock had spent the morning exploring the ruins of Noltland Castle east of John’s house. Dating to the late 16th century, the fortress’ main parts are well-preserved, but most of the adjacent buildings and structures are nothing but a crumbling ruin. The multitude of gun loops and the thick walls bear testimony to what a formidable stronghold it had once been. New wooden staircases have been added for visitors that lead from the massive kitchens to the upper floors. A plaque had explained that the castle was meant to have three functioning floors, but only the second floor had been finished and used. Bloody skirmishes had been fought to gain control of it, draining the resources needed for construction. Standing in the courtyard, Sherlock had imagined the shouts of soldiers, their swords clashing as they struggled to control this rare shelter standing alone in the grasslands. Entering the great hall, he’d discovered all the roofs missing. One couldn’t see that from outside, where the castle looked much more intact than it really was. He’d found a scratched inscription barely legible on the right-hand side of the arched entrance. It read:
"I don't want to pretend his sister never existed. I want her to be a part of this family. Don't I have to a duty to
"Fock you," the younger man replies with a smirk.
"There's such a huge difference between before and now. Hard to see how to bridge the gap."
(See the end of the chapter for
[family drama, post-S4]
, John thinks.
So you go to him, sit next to him, and pull his form against you. He's a mound of bones wrapped in a duvet of Egyptian cotton, which has probably cost more than a surgeon's monthly salary. You wrap his arms around you, and he fits there like no one has ever fit, and you can't even fathom how you once wouldn't accept the fierce protectiveness you feel for what it is: love.
John and I both burst out laughing, and I turn the photos around to discourage further scrutiny. She's right. My only attempt at Christmas preparations last year, assisted by Mrs Hudson, did produce somewhat… crispy results.
Sherlock has no idea whether he's explained himself properly — whether any of his explanations sound convincing. He feels guilty even though he's done nothing wrong.
John is certain that Lestrade's visit into the OR was related to the incident with the Serbian patient and he's glad that the man is looking out for his subordinate like this.
The car ride was followed by a sleeper train compartment in the company of a broody, walk-in-fridge -sized agent as Sherlock's pretend-I-don't-know-you berthmate, then another tediously predictable black car. Finally, he was ordered to stand on a wind-beaten pier while being strapped into a life vest by an agent, as though Sherlock was some toddler in dungarees incapable of executing such a simple task without unremitting oversight. Then came the RIB that bounced him violently towards what he deduced would be one of the Orkney islands. Knuckles white, he had squeezed the safety rope on the rounded side of the large-for-its-type army vessel. Particularly spirited waves sent the boat airborne several times, and the camo-textured cagoule which he'd been supplied with had not prevented his trousers and socks from getting wet. It speaks volumes about how tight intelligence service budgets are that they'd even confiscated the garment before dumping him on the shore.
After deciding that two minutes of waiting is enough to demonstrate who holds the power over the proceedings this morning, John rises to his feet, squares his shoulders, snaps his jaw up into the same angle he'd use at parade rest, and begins his workday.
. He's found what he was looking for except the most important answer — one that no one can give him — the answer to
Mycroft's answer had shaken him out of his reverie: John isn't coming to Zurich just for one night.
He clears his throat.
"I’m afraid that won’t be possible." The Ward Sister straightens her back. There’s a sense of a face-off as both study the other’s expression.
Here, nobody expects anything from him. It's only at night when the loneliness feels chokingly oppressive. Here, there is nothing but space and peace and quiet. Had London provided a white noise he could use to drown out the essence of himself during those long hours he spends tossing and turning in bed? At least here, he sleeps in longer increments than just an hour at a time.
"In order for us to accept the love others want to give us, we have to accept ourselves and that we deserve that love. I could tell you how proud and overjoyed I am about the conversations you've had with your mother and John, but it's more important whether you feel that pride without my influence. Have these conversations changed the way you see your skills and role in your marriage?"
"Of course not."
"With what?"
"Why?" There is a sharp challenge in Sherlock's tone.
unless things change. Out of the question." They'd had a session two days prior, and Sherlock had been willing to admit that nothing seemed to have improved.
"Why are you two staring at me as though expecting me to spontaneously combust?" he asks indignantly.
Once Violet steps aside to let him out of the hall, he drags his belongings upstairs to his old room and crumples into a heap on the bed with his shoes still on. He knows he should take the suit he'd brought for tomorrow out of his carry-on, hang it up. It's the one he'd bought for Sandhurst. All that feels such a long time ago. He suspects it might not be such a perfect fit anymore; he's lost weight. He can tell John has been biting his tongue trying not to comment on his eating habits.
"Sir, I need you to remain calm and address Tactical Command with your questions. They're––"
going to the GMC signifies the opposite, doesn't it?" John accuses.
Suddenly, an idea occurs. Instead of trying again to coax him to take off his coat, she grabs her own from a hanger on the wall near the kitchen only a few paces away.
"I am merely guaranteeing that the Commonwealth can sleep easy," the senior spook comments dryly, then pours himself a glass of water. "In case you are interested in the rest of the results: all normal — for the likes of us, I should add."
"Good. Don't forget your trousers when they arrive," Joanna teases gently. "I can see reflected in that wardrobe door mirror that you're only wearing one third of a suit."
She rearranges her legs so that her ankles are slightly to the side. She's always felt uncomfortable crossing her legs; it wasn't how she was taught to sit as a young girl. "It sounds as though you think I already made the right decision by refusing to let him read those hospital records."
Holmes?"
Helena walks in at that moment, a fresh, sterile dressing still in its packaging in hand. "Um, Mister Holmes––"
who he is, not
"We're not. You just… you never sleep this long," John babbles.
"And you are entitled to expect the same from him. You deserve the same from him — even when you can't strive for perfection, either. That's what in sickness and in health in wedding vows means, Sherlock: it is
"––Scotland, you've looked like someone pissed in your whisky. Did something happen out there?"
Sherlock is shaking, and it has to be from nerves since he's got to be pretty warm under the zipped-up coveralls and that ridiculous orange blanket still on his shoulders.
is concerned with what the defendant was thinking at the time he committed the
, the DI mouths, and Sherlock wants to slap him.
"––flatmates!" Sherlock blurts out.
That's when Sherlock's rage boiled over and he shoved his brother against the wall, making the headphones perched on a bison skull hung up on the wall rattle. "You could have told me!"
"You went through something very upsetting yesterday," Joanna explains patiently, seeking eye contact with Sherlock. "I was worried about you, and since we didn't have any appointments booked, I thought I'd call on you."
'Oh, it just takes time.'
"That, just now, that was awkward."
he almost says, but it's not the same, is it? Not at all. Victor was just… Victor.
"Thirsty?" you suggest. "We could get you some ice chips, maybe a bit of water."
He notices an email notification — it's a communique from Vandersteen, a link to a recent interview article with a GMC representative.
There's no official waiting area for the surgical unit, and you can't really wait at the East intensive care unit, either, since Sherlock won't officially have a bed there until the surgery ends. The surgeon had explained that Sherlock would be moved there directly from the operating room, intubated and sedated. His heart would need some time to stabilise before he could be allowed to wake up. This seemed to unsettle Sherlock more than the surgeon's brief descriptions of the phases of the operation.
Violet had come here with a purpose, yet now, she finds herself rather tongue-tied. How does one segue into such personal matters with a near-stranger? How on
Silence reigns. Their eyes do not meet, but John doesn't physically recoil from the question. His taciturnity must be the best answer Sherlock's going to get, then. He tries to contend with it, but still feels that nagging pull of curiosity that's always been his vice. He knows he cannot tear down the shroud John hides his secrets under, but he still itches to try.
The problem is that it doesn't fit into this flat’s aesthetic, with its marble and chrome and severe black sofas John can never quite find a comfortable position to sit in.
Sherlock isn't sure anymore. The composer had even gone as far as to state that the piece was the epitaph to a suicide he'd been planning. It's not sad in some bourgeois, unimaginative manner — no, it perfectly encompasses the perfect storm of desperation and urgency and grief and frustration and the sense of being trapped and trying to escape that Sherlock feels right now.
Bad brass decisions and Ranger arrogance eventually came to bite them all in the arse: half the Rangers were eventually struck down by the infection. If a rift had opened during the first weeks, the base — and, by extension, the Atlantic coastline — would have been royally fucked. Rangers were a fit and healthy bunch, but the virus — much worse than the annual influenzas — hardly cared about that. If anything, it seemed to strike those with the strongest immune systems the hardest. Two Rangers are currently in intensive care, and one at the HDU unit and two are languishing right here at the infirmary under John's watchful eye. Since he isn't going to strap into his battle station in the Ravager anytime soon, he'd volunteered to be one of the makeshift hospital unit's physicians. The dojo's patients have symptoms which don't require oxygen therapy or more invasive respiratory support, but they're still pretty sick: high fevers, intense muscle aches, racking coughs. John, three Med Bay doctors, twelve nurses and two medical technicians administer medications to lower fever and to help with the miserable general malaise, infuse intravenous fluids and give boluses of antiemetics to those whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea. They also do regular oxygen saturation checks of the patients whose respiratory systems are the worst affected. They've had to transfer sixteen patients to Med Bay in the time the temporary unit has been functional, and there have been four deaths.
”I’ll be waiting,” you promise. ”I’ll be at the ITU when you wake up. You won’t be alone. I promise.”
"Hello, you," greets John.
Sherlock seems to be in a cranky mood; no wonder John had been picking up on it throughout the day. It's a good sign, of course, that he has enough energy to whinge and act out, but it means that the
Joanna is regarding John expectantly, and he takes her coat to hang in the rack upstairs. He admires her calm; many people would be unnerved by having to negotiate such a mob scene of media as she just has.
," Sherlock says pointedly. "Does the backflow... cause... the pulmonary congestion?" This question is directed at Mike.
. Why would anyone envy a medical science one-trick pony who cannot even manage the daily minutiae of a romantic relationship?"
"Why would they accept me? Out of all the
Two floors down in another wing, you find the right theatre unit. The doors are locked, of course, but you hide your visitor pass and since the consultants all wear civilian clothes when not in scrubs, you simply jut up your chin and stride in after a cleaning lady who opens the door with her key fob. You don't ask anyone for the break room since that would just prompt them to inquire about your identity. Thankfully, you've spent enough time in OR units to be able to tell where the staff foot traffic and conversation points towards areas where patients are not present. The break room is smallish, with two microwaves and old sofas and a desk with two laptop computers. A toilet in the corner of it flushes, and it's none other than Marsh who walks out. You met him only briefly, and you were very focused on Sherlock, then, but if there's one thing where your skills of observation have always served you well, it's in remembering faces.
“Oh?” He tried desperately to sound nonchalant, but the tremor in his voice was unmistakable.
“Well, that was-” John’s words were cut off by a flash of light and a giant puff of smoke filling the air between them.
“No. I must have dropped them.” Sherlock mumbled, stumbling to the black door and pounding on it. “My Landlady should be home.” Sure enough, the door swung open to reveal a sweet older lady.
"No! He didn't attack me, verbally or physically. Sherlock attacked him. If you guys go after him we could all get in shit. Stay out of it Greg." Sherlock could see that Greg wanted to protest, to defend his captain, but the other boy simply nodded. John then spun to Sherlock, the frustration and concern in his eyes nearly making Sherlock ill with guilt. "Same goes for you. Unless he attacks you physically, you stay away from him, got it?" Sherlock blinked rapidly, glaring at the floor and nodding slightly.
Sherlock looked around desperately, catching sight of something that made his blood run cold and his stomach tighten.
“-Internal injuries or a negative reaction to medication.” Sherlock rambled, instantly regretting speaking.
“Oi! No need to be rude!” The Siren looked at him curiously, shifting forwards and smirking lightly. His eyes were almost silver and seemed to hold the entire galaxy within their depths. “I-I just- I have some- some questions.”
"Christ Sherlock, don't go calling me that all the time. I'll never be able to keep my hands off you."
A firm knock at the door startled both boys, John sitting upright and Sherlock popping up from under the blankets, his cheeks red and an overwhelmed scowl on his face.
"You're sure about this? We can stop if-"
“Thank you, Mike.” John’s friend nodded, his image blinking from sight.
“He is nothing!” Moriarty pushed John forward, making his right shoulder snap unpleasantly and pulling a scream of pain from his raw throat. “At least, he will be, once you’re done with him.” Two men grabbed Sherlock by the elbows and dragged him into the room, the Siren not putting up any fight.
"So he's bi?"
“I was wondering if you would join me for dinner? You look absolutely ravishing tonight.” Moriarty stepped into Sherlock’s personal space, causing the young man to blush and push his hand against his chest.
"What the- oh, I'm going to kill you Watson." Greg growled, trying to turn and bolt. John laughed, grabbing his friend by the hips and shoving him forward. "I swear to God Watson, you and your fucking boyfriend-" Greg fought to escape, but despite his shorter stature, John Watson was incredibly hard to fight off.
“Let’s get home Love. We have some research to do.”
John had decided to wear nothing more than his pajama bottoms, and was currently bustling about his room, organizing his Rugby kit and bookbag.
He caught sight of a small Star Sailor barreling towards the rock.
Sherlock gets attacked and bails on John
“Sherlock? Oh dear! What happened?”
"It's a house party Mycroft, not a dinner party. Did you leave any of your t-shirts here?"
“Minimize the blood loss.”
"Hey! Freak!" It took Sherlock longer than it should have to process the voice that came from behind him. By the time he was able to react, a hand was gripping his shoulder and spinning him, shoving him roughly against the lockers.
“I-I promise. No contracts. Hell, I’ll quit too.”
John led him through the town, chattering on about some of his adventures from his army days. Sherlock watched John talk, not really hearing anything he was saying. He could see why Mike still harboured feelings for the man.
"Who's Sherlock?" John blushed as he remembered that Mikey wouldn't know about Eurus's name change.
"When I am not busy studying or trying to finish an experiment."
The Prince was hugging him.
“No, you stupid git. I never said I didn’t want to, because God, I do.” He was still slightly breathless and couldn’t resist leaning in and kissing the younger man’s pale neck. “You have a minor concussion, three broken ribs and an open wound. Sex will cause more harm than good.”
“What are the symptoms? I’m assuming it’s living tissue?”
John had managed to pull Sherlock's sweater off and was in the middle of removing his own when his phone rang, startling Sherlock. He wanted to ignore it, but it was Harry's ringtone, so he answered.
“An idiot even in death I see.”
“What are you doing?” John’s voice was tight and angry, trembling with repressed rage.
He grabbed John’s elbow and pulled him back, ignoring his protests.
John was nervous. It wasn’t as though this was his first big production, he had been asked to do a few bigger films now, but for some reason this one was freaking him out. He read the paper he had been clinging to again, making sure he was reading it right.
TRIGGER WARNING!!! Talks of abuse and suicide attempts
“Right, well I’ll see you at Baker Street then, Gorgeous.” John winked and smirked at Sherlock, pulling a flush along his neck and face, before wheeling his way out of the room.
“Why are you awake so early?” John chuckled, turning his head to kiss Sherlock softly.
"I can think of a few things." Sherlock mumbled, his blush darkening as John grinned dangerously up at him. He could see the mischievous glint in the Rugby capatin's eyes that usually meant he was about to get rogered senseless, and couldn't fight the thrill that traced his spine.
"Finished working Love?"
Sherlock was seated on a stretcher, a nurse carefully patching up a nasty gash on his cheek. He had bruises covering his face and arms, the baggy t-shirt he wore while practicing torn along the collar, revealing a new bruise mixed in with the older ones John had left there a few nights ago. He hurried to his boyfriend's side, trying to figure out what had happened.
Sherlock won the first place trophy for his troupe, the rugby team and his boyfriend cheering him on from the front row.
A small, mousy young woman, not much older than himself, answered, her face splitting into a grin when she saw him.
“A-Alright, um, what’s your name?” There was no answer, but the air in the flat suddenly got cold. “My- my name is John.” He yelped as a teacup flew at him, shattering against the wall behind his head. “Hey! Stop breaking my shit!” He snapped, feeling his frustration rising. “This is my flat now, you can stay here if you want, but if you keep breaking my stuff I’m going to have to get rid of you. Deal?” There was silence, no more books or mugs flying at his head. John nodded and went about his day, trying to come up with a plan as to how to deal with his new flatmate.
“Just accept it.”
"I did! You both were amazing! I'm so proud of you Darling." John grinned at his sister, ruffling her hair and laughing as she swatted his hand away.
"Yes Love?"
“Nope.”
“No? Keep telling yourself that.” The Spider stepped over to a table filled with glinting knives and other torture implements. John felt a morbid sense of curiosity as he watched the man run his fingers over the weapons.
“I’m sure John would disagree.” Sherlock hadn’t meant to sound bitter, but he heard the harsh edge to his words and saw the way Mike’s expression changed. “My apologies, I’m just tired from the trip.”
"You think this is fucking funny?" John shoved at the closest boy, sending the entire group back several steps back. "She could file harassment charges against the lot of you, I should fucking file them for her!"
Just thought I'd ask – JW
“I don’t mean you talk to him and piss him off-”
“Damn it! Stop moving! You’re going to hurt yourself!” the Beast growled, easily keeping the weaker man pinned to the mattress with one paw pressed against his chest. Sherlock tried to push the paw off himself, using his nails to try and cut the skin beneath the fur.
"Fine, I'd like to get to know the young man who had his hands all over my baby girl." John snorted as Sherlock recoiled, pulling himself out of Harry's grip and blushing deeply.
Sherlock stared at his phone for a moment, waiting for whatever harsh message was going to come next, but none came. He had to remind himself that John wasn't Victor, that he wouldn't do something like that.
“No! No, I don’t want to freak him out.”
“Moriarty.” Sherlock forced himself to his feet, finally catching sight of his old nemesis. Moriarty was propped against the doorway, picking at his fingernails with an evil smirk on his face.
"Patience Love, I'm going to fuck you, good and rough too, I just love watching you like this." Sherlock yelped as John brushed his fingers over his prostate before slipping them out gently. He shifted, moving to kneel between Sherlock's thighs as he reached for the expensive condoms and lubricant they kept in the bedside drawer. "You were brilliant today, solving that case like that." He smirked at the blush that rose on Sherlock's cheeks and neck, filing the information away for a later date. "My brilliant, posh boy."
“Better than, Love.” He whispered, enjoying the grin that Sherlock gave him. Sherlock glanced at his hand and his brow furrowed again. Sherlock’s hand rose to hover just above John’s, sending a strange chill along John’s spine.
“S-Sherlock-”
“Hang on to your tail Gorgeous.”
Sherlock dropped his hand to John’s scar, gently caressing the damaged skin. He leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to the mark, the simple action sent sparks along John’s spine. He gasped as Sherlock sucked ever so lightly on the skin, the sensitive nerve endings tingling. No one ever acknowledged his scar, mainly just ignoring it in favor of other parts.
“Your vocal-”
A hint of sadness flashed in John's eyes, but quickly faded as he shifted, moving Sherlock's legs apart so he could sit between them.
“Well, I’m starving. Let’s go eat, and we can discuss that tissue you wanted me to sample.” Mike draped an arm over John’s shoulders and hooked his other arm around Sherlock’s elbow and led them into the Diner.
Sherlock felt his cheeks burn and he shifted in his seat, his mind supplying an image of John that he really shouldn't be thinking about when there were people around.
John finally managed to get himself under control, wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes and giggling softly.
Once he felt confident that Sherlock was coming down, he pushed the pile of limbs off his chest before standing. He gathered Sherlock in his arms and helped him into the bathroom. He ran a shower for them both, cleaning their mess tenderly and thoroughly, taking care with Sherlock’s wound. Once they were both clean, he pulled the sleepy young man from the shower and dried him off before walking him into the bedroom.
"Fuck off, Jim." Sherlock snapped, glaring at the other boy. An officer appeared, leading Jim and another boy John vaguely recognized towards the exit. Both boys were cuffed, and each had bruises on their faces, Jim's nose looked as though it had been broken, cotton stuffed in one of the nostrils and the cartilage crooked. John smirked at the other boy as he was led away before turning to face Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes was alive.
“Hmm?”
“You know. I never thought he would do it.” A soft voice cut through the fog that had taken over Sherlock’s mind. He spun around, hunting for the source of the voice.
"I want you to ride me until your legs give out, then I'm going to flip you over and fuck you until you scream." John's eyes widened and his breath stuttered, and Sherlock felt his erection jump against his thigh and smirked.
“I belong to no one.” John growled, stepping out from behind Sherlock, drawing a gun and pointing it at Fate. Sherlock felt a pang of amusement and fear.
Sherlock watched as the creature handled the medical equipment with the precision of a surgeon. He readied a needle and some thread for sutures, as well as sterilized some bandages and his claws.
He was too young for this, living in a haunted flat. He had exams coming up and he needed to focus.
“You know, I can normally read everything about a man from his Life Force.” Moriarty was lounging in a chair across the room, running his fingers over a large console. “All I have to do is press this button.” The man pressed a large green button and John felt his body convulse in pain as the sound ripped through him. He writhed against his bonds, feeling the bones in his broken knee grind painfully. “But with you, nothing. Not even a sliver of energy within your soul.” He released John from the twisted song and came to stand before him, gripping John’s chin and forcing him to crane his neck to meet his eyes.
"Perfect. Lot's of time then." Sherlock bit his lip against a whimper, dropping his head back against the mirror as John quickly worked his leggings down far enough so they weren't in his way.
The Wayfinder and his Siren.
"Did you hear that?" you ask Sherlock. "It'll be Mike."
"Can you… not. You've been at those modern pieces for days, now," John pleads.
The piece begins with long notes on the d-string. Sherlock's vibrato is a bit shaky and uneven, making John wonder if it's a part of the piece or situational. The melody seems to be mostly in a minor key, venturing regularly into something that sounds like a hymn — not quite sad or happy but dissonant, angry, conflicted. John can't say he much likes the piece. Eventually, a cheerier section emerges, but even that soon succumbs to a cacophony of accusatory, unhinged double stops and then a passage consisting of just ominous, hoarse, pluck-like short notes. When the whole thing ends, John can't make any sense of the structure of the melody.
. And John worries that, once Roger Fairholme gets to explain why he targeted Sherlock, the press really might turn.
"A poignant description, I must admit."
You're tempted to ask if the note was hand written on MI6 stationary.
Phone clutched in his hand he tears himself to the open bedroom window because the air has suddenly drained out of the room. His lungs heaving, he gulps in air and hiccups when he's forced to try to swallow back rising bile at the same time. His stomach is churning, his head throbbing from squinting at the screen without his glasses all evening. He'd misplaced them somewhere under all the papers. He'll have to look for it in the morning.
"What do you mean?"
3D endoscopy systems and virtual reality-assisted neurosurgical microscopes have broken through in the market, and King's is in the process of acquiring such a system. That means spending time and money training their neurosurgeons to use it. Unfortunately, something in Sherlock's particular neurology makes him exceptionally incompatible with all such gadgets, giving him debilitating nausea and vertigo.
“Yes, just please, hurry.” Mycroft nodded, touching the tip of his umbrella to John’s chest. Sherlock could feel the disturbance in the air as John’s spirit returned to his body. He felt for a pulse, relief filling him as he could feel the faintest. He looked up to thank his brother, but the man was gone. “Gavin, call an ambulance. Tell them John’s heart was stopped for three minutes but is working now.” John’s friend did as he was told, and Molly came to kneel beside Sherlock.
“So?”
"Nope, just a little sister." Mycroft nodded, chewing on his lip for a moment before sighing and straightening his jacket.
That is America, imbecile – M
"I never would have pegged you as a bossy bottom." John laughed, pressing kisses and leaving marks across Sherlock's chest.
“A human can rebuild their Life Force, I can help you-” John closed the gap between them and cut off Sherlock’s words with a kiss. “Let me help you, John.”
“I missed you so much.” He whispered against Sherlock’s lips between kisses.
The steel breached the skin and slid through the muscle and tissue. He struck resistance and pressed more firmly, forcing through the barrier until the needle continued with ease. He stopped pushing in and pulled back the plunger, watching as the barrel filled with a thick, cloudy fluid.
Lestrade laughs. "Everyone's unionised, Sherlock. This isn't the nineteen hundreds."
Sherlock has never felt alone like this in London. He hadn't ever realised how the sounds of the other inhabitants of the building, the pedestrians, the cars driving by helped him feel less isolated. The darkness is different, too. Unpolluted by the city lights, it's like being draped in black velvet. Thick like molasses and alive, it is a mythical beast swallowing everything in its path. Sherlock gets up at midnight to close the curtains; he's unsettled by an irrational fear of someone looking in. There's no one here — Ardle must be tucked away in bed in the lighthouse, and birds must have retreated into their cliff and tree dwellings for the night. Sherlock has never read up on these islands, has never paid them much mind, so he doesn't know who else might be living on this rock, if anyone.
Sherlock gets in a fight when someone insults John
“What the fuck?” He shouted as he hit the floor, covering his head and looking around desperately. There was no explaining this away. Once he was certain there were no more flying objects, he rose to his feet, chewing nervously at his lip.
"You're asking me for relationship advice?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, already irritated with the conversation. Talking with Gavin was always tedious, but he had been married and was now in a relationship with Mycroft, so that made him the leading expert on relationships. "I didn't even know you were with anyone-"
Will you come? – SH
"Shut up, he did not. Now, smile and be charming. I know you can." They finally arrived at the table, and Greg made an effort to keep his eyes trained to the floor. John and Sherlock kissed and exchanged their greetings, and Greg stood as still and straight as possible. "Mycroft, you know Greg, right?" Greg forced himself to glance up, smirking timidly at the elder Holmes sibling.
Really? – JW
“Sherlock!” John watched as the taller man hit the ground. Moriarty was practically screaming with laughter as Sherlock writhed on the ground. John clambered to his feet, grabbing his gun and running to Sherlock. His medical training tried to kick in, but he pushed that aside and he grabbed the duffel back he had dropped in the corner when he had first arrived.
“Wait, y-you’re- no.” John felt his knees weaken as realization struck him. The spell had worked. They had summoned Father Time.
It was a short journey, but Sherlock stumbled three times and very nearly ran into the door frame. His mind was spinning, making it difficult for him to focus on anything other than John's hands.
"Please what Sherlock? What do you want?" Sherlock wriggled his hips slightly, gasping as the head of John's erection slipped inside him.
“Seven percent.” Sherlock’s voice came from the doorway, causing John to jump. “That was my solution. Just enough to stop my mind, but not enough to do any major physical damage.” A weight fell over John’s heart as he watched Sherlock rub at his forearm.
“Fine, but if you insist on not sleeping here, there is a spare bedroom just up the stairs. There is lab equipment on the bed, just set it on the floor for now.” John nodded and grabbed Sherlock’s cell, quickly entering his phone number.
“Yeah? Well I’m not the one getting boned by fucking Skeletor.”
“I don’t know how to sail like John does-”
John led Sherlock over to where his team had gathered, introducing Sherlock to the boys, all while keeping a protective arm around the boy's thin waist.
“Sherlock!” The young man rolled his eyes, squaring his shoulders and clutching his book tighter to his chest. He felt a hand on his elbow and was roughly spun to face the man he was trying so desperately to ignore. Moriarty stood before him, a predatory grin on his face. He scanned Sherlock’s face hungrily, leaving him feeling exposed and irritable.
“Why will I need it?”
"Probably."
Suddenly, the pain stopped. Everything disappeared, leaving Sherlock alone in the emptiness that had taken over his mind when his heart stopped.
"You threatened to let your men rape me if I didn't speak, why should I believe that I'm safe now?" John chuckled, leaning back in his chair taking a swig of the whiskey.
“Yes Love?”
That was how he first said 'I love you' to John.
“Please, help him.” Sherlock whispered, helplessness taking over his mind.
"Barely. They're trying to flush the drugs out of his system and get him stabilized, but they're not hopeful. He's in rough shape Sherlock."
“You’re the Enchantress. The one that cursed John.”
"Yeah, I got that bit." Sherlock gasped as John rubbed their hips together. "I mean, do you want to- all the way? I'll uh- I'll have to go find lube or something-"
He approached his house, tying Redbeard to the post and making his way inside. He would get some sleep and leave in the morning. He hesitated in the doorway, looking about the tiny building he used to call home. When did it get so small? So cluttered?
"Victor, Sherlock's boyfriend." John stopped fighting, spinning back to face Sherlock, confusion and a touch of hurt in his eyes.
"J-J- Daddy, f-fuck Daddy please-" His own erection was aching and leaking against his stomach, begging for some of the pressure to be relieved.
He kicked his horse into action and raced from the town, praying to every deity he could think of that he would make it on time
When the chorus started, John sang along, slightly off key, and a touch too loud, but it made Sherlock giggle so he kept going. By the time the chorus ended, Sherlock was laughing loudly and shaking his head, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
"Is he going to tell everyone?"
“Call me Mike, I’m assuming this is Mycroft?”
Pain filled Sherlock’s being, drawing him back from the darkness. He tried to scream, tried to call out for John, but nothing happened.
Then a museum tour Thursday morning before we leave – SH
"I-I'm sorry-"
"Christ, I missed you." John whispered, pressing soft kisses to whatever skin he could reach.
“If I had access to my lab back in town I could test them.” John blinked at the young man, unable to hide the smirk that played at his lips.
“Says who?”
Sherlock blinked rapidly, the pain in his head fading.
“Oh, I don’t want anything. I’m just here for the human.” Sherlock felt his stomach tighten. He felt something connect with his side, his body getting thrown across the room where it connected violently with the wall. Someone was screaming, but Sherlock couldn’t focus. His head had struck the wall, leaving him dizzy and in pain. As the fog cleared, Sherlock became aware of the screaming again. He looked back to see chaos where he had once stood.
“Redbeard!” He screamed, knowing it was futile, that the horse was probably long gone. He grabbed a large stick and scrambled to his feet, swinging at the beasts. His stick connected with the jaw of the leader, the broken bones in his wrist grinding together painfully. He realized his mistake as soon as wood connected with flesh.
“Sorry, John. I’m Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, she’s right-” John tried, but was cut off by one of Sherlock’s cold fingers.
The wolf that was on top of him was ripped off his chest, sent flying with an unpleasant shriek and a sickening crunch. Sherlock caught sight of his saviour as his vision faded away.
John walked around the body to kneel beside Sherlock, keeping the usual distance between them, but somehow seeming so much closer to the already trembling detective.
This wasn’t real.
“You’re wrong. He told me, he wants to live. He-”
He yelped when someone slapped the back of his head, turning back to glare sheepishly at his Nan, whom he had forgotten was in the kitchen.
“I hate you.” John groused as Greg danced around, throwing clothing at him and chatting on and on about what John should say and do tonight.
John broke the kiss, dropping his head back against the wall and struggling to regain his breath. Sherlock kept pressing soft kisses to his neck and what little skin he could reach on his shoulders.
“Sh-Sherlock.”
"T-Thank you."
"You don't look stuck."
"They aren't my friends."
Sherlock blushed, frowning slightly as though the question shocked him.
"Of course I'm happy John. I'm not the one that needs sex." John laughed, pushing at Sherlock's shoulder and flopping onto his back, yawning again.
“The Spider. I spent nearly a year as his personal pet before I escaped.”
“What’s wrong? Am I wrong? I’m never wrong about this.”
Sherlock’s body was still alive.
"Cap'n! We've taken down a Navy ship." John grinned, swinging his legs off the side of his bed and grabbing his hat and cutlass.
A dark growl sounded from behind him.
"Yeah, looks like it. Nothing has turned up yet, why?"
“No, I swear it. Last year you OD’d on heroin and tried to throw yourself off the roof of Bart’s. I just went to see your body last week.” John felt his heart drop, and had to back up to prevent hurting himself. He fell onto the sofa, his chest tight and heart beat far too high.
John broke the kiss, pinning Sherlock against the wall and grinning at the breathless whine that came from his boyfriend's throat. He stepped back, straightening Sherlock's jacket and winking up at the other man.
“In a manner of speaking. We were married.” Sherlock looked at her in shock. “I figured he had left that part out.” Sherlock looked back and saw John, clinging to his lifeless form.
He should have loved it, an attractive woman was attempting to snog him senseless against the kitchen counter, and his boyfriend was apparently fine with it.
"Well I'm not now!" Sherlock snapped, burrowing further under the blankets and sniffling.
“What if I don’t?”
"You are obstructing a police investigation-"
“F-Figure what out?”
“I’m not going to just hand him the reigns and tell him to fuck off! I’ll escort him to the edge of the woods and point him in the right direction.” John growled in frustration and pulled at his fur. He hated when Mycroft got demanding, it meant that him and Greg were fighting again, and John always seemed to get the blunt end of that stick.
His mind flashed back to when he used to make his own videos, before he got picked up by one of the bigger companies. Apparently, there was a high demand for short, blonde, ex-soldier types that had high stamina, and a knack for calling out orders.
“Did he rape you too? Or did he save that for your little sister?”
"It wasn't me! He must have pissed off someone else-"
“You know, it is rude to speak to someone like that. Especially when they are trying to court you.” Moran snapped, crossing his arms defensively. Sherlock felt his gut clench in fear at those words.
"Good, go put your headphones on then." Sherlock swatted him again and Harry made a sound of disgust as she slammed the door. "Come here Tiny Dancer, I want to-"
Once they were gone, John ran to Sherlock. He pulled the younger man into his arms, checking his vitals as best he could.
He knew this place.
“Sherlock, they won’t hold. And I would rather not have to hold back with you.” Sherlock let out a needy sound and kissed him again, biting at his bottom lip and sucking gently. John could feel his self control slipping with each move the younger man made. Sherlock made a noise of frustration and pushed back, sitting on his heels and tugging at his hair. He looked thoroughly dishevelled, even though nothing had happened yet.
It was strange, and wonderful, and it made John feel more alive than he had felt in years.
"-but I'm going with John." Jim finally turned towards John, a displeased sneer on his lips as he blatantly scanned the shorter boy.
“I should have been there.”
“Sherlock, there is nothing I can do. I can’t restore him if there is nothing to restore. His soul is non-responsive. It will go when time leaves his body.”
“Yes. We were slotted to film together and there was a connection. Or, he said there was at least. It was my first year filming so I took any job I could get.” Sherlock went quite for a long while, the only sounds filling the bathroom were water splashing and John pressing soft kisses to Sherlock’s neck and shoulders.
Sherlock glanced over at his flatmate, squirming in his seat as he watched the man clean whatever he had spilled.
“What do you remember?” John rubbed at his eyes, wincing as the I.V. in his hand pulled uncomfortably.
“Sherlock,” a familiar, melodic voice came through the speakers and sent ice coursing through Sherlock’s veins. “John Watson, is definitely in danger.”
John's phone buzzed, and Sherlock reluctantly let his boyfriend up to grab it.
“T-That’s not-”
"I wonder how this will affect your refact-"
“I thought you didn’t love me anymore.” John whispered, feeling the weight of the past week falling heavy on his shoulders as he dropped his head in his hands, the tears falling freely. He felt his body tingle with electrical energy as Sherlock flickered closer, wrapping his arms around John’s shaking form and pulling him close.
“You’re still planning on killing yourself.” John’s eyes filled with tears and he sighed, this is why he left Mikey.
“Advanced Chemistry Volume 1”
John was beginning to fear that Sherlock had given up.
"He was mostly recovered from the anaesthesia when he spoke with Dr Walthard, but looked wrung out by the time we got home. When I checked on him personally some forty minutes ago, he was snoring. Do you wish to speak with him? I could––"
John spots Leonie Greir walking past and call out her name to stop her.
," you promise. This is something which you can support him with, help him achieve; you couldn't help him initially because no one but a cardiothoracic surgeon could, but there is a role for you now. "Most people who go through valve surgery don't have the benefits of your age and your fitness level."
It turns out that Lestrade had seen Sherlock briefly in the OR as he accompanied Anderson and anaesthesia consultant Jo Peirce as they were taken in to replace the hostages.
"In that case, would you permit me to make an observation?"
. Sherlock bristles for a moment; he hates being reminded of his… particular traits. John probably hadn't meant it that way; he's probably just tired and in pain and thus a bit thoughtless. The insinuation still grates a bit.
Two hours later, their cheeks are warm from the wine and then bellies full from Chinese takeaway. Yawns are splitting their cheeks at an alarming rate, so it's time for bed. Sherlock goes to get John a towel from a cupboard in the hall while John enters Sherlock's bedroom and walks to the antique four-poster double bed to turn over the covers.
The toilet flushes, and soon John joins him in the bedroom again. "If you've left fingerprints on that, there will be trouble," he playfully chides, delivering a gentle slap on Sherlock's buttock before he slides the sword back into its scabbard and puts it in the wardrobe.
"I only want to do for you what you do for me. That's not too high a bar, is it?"
If Sherlock was honest with himself, what he would have preferred was for Victor to be more
It sounds like it's something he welcomes. "Sore?"
Thankfully, the fateful letter had arrived on a Friday, giving the two doctors the weekend to regroup, and thin consolation arrives in the form of a headline in Saturday's edition of The Mirror: '
John places the pile of clothes he's brought on the bed. The sound of the water running in the en suite can be heard, and it explains why his partner is nowhere to be seen.
"How about we get you some ice cream, then get back to the hotel and just talk some more?" John suggests.
"When we met, your way of thinking was very pessimistic in terms of dealing with others, your opinion of yourself low in many regards despite your achievements."
We can fix this; you can't just walk out of the hospital in your pyjamas with a heart rate of a hundred and ninety."
"And did he not choose this life, a life with you, voluntarily? Has he not stuck with it through thick and thin?"
, John! Old ones, and the driver's bizarre French accent was a nightmare to try to decipher. I suspect there was some Scottish Gaelic influence; the Montreal area has received quite a lot of immigrants from Britain and Nova Scotia."
"I don't want to keep you for too long. Thank you for speaking with me," he says to his patient.
. Such a toxic idea for someone like Sherlock, whose skills have never included emptying his mind and just enjoying the moment.
He doesn't make the tea, nobody does. Rosie is with Mrs Hudson, and I suddenly realise John had planned this evening, he'd planned to kiss me, to tell me things tonight. As always, I have derailed his fumbling attempts at doing right by others.
"It's not a waste of a day to take it easy, to relax a bit."
Sherlock blinks. "It could have happened to anyone… but
Sherlock had once spent eight days learning to describe and recognise the different varieties — for a case, of course. The murder victim had been a whisky expert, and he had been able to prove that he'd been poisoned with a substance introduced into one of his opened bottles, and the killer had then emptied the contents, cleaned the bottle and poured precisely as much replacement whisky into it as there had been prior to ingestion to cast off suspicion about the MO. The trouble was that whatever was in that bottle after the murder was something an expert of Joff Beadle's calibre would not have consumed voluntarily, let alone stored among his most prized possessions on the top shelf.
As you stretch your left arm by holding on to the raised side rail of the bed, you feel something brush against your fingers, making you flinch. You almost drop the book in your other hand when your head whips towards the bed and your eyes meet a pair the colour of the sky reflected on a stormy sea.
[From G. Lestrade at 15:03] NOT REALLY WHAT I MEANT GOT TO GO OR
An arterio-venous malformation is a chimaera of blood vessels in the brain, a congenital defect in its vasculature allowing blood to gather into an enlarged pouch that can rupture and bleed. That bleed carries a mortality rate of up to over sixty per cent, and about a third of survivors end up with significant disability. AVMs can form anywhere inside the skull — some locations are easy for a surgeon to approach, some impossible. And for some surgeons, impossible just translates to a salient challenge. Mrs Mills' AVM sits in the junction of her pons and midbrain, necessitating navigating through many other brain structures to get to the surgical site proper. The smaller the opening, the less collateral damage there will be, but the downside is difficulty in operating and major challenges in controlling bleeding since even a small haemorrhage will compromise the entire view.
worse. This is not what he'd imagined when he'd first dared to imagine John's calloused fingers on his skin.
Sherlock is lying on his left side on the trolley, facing the large ultrasound machine. He is watching wordlessly what Mike is pointing at on the screen while tilting and twisting the probe as he locates and records different projections of the mitral valve.
last?" Sherlock complains to John, turning a cake stand slightly so that a spot not covered with whipped cream is no longer visible from where the guests will queue up to fill their plates. "Considering how she loses sleep over the neighbourhood hags judging her, you'd think she wouldn't do such a hash job of decorating the baked goods."
He doesn't wait to hear the explanation. He's already in the hall and taking his coat off the peg.
He unlocks his phone.

"What day is it?" Sherlock asks, and he's not joking.
"We'll just need to prove that the medical decisions made were sound," John offers.
," Sherlock says pointedly. "I am not getting involved in whatever the two of you are scheming."
As he watches the flames licking the blackening logs and listens to the hum in the chimney airlock, John is smiling to himself, his mood improved by thinking about his husband. He's been up for most of the day, even put on jeans and a jumper, and needed only one oxycodone tablet today. He's getting back on his feet, which means that he can focus better on Sherlock.
"Your mitral valve gave up the ghost," you tell him, astonished at how easy it feels suddenly to talk about it. The epiphany makes you realise what you have both been deprived of in this ordeal: celebrating that Marston has been caught. How you would be feeling right now if it wasn't for that damned mitral valve is triumphant, basking in the afterglow of Sherlock's brilliance.
"The fact that you haven't been yourself."
Relief washes over John because he is finally able to share this with someone who knows Sherlock. It is only now that he realises how alone he's felt in trying to keep his husband's mood and motivation up on his own. He needs a confidant; what happened last night is certainly not going to help with reconstructing Sherlock's professional comfort zone. The triumph of yesterday's demanding surgery will probably be for nought, drowned out by fresh devastation.
Sherlock strides to the bar and orders a drink for verisimilitude, catching the attention of a tattooed hunk nearby who raises their glass to him with an inquisitive smile.
"What have we got?" he asks cheerily.
If something circulates a planet on too low an orbit, it will eventually crash into its atmosphere and burn. I am ready to crash into John's, but instead of breaking apart, I believe it's the only way to stay whole.
Violet is still thinking about Thibaut, too. "He was such a
If ever the universe allowed John and me to be together as more than friends, public displays of affection would have been a thing to negotiate as John meandered his way through the inevitable crisis of his sexual identity shifting.
are. No one will ever convince me that you deserve any of this, that you're not as good a doctor and surgeon as they come. We don't need a miracle to fix this, we just need to hang on until the process ends and get you the best solicitor in case there's a tribunal. I'm sure Mycroft can point us in the right direction. We'll find some experts to corroborate the medical stuff in these cases. We'll do all of that, even if you don't think you've got the energy for it right now."
"There's something bothering you. I know you're having nightmares." That one incident hadn't remained an isolated one. Your exhausting level is approaching critical because, as much as you try to take time for yourself to rest and regroup, you can't leave him alone at night. Two nights ago, just as you thought the coast was clear — that he'd sunk safely into deeper sleep — some wretched dream had hit and he'd performed the bedridden version of sleepwalking, hands flailing and demanding that you or someone else

"But I need
"Yes, and as rationally and convincingly he explained his motives, I have the nagging feeling this will be a
"If only he'd listen," you mutter.
"Spoilsport," John quips, and rolls his head from shoulder to shoulder while answering. "Watson, anaesthesia."
"According to whom? Who told you that you had no right to feel guilt, grief and perhaps even regret, sometimes?"
"He has the best skillset in time management of all people I know," Sherlock points out very defensively.
He keeps you updated in the ambulance. Wide-eyed at every attempt at making him more comfortable and visibly circling panic, he only calms down once the back of the trolley is raised up so he can be half-seated. You don't know what to do with your hands, since encroaching on the territory of the obviously very competent EMTs would likely just mess up their workflow and routines. You tell yourself you will intervene if they leave something undone — if there seems to be a stone turned in trying to make Sherlock more comfortable. He's having oxygen with a mask he keeps readjusting, a bit of morphine — too little, you suspect, considering his tolerance. A sublingual nitro-glycerine spray was discussed while still in the flat, but the idea withdrawn because of low blood pressure. That's why raising the head of the trolley had not been a welcome idea at first. Fluids are running — standard solution to most acute problems involving low BP, but the sign of the Hartmann's makes you uneasy because you keep thinking of his swollen ankles. Where will the fluid go once it seeps out of his blood vessels?
"Um––"
. John calms down, albeit marginally. "Are you sure it was just once, the blood, or––" He has so many questions and doesn't know where to start.
"What?" John turns to look at him.
What he had assumed was a branch banging on a window at three in the morning turns out to be Angus at the door, grinning like the madman he is.
The psychiatrist looks slightly hesitant. "Perhaps we should return to the question that brought you here today. You said that you were unsure of whether telling him about his sister would be a good idea or not. In telling him, you would extend the pain you feel over losing her into Sherlock's emotional sphere. Would doing so offer any benefits for him, do you think?"
He's frowning, eyes distant. "I remember hearing hammering for some reason. That doesn't make sense, does it? Then there was a man holding me down and your voice. I think I heard Mycroft, but only very vaguely."
Sherlock launches into a florid, lengthy and very frantic summary of that research, occasionally blinking hard as he gets frustrated when some obscure numerical detail is eluding him.
"Whatever," he relents, defeated.
Sherlock runs his fingers down both sides of John's neck from underneath his jaw to the suprasternal notch, then towards the nape. "Enlarged lymph nodes. Any sudden pain or difficulty in turning your head?"
"You do usually lavish some supposedly therapeutic, trite praise for such things." He's come to expect it and admittedly, it feels good.
He feels overwhelmed, bulldozed over and so, so tired. He doubts he can sweep aside the dark defeat that still lingers.
'Not particularly, but the cauda syndrome from the ward needs to be decompressed. Just about to scrub in. SH'
Every morning, my heart flutters with relief.
"I couldn't stop thinking about certain points you raised. Certain points I didn't accept then but was inclined to agree with to get you off my back."
"Angela's related to us," Violet reminds him.
He remembers two prior periods like this in his career. The one before this had happened at the National after Andreason died. The way it left him adrift, at the mercy of the wolves that were his colleagues, hell bent on taking back what they believed the legendary senior surgeon's favouritism towards Sherlock had deprived them of, and for putting him in his place in the process. It was medical school all over again–– no, it was the
"Why would that make the news more palatable?" he asks dismissively.
Violet wonders.
"Yes, I can see you're on top of it," Violet points out in a judgemental tone, "with your shoes on."
By the time they reach their building and slip into the downstairs foyer, however, John is looking rather pale. He drops into the chair by the stairs, closing his eyes and leaning his head against the wall.
As alone as Sherlock feels right now, Harry is not a presence he’d welcome right now. “No, that’s not necessary. In either case, he’s unlikely to feel up to having visitors after being extubated."
"No, the contrary. He asked me to tell you when you arrived, especially if he was still affected by the medications and resting."
Why would I want to die of something else? Why not this, in thirty years or however long it takes for my immune system to cave in? Is it still less dignified, less decent, less embarrassing?
When Edgar rings off, Sherlock starts playing again. It's that piece from this morning; John can't even tell if it's attempting to contain a melody or just random notes. The music is giving him a sense of whiplash and impending headache due to its rapidly changing harmonies, rhythmic variation and fiery tone.
His phone rings, and he flinches. Moves not a muscle to retrieve the phone. Nobody calls him except Lestrade and Mycroft.
Victor hadn't been nice to him, so Victor had been allowed to stay. Like a wine stain not sunk fast enough into cold water, Sherlock had allowed him to linger for too long and leave a mark.
"Why are they being kept waiting? Do they not realise it must be an emergency?" Violet asks.
"Very few people can endure that sort of pressure. The fact that we can doesn't mean it's easy on anybody. I remember the first patient I probably killed like it was yesterday."
, Sherlock wants to argue, but then decides against it. Out of all the people he's known who are not his relatives, it's odd how John just might know him best. Even though he'd practically been undercover on Westray, he might just have accidentally played the role of his true self when with John.
they can. What gets people — both neurotypical and neuroatypical — down and makes them stop trying is the loss of hope that one can change and learn that makes or breaks a life path. Every time I was told by someone that there was no point in even trying because of who I was, that hope eroded bit by bit, and it could easily have been destroyed completely. Some of those people were healthcare professionals. Yet another thing I will credit my husband for is encouraging me to give some of them a chance after decades of shunning everything that reeked of counselling, therapy, or
Besides, Sherlock isn't even an MI6 agent, and after this travesty of a safehouse he's never ever going to accept an assignment from Mycroft. Not even if big brother threatens to waterboard him. Or threaten to take away his violin, a family heirloom Mycroft likes to pretend he allows graciously Sherlock to possess.
"That means you were amused by what you consider my high-maintenance pickiness, instead."
"How long do you think he should be on leave?" John asks.
haemoptysis = coughing up blood
"And an emergency operation for my shoulder," John mutters.
"So, it's
Sometimes he would have wanted nothing more than to disappear off with the other Holmes men on a walk or some other outing where his behaviour wouldn't have been the focus of everything. Mycroft and George are very alike: calm, analytical, socially adaptive even though George cultivates friendships and Mycroft, industrially inclined in his motivations, seems to consider them a waste of time. It would be hardly surprising that George might like the son better who was more similar to him. Nobody has ever understood Sherlock much, have they, save for a psychotherapist who's paid to like him? John loves him, but does he
He can't leave things like that, can he?
"Yes, they are. Knife," Sherlock requests, and a scalpel is placed onto his expectant, double-gloved palm. He slides out the blade — this is a new model with a plastic safety cap — and makes a quick, neat incision in the patient's shaved scalp. He is passed a pair of bipolar bayonet cautery forceps, which he uses to stem the seeping blood flow from small blood vessels in the incision. The scalp is well vascularised and thus bleeds a lot.
Sherlock had an angling rod as a child. He wasn't really interested in eating what came up on the rare occasion he caught something in the small lake close to their house — he wanted to study the creatures. He kept them in buckets in his room, much to the horror of his mother.
"You gave him a good life."
"I just wish it were over. Imagine a sneeze that won't come. Wouldn't you rather you stopped feeling like that instead of prolonging it and then making a mess all over yourself?"
John grins.
Sherlock steps onto the couch, then collapses down into an artful expanse of flouncing blue silk lapels, spindly limbs and messy curls.
four in the morning, after all. Tesco Metro is disappointingly, aggravatingly closed, too. Were he the sort of man John is, one who can look after themselves physically and blend in as a normal heterosexual human male, Sherlock might approach one of the loiterers in front of clubs or by the entrance to Baker Street tube station and ask for a cig.
Though the man must come from a family of means — at least the brother does — he'd seemed as out of place at the private clinic as John's dad's chair is in this flat. And, he'd called John out on feeling like an outsider, too. But how could someone so visibly posh, so public school judging by the accent, scoff so hard at such things? Is Sherlock Holmes some sort of a black sheep of the Holmes family?
"And that worries me. You should care, but instead of arguing your case, you remind me more of a deflated balloon than of the Sherlock I know. If you were at least reacting in some way… but you're not. Want to throw something? Even just a little bit?" John suggests.
"We had Rosie. And I thought that what we had was… good enough. But it wasn't, not really. Never had been."
. He even thinks about the bad times, wonders what it had been like. There was the time when Sherlock had lived here briefly after being discharged from the rehab Mycroft had arranged for him after he'd parted ways with Victor, and that time mid-medical school. Sherlock never really speaks about such things; John had only learned about Victor when the man had appeared unexpectedly back in Sherlock's life —
"Hi, John, nice to see you too," John chuckles.
The cab door squeaks on its hinges when Sherlock yanks it open and arranges himself into the backseat next to Edgar.
"How've you been?" John asks quietly.
"That was different." And John
John hopes she will make good on that promise, that they will come to an agreement to reserve some appointments.
John knows he probably should have. People generally expect that he would tell Sherlock off, but he hopes the man's behaviour remedies itself once he gets his surgical sea legs back. Today should be a big help in that process — or at least John hopes so. Should he allow today's good fortune in the OR to make him believe things have taken a turn for the better for Sherlock? He's not sure.
John has studied plenty of that as a part of his RAMC training. Maybe she's right, and some of what he's seen and addressed in fellow soldiers could be useful.
John uses the poker to push some ashes back towards the grid in the middle of the fireplace, under the burning logs which had taken some coaxing to light. It's a cold, foggy day that feels as though it's seeping in through the floorboards and the cracks in the window frames, smothering the flat in an atmosphere of bleak solitude. John has always enjoyed spending holidays relaxing at home as much as he enjoys travelling with Sherlock, but enough is enough. Besides, this is hardly a holiday. He's doing much better, but he agrees with Collings who he'd spoken to on the phone earlier that an additional week of sick leave is warranted. Two weeks is standard for an elective tonsillectomy — someone who's needed that surgery urgently because of an abscess will need even longer.
. It must be in John's nature not to count favours but to consider it an integral part of who he is to help others.
"Oh God," John groans, "Sherlock,
,” John growls from behind gritted teeth. “Have you any idea how much fun going through that even as an elective version is for an adult, hm?”
"You care about me," John says quietly. "You do. That's not a question. I need you, and I don't have any problem admitting to that. But it seems like it's not the same for you."
. "You've made an excellent start in introducing more emotional dialogue into your marriage, Sherlock."
"How could you possibly––" John shakes his head. "Sister. But that's not the point; we're here for you."
"They're right about that, yeah. For some reason, this guy wanted to talk to Sherlock because he treated some patient at A&E. I don't have any more details than that."
The story of Sherlock and Victor Trevor with a Lovecraftian spin. Requires no knowledge of that author's works.
"We can't look after everyone, but we need important people and creatures in our lives, so we assign some special ones the VIP package," John suggests.
A mistake I keep repeating is underestimating the consistency of John's loyalty. I have overestimated his fear of parts of himself he wasn't willing to embrace before. I have underestimated his courage. I have underestimated his feelings for me.
Sherlock is laughing. He laughs like he hasn't laughed in years, and for so long that the funny story John had told him begins almost fading from memory, helped by the copious amounts of whisky they have consumed. As he chuckles, his skin is pulled taut against his features as though emaciated not by a lack of physical nourishment but by a lack of something he, astonishingly, is experiencing now: happiness.
"So you get to traipse around the world for two years without giving a toss about me, but Lord forbid I want to take off for two weeks?"
"It has been both a good year and a difficult one in terms of workload and new challenges. It's not uncommon to feel a sense of emptiness during a transition from being very busy and new to things calming down and settling into routines. There is also the fact that these past two years can be characterised by cataclysmic shifts in your thinking."
Sherlock huffs, but starts rolling the napkins around cutlery and sticking them in the vase at the end of the table. "John shall have no such thing. Should I do swans or perhaps Sydney Opera Houses?" he asks, presenting one of the rolled-up bundles to his mother, "or will these do?"
Three weeks later, Sherlock's physical recovery has begun in earnest. Once he could extend his walks beyond eight kilometres with ease, he began running under the direction of his PT. Not even this has provoked forth another episode atrial fibrillation; Mike is convinced that those had just been a phenomenon associated with cardiac dysfunction and a very recent valve repair. Sherlock has built so much fitness, perhaps even beyond his pre-valve problem level, that you wouldn't even try to compete with him. Then again, you never could, the lanky athletic git he is. To your great relief, Sherlock is also eating much more since the exercise requires calories. Mostly what he's gained is muscle mass; there doesn't seem to be many ounces of fat lining his figure. You have no complaints on that front; you could get drunk with desire watching him undress. Could, but will hold back for some time more. You know that day will come, and this certainty allows you to summon the patience you need. He spoke of this one night, saying he wants to meet you halfway, not struggle to keep up. It's not time yet. He wants you, but he wants to make love only when he can do so feeling like himself again.
John spent most of his days with Sherlock, watching as the brilliant young man ran his experiments. Sherlock was smart, his head filled with knowledge that John couldn’t even imagine.
"The song is about a ballerina, you're a ballerina, I like the song, and I like you." Sherlock blushed, smiling shyly at John. "Dance with me?" John asked, reaching out to Sherlock with a grin. "I'm no where near as good as you, but my dad taught me a few things before he bailed." Sherlock timidly took his hand, and John heard the taller boy gasp softly as he pulled him close and started swaying to the music.
Sherlock squirmed against him, his fingers clinging to John's t-shirt and chest heaving as John gently bit down on one of his nipples, pulling a soft keen from the younger boy.
He was jolted out of his thoughts by The Beast entering the room again. He looked excited, practically bouncing as he came to a stop by Sherlock’s bed.
He would have to find a place to rest soon.
"Can we go get ice cream?" John laughed as his mother rolled her eyes, her resolve already caving.
“Did he eat?” Sherlock could hear the rumbling voice of The Master coming from outside of his room.
Then, John's arm draped over Sherlock's shoulder, and he abandoned all hope of knowing what was happening to The Doctor and his companion. He slouched further into the sofa and curled against John's side, feigning interest in the show as he listened to John's heartbeat.
"What do you want Love?" John's voice was soft and wavered slightly, and it was then that Sherlock realized that he wasn't the only one that was nervous. Sherlock timidly cupped John's face with his hands, leaning down to press a soft kiss to his boyfriend's lips.
“If you behave, I might be inclined to change my mind on the status of your stomach wound.” Sherlock stopped fighting John’s grip, stilling almost completely. “If you don’t, I’ll make you wait.” Sherlock whimpered, his head knocking against the door behind him. “Do you understand, Sherlock?”
"What? That John can do better?"
“J-John-”
“Get him out of there. I’ll try to slow The Spider down, just keep John alive.”
He felt darkness flood his senses as he lost consciousness, relief filling his mind as he welcomed death.
“I could ask you the same thing. What is your plan Greg?”
“Don’t care.” Sherlock started pulling at John’s shirt, tugging it up and over his head, letting it catch on his wrists. John felt his wrists being raised above his head and gasped as Sherlock snagged his shirt on a hook above his head. He whimpered as Sherlock moved his mouth down to his shoulder, sucking and biting at his bullet wound.
“Yeah, Sherlock. I swear, he is the most difficult man I have ever had the misfortune to work with.” John swallowed another flare of nerves. “Do you happen to know your shade? I don’t remember where I left your coding sheet.”
“Congratulations Gavin. Welcome to the family.”
“Bruised.” John chuckled, pressing his fingers against the healed skin where there used to be a gaping, bleeding hole.
"Why would he care when Mycroft gets back?" John laughed, rolling onto his stomach and shifting closer to his boyfriend. "Do they even know each other?"
"Oh, I certainly plan to, My Dear Watson." He gripped John's hip and guided him back to the centre of the bed.
“No one John. This is just me.” Sherlock’s voice was broken, the force of the tremors wracking his body causing his voice to shake.
"It will hurt, I'm not going to deny that, but if you go slowly, and use extra lubricant, it can feel very good." Sherlock blushed furiously as he peaked in the bag, quickly closing it. "Take the pain killers just after. They will help with the ache." Sherlock nodded, taking a steadying breath and leaning against the older woman, never more appreciative of her presence in his life. "And just remember Dear, sex does not equal love. You need to be sure about what you have with John before you do anything physical." Sherlock nodded, his anxiety starting to fade as he thought about John, the Rugby captain that seemed so enthralled with him.
“John-” Sherlock’s cry was cut short as one of the tentacles wound tightly around his middle, whipping the Siren off the boat and into deep space. The attacking creature released John’s Star Sailor and followed, playing some sort of game as it batted Sherlock through the sky.
“I’m not hungry.”
"I love you John." The tremor in Sherlock's voice told John more than any words could have.
His last memory from the night before was of Greg dragging him home.
I’ll explain when you get up here – GL
Sherlock prepared him as thoroughly and as quickly as he could, and John loved every second of it. Sherlock’s bony fingers were long enough to reach his prostate with ease, gently teasing over the bundle of nerves until John was trembling beneath him.
“Was he wrong?”
He was going to have to thank Harry when he got home.
“Of course I came back John, don’t be dull!” John grinned, God he loved that man.
“Well I did. People thought I was crazy, talking about this mysterious ‘Sherlock’ and whatnot. Even Greg and Mouse thought I had lost it. Hell, I thought I had lost it for the longest time. Until I was shot. Then I met this really unpleasant man that started talking about how it figured that he would be the one to go claim the soul of the man that hurt his brother so much.”
"It was long before we met."
, and they should trust my expertise."
"I don't need courtesy; I need you to fix my wrist and so far, you've offered nothing I couldn't have come up with myself."
"Sir? Sir!" the clerk tries to get John's attention, "If you'll just calm down, I can radio in to get an estimate––"
patient?"
"Thank you," you tell Marsh, and mean it.
He needs new hands on his skin to erase the invisible prints left there by John Watson, whose mysteries just might remain forever unsolved.
"How do you think it makes me feel when you don't come to me when you're not alright? Makes me feel like shit, it does. Makes
Here you finally have the reason for the denial — Sherlock fears going through with rehab and the rest of his recovery, because he fears it'll bring him face to face with what permanent consequences might be left after he's done his best to get back to normal. His physical infirmity remains severe, and there's a long way to go, but he's healthy, fit — at least once he starts sleeping again — and there's no reason why he couldn't achieve a very high fitness level with the new valve. But all that would be a lot even if he wasn't worried about microscopic clots and bleeds in his brain, of brain cells blinking out like white dwarf stars in the cosmos of his genius.
Massive black tentacles wrapped around the vessel, tipping it dangerously and causing John to slide across the deck.
He pointed the gun to the point just before their feet and fired.
"Of course I'm sure, now go get him, and get your apes out of my flat." Lestrade frowned, opening his mouth to snap back but seemed to hesitate when John sent him a pleading look.
Out of the top of his head grew intimidating black horns, twisting up and back. They shone in the light, looking deadlier than any weapon he had ever laid eyes on.
"I didn't sleep with her, Sherlock." John's voice was rough and Sherlock could hear the pain as he spoke. "Why would you think I wanted that?" Sherlock felt fresh tears start to fall and he covered his face in his hands.
“Sherlock is special Seb. I must have him.” Sherlock felt an unpleasant chill trace his spine as he hurried on.
"Babe-"
“I’m right here Love, and most decidedly not dead.” Sherlock kissed him again, and John felt the glass wall he had erected between his mind and the memory of Sherlock shatter.
“Maybe you just need to talk to him.”
“Good. If that changes inform us immediately. Vomiting could indicate-”
"I'm the Captain here, and you are my prisoner. I will go at my own pace, and you will love every. Fucking. Second. Understand?" Sherlock whimpered and nodded, the tension in his body falling away as John released his hair. "Perfect." John pulled Sherlock's hips forward and pushed the younger man's upper body back against the desk.
“Alright Love. Let’s get you home.” Sherlock nodded and let himself flicker away.
"So, you like watching me play?" Sherlock's cheeks darkened and he glanced at the door to his room, praying the student he was bunking with wouldn't be returning anytime soon.
“Yes, you were Sherlock. Now, you two can enjoy each other’s company for however long you like. Just try to avoid touching him when you are outside of time. He won’t survive another time.”
“Because you don’t mean it.” Sherlock sobbed at those words, pressing his face against the crook of John’s neck and clutching at the shorter man’s shirt. “Don’t say it if you don’t mean it Sherlock. I won’t do that to you.”
"Come on Posh Boy, we both need a shower, then I am going to fuck you into the mattress." Sherlock groaned, letting John lead him down the hall and into the shower.
“God, you’re perfect.”
“I don’t know yours either.”
“Too bad. You either eat on your own, or I come back up and force it down your throat.” With that, John was gone, leaving Sherlock feeling more like a prisoner than a guest.
“How’ve you been? I heard you got discharged. We sure miss you out on the field, you and your crazy ass sailing technique.” John laughed awkwardly, Sherlock could see the blush on his cheeks and would have thought it were cute if he weren’t so focused on trying to breathe right now.
"You look happy, Little Brother." Sherlock's blush deepened, but a bright smile pulled at his lips.
“That was ten years ago Love, a lot changed. Even if nothing did.”
“Hey Love, what’s up?”
They had met once before, a few months prior at a party that Mycroft and Victor had dragged him to.
"-so whatever you're trying to do here is pointless and unfair-" something screamed at John from the back of his mind and he held up his hand, silencing the nervous rambling from the other boy.
Sherlock still couldn’t find the source of the voice, and was beginning to become concerned. The only thing in the room other than himself a large, wing-backed chair, was an intricate Candelabra.
“Y-You- how- what the-”
“Only when I lift the energy from it. The muscles were severely damaged when I broke the seal, but I can manipulate the energies to trick the damaged tissue into not hurting anymore.” John reached for his Med Kit, digging through until he found his sonic kit.
“This is time John. This is what happens when I stop a moment.”
John’s arms were hoisted above his head, the sides of his face caked in dried blood and torn tissues. His body was bruised and broken and he swayed uneasily. Sherlock fought down a wave of nausea when he noticed the handle of a knife sticking out of John’s side.
“J-John-”
"Where is your date? I thought-"
The first several performances were the younger kids, stumbling through their routines awkwardly. It was cute, but John was unbelievably bored.
"They know I'm gonna fuck you senseless." John growled in Sherlock's ear, making his head spin. They had been having sex for a few months now, and Sherlock had never seen John quite like this. The Rugby player was confident on a good day, but this was a whole other level of confidence, and Sherlock found himself lightheaded in it's wake.
“What did you do, Mycroft?”
“Mike! Help me! Please!”
“Sherlock?”
He pushed himself up to his elbows, shaking his head and blinking away the fog that clouded his vision.
“Greg said you wanted to talk to me?”
“Are you keeping the food down?”
"If you're here to kill me and take back my fleet, do it. I deserve that and more for what I've done. I'm not going to fight you." John unbuckled his cutlass belt, letting the weapon clatter to the floor.
He gasped as The Beast lifted him gently into his arms, taking care to not aggravate the wounds.
“So that’s it? I just sign on the dotted line and my soul is yours?”
He needed John.
"He's no demon, just a clever boy that doesn't know when to shut up." The young man chuckled and squirmed. "Set him free." The angry mob of men shouted in protest, but soon quieted down when John raised his hand. Stamford stepped forward, wringing his hat in his hands.
When Harry finally got bored of bothering Sherlock, John waved him over, gripping his hips and pulling him back to stand under the kitchen doorway.
"Thanks Mate, was starting to feel like a bit of an idiot there." John motioned for the other kid to sit, tucking his books into his bag and waving the waitress over. He ordered a plate of chips for him and Sherlock to split, resisting the urge to flirt with the pretty waitress that kept sending him shy smiles.
“Behave Sherlock.”
As the now-dead Hope fell away, John caught sight of a massive red mark on its middle.
"Not yet, my guys just found something farther down the alley. Might be important." Sherlock bit his lip against a whimper and moved to stand, but was shocked to stillness by John's hand resting just slightly too high on his thigh.
"You would have your men sodomize me, simply because I'm not a pirate? Not exactly in keeping with your moral code, is it, Captain Watson?"
“-on one condition.” Sherlock felt dread pool in his stomach. “You have to break the bond.”
“Jesus Love, I thought we agreed you would give me a bit of warning before you did that?” John laughed, breathless. Sherlock’s ever flowing energy had a strange effect on his lungs.
