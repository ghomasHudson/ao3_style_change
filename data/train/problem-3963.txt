“Sam, that’s just rude.” Dean smacked his arm.
As Dean slid on his fresh wrist bands, he found himself stroking at the unmarred skin of his inner wrist... where Castiel had bitten him. The bite had healed soon after the alpha was done and now there wasn't even a scar. It didn't matter. It had been months and the alpha had probably moved on by now.
"That would be perfect, Dean." Castiel looked like a new man, happiness shining clear in his eyes. He picked up his coat and slid it back on, hiding away his form once again. He moved to leave the room, turning to Dean at the door. "I'll alert the staff to bring you anything you need. I know this is all happening very quickly, but thank you for giving me a chance. Good night, Dean."
2.) It’s been difficult for the past couple years to find time to write fics because I’m a full time student and writing doesn’t make any money, so this once fun pastime started to make me feel like I was wasting valuable time that could have been used to be productive elsewhere. (No I can’t do commissions, I almost got booted off the site for trying *I didn’t understand at the time that the rules against it were very severe and I got reported* and long requests don’t bring me inspiration, they just make me tired.)
“No, nothing hurts.” The alpha’s shoulders sagged in relief. The sight made something twist harshly inside Dean’s chest. In a sudden bout of honesty, Dean continued. “Actually, I’m feeling pretty good right now.” Castiel turned to look at him, as if expecting to find a lie. Dean let him look, leaning back on his arms, his shirt still unbuttoned halfway down his chest. Dean wasn’t sure what he expected, but it wasn’t the deep red hue of hunger that settled in the alpha’s irises before he quickly turned away to grab his coat.
"Well, if you insist." Dean felt like lightning was racing through his veins as Castiel's lips explored the vulnerable skin of his throat. His pulse was absolutely roaring as Castiel's fangs gently indented the skin, teasing around delicate arteries. Just when Dean thought he was going to drop dead from sensitivity, Castiel finally bit down. Dean nearly screamed as sensations flooded everything in his mind. He couldn't stop the harsh spasm that passed through his muscles, but Castiel was prepared just like before, bracing him with a rough hand on his jaw and an arm slung around his back. Castiel wasn't kidding when he said the bite would hurt. It hurt so fucking much. Another violent tremor passed through him and Castiel bit down harder on reflex, tightening his grip on his prey. The bite felt like it went all the way past muscle to scrape at his spinal column. A pained whimper dropped out of his mouth and Castiel's grip slowly loosened. As the alpha's fangs retracted and he began drinking in earnest, it felt like a wave of heat blazed across his synapses. His eyelids fluttered closed as his eyes rolled up and his body went slack in Castiel's iron grip. His mind was emptied of all his current worries until all that was left was him and Castiel. Dean heard the pounding beat of his blood rushing to meet the alpha, to feed him, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Just beyond that, Dean could hear a low keening sound and was embarrassed to discover it was coming from him. Along with that, Dean realized that his blood wasn't only rushing to his neck. He was starting to get hard... an inch away from Castiel's hip. If the alpha shifted just a bit, he'd know. The alpha's lips curled into a smile against his skin and Dean knew he was fucked. There was no hiding his arousal when it was in his scent, his shivering nerves, and thick in his blood that was now rushing through Castiel's well-fed body. The alpha took his time savoring Dean's blood as the rush turned to a trickle that he sealed off with a hot lave of his tongue. When the alpha pulled away, he stared at Dean just long enough that Dean was tempted to push him away, but he didn't think he'd be able to stand on his own right now. "Curious."
“Ah, moose.” Crowley says with a smile as Sam walks into the dungeon.
Metatron tricked Castiel, he made him believe that what he was doing was to lock up Heaven.
Just a second ago his dad seemed happy with the news.
Dean looks at Cass’s hand, which is resting on his chest, and takes it in his.
It’s night, Sam and Bobby are sleeping.
Cass stares a few seconds at Dean, his cheeks red.
“Prove to me you have him.” Dean tells her.
The demon tablet is their only chance to lock up the demons for good, it’s in no way a smart move to give that up.
If Cass likes him back, he’ll wake up. If he doesn't like Dean back, he won’t and Cass will never know about Dean’s secret.
Castiel just never thought about even the possibility of either Winchester being homophobic.
A few hours later, Sam, Bobby and Dean are still in the same house.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says with a smile. “Are you all right?”
“How could you think that?” Castiel says, looking hurt.
“Whoa, Dean. You okay?” Sam asks him.
Dean looks at his hands in fear but is surprised when he can’t see any blood covering his hands.
Suddenly, Bobby lights a match and drops it on the floor by Castiel’s feet, trapping him in a ring on holy fire.
Castiel looks to where the voice came from and sees his brother Balthazar.
“Dean?” Castiel asks, realising how close Dean’s face is to his.
He’s so nervous.
-------------------------------------
“I’m still me. I'm still your friend. Sam... I'm the one who raised you from Perdition.” He tells him.
“I… I need our advice.” Castiel says, sitting down on the trunk of a fallen tree.
Dean can hear his father’s words rising in his ears: No! You are going to be a strong and brave man, you won’t fall for other men. It’s a weakness.
Abbadon turns around, she faces her men and gives them a nod.
“Do you have it?” Abbadon asks, walking towards Dean and Sam.
“Is that her?” Sam asks Dean.
“Abbadon stabbed Castiel, but he didn’t have any wounds. He’ in a coma. The doctors can’t explain it.” Sam tells him.
Dean told Cass about his childhood crush and how he didn’t ask him out because John told him it was wrong and weak.
John kneeled down beside Dean, facing his son with a serious look in his eyes.
“I… I need to tell you something.” Castiel tells him.
Sam sits down opposite of him.
He then closes his eyes ad kisses Cass passionately.
“It’s about Dean.” Castiel tells him.
Nothing. Nothing happens.
“We got what you want. Let Cass go, we’ll deliver the stone to you.” Dean tells her.
“I love you too, Cass.”
Castiel doesn’t answer him, instead he just disappears. Dean sighs.
Dean nods and drives to the side of the road, slowing the car until it stops.
“Meg, Dean.” Sam says, looking at Dean with disbelief.
Dean jumps awake, looking around him only to see that he’s in the Men of Letter’s mansion. Or, as he has gotten used to calling it, home.
Dean chuckles.
Dean looks at Sam and remembers that the had fallen asleep while doing research.
Dean hums at the music, Cass smiles at him and closes his eyes to focus on the music.
“To the dungeon. Crowley must have answers.” Sam tells him.
If Castiel doesn’t wake up again, if Dean and Sam can’t save him, he’d at least have to tell some version of Dean the truth.
“Hi, Cass.” Sam responds, his voice cold.
They still talk about their hunts and about Heaven.
He looks so peaceful, so beautiful.
Castiel’s heart aches at Sam’s reaction of his confession.
“I talked to Crowley. He told me Abbadon injected Castiel with this kind of poison when she shot him. We can wake him up, but only with true love’s kiss.” Sam tells him.
“Well, it's too bad we got to angel-proof in the first place, isn't it? Why are you here?” Dean asks him.
Left of him there are woods that seem to be infinite. He turns around to see what’s on his right and sees a beautiful lake with fish swimming in it.
“I don't understand.” Castiel admits.
Castiel doesn’t wake up.
Dean’s favourite vacation of the year.
“What do you want?” Dean asks.
“It’s important.” Castiel tells his brother in a serious voice.
He breathes in.
Anger, fear, sadness.
Dean told him that it wasn’t his fault and that he’ll always protect Cass.
“So, why am I here?” Dean asks him.
“Hi, Cass.” Sam replies with a little smile.
“Well, I'd come if I could.” He tells Dean.
“Sam?” Castiel asks, looking at the younger brother.
,p>“Dean, you don’t like this kid. He’s just a friend. You’re not allowed to ask him out or anything like that.” John told him.
“Cass.” Dean whispers, his voice breaking.
“You’re going to be alright.” Dean cries, holding Cass’s face in his hands. “I’ve got you.”
Sam suddenly steps into the car, looking at Dean.
“Yeah.” Sam says, nodding.
“He’s in coma. He’s weak but fighting. The doctors can’t explain it.” Sam tells Dean.
He had been around 14 years, his little brother was 10.
Dean sits in the car, his face buried in his hands.
He and Sam had stayed up late, searching for freak incidents on the Internet.
“I can’t believe you, man.” Sam says, he then hags up.
Dean looks back at him in awe.
“What are you ding here?” He asks Sam.
“No! You are going to be a strong and brave man, you won’t fall for other men. It’s a weakness.” John told him, almost yelling at Dean.
“To get the souls. I can stop Raphael. Please, you can still trust me.” Castiel tells them.
“Superman going to the dark side. I'm still just Castiel.” He tells them.
“So, you..” Dean says, clearing his troth. “You accept me?”
Sam takes his gun to shoot the demons, but they’re already gone.
“Oh, don’t worry. I’m not real.” Balthazar replies.
-------------------------------------
It’s like nothing has changed.
Sam gives him a small smile and leaves the room.
“Look, you’re the love of my life, okay? You are. And next to Sam you’re the most important person in my life. So, if I'm asking you not to do something... you got to trust me, baby.” Dean tells him.
His heart is racing in his chest.
“When I was young, like, really young, 12 or something. I met this kid in school, his name was Dave.” Dean tells him.
He knows that what he feels for Dean is, as humans call it, ‘homosexual love.’
“Just wanted to check in.” Castiel tells him.
“Well, I'm sorry, too, then.”
“Whoa.” Sam says, walking up to Dean.
“What makes you think that?” Sam asks him.
“You're in it with him? You and Crowley have been going after Purgatory together? You have, huh? This whole time.” Dean says, looking at him with anger, disappoint and betrayal.
“Well, I'm thinking a lot of things right now, Cass.” Sam tells him.
The drive to the Restaurant is very comfortable.
“Gee, nice to see you too, Cass.” Sam replies.
“Oh.” Sam responds.
“I firmly believe Crowley is alive.” Castiel tells them.
When Dean opens his eyes he sees Cass waking up.
Dean leans in to give Cass another passionate kiss, which Cass gently returns.
“And we found a little whiskey. Thanks for coming.” Dean tells him with a forced smile.
Sam looks through the glass into Castiel’s room.
“You’d never lose me, Dean.” Castiel tells him.
“You got to look at me, baby. You got to level with me and tell me what's going on. Look me in the eye and tell me you're not working with Crowley.” Dean tells him.
“Dean, of course I accept you.” Sam says.
Dean walks up to Cass and gently cups his face.
He sees her looking at Castiel in defeat, Dean looks at Castiel as well.
Breathes out.
Guess Dean doesn’t care as much about me as I thought he did, Castiel thinks to himself.
“No, nothing yet.” Dean tells him, lying as well.
Castiel gives him a questioning look, not understanding what’s going on.
Abbadon smiles and holds out her hand, Dean sighs and hands her the tablet.
“Like I told you. He worked inside the shop, I walked outside, called with you, walked back inside and he was gone.”
He was given his own room, which means that there’s no one besides Dean.
“So, any word on, uh, Satan Jr being alive?” Dean asks him, clearly about Crowley.
“He told me I can’t stay with you.” Castiel repeats. “You didn’t know that?”
Castiel lays in a hospital bed, Dean is sitting next to him.
“Cass, you got to listen to me. I know you’re in there.” Dean whispers.
Sam sighs, he’s going to regret this.
“Uh-huh.” Balthazar says, nodding his head. “What kind of feelings?”
Sam stands behind Dean, waiting for his brother to make a move.
Dean sighs, “I love you too.”
“Trust you?! How in the hell are we supposed to trust you now?” Sam tells him.
“I’m sorry.” Meg says.
“So, are you going to call him? Search him? Anything?” Sam asks.
Dean sighs. Then says: “It’s complicated.”
“First, show me the tablet.” Abbadon tells them.
“Yeah.” Castiel replies, giving Dean a sad smile.
He then suddenly remembers what happened, how he killed Balthazar.
He doesn’t know a lot about humans, but somewhere along his time on Earth he has begun to understand the terms ‘homophobic’ and ‘homophobes.’
Sam reminded Dean of what Uriel told Dean years ago: Castiel has this weakness, he likes you.
“Dean, is it true that you told Cass he can’t stay with us?” Sam asks him.
“Dean!” He hears Sam yell behind him.
“Noooo!” Dean yells, running up to catch Castiel falling into his arms.
Sam and Dean are back home, Sam is helping Dean get ready for his date after Dean has asked Cass out for dinner.
“Oh, look. We, um- we have a new plan. We think we've finally figured out a way to track down Crowley.” Sam tells him.
“Yeah? What?” Sam asks.
All of them.
“I thought I lost you.” Dean says softly.
Dean walks back into the hospital, followed by Sam.
“Balthazar.” Castiel says with a smile.
“Good to see you, brother.” He tells Castiel.
Sam, however, told Dean that it’s obvious that Cass likes him back.
“I know. It's crazy, right?” Dean tells him.
“No, Sammy-“
Meg rushes into Castiel’s room without as much as a warning.
“Dad!” Dean said excitedly, running up to John.
The same feeling it gave him when he saw another guy kissing his childhood crush, Dave.
If he’d genuinely care about me, he’d be here.
“You know...You could've just asked me.” Castiel tells them.
“What is it?” Castiel asks.
“Yeah, I called her.” Sam tells his big brother.
“Cass?” Dean asks hopeful into the phone.
Dean lets out a breath in relief and smiles at Castiel as his eyes get filled with tears.
“He's right, Cass. One drop got through, and it was Eve. And you want to break down the entire dam?” Dean tells him.
“Dean is… he’s special. He’s sweet, kind, caring and just…” Castiel sighs. “Amazing. When I’m around him, I feel happy. Happier then I’ve been in Heaven, or anywhere else. And when he’s not there, It’s like something’s missing.”
“You want what?!” Kevin asks.
“Dean. You should stay. He’d want you to stay.” Sam tells him.
Dean has fallen asleep and Castiel’s hand rests in Dean’s.
“Are you really in a coma? Yeah.” Dean answers.
Castiel is standing behind the cash desk, when suddenly he sees that Sam is the newest customer.
Sam walks into the room.
-------------------------------------
“Oh. Johnny on the spot.” Bobby says.
“You all right?” Castiel asks him worried.
He feels tears forming in his eyes as his heart aches.
Ringgggg
He walks to a woman working in the shop and asks her if she knows where ‘Steve’ is.
Castiel knew the angels were destructible, without the archangels it was chaos in Heaven.
“I barely know the guy.” Kevin responds. “Why would I do this for him?”
“My name is Abbadon.” She tells him.
He thought Dean would allow him to stay with him and Sam, but he was wrong.
He was brought to the ER as soon as Sam and Dean brought him in.
“Yeah?” Sam asks, not understanding the sudden change of subject.
“Or I'll have to do what I have to do to stop you.”
Dean knows how much the kid has been through because of the demon tablet.
He didn’t have anything. No food, no water, no money, no home.
Dean knew John tried his best as a father and that was enough for the elder brother.
“Alright! Alright! just don’t hurt him.” Dean says into the phone.
“And we should have.” Dean says, looking to the ground. “We never should've doubted you. It's...I just hope you can forgive us.”
“Oh, believe me, I get it. Blah, blah, Raphael, right?”
“Dean.” Castiel whispers.
“Are you in love with Cass?” Sam asks him.
The Taxi then sets them off by the diner.
“Okay, thank you.” Sam tells her.
Dean looks at her in anger, but she doesn’t even notice him.
“Yeah, no, I-I get it. No worries.” He tells Cass. “But, baby, you'll call, right? If you get into real trouble?”
“What do you want to tell me?” Dean asks, now facing Castiel with his full body.
“And so would Dean.” Sam says, looking back at Castiel.
“Just let me explain.” Castiel tells Dean, almost begging.
“Cass! Cass!” Dean yells, grabbing Castiel’s face in his hands.
“That Dean told me that I can’t stay with you.” Castiel answers.
The same feeling it gave him when he saw another man kissing his ex, Liza.
“Yeah.” Dean says, nodding. “I think I am.”
“Yeah, you’re right.’ Dean says, nodding in agreement.
One of the men takes a knife in his hand and stabs Castiel with it, making him yell out in pain.
Dean sighs in relief when Castiel walks up to them.
He’d expect Kevin to try to stop him, but Kevin only sighs and stays quiet.
“What do you want?” He asks Crowley.
“What about you? Have you found anything?” Castiel asks Dean.
“Where's Sam?” Castiel asks him.
Dean smiles, one of his favourite songs is playing.
“I’m not gonna logic you, okay? I'm saying don't... just 'cause. I'm asking you not to. That's it.”
Dean obeys and show her the tablet, Abbadon nods.
But luckily Castiel appears, smiting the demons who were attacking Dean, Sam and Bobby.
He then realises it’s the same song that played in his dream world, when he planned on telling Dean about his true feelings.
“Dean?” Sam asks.
Sam has seen Dean hold his hand in the hospital.
He sharpens his troth, ready to tell Dean what he has been wanting to tell him all along.
Cass is wearing a black-white suit, which he looks beautiful in.
“How can I help?” He asks, walking towards them.
“And how exactly did Crowley trick you with the wrong bones?” Bobby asks.
Castiel barely has anything and it isn’t a good thing that he’s in Heaven’s most-wanted list either.
Castiel looks next to him and gets greeted by Dean’s beautiful smile.
“The angel-proofing Bobby put up on the house-- he got a few things wrong.”
‘Shut up.” Dean says, blushing.
Cass is his best friend, yet he’d rather not face him.
He and his Sammy, little brother, had just come back from school.
“He's keeping busy. He's tracking a Djinn in Omaha as we speak. In fact, I'm heading out there right now to meet up with him.”
‘You’re in love with him, Cassie.’
“Don’t ‘Sammy’ me! You know that this is all new to him, Dean. You know he needs us now more than ever.” Sam says angrily into the phone.
“Sam.” Castiel says in a quite tone.
“I’m doing this for you, Dean. I'm doing this because of you.”
“Go get him, Romeo.” Sam tells him encouraging.
Dean, to Cass’s dismay, insists on paying him and the Taxi then drives away.
“Hi, Cass.” Dean replies softly.
“Well, I consider him my friend. My best friend, actually. But lately I have had these feelings… feelings I never have when I’m around Sam or, well, anyone.” Castiel tells him.
“See, Cassie, you got stabbed by Abbadon. You’re in a coma.” Balthazar replies.
“Where are you going?” Kevin asks from behind him.
He looks up and sees birds flying above him, they’re singing.
“Well, there’s no new cases. Our main concern for now are the angels hunting down Cass.” Sam tells him.
“How long you been watching us?” Sam then asks.
“We gotta talk.” Dean tells him.
Cass grips Dean in a tight hug, as if he’ll never let go of him.
“I know.” Dean replies.
“It’s you.”
Dean looks at himself in the mirror, he’s wearing a white blouse and a brown leather jacket.
“Now, hand it over.” She tells Dean.
After he searched Castiel for around a half hour he decided to go back to the mansion of the Men of Letters. Or, as he feels comfortable calling it, home.
“You won’t, Dean. You can’t.” Castiel tells him. “I’m sorry.”
“So, you’re in love with my brother?” Sam asks him.
“Okay, just wait. I don't even know what you mean.” He tells Dean.
“Yes. I’m Abbadon, the new ruler of hell.” Abbadon replies.
“What?”
Besides, Cass is still Dean’s best friend, Dean’s scared of ruining that.
“I want a favour. You’ll be in my dept.” Crowley tells him.
“You're the one who taught me that freedom and free will- - “
The food was delicious, this is definitely the best food Castiel has ever had.
“No. Give Cass back first.” Sam tells her.
Sam looks everywhere in the shop, not the it’s a bg shop, but can’t find Cass anywhere.
After Sam told the doctors Cass had woken up and the doctors did a couple of tests to see if Castiel was really alright, they then released him from the hospital.
The demon walks over to the hospital bed and looks at Castiel’s unconscious body.
“You stay here. I’ll try to find a way to save him.” Sam tells his big brother.
Dean could see how happy John was to hear Dean had a crush on someone.
Suddenly, some of his man walk into the house and start attacking them.
“His?!” John said, not longer happy but instead angry.
The only the he has now is this place, Gas’nSip, his workplace.
Dean stands in the room, staring at Castiel.
“Oh?”
Outside he dials Dean’s number and holds the phone against his head, waiting for Dean to answer.
Sam, Dean and Bobby are in Ellsworth’s house, searching for Crowley.
“Hello.” Castiel says, appearing in the room.
“About what? Let me go!”
Abbadon’s men stand back and she releases Cass’s handcuffs.
Dean and Cass still laugh at the same jokes.
“It's hard to understand. It's hard to explain. Just let me go. Let me out and I can-“
Sam is standing outside of the room, talking to some of the doctors.
“Look, I know what you’ve been through. I do. But this is Cass, so I’m asking you, please.” Dean tells Kevin in a soft voice.
Dean’s heart is pumping in his chest, not trusting the woman.
“I can’t believe it.” Sam whispers, as in a state of shock.
He’s scared of Dean’s answer. But if he’s really in a coma, he needs to know.
“Protect us how? By opening a hole into monsterland!” Sam says.
“I have to tell you something.” Dean tells his younger brother.
“How'd you know what I said?” bobby asks him.
“Who?” Dean asks.
“I know.” Dean replies smiling.
Dean feels blood boiling in his body when he sees Cass’s tortured and bloody body.
“Yeah. Yeah. I’m fine.” Dean tells Sam, calming down.
“Of course I forgive you.” Castiel tells him, smiling.
“The demon tablet.” Abbadon tells him.
“Not to worry, though. I’m sure Sam and Dean will find a way to save you.” Balthazar tells him. “But, I do have to ask, why am I here? I didn’t know I’d be a part of your dream world.”
“Don’t.” Dean says, shaking his head.
But Dean doesn’t care, all he cares about is saving Cass.
“So, we can save him?” Dean says hopeful.
“And?” Dean asks, standing up. His eyes full of hope.
They didn’t have a case in weeks and it felt strange to them.
“No, Dean! You can’t!” Castiel tells him.
“You need to fight. You hear me? I need you to fight.” Dean lowers his face, tears filling his eyes once again. “I can’t lose you, please.”
He starts to notice things.
” A lingering kiss, another sensual roll of the hips.
Castiel doesn't really know what to say to that. His heart still hurts, but things always look a little less dark in the morning, don’t they?
“Wait – Cas,” Dean interrupted. “Are you saying you know how to dance?”
Cas smirked.
Sam caught up to him before he had the chance to charge Castiel and his partner.
I can’t...”
“Fuck Cas, you feel so fucking good...so tight for me.”
A wet dream come true.
Sam’s calculating eyes follow his line of sight and he only looks mildly surprised when Eileen asks candidly, “Castiel, are you jealous?”
“Dean,” Cas sighed, moving closer. “I would never — could never — leave you. Why on earth would you think that?”
“No, we’ll still have to deal with the witch tomorrow, but at least nobody will turn into a murderous robot tonight.”
“I — I need some time, Dean.”
He realized that one corner of his mouth had turned up, a direction it hadn’t seen in quite some time.
Under the table and out of sight, Dean lifted his right foot and brought it to rest on Cas' chair in front of him, directly between the angel’s legs. Cas looked at him, usual stoic expression perfectly in place, nothing more. Dean shifted slightly so that the ball of his foot made contact with Cas' most sensitive area. His pajama pants were so thin, Dean could feel every inch of him, every fold of skin, under his foot – including a twitch in the angel’s cock when Dean added a bit of pressure. Cas didn’t move, his expression never wavered, but the nearly imperceptible widening of his eyes gave him away. Dean couldn’t help the way his own mouth quirked at the idea of playing adult footsie with an angel.
Of all the people in here and he pulls in the swingers. Figures.
He learns how to do laundry.
And with that, Cas pushed his cock deep inside Dean until balls smacked against asscheeks. Both groaned at the sensation, dizzy with endorphins. Cas stayed perfectly still, with the exception of some heavy breathing to keep himself under control, allowing Dean a moment to adjust to the stretch. Dean had never felt so wanton before, loving the feel of Cas inside him, stretching and filling him up. He pointedly ignored Cas' use of the L-word.
He jumped at the sound of Cas' voice behind him.
But welcome.
He doesn’t want to hear it either, not when Dean finally speaks with a hoarseness akin to forty years in Hell.
Of course, Dean didn’t say those exact words, but Castiel is getting a lot better at reading between the lines — especially wide gaping ones.
“Cas, I’m yours, I’ve always been yours,” Dean stated, a weight suddenly lifted. It was so matter-of-fact, so simple. Like all of the pieces finally clicked into place for Dean and it wasn’t hard to speak the truth anymore. He belongs to Cas.
Cas reached his arms around Dean’s chest, pulling him up into a sitting position so that his back was against Cas’s chest. Dean relished the momentary recess his ass received as Castiel changed their position. The angel then pinched and pulled on Dean’s nipples, causing him to cry out.
“You are an infuriating man, Dean Winchester,” Castiel growled. “I think I need to teach you a lesson.”
Man, he’s really not good at this stuff. Maybe he should try talking to him?
“Nothing of import,” was Cas' curt reply.
Cas trailed off, suddenly looking embarrassed. The flush on his cheeks intensified. He took a moment to collect himself, then shook his head and started again.
It hurts too much.
Just as Dean’s orgasm crests, it is ripped away from him by fingers circling the base of his cock and clamping down.
He keeps asking himself, but he’s no closer to an answer than he was this morning.
Dean swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat. He watched in amazement as the man above him shifted from
, assured, steadfast, and all-powerful being.
“Cas,” Dean wheezed. “You look like you’re ready for
Still doesn’t hold a candle to his angel though.
, I’m going to - ”
“Yeah, Sammy,” Dean told him. “20 minutes.”
Dean slinked over to the table where Cas looked physically pained.
“Just what, Cas?” Dean responded, clipped in an attempt to keep his anger - and hurt - in check.
It was obvious Sam was trying not to laugh at Dean’s discomfort, but he was too focused to care.
Sam finally recovered from shock and explained the “bull in a China shop” phrase Cas butchered before asking him if he obtained the necessary ingredients for their impromptu necklace barbecue.
More waiting.
When they finally crashed into Dean’s room, they broke apart panting, sizing each other up. Cas didn’t give Dean a chance to speak or ask questions. He kicked the door closed and moved into Dean’s space, eyes blazing with purpose. Dean, now horny, confused and slightly intimidated, had no choice but to give in. He backed up until he felt his knees hit the bed. He plopped down on the mattress and stared in awe at the wild angel before him. Seeing Cas completely wrecked with a predatory glint in his eyes reminded Dean of his earlier unease.
Time is valuable when you’re trying to prevent an apocalypse. He spends his with a red-headed marvel, thinking about a green-eyed one.
“Mine,” Castiel growls, grabbing Dean under the arms and hauling him up. Cas presses him against the wall again and Dean hazily wonders if he’s discovered a secret kink. He puts that thought aside for another time because he still hasn’t come and he’s so hard he could probably balance a book on the end of his dick.
With Dean’s head on his chest, Castiel can admire him in peace. His plump lips, softly parted as tiny puffs of air escape; a strong, slightly crooked nose; long eyelashes that fan across his cheeks, highlighting his freckles.
When Dean finally looks up, surprise is added to the swirl of other emotions lining his beautiful face. Like he wasn’t expecting Castiel to actually be sitting there, almost like —
in Castiel’s chest tightened even further. A red-hot coil waiting to spring loose and break him.
He shrugged, not really sure how to put the rest into words. That was hard enough to say.
It feels good, to have a purpose. He thought he’d never have that again.
Castiel can’t live like that. Can he?
Cas fucks Dean against the wall like it’s the last thing he’ll do on this green Earth. He pounds into Dean’s tight hole over and over again, aiming for his prostate every other thrust, until Dean cries out.
warrior.
The door creaks open seemingly of its own volition while Dean stares at the floor in front of him. Castiel’s heart hammers in his chest, his hands suddenly clammy and eyes glued to the figure in the doorway.
He should have known better.
“To teach you a lesson,” Castiel deadpanned, not breaking eye contact. Dean snapped back to attention and looked down at Castiel, who was eyeing him with curiosity. That stupid, adorable head tilt be damned.
If Cas was going to smile like that every time he did something right, he’s going to start paying attention.
One night in the library, Dean wordlessly hands him a mug of coffee and his cellphone before turning on his heel.
More waiting.
Like he currently feels.
“Whiskey double, neat,” he says, casually ignoring the busty blonde bombshell. He slides onto his seat and takes a sip of the whiskey, relishing the way it burns down his throat.
— with the same fingers he just had inside Dean —
He does leave, just like Dean said.
“Were you going to leave with them, Dean?”
He’s never letting go, not unless Dean tells him to. He'd follow him to Hell again if that's what it takes.
════════════════════
Any further argument is abruptly cut off when Castiel angles his hips and nails Dean’s prostate one, two, three more times until he stills and comes inside Dean. Dean can feel every pulse of Cas’ cock, painting his insides and if he didn’t have this makeshift cock ring, that alone would have sent him over the edge.
"Dean, c'mon, pay attention.” Sam rolled his eyes. “I’m pretty sure the necklace she’s wearing is carrying the enchantment. All we have to do is burn it with the other ingredients and the spell will be lifted.”
She pops in on a Friday night, just long enough to drop her bag in a room and bully them into dinner and a night on the town.
The darkness is back.
He frowns, trying to describe the way his arms ache, his fingers tingle and his stomach rolls.
Dean tensed. His body wanted to respond to instinct and kiss Cas back, but his mind was running away with him. Cas is going to leave; he shouldn’t be kissing Dean like this. Like he’s dessert.
“Fuck, Cas!”
════════════════════
Dean hurriedly rinsed, dried off and put on his clothes before unlocking the door. He was right about Cas standing outside the door, but he was wrong about the angel being annoyed. Cas is furious with a capital ‘F’ – his hands balled into fists at his sides, shoulders shaking slightly in anger. It's kinda hot.
“Dean, please...I — I can’t take much more,” Cas said. “I need — I want you inside me.”
“If you — if you really want to leave, Cas, I’m not going to stop you. But I really — ” Dean cuts off, squaring his shoulders in resolution. “Whatever it is, we can work it out. Please, just...”
Sam smiles and shakes his head at Dean’s embarrassment. Sam then looks at Cas, hoping he isn’t as embarrassed as his emotionally constipated brother. Cas, however, is finding it just as entertaining as Sam.
This continued for a few minutes until Dean traded the feather for a HotHands pack. He always kept them in the car in case he and Sammy got cold during a stakeout, but tonight was a special occasion that called for extra stimuli. Dean opened the package and waited a few seconds for the pack to warm up while he fished an ice cube out of his drink and plopped it in his mouth. He pressed the warm pack to Cas repeatedly in various places (the top of his thigh, his stomach, his collarbone) as his mouth trailed ice-cold kisses all over his body.
Thirty minutes of pain.
They talk for an hour before Charlie asks how he’s doing.
“Cas,
Castiel spent the entire car ride debating whether or not it was enough to have Dean as a friend, trapped in a state of perpetual longing, than nothing at all. It hurts and he still doesn’t
right. His cock, hanging heavy between his legs, was swollen and throbbing, leaking precome. His entire body thrummed with energy and begged for release. Just when he thought he couldn’t take anymore, Cas’s tongue disappeared and hands released him.
Somehow, the dam breaks.
In the end, Castiel is the one to take down the wendigo on their first case. It’s an easy one, but Sam claps him on the back anyway.
“I know, Dean, but —”
He didn’t say a word in the car, when they got back to the bunker, when he led Castiel to his room, when he closed the door. And he’s not saying any now.
They study.
They train.
“Rule number 2: watch the hands.”
This thing with Dean has taken on a life of its own, but Castiel still won’t give it a name. Can’t.
Shower sex? Uh-huh.
Before long, Dean was achingly hard. He’s got 170 pounds of heavenly wrath grinding in his lap and damn if that doesn’t go straight to his dick. Dean moaned into Cas’ mouth, hands fumbling with the buttons of Cas’ shirt as the angel continued his own brand of torment.
════════════════════
Dean knew it was too good to be true. He’s screwed up big time and now Cas is going to leave him. Flap away to Heaven or wherever...so long as it’s far away from Dean Winchester, who breaks everything he touches. He doesn’t deserve someone like Cas. He doesn’t deserve Cas’ friendship, their ‘profound bond’ or the stellar sex.
Castiel leaves it at that in his mind, in the space in his chest where Dean lives.
“Cas,
Dean trembles with nerves and arousal until Cas steps back suddenly, leaving him open, bare and empty. He whines with the loss, sounding pathetically needy.
So many feelings can fit into a name, into four letters. The one taking flight right now is also four letters.
There was something about Cas that was just so magnetic. Dean had experienced that pull many times before tonight, but this was different somehow. Seeing Cas move like that was…hell, it was sexy. And Dean had never
As the conversation dwindled, Dean pushed his empty plate forward on the table and reclined in his chair, both hands behind his head. To Sammy, he was the picture of relaxation. To Cas, absolute hell. His left foot moved up to join the right, both circling Cas' impressive erection and stroking him forward and back. The angel’s sentence was suddenly lodged in his throat, compelling Dean to take over the conversation.
So slowly, he didn’t know it was happening until one day in a bar, someone asked him if he was jealous and he knew, deep down, that the answer could be nothing other than ‘yes.’
“You know everything about me.” Another soft press of lips as his ass grinded against Dean’s cock trapped in his jeans.
Dean was suddenly hot around the collar. “This isn’t dancing, it’s sex on a dance floor!”
He figured out the basics of being human pretty quickly — hunger, sleep,
Sam’s voice echoes in the hallway, his knuckles rapping softly on the door just a few steps down from his own. It opens slowly, shuts quietly, and two pairs of feet take off in the other direction.
Eileen doesn’t bring it up again, but she doesn’t have to. The word swirls around in his brain, teasing his thoughts like wine on a sensitive palate.
On second thought, maybe Cas is right, maybe Dean does owe Sam a thank you.
Dean had all of three seconds to mull that over before he’d been thrown over Castiel’s shoulder and hauled toward the bed.
"Ay carumba," Dean crooned. "Wouldn't mind gettin' wrapped up in that burrito, if you know what I mean."
Dean is clearly ignoring whatever advice Sam gives him if the ‘bitch faces’ are any indication.
“Cas, c’mon man,” Dead argued, grasping at the angel’s trench coat. “Put me down.”
A profound bond.
Candice recovers first.
What a revelation. Dean’s dick twitched at the thought, even if his face is frozen in surprise. He was achingly hard, leaking precome, as he watched Cas raise up to hover over him.
He still hurts.
Eventually, he hears Dean’s boots stomping down the hallway, slowing as they approach the door to Castiel’s room, like they usually do but —
Indecision is new to him. His usual, rational thought process is useless here.
“Cas...
“Out with what?” Cas mumbled, glancing up at Dean before averting his eyes.
Emotions.
════════════════════
“Huh?”
“It’s not - It's not what it looks like!” Dean stutters.
“Dean?”
The dreams.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas breathes, sounding a tad bit smug, “look how you ache for me.”
It’s better.
“Hi, I’m Chad.”
The sudden fluttering in his chest takes him by surprise, but he smiles. He knows this feeling and he’ll know it for the rest of his human life:
practically every moment of the day, if he’s safe, if he’s happy, when he’s coming back.
“No, Dean,” Cas commands huskily, “you don’t deserve it yet.”
Maybe he never will.
“How about you?” Dean asks, glancing over at her. She’s clearly beyond the age of a college student, but not yet 30, he thinks. Blonde hair in loose curls falls over her shoulders and her large brown eyes are warm and inviting. She probably works downtown in the marketing department of some nondescript company. Tasteful cleavage and showcase curves to boot.
Now, Cas has really got him in a chokehold and he doesn’t know what to do. He goes with his first instinct. His fingers pull at Cas’s forearm, trying to relieve some of the pressure around his neck.
“You thought what, Dean?” Cas prompted, voice still husky but tinged with concern.
. Dean hoped Castiel hadn’t heard his wayward thoughts, but if he had, his face didn’t show it.
When they leave, the darkness comes back.
Cas thrust his hips up, impaling Dean on his dick as he continued toying with his nipples. The relentless pounding started again, sending waves of pleasure cascading through Dean's body. Cas grasped Dean’s aching erection firmly in hand, stroking in time with his merciless thrusts.
He always knows.
Dean,” Cas whispered before softly touching his lips against Dean’s surprised mouth.
He says it’s called depression.
His eyes blur with unshed tears, a small smile tugging at his lips as he brings the phone to his ear to whisper, “Hello, Charlie.”
Dean is sweating, red in the face and breathing heavily. “Dammit, Cas, I’m trying!” Dean groans. He’s attempting to keep his shoulder from dislocating while trying not to think about how his hand is
Cas slipped off of Dean’s cock and collapsed on his chest, his back to Dean’s front, still panting. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and planted a kiss on his shoulder, now that Cas was conveniently reclined on top of him. Cas’ hands reached for his and gave them a squeeze. They couldn’t manage words just yet, but those small touches spoke volumes.
“Fuck!”
“Dean,” Cas whispers in Dean's ear, though loud enough for Sam to overhear. “This is exactly what it looks like. There’s a reason it's called the rear naked choke.”
“If you still want to go after we talk, I’ll drive you anywhere, but please let me — ”
Dean reached up and pulled the earplugs out of Cas’s ears, leaving him with only the blindfold. Now that Cas had his hearing back, Dean began whispering to him, knowing the angel secretly loved dirty talk.
Cas snakes an arm around his stomach and another under his leg, hoisting him up until his legs are wrapped around Castiel’s waist and he’s pinned to the wall by sharp hip bones. He hooks his ankles together and cries out when teeth pinch the muscle between his neck and shoulder.
Sam can’t help it and a laugh escapes. Dean freezes and shoots a worried look toward the door, blood draining from his face when he sees Sam standing there.
So he waits.
His eyes stray from Candice to Chad, who’s slowly moving closer and boxing Dean in against the bar. A large, warm hand lands on his thigh, above the knee and definitely in the danger “this is a flirtation” zone. He stills under Chad’s touch, too shocked to move or protest.
“Yeah, and you see how well that worked out last time,” Sam scoffed.
Castiel stood before them, dressed in black polyester bell-bottom pants and a tight purple shirt with flowy sleeves and a ridiculous number of sequins. Pinned across the front of his shirt (if you can call it that), is a competition bib, #2183.
“Oh god yeah...Cas...don’t stop…” Dean felt his climax building, drawing his body up tight like a bow string. “Cas, I’m gonna come…”
opening him up to take him. Cas continued thrusting his fingers into Dean while his mouth continued sucking, getting sloppier by the second. Every few passes, Cas would throw in a turn of the wrist or a swirl of the tongue just to keep Dean on edge.
Rude. During their last hunt, Dean tired out quickly and got his ass kicked before Castiel showed up to save the day, yet again. Dean knows he’s getting older and should probably start working out more, but he’d never admit that to Sam.
The line is still connected.
Cas balanced his weight on one hand as the other reached down to fondle Dean’s balls before two fingers slipped back into Dean’s hole. His ass clenched around Cas’ fingers, and the whine that left his mouth was not human. Dean was suddenly overwhelmed by the myriad of sensations. The feel of Cas’ tight hole sliding up and down on his cock, head catching on his rim, plus his fingers pumping in and out of Dean in time with his thrusts, sent Dean careening toward release.
Maybe they needed something to balance out the negative energy that Castiel brought with him.
Before they reach the back door, Castiel swings Dean around until his back slams against the wall, knocking the wind from his body. Castiel’s eyes are alight with anger and a spark of fear courses through Dean.
He smiled today.
It still hurts.
Cas trailed one hand down Dean’s stomach, circled his belly button, then glided back up to his chest. He rolled one of Dean’s hardening nipples between his thumb and finger as he took the other in his mouth, nipping gently at the hard bud. Dean moaned and wriggled beneath Cas as he continued this torture, bouncing back and forth between the two tips.
Before Dean’s orgasm could rip through him, Cas tightly circled his fingers around the base of Dean’s cock to prevent him from coming. His fingers retreated as his mouth pulled off of Dean’s dick with a pop. One second, Dean’s about to have the best damn orgasm of his life and the next he’s just...
════════════════════
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, Cas please, fuck — ”
Dean is divested of his clothing in a matter of seconds and reduced to a quivering mess not long after. Not once has Cas let up, giving him a chance to catch his breath or hell, even participate. There are lips and hands and teeth all over his body, ratcheting up his sensitivity to a concerning degree.
Dean’s hands flew out to grip Cas’ hip bones as he rode Dean hard. Just when he thought it couldn’t possibly get any better, Cas surprised him yet again. He slid off, turned around and sank back down on Dean’s cock in one swift movement.
And that is how Dean ends up spending every afternoon in precarious positions, cursing Sam for his stupid ideas and Castiel for his stupid blue eyes and superhuman strength.
Dean should apologize, he should kiss Cas and tell him it won’t happen again, he should calm the angel down before he wakes the neighbors or has a coronary. But when has Dean ever done what he should?
When Dean’s eyes finally regain focus, an amused smirk lingers on Castiel’s plump pink lips. Cas’ hair is artfully rumpled, his tie askew in his apparent haste to rid himself of the trenchcoat Dean’s become so fond of. He watches as Cas’ hands slowly loosen the tie and toss it on the bed, his fingers skimming down to open the top two buttons on his dress shirt and continuing down to his dress slacks.
, Dean groaned inwardly.
“Oh,” she responds simply. “That’s the anxiety. You’re worried.”
“How would you feel if I died...again?” Cas whispered into his back. Dean was thankful that Cas was behind him so he couldn’t see the emotion playing over his face.
Cas unceremoniously dropped Dean on the bed, angel mojo stripping him before he even hit the mattress. His lips and eyebrows quirked at the sudden nudity.
He groans, blinks a few times and looks around, snapping to attention when he sees Castiel standing in the doorway. He jumps to his feet, moving faster than expected for a 30-year-old who spent the night on the ground.
It vaguely occurs to him that they shouldn’t be doing this in the bar, where anybody could see them on their way to the bathroom. If Dean’s going to get his ass handed to him, it should at least be in private.
It’s hard with Charlie gone. He can’t talk about these jumbled feelings with the Winchester brothers like he could with her.
Cas pulls back as far as he can, then snaps his hips to slam his cock back into Dean’s tight little hole. He sets a relentless pace, his cock stretching Dean’s hole and dragging against his prostate. One hand steadies Dean’s hips as the other grabs onto the back of his neck and shoves his face down against the bedspread.
makeup.
“Cas….”
Dean doesn’t move.
Brotherly love, like Sam. Friendship, like Charlie.
“You are mine, Dean Winchester,” Cas says with eerie calmness as his hands ruck up Dean’s shirt and scratch up his stomach to tug at his nipples. Dean cries out when Castiel twists both nipples, sending a shockwave of pleasure straight to his dick.
“YOU WARDED THE BATHROOM?!” Cas bellowed, fixing Dean with a glare.
“Or not.” Dean laughed and headed inside, pleased with the impromptu foreplay.
Charlie takes him back to the doctor, holds his hand when he can’t find the right words. Now there are little blue pills to go with the white ones.
He never wanted to see Dean like this. With red-rimmed eyes. Blotchy cheeks.
“Actually, you know what?” Sam said after a sudden epiphany. “Why don’t you ask Castiel to practice with you in hand-to-hand combat? He’d be the perfect sparring partner – he’s stronger than you and never tires.”
Sam and Eileen pick up right where they left off and talk like old friends. Castiel joins in when he can, but mostly he just watches. He keeps one eye on Dean and scans the bar, observing the patrons, the waitstaff, the group of college students. He watches the couple making out in the corner booth whose hands never seem to come out from under the table.
He kept constant pressure on it as his fingers rocked inside Dean.
So it goes.
Dean is asleep against the wall outside. His long legs stretch out in front of him, arms wrapped around his torso with his head at an awkward angle and his face pressed into his worn leather jacket.
Dean really shouldn’t be surprised, really, but Cas is still fucking rock hard. Damn angel libido.
Dean’s always liked his sex a little fast and a little rough. All those one-night stands he picked up in seedy bars, they liked it, too. But he could never just let go the way he wanted. Ladies don’t like bruises.
him differently. It’s wrong, he knows it is, but now he feels as helpless as he did when he first became human.
This morning he was planning to ask Dean to go to the Farmer’s Market to buy more local honey and now….now he doesn’t even know where he plans to sleep. To live.
Yet so far.
Cas nodded, licking his lips before taking a deep breath. Dean put the earplugs in, then made some loud noises to make sure he couldn’t hear anything. Dean put a cassette in his stereo and turned up the volume — just because Cas was deprived of sound didn’t mean he had to work in silence.
“Cas, I - ”
Cas’ fingers continue invading his tight hole as teeth nip at his neck, collarbones and bottom lip. Dean pants through the pleasure and the pain.
The food is cold now.
Dean doesn’t knock.
Dean and Sam call to check in, but he doesn’t hear from them as often as he’d like.
Castiel barely has time to contemplate any of it before Dean wakes.
“I’m just saying, this could be the start of something good,” Sam says as he backs out of the kitchen. “The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.”
. Cas was going to town, sucking and slurping on his cock, toying at the head with his tongue. Dean was going to lose it any second now.
He wrapped one hand around the base of Dean’s cock as his tongue flicked out to taste the leaking precome beaded on the tip. Cas closed his eyes as if to savor it and Dean groaned. It was by far the sexiest damn thing Dean has ever seen in his life. His dick twitched with pleasure, bringing Cas out of taste-testing mode into
More than a baby in a trenchcoat.
Dean felt his chest hurt, but the different kind of hurt than what he felt right in this room before Cas drew the sigil.
Dean took a moment to gain control, "Now, it's my turn to move, Cas."
Abaddon sighed lazily before replying, “Just another mistake of pleasures.” She laughed when she saw her brother make a funny face as a response, “You know, one of those nights when you picked up someone, and it ended not as satisfying as you hoped. I mean, at least you had good sex — I assumed — from whoever you picked up last night. Mine was …
Then the next memory would be when he thought he lost Sammy when trying to rescue their Mum and Jack in the alternate universe, right before he said “Yes” to Michael. Dean also remembered how he and Cas argued that Dean shouldn’t do that. The sad, disappointed look on Cas’ face was one of few things that haunted Dean when he was being hijacked by Michael.
Cas almost fell asleep watching the program when he felt Dean moved and practically nuzzled his face to Cas’ chest. The dentist rose his eyebrows and turned, tried to shuffled away, just in case Dean needed more space.
“God no!” Bela quickly answered, as if afraid that if she was late in answering, the group of people before her will start nibbling the artworks. “They are all from various non-edible materials. Charming gentlemen they are, one’s British, and he was a friend of mine. And the other was American, funny man.”
The Nephilim looked to one of his fathers, and there was smug contentment in his face. “It’s not his power anymore,” Jack looked down to his grandfather, the man who would kill him twice without blinking or having a second thought about it. That thought alone had given Jack a vindication to be able to say what he said.
Gabriel scoffed and takes out another lollipop from his pocket to devour, “You tried to make their relationship as platonic, but somehow it
He almost slide close the door, when he saw a slight movement behind the t-shirt pile. Hoping that it was what they were looking for, Dean lifted up the clothing and there he was. A small yellow kitten was curled peacefully and asleep.
“Huh?” Dean leaned his back and placed his body weight on his elbows. He had the strongest urge to ask whether Cas thought too much about him as well, then he hesitated. Not willing to sound like a love-sick puppy.
Mick received Castiel’s not-so-subtle invitation well, on the next second he was on his knees and pulled the other man’s pants lower, and the smile on his face got wider as he saw Castiel’s cock sprung free. But Mick didn’t service him immediately. Just like the man he lured to this janitor closet, he teased.
He lifted his head up from his phone just in time the light turned green. There was no second had passed, the cars behind his had already honking.
Dean lifted up his face while keep on chewing his food. “We’re still at this?”
Dean then looked to Crowley with realisation in his eyes, "Those were the whisperings that we heard there?"
The soft reply made Dean jerked so sudden, both Sam and Charlie turned their attentions to him. “Oh, sorry, I almost spilled Cas’ beer. Go watch the film, thank you.”
Jack put up his puppy face to Dean, the one that he knew would always get a pass from Dean, in any non-life or death situation, no matter how upset the older man is, “I don't like the feel of the hole on my lips.”
"Ow, could you stop pinching me?" Crowley turned sharply to his mother. "Yes, I just couldn't bear to see you all depressed without your angel, Dean."
“Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, it’s good for killing time. Don’t worry, Cas. Tiel.”
would be the one who opened his heart to Cas and told him that he
A simple – if not generic – name, but it sent a sharp jolt to Castiel’s heart, and he quickly wear his thick-framed glasses and looks down to the folder Meg had given him to hide the blush on his cheeks. “Yes, my parents were quite religious, they named their children after angels.”
Dean couldn't help to smile at the question, "If you feel like you need one."
He almost missed his stop; luckily, there was someone who also stopped where he intended to. When he entered, Castiel saw the woman he would be meeting with. His other half, who would always be there for him, no matter what. In return, Castiel would also be on her side and protecting her whenever she needed him.
"So, I was
“What are you boys yapping about?” Bobby stepped into the living room and found his boys sat side by side on the couch and slightly pushing each other with each argument coming, just like when they were kids. “Okay, break it off.”
Castiel yawned and continued to look around. He found that the room he was currently in was considered small — smaller than his own. There was a window on one of the corners, and based on what he could take a glimpse of, it was facing the street. The flat-screen TV — the one that had his t-shirt on it — was mounted on the wall, with a shelf filled with games, Xbox, below it. Right in front of him, on the side of the bed, was a wardrobe with a
Charlie looked excited to the news, “Is Claire coming?”
Had Crowley conspire something for him, it managed to get Castiel’s attention at that sentence alone.
Jenny’s demise caught the two vamp-mimes off guard that the hunter in their hands could easily break free and attacked them. Soon, the four of them - two hunters and two vampires - were back in a chaotic fight between mortals and supernatural entities. Punches, kicks, shovings, and every means to hurt were made between them.
“Yes, Claire?” the father turned his head to the daughter, without bothered to get up from the comfort of the couch. As he expected, the son quickly followed behind, and both of them proceeded their bickering. What both children didn’t know was that their father had a pair of earpods inside his ear, so their fight was more like muffled noises to him at the moment.
“Thanks, Naomi!”
“Tongues ripped out.”
That, of course, something John Winchester would frown on.
Even if it was only through the voice, Dean could catch the hint of sheepishness in Castiel’s answer. “That’s an awesome car, Cas. Do you drive it often?”
The Empty placed an elbow on one of the armrests and propped the side of his face there while crossing his legs, eyeing Dean closely.
relationship, yeah?" Eileen asked, and resonating to her confusion and wonder, her signing hands also slower in movements.
“Cas,” the man whose name was called almost jumped from surprise, “Sam and Charlie will join us for dinner tomorrow, hope you don’t mind.”
Well, anywho, enjoy! ^^
“It’s hard to find friends like you two these days, kiddo,” Dean pushed Charlie playfully with his arm.
“Hey, Cas,” he heard Dean said softly, while still praising Cas’ cheekbones with his fingers.
He had his adopted family around him.
Castiel decided to wait for them while having his mind flew to his to-do list for today. For this week he had two projects to work on, and one deadline to meet on Thursday. The first one, of course, the tablets that he was working on with Charlie and the team. The one for Thursday was a short article on creative writing that he was asked to do as a contributor on an online portal belonging to his friend. It was quite curious why his friend asked him to do it since what Castiel did was more to the academic side. But, if he gave it a more profound thought, maybe creative thinking and writing also played some parts in creating a meaningful academic paper or article.
your eyes are!”
After reading the message, and gave up wondering how Charlie could type that much in such a short time, Castiel turned to Charlie and quietly gave her a thumb up as a reply. When he turned his head to his laptop again to check on the uploading files, he smiled as he saw that they had all moved to his cloud storage. “Guys, I’ve finished uploading the files, and now I’m sending the link to you, so we can start working.”
big,” Castiel supported his story by opening his hands as wide as his shoulders.
Cas had to bit his bottom lip to prevent him laughing at Dean’s weak attempt of talking with Cas about something he might interested in, since it involved his big brother, Gabriel. “That sounds like something Gabriel would like, Dean. Will it be open for public later?”
"Nothing. I'm fine," even from the way the little brother said it, it was evident that he was
Which unfortunately won’t help much in this case.
Castiel.
“Shut up. Bitch.”
“I do
“We’re alright, Sammy,” Dean answered, clearly he was trying to shrug Sam away, so he can have alone time with Cas again. Sadly, Sam seems failed to notice it, and it amused Castiel highly.
The seductive voice of Jim Kerr filled Castiel's ears, and he almost couldn't resist Simple Mind's Glaswegian charm to dance. Almost like the effect from that
"I never went berserk."
. His face, his lips, his neck, Dean was sure he could spend hours just admiring and worshipping Cas.
"How long have we been here?" Cas suddenly asked. "Do you think Rowena and Jack would notice that we've gone long enough?"
"What I don't get is Sam kept on denying that he's a witch's apprentice. I mean, even you could see it, right?"
Benny laughed at Dean’s suggestion, “That means someone interesting. Is it Balthazar’s ex?”
Sam didn’t reply verbally, but his big brother could feel the bitch-face filled the air between them. The brother with longer hair then continued reading the notes from his work about the case he was working at the moment.
after every time.
The small team worked significantly throughout the next two hours. It always made Castiel proud how this small team was so passionate about the project even though they were young, and might be easily distracted with things that they found while researching.
“Exactly.”
"Since when you two agreed on something?" Dean protested.
Dean laughed mockingly, "Yeah, you're not gonna get that from me. See, I told you I want to return what Cas told me when we last met before you took him. So I did. What I told him before, that was what I want to say. It's not my fault that you're invested in our little moment before, that you kinda lost track in everything."
Dean copied Castiel's smile before moving forward to plant a kiss on the other man's lips. "I am. What about you, Cas? You told me that your true happiness was not in the having, it was just in the being and saying it. You also thought that what you want the most is something that you couldn't have."
years. It must be weird for them, especially someday when Castiel would bring home a man and introduce him as his
There was a short silence after he said that, that followed by the sound of a beer bottle opening and the sound of liquid substance going through someone’s throat. “So, uh, Sammy was asking about you before.”
out of his league. Once again, Dean felt like he lost a fight he hadn’t even had the chance to face on.
He placed back the plastic spoon that he had been using to savour his lunch into the bowl before him, then he gave the white porcelain a small turn, until he could see the odd painting of red rooster with black mane of tail, and green grass on its side. He then wondered who had the idea to make a drawing of a particular poultry by the weed at an eating dish.
Castiel called Gabriel immediately and practically moped about his failed relationship, and it upset his brother a lot that he decided to find the quickest (and more reasonable priced) ticket to Glasgow, and flew to help Castiel cope with his heartbreak.
roommate. Whom I was quite sure if it wasn’t weird, or I don’t love my sister
“What?”
Castiel chuckled at that, "Thanks, Baz," he said before letting the blonde kissed his cheek and walked to the Impala afterwards.
“Great. Could you get Sammy and Charlie while you’re at it, Cas? His room was on the other side of the house. Just follow the mutt’s sound. Thanks, man!”
Who knew that the cheeky comment from Bela was what everyone in the library needed to break the ice. Dean chuckled at that note, "I told you, honey, this bar is no longer in business. But, I will let you know if Cas is
The surprise in Sam's voice and expression was an answer enough for Dean to assume that Sam really knew nothing about Cas' deal with The Empty.
“You have too many patients, Cas, I don’t want to make you look stupid, bending over to pick up your things, everytime you finished with me,” Dean looked at the dentist from a side-eye, and a smug smile.
Sam chuckled, “Yeah, maybe that’s why I didn’t think of it until today. So, when I finally managed to eject Gadreel, Cas told me that there was something in me, something angelic that resonated with me.”
“I’m, uh, fine. I’m fine, Dean,” as he felt his breath had calmed down, Cas let out a smile and looks at Dean meaningfully, “Hello, Dean.”
“No, Sammy, whoever you had in mind,
Castiel released a warm laugh and quickly his expression changed to a brighter one, “Yeah, if I got a penny everytime someone said that to me. I’m sorry, Dean. I’d love to, and I might have to pick them up at the airport on Friday.”
"He's out, I don't know where he went, or when he's gonna be back, honestly," the broad-shouldered man replied as he extended his hand, "my name's Dean. I'm Benny's roommate, don't worry.
Cas fished for Crowley’s key from his pocket and tried to unlock the door, “Crowley said it’s a puppy, and I haven’t heard about her until three-four months ago. So I suppose on that age? Under a year though.”
“About that, Jack-”
“There
"How did he react?" Sam really got invested in the story.
answer that, Moose," the Scottish man lifted up his finger as a warning, and was met with the other man raising both of his hands in acceptance. "I didn't know how long I was there, until what felt like not a moment ago I was pulled from The Empty. When I opened my eyes, I was at Death's library, with this ring on the desk and a small note with "Use these" written on it and that monster of a scythe that you saw before. Which I customised to my fancy, of course. The original one was horrible, dreadfully outdated."
“Sure, Baz. You stay safe,” Castiel smiled and closed his eyes when the other man pecked his lips lightly and walked away.
Cas had forgotten about the chill on his body as he lined off the call. He walked in and snuggled into his blanket, earning a nosy nudge from his big brother who was channel-surfing next to him before he came inside.
Dean could feel his face burned at Cas’ response, but it was a good burn. “Shut up,” he smiled, “go pick.”
"Everything."
However, when they heard footsteps coming into the library's direction, they quickly stopped the kiss. They separated themselves while looking to the entrance in unison.
“Uh, yeah. I never had my teeth checked, so I don’t know what’s comfortable,” the blond who was laying down before Castiel chuckled sheepishly.
"Rowena just arrived again, so he's working on a spell to get to The Empty with her. They're like teacher and student, so adorable," the girl giggled before she took a piece of sandwich. "Were they always like that?"
“The phone slide off the dashboard, that’s all. But I caught it before it fell to the floor.”
to do with last night, I assure you,” he whispered, but clear enough for Charlie to hear him.
"Hey, who knows? You told me everything, you told me this," Gabriel shrugged and opened the car's glove compartment. "Sam seemed cool, you know. I think you don't have to worry about him, and he was being nice to you the whole night, right?"
“Hey, hey, that’s okay. I was the one who asked anyway,” Dean shrugged, although there still was a string of jealousy in him. “So, your other housemate, he was the British dentist I met the other day, right? Yea high, all suited up in black, fancy accent? He’s called Crowley? Not Fergus?”
. His back was sore, and he found there was a rug burn on both of his knees.
I'm gonna give you a major update now, with FIVE chapters! And each of them are ridiculously long! Eep!
“Yeah, but they won’t arrive until eleven. I, uh, I thought we could do something in between my after work hours and the time I have to pick them up. I don’t feel like going home in between.”
"Then what would I be to
The figure who was now standing next to them started to take shape, from a dense black goo to someone with a strong jaw and chiselled facial feature. Short dark hair that looked like it just bid good morning to bed, and had a few fingers run through it. Then more features that looked even more familiar started to show.
Dean saw the dentist had walked back to his chair, then he got up and followed the man to sit across him. More notes on his file, and Dean felt something odd on his teeth. Tasted a little bit like cloves.
Maybe this was a good move, since the dentist who sat next to him was genuinely surprised. Dean smiled when he saw Cas turned his face towards him in a fast movement and his eyes widened, he was also that close to drop his beer bottle. Dean lifted up a finger in front of his lips cheekily.
“And that was …?”
“So, what’s up with you today?” Sam came with a slice of pie for his big brother and sat next to him. “Wait, few days ago you said that you felt something weird on your teeth, why are you having pie?”
Cas walked to the fridge and opened it to find a six pack of beer, a bottle of wine, butter and a bag of apples. Also a drawer full of vegetables. Maybe the brothers needed to do some grocery shopping in near time. “Apples?”
All this time, Dean Winchester was in love with

he almost shouted unconsciously when he remembered that his deadline might be shorter than he had planned for on Thursday. That would be the day where he should leave for his father's birthday on their summer house in Rhodes Island, a four-hour drive. If he wanted to arrive at a reasonable time, Castiel had to leave at four in the afternoon, the latest, which means his deadline should be at two.

minutes. And it would get
“Still here, Cas.”
“Yeah, man,” Dean leant backon his chair, “I never been going anywhere from this continent. I bet Scotland wasn’t the only country this Novak boy been to.”
“Hey, that’s okay, doesn’t have to be new meal, Cas. If you got something you’re used to make and you love it, we can go with that. Except pasta.”
“Yeah, that one! You’ve seen it, Cas?”
After waiting for the food in his mouth went through his throat, Castiel replied, “He’ll be over later, I made him an appointment to fix his teeth. Why are we talking about my social life, Crowley?”
probably not the best combination out there. Dean wasn’t sure if Castiel would like to see an exhibition dedicated to the cause to half of his patients.
The taller man smiled, still with Cas’ hand in his Dean lead him out from the elevator to Crowley’s door. “So, I gotta ask, how old is the dog?”
“I’m making salad,” the dentist said as he dropped the vegetables inside the trolley.
"You filthy human," he snarled, "all of your love scenes with him was just an act?"
He knew that Rowena was one of the Winchesters' worst enemies back then. Yet, somehow things seemed to change after that night when she was furious for Crowley's death and confronted Billie. A weird night that started with her killing people, and somehow wanted to kill Sam, but ended with her and the brothers sharing a six-pack while pouring their hearts out about parenting and being children.
“Shut up,” Dean stood up from his chair and walks to the kitchen’s direction while Sammy still chuckled at his own joke, “finish your rabbit food wrap then put the plate in the dishwasher. I’ll meet you in the car.”
It might be a slight confession that Cas just gave him, but Dean didn’t care. He would agree to meet Cas anytime!

He wanted to hear it again. He wanted to hear Cas saying that he loved Dean.

Again, the elevator ride was as quiet as the car. Although the action wasn’t. Cas felt Dean wrapped his hand around his between their bodies, and when Cas looked to the man next to him, he was smiling.
day, it’s not hard to get accustomed to his accent.”
The angel probably knew what Dean wanted to tell, and he might or might not be ready to face his consequences. “You don’t have to say anything, Dean.”
There was no doubt that whatever entity that stood before them was wearing Castiel's face, hair, and body. Dean would know that from years and years being with the angel and had his eyes studying him. That was how Dean realised that there was something different from the Castiel in front of him.
The dentist was wearing plaid blue shirt under his dark blue sweater, and those denim really wrapped his legs in all the right ways. His hair was ruffled beautifully, it made Dean wondered how did he do that.
A familiar face with a familiar confused look, a pair of bright blue eyes that implied as they could stare right into your soul, and the full lips that slightly curved to a tentative smile.
It was quick, and Dean moved entirely out of reflex when he heard Crowley shouted, he turned to Cas and held him close. He covered both of them with his jacket, carefully not stabbing either of them with the angel blade in his pocket.
Sam used his network from college to help him find a job, and it was as if the stars were lining up good for them, he found a job on the next month after Dean had.
“Okay, Dean.”
“Hey, Ellen. Sorry that we’re late-
“Okay,” she took Misha upstairs, and on the next minute Castiel could hear the water going.

Maybe John was their father by biology, but as for his heart, Bobby was more of a father to him.
than he knew. Yes, it started out as a curious crush when he first saw him at the canteen. Until said man popped up at his practice’s door, with a smile and friendly yet hypnotising eyes, that made Castiel blushed. He also had that cheeky sense of humour. And the way he looked at Castiel, like he was someone that would solve the puzzle of his world. All those were enough to make the dentist to feel …
It was when Dean blinked that the eye contact was broken, and both men were brought back to reality. “Right, I guess I better off now. So you can finish your day as well.”
“Okay, Cas. Thanks,” Dean heard a soft unlocking sound from the glass entrance door, and he got in, then finding the elevator. Inside, Dean tried to make himself relaxed, so he won't be too nervous when he finally met Cas.
The blueish light then disappeared and revealed Castiel, right before Dean and Crowley's eyes. Still with his signature confused look and squinting eyes. Still wearing the suit and tan coloured trench coat. Only this time he looked awful, probably the effect of being in this place.
Hey, Cas. Sorry for just texting you, I was helping Sammy with his laundry. I swear that kid might never survive without me! Are you still up?
It was a man, probably younger than both brothers, tried to gain his consciousness from what just hit him in the head, or forehead in his matter. The young vampire groaned and asked, “What’d you hit me with?”
The pie got forgotten after a while, and both men only remembered that they were actually sitting there waiting for dessert when Charlie and Sam (finally) walked out from the kitchen carrying three pies, cherry, apple, and pecan.
Cas chuckled at the hint of frustration in Dean’s voice. “No, Dean. I got scared easily, so I don’t watch scary movies.”
Cas grinned as wide as he could before planting another kiss to Dean’s lips and replied, “Can I stay in yours? I won’t do anything funny, I promise.”
“Yes, Cas-oh shit!”
“Dean, what’s wrong?”
“I’ll be arriving Friday night with Claire. Pick us up, will ya?”
“So, here we are.”
“That’s him.”
“You think so, Dean?”
“I don’t think so, since it will be school week. It will be Gabriel only this time,” Cas smiled when Dean handed him a bottle of beer.
His brother’s voice awoken Dean from his short nap that he didn’t remember taking. “Here, Sammy!” Dean called and rubbed his eyes.
Hey, Cas. Got home safely?
to do that many years ago. I told him that he was
Cas smiled widely at the question, then he got up to sit and faced Dean. "Happy," he replied shortly, "and this time, I know I
Once again, the two men in the kitchen were trapped in heavy silence.
Rowena then poured a glass of whiskey and opened a bottle of orange juice (that Demon No 186 magically brought as she requested) for Jack. The young boy didn't look too impressed at the bright coloured bottle, but one motherly look from Rowena had him accepted it with a smile. Soon, the three of them were engaged in a light talk about how Rowena and the Winchesters used to have a complicated relationship, along with Crowley.
The man was looking back at him.
“Why are you calling, Gabe?”
“Claire, that’s our flight,” Gabriel put down his book and turned his attention to his kin, before standing up and approaching his little brother. “Cassie, thank you very much for your hospitality. I expect it to be doubled next time we drop by, now that you have Dean.”
After the two brothers left the room, the other three people shrugged and gossiped about them, especially since Jack asked Rowena how Sam became her unofficial apprentice. Eileen, of course, was ready to listen to the tale.
"Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Is this your first time here?"
He wanted to reply to it.
Dean smiled, "I'm glad. Although, I still want to apologise for suddenly making you a human, Cas."
hours anyway. As well as the sexy librarian.
His mouth kept on talking about lifting up the weird air that was currently surrounding him and his brother, ("So, quit being a friggin' Eeyore, and let's get into this!"), but his gestures, once again, betrayed what he was talking about. That
Dean turned the engine on and the car let out a loud and perfect purr that showed she’s ready to go. The driver turned to the man sitting next to him and wiggled his eyebrows, before letting the car rolled to the road.
The human chuckled as he gave a peck to the kitten’s head before checking his phone. And he quickly jolted back up to sit.
even! For his two years living there, Castiel still couldn’t get over at how spectacular the apartment is. It has its own loft for the bedding area; bed, a small study and wardrobe. On the main area there was an L-shaped sofa, facing the entertainment set, and a window that shows the view of the city, which includes sunrise every morning.
“Great,” Sam then signed to Eileen to tell her what they will be doing now, the girl then nodded and followed Sam out from the library.
“Hello, Dean.”
Thank you for being so patient, and thank you for reading my little project (with a help from some friends) and leaving kudos and comments! <3 <3
That was a statement that Dean didn't expect. Eileen really knew how to lift up spirits, and Dean was thankful for that. "Thanks, Eileen. You too, Jack," Dean turned to the kid who picked up another slice of sandwich. "So, you guys found anything good? Clearly, I didn't do anything useful last night."
But the burn never came. Cas had other ideas.
It only takes thirty minutes before his phone starts vibrating. Thirty minutes for them to notice he’s missing.
The bittersweet smile he wears is quickly replaced when a woman leans against the bar, touches Dean’s arm and smiles, flirts and laughs shamelessly. Castiel bristles when Dean smiles back, though the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He’s seen this before, witnessed Dean ‘work his magic’ in countless bars when Castiel was still an angel. It feels different now.
“Shhh, Cas, it’s okay I got you.”
He vibrates with an energy that calls for chaos and destruction, just barely contained beneath a cracking facade. Wants to claw it away in a rage of primal anger intended for a blonde thirty feet away and not his own skin.
“Did you think I wouldn’t see you?” Castiel’s leg presses between Dean’s thighs, pinning him to the wall.
Dean would think Cas’ use of air quotes was adorable if he weren’t so mortified. His little brother, of all people, setting his
Cas is standing directly behind him, every square inch of his front pressed up to Dean’s back. It would have been sexy…if Castiel’s arms weren’t around Dean’s neck, crushing his windpipe.
She’s the sitter for the baby in a trench coat.
Dean grunts when Castiel nips at his bottom lip, already plump from earlier attentions.
His heart hurts again; he wants to double over and vomit this time. He wants to cry and scream and press the palm of his hand to his chest to stop the pain.
Dean’s going to pass out. At least, he thinks he is.
to Cas.
He doesn’t make it very far - just to the door of his motel room.
He’s learned other things about being human, too. Like how Dean always lets Charlie pick the movie, how the brothers never expect her to cook, how she’s offered the good blanket because she’s a
With a cheeky grin and a quick kiss to the left of Cas' mouth, Dean dropped their plates in the sink and left to find Sam on the porch. He planned on checking out the lead then stopping at the store on the return trip, putting him back at the house in time for dinner. Unless the lead actually turned into a hunt, in which case Cas and Dean would load up and meet him.
he can’t name.
The words ring in his head with an entirely new meaning.
” Cas moaned, his voice impossibly deep. Dean pinched and rolled and sucked on the tight buds until Cas was rutting in his lap.
════════════════════
“Tell me, Cas,” Dean whispered, full of lust and encouragement. “Tell me what you want.”
“I know it makes you uncomfortable when I say it, but it’s true Dean,” Cas explained. “I’m not upset with you - in fact, quite the opposite.”
Dean chuckles. He’s gotta hand it to her, she’s using his line as good as he ever did. It’s like meeting himself as a chick. Too bad he’s happily head over heels for an angel — five years ago he would have been smitten with her.
Much to Castiel’s relief, the Winchester brothers returned to the bunker the next evening, Chinese food in tow.
“Did you want to make me jealous, Dean?”
He turns away, unable to look at Dean’s face for whatever comes next.
do you -
Dean looks distraught. Heartbroken. Hopeful. Scared.
Maybe he never will.
“That’s what happens when you care about someone,” Charlie smiles sadly.
He could feel those better now, too.
- me?” Cas gritted through clenched teeth.
Dean moaned and whined and cried out, completely overwhelmed by this new sensation. The feel of Cas’s tongue plunging into his tight hole felt so wrong yet so,
Castiel’s hand lingers there, long past the point of what he knows is acceptable. But he’s not letting go.
He can’t go back.
In an instant, it’s suspiciously quiet. When Castiel releases his mouth and Dean opens his eyes, the first thing he notices is that they are back in their hotel room. The second is the scowl and sex-hair Castiel is sporting. Dean’s eyes rake over Castiel’s face, taking in every line, every twitch, every blink. He’s a work of art.
And he knows feelings can change, though he doesn’t know how to make it happen.
He just didn’t think it would come so soon…
His eyes flick back and forth between Castiel’s, pleading with him to understand.
She left him, not knowing she’d sewn herself a pocket deep in Castiel’s chest.
It’s actually been 10 days since their last hunt, but who’s counting. Dean savors the last bite of his cherry pie while Sam pokes away at the laptop, looking for a case. Sam tells him to enjoy the peace and quiet while they have it, but Dean is feeling restless. He can’t stay cooped up in one place without going berserk…and eating all the pie.
Castiel looks, he knows he shouldn’t, but he looks anyway, and it hurts.
Cas broke away from Dean’s lips and kissed up his jawline until his warm breath ghosted over Dean’s ear.
By the time Cas’ mouth reached the vicinity of Dean’s rock hard erection, Dean was panting.
She smiles innocently, “For now.”
Castiel chastised him, but didn’t let up on his expertly crafted arm bar. His legs were draped across Dean’s chest with Dean’s left arm trapped between them, Cas pulling on his wrist. It might as well have been a ton of bricks on top of him because there was no way he’s getting out of it.
“Cas, please listen to me,” Dean starts, holding out his hands in a half-hearted attempt to stop Castiel from leaving the motel room. “I don’t know what you think you heard yesterday, but I can promise you it isn’t that. Please just come back to the bunker with me so we can talk.”
Google wasn’t wrong. This place is crawling with ridiculously attractive college students and young professionals, perfect for tonight. Dean smirks at his good fortune...and the pretty blonde eyeing him from the bar. It’s showtime.
“Sam found me in the library the next day and asked about us,” Cas continued, seemingly unperturbed. “He wanted to know if we were together. A couple. We’d never talked about it, so I just told him I didn’t know.”
Dean has — Dean has something else.
Much to Sam’s amusement, Dean and Cas continued their “training” and, from the shy looks and smiles they’ve been sharing, Sam’s pretty sure Dean got the hint.
“Dean?”
Dean ate his BLT sandwich at the dining table in the kitchen while he watched Cas busying himself around the kitchen, admiring the angel’s form in Dean’s tattered AC/DC shirt and the faded blue jeans he’d changed into after breakfast. Dean liked it when Cas wore his clothes; he looked smaller without that stupid trench coat and suit ensemble, but still radiated energy and power.
“Look, I said I was sorry, okay?” Dean tried again, mustering the sexiest grin he’d ever delivered. “Come ‘ere and let me make it up to you.”
Cas prompted him again, quieter this time. “Dean?”
A predatory grin snakes across Candice’s face and for the first time tonight, Dean thinks maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. He wasn’t planning on the flirting going this far, just a few smiles and innocent conversation before Castiel would show up, undoubtedly looking rumpled and grouchy and gorgeous. He wanted to dance with him, show him off, maybe make him a smidge jealous from all of the stares.
Castiel wonders if he was supposed to be a guest, too. Expected to leave. Not overstay his welcome.
“YOU. ARE. MINE!” Castiel roars, his face inches from Dean’s, lips close enough to touch if Dean so wanted.
the Bucket List, but it sure as hell is now. Cas taking charge is still somewhat a novelty, but he’s riding Dean like he owns him. No holds barred. Dean’s silently thanking every God he’s ever heard of.
“Do you even know why I’m upset, Dean?” Cas seethed, inching forward with every loaded word. “Do you honestly think I’m mad because you didn’t invite me? You think I feel left out?”
“I miss you too, Cas,” she says, and the pocket is full again.
He watches Sam and the way he looks at Eileen with life dancing in his eyes. And for once, Castiel knows what it means.
“Cas,” he breathed.
When Sam finally starts tracking a few cases, Castiel trains with determination.
“I didn’t want to get barbecue sauce on it,” Dean answered, proving his point by turning around, barbecue sauce-covered spoon in hand. They both watched as a dollop of sauce dripped from the spoon and landed on Dean’s taut stomach. This wasn’t part of the plan, but Dean wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. His eyes flicked to Cas before he scooped up the sauce on his finger and raised it to his lips. Dean swears he could hear Cas whimper when he began sucking.
“I opened myself up for you, Dean,” he whispered. “So that when we returned to the bunker, I could do
He reads in the library, does quite a bit of thinking in the War Room. Stands in the kitchen staring at the appliances he’s too tired to learn how to use.
It cuts him deeper than an angel blade ever could have.
Sammy and Cas devoured stacks of blueberry pancakes as they talked through a potential hunt nearby, a lead that they younger Winchester was going to follow up on after breakfast. Dean wolfed down his chocolate chip pancakes, listening intently to their conversation, waiting for the opportune moment.
“Dean!” The angel arched into Dean’s mouth as his head fell back against the wall with a thud
“Drinking alone tonight?”

Sam chuckled and gave Dean a sideways glance. “Jerk.”
exactly do you think you are doing, Dean Winchester?” Cas snarled.
But he’ll never have him.
,” Dean grunts with every thrust. “Holy fuck, Cas, please!”
Cas withdrew his fingers once more and lined the head of his cock up to Dean’s hole, ready and waiting.
Whether he means for a drink or for the night, Dean’s not really sure, but the dude’s got balls.
The color drained from Dean’s face. That was the night he and Cas —
Cas obeyed orders and wrapped a hand around his cock, stroking himself in time with Dean’s thrusts. The pace quickened. The only sounds in the room were straight out of Dean’s wet dreams, skin slapping on skin, harsh breathing and Cas’ pornographic moans.
As if to prove a point, Castiel suddenly shifted his weight and rolled over between Dean’s legs. His hands were up, fists closed, signaling to Dean that he could have already punched him in the face. Dean blinked.
“Well, Castiel,” Chad joins in, “you came at the perfect time. Would you like to join us?"
No, not vessel...the body.
He’d actually stunned
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean whispered, finally understanding. He vowed to do everything in his power to stay safe for as long as he could. Dean didn’t know how much time he’d have with Cas, but he didn’t want to be the reason their time together ended too soon.
“Huh?” Dean asked, confused by the outburst. Cas pulled back, locking gazes with Dean. His intense, carnal gaze softened with fondness before those warm hands came back up to cup Dean’s face.
into silence and, for a moment, worried that his behavior wasn’t normal.
“I want to fuck you.”
And oh does he.
A thick finger breeches him, sliding in and out a few times before a second is added. The stretch burns.
Cas turns and Dean bounces on the bed before landing with a thud.
Right.
Dean thought about his plan as he gathered clothes and a towel for the shower. Breakfast footsie went well and the kiss in the garage also seemed effective, albeit impromptu. The shower is going to require a bit more preparation. He locked the door and quickly painted warding sigils all over the bathroom to prevent Castiel from entering. When he was satisfied the sigils, he turned on the hot water and undressed. As he waited for the water to warm up, Dean thought his first prayer.
And make no mistake about it, Castiel
“Holy fuck, Cas.”
The darkness isn’t permanent, it’s a
. Dean can’t believe he waited so long and missed out on this.
Cas crawled onto the bed immobilizing Dean with his hips, ghosting hands up his sides before grabbing his wrists and pinning them above his head. Cas' body hovered above Dean’s, his face dangerously close, so close Dean could count his eyelashes.
Dean followed orders and squeezed his thighs in tight against Cas’s ribs and let more of his weight settle on Cas’s body. He looked at Cas expectantly, but received a punch to the gut instead of instruction. It was a light punch, but the air was still forced out of Dean’s mouth with a hard
Dean looked up and found Cas biting his lip as if holding in all of the delicious sounds he might make. Dean’s thumb tugged on the angel’s lip releasing it. When Dean sucked Cas’s bottom lip into his mouth and nipped at it with his teeth, Cas moaned.
“Losing you would destroy me, Dean.”
much?
Dean decided to start out slow by placing light touches all over Cas’s body with no rhyme or reason to where he went next. His fingertips touched Cas’s left ear, then skipped over to his right nipple, down his ribcage to the underside of his left foot. At the same time, Dean was softly blowing warm breath on Cas’s hand, his collarbone, his hip, the inside of his ankle. That last one elicited a full body shiver from his angel.
The second they were both naked, Cas put a firm hand on Dean’s chest and
Sam lunged forward, snatched the necklace and took off toward the back door. He could handle the spell breaking on his own – and he probably didn't want to watch his brother spontaneously combust from eye sexing a former Angel of the Lord. Dean was rooted to the spot, his gaze locked onto Castiel’s striking blue eyes.
“Dean…”
. He growled and in a single, fluid motion, snatched Cas’s wrists and pinned them both up above his head. Dean was leaning over him, his face inches from Castiel’s.
The Winchester brothers had taken him back to the bunker, patched him up and gave him a room.
This...this wasn’t even
Cas didn’t need time to adjust, as soon as he was fully seated on Dean’s dick, he started to move. Bouncing up and down, rocking his hips, gyrating in small circles. Every movement sent sparks flying through Dean’s body as he held on for dear life.

Castiel’s not sure how long he lies there staring at the ceiling. Long enough to know that he should have eaten something or at least left his room.

“Cas, please...”
He reaches out, clasping Dean’s forearm before he can turn for the door and the man freezes under his hand.
Dean pulls up at the popular college bar Google deemed the “best place for a good time” and parks his baby far away from any potential door-dingers. He thought about writing Cas a note with the name of the bar, but Castiel will be able to find him without it...eventually. Might as well have some fun with it.

Castiel steps up behind Dean, a long line of heat against his shoulder that sends shivers down Dean’s spine. He closes his eyes and swallows against the titillation.
Tonight’s gonna be fun, Dean thought to himself. He’s only done this twice before and each time it was...mind-blowing, to say the least. When you deprive the brain of one or more senses, everything else is intensified — and Dean planned on stripping Cas of sight and sound to maximize touch. He’s already got the blindfold on, but he gave the angel a few moments to adjust before depriving him of sound.
The wound isn’t a small festering thing like before, it’s a wide gaping hole at his core.
Castiel doesn’t respond. His eyes flick to Dean’s lips, then darken slightly. That’s all it takes to send Dean over the edge, off the cliff. He surges forward and kisses Cas like his life depends on it. Maybe it does.
That’s one human thing he’s not ready to conquer yet.
Dean wants Cas to fuck him so hard he hurts for a week — and there’s no way Cas doesn’t know that. In fact, the more Dean thinks about it, the more it pisses him off.
“— and talk to him, Dean! It’s not that hard!”
Dean untied Cas’s hands from the bedposts, grabbed him under his knees and pulled him down on the bed until he was flat on his back. Dean lined himself up and slowly pushed the head of his cock past Castiel’s tight entrance. Dean gave Cas a minute to adjust before sliding all the way home, groaning as he bottomed out.
“I can explain, but I think…” He cleared his throat. “I think we should go home now.”
Dean’s Bucket List of ‘Naughty Things To Do with Castiel’ isn’t committed to paper, hanging on their fridge to check off as they go. It’s more of a tally in Dean’s head to pass the time...and maybe ensure he’s giving Cas the “full experience.” They’re still navigating this whole friends-with-benefits thing, but damn if Dean Winchester isn't going to make sure Cas enjoys it as much as he does.
Judging by the look on Dean’s face, it is not.
A second finger joined the first. Dean savored the stretch and the burn, relieved that Cas was
Dean trumped down to the kitchen, assuming it was Sammy on the phone. Cas leaned against the kitchen counter, right arm cradling his left elbow as he held the ancient flip-phone up to his ear.
Dean yelps when he’s pulled off the barstool. Candice and Chad - yeah, totally fake names - watch with wide eyes as Castiel drags Dean toward the back door. He shoots an apologetic look in their direction, hoping Candice finds another birthday present before the night’s out.
“I’ve studied several types of dance, Dean,” Cas said, sounding vaguely annoyed. “Salsa On2 happens to be a favorite of mine. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
They passed the rest of the afternoon in comfortable silence, Cas doing research and waiting for Sam’s email with photos of the symbols, Dean clicking through the channels and stopping on whatever seemed interesting at the time.
He stares at Cas’ beautiful dick, licking his lips in anticipation. He leans forward, mouth open and ready, before Cas’ hand catches his chin, pulling his face up until Dean’s eyes snap up to his bright blue ones. Cas shakes his head, making a ‘tsk’ sound at Dean, before he reaches down to stroke himself.
“Atta boy, Sammy,” Dean snickered. He didn’t get a chance to say much else as Cas unbuttoned his jeans, dragging them to the ground as he dropped to his knees in one fluid motion. Dean stared open-mouthed as the angel pulled his semi-hard dick out of his boxers and took him in his mouth.
Hearing his name on Castiel’s lips, begging for him in that rough, deep voice was a turn on in and of itself. Dean was impossibly hard now and hesitant to draw this out much longer. He said a quick prayer to Castiel in his head.
So that’s why they call it heartbreak.
Time passes.
Dean raised his arms above his head and clasped his palms together, swinging down and to the left as if using an axe. The shift in body weight produced the intended affect and Castiel’s arms were knocked to the side, freeing Dean from the hold.
He spends more time with Dean.
Charlie’s like something warm, thawing him out bit by bit, so slowly he didn’t realize until it was already happening. Dean is fire, white hot and burning in Castiel’s veins. Sometimes he’s afraid to stand too close.
“God yes, Cas,” Dean sighed, relieved. The next words came easy. “I want you inside me.”
“Castiel,” he bites, his deep voice rumbling through Dean’s body as warm breath ghosts over his ear. If they don’t get out of here in the next five minutes, Dean is going to have the most awkward public boner ever.
Dean turns to leave and only then does Castiel realize he’s been silent too long and Dean — beautiful, uncertain Dean — thinks he’s been given an answer to a question that was never asked.
They wait.
He’s somewhat surprised he hadn’t experienced that sooner.

it. So yeah, Dean dishes it out….
“I don’t share,” Castiel growls, grabbing Dean by the upper arm and squeezing hard enough to leave finger-shaped bruises.
Dean takes one purposeful step inside and shuts the door behind him with a decisive click.
Dean briefly closed his eyes and swallowed around the sudden lump of fear, and arousal, in his throat. He felt the bed dip slightly under Cas’s weight followed by awareness of a pulsing heat radiating from Cas’s body. Dean finally pulled himself together and exhaled; his eyes darted about the room, looking anywhere but at the pissed off, now naked, angel hovering above him.
