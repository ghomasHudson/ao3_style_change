Being this mistaken when anticipating the responses of the one person Sherlock feels he knows best is disconcerting to say the least. If he could only gather his thoughts, maybe he could figure out how to undo tonight and make everything better tomorrow. That godawful creaking doesn’t leave much space for thought processes, though. Sherlock has never had an actual migraine before, but he expects the feeling to be vaguely similar to how he feels now. He has attempted to block it out with painkillers as one would a migraine, unsuccessfully. The creaking continues, sufficiently loud at the moment to pose an obstacle to clear reasoning and analysis. Instead, Sherlock is left with no other option than to turn the evening’s events over in his mind again and again without reaching any conclusion. An activity as frustrating as it is pointless, but Sherlock can’t sleep now.
“We did.” Sherlock chuckles softly. “And round and round we went in there. We were halfway out on the street before Rosie remembered that she’d like to see the swans, so we had to go back. Which is how it ended up being dark before we got home.”
It’s Sherlock himself. All of him, all the time. In a way, it’s always been him. Even if John has never acted
true. What Sherlock knows about John are the everyday things – how he takes his tea, what shows he enjoys to zone out in front of, the way his face contracts when he’s angry and fighting to keep his voice on a reasonable level, which co-workers annoy him at present – and the formalities – his birthday, his elementary school, his family (what’s left of it anyway), the places he’s studied and worked, details of his war service – all of it perfectly organised and repeatedly updated. But it’s with Moriarty that Sherlock can throw one look at another human being and just
Sherlock shakes his head, but even that gesture carries none of his usual confidence. “I had… company.” He looks down. “You’ll think I’m mad.” A scoff and another shake of the head. “Perhaps I am. But it would have worked, I know it would. If I’d been able to go through with it, it would have worked.” A hint of the familiar self-assurance slips back into Sherlock’s voice.
Because Sherlock will never change. He’ll dangle that warmth and affection, that long-awaited admission that
Sherlock hesitates a moment, fighting to suppress a growing sense of panic. Then he makes a decision to follow Jim’s lead, takes a deep breath in through his nose and throws himself into the kiss, abandoning all caution.
It’s as though John is back on the battlefield. The stress accompanying a threat of imminent disaster. The anxiety over the safety of people he cares about. The sleepless nights. The omnipresent need for a drink that goes unsatisfied due to the knowledge that he’s needed where he is and needed in an alert, sober state at that. The sense of duty keeping him at his post, the certainty that it would be
With Jim, it’s different. Jim lets him be who he wants to be, encouraging Sherlock to become his most honest self. Not just who he was before John, but someone even better, even greater, even smarter and sharper. Jim is offering him all this and the path to it is so simple, so natural and straightforward that Sherlock barely has to think about it. He just has to put one foot in front of the other.
John swallows. They can’t go back. Three years can’t be undone, can’t be taken back. He’s married now and Sherlock… who knows what he has seen, what he has experienced and done? Who knows how far that has removed him from the person he was back in that restaurant? Does Sherlock even know it himself?
“You don’t want to go. I heard you. You don’t want to go home, John, so I don’t think you should. If you really wish to, that’s your choice, but it
He fights for two seconds. That’s the time it takes for whatever they’ve injected him with to take effect and for his muscles to start relaxing, growing sluggish and useless. Within ten seconds, he’s lying on the pavement, breath heaving out of him and blood rushing in his ears.
But the time isn’t for that either. As surely as the past three years can’t be undone, what has just happened can’t be undone either. This is not the time to pretend like nothing has happened and go on as usual. They’ve turned their backs on this enough times already. And if there’s one thing the past three years has taught John, it’s that chances like this don’t last forever. They’re gone before you know it. And once lost, they can’t be recovered.
He genuinely is trying. He knows, objectively, that the doctors are doing all that they can. It’s not their fault that it apparently isn’t good enough. Everything that can be done is already being done, Mycroft has made sure of that. If anyone can do anything at this point, it’s Sherlock himself and no one else.
John still catches him every once in a while, deep in thought and completely uncommunicative, frustrated and uncomfortable when disturbed, but lacking the necessary energy to display any actual anger. He just wraps his arms around his legs, looks into a wall and shuts up like a clam, physically and, it seems, mentally as well. Whatever was haunting him before their long overdue heart-to-heart a couple of days ago is apparently still there although there’s no doubt that their talk has cleared the air quite a bit and returned relations between them to a more than tolerable state.
He should have known better than to go to Tesco at noon on a Saturday, of course, but it had been that or missing out on lunch altogether. And now that he was going anyway, he had figured he might as well get some proper shopping done so he wouldn’t have to return to the store for a couple of days. While Sherlock is still too tired to present much of a threat to his environment, John knows better than to get complacent. Sherlock has begun to show signs of boredom in the past few days and a bored Sherlock is a force to be reckoned with. Partly bedridden or not, recovering from a stay in hospital or not.
. He’d said it back then and he’d meant it. That it was alright that Sherlock might not be like most, in his sexuality and in any other aspect of his life. That it was alright that Sherlock was a bit peculiar, that John could deal with it, that he might even like it. That John understood that he was different, even back then, and appreciated that he dared to express it.
But John doesn’t permit him the embarrassment. The shame. It takes a moment for him to get himself back under control. Then he puts his arms around Sherlock and pulls him close up against his chest. His warm chest, familiar and safe and yet new and dangerous. Sherlock unexpectedly feels hot tears stinging behind his eyes. He doesn’t deserve this and yet John – sweet, strong, perfect John – is somehow still here, holding him and comforting him, making him feel as though it’s all alright even though he knows it isn’t. The lump in his throat only rises higher when John brings a hand down on his curls and strokes his hair in slow, meticulous waves.
As John turns on the telly and finds some mundane cooking show to watch (do they produce any other kind of television program these days?), Sherlock shifts into a somewhat proper sitting position, mostly to sit closer to him. John’s jeans are slightly damp against his pyjama bottoms. Is it raining outside? A quick glance out of the window confirms his hypothesis – and a voice springs up in his head, congratulating him on his successful deduction with no small amount of sarcasm. Sherlock isn’t quite sure if the voice is his or not.
“When Mycroft advised me not to tell you, it was after the fact! That day at Bart’s, there were people standing by, snipers, professional, Moriarty had placed them there, they were… they were waiting to see me jump and instructed to take you out, you and Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, unless… Do you think you could have faked watching me commit suicide? Do you think you could have done that convincingly enough for them not to…” Sherlock shakes his head. “I couldn’t risk it, John, I couldn’t risk it and I had no time! I had no time…”
John is smiling slightly while he talks, but his eyes are so sincere, filled with regret and perhaps a hint of discomfort. Embarrassment even. It seems he’s just as aware as Sherlock that they don’t do this. That this is something new, something unmentionable and forbidden unfolding. Something they’ve always hidden away, suppressed and vigorously denied.
John takes a cautious step into the flat, intending to dispose of his jacket and make himself a cup of tea while he waits. He never makes it that far.
Still he hasn’t replied. The thoughts are churning around in his head. He’s turning the same things over again and again, as he has been for days now, without getting any closer to a solution. They just keep repeating all their mistakes, keep postponing decisions, keep oscillating back and forth in their constant dance of advance and retreat. They talk, more and better and deeper than they ever have before, than any of them ever has with another person before, but it’s not followed by action. They talk and they understand, but they don’t change. And John can keep telling himself that now is the time to act, but if it’s all talk and no actual action, then what have they really achieved?
Sherlock never made a conscious decision to follow John’s prompting and allow his emotions through. It just sort of happened. It had felt right at the time.
All those thoughts he barred completely from his mind in the moment of execution immediately come pouring back in. All his fears and doubts and reservations flare up in his head like so many damning sparks of firework.
It’s his most tried and true crutch to lean on when what he is really experiencing is something deeper, something that’s far more complex and uncontrollable. Turning it into anger and directing it outwards deals with the problem in the here and now. It’s not that John is unaware what such a coping mechanism says about his state of mind. On the contrary, he’s painfully aware that his way of dealing with problems is more than a bit not good. He’ll be the first to admit that it’s…
Jim takes him all over the city. The touristy Tower of London, where they dissolve into the most inappropriate of giggles over past robberies. Belgrave Square in Belgravia, where they stop at the former residence of a certain somebody to whom they are both marginally acquainted and Jim berates him for going out of his way to save her while also acknowledging that there was a certain degree of elegance to the manner in which the mission was executed and the execution prevented. Peckham, where they end up in a seedy back alley, loudly making deductions about people who are either too drunk or too high or both to pick up on it, much less offer any form of resistance to their insults. Whitechapel, where they walk in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper like a pair of ordinary tourists, each trying to up the other on grisly details and suggestions of plausible albeit untestable culprits. They get coffee at Starbuck’s, sandwiches at Pret’s, takeout at McDonald’s. It’s been an age since Sherlock has last felt as content as he does walking out of a McDonald’s on Leicester Square at 3 AM and finding a place to eat with Jim by his side, talking of everything and nothing, enjoying each other’s company, just
“Right.” John heads in the direction of her voice to find Mary by the dining table, laptop in front of her and a cup of tea within easy reach. “Busy day?” she asks when he enters, keeping her eyes on the screen. John continues to the bureau, puts down his bag and keys and tries to make it look casual. “What makes you think so?”
To hell with it all. John is freezing, his jacket is sodding wet and his arm is protesting loudly about the way he’s chosen to arrange a litre of milk and a carton of eggs that didn’t fit in the shopping bag he’d taken with him to the store. He stops at the front door of 221, staring at the doorknob with murderous intent as he contemplates how on earth he’s going to get at the keys, conveniently located at the bottom of the shopping bag now so full of groceries that he’s had to carry some of the items in his hands.
“This Christmas. I know it’s not something you, you know… something you really do. I know you’re making an effort and I know it’s for Rosie’s and my sake. I see it.”
The kiss they share just outside the clinic before heading off in different directions isn’t exactly one of passion, but perhaps the setting isn’t really right either. Mary once again reminds him to go find Sherlock a case and John once again reassures her that he’ll do his best and that he’ll let her know if it’s going to be late.
John has no breath to reply with, but it doesn’t matter, because Sherlock continues as soon as he’s got his own breath back.
Sherlock’s hand is resting on the covers and John doesn’t stop to think about it. He places his own hand on top of Sherlock’s.
Sherlock exhales in a huff. “It’s not you, I know that! I know it’s just a figment of my imagination, I know that what you say in my head isn’t
What does Sherlock like? Something personal, something not a lot of people would know about him. Something he would be able to appreciate not just for what it is, but for the thought put into it. John tries to cast his mind back, to remember if Sherlock has expressed a particular liking for anything recently. A Mind Palace would have come in real handy at times like this.
The silent, tormented gaze of the person he loves more than he loves himself. The person who’s proved to him once and for all that whatever thoughts and affections Sherlock might have spotted in his eyes from time to time is no match for the love he has for someone else, the love that Sherlock can see only too clearly. The loud, expectant glare of the person he loves as he loves himself. The person who wants Sherlock, who sees him for who he is and not only accepts him, but encourages him to be the best he can be, and yet now asks him to do the one thing he just cannot do.
Moriarty chuckles softly, inspecting his cuffs with abandon as though he has all the time in the world. Perhaps he does.
Maybe this phone call isn’t such a good idea after all. Sherlock’s reactions are even more astute than initially predicted.
When he doesn’t, it’s because of Jim. Jim can turn up at any time, talking and joking and asking Sherlock to run around with him and do deductions, and Sherlock well remembers how helplessly behind he’d felt that first time when he was still partly under the influence. He’s determined not to embarrass himself any further.
And so he is left with hearing as the sense to focus on. The choked clang of metal against skin is over for the moment, but there are so many other sounds to focus on. Drops of water from the ceiling hitting metal and concrete on the floor below, military boots marching by outside his cell, conversations in Serbian carried in other rooms, music from a radio, laughter, a helicopter above the facility where he is kept. His own ragged breath. The soft clinking of the chains every time he shifts.
“You’ll be the death of me,” John says, lightly to make sure Sherlock understands that he’s mostly joking. For a small part, though, he means it.
A part of his brain is telling him that he might want to get those halfway violent impulses examined at some point, but most of him is too consumed by them to think critically at all. It’s just too easy to transfer the mess that is his shame and guilt and heartbreak and worry and God knows what else into anger.
Knowing, or thinking that he knew, that Sherlock was dead… that certainty that he was gone for all time… that had been worse than this. Sherlock is alive. That simple fact matters more than anything else in the world. Focusing on the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest sends a soothing relief through John, unhampered by everything else. Sherlock is alive. After the Fall, John should actually be surprised by his own worry. Surprised by his fear that Sherlock may not make it through this. Sherlock survived jumping off a seven-storey building onto the pavement below. Now he’s just survived a serious drug overdose. There’s a part of John that genuinely believes Sherlock to be nigh indestructible. A very silly, childish part of him, perhaps, but it’s just about the only comfort he can think up at the moment. When Sherlock had returned after those two years… well, he could have said that he’d survived an avalanche, a volcano eruption and a meteor strike in his absence, that he’d walked through fire and water on his way back to London, and John would have believed it. That Sherlock has lived through all this… that’s as close as you can get to a proof of immortality.
Sherlock isn’t being sarcastic or degrading. He’s listening. He even takes his eyes off the fireplace to look at John instead.
So he doesn’t speak. Just sends her an apologetic look, though he doesn’t allow her any doubts about his decision.
The change is so profound and so sudden that it takes Sherlock a moment to fully register it. No dripping. No creaking. No voices. Only himself and his own thoughts. It’s such a relief that Sherlock momentarily feels himself getting dangerously close to a sob. It’s as though a huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders, a month-long migraine disintegrated. He is alone, alone in his own head for the first time in at least half a year.
angry, he’s bloody furious! But at the same time, he can’t avoid the realisation that just seeing Sherlock, just hearing his voice and feeling the heat from his body, just being bloody near him again after two years, just
In this moment, it feels as if John has found something he has spent most of his life looking for. It’s difficult to define. Is it peace? Happiness? Love? Or is it just Sherlock himself, who as usual manages to outdo regular human conventions and represent everything that John has been searching for in one person?
. But Sherlock doesn’t know how to hold on to the self he becomes during Moriarty’s visits, the self he reverts back to. He doesn’t know how to make it permanent.
“Sherlock…” Mycroft keeps his eyes strictly on his brother, drowning out as many of Moriarty’s smirks and taunts as possible. “Don’t be a fool.”
John stands in silence for seconds that seem to stretch into a minor eternity with Sherlock sitting in front of him equally quietly, each looking at the other, observing, deducing perhaps, but neither of them says a word. Sherlock is lightly flushed from his outburst. Perhaps he’s ashamed at his admittance. John has never truly understood the way Sherlock’s aversion to his own humanity works, but at least now he’s finally beginning to grasp how deep it runs.
John has to hurt himself to keep looking at her. There’s no direct challenge in her gaze, no clear derision or rejection, but he feels it all the same and he has to clear his throat before he is able to reply. He nods, not able to speak after all.
“I have a surprise for you,” Jim reveals. His voice remains calm, but there’s an undercurrent of suppressed excitement now. Like a child at Christmas. “An old friend just dying to meet you.”
I'm so sorry it's been such a long time since the last chapter, but I had to take some time off from writing to focus on moving to the UK for my Master's degree. And then I was really unhappy with the way the chapter turned out and decided to rewrite more than half of it. So here we are, two months later, with chapter 25.
He doesn’t say that he’d rather have had anyone else. A part of him isn’t sure he really feels that way and he doesn’t want to lie.
There are moments of intense adrenaline. Half an hour ago, after a day of unconsciousness with not the slightest hint of change, Sherlock’s heart had gone into overdrive, pumping furiously in his chest and sending his heart monitor into a screeching alarm that immediately called three nurses and a doctor and sent John’s own heart rate skyrocketing simultaneously. It quietened down within a minute and returned to its normal, steady rhythm, but it was enough to scare John senseless. The adrenaline rush that accompanied that narrow escape had not been the least bit pleasant.
Fifth and final chapter! Thank you all so much for reading! This chapter can, again, be read as standalone, but is meant as a sort of completion to this five-part mini-series.
be. And honestly, I don’t think those three things are the same. They feel… I don’t know… incompatible somehow.”
Eventually, Sherlock decides to bypass the finer details. “Mycroft found me eventually and I was able to create the necessary distraction for him to get me out of there. He took me back to London. You know the rest of the story.”
He listens. He knows he should not, but he can’t help it. Those eyes are hooks, drawing Sherlock in and keeping him rooted to the spot. A butterfly basking its wings once or twice before falling still beneath the pin.
Realising that it might be a while before Sherlock is ready to do any talking again, John gestures for Mary to accompany him back to the living room and leave Sherlock to think/rest in peace.
“Oh, please. Don’t be like that, my dear.” Jim leans in, nuzzling his nose against Sherlock’s cheek and letting his hot breath caress the underside of his jawbone, clearly dangling a kiss in front of him. “It will be worth your time, sweetheart. I promise. After today… after today, it will all be different. We’re almost there.”
And it’s difficult to imagine a reality much better than this as John’s hands run over his back, pushing him forward, closer, exploring every centimetre, mapping every muscle, feeling every quiver. He’s making small noises of surprise into their kiss every once in a while, seemingly taken aback by Sherlock’s enthusiasm – or perhaps he simply imagined that Sherlock would have no clue what to do in this situation. John has always been a bit naïve when it comes to Sherlock’s less than appealing sides.
miss how hateful he's finding the whole ordeal and what a nightmare it all is for him to endure. But truth be told, John finds he doesn’t much care.
Sherlock briefly considers delivering a five-minute crash course in geometry, but one glance at Mrs. Hudson and that idea is quickly scrapped in favour of the easy route.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. They seem to zone in on him, like a missile ready for launch. It changes the entire way he looks, the way he holds himself and the expression he carries. He switches from insecure vulnerability to piercing intensity in the blink of an eye. John has never known anyone else who could do that. Though it seems to repel most people, it’s always drawn him in. He finds it almost electrifying, spreading a thrumming beat from the tips of his hair to his deepest core and back. Making a shiver run down his spine.
On second thought, though, perhaps he isn’t dying after all. Unless an annoying, mechanical beeping of what is undoubtedly a heart rate monitor is part of the hallucination, which in that case might better be classified as audio-visual.
Sherlock is looking at him, eyes wide and still ringed with tears. His mouth is open, lips moist and slightly swollen from John’s unexpected assault, and his lower lip trembles.
“I left,” he says at last. It sounds like a confession, as much as Sherlock’s words had done while he talked about Jim. “I left when I shouldn’t have. I knew I shouldn’t have, I bloody
Mary is holding his hand. It’s for reassurance, but it’s for a bit of grounding as well. She’s not being particularly gentle. Quite obviously, she’s trying to prevent him from making an arse of himself. Which he honestly appreciates because he’s not sure he’s capable of doing that himself at the moment.
way. With the outward signs of Sherlock’s hospital stay disappearing bit by bit, it’s getting easier for John’s treacherous brain to wander and for his inappropriate eyes to linger. It’s been a long time since he and Sherlock have spent enough time together for this to be an issue. They haven’t lived together for three years now and though John’s brain has certainly been more than helpful in supplying him with decidedly nonfriendly thoughts and feelings, the (if possible) even less appropriate physical aspects of the whole thing have been mostly stored away. Brief cases punctuated by social occasions in Mary’s presence, which is what he and Sherlock’s interactions have been reduced to ever since Sherlock’s return, have done a fine job of keeping John’s fantasies chronically underfed and his attention focused on what has been available to him in the form of Mary.
Sherlock scoffs slightly, though it comes across as sorrowful rather than condescending. “Important…”
only the night before and thought about his feelings and come to the conclusion that he’s in love with two people and one of them is a man even though John has never been like that and he’d had so many thoughts and feelings rummaging around his head that it had all seemed insurmountable and staying with Sherlock rather than going home to Mary had felt like a symbolic choice and a far too final decision for him to make then and there and so he’d left and now Sherlock is not awake, might not wake again, and it’s all such a huge fucking mess.
for Christmas even though he knows she won’t return the favour. And then there are Sherlock’s parents. John has spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out a present for them, Sherlock having been no help at all. In the end, he’d decided to just go simple and get them a book each, picked out in Waterstones along with Rosie’s picture books and chosen based on John’s very limited knowledge about their interests and pastimes. He’s saved the receipt just in case.
They both stand there, quiet and frozen, listening to Mary as she descends the stairs, throws the front door open and slams it behind her. Only when she’s completely left the building does John spring back into action, unfreezing and staring at Sherlock with a mixture of disbelief and insecurity.
how he longs to cling on to his logic and everything connected with that – his sharp mind, his cases, his whole identity as the genius without a heart – and just let go of his emotions and everything connected with that – his too-vulnerable ego, his depressions, his whole identity as the man who only ever pretends not to care because admitting that it hurts is too difficult. He could do it. Throw his emotions aside, become the calculating machine he so longs to be. A flick of a switch. That’s all he’d have to do.
It’s more the situation. It feels absurdly surreal, sitting here with her and Sherlock, knowing it’s his wife in the chair and his best friend on the bed. It to be the other way around. Then at least some of his feelings would make a little sense. He’s grieving. He’s grieved before. He’s even grieved for Sherlock before. Back then, it had felt
And as they kiss, Sherlock renews his vow to always be there for John. To never let him go again, as long as he still wants Sherlock around. And to never allow his own insecurities to ever hurt John again.
How could he not have known about this? How could Sherlock possibly have managed to keep it hidden from him all this time? They’re old, that much John can tell, but he knows for a fact that they can’t be older than The Fall because John saw Sherlock’s back at least twice before that and remembers it as a vast, even expanse of pale skin that had provoked vastly different thoughts and feelings in him than the ones he’s currently experiencing.
But John isn’t anyone. Not anymore. If he ever was, that man is dead. Perhaps it happened the first time Sherlock kissed him, the first time he felt Sherlock’s enthusiasm equal his own. Perhaps it happened before that, in a darkened hospital room to the sound of a maddeningly steady beeping from the heartrate monitors. Perhaps it happened as he stood in front of a gravestone covering an empty grave under a pine and felt that the world was ending. Perhaps it happened the moment he first looked into Sherlock’s electrifying eyes and felt a shiver of excitement and longing run down his spine. Or perhaps it happened before Sherlock altogether, when he returned from Afghanistan and realised that he had never felt more alive, that he wished himself back in the line of fire so fiercely he hurt with guilt when he thought of some of the friends who weren’t lucky enough to make it back as he had.
Her voice is soft and she’s still smiling encouragingly. Her eyes look out of place on her face. John can’t ever recall Mary looking this…
A mess of long, thin scars, overlapping and criss-crossing their way from the bottom of his shoulder blades to the middle of his back where they disappear only because the mirror in which they are reflected comes to an end. John's bet is that they extend even further than what he can see. They’re hardly raised above the normal level of the skin and Sherlock’s pallor camouflages them to a certain extent, but they’re still very visible under the unforgivingly harsh bathroom lights and John hears himself gasp.
, and though he damns himself with that thought, his entire being hurts at the thought of denying it. He can’t hurt himself anymore by lying to himself. More importantly, he can’t hurt Sherlock anymore by lying to himself. But are those feelings stronger than his feelings for Mary and the promise he gave her when he married her? She’s his wife, his… his
It’s not that Mary is doing anything wrong. Mary is nothing but sweet, quiet, calming, understanding… everything that John could possibly ask for. As always, Mary understands what he needs without having to ask. She takes care of all interactions with the staff and then simply sits beside him, hand is his reassuringly, without pressing for any form of response. Mary does nothing wrong.
He glances briefly towards the kitchen and, to his surprise, finds John looking back at him. He’s smiling. Smiling in that fond, relaxed manner of his that does something to Sherlock he can’t quite understand. It’s like suddenly being enveloped by a blanket, comforting and soothing. Warming him up on the inside.
“I’m sorry,” he says. “But I can’t come home. Not right now. Sherlock is much better than he was and he’s on the mend, but it’s far from perfect. He…”
And just like that, when John returns his eyes to Sherlock, Sherlock is offline again, his eyes closed and his breathing evening out into a slow, deep pace, unmistakably signalling the onset of sleep.
A long silence. Then Sherlock meets his gaze hesitantly, almost shyly. "One can do drugs without ending up on the floor. You do know that, don’t you, doctor?” And he smiles.
Then that moment is over. Reality comes crashing down on him and with it returns the damn noise. John looks away, likely equally aware that they’ve just had another one of their electric moments of eye contact and now, as always, feeling awkward about it.
Still… it’s hardly John’s place to complain and Sherlock doesn’t seem all that torn up about it, so John decides to leave it be. No use getting into an argument with Sherlock’s parents, especially not as they actually do seem genuine in their care and concern for Sherlock’s wellbeing.
As if to further underline the point, Jim immediately turns to him and asks “Where are we, Sherlock?” It's almost become a ritual during the past days. They both know it’s merely child’s play to deduce one’s whereabouts, especially in a city as familiar to the two of them as London, but it’s a part of the game they play that Jim always asks Sherlock to deduce where they are. Keeping his mind sharp and offering an opportunity for praise at the same time.
Sherlock’s vocal cords threaten to wrap themselves around each other uselessly and his voice sounds weak and strained. “Different how?”
At first, Sherlock can only focus on him. He looks the same as always, same body language, same hair colour, same general air about him. But his hair is slicked back, that’s new. And he’s actually wearing some quality clothes for once, a shirt of a dark blue colour that Sherlock is certain he’s never seen before as well as a pair of dark jeans.
“Mmm…?” Sherlock purrs softly in response, a deep baritone vibrating out from his chest. His head falls backwards to rest across the back of his chair in what can only described as a rather obvious invitation. Not too elegant, but Sherlock has never been a man of subtleties and understated flirting has always been completely beyond him.
John isn’t saying his litany out loud, at least he doesn’t think he is. He just thinks, harder than he ever has before, as he wills his thoughts to somehow transfer themselves into Sherlock’s long lost consciousness.
More than anything, John is trying to convince himself that the thought of seeing Sherlock again isn’t making him feel as though a bag of fleas is loose in his gut. Those people who say that nervous anticipation feels like having butterflies in your stomach have obviously never experienced real nervous anticipation. They make it sound as though it is a wonderful, beautiful feeling when in reality it merely feels as though you’re on the brink of a panic attack and wilfully heading straight towards it at a hundred miles an hour. Despite being keenly aware of the embarrassment he’s currently subjecting himself to, John just can’t bring himself to enter. He still has a key, he could just step right in as if he still had a right to call this home, but he needs a moment to compose himself beforehand. Figure out what he’s going to say. Should he be angry? Accusatory? Or should he just say what he should have said yesterday? That he’s angry, that he’s furious, that he’s deeply hurt and that he demands answers before he will even consider forgiveness, but that he’s also just so fiercely glad that… that what? The part of John that is merely hurt and angry is easy enough for him to voice, but what about the not inconsiderable part of him that is simply so relieved, so grateful, so amazed that Sherlock even exists? How is he going to voice that part? In truth, that’s what he’s spent most of his day pondering when he hasn’t been assaulting his patients expecting to find Sherlock underneath a wig and a pair of glasses. John isn’t the sentimental type, never has been, and Sherlock isn’t exactly the type to appreciate it either. It isn’t like either of them to discuss any other feelings than annoyance and frustration with one another. For them to have this conversation… hell, they need to have this conversation, this John knows, but how they’re going to go about having it is an altogether more serious problem.
John vaguely registers that his cheeks are hot and understands that he just might be blushing. But there’s only a few scattered brain cells to process it.
At that thought, a sharp stab of pain flares up inside of him and he hurries to suppress it. It’s almost a reflex. Analysis: unhelpful emotional response concerning John’s relationships. File number: 3341.
“I was not alone while I was… away,” he admits. “Jim Moriarty was there. I… needed to know if he was still there.”
John has to let his breath out in a gasp before he can find his voice just long enough to raise it and shout, shout so it can be heard by every person in the general vicinity.
With a bit of effort, the padlock is removed and the door swings open on creaking hinges. Behind it, a poorly illuminated staircase leading downwards. Cement walls. Bare lightbulbs momentarily blinding him as he looks at them. When they don’t flicker. He really should get some of this fixed. Install new appliances and maybe give the whole thing a fresh coat of paint. He just can’t find the energy to get it done. It’s so cold down here.
John knows a dismissal when he hears one. But he doesn't like the sound of this particular dismissal. He clears his throat. “You’re not alright. Or, well, you might be now, but let’s not risk anything. Do you have any food in the fridge? I could make some pasta or-…”
His eyes stay on the cup as he plays through his freshly composed piece once again and tries to decide whether or not the second stanza is too fast to be used in a traditional waltz. Mrs. Hudson’s vacuuming of 221A below, clearly audible through the floorboards, isn’t helping his concentration, but then neither is the incessant creaking that seems to have replaced John as his live-in companion lately. Indeed, it seems to only ever give him a break when John is around and then returns to reclaim his attention as soon as he’s left to his own devices. It’s more than a little disturbing. But the only solution seems to be a return to the basement of his mind palace and Sherlock is somewhat less than motivated to do that considering how well it went the last time around. Besides, there’s no time now. The wedding is in four days. Sherlock can’t afford to get side-tracked, auditory hallucinations be damned. Surely it won’t hurt to postpone the operation just a few more days until everything is nice and settled and John and Mary are off on their obligatory post-wedding sex holiday. Then Sherlock will have more than enough time on his hands to fix any problems that might arise.
And the memory of sitting in that window haunts him. When John is out. When Mrs. Hudson isn’t hoovering. When it’s quiet in the flat and the only noises are coming from outside. In those moments, he can’t seem to shake off the fear that he’s back. That the door is locked and John isn’t coming back. It’s irrational, it’s illogical, but he can’t calm down, can’t think of anything but the crushing uncertainty. Has to go and open the door several times, often two or three times every ten minutes, just to make sure it can still be done. Paces the flat from one end to the other, glances out of the window, curls up on the couch, round and round he goes until he hears the front door and John coming up the stairs. Only then is he able to relax and breathe properly again. It’s driving him mad. He can’t stand it anymore, can’t stand the shame and the anxiety and the weakness. If there’s even the smallest chance that telling John how he feels might make it all just a little bit more tolerable, he’ll happily struggle through.
. It’s the first eligible thought that passes through his mind, a brief and instinctive moment of utter panic before Sherlock manages to calm himself. He did not leave the door open. He deliberately opened it wide after carefully thinking the possible consequences through. Now he’s back, out, and nothing seems to have changed. The world hasn’t ended, everything is back to normal.
John feels himself swallow and it leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. Seeing Mary is definitely the right decision.
As he heads down towards the final door, Sherlock deliberately reaches out and lets his hands run across the other doors along the hallway, picking up bits and pieces of memories and information along the way. His textbook from elementary school. His lab set-up from university. His raincoat from a summer vacation in Scotland in 1983. Harmless little reminders, nothing more. But he knows what’s behind those doors, why he’s chosen to place them down here where he doesn’t have to look at them every day. Where he can forget about them entirely for months or years at a time.
So when at last Sherlock speaks again and all he has to say is “No, I don’t think so,” in a tone clearly meant to indicate that this conversation is at an end… well, then John lets him make that decision and goes out in the kitchen to make himself another strong cup of tea.
Sherlock hasn’t mentioned Mary with as much as a word since the kiss. Neither has John, though it keeps churning around in his head along with a thousand other unfinished thoughts.
Sherlock feels his face contract with emotion, betraying the sting. Jim pounces on it without remorse.
, just slightly out of John’s reach and take it away whenever John reaches out to claim it. He’ll smile and laugh and charm until John feels just about ready to come right out and tell Sherlock
John swallows. What Sherlock is telling him now… John can hardly wrap his mind around the implications. Has it been like this all the time? Has Sherlock been living in a dreamworld all his own every time he’s closed his eyes? Like a perfect simulation? Or more like a hallucination? How can that even be possible?
Jim’s voice has done another pendulum swing back to sympathetic. He leans forward in John’s chair and Sherlock's gaze is invariably drawn to his.
house, and all he wants to do is go back to before they met and undo everything that happened afterwards!
What gets to him, what causes his heart to beat faster, the adrenaline to pump through his body and his vision to turn red is the way Sherlock seems utterly unconcerned about the danger he has subjected his own body to. John can’t help but picture the room where he found Sherlock, the rusting pipes, the damp mattresses, the scattered syringes. John can’t help but imagine him lying there for God knows how long, alone and high with no one there to keep an eye on him. Nothing about that decrepit house looked sanitary enough to be considered anywhere near safe. And yet Sherlock has wilfully subjected himself to that risk without even bothering to look for an alternative. Or, you know, just God damn telling people! That’s all it would have taken. By God, if Sherlock had shown the least bit of interest in seeing John again after the wedding, if Sherlock had given the slightest hint that he wasn’t quite okay… John would have been at his side within the hour. That Sherlock seems downright annoyed by the fact that his friends care too much about him to not just shrug and let him carry on doing whatever he wants… it’s the exact same hurt John feels now as he did that night in the restaurant some months back. When he looked into Sherlock’s eyes for the first time in two years and realised that he actually hadn’t considered how much his supposed death had hurt his friends. Had hurt John.
“It's not what you think,” he noted indifferently. “And just so you know, Mycroft doesn't have issues with being gay. He has his little dirty secrets himself. “
"God, yes.” John kissed him back, his eyes shining in the dim light. “You're the best and most beautiful gift I have ever received for Christmas." He ran his hand along the curve of Sherlock's body until it rested on the man's buttock. “And this gift is even more precious because this time we're both going to remember every moment.”
Sherlock pouted. “No, not exactly,” he replied nonchalantly. “They all know what an intercourse is, don't they? All have done it; some of them,” a tiny, knowing smirk appeared in the corner of his mouth, “still do it regularly, even if having a helping hand. Actually, some have more than one volunteer, occasionally the very same time.”
“More than twenty years. I'm kind of an accessory to the estate,” Barnaby laughed. “Know every corner in the house and around. Lady Isabelle appreciated my work enough to keep me even when I couldn't do everything I used to. She’s a good person.”
The ex-army doctor's face flushing deep red, he gaped at his flatmate and the laptop screen. Sherlock watching themselves having sex was... He couldn't find the proper term to express his awkwardness. How the hell did the detective acquire that recording? Actually, when did they start  to tape their intercourse in first place?
“Just a minor rise in my temperature, that's not the end of the world!” Despite being sick, Sherlock was still well enough to protest.
John  sighed again, his fingers caressing the detective's silky curls. “Sherlock, crazy as it sounds, but I'm not ashamed of you. Annoyed, furious, yes, but not ashamed.”
The early morning light licked the naked crowns of the trees, reflecting on the rain-soaked leaves and undergrowth. The autumn mist wrapped the forest into a big cocoon, spreading the chill on the ground. John stirred, shivering badly. His hair and clothes wet from the night's downpour, he felt like he had been sitting in a pool for hours. As if compensating for the cold, something heavy but warm leaned against his chest, alleviating the bite of chilly air and providing some comfort. Blinking his eyes open, he remembered all that had happened the evening before—the chase, Sherlock's injury, the necessary decision to spend the night in the woods, the mental quarrel with his father. He looked down at the sleeping detective snuggled against his chest, his breathing laboured and body trembling. Moving a hand to the pale face, John realised the reason why Sherlock was radiating that delicious warmth—he surely had fever. His cheeks were burning and teeth were chattering heavily. They needed a roof above their heads and dry clothes as soon as possible.
“I always knew that I would be lost without my blogger,” he returned the smile and pulled John into a loving kiss.
As usual, the 'thank you's are in order to you, my readers, everyone who left kudos or comment, I truly appreciate it!
A content smile appeared in the corner of the detective's mouth. He loved making John Watson speechless. And he was up to continue to do so. His hand sneaking under the pillow, he rolled out a small plastic bottle of lube, and popping off the lid, smeared some of its content onto his fingers. The  other hand travelled between the doctor's buttocks, and John hissed as the cool gel met his anus.
“Damn it, Sherlock, how the hell can you think that I'd get up and walk away, just because you're a virgin?! You really have twisted ideas about love! Even if we ignored that drunk night, I'd not leave you, you git! How can you assume such a thing of me?!” He inhaled heavily, upset. “You don't know what a precious thing virginity is? It's not something you should be ashamed of. Okay, being untouched at the ages above thirty isn't a common thing, but it happens. Nowadays, people often rush their first sexual experience, having it in their teens, but there still are some who want to wait until they found their real love and give their first time to that special person. It's like a valuable, treasured gift. I know it's not the same in your case due to the lack of interest and such, but I'm still flattered to be your first. I just wish I had known it that other night,” he sighed regretfully.
Grimacing, Sherlock sat up and reached for the button in question. “You're dangerous,” he noted while unzipping the certain clothing.
The date of the next two update is uncertain at the moment as I'll be away on holiday in the next two weeks. Sorry, my dears. I'll try to update asap. *hugs*
John valued promises, regarding their violation a crime. Being aware how important and crucial this certain vow between them was to him, Sherlock reckoned that John would be disappointed in him. On the other hand, John was just a human being, prone to failure and temptation, and knowing how desperate Sherlock had been to revisit physical intimacy with him, he might reconsider his approach. Sherlock wasn't sure which would have been the more likely scenario. Yet, he had never been famous for obeying rules or for restraining from doing things spontaneously, and certainly, and this situation wasn't the time to start doing so. He could always blame his feverish state for his actions.
“You'd better get used to it. I need photographic memories of our happy times,” John reasoned and snapped a picture. Checking the image, he snorted. “Come on, you can do better than that!” Sherlock sighed, and, surrendering, pulled a lovely smile. “That's it!” John admired the photo. “Aren't you beautiful?”
Thank you very much for the amazing feedback for the latest chapter! It made me really happy! *hugs all*
London hadn't seen a white Christmas for many years. Sherlock didn't care what winter was like in the city, unless the weather affected his investigation or influenced the crime in some way. He considered snow nothing but a meteorological phenomenon, and—apart from the beauty of the crystallised structure—he didn't find it more intriguing than rain or wind.
During the time by the detective's side both as an assistant and friend, they had forged a bond, a strong, unique companionship that went beyond the usual boundaries of friendship. It was a rare, special connection based on mutual trust, respect, acceptance and devotion, something John had never had with anyone before. An exhilarating bond that turned his days warmer, brighter, and made his life worth living again. He had a reason for waking up in the morning and looking forward the to each day, knowing that he mattered to someone. Even if that often meant fetching things or unknowingly being involved in the ridiculous experiments of his infuriating flatmate. Unlike many others, Sherlock didn't see the invalid ex-soldier in him, pitying him, but considered him a valuable man, relying on his opinion and skills. The detective had entered his life when he had needed help the most. Without him, John Watson might have not be alive. Sherlock Holmes saved him from making a grand mistake and gave him a purpose. And John Watson was eternally grateful for all that.
With the frown lines smoothed out on his face, the pink lips parted a little, the dark eyelashes fluttering once in a while, Sherlock was beautiful, despite being sick. Ironically, the fever-induced rosy shade in the detective’s pale cheeks finally gave him a bit of healthier colour.
John smiled reassuringly, caressing Sherlock's hair gently. “I'll guide you along. Just do what your instincts tell you.” Walking over to his armchair, he sat down and beckoned Sherlock over. “Come here.”
“So I deduce that the ‘friends with benefits’ construction is not an option in our case,” Sherlock cracked a little smile. “As both parties contradict the no emotions part.”
John's calloused fingers caressed Sherlock's erection. The tender, cautious touch was nothing like his limited experience when he was young. The hand fondled him with such care and affection that Sherlock never imagined to be possible.
There are no printed newspapers on Christmas Day in the UK (almost everything is closed in London that day), the only paper that has an online edition is the Sun (info's from the internet, so if it's incorrect, the net is to blame! :) ).
Sherlock looked up tentatively, finding John's sparkling blue eyes smiling at him with a level of love that he had never seen.
John's mouth and hands worked magic on him. Panting hard, Sherlock writhed on the bed, gripping the sheets tighter, as the powerful sensations overwhelmed him. Every inch of his body was on fire, his heart pounded loudly, and his always sharp mind was engulfed in a daze.
Sherlock was both relieved and disappointed. He was excited that John had agreed to give their relationship a try, but he wasn't enthusiastic about going slow. He wanted to feel John's warmth against his body in the morning, to feel safe and content. But it looked like he would still have to wait for that. Then again, a 'maybe' was better than a 'no,' and John was definitely worth it, so he had to accept the ultimatum.
John shifted suddenly, and Sherlock thought that he would be discovered in a moment. He held his feverish breath anxiously, biting his bottom lip. John mumbled incoherently. Sherlock couldn't make anything out of it, until the muttering became more articulate and John breathed his name. Sherlock jerked his foggy head, wondering if it had only been the fever playing games with his mind, or that John was indeed dreaming of him. As if in answer, John muttered his name again, accompanied by a low moan. Sherlock's face heated, and his breath caught at the unexpected scene.
Sinking down on his knees, Sherlock wrapped his fingers around the engorged cock, his heart pounding wildly against his chest.
Although they had been given separate rooms, John stayed with Sherlock in the detective’s room; he just couldn't leave the sick man on his own. Once they entered the room, John switched immediately into doctor-mode and gave Sherlock some pills to bring his fever down before filling the tub with lukewarm water and escorting the shivering man into the bathroom. Undressing him carefully—refraining from sneaking glances at Sherlock's intimate bits and staring at the fine, sinewy body—he carefully helped Sherlock into the tub.
Finally sorted out the chapter count, so now the total number of chapters are added. 33, that's it. :)
Police officers are not armed by default, there are the special units that have weapons. SCO19 is the British SWAT. I'm unsure though if they were called SCO19 on 6th Jan 2012 (the point in this fic's timeline), as they changed name from the previous CO19 in Jan 2012, but their website doesn't specify the exact date. Also I believe, the team appearing in this scene should be the TST (Tactical Support Team)  that handle cases like terrorist threat etc. and contains the SFOs (Special Firearm Officers).
Labels or no labels, John was sure that he was in love with Sherlock. The last—and actually, the first—time he was in the same bed with the man, John had had no idea how he felt about the detective. Now, things were different, and John was certain of his feelings. How things could change in a few weeks!
Whatever they were, he couldn't let go of them. It felt like they were a missing part of him that he had finally found. Feeling like that about John felt more than right.
Finally getting rid of their clothing, John ran his fingers along Sherlock's collarbone, chest, hip and thigh, drinking in the beautiful sight in front of him. “God, Sherlock, I want you so much.”
John's hand sneaked under Sherlock's pants and squeezed his bum eagerly. The intimate touch sent a pleasant shiver along Sherlock's spine. “John...”
Taking a closer look, he confirmed that the recording was real indeed, and, from the surroundings concluded, it must have been taken two days ago when he and Sherlock hadn't got to the detective's bedroom, and consumed each other on the floor of the living room. Knowing the particular fondness of spying on people, the only source of this home video must have been Mycroft Holmes.
John stroked him with more pressure, and Sherlock felt his cock growing in the warm hand. He exhaled soundly, arching into the touch. Wet lips peppered tiny kisses on his length, before being engulfed in the tight heat of John's mouth. Sherlock groaned loudly and threw his head back on the pillow. The sensation of John's mouth around him, sucking lightly, was so new and pleasant that he swore to store every bit of the feeling in his mind palace.
, he thought as he bit his lip fearfully and gently tilted Sherlock’s head toward himself, caressing the hot face with his thumb. “I'm back. I've got help.”
Right, breathe now! Everything's fine! :) Sorry for giving you the fright, but you know me - angst girl here! :)
John smiled happily. Sherlock easing into mundane aspects of life and love filled him with pride and affection. The self-labelled sociopath transforming into a feeling human of his own volition, in front of John’s very eyes, was something beautiful and bewildering, and John was immensely honoured to witness such a persona change. The fact that Sherlock did it for him made him even more flattered.
John smiled. “Yet, I'm sure not everyone shares your admiration toward her. There are always people disagreeing with some decisions. One cannot humour everyone.”
“That's definitely an option to pursue later,” Sherlock smirked weakly, his voice hoarse. “Lestrade's handcuffs could finally come handy.”
The subconscious memories of that drunken night lacked sensation, so Sherlock had no preconception of how being with someone in that intimate way felt. He was completely at the mercy of his transport's unknown responses. It was frustrating and terrifying.
Sherlock’s throat tightened at the pleading, warm expression on John’s face. “If I say it, I won’t be able to let you go,” he choked, the overwhelming emotions straining his chest.
John was stunned at his friend's reasoning. He had never thought of love like that. “Uhm, Sherlock, that's all about feelings, which are not your area.”
“I didn't want to interrupt the lovely tirade you delivered; it was quite entertaining,” Sherlock remarked calmly, a barely noticeable smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock sighed in surrender. He must have been in too much pain to counter any longer. Leaning back against the tree, his eyes shut closed. “Go,” he breathed in resignation.
"Now you ask me if I have feelings for you, and I can't find the right answer, because there are so many ways you affect my life." Taking a deep breath, he continued. "I enjoy your company, I need you being around me to function properly. You complete me and make me feel alive. You're my guiding light, my compass, my home. I don't think I could live without you anymore."
“You know this doesn't change my feelings about your little spying game,” he raised a brow, taking a look at his flatmate. “I still disapprove what you did earlier.”
This chapter still contains some triggering bits I mentioned in the previous chapter, so as I suggested there, if attempted rape, sexual abuse and violence upset you, skip this chapter too!
His trembling fingers hovered above the wound tentatively, and his eyes searched John's, asking for permission to touch.
Poor Barnaby didn’t notice how much he was spilling about the family, John thought. Lady Isabelle surely wouldn’t approve it, but for them, it came in handy.
Sherlock must have sensed his inner battle and need of encouragement, because he noted desperately, his pleading gaze burning John’s skin. “I need
The awe on John’s face, as always, warmed Sherlock’s insides. Like rays of sunshine after cold, rainy days. Again, Sherlock realised that he couldn’t exist without John anymore. The doctor wasn’t only his conductor of light, but the very sun in the sky of his life.
No matter how annoying the detective's nosey attitude was, John's pulse quickened at the thought of him and Sherlock making good use of a pair of handcuffs.
“Exactly. Well, would you ask me again, I–” Sherlock placed his hand on John's tentatively. His deep and slightly hoarse voice was both anxious and hopeful.
Who said that coming to terms with your feelings for your friend was easy? After some soul-searching, Sherlock and John finally have a heart-to-heart talk that changes everything...
"I'm not wrapped in ribbon, but if you want, I can be your Christmas present," Sherlock breathed a small kiss onto John's mouth.
“I might have not, but still... It matters to me. You deserve to be treated with special care during your first time.”
“Shit, Sherlock, shut up!” John burst out and sat up on the bed. Sherlock could see him desperately trying to put the pieces together and interpret the situation. “But we... oh,  Jesus,” John bit his lip as reality dawned on him. “You were...”
“Where's the problem?? Where's the fucking problem? I'm telling you where it is: this was recorded without our consent by your dear brother, who handed it to you as it was yesterday's paper, and now you're watching it as if it was anything but an afternoon soap on the telly. Sherlock, it's our fuckin' fucking, for heaven's sake, not fuckin' Coronation Street!”
Once again, thanks a lot to everyone who left kudos, comments along the journey, or just read the story (even if only a  few chapters). You have no idea what your support and feedback means to me.
Sherlock stared at him incredulously. “You think I’m appealing?” He asked tentatively, searching his friend’s eyes closely.
Sherlock's mouth curved into a wide, happy smile, something John hadn’t seen before. Sherlock was about to lean in and kiss him, but a moment’s apprehension had John stopping him.
Thank you for reading, commenting, leaving kudos, I truly appreciate it. Hope you'll like this chapter.
Sherlock found that the new situation of John and himself being involved with each other was even more exciting than any case. It promised so many new experiences, possibilities, many things he had not explored with anyone before. John being his conductor of light, partner in crime, best friend and colleague made him the perfect person to introduce the inexperienced detective into the world of love and take him onto the road that Sherlock wouldn't have stepped on otherwise. No one else was interesting, smart and loyal enough to entice him there. John Watson turned his life up-side-down, and Sherlock Holmes didn't mind it. With his affection, trust and love John brought the incomparable, unique thrill into the detective's life, something he hadn't known before.
The contrast of the damaged skin and smooth torso was vivid; the knotted, healed tissue like a miniature octopus stretched its tentacles on the cream-coloured flesh. Anger rose in Sherlock's guts.
Sherlock straightened his back without turning his head to look at John, stubbornly giving him the silent treatment.
But what feelings were they? The satisfaction of their comfortable companionship having grown on him, magnified into something more, which could ebb once the magic of novelty was gone? Real love in its romantic meaning or just heightened admiration or deep infatuation with the only man who truly accepted him, who could see his true self and still want to be by his side, caring for him?
"John hadn't seen anything more sensual than Sherlock devouring the heavenly dessert from his hand. There was something very sexy about feeding chocolaty stuff to Sherlock Holmes. The man indulging in such an ordinary, dull aspect of life—like enjoying the wonders of food, which was almost always utterly beneath him—mesmerized John. It was such a rare sight that, had he had a mind palace, he surely would have stored the image there. The appreciative sounds leaving the detective's throat also were something to relish and remember."
Sherlock's eyes opened slowly, and his dazed, glassy gaze met John's worry-filled eyes. Along with the consciousness, the pain in his ankle must have returned as well as he reluctantly pulled a bit away with gritted teeth.
remember everything now.” Seeing his friend's confusion, he added with a sigh, “Memory recovery technique.”
“Didn't ask for the scientific explanation, thank you very much,” John laughed, hushing Sherlock with a finger on the mouth. “What I meant was… Do you understand what this could actually lead to...“
“Yes, that's fine too...” As if reading his mind, John approved the choice in a bare whisper, his eyes rolling back in pleasure.
"Sex doesn't interest me, that's true," Sherlock cut in. "But it's not just sex, it's sex with you. I wanted to give you something special this Christmas, a gift you like, and as your life is lacking of sexual encounters these days, I thought this could be the perfect present. The fact that you like me helps," he shrugged.
This chapter's triggers: graphic description of a HIV/AIDS patient's condition and the progress of the illness.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, feeling suddenly really awkward. “Oh, do keep up, John. Don't make me repeat myself; it's so dull.”
"Not good, alright, got it,"' he sighed resignedly. "However I thought I found the perfect gift for you, now I have to find something else.."
“Oh, Sherlock, do I really have to break it down for you?” John couldn't suppress the laughter any longer.
John caressed his warm cheek reassuringly, apparently realising how ambiguous his reaction could be. “No, you didn't,” he murmured hoarsely. “I just want to be sure that you... that you’re completely aware of what's going on.”
John immediately jolted away from Sherlock like a frightened animal and plastered himself against the headboard, blinking rapidly and gasping loud.
His orgasm was nothing like those limited times he clumsily experimented on himself when he was young. The bliss he felt now was incomparable to the unsatisfying attempts in the past. Blood was singing in his veins, every fibre of his now boneless body tingled, and his constantly whirring mind finally stilled, clouded with the only thing he was aware of—
God, this is it!! The last chapter of the story! Can't believe it! My first long, multi-chapter fic is complete! :)
John Watson took the stairs with a smile in the corner of his mouth. Getting home to Sherlock felt slightly different – and different meant good this time - since they had finally taken the first, tentative steps to change the nature of their relationship a couple of days ago. Friendship turned into dating with occasional sexual encounters. From that day on, every hour had passed with learning something new of how Sherlock&John functioned, what benefit Sherlock&John had that Sherlock and John separately didn't. A new chapter of their story had started, full of novelty, anticipation and passion.
“We're going out tonight, you'd better know that.” The detective needed food, even if he didn't share the opinion. The only way of forcing the genius to consume anything edible was taking him to a restaurant.
He had never thought to ever become the subject of someone's genuine affection, let alone the reason of someone's arousal—that seemed to be utterly improbable.
John hadn't felt so alive and happy for a long time. Life seemed to have taken a good turn, things looked brighter and full of promise. His identity and sexual crisis resolved, a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders and he finally felt free of the demons that wedged themselves between him and Sherlock. After so long alone, he had someone in his heart again, someone filling his days with warmth and colour. Sherlock made him whole, gave his life a reason, and finally, John could embrace his love openly and wholeheartedly. This evening was just the icing on the cake.
Suddenly, all the lack of intrigue that he felt about sex and being touched was gone. All he could think of was John touching him, making his fantasies come true.
Turning his head slightly, he found Sherlock's sparkling quicksilver eyes smiling at him. The most mesmerising eyes in the whole world—the different shades of blue, green and grey blending artfully underneath the golden flecks in Sherlock’s irises.
Sherlock held John’s gaze without a flinch, making sure to keep his expression impassive, but open and unchanging.
Shock flashed through John, and his heart sank realising how unsure and oblivious Sherlock was under his facade of utmost confidence.
“I'm sorry that you have to deal with an inexperienced partner,” Sherlock turned his head away in shame. “You're not used to that. I understand if you don't want me anymore.”
Tentatively, he leaned in, his heart beating wildly in his throat, his breath lingering on John's face. Ever so cautiously, he closed the gap between them, his eager mouth brushing against John's dry lips. He was prepared for John's eyes to snap open and glare at him, but that didn't happen. Instead, after a moment, he kissed him back slowly. Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise, but he didn't pull back.
“Are you listening?” John prompted him, moving in the doorway of the kitchen. He fixed his gaze  on Sherlock. “Have you heard what I said at all?”
“Oh right,” John sneered. “You Holmes brothers... One needs a respective vocabulary to you. Seems like both of you have a twisted aspect of privacy issues.”
“I know what you mean. Her elder son, Patrick, thinks that she’s too cautious and afraid of following this modern world, just because she prefers the beaten path instead of taking risk.”
“John...” Worry etched Sherlock's face. “I'm sorry,” he muttered and unwrapped his arms of John in an instant. “I...” He bowed his head in remorse. “I shouldn't have done that. You made clear that you aren't comfortable with your scar, yet I ignored it... I didn't want to cause you any pain. You have every right to be mad at me. I'm sorry.” The last words were a bare whisper.
“I fucking know!!” John yelled and yielding the laptop from his flatmate, snapped it shut. “Say bye to the movies. Funfair's closing.”
“This shirt is pure sex,” John muttered huskily, taking in the sight, while undoing the buttons languidly.
This chapter is dedicated to my faithful readers, chahnre and Equilibrium_29! You always make me feel that the efforts and time invested in writing this fic was not in vain. Thank you for your constant support! <3 <3
Ever since that trip down memory lane, Sherlock had desperately longed to revisit the sensations that John's closeness offered. Remembering them wasn't enough anymore; he needed the real feeling instead of the images of his subconscious memory.
“You can't even give me the satisfaction of punching your smug face, can you?” John hissed through his teeth.
“I'm going to kill Mycroft,” he hissed, his eyes searching the room for the possible hiding place of the spying cam. “He doesn't know the word privacy, huh?”
Thank you for the kudos, comments and bookmarks for the first chapter, thank you for giving this story a chance in the myriad of the hundreds of new Johnlock fics, I truly appreciate it.
“I can't do this,” he groaned eventually. “Text me when you're finished sulking and are willing to talk.” He grabbed his jacket and stomped out of the flat.
Sherlock's scent was lingering in John's nose, and it drove him wild. He wanted Sherlock like never before. His hands slid between their bodies to undo the buttons of the detective's shirt and trousers. It had been a while since John Watson was head over heels in love, but now it happened again, and he just couldn't be patient enough to get what he wanted. Frustrated by the resistance of the bloody buttons of Sherlock's clothes, he decided to go for method B. With a swift move he ripped the stubborn shirt open, the fabric tearing with a screeching sound.
“How could I have forgotten that?” John laughed. The fairy lights sparkling in the window behind him painted his silver-blond strands in a golden glow. “The most awkward time I have spent in a restaurant.”
For a long while, John had thought that his growing affection toward Sherlock stemmed from this sincere gratitude and admiration, and it was nothing more than deep friendship forged between two men who had gone through both hardship and excitement. Yet, he had slowly begun to realise that there were more to it.
Without moving or turning his head, John suddenly spoke up in an inanimate, flat and cold voice.“If you came to retrieve your laptop, it's under the bed. And in case you wonder, I didn't delete the file, let alone opened it.”
“I bloody don't care,” the doctor huffed and climbed the stairs to his room. “And just so you know: no more sex until the flat is bug and cam-free.”
John wished he could have remembered exactly what had transpired between them. Sherlock-married-to-my-work-Holmes having initiated their tryst seemed so unreal and unexpected.
“No, Sherlock, don't look at me as if you didn't know what I'm talking about. My laptop, my phone, my e-mails...Does it ring a bell? But I'm not complaining anymore, I have given up on that long ago. You've taken over my life, and, strangely, I don't mind it. But this...this is too much. Mycroft's little spy-game has crossed the line.”
For a while, all that could be heard in the room was the loud gasps of the two men. When their breaths finally calmed a bit, John snuggled closer to his lover.
“It's definitely worth a 'take two',” Sherlock drawled, snuggling up to John's chest and wrapping his long arm around the man's waist. “John?”
. Best friends even, he reckoned, though he couldn’t tell which category Sherlock sorted their friendship into in his mind palace.
“I swear,” John reiterated firmly, his eyes asking Sherlock to believe him, and in the next moment, Sherlock was only aware of soft lips gently pressing against his.
John’s thumb squeezed Sherlock’s fingers. The fact that there had hardly been anyone caring about this brilliant man saddened and angered John. What was wrong with people? How could they not see what a precious person Sherlock Holmes was under the facade? If someone took the effort to see beyond the rudeness and arrogance, they would find that the detective was just like any other person, hungry for love and care.
“Hey,” John greeted his flatmate, maneuvering into the room, balancing the loaded Tesco bags in his arms.
“Harder,” John begged, tugging at Sherlock's dark curls and coaxing a wanton groan from the detective. Sherlock's follicles being particularly sensitive, the pull on his hair ignited his own arousal, making his cock twitch.
“I’ll be back in a minute.” He rose, letting go of the detective’s hand. “Fetching you some clothes.”
John groaned at the sudden stop, not liking the cool room-temperature replacing the hot, wet mouth of his lover.
"Say 'John, I appreciate your interest, but I'm married to my work', or 'Thank you, John, but you're not my type'. Anything?"
Hardly had they entered the flat, before their mouths crashed against each other in a desperate kiss.
He slid his fingers into short blond strands and pulled John up into a needy, sloppy kiss. Tasting himself on John's tongue was an unusual, yet powerful experience. In possession of data on both sides now, he could distinguish the differences in the taste of their semen, concluding that his own was a bit bitter and more salty than John's. Still, apparently, John didn't find the flavour overly revolting and swallowed the whole load.
“I've never cared for human body beyond being the object of crime scenes; it's just transport of the mind,” Sherlock muttered against his blogger's chest. “I've considered all the extra attention as waste of time and energy. But since we're...,” he looked up at John, looking for the proper word, “involved with each other in this new way, I'm willing to approach the matter from another point of view. Because I want you to be happy. I want to give you everything you used to get from your girlfriends...”
John stretched his numb limbs, a smile lingering in the corner of his mouth, seeing that Sherlock still managed to joke amidst the pain. “How are you feeling?”
Stumbling through the small hallway, Sherlock opened the door of his room and propelled them into the darkness of his lair. How many times did he imagine this scenario in the past months, he sighed. Finally, the wait was over. Relying on his memory of the room's layout, he guided John to his bed in the dark and, shoving him onto the mattress, planted small kisses on the bare chest. The pale street light filtering through the window cast a silver shine on their bodies, enough to make out each other's silhouette.
The moment of silence felt like forever, and Sherlock’s insides trembled at the prospect that he had messed up everything and that this was the end of the story of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
Entering the flat, he found Sherlock sitting at the desk, engrossed in intently watching something on his laptop.
"I don't think I have to find another gift to you after all," Sherlock smirked when pulling back, flushed and eyes bright.
“I like you touching me,” Sherlock purred, melting into the tender touch. His eyelids fluttered shut, relishing the lovely warmth and softness of John's hand.
Taking a step toward him, John's other hand cupped Sherlock's face, his eyes never leaving the detective's blue pools. Standing on his tiptoes, John pulled his friend close, his lips touching Sherlock's, slowly and gently.
already Sherlock and the word sex in the same sentence was more than ridiculous)? John ran a hand through his wet hair in utter frustration, staring at the different shades of green tiles as if expecting them to answer his questions.
John sighed at the sterile tone, “Yes. We both were very drunk, I can't even remember everything. Are you one hundred percent sure?”
John smiled at the adorable reaction and kept petting the silky hair languidly. Sherlock purred again once in a while, until the sound was replaced by soft snores. John’s mouth curled into an affectionate smile. Sherlock was like an innocent child when he sleeping. Especially when being sick. There was no trace of the cocky man; he was just like any other human being, vulnerable and in need of protection.
“I wasn't sure whether you'd have approved. If you had refused the idea, I couldn't have managed to have this recording. You'd have been cautious every time we had sex, and that'd have ruined everything.”
Inhaling deeply, Sherlock braced himself and jumped. “I...I love you,” he whispered. There, he’d said it. His life was in John’s hands now.
Sherlock had never been more sure about anything. “There's nothing I want more.” His eyes locked with John’s.
Gazing at their joint fingers, Sherlock uttered with a shy smile. "I like your touch. It's so comforting."
Sherlock's calm attitude and silence seemed to anger John even more. “Fuck you, Sherlock, you don't even have anything to say?! You bloody machine, you–”
“Thank you,” was all he could utter, but he hoped his eyes conveyed all the gratitude and love he felt but couldn't put into words.
John wiped away a teardrop that rolled down Sherlock's cheek, and Sherlock bit his trembling lip at the tender gesture, struggling to keep his tears at bay.
Checking back on them, Angelo's mouth curled into a broad smile, spotting their joint hands on the table. “Can I bring you anything while your meals are being prepared?”
“Nooo!” He roared, his hands cradling his head, shutting his eyes tight. “What is happening to me?” He whimpered wearily.
“Sherlock,” John whispered against the heated forehead, nudging him gently. “Wake up, we must get out of here.”
Sherlock’s focus snapped back to the room, and he sighed heavily. “John, I…” He tried to speak, but couldn’t get the words out.
, the answer hit him, clear as day. John was the reason for all the strange sensations affecting his transport, infecting his mind and soul, awakening his dormant heart.
“What, Sherlock?” John pressed, his dark blue eyes burning Sherlock’s skin as if he would die if he didn’t hear what Sherlock had to say.
So, while Sherlock didn’t know what exactly it was that he felt for John, he knew it was a ‘first day’ thing, if anything like that existed at all.
the Work are what matter to me, what I would do anything for. You complete me, you are my conductor of light, my partner-in-crime, my friend, and I don't want to be without you. Apparently, a romantic relationship is the deepest connection between two individuals, body and mind.” Sherlock’s mouth curved into a smile of awe. “I have never even considered starting one with anyone before, but now, I want to have that with you.”
“I always cared for you, you were always important to me. But now... it's different. I have never felt like this. I didn't know what being in love was like. Until now...”
“I should get dressed,” he added after a moment of silence, but didn't move. It was apparent that there still was something on his mind.
John Watson had never recorded his sexual adventures with anyone before. Not that he would have been bothered about seeing himself during the act. He was pretty sure about being a great lover; all the feedbacks and past experiences referred to that. He wasn't shy about his body either; due to the strict, though military training he was still muscular and fit, so there was nothing he should have been ashamed of. The only region of his otherwise perfectly body was his left shoulder where that bloody bullet had hit him, turning his world up-side-down. The wound healed, but the scar, both on his skin and heart, remained a memorial of a moment that John Watson would rather have liked to forget. The ugly, pink scar was an all time reminder of horror. It was his own, unique tattoo, memento of the darkest side of human nature, the cruelty that human race was capable of. The wound reminded him of what he despised and fought against. He remembered the death of innocents and his own survival. He was alive, which he interpreted as a message that he was to accomplish yet one more mission in this world. Now his uniform and battle-gear was replaced by the mind and leg-work and the single gun he owned, while the battlefield of Afghanistan transformed into the streets of London. On Sherlock's side he fought criminals, not less dangerous enemies than those human monsters in the desert of hell.
Breaking away from John’s lips, his mouth moved over to his neck and breathed a kiss onto the inviting, creamy skin. Licking and nuzzling the soft flesh, Sherlock saved the tiniest pieces of information he observed in his mind palace. Kissing John’s skin was nothing like kissing his lips—not better or worse, it was intriguing and exciting, but in a different way. Sherlock couldn’t choose, he loved both.
John races with time to free Sherlock, but he too has to save himself along the way. One thing is for sure: he has never experienced so much terror before...
The more time had passed and adventures they had gone through, the more John had felt his affection and attraction deepening toward his friend. He had started longing for physical closeness—more than just fleeting touches or sitting close, but not close enough, to each other. Often when their hands accidentally brushed, John wished to pull Sherlock’s hand back and envelope it into his own, relishing the comforting warmth. Sitting at his laptop with Sherlock leaning over his shoulder to peer at the screen, his warm breath tickling John’s neck, John wanted to grab the long arms and wrap himself in them while Sherlock’s chin would have rested on the top of his head. Whenever they were lounging on the sofa, watching telly, John wanted to close the gap and snuggle against his friend, leaning his head back at Sherlock’s shoulder. Sometimes, after a successfully solved case, high on adrenaline, he felt inclined to press a celebratory kiss onto Sherlock’s pale cheek, showing his pride and admiration in a way that words could not express.
Sherlock became his home, providing the familiar comfort, stability, safety and—despite his arrogant, many times arsehole-like behaviour—care.
“Sleep, dear,” he whispered softly, tentatively caressing Sherlock's unruly curls. It was the first time he let himself indulge in such an intimate action with the detective. A little thing, almost nothing, but still John felt like he’d won the grand prize.
About an hour later, wrapped in his dressing gown and tucked under the comfortable duvet in the large, double, walnut canopy bed, Sherlock rested his head on the fluffy pillow and stared at the ceiling.
“You're the expert at sentiment and such,” Sherlock waved a hand. “I’ll leave it up to you. I don't bother about such mundane issues. It's just stating the obvious, after all.”
"Your heart beats faster than normal, which indicates excitement. No case to work on, no thrilling news, so the reason is something else. What could cause such a reaction right now? Obvious." Sherlock grinned. "If you refused the idea of sleeping with me, you'd react completely different. Have seen that before. You haven't snapped with the usual 'I'm not gay' exclamation, which suggests that you're not quite against the idea." His hand started rubbing slow circles on the doctor's chest, and John had to bite his lip to stifle a slight moan.
Sherlock and John start the investigation in Epping, but immediately face some complication that leads to the two spending the night in the forest nearby...
Both Sherlock and John might sound a bit OOC, but remember, this is just one of the many interpretations of their story; this work focuses on the soulsearching, inside battles, and intends to capture the emotions in depth and show that everyone has issues, everyone is human and there are thousands of reasons that influence our actions. Nothing is black or white.
“Sherlock...” he finally overcame the breathlessness, and seeing his lover's intentions, he was about to protest and point out that it was his turn to please, but the detective cut in.
Sherlock might be right, still John wondered and, after the night before, was inclined to go for the first option, though with Sherlock, one could never know. The man was a real mystery, the eighth wonder of the world.
John let the water hit his face, his hands supporting him against the cool tiles of the bathroom wall.
“Sherlock! “ John cried out in horror. Lestrade's sex life was the last he was interested in. Well, after Anderson.
Though letting himself be exposed to the despised feelings was frightening, the experience of having John closer than ever was intriguing, something that Sherlock was eager to revisit.
“Okay. In this case, drink is a metaphor for something else...” John looked at Sherlock expectantly, waiting for the penny to drop. But, apparently, it didn't. “If two people had a great time, at the end of their date, they might want to... take things further... physically,” he wiggled an eyebrow suggestively.
This chapter is free of angst - finally? :D -, so just sit back and enjoy the Johnlock holiday edition!
“But...You’re not interested in this sort of thing and… you didn’t want to talk about it earlier…I thought...”
observe? Sentiment and sex are not my area, so talking about them—especially if the situation is unclear—is a bit difficult for me.” He bowed his head and added timidly, “You were so distant all morning that I thought you didn't approve of what happened; you keep saying you’re not gay, after all. I wasn't ready to face your pity and rejection.” Glancing at John again, Sherlock could see the flush of shame creeping into his cheeks.
Music helped Sherlock to compose himself and face the inevitable that was coming, so he was shifted back into his usual aloof self by the time John returned a few hours later. He was immediately aware of his friend's presence, of the familiar sound of the doctor's feet pounding on the stairs, and from the man's heavy, fast breathing, he could instantly tell that John was furious. Sherlock stopped playing, but didn't turn around.
Again thanks to my betas, Lucie, Mimi and Donna, but especially nutmeag83 for her suggestions and support. If there's any mistakes left, it's my bad, apologies.
“Are you aware of how often the rhythm of your breathing changes during the act depending on the intensity of pleasure?” Sherlock murmured huskily, licking the hot skin.”Do you know how you curl your toes when getting closer to the edge?” His tongue flicked around John's nipple, making the body  underneath him shudder in pleasure. “Attentive enough, one can use this knowledge to read their partner's needs, tell how long till the climax and which zones of the body needs more attention to reach the orgasm.“
“Do you know you used the word fucking three times in one sentence? “ Sherlock raised a brow nonchalantly.
John sighed loudly. “Right,” his gaze dropped onto the carpet. “This is not easy for me. I…” he took a deep breath, gathering courage. “I’m not gay—” Rolling his eyes, Sherlock opened his mouth to interject—probably that everyone heard that statement thousand times already—but John held up a hand with a stern look. “Please, let me finish.” Sherlock pouted, but pursed his lips obediently. “So, I’m not gay, that’s what I keep saying, but maybe things aren’t all black and white,” John said thoughtfully.
A small smile crept into the corner of John's mouth. This look of the young  Holmes was irresistible, one could simply not hold a grudge when facing those begging, baby-blue eyes and cute, pout lips. He was sure that Sherlock was aware of this feature and took advantage of it.
John had never felt that alive. When Sherlock filled him, shaking wildly, John found release along with him, in perfect sync, shivering in pleasure. His whole body was overloaded with sensations; he couldn't tell where he began and ended.
John inhaled sharply. The urge to kiss Sherlock right there, right then was maddening, sod being in public. Tilting his head for the right angle, straining his neck, he inched forward until his mouth found Sherlock's lips in a soft kiss.
He hated not knowing things. He wanted to know John's views on the subject, yet he was afraid to hear John telling him once more that he wasn't gay and that last night was just a stupid mistake caused by inebriation, nothing more. Once the words were out, they became real and not amendable. A stab into his heart.
! To draw attention to himself, he started waving at the car animatedly. Noticing him, the driver slowed down and skidded to a halt.
Any other time, Sherlock might have retorted with some arrogant remark, but now his mind was occupied with pondering the result of the equation of their night plus John’s intention to stay plus his newfound approach on emotions and where that could lead to.
“Uhm, Sherl-,” being about to bring the fact of watching sex videos in the living room during daytime was not good to Sherlock's attention, John's glance unintentionally flicked at the screen one more time. His eyes immediately grew wide and he almost choked. What he saw was something he hadn't expected the least. The two men in the video were him and Sherlock.
“Nothing. It's just strange,” the old man rubbed his beard. “She never has guests. I don't remember her inviting anyone to the mansion ever since Lord Beresford died. Three years, that is.”
“A man committing multiple crimes—nice prospect. The list is getting longer and longer.” John laughed. “Duvet theft, personal space violation and bigamy. What else is there?”
Moaning at the sensation, John's fingers dived into the mop of Sherlock's dark curls, enjoying the feel of the cool, silky hair on his heated skin.
“Why?” Sherlock averted his penetrative gaze at John. “Even you should have noticed that—unlike you—I’m unequivocally, one hundred percent gay. And even if I wasn’t, she's not…”
Looking into the mirror, the same weary, distressed face stared back that he had seen so many times after his nightmares. Inhaling deeply, he ran a hand through his hair exasperatedly, fighting the urge to tear the strands in despair.
“I see,” John acknowledged with a resignated sigh, dropping the wet towel on the back of the armchair. Sherlock had apparently withdrawn into his shell, refusing any kind of communication. John knew very well that it wasn’t worth trying to push for more, so he grabbed the morning paper and settled onto the sofa, trying to distract himself from the nagging questions.
John sighed. “Argh, I don't know which freaks me out more - the mere thought of the possible scenario, or knowing the fact that you mean what you're saying.” He narrowed his eyes. “Does the thought of anyone walking in on us while doing it not alarm you the slightest?”
As the matter of fact, the issue had already crossed his mind - rather as wishful thinking, but he had never dared to dwell on it. He had never thought that Sherlock would ever even only think about the matter at hand. So John was more than astonished when the detective popped out the question. Would you have sex with me? Only six words, but together, from Sherlock 's tongue, they formed a shocking, life-changing sentence, which John didn't know the right answer to.
Pausing the clip, Sherlock sent the media player's window to the tray and launched the internet browser.
“You mean the sexual interaction?” Sherlock asked perplexedly. “We've already discussed that, remember? You said that you wouldn't mind getting physical with me. Have you changed your mind?” His eyes narrowed.
“But I can't–” Sherlock started, his voice faltering as he realised how close he’d come to uttering his deepest fear.
Sherlock's heart fluttered at the confession, and he never felt more loved and at home like in that very moment. Deepening the kiss, he explored John's mouth passionately, his hand rubbing the nape of the doctor's neck.
A quiet whimper caught his ear, and his movements ceased abruptly. Had he hurt John? Was the scar still that painful that even the light pressure of his lips caused distress? He jerked his head up, seeing tears in the corner of John’s eyes
Sherlock turned around slowly, without saying a word. Facing his flatmate, he regarded him with a blank face, studying every tiny part of the man's expression, trying to deduce an explanation for his sudden rage.
Sherlock's expression froze in horror. Now John's fury made sense. He stared ahead, processing the situation, blinking heavily as he sought the words to explain, to assure John that he was wrong.
His thoughts briefly wandered to his issues with the meddling ghost of his father, before going back to James again.
John hated leaving the sick, injured and freezing man there in the cold, wet forest all alone, but there was nothing else that he do. He just hoped and prayed that his phone would get some tiny little signal soon so he could call for help.
He trembled heavily as his climax neared, and—however, he had deleted the information of the solar system—he swore that he could see all the stars, when John pushed him over the edge.
His hand sneaked to John's backside and cupped the firm arse. John groaned and broke away abruptly. Sherlock froze in motion and blinked in confusion, fear flashing through him. “Have I done something not good?”
The detective looked into his eyes, intently, not saying a word. John was about to demand an explanation, but when their gazes met, the words died on his tongue. What he saw in the blue pools was nothing he expected. Instead of the clinical, sterile, experiment-focused look of the genius, a pair of scared, yet hopeful eyes stared back at him, warmth and innocence showing in them.
“That's the goal, my dear Watson,” Sherlock smirked, and gave another long squeeze to the throbbing cock of his flatmate. ”Come for me,” he whispered, before capturing John's mouth passionately, sucking the remaining air out of his lungs.
John stared at him wide eyed, apparently finding it hard to believe he was hearing these words from him. Sherlock didn’t blame him, it was unbelievable even to himself.
Thank you as always goes for my betas, Donna and nutmeag83! Any mistakes left, that's my fault, apologies.
John's breath was caught in his throat for a moment. Sherlock practically admitted that he had some feelings for him, however he might not have been aware of it.
There's no cargo-handling at Nine Elms Pier anymore, but I needed the exact place for the fic, so allow me this artistic licence. :)
No matter how awkward this could be, they needed to talk. They couldn’t live with each other under the same roof without clearing the situation. John needed to know Sherlock’s motivation and how would that affect their future. He just hoped that such a crazy interlude wouldn’t put a wedge in their friendship. Sherlock was important to him, he didn’t want to lose him for a silly, drunken mistake.
“Why did you seduce me last night?” John asked firmly, not beating around the bush. Though he was afraid of the answer, he couldn’t procrastinate asking the question.
John inhaled deeply, nervously licking his lips. His heart was beating wildly in his chest. “I think… I think I have feelings for you.”
Smirking, Sherlock leaned down and parted John's lips with his tongue as he kissed him deeply, exploring every inch of the cavern of John’s mouth. The sensation was intoxicating. He needed more. Did kissing skin feel different than the lips? Was its texture and taste more distinct? More exhilarating? He needed to experiment.
Suddenly, Sherlock felt something he had rarely experienced—his hard drive switched off, the constant need of his brain to be fed with information ceased. His entire mind instead focused on John and the activity they were engaged in. All reason and logic went out the window, and all that mattered was the way John felt under his touch, against his lips, how his presence engulfed him, made him feel appreciated, wanted, loved.
The intense, encouraging, warm gaze reaching his core, Sherlock could only nod, though his heart was bleeding.
Right, rating turns higher for erotic content and sex-related discussion, so be warned (and enjoy)! ;)
Returning to the room, he stopped beside the bed, standing on the side where he had had recently lain. He made a sudden decision and slipped under the duvet instead of lying on the top.
God, having such a conversation with Sherlock wasn’t easy. It felt like talking to an eight-year-old child. You could never know how to say things so that he’d understand.
The image of Sherlock watching him wake this morning popped into his mind, and John couldn't help cracking a tiny, affectionate smile.
“They do little else.” John tightened his hold around the leather-gloved hand. “Besides, we’re officially a couple now, aren’t we?”
Sherlock gave him an offended glance. This was really not what he wanted to hear when asking. John being a romantic, Sherlock expected some sentimental nonsense about what a milestone that evening had been for them.
“Occasionally. But he always has to face that there's no point in that. Lady Isabelle is a strong woman.”
it was so strange to hear it. Sherlock had been apprehensive that once the title became real, it would have felt suffocating and pressuring, but all he felt was contentment and happiness.
Sherlock flinched at the words, and his eyes squeezed shut in exasperation. “Don't…” he whispered, begging for dear life. Please, don’t. Don’t leave me. Not you. Not now.
“No, Sherlock. If it's a relationship you want, not just occasional sex, we're taking it slow. Baby steps.” John needed Sherlock understand that they were about to enter a serious field, and it wasn’t a game. Sherlock raised his brow perplexedly. “Nothing physical for a while. This whole thing is so sudden; I need time to come to terms with whatever is going on between us. We talk, get to know more about each other, go on dates—see if we can make it work. I want both of us to be sure about this thing between us when the time comes to take it to next level.”
The magic lasted only for a few moments, but for Sherlock—having yearned this contact for so long—it felt more like hours. But Sherlock knew it was a bit not good to kiss someone without their permission, so he ended the contact with a sigh. John's REM phase apparently ending, he entered another cycle of sleep, snoring quietly. Licking his lips to savour the memory, Sherlock stared at the sleeping form of his boyfriend, storing every little millisecond of the accidental kiss in his mind palace. Sickness and tiredness soon overwhelmed him, and his eyelids dropped happily as sleep took him over.
Dashing along the path in the direction of the Beresford mansion, dry twigs and leaves crunched under his feet and raindrops fell onto his hair and face from the branches above. Running as fast as he could, his ragged breath was visible in the chilly air. He felt like he was back in an early morning jogging session ordered by an insufferable commander in the army. Had the situation been different, John might have enjoyed this exercise—given that their trainings during his military days had always taken place on the base, never in the countryside. John always liked the excitement and challenge the field provided, thus he had been thrilled to participate in the missions on the frontline.
A quiet moan escaped Sherlock's lips when John's hands suddenly slid under his silk shirt. He instinctively arched into the warm touch. John's chest pressing against his, he felt the doctor's heart beating fast. If that hadn't been a telltale sign of John's desire, the prominent bulge poking against Sherlock's thigh gave everything away. Sherlock smirked and ground a leg against John's erection. John gasped loudly and, whimpering in need, moved his trembling fingers to his groin, fumbling with the button and zip impatiently. Noticing the clumsy moves, Sherlock covered John's hand with his, helping him with the stubborn zip, then hooking his fingers into the waistband of the trousers and pants, rolled them down in a swift move. John groaned in relief, his chest heaving in anticipation. Sherlock's fierce look fell on John's now free erection. Sherlock himself couldn't complain about his own measurements, but apparently, John was even more endowed by nature. Beautiful.
“Damn you, you sodding git,” switching on the bedside lamp, John  inhaled loudly, annoyance mixed with frustration and helplessness, yet heavily tainted with the voice of love and forgiveness.
“You're so beautiful,” John's warm breath tickled his abdomen, before the soft lips nuzzled the dark mess of Sherlock's pubic hair.
John gently caressed the detective’s cold cheek. “My pleasure. So, does the Christmas experiment end with success?”
“The body is alike to a landscape with its hollows, plains, hills, hidden caves and underground streams. Recently, I've realized that exploring it is one of the greatest adventures.” Sherlock nuzzled his nose into the crook of the neck of his lover. “You smell so good,” he hummed. The rainforest-scented shampoo was still lingering on John's hair, indicating that he had showered a few hours ago. “You're a real landscape,” Sherlock uttered, glancing up at John in awe.”Your skin is the creamy, fine soil,” his fingers caressed John's cheek, before sliding up into the sandy strands. “Your hair is the golden, autumn forest, the abs, biceps and curvy arse are the tantalizing hills emerging from the ground. The turquoise lines roaming under the velvet of your skin,” he softly traced the veins with his index finger, his mouth leaving tiny kisses in its wake, “are the wildest rivers and tranquil streams of the existence.”
John groaned and massaged his temple, trying to alleviate the terrible headache. He had been drunk many times in his life, but last night took the cake. He had never been so wasted to have no recollection of what happened during his pissed state. Well, there’s always a first. Honestly, he was rather glad he didn’t remember much; it was less embarrassing this way.
“Those people around you must have been blind. You’re gorgeous—and this is a man saying so, who had considered himself straight all his life! Mind you, Sherlock, you make me question my sexual orientation!”
“You are my partner, John. In every way.” He brushed his lips against the other man's, kissing him softly. “You are all I need. You complete me, without you I can't function. You tolerate my flaws, accept me as I am, and believe in me like no one else. As long as you're with me I manage everything. But without you I fall apart.”
With Barnaby's help, they got the injured detective back to where they’d left the Land Rover. John sat Sherlock in the vehicle's back seat, scooting beside the barely conscious man. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock, John kept rubbing the man’s shaking arms and chest all the way back to the house, trying to channel a bit of warmth into the cold body.
His limbs trembled, anger buzzing in the nerve endings, and he just couldn't sit still. Jumping up, he started pacing around the room, high on self-reproach. His mind raced, images of the night before and this morning flashing with high speed, evoking contradictory feelings in a fraction of a second, making him dizzy. His head felt like it would explode under the contrast of anger and affection, the different emotions overwhelming his body with so much force that he thought that his veins would rip apart under his skin.
John’s world was suddenly a cavalcade of insecurities, doubts and confusion. He didn’t know what to say, he feared hurting Sherlock with some inappropriately chosen words.
John took a loving look at his peacefully sleeping boyfriend, drinking in the sight. He wished to run his fingertip along the masterfully sculpted face, the sharp cheekbones and elegant jaw, tracing the line of the soft, dark eyebrows, delicate nose and that perfect Cupid’s bow. John licked his lips and swallowed hard, fighting the urge to capture those lips in a kiss.
“No, you won't. And you know why? Because it's not just sex that I want from you. I want you to be my partner, someone I can talk to, laugh and cry with, someone I can come home to.”
The memory recollection technique that Sherlock uses in this fic is not real, it's a fiction of my mind.
“Whatever, forget it,” John sighed resignedly, before rephrasing his thoughts.  “You get off on the visual image.”
I know it's weird to read Christmas stuff in summer, but well, the fic reached this point in the story, so... if you are not keen on reading a holiday fic in August, put this fic on hold and come back in November! :D
Thank you for the kudos, hits and comments, as always. Thanks to all of you who are still sticking around and staying on board of this story of emotional rollercoaster.
Before settling down to sleep, he touched Sherlock’s forehead lightly, cautiously checking the man’s temperature.
Sherlock having literally taken his breath away, John thought he would lose his senses when the detective released his numb lips.
John saw the disappointment and sadness in his friend's eyes, the feeling of uselessness was mirrored in the blue pools. Of course, Sherlock couldn't see that why his offer earned indignation, his brilliant mind wasn't working like any other people's.
Sherlock looked up, his expression ever so innocent and young. “Because I think I also have feelings for you.”
Sherlock froze, processing the words that sounded like poetry. Having read John's dull, simple-worded emails to his girlfriends, he had never expected him reaching such literary heights. Again, John Watson was full of surprises. The loving look in the indigo eyes made his heart skip a beat. No one had ever looked at him with such affection. This was new.
John couldn’t say no to that pleading, innocent look. Also, he wasn’t supposed to refuse a sick man’s need of company. He was a doctor after all.
Sherlock's mouth curled into a happy smile. “We are.” He returned the caress. John’s heart filled with heavenly warmth at the two little words and the tiny gesture.
Hardly did John leave the room, Sherlock yanked out his mobile. 'Dear brother, I'd leave for an urgent business overseas if I were you. Avoid Baker St 221B for a while at least. Or expect a missile called John Watson. - SH'
was the reason for John's arousal. Sherlock Holmes, the freak, who was locked up in his mind palace and committed to loneliness in order to protect himself from the cruel world. He had always considered himself a broken, worthless man, whose only treasure was his mind, and whom everyone looked at with pity, contempt and many times fear.
,’ he remembered Mycroft's warning. He knew that very well. Still, in one weak moment, he’d let himself be swept away by his despised humanity.
Sherlock cleaned the room of the unwanted spies in no time. When finished, he dropped down onto the sofa and kept replaying the earlier outburst of John in the private home cinema of his mind palace, analizing his blogger's behaviour. Some things he considered to be evident,  John approached differently. Being a genius and sociopath, Sherlock ignored the elusive web of emotions that instinctively and involuntarily clouded the thinking of normal people when it came to reactions to matters of life. He didn't understand why people had to complicate their issues to be solved by adding another problematic layer. Approaching things with emotions produced two problems the same time - the original issue itself plus the emotional side. If they helped to resolve the fundamental question, Sherlock could  understand the need of going that way, but emotions always seemed to lead to the contrary, making the solution of the initial issue much more difficult. Had it been anyone else applying this method though, Sherlock'd have mocked them all the time, pointing out their failure. Yet, it wasn't anyone else, but John Watson. He was an exception. Maybe the one and only. Not only due to the fact that they had passed the point of being friends, flatmates and colleagues only - which intrigued Sherlock like nothing else -, but also for John was smarter than the majority of ordinary people.
“Shhh, John,” the detective whispered huskily, placing a finger on the doctor's swollen lips. “Let me finish. I wanted to see all that in order to store every little movement, gasp, moan in my mind palace for further use.” His baritone caressed John's ears, making every cell of his body tingle. “I wanted to see how you respond when I touch you,” his fingers lightly squeezed the doctor's neck, so briefly that John almost whimpered by the sudden lack of touch; “kiss you,” he breathed a little kiss onto the palm of the ex-soldier; “fill you, so that I know how to elicit that reaction from you again.”
The hot, thick cock in the cavern of Sherlock's mouth felt alien, but not entirely repulsive. The fact that it was John, the most important person in his life, reassured him that he could go on.
, the simple, scientific answer flashed through Sherlock's mind. Usually, he was prone to enter into a lengthy explanation on the matter at hand, but, shockingly, that was the last thing he was inclined to do at this very moment. All he could focus on was the sensation that elicited the high amount of serotonin, endorphin and dopamine flooding his system.
John could barely wait to get back to Sherlock; he was anxious of the condition he might find the detective in. He hadn’t been away for long, but Sherlock’s state had already been alarming when John had left him.
“For you, it might be boring, but it's true. I'd appreciate if you and the world would finally stop trying to convince me otherwise.”
Picking up his violin eventually, he played some loud, vehement, stray notes, before the sound gradually calmed into an an improvised, sad, slow melody.
“God, Sherlock,” he was panting hoarsely, “if you keep it up like this, I'm not going to last long...”
The rush gone, their heated kisses turned slow and indulging. Their bodies like a comfortable blanket covered each other, fingers gently caressing each other's sweaty, hot skin.
. Strange, unknown, unexplained feelings, doing odd things to his body, prompting new chemical reactions in his system.
Fun fact: inspired by this scene, I actually ran a poll on twitter for the 'satin or lace' question last year, and the user 'contactsh' (roleplay account of Sherlock) just confirmed what I had had in mind when writing this bit long months ago. :)
Now, this chapter is an important one in this fic, a milestone. With the amount of angst and turmoil of raw, deep emotions, writing this part wasn't easy, so I'm quite proud of how it turned out - hope you'll like it too.
They shed their coats and shoes in a frantic rush, not caring where the clothing landed. Sherlock peeled the oatmeal jumper—the one he loved the most from John's knitwear—off John in a frenzy, desperate to get his boyfriend naked as soon as possible.
The muscles of John's cock contracted under Sherlock's tongue, before the hot semen filled his mouth. John cried out, throwing his head back in pleasure. Having read about the appreciation for swallowing the partner's ejaculation fluid, Sherlock didn't release John's jerking cock, but deftly latched his mouth around him. He was revolted by the mere idea of someone ejaculating into his mouth, but for John, he was ready to overcome his aversion. He wanted to have John Watson in every possible way, wanted to consume him to the very last cell, until their flesh, blood and minds merged into one. The discovery shocked him; he never thought that one day he was going to let anyone that close, wanting to have them in such a raw way.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “Of course, I am, don't be ridiculous. Two people engaging in lip-locking is a regular act of endearment and expressing affection in a relationship. It boosts levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin, causes the adrenal glands to secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood, thereby causing an adrenaline rush. A kiss also burns two to six calories per minute, depending on the intensity of the act–”
John sighed. “Alright, you couldn't have known. Had you asked me and let me know it was important to you, I'd have let you film it. I haven't done it before though, but on some conditions applied, I'd have approved. And by conditions I mean privacy, only you and me can see it.”
John froze, thinking he misheard the words or simply that his brain was playing tricks on him, and that he had fallen back into the mental exchange with that little voice.
The prospect of a repeat of last night’s experiences was both tempting and frightening. Feeling Sherlock’s closeness and touches again was tempting, but…
The two men stared at each other for a moment in uncomfortable silence, before John let out a relieved sigh. “I'm sorry...” He ran his fingers through his blond hair nervously. “I was confused, and when I suggested we talk about what happened, you refused to do it, so knowing you, the most convenient answer seemed to be the experiment. I shouldn't have said all those horrible things, I'm sorry.”
John deliberately ignored Sherlock’s obviously sexual suggestion of using Lestrade’s handcuffs. Sleeping with Sherlock was still a touchy topic. John still hadn’t been able to talk with the detective about the real issues for holding back on the  sex, and then there were his father’s recurring, haunting, contempt-filled comments, making things even worse. Though, with John’s high sex drive and his deepening feelings and attraction toward Sherlock—the longing to kiss the man senseless, to explore the lean body, to bring them to shattering climax—the wait  was less and less bearable. John wished to have the full experience of being a couple: kissing, touching, cuddling, sharing a bed and having sex. He wanted the intimacy of being in love.
Again thank you for the wonderful response to the latest chapter! I'm a bit behind with replying the comments, but I'll get there! Thank you for reading and sticking around. <3
He sighed silently. Certainly, John knew where to find him; Sherlock couldn’t hide from him. Though, after John having announced his decision that morning, all Sherlock wanted was being alone, thinking.
his heart fluttered. “Real,” he murmured in awe and buried his head into the hollow of John's neck. He breathed little, hot kisses onto the smooth skin, before trailing further down, licking and nibbling experimentally, and savouring the taste of the salty flesh. John tensed as Sherlock's tongue reached the damaged tissue on his left shoulder and, gently, tried to nudge him away from the very spot. But Sherlock only strengthened his hold around the naked torso and breathed feathery kisses on the knotted pinky scar. “My brave Captain Watson,” he whispered admiringly.
Panting hard, John looked down at Sherlock in pure awe and gratitude. “You're....amazing... Christ, You. Are. Bloody. Fantastic,” John claimed Sherlock's mouth in a passionate kiss. “I want you so fucking much.” He grabbed the lapels of the purple shirt. “Bedroom!”
So, Sherlock was not just a simple friend, and not even the term best friend could cover the bond they had. Maybe that was the reason why people often assumed that they were a couple—they saw the signs of their unique connection and mistook them for something more.
, the word still sounded so unreal. Sherlock had never thought that anyone could ever want to have such a commitment with him. But this extraordinary ordinary man in his arms did, and this wasn't just his imagination or a sweet dream, but reality.
“Not now, please,” John's pleaded in shame, grabbing Sherlock's hand. “Please,” the indigo eyes begged him.
“You incredible, silly git,” John's mouth curled into a small, affectionate smile. He reached for the other man's hands and squeezed them tenderly.
John gaped at him with the mixture of anger, fear and gratitude on his face. “Why? Why did you want to know so badly what happened last night?”
“I want to.” Sherlock bit his bottom lip. “I’ve just never done it before,” he admitted shyly, casting his look down, scared to see the shock in John's eyes. According to his subconscious memories, it was John bringing them both to climax solely by using his hand that one night. He had conducted research on sex the past months in order not to disappoint John with his inexperience once they finally got to that point. He’d made himself familiar with oral sex, read about techniques and physical reactions, watched porn videos, so he had the theoretical knowledge of the act, but as for the practical side, he couldn't have brought himself to experiment on himself; it felt far too repulsive. The only person that he could imagine touching him was John, the thought of anyone else, even his own hands, made him feel dirty and prone to throw up in disgust. “I've done some research, but...”
John isn’t entitled to Sherlock’s thoughts. Sherlock has a right to keep his thoughts to himself just as John has a right to keep his unspoken secrets firmly unspoken.
John has been down to the local Tesco after eggs and milk, planning on making some kind of omelette or perhaps scrambled. As he usually sees neither hide nor hair of Sherlock until breakfast has already been made and the world's only consulting detective stumbles out from his bedroom to claim his spot on the couch, John doesn’t think twice about barging unceremoniously into the bathroom after depositing his bags on the kitchen table, completely unprepared for the sight that greets him.
John and Mary are getting married. It’s a marriage. It’s not the end of the world. And even if John should have much less time for him from now on, why should he care? He’s been alone before, he can be alone again. What exactly is John anyway, other than a little follow-along for Sherlock to impress during his deductions? Why should it even matter if he’s there or not? It’s not as though he’s much of a help when it comes to solving a case. He’s never been the most luminous of people.
“I don’t need help," Sherlock finally replies, his voice wavering somewhere in the zone between honestly insecure and falsely self-assured. "I have it under control.”
He tries not to beg. He shouldn’t want Moriarty to stay in the first place. But it’s just so cold. And when Moriarty answers in the affirmative – just a single “Yes”, that’s all he says – Sherlock can’t stop his insides from tangling themselves up in what feels disturbingly like panic.
His voice is as smooth as silk. As always, Sherlock finds himself all but entranced. Somehow, even if he tries not to listen, Jim’s voice has always been able to find its way in. Now Sherlock isn’t even trying to deny it access. He’s listening.
It doesn’t matter. He comes prepared as he promised himself that he would. During his mental preparations for this visit, which took longer than he wants to admit, he promised himself that if he stood here like he does now, with Mary at his side and Sherlock three feet beneath him, and felt as strong a pull (a stronger pull even?) towards Sherlock beneath and behind him than towards Mary beside and in front of him, he would at least do his best and give Mary as much of him as he possibly could. Maybe then, in time, Mary can do for him what Sherlock did. Take away that pain that’s only in his head, yet feels so real that there are days where he could swear that he’s suffering from some as yet unknown disease, the symptoms of which include crippling bouts of depression and nightmares in all-too vivid colour, leaving him heaving and drenched in sweat. Humiliated and far too vulnerable.
“Ah! So Sherly is right after all. A fool, is that really what you think of him? Or can you just not stand to contemplate what he can do?” One of Moriarty’s hands is at the back of Sherlock’s neck, his fingers constantly tangling and detangling in the dark curls. It’s distractingly intimate. Which is probably the intention.
John puts his arms around Sherlock’s too-slender waist and holds on to him as tightly as he can, irrationally afraid that he might somehow slip away if John doesn’t hold on tight enough.
John enters with a huffed “Sherlock” as a greeting, continuing into the kitchen to dispose of the shopping before bothering to remove his shoes and jacket. Sherlock pulls his legs further up towards his chest, arms wrapped tightly around them, and looks expectantly towards the kitchen. He feels the tension drain from his body when John comes back into view.
Mary is asking whether she should wait with dinner. It’s with more than a little surprise that John checks the time and notices that it’s actually half past five already and it’s with more than a little guilt that he realises that he hasn’t actually taken the time to inform her that he plans for this to be an all-night vigil. He quickly types out a reply, explaining the situation and apologising for not letting her know sooner. His finger is hovering over the send button when Sherlock clears his throat, drawing John’s attention. He smiles a bit awkwardly and nods down at the phone in John’s hand.
“A bit not good?” Sherlock asked with an innocent, puppy-eyed look, though it was rather a  statement than a question.
“I’ve always found you attractive, right from the first moment, but…” John rubbed his nape in unease, before letting out a perplexed laugh. “I feel so ridiculous telling my flatmate that he’s sodding gorgeous and I’ve kinda had a crush on him for some time…”
He chewed his lip nervously. “Look, I...don’t think that’s a good idea.” The smile faded off of Sherlock's face. “I'm not sure I could handle a ‘friends with benefits’ situation.”
The detective's hot breath was caressing John's skin, and the doctor felt like his whole body was on fire. Blood was burning the wall of his veins, every little breath was scorching his nose and lungs, and his mouth felt drier than it had ever done in the desert. And when Sherlock's hot mouth suddenly was on his aching, arching member, the sensation was too much to bear.
Another up and down in the rollercoaster ride of their relationship... Is everything allowed in love?
“Hmm, not the answer one normally gets after great sex, but from you, 'satisfactory' should do it,” John grinned happily, his eyes drooping shut.
"Sherlock.." John took a deep breath and placed his hand on the top of his friend's. "I truly appreciate what you do, but... I don't want you as a substitute..."
Sherlock gazed at him, wordlessly swallowing the hot tears. He couldn’t convince John to stay, that was clear as day. The physical hurt of helplessness was agonising, but there was nothing he could do. Nothing but wait for the day when John would return to him.
They were just friends, however, the doctor had found his feelings toward his flatmate involuntarily changing recently. Yet, he couldn't pinpoint what to do with the nagging, overwhelming, definitely romantically and sexually driven emotions. He had kept telling himself that it was due to the lack of dates and his hormones were playing with him, but deep in his guts a little voice said that Sherlock had grown upon him and, for some mysterious reason, he, John Watson, ex-army doctor was falling for the eccentric, emotionless young man. He couldn't control the newly awakening feelings. So when Sherlock came up with the question from out of blue, John was more than surprised and utterly embarrassed, yet secretly pleased and excited. He wasn't ready to talk about his feelings yet though, he had to come to terms with them in first place. Anyway, what he needed now was Sherlock to explain the origin of the sudden question.
His hand brushed against John's erect penis, making the doctor moan. Sherlock smirked. “And your dick is the great wonder of nature. The biggest adventure.”
“Appealing?” he echoed unbelievingly. “Sherlock, you’re beautiful! How can you not see what everyone else can?”
“I need you!” Sherlock whirled around, his eyes flashing wildly. How could John not see that? Why did it not matter to him?
Sherlock hoped that favouring his mouth to the lubricant didn't fall into the category of 'bit not good'.
The ex-soldier's heart skipped a beat. This was the first time Sherlock said those three little words. With a happy smile on his face, he cupped the detective's cheek with both hands and pulled him into a passionate kiss. Their mouths melted into each other.
way,” Sherlock said quietly, looking meaningfully at John. Actually, it wasn't quite right, given the sex they had that one time months ago, but—due to the lack of its memory—it kind of didn't count.
“It doesn't matter. I'm not a bloody porcelain doll that breaks easily,” Sherlock huffed. “You didn't hurt me, if that's what you're worried about,” he added.
Sherlock sighed. John’s soft pleading broke his resistance. There was no way back, he had to do the hardest thing in his life—baring his heart. He had to take the leap now that he stepped onto the ledge, the only question was whether he would survive the fall.
“Not again,” John groaned. “What dark secret do you still keep and think this is the right time to share?”
“Unless you have some case to work on,” John shifted nervously, “what about going out somewhere? Our first date?” He blushed a little at the last bit.
“Want to know what I have learnt from the video?” Uttering huskily, Sherlock lips brushed John's earlobe.
Sherlock never got tired of hearing his blogger complimenting him. “That's your effect, you make me,” he smiled.
Sherlock's breath was caught for a moment by the unexpected move, before he instinctively thrust against the doctor's hand.
“I’m not sure who I am anymore,” John confessed bashfully, casting his eyes down. “I’m not gay, but—with these feelings about you—I’m not sure I could call myself straight either.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I could say bisexual, but, damn, I don’t find other men attractive, don’t have the urge to date someone of my own gender. It’s just you!” he burst out exasperatedly. “I’m pathetic,” he chuckled bitterly.
Sherlock had said so himself. Also, he had admitted having been engrossed in something less mundane than his hangover.
"When I said I didn't want you to do that I meant I didn't want you as an object, as some service. I don't want you to be a one-night stand." His eyes locking Sherlock's, John took a deep breath. "What you deduced is true, I'm not against the idea of being with you. Not the slightest," he whispered. "Because I have feelings for you."
Sherlock let out a low groan as the warmth enveloped his cold-conquered, still hot body, closing his eyes and letting his head lean back against the enamel surface. The chattering of his teeth subsided slowly, and his cheeks acquired a healthier colour. With his swollen, discoloured foot resting on the edge of the tub, Sherlock gritted his teeth in obvious pain.
“This is unnecessary,” he growled tiredly, rolling his glassy eyes disapprovingly. “We have a case to solve, I can't waste precious time by lying in bed. I'm fine!”
Craving his partner's closeness, John was holding onto Sherlock until the last tremble of his orgasm subsided.
With an anxious sigh, John laid onto his back, folding his arms under his head and staring at the ceiling. Assessing Sherlock’s condition, he made mental notes for the man’s treatment plan, drawing up a few different scenarios. Of course, the best option would have been being back in London, where John could fetch the right medicine and conduct the needed examinations for a proper diagnosis, but he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t agree on abandoning the case for the sake of dealing with the breakdown of his transport. John couldn’t help but crack a half-amused smile at the mental image of Sherlock protesting. The doctor wondered, though, how long Lady Beresford would tolerate having a sick guest in her house, when that certain guest was supposed to be accomplishing an assignment that included keeping her out of harm’s way. Her mansion wasn’t a private hospital, and she wasn’t Mother Teresa. John feared her reaction, seeing how two-faced she was.
"Oh," it was all John could say, being touched and disappointed at the same time. Sherlock's reasoning was heart-warming, but on the other hand, the fact that the offer was some kind of compensation and not the real thing was disheartening.
He quickly changed into his pyjamas and brushed his teeth, his thoughts on James all along. John Watson had made a promise, and he wasn’t going to break it.
“I'm coming back soon,” John squeezed his boyfriend's arm reassuringly. “Hold on!” He shrugged off his jacket and draped it over the quivering man, hoping it would add a little bit of extra warmth. “I’ll be back as soon as possible,” he whispered. The miserable sight of the usually lively detective saddened John, and he couldn’t help but do what his mother always did when he was sick as a child—he tentatively placed a little, comforting kiss on Sherlock’s forehead. The feverish skin scorched his lips. Alarm filled John’s chest—both as a doctor and a friend. Sherlock needed help soon. His fever in the wake of that terrible downpour was worrisome, especially given that he was still wrapped in soaked clothes and lying on the wet ground in the chilly weather. Not to mention his ankle injury that should also have been treated. He would be lucky, if he hadn't caught pneumonia.
I'm not an expert of the psychology of attraction. Everything is from internet search, so if there's any inaccuracy, I apologise. No offense to anyone.
Certainly, everything had been different when he was a child. Every kid loved playing in the snow—riding a sledge, building a snowman, having a snowball fight—Sherlock had been no exception. He had anticipated the first snowfall every year, hardly waiting for the large, thick blanket on the ground in their garden before running outside, laughing, with Mycroft in tow. Once Mycroft left for the boarding school, playing in the snow didn't feel that satisfying and exciting anymore. Sherlock no longer looked forward to the first snow like before. Redbeard eased the apathy—running around with him had been good fun—but he wasn't a child, wasn't Mycroft.
is my first time.” Sherlock's eyes bore into John's. “The first that we'll both feel and remember. And that's what matters.”
John took a deep breath. Whatever his reply would be, it was going to change their dynamic and life. If he said no, he would live with regret all his life long, wondering what if. Not to mention, breaking Sherlock and pushing him back into the ‘caring is not an advantage’ mindset for good. Saying yes could give Sherlock a chance to be fully human and happy, even if only for a little while if things weren’t going to turn out as they wanted. Also, John would have a chance to figure out his feelings for him and see if they could work as an item.
Receiving no other reply than mere silence, he walked up to the desk, curious what the detective was so much engulfed in. Peering at the screen above his flatmate's shoulder, John's face flushed in embarrassment. The glimpse of naked male bodies entangled with each other was enough to regret his curiosity. A man watching porn was not a big deal, yet it was Sherlock Holmes, the man considered to be asexual. There had been times when John Watson wondered about the genius's sexual experience. He hadn't been sure that Sherlock's mind palace had a room for theoretical and practical knowledge of sex until their first time together. To the doctor's relief, Sherlock was a healthy young man with needs and desires, however his sexual appetite had been dormant for years.
“As a matter of fact, I still am. As taking one's virginity implies penetration, I still could be labelled as a virgin.”
“Touch me,” John whispered softly. “Experiment.” At Sherlock’s wide-eyed look, he added, “I’m giving you permission. I know you want to, your mind needs the data. Go ahead.”
Sherlock hobbled into the bathroom, wincing every now and then, his injured foot hurting with every step. After finally getting rid of the discomfort caused by his full bladder, he took a glance in the mirror. He looked terrible—unkempt, messy, sweat-stricken hair, dark circles around his weary, faded eyes—so very unlike the image of the great detective.
Sherlock bit back a moan and gripped the bed sheet. “John...” He whimpered, a cavalcade of conflicting emotions whirling inside. He longed for John making love to him, but on the other hand, he still couldn't disregard the shame he felt about his body and the lack of his sexual experience. But what frightened him the most was the prospect of loss of control—one reason why he had refused to fall in love. Love was destructive and deceiving, rendering the participants into puppets, pulling the strings in unpredictable ways, until they snapped and all that was left was pain and scars.
Entering the living room about ten minutes later, scrubbing absently at his wet hair with a towel, John found a blue dressing gown-clad Sherlock facing the window and torturing his beloved violin with loud, angry notes.
The morning after John returns. Sherlock explains the Beresford case, John makes a declaration and comes up with a suggestion that'd change their daily routine...
“It's an extremely deep meditation process, digging down to the vaults of the mind palace,” Sherlock explained. “Everything is stored there, even events that happened while you were unconscious or in a mentally limited state like drunkenness. Just pictures though, no feelings. There’s always the trouble with feelings,” he scoffed, “they require consciousness.”
This chapter is a bit longer than the first one, but consider it a gift from me to you on the occasion of my birthday this week. :)
“Start with light strokes,” John muttered. Sherlock squeezed him tenderly, recording his partner's tiniest reaction in his mind palace. “That's it… Ah– A bit more pressure...Like that... yeah...” John's head fell back. “A bit faster...God, yes... you're good...”
violence, drug abuse, mental and emotional torture / manipulation, power play, sexual abuse, attempted rape, mention of rape, prostitution and human trafficking
Once back in the Beresford residence, Lady Isabelle—now acting both as an angel and mother in one—insisted on the two having a bit of rest after the chilly episode, providing them everything they needed. Hot tea and their rooms’ heating turned up were beneficial to them in their exhausted state.
In case you might not get the reference for John saying "Just don't go singing", that was a nod to the song "If You Were Gay" from the Avenue Q musical. (It's a funny song, so if you don't know it, google it! It even has Sherlock fan version too!)
“Well, the whole process is not that amazing.” He knew he was going to crush that beautiful smile on John’s face, but he couldn’t hide the truth. “As a matter of fact, it's extremely exhausting and dangerous. After a few times, there's the possibility that it could do serious damage. Eventually, it can kill you.”
John’s eyes widened. “You... you’ve been thinking about being with me...?” Not-interested-in-sex-Sherlock having been pining for him seemed so surreal.
“No, it doesn't,” Sherlock countered. “We were under the influence of alcohol. The morning after, you called a halt, rejecting every form of physical intimacy. Thus, my inquiry is entirely justified.”
John still went on dates, but with Sherlock’s possessive nature and demand for John’s undivided attention, they usually ended in disaster. John often consoled himself with the thought that had he even managed to get a girlfriend, he might not be able to maintain a relationship with his insufferable, selfish flatmate around. Still, not even his bad luck in dating could have explained what had happened the night before. John surely wouldn’t have taken advantage of his friend and use him a substitute for a girlfriend.
“Oh yeah,” Sherlock licked the sensitive skin, while placing his hands on the doctor's chest and pushing him down onto the bed. “Reading your subconscious reactions is really enjoyable.” His mouth brushed along his lover's neck and collarbone, while his skilled fingers worked on the buttons of the striped shirt.
John exhaled loudly in relief. “Ta. I'm John. So you work for Lady Beresford?” he asked as they walked back to the woods.
Although he had acquired information of what semen tasted like in order to know what to expect, the flavour was nothing he had imagined. The salty, warm, sticky fluid was alien on his tongue, but not as revolting as he had assumed. It had a strange alikeness to oysters, which—having French ancestors—used to be a regular course at large family dinners. After the initial tentativeness, Sherlock realised that, in fact, he quite liked it, and eagerly swallowed John's cum to the last drop.
An unexpected encounter with someone John hasn't heard from for long leads to important relevations, easing some weight off John's shoulders. Sherlock and John have a heated argument, saying things they don't mean, but soon realise what's at stake...
“Stop this!“ hissing, eyes sharp like a knife, John turned around in a sudden move. ”Just stop this! For a genius you are utterly stupid at times! I thought you already knew me better than that. Where are those extraordinary observation skills of the great Sherlock Holmes?? What should I do or say to show that I'm not ashamed of being with you?? To make you see how much you mean to me, that I love you more than I have ever loved anyone? I've already killed for you, and yes, I'd do the other way around too, I'd die for you, Sherlock fucking Holmes! I'd die for you so you brilliant git could live. Even hundred women don't come up to you. I'm not interested in men, but if I had to choose between a beautiful, smart, lovely woman and you, I'd choose you in a heartbeat. And once in my life I so bloody don't care what others say.”
“No, it's not!” Sherlock countered vehemently, giving a fleeting glance to the army fatigues John wore. While at other times he found the apparel exciting, now he hated it because it symbolised that the army was taking John away from him. “You belong here.”
We've arrived to a turning point at the end of this chapter - in the next chapter, stakes are getting higher, things are getting serious, the mood darkens and angst-level raises high. If you are triggered by explicit description of violence, torture, rape, I suggest you skipping the next (two) chapter(s) and come back for the final chapter.
“I don't want you to give me what they did. I want what YOU can give me.” He stared into the beautiful blue pools, letting their look communicate.
, another voice called, but unlike the hateful, terrifying tone of his father, this was soft, caring and encouraging. John’s eyes widened in surprise.
Sherlock drank in the happy glow on John's face, the pure, innocent, childlike enthusiasm for such an ordinary thing like snow warming his insides. An odd, unusual sensation flared up in his chest. His heart overflowed with warmth and genuine delight, some intense, selfless feeling that he had never experienced before John entered his life. Why did he suddenly feel such ease and satisfaction about someone else's joy? He used to experience such contentment only at developments that favoured his interest and things that stimulated him in a positive way, mentally or physically—never for someone else. And now, here he was, amazed by John's silly joy for something as tedious as snow. Why? Was it because he couldn't be arsed to appreciate those tedious things himself? Or was it a side effect of being in love? Whatever the reason was, it felt surprisingly good. He loved seeing John happy, more than being glad himself. The feeling corresponded to the thrill that drugs could elicit. Gazing at the doctor's radiant face, he made a mental note that from now on his priority was going to be ensuring John's happiness.
“So what now?” John's hand enveloped Sherlock's. “Shall we tell it to our friends, or let them figure it out on their own?”
John had never been more confused in his life. Part of him wanted to have sex with Sherlock again, and remember it too, but another part hit the breaks, calling for a halt. He couldn’t bear losing Sherlock and his friendship if that arrangement didn’t work.
So if any of these triggers you, skip this chapter! As some part of the next chapter deals with the aftermath, if you want to be safe, come back for the last chapter.
John's eyes searched his. Sherlock having uttered those three little words not so long ago, the doctor  expected himself to be the giving end tonight and please the detective as some kind of reward. Now Sherlock suggesting the other way around, his plans went into thin air.
John arose from the ground and checked his phone. “Still no signal,” he frowned. “I’ll go and get some help. Hopefully there's some coverage closer to the mansion.”
Hey, hey! I'm back! Sorry for the lack of updates in the past two weeks, but as I said I was on holiday. Missed me? :P
“You said ‘you think’—what does that mean?” Ignoring the mocking question, Sherlock raised a brow, apparently still processing the information.
“Shh.” His free hand sneaked up to the pale, moon-lit face and cupped it gently. John’s breathing turned shallow, and his heart thumped louder in his chest. His eyes fell on the perfect lips, before finding the twinkling silver-blue eyes once again. Sherlock stared back at him with dilated pupils and slightly parted lips.
A happy glow lit up John's eyes, and he opened his mouth to say something, but Sherlock cut in with a smile.
Sherlock arched into the touch, finding the sensation unexpectedly delightful. He never knew that some stimuli to his nipples could elicit such a pleasant feeling. He jolted and stifled a cry when a hot mouth suddenly replaced sturdy fingers, sucking lightly.
John's imploring look was too much. Though Sherlock was adamant to learn the story behind the battle wound, he couldn't defy John's desperate pleading. He nodded in understanding and obediently dropped his hand onto John's hip while softly covering John's lips with his own once again.
Sherlock edged closer, looming over John. “Save it,” he groaned impatiently, placing his hands on John's hips, pulling him closer. “We've done enough talking during the past months!”
“I think I’m having an sexual identity crisis,” John snorted with a chuckle. “Ridiculous. All my life, I was interested in women, had countless dates and many relationships, I even earned the nickname Three Continents Watson, and then... I meet a brilliant, though insufferable, beautiful man, and I suddenly find myself completely enthralled by him, until I realise that my admiration toward him might have turned into more… something I can’t name, but what certainly is more than I should feel for... you…”
Listening to the detective’s long, rapid-fire deductions and losing track in the whirlwind of words and giving up on finding his way back, John often caught himself getting distracted by Sherlock’s aesthetic appeal and wondering how could a man be that beautiful. During these times, John couldn’t pay attention to the meaning of the words tumbling out of that artistically shaped Cupid bow—that many women could certainly be envious for—but let himself be lulled by the delicious rumble of that unmistakable, velvet baritone. His eyes followed Sherlock’s every notion—the easy, catlike moves, the soft thump of feet, the graceful gestures of the delicate hands, the elegant tilt of head—drinking in the mesmerising sight. Every so often, he felt the urge to smooth the stray hair away from the man’s pale forehead and dive his fingers into the soft, dark curls that gracefully crowned the head that was the home of the constantly buzzing, brilliant mind.
“He is one of the few people that doesn’t consider me a freak,” Sherlock noted quietly, tapping his finger on the glass, before looking up at John timidly. “Remember when you asked me if I dated anyone?”
Cautiously scooting closer to his boyfriend, he sneaked his arm around the sturdy, pyjama-clad torso, watching John's features for any sign of stirring. John didn't notice anything; his chest rose and fell peacefully in his sleep. A bit bolder, Sherlock snuggled closer, shortening the distance between their bodies. He could smell John's scent and feel the warmth of the compact body—it was heaven. He couldn't help but stare at John, intently studying the handsome face. He loved watching John, he couldn't get enough of the lovely sight. His gaze fell onto the delicate eyelids with the sandy sweep of eyelashes hiding the beautiful, warm navy blue eyes underneath, the very eyes that could worship or kill him with one look. Watching the rapid movements underneath the eyelids and sensing the change in the man's breathing, Sherlock concluded that John was right in the REM sleep phase, the period of dreams.
“You do? I don't.” Sherlock shrugged. His hungry eyes continued their journey on John's upper body, until caught by a large pinkish spot on John's left shoulder.
Before some of you might get upset on my approach on John's sexuality, this is my take on the issue in this fic. Some people reject the idea of him being "gay for only Sherlock", so if this concept isn't your cup of tee, please, just accept it here and don't come at me, telling me off. I respect everyone's opinion; but please, John is just a fictional character. I'm open to civilised discussion, but no flaming, thank you.
he admonished himself. But what really bothered him was the fact that he couldn't be angry with himself for the way the evening had turned out after all.
“I think most of us like and respect her. But of course, there are always the exceptions. You know, how it is—conflicts about money, preferences, work quality, lies, secrets... just the usual stuff. So, you are guests of Lady Beresford?” The old man narrowed his eyes contemplatively.
That closeness had felt so damn right. Waking up beside Sherlock, his beautiful face being the first thing to see, greeted with that precious smile was amazing. John’s heart still fluttered at the memory. Under other circumstances, he would have relished the experience, snuggling up to the genius, savouring the feel of the warm skin and soft hair against his palm and inhaling Sherlock’s lovely scent.
Hello again! Finally a new chapter. I'm sorry for the lack of update but, as i said last time, I  had an operation (as far as it seems, it went fine) and I'm still in recovery.
John swallowed hard, never breaking the eye contact. “Not what?” He could swear his low voice was wavering.
John couldn’t be more grateful to Harry for her reassuring, eye-opening words that made him finally be able to accept that he had non-platonic feelings for a man, which left him with what people called ‘bisexuality’. Though John would rather label himself ‘straight with one exception’ or ‘Sherlock-sexual,’ Sherlock surely would frown at these terms and give a lengthy speech about the pointlessness of labels, one which John could actually agree with, even while hoping to be spared the rant.
He didn't do sentiment, and he most certainly didn't feel the urge to fulfil sexual needs, so the only plausible explanation was the scientific approach.
Limping back to the room, he settled back into the bed beside his still peacefully sleeping bedmate. The moonlight, filtering through the large window, fell onto the doctor, bathing his face in its magical light. His grey-blond hair was shining like silver and gold, giving him the ethereal look of an angel. Sherlock had never seen him more beautiful. Drinking in the sight, he wondered what would happen if he kissed John now.
They gazed at each other, communicating silently for a long moment, before John spoke again. “Just for the record, I'm still most likely not gay.”
John gave him a warm, appreciative look. “Don't worry about me, love,” he smiled affectionately, using the endearment for the first time during the time of their relationship. “A soldier here, remember? God save anyone hurting you in any way.”
He enters the living room and sits down in his chair opposite Sherlock’s, glass of punch balancing precariously on the armrest.
John looks down to Sherlock then, giving him a chance to indicate that he doesn't want Mycroft to know this, but Sherlock avoids his gaze. There’s an unreadable expression in his eyes. As though he’s somewhere else entirely. Trust Sherlock bloody Holmes to zone out of this, of all things! And with that, John's brief foray into plying his allegiance to Sherlock is over and he quickly summarises the conversation he and Sherlock had at Bart’s earlier. Which sounds so much worse, he realises, when it’s not spoken by Sherlock’s far too calm voice understating the severity of the dosages he’s subjected himself to.
John leans in and kisses him, swallowing up both questions and fears. He’s gentle, gentler than he’s ever been before. Their first kisses were fiery and intense, years and years of pent-up passion, but this is the opposite: years and years of longing to touch, to feel, to savour and it’s soft and controlled and almost tender in its hesitance and sincerity.
