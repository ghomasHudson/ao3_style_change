Sherlock landed in the small clearing, John barely sliding from his back before he was shifting and storming towards the hidden packs. He started digging through everything and tossing things aside in to a pile then started going through Bowen's packs as well.
When Sherlock got back to the cave John had fallen asleep, a new ration of meat drying and the basket quite full. The deer was starting to stink so he shoved the rest out of the cave and let the river take it away. The egg was toasty warm so he left it as it was and shifted back to two legs, gathering his discarded shorts that John had picked up and folded neatly on their pack. The doctor was shivering slightly despite his proximity to the fire and the blanket he was curled up in so Sherlock moved to lay behind him, gathering man and blanket against him and wrapping a wing around them both. John wiggled against him, sighing softly, then went back to his soft snoring, a smile on his face. Sherlock smirked to himself, burying his nose in soft golden curls.
“About 4 in the morning,” Sherlock replied without opening his eyes. “We should probably leave soon if you're feeling up to it so we can make up lost time.” John nodded, shoveling the rest of the food in his mouth and getting to his feet to check his balance. He felt a lot better after the rest and food and dug a couple pain pills out to push away the hint of a headache, ignoring the icy eyes watching his every move. He shoved everything back into the bags, securing them closed again and picked up Sherlock's harnesses from nearby.
John woke before the dragon, warm against his belly, the fire just coals. He got up enough to stir up the fire and throw a couple logs on, then settled back against the dragon comfortably. Sherlock let out a long huff of air, tail tightening around the egg and one large paw scratching lazily. John smiled despite their circumstances, never would he have thought that this is where he'd end up in a few short months. He finally got to his feet thinking of all the things that needed done, first trading stones out for the egg, being careful not to step on the twitching tail. He gathered up all the meat that had dried while they slept, putting most of it in his makeshift basket and pocketing a few pieces for himself. He laid out more strips to dry on the stones then a change of clothes and headed out to the river. It was warm out and looked to be around 4 in the afternoon as he stripped out of his dirty jacket and fatigues and slipped down in to the frigid water. He found a pool where the water wasn't moving as quickly that went up to his waist and scrubbed at his arms and chest until he was pink and clean once more. He dunked his head quickly, scrubbing at his curls until they felt less gritty then looked up and realized he had a visitor. Sherlock had woken up and was laying on the river bank watching him, head cocked curiously.
“Get some sleep,” John instructed finally. “We both need it.” Sherlock nodded, eyes already fluttering closed and John yawned before laying down next to the dragon comfortably.
“John?” Mike stuttered, dropping the rolls of bandages he'd been holding. “What happened to you?” He quickly moved to cut the ropes John had tied himself down with, helping the man down and pulling his arm around his shoulder to help him move into the medical tent. John was sat down on a cot and Mike quickly went to work, cutting away the soiled bandages around his leg. Molly was at his elbow in a second, a bowl of clean water in her hands and clean bandages tucked against her side. Sherlock was in the tent a moment later in his human form, a pair of shorts pulled on haphazardly, and the bag with their package tucked under his arm. He sat the bag next to John and took the spot on the other side of the soldier, pressing into his side gently.
“ 's all right,” John chuckled. “I needed one too. I'm hungry and gotta pee.” Sherlock's eyes scanned the surrounding area suspiciously before nodding with a grunt. He started digging through their food supplies bag so John wandered off into the woods to find a suitable tree.
John relaxed as they ascended into the cloud cover, patting Sherlock's neck comfortingly. “We made it,” he murmured, pressing his hand against the warm expanse of shoulder next to his knee. Sherlock grumbled, the vibration passing through John's hand and making him smile. His joy was short lived as a blast of heat slammed into them and white hot pain shot through his leg. He clutched the handle in front of him as Sherlock shrieked and lurched, wings beating the air frantically as he looked around for their attacker. A jet black streak went flying overhead and Sherlock immediately snapped his wings in, diving away from the danger.
“I'll be fine,” he murmured, patting the dragon's thigh gently. “You got us here so fast there should be hardly any chance of infection.” Sherlock smiled in relief, nuzzling his face against John's a moment and catching the eye of Molly who was watching them with a small smile on her face. She quickly looked away, moving to hold a bandage for Mike as he started wrapping. Sherlock put some distance back between his soldier and himself just as the tent flap was opened with a flourish. Bowen stepped in, looking concerned and quickly waved them off as both soldiers struggled to get up.
They flew for hours, Sherlock's steadily beating wings the only sound in the night. John was stiff and getting tired, hands frozen around the saddle handle and eyes watering. Sherlock chirruped suddenly, drawing John's attention forward to where Bowen and Lestrade had started to descend.
“Moriarty heel,” General Zane called and the dragon backed off Sherlock, leering at him. Sherlock made a pained noise and John hurried to his side. There were several bite wounds across Sherlock's shoulder, oozing steadily. “See to it that you do not go on another one of your joy rides without express permission Watson.” The man left, snapping his fingers at Moriarty who followed in annoyance.
“We'll take the egg, go off the grid. Maybe I'll be able to find Mycroft and have him take her, keep her safe.” His eyes were glazing over, lost in thoughts and plans.
“Sherlock you weren't bonded with anyone, you were becoming hostile,” Mycroft explained probably for the hundredth time, pinching the bridge of his nose. Sherlock didn't say anything more, just adjusted John's head so his face wasn't smashed in to the blanket, fingers ghosting through the blonde curls.
“Or we can just take the dragon with us,” Zane smirked, looking up at Sherlock who's eyes were narrowed dangerously.
“You'll get us both in trouble talking to them like that,” John said gently, stroking Sherlock's curls. “Just watch that tongue okay?” Sherlock nodded like a scolded child as Mike finished up John's shoulder bandage and gave a nod of pleasure at his work.
“He is my ghivashel,” Sherlock muttered, smoothing ointment over John's back and missing the look of surprise on Mycroft's face.
“Okay! Okay....” he soothed, thumbs grazing over the startled dragon's cheek bones. “We won't go back. What do we do?” Sherlock nuzzled in to John's hand, eyes closing a moment.
“Let me see,” he insisted, holding his hand out expectantly. John handed over his shoddy work, blushing slightly as the dragon bent over his leg to work. Sherlock was gentle with him, lifting and moving his leg carefully. He worked in silence for a while, occasionally muttering to himself as John watched. It didn't take long for the dragon to finish and take a step back with a satisfied chirp.
“You okay?” he asked softly when John winced. Mike was scrubbing the burn clean, intent on his work so John allowed himself to lean his head into Sherlock's shoulder a moment.
“I will not go back there John!” he growled. “Zane is behind this all, you heard them! I will not go back!” His eyes were shifting gold again and John surged forward, grasping Sherlock's face between his hands.
“I'm going to bathe,” he breathed, then got to his feet in one fluid movement, wings tucking against his back as he headed toward the entrance. John lay there panting a moment and face flushed before sitting up and tucking his erection in to his waist band.
John balked a little when they rounded the corner and found the general with Lestrade still in human form nuzzled under his arm. John coughed a little and Bowen turned to glance at him with a smile.
“Thanks,” John mumbled as he started shoveling food into mouth. Sherlock only nodded, eyes closing in contemplation. “What time is it?” he asked after swallowing a mouthful.
“Sherlock what is going on? What was all that about?” John demanded, yanking the pack out of his hands. When Sherlock's gaze snapped back up at him his eyes were glowing gold, the dragon barely contained beneath this human guise.
“He wants a completely obedient killing machine,” the first argued, injecting the syringe in to a port that led in to the pedestal. “If you want to keep this job you better keep your mouth shut.” They left the room again and John looked around carefully before hurrying towards the glass doors, Sherlock shuffling behind him.
“Well Watson I'd be happy to have you out more often on missions if you'd be interested,” Bowen offered.
“John,” he said after a moment, and John realized he had closed his eyes. Sherlock was standing right in front of him, blue eyes studying him carefully. The jumpsuit was on but zipped only to his navel, allowing a generous portion of skin and scale to show. “Are you ready?” John nodded, exiting the room with Sherlock following. They were boarded on the plane, Sherlock snarling when an officer tried to help with the straps and buckles. Finally everyone was aboard and the hatch closed with an ominous thud as a few dim lights flickered on overhead. John could barely see anyone around him and gave a shuddering breath. His life was about to change dramatically. He jumped when suddenly a hand touched his forearm gently. He looked over at Sherlock who's eyes were glowing slightly in the dimness. “We'll make it back.” Sherlock said simply and removed his hand back to his lap. John turned away but felt a thrill through him. Sherlock had allowed contact between them.
“Your brother?” John exclaimed and almost fell off his seat if Sherlock hadn't grabbed his arm to steady him. “Why did your brother attack me?”
“Sir if I may,” John started, making Bowen pause. “I have a dragon question.” Bowen gestured for Lestrade to wait and turned back into the tent. “You see...” John started, struggling how to word his question. “Sherlock is very...tactile.” He cringed at his own words but he'd already gone this far. “Is your dragon the same?” Bowen smiled warmly and chuckled.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, pressing fingers to his temple. “Let's hear what I'd have to do first. If we're riding the whole time I'll have you to take care of me.”Sherlock smirked at that, chest swelling proudly a moment.
“You really care about this doctor,” Mycroft commented, glancing at John half asleep and propped up against their pack and a thick wooly blanket.
By John's remembrance of the map they should be reaching the area where the item was kept here soon when a shout came from behind them. Sherlock chirruped and like John was guessing, struggled to turn around in the narrow hall. He could see guards coming, swords raised and yelped when Sherlock shifted beneath him. John hit the ground rather hard but struggled to get back to his feet, reaching for his dagger. The dragon stepped between them though, wings stretched protectively and a snarl ripped through the man. The first guard lunged wildly and Sherlock sidestepped him slightly, grabbing the hand holding the sword and knocking him in the back of the head with his other hand. He tossed the man aside with ease, sword still in hand and turned to face the other guards who looked a little more worried now that the humanoid dragon had a sword in hand. John watched Sherlock grin then spin in to the first attack, driving the man back, parrying every blow he tried then knocking him in the side of the head with the flat of his blade. John didn't know it was possible for the dragon to be much more impressive than he already was, but as he stood there gaping at the dragon taking on all four of the guards at once, sword swinging gracefully, he smiled softly.
“The rest of them ran,” he told them, inspecting the man on Sherlock's back. “Transport is on its way for the injured. Looks like we won today.”
“That one? You don't want him,” the seller snorted. “He's gonna be put out of his misery next week. Trouble that one is.”
“Your back is in shreds,” Sherlock growled softly. “I think this warrants using some.” John shook his head again, letting his face flop in to the wadded up blanket. He heard the dragon sigh and shuffle closer, fingers running through his hair gently. “Mycroft can bring us more supplies,” he offered this time. “Please take these.” John rolled his head enough to peer at his dragon with one eye, seeing how it pained him to even suggest asking his brother for help. He held out his hand finally, taking the pills Sherlock dropped there and popping them in to his mouth, followed by a swig of water that the dragon offered him next. “Do you want to change position? Maybe lay on your belly for a while?” John thought for a moment then finally nodded, sitting up with a cringe and letting Sherlock help ease him down.
“I...I have to Sherlock,” John stammered. “I can't tell him no, he's my commander.” Sherlock sighed, pressing his forehead against John's, eyes closing.
When they arrived at the army base John led the way to a large warehouse looking building and stopped at the desk to check in. Sherlock looked around, noticing a few other dragons nearby. Most of them were collared and chained, being led around like dogs by their masters. The ones that weren't looked so miserably beaten and depressed that had the opportunity to escape risen they probably wouldn't even have tried taking it. Sherlock found himself growling under his breath when John realized what his source of distress was.
“Well this is Sherlock,” John said, gesturing at the dragon beside him. “Lightning drake, been together a couple weeks.” Sherlock's hide crackled with electricity proudly, making Molly visibly cringe. Mike whistled in appreciation, taking in the dark dragon.
When John returned to the living room washed and clothed Sherlock was waiting in his half human form and had even managed to cut and tie the t-shirt John had left him to his needs. He looked bored but followed John out of the apartment and even managed to hail a cab when John's tries had failed miserably.
When John woke again the sun was rising and he realized his coat was almost completely dry. He sat up slowly, rolling his shoulders to release the tight muscles and looked around curiously.
“It's your funeral,” he grumbled. John went to the human sized door, watching as one of the men unlocked it and opened it just enough for him to squeeze in. He stepped inside and immediately the door was slammed and locked behind him. The dragon was backed into a corner, electricity still crackling over his scales, but he simply watched John, no act of hostility...yet.
“Finding cover so we can set up camp for the night,” Sherlock said simply, heading toward the tree line. John slowly relaxed, leaning his cheek against the dragon's warm shoulder as he walked. Sherlock finally found a cave and kicked some brush into a pile to lay John on, the pine needles forming a cushioned bed. Sherlock sat up him down gently, hand ghosting over his hair. John let his eyes flutter closed and felt the press of lips against his brow before he let sleep take him.
“I have to go check out the area,” he said regretfully, eyes still glancing at John's red swollen lips. “Make sure the coast is clear.” But he leaned forward again, kissing John again a little more forcefully and cradling the doctor's head in one hand. When he pulled away this time gold was circling his pupils, teeth sharp.
“Right in here sir,” he explained. “This is where we keep the ones strong enough for the military.” John stepped into the dank area, scanning the cages on either side of him. Dragons in various forms from ones that looked fully human to ones that were quite cramped in full dragon form littered the cages. The ones in this part of the facility were meant to have more of an attitude and power so most the dragons he passed were glaring obstinately at him. They came to the end of the row and he started to follow the man around a corner when something caught his eye. An obsidian scale glinted in the dim light and he followed the shape up to a pair of golden eyes that were staring back at him intensely.
“Right...” he mumbled to himself. “Patrol. I'll be back by nightfall.” John watched the dragon drop his shorts, struggling a little, then shift awkwardly and head out of the cave.
“Is he tame?” the man asked gruffly, gesturing at the dragon. Sherlock snarled in response, baring his teeth.
“The thing about dragons is, they're very possessive of what they deem theirs,” Bowen explained. “And to them, we are their most prized possessions. They want to keep us for themselves. I understand Sherlock was going to be put down and that's why you chose him?” John nodded, still taking in everything he'd been told. “Then he feels he owes you his life. He'll protect you till his last breath John. Cherish what you have together.” John nodded again and Bowen took his leave, patting Lestrade's neck affectionately on his way out. There was no one in the medical tent that day so John dragged a chair out front, stretching out and letting the sun warm his tanned skin. He'd almost dozed off when a shadow blocked out his light. He squinted up and smiled at Sherlock who was in his dragon form still. The dragon chirruped, pushing his face into John's hands asking to be scratched and John complied with a chuckle. Once his itch had been sufficiently scratched Sherlock curled up around John's chair to bask in the sun, even letting John prop his feet up along his back.
“Come on Sherlock,” John grumbled shaking the dragon slightly. A low growl was his only response but he got up, sliding into his dragon form as he exited the tent, tail dragging behind him. The sun was already high in the sky as they shambled towards their shared tent and Sherlock collapsed into his nest of blankets with a thud. John climbed into his own cot, pulling the familiar blankets around him and passing out.
“Ya have no idea wha' you're dealin' wif,” a man missing quite a few teeth snapped. “Lucky te be alive in the 'morrow,” he mumbled and went to his position by the cage door.
Bowen started pulling out some breakfast for them to split as he started attaching Lestrade's harness, granola bar in his mouth as he worked. He followed John's lead, tossing the things they wouldn't immediately need in the pile and dragging some branches over it all for camouflage.
John woke a few hours later, his back throbbing, and blinked blearily at his surroundings. He was propped up on the pack, fire burning, and nearby he could hear soft voices. He tried to sit up a little and hissed at the pain, fingers clenching in the canvas in front of him. The voices stopped and Sherlock slipped in to the cave and towards the med pack sitting near him, digging for more of the pain medication.
Holmes snorted. “As satisfied as I can be after the drastic turn of events. Abbott’s actions were unpredictable, even for me, I should say.” He was still as arrogant as ever, however, I noted with affection.
We were nearing the end, I was pleased and relieved to see. While doing paperwork with Holmes was not nearly comparable to chasing villains in the dead of night in terms of daunting situations I had put myself through at his request, I was nevertheless grateful to see an end in sight.
The events of this singular case can never be published, that much has been abundantly clear since the moment the body was found in our sitting room. I considered for a while not penning it at all for risk of our safety, and yet over time have reconsidered, finding comfort in putting it to paper here, in my most private of journals where it will then, of course, go on to the tin-dispatch box at Cox & Co along with the rest of my materials that carry details of cases that deal with delicate matters.
Lestrade looked between the both of us, and I could see plainly that he did not wish to leave our mystery unattended, especially with his confusion at Holmes’ sudden dismissal. He would have to however, and God forgive me but I was grateful then for whatever crime had taken place to remove him from our sitting room and the conversation I was about to start. “Alright. Do not hesitate to wire for me if there is anything I can do.” And then mercifully, he departed.
“If you are going to extoll the virtues of open communication then it would do for me to inform you that I believe tossing your empty vials and discarded notes haphazardly into the hidden space beside the cabinet does not qualify as cleaning, and that Mrs. Hudson is beginning to grow tetchy with
On our step was the fellow that had been in conversation with myself, Holmes, and Macnair last night, one James Abbott, to my knowledge. He looked nervous, his eyes flitting between me and Mrs. Hudson behind me with some bemusement, and he held up a note. “I was instructed to come here at 10 this morning, and call on Mr. Vernet?”
Around 9 o’clock as she was readying for bed, she had let in two gentlemen who did not seem either to understand both the lateness of the hour or that Mr. Holmes was not in at the moment.
“Oh no. No, from what we have observed your flowers are marvelous, we have no complaints there. It is your supply of these flowers that we are most concerned with. Do you buy these wholesale, or grow them yourselves?”
“Undoubtedly so, but as I have said to Watson here on many an occasion: people carry with them dark and unknowable depths. In the case of Macnair however, it is already known to me that he is a violent and disagreeable man who could easily be pushed to these lengths, and so it is up to us to bring this information to light.”
, or our Mr. Langley, had written them some five to seven years ago. They were then kept folded into the bottom drawer of his desk, only to be found by someone who did not understand his organization and was looking for something hidden. These letters were indeed hidden, but not in the same intention as the ring she hoped to find, and had not been removed for quite some time. I do not believe their removal will even be accounted for until Miss Finnegan calls attention to it later today.”
“Thank you, Archie.” I said politely instead, before entering inside as he let me pass. The whole of it encompassed many rooms intended for private purposes, and organized in a veritable maze, but for tonight I merely made my way to the main part of the establishment where there was a bar, music, and a comfortable atmosphere meant to enrich and relax. It was all just as I remembered it, and I was struck instantly by the sounds and smells and sights that had greeted me when I had been a more frequent visitor, and for a second was taken back to the state of mind that I had been in then - lonely, and desperate not to be so.
“They are clear enough, Holmes! Someone wants me dead, and they have demonstrated this with abundant clarity!”
I gave a shrug, helpless with the grand speech he had just made of my virtues, and his countenance, and what that may mean. “You have made your case, and although some part of me still rebels against it, I realize that there is no way I can come to understand how speedily your mind works when it is confronted with a problem, and how explaining the details of your plans can take time. As long as I have your word that you trust me, and that on the occasion that the situation is truly dire, you take me into your confidence. Can you do that?”
Holmes snorted, and merely buried his nose further into me, his eyes shutting once more. “In the interest of honesty, John, I would much rather go for a nap than handle anything of the sort at the moment.”
Holmes gave a somewhat kind, genial smile to Abbott, who had blindly agreed with everything he had said, seemingly still stunned by his own actions, but wisely trusting the man to act in his best interest.
Holmes, albeit under a pseudonym, a frequent patron of the same club for the discerning Uranian gentlemen that I was - both of us unknowingly, and having just missed each other besides? I spared a thought that he might have been here for the same reasons he was tonight, for some fact finding mission, but dismissed it - he had been seen attending for far too long, and for what case? He had made it clear that he didn’t believe the activities that took place here to be a crime. No, Holmes seemed to be as much a denizen of this club as I was, absent as we both were until tonight, and I now retraced his steps through what Macnair has just told me.
Macnair cleared his throat, squeezing his hand - it was on my bad shoulder, unfortunately, and I had had to hide my wince. “So, you are back in England then I take it, Vernet?”
He shook his head once again. “I can no longer see point in doing so. I attended for the same reason that you did, I believe. I harbored some intense internal hatred before loneliness at your marriage won out in the end, and although my own paranoia sparked the disguise you saw me don, I sought out community against desolation as I believed my feelings for you to be quite unrequited.”
“I see, I see.” The inspector shook his head, “Nasty business all around, but proof that you are not always infallible yourself, Mr. Holmes! I am sorry it all fell out at your door, however.”
When I had given him all I had he put his arm on my good shoulder. “I may be late back, Watson, but I hope you will wait up for me.” As was the case with the bulk of our disagreements, he seemed content to act as if it had not happened at all besides to let up on his disputatiousness somewhat.
I did not have any appointments today, as my patient list had dwindled low enough recently that this wasn’t an uncommon occurrence. I had instead meant to spend the day writing, smoothing over a draft of a case that we had solved a month or so previous. Somehow going through an entire forest’s worth of paperwork seemed infinitely more enjoyable, mostly as a result of Holmes being involved. But perhaps that says more about me than it does him.
Holmes took it, which brought me some strange relief, though his eyes were still indecipherable. When he spoke his voice was unrecognizable, and his accent French. “William Vernet, it is very nice to make your acquaintance.” And then to my surprise, he did not let go of my hand but leaned down and lifted it to his lips, so as to kiss it gently.
“We’re dreadfully sorry, Mrs. Hudson, we will have it cleaned up by the end of the day, I promise. In that time we would greatly benefit from one of your delicious lunches, as it will no doubt speed our progress.”
- ACD had a habit of referring to Lestrade's appearance as kind of rodentia and who am i to stop the tradition?
Holmes gestured for him to take a seat at our table, and then sat opposite him as he did, facing the window and me. He then immediately rose to bring the bottle of whiskey that sat on our sideboard and two glasses, which he laid on the table before sitting down once again.
He smiled at me over the cigarette in his mouth, before quirking his head. I looked in the direction he indicated, to a church across the street, where to my surprise our own Douglas Macnair was exiting, shaking hands with the priest in thanks for the service.
“Of course, Holmes.” As if I could have done anything else. His face as he left - alone - stuck with me, his nod and then subsequent clap on the shoulder, as if that would mend things (to my further infuriation it did somewhat mollify me). He looked almost unwilling to go, but I conceded this was unlikely as my opinion could hardly be considered given my own bias.
Holmes clapped my good shoulder. “Aha! See, Watson, how we have just secured our evidence! Come, next we must see where he supplies his poison, and then we may begin the final preparations in earnest.”
I watched, powerless, as the two men prepared their poison-filled glass, and took their seats across from each other. It was madness unfolding before me, and yet something was gluing my feet to the floor, and I cursed my inaction while I was unable to change it. My voice was low when I gasped out, “Holmes, you cannot be serious.”
I watched him walk back into the sitting room and step over the body so as to retrieve his pipe and settle in for a night of contemplation, calling behind himself, “Goodnight, Watson.”
“And then of course,” Macnair stood too, and gestured to the room. “And then he returned, the astonishing and awe-inspiring detective, not dead for all that you had mourned him, and you in turn returned to his side without a thought to me. Me, who had just spent the better part of a year gaining your trust and putting the work in to find my way into your confidence. Months of my life that were now proved to be
At that, Holmes fumbled slightly, calculating, and thinking as quickly as I could I supplied him with, “I was a mutual friend of them both, and knew firsthand Macnair’s exploits, so I was the one who informed Abbott when I heard his sister had gotten involved with the blackguard. As such, he took his revenge on me.”
“There isn’t? One would think living once again with the great Sherlock Holmes would bring one excitement after the next!”
“Yes!” I said, emphatically, wondering what danger he’d perceived to be so great as to be reduced to such trepidation.
“Then we must look closer,” Holmes said, and knelt down before the body to pick up the flowers laid on the man’s left jacket pocket. “I believe these may hold the answer.”
I considered the question. I flatter myself to think that I am an overall genial presence and an amiable person to most, and those that I am on less certain terms with are fairly few in number. I did not myself have many enemies, especially not compared to my companion, though I suppose anyone who wished him dead wouldn’t see much use in my being alive either. I was just one obstacle to him, and I said as much to the inspector.
- watson makes a reference to the "the love that dare not speak its name" quote from Lord Alfred Douglas’ poetry, that in the future through Oscar Wilde will made even more clearly to be a euphemism for homosexuality.
- “It seems now that there is a long night ahead of us, although I believe I have indeed narrowed our scope immeasurably. Eat, and get some rest today, for at 8 tonight the chase will commence in earnest.”
I nodded, pulling out my pencil and beginning my task as he started to expound on the important details of one J. J. Binder who had instigated a number of assaults over the summer of ‘93.
“This may be an odd request,” Holmes tilted his head so as to seem somewhat reluctant, glancing at me before his eyes were on the florist once more, “but do you happen to carry violets? Specifically speaking, blue violets?”
What greeted me however, cut any exhilaration short, as Holmes failed to answer my retort, instead standing still in the doorway to our sitting room with his expression shattered in a way I had never seen before and hope I never again will. I immediately went to his side, to see what he was looking at that would inspire such shock, and was not disappointed.
He rolled his eyes and threw his cigarette down before beginning the walk home, and I fell into step with him. “Yes, that rather was a revelation, was it not?”
Douglas Macnair grinned one final time. “Of course.” The fight left him, and he finally went limp in my arms.
Holmes nodded, and allowed him. “That is very good of you, but I assure you I have no plan up my sleeve. This is as much a matter of luck for me as it is to you, Macnair.” He took a deep breath, still keeping his gaze steadfastly forward. “Now, shall we say on ‘three’?”
I merely laughed before sending him on his way, rising myself from the bench to call a cab and set off for my club, where I had a pressing engagement to arrange. I was filled with nerves, but steeled myself, thinking of the faith my friend had put into me.
Too late I realized what Holmes most likely had already, that all my instances listed of being envious of someone in a romantic sense were over himself. If he noticed I could not tell, for he only nodded to himself as if this was information he had guessed at even as I flushed and looked away hastily, hoping he would not comment on it.
“You have found our accomplice then?” I referred to his wording last night, and he nodded knowingly.
Holmes handed me the ledger he had been scribbling in. “Read back for me what is already written, and transcribe what I dictate. I’m updating and reviewing.”
I opened the door to an empty sitting room, but the small fire in the grate told me that I was not alone, even as the door to Holmes’ room appeared shut. I led my companions to take seats, sitting in my own chair and Abbott taking the settee. Macnair chose Holmes’ armchair, and I felt the wrongness snarl in my gut.
I averted my gaze from my friend, knowing that against my will the bright red tips of my ears were giving me away regardless. He would no doubt have figured out my untoward feelings toward him by then, if he had not already, and in the most embarrassing way possible. I inwardly cursed Macnair.
Holmes did not have anything to add, but I saw his forehead wrinkle as he frowned. “And finally, a blue violet.”
When I finally did go downstairs, hours later, those words still dwelled in my mind but I felt refreshed enough to confront whatever new turns this case of mine would take. Holmes was sitting at the table before breakfast rifling through the correspondence in his dressing gown, and I was heartened to see that while he may have gone to bed at some ungodly hour he had still managed some measure of rest.
I watched him walk away until he disappeared around the corner and out of sight, not once turning back, before I set off on my own task. I went to the telegraph office before sending a short dispatch off to Macnair, ensuring his movements were where we wanted them:
“I hypothesize we may be able to divine some value then from their prescribed meanings, if our murderer also subscribes to this school of thought.” And he held up Mary’s book in his hands. How he had found it and remembered it among my possessions I do not know, but it hadn’t mattered then. He handed the book off to me, and I took it with care, mindful of its original owner - whatever its importance to the case may be.
“And look where that got him.” Holmes’ tone dropped into something that time and experience told me spoke of murkier waters.
“That is indeed interesting,” said Macnair, looking between the two of us consideringly. He tossed the gun onto the sofa, making Abbott jump. “There is a great deal of chance involved. How do you aim to play?”
It is not often that I dream when I sleep, but when I do they are of a vivid quality that is like accessing another plane of existence. This could be dire when my memories of the war and its aftermath intruded on them, but tonight they were kinder, and yet provided me with much to think about all the same.
Nevertheless, I was making some headway, when not even an hour after our visitor had first arrived I heard the door to the street open and shut, and footsteps on my stair. Not a second later, my bedroom door opened and Holmes burst in and abruptly dropped himself onto my bed.
Holmes set down the damp cloth that took away the last vestiges of his guise. “That is the precise problem at hand. I am loath to bring Macnair forth to the authorities on that specific charge, not the least because of how he may implicate us in his downfall, but also as I would hate to be made a hypocrite and allow him to be at the hands of a law that I believe fundamentally to be unjust. Willful murder is his crime, and it is for murder that he must be charged!”
“A pact, of sorts. You have said it yourself: I am not worthy of Watson, and that alone is reason for me to die tonight. However, what is your alternative? I doubt he will go with you now regardless of whether I meet my end here tonight, and while you have gone to great lengths to prove that he is irreplaceable it is evident that he is not, and that you are. So therefore, my suggestion is this. We leave it to fate’s hands, and both consume your poison.”
He did not answer me, instead at once kneeling again and resuming his careful inspection of the body, as if it might reveal any more clues to the man’s identity and purpose, or indeed to his friend’s.
He was speaking, of course, of how Macnair would no doubt be heading to resume his watch over Baker Street now that he had plans of his own for me, for that was the direction he had set off toward. “And how do you propose to do that, Holmes? Or did you also commission another waxwork bust when you returned to London last year?” I asked only half-jokingly, referring to the decoy of himself he had used in the capture of that villain Col. Sebastian Moran.
The shopkeeper went off to fulfill his order, leaving us alone for me to smile and say, “It is actions like this one that save her from throwing us out entirely.”
Lestrade’s ferret-like features widened slightly, but he did not miss a beat before informing the both of us that he had called in the murder and that his colleagues were waiting downstairs to be brought up, but after the body was collected he would tell us all that he had learned. He then left to do just that.
“I’m not sure how to break this to you without hurting your feelings, my dear Watson, though unfortunately I feel it is my duty to inform you. I believe the man we seek is none other than your lover, Douglas Macnair.”
I laughed, and gestured for him to sit with me. He had brought with him a round of drinks. “It has been quite some time, has it not?”
“Oh yes. You did not know him then, I would think, but before your becoming a member and evidently taking my place, Macnair had a reputation here for being rough and rather possessive, to the point of coming to blows on several occasions. His temper has cooled somewhat evidently, and many have believed him to have mellowed with age, but I can see that all it has done is distill that possessive streak further, and make him more volatile.”
“I am sorry, Abbott, but as I cannot do it myself and I see no other alternative - you are to act as our bait.”
He was in the same position that he had been for the last hour, sitting with his cherry pipe in his comfortable and worn mouse colored dressing gown, staring deeply into the fire in thought. Now though, his gaze was on me, and was a cross between expectant and realization.
“Oh? What can you tell me of this other customer? If he is anything like me and helplessly attempting to construct a bouquet for my rather fastidious beau that abides by this tricky language of flowers, I may take note of his other choices.” Holmes was laying it on rather thick I thought, but I admired his ability to know just how to make people more forthcoming with their information.
We walked out of the shop, the rain having come to a final stop, and the light still in Macnair’s window. The two of us stood nearby to a fairly soggy paperboy, Holmes still twirling the stem of the flower between his fingers when I asked him why he had done so.
Before we knew it, the florist was back, to show us a small sample of what the nosegay delivered to Baker Street would look like. It was made up wholly of blue violets, and it passed inspection. Holmes agreed and paid, but not before asking if he may take one flower from the bunch, which he did once he was allowed.
, has only brought him destruction. He had a shining career, a life ahead of him, and yet as a result of my bringing him into the fold he has now been corrupted with a felony charge, convinced to commit murder in my name! His trust in me has ruined him.”
“But Holmes, he-” I looked to Abbott, suddenly aware that he was still present and watching us argue about his involvement as if it were something more trivial than his life being at stake. I spoke to him instead, “Are you certain you wish to be a part of this, Mr. Abbott?”
The spot he’s kissed burned when I retrieved my hand, and the fire traveled up my arm and stole into my chest.
“Yes, it was all quite mysterious actually. He’d been coming less and less near the end of the decade, and Frank Longwood - did you ever meet him? He’s nearly engaged now, poor sod, remind me to tell you, it’s quite the rag, his mother has always been cheerfully insane but this took the cake - oh, where was I?”
He raised a hand, stopping my protests. I did not know what I would say anyway. He turned back to Macnair. “I have no way of stopping your actions through legal means, nor can I let you go however. So then may I ask, if you knew then that Watson would be leading you to me, why come at all?”
Disappointingly, Lestrade shook his head. “I do not, unfortunately. I can inquire, but not tonight - it’s much too late and I’m technically off-duty.”
And then came the horrible Professor and my carefully aligned world was upturned with the loss of the one person I held dear, the best and wisest man I ever knew. Mary did her best to help me through but for those next months I was largely inconsolable, and a shadow of the man I once was. When she too left me on this mortal plane and I was left finally alone, I suffered greatly. I fear I became unrecognizable to even myself. I threw myself into my practice and into working as a police surgeon, and at night did the very thing I had spent the last decade avoiding - seeking company of those of my own kind.
Vernet was a surname Holmes had used often as an alias, taken from his own grandmother, so it was undoubtedly him that Macnair was referring to. That was not the source of confusion. It was how he had known to refer to him as such that was the mystery.
John had somehow insinuated his hand between them, though the angle was awkward, and was gently stroking the head of Sherlock’s cock with three fingers. Sherlock whimpered breathlessly, goosebumps shivering electric across his skin, and he shifted down until his cock was pressing between John’s warm thighs. John naturally lifted his hip, his foot flat against the bed, and parted his legs so Sherlock could shift and roll, push forward into the soft skin of John’s bollocks.
On a rainy Sunday morning. I woke with your hands already on me, your mouth hot against my shoulder.
At this silent invitation. Sherlock ducked his head under the blankets and slithered down along John’s waist, lifted himself over John’s bent knee and settled himself between his legs. Sherlock nosed up along the inside of John's sleep sweaty thigh, inhaling the pungent musky tang that was purely John, unmuddied by soap or fabric softener. He must have fallen into bed without even washing. Arousal blossomed warm and tingling through his belly, shivering over his scalp, and his cock twitched, the scent receptors in his brain on overload from the sweet hit of John's pheromones. He shivered and rubbed his nose back and forth against the soft cotton folded in the crease of John's thigh.
across the back of an envelope and leaves it on the counter, just in case John wakes up before he gets back. If he gets back.
“More what? Say it, Sherlock. Tell me what you want.” John stroked him, thumb rubbing into his frenulum, sliding his foreskin up and back, watching as his testicles began drawing up. “Oh god you love this. Open your eyes, you filthy boy. Open your eyes and look at me, Sherlock.”
“John?” Lester snapped him out of his reverie. “I been thinking. What I really need to do is get rid of the hammer. I hid it in the wall downstairs, but they’ll find it soon, won’t they?”
Memories stir within Sherlock - memories of John watching him, with an amused half smile on his lips, the way his cheeks reddened and his lashes lowered when Sherlock caught him out; John standing proud and solid beside him at a crime scene, telling everyone to shove off so Sherlock can think, John with his head propped against his fist, researching at 2am, his red-rimmed sleepy eyes fixed on Sherlock. John
"It's just. You know." A flood of shame washes through him, but John catches his face and hold it, kisses him hard.
They wend through the dance floor, John tugging Sherlock by his fingertips, casting hungry glances over his shoulder every few feet. They make their way to the other side, and John yanks him down a dimly lit hallway, at the end of which is a closed door with a sign taped to it reading “No Entry.”
John's smile is slow and sweet, his eyes heavy lidded, as he tilts his head to the side and draws a fingertip over the pout of Sherlock's lower lip. So quiet Sherlock can barely hear him, "I know. I love you too."
"You keep saying that, but you don't know what I'm going to say." John pulled his hand out of Sherlock's gently, fingers trailing over Sherlock's, and laid it on his stomach. Black and bruised against the crisp white hospital sheets, clenching and unfurling over and again. “Okay, so. I...oh, fuck. This is really impossible to say. I can’t. I just.”
“You trust me?” John whispers against Sherlock’s ear, flicking his tongue ever so slightly into the whorl.
John nods, brow furrows. He doesn't make Sherlock say it aloud, which is unusually kind. “How about I go with you?”
“S’okay.” John turned to him with a wide smile, eyes bright indigo in the wan sunlight. He pointed over a small ridge ahead of them, which tumbled down into a shallow dale. “That’s Drumchapel Estate. Beautiful gardens, big old manor house. Some ruins of older buildings. Harry and I used hike the trails when we were kids. They wind all round Loch Fyne and up into the mountains. I
"There's my boy." John kisses the end of his nose, his chest constricted with affection, with love, with all the emotions that he's always tried so hard to control. He swallows. "You and I both need some liquids, and some calories. I'm going to go fix us a snack, alright? I'll be just in the kitchen if you need me."
His eyes widened, and in all this there still left some part of me that felt joy at finally succeeding in surprising the great detective.
Lestrade wished us well, before taking Abbott away in chains. The young man would stand trial, but with my testimony and the winning speech Holmes no doubt was already drafting in his brilliant mind now, he would be given some clemency and a smaller sentence over all. I gave him a smile as he left, before going to close the door behind them.
“Very well.” I retired any further objections. I already had reason to have recognized the keen excitement and curiosity in Abbott’s eyes.
Holmes’ eyes flashed. “There is a slim but real chance of surviving, if fate determines it so. Are you interested?”
We took a small break for luncheon at a restaurant on the same street corner with a vantage point from the window seating, for Holmes claimed they did remarkable things with oysters even as he ordered nothing but coffee, before resuming once again our surveillance of Macnair’s home. He had not left, and I was beginning to question what it was we were waiting to happen when a man knocked on his door to deliver a telegram.
“Yes. I had deduced all that I could from you in the six weeks that we had been acquainted and shared diggings, in addition to those three scant points, and yet it seemed something about you both eluded and intrigued me, no matter how much time I spent in your presence. I could tell that you were curious about me, and I you, so I thought by having you accompany me we could both satisfy ourselves.”
Holmes dismissed any thoughts of the kind. “Why should I reveal to her that what would be obvious, should she just have the patience to ask her to-be fiancé herself? For it is obvious to anyone who possesses some matter of critical thinking: they are letters from an old flame, likely a youthful first love, held onto years later for sentimental purposes.”
I could not let it stand, as he knew I would not be able to, judging by the light in his eyes. “Holmes, what is the meaning of all this?”
“Holmes,” and I paused to see if he would interrupt, as he was wont to do. He did not. I looked down at my hands, unsure how to word what I needed to say, before raising my head to face him. “There is something you may need to know about me in its relevance to this case, that I have had reason to withhold from you for the years of our acquaintance.”
Holmes himself had grown pale. I imagined that he was thinking as I was, of Professor Moriarty and his threats. As quickly as I’d noticed it however, the anxiety in his expression cleared, and he shook his head. “No, no. Nothing in the appearance of this message - for this man’s death is a clear message to Watson - has any mention or relevance to me, or our connection. It is intended to be directed only at you.”
And then he extended the flower to me. “I grow tired of holding this, Watson, and we still have much to do today. Would you hold onto this, or perhaps place it within your buttonhole?”
“Ah. Well, you have come to the right place, but I believe some explanation will be in order. Come in.”
At that Holmes’ brows furrowed and his gaze averted to the rug, to which he gave a glare. “Somehow it escaped even my notice. Perhaps I did not know to look, and did not think to. An enormous oversight on my part.” He looked back to me, and upon seeing my expression, the frown cleared. “All the same - I see no reason that this should change my regard for you in any way.”
I took a deep breath, closing my eyes. “I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, Holmes, but let me say this. Macnair was an idiot.”
“Besides, Johnny, you had to have known. I have been ever so obvious, after all. If only it weren’t for that small fact that I operated within the great shadow that is your real love.”
There were voices in hushed tones outside in the hallway, and from what I had been able to make out it was Inspector Lestrade, back again with news. Out of my eagerness, I exited Holmes’ bedroom at once, rushing to greet him and discover what he learned and could tell us of this other, similar murder. Especially in this case, I was determined not to miss a single detail. Holmes was with him, having opened the door for him, and I bid him good morning as well before focusing my attentions.
I nodded gamely. “If London and the world merely had the good sense to follow in our example, then their affairs would proceed much smoother.”
Unaware as we were of what was to come, that evening had begun in high spirits, as just that morning we had returned triumphant back to London after solving some case in the countryside that I have recorded elsewhere. To celebrate we had gone first to Mancini’s, “
“It occurred to me early this morning, Watson, that I had been neglecting to reorganize and declutter my records for quite some time now, and thus in this negligence I have allowed them to fall into an inexcusable state of disrepair. As I have recently relieved myself of a case and there is no question of going outdoors today I felt it was as fit a time as any to rectify this mistake. It’s an ample opportunity to refamiliarise myself with all that I need to know in order to keep my profession.”
I smiled, and pressed a kiss to his hand as he had mine that night and in my dream. He lifted his other to cup my face. “Watson,” he did not seem to be capable of saying more, but I knew his intention, and I leaned into his touch. It was a new experience, to feel the calluses of his much admired hands so tenderly on my person as he held me as if I were something to be treasured. There was not anything like it.
Putting aside the lengthy but largely unextraordinary record of a F. Vogel, I then picked up the next form only to see to my surprise my own name. Before me was my own file, that before now I hadn’t known existed.
My eyes sought out Holmes, spotting him finally near the bar. I found my way to a booth in the back while he was distracted, so as to afford me a clear view of the room at large and avoid detection, hoping he would not see me too soon and endanger us both somehow.
As I took him all of him in his grin took on a lazier outfit, his eyes dropping almost salaciously, “Come here often, darling?”
The woman’s expression lit up with some surprise, “You know, sir, as you are not the first of our customers to favor that flower, somewhat rare as it can be, we happen to have quite a good deal of it in stock. It is of a good significance - faithfulness and dedication.”
I had turned wordlessly to Holmes, who was in quiet contemplation, staring intently at the file in my hand likely having deduced whose it was. “That record has not been updated in quite some time - not since the month of our first acquaintance I should think.” He cleared his throat. “I penned it with the viewpoint of you as a prospective fellow lodger rather than a friend or anything else.”
When I arrived Archie let me through with minimal fuss, and I found Macnair at the bar of the main room, in conversation with a thankfully still alive Abbott, who greeted me with relief and gratitude in his eyes. He had held his own against a man that he knew intended to murder him for use as a pawn, and for that he had my utmost respect. Macnair’s bouquet of flowers were laid on the bar in front of them, his bag from the chemist hidden, and I was glad I had arrived in time to relieve him of his post. Macnair’s eyes immediately went to the flower in my buttonhole, and I cursed my oversight but was relieved to see he made no mention of it.
He smiled then, one that did not quite reach his eyes and made him appear almost saddened, “I confess, Watson, that I quickly came to realize that infinite time in your presence would not satisfy me.”
“But what of that note found on the body identified to be Frank Longwood, who died here in your sitting room? How does this connect to Dr. Watson?” Lestrade asked.
When I did chance a look up minutes later, Holmes made eye contact with me, and smiled in a fashion made familiar to me in instances such as when a policeman had said something particularly stupid about his methods, or a client said something that was obvious only to us. That smile spoke to me of our own world that existed completely away from the rest of existence, and to see it now in this instance enlivened me. I hesitated only a moment before returning the smile and joining him.
“We may have engaged in some,” I hesitated, “harmless flirtation, here and there, and I will admit that over the months we developed a closeness that means he was privy to many of my secrets by way of- dear God.”
As it happened, I was growing rather tired of leaving things unsaid. This whole business had been borne out of unsaid feelings: Macnair’s decision to bide his time in telling me rather than give me an opportunity to reject him outright, but also in my own behavior, when I continued cowardly locking up my feelings and only carefully dispensing word of them, only for the dam to burst when I had believed him to be dead and incapable of ever hearing me, speaking those feelings to the first person who would listen. And when Holmes returned and I found it in me to forgive him, I had still been too scared to damage the balance between us, and to give him a reason to step away. I was still torn about what I had deduced of his own feelings toward me, but this case had given me evidence and drive enough to know that it was best if I bit the bullet as it were, because I was apparently even luckier than I knew.
I said nothing, but looked to Holmes, whose face was dangerously impassive with his eyes unmoving off of Macnair.
I walked the short distance to him, and pulled him closer by way of reaching for his hand. “Why, Holmes, I have been in love with you since the moment we first met, and have scarcely stopped since! Of course I do!” I entangled our fingers and he allowed me, his eyes never leaving mine, “I cannot begin to explain how you make me feel, for it is an experience beyond description. It is powerful enough for me to weather anything, even grief, for being at your side is something I have found to cure all wounds. You spoke of luminescence once, and indeed you are a shining light in a world of darkness, and time after time you have brought me back to life with your mere presence and energy. It is inconceivable for me to picture not loving you, Holmes.”
“Our client was one Miss Dorothy Finnegan, who engaged me about an inquiry regarding the man she has been courting. For you see, Watson, your fanciful stories of my being a knight to damsels in distress have caused her to believe that I am an adequate sounding board rather than her inamorato himself.”
Macnair’s eyes went to the flowers in the other man’s hand, seeming as if he’d forgotten them completely. “Funny that! Thank you, lad.” He took them gently but reluctantly off of Abbott, before raising his gaze to me, almost searchingly.
It was evident now to my eyes, judging by the mounds of evidence given to me today that pointed to the direction, not to mention his clear lack of need to defend himself from this assumption after the events of the Club. Holmes shared the same proclivities that I did, of being an invert. This had escaped my notice likely in the same way I had eluded him, but as I thought of how he spoke of the law’s feelings on the matter and his fairly easy acceptance of me, it began to take shape and I remembered several instances in our years together that benefited from this realization. To think we escaped each other’s notice for so long, and yet our business was detection!
Holmes nodded. “There was some confusion at first in the relation of this case to Watson, an error in my own judgement, but we soon straightened it out and traced it back to Abbott instead.”
Although this new information thrilled me - for now I could be freer in my home and in my friendship with him than I had hardly ever imagined to be before - it did not mean however that I could be optimistic, and could hope for him to return my feelings. His having the same bent that I did had no bearing on whether he would want engage in anything with anyone, celibate as he had presumably been these years, and let alone with me, who was his oldest platonic friend. It would not do to consider it or to dwell on it, and I only hoped that whatever he gleaned from my
I looked up from my manuscript then. “I do not know, Holmes. Does this have something to do with this morning’s client?”
“Holmes! But she was only coming to you for help! What could the letters mean, who are these mysterious figures, Alberta and Victor?” In my - admittedly as fanciful as he suggested - fantasies, this client had unwittingly found evidence of some espionage, with false identities and secret pasts.
“Mr. Holmes, I was just coming to offer you both a late lunch but upon seeing the state of these rooms I am more than disinclined to do so!”
Holmes raised one fine eyebrow. “Oh? Then we shall not turn them away either! Come Watson, it seems there is yet more excitement in store for us this evening.”
“No, that won’t be necessary, Lestrade. Certain details are emerging that are making this case quite easier to understand now. I think actually we will be able to manage on our own from here - we are yet safe within these walls.”
I stared at him, stunned. “Holmes…” My speech stopped there, as I did not know what else to say. I was still firm in my position but an emotional outburst like this was rare, and I was shocked to see how strongly he felt about the subject.
I did not look away. “Faithfulness and consistency as you said, but mostly of course, it is rather pretty.”
He made a noise like a scoff, staring resolutely through the window and not at me. “It is your business, Watson, and not mine to pry.”
For months I had perceived Holmes and I at being at a sort of precipice, with something further unsaid since his return from the dead and my subsequent forgiveness for his deception. I had no idea of what it was but believed us to be circling towards it regardless in our own time, unhurried. And yet tonight with those words having left my lips I felt that I had expedited our discovery immeasurably.
"And when you attempt to engage me in conversation on the occasions that I would prefer to sit in silence, do I not inform you? So that we may both avoid any unsaid but keenly felt anger?”
“Yes, and as such I may have already ushered you into some danger. Therefore it is my responsibility to escort you clear of it.”
“Yes, I believe so. There was some trouble identifying them, especially as sadly there just isn’t that sort of time given to some of these mysterious deaths of poorer folk - but from the report and some nudging, Gregson identified them to be the same three.”
I nodded, still unmoving, remembering a similar list I had made in the same period. My list of his limits had been much longer however, I noted with some dispiritedness, though he did say I was adept at flattery.
Holmes simply gave me a smile that I could not begin to understand, and marched to his room, picking up his Stravidius as he went. “You will see.” And then he closed the door with the scraping of his violin sounding behind it, leaving me to wonder if the past 24 hours were some strange dream.
“Of course. Would the either of you gentlemen be interested in making a purchase yourselves, sirs?” The florist asked keenly, and I could see that while she was attempting to hide her disgruntlement at being questioned, we had reached the end of our time with her.
He clapped his hands to my shoulders. “But there is nothing one can do about it at the moment, and I assure you, even as it may not seem so, Baker Street is still safe enough for you to get some rest tonight, Doctor. I will make sure of it.”
Still, he rallied his troops as we sat before him, scared and witless. “Go home, Lestrade, and first thing tomorrow notify the proper channels of the situation, though be as discreet as you can, even among your colleagues. We cannot risk word of this getting out just yet, but a coroner’s opinion is needed, and his mother ought to be found so as to bury her son. Make what inquiries you can about this other John Doe you mentioned, and report back to us here as soon as you can. There is a chance this business has been going on longer than it took for us to take notice.”
.” Out of his coat pocket he pulled the vial we had seen him purchase from the chemist, appearing now unconcerned with keeping his true nature hidden.
Speaking to Macnair now knowing all the things he had done was like seeing a completely new man. His appearance had not changed at all from the previous night, but it was in the little details that he now seemed changed, as his every action took new meaning so as to seem more vile and menacing. The way he immediately aimed to gain physical proximity from me, regardless of my comfort; his constant watch of reaction to his words; or his catalogue of everything I had ever revealed to him, regurgitated to me like proof. All these now were seen in a different light and seemed to be tinged with his sinister claim on me, and I both felt disgusted and mournful that I had considered him a close friend. I realized then that he did not know me, but merely my specific traumas, and had confused them to be one and the same.
Lestrade glanced at me hesitantly, though I could not tell if it was unconsciously done or not. “Similar to the man you found last night, sir, short light brown hair, neat moustache, typically of average height and athletic or square build, although yours was slightly taller. And I can’t describe it, really, but something about the ears as well, seemed reminiscent of...” He trailed off, and looked determinedly instead at the curtains.
“Judging by the hairs still remaining on his collar and dress, his facial hair has recently been cut down to a familiar style - within the man’s last few hours.” Holmes noted, his voice unexpectedly quiet and in a much graver register. His change in tone made me look closer, and I observed then that the man’s moustache looked almost exact to my own. This information on its own should mean little - mine was of a rather common style - and yet the tone in which Holmes brought this to my attention told me all I needed to know of its grim quality.
While I usually accompany Holmes on his meetings with clients, especially nowadays as his business has become so much my own, there are still the occasions where he accepts visitations alone. Often this is the case when Holmes believes he is able to solve their problems without leaving the sitting room, and he does not require my services. Privately, I have used this to confirm my pet theory that he frequently chooses cases that will be as guaranteed to amuse me as they will himself.
I shrugged, growing tired of this topic, but trying my best not to show it. Macnair had been privy to many of the details of how I had missed Holmes, and this prying was him merely checking in with me in a probably purposefully light tone. I ought to be grateful. “Well then I am sorry to disappoint you. Truly though, I know all about my own exploits, how are you, old chap?”
He waved a hand as if it were nothing. “No need, old boy.” - and to think, after all this I could still be
An image now crumbled, I was sure, as I told him all this, barring the secrets my wife had died with, and the pieces that put together my affectionate regard for him. I was sure they were readily obvious, especially to his mind, and yet I did not believe I could part with that secret until I absolutely must. Everything else I lay bare, feeling as if I had just pulled down the walls and coverings I had built above my heart these long years.
I had no choice but to put my anger aside and tell him. His eyebrows raised when I told him the name of the club but he otherwise said nothing. As I did my best to remember the names and aliases of men I had not associated with in almost a year, I considered him, his calculating expression of committing the names to memory breaking the façade of the disguise. The emotions that had been written on his face during his outburst not even a minute prior, however, had been wiped clean as if they hadn’t existed in the first place. And yet in my mind’s eye I could still see the anxiety, backed by something even larger that I was not able to decipher.
Holmes had looked up at me in a way that made it worth it however, as if me agreeing to comb through old cases were surmountable to being a gallant knight. “That would be a wondrous help, old boy.”
“I do wish.” I repeated, confirming. We stared at each other as if waiting for the other to back down - which I knew was a formidable task as both of us could be likened to oxen on a good day - when the bell rang downstairs.
Instead what I saw was - papers, everywhere. The room was dark even for the early hour due to the clouds, but from what light the lamps and the fire provided it seemed every inch of the room had been covered by stacks of papers. This had not been the case when I bid my friend goodnight.
The carriage ride passed quickly, as I was deep in my thoughts while also trying to appear nonchalant to my company, who passed idle conversation between the two of them, more gossip from the sounds of it. Macnair kept glancing at me when he thought I wasn’t noticing, and all I could do was give him my most unaffected and reassuring smile, even as I felt affected and the furthest thing from reassured. Indeed, I did not feel I would be until Holmes was once again in sight and by my side.
