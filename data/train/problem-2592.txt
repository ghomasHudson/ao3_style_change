On their way back to the sitting room from the kitchen, John took a moment to appreciate the enormity of the house. "Very nice place, very nice. Who lives here, Mary?" He asked. As Mary sipped from a clear glass of white wine, he noticed she had on shiny blue lipstick. Not one to pay attention to shades of lipstick, he couldn't recall her wearing a shade like that before.
I was the poster child for 'The Riot of Fresher's Week'. Thanks loads for that.
"Can I talk to you? she asked in a small voice.
“And I don’t know why you don’t. I just don’t want any more trouble. For you or me.”
John remembers that Christmas eve, the church service, the walk home and the first time he kissed Sherlock Holmes in a snow bank, right after he pelted him with a snowball.
"...and how stupid."
He whispered my name. I looked up at him, his pupils large, beads of sweat crossing his brow.
Mary laughed and leaned forward. "John,
“No, Mrs. Hudson, I’m fine.”  Sherlock mumbled into the pillow.
"What?"
Sherlock was laying in his bed watching the shadows play on the walls of his bedroom. He would not sleep tonight.  Not after what happened in the sitting room.  John Watson, calm, intelligent John, had set his imagination on fire. Not to mention his lips. He put his finger to his lips and couldn’t believe John’s lips had just been there.
“Well, that is quite a trek, no wonder you are tired.” Sherlock responds, absentmindedly.  “Are you ready to go to Devon today? Mycroft has someone he wants everyone to meet. A dried up old colleague, no doubt.”
“Baker Street--221 B.” Sherlock called as he jogged out the door.
"Yeah," he said. "Thought he'd be upset, you know?--about the break up." he laughed, "But he wasn't, he said he felt good about it. Settled."
"Address?"
As he looks around, John realizes that guests are arriving for the Holmes family annual holiday party. Lots and lots of guests. John thinks back to the first year that he and Sherlock had been flatmates. Sherlock had recently been discharged from hospital right before Christmas. Sherlock recovering from being injured during a very difficult case. That Christmas had been very quiet, there was no party at the Holmes estate that year. That had been a very special Christmas to John, as he first realized what he felt for Sherlock. Looking back, he was again glad there has been no bloody holiday party, getting his mind around his new relationship with Sherlock as difficult enough, he didn’t need extended family to negotiate.
Sherlock was surprised. Who was Jim Moriarty's father? Would Mycroft know? They slipped inside after Jim was recognized by the bouncer at the door. No one asked Sherlock for his ID. Even though he was of age, he was asked to show his ID often, because even though he was very tall, he was slim and looked very young. He tried not to look surprised, but took it in stride.
Mary sat down next to me.
Sherlock didn't move and he didn't answer. He only looked down at John’s finger slowly moving along the back of his hand to his wrist. Then John curved his finger a little to fit inside the cuff of Sherlock's  sleeve. John took another step even closer and was now toe to toe with Sherlock. They were about a hair's breadth apart. Sherlock could hear John breathing.
The footballers were a rowdy bunch and appeared to like John alot.
“Go on now, you both can go. We can get a statement from you two in the morning.” Lestrade smiling, waved them both away.
John turned to him, frowning. "Was that another policeman, Sherlock? Do you know all the policemen?"
I laughed  and grabbed the menu to look, "Biscuits and beer? You sound like...."
John overhears Mycroft and his wife discussing plans to fly to the US, as she is going back to Harvard for a semester, to be a guest lecturer on dead languages.
Maybe I'll make it into a profession.
“It's either him or I sir." The professor stood, his story over.
Sherlock thought.
or something.
Believing that this wasn't just some pleasant fantasy that I had cooked up in my addled brain. It might just be real.
“Never said you were.” Sherlock looked into John’s eyes, serious.
Once there, they locked the bedroom door, "See? Two doors, no one to bother us." John gently reassured Sherlock.
"I'm not! That's not the point!! Why would I even show this to you? If I was going to do it---I'd have kept it quiet and not have told you!" His face was dark, his brow furrowed and it looked for a minute like his bottom lip was trembling but I know that's not true, this is Sherlock after all.
We're taking our time now, no alcohol, no headaches, no hurry. My bed is big, my sheets are soft, my duvet crumpled at the end of the bed.
The Dove and Eagle Pub was crowded and loud. They found a booth in the back when another group was leaving. Sherlock sprung for the first round of pints and was halfway done with his beer, when he looked up to see Jim Moriarty at the next table.   Mary sat next to him, sending glaring looks Sherlock's way.
Epilogue
"We could just sleep." I offered.
Mycroft was likely notified, good thing MI6 didn't break John's door down.
I walked over to the door and opened it. Molly stood there, handkerchief in hand, eyes red.
"Sherlock, where is your coat, you must've been freezing.?" John asked.
With no alternative, I made my way down the hallway, sidestepping the balls, cricket bats and cricketers that littered the corridor.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The week had been slow, the weather bad, cold freezing drizzle making venturing outside a chore. I sat in front of the fire, shoes off, dressing gown on, reading a dry scientific journal-dry even for me.
"Last night.  At the pub. In the loo." Sherlock now looked away from me, at the wall.
Silence.
Mycroft interrupted my reverie.
I have to forget about John, but it's not easy.
What if he wants to go out or he disappears? What if l lose him? This is a stupid idea.
As John lifted his glass to his lips, the door of the pub opened with a gust, and there in the doorway stood Sherlock. He was alone.
I thought maybe he was just not interested in people, but there he was, walking towards me, maybe I did have a chance. I just didn't want to be stupid about this. I wondered if he knew how I felt.  How much I felt for him, so early, it scared me. I hoped it wasn't written all over my face, or if others can see. I'm going to try to be cooler maybe. Calmer.
Sherlock spoke slowly and measured his words. “Because when they are out of their depth they consult…me.”
As a matter of fact, that was my picture on the front of the paper,
The boys turned to go. Sherlock realized John still had the shock blanket on and grabbing it off of his shoulders, tossed it directly into the window of the black car.
“Well you, of all people know why I’m here, to make connections. You know some of those footballers have families made of money and of course those are the only people I like to hang out with. Can’t say the same about you, though.” Jim raised his eyebrows.
The next weeks went by in a blur. Sherlock was in hospital for two full weeks recovering. I couldn't see him the 48 hours they had him in intensive care for the overdose and hypothermia. Mycroft kept me informed.  After that, he got a raging fever and the doctors told us he had pneumonia.
His girlfriend was irate about last night, his ‘violent’ behavior and the fact that he ran out of the pub, leaving her.
This elicited a shocked look from John, who laughed brightly, “...and we both know that isn’t true.”
For a Wednesday, the pub was crowded.
I tried to search his eyes in the darkness, They glinted slightly in the light from the windows. "I don't know what I'm doing." I whispered.
he insists. I love his laugh.
"Not if your doing as badly as I am." Ok, now I was feeling sorry for myself. So far a running theme of my first term at uni.
Mike and John chatted, Mike unpacked.
"Well, I'm not going to argue with that--but you are impatient." With a crooked smile, John looked right in Sherlock's eyes, leaned in and kissed him on his very soft lips.
"Right, sorry about that one."
Again John looked at him, burst into laughter and let Sherlock help him up off the kerb.
Lightly, then a bit harder.
The queue outside looked a mile long. We got some stares when we got in ahead of everyone else.
"You were thinking about this all night."
I opened the door of John's room wider, so I could leave. Right outside the door, standing next to Mary, was Molly.
I put the mug on the floor and looped my right arm around his. I reached my left hand to touch the side of his face and kissed him.
"I expect so. As soon as you call off your interrogation.
"What is it with Jim Moriarty at all?  John--I think he's following me," he swallowed hard,
"He is," John said quietly.
"I want to figure it out."
Before Sherlock could turn and take a breath, Irene Adler was at his side. "I'm surprised to see you, darling. However did he get you to come?"" she purred in his ear, her white teeth shining in the dark. She helped him slip off his coat. Irene was dressed to the nines and looked right at home at this fancy club, with her tight dress and high heeled shoes.
“Sometimes he talks a lot,” she said pouting, turning to speak to Mike. A few minutes later, they heard the soft strains of Sherlock's violin through the door of his bedroom.
he pointed to the girl and raised his eyebrows. "Client."
While Mike and John regaled the girls with the story of the daring escape, Molly kept trying to steal a look at Sherlock without anyone noticing. He was in the kitchen, staring into his microscope. Molly was smiling and nodding but found it difficult to follow the questions that Mary was asking. As she sat there, Molly started to sweat, trying to think of a way to get Sherlock into the conversation so she should talk to him.
"No need, John. No need."
He'd better get out of here before Jim came in looking for him. That could be awkward.
Victor's father was working with a network of international drug smugglers to bring drugs into Britain. Turns out, Mycroft doesn't know everything.
happy to be home. Don't be mad at me, John." Sherlock's hands were now feeling his way up John's hard muscled back and moving, moving up to his chest and then down to his stomach again, hands so warm and strong and determined. All the while, he was kissing along the edge of John's neck and rocking himself against John's backside. Lightly, then a bit harder.
he arrived in a helicopter to whisk me away.  By the time Mycroft arrived and they let me up, both Victor and his father were gone. Taken away.
I stood up and followed her to the door, feeling like a heel. "Sorry Molly."
"Mary I..."
John followed Mycroft down the steps and out into the cold. The street was quiet, dusted with a light snow. Snow that was sure to be gone by morning.
I know I'm doing too much cocaine when I clench my jaw. It's unnerving, annoying and painful.  The music from the pub is blasting through the closed door of the gaming room. The base is loud. I can feel the music pounding in my chest cavity. My heart's fast. My face is flushed. I'm jittery. And ecstatic.
"Here? Tonight?" his voice, usually so deep and resonant, is soft and low. He steps closer to me. His shoulder slides down a bit as he leans on the door. We're almost the same height this way.
He was sitting next to me, smiling. He leaned in to talk to me. "So, how do you do it?" he asked with a conspiratorial whisper. He looked at me, right into my eyes. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. His eyes were a clear blue and pupils were very large. I could see a band of sweat across his brow.
The Offices of the Head of Sciences Department were warm and inviting. No one should be intimidated by the dark wood paneling and soft, posh rugs. When coming in to discuss a problem or job issue, anyone would feel welcome.
“John, do you need help to bed?” Sherlock stood beside the sofa, having already taken his shirt off.
he mused out loud. "--middle aged uni professor, good job, a wife and a mistress."
He dodged John as Stamford stood in the doorway horrified.
“Uhh…No, just settling in, getting ready for the new term.” He said to no one in particular, smiling and pitching in, and setting out some cups and crisps before the guests arrived.
More so when it's free.
John was nodding, “I am, I am sorry, very sorry, but I had to go help Sherlock… so--I’m sorry.” He shrugged and put both of his hands up.  He was swaying just a little.
“Something?” Sherlock shook John slightly by the shoulder, jogging him to explain before he fell asleep and the observation was lost.
Sherlock felt bad, but only a little. He backed off. Still smiling despite his disappointment, he whispered, “Good night, John Watson.”
“Well you and
"No, actually." I looked up at her and sat back in the chair.
"Thinking...
John immediately took off running towards Sherlock, while Mycroft looked helplessly on.
I felt bad leaving Sherlock, but he refused to come.
I saw a dark mark on the side of his neck, near his collarbone. I hadn't seen anything there before.
Just there.
“We’ll get out here, mum.” Mike said excitedly, sitting forward, seat belt straining.
read the headlines.
Sherlock peeked out under his heavy dark lashes and looked at her skeptically. "How could you tell?"
I did see him on the one night that I accepted an offer to go to the pub with Seb and people from my floor, whose names I don't know.  I saw him before he saw me. I was halfway to pissed and couldn't feel my toes. I don't know how much alcohol I had that night, but I had been drinking pretty heavily. He was sitting with Mary. She always had her eye on him, I know. I wanted to go right on up to him and ask him to talk to me.  He looked happy, I thought, sitting there with Mary. That is, until he saw me--then he looked angry. John's pretty frightening when he's angry and not afraid to confront or hit someone in public. I've seen it.
This truly has been a terrible year. I think we all deserve something sweet.
He smiled tightly, lifted his hand in answering greeting. He watched as she spoke to one of the nearest officers, who lifted the tape and let her through.
It was, he thought, what John had done to him. Sliced and sawed through his armor, turned him inside out, left him unzipped and exposed, raw and ruined. The pitiable, pathetic soft core of him spilled out for all the world to see.
"Yes."
"Sherlock," John says. His shoulders are hunched against the wind. "Mary and I talked last night. After."
He tore his eyes away from Sherlock, looked at Janine. She smiled, took a sip of her champagne. Her ring sparkled.
"No promises," Pete said with a cheeky little wink. Bold of him, John thought, given the circumstances.
She grinned when she saw him, let out a happy little squeal. In her enthusiasm she overbalanced, sat down hard on her rear.
John waited in the sitting room, listening to the shower gurgle. He'd changed into his suit, was careful not to crease the fine fabric.
John shook his head, kissed him again. Shivered as Sherlock's hands skated up under his shirt, ghosted across his skin.
And it might be a trick of the light, or he might simply be losing his mind, but, no—that
"John's not the only man in the world, you know," she said.
The incredibly talented Khorazir has made
It was a gentle kiss, soft but determined, no hesitation or uncertainty.
"I'm not offering out of pity," Sherlock said, speaking quickly, probing, seeking the source of John's discomfort. "Or out of obligation, or atonement, or because of a vow that I made at your wedding. Though I'm still not entirely clear on the purpose of vows if people just see fit to disregard them—"
Silence stretched between them.
Rosie sat in one of the wooden chairs at the little desk, leaning back a bit, rocking the chair on two legs. She'd folded her arms across her chest, watched him with a pensive expression.
"Getting something to eat," Wiggins said. He had his coat on, was standing over near the door. His coat had worn thin around the elbows. The hem was frayed. "You want anything?"
Hearing the word “elves” was sufficient thank you. You would think that one entanglement with the living machine and a peek into the other world would be enough for one consulting detective and one medical doctor, but apparently not. Though Gregson wondered why he was even surprised by the antics of his long time associates? Between them the sheer amount of varied mischief they could end up was a astonishing (and occasionally fun, but Gregson would deny that for eternity).
Holmes rolled his eyes. “Oh it’s
"There does seem to be some connection," agreed Holmes.
paper cut outs of the most infamous criminals.”
“Come,” Sherlock touched my wrist, entrapping me with his slender and delicate fingers. The pale digits against my still tanned skin always made me shudder in happiness, as did the sensation of the calloused fingers. I couldn’t help placing my large hand over them and smiling up at the pale flush in Sherlock’s cheeks.
Long minutes passed and Rose began to have difficulties. It was pointless to speak over the wind so Gregson resorted to keeping one hand on the side of Rose’s neck. A comforting gesture for them both.
Rose neighed softly.
Walking the plank was
My incorrigible detective had removed a stunning glass ornament, beauty in its delicate lines and fragile nature. Silver colouring brought life to the decoration, creating shading and highlights as appropriate.
In Mycroft’s case, well Watson would practice “guilty until proven innocent”, which was unfair only until you met the man and had all sorts of shady people popping up in your life - or admittedly, as they had: dropping into the lives of disreputable people, such as their pirates.
Breakfast was cleared and my personal madman was grinning at me, grey eyes warm with purpose.
"I am sure this is all a mistake gentlemen!"
The smirk I received had me move quickly. I limped to the sitting room, glad that a massage would assuage the limb. Once by our tree I checked to ensure that none of the lit candles would fall.
“Oh, they all work!” he crowed in delight, and I elected to be afraid of the
Mind made up; Watson decided to live up to his epithet of "Man of Action".
Thankfully, only five minutes later, when the thread was thicker and the sensation stronger, Gregson saw light of human origin. A cry emerged – faint and dashed away by the wind, but still heard before it died.
“Of course my dear Watson! And that story you mentioned to me…A Christmas Carol or some such?”
"Ghosts or time slipping? Oh Watson, if only I had time to ask questions. Did you have to throw your punch - as admirable as it was - so soon?"
Waving away the concern of the stable master, Gregson secured his sparse luggage of one bag to the bridle and mounted. Rose whined in recognition and with a chuckle and a pat Gregson was on his way.
John shuts his eyes for a moment, rocks as if he's been struck.
He'd spent years thinking that Sherlock had never said anything in return.
"Don't make me say it," Sherlock said. He did not open his eyes.
"Things?" John asked faintly. "What things?"
"Life outside the city is rarely boring, John," Sherlock said. He scooted to the edge of his chair. "Oh, rural locations may
The rescue team—and, presumably, their embedded assassin, if such a person truly existed—would arrive to find Sherlock's hiding place deserted.
"Because there will always be a need for a consulting detective. And I'm the only one in the world."
"For fuck's sake,
He opened his eyes, cotton-mouthed and gasping on the floor. His limbs were leaden, slow to respond.
Sherlock pulled back ever-so-slightly, his breath warm and damp against John's mouth.
"Get up," Sherlock said.
"Yeah. Yes. That seems like the—yes. Let's do that." John reached for the doorknob, gave it a desperate twist. It remained stuck. "Only—"
He stood, put his phone back in his pocket.
"I find myself in need of a flatmate," Sherlock cuts in. It is not what he had intended to say. Yet once the words are out, he finds he has no interest in calling them back.
"She was going to throw it away, but—well—she got a better look at it and thought it was a little strange, yeah? And then she cleaned it up, and thought it was
Past the update about Reginald's death. Back through her livelier posts in ALL CAPS, the rambling high-energy rants that went into far too much detail. Photos from her hen night, Jennie all done up and beaming in group shots with several other women in a crowded pub. Dancing—poorly, going by her posture and the expression on her face (captured in the throes of an embarrassed laugh)—amidst a crowd on a packed dance floor. Holding up a pink drink and laughing in front of a neon pink bar sign.
John clears his throat and looks down briefly, then looks directly into his eyes. He speaks gently, "Sherlock, if Jim Moriarty--if anyone--would hurt you,
I put the article down. Hot tea would have been more welcome, but I accepted the glass. "Thanks." He was acting oddly, I thought, agitated. He sat down in his chair, coat off now, holding a drink himself. His eyes were shiny in the low light of our flat, it's always pretty dim in here. As I looked at the way he slumped in the chair, I doubted he needed any more to drink.
John jumped up and stood at the side of the bed, hand on his forehead. He couldn't look Sherlock in the eye. "Christ!-I should call my mum and let her know I arrived at school ok. Let’s come up with a plan for after I get some things done, ok?"
“And what?” John asked, truly bewildered.
"I do know how to drive, John. Living in London hasn't made me completely useless."
Shit. This is like
John smiled shyly at Sherlock, his bright white teeth in contrast to the slight tan he got over the summer. Even his blond hair was sunkissed. He looked like he could be been a lifeguard on a UK beach.
Mary stood there, listening quietly, expecting, waiting for more.
I've lost the impetus to visit the uni library or the coffee shop. I barely go to class. I'll soon hear from Mycroft, no doubt.
So, he had something there. I should've listened to him then, too.
She whispered, "John---
I'm glad Sherlock decided to come along. I'm not sure he eats really, so when I'm with him I try to offer him food. The pub has chips. I know he'll eat chips.
“Hello dear, can I help you?” She asked with a smile.
Frantically trying to assess just the amount of danger he was facing he balled his hands into fists and took an almost blind swing, but Sherlock ducked just in time.
"I think I'll have this 'stack of biscuits' with chocolate, caramel and cream." she said smiling up at me over the menu.
Sherlock was on his own, obviously and John soon lost him in the crowd.
"Hi Irene, can I help you? John smiled.
Immediately, they are back out in the street.  This time, they are in front of 221 Baker Street.
"I didn't know Mycroft had an MG. I never see it. He never brings it 'round." Sherlock mused, mostly to himself.
John stopped in his tracks. The anger on his face changed to sorrow. His eyes were empty.
idea.  My body betrays me as my right hand falls to the top of his thigh and feel the hard muscle of his leg.  I reach up to grab his jersey, shake my head and break us apart, panting a little, "John, you've been drinking, I'm sure..that..."
Harry got up smirking, raising her eyebrows at her brother and put her dish in the sink.
I couldn't pay attention the first time. The alcohol and shock of what was happening dulled my senses.
Flying down the steps, Sherlock ran out to the street. The sun was setting. In a few blocks he was at Tesco’s, where he could get what he wanted. In ten minutes, he was at university and in another five he was inside the locked university building.
"You should tell that to John." I glanced around. I doubted that there was another way out of the loo.
"Well," Sherlock began, but was uncharacteristically unable to finish, as she guided him to a plush, curved booth and they sat down.
Watching him walk towards me, his long legs bringing him ever closer, Sherlock looked like he belonged in London. Dark coat, dark jeans and blue tartan scarf 'round his neck, that was thankfully covering what I knew was a bruise--left side, right near his collar bone.
"What—?" John says, pulling back a bit, feeling dazed, drunk. He can hear Rosie roughhousing with Buc in the kitchen, shrill giggles, the clack of dog nails against the lino.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Well. You had hours at Sherrinford after we left. What did you accomplish?”
In the kitchen, there was a clatter as Rosie threw her spoon across the room. John shut his eyes, pinched his brow. He'd hoped that a good night's sleep would have put her in better spirits, but she seemed determined to remain balanced on the edge of a tantrum.
as John remembered.
John looked back at the cakes. Red velvet. Lemon. Bloody wedding white. It was all getting to be a bit predictable, really.
"Let's—" John said, leaning back, shutting his eyes as Sherlock chased his mouth. He put a gentle hand on Sherlock's chest, pushed lightly. "We should—"
Sherlock stops, blinks at them.
"Tackle a scrawny junkie in an empty shop? I think you're giving me a bit too much credit—"
He'd been trapped and miserable in his job, but it had never been Sarah's fault. He should have been honest enough with himself to walk away, years ago.
He thought he could just make out Sherlock amidst the shadows, watching them go.
John's smile fades as the words appear on the screen:
Sherlock stops, turns around. Steps closer to John, draws himself up to his full height. It is an effective distraction tool, sometimes, when he does this. People find it intimidating. Off-putting. "Am I what?"
"You two have fun," she said, and then she was gone.
There had been something—
It wasn't worth it. Nothing was worth this. He'd—he'd ruined whatever chance there had been at making things right between them. He'd put Sherlock in the hospital, and then he'd cut and run instead of facing what he'd done.
"Someone knows."
"This," John said. He used his other hand to gesture between them. Blood roared in his ears. "This? This is what you—?"
If Mary noticed his preoccupation, she did not mention it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Yes, but that was hours ago."
"Dog," she says, squirming a bit in his arms, craning to look over his shoulder.
"I assume, by now, that Dr Watson is aware that it was his wife who put you in hospital?"
"Just—saucy little messages. Late at night. During my breaks at work. Nothing too—I wasn't actually—" John shifted, uncomfortable, looked away. He was not quite able to bear the weight of Sherlock's gaze. "She was funny. Seemed—um. Uncomplicated. It was nice to imagine that, for a little while."
John had ridden with him in the back of the ambulance. John had clutched his hand and had wiped blood away from his face and had begged him to be all right.
before making the charges disappear. And John would have—John would have attempted to
His cane was gone. Evidence, now. They'd be listening to it down at the Yard, unspooling all of Smith's secrets. Listening to the rasp of what had very nearly been Sherlock's last breaths.
"There are beehives," she'd said, finally. "Out back."
John breathed out hard through his nose, went through the side door into the short hallway leading to the offices and exam rooms.
Sherlock stopped talking, blinked. Glanced over at him, a quick glance, furtive. "No?"
Sherlock had looked at him standing in the doorway and had smiled. His face had been pale, weary. That smile had lit him up.
"I've got to call it in, Sherlock," Lestrade said.
"Right," John says, suddenly feeling wrong-footed, ill-prepared. "Er—stay," he says to the dog, who regards him with a tilted head.
"Are we leaving?" he asked through gritted teeth.
He hated it, as Mycroft surely had known he would when he picked it out.
"It's Rosie. She's got a—not sure if it's a
"I wanted you back, you know," John said quietly. "I wanted you not to be dead."
Sherlock. Sherlock had—
) had been poorly received. Too glib, perhaps. Or perhaps John had not wanted reciprocation at all. There had been a certain degree of self-loathing in those words, after all, and even in his limited experience Sherlock was given to understand that one did not generally woo a partner by appearing despondent about the whole thing.
Just over a year ago, now.
John let his hand drop back down to his side. Stared at Sherlock. "Sorry. What?"
John smiles again, a painful, hurt thing. "Yeah, that's the problem. And that's enough. I've had enough."
"Stay here."
"I thought it was obvious!" She was laughing again, bumping up against Lestrade where he leaned in the doorframe. Their body language was comfortable, familiar, and
"Your case is not worth my time," Sherlock says. "But that's not the only thing you're after here, is it?"
Behind him, the shop door opened and shut. The tall man with the long coat who was very decidedly
Sherlock passes a mildly entertaining afternoon at the morgue whipping a corpse in order to check for bruising patterns.
He had stood up in front of a room full of people and had pledged to protect John and Mary and the baby. Whatever it took. Whatever the cost. He had vowed it, and he had
John lingered for a moment, and there was that
"Hi," Sherlock says brightly, aiming his best grin at the two stunned-looking young men crowded together in the doorway. "Can I help you?"
Sherlock opened his eyes and froze. John's face was only a few inches away.
"Obviously."
Sherlock lifted his hands, set them tentatively on John's shoulders, a light pressure, as if uncertain of their welcome, as if he might need to snatch them away.
There was a small chance—very small—that he could still make it to work on time.
While the eggs sizzled, he fetched his phone from the desk, unplugged it from its charger. He looked down at the screen, at the little voicemail indicator.
that?"
"You did it for me, Sherlock," John said, his face hot, his eyes prickling. He took a deep breath. "All of this. You did it for me, and it was real. I think I can manage to pull myself together long enough to do the same for you, yeah?"
Rosie had laughed, but she'd taken the keys and had hugged John tightly.
The morning air was chilly but the sky was clear, promising a lovely spring day. Speedy's was crowded, with several patrons taking advantage of the outdoor tables.
He thought of Sherlock, gaunt and pale and alarmingly fragile in that hospital bed, his face bruised, his eye red and inflamed. The smile that had tried to curl at the edge of his mouth regardless, the way he'd met John's gaze, the trust that had, somehow, survived harsh words and fists.
He scoffed, looked away. There was a guilty flush of heat climbing up the back of his neck. "Lacking warmth? That's a—" he took a breath, forced himself to look back at her. "I don't coddle them. That's all. I don't—"
Sherlock lifted his hand, gave it a dismissive flick. Almost spilled his drink. "Just a—burglary. Boring. Last week."
come.
John sighed, looked down at his drink.
Sherlock swallows, watches a bead of water drip from John's earlobe and trace a slow, winding pattern down his neck.
"Someone's been messing about with the cadavers," she says.
"Don't be sorry," she said, and she looked at him. Her face was earnest, a little flushed from the wine. Her eyes were quite sad. "Don't be sorry."
"Is he all right, then?" she asks, hesitant now.
She looked away, quickly. "Would you believe this was actually a coincidence?"
"Wait for it," he said.
really
"Yeah, she headed up to the concert about twenty minutes ago. Is this about the results? Dr Bell should be here—"
She turned, looked over her shoulder into the street. He did not follow her gaze. "Your laptop. That's the—?"
His problem was that he no longer felt at home in his house. Hadn't, really, since Mary died. Even before that, if he wanted to be brutally honest with himself.
Sherlock slams on the brakes. The wheels slip helplessly through the mud, and they skid forward, the truck battering up against the wooden structure.
the sort of thing you'd slap with a trite title and serve up to your adoring public."
"I'm not cooking you dinner," Harry tells him.
Sherlock started to laugh.
He went into the bathroom, turned on the shower, stepped in for a hasty wash. The water that pelted against his face and shoulders was cold, and he thought of Lazarus and his interrogation, the dark streak of drying blood that had oozed from beneath his tousled hair. He wondered what other injuries might have been hidden by the shadows.
"Maybe you can spare some time tomorrow morning to tell me what I should be looking for at the ceremony," John said to Sherlock. A startling wave of anger had begun to build in his chest. His blood roared in his ears. "Since you've been too distracted by—by all of this—to discuss any kind of proper strategy."
he thought.
He is clean. He has not lied to anyone about that. He does not take drugs anymore.
"Yeah, well, I didn't expect to see you here either."
It was weeks later, when he'd returned home from work to an empty flat and an apologetic but blunt note on the kitchen table, that he realised he'd never even completed his proposal. He'd left the ring in plain view on the nightstand all that time, had never said another word about it.
Sarah will know. She will suspect. He behaved strangely towards Mary, and now Mary is gone. Might be gone. What has he done? What has he
Sherlock chuckled, and some of the tension seemed to seep out of his shoulders.
She turns her head to look at him. "My sister's dog. They've found a buyer for the farm—taking all of the sheep. But no one wants the dog. It's not his fault, the poor dear, but I can't blame anyone for not wanting to take him on. He's absolute rubbish at herding sheep."
"Hi," John says, for lack of anything better.
"Right," John says. "Yes. But—"
There was no one in the first autopsy bay, nor the second. He looked at the gleaming stainless steel tables, at the drawers on the far wall. Looked away.
John stared at him. His mouth worked soundlessly.
"Nothing about that day made any sense."
The room was unoccupied.
The dog jumps down from the sofa, trots up to Rosie with his tail waving. Licks her face. She giggles.
John turned around, went back into the kitchen. Kept on walking down the hall, went into the loo, shut the door behind him. He did not switch on the light.
Sherlock makes a dismissive sound. "Bored to tears. But better to deal with it now than tomorrow, isn't that the sort of thing you're always telling me?" He puts his hand on John's back, aims him towards the exit.
John took it. Of course he did. Like Sherlock, he'd never been able to refuse her anything.
"Oh, her," Sherlock said. The alarmed interest in his voice vanished. "What did she want?"
He kept Sherlock's phone charged up, left it plugged in and silent on his bedside table. He tried not to look at that, too.
John and Rosie, who would almost certainly outgrow the new arrangement within a few short years, if Sherlock did not drive them away before that. Who would almost certainly one day leave that upstairs bedroom barren and silent once more. Who would one day leave him behind, pacing the lonely halls of his freshly repaired flat like a bewildered ghost.
The wall.
"No," he said. He drained his glass, set it down on the table. He felt cold all over, cold and miserable and hopelessly out of his depth. "Not clever. Just—"
Conclusion: Today was her birthday.
"When he was overpowered. This was not a protracted fight, it was over quickly, in a matter of seconds. John was almost certainly rendered unconscious."
"Is anything
"No time to waste," he said. Something sparked in his haunted eyes.
John, small and pale and unhappy in a grey-walled room, his lips pinched, his shoulders back. Brave.
"There was no real reason to keep me there," John said, taking a few steps forward into the room. He scratched at the back of his neck, a nervous tell, terribly predictable. He was uncomfortable, but soldiering on.
"With good reason."
He is not quite sure what she is apologizing for. He finds he is strangely reluctant to ask.
When he opens his eyes again, it is morning.
He hears when the plane begins to move, the engines ramping up from a whine to a roar, the wheels jolting along the asphalt. He wonders if John is looking at him through the window, but cannot make himself turn around to check.
He returns to his flat, triumphant, with the victim's pink suitcase in tow. There is a particular kind of high that comes with being exceptionally clever, and it has left him feeling incandescent. He wants to impress, he wants to be praised, he wants to show off.
John laughed, startled and genuine. "It's spring."
The door to Flat B was open. He paused in the doorframe, looked around.
Overhead, a tilted, fleeting glimpse of sky.
—but there is nothing dangerous about it. Well, nothing more dangerous than some dodgy wiring.
Sherlock looks at him, looks away. He swallows. The wind whips through his hair.
John is aware of a slow, steady roar building in his ears.
"Not only talking about the sharks. Even if they're not interested, surely there's something in this godforsaken building that
John nodded, sat down on the bed. "And then?"
"Shit," he said. He sagged back in his chair.
"My fellow, on that score we agree. The acting blood within my soul declares that the atmospheric setting in
“I was being silly Rose. I apologise. Very well then, let’s begin.”
Much later, after a meal of excellent hot chicken broth followed by steaming tea and cake, Gregson watched his friends with a smile.
“Sherlock, my love, while I am glad you support my profession – at least occasionally – a set of surgeon’s tools, even in miniature, is not deemed good taste for a Christmas tree.”
The great oak trees slept, their thumping ‘hearts’ pushing vital fluids through the massive tree limbs. The spirit of the trees stirred, but Gregson whispered his greetings politely and moved on.
of pirate ships.
Not all mysteries could be solved and this one would join the few unsuccessful cases in his archives.
Gregson missed his love fiercely at the sight. Once he was home he would do the same, but more cautiously for they still lived in the middle of a busy London street where everyone’s business was everyone’s business.
Sliding off Rose and ensuring her comfort with a bag of food, Gregson examined the oaks, feeling a sense of familiarity and comfort. Here the oak trees were impressive and would suit a wonderful celebration. They were old, so very old.
. His bright face bore a fascinated expression, which Watson understood - he too, was curious and intrigued by the presence of pirates but he was rather more concerned by the plank situated to their left further down from the ship.
Silent trees stood at a distance watching him, bare of their leaves, but Gregson was undaunted. Life was not dead, merely asleep. Soon enough he would celebrate the winter solstice with his uncle and lover. On the shortest day they would sing and dance, feast on carefully stored provisions and drink. They would recall tales of the coming spring and the blessed sun who would now linger for longer in the heavens. Hope for warmer weather and the passing of winter would be renewed.
Gregson smiled. “A little of both.”
Yet he understood the meaning behind the words, behind the music that played with fingers moving quick as lightening over wooden instruments. Druids chanted some songs and blessed mistletoe whilst using holly and ivy full of meaning – evergreen, the continuity of life and the promise of spring.
“Now, now, my dear John, what is there to fret over? We are merely going to decorate the magnificent fir tree you kindly purchased yesterday and is now standing proudly by the window.”
Tenderly assisting Watson up the stairs for his leg was troubling him, Holmes enacted the second action only when they were divested of their coats, hats, gloves and Watson's walking stick.
Watson’s thoughts stuttered to a halt.
Ah yes, Holmes. His dearest friend stood not far from him, and opening his eyes, Watson glanced over at the detective who appeared remarkably composed for a man surrounded by
Tattoos abounded and the weaponry was old, with flintlocks and muskets being the main gun. In fact, from the ship to the jewellery and speech to the very fashion worn smacked of the early 18th century.
Then Sherlock proved he was as fleet of foot as he boasted, and in a flash both men had not merely walked the plank, but raced over it to dive into the deep blue waters.
Watson stated at his madman incredulously and, well, because Holmes
Holmes never explored said mystery of Watson's supposed innocence, due to being rather tied up in setting the record straight vis-à-vis his person and that of his supposed lookalike each time it occurred. Watson's bliss after each record setting session also always left Holmes too distracted with smug delight to pursue the matter.
Then, from the relentless snow, appeared a man on a horse. Gregson nearly laughed. Doctor Watson! The light was an old-fashioned lamp fastened to his saddle.
” His annoyed grunt was due to still not finding a scientific explanation for the whole process, which supplied never ending amusement for both Watson and Gregson.
The painful hold that his companion - well, captor - had on Watson’s arm was an annoyance moreso because he had chosen the arm with his weakened shoulder, still stiff from his wound at Maiwand. Otherwise Watson could have mentioned what a poor grip his captor had on his person, but such criticism surely wasn't polite and indeed, rather detrimental for their future chances for escape.
Watson was chattering happily about the latest motion picture they had seen. As Holmes paused by a wall plastered with overly dramatic poses, his companion tapped him on the shoulder. Looking over Holmes had to smile at Watson's pure exhilaration, whose eyes were shining brightly and cheeks flushed most becomingly.
"I say Holmes," said Watson with a wide grin. "That chap, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, looked awfully like you and even fenced with your skill."
Unfortunately, in the case of said car, due to the weather both the good doctor and the car would not be in evidence. It was of no matter. Gregson would simply saddle a horse and ride. Finding a serviceable steed was easy for he knew how to navigate this village and even with the white flakes falling faster every minute the village stables were open.
Watson sighed and raised an eyebrow at his Holmes, the source of this trouble. Watson distrusted that friendly yet earnest fervour as his genius lounged in the grip of his captors. Grey eyes flashed at Watson with a gleam of mischief and Watson had the horrid feeling that Holmes was going to try something silly...though considering they were being held prisoner by pirates maybe some more foolishness wouldn't be misplaced.
“Thank goodness Watson found you!”
That is to say, in Sherlock’s company Christmas became another day in the calendar where my dear friend’s talents could be guaranteed to surprise. Ever since the exploding Christmas Cracker incident (and subsequent banning of Sherlock from all future crackers), I approached the decoration of our tree with some trepidation mixed with genuine excitement.
“Put your criminal on the tree then Sherlock. I shall retrieve the dried apples and oranges and our tinsel. Please do refrain from adding
A seemingly innocuous word, yet one with profound significance of a religious nature as well as commercial. For my part I observed both the religious and commercial aspects well enough and now that I was as recovered as much as I would ever be from Maiwand, I thoroughly enjoyed the festive season.
"Now, let's indulge in some indecent shenanigans. Perhaps our pirates may even approve."
Lamps burned on either side of the door and just inside stood a relieved detective. He didn’t speak until they were all inside and the door securely locked. Only then did the detective embrace Gregson.
For a moment Watson ignored the multitude of odours, both pleasant and unpleasant unlike, as he closed his eyes temporarily against the glare of the midday sun - not an insignificant prospect in the blazing heat of the Caribbean. Above his head was the creak of rigging, beside him he heard the shift of his companion - boots on wet deck under which the wooden boards groaned slightly as the ship rolled on the waves, small as the waves were at present.
Of course, I know why, even if he doesn't.
“I’ll break every bone your body if you do.” came the mumbled reply. John laughed and walked out of the room. With football practice out of the question, John was determined to check on his flatmate every so often today until he was fully conscious. He decided not to call Mycroft. He didn’t know his number anyway.
"In the loo, the night of our arrest, he gave me his number." I stated the truth very carefully, waiting for.....
We were both sticky with the warm ejaculate and I kept going. It didn't take long.  John's cock was semi hard and I kept thrusting along side of his, watching his face get red again. I was watching him squirm under me, his eyes full of heat as he watched me until I came, adding my ejaculate to his. I fell half on top of him.
Hard to walk if you can't see where you're going.
"Goodnight, Inspector. See you at the court case."
John could not tear his eyes away. His throat was dry. What could Jim want with Sherlock? Jim walked right up to him and started a conversation. They were talking. Did they know each other? John could only see the back of Jim’s head. He could see Sherlock’s face, but he wasn’t speaking now, and his face was impassive.
The music was loud. Laser lights in every direction. I couldn't see the floor. I'm actually glad I had a few drinks before we got here. My headache was better.
John moved forward again until they were very close. He looked at Sherlock’s eyes in the dim light of the sitting room, which had a silver cast. John reached out and touched Sherlock on the thigh and he gave a small gasp.
John watched his parents more than he watched his plate during dinner.   Did they suspect anything about him and Sherlock? Was Harry smirking at them? No, when she looked over at them it was with look of admiration. John relaxed a little.
"I know it's so."
Mike rolled onto his back, opened his eyes and everyone gave a sigh of relief.
What's he going on about John for? How annoying. He's sitting much too close to me. I have a theory that you can tell someone is psychotic if the lower part of the sclera is visible under the iris. Just a theory. Haven't met enough psychotics to test it out, but time's on my side. He slides me the mirror again and I look down at the diminished powder. How long have we been here? My jaw clenches but I do another blessed line.  A benevolent line. A beatific line.
Opening his eyes, Gregson undid the circle carefully then mounted Rose.
A long thin arm gestured towards the tree, which I readily agreed was essentially a large green bush and creating a lovely smell of pine in our sitting room.
Formally a hotbed for pirates Watson had believed them to hunted down years ago. He had clearly been mistaken.
Had we helped a priest recently? I racked my brains even as I glared at Sherlock who was gasping for laughter.
Sherlock released that peculiar high laugh of his before answering. His expression was angelically innocent – whether of the fallen kind or unfallen one I would soon learn…
Watson tread water, too astonished to say anything. Their captors must have forgotten them for the gallant square-rigged ship was turning away and sailing towards her brethren. As she did, a flag was raised: not the skull and crossbones but with a jewelled jaguar in mid-leap.
” is the correct epithet.
Swiftly they were on the narrow winding path which led to the lonely cottage, perched on a cliff high above the sea.
Whiteness swirled about them both, stinging his exposed face as they rode up the steady incline. Barren fields rolled away on either side, now rapidly filling with ice and snow. The rising wind drove more shards of painful flakes at Gregson sitting tall in his saddle.
“I shall be back once I have secured the tree,” I threatened.
Holmes sighed theatrically, but conceded and restrained himself to carrying Gregson’s bag, ignoring all protests to the contrary. Then he vanished to fuss over the bath while Watson helped him unpack due to his numb fingers. Somehow, Gregson found himself hurried along to a welcoming bath whereupon Watson remained to assist.
He had made Rose comfortable by the time his companions had reassured themselves of each other’s health. Watson’s steed – Thor – was soon likewise secured and with that the three men slipped into the house.
Due to our latest case only finishing a week ago, plus a busy spate in my practice, we hadn’t the time to purchase or decorate a tree.
Watson smiled at his teasing. “Living with Holmes has honed my senses in that regard.”
Gregson had to concur with that declaration so he gave up all fight and enjoyed the deliciously hot water.
“Please tell me the elves are gone and not actually still present.”
Deciding it would be wise to hurry along with whatever nefarious plans my darling had concocted I rose somewhat stiffy, (the cold weather always had my leg play up) and guided us to our splendid tree.
“Sherlock, I know that look. Should I be worried?”
It was not only the water warming Watson now, so with a flush he glanced back at the ship they had escaped from, still mindful that they had not escaped from the pirate fleet.
Before either man could wonder what was to be their fate the shimmering haze transformed back into a thick sea fog which had initially transported them here. The fog had found them when they stumbled upon an artfully hidden shallow lake. Watson felt Holmes' strong fingers clench tighter on him in the humid wet presence of the fog, but in a jiffy the fog had dissipated to reveal Nassau.
Quite a vision and one that summed up a former military doctor, now occasional civilian doctor and  nearly full time partner to one consulting detective, who played the violin like a Master, or allowed it to warble if on a line of peculiar thinking.
Tugging up his scarf so it covered his mouth and cheeks Gregson squinted. The morning sun glittered amongst the ivory curtain causing flashes of white to sparkle and dance in his vision, but he could just espy the path ahead. Faithful and resolute Rose knew the road well and with head bowed continued on at a fast trot.
madman, kissed the man into silence.
Watson inhaled as a breeze ruffled his hair. The tang of brine was carried on the currents of the wind. It also caught up the scents of his companions, some rather unwashed while others must have taken advantage of whatever perfume or cologne they could lay their hands upon.
Warmth plumed around Watson as the sea welcomed him once more. Strong arms gripped him and Watson surfaced with a splutter. Holmes' worried expression searched him.
Since meeting Mr Sherlock Holmes and eventually developing a very intimate relationship of a romantic overture, Christmas had taken on added meaning.
how Watson envisioned his life ending, or indeed, his lovely summer holiday. Evidently he had been remiss in his lecture to Holmes on the proper holiday spirit - taking on a case involving gold doubloons and mysterious islands in the balmy waters off Nassau.
Flames leapt into the air, crackling and spitting, and Gregson blinked to clear his vision. He stood once more in the little semi-circle of trees with Rose finishing her food. Gregson grinned and petted her.
Snow began falling heavily upon Gregson’s arrival to the little train station set outside the otherwise isolated village to which Mr Holmes and Doctor Watson had retired to a few years ago. Normally Doctor Watson would be waiting with their new expensive sleek automobile, which had been a gift from an extremely grateful client. Gregson had never heard the particulars of said case and suspected he would rather not know the finer details.
“Come man,” urged Holmes, green-grey eyes bright with sudden excitement. A lifetime of acquaintance with Holmes had Gregson suitably alarmed.
Shrugging off some of the fluffy yet decidedly cold snow which had settled on his shoulders, Gregson was grateful for his bulk. Watson, a former rugby player, was teased occasionally by Holmes for their burliness, calling them “men of action” when in a tight spot, but with the weather turning deadly cold, having some muscle and fat was certainly helpful.
Once satisfied his lover would be silent for a few seconds, Watson withdrew, face flushed to glare sternly at the source of his trouble. Sherlock blinked slowly, still dazed from their kiss, a loving smile curving his lips.
In the end, another case took Holmes' attention, (a matter of blackmail concerning  important figures within the secretive Freemasons), from investigating further and, after all, with his beloved John by his side Holmes was content.
His brother Mycroft found the entire affair hilarious and offered no help beyond silent amusement.
“Sorry…sorry John,” he gasped. Then without any guilt, the man let off another matchbox and one larger box.
Gregson could feel the tug of Holmes and Watson’s cottage in the distance. On his first visit to his friends in their retirement, he had cleansed their home and blessed it and did so every time he came. Over time this had left a visible spiritual mark and one he recognised. Inhaling carefully he captured that sensation and brought it with him to the waking world as a thread leading from their home to his mind.
Holly and ivy were ostensibly innocent, yet the rest of his supplies had a flair of being used either in Catholic ritual (his incense for one) or in a more pagan sense, such as his wand and spell book.
Gregson gave them their privacy, yet aware in the corner of his eyes the gentle slide of hands, the brush of lips over a furrowed brow and long white fingers gently stroking over a stiff shoulder.
Rose snorted in the fashion of a horse. Her meaning was simple:
Still…he would have to ride harder if he were to reach his friends before the snow made it impossible to travel – and being trapped outside would not be good. Usually Gregson would have stayed the night in the village in such conditions, but he had brought with him certain supplies he feared to be discovered upon his person.
“How about the small gifts?”
"I should hope my dear Watson that my swordsmanship is of a better calibre, sufficient to ward off impudent men clad in green leggings. As for looks, we are quite dissimilar - for example, the nose is not right."
Creating a circle was hard with gloved hands beginning to go numb despite his thick gloves, yet in a moment he had succeeded. He did not have time for proper ritual; however the circle would keep them and those outside safe. Kneeling on the snow laden ground, Gregson focused his mind until he could sense acutely his environment.
Gregson glanced to his left to try and pin where he was along the path.
Holmes grinned and allowed Watson to pull him to the ground as a spectacular sunset turned the skies rich golden red - and how was it sunset now when midday had been only minutes ago?
Sloops were raised up on the waves, captured on a sudden steady wind that had sailed into the world with the fleet. Schooners with narrow hulls and two masts kept the sister sloops company. Together the two types of ships were as fast as dolphins and ranged ahead of the fleet, maybe seeking prey.
A ship - a fleet - and people out of their time.
Though he ought to act first just in case Holmes decided on theatrics.
Watson, good man, merely chuckled at his poorly concealed jealousy, but said nothing as Holmes seized the opportunity to walk through a gap in the crowd. Indeed, it was only when they were strolling up Baker Street after a short taxi ride that Watson spoke again.
Watson clumsily tied his sword to his belt with his neckerchief and pulled Holmes to him again.
"You should take better care of your Lady!" Watson shouted, glee pumping through his veins, energising him in his pursuit of Holmes. His clever detective had taken advantage of the chaos Watson had unleashed, briefly detouring to snatch at a pile of glittering treasure, quick as one of his Irregulars.
"Oh, but I cannot fence."
"Good heavens Holmes! That is the same symbol of the jewelled pin our client wore on their scarf!"
A square-rigged ship, with three masts, deep crimson flags reminding Watson of blood on his surgical blade or staining the sands of Maiwand. She had a large hold, but was not built for speed so vulnerable to pirate hunters. However, this Captain who spoke musically in Spanish whilst his Englishman captor jabbered away in Watson's left ear, had no concern for beyond the bow of his elegant lady stretched a
Come morning, which found a sleepy and thoroughly fenced Dr John Watson, Mr Sherlock Holmes could say with some satisfaction that their trip to the cinema had been a success. The best part being the private show in their bedroom afterwards.
behind the necessity for exploding matchboxes and a gift box later, as well as the concern at Mrs Hudson’s reaction to Holmes’ latest antics.
“Damn.”
Curling up in under the thick comforter, Gregson fell asleep cradled by both past and present, while relishing the future with great joy.
I could only laugh and drag my impossible detective to me for a fierce kiss and an embrace where my hands wandered over the slim yet muscular frame. We parted panting with Sherlock staring down at me intently.
“Yes, but Watson turned up at the right time…as usual.”
Watson was reclining in the massive armchair that was positioned as close to the fire as one could be without falling into the grate. Holmes was standing and playing his violin, a sweet jolly melody that summoned up his vision back among the oaks. Shortly, the tall thin detective would be curled up with his doctor, exchanging kisses and soft murmurs beyond words.
"Good heavens," said Holmes, breathing ghosting across Watson's wet cheek. "They are departing."
That Watson for the next month occasionally mentioned Sir Guy of Gisbourne every now and then, was surely innocent despite the glimmer in his eyes and the slight rambling manner in which the subject was announced.
He did not think it was his imagination when he heard a distant laugh of thanks, or saw a flash of twirling shapes amid the darkness outside or suddenly smelled musk, food and ale.
“I suppose a spirit does relate to the spiritual realm…”
Holmes slipped away momentarily to retrieve a seemingly innocuous bag sitting to one side of the tree. What he revealed upon opening made me sigh. Let the record show that “
He intention was to cleanse and bless the home of his old friends. This was following the trouble they had with the same client who had gifted them with the automobile. However, as of this moment a simple visit was rapidly transforming into a minor incident.
His strength was formidable, but he was weary after a long journey and week of policing. This was transforming into a test of endurance.
“Yes and no doubt you shall forget all the pertinent details now it is no longer required for our case?”
"My dear John, the type of fencing I have in mind is eminently suited to your skills. Now let us retire so I may convince you of my arguments."
Creatures dozed under the soil in their winter sleep with plants also resting before flourishing once more. Now he drifted past them, aware of the other animals who slept during the day waiting for night or the day animals which now huddled to hide from the snow storm.
“Sherlock, how did you succeed in such a feat, a mere week before Christmas Eve?”
The ornament was a splendid rendition of a ghost similar to the Ghost of Christmas Present in the Dickens’ tale, but with a scowling expression, boots and the Freemason symbol. It was a picture of the scoundrel who had tormented a glass maker called Mr Schmidt – all in an attempt to drive the man mad. The idea was for Krämer, as the apprentice, to gain possession of Mr Schmidt’s glass workshop.
Visibility was now nearly gone, the sun causing everything to be shifting shades of ivory and white with a pale blue-silver gleam that added an ethereal edge to the world. His garments afforded little protection against the angry elements. Gregson ignored the icy jagged fragments fear underlying his confidence, instead driving his will ahead and projecting calmness to Rose.
A fleet that had not been there when they had abruptly found themselves in the sparkling blue waters far from Nassau, with the cloying fog rolling away to reveal the sailing ship they were now occupying.
Truly, the ship was a beauty.
"Referring to your earlier points concerning Sir Guy of Gisbourne, allow me to show you that any similarities are superfluous."
Holmes looked unconvinced. "Once we are back at our holiday home I shall check your shoulder, in case your old wound is playing up."
Heat welcome Gregson and he sighed to feel the warmth sinking through his frozen flesh and bones.
Watson nearly rolled his eyes. Holmes would never be a pirate but the artist in his friend's blood admired the splendour of the arrayed mass of ships, the flair of gold, the sheen of silver cuffs and earrings, the mix of breeches with stocking clad legs tucked into boots or square toed shoes, others wearing trousers (and Watson blushed at sighting a couple of women clad in breeches and stockings). Full shirts were aplenty, as were coats of varying cuts and colours.
Holmes kept his arm linked with Watson’s as they navigated the press of bodies filling the lobby of the cinema.
“Rose my lady, I must thank my ancestors. I have an idea. Now, don’t panic.”
In comparison the trees offered little shelter, but they offered a more favourable option of providing some protection from the wind. He could also think of what to do without battling the wind so much.
There was a limit and on holiday Watson refused to entertain ghosts, both he and Sherlock had a sufficient score of ghosts between them, (Maiwand, people Holmes couldn't save in time, the Reichenbach Falls for starters), so their holidays had enough luggage without ghosts in stunning vessels turning up.
Watson chuckled at that and patted Gregson on the shoulder. His eyes were bright as ever, though his shoulder obviously pained him. He said cheerfully, with a voice rough from the cold, “Moreso that Gregson found me.”
The sight was quite enchanting but Watson remained firm as he proclaimed, "No more ghosts on holiday Sherlock - my new rule. Your research may wait until I have had at least one fishing trip. However, in the meantime, you will return that gold doubloon to our customer and stash what other mischief you snatched up for further study later. Right now however.. "
“I shall Sherlock, but do not think that you have distracted me. If there are any further Christmas crackers I expect a massage.”
The first he did whilst pulling out his keys to open their front door.
I sneezed following my internal observation as my throat and nose protested the overwhelming scent and calmly shook off some of my decorative additions.
Holmes sighed, unable to resist his dear doctor's enthusiasm and sheer cheerfulness. All he could do were two things.
“I assure you my dear Watson, you have provided me with many hours of concern over the years,” retorted Holmes who then embraced his dear friend. Their embrace lasted much longer and was full of whispers.
Once they were safe he would ask Holmes and Watson if he could bring his family here to spend the Solstice, for here the past was very close and he owed the oaks thanks for their protection and assistance.
First things first though, he must arrive at his friends’ home. Bending down over the saddle Gregson concentrated on following the thread that connected him to their destination.
Then I drew the curtains smiling at the effect of the yellow candlelight on the tinsel, apples and oranges, the coloured paper chains and the small metal surgical blade, stethoscope and the glass ornament.
Instead, I focused on the incense ticking my nose, along with my shawl of shredded coloured paper, scraps of cloth and…tinsel? Indeed, I had the appearance of a yeti.
“Holmish,” I corrected and laughed at his splutter then shivered at the wicked grin.
Small, yet elegant but somehow misplaced, for her sails were square, her decks of beautifully polished wood not yet tarnished by her owners beyond the slick of water from where Holmes and Watson had been hoisted aboard. In fact...unease unfurled in Watson even as senses properly absorbed the sight spread before him.
Wrenching free of his fellow irritating Englishman of the weak grip, Watson threw a punch at the Captain who did not have time to be surprised.
“Mr Schmidt was terribly grateful and I couldn’t help but admire his work. This gift arrived yesterday while you were out shopping. Remarkable isn’t it?”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed. “Turkish?”
Worry tickled at him. In good weather he had another fifteen minute journey, in these conditions it would take half an hour at least. Could he and Rose manage? If they wandered off the path and somehow stepped onto a frozen pond they might slip and be debilitatingly injured, or they might reach the cliff edge and tumble off…neither option was appealing.
Gregson knew that tonight both men would sleep little, but rather would take turns watching over him to ensure he had not suffered frostbite or a cold. Warmed by their affection, Gregson reached his room and withdrew his holly and ivy. The bright red against the evergreen was beautiful.
I rolled my eyes at my darling’s pretend repentance, but agreed.
That same wicked grin was flashed my way and I found myself chasing Sherlock into his room and abruptly having an enthusiastic detective kissing me in ‘penance’. I permitted the kiss before pushing Sherlock towards the bed.
Holmes, the maniac,  grinned and sprinted off while surprise was still with them. Watson followed with a slashing sweep of the curved blade at the nearby rigging. A moment later there was an ominous creak and men and women were scattering with roars and shrieks.
“Yes,” said Sherlock in excellent cheer.
He waved and the man waved back before coming up and seizing his reins. Nodding in comprehension, Gregson allowed Doctor Watson to steer them to safety. Shortly, though it felt longer, they were approaching the small stables kept on the disused farm Holmes and Watson had purchased.
Turns out, it's all fine.
“Last night, you were the one who noticed Mike bleeding from the back of the head-again supporting someone who is training to be a medical observer. When I got up to look at your kitchen window-- it was open.”  Sherlock said as he turned to look at John, who was now behind him.
“And…how’s your girlfriend?”
"Not exactly," Sherlock lets out a sigh. "That's how I managed to get out of it."
And John got stuck there, in Sherlock’s gaze, and the room got quiet, just the two of them, distant noises of cars on the street and a few birds chirping in trees near the house.
John makes his way over to the sofa, legs collapsing as he sits.
Besides,
After about and hour, Lestrade popped his head in the door. "Tea?" he offered.
“So….how’s uni?” asked Harry, making polite conversation. Her turn next year.
“John, um….I may as well tell you---
“Well, John,” Mary's tone was condescending and she patted John on the shoulder,
“See you at school.”
John turned to Mike, 'You don't have to come in, 'right?
I did mention that he looked awful. I could still see fading bruises. There were healing abrasions, too. Face, neck, arms.
I stood up and slipped my jeans off as he lay there watching me--maybe a little slower than I should have. John's heavy lidded eyes glinted at me in the semi dark room. He helped me work his jeans off. Both fully naked, I got back into bed and he reached for me.
Despite pleading, then angry silence-- from the tube station to the destination, Sherlock would not give John any information.
I made note cards. I highlighted notes in different colors. Molly quizzed me and we studied together. My marks in all of my classes were abysmal, but by far the worst class was chemistry.
John looked up at me, confused. He nodded. Lestrade took off the handcuffs.
John had never seen him like this and did not get any suspicion from Mike that Sherlock went out at all. John had not seen him drink.
The foam and the heat of the club made my clothes wet. Everyone's clothes were wet.
"Yes John, it would be the thing to do, when you get the chance. When I called, I identified myself as a 'university administrator' and informed them that you were perfectly fine. but I'm sure they'd love to hear your voice."
John walked up the steps, but Stamford followed, afraid to be alone.
But the person in the chair
A tiny part of him blames Sherlock for Harry getting hurt, although he also knows he is wrong.
"It's ok. You don't look too bad, really." she said with a weak smile. I shut the door.
For a moment I felt icy fear in my stomach.
A bit.
"It's not me, Dad. I have friends--in London. Who---well, let's just say, who are incredible. Just incredible."  he tried not to smile, it certainly wasn't the time.
I would have never found this out, but Mary had a guilty conscience and told me everything. Mary was helping Jim. She told Jim each time we went out and to which pub we were headed. It was Mary who was watching us.
(quoting my brother). I didn't buy anything, except a latte.
After dinner at Angelo’s and 3 glasses of wine, John felt a bit overfull. Although Sherlock ordered only a salad, he picked at the bread bowl and John’s pasta. John was surprised when Sherlock repeatedly grabbed olives off his plate, but he didn’t mind.
We sat there for a minute kissing, then I made to push him back. He shifted and I reached under his jersey to lift it off. He pulled me on top of him. I leaned on my left arm as my right hand made my way to his belt. I kept kissing him, pulling at his bottom lip delicately with my teeth as I rubbed him through his jeans. He moaned into my mouth, breathless. I kissed along his neck-nipping and pulling at the skin
He motions for me to sit. "I was told that you are a connoisseur." He sits and rummages through his pockets.
He opened his eyes, briefly. He looked right at me. "John. SW1."
I've gotten thoroughly smashed a few times, and so has she, on our trips to the pubs.
He had to side step a few small groups as he walked. He could still see Jim having an animated conversation with Sherlock and Sherlock listening intently. From his vantage point, he saw Jim’s right hand actually reach into the pocket of Sherlock’s coat. Sherlock did not react, but was listening seriously.
"Sherlock...I thought you had given up...drugs." Now he looked up. Right at me.  In his eyes was a little cold fear. Why did I feel guilty? I didn't do anything.
Game's tiresome now. Not half as interesting as I'd hoped. Leave now or drink the beer then leave? Stick around for details or just call it a  boring evening?
Sherlock shrugged and leaned in to whisper to john. “Well you are, aren’t you?” Sherlock winked at him and added excitedly, “Hey, guess what--I can have a glass of wine! I’m of age!”
I managed to croak out, lifting my head to see better.
but criminals rarely are."
I make it into my room, shut the door and turn the lock.
....John sighs, it would be much better if Sherlock didn't have another ugly black and blue mark against his pale skin when he was going to meet his parents. After a week of stakeouts and refusal to eat, he was thinner than usual, too.  John looked at Sherlock and had to wonder what his mum'd say.
"Jim-- what are you doing here with him?" she said in an exaggerated whisper, eyes wide.
I sat right next to him in my own chair, leaning forward, elbows on my knees. He had a private room and although the chairs were close, we kept our voices down.
apparent to John. Something I'm not sure he wants to hear right now.
"Why are you doing this?" Sherlock asked, uncharacteristically shoveling food into this mouth one evening as they sat in the kitchen eating Thai take a away. The windows were open in the flat and a warm breeze wafted into the sitting room and blew the curtains around.
There were classes, parties and football games. John tried to get Sherlock to come to one game, any game, but he adamantly refused.
The bus rumbles though the wet London streets, setting him off a few blocks away from his flat. He gets off the bus, stepping in a cold puddle, his sock full of water. Seems about right.
Of course, I refused. I just rather
This is the final chapter. I'd like to thank everyone for reading this story and for the kind comments and advice in case I was going off the rails a bit. Please comment if you liked it and what you liked best.   I am a writer and I spend inordinate amounts of my time writing and plan to continue. Because it is problem I have, have always had.
Tonight's a 'foam party'. Not sure what that is.  I had pizza with the football club earlier today. They'll be at the 'foam party' too. I'm not committing to any societies or clubs yet. I like rugby, too.
"Neither do I." John said quietly, shrugging. He placed his right hand on my waist.
Ordinarily, he tried his best to avoid Jim Moriarty because he just couldn't fathom what his motivation was. Jim made his skin crawl. Last year, he spent far more time with Jim than he should have, but he had no other dealer so accessible.  Sherlock was quite aware that drugs were a pretty poor coping mechanism, but here he was.
" I shrugged. "Then I thought I heard a yell...or scream."
Looks like I won't have to choose between football or rugby.
Stamford was twitchy, looking around nervously, "John, this neighborhood is sketchy, probably smack heads and..."
Sherlock laughed and looked away, eyes focused in the distance. Slowly, almost shyly, he glanced back at John, the tops of his cheeks a bit pink. John just now realizing that there was some tension between them-- that they were wary of each other, back together again, after a summer apart.
It has to be Lestrade, John can't imagine who else it could be that Sherlock is explaining their holiday plans to.
We talked about a lot of things. I wanted to fill him in on all the things that happened while he was in hospital.
I was too distracted.
"I remember very little about that night. I have a concussion and memory loss."  I said, my voice sounding much smaller than I wanted it to.
“I’m sorry John, I guess I presumed a liberty here, but I thought you would want to know. I apologize for overstepping my bounds.” Now, Mycroft Holmes looks at his feet.
"It was a mistake, Sherlock. I was wrong. I should be living with you. I should be here, with you. I mean, if you'll have me.
I had previously reviewed the process that I used to render the appliance inoperable with Lestrade. He wrote it all down in detail and sent it in to the manufacturer of the device,  the extremely unlikely case that someone--
“What did I do?” she asked.
There was nothing for it.
"You're not laughing." John said soberly from his seat.
I thought it was best to avoid John. Maybe if I didn't see him, I wouldn't be so angry. In my fit of pique, I fell asleep early in the evening, so I was wide awake at about 3 am.
"Fine, let's see, then." Sherlock squinted in the dim light of the stairwell, trying gauge John's pupils. "Maybe not, but the light's not great here, let's go." he grabbed John's wrist and dragged him out the door and back into the party.
he tosses the duvet onto the sofa and hits John in the chest with the pillow.
Students dropped over unannounced to talk, excited to hear all the details of the 3 boys daring escape just before the explosion. Mary, Molly and Sarah came over a few times to see them. Mary always found a way to sit next to John, her eyes shining with admiration at the heroic story. Sarah had dated John last year, but they were still on good terms. They all had very lively conversations with loads of laughter.
"What happened, did something happen?" I managed to ask.
“Am I to assume that you are somehow responsible for this?” the solemn, soft voice seemed to be directed at Sherlock.
"Why not? Unless you have something on tomorrow?" I reach my hand up his back under his jacket, step closer and kiss him. He kisses me back.
Kate walks up.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and continues, "But I was afraid--I wouldn't be able...." his voice breaks,  "...to make it back to you." he whispers.  Sherlock swallows hard, looks at John briefly, then turns away again.
Sherlock was quiet for a minute, "Sorry, I suppose I shouldn't have done that, with all you've been through tonight." He looked into John eyes, pupils the proper size now. Sherlock bit his own lip.
"Fine, let's go." he takes my hand.
Rain dripping down his nose, he turned around to see who was shouting his name.
Molly was at my side. She put a hand on my shoulder. "John, he's unconscious. You should call an ambulance."
I turned around to look at him. He smiled and shrugged his shoulders again. I opened the door and walked out.
I looked over at Sherlock. "The pub--want to go?"
It was a very pretty row house. Large rooms, high ceilings, expensive looking furniture. Music blaring from--
It's been a year of settling in. John comes along with me sometimes to the Yard or on cases, a great assistant,
He was glad he decided to purchase the screwdriver, mostly for its appearance of harmlessness, just in case he was caught. A pocket knife would work too, but there’s always more of a risk with a knife.
I opened one eye to a dim room. I looked at the ceiling, wondering in a lifting haze of sleep where I was. Then a heard a creak and looked over to see Sherlock standing on my desk.
So, I stayed near the exit, keeping it in my sights and keeping my feet dry.
Sherlock chatted quite happily en route to Anqelo’s and John tried valiantly to listen, but had a nagging feeling he forgot something. He just couldn’t remember what it was. It was so nice to see Sherlock again. John was so excited and hung on Sherlock’s every word. He wanted to keep up his end of the conversation and ask questions about what he was working on with Scotland Yard.
Now that morning was upon them, the children stood there looking at the figure on the sofa, horrified. Teen John shifted from foot to foot, quite uncertain of what to do next.
"Maybe the mistress wanted money?"
-I had entertained that he may have been trying to get me drunk in order to seduce me. Then again, maybe that was just my fervent wish superimposed upon reality.
he whispers, "Maybe better."
"Thanks, it's... fine. It was a long time ago." I managed. I hate to talk about my father.
He looked around. Wait no, this was not Baker street.
Thursday, noon.
John was holding his head, massaging his temples. "I'm sorry, I...how? I...I can't believe," he looked between Lestrade and me shaking his head. "Are you sure you have the right person? Because Sherlock..."
Mary stared at him wide eyed, fork half way to her mouth, as he reached into his pocket to answer it.
"I never find you alone, Sherlock. Until tonight. What happened to your boyfriend, John"? he opened the bottle and passed the opener to me.
"In the case that you
John thinks he can see a slight movement in the angle of Sherlock’s shoulders. He must be anticipating more of John’s anger. What else do they know?
Hazard number two--
The little boy looks at John and says, “I guess you have to look harder for yours.”
"What is it?"
Sherlock looked at John with a surprised, softer look, “OK,” he said, quietly, blinking.
Sherlock looked down at John's hand holding onto his wrist, his breath caught in his chest somewhere. “I have to go,” he said, serious, now looking John in the eyes.
Harry picked him up at the station.
I thought there was only one useful observation that evening, but there were actually two.
or something. Men, women--I seem to draw them all. I just frown at them and walk away. I don't even want to insult anyone anymore.
Sherlock cleaning the kitchen after John had gone to bed. Putting everything away. Washing the dishes, sweeping the floor, quiet, calm and contemplative.
And the bad news? She'll be out in a week.
I sat up. I have a headache. This is the beginning of a hangover, I think. Was I still drunk when Sherlock left? What time was that? What time is it now?
"Why would I do something like what?" He asked, but I couldn't read his face, it was blank.
The students were already realizing the hazard of the slip and fall and were being careful walking or running.
He knew he was being stared at. The hair on the back of his neck stood up and tingled. Jim kept glancing over, looking at him out of the corner of his eye and soon he stood at Sherlock's elbow.
See the family photo displayed on the desk--displayed prominently."
had devised a plan,

Irene started to walk away, but looked back at John for her parting shot.  She smiled.
I watch as he slips out the door and silently through the lounge. I realize we didn't discuss meeting again. I closed my door quietly.
"Nice friend." I said.
"Look here," and he uses tweezers to extract the tiniest pink feather from the cut in the man's wrist and places it in a plasticine bag.
“Sorry, I’m not following you.” John got up from the table and poured a cup of tea.
"Does it need translated?" ventures another, trying to be helpful.
"John, it's fine," Mary whispered.
“Sorry.” John said softly.
She looked at him blankly.
"Fine Ian, these two are just leaving." he lowered the poker and placed it back in the stand near the fireplace.
that's what they called it.
"Thanks," he said, softly.
Mary asked again.
I don't study, I'm avoiding the library and the coffee shop, so I've told loads of people to piss off.
You came to my party.” John said slowly, with a very concerned look on his face.
"What?" asked John, impatient.
Irene had left a good ten minutes before and John ached to leave, too.
"Oh my God," John whispered under his breath, looking at the text that still showed the address.
"I thought you were thinking about darts and chips and that long winded chemistry problem and maybe...me."
They told me I was lucky to be alive, with only a broken ankle, concussion and about 25 large bruises. All thanks to Jim, the wanker.
A few blocks down the street, I slowed my pace.
"Practically a social butterfly tonight, aren't you?" Jim handed the bar tender the money.
“What are you taking about?” Mary asked, incredulous.
"What?" she asked with eyebrows raised in a question. "Or should I ask
“John, isn’t that your flatmate?” Mary asked.
The prosecco wasn't half bad, really. Three pints and half a bottle of prosecco later, I was pleasantly tipsy. Not pissed, but drunk enough to believe than anything was possible. Like me and John.
In a few minutes he dropped off the paper in the correct office and softly closed the door of the building behind him.
Hence the dressing gown.
Last night John had the best time he ever had in his life. He never thought he’d be so happy, he never thought he’d…be happy like this. With another bloke. He always thought of his sister as ‘the gay one’ and he was ‘the not gay one’. Ok-what does that mean? He’s not entirely gay—so he’s dated girls up ‘til now—but he’s  not entirely ‘not gay’ either—because he’s with Sherlock and that’s just---wonderful. Really wonderful. And that’s fine.
“Really-- Scotland Yard will muck it up?” How was this possible? John thought. Professional investigators and police. The best and the brightest.
John turned to look at Sherlock and paused, “…..you alone?”
"What happened to his eye?" Mrs. Watson winced. It did look sore.
“I’ll be 17 in exactly 3 weeks.” Sherlock interrupted, taking his coat off and tossing it over a chair.
Truth be told, I was relieved to be away from John for a bit.
Sherlock was standing up near the table by this time. He looked at John darkly and sighed. "Well, as it turns out...my first year at uni, I...I had a few of the professors taken out."
“John?”
Jim and the bartender half carried and half walked Sherlock to an office in the back of the club, where they sat him in an upholstered chair. It was a small dark office, crowded with a desk and supplies for the club. An outside door was marked "Exit". After the bartender made sure Sherlock was still breathing, he walked out of the room.
Mycroft watched from afar as John met Sherlock half way up the block.
Oh yeah, the run down houses, the older model cars parked--his old neighborhood.
"I'm leaving." I stood up. I'm high now, but not so high that I don't understand his meaning. I'm high enough that I wouldn't consider this night ill spent.
Sherlock shrugged, “John, I…..”    he leaned forward and placed his right elbow on his right knee and leaned on his hand. John thought he looked sleepy, his half closed eyes not giving anything away.
The lights in the party flickered on and off just then and a cheer went up from the crowd.
"If I look so great why were you scowling?" She laughed and punched him playful in the arm.
Mrs. Hudson interrupted by knocking on the door and pushed it open holding a laden tea tray.
Mrs. Watson nodded, "He was instrumental in bringing Jim Moriarty to justice, for us and Harry." he mother said quietly.
Then again, there were other issues to address.
Jim continued and rolled his eyes.
