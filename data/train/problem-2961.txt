"Dean," Cas says directly to Dean's ear, even though the noise of the fair around them isn't that loud to require this level of mouth-to-ear closeness. "Dean they have bees. They have bee pins.
Cas just smiles sleepily at him. "Good morning Dean." But Dean can't reply because he just realized that Cas and Dean are both naked, in bed, together, after a night he can't remember much of. And Cas looks completely relaxed about it all.
Cas is staring at the cotton candy with suspicion, so Dean leans over and takes a bite out of it, to show him there's nothing scary about it. "'S jus' some sugar, Cas."
Jacket seems to agree with Castiel, nodding his head enthusiastically. “Right? Like I said, practically criminal. And so boring, too. Total bullshit.” He looks up in a panic, realizing he cursed in front of a stranger.
They’d heard Dean and the other man, Benny, say as much after Castiel planted a bug beneath the counter when he first ordered a drink. Dean seemed like a perfectly good person, yet he’s working for a man like Crowley, one of the most ruthless crime bosses in the city. Castiel doesn’t read people the best, and social cues are not his forte, but Dean has felt… warm. A truly warm and kind person, which made Castiel all the more confused as to why he’s working for Crowley.
“Well, hello there Charlie, how may I help you?” He patronizes, rolling his eyes at her expression. “Any particular reason you burst into my room like something’s on fire?”
“Yes.” Cass sounds uncomfortable again. “But right now, that is impossible for me to do. Unless you and Sam possess multiple reproductive organs.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean dismisses him with a wave. “You should be all over this. What happened to living like a bunny?”
“No.” Cass agrees, “But I saw his face when after the first ‘I love you.’ It horrified him, so I thought…”
“It’s not.” Dean rests his arm across the seat, close to his shoulder. “Lucifer had you. He was pissed to Hell that Chuck ditched him again. He got a few other angels too. He stole your grace.”
Slowly, he breaches the rim, pressing gently and lightly licking Castiel’s erection. After a few minutes Dean’s finger stills and he slowly draws it back, Castiel hisses, arching his back as new nerve endings are stimulated. Dean’s fingers slide past something inside him that makes him screech and fall, boneless, onto the bed. That fingers stills, still resting on the bundle of nerves that Castiel can only assume is his prostate. He keens, swirling his hips, trying to get Dean’s finger closer.
“Peace?” the alternate Dean spits. “This is what you call peace? Sitting in a house with the ghost of my best friend. Knowing that one day he’ll turn vengeful and I –
Dean can’t help what he does next. It’s a matter of reflex for him… relief. He presses a kiss to Cass forehead.
Clearing his throat, Dean looks away. “Maybe you were right not to say anything. I might not have been the most … accommodating had you brought this up a while ago.”
Right, like it’s only the edges that are burnt. Dean rolls his eyes, but sits silently, waiting for the angel to peel, serve and cut off the blackened pieces from his precious beet root.
just how much this is affecting him. His muscles are rock hard, pulled infinitely taut. His panicked breaths brush past Sam’s ear. Dean reeks of fear.
to let Adam hold the fort or risk insanity. He still feels guilty about that, but Adam had been so eager to help.
Dean wishes that this case could be over. He want to get back to the bunker. Maybe put some white drapes and Christmas lights up like the books suggests. White, silver and gold. Blue is supposed to be comforting too, like the sky.
In all their time together Dean had never said the words outright. He’d always say ‘I care,’ ‘you’re family,’ ‘I need you,’ or even mouthing it against his cheek, thinking that he wouldn’t notice. Of course he would, what else is there to notice?
He almost tells Cass that he should have let Dean play with the glasses. But that wouldn’t be fair would it? Cass is a child himself. He can’t be held responsible for Dean’s mistakes.
Reaching up, Castiel loosely cups his neck. “Or you can fuck me into the your memory foam mattress and see if remembers us.”
Perching near the edge of his bed, almost out of the camera’s view, Dean touches the coat gently, letting his shoulders sag.
Dean is having a pretty steamy dream, when he hears his door creak open. He tries to grasp the tendrils of the fast fading dream but to no avail.
Crowley chirps in this time, pausing at the edge of the circle to smirk. “Have you ever watched any Disney movie… like ever? The villain seems to succeed with his dastardly plan only to be done on my his incessant talking and low self-esteem which causes him to want to gloat. I thought better of you.”
Smiling, he wonders why he ever thought sitting here with Dean like this would change anything. “Or some bullshit.” He whispers.
Had he taken over while Dean was worrying about the weather on the surface? He lets out a breath… it feels like his own. But he can’t know… not for sure.
He hates Crowley for trying to profiteer off of Cass’ mistake. The bastard would have gotten both books if it weren’t for the warding in Baby.
Castiel wraps their hands together once more, this time, adding his own flare by kissing each finger tip. This time, Dean is the one left to watch, entranced as Cass stares unblinkingly at him while playing with his hair. Don’t even mention the way his fingers slide down Dean’s cheek down to his neck.
“The Empty has Cass.” He says, picking himself up off the ground. “Come on Sam… it ain't over till the fat lady sings”
So I had this entire fic completely planned. But then I had a better idea and decided to change it. Then, while poor unassuming me was writing this chapter... Crowley appeared! Out of nowhere. So that changes things.
“It’s one of your most charming traits second only to that luxurious mane,” Crowley says smugly. When Sam doesn’t take the bait, Crowley decides to cast the line at him again. “But fine. We can just sit here… and not talk about my ulterior motives.”
A group of kids dash past them almost causing Dean to drop his keys into the drain. He quickly shoves them into his pocket and mumbles a curse.
“And Dean will never know about my feelings. I know he doesn’t love me. Telling him would be pointless. But after what you said to me earlier, I let myself think. I let myself hope again and now I can’t stop hurting.”
“I love me a steak burger.” Dean says to break the intense glowering. It works, and Castiel’s full attention is directed to Dean once more.
“I know you can’t control when you come out of the lamp.” Dee whispers. “Sam’s just…” he breaks off, swallowing whatever he was about to say.
Cass’ arms enfold him, the angel’s chin digging into his shoulder and his arms cutting off Dean’s oxygen. His own arms squeeze back tightly, reassuring himself that this is real. That this is something he can have.
It’s been ten seconds and he can’t live with himself. Dean swallows harshly. He let himself get too accustomed to
“Au contraire.” Chuck pipes up. “You see –before things got all whooshy– I did a little bonding with Sam and Dean.”
“Oh no.” Alternate Castiel squishes his cheeks together, tilting his face left and right to inspect him. “No. No. I tried this like – thousands of times. But you like it right? Tell me you like it Dean!”
“I – I just thought that you should know. That – that things wouldn’t have changed. I know what it’s like, living with feelings that you don’t get to express. I don’t want that for you Cass.”
Dean pauses near the trunk, his hand curling into a fist. He glances back into the car, at Cass, who still makes no move to leave.
He moves away from Cass’ hug with a pinched smile. “I’m ashamed of this Cass… but I didn’t take care of you.” he sees the hurt in his friend’s eyes. “Not that I didn’t want to. It’s just – you were suddenly this delicate little flower and I had no clue what to do.”
Dean glances back helplessly. It wasn’t Sam’s fault he was driven mad. But that isn’t what Castiel needs to hear.
Lucifer just shrugs. By now, Cass’ coat has stopped burning, except for a few embers. Lucifer sheds it, tossing it into the burning car. Sam flinches.
“We were on a Ferris wheel.” Dean defends. “He was talking about movies and – and I just wanted him to have that.”
I know I haven't updated this one in a while so there's going to be a double update this week. The next one comes out on Friday! Enjoy!
Knowing Dean, he’d been obsessing over that revelation ever since. It’s probably what drove him to down an entire bottle of whiskey. But he managed to keep it together because… why the hell would he trust the word of some random creature over the phone? Now that Sam’s confirmed it, Dean looks like a wreck.
Mouth opening and closing wordlessly, Dean finally catches himself and rips the scissors from his grip. “This isn’t the way… this is mutilation.”
Dean can barely get his breathing under control enough to even try to reply. He hates thinking about it… having to worry about Cass seeing… anyone seeing. Because it’s a weakness; as vulnerable as a hunter could get.
Usually… he’d jump at the chance to hunt with Dean. But now? In the middle of a strange universe… stranded without their ride. Castiel doesn’t want to take the risk.
“Let me show you how much I love you.” he whispers, pressing kisses to each finger. Dean continues up his hand until he reaches Cass’ neck. Small moans are drawn out, echoing inside their box. Their grave. Their paradise.
“Are you happy?” He asks as he presses his face into Dean’s chest. They both sit on the couch, enjoying the smell of the pie as it becomes stronger with every passing minute.
“If we don’t stop looking into him,” Dean gulps. “He’s going to tell Cass that I’m in love with him.”
And just in the nick of time, Sam thinks. He feels the pearl starting to heat up in the cloth. He lays it on the table, careful not to let his fingers touch it.
“Then how are you living here in peace?” Dean demands. “When he went all celestial it, he made his presence known.” He gestures at Castiel.
Dean winces, a caught expression settling in. He bites his lip, looking away… looking at the toilet of all places. Maybe for some more shitty excuses.”
He carefully stands, his stomach churning as the water displaces. How can anyone stand to sleep in such a death trap?
But he can’t leave Dean standing outside either, not when the hunter made an effort to come find him after Cass had been so sour.
Sam is surprised that Dean hasn’t at least figured out that he makes Cass happy. All the evidence is there. They practically laid it out for him when they told him about the pearl trying to grant Cass’ wish (of happiness) only to bump into his deal with the Empty. Dean was the only one affected by Cass’ wish. But his brother knows how to be oblivious, almost as much as he does.
What? Castiel’s eyes dart back and forth in confusion. “You need me.” he breathes in realisation. “To keep the lights on.”
The sobs come every few seconds. He doesn’t bother trying to stop them. If he doesn’t sob he thinks he would explode. It had all been a mad rush, those last few moments, but the pain, he knows, will never abate.
And that’s it. The breaking point. He doesn’t care if his captor knows. He just wants out. He wants to stop feeling this way.
Dean kisses Cass goodnight and Sam almost drops him in shock. Dean doesn’t kiss babies goodnight… not that sweetly… not like he’d actually expect to miss the little rug rat after only one night.
Stiffening, Castiel expects him to storm straight out of the room and not come back. But then Dean’s hand hovers in his periphery and he flinches, half expecting to be thrown across the room.
“Well.” Castiel says slowly. “Traditionally people who live together, share mailing addresses and thus a mail box.”
All of a sudden a bright light breaks through their relaxation. At first he thinks that it’s another version of Cass in with a might glowing halo. The he realises what he’s seeing. He almost kicks Sam in the face at the sight… and oh how his brother’s bloody nose would be worth it for this sight.
They sit at the kitchen table, and Dean is halfway through his first slice when Castiel breaks the silence.
“Mmmmm,” Michael’s head is resting on Dean’s shoulder, his hands now massaging the hips he had been clamping down on moments ago. “Welcome to my home, Dean.”
Dean was in his second year of college when Sammy presented. Alpha, as John expected of both his sons. He’s never let Dean forget what a disappointment he was as an omega male. John focuses all of his attention on Sammy. Sammy’s going places. Sammy’s going to do great things. Sammy’s going to be somebody, not just shack up and make babies. Dean was carrying a full course load in addition to a full-time job and work-study program, all while maintaining a solid GPA, but he might as well be sitting around fucking off for all John cared. He loads all of Sam’s chores onto Dean, in addition to Dean’s other responsibilities.
A crease mars his brow, and a low moan escapes him. Slowly moving to consciousness, he kicks the blankets off, suddenly too hot. The ache in his head is persistent, but it’s quickly losing its slot as Dean’s Number One Discomfort to the roiling in his gut. He swallows and his eyes fly open. Scrambling, he just makes it to the bathroom before he’s heaving over the toilet. Dinner was long enough ago that it’s mostly bile, but the cramps are threatening to rip him apart. Of course, the pressure caused by the heaving only exacerbates the throbbing in his head, and he groans as he rests his cheek on the cool tiles of the floor. What the actual fuck is this? He hasn’t felt this bad since he first presented. That heat had been...heat. He scrambles to his feet and rushes across the room to the pile of textbooks that serves as his night table. With shaking hands, he opens the HeatTrak app on his phone.
"Maybe he'll sell it to me next time." Dean dries his hands and leaves the kitchen, Sam staring at him like he just can't believe what a dumbass his big brother can be.
Dean is able to sit up enough to see that Jimmybean has been given one of Cas’ shirts. “I fucked up, Gabe.”
Dean's quite proud of himself for not freaking straight out when Cas proposed. Fortunately, his brain had short-circuited, leaving him rooted to the spot as he watched Cas talk to JB, as if he hadn't just dropped a bomb on Dean's entire life. Gods, he wanted to say 'yes' to Cas, but he can't. Cas thinks that JB is his nephew. He thinks Dean was married to Jimmy. He has no idea that Dean's just a lying sack who didn't have any options after being abandoned while pregnant. "Gods, Jimmy. I've fucked up."
Castiel walks him over to the register and starts scanning his purchases. The store has mostly cleared out while they were talking, now it’s just a few stragglers making final decisions. “So Dean, would you like to join our Insider program?”
Gabe lets himself into his hotel room later that evening, juggling a bag of takeout, a six pack, and his phone, on which his brother is video calling him.
"Sorry to burst your bubble there, Jim, but I'm alone because I chose to be. Trust me, the alternative is worse."
Without missing a beat, Cas shifts his attention to Dean’s earlobe. In a voice that would probably make him a decent living as a phone sex operator, he growls in his ear. “Oh no, Dean. After your little stunt in the shower last night, I lack the patience to truly torment you tonight.”
“Oh yeah? Which hotline did you give him?” Dean loves a good prank, and Pam had some really niche hotlines saved.
Dean comes home from work and finds a handmade ornament in his mailbox. “Welcome to the neighborhood,” written in some fancy handwriting across a scroll curled underneath a building that looks just like his duplex. He grins, gently nestles it on top of his mail and duffel, and goes inside.
This year is shaping up to be one of Those Years. Finding Eileen's perfect gift this year is difficult. She and Sam just welcomed their first baby in September, and Dean wanted to give her something special. He already had the “World's Best Mom/Dad” novelty mugs, and a brewery tour booked for him and Sam. He needed something great for Eileen to finish up his shopping. He'd offer one of those “free babysitting, whenever” coupons, but he was enamored of the tiniest moose ever and had a standing offer to take him off their hands whenever they needed some alone time.
“No! I mean. Yes! Yes, this is totally okay, Cas.” And Dean sees that he was right about Cas’ smile. He’s sunk. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do to keep that smile trained on him.
“I’ll be good, Alpha, I promise,” Dean whimpers. The angle is a bit uncomfortable, but if it gets him railed, he’s all for it.
The man clears his throat, and Dean realizes that he’s been staring. He huffs out a laugh and rubs the back of his neck, trying to hide his embarrassment. “So-” he looks at the name tag on Sexy Eyes Guy’s shirt “Castiel...what do you recommend?”
“Now little one, how are we feeling today? Still cranky? Let’s give Daddy a little break, okay? He really needs to get some sleep so he can take good care of you.” Jimmybean just stares up at him with his big green eyes and yawns before laying his head against Cas’ chest. If he could bottle the euphoria that having this tiny human trust him to keep him safe gives him, he could probably cure some forms of depression. Before Dean and Jimmybean, he’d never seriously entertained the idea of children of his own. He spent most of his time working or in his own head. When he did “date,” it was always superficial at best. Now, these last couple months with Dean and Jimmybean have shown him a whole different way to live. He would gladly take a bullet for either of them. Even the thought of them in danger is enough to have a low growl vibrating in his chest. Rather than disturbing the baby, JB seems to find the sensation relaxing, and he is soon dozing against Cas’ chest. Cas presses a soft kiss against his head and heads to his office. If JB’s going to nap, he’s got work to do.
Castiel squints at the screen, trying to discern Jellybean’s eye color from the photo he’s got pulled up. “Different?”
Seven o’clock has Cas at Dean’s door, his ornament in a festive gift bag. He’d had just enough time after finishing his project to take a quick shower, so his hair was going in all directions and he was sporting two days’ worth of five o’clock shadow. The nice thing about the current trends being what they were meant that his habitual stubble and bedhead was considered “stylish,” rather than “I hit snooze too many times this morning.” He knocks on Dean’s front door, a grin splitting his face.
The kitchen’s not terrible. Sammy must have done some of the tidying up after dinner and so Dean loads the dishes into the dishwasher and sets it to run. He checks the fridge to see if he needs to add anything else to the grocery list. Grabs a slice of leftover pizza and stuffs it in his mouth as he walks down the hallway to check on Sammy. He finds him asleep with a book open on his chest and his lamp on. He turns off the light and continues to his own room.
Dean’s newfound optimism is short-lived. While it doesn’t exactly crash and burn, it does hit a patch of turbulence and sink a bit. Apartments are expensive in this part of town. And since it’s the middle of the term, all of the campus housing is full. There are a couple of studios he could afford, but they’re not going to be open for a few months. He puts his name on every waiting list he can and hopes for the best.
hadn’t gone digital) is a round of wood with a flaming chili pepper modge-podged onto it. He squints at it momentarily before memories of his college days kick in, and he doesn’t know whether to groan or laugh. In the end, the sound that escapes him is a mixture of both.
The lightweight knit blanket goes over Dean, of course. Some of Dean’s clothes in the drawers so he can go home in actual pants. A pile of onesies (he
He’d only meant to close his eyes for a moment, really. Just long enough to stave off the headache he felt brewing behind them. Of course, this meant that he woke up several hours later, face smashed into his textbook and a champion crick in his neck. Too tired to be truly disgusted with himself, he shuffles to the laundry room to put the wet stuff in the dryer, then goes back to his room to go to bed. Dean’s not the master of self-care by any stretch of the imagination, but he recognizes when his body is demanding a change of pace.
For a while, Dean believed him. He fell into a funk. His grades dropped and he hardly went to class. He thanks the gods that Dr. Moseley had bothered to track him down at home and read him the riot act for “wasting his potential” and “what kind of example are you setting for that brother of yours?” Dean didn’t give a damn about himself (thanks, Dad), but fuck if he was going to let Sammy think that his secondary gender presentation would dictate his life.
“That’s not all, either.” She reaches into her pocket and hands him a neatly folded fifty dollar bill. “He insisted I give this to you. He said to tell you to treat yourself.”
The next day starts as usual. Coffee, breakfast, research, supply check. Dean's feeling like a pot roast for dinner, so he makes a quick list and grabs Baby's keys.
And now he needs brain bleach, because the idea of his brother and his best friend rage fucking has been seared into his brain. Sam officially hates everything.
Castiel is momentarily put out. “Why do you get to be the cool uncle? Jimmy’s my twin, that should automatically make me the cool uncle.” He’d complain more, if he weren’t absolutely enthralled with the small human in the new photographs. “He needs those little feet things. His feet will get cold.”
“Are you sure, Cas? I don’t want him to get in your way while you’re working.” Dean’s fighting that battle that every first time parent has with themselves: the desire to just have an hour to themselves warring against the guilt of not being attached to your child 24/7.
mate and child sleeping soundly. Quietly, Cas draws all of the curtains closed, dimming the room. At a whimper from the sofa, he glances over to find JB stirring in Dean’s grasp. Knowing that Dean hasn’t slept well since Jimmybean stopped sleeping regularly, Cas tries to will the infant back to sleep. As if he senses him, JB’s eyes pop open and he stares at Cas. Cas freezes in place.
Dean’s more than happy to move the conversation into food. Less likely to be awkward for both of them. “Can’t go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger. Goes with everything.” He takes the rest of his order, returns the menu to its place, and moves down the bar to pull the draft he ordered with his burger.
The eyes are not alone. There’s also a cheeky little smile on what he can now see is a felt taco. “Let’s taco ‘bout Christmas,” it says, and Dean laughs so hard he drops his duffel. When he can breathe without dissolving into giggles, he collects the rest of his mail and his dropped duffel and goes inside. He grabs a beer from the fridge before heading upstairs for that scalding hot shower, because Dean Winchester can multitask like a fucking
Dean doesn’t remember ever being this exhausted before. Sure, he’s been tired, he’s been sick, he’s been sick and tired, but there’s always an end in sight to that kind of tiredness. Jimmybean decided that sleep was for the weak, and Dean can’t remember the last time he slept more than fifteen minutes at a time. He’s about to invest in a new baby carrier because he’s wearing this one almost 24/7, and it could really stand a wash.
The guy laughs. “It’s not the most awkward conversation I’ve ever had, but I suppose I deserved it for trying to convince a manager to hand out employee information.”
As he handed off his current customer to a cashier, he scanned the store for anyone in need of assistance. At this time of year, there were many new customers in addition to the frequent shoppers, and they were extremely easy to spot. Ah, yes. Over there in the skincare section, a single man in a leather jacket. Must be shopping for his girlfriend or wife. It was Castiel’s experience that many (not all, mind you) men were still averse to the benefits of proper skincare. It was as if they felt it impugned on their masculinity or some such bullshit to slather their face in clay and just relax for a few minutes. He shrugged mentally and walked over towards his target, reading an easy sale. “Can I help you find anything?” He's all but oozing customer service and professionalism, ready to point him towards their selections of gift sets, until the guy starts rambling about a new mom Christmas gift for his sister in law. So, not here for a wife or girlfriend then.
“Thank you,” he mouths silently, for the benefit of the person on the phone, or the sleeping baby, Dean doesn’t know. He doesn’t care, because at that moment Cas licks his lips, chasing stray juice. Dean has
Castiel pulls up the photos and gasps. He would die for the small bundle in the photo. Would kill for him. He wants to hold him close and protect him. He wants—no,
“Yep!” He lists all of the things he brought with him and what he did with them. Jody gives her approval and walks him to the nursery. Gabe is practically bouncing with nerves and excitement. He hasn’t seen his nephew since they admitted him and Dean, and he’s psyched to get to actually meet the baby. His face is almost pressed against the glass, watching Jody as she lifts a small blue sausage-shaped bundle into her arms before she turns to leave the nursery. Gabe’s at the door when she comes out, making “gimme” motions with his hands.
. He wants a cold beer, a scalding hot shower, and about 14 hours’ worth of quality time with his memory foam, in that exact order. Cas’ porch light is on, so he must still be at work. Dean’s trying  to figure out what kind of pun to put on his next ornament. He spent most of his (rare) down time at the station on Pinterest, searching for ideas, and he’s not ashamed to admit that he’s got quite an extensive crafting folder now, neatly organized by occasion. Once he’s had his siesta, he’s making a trip to the art supply store. His family is all getting Dean Winchester Originals for Christmas this year.
Not a single solitary one of those bastards could be bothered to at least lie to him and give him a false negative. Nope, it’s all right there, in triplicate in case once wasn’t enough to get through his thick skull.
Hands grasp at his arms and legs, restraining him. If he were coherent, he’d be kind of proud that it took several people to hold him down (take
“Try them? They’re not for me, why do I need to try them?” Castiel can’t tell if Dean’s trying to be a dick, or if he’s honestly curious.
"Dean, what are you doing? It's not that bad, I got the biodegradable glitter so it could just be washed or swept out of-"
An accomplished flirt himself, Dean lets loose with a full-body laugh. “You comin’ on to me, Cas? I’m not that kind of girl. You’ve got to at least buy me dinner, first.”
Quickly, Cas grabs the discarded baby carrier and slips it over his shoulders, securing the waist belt behind him. He leans down and gently picks JB up, slipping him into the carrier and securing him in place. He checks to make sure there’s adequate air flow and that Jimmybean is comfortable before grabbing the throw from the back of the sofa and draping it over Dean’s sleeping form. He barely resists planting a soft kiss on Dean’s now-smooth brow, but he’s afraid of waking him. Instead, he rubs circles on JB’s back and quietly closes the doors to the living room.
Michael just sighs and rolls his eyes. “Dean, Dean, Dean. You act as if I’d leave you in the lurch. This place is paid up through the end of the month. I’m not such an ass that I’d leave a defenseless omega on their own with no fall back.”
“Cas, are you humming-” Cas sinks around his cock and swallows rapidly. “Oh god-Cas-” he winks at Dean again, and that’s it. Dean is Officially Done. His hands clench in Cas’ hair as he comes, mouth open on a silent moan, head thrown back, eyes closed in pleasure. No sooner does his cock stop kicking than he feels Cas climb back on top of him.
Definitely worth it for the results, though. This time, he'd modge-podged two beer bottles, tilted towards each other in a toast. It had taken several (
Dumping his messenger bag on the kitchen table (what, it’s Friday, sue him), Cas goes into his second bedroom where his office/creative space is. From his scrap bin he pulls bits and pieces of felt, some fluff, and plugs in his glue gun.
“Marry me, Dean. Let me be JB's alpha dad. Let's be a family." He kisses Dean gently. "You don't have to answer now. I just wanted you to know my intentions. You can say yes tomorrow." Cas kisses him again and crosses to Jimmybean’s crib. He's awake, but sleepily gnawing on his fist in a way that suggests he'd be happy to go back to sleep. "Put in a good word for me, kiddo. Daddy cares about what you think. I just asked him to marry me, which means we'd be a family. I'd be your alpha daddy, and you'd be my son, too. It sounds great to me, how about you?"
Gabriel’s suddenly deadly serious. The last they’d heard from the doctors, Dean was still unconscious. Gabe hadn’t seen him since he’d been admitted. “Is he okay? What happened?”
Dean looks at the card. On the card is Castiel’s name and phone number and the words “For a good time, call.” He snorts out a laugh.
The phone barely rings when a panicked Gabe answers. "Dean! Where the hell are you? What the fuck happened? Cas is out cold on the bathroom floor!"
, omega stereotypes!) but as it was, his only concerns were for his baby and Jimmy. “Where are they?! Where’s my baby! Where’s Jimmy?!” He’s so busy thrashing that he doesn’t notice a nurse emptying a syringe into his IV.
"Right. And Cas is the baby. Now let me finish. What I was trying to say, before you opened your big mouth-"
After dinner, it's  Cas' turn to pen Dean in a room and make him listen. He comes armed with a duck stuffy for Jimmybean, because he simply couldn't resist it, and a simple bouquet of wildflowers for Dean. He knew guys in general don’t get a lot of flowers, and he intended to correct that lack in Dean’s life.
After Cas returns from his French vacation, Dean slows down on banishings. He manages almost two whole months before he poofs Cas to another random location. No matter what Sam says, Dean was not being childish.
The first store he hits is JCPenney. There, he picks up a super comfortable set of pajamas for Eileen and a couple of shirts for himself. Next is Bath and Body Works. The women he knows enjoy relaxing bubble baths, and this place has dozens of scents to choose from. He picks out a couple of candles and three different bubble baths. When he notices the “buy 3, get one free” sign, he grabs a bubble bath for himself.
“Uh, well Cas, I’m almost done unpacking, and I’m sure you’re about to be very busy with-” he gestures at the messenger bag that is clearly testing the bonds of its stitching riding at Cas’ hip “all of that. I’ll let you get to it.” He turns to go back inside, then snaps his fingers and turns back to Cas. “Thanks for the ornament, by the way. It’s a nice welcome-wagon gift.” He smiles at Cas as he waves, stepping back inside his side of the duplex. “Bye, Cas! See ya around!”
Dean bites his lip before leaning further across the table. “I’d be lying if I told you I haven’t been thinking about it.”
Michael’s nostrils flare, and Dean continues. “Been thinking about talking you into my back seat since you first came in. Fog the windows up, test the shocks. She doesn’t have a/c, so it’d be really,” he exhales on a moan “hot.” He sits back down, shooting a cocky grin across the table and slinging his arm over the top of the bench seat.
“Oh, come on, Samantha. you can do better than that.” Crowley pouts at him. “Something with a bit more flair.”
Michael laughs at their stunned expressions. “Now, I didn’t do this all just for kicks and giggles. The thing is, my poor, paranoid vessel Dean has a habit of trying to kick me or trap me. I find it easier to reign him in when he can believe any of the alterations to his world. Boy, some of the hallucinations you three have given him. You should be happy for him. Let him escape your toxic hold and live a little. Dean is
His hand flies up and down his cock, his breaths now coming out in pants as he gets even closer to the edge.
He feels his head loll back as Crowley manhandles him. It turns everything upside down, but gives him an unimpeded view of Dean who is bringing up the rear.
Unphased by her anger, he carries on talking. “Oh, I didn’t do anything.” Crowley pretends to be offended. “In fact, I think they did this to themselves.”
Castiel vividly remembers the green and yellow plaid that he’d worn to the convention. This shirt is white, pure white in fact with hints of silver and gold flecks. It’s more of a dress shirt than a jersey really though it does have a Nero style collar. This reminds Castiel of what kings had worn hundreds of years ago. Elegant and majestic… something that separated them from mere men.
Castiel is taken aback. Those tablets have been Crowley’s long-time obsession, for him to just cast it aside…
“Does fellato scare you?” he wonders. Dean still seems to want to play his fantasy out. To a certain extent. Castiel takes a deep breath and glances at Dean then, waiting for his answer.
“You just want to turn him into a mini-Dean.” Teases Sam. “You know he’s not going to stay like this forever right.”
How does it take Dean so long to pee? He’s pretty sure his brother must be hearing the screams wherever he may be in the bunker.
“They’re stunning Cass. Better than all the seven wonders combined. They’ve just taken a bit of damage is all.” He knows his breathy his voice sounds, but Dean remains in his trance-like state, not wanting to look away. “Can I touch them now?”
Not that they’ve had sex yet. Dean still isn’t comfortable moving past an under the clothes hand-job and wanking off next to each other. When that happens, he still has to reach over and take care of Cass’ problem… since they’re still not sure what’s causing that.
He doesn’t know much about Cass’ time with the reaper, but he certainly hopes that he at least got to an orgasm. But then, shouldn’t he know what to do with his dick if he had?
Never, in a million years, would Sam have thought that he wouldn’t be happy to see the real big, Cass. But he feels his heart from and the pearl fall from his slackened grip.
Yeah, this time hurt way more than the first, but Dean is determined to get to the bottom of things.
It’s one last goodbye or the first ‘hello’ of their new lives. Something to remember; not for the quality or passion behind the kiss itself, but for the unity and comfort it allows when everything around him feels like it’s crumbling.
Castiel studies him for a moment. “You made the wrong choice though – the selfish choice.” Dean gulps. “I wish you would have done the same thing here.”
Where Dean once stood by his side for thousands of years, he now sticks to his brother like glue, disregarding everyone else completely. Maybe the fact that Dean is obtuse with everyone that leaves him with the tiniest speck of hope.
With a few clicks, he’s logged into the bunker’s security system. He breathes a sigh of relief. The Impala is parked safely in the garage. Right under the view of the camera apparently, lucky Sam. He’s just about to exit the app when he sees movement. Huh. Dean and Cass are still in the car.
He watches from behind the wall as Dean creeps slowly down the stairs, ensuring that his footfalls are almost silent. Stranger still is huge bag strapped to his back… if Sam didn’t know better he’s say its… moving?
“Hey, do you think it’s hot in here?” Dean squirms, tugging at the collar of his shirt. “Cass, I um…” Dean pushes Cass off of him and coughs, “Get Sam.” He rasps, “I can’t –” Sam doesn’t waste any time after seeing Dean clutching at his throat, he takes off, dashing down the hall.
But Castiel feels the object grow warm in his hands, smoke spills from the tip, floating to the ground. This Dean looks nervous – almost scared – while Sam calmly draws his gun.
Cass is taking his anger out on the trees. That’s something. He’s still in control. Dean can do this.
Cass is floating on a cloud of bliss. His hands don’t know what to do, his other body parts share the sentiment.
“I would have called you… I planned to in fact, the moment that Billie locked me in and I knew that there was no way to turn back. Then I’d call you.”
Jacket, the name Castiel had given the man since he always wore a leather jacket, glances in his direction. Castiel dives back behind his book, narrowly avoiding Jacket catching him staring. The last thing Castiel needs is Jacket claiming to be uncomfortable with the way he looks at him.
“Y- yeah,” Dean stammers, face bright red. Why does his throat feel dry all of a sudden? “What can I get you?”
Dean nearly jumps out of his skin, not having heard the man approaching. Damn, someone needed to put a bell on the man because he had nearly given Dean a heart attack. Barely resisting the urge to glare at the man, heart thumping in his chest. “Dude, not cool.“ Trenchcoat merely blinks at him. “You scared the crap out of me. No, what were you saying?”
Was he obvious? Did Dean pick up on his crush? He thought he did a good job acting indifferent, but what if-
Dean had nodded vaguely, too stunned to say anything, prepared the order, and slid it across the counter to Trench Coat’s outstretched hand. The man had thanked him and walked away to sit in a corner booth.
"You two are a sweet couple," an old lady working a stall for homebrewed beer tells them. "Been together long?"
Castiel pauses outside of the door, trying to erase the image of vibrant green eyes and a flirtatious grin.
“‘Course he does, he sent me.” Benny sets his glass down, business face on. “He needs you to deliver something for a patron that’ll be coming here tomorrow.”
He has a killer hangover, the hangover from hell. That's what he gets for trying to get Cas truly drunk; the dude can
Crown Prince Dean Winchester leaves his room and his phone behind, not knowing Castiel Novak, fifth son of the Noble Novak family, has texted him back.
Cas rolls his eyes at him, taking Dean's chin with his hand (woah) and bringing their faces closer and whispers, breath hot over Dean's lips, "the one on the stand with the green plushie of the small bat-child that speaks oddly."
Dean watches those baby blues sweep him up and down before the guy licks his lips and turns away. Yup, definitely checking him out. Dean’s night just got a hell of a lot better.
“Are you sure?” Dean is shifting and bunching his shoulders, clearly uncomfortable. “We can do this another time, I assure you. We’re open all week.”
Dean Winchester, how fitting. Castiel smiles to himself. There’s a nagging feeling at the back of his head, one that’s telling him that he’s forgetting something important like eating or wearing pants before going out. He’s sure it’ll come to him eventually, so he pushes it into the recesses of his mind and concentrates on Dean. Cas quickly fills in the rest of the application with the required information, such as date of birth and age. He also goes over the maximum amount of books that can be borrowed at one time.
“Fine,” Dean snaps, opening his eyes and drawing Charlie’s attention to him. “You can look him up, do the whole background check thing. I don’t want to know what you find out, but if it’ll make you feel better, then okay.”
Dean mouths his name before nodding to himself and grinning. “Well, thanks for the book, Cas.” Then he turns and walks out of the library while Castiel buries his face in his hands.
“Another scotch on the rocks please, and red wine for my partner, if you have any,” Trenchcoat requests with a small smile.
He's grinning by the time they leave the stall. Cas is looking at him funny, but he just shrugs. "We're a couple," he tells him.
“-like tree trunks, yeah, I was there.” Charlie grimaces, and Dean can’t blame her. They were both very drunk when they had that talk. “I regret saying that, by the way.”
“No, I know what a library card is,” Jacket interrupts, seeming sheepish. He rubs the back of his neck and is staring at the book in his hand intently. “Just… been a while since I had to think about this kind of stuff.”
“What the hell, Dean?” Charlie is glaring at him, where he’s sitting on the edge of his bed, phone in hand. The text he sent just moments ago is forgotten when he looks up at her in her “
. This is bad, really bad. Almost as bad as that time Dean tried dating outside of Crowley’s “choice of quality women” and nearly got an innocent woman killed. Maybe worse.
It wasn’t until Dean decided to make a move that he realized how deeply his crush for Cas ran. Dean decided he would finally talk to Cas by attempting to borrow a book he had found (the author, James Milton, was fucking amazing and helped Dean out a lot with finding himself over the years.)  He had just wanted to talk to Cas but quickly realized that Cas wasn’t just a hot librarian but was also nice and clueless as to who Dean was. Dean hadn’t met too many people who didn’t give a shit who he was, so he had done the only thing he could think of and asked Cas out.
Benny raises his drink in mock salute and chuckles. After a few moments, Dean risks another nervous glance in Trenchcoat’s direction. The man is consumed by the file he’s reading, staring at it with a frown and a clenched jaw. Another man, a tall bald guy with dark skin in a similar suit to Trenchcoat’s approaches the booth and taps on the tabletop. Trenchcoat lifts his gaze and nods, exchanging quiet words with Baldy before the man sits down and plucks Trenchcoat’s drink from his hand, finishing the glass in one go.
"I love you," Cas says, and Dean's drunken heart stops. He looks over to Cas, mouth dry, but Cas is looking reverently at the cotton candy, which Dean is suddenly really hating. Fuck cotton candy.
“It’s free of charge,” Castiel tries, slightly confused. “If you’d like, we could make you one right now.”
Dean is not ashamed to admit he thought about that ever since Cas said yes. “That shirt you said makes my arms look-”
Satisfied with himself he parks and shuts off the engine, pocketing the keys immediately. Finally Dean Winchester had succeeded in
“Do you even need to ask?” He pins Sam with a stare. “I thought everything in there was real. That you died and disintegrated years ago and that we were breathing your remains. He made me forget everything and myself. I can never forgive him for that. And the worst part?
Sam doesn’t see what Cass does next but he definitely sees the way Dean’s eyes soften and he smiles, “Fine. They get to stay.”
“And not because you want to ‘protect’ Dean as you so valiantly claim.” Crowley continues. “It’s because you want it, for the sake of wanting it.”
Cass perches on the edge of Dean’s bed. They’ve been in this exact position before. Dean’s knees pressing up against his own and his coat hanging off the edge of the bed.
A sob wrenches from his chest and he tries to swallow it, only to end up choking. He has no more room inside him to hide anything anymore.
Sam finds himself distracted the next day, too busy keeping an eye on Dean and Cass to accomplish anything major.
“Do you know where it is?” Crowley asks. Despite being the one confined, Crowley insists on acting like he’s the interrogator here. Apparently, Sam is too stunned by his slip up to stop him.
Cass might be happy with him now. But as soon as he got his grace back, he’d go out, hunt Lucifer… punish him. And Dean wouldn’t be able to follow him down that road – not any more.
Dean is about to whip out his phone to call him when he notices that Cass’ phone is out on the counter. “Damn it.” he mutters.
“Snow White’s prince released her from the coffin.” He says, keeping his voice emotionless. “I kept Dean locked in his.”
It leaves Dean feeling lost, not being the one in control of the situation. But he’d seen a similar look on Cass face as they were speaking. A lost, fish-out-of-water look that pained Dean to witness.
Cass sighs, twisting out of Dean’s grip to face him slightly. “She left me with enough grace that treatment would soothe it into it’s natural shape once more.”
Numbly, Sam nods. He doesn’t see any other option. Clearly, Dean had lost his mind. Cass had lost himself and Sam… well …
Sam almost feels bad for him. Dean’s probably never told a soul that he loves them in his life. He’s said it to Sam once. But even before that, Dean kept it to himself. Sam knew. Of course, Dean loves him, but, it was really nice to hear him say it.
So was Dean. He’d felt the words coming out of his mouth like he wasn’t even in control. ‘Time for me to hang up my hat, Sammy.’ His brother hadn’t expected him to stick with his decision and truth be told, Cass played a large part in that. He couldn’t imagine wanting – or even enjoying – staying at his cottage all alone. If Cass had wanted to head back, Dean was almost sure he would have followed.
Nah, he decides, he’ll save that for if he catches them again. Curiosity does gnaw at him. Why would Cass break his promise? Does he really think that Sam will just keep on believing that Cass is kidding if he keeps saying it?
The answer is clear on Dean’s burning face. But, Castiel reminds himself. Dean is a sexual being, this might be nothing out of the ordinary for him.
Cass seems persistent though and he raises the slice of pie, mostly balancing on his palm with the insides leaking out. “To us, Dean.”
who wanted to scream them, if only to free them from the box. He berates himself for not chanting them, along with Dean.
“Don’t mojo it back up.” He says softly, moving up to press a kiss to the angel’s lips. “Enjoy the afterglow with me.”
“Adam.” Michael says sternly. His tone is enough to scare Adam into silence for the first time since their first meeting. “I said no.”
The first thought that comes to mind is Cass trying to figure out the technique to braiding. But Dean hasn’t mentioned Cass once since seeing him. That’s highly unusual for Dean, so Sam won’t bring him up until Dean does.
“Chuck – Chuck was livid.” He breathes, staring down at his hands. “That Sam had died and that I wasn’t the one to kill him.” Dean gulps. “And I had a plan. A
Castiel slowly finds his way back to himself. For a short moment he thought that he’d been banished.
“Doctor.” Dean says in greeting, eyeing the new outfit in delight. Cass in a doctor’s outfit. Damn. He’s been trying to get Cass to play Doctor/Patient almost as long as he’s been trying to get him to play cowboys.
He wonders if the continents had shifted during their tenure. Whether they were now encased in solid rock, or molten lava. He doesn’t have enough power to save them from either. Maybe the box should remain closed. What if he opened it… onto to have Dean fall into a vat of lava, burning once more for an eternity. Castiel would never forgive himself.
Crowley wedges his way past the grinding, sweating bodies of the snivelling teenage humans, cursing all the way. Of course!
“Nah.” He says, leaning on the door, “I’m trying to save just a little of my dignity. Although, send someone in with clothes. If I bend over right now, I don’t think I’ll be coming back up for a while.”
Anticipation has his body trembling, his cock leaking and neglected on his thigh. He doesn’t mind, a couple strokes and he suspects he’ll come. No, he wants to wait, until Dean is fully inside him.
“That isn’t in the cards for me man.” He rubs his knee, “I don’t want that hassle. I’m content with just you and me here. Maybe Sam if he comes to visit.”
“Well… here we have it.” he gestures at the pair. “Maybe this universe is different. Maybe everyone is amicable here?” he offers.
“Is this something that you enjoy Dean?” Cass wonders, inquisitive as ever. “From what I know of your love-making style – both in person and from what I’ve read from Chuck’s books –”
“You’re static.” Amara lets her thorough disdain show, she’s played on Castiel’s insecurities once before and it had worked splendidly. “You are disrupting my connection to Dean. Do you know what humans do when there’s static Castiel?” her glowing fingers press to his temples, her next words are blurred, “They change the frequency.”
to get back in, comfort him, tell him he loves him. And Dean does – love him, that is. The feelings are crystal clear now, but they aren’t real. This is Chuck, manipulating them into feeling this way. Probably to satisfy all the ‘shippers’ who rant and rave about Destiel.
Dean watches his, bewitched, making slow circles with his index finger. Enjoying the way Castiel twitches and trembles. Castiel’s cock is flushed and a small puddle of pre-cum is collected near his slit. Dean masterfully swipes it away with his thumb and spreads it over the remainder of Castiel’s erection with ease. His other finger continues to twist and stroke. The intensity of the feeling is overpowering, even to an angel.
Immediately he just thinks that paranoia is controlling him. What reason would Dean – even simulation Dean – have to plant a hex bag during a case; a haunting at that? It makes no sense. Nothing feels real anymore. Not him. Not this house. Not Dean. Not that shitty bone!
“I have to ask.” His tone is carefully probing. “An angel and a demon. I’ve never heard of that, even in my universe.”
Sam retrieves the pearl from his pocket and holds it up. There’s the tiniest jagged line curving around the pearl.
“It’s fine,” Castiel says, his voice cracking embarrassingly. If he hadn’t caught himself, he might have pressed his lips to Dean’s on pure instinct.
Castiel indulges Dean for a bit, letting him rut against his thigh only to stop just as he was close. Then he once more wrapped his lips around Dean. His member throbbing wildly in Castiel’s mouth, jerking slightly with every brush of his tongue. Dean’s pre-come leaks freely, leaving a saline taste on the back of Castiel’s throat. The molecules taste like Dean. Once more, Dean pulls away when he feels himself nearing an orgasm, bracing his hands against the wall and screwing his eyes shut harshly. His cock is flushed and swollen, more red than pink now really.
“I know.” Dean says, glancing to his side, where Sam assumes Cass is standing. “But you’re the one doing it. Not Cass. Sorry Cass.”
Flushing, Dean ducks his head. “I know. I mean – I’ve had this fantasy for a while. But I think it’s best we just stick to-”
Dean is just cleaning off his second whole pie when Castiel clears his throat. He knows that, given the chance, Dean would continue until either he finishes the pies, or he dies of a blockage in his bloodstream. Good thing Castiel is right at his side; a shot of grace would do the trick.
“The moving truck says they’ll be by in a few hours.” Comments Dean. He’d ditched his suit jacket as soon as they’d drifted away from civilization. Such a
Steeling himself, he clears his throat, as Cass scoots into position. Dean still perches on the end of the bed in indecision. If he’s doing this he doesn’t want to sound uncomfortable and ruin the whole thing for Cass. It’s not that he’s grossed out… Dean just thinks that some lines in a friendship shouldn’t be crossed. And yeah, the idea of being with a guy makes him squeamish.
He’s back to his hunter persona. A macho man with no attachments and an unhealthy obsession with the well-being of his brother.
Maybe it isn’t working because Castiel is holding back the biggest secret of all: his love for Dean.
“Look.” He says, hoping to let him down easy at least… less chance of something coming to bite him in the ass. “I get that you’re having your ‘Crowley Reimagined’ phase, but I came here for a reason and no chick is gonna even look at me twice with you all up in my space.”
“Let’s go for a drive.” Sam suggests, trying to look lively enough to motivate Castiel into going. “It’ll help you clear your head.”
The terrible two, Sam likes to call them. Inseparable and deadly. Just like the real Dean and Cass actually. Hmm. Some things don’t change.
Sam tries to put on his best ‘startled expression.’ He knows that Dean is worried about this, and usually he’d pick his brother first and foremost. But by keeping Cass’ feelings from him, he’s ensuring that Dean keeps Cass as a friend. He doesn’t know what Dean would do without Cass. So, technically, he is helping Dean. While helping Cass.
“Assuming you aren’t lying to me… how do we send you back?” Sam questions, “We need to do it before my Dean sees you and wants to keep you.”
Lips press against his open mouth with Cass reaching inside to stroke his tongue. His mind shatters, splintering off into different directions. Cass is kissing him. Cass is staring at him with lust filled eyes. They’re just friends right?
“No you didn’t.” Dean agrees. “But I realised that asking you a question kind of forces you to answer. That’s not really fair.”
Oh, it’s about to get juicy, Dean can tell. He balances the sheets on his side, and leans closer to the open doorway to get a better look.
The little shack they approach is pretty nice. It’s got warding all around, some, Dean can’t even recognise. And it isn’t just haphazardly painted on, someone took their time and crafted this to look aesthetic. Maybe him and Sam live here, that’s why the smell of pie is everywhere.
Dean feels sick. This mirrors the conversation he and Cass had on the witch’s porch. The pleading on Castiel’s face is heart wrenching, especially when coupled with the confusion and betrayal etched all over Dean’s face.
A whole body shudder moves through Dean when he finally bottoms out. “Fuck.” He hisses. “You feel so good.”
“Hey.” Dean’s voice is unusually careful, “All that stuff’s done with. In the past.” He pauses, “Me and Sam have made our fair share of mistakes. You don’t hold it against us do you?”
Once more, he lets his eyes slip shut, his hand moving in full strokes across his dick. He bites down on his lip as he feels himself get closer. His hips move of their own accord and the muscles in his legs tremble with pleasure. His balls pull up, in preparation to spill his load.
“I – I’m just tired buddy.” He breathes in shame covering his eyes with his hands and pretending that Cass isn’t just staring at him.
A harsh chuckle leaves his throat. “Why can’t Dean learn how to maintain his plants. All we ask for is some oxygen!”
“Dean I’m sorry.” He feels his face flush in shame. Even a simple caramel sauce seemed too complicated for him.
“Dean,” Sam murmurs, breaking him out of his worry. “This is a bad time, I know, but I should have told you before.”
“Oh!” he says sharply. “Well… it’s um, polite?” Is that the right word? “To warn the person who’s sucking you off when you’re about to come.”
Where Dean is likely to lose hope and plunge into despair, they tend to see the brighter side of things.
With a harsh breath, he rubs his fist into his chest, massaging the tension there. His chest seems to get tighter with every passing second. With every breath, the loss sinks in more. This is what heartbreak feels like, he realizes.
Jody isn’t back yet and Dean looks very near tears. Of the two of them, Cass cries from time to time, but he hasn’t seen Dean so much as shed a tear.
. It hadn’t felt like this before, then again, Dean had been the one doing most of the touching. Had it felt like this for him? Is that why he left to seek out better company? Castiel’s throat suddenly feels clogged and his arousal wanes.
Dean’s skin is thrumming when they break apart, his nerves frayed from everything that happened over the past few hours. But when his eyes drop to Cass’ lips, he doesn’t have to play it off.
“I know this was a huge step for you.” Cass continues, looking earnestly into Dean’s eyes. “And I’m glad you choose to take it with me. Let today be about you.”
“You’re aroused.” The instant the words come out, he regrets them. It spurs Dean into action as he practically stumbles to the door.
“That’s great!” She says with a smile. “So why did I drive all the way from my house in the middle of the night?”
Dean pushes himself up into a sitting position, his eyes trying to focus on his face in the darkness. “But do you like it?”
The chances of them having a happy relationship are slim. They battle enough just as friends. As lovers they’d only have more things to fight about. That’s if Dean’s feelings even last that long. Dean is convinced that they’re there, but what if he can’t – can’t love Castiel.
Dean feels giddy as they head down to the garage. So far Cass is exceeding his expectations and he doesn’t expect that to stop.
“No, Dean. I’m here to distract you. But if you want to talk, I won’t stop you.” Sam reveals the movie, pleased that Dean’s eyes light up immediately. “Plus, I brought entertainment.”
Then there had been the incident with Billie on the bridge. Cass had saved them all. But Sam had known that Dean would have been the one to offer himself up at the last second.
Castiel huffs, letting Dean push him onto his back; his legs spread enough for Dean to get between them. Bracing his hands beside Castiel’s head Dean shifts his so that their cocks line up, one foot on the seat and the other hanging off. His head spins with pleasure as Dean thrusts his hips, their wet members sliding over each other.
Castiel ‘played it cool’. He took a shower, put on Dean’s clothes and lay on the cold floor just a few feet away for the entire night. He’s severely sleep deprived his head pounding even as Dean rambles on about their cover and their house call.
That isn’t the word he wants to say but for now, it will have to do. Maybe one day he can tell Dean all the words he really wants to say. But for now, he’s happy with this.
Why else would he be bold enough to bring this up? It’s almost like he’s teasing him, but Dean can tell he takes no pleasure in this. He just wants answers. Answers Dean doesn’t feel comfortable giving.
And he wasn’t even joking about eating it off of him. Not that he could tell Cass that without making things weird between them.
And Dean wants to believe that. He does. But his mind can’t comprehend the words ‘sorry’ and ‘Cass’ in the same sentence.
“I’m not going to hang you out to dry.” He promises. “What we need to do before we go any further is talk.”
Sam cuts him off, “Good, good. How is domesticity treating you? Dean gone into dad mode yet? Man, I can’t wait to come visit you guys.”
What should he wear? He’s pretty sure he’s got a hospital gown somewhere but he doesn’t want his ass hanging out. He grabs the gown and some boxers and changes, hoping that Cass is ready too.
I'm so sorry I haven't updated this one in a while. Honestly, I had a bit of writers block but I've figured out how I want this to go. Expect maybe ten more chapters for this one. After this chapter, we get into the real battle which should last a few chapters, so I'm looking forward to that. And having all our characters in the same room ;)
“Where are we going?” Cass asks, after a minute passes and they’re both still standing in the middle of the court yard.
He looks at Castiel for a reaction, but gets none, “Dean, if you want to engage with a female you don’t need to lie to us.”
Scoffing, Dean holds his fork out to Cass while sticking out his tongue to his mother and brother. “None of you deserve this.” He teases.
Warm, is his first thought, as he wraps his fingers around Cass’ cock. He just lets his hand rest for a minute, letting both himself and Cass get accustomed to the feel. When Cass’s face screws up in pleasure and his hips jerk up and twist arcing into his fist, he begins moving slowly.
He went through this with Jack once but even then, there was the hope he would come back. And he did but Sam and Dean won’t. Billie will make sure of it.
He feels Dean shift uncomfortably. Castiel had learnt all about rationing money from his time as a human. Dean had explained to him what the plan was and how much money was allocated to each task and Castiel had mentally taken note:
“Do you know what my plan is?” The other Dean murmurs, hauntingly. “Cass is tethered to me. So when he feels himself slipping away… I’m putting a bullet in my brain and blasting us into oblivion.”
Sam’s intentions were pure when he came over to the table to skim some of the new mythology books that that he had collected. Instead he was greeted with a choking sound coming from Dean.
Dean has fantasies about him. The information makes him lightheaded. He desperately wants to know what they’re about - how long Dean has had them. However, Dean doesn’t seem phased by his admission. Humans have ‘wet dreams’ and fantasies all the time; they don’t necessarily mean anything. Asking would show his hand. Asking would be like pinning a neon, flashing ‘Cass is in love with you’ sign over Dean’s bed.
“Where is Dean?” Castiel wonders, looking around. He couldn’t have followed him by more than a minute yet the hunter’s vanished.
Every step feels unsteady, every word measured, carefully calculated; with the aim of molding the conversation into something safe. That’s what it’s come to ‘safe territory.’ By no means does he actually want to spend the rest of his existence talking to Dean like this. He doesn’t want to censor their conversations.
“Alright.” He whispers, mentally psyching himself up. “If Cass has the paper I’ll tell him… something.” He takes a breath. “If he doesn’t, then, things just go back to normal.”
“I think I remember something…” his eyes shift, “Sam… love is an open door. Do you want to build a snowman?”
Watching this interaction, it’s abundantly clear that Cass is in love with Dean. It almost hurts him physically. He’s pretty sure that if his brother knew, he’d back down in a second. But Dean doesn’t know. And Sam isn’t going to be the one to tell him.
doing here?” it’s beyond clear that the angel want to kill him on sight. Dean had once felt the same.
Her eyes cut across to Dean, then back to Castiel who is still standing stock still in the room, possibly hoping that it would keep Sam from noticing him. He looks unnervingly lost. Which is concerning. When they’re in unfamiliar territory, Cass is always the one to keep his cool and think logically. It’s one of the things he and Sam have in common.
What could it have been? A shifter? No - Sam remembers ‘Jody’ using a silver knife to slice some pie. A siren, perhaps? Though, what would it want with them? It could be a spy, co-ordinating some sort of attack and scoping out their weaknesses. Somehow, that just doesn’t feel right.
He knows that Cass won’t answer. He knows that he’s probably just fuelling their greatest unresolved fight.
Castiel finds himself almost skipping to Dean’s bedroom. He’s confident that Dean won’t turn his offer down.
Throughout the evening, Dean had to constantly quash the disappointment of hearing Crowley’s name and not having their Crowley clap back with a snarky retort. It doesn’t help that Cass seems to be in love with his new angel friend. Bonding over every speck of dust that passes by.
Cass then turns and pours him a cup of coffee, resting the steaming mug into his hands before pressing a sweet kiss to the side of his mouth.
“No.” he blurts, then winces, “There’s something wrong here. Crowley is involved.” He lowers his voice despite being completely alone in the middle of the woods. “Come alone Sam. I think Dean needs you.”
Dean -Michael’s eyes- are still closed on the bed. But he hums in satisfaction as Lucifer dumps them on the floor.
Glancing at him from the corner of his eyes Cass smirks, “Don’t worry Dean, nothing I haven’t seen before.”
Humming his agreement, Castiel keeps watch, noting everything about Dean, from his crow’s eyes to the way he sits and holds the wheel with one hand.
Sam obliges. He’s slightly confused, Dean should know his feelings better than anyone. Like he told Cass, Dean obviously cares about him. They have their profound bond. They need each other.
Nah, he’s not ready for that yet. Being cheered on by thousands of people isn’t something he’s ready to give up… yet.
The video starts out classic. Some spanking and girl on girl action that might have been taken straight from his fantasies. What he likes most about Casa Erotica, is the story. With the spanking, it’d been a chick who’d gotten caught trying to steal some make-up from a store. With the girls it’d been some racy step-sibling thing that hadn’t really made much sense.
Sam does, what any reasonable person would do. No, he doesn’t follow him back to Dean’s room. He whips out his laptop and watches in high definition.
Dean bristles. That isn’t exactly what he wants to hear. Sure, he’s well aware that their profound bond is actually a real thing… but their
Dean ponders that tidbit as he cleans himself up and changes into the soft clothes laid out for him. Again, they’re Cas’, and Dean’s omega is soothed. Balth helps him to bed, where a small bassinet has been placed up against Cas. Inside, swaddled in the same t-shirt, is Jimmybean, sleeping peacefully. Dean smiles at the scene. He realizes that he can have this every night, all he has to do is come clean to Cas. As terrifying as the thought is, it’s no match for Dean’s exhaustion and he’s out within moments.
“Whoa, buddy. What’s got your panties in a twist tonight, Jimmy?” He hadn’t even noticed Dean making his way down the bar, he was so irritated. Dean’s presence had the same calming effect on him that it always did, and he was able to speak without sounding entirely like an asshole. Hopefully.
Gabe takes a minute to get his voice under control and when he speaks it isn’t quite as shaky as it was before. “Like I was saying. Your alpha daddy was the one who kept me and Cassie in line. I’m older, but he was more mature.”
“You sure as fuck did. Now you listen to me. I’m only gonna say this once.” Gabe is terrifying in his fury, in spite of the fact that Dean’s about six inches taller and fifty pounds heavier than him. “I don’t know what’s going on in your head. You don’t talk, I don’t ask. I figure you and Cassie can work it out between you. The important thing is you and Jimmybean are family. You became family when Jimmy chose you. I don’t care where you came from or who you were, because Jimmy loved you. Now, because we’re family, we’re going to forgive you running off like an idiot, making yourself and Cas sick. Let’s go home. You’ll all feel better.”
It's fucking COLD. That nasty mix of rain and snow that not only makes being outside miserable, it sticks to and soaks through however many layers one is wearing. Cas had every intention of settling down with a pot of tea and a few episodes of Forensic Files in the background while he works on his grading, but now he's adding a steaming hot shower to that itinerary. He notices Dean's porch light is off, so he must be home now. He's seen Dean leaving with his duffel, wearing a t-shirt with the fire department emblem on it, and he's assumed that he's either a firefighter or a paramedic.
Dean would sell his soul for ten minutes in the shower by himself. Patting JB’s little butt through the carrier, Dean makes another loop of the bedroom before opting for a change of scenery.
Dean's not totally sure how to react to Jimmy's words. There’s only one part he can respond to with any clarity, so he latches onto it. “I had the same feeling, man. Thought at first  Sammy had snuck up on me, the feeling of family was so strong. I’ve never had someone want to look out for me unless they wanted something, so I’m not sure how to feel here.”
On top of all of that, his stomach’s been in knots for weeks. One minute he’s starving, and the next minute he doesn’t even want to think about food. Stress sucks. Once this batch of finals is over, he’s got a few weeks off. He can take some time to relax, recharge. Sleep more than 4 hours at a stretch. Take it easy in the mornings and ease into his day, rather than hitting the floor running. Maybe decrease his coffee consumption. That might help his heartburn. Shit, am I giving myself an ulcer? Fuck. Get some actual cooking done rather than take out and bar food. A system reset, that’s what his body needs. A few weeks off (ish) is just what Doctor Dean ordered, and as his patient, Dean is looking forward to following them. Until then, he fills his thermos with coffee and snags a bottle of water from the fridge. He’ll grab food on the way to class.
“Someone’s gotta do it, and it’s not gonna be Dad. Sammy’s finally old enough to take care of himself, and that’s a huge help. As far as time for myself? That’s what my classes are for. I’m working my ass off now, so I can take care of myself. I don’t need some alpha to come and rescue me.”
attempts, but he had finally managed to get them angled and labeled ("Dean," and "Cas") the way he wanted them. Around the outer edge, he'd painted "It’s the most wonderful time for a beer." On the back was an invite to his place for said beer and burgers. "You, me, beer and burgers. My place at seven." Due to his not at all stalkerish attention paid to Cas' comings and goings, he knew that he usually got in around 6-615. He'd give him some time to unwind before he expected him to come over. Then, in a move that resulted in him questioning his life choices, he applied fine, shimmery glitter to the front of the ornament and left it to dry.
to his knees on the floor, slapping Dean’s thighs apart. “Now, I fully intend to see if you taste as good as you look.” Dean might have laughed at that, if Cas wasn’t running his hands up along his inseams, using teeth and tongue to unbutton his jeans.
to provide for him. “I...oh god, what is he wearing?” His eyes burn and spill over, as they attempt to remain focused on the image in front of him.
"Dude. I heard you two bitching at each other. Now you're here and it's quiet. You either sorted things out, or-"
A few days later, Dean’s puttering in the kitchen, unpacking a box marked “kitchen crap-etc.” when he hears footfalls on his shared front porch. Since he hasn’t met his new neighbor yet, he drops what he’s doing and darts down the hallway and up to the front door. Wiping hands on the pajama pants he’s still wearing, (it’s his day off, suck it, Sammy,) he opens the door and finds his neighbor checking his mail.
He heaved a sigh and booted up his laptop. He was out of ideas, and out of people to ask. He entered “new mom gifts” into the Google search bar and hit enter. Page upon page of random websites were filled with everything from jewelry (that’s more Sam’s department), to custom wine glasses (maybe next year), to a $220 candle that looked a little like a tiny propane tank. Deciding this was going to take a while, he got up and grabbed a beer from the fridge. While he was in there, he thought it might be a good idea to make a sandwich. Internet shopping on an empty stomach wasn’t a good idea. He sat down and clicked a link at random.
Nodding slowly, he prepares his next words, “Fair enough. But I want you to try it on me. It’s always been something I’ve been intrigued by and lately, I’ve wondered if would prove to be as good for me as it is for everyone else.”
Abruptly, Dean breaks away and begins riffling through the draws on their night table. “Damnit.” He mutters.
Three wishes. One used by accident, one used by Sam, leaving one wish before the djinn is sucked into the lamp for another hundred years.
Swiping his hand across the head he moans at how good it feels now. Belatedly, he notices Dean swallow and shift in his spot.
Cass just keeps up his amused smile. It gives Dean chills. The angel looks almost pleased by this development. He doesn’t get why he isn’t mad. Dean would be if someone used their charms to distract him.
Sam widens his eyes. “How are you so calm?” he demands. Sam is freaking the hell out. “We need to change him back. Right now!”
Mary assesses Sam patiently, Sam had never been so snippy with anyone. With Dean it was easy to see it for what it is: playful banter between brothers, but this is something else entirely. As they make their way from the convention, Mary swears that she hears Becky say, “Dear God, Dean and Cass kissing the file room. It’s perfect for a fanfiction!”
Sam waits. Whatever Dean needs to say, he needs to say it himself. Dean has his own thoughts, he just needs the patience to put them into words.
Castiel presses a hand to his head as he sways. Of all the times to have a headache. He wants to raise his blade and hack apart the angels who are slowly cornering Dean, he wants to rip this place apart until he finds Lucifer and rips him apart. But all he can do is struggle to not have his head ripped apart.
Not sure what to say, Castiel tentatively draws Dean in for another kiss. His brain is slowly becoming functional, enough so that when Dean gasps and thrusts his erection against his side he realises how bad a lover he’s been.
“Okay.” He says, keeping himself calm for Dean’s sake. “Let’s go through this thing from start to finish. If I get something wrong, tell Cass to tell me.”
“Dean.” Cass says surprised, he grins at Dean cheekily and clutches his arm. “Did you just kiss me to distract me?”
Crowley turns them over in one swift motion and positions his legs above his shoulders, angling to his prostate with almost every thrust. The angel’s moans turn frantic then, mixing with whimpers and hair tugs that only serve to amp up Crowley’s own arousal.
Dean stares at him, silencing any protests. “I just – the most horrible guy, who has the worst temper and is just broken by life and duty and what people think of him… he gets a happy ending.”
The angel stares out the window once more and Sam feels his heart plummet… this time, his face is the picture of stoicism.
“The Shadow.” Dean breathes. “After he gave me all those memories back, he told me something. He threatened me. Said he’d tell Cass.”
Dean would never forget that…Castiel knows full well that he knows every Zeppelin song that ever existed.
“You telling me that I’m the thing that always goes wrong seems like something we should lead with.” He wants to add some bite to it. To mirror how hurt and betrayed he’d felt. But it’s hard to when Dean is actually trying to be considerate. He’s talking about their problem rather than pushing it aside to facilitate the monster of the week.
The tugging on his leg keeps up and Dean feels his heart thunder in his ears, as loud as the booming in the skies. Dean glances behind him panting, just as lightening flashes across the sky, illuminating the entire area. The place is a waste land. Nothing but recognisable in sight. Other than mud.
Silently, he reaches into his bedside drawer bringing out the holy water. Now that he isn’t drunk on Dean’s presence, certain things are starting to look fishy. He wets his fingers and touches them to Dean’s lips.
He can’t afford to waste time removing those stitches now though. In fact, he should just leave him here to rot. But the look in his eyes brings Crowley pause. He’d never seen an archangel look so lost… closed in on himself to the point that he doesn’t even try to retaliate.
One kid looks familiar. Black hair, blue eyes, and a silent glare that only fades when he’s looking at Dean. The second, is unfamiliar, expect for the picture in his pocket.
Things could continue as they are but he doubts that he’ll be satisfied. And remaining in this position would do nothing to help him figure out how he feels.
Running his fingers once more along the spine of the book, Castiel picks up his pen and makes a small annotation on the inside. Then, he closes it, with a silent vow to never open it again, and tucks it into his box.
They get their happily ever after at last... it's a bit sad, but we know they're going to spend an eternity together at least.
Sucking in courage, Castiel chances a look. His expression is incredulous but the loathing the angel expected to see is not present. He doesn’t know what to make of it and there isn’t enough time to process it now.
Dean’s shoulders fall in defeat. Sam’s pretty sure that he could just run right past him and Dean wouldn’t budge. That isn’t what he wants though.
Sam swears that the heavenly trumpet sounds as Dean’s footfalls echo through the corridor.  Grabbing Cass, Sam bolts to meet him half way, practically shoving him into Dean’s arms. Cass is instantly calm. He just sits happily in Dean’s lap with wet cheeks and snot on his face while he stares at him with bright blue eyes. To his dismay Dean just stares back, amused.
When they reach the door, Dean places a hand on Cass’ chest. “Man, are we good?” Even he hears the quiet desperation in his question.
