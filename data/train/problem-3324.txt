“I think that’s really wise.”
“Good morning,” Dean finally manages to say.
“I l— I— damn,” Dean mutters frustrated and presses his forehead against Cas’, closing his green eyes. Cas can say that word easily and Dean can’t even think about it. “One day I’ll be able to say that freaking word, I swear.”
“Stop,” Cas adds.
“Assbutt,” Castiel says, chuckling. He slaps Dean’s shoulder with the kitchen rag.
“Please, call me Cas, or Castiel. I prefer it.”
“Cas, listen to me,” Dean begins, gently. “We don't have a whole lot of time, okay? You have got to—”
But Dean kept trying, without any succeed, but he kept trying, until John kicked Dean’s stomach with his knee. Dean grunted. When John was drunk he wasn’t this strong, so he had to be sober, which was worse, because it meant that Dean had done something terrible and John was going to teach him a painful lesson.
“Dean, beloved,” Cas says as he rolls his hips at the same pace at Dean’s. He presses a few kisses on Dean’s lips and jaw while his fingers keep playing with one of his nipples. Each of his words rumble against Dean’s skin, and it only makes Dean’s inside fire burn brighter. “Do you want me to open you up with my tongue?”
Once she is gone, Dean goes to Cas’ body, which lies unconscious and limp. Amara did something to Lucifer, but Dean doesn’t know what it was. So he kneels next to him and cautiously touches the shoulder.
The door opens and Charlie gets in. He looks at Dean expectantly, with a silent question in her eyes that Dean answers by shaking his head and letting out a couple more tears. “Oh, Dean,” Charlie says devastated and walking towards him to pull him into a hug, and Dean’s crying intensifies. “I’m so sorry,” she says, her voice cracking. She places her hand on Dean’s hair and tightens her grip. “I’m so, so sorry.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greets as he closes the door. He watches for a moment how Cas takes off his trench coat and he goes towards the kitchen.
Dean is panting, breathing into the curve of Castiel’s neck. Cas holds him with one hand, his fingers slowly stroking his skin. When Dean pulls away to look at him, the ex-angel is licking his fingers from Dean’s come, and Dean can’t help chuckling. He kisses him, tasting himself on Castiel’s lips.
“Dean—” Castiel moans, getting both of his hands on Dean’s hair and tilting his head down to look at Dean, who also looks at Castiel as he takes all his length in his mouth.
“She knows about us, Cas,” Dean said, rolling his eyes and smiling.
They end up watching an old re-run of
“But you still love me,” Dean said with flirting eyes, before pressing a tender kiss on Cas’ naked shoulder.
They say goodbye to each other, and when Sam and Eileen are no longer on the laptop’s screen, Dean looks at Cas excitedly and Castiel mirrors his expression.
“I love you,” Castiel says, smiling softly before kissing Dean.
“Yeah, sorry,” Dean says, a bit embarrassed.
He drives around, until he finds a motel and decides to try his luck there. At this time and with this weather, Dean is sure that Cas might be wherever he might be sleeping, sheltering from the rain, and a motel room seems like a good guess.
“I hope the night turns out to be more enjoyable than you expect it to be, Your Highness.” She stopped when they reached the big doors that lead to the garden.
Cas chuckles. Then, he pulls away from Dean’s embrace and starts the shower so by the time they get under the spray, they will have hot water. As Cas does that, Dean begins to take off his t-shirt. Once Dean has thrown it to the basket, Dean notices that Cas is staring at him.
“Are you busy? I need to talk,” Dean says a bit embarrassed and shyly.
“No,” Castiel answered, looking at Dean. “We have to wait until Charlie’s friend gathers more information. Maybe she finds some compromising letters in between them or she hears something.”
Castiel looks relieved to hear that. He smiles and then he keeps talking. “Dean, if I ever do something that hurts you or causes you any pain, tell me and I will stop. I have no desire to cause you any pain at all.” He sounds too concerned and serious. His eyes show that he means those words.
He was doing great lately. He was missing Cas, but not as much as before. It felt as if he was finally moving on, but then, Cas had to appear on his TV and everything came back. Dean hasn’t forgotten Cas. He simply buried everything in the back of his mind, but he didn’t forget him. And now everything has been unearthed again and he is so screwed.
“Get everything off already,” Dean murmurs desperate, making Castiel laugh.
Dean fumbles with his phone, looking for a distraction. He wants to see Cas. He wants to talk to him. He wants to spend time with him. He wants to hunt with him. He wants to make him smile. He wants to ask him questions.
“I know.” Castiel laughs. That sound is one of the most beautiful things Dean has ever heard. He loves it.
“Get your stuff and meet us in the garage when you’ve packed,” Dean explains.
“No, I’m not against it,” Dean confesses.
Before Dean can say anything else, Sam appears in the room, his eyes brightening as he sees Dean awake.
But Castiel’s heart breaks again when the next morning, after Forrest and Jenny had sex, she leaves him again. Everything wasn’t perfect, but it was the closest thing to full happiness both of them ever had. When Jenny sneaked into Forrest’s bed after he told him that he wanted to marry her and that he knew what love was, Castiel was hoping that she would stay with Forrest and be happy with him.
“I know, I know that! I just—”
They keep eating and Dean can see Charlie’s wide grin from the corner of his eye, the one that means that she is up to something, but Dean tries to focus on his pasta and ignore her. If Charlie is going to do something, like talking to Dean about feelings and all that stuff, he would rather she did it when Cas wasn’t around them.
Dean doesn’t think he has ever felt this happy and peaceful before. Sure, he does get some breaks in between hunts, but he never gets to relax like this, to enjoy life like any other human being. He is always waiting for the next case to drop, or in the worse cases, the next apocalypse. But right now, he doesn’t have to worry about any of that.
“Ball,” Dean corrects, tiredly. “It's, uh... It's ‘dropped the ball’.”
Once they finish their lunch, they decide to take a walk around the city, visiting some of the must-see places of New Orleans, like its most characteristic streets and barrios. Dean smiles every time Cas finds some place or some building that he is fascinated by. It’s great to see Cas like that. Dean immediately brings his arms around Cas’ shoulders, pressing him closer and kissing his temple. Dean knows that they are in the south, and that people is quite homophobic, but he will fight anyone who tells them something. He is with the man he loves and he doesn’t want to hide anything. If people can’t understand that, it’s their problem.
Yeah, I'm updating several hours before my usual time, but I have a busy afternoon and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to update at my usual time, so here I am, updating now.
“Not really,” Dean answers. He takes a sip of his coffee. Cas is an atrocious cook, but he makes an amazing coffee. “You mind if I join you in that walk?”
“I highly prefer documentaries over those cowboy films you seem to enjoy so much,” Cas deadpans.
Dean would give anything to kiss Castiel now and tell him how much he loves him. But he can’t. So he smiles as widely as possible. “By the way,” Dean starts to say and Castiel turns his face from the wardrobe to him. “I still have the book you gave me that Christmas.”
“Really? Green Day?”
“I’ve heard that too. Wanna walk or go by car?” Dean says.
Dean’s hands trace down Cas’ chest and sides, he wants to touch him everywhere, to feel that wonderful body and memorize it with his hands. He keeps rocking his hips, riding that cock, without stopping for a single moment.
“Then take a seat and welcome to the class.”
They play another game and Sam loses again, making a frustrated sound that makes Castiel chuckle. His long hours playing this game with Charlie have been worth it. Sam insists on playing another game and this time, he is the one who wins, because someone throws at Cas that damn blue shell. If it wasn’t for that, he would have won.
Dean sighs. He is feeling a little bit cold because of the rain on his body and clothes, but he doesn’t care about that now. There is another silence in between them, but this time, they aren’t looking at each other.
Dean chuckles. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Be thankful that I love that about you,” he sassed, grinning cockily.
“Yeah,” he said casually. He wanted to ask other things, mostly related with his feelings, but he knew he shouldn’t ask that. After all, Castiel was engaged.
“You okay?” Dean asks, worriedly.
He is still in shock from watching the love of his life die in front of his eyes.
“Who’s Cas?” Jody asks confused.
“Don’t use that voice on me, kid.”
“I am.” Dean answers.
Dean laughs. “I don’t know, Cas.”
Castiel placed himself on top on Dean and kissed him, passionately and desperately. His hands traced down his sides and them he traced them up, until he moved them towards his nipples and caressed them, softly, making Dean hum and moan into the kiss. He pulled away after a while and placed his hands on Dean’s thighs, encouraging him to spread them and Dean complied.
Dean chuckles, nervously. “You weren’t supposed to know.”
“You aren’t just a fucking artist, Dean!” Castiel exclaimed with hurt, making Dean’s eyes find his. “And you have a lot of to offer. You are smart, kind, brave, talented, extraordinary and funny, despite of your terrible sense of humor.” At the last part, Dean chuckled bitterly and rolled his eyes. “There is so much worth in you, Dean,” he added as he cupped Dean’s face. “Every day I thank having you in my life. For loving you and being loved by you. So don’t you dare to think that there is anything past, present or future that will make me stop loving you.”
Castiel grinned. “It is so difficult to say no when you are kissing me and touching me.”
Castiel places himself on top of Dean, he grabs his arms and pulls them out of the way, pinning them against the headboard, looking at Dean, challenging, and Dean isn’t going to let him know how hot he finds him right now. “Why do you insist on leaving bed?” Castiel asks with a frown, leaning slightly so their lips can brush. Dean follows his lips and kisses him, humming pleased and the feeling. “Let’s stay here, Dean, we don’t have any rush.”
Dean sighs. “Yeah, I do.” He shrugs casually, not wanting to give it more importance than Cas is already giving it.
“Because you are shy, I guess.” Dean supposes.
“Just give me a minute and I will.” He chuckles too and when Dean looks at Castiel’s eyes, they are about to cry.
Castiel takes a quick look at them while he dries himself with his towel. Dean’s legs aren’t burnt, but they are about to. “A few minutes more and they would have gotten burnt too. You should have listened to me instead of being as stubborn as always.”
Dean chuckles to himself and decides to go to the garage and wash the Impala and see if there’s anything he needs to fix or do with her mechanics. It’s been a while since he checked his baby, and after their trip, he is sure that she needs to be revised.
Dean knows that if Sam, or anyone who cares about him, like Bobby or Charlie, knew about his real job, all of them would look for a better job for him. The sad truth is that being a whore is well paid, more than a lot of jobs where they require some high qualities. Dean is good at his job and now he earns more than normal and Cas is nice to him. It makes it easier. It isn’t Dean’s dream job, but meanwhile, it’s what he has to do.
Once Cas is sewed, Dean gets him out of the bath and dries him. Cas is unconscious again and Dean hates it. And he hates seeing how terrible his back looks. It is going to hurt him forever, Dean knows it. The fallen angel finally managed to have his grace back, to get rid of all that pain, and then, one year later, he falls again, becoming human, pain overtaking him, losing everything. Dean can’t stand it.
“Good. Good.” Dean says shaking his head and trying to avoid his eyes. It seems that he is having difficulties to make eye contact and that he is also trying to process that they are seeing each other after all those years. “Is that BMW x4 yours?”
Dean looks surprised at Cas for knowing that term.
But the main reason is that Dean thinks that if he washes the damn trench coat, he will be letting Cas go, and he can’t.
Castiel joined a third finger, loosening Dean as he kissed his neck. Dean kept moaning his neck and rocking his hips. Finally, Castiel added his fourth finger and finished preparing Dean. He touched his prostate a couple of times, loving how Dean reacted to it. He loved bringing pleasure to Dean.
Castiel is panting. A few seconds ago he had happiness and now, it is all gone. Dean is getting dressed, without saying a word. His face is dark and tough again. Castiel needs Dean to stay with him, to cuddle with him in bed, to kiss him in that perfect way.
Castiel closes his eyes and nods. “Where’s the washbag?”
“You were,” Dean says. “Okay, Jack brought you back because we needed you back.”
“Then why I can’t let it go?” His voice comes out weak and trembling, and Dean feels sick by it.
“Okay,” Cas says. “Thank you.”
But unfortunately, Dean has never been able to word his feelings.
Finally, Castiel finishes wiping his cheek and he takes a step back. Dean almost pulls him back to him, but he remains still, not wanting to make a mistake. Another part of him feels slightly relieved.
“Like this?” he asked as he drew a line. Castiel hummed in agreement and Dean kept looking at the drawing with a thoughtful expression on his face, then he hummed to himself. “Great advice, Cas, thanks.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says after closing the front door, walking towards the kitchen.
“No. We got everything, thanks,” Dean answers.
“You lied,” Cas states with a smile.
Castiel drops onto Dean, who lets his legs fall from Cas’ waist, feeling soreness in them, but he doesn’t care, because the afterglow is amazing and he and Cas are still joined and holding each other. They are exhausted, but it feels so damn good.
“You’re freaking stubborn. I’ve told you I’m fine.”
“You weren’t exaggerating when you said Sam grew up a lot,” Castiel murmurs to Dean, who laughs at Castiel as he sees the impressive expression in his face; he wasn’t expecting to see Sam as tall as he is now.
The phone in the office rings and Dean walks, almost runs, towards it. He looks at Charlie and she nods, knowing that Dean wants her to take charge of the cash while he speaks on the phone.
When Dean parks the Impala, he sees that his room has the lights on. He takes a deep breath before he gets out of the car. He walks towards the room, almost dragging his feet. When he stands in front of the door, he knocks, because he gave Cas the key, so there is no way he can get in.
Dean nods.
Dean makes an agreement face. “Yeah, that’s true.”
” Dean starts to sing loudly. He faces the bed, as if he had a big audience listening to him. “
“Shut up, Cas, and let me enjoy this.”
“Of course.”
The three of them decide to get some pizza for dinner and watch a movie together. By the time the movie finishes, the three of them decide to retire to their respective bedrooms.
“I know,” Castiel deadpans, but a smile makes its way to his lips.
Castiel smiles. “Still, I’m sure there are a few things I don’t know about you.”
“Turn around,” Cas says and Dean opens his eyes, admiring the beauty of Cas, completely wet and with his hair darker than usually because of the water. “Let me wash your hair.”
“Please. Stay with me.” He leans and kisses Castiel’s lips briefly. “Don’t leave.” He kisses the corner of his mouth. “Stay with me, Cas.”
Castiel blushes. “Thank you, Dean.”
He always had to leave Dean behind to return back to the place he had to call home but didn’t feel like it. He always had to keep Dean and him a secret. Fifteen years had passed, and they were no longer kids, but Castiel’s departure remained the same. He dreamt with the day when he didn’t have to leave from Dean’s side. He dreamt with the day when his heart didn’t clench in fear of being discovered. He dreamt with the day when he and Dean could be fully together.
“Yes,” Castiel says.
Thank you so much for reading, for the kudos, the comments, the bookmarks and the subscriptions :')
about it. “How could you do that?” Dean asks, hating how shaky his voice comes.
He brings the rose closer to his nose and he smells it, closing his eyes. Its smell is intense and fresh. He opens his eyes and looks at the flower. Thanks to Castiel, that flower blossomed. “You’re a hell of a gardener, Cas.”
Charlie gave him a lovely smile. “Cas, you want to change things for better. You’re actually worried about people. You don’t have to thank me anything. I’m so glad to help you. Really.”
Castiel sighs, unconvinced. He looks at Dean’s face; some of the cuts have disappeared but there a few ones where a pale line of scar tissue has appeared. He brushes some of those with his fingers, making Dean shiver. Then, he grabs Dean’s wounded hand to look at it. Dean removed the bandages this morning, revealing a thin scar.
“I had a family lunch today.” He answers tiredly. He closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose.
They slowly start to take each other’s clothes off as they kiss. Each piece of cloth ends up on the floor, until they are both completely naked. They keep kissing, tenderly but passionately. Castiel embraces Dean’s back and Dean loves it; he loves being held by those strong arms. He deepens the kiss as his hands trace the lines of Cas’ broad shoulders. He loves Cas’ body, loves feeling it under his palms and pressed against his. His freckled hands trace down Castiel’s sides, finding his hips, reaching his thick thighs. He caresses them, loving how they feel under his fingers.
Castiel chuckled and wiped his own tears. “Yes, it’s true.” He took a deep breath and looked at Dean, memorizing for one last time that beautiful face. “See you in April, Dean.”
He manages to give Cas’ lips a quick peck before Castiel pulls away, looking irritated at Dean. He walks to the counter, to take a sip of his coffee, and Dean brings his focus back on their breakfast.
He starts to unbutton and unzip Cas’ jeans when he realizes that they are both still wearing their boots, which they need to take off if they want to get rid of the last of their clothes.
Castiel shrugs, casually again. “I didn’t think that was going to happen.”
“Sure.”
“I brought this tape,” Castiel says as he shows Dean said tape.
“Be thankful that we are good at making up after a fight.”
“Meg is living in two days,” Castiel answered, whispering too. “I will come here the night of her departure.”
As Dean goes to the driver’s seat, he fights against the burning in his eyes. He is tired of crying and there is a long way back to the bunker.
“Oh no, we bought it in an ecologist market Charlie knew.” He explains. “For every fir bought they plant four more.” He tries to imitate Charlie’s voice, the once she used this morning when she suggested to buy a fir on that place. Dean was expecting it was going to be a mediocre tree, but it turned out to be a nice and not too expensive one, so he is happy with it. “We will decorate it later.” He turns his face to dedicate a big grin to Cas.
Castiel shakes his head. “You were right to be mad at me. I—” He takes a deep breath and looks at Dean’s eyes. “My hesitation, my doubts and my fears were hurting you. I know it wasn’t easy for any of us, but I wasn’t aware of how much you were hurting because of me.”
“You guys have been through everything, good and bad things. And you are still standing next to each other.” Her voice is bright and full of emotion, spreading it slightly into Dean. “And you two obviously love each other.” She makes a pretty smile and Dean sighs. No, Cas doesn’t feel that way. “The supernatural world is quiet, the big and tough ones are locked, and I think this is the moment you two have been waiting for so long. Nothing is going to take any of you out. I think it is about damn time that you two get together.”
Cas frowns at first, but then understanding settles in his eyes. “Dean, I’m not going anywhere.”
The moment they are both completely naked, Dean gets his hands around both of their cocks and he starts to jerk them off at the same time.
“I can’t remember,” Dean answers. “We’ll see after lunch. I’m thinking about making some chickpeas salad, how does that sound?”
“Yes, I am. C’mon, Cas, you can’t be worse than me.”
“Really? Just that?” Dean gives his brother a doubtful look.
“I don’t like it either.” Castiel snaps.
Dean sighs, relieved and grateful. “Thanks, Cas.” He gets his arm around Cas’ shoulders and pulls him closer, until their sides are touching. Cas seems surprised by the gesture at first, but then, he tentatively places his hand on the small of Dean’s back. “C’mon,” Dean says, joyfully. He can feel Cas’ warmth through his clothes and Dean tries his best to not lean into Cas’ touch. It feels intimate to have Cas’ hand in that spot, which makes Dean’s blush. “Let’s settle in and find some movie before Sam gets back.” They start walking through the hall, not pulling away from each other. “I ain’t gonna let him make us watch another boring documentary.”
“I know about ten names of some of those. Some other rebels are looking for info about ‘em, they can be sneaky. I’ll write you a list once Jess finishes healing my pretty face.”
Castiel tried to keep his expression still. Charlie Bradbury was also homosexual. That was really good. He could find support in her. She wasn’t part of the parliament, but she had influence, not to mention that she was also known for finding about other people’s secrets and using them to gain support.
Dean snorts while he quickly blushes. Getting any kind of praise is something he is not used to, and probably will never be. He tends to joke every time somebody gives him a kind word, knowing deep down that people are just trying to be nice to him, not really believing those words. Cas, however, is always so honest, and means each and every word.
Dean laughs. “Yeah.”
“But that’s because I don’t even fight against it.” He might pretend that he is a bit pissed off at staying in bed for longer than he wants to, but if he is with Cas and they are cuddling, Dean hasn’t got any complaint. “I like it, you know it.” He smirks and Castiel makes a pretty, gummy grin. “So,” he starts to say and he looks at his wrists, still trapped by Cas’ hands. “Are you gonna free me or not? ‘Cause I’ve gotta make dinner.”
Castiel stands up and walks the distance that separates them, resting his hands on Dean’s hipbones, his thumbs brushing soothingly his skin. “Are you okay?”
“But why?”
“You are such a pretty geisha, Dean,” Castiel says with a cocky but sweet voice. Sam and Charlie burst into laughter.
Dean closes the door behind him and then he watches the bed, wondering if he should sit on it or just remain standing in front of it. He sighs and decides to sit on the bed, because his legs feel jittery.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, still smirking.
“I was thinking that I’m an idiot in love.”
Dean snorts. “I’m not so sure about that. Relationships are way harder and scarier than that. At least for me.” He takes a deep breath and keeps stroking Cas’ hand.
“In the words of a good friend, a pain in the ass.”
“I need to take him to Heaven now,” Jack says.
Dean sighs in the silence of their bedroom. The ceiling is almost dark, only lightened by the lamp they keep on. It is a shame the bunker doesn’t have any windows.
After a while, they abandon the sea, walking back to the sand, holding hands. They sit next to their clothes, not putting them on. The sand is hot against their cold and wet skins, and the sand ends up sticking almost everywhere on their bodies. Dean knows the sand will fall down once they are dry, but he still finds it uncomfortable.
Sam makes another loud snore and Dean turns his face to look at him. “Shit Sam, you didn’t use to snore this loud before,” Dean says as he turns his face to look back at the road. He sees Cas smiling at his little brother and then, he looks at the road too.
They finally boil the pasta, and Sam comes to the kitchen, called by the overwhelming smell of the pesto rossa panna sauce Dean made. The fresh pasta takes less time than the other pasta to boil, and soon, the three of them sit around the table to enjoy the tasty dish.
As always, thank you so much for reading, for the kudos, the bookmarks, the comments and the subscriptions :')
“This is your revenge for taking my time before?” Castiel asks with a wide grin.
“Nightmares again?”
“I don't know,” Dean mumbles. He still looks through the window, hoping to see Cas, but he isn’t there. Dean swears he can hear the sound of his heart breaking. “I just saw something.”
Castiel ignores him and grabs the laptop. “The main problem when it comes to defeat him, it’s being aware that he can become invisible or turn into any kind of animal.” He searches for the Strigoi and starts reading out loud. “What I don’t understand is that he is supposed to rise from the grave, so why is he living in a house?”
Castiel looks at him, with that confused frown characteristic of him. “Dean, it’s too late for that.”
. Dean thinks. Then, Dean sighs. “And?” He says turning his face to look at his brother.
Slowly, he moves Castiel’s arm away, not wanting to wake him up, and he gets up from bed, walking towards the door of the balcony. He closes it and looks at the distance; there are dark clouds where sea and horizon meet, and Dean knows that in a few hours, they will come to where they are, but meanwhile, the sun shines brightly above their house.
“How are you?” Cas asks. He walks to the bed and sits on the edge, right next to Dean.
It’s just a simple word, but Dean hopes that the rest of what he is thinking,
It was dark and quite late, but Dean didn’t care. He kept running through the streets, holding Sam’s hand with his and carrying Sam’s school backpack on his other hand. It was cold outside and there were parts of the street where the remaining snow of the last days could still be seen.
“Probably,” Dean confesses in a mutter, sighing and looking at Bobby. “This clears my head.” Again, he pats the hood before he approaches Bobby. “And I need it.”
It is warm outside, almost hot. Summer is about to pay its visit to the city of Vancouver and Dean can feel it on his skin. Even the soft breeze that blows is whispering summer. He can now walk without his leather coat. It is strange to miss the weight of that coat on him, but he wears it for more than half a year that when he doesn’t have to wear it anymore, he misses the feeling of it.
Castiel laughs. “You can’t blame her for that.” He grabs one of the three remaining cookies Charlie left and he eats it. “I bet she will come back for more.”
“Only if it is going to be showed. The rest of the time we wear our own underwear.” He gives him a charming smile. “Did you really have that question in mind?”
“Perfect. Should I make a salad?”
Dean tries to shut down his thoughts, but he can’t. He can still picture those tattooed wings in his mind, even when he only saw them for a brief moment. Dean takes a deep breath and with his hand, he reaches the place where his tattoo is. He rolls onto the bed, trying to forget about everything and find a stance that will allow him to fall asleep, but it doesn’t do anything.
“I do.” He says with a genuine smile. Something warm inside Dean starts to spread quickly and it feels great. “Dean, I’m sorry about how I was last night, I was—” But Dean interrupts him with a kiss.
“You can’t work in the movie industry without me! You won’t be able to get a single role! You are nothing, Castiel!”
“No, I’m good, but thanks, babe.” He pecks his lips, feeling Castiel’s smile. The ex-angel pulls away, but he kisses Dean’s nape before doing that, and he walks towards where the kettle is. He makes a low grunt and Dean looks at him. “Your wound again?”
“Was it really necessary?” Dean asks, still glaring his brother.
Once Castiel has hung the trench coat on the rack, he goes to the kitchen too, wanting to know what Dean has in the oven. He is surprised by it. “Ribs?”
It only takes them a few more thrusts, Cas’ cock hitting that wonderful sweet spot, making Dean moan, clench and squirm, and both of them are coming. No one of them moves a single inch during the afterglow. They are panting, feeling boneless and exhausted. It is just their bodies pressed together, Cas still buried inside Dean and their hands still laced together.
“Good morning,” Castiel says, sounding really shy. Now that they are in front of each other, Dean can see that his eyes are even more beautiful up close. He can also appreciate that his dark hair is a complete mess that goes in every possible direction. And he can see that the trench coat he is wearing is a bit big for him, which makes him look smaller. Still, the guy looks and is gorgeous. “Do you happen to have any book by Vonnegut?”
Cas shakes his head and looks away, not believing Dean.
While Kali took a bath, Castiel took Gabriel to the bedroom Dean was.
“I don’t know.” Dean sits down next to his brother and he looks down as well.
Sam smiles. “We all will.” He looks at the door briefly and then he looks at Dean. “I’m gonna go to bed. I’m freaking exhausted, man.”
“Hello Dean.” Castiel greets casually. Just something as simple as saying hello to each other shouldn’t make Castiel’s heart ache, but it does.
Castiel makes that cute, little, shy smile, looking very timid. “I could move in here with you, if— if you wanted to.” He sounds so small and kind of embarrassed.
“I can’t tell him anything,” Dean interrupts her. He rolls up his sleeve and shows her the Mark. “Especially not while I’m carrying this.”
“And how are you two dealing with the secrets and hiding?” Jess asked, giving them a sympathetic look.
“It’s nothing, Cas.”
Dean chuckles.
When the dead angel falls onto the floor, Dean looks at Cas, who looks sad but solemn at the same time.
“Cas, are you okay?” Dean asks. Cas is mad, and Dean doesn’t have any idea about why his friend might be angry.
Dean huffs. “He’s gotta be home; his car’s there, so he’s probably hiding somewhere.”
Dean made an emotional smile. “That’s nice, Cas. And cheesy.”
As Dean walks back to the hotel, he spots a 24 hour Walmart. He decides to step in a buy some stuff that will convince Sam that he spent his night on that strip club. Maybe then, his brother will stop asking the questions Dean can’t answer. And maybe then, Sam will stop trying to treat Dean as if he was made of glass.
Dean looks at him, surprised. “You hate Westerns.”
He understands Cas’ need to leave once in a while, but he is constantly leaving and it hurts. It hurts so much. He wants Cas around, all the time. Having him around makes him happy, even if his heart aches because of his secret love for him, but having Cas in the bunker, even if he and Dean are just friends, is better than not having him at all.
“Everybody must be questioning why I defended Dean and brought him to the hospital. If somebody asks, I will say that I helped him in order to get some information about those Lucifer sympathizers,” Castiel explained. He knew the King was going to ask what took him so long at the parliament, and he would also ask the guards, so Castiel needed to prove that he didn’t help Dean because of the goodness of his heart, even if that was the real reason. “They will accept this excuse better than I just wanted to help Dean.”
His heart skipped a beat with the beautiful grin Dean made. He kissed him one last time and he left the house, walking towards his horse.
“Only a bit?” He arches an eyebrows and Dean bites his lower lip guiltily. Castiel keeps stroking Dean’s thigh; from where the knee starts to where ass and thigh meet. Dean inhales needily. “You must know that I like teasing.” He looks at Dean from his eyelashes. Dean parts his lips and rocks his hips slightly because one of Castiel’s fingers is circling his hole. “Most of the time I like to take my time, to see how you are craving this,” he says without taking his eyes from Dean’s. Dean bites his lower lip and his throat makes a moan. Castiel turns his eyes to Dean’s hole as he spreads Dean’s legs with one hand. “I like seeing how you react. How your hole tightens when I circle it and how your cock twitches.” He keeps talking with that sexy, soft voice. He grabs Dean’s cock with his other hand and he strokes it a few times. Dean moans and gasps, needy.
Dean grins. “Yeah, probably.” He gets the weed and the paper and starts rolling another joint again. “We’re gonna start laughing like idiots any minute now or say deep philosophical stuff.” He chuckles and looks at Cas, who is grinning. “You’re way too happy now.”
“Thanks Dean,” she says with a grateful and warm smile. Dean smiles and they start to go downstairs.
He comes with Cas’ name on his lips. He works himself through his orgasm with lazy movements, until he collapses onto bed with a deep sigh.
“Nope,” Charlie says with a wide grin and turning her face to give Dean an obvious look. “You and Cas. Finally.” She grins and Dean chuckles; he knew that was going to be the topic.
Cas exhales sharply and rolls his eyes.
Dean is reeling a little as he walks towards the elevator. The wound hurts like a bitch. He even feels dizzier with the elevator’s movement. He closes his eyes strongly, feeling the smell of whiskey and blood, being stronger in his nose as time passes. He opens his eyes when he hears the soft ding that indicates the elevator has stopped in a floor.
Dean’s phone has been playing music since they started decorating the porch, playing some of the many rock songs Dean has. Now,
Thank you so much for reading and for the wonderful comments. Also, thanks for the kudos, the bookmarks and the subscriptions.
When he is done, he leans onto Dean and gives him a sweet kiss. He traces down Dean’s body with kisses, Dean humming softly and happily at it, looking at Cas, who keeps descending his body. He presses some kisses on Dean’s dick, pressing the head of it in between his lips, not going further, almost chastely, but it still makes Dean’s breath hitch. Castiel pulls away and encourages Dean to spread his legs with just looking at him. He keeps leaving kisses on Dean’s body, kissing his rim, earning him a sweet moan from Dean. He keeps pressing kisses on his rim until he reaches his hole, where he gets his tongue in, flattening it to fuck Dean with it.
Sam chuckles. “Seriously?”
Castiel bursts into a happy and bright laugh and Dean can’t resist joining him. “I didn’t mean that, Dean,” he says in between laughs. Then he rubs his face. “It’s starting to be late and I’m tired. We should go to sleep.”
“No way!” she says with enthusiasm. “Really?” Her smile gets bigger and brighter. Dean nods. “Wow, good for him. How long have they been together?”
“It’s not broken,” Dean says as he touches Castiel’s nose. “But it’s gonna be a bit swollen for a while.”
“Salads are pretty good if you know how to dress them,” Dean answers as he serves himself some raviolis.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean can’t resist smiling. Cas’ smile is contagious and it makes him really happy. They kiss again, and though they only share brief kisses the sounds of them fill the room. When one kiss stops, another begins. Castiel’s hands are cupping Dean’s face and Dean has his hands on his dark, messy hair and on the space between his shoulder blades. These kisses are needier and more tender than usual. Dean pulls away to look at Cas. Something doesn’t feel right and he wants to know what it is. “Are you okay?” He frowns as he asks.
Dean looks at himself in the mirror. He’s wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, a gray plaid shirt, dark jeans and his boots. He runs his fingers through his hair, trying to comb it. He doesn’t know why he is taking this time with this. Cas told him to wear normal clothes, but once he’s in Cas’ apartment, Dean is sure that clothes won’t matter a lot. If Cas doesn’t like how Dean looks, he will tell him.
Dean gives his hand another squeeze. “Okay, well, I guess I can zap us to the bunker?”
“It’s better this way.”
“And I have never had sex until I had it with you,” Castiel affirmed, still stroking himself. He pulled his hand away and he leaned onto Dean, getting a finger inside his tight hole, making Dean moan, pleased. “But I’m a fast learner and I have masturbated thinking about you a couple of times.”
Two fingers join his tongue, opening Dean up. Dean is a mess of wails, moans and pants. If Cas takes his sweet time doing this before he fucks him, he knows he won’t last too long. That’s why he starts to search in the drawer for a condom and the lube. The moment he finds them, he presses them on Cas’ back, and the ex-angel gets the hint. He pulls away and Dean exhales sharply. He feels how Cas leans onto him and cups his face to kiss him sweetly. When Dean opens his eyes after their kiss, he sees that Cas is as blushed and sweated as he is.
Castiel gives him a curious look and a frown. “You want to take a walk?”
“Hey...” Sam starts to say.
“You don’t have to pay me, Cas.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greets as he comes back home.
“Yeah, I kind of suspected it when you asked me if it was a thing,” he mocked with a mischievous grin.
Rowena nods. She grabs some dust from the bowl and she places it onto Castiel’s stomach. “Don’t come near him until I’m done, understood?”
“Yeah, they’re fucking awesome,” Dean agrees before kissing him again.
“Hold on, Sam, I’m putting you on speaker,” Dean says when he answers his phone. He presses the speaker button and he places his phone on the kitchen table. “You can go on, now.”
So Castiel takes a deep breath and goes towards the bus stop to wait for the bus. One way or another he is going to have to face this. He really doesn’t want to have to do anything with Dean. Their lives pulled apart when Dean left town, it is nonsense that their lives collide again. Dean used to be the most important person in Castiel’s life. Now, Dean is just a collection of painful memories. There are happy memories from that past, of course they are, but they are painful. Castiel knows that he hasn’t been as happy as he was when he and Dean were together. He knows he hasn’t laughed like he used to laugh with Dean since their break up. And it hurts to know that.
“You keep telling yourself that one day you will finally stop being in love with me, but you can’t. You keep carrying a piece of me in your skin, right where your heart is.” He makes a desperate gasp and Dean trembles under him. “You lie to yourself and say, it is only a memory from the past, it doesn’t mean anything. But we know that it means a lot, Dean. You carry me, in your broken heart. And you will always carry me.”
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean murmurs as he closes his eyes.
“Dean!” Sam and Charlie exclaim.
“I’m hating you so much right now,” he mutters.
“Aaawww, Dean Winchester is defending his boyfriend.”
“Okay.” He starts to kiss Dean in a fierce way and he turns him over, until Dean feels pressed against the border of the worktop. “I want to make it up to you.” Castiel adds in a desperate and sexy voice. He knows that Dean finds it arousing. He always trembles a little with that.
Cas gives him an unamused look. “No.
Thank you so much for reading, for the kudos, the bookmarks, the comments and the subscriptions :)
“You are unbelievable,” Castiel says laughing.
When they pull away, Dean presses their foreheads together, needing a moment to ground himself. He steals a kiss from Cas’ lips and then pulls away. “We should bury this in one of those pots and then we should calls Sam and Eileen and tell them everything.”
“Will ya stop calling me that?” Bobby asks with a soft angry voice.
“No, thank you. But I want some scrambled eggs,” Sam answers. “I guess Cas is gonna make something with fruit, right?”
“I already had that in mind,” Cas admits, leaning in to steal a quick kiss from Cas’ lips.
“Yeah. But your phone was dead for nine days, Cas. I was starting to get worried. I also—” He clears his throat, uncomfortable with confessing the next thing. “I also checked your credit card records, and they showed that you hadn’t used it for nine days, and I thought it couldn’t be a coincidence. I was worried that something had happened to you.”
Dean keeps holding himself on Cas. Now he has his hands on Cas’ shoulder blades, feeling how the muscles move under his fingers with every move the blue eyed man makes. Castiel is now on his collarbone, dragging his teeth and licking, leaving hickeys on Dean’s skin. Dean gasps for air desperately and he swears that Cas smiles every time he gasps like that.
Dean looks at his brother, who has a huge grin on his face. “The Batman one?”
“What?! No! Of course not!”
Castiel leans onto Dean and he kisses him sweetly as he gets his finger into his tight hole. Dean hums at the feeling, fucking into it. Cas soon joins a second finger and this time, Dean moans at the nice burn of Castiel’s slender fingers inside him.
Dean glares his little brother with his fiercest eyes. “It will be the last thing you do.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he manages to say with a weak voice.
by Bryan Adams.”
“I’m teasing you, Dean,” he chuckled. He leaned and pecked his lips. “But you have such a high sexual appetite.”
He looks at Dean whose eyes are focused on the pancake he is making. “Hey, Cas,” Dean starts to say. “I’m making pancakes, there is some fruit and coffee too; do you want some scrambled eggs with bacon?”
“I thought you didn’t feel the same,” he answered shrugging.
” Dean starts to sing with a beautiful voice that makes Castiel smile unconsciously and let more tears fall. Dean singing is one of the most beautiful things Castiel has ever heard and it makes him feel indescribable things. “
“Don’t apologize, Cas. I know how bitchy family can get, trust me.” He presses his forehead with Castiel’s. “But at least you have this awesome guy.” He adds with a cocky grin.
Dean immediately blushes but he grins. “Geez, Cas. I didn’t know you were such a sap.”
Dean grins, beautifully. “Yeah, we are.”
“At least I’ve got one,” he said, kissing his temple. Castiel dedicated him another glare.  Dean smiled and pressed a lingering kiss on his temple one more time. “Most of the times I’m the one they contact. Given that I live outside the city, it’s easier to write me and then I deliver the news to the rest of the rebels. Also, most of the important meetings are held here, in my house, at night. It’s more discreet.” He breathed into Castiel’s hair and pressed a soft kiss onto his hairline. “I’m also the one who falsifies documents when they’re needed, and the one who makes those flyers that sometimes appear near the parliament.”
“No,” he says, and he feels his eyes getting a bit glassy. He exhales sharply. “We are living in the same place and I miss you because you’re avoiding me all the time! And I don’t know why! I just want to help! I’m worried about you! So tell me what I did!”
“I prefer the word "trusting”,” Cas explains with a pretty smile. “Less dumb. Less ass.”
“Of course,” Dean answers and Castiel smiles widely.
“What the hell just happened?” Dean demands, in shock.
“Just one moment,” Dean says as he stops unzipping his jeans. He doesn’t bother to put on some sleepers and decides to walk barefoot to open the door, finding Castiel. ”What’s up, Cas?”
Castiel tried to run towards his Father to help Dean, but two men were grabbing him and pulling him away. Castiel looked at them and recognized them; they were some of the men that worked for his Father, and they weren’t the only ones that had arrived to that part of the forest. There were about ten in total that appeared out of nowhere. His Father always liked to come in first, followed by his men.
“Do you really want to know what he enjoys doing to me?” Dean asks, making a mischievous smirk. Too bad Sam can’t see him.
“Are you feeling better?”
Dean soon feels the brush on his back and he feels as if he could breathe again. He wants to cry, but he is holding his tears so hard. He isn’t going to let any of them fall. Cas can’t see him crying; it will lead to more questions, more lies and Dean is tired of that tonight. He only wants to get back to where they were, before they asked those stupid questions.
“Uh, so I'm, what, supposed to just sit here?”
“We also have regular trimmings, right?”
Castiel takes a deep breath. “You told me you were going to sleep. I waited until you were dreaming to come and see you. I can still do it.”
“Stop saying that!”
Dean opens his eyes and he meets those beautiful blue eyes he loves. They are so damn close, closer than usually, but the small distance in between them still feels like miles.
“Because I’m looking into your eyes, Dean,” Castiel states, with determination. He takes a step closer so he can be in Dean‘s personal space. “I can’t look into your eyes when I lie, you know that.”
“I’m not so sure about that.”
Castiel kisses him again, this time briefly, just a soft press of their lips and he smiles. “Hello, Dean.”
Looking at those pictures makes him smile widely. They give the bunker a deeper feeling of home. For Dean, the bunker has been home almost since the day he stepped inside, but now, every part of the bunker is attached with memories, good and bad ones, but mostly with good ones. Some things have changed, like the colors of some walls, the living room used to be a dusty room with some strange boxes, some of the furniture of the kitchen have been replaced by furniture bought on Ikea and some other things like that.
“My life is boring, actually.” Charlie says with a pout. “And yours is getting interesting.” She adds. Dean chuckles and he shakes his head. “What’s his name?”
“I’m only causing you trouble.”
Dean looks at Cas. “Cas, you’re beaten.”
“You were taking your time,” Dean says causally, earning him a glare from his brother. “Don’t worry, we won’t do anything else in the bedroom.” He begins to stand up and he grabs Cas’ hand, helping him to stand up before he goes to their travel bag to get them clean clothes.
“Well, who wants some pie?” Dean asks, wanting to fill the silence.
“Be with me.”
“I don’t know how many times I have stood on a shore or on a beach,” Cas began to say easily. “But the sound of the sea always calms me. I am always drawn to its sound and fascinated by its constant movement. So many centuries can pass, and the sea is always there, unwavering and unchangeable, no matter what.”
“Okay.” He says before leaning in to press a soft kiss on Dean’s lips. “What’s your safe word?”
“Shut up, Dean,” Castiel said, rolling his eyes and leaning the back of his head on Dean’s shoulder again. “You said it yourself, I have always been a bit of a rebel.”
Dean blushes. “You flatterer.”
Castiel’s frown only deepened. “That’s not an answer. Could you be more specific?”
“Do you want me to spend Christmas with you?” He asks confused and even shocked.
They exchange some words with Crowley and Rowena before they leave Hell. Slowly, they emerge to the street. Sam walks towards the Impala without looking back, but Dean notices Cas coming to a stop behind him.
“No. I don’t know how to use a damn computer. That’s the other reason of why I called you. I’ve tried to get some copies, but I need to fulfill a fucking sheet of some type of bullshit.”
Dean arches his eyebrow. “Are you saying that your previous orgasms weren’t nice?”
Dean shakes his head. “I don’t.”
“You don't think I'm angry?” Cas asks. “After what Chuck did? After what he took from me? He killed Jack. But that doesn't mean it was all a lie.”
“The King has a lot of power, but he can’t change, remove or create new laws, so what’s the King’s power when it comes to the legislative power?”
Charlie chuckles and shakes her head. “Nothing,” she simply says as she walks away from the cash desk. Dean can’t see her face, but he’s sure that she’s smirking.
“Yes,” Castiel answers. “Will you take care of the greenhouse for me?” he asks, looking at Sam.
“Dean—” Castiel whispers extremely low, but Dean can hear it perfectly. He moves his eyes from the bleeding back to Castiel’s face. His eyebrows are making a frown and his eyes are half closed, but those baby blues meet Dean’s eyes, showing the pain Castiel feels. It breaks Dean’s heart into million pieces. “Dean—” he repeats, this time a little bit louder, but not too much.
“We barely know each other yet, but thank you for your words, Dean.” He says looking at Dean’s eyes and making a cute shy smile. “Your brother must be very lucky to have you as his elder brother.”
This is it. I can't believe it's finall finished. Thank you, thank you so damn much to all of you for reading, for living the story the way you did (sorry for all the angst, I know I wrote too much angst, lol), but seriously, I'm so glad you enjoyed and lived the story the way you did, for stucking with me until the end. Thanks a lot, you are amazing.
“Better?” Dean asks with a timid voice.
“You say that about every food that hasn’t been cooked by me.”
“That’s really considering, thank you,” Castiel says politely, earning him a big smile from the receptionist.
That’s what Dean decides to do, to look for those phones. He needs a distraction and he needs to get back on the job. He needs to relearn what he used to do, what life used to feel like.
“Dean, you don’t—” He begins to say, but he stops talking when Dean gets his hands on his thigh and starts to massage it. He can feel his muscles are a bit cramped. The ex-angel lets out a relieved gasp and Dean smiles. “Go ahead; your hands are helping a lot.”
Castiel shrugs and then he presses his hand against his nose. When he pulls it away, he sees that he isn’t bleeding anymore. “We should go back to the cabin.”
When he opens then again, he is in his bedroom. Morning has come and he is all alone in his bed, feeling cold and alone. He closes his eyes and he touches his lips, feeling the ghost of Castiel’s lips against him, kissing him.
“Why did you do it?” Castiel finally asks, looking at her with anger and pain in his eyes.
Castiel hides his sly smile behind the mug as he takes a sip. “That's one of the perks of it.”
Cas gives his hands a reassuring squeeze. Dean senses he wants to say more, but Cas doesn’t. Probably the dream doesn’t want to disrupt Dean’s happiness. The dream wants to keep him here, so every time something makes the happiness falter, or every time the dream senses Dean’s will to leave, it quickly adapts and gives something to either calm Dean or to make him want to stay there.
“No, well, not exactly,” Sam starts to say. Castiel looks at him confused, not knowing what Sam means. “He is gonna kill me if he finds out I’m talking to you about it.”
His lover smiles softly and cups Dean’s face. “Because it is a surprise.”
When he is only wearing his boxers and t-shirt, he looks at his wardrobe and then at Cas, who is writing something on his journal with a pencil. He does that sometimes. He writes some of the memories he wants to write next on pencil, in case he forgets, and then he erases that list when he is done. He does that on the last page of the journal.
Dean pulls away and uses his mouth and tongue to play with Cas’ left nipple. He is so sensitive and makes the best sounds Dean has ever heard whenever he nibbles. His hips even lift from the bed and he closes his eyes as a moan escapes from his lips. Dean can’t help smirking at it.
“Yeah, you look like hell,” he says with a grimace.
“Sweetie,” Ellen starts to say. “If this boy does something you don’t like, just tell me and I’ll kick his ass,” she jokes, but by the way Dean is looking at her, she might be telling the truth.
He thinks about praying to Cas every day, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t know where he is, and the Enochian sigil on his ribs won’t let Cas know where he is, so praying to Cas would only make Cas feel terrible and powerless. He would be able to hear Dean’s voice but not come to him. That would be torture, and Dean can’t do that to Cas. That would be too cruel. No matter how much Dean needs to pray to Cas, he doesn’t do it. Cas must be feeling like shit for not knowing where they are, so Dean can’t add to his distress by praying to him. It would be painful for Cas.
Dean takes a deep breath. “Can you— can you not tell everyone about me and Cas? Kevin might know it, given that he saw Cas on Friday, so I guess he’ll ask me about it today, but don’t tell anyone else, would you?”
” He mutters. Dean is about to say something. “
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says as he steps onto the living room, where Dean is watching the Food Network. He leans onto him and kisses him before showing him a bag. “I got you some more cheap jeans that we can cut so you can wear them while you still have the plaster.”
He and Sam get in the Impala, trying to get to the closest town, hoping that they will find Cas there. Still, Dean calls Cas, hoping that he will pick up the phone, and thankfully he does.
“Nah, don’t worry. Besides we’ll make a stop to have lunch. I can take a small nap after we reach Chicago, so there’s no problem.”
“Do you smell anything like apples?” Dean asks, leaning onto Cas. The music isn’t too loud, but Dean needs to raise his volume a little if he wants Cas to hear him properly.
Dean hums pleased. “So awesome when you swear.” He nibbles his lower lip playfully and Cas blushes quickly. “And so cute when you blush.”
Dean lets out a shaky moan when Castiel gets that finger in. It’s not the same and good as Cas’ cock, but it feels pretty good. Castiel bites his neck and Dean moans harder, pressing Cas’ mouth against his neck closer. He needs this, he needs Cas, every single part of his body is aching for him. They do this twice a week, and Dean needs it so bad, he needs that man to drive him crazy, to push away all Dean’s crap. He makes him forget what he is. Dean shouldn’t forget it, but he wants to when he is with Cas.
They almost run towards their bedroom. Cas switches on the lights in there and then he pulls Dean close to him to give Dean one of the most passionate kisses he has ever experienced. By the time they pull away, both of them are slightly panting.
Dean shakes his head. “No. I was thinking about staying here until my stomach begins to growl.” It makes Castiel smile. Dean kisses Castiel’s thigh. “My mind’s quiet about my shit right now.”
“Yeah, okay.”
“No, that’s why I chose the vegetables option.” He makes a cute smile and Dean bursts into laughter and kisses Cas, sweetly and happily. When they pull away, both of them have that tender look. “What?” he asks with a bright smile.
“It might not me the most proper label for the contents found under that label,” Castiel begins to say in his usual deadpan voice. “But I must admit that those contents easily fall under the category of gross stuff.”
“What?”
“Everything worth doing is hard, I’ve found. But also,” Benji smiles, takes a breath. “Sobriety is hard to live with. Drinking was worse.”
“Do you know what dad said to me that trip?” Sam asks, and Dean shakes his head no. “Not a single thing. I was going through this journaling phase at the time and I was obsessed with documenting every minute of my day. I think we were reading
“The first step is admitting you’re powerless. Big difference.” Benji isn’t even looking at him, too focused on fixing his plate the way he wants it. “Problems have solutions. Problems can be fixed. Problems can be controlled. But being powerless? You don’t fix that, you accept it.” He picks up half of his patty melt and takes a bite, like he hasn’t said something actually terrifying.
. He’ll take a look. Maybe there’s something Dean missed.
attached again. He uses them for the stupidest shit: healing pigeons with scabies and, embarrassingly, more than once zapping away Dean’s hangover so he doesn’t fuck up on a hunt. But mostly he’s settled into just being some guy. He putters around reading paperbacks he picks up from the thrift store and going to the botanical gardens to bird watch.
Sam wipes his hand across his face. “That I used to spend so much time thinking about how dad screwed me up, screwed me over, I didn’t really appreciate that he did the same to you, just differently. I learned to be alone with myself. I learned to care about myself because I thought no one else would. You’re not like that.”
On the way home, he stops at the liquor store. He still has twenty four hours before his deadline, after all.
Castiel opens his mouth to reply, a dozen questions on the tip of his tongue, but is interrupted by the sound of gunshots. From behind him, Dean and Sam have regrouped and are determinedly firing round after round of bullets into Naomi, who for her part barely seems to register that she’s being shot.
“Yeah, can’t say I’m some language expert, but I’ve seen Arabic and that ain’t it.”
“Yeah, man. That was the first time I ever saw the ocean. You too! We didn’t do any of the sandcastle shit but we were definitely there long enough to cruise the boardwalk. You met that girl--what was her name?”
He forces himself to smile. “Yeah, Sammy. Going a little stir crazy here. I could use the fresh air.”
Castiel is surprised that this time it’s Dean who lets out an incredulous snort. “It’s only powerful if you believe angels are real,” he says.
Castiel looks up the blazon—sable, a fess argent above a cockatrice rampant—and shows Dean how to use the various genealogical databases to find records of particular members of the family and their active dates. After that there’s very little for Castiel to assist with—the actual research part of research is inescapably tedious—so he retreats to the reference desk.
Castiel squeezes his hand. “It can’t be both?” Castiel sees something flash in Dean’s eyes and his smile grows softer, sweeter somehow. The moment hangs between them, charged with possibility. Finally, Dean turns his hand so his palm is touching Castiel’s, interlacing their fingers.
“I could say a lot of things, man. I could tell you that God works in mysterious ways, or that he doesn’t give you more than you can handle, or that God doesn’t make mistakes. I’ve had people tell me all that. I could tell you that you’re being too literal and you should think of it as a spiritual journey instead of some Grandpa Save a Drunk living in the clouds like it sounds.”
It’s not Chet, though, who Castiel finds sitting on the steps of the library, two cups of coffee carefully balanced in one hand while he scrolls through a cell phone on the other. It’s Dean Winchester. When Castiel clears his throat—he can’t get by to unlock the door unless Dean moves—Dean scrambles to his feet, nearly spilling the coffee, and gives Castiel another thousand watt grin.
Many surreal things have happened to Castiel since he first met Dean Winchester, but seeing his head of conservation burst through an exploded portal into a secret underground bunker where he’s been trapped for almost a week must be the most bizarre.
“It’s not transfer lithography,” he tells Sam and Dean over dinner in the bunker’s utilitarian kitchen. “There’s evidence of ink squash.” Dean cooked while Sam, whose broken leg seems to be the reason Dean was sent on research duty to begin with, sat and heckled him about including more vegetables in his diet.
“Steps don’t work like that. It’s less of a program, more of a cycle. When you get through working the steps, you go through them again.” He makes a motion like a wheel turning with one hand, the smoke free one.
“It doesn’t appear so. I knew our copy had some sophistication, but I was unaware of any missing leaves being supplied. The alphabet here… it’s strange.”
Again, Dean looks bashful. Castiel notices his eyes are a very striking green color. They’re also a nice shape. Kind, somehow.
“We talked. We talked about our dad, about some of the shit he put on us. Sam said he used to resent me. It was a real special time. Shoulda filmed it for Dr. Phil.”
“Yeah, Cas, I guess I am. But only for a little bit.”
The idea of committing to another human being to stop drinking feels hugely momentous, too big to happen in some random parking lot outside a Huddle House. Dean nods, though, and even shakes on it. He’s definitely got work to do.
His whole plan was to broach a conversation with Sam in the car, but he didn’t actually think through what he’d do when they got to town. Sam settled down with a giant iced chai with almond milk immediately—ignoring Dean’s quip about how you go about milking almond—and is now in the zone with this grimoire. Or at least pretending to be in the zone. So Dean’s just there, clutching a cup of coffee he doesn’t want and staring off into space.
About an hour later, Dean returns
—speaking of, he makes a note to write to them, as well as the ISTC, to update their database entries for this copy. He examines the binding—diced Russia, nineteenth century, consistent with the rough date for the insertion of the leaves. The endleaves are likewise predictable and uninformative, a Turkish comb marble pattern ubiquitous in the nineteenth century. He analyzes the paper of the inserted leaves but makes no further inferences. It’s handmade, obviously whoever selected it did so with an eye towards matching the paper used throughout the book. Other than the watermark, it’s a good match.
is upside down between a translation of Conrad Gessner into Dutch and a reference work on, inexplicably, Beneventan script.
“As I suspected. See here—this page has been tipped in.”
“I don’t take on many sponsees. One at a time. I’ve had three total. We still keep in touch.” Benji doesn’t mention if they’re all still sober, and Dean doesn’t ask.
Castiel smiles. “Oh Dean, you’re wrong. You’re observant and a quick learner. You’d make an excellent bibliographer.”
Dean’s almost more disappointed by this response than if Benji ordered him to confess to Sam. Orders he can follow.
. He’s smiling, but wistfully.
Benji sits up at this, excited and a little proud, like Dean did something magical. “Oh yeah?”
“That’s about all. If you have any further questions, I’ll be at the desk.”
“You know you really shouldn’t bring food and drink in here,” Castiel says, but he takes the plate anyway. It’s roast beef, which is his favorite although there’s no way Dean could have known that. Dean just rolls his eyes, takes a long pull from the beer bottle, and sits down opposite him.
Benji smiles and takes a drag off his cigarette, still stuck in the fork holder. “You’re hard to pin down. You’ve been coming to this meeting for a couple of months, but you never speak. You wear the most nondescript clothing imaginable but you drive that,” he points at the Impala, “very distinctive car.”
Dean laughs. “Just one?”
“Bethany.”
“No, I kinda get what you’re talking about.”
“Well, whoever replaced the leaves wanted credit for their work; it should be easy enough to find the family associated with this shield. It’s not a full achievement, but there are plenty of elements to narrow it down.”
“I guess we just have different ways to cope. I push myself, you know. I run, I eat clean, I focus on healing my body. And I hope that doing all that helps me heal my soul too.”
“I still don’t understand why you did this,” Castiel says. “Why write all this down at all if you don’t want anyone to know about angels?”
“You believe in witches, demons, and zombies, but not angels?”
By unspoken agreement, Dean and Benji meet up at the diner after the meeting. Dean orders a waffle again but Benji just gets coffee.
“I’m sorry, I’m just trying to follow Sam’s directions. He said something about a hidden picture in the paper.”
