"Don't worry, she won't." Bergeron held his hand out to Duran. "It was a pleasure working with you, ma'am." Duran gave a cordial smile and grasped the offered hand firmly.
Annabeth quickly locked Ricky in her bedroom and went back to lead Agent Duran through the house. When they reached the backyard, Agent Duran immediately made a bee-line for the fence.
"Not quite," Hill said. "We still need to discuss how this was allowed to happen." A pregnant pause filled the room. Every face had some level of guilt written across them, even the puppy. "So, where were you all last night?" Lara was the first one to speak up.
No one was home when he got there, so he sat on the front steps and waited for someone to come back. It took a while, but eventually, a blue Nisan pulled up in the driveway and Lorraine stepped out of the car. He looked exactly how he imagined Joyce would look at this age, but skinnier, angrier, and with longer hair. He got up and started to approach her.
"That again?" Pepper said. "How many times do I need to tell you that you're not responsible for this?"
"Well, you don't have to worry about that right now," Clint said. "I'm safe and I'm feeling much better." Laura smiled.
Although it had only been ten or fifteen minutes since he had gotten back from the bathroom, to Tony, it felt like an eternity. As stated before, the motions of the plane didn't do anything to help his stomach, and he wanted nothing more than to open the plane's door and walk out. (Not in a suicidal way. The MK12 could quickly deploy from the tower and make it to him before he could hit the ground. Although, it could technically be considered homicidal seeing as everyone else would be sucked out of the airplane and killed if he did that.) It was agonizing but slowly, the waves of nausea started ebbing back, and Tony could feel himself begin to relax a bit. Steve put a hand on his back, and he relaxed a bit more.
"Uh-huh," Tony said. "Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us." Bruce gave a small, humorless laugh.
"A lot of things pushed me over the edge," Tony said. "It was a multi-tiered cliff. Every time something happened, I'd fall to the next level of the abyss. That was just the event that started it. After that happened, I had some of the free mimosas the bar was handing out…"
The way Tony's face fell at that remark told Rhodey all he needed to know; Tony had found out about the sex tape that was going around. He fell uncharacteristically quiet as the nurse finished setting the IV bag back to normal. Once everything was reset, the nurse promptly left the room, only telling Rhodey to make sure Tony did not mess with the IV bag again.
By the time they reached the end of the stairs, Tony could hear and argument breaking out on the floor above them. Two women – one with a British accent and one that sounded American but had the tiniest hints of British mixed in there – were shouting but their tones weren't angry. One sounded concerned. That voice belonged to his assigned S.H.I.E.L.D. physician, Dr. Smith. The other voice was just plain stubborn and insistent. He had a feeling he knew who it was, but it wasn't confirmed until a figure appeared at the top of the stairs. It was the woman he had known as Homeland Security Agent Jennifer Duran but was now being told was S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Jessica Drew. God, he was getting sick of the spy games.
Remember kids, even if the author doesn't have the will to live, it's not worth it to track her down and kill her.
"Part of it was because it was easier to enable him than it was to speak out," he admitted. "But the other part was that it didn't hit us how out of control the problem was until he and Romanoff threw that wild party. You know about that, right?" Steve nodded with a slight grimace.
That was what Tony's earlier quip had been about. It was a low blow and he knew it. When Pepper had said it, she was instantly horrified and regretted it. Tony had seen it on her face, yet he still somehow had no problem using them against her when the first opportunity presented itself. Perhaps that was why they had barely spoken outside of work-related matters since then.

While the nurse cleaned the site, they were going to draw blood from, Tony slipped his hand into Steve's free one. Steve looked at their joined hands, then back at Tony.
"But it is not capable of going into space," Thor restated. "Why construct a large airship meant to carry a number of people across great distances and not make space travel an option?"
"Do you feel like you're going to throw up?" Tony almost shook his head, but thankfully for the sake of his aching skull, he thought better of it.
"Me too," Lara said. "But eventually it comes back to bite you in the ass, like right now." Bruce couldn't help but nod in agreement with that. "You haven't talked to Betty since then, right?"
Holding her wrist out in front of her, Natasha slowly guided the light across the wall to find a light switch. Turning it on, Tony was stunned by what he saw. Furniture was overturned. Broken glass and dishware were scattered everywhere. Nothing on the first floor seemed to have been spared, other than his mother's grand piano. (Which Tony was thankful for given that he had just gotten the thing restored.) The chandeliers had even been ripped down from the ceiling. He could see thousand-dollar bottles of wine smashed on the floor and first editions from the study with their pages ripped out and tossed on the floor. The police had told him that a lot of his property had been damaged, but he really wasn't expecting this.
"No one was infected," she said. "Your plan failed." Her words seemed to have the desired effect, as Sharpton's face fell.
"Come on, Johnny!" The officer continued to try to reason with him. "The only way you're getting out of here alive is if you surrender now! The Bureau is willing to make a deal! You give up your suppliers, you get off with twenty-five to life! Considering what you're facing, that's a pretty good deal!"
Lara slowly let out that breath she'd been holding. Her immediate assumption was that Pepper had fired him. That was good. Though, why he had to make such a scene out of it was a mystery to her. That was, until Freeman started to speak again.
"I'll have whatever the exact opposite of that is." Honestly, he did not want to eat. He just wanted to power through all the paperwork and get it done so that way he could head down to R&D and get some actual work done. However, he knew Pepper would not leave him alone until he agreed to eat something. So, he gave in. Though, Pepper still did not look quite pleased.
"Alright." The elevator chimed, and the doors slid open, allowing Lara to get off. "I guess I'll see you all on Friday, then."
When Tony walked out of frame for the second time, Steve felt himself deflate like a balloon. For one dark second, he considered the idea that was the last time Tony would be seen alive. The thought made his heart ache, but he knew the possibility could be all too real. Thankfully, the others weren't thinking along such dark lines.
"So, how are we supposed to get up there?" As soon as Steve turned to face Thor and Tony, he got his answer. The Norse God and the man with jet repulsors in his shoes had already made it to the top of the cliff and didn't even offer to give him a lift, of course. Steve sighed and looked the cliff up and down.
"Thank you," he said. "For all of this. You didn't have to, but you're right. It's what I needed to hear."
He took a deep breath in and out. He wasn't angry, just confused. A part of him wanted to chase down Lara and ask her to clarify, but he had a feeling that would just make matters worse. She was clearly upset and probably needed a bit to cool off – something he could understand better than anyone. For a brief second, he considered texting Betty to find out what she had texted to Lara, but that kind of felt underhanded and would just make more problems than necessary.
"Good. I left my phone in my bedroom. Can you go back and grab it for me and get a change of clothes."
"You want to waste time looking for one, be my guest," Pepper said. "Meanwhile, we have an emergency situation and I'm sure Tony would very much appreciate getting the treatment he needs without getting accosted by the press."
Hopefully, this wasn't too filler-y for you. A thing that always bothered me about the movie was that S.H.I.E.L.D. easily could have warned the public that there was an attack imminent and started evacuating Midtown well before the battle happened, but they didn't. I guess maybe they didn't want to alarm Loki, but still, you're playing with civilian lives there. Also, before anyone says "well, what were they going to tell the public? A crazy god was about to launch an alien invasion force upon them? They'd never believe it!" I'd like to inform you that there's this little thing called "lying." They easily could have lied and said it was a threatened attack by Al-Qaeda or the Taliban or some other terrorist group just to get the people up and moving and then fully disclose what happened later. It's not that hard.
"Stark's computer system was blocking the signal," Clint explained. "Hill found a work-around, so it shouldn't be a problem again."
"We were walking back to the hotel last night and I spotted him in an alleyway eating half of a cold pizza out of a box," he explained. "Clearly you can see how emaciated he is and he doesn't have any tags. I think someone sold off all his brothers and sisters, but couldn't sell him because of his leg, so instead, they just abandoned him." Lara narrowed her eyes in confusion.
"This is, uh, this." Tony hit a button and the holographic screens came to life with the display images showing the files that Coulson had brought with him. On the far left, the images and tactical info about a Dr. Bruce Banner (A.K.A. the Hulk) were displayed, along with news footage from the fight that destroyed half of Harlem the previous year. On the far right, there were more images and tactical info, this time about a man by the name of Thor Odinson. Accompanying Thor's profile was grainy video surveillance footage of the man taking on a giant killer robot in the middle of a suburban street. Then there was the file in the dead center…
"Actually, they're a more common mode of travel on Vanahiem than Asgard," Thor said. "And I never said they were 'giant', just large enough to ride."
Continuing to run up the road and touch whatever he could, Knežević found that pretty much anything he touched with the dead center of his palm would turn to stone, the only exception being his own body. As soon as his palm contacted the object, it would slowly start to change form, becoming one of a multitude of shades he seemed to be able to produce. The transformation process would start at the point of contact and continue until the entire object was consumed. If an object was made from multiple parts, only the part he touched would turn to stone. The rest of the object would remain intact. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was pure brilliance!
A very special thanks to Saidra on AO3! It was helpful and did inform my decision in going through with getting this new laptop.
The best people to recruit – in Adoniram's opinion – were those who had already made a name for themselves; titans of industry, celebrities, and people who were just successful in general. Often the general public worked as a hive mind. If someone famous or successful joined the Church, they would see an uptick in recruitment numbers, either because their fans and followers were feeble-minded people who just blindly followed the leader, or because they thought that the Peoples Unity Church would cause them to be successful as well. It didn't matter which they thought to Adoniram, if the Church could sink its teeth into them before their delusions faded. Once their minds were corrupted, it would be next to impossible to leave. (That was, you know, unless he failed to produce results again.)
"Uh… They're mine?" Lara narrowed her eyes. Just simply the fact that it was stated as a question told her that this wasn't the case.
Thanks to DarkSkity and FanGirlForever19 for the favorites and follows on FFN and FriedChickenNisha for leaving a comment and kudos on AO3, along with one other guest! It really means a lot! :)
"It seems Agent Romanoff has decided to take Stark's place in quarantine," Hill said. "She ran in without a protective suit."
"I'm going to patch you through to the City of Malibu's 911 center," the woman explained. "Just explain the situation to them as calmly and rationally as you can and give them updates on the injured party's condition, as necessary."
The ship's escape pods were designed to hold at least fifty people, so the ship's inhabitants would easily fit in comfortably, even with the two new little additions to their ranks. However, none of the men would be joining the evacuees. It was women and children only. The men were to stay on the ship, doing whatever they could to distract the Kree and prevent them from following the escape pod to the planet below. Although they knew the planet – which went by many names; Terra, C-53, Midgard, Earth, etc. – wasn't uninhabited, it was only a short distance from the red planet they had chosen to colonize, so the hope was that once on Terra they could petition it's government to assist them in completing the final leg of their journey. However, if they wanted to start their lives on this new planet, they were going to need all the information they could get in order to do it and do it right.
"Unfortunately, I'm afraid I don't have any inhabitable worlds to offer at this time." Tarquan's face instantly fell. "However, I think I can offer something better." Tarquan's brow raised in interest. The frog-man chuckled and pulled something out of his desk drawer.
"Yes, it's quite interesting," she managed to say without gagging. "I was wondering what about these qualities you find admirable and how they apply to your beliefs." Adoniram laughed.
"I must admit," he said. "This whole scenario goes well beyond reasonable belief. I mean, come on, a person surviving sixty-five years frozen in ice? Even if he is a genetically-altered super-soldier, that just doesn't happen."
Sorry, it took me so long to upload! 90% of the problem was I was abstaining from going on the internet until I watched the first two episodes of WandaVision and it took me over an hour to break into my Disney+ account. Anyways, on with the show!
Now it wasn't the fact that Tony left that came as a huge shock to him, Steve knew that he had been probably planning that from the start. What came as such a shock was that he had stopped Natasha from stopping Tony. He didn't know what had come over him. Natasha hadn't been in a position where she could get hurt – after all, the lab had a lot of open space, especially towards the garage area where the platform was located. Tony could have easily gone around her – so the only reason he could logically come up with was that he wanted to get her out of Tony's way.
"Have you tried taking anything for it?" Tony nodded, but the doctor didn't acknowledge it until he gave a verbal "yes," along with it. "And nothing worked?"
Steve's eyes narrowed a slight bit more, but he complied, sitting back down in his seat. Pepper moved to sit in the seat Lara vacated across from him. She crossed her legs, tightly clasped her hands together and her shoulders were tense, and she contemplated what she was going to say. The omnificence of it was too much for Steve to bear. He was just about to break and ask what was wrong with Tony when she finally found the words to say.
"I don't think this is the kind of thing you congratulate someone on." Despite trying to say the remark so quietly it was kept to himself, voices still tended to carry in that room and thus Clint heard him. He shook his head in disbelief.
Tony, obviously, hadn't taken the cold reception very well. That was very apparent now that they were standing in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet facing opposite sides of the plane while Loki sat tied up a few feet away from them. The Norse God had surrendered easily, allowing the agents to secure his hands while Natasha patted him down. As far as she could tell, he didn't have any other weapons on him and they were given the okay to bring Loki back to the Helicarrier base. Tony claimed to be exhausted after flying all the way from New York to Germany in the suit and asked Natasha with a "pretty please" to let him hitch a ride to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secret base with them. Natasha agreed, but only because she felt safer having the extra hands ready to deal with Loki at any given time and because he "asked nicely."
"Is that how you feel?" she asked. "Like your lack of privacy is endangering you?" Realization hit Tony in the face like a frying pan.
"We were brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D. to apprehend Loki." That was the most clandestine answer he could give. S.H.I.E.L.D. had made it clear months ago that they didn't want word of the Tesseract getting out, even if the mystical artifact was realms away by this point, because the spy agency didn't want any eyes on them. So, they were all forced to give out a very watered-down version of events. However, this isn't what the press thirsted for. They wanted details; as many as they could get.
"Yes." A pained expression came across Tony's face. So, there was a video of him being a drunk jerk. That was nothing new. At least it wasn't a sex tape. Still, he couldn't help but feel ashamed of himself, especially if…
"Yeah," Tony said. "Divide and conquer is great, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience."
"Yeah," Tony said. "Seriously, though, where exactly are we going? I'm not being led out to the lake like Fredo, am I?"
The tour was a little rushed given the fact that they were only allowed to be there so long, but Steve still enjoyed it, nonetheless. Some of the museum's displays showcased events Steve was already aware of, but there were numerous displays that covered the sixty-five years he missed. Everything from the end of World War II and beyond was covered. Well, probably not
"Miss Potts, you've got a sec?" Pepper quickly joined Tony at the counter, leaving Lara to chat with Coulson.
"Thank you," Lara said as she took a seat next to Natasha at the counter. "I was starting to get hungry, and this eliminates the need to explain my dietary restrictions to the takeout people."
Feeling through the rest of her hair, Carol found it was only the first inch and a half or so that was singed. In annoyance, she started to pull and pick at the ends of her hair until the singed bits came out and crumpled away. She hoped it would make her feel more comfortable, but all it seemed to do was make her feel even grosser and look like a crazy person when the privacy curtain was pulled back and a woman stepped into the space.
"I don't know." That was the truth of it. Tony didn't know what to think. Apart of him wanted to believe that the others wanted to help, but another part of him – a piece that had been broken and stepped on way too many times – was telling him not to believe it; not to trust them. He didn't know which one to listen to; which one was right.
There had been a debate about whether they should return to New York as planned or not. On the one hand, withdrawal symptoms had finally hit Tony hard. He woke up three different times during the night to throw up. Each time he failed to make it to the bathroom, but luckily Steve moved fast and managed to grab a plastic bag or a wastebasket and get it to Tony before the contents of his stomach ended up all over the hotel's extremely lovely plush carpeting. After the third time, Tony went straight to the bathroom and laid down on the cold tile floor in front of the toilet. Steve joined him a short while later, bringing pillows and blankets with him. Both stayed on the floor until the first light of dawn.
"I can lower the repulsor blasts to five-percent their normal strength." Tony wasn't entirely sure that was a good idea. Even at only five-percent those repulsor blasts were pretty strong, especially when you consider the fact that this guy wasn't wearing any clothes other than his underwear and had no protective gear to speak of. Best case scenario, the guy ended up badly bruised with a few second-degree burns. However, Tony didn't have much of a choice given that Knežević was going to be upon him in less than mere seconds.
"Allahu Akbar, then?" From the look on her face, Lara could tell that Cabe didn't like where the conversation was going and wanted to end the conversation before it escalated.
"Not true," Thor said. "Jane told me that you have a species called 'ostrich' which she supposed one could ride if they truly desired." Loki made an audible noise of disgust at the mention of Jane's name.
"We gotta go wide on the public awareness campaign," Pepper said. "You need to do some press." Tony hated hearing those words, but it couldn't be helped. Facing the press was a necessary evil when it came to change the world, unfortunately.
"Agent Romanoff," Director Fury greeted as they approached. "What brings you here on this fine Monday morning?"
"Yes, sir." The video started playing but no change happened on screen. If it wasn't for the time stamp in the corner changing every thirty seconds, Tony would think that he was just looking at a still image of the chem lab at an awkward angle. Sighing, Tony forced himself to concentrate on the screen.
"Oui, Angelina Jolie essaie de tuer Brad Pitt maintenant," Lara rattled off to the phone. "Pourquoi? Je ne sais pas! Je pense qu'ils doivent s'entretuer maintenant qu'ils savent qu'ils sont des espions ou quoi que ce soit. Si vous cessez de poser des questions, je pourrais mieux vous expliquer le film." Lara looked up to see what was going on on-screen when she finally took notice of Pepper standing in the doorway with her hands on her hips. Lara's face blanched. "Hey, J.P., I'm going to have to call you back. Oui. Je t'aime aussi, mon frère. Au revoir." Lara hung up the phone and turned back to Pepper. "In my defense, Tony was the one who asked me to do this and he said to be completely honest with you when I tell you that he's doing an Iron Man thing and he's going to come right back once it's taken care of."
"Uh…" Tony held out hope that they had completed the last of it. Unfortunately, Rhodey shook his head. "No, I did not."
"What the hell?" She freed her arm from his grasp and stumbled backward, however it was too late. The process had already begun. Directly in the spot where Knežević had touched her arm, a pale-yellow stone had appeared. It quickly began to spread, consuming her wrist and hand, and moving up her arm at a remarkable speed. She screamed, but it was pointless. She was the only one on duty and there were no customers. No one could hear her, and no one could help her.
"I actually have a number of appointments I haven't gotten to cancelling yet," she explained. "If you could do that for me, that would be a huge relief." Lara nodded.
Steve didn't realize he had fallen asleep until he started coming to. He groaned and rubbed his neck. He had been leaning against the wall all night. Obviously, that wasn't the best position to be in. He was trying to massage his vertebra when he heard the noise that woke him up. Someone was knocking on the door.
"Really?" Laura said. "That never happens." Sure, the signal lagged a bit and the cameras didn't always have great quality, but they never had trouble connecting to the network outright.
"Yup," Lara agreed. "Also, while we're on the subject of getting to know each other, who's that guy and why is he naked?" She turned and flickered her gaze back and forth between Steve and Tony. "I mean, I didn't walk in on some weird swinging thing or orgy, right?" Tony tried hard to suppress a laugh at Steve's reddening face and Bruce's abject horror.
"You have nothing to apologize for," Mrs. Barnes said. "I mean, I can barely imagine what any of that was like."
"Take us to Mount Sinai Hospital," she said. "The main building on Madison Avenue." The driver complied without a word. Steve looked back at Natasha.
"I see you've taken notice of our symbol and tenants." Carol gently pushed Adoniram's hand off her shoulder. Though she badly wanted to punch him, she managed to hold back.
"I'm out of prison," he tried explaining again. "Legally out of prison. I didn't escape or anything crazy like that. I served my full sentence and got out fair and square."
Looking around, Tony didn't immediately recognize where he was. He recognized that it was a bathroom, but that was about it. He could see his jacket, socks, and shoes on the floor, but couldn't see anything else of note.
"Dr. Banner," Steve said in a calm, yet commanding voice. "Put down the scepter." Bruce looked down at his left hand to see that his hand to see he had a tight grip around the scepter's center of gravity. His eyes went wide like he was surprised; he didn't remember taking the scepter.
"Hopefully, nothing," Wayne said. "But until we can determine that for sure, this is where you'll be staying."
"Right away," JARVIS said before the audio switched over to the sound of a phone dialing and ringing. He brought a hand up to Tony's forehead and found it to be unusually warm and sweaty, particularly for someone who had spent the past five hours sleeping with the air conditioning on full blast. He could only hope that it was not indicative of something serious as he waited for poison control to pick up.
Dialing 911, Oswin tried her damnedest to confess over the phone, but thanks to her powers acting up the operator on the other end of the line couldn't hear her. Throwing the phone away and realizing that she'd be faced with a similar situation if she tried to go to the police station to confess, Oswin let out a pained groan. This was the definition of a rock and a hard place. If only there was something to get around her powers…
) However, Clint couldn't help but wonder how Stark was handling all of this. Probably not well given the fact that this was the second or third time he'd been poisoned recently. He'd even pointed it out himself. Clint figured he might as well check up on him.
Putting the cap back on the flask, Tony had just barely slipped it back into his pocket when he saw Lara almost walk past the hallway, he was waiting in. She caught sight of him at the last second and stopped, throwing her hands in the air.
"Are you okay with going to the wedding?" she asked. Bruce had to consider the question for a few moments before he could answer.
That raised a huge question; how did they get a hold of such dangerous and deadly diseases? It could mean that the powder was fake, but that wouldn't explain all the effort they took to get around postal irradiation. It did cause the lipstick stain to make a little more sense, though, if they were using it as some sort of calling card.
"Oh, that's easy." Oswin opened the door and stepped out of the car. "I don't." She slammed the door and started walking away before Knežević could even process what she said. Once he did, he was seething with rage.
"Well, I can assure you that anything you tell me stays within this room – unless I believe you're going to take drastic action against yourself or others." Tony let out a pained sigh.
"He's officially on the blacklist now," Cabe said. "If he tries to come in again, security will be on him before he even reaches the elevators."
"No need to apologize," she said. "So, what is it that you wanted to find? Some sort of chemical plant?"
He managed to get showered and dressed in record time and probably would have managed to at least get on the highway before the meeting started if he hadn't almost tripped over his new personal assistant on the way out the door. To be fair, she probably shouldn't have been sitting with her back against the front door, but she still got mad anyway.
"That's true," Everhart said. "But you have to have had a certain image of him before you met, right?"
"Rhodey," Tony said. "But you already know that. Besides, there's only so much he can do from California."
"Yeah," Steve said. "But you can't deny that you enjoy it." Alright, Tony had to give Steve that, especially since he wasn't wearing any clothes to obscure the view of his flexing muscles. "Where do you want this?"
"Just hit the call button on the remote," the doctor instructed. "A nurse will be right in with a bed pan." A look of disgust crossed Clint's face.
"He wouldn't stop throwing up," he said. "He was in so much pain, he choked a few times, at one point I seriously thought he was going to die… It was… I don't even think I should be talking about it." Natasha nodded in understanding.
"Yeah," Tony said. "That's just previews. This is opening night and Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right? He wants flowers, he wants parades. He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered…" Right then, Tony's eyes went wide. He quickly pulled out of the embrace and his hands went to the phone in his back pocket. It only took one tap of the screen for Tony to find what he was looking for. "Son of a bitch," he cursed.
Opening the door, Natasha stepped into the room without a word. Sharpton turned to look at her and instantly recognition crossed her face. She knew who she was.
"I've got a body over here!" The man who shouted that sounded like he was miles away, but Carol had a feeling that was not the truth. She heard a bigger commotion converge above her and subsequently the weight started lifting off her. Realizing she probably did not have an excuse not to get up anymore, Carol opened her eyes and started to sit up. Looking around, what happened started coming back to her.
Just to make things worse, as she passed through the Grand Central entrance to Stark Tower – or Avengers Tower as they were calling it now – she could hear the booming echo of a voice coming from the direction of the main lobby. She let out a curse and ran towards the commotion, giving quickly huffed apologies to the people she had to shove aside. Unsurprisingly, she entered the lobby and was greeted with the sight of several dozen people in white robes gathered in front of a man dressed similarly to them with a thick beard and long gray hair tied back in a ponytail. Lara groaned as she identified the group as the People's Unity Church. She couldn't help but compare them to the Sand People from
Carol took a step forward and Tony followed. It was difficult, given that he was still ridiculously off-balance, and he felt like he was walking on pins and needles, but he managed to do it. With Carol's help, he slowly made it across the room and out into the hallway. At one point, Fury complained that they were taking too long and asked why Carol didn't just pick Tony up and carry him to the car. Carol shot Fury a look and he didn't say anything further; just let Carol and Tony continue the same slow path.
Lara and Tony got into an argument about Tony's drinking. Tony left while Lara went back inside the party venue. This is what happened to Lara.
"No, I haven't," she said. "Not since the party last night. What happened?" For what felt like the millionth time Steve explained the situation. He was getting sick of having to do that. However, both Clint and Natasha swore up and down that they hadn't seen Tony, nor had they let him into their rooms. By the time they finished, Bruce had joined them, and Steve was feeling an increasing amount of pressure on his chest.
Tony looked over to the door and saw that Fury had walked into the room, followed by Hill and Carol. Carol had her hands in the pockets of her flight jacket and looked like she wasn't trying to draw attention to herself. She gave him a sympathetic look but didn't say anything.
"Okay," Tony said. "We'll leave you be." Tony slowly started stepping towards the door and gestured for Lara to follow him.
"I don't hate it." Tony gave Steve a disbelieving look. "Okay, I think it's obnoxious, but you like it."
"Tell you what," she said. "You bear with one more night of resting in bed, and we'll see about having breakfast downstairs tomorrow."
"What kind of situation?" Carol asked. "The kind a girl should have gotten paged for?" Fury shook his head.
"Still, it worked," Oswin said. "You've got to give yourself credit for that, though. Wait… How did you know all of that stuff about the codes if you only guessed that one at random?"
"This way," Fury gestured with a nod of his head. Carol started walking in the direction indicated with Fury and Hill falling into step beside her. "And on the way there, you can explain what the hell happened." Carol let out a sigh. She knew she wasn't going to get off that easy.
"Alright," she said. "But are you sure robbing Stark Industries is a good idea? By doing that, we'd essentially be asking for Iron Man to come and kick our asses. You do know about Iron Man, right?"
"And you promise not to worry about me excessively during the day?" Steve frowned and this time properly opened his eyes.
At the same time Steve sunk down into that warm bliss, another cold, dreadful thought spawned in the deep recesses of his mind. One that made his stomach clench and fresh tears spring to his eyes.
Just so you know, I have this fic entirely backed up to the cloud, so if my computer craps out on me, not all is lost. I can still get to it, though it'll be a pain in the ass. While I have your attention, though, does anyone reading this know anything about computers? The laptop I have is a Lenovo ideapad 330 running Windows 10 and the error message that keeps coming up after it forcibly shuts itself off and on again is "Default Boot Device Missing or Boot Failed." Any help I can get on this would be greatly appreciated.
"You'd think," Tony said. "But it doesn't always work out that way, especially after a biological attack."
"Which are doing fine," Adoniram said. "Better than ever. We don't need the Avengers. Suddenly turning around at this point would probably hurt our recruitment rather than help it. So, try again. Why should we enlist the Avengers into our ranks?"
The redhead bit her lip in consideration, but eventually stepped back from the elevator door, allowing Steve and Tony to pass.
"Seriously?" Bruce nodded. "So essentially Steve took steroids while you took steroids crossed with crack cocaine." Bruce laughed.
"Mr. Stark, we need to talk," a tiny, somewhat muffled voice said from a nearby counter. Tony quickly snatched up his cell phone and held it in front of his face. Looking at the display, Tony could see that it was none other than Phil Coulson who had hacked his phone. God, couldn't S.H.I.E.L.D. take a hint and leave a guy alone?
"Oh yeah," she said like it was nothing. "I've seen at least four so far. Five if you count the one I passed on my way in here."
"I understand your hesitance," she said. "But we do need your help. Stark's unavailable for the foreseeable future and you're the greatest mind we've got."
It was a tight fit. They were both too tall for the bed, something that surprised Steve because Tony was all of 5'9" – more than half a foot shorter than him. If anyone could fit in this bed, he should, but apparently not. However, the lack of space wasn't exactly a bad thing, either. After all, it meant that they'd be in constant physical contact with one another, which given the day's events didn't sound that bad at all.
"Now we're getting somewhere." Tony mentally smacked himself. Saying that was a mistake. "What was it that Howard did to upset you? I promise, no matter what it was your father's not going to yell at you. In fact, depending on what it was I might be entitled to kick his ass." Alright, that got a small smile out of Tony, but it was fleeting. He went back to giving Peggy the silent treatment. "Tony, I'm serious. I'll make sure Howard doesn't get angry with you, but you must tell me what it was he did in the first place. Please?"
Once she was sure all the glass was gone, Jessica set about her cleaning tasks for the day. She usually started off with a bit of light dusting around the house to allow herself a little more time to wake up. She'd dust the dining room, office, and living room in that order and was usually quick about it.
"Alright," she said. "I'll call them but I'm just saying… Hello, is this West Hills Hospital and Medical Center?" As Conroy continued her phone call, Pepper opened the passenger-side door for Tony and Steve helped him get in the car. Although he was having a hard time staying on his feet, Tony was able to fasten his seat belt on his own.
In hindsight, Steve probably should have been prepared for a wait. When Tony said it would be an hour, Steve didn't think it was going to be
"No need," Steve said. "You were looking out for Tony. I understand. Besides, I'm not upset with either of you."
It was silent in the containment room as Steve stepped inside. Tony wasn't hard to miss. He was standing on the edge of one of the ramps that previously led to the containment module before Loki sent it plummeting back towards Earth with Thor inside. Steve didn't even try to bother going over to him or trying to talk to him. Instead, he just went and stood on the edge of one of the other ramps and just waited. Waited for Tony to say something, to make the first move. It never happened, so Steve finally gave in and said something.
"I know," Laura said. "But I'm still going to worry, especially with how impulsive you've been lately."
Steve opened the door and sure enough, he could see the glinting silver of the War Machine armor pass by the living room windows. Only stopping to make sure his clothes were straightened out, Steve headed across the hall to Tony's office. It was directly attached to the assembly station for Tony's suits, so that was likely where Rhodes would be entering. He hit a button on the wall to get the MK13 suit out of the way just as Rhodes touched down on the landing pad.
"You sure?" Steve asked. "Because I can go with you if you're not okay." Tony felt his cheeks warm and his lips curve up at the sentiment.
"It feels like it," Steve said. "It feels like that fear will never go away, no matter how much I try."
Speaking of problems to sift through, by the time they were almost done with the meeting, they were interrupted by a knock at the door. However, it seemed the knock was just a formality because as soon it stopped, Cabe came flying through the door. Much like everyone else, she was clearly upset, but for her it manifested as clear and unbridled anger. Despite that, she was careful to gently set down the flash drive she was carrying down on the table as she walked up to it.
"It's just knowing where to start is hard," he admitted. "I have some hundred-thousand questions running through my head and I don't know what to ask first."
"That's not a common American saying?" Tony shook his head. "Wow. Okay, everything I know is a lie." The coffee maker beeped, and Tony poured himself a cup before moving to sit across from Lara at the table.
"We think your father might have kept files that contained key information about a problem we are currently facing. This information could prove to be an invaluable asset in finding a solution to that problem."
"We don't have lunatic asylums anymore either," Tony said. "We kind of got rid of those after we found out how bad places like Willowbrook were."
"But Stark has to." Tony's stomach began to sink. "Tell me, Mr. Stark, do you have faith in this woman who has lied to you, stolen from you, and endangered your life already?" Tony tried to speak, but Pepper beat him to it.
That always made Loki shiver. He knew exactly how Thanos would repay a failure to produce results or an outright betrayal, and the Other was right. Integration would be nothing compared to that. Loki was determined to keep that from happening at all costs.
"Hey, Nat…" Natasha surged forward and covered Clint's mouth before he could say any more. He had just turned a corner that Freeman had already passed when he noticed her and luckily Freeman was too absorbed in his conversation to notice the two of them. Nat had her hand over Clint's mouth until Freeman reached the end of the hallway where it emptied out into the lobby. Once he was gone, she let out a breath of relief. "What the hell…?"
A door then opened, shut, and locked. Steve tried to fight off sleep if possible, but unfortunately, it was a foe that even Captain America couldn't beat. He eventually shut his eyes and let the darkness claim him again.
"First of all, I just want to make it clear that we're not going to confront Tony," Natasha said. "This isn't going to be an intervention. It's completely up to Tony whether he wants to talk to us and we're not going to do anything other than ask what we can do to help him. That's all."
"Sorry." It came out a little more begrudging than he would have liked, but Tony still shrugged in acceptance.
"Yeah," Tony said. "That's what I thought." Tony jerked his arm back to get Knežević to let go. Knežević fell to his knees but sprung up quickly, scrambling past Tony and back towards the beach. Tony flew over to where the jetty met the shore, intending to block his path of escape. "So, what are my options here?"
. Airing out his dirty laundry in public? No, that was something he'd only do if he had a gun to his head and some whack-job's finger hovering over a button to detonate the world's complete nuclear stockpile if he refused, and even then he'd still desperately try to find another way out of the situation. None of this was lost on Carol.
"I thought it was Xanax," he explained. "The bottle said Xanax, but I guess what inside wasn't Xanax."
"And we saw you all in action during the Battle of New York," Everhart said. "Speaking of which, what was it like being in the heat of all of that; the fighting and whatnot?"
I'm so sorry about this everyone. If I have enough chapters written, maybe I'll be back in September, but honestly, I'm not going to promise anything.
"But you don't." Natasha's smile disappeared. "You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?"
"My father's files?" His voice was too tired to properly convey the confusion and suspicion he was feeling. "Depends on which ones and why."
Being CEO of a multi-national conglomeration like Stark Industries was no easy task. There were deals to be made, shareholders to keep happy, stock prices and the overall health of the company to keep up with. Not to mention all the deadlines to meet and the paperwork to do. Tony had chosen well when he picked Pepper Potts as his successor. She was a master businesswoman in her own right and had been by his side running the company for years as his personal assistant. She was the natural choice for the role. However, her increase in responsibilities left little time in her workday for anything else, and that included constantly worrying about Tony Stark.
"Chiot!" Steve looked to the screaming woman first and saw that she had gone to the ground. She held out her arms and immediately a puppy ran into them. Lara started saying words of affection to the dog in French while scratching behind his ears. The dog responded by attempting to lick her face off. The pure joy in her laughter was undercut when Natasha spoke up.
"Don't 'Tony' me! First, you press me in the car and now you don't want to know? No! You don't get to do that! Now shut up and listen!"
Steve's eyes went wide. He watched as Tony clearly struggled to get out of the officer's grip, but they were unrelenting. They carried him out of shot through the front doors. They were only gone for a few seconds before they became visible again. However, it was only the officer's backs that were visible as it appeared, they were stopping someone (presumably Tony) from trying to re-enter the building. After a few moments, they fully re-entered the building without Tony.
Having gotten ready, Jessica headed up the basement stairs to get to work. Salinas was sure to be gone by now and there would be another twenty to thirty minutes until the workers showed up. She would have the house to herself, but unfortunately, in order to keep her cover, she would have to spend it mopping the floors and scrubbing the counters. Otherwise, she would have spent the time getting into some
Steve wasn't worried until he opened the door. He was shocked to find that the bed was still made and there was no sign of Tony anywhere. He flipped on the light, but it didn't make anything clearer. Even though it was obvious Tony wasn't there, Steve couldn't help but call out his name, hoping desperately that his boyfriend would respond.
"It's just that…" Lorraine started. "Well, they're both already so well-adjusted. Audrey's starting her senior year soon, she's thinking about college, and Stephanie has her own friends and problems as well, but they're happy. Things are good. I don't want you to come in here and mess that up."
He scooched forward so he could reach Steve's mouth better. As he leaned in, Tony watched as Steve shut his eyes and started to relax. As much as it delighted him to see Steve so ready and willing to give himself over to him, he could not go in for the kill just yet. Instead, his lips hovered tantalizingly close to Steve's allowing his hot breath to fan over both of their faces as he asked, "you promise to go right to sleep after this?"
"Possibly," Romanoff said. "I'm still looking into it. Let's see… Served in the Essex County DA's office… Married with two daughters… Oh, this is interesting."
"Maybe," Oswin admitted. "I'm not sure. Probably, but I'm not all that computer savvy. I only know the basics, so Skype's pretty much our only option."
Getting out of bed, Tony pressed a kiss to Steve's temple and whispered that he was just going to get breakfast. Steve made a noise, but otherwise he didn't acknowledge that Tony had spoken to him at all and continued to sleep on. Tony sighed a little bit in disappointment, but the feeling didn't last long. After all, he couldn't be mad at that adorable sleeping face for too long.
helping you out. Try again." At last, Tony could finally see that using half-excuses was not going to get him anywhere. As much as he hated it, he had to tell the truth.
"Thank you for your help, sir." She and Clint then turned and started rushing down the stairs. Bruce called out after them, but they didn't stop. Steve took the hint and followed them, running down the stairs at top speed.
"I'm fine," he assured. "Outside of a few minor scrapes, nobody's hurt." Steve let out a breath of relief.
"But you will," Tony said. "Because it's not just me who has to go, it's all of us. You heard what Freeman said. The Avengers need to be seen showing support for the American public and the people we failed to protect in New York. All of us must go. Not some of us and certainly not none of us; all of us."
"I'm sure we have some crackers in a cabinet somewhere. Do you think your stomach can handle that?" Tony shrugged.
Nightmare, he thought. It was just a nightmare. Despite his attempts to reassure himself, Tony couldn't help but be reminded that it wasn't just a nightmare. That happened to him less than four months ago, the only difference being that he hadn't died. He had fallen back through the portal and the Hulk had caught him before he had hit the ground. He was still alive, but it felt like he couldn't escape that moment.
Police chatter and records disclose a lot. For example, if there was a psycho going around killing people by turning them into stone, they'd take notice of it and be scrambling to try and stop it. Tony had no idea how that was even possible – in fact, he was worried that he had passed out back at the hospital and this was all some sort of crazed fever dream – but apparently, that's what was going down.
should be accompanying her." Instantly, Tony put his feet back down on the ground and Lara came to a stop next to Happy. Neither her nor Tony dropped the disappointed looks from their faces. DeMarcus sighed. "There's nothing I can do here. Unless you, Miss Potts, want an update on our case against the Hay-Adams Hotel…" Tony's brows knitted in confusion.
"Nothing," she said. "It's just refreshing to hear." After all, it wasn't a statement she heard from men often. "So, you're worried that if you go near her, she's going to get hurt."
"Wait," one of the singers said. "Isn't this supposed to be where the birthday party is?" All gazes turned to Lara.
Loki's heart beat at a frantic rate. Even though he'd been tossed aside by his "father" once again in favor of Thor, he didn't want to see Asgard destroyed or its people eradicated. He wanted to rule them, not wipe them from the universe entirely. So, he thought fast, trying to come up with anything he could say to prevent the Titan from attacking the realm he had once called home.
"Steve and Tony already sunk that boat," Bruce pointed out. "What's one more person?" Lara couldn't argue with that.
"No, you won't," Smith said. "You shouldn't have taken off the oxygen mask and exerting yourself like this is just going to make it harder for you to breathe."
"Well, first you told me Howard forced you to drink alcohol at nine years old." Tony let go of a breath he'd been holding for the past thirty-two years. He couldn't believe what a relief it was. It was like someone had pulled a leech of his chest.
Speaking of reality, Steve realized that he should probably snap back to it. He spent enough time mulling over his own anxieties. He needed to figure out what was going on with dinner so that way he could ensure that both he and Tony ate before they went off to bed.
Luckily, Lara noticed his distress and took him by the elbow and gently guided him out of the elevator and down the hallway. Steve didn't lower his hands until the decibels stopped ringing in his ears.
"What about Clint?" Hill bit her lip and in three seconds flat she had gone from all-business to sympathetic.
From a young age, Charles had been a staunch Atheist. Despite his family's urgings, he never believed in God or Jesus or any other religious figure. He saw them as just as fraudulent as Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. As soon as he could, he left home without looking back, attending Culver University in Virginia, hundreds of miles away from his hometown and family. However, he still couldn't escape the stranglehold religion had on society. It shouldn't have surprised him. It
Tony couldn't help it. He started bawling in the second sentence. When Steve finished, he pulled him in for the wettest, most snot-covered kiss of his life. When he pulled back, his breathing was staggered.
He still needed to know why the doctors felt it necessary to restrain him. He tried lifting his arms up to gesture to the doctor what was wrong. She gave a little self-satisfied smirk in response.
"Ah," Lara commented. "One of those mornings." She tried to get a look at what he was doing but found it hard as from where she was standing behind the counter, Bruce's writing looked upside down. It also didn't help that English was her second language. "What are you doing? Anything I can help with?"
A paw on his chest and a soft whine reminded Clint of the other likely impulsive thing he did in the last week; the dog. Clint scratched his ear, giving him the attention, he had so desperately needed. Admittedly, things had fallen into place a lot better than they could have. Laura was willing to keep the dog and Stark wasn't aware that Clint had kept the dog at the tower longer than he said he would. He got lucky there. However, he did have to admit that he didn't consider the potential consequences in the three seconds between seeing the dog and deciding to rescue it.
"I probably shouldn't stay the night," Lara said. "I have really bad nightmares a lot of the time and that would probably make an already stressful situation worse."
"Wow," she said. "Thank you, but now I just feel worse about filing the lawsuit without talking to you first."
Bruce had returned from S.H.I.E.L.D. early on Monday morning. He had managed to get some in the accommodations they had provided, but he had been glad to hear that he could return to the Tower and planned on getting some rest in his own bed (and yes, that still felt weird to say) as soon as he got back.
"Romanoff, I think you need to back off a little bit," he said. "I think he might be having a panic attack."
Natasha was on a warpath. She barely took notice of her surroundings as she passed, which wasn't a problem until she was outside, marching straight into the assembled crowd of gawkers. Steve and Hill found themselves apologizing for her to all the people she bumped into and shoved. It took longer than it should have and by the time they got back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. car, Nat was already sitting in the backseat, her arms crossed impatiently.
"Dr. Banner," Steve called out to the scientist, who looked very awkward and out of place. He held out his hand for the other man to shake.
Oswin burst into tears at that point. Knežević handed her tissues but was otherwise useless to comfort her. She eventually composed herself enough to start talking again.
"Okay, all I need you to do is reset the circuits," Tony explained. "I think when the explosion happened there was a huge power surge and the whole thing just overloaded. All you need to do is pull the switches above the plugs towards the center of the box on both sides. That sound easy enough?"
Walking over to the People's Unity Church, Carol wasn't sure what to expect. She had tried to scope out the place the night before but couldn't get a good look at things in the dark. Seeing it in the light of day, though, probably should have been more shocking than it was. The building very clearly used to be an elementary school.
She grabbed him by the wrist and started pulling him towards the door. He didn't immediately resist. He was somehow just aware enough of his surroundings to know that starting a scene in front of such a crowd wasn't a good idea. He waited until they were out in the hall and out of view of other people to pull his wrist back. Lara's grip broke rather easily and once he freed the limb, Tony cradled it against his chest protectively.
"I'm okay. Don't worry. Go back to sleep." As an example, Tony rolled over so he was close to Steve and went back to sleep.
"Oh, there you are," she said as she walked through the archway. "I was looking for you guys in the apartment, but you weren't there."
"Sheffield, call the police." Out of the corner of her eye, Lara could see the man behind the desk next to her punching in numbers on his landline's keypad. She kept her gaze solidly on Dante, though.
Once they had gotten their food and returned to the lounge, Bruce sat down on the floor next to Lara, while Rhodey slid off the couch and onto the floor so Pepper could have a place to sit. Tony did a quick introduction between Pepper and Carol from where he sat in Steve's lap. He did his best to explain who Carol was and how they knew her in as few sentences as possible so as not to disturb those watching the movie (Steve.) Thankfully, it didn't take much to get Pepper to understand and once they were officially introduced, she greeted Carol with kindness.
"That seems like it'd be likely," he said. "But I know we had nothing in there that could pose a threat to the whole building – at least not anymore." He, too, was keenly aware of the chlorine gas incident. "Standard protocol would be to seal up the lab and let the air filtration system do it's job."
