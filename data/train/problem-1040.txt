Mrs Hudson shrugged.  “I’d assumed that was how much he’d been paid for the case.”
I glanced at Holmes and he returned the look, raising a brow before he resumed his scrutiny of the scene below.
Sherlock fell silent.
“What would he want with a human?” Sherlock asked.  “Even a tasty one,” he added silently.
“Yes, I must.  I’ve only been practicing the music for it on the harp.”
“Drink from me now,” John said.
"How?" I murmured and clapped my hand to my mouth.
“Unless there was some other magic at work that none of us noticed,” she said and refilled my tea cup.
My eyes perceived only shadows above me, but my muscles felt his weight, the lesser or greater give of bone or sinew.  Lips suckled at my neck, teeth nipped at my ear and a rampant cock rutted between my thighs.
"Thunder storm.  Lightning struck the Enfield Power Station."
The room I entered was smaller than the library and illuminated by the lights that shone through four tall stained glass windows.  I felt sure there must be brighter lighting available in the room and that these had been lit first to enhance their effect.  I stood and admired them unabashedly.  If Mr Holmes was showing off his house to me, I was not going to hide my appreciation.
“The death of her son struck a blow to Mrs Knight’s health from which she never recovered and a month before our gathering she, too, had died.”
"They were building this," Sherlock said with a wave at the Tower.  He nodded at the body.  This one was beheaded and river did the rest, the limbs over there are from someone who was drawn and quartered before he was thrown in."
“Exactly,” Sherlock called from the landing.  “Bread!”
John set the poker aside, picked up his mobile and punched at the keys.
“Oh, is that you two?” Mrs Hudson called.  “We were wondering whether you’d decided to stay in Summer.  I wouldn’t blame you with this weather we’ve been having.  I’ll get you some tea.”  I heard the door close.
Sherlock grimaced at John and jingled the tags on the dog’s collar.
Mrs Hudson held a cup up for him.
I swung the bag over my shoulder.  “I’ll admit I enjoyed it, too.”
Ms Swann’s eyes widened further.  “How do you know these things?”
The toe of Sherlock’s shoe bumped my heel and I stepped forward.  If his parents were waiting, I supposed that was our first destination.  I walked in that direction and hoped our perfumes were as efficacious as Sherlock claimed.
I sighed.
He turned on the cushion to face me.  “You’re not who you think you are, John.”
John had turned more fully, drawn a leg up on the sofa.  “Like something you experienced as a child.”
I popped the raspberry in my mouth.  It tasted sweeter than the others.
“I’ll call Jean-Pierre and tell him to contact you directly to complete arrangements, yeah?” Greg said from the doorway.  “Which flight are you taking?”
“Ah,” I said between bites and helped myself to a couple more sandwiches.  “I forgot about lunch today.”
I would have objected to his holding it at all if it hadn’t so quickly been back in my grasp.  Sherlock had given it me and it had served me well.  My fingers tightened around it.
“Could you do that again?” he asked and a fourth arrow appeared in his hand.
“And you weren’t supposed to be using any of them,” Mycroft added.
“Never learned,” I replied, quelling the urge to mention that I could throw a knife very accurately.
“You can have your blade in a moment,” Sherlock said.  “Only three more, but you need to turn over for me to do them.”
I settled on his thighs.  His throat in easy reach now, I fell to kissing it.
Sherlock nodded.  “After last night, I think she knows she isn’t imagining the connection between ‘her’ swan, and the man whose been shadowing her.”
There had been further blood samples in the lab refrigerator and the pathogens I had found on the slides I prepared had become rarer and rarer.  For hours, I had been saying to myself just one more as I clipped another slide to the platform of the microscope.
The lights of the police helicopter hovering above the Tate’s forecourt illuminated the embankment in both directions and much of the southern foreshore as well.
I stared up at him, waiting to hear what more he would say.  His face looked less tense than it had been.
Another dancer took her place; he jingled as he smirked.  “Good evening, Doctor Watson.”
I took a few steps further into the room.  I could almost hear the music waiting to be played.  I pivoted slowly, cataloguing details.  I was not assessing or doing anything practical like seeing if I could identify the panel through which we had gained access to the room.  It had closed without my noticing it, as camouflaged now as it had been in the library, as if leaving was not an option.

with who knows what story about you, neither of us will be surprised,” Mrs Hudson said.
“Old habits,” she said. “What with watches and phones to tell the time, hardly anyone bothers to know where the sun and the moon are anymore.”
My breath whistled out of me.  I had it now...delicate against the tip of my finger.
I did not argue about taking it along.
The room was stuffy, but the warmth felt good on my back, which was the wettest part of me other than my feet.
“You saw the figure in the fire,” Sherlock replied.
His eyes met mine.
I drew in a pained breath.
The sofa looks incomplete.
“You don’t really mean that,” he replied, unbuckling, unzipping and otherwise laying me bare.
I smiled at him.  They were great biscuits.
“So, what’s so special about the book, other than it’s old?” I asked, hooking the bag on the corner of a desk chair.
Walking with an open vessel full of steaming liquid requires concentration.  I stepped off the final riser onto the tiles of the front hall and waited for the liquid to settle.
His fingertips were cool against my heated skin.  He traced them teasingly over me in spirals and undulating lines.
Sherlock’s back stiffened as he turned to face Mycroft and held out his other hand.  “The key, if you please, assuming you were able to counteract Puck’s noxious potions.”
“Still, they could neither eat them nor live in them,” Holmes said, returning to his seat.  “But all this is beside the point.  How did your Madame Willow know where those keys were?”
“I can hear the but, John, spit it out!” Sherlock said.  “What kind of biscuits?”
“Now and then.”  She lifted the lid of the teapot and a new fragrance joined the scent of pine and juniper that suffused the room.  Gently, she replaced the lid.  “My grandmother did.  Often.  In the middle of basting meat on the spit, she’d go still, butter dripping off the brush, and one of the children would run to get Doctor Hooper.  He could see and interpret, too.  The two gifts don’t always come together.”
“He did not look like a man who had just come into property,” I remarked.
Somehow, he was beside me, an arm under one of mine.  “You should sit,” he urged and made to slip the dagger under his belt.
I read the screen with him:
I picked up my tea and took a sip, let it sit on my tongue before I swallowed.  I took a deep breath and savoured the scent of spice cake and charred wood, old leather and a faint hint of dog.  I exhaled and leaned back in the well-cushioned chair as the last traces of damp and chill that had beset me in the street were burnt away by the fire.
“Interested in fencing?” he asked.
I re-opened one eye for a second.
“No!”  He shouted, striding back through the door.  He took a deep breath when he stood before me again and regarded me from beneath lowered brows. “We have begun,” he said quietly.
“John,” Mrs Hudson called through the door, “that pretty lady doctor called twice.  She wants to know if you can work this afternoon.  Someone’s sick.  She said who, but I didn’t catch the name.  Could you call her back?”
“Oh?”
“Stronger beats,” he said and her wide, wide wings pushed the air down.
“They mind him,” Wiggins said, “but an occasion like this doesn’t come along every day.  They’re buzzing, I can tell you, excited and a bit alarmed by the shortness of the deadline.  We usually have more time to prepare.”
My glance flicked up; his vest was over his head.
He had folded back the covers, spread his dressing gown on the white sheets and was reclining, upper half against the stacked pillows, lower half on his side along the blue silk, odalisque-style.
I did take the deep breath though and continued to scan the façade:  stone at ground level, brick above, wrought iron balconies running along the first floor.  An ordinary house in an ordinary terrace of houses.
“I mixed him a mild dose of laudanum,” I sighed, “and sat with him until it took effect.”  Sherlock knew the reservations I had about excessive recourse to the drug and the opinion I had already formed of Corvus’ use of it for more than medicinal purposes.  “Plain whiskey was not going to suffice, and he needed the sleep.  It’s obvious that he has been getting little of it.”
A drum and a flute began to play to each other.
The book was warm in my hand.  It felt a trespass to examine such a private thing, even if he had given us what I surmised must be an extract.  The pages marked off were far more numerous than could have been transcribed onto the few pages he had sent us.
Across the vast room, a single bell tinkled.
Another peal of laughter rang out, louder than the drums.
"The rest of that poor bloke," I whispered, hoping that the dismemberment had been post-mortem.
John looked back at Ms Swann.
“Just here,” Sherlock said.  “Wait for us.”
“Well,” Mrs Hudson said, taking Miss Turner by the arm, “we won’t keep you from your desserts any longer.”
“Not lately, no.”
“No, they wouldn’t.  The spell of the play would have been upon them, so many true names in it.”  Mycroft tapped the thorn against the root.  “I warned Father that playwright was not a fellow with whom to dally.”  Mycroft placed the thorn in a groove in the bark and sighed. “But good King Oberon has never cared to deny himself the pursuit of a fancy.  ‘It will be forgotten in a few years, names and all,’ was his astute analysis.  Four centuries on and I’m still managing the consequences.”
“I’ve been informed that we have a guest who will not be leaving.”
“There,” she said, pointing at a round table nestled in a corner beneath an arbour of wisteria.
I spilled and spilled; his other hand rubbing it over my belly then down between my thighs.  I tried to hold them tightly together for him, but my muscles were relaxing, my mind beginning to drift.  I tried harder.
“Faster,” he insisted and she went faster, the whir of their wings loud in the morning stillness.
Outside, the leaves rubbed against one another; silvery clouds raced past the moon.
I thought it best not to drink it, but touched it to my lips and smiled in thanks.  Though the coins may have included refreshments, I felt inclined to offer something in return.  A packet of mints in my jacket pocket appeared to have withstood my dousing, so I peeled back the foil wrapper and took one of the candies to demonstrate its edible nature and offered the open roll to my host.
That was certainly true.  I listened for the snick of the latch.  Satisfied that a draft could not push the panel open again, I returned to the piano bench.
I darted to the other side, hands ready to explore.  This time it was a knot that depressed when my forefinger slid over it.  I stared into the cavity revealed, stretched my hand into the darkness.  Cool metal met it.  I felt cautiously with my foot and found the first step.
I watched him circle the fountain, feeling uneasy each time he was out of sight on the other side of it.
The patterns felt intricate and I felt wonderful.  I would have liked to stretch, but I resisted.
Probably not.
“Yet,” Sherlock said.
"Ever thought about getting some tranquiliser guns?" I asked on the way up the stairs.
He stared at me.
Holmes swabbed some residue from the bottom of the test tube and smeared it onto a glass slide.  “Send Billy round to the post office with a telegram message granting Mr Corvus his interview, then lock the door when you come back.  I’m nearly done here.”
With one downward swipe, I sliced through tunic and shirt and flesh.
Oh, the things he has done to me with his.
I gasped.
John jogged through the arched tunnel beneath the bridge.
In twos and threes, other guests were turning to look, too, but the hubbub I expected to erupt did not materialise.  In truth, their comments were subdued.  Perhaps it was familiar to them.
“I won’t know until the end of the month, but I’ll get another month’s salary if either of us decide to call it quits,” I explained.
“If you will be staying, Doctor,” Mr Holmes said, “you’ll need a tour of the premises.”
I turned to the remaining parcel, grateful for the bracing draught along the floor.  The imperative of sleep was vanishing.
I raised my eyebrows and inclined my head in agreement.
Introductions completed, Dean Bradley gave the choristers a cue and their angel-voiced funeral hymn marked the beginning of the service.  The choir lent their chime-like tones to several pieces of liturgical music before singing two songs that Sherlock whispered to me were both composed by Ushers.  The final piece the choristers sang was later identified by Corvus as a song Roderick had written for his sister on her twenty-first birthday.  I understood what Corvus had meant about the beauty of the melodies being unorthodox, but their mournful airs suited the occasion well.  In place of a eulogy, Corvus explained that he would read one of the last poems Roderick Usher had shared with him.  It was the one Corvus had transcribed into the narrative he had sent to Sherlock and me.  It was with difficulty that Corvus pronounced its last lines.
“If you could read those to me, Dr Watson,” Holmes said and settled back in his chair with his eyes closed.
"Chapalu will have heard Baskerville's whining," he said.
“Literature, yes.  Of the fanciful sort.  The occasional wild claim in the tabloid press.  If there’s ever been any secret research, I suppose Mycroft would know, but I wasn’t able to find any and I’m not going to ask him.”
The drag on my muscles lessened.  There were footsteps on the stairs.  Sherlock rose enough to get an elbow on the edge of the frame, then a foot on the other side.  He pushed back against me, got his arse over the edge and onto the floor.
Sherlock waved his antennae across John’s skin.  It was growing hotter and flushed.  He bit gently at the other nipple’s edge, more fiercely at the centre and more than once.
“No,” Mycroft said, “he gave the key to Father and told him it would open a pretty little box in which something had been locked away that would be of great interest to him.”
Then, I could see my balcony.
Sherlock did not reply.  His eyes were fixed on the monitor, his hand poised above the touch pad.
Sherlock held up a dish that had been hidden by the drinks menu.  Upon it were fortune cookies.
Sherlock peered at the small bits of card not concealed by my hand.  “Has the king of clubs joined the knave of diamonds?”
“What?”
The hall reverberated with the blows of pommels against the door.  Axes slashed at the oak, sticking in the thick wood.  The echoes grew louder, bouncing off the brick walls.
“Witches,” Sherlock stated above my head.
How had I not heard Wiggins while we were out on the balcony and how had he managed it so fast?
Yes, well.
“It did cross my mind, but the Actors’ Guild would have lost two further luminaries if they are,” I replied.
“Lunch at the Criterion afterwards,” he added.
“The Minstrel fell, but the foeman’s chains could not bring his proud soul under.
The music played on.
Some make their home,
I shook my head, took out mine instead and drank deep.
“Yes,” he replied, leaning forward and confirming his answer with a kiss.
Mycroft drew a thorn across a flattened rose petal.  He pressed a fresh leaf over the fine design left behind, and rolled the two into a scroll.
“You can’t.  Struggle as much as you like against it.  I like to watch the stronger ones struggle for a while with the effects of the first leech, but the second one always ends it.”
I remembered what Sherlock had said about her true talent being for potions.  “I’ve found it slow going,” I said.
“My parents ran the shop; my mother handled the bookkeeping and the ordering.  My father made up the bouquets and did some cross-breeding in the little greenhouse out back of the shop and my sister was born,” she said.  “That’s when I started coming back to spend the summers with my grandparents here or in France.  Nan said it gave Mama some time alone with Lily, like she had had with me.  I did that every year until Papa got a very good offer for the shop and decided he would take it and we would emigrate to Canada.  After that it was too far to visit every year.  In fact, I didn’t until I came for Da’s funeral.  I had already moved to New York by then.  I had dreams of dancing on Broadway, you see.”  She sighed.  “Life does take some unexpected twists and turns.”
Somewhere, a clock began to chime.
My eyes fixed on Holmes, the charming scenery forgotten.  “In what way does he romantise his hearing of this tune?”
It went on like that for another quarter of an hour.  He passed the entrances to a few formal reception rooms and a huge dining room with a wave.  “My parents use those occasionally when they’re in London, which is mercifully rare.”  And then we were in a courtyard.
Yeah.
“Are you all right, dear?” she repeated.
“Her father always hoped she would carry on after him here.  He asked her about it when he was dying, but her mother thought it would be better if she stayed in the job she had where she was already established and where it was ‘more social’,” Mrs Hudson said and took a sip of tea.  “We all knew Molly was sweet on Sherlock; he was her first crush.  She never grew out of it, but that was never going to happen.  She still gives him blood and body parts when he wants them for experiments though, poor dear.”
“You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you, because you never looked at those photographs?”
“You expected a leading lady not a character actor,” he commented.  “Lady Macbeth, perhaps?”
“Good luck, then,” Greg said and got in the car.
Sherlock mumbled into his bunched-up pillow.
The butterfly drifted downwards, landed on the mouthpiece of the clarinet.
“Where’d that come from?” I asked, raising my chin towards the case Sherlock carried.
I set aside my cup and sought my dagger’s hilt.
I kept the statue in sight as I backed away after Greg and Sherlock turned and strode towards the nearest constable.  It may have been a trick of the light, but the sculpture’s eyes seemed to gleam as we retreated.
The air stilled.  The torchlight brightened.
But I didn’t think it mattered.
We were stood on another minstrels’ gallery, having stepped through a panel in the middle of the gallery in the music room.
“Wouldn’t your bedroom be better?” I asked.  “I can bring my medical kit there.”
I bit my lip.
“I could still hear you playing,” he replied.  “You’re getting very good at that melody.”
I carried on shuffling until it came down and he began to scowl.  I set the deck near him.  “Cut.”
There was a flurry of wings and the falcon landed on his shoulder.
The shopkeeper turned towards the back of the shop with the pot.  “Give a shout if you need help reaching anything,” he said, looking back over his shoulder.
“What?”
“You gave your dog a pirate name,” John exclaimed, grinning.
Kit was looking in the same direction.  He backed up against me.
Mrs Hudson tilted her chin up.  “No, but she said things about you, like how forgetful you are and short-tempered then waited as though she thought I’d say something back one way or the other.”
“Lestrade consults me on a fairly regular basis.  It’s best for you to meet him immediately and see what my work with him entails,” he continued.
One of John’s hands closed around Sherlock’s balls.  “Better and better,” he said and bowed until he could draw the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth.
"It's a place well-prepared to defend itself."
My head was upright because of Sherlock’s supporting shoulder.  It was the position from which I had watched the elder Holmeses depart, their conveyance borne aloft by silent wings and trailing an aurora such as I only dreamt I would ever see.
When you and I will be as one.”
I glanced up at him.  “They were among the ingredients in a couple of the preparations in the book I’ve been reading.”
"Weapons by the door," Sherlock said, strolling in that direction.  "If you could take mine, too," he added, "I'll take this."  He picked up a small, metal chest from a table on the way.
She stroked down what was left of his tattered sleeve.  “I’m sorry, Sherlock.  There was so much we didn’t see.  That we didn’t protect you from.”
“No.”
No reason occurred to me.  It was a reflex.  It was fear.
“But isn’t his older brother here, too?”
He bent near my ear.  “I’ve searched this room.  I wanted to search the bedroom, but the housekeeper was dashing in and out.  It’s where Madeline Usher stayed when she was in London, with an adjoining door to Roderick’s room.  Those have been their bedrooms since they were children.”
I have awoken in some peculiar places, but opening my eyes and realising I was on a steel table in a morgue was definitely  in the top ten, maybe even the top five.  I blinked against the bright light above me, then gave up and closed my eyes again.  My feet were cold.  Someone had removed my socks and shoes...or perhaps I had.  How I had came to be in my current position was a blank.  I hoped I had not keeled over in the midst...ah, the midst of the dissection.  I turned my head, felt something silky against my cheek, inhaled the scent of lavender.  Perhaps I should just sleep some more.  The paper sheets over me rustled.
I narrowed my eyes in the faint light.  Water poured down the backs of the outer statues, splashed over the little bridge.  It was this movement of the water that was catching the light and making the figures seem to undulate.  I scanned the other balconies looking for sources of light other than the moon.  There was nothing but deeper shadows, almost human in shape, against the dark windows as though others looked out on the scene from their balconies with the same interest as I.  The plash of the fountain reverberated from the courtyard walls, sounding like sighs in the confined space.  The shapes on the balconies seemed to merge, shifting with a rhythm that matched the fall of the water.
I sighed.  “Perhaps.”
John’s eyebrows shot up.
Intense as it is, I don’t think I am.
He hummed again.
“I wasn’t finished looking at that,” Greg protested.
“That amount of time would not be long for me,” Sherlock replied, licking the moisture from John’s skin.  “You are interesting and in other forms, I can drink your blood.”
Sherlock looked at me over his shoulder.  “You’re not annoyed?”
“I hope that’s the worst that will happen.”
“About where Speedy’s and the next couple houses to the north are,” he replied.
“It tells me not only what you saw, but what you felt about what you saw,” he answered softly, tilting his head.  The moonlight illuminated more of his face.
“After calling on the Morrows, I felt I had to explore further.  I only just caught them before they departed for the Continent.  There were trunks and cases stacked in the foyer.  They were both going to stay for a few weeks with a friend who kept an apartment in Paris, then all were going on to Rome where another friend would rendezvous with them.  Further plans sounded like a long-delayed grand tour of sorts.”
John took out his mobile and photographed both pages of the report before handing it back to Ms Swann.  “And the genetic material was contaminated in the testing process as well, they write.”
“Yes, indeed.  And the parks.  And the swans.”  She fell quiet.
“I’ll make you hot,” I promised, my hand smoothing down his cold chest.  “You’ve got nothing on.  Get in here.”  I sat up and pushed the covers off me.  Goosebumps rose on my bare skin.
I drew in a sharp breath and glanced back at the hearth.
My breathing came more quickly.
“The ice pack on my head last night should have been a clue,” I replied as my hand wandered down his side.
John closed his eyes for a moment.  “Angelo will be upset.”
Mid-way, Sherlock stopped and pointed to the water in the direction we had traversed along its bank.  It curved out of sight around a row of willows.
“Go,” Sherlock urged.
Sherlock was lifting lids and revealing plates of cold beef and cheese, tomatoes and onions and small loaves of bread.  “Eat, John,” he said.  “I don’t think tonight’s case was an isolated incident.  We saved Ms Dunbar, but I believe there will be others.”  He tapped the top bookshelf next to the fireplace.  “Tomorrow, I should like you to begin reviewing these.  Skim until you find the deviations from the familiar medical symptoms.  It may prove useful to us in the coming weeks.”
Holmes’s eyes narrowed.  “And these highly unusual circumstances convinced you of the medium’s authenticity?”
~~~~~~ooO0Ooo~~~~~~
Stop!
“I love my love, and well he knows, I love the grass whereon he goes,” I sang softly and my voice flew about the quiet room.
“Deck the halls,” I murmured.
I want to earn his good opinion.
He set the bow to the strings, paused to adjust the pegs after the first notes, then played.
The tune rose and fell and I rose and fell with it, listening to his breath catch at the end of every phrase.
“I could taste it,” he said.
I pulled an open journal on haematology closer and scanned the article for the place where I had left off.
Her brow furrowed as she pulled out a desk chair and sat down.  “How’d you get it out, then?”
“Pond,” Sherlock said and took off up the path.  With one more glance back at the bridge, John followed.
“I didn’t prepare anything for tonight,” I said.
There was a small sound at the door.
Yeah, we’re too far back for the gun to work.  Good as I was with an arrow or a dagger, I did often rue not being able to rely on my gun.
“One can’t do that too often,” he replied.
It was an interesting observation.
“You dashed off without even getting a bite of it,” she said, stepping into the room, “so I brought up some for you and Sherlock…oh, you got the box open.”  She smiled and put the plate down on the coffee table.  “How did you do it?”
“Time is particularly flexible up here,” he said.  “You’ll see.”  He turned back towards the crowd.  “Shall we deliver our branches?”
“A modest being,” John managed to reply.  The muscular weight shifting above him demanded his attention, the soft lips brushing over the tiny wounds in his skin made him stutter.
When we were older, it had been cool to swagger close enough to the door to touch the brass knocker and if we sauntered a bit faster once we had, we didn’t call one another on it.  Well, not until we were older still and thoroughly drunk by the time we left the pub on the corner after a game.
He shook his head.  “I can’t explain more yet.”
I never missed a beat.  My blood beat in time to it now.
Slowly, my eyes adjusted to the dark.  The outlines of pairs of figures took shape, clasped together back to front, ringing most of the way around the tree-like centre sculpture.  The inner statue of the nearest pair seemed to cling to the tree, the statue behind pressing close, its nearer arm disappearing around its mate’s waist, the forearm of the other leaning against the tree above its partner’s head.  A couple shallow steps bridged the fountain’s pool at the point on the tree trunk without figures.
“I’m curious to see where you’ve been since you got back."
Sherlock pressed his hips down, cold and hard against my thigh.
John’s notes went higher still, his fingers fluttering over the keys.
I inhaled.  He’d never admitted that before.
I did know, felt it in the clench of my stomach and the tension in my thighs.
“…Or going up with the music
He snatched up our clothing and, keeping a hand on one of my elbows, led me to the panel that opened into the passageway.
John opened an eye.  “Is this heaven?” he mumbled into the pillow.
“He’s worth the wait though, because beneath that icy shell, I know he’s on fire, too.”  Wild Eyes glanced back at me, his hand slipping up Sherlock’s arm as he spoke, kneading the flesh as he went.  “You saw it straight away, too.  I can tell.  I admire clear-sightedness in a man.”
Sherlock cleared his throat.  “Yes, well.”
John threw his shoulders back and marched inside, closed the door and leaned against it.  The heavy weave of an outer garment, redolent of tobacco, brushed the side of his face.  The bright rectangles above the shutters shed no light on the room.  By his feet, the arrow of wood and red carpet faded slowly.  Any chance that a different Sherlock had taken up residence in his house, faded with it.
I opened my eyes.  My tears were falling on his shoes.  “Well, now you do.”
Sherlock smiled, grabbed my hand and dropped the three berries in it.  “Elsewhere, they do.”
He struggled with the bedclothes, flung them to the floor and sat up, panting.  His eyes flitted about the room.  The wardrobe loomed.  The chair crouched.  Grey light seeped in around the window shade.  “No,” he shouted and covered his face with his hands.  “No, no, no, no, no.”
John rubbed his fingertips over the embossed butterfly on the green leather.  The design was so like the one his grandfather’s album had had.  He lifted the cover.  The gilt on the butterfly glimmered with the movement.  The edges of the paper inside had yellowed, but the etchings on the first page were the ones he remembered, their colours unfaded.  Carefully, he turned the brittle page.  All the recesses in the heavy card beneath it were filled, the common and Latin names of the specimens of
“That seems fair,” Mike said.  “Do you think you’re going to call it quits?”
The guests squeezed between the urns, leaning over the balustrade on both sides to watch.
We rounded a small out-cropping of rock and the vista opened before us, sloping away to a glassy expanse of water.  It had to be fairer in its spring garb, with the tarn tinted blue by a clear, mid-day sky, than the view Corvus would have seen in the twilight of late winter, and yet the scene emanated an austerity that I could not ignore.  I recognised the stand of blasted trees that marked where the house had been swallowed whole and the small bridge over which Corvus had fled.  The sedge along the shore had a haze of white bloom on it.
A yell rose up from the corner.  John spared a glance in that direction.  There was a crowd gathering near the kerb.  A flame shot up and the crowd fell back.
Blood trickled down my arm.  A red tongue darted over my skin, removing every drop, then the creature wielding it stretched out and bit behind the head of Sherlock’s serpent.  Its tail twitched as it was dragged from Sherlock’s neck and dropped to the floor.
"The moon was setting when I came back from the park," I said.   We were passing below the zoo as I spoke.  Not a glimmer of light showed from our vantage and other than the hoot of an owl, no other animal called.  I peered into the darkness.  "I would have thought the towpath would have had some lights to mark the way."
“No,” she repeated in a quieter tone, already at John’s side.  “Don’t go out.  He might attack if he sees you and hurt himself on the railings.”
It’s a pleasure to write this down now - a record of how I felt in the years after the events at the fall of Reichenbach.  I hadn’t written frankly about such things at the time, and some things I hadn’t written about at all.  The grief, amongst other feelings, had been too fresh.  Emotions are so much more manageable at a remove, I find.
Mrs Hudson was smiling up at me.
“Madame Willow let out another, even longer exhalation.  ‘Isa said that he floats now.  He has no worries or fears to weigh him down.  He is neither happy nor sad.  He craves nothing.  He said he will understand if you do not wish to seek him out when your time comes.  He is at peace.  He craves nothing.  He misses no one.’
“Is artist another thing you left off your CV?” she asked.
“I experimented a little,” she replied, flushing.  “Once I had the formula, it wasn’t hard, but none of my attempts to replicate it on my own ever worked.”
“Are there angels here?” I asked, looking about.
Holmes tapped a finger against his lips.  “We’ll leave it for now and pick up another thread.  What about the sisters?”
I brought us to the door behind the arbour and six steps down brought us to a storeroom whose open door revealed the laboratory beyond.
Seems to be a feature of a lot of folks’ clothes around here.
It was a lovely sight and a lovelier sound.  My shoulders relaxed; I smiled and then I grinned.
I looked at Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson pointed to the floor next to her.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at me as he stepped over my bench.
I realised it had a hinge and a clasp, two semi-circles joined together.  I gestured with my hand, the one with the stones in it.  My other kneaded high up Sherlock’s thigh.
And, after a fair amount of staring at one hand and then the other, we looked at one another again.
“Maybe the box came from one of these houses, then,” I said.  “Someone else could have had a sale last week or just been doing a clear-out.  Sherlock said the box had been underground.  Of course, it could have been somewhere dry for years and then moved to a cellar.”
“You wouldn’t have made it without a reason.”
Christ, I was hoping you were asleep or something.
The barman collected the glass from the empty table, picked up the sticky coin.  He turned to the remaining patrons.  “Last round on the house,” he shouted and snapped his mouth closed.  His feet took him to the bar and his hands poured.
Mr Holmes held out another arrow.
Sherlock lifted his bow from the strings.
“Yes, with a handgun.”
I gave him a pin before he asked.
“Sometimes,” she replied.
“He hopes that I’ll volunteer,” Sherlock replied, looking away.
“Opening my email now.  Just a second.”  John tapped at the keyboard.  “Got it.  Yes.  I’ll forward you a copy.  Let’s hope for the best.”  He nodded and sighed.  “Yeah, you were right.  The surgery wasn’t what I wanted.”
“Bring wood with you,” Mrs Hudson said.  “Too much competition from the young ones up on the hill.”
“I’ve got another lot, you know,” Mike said, “next Thursday, in the morning, at 10.”
“It’s thirteen hours ‘til dawn,” he pointed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
She opened her wings briefly at the sound of her name or perhaps just at the sound of my voice.
“I never came back,” I whispered.  “I should have come back.”
Perhaps I slept.
The darkness behind John’s eyelids lessened.  “Sherlock,” he whispered.
Mike’s eyebrows went up.  “You?  Really?”
The bell of a shop door tinkled.  John glanced towards the sound, saw a woman leaving a small shop with a large package, the shopkeeper behind her, his arm along the door, holding it open for her.  John caught his reflection in the shop window.  He smiled at what was missing from the picture.
"Oh," I mumbled weakly.
I raised my hand to my nose and smiled.  What soreness our antic pursuit had not inflicted, our later exertions had provided.  I inhaled more deeply and the last grogginess of sleep left me.  I could feel his mouth at my neck, the teasing drag of his teeth over my skin.  I lathered my throat and down my chest.  How well we had celebrated our success.
“You have brought great honour to your name,” Lady Holmes added, drawing near. “An auspicious debut to your career.”
I grabbed it before it could blow away and tucked it in my pocket.  I wanted proof.
“Show me your drawings.”
A long-fingered hand closed about my arm and pulled me down.  I saw him bite his lip.  Oh, how I wanted to kiss it.  He kissed the cut in my chest instead.
“Do you recognise where we are?”
DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into every-day life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.
I felt queasy for a moment, put my head down on Sherlock’s knee.
Sherlock remained still, eyes hidden by the journal.  For a moment, I watched it rise and fall with his breathing, then I set to recreating the lines of his sinews on the paper on my lap.
I’d never seen Sherlock do that.  I knew he could.  He told me of battles that had to have been in the air.  Battles without me.
Bert crouched.  Clutching a few twigs in one hand, Kit climbed onto his brother’s shoulders and Midnight leapt onto Kit’s back.  Bert stood and all four set off.
I have trouble looking at them without thinking where else I had wanted the veins to go.  I think that’s why Sherlock hung them in the sitting room.  When he sees me sneaking glances at them, he has a tendency to shed garments and drop them like bread crumbs on his way to the bedroom.  He hung a couple of the life studies in there.  I rarely look at them; I usually have the original to hand.  I think Sherlock likes them.
Sherlock raced down the stairs and started walking west on the towpath, John a few steps behind him.
Sherlock took his flask from his trousers’ pocket and held it out to me.
I rubbed my eyes.
Greg’s eyes brightened and his voice dropped.  “Why thank you, Mr Holmes.”
“You were singing it as you came out of the water and sat by the river bank shaking the water from your feathers."  He reached out a hand and stroked her hair.  "Such a beautiful song."
And she beat her wings faster, the slap of each foot farther apart on the water over which she ran.
I was not sure why I thought he had orchestrated the meal we had consumed, something about the effect the combined flavours were having on me, perhaps.
Sherlock took my arm and guided me away from the end of the path, my eyes still on the sky.
I recognised the ferryman whom I had assumed was Magnus’s man.
“For the best my limp got sorted out earlier.  Who knows where I might have left my cane with all of that going on,” I said and chuckled.  I had reached that stage of fatigue.
I snorted and took his outstretched hand, putting as little of my weight on him as I could manage.  My legs were steadier than I thought they would be as we stepped over the window ledge onto the terrace.
“Charm can be a dangerous thing,” she said, “but you look like you are more level-headed than to be taken in by it.”
My eyes wandered over Sherlock’s back.  If he didn’t straighten up soon, I wouldn’t be responsible for my actions.
Sherlock plucked a white rose from my plate and stood upon the cushioned seat.  “The ferryman’s back,” he said and held a hand out to me.  “Come.  You’ll enjoy watching them leave as much as I always did.”  He took the whole sweet into his mouth, dusted his hand off on his breeches and braced it against the casement.
“You needed to wait until his wife and her lover were shagging.”
This seemed comprehensible to the lad.  He nodded, pulled a cloak from behind the door and slipped past us into the night.
Ahead of us, a deeper hum rose up and then Sherlock began to sing.
“Take him, then,” Mycroft said with a flick of his wrist.
He turned back to her.  “I’ve got a full time job now,” he said.  “Even so, the rent would be a stretch on my own.”
It was an odd thing for me to think because I don’t scare easily, but snippets of the legends had been flitting through my mind since the lunch with Mike had concluded with a tour of Bart’s and a perusal of the unexpected letter he had found on his desk that morning.  We had both laughed at what we could remember of the tales circulating when we were in training, especially the incident we had witnessed in the A&E when a lad had been brought in by his friends after he had shown up at a party jabbering about being chased down Baker Street by a hellhound with glowing red eyes.  His mates had assumed he had got hold of some bad drugs, but one had mumbled something about the legend of the Manor on Baker Street.  Although the stories were old when our grandparents were children, episodes like that one went a long way to keeping the tales alive for another generation.  It would, of course, be preposterous for me to let nonsense like that keep me from pursuing a decent job lead.
The back of the flat was quiet.  Sherlock’s breathing was quiet.  I listened to the soft sound the pencils made as they moved across the paper mimicking his arcs and lines.
It was a heavy sleep that came to me as soon as my head hit my pillow.  How much time had passed when a cold draft left goosepimples along my spine I do not know, but I recognised the long, lean body that slipped into the bed and curved around my sleepy form.
aside and extinguished the lamp.  After staring into the darkness for a long while, I went quietly to my door and opened it.  There was neither light nor sound, but that Holmes was also awake I felt sure.  I tip-toed back to bed, stretched out beneath the covers and waited for the music to begin.
“The gates are locked, we’re far enough from the streets here and our flying friends won’t tell,” Mycroft replied.  A score of nearby moths swooped towards him at the reference, circling his head like a halo.  Mycroft smiled beatifically.
Was he?
“Are you always thinking about mating strategies?”
Sherlock stood tall as though he was gathering himself in and raised the edge of his cloak until it covered his face.  The jewels on it flashed, tiny white sparks burning through the dark cloth.
They sat, hunched together and breathed.
Greg snagged another biscuit.
Sherlock and I danced, one pair among a whirl of others.  It was a relief each time music began that would allow us to dance thus, his very touch sustaining.  I led us through a star pattern, reversing the steps I had trod earlier in the other role in the same dance.  Eyes steadfastly open, my confidence had returned a dance or two after my encounter with the jester.  Following the mirror image of a complex dance was a test of whether it was justified or not.  I brought us through, but the demands of the pattern had been sufficient to preclude conversation.
I stroked the bare arm with which he held me, reached back with my other hand and curled my fingers about his neck.  His skin was cool; the scales of his serpent cooler as they brushed against my knuckles in their circuit about his throat.  Mine became restless, also, twining back and forth around my neck.  I thought they might be anxious about the same person for whom Mycroft searched, and so I joined in his surveillance without knowing for whom, my drowsiness gone.
Mrs Hudson pointed at the parapet atop the thick walls over the gate.  “You would have been up there,” she explained, “with the roof garden wall behind you, so you wouldn’t have seen this.”
A bassoon took up the melody.
Chapter 23:  Starlight
“No,” John said.
Then, I glimpsed Sherlock disappearing behind the door to the spiral stairs up to the gallery.
Holmes inclined his head at my words.  “Very well.  Present the rest of it.”
“John, the cellarage,” Sherlock said, waving at one of the low doors in the front of the stage.
“Give the musicians a chance to settle.”
“You are too hot,” he murmured and slipped further down my body, smooth tongue slipping past nipple and navel and closing about my cock.  His mouth was no longer as cold as it had been.
“That’s the last of the ‘interesting’ ones,” he replied, opening the door and dropping the files on the passenger seat.  “He’s bemoaning the lethargy of the criminal classes up there.”
Two attendants emerged from the dimness behind Lestrade.  One fastened Culvert’s hands behind his back, the other bound Culvert’s legs at the ankles.  Lestrade tied a velvet band around Culvert’s mouth, and, drawing a silver dagger, much like my own, from its sheath, cut the bells from the jester’s hat.  One of the attendants collected the bells from the floor.  When he stood, Lestrade nodded and the two shouldered Culvert like a rolled carpet and turned towards the terrace doors.
I could almost see it there in letters that flickered like the flames.
“A feeling,” Holmes amended.
His arm came up and with one long motion he drew the bow over the strings.  The note was low and melancholy.
“Ah, they’ve finally given up the ghost,” Mrs Hudson said, pulling the radio towards her and sliding the back panel off to reveal the batteries.  “I should have re-charged them yesterday.”
The stag in front lifted up his head and roared.  Before the sound had faded, a pale blur streaked from the roof and, with outstretched talons, Siròc landed on the beast’s topmost antler.
I edged closer, my hand sliding onto his thigh.
Quiet.
“Shouldn’t Greg be arresting him or something?”  I thought I had glimpsed Lestrade in a black velvet half-mask earlier in the evening.
“Legs have gone to sleep, too,” I remarked, smoothing out my sorely rumpled cloth and brushing away various leaves pressed into my skin.
Sherlock filled my wineglass from a tall green bottle with a hand-written label in an alphabet with which I was unfamiliar.  He set the glass down near me.  “He’s become efficient over the years.  More salmon?”
Several expressions warred for supremacy on Sherlock’s face.  “Its atomic structure is perfect, every proton, neutron and electron orbiting in its proper place unless acted upon by some very powerful external force that very few can wield.”  He rolled his shoulders back.  “Very, very few.”
“Who?” Mike replied.
The king turned it in the light and it shimmered.  “It is a pleasing bauble,” he proclaimed and tucked it in the band of his velvet cap.  “Unless you would like it, my dear,” he said to his Queen.
But it was the tone of his first reply that stayed with me as I gazed and gazed and felt my vantage was very small despite my being at the top of a rather tall tower.
Out of the trees, something fluttered towards Sherlock, a crow, a raven...
In unison, our heads turned to look up.  Conversation faded away.
Mrs Hudson patted my leg.  “That’s what friends are for, my dear.”
Backwards he bent me, like a willow wand, his arms about my waist, his chest against mine, his tongue cool and deep in my mouth.
“Watch,” Sherlock whispered.
May have done.
Sherlock changed, into what he was not certain, he could not feel its shape.  He followed his desire to know every inch of John, starting with more of that soft mouth.  He flooded forward and all around him John moaned.
“Things that cannot be,” I replied.
It does, but I want to call it a pond.
“I believe that was his shadow we saw on the grass,” Sherlock said.
The perytons stamped and reared, but through the uproar, I thought I heard her voice saying, “Good for all of us.”
Well, nothing, but rearing young is usually a time-consuming process.
He kept hold of the papers and reached for something else on the table.  A wrapper crinkled.
“It is.”
“So, why didn’t you?”
Returning my eyes to my cards, I explained, “My knaves both looked like you, then the knave of hearts morphed into me.  Gun-in-hand, he has executed a similar manoeuvre, using the ace of diamonds as a stepping stone to reach a rather haughty and steely-eyed knave of diamonds."  My eyes flickered back to Sherlock's face.  That very steel grey gaze was upon me.  I looked again at the cards.  "He is less aloof now, that knave.  He's conjured a violin and begun to serenade me.  I'm seated at his feet, looking up with that look I know I have when you play.”  I glanced at Sherlock again.  Like his simulacrum, his look has softened.
“Good,” I said decisively, but then added, “there were cauldrons for boiling oil up on the parapet."
Sherlock continued sleeping the sleep of angels amidst the bunched duvets and far flung pillows.  I hooked my leg more firmly across his chest, felt it rise and fall with the sated rhythm of his breathing and drifted, once more, away.
“It sublimated on the way here,” he replied, pulling up his legs.
“I wasn’t going to inject infected blood into your veins,” I said, glaring at him.
There had been talk of my being stationed there after my injury, but in the end a surgeon with an intermittent tremor had not been worth a staff position.
He took it, shook it slightly and continued gazing at me.  I wondered if the drink had been to share and I had guzzled it all down.  I touched my lip.
“Well, all right.”  She paused on the stairs and let me slide a basket full of clanking objects off her arm.  “I was hoping to catch you this afternoon to see which of those you want to use,” she said, gesturing at the basket with a handful of metal rods.
“Mrs Turner found it and showed it to me and then, of course, I told Gabriel and Anji,” Mrs Hudson replied.  “They both look for your updates now.  I had wondered why you wanted to know Anji’s last name.”
When the last of the lather was swirling down the drain, I suggested dinner.  I’d had another idea as well, but I didn’t mention it until all that remained of the Chinese food I’d ordered was half an egg roll and some sweet sauce.  That he had acquiesced to having food when a mystery was afoot was either a courtesy to me or, more likely, a sign that he didn't have another avenue of approach yet.
I winced.  “He won’t make it to the river.”
I glanced at Holmes.  He was studying me intently.
Beneath the music, voices murmured, but I could not see who possessed them.  They swirled between us in a blur of lustrous fabrics, but when the steps brought you and I face to face and our hands touched, I neither heard nor saw even that much of them.  I saw you, tall and regal as the night sky, your black garments studded with constellations of crystal, slashed to reveal cloth as radiant as the moon, and I danced for you.
His lips parted as he watched me.  Those fair, fair lips parting as they did for a kiss.
John drew a lightning bolt in his notes and waited for her to go on.
Mike beamed.  “That was quite the coincidence that day, wasn’t it?” he said and finished his soup.  “So what’s next on the menu?”
There was the swan, unfolding his wings and fluttering up to the post in the water by Ms Swann’s balcony.  And there was the swan standing with one foot on the top of the post, one half-open wing appearing to touch the side of the building, the other touching the railing of the balcony. Then his head and neck seemed to grow wider and the wing touching the railing appeared to have a hand amidst the feathers.
No one screamed.  No one moaned.
Mrs Hudson was back in the box.  “This one’s for you,” she said to Kit, handing him a larger flask that looked to be made of brushed steel.  “Mulled cider, my lad, until you’re a lot older.”
John watched her reactions.  He and Sherlock had chosen the order of the photographs downloaded from his camera over the dinner that Angelo had delivered within minutes of their arriving home.  They had debated the sequence of several.  The order of the first three had been John’s idea.  After that, Sherlock had built his case.
I wondered where Sherlock had gone.  I let my eyes drift shut.  Maybe Mrs Hudson had lured him into her kitchen to feed him.  Each breath I drew was shallower than the last.  I was too tired to eat, not that anyone had asked.
The paper rustled as he turned it.  “Lloyd George at the Paris Peace Conference,” Sherlock read out, the curiosity plain in his voice.  “There’s a photo.”
“I don't need more apologies, one promise will do.”
“No one who wasn’t welcome ever made it through Door or past River.”  He gestured with his head, left and right.  “This was our first refuge.  The core of the Manor.  Our long barrow.” He tilted his head back the way I had come.  “And that door’s made from the tree who grew above it and whose roots blocked the way in to those who would intrude.”
I rubbed my face on the cushions.  I hoped Wiggins hadn’t brought it in while I was naked on the floor with my arse in the air.
“Oh, John, we have so much to do once we have the manor back to ourselves.”  One long leg arced over my head.
Sherlock opened the doors and switched on the lamps either side of the sofa.  There was litter all around, but the intersecting beams of the lamps created a spotlight on the drawings that drew the eye away from everything else in the room.  Blood seemed to pulse from the heart through the veins that climbed towards the face.
John loosed his grip, slipped his hand between Sherlock’s thighs and cradled his testicles.
“And from that you could know how the coffin-maker felt when his mistress moaned as he made love to her?” John asked.  He raised his hand and touched Sherlock’s cheek.  “Or are you denying that you dreamt of me?”
They fell at our feet.
“What…”
“Excuse you,” he called after the man and spun around, elbows out, the second word still on his lips.
I hadn’t heard the story about that one.
"It's not even a kilometre to Bart's," Sherlock said.
“That certainly, but I can think of at least one other,” Sherlock amended as he took his hand away and retrieved the plate of toast and set it on John’s chest.
Sherlock slipped his arm through John’s and tugged him away from the railing.  “Something is not as it seems.  We need to find proof, one way or another.”
His thumb was digging into the base of my skull, his fingers fanning out through my hair.  His strength was returning.  Whether it was that evidence or the pressure around my ears and over the crown of my head, I was not sure, but one of them was distracting me from the pain.
Mrs Hudson smiled and held out her hand to me.
John looked back at the man.  Somewhere over their heads, a clock chimed.  Another joined in, slightly out of sync, and then a third.  “Just a quick look, I don’t have much time,” he said and handed over the plant.
I tapped the drawing of a heart gripped by a skeletal hand with the tip of my biro.  “It should have been a brain between the fingers.”  I glanced around.  Nearly everyone had left the room.
I stretched in my chair and patted my belly.  “Thank you.  It was far more than that.”
“I guess we’ll have to wait until Sherlock gets back to find out.”
“Nearly three hours ago,” he said, his head resting against the side of the lab table.
I shivered.
“You were injured that night,” I replied, remembering the mighty trees I saw from the roof and Sherlock so weak he could barely stand.
Baskerville had brought what was left of the branch back several times when the lioness stretched out on the ground.  Baskerville dropped the stick by her head and nudged her shoulder with his nose.
“Moira…Meredith…”
John looked about and saw a grey-haired woman holding a lead looped around her hand heading through the tall grass in their direction.  “You’re making up that name.”
“But his sister wrote to say their mother was ill and wished him to come home.  He left and I heard little from him after that.  I just kept travelling, and was only stopping in England long enough to change direction when his summons reached me.”  He sighed and looked around towards us.  “ I am certainly changing direction now.”
Rapid steps scurried away from us.
“Mrs Turner wouldn’t have taken no for an answer.”
“That’s the second time you’ve mentioned that.  Is the year thing really so important?”
“Clothing’s flammable,” he said.
“Not defeat them?”
His response was to charge after the creature and leap upon its back.
“Yeah,” Greg confirmed, scowling.  “Born in Haddington, Scottish mother, German father, dual national.”
I stood at the bottom of the stairs, not sure which way to go.  I sagged against the newel post.
While Sherlock studied the room in the mirrors, I filled a cup with the mead that was flowing from one of the small urns balanced on the shoulders of several naked bacchantes that decorated the silver fountain nearest to me on the table.
“It’s harder to search on the ground,” he said and looked down at his legs.  “But easier with these.  They are good for walking.”  He glanced at her.  “And not so bad for swimming.”
Of yellow tide-foam;
I stroked the undamaged bark.  “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
“Thank you, Your Royal Highness,” Puck said with sincerity.
“Yes, OK.  So, iron’s a possibility.”
I did know that, of course.  I smoothed the fabric on the arm of my chair and cleared my throat.  “Yes, well.  Madame Willow had been highly recommended to Kate Whitney by her sister, and a neighbour, as a very respectable and talented spiritualist, who had known things that only they could know about their departed husbands and so Mrs Whitney wished to visit this Madame Willow to set her mind at ease by communicating with Isa.”
"Don't worry.  You are well-scented.  She would have known you belonged...here," Sherlock said, holding his hand out to test the temperature of the water.
I did.
Corvus shook his head.  “Nothing,” he sighed.  “He just repeated his reply about standard phrasing that the lawyer had insisted be included to provide for any future offspring or future appointments as a guardian.”
"Yes," Sherlock replied.  He had remained standing and was plying the spear hook with balletic grace on one side of the boat and then the other.
Sherlock sat up.  Was that when John had covered him with pollen?  Sherlock could not remember.  Could John turn into a flower?  A bed of flowers?  A meadow’s worth of flowers, growing from the seemingly dead wood that covered the floors?
“Even though what I was confiding made me sound like a madman?” Sherlock asked.
Fucker.
Right.  Following in the dark, then.
His stare unsettled people.  It was unsettling Ms Swann.
“Home,” Sherlock replied. “Let’s see if the audio pick-up is as good as the light sensitivity.”
The garments fell away, the flesh peeled back, revealing the dark heart boiling in its cage of white bone.  The flames rose higher, but they gave no heat, only the smell of burnt cloth.
On the first try, my fingers slipped off the metal strip along the top of the lid.
I followed his line of sight and saw the patch of tiny daisies growing in the middle of it.  I glanced sideways at Sherlock.
John swore and limped forwards, arms extended.  They met only open air.
Sherlock handed John what looked like a cigarette case.
He held my gaze as he bit into the confection.
He turned his head slightly to keep me in view.
“Are they waiting for our last dance?”
I shook my head.  “It’s you, playing your violin with your eyes closed, a sumptuous robe the colour of your blue dressing gown falling off your shoulder, down to your elbow, on your bow arm.”
The voices of several swimmers carried across the water as they drew nearer the lido.
I heard a melody, sibilant and soft.
The woman and the horse were gone.  The old woman was gone.  I could only spot the fellow who had started climbing the tree.  He was sat in the fork of one of its lower branches.
I held my hand out to Mycroft.  It did not disappoint me and remained as steady as a rock.
“You are correct, but Henri used the leitmotif in a symphony as well.  That, however, will not be part of the programme.  They are not played together because of the similarities, but I predict that in the future they will be studied together for that precise reason.  It is fascinating what he did with such a simple melody.”
Sherlock cleared his throat.
He sat up straighter.  “That was only the last batch.  You’ve been asleep for a while.”
John’s eyes were not adjusting to the darkness.  He closed them and listened.  There was running water ahead, like a bath overflowing...or a brook.  A faint draft bore the scent of mouldering leaves and moss.  John crouched, removed his shoes and socks, stood them in the dim triangle of wood and wool.  He eased forward, a slippery surface of wet leaves cushioning his footfall.  He paused, extended an arm in front, the other to the side and finding no obstacle, took another pace, and another.  There was a splash ahead, as of a dropped cake of soap, or of a frog or small fish jumping.  He proceeded towards it, feeling ahead with his toes, counting his steps.  The ground sloped.  He no longer thought of it as a floor.
“What did you make of it, Watson?”
They turned onto Baker Street.  Over the road, police tape no longer blocked off part of the footpath.  John paused at the crosswalk and peered down towards the station.  “The trains’ll stop running soon.”
“Not at court anyway,” Oberon said.
John took a sip of water and put the glass down.  He pulled off a piece of bread, drew it back and forth through the golden oil in the little dish.
I collapsed back against the cushions with a shiver.  “Well, I…”
“Bend forwards a little,” Sherlock directed.
I sagged in those arms.  I knew that tongue.  I touched it with mine.
I pressed my palm to my lips and sucked on the scratched skin.
Finally, Sherlock huffed.  “John,” he said, very quietly.  “I have the dubious honour of presenting to you my
A whistle sounded and the train began to slow.
The bell rang.  Once.
The scarlet mist glowed at the edges of my vision.  I felt my nostrils flare as I breathed in, heard the faint whistle as I breathed out through parted lips.
Sherlock appeared to consider.  “There’s a danger in it,” he said, scanning me from my head, past my open hands and downwards.  He paused at my naval.  I looked down as well and almost laughed.
“Where did you learn what you did along the outer edge there?” he asked.
Sherlock sat up with a grimace and began massaging his hands and his arms.
“A pity that shed feathers are not suitable for testing,” Sherlock said, handing the lab report to John.  “It was game of them to try.”
“Different minerals, but related name,” Sherlock said.  “And they were both believed to wax and wane with the moon.”
He was licking his lips, his eyes narrowed.
"No, but the time has changed repeatedly since you rowed off.  What were you doing out there?" Lestrade asked.
It was bright in the downstairs room, even with the curtains drawn.  Mid-afternoon.  Quietly, John propped himself up on one elbow and watched Sherlock’s back rise and fall in the rhythm of deep sleep, his face half obscured by his pillow.
“Look at the blood,” Sherlock replied, his narrowed eyes focussing away from the body and that oddly-composed face.
“The house has evolved over the centuries,” Mr Holmes said.
He pulled himself further along my body and peered down at me.  The candlelight was erratic, but I thought the skin beneath his eyes looked less bruised.
“Yes.  The probate of Mrs Usher’s will was concluded shortly before Roderick…”  Corvus took a deep breath.  “It did not please Roderick that Dr Adamantine would be at Usher regardless of anyone’s health.  His mother had granted the doctor a life estate in a hunting lodge on their land, and as executor it was Roderick’s duty to carry out her wishes, and he did.  Carry them out.  But it troubled him.”
Mine curled over my empty palm.
Ms Swann followed them to the door.  “You will take my case?”
I checked on Baskerville.  Siròc was walking along the lioness’s back, half opening and closing her wings.  Perhaps it was a signal of hers.  Sherlock had never answered my question about how he communicated with her and I had forgotten to ask again.
I twisted about to look up at him.  “Really?”
I’m trying not to.
“Very good.”  He looked up at Sherlock.  “You’ve done very well,” he repeated, swinging the hand holding his mask to the side and waving it up and down as though marking the metre of what he said.
Mycroft dismissed Puck with an upward swept of his fingers.
“I thought we were in a hurry?”
Far in the distance, a light glowed, yellow and orange and white at its centre.  By it, I could see the fireplaces on either side of the room, both their hearths cold and dark.  The bench by the door was as I remembered seeing it last, but the workbench along the wall facing the door was gone.  The wall out of which it had been carved was gone.  The flint-paved floor sloped down to that distant firelight.
“I feel remarkably well,” Sherlock replied, “although my garments are much the worse for wear.”  He glanced at me.  “Do you feel well, Doctor Watson?”
“And apples,” I added, wresting my gaze away.
“Not exactly.  Many people here have had dealings with him one way or another.  Unpleasant dealings,” Sherlock explained.
“Shall I remove them for you?” he asked and I nodded.
He flitted across the moonbeams streaming through the windows.  When I finally set myself in motion, he had stopped in the last pool of silvery light and was regarding me.  There were no flames to colour him there; he was all pallor and darkness.
The candlewick smoked and sparked.  The flame bloomed.  It was doubled in the mirrors, glinted off the metal and the glass.
In their own chorus of promises and farewells, the guests prepared to depart.  Attendants glided among them bearing armfuls of cloaks and headdresses cast aside when dancing and feasting had warmed the blood. In the calmer and cooler air of leave-taking, they were donned again.  As the guests shimmered past, they smiled benignly at Sherlock and me and I smiled vaguely back, squinting at the indistinct edges of them.  Sherlock inclined his head graciously and I was grateful that they didn’t appear to expect more of us than that.
“Let me try to relieve the tedium,” John murmured.  “Come here.”  He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
There was a lull in our conversation after this.  I thought Sherlock might make some enquiries on the point, but he did not.  I took it as a cue for me to speak whilst his attention was elsewhere.
He was turning faster now, jacket flaring, a hand shielding his eyes as he gazed up at the sky.  With a cry and a flurry of feathers, Siròc landed on his shoulder, the sunlight gleaming on her wings, and then it seemed as though Sherlock opened his.
It is a strong hand.  I have seen metal bent.   How easy it would be for it to close too tightly around a heart.  Also, messy.
“I don’t know for certain,” I said, gesturing at the open manuscript on the table.  “The recipe isn’t set out as a list, it’s all narrative and I haven’t finished reading through it yet.  At least it’s all at the end of the chapter and I'm approaching the last of it.”
“He doesn’t?” I enquired, unfolding my serviette and surveying what she had set out.  “It looks as beautiful as it smells.”
I plucked ineffectually at the snarled ribbons.  I may have whined.
.  Glistening skirts swept past me and out the doors.
“Water supply,” Sherlock said.
And, I sang to him.
My turn.
“Your mother’s parents.”
In my bed, I drew the blankets up to my ears.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied.
“Bring Lestrade out…” Sherlock began.  “No, never mind, I’ll go to him.  Can you show Doctor Watson his rooms, we haven’t made it up there.”  He waved a hand at one of the walls of the courtyard.  "And leave this in the study."  He handed her his violin case.
“Let me see!”  Sherlock held out his hand.
Sherlock moved closer, flowing with the music, glowing with the moon.
Sherlock blinked.
The area around the bed pulsed a soft blue-green, John most brightly, a constellation of turquoise bites.  Sherlock flattened a palm against John’s chest.  The skin was warm, heart beating below it, each bite a pinprick of heat on its surface.  He wanted to draw out more of the sweetness, taste it again, on his lips this time.
I glanced at Sherlock.  His gaze was fixed on the centre doors with an intensity I never saw when anything good was about to happen.
“You’re getting closer,” he said and looked to say more.
The crushed stone of its surface glimmered in the moonlight, swooping past the entrance to the Manor directly below us, and disappearing into the woods again leading north.
I sat down.  “So, you think he could offer a good home to the jar of marbles out in the hall.”
But she was faint with sorrow.
“You are convinced that the medium you consulted was not a fraud.”
I looked down to find Kit at my elbow, holding a plate piled even higher than mine had been, but with different delicacies and mounds of winter berries.
“Too soon.  She was startled enough that we’d seen the swan.”
I had seen it before.  The bare curves of its many figurines were being polished when Mrs Hudson had given me my first tour of the kitchens and cellars.  It had reminded me of the shapes I sometimes glimpsed ranged round a tree in the centre of the fountain in the courtyard below my bedroom balcony.  There was more variety of position in the wine fountain, however.  Each wine bearer had at least two lovers expressing their ardour.  I tilted my head to get a clearer view of exactly how three of the figures were intertwined.  The sculptor had clearly had supple models.
“You do give me joy,” I agreed, "but it’s usually other appetites that that joy inspires."
I opened my eyes.
There had been, no doubt, more to the play, but the actors’ voices seemed far away and when I looked upon the stage, I did not see them.  The lights shone on a grassy mountainside, glistening with the spray from falling water.  Only the music reached me now and again when a run of notes reminded me of what Holmes played alone in our sitting room.
Sherlock opened the door onto a corridor of grey, rough-hewn stone lit by iron sconces that had been fitted with frosted glass and electrified.  “I took a jug of milk with me from the canteen for the ride home and let him lick it off my fingers, wrapped up in my scarf on my lap.”
“You have already decided to take his case on?” I exclaimed, wondering silently whether the mention of opium use had struck a chord of sympathy in Holmes.
John’s muscles relaxed fractionally.
“Oh?”
The music had a sedate air after dinner; the conversations were quieter.  The guests traced the figures of their dances with a stately grace, as did we.  In the lulls between songs, I did not always hear the jester’s laugh or the jangle of his bells.
I bit into the berries, loosed their sweet, sticky juice onto my tongue.  I swallowed, licked my lips and ran my tongue over my teeth.  My eyes closed.
A soft chuckle seemed to surround us.
Sherlock smiled, twisted off the flower-shaped cap and sniffed.
Like a compass needle, I had stopped rotating facing the elevator.  I had no patience for it and had run down the spiral stairs, circling its shaft.
I was managing to call forth simple snatches of melody and was rather pleased with myself for doing so, although I had to refrain from smiling about it because it changed the sound of the notes.  So, all was quite idyllic until my stomach grumbled most crudely just as I had paused my piping to take a deep breath.  I quickly blew a few notes upon the pipes as though to cover up my lapse, but it was too late.
“So I don’t need to train for anything?  Sharpen any blades?”
“John might be persuaded to do your portrait, Lestrade,” Sherlock said.
He released my hand and I believe he smiled back.
Sherlock glided along the wall to the corner where the curved balustrade joined the side of the building and paused.  I stopped just behind him and surveyed the terrace.  We were in the shade thrown by the foliage of the nearest urn standing adjacent to the balustrade.  To the east, massive trees hid the view along the near bank.  Only the sound of the water hinted that the river continued to wend its way between them.  Gnarled canes of climbing rose with thorns thicker than my fingers covered the stone wall of the house.  Shoots red with young leaves and green buds arched away from it over the grassy verge between the wall and the canopy of the trees.  I took care not to lean back against the stone.
“I’m not allergic to any foods I know of,” I said.
“That must annoy the neighbours,” John remarked.
Sherlock turned to me and smiled.  “Did you close the panel when you came in?” he asked.
I watched him play, his fingers bright, then dark, as the shadow of the bow swept over them.
“They have been trading barbs in academic journals for years over protocols for determining provenance," Sherlock explained.  "Just as well we were able to avoid a medical emergency,” he added.
“No, I imagine there wouldn’t be.  Madeleine is very organised.  I’m sure she had everything that could be arranged in advance all sorted out before she left.  I hope research for the new game is worth uprooting herself like this.”
My hand darted out.  “Wait,” I said, fingers closing around the blade.  “Let me.”
“Yes.”
“You should finish eating,” he added over his shoulder.  “We have to practice more.”
John held on more tightly.  Bands of muscle flexed and contracted under him.
Carefully, I turned my head and looked towards the other side of the dam.  The water continued for as far as I could see.  Equally carefully, I turned my head back.
“Not at all,” Sherlock answered.
“Here,” Sherlock said.
"Why's that?" I mumbled, my memory starting to return.  There had been another bloke, old fellow, with us.
She checked my plate.  “Look how well you’ve done.  It is a pleasure feeding someone who has a good appetite,” she said.  “I’ll just bring these things down and get our dessert.  It’s something I learned in America.  I hope you like it.”
I wouldn’t.
Sherlock hadn’t moved.
“Mind you, most don’t want to.  That’s the key thing that gets them here in the first place, wanting to be somewhere other than where they are.”  She looked over at me.  “Anywhere else, and wanting it with a passion.”
“We have read all that you sent us,” I replied.
John turned his face, brushed Sherlock’s hair from his forehead.  With a slight upwards push, Sherlock’s lips reached John’s mouth.  It opened sweetly.
"Where's..." I began to ask and stopped when I spotted Sherlock down in the boat, its benches lit by the lantern Greg was dangling over the side of the dock.
Sherlock was standing on the sofa when I opened the door.  Bits of paper were floating to the floor around him.  There was a snarl of red string in his hair, a couple of sticky notes clinging to his dressing gown.  He looked over his shoulder at me.
“No, you did not,” Mrs Hudson replied.
Sherlock hummed an acknowledgement, but did not turn his head.
“Go on,” he urged.
I sounded out the Latin:
The cool weight of Lady Holmes’ hand disappeared from my shoulder.  Its ache vanished with it.  “Best not to lose the current.”
That’s a thing?
“The clouds grew darker.  There was a distant rumble, like hooves, like drums.  I glanced from side to side.  I could discern nothing.  Wherever the shore was, it seemed far away.  I closed my eyes, stretched my fingers out and continued to float.  The water rippled gently, cool, soothing.”  Ms Swann paused.
I neither confirmed nor denied, my expression studiously neutral.
My blood seemed to be pulsing with it.
And then I stood before him and finished undoing the shirt’s buttons, tugging the soft cloth from the confines of his trousers waistband and opening the buttons on the tails.  I took a steadying breath and spread the halves of the shirt apart.  I saw not a scratch.  I shifted to allow the coloured light to fall directly on his skin; it was not ideal for a medical exam, but the wounds I had glimpsed would not have required strong light to observe.
Somewhere in the dark, hyacinths bloomed.  I took a deep breath.  I had not seen or smelled them in the day, but the rooftop was a maze around the courtyards and skylights.  There were few straight lines of sight and doubtless many nooks that we had not needed to cross to reach the conservatories.
I dragged myself back to bed and a moment later Sherlock set the candle on the night table and the book box on the bed.  He settled cross-legged next to me and pulled something from the box.
“John…Doctor Watson, are you all right?”
“Do you?” Sherlock asked from across the room.  He was holding a large, hard-bound book with the photograph of a swan on the cover.
The striking of a tambour drew my attention away.  The drummer sat on a log at the edge of the clearing, striking his instrument alternately with the heel of his palm and the tips of his fingers.  People were sitting, here and there, on other logs or stretched out on the grass.  Some rose to dance as the drummer played.
“Just open your legs a little wider.”
I nodded, drawing my hand slowly away from the plant.  It liked being admired.
“And they’re cherry branches, right?”  John asked, carving another slice from the leg of lamb on the platter in the middle of the table and adding it to the gravy on his plate.
“Higher,” he said, holding out his hand over the pot.
The wings of the cap fluttered, moving it closer to Sherlock’s other ear.
Sherlock stood in the doorway.  “Get your harp,” he said, “I’m going to show you something else music can do.”  He strode towards the far side of the room without another glance at me.
“Well, I had been hoping to make it a bit of a surprise for you,” Holmes said from behind the paper.
“Another company bought the rights to the name, but changed the formula,” he said.  “It made her so cross when she realised what had happened.  She’d been wearing it since she was a girl.  I remember she always smelled the same.  It’s a pleasing fragrance.”
“I observed.  While we spoke and toured, you forgot about your leg injury, despite the walking and stair climbing we have been doing.  If you can forget it when your attention is elsewhere, it’s not a physical injury.”
sailing the day after tomorrow due to the former Minister of State for Transport’s presence, but if we dig deeper we may find more likely candidates.”  He picked up speed as he rattled off the details, finally looking up from the screen, eyes agleam with the joy of a seemingly worthy case.
I looked at the harp.  The dark wood of the sound box was inlaid with stylised knots in lighter wood, the pillar carved with more complicated snarls, a few of which ended in open-mouthed snakes.  The designs were highlighted with gilt, except for the snakes’ mouths and tongues, which were enamelled in red.
Why the obsession with age lately?
The moon lit a ring of froth a couple metres from the skiff.
I glared at my cards, my thumb pressing down hard against the one in the middle, the ace of diamonds.  A perfectly ordinary ace of diamonds it had been when I first looked at my hand.  And, to either side of it had been ordinary knaves, hearts to the left, diamonds to the right.  They had been flanked by the ace of hearts on the left and the king of clubs on the right.  Two pairs, aces and knaves.  A decent hand that I would have been happy to see in an ordinary poker game, but then the images had shifted.  The diamonds had grown pale and begun to sparkle.  The hearts had pulsed softly around their knave, who raised a violin to his shoulder.  In its frame, the empty eyes of the knave of diamonds gained a gleam of blue and the angular lines of his garish garments softened and darkened to fall in heavy folds of indigo.  His head turned and he looked me up and down, appraisingly.  On the far left, the silver of the ace of spades shimmered on a snowy field.  Lastly, on the right edge, the king of clubs grew verdant.  His crown darkened to a wreath of clover, his robes took on a leafy hue, and the face beneath the wreath was clean-shaven and raven-haired.  In one hand, he held a retort, in the other, a pipette.  A royal apothecary?  An alchemist?  A poisoner?
Sherlock held up his hand and a bird about the size of a pigeon with feathers of dappled brown and blue landed on his arm.
“You saw that?” I asked.
“Oh, I don’t think you do,” Sherlock replied, pulling his leg back over the railing, and straightening his jacket.  “But I do wish we’d given Ms Swann a microphone.”
