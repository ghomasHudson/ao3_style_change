"Thank you, I appreciate them. All of them. The tulips especially." Cas was watching Dean. Dean did not
"Alright Cas, go get some rest. Here, have some food," he threw the paper bag to Cas, "I'll take over."
Dean's breath got stuck in his throat and suddenly he felt like he couldn't breathe. His vision started to blur, and his heart started to speed up. He remembered the whole conversation now. It had started with this itch he couldn’t scratch, the spell slowly breaking lose inside him.
Sam was absolutely thrilled to see his brother and Castiel, but even more so excited to see Jody and the girls again. It had been too long until they were all reunited together, under the same roof. Too damn long. Donna accompanied Sam's team to their new "dorms" where they would be sleeping, with David flashing a quick smug look at Dean as he strolled by. Inias came to the sidelines to talk to Castiel.
Sam knew his brother inside out, and he had known about Dean's maddening and intense feelings for the angel for a while now. It was impossible to miss, what with the constant staring and dying for each other type of shit. Sam had always known. But seeing his brother at that moment, finally, admitting it was unexpected. Dean looked scared. Not because he was able to be open, but scared to lose Cas. Again.
"No, it's not Cas. Nothing about this is okay," Dean turned to David, "What's your friggin' problem, huh? I tried so friggin' hard to like you, to get along with you!" Cas was 100% sure if the kids weren't around, Dean would be swearing like a sailor.
"Dude, I have no idea what we're dealing with!" Dean hissed, reversing his impala out of the parking lot and back onto the road.
It was Cas's turn to sigh heavily, slouching his shoulders, "Dean can be difficult sometimes. But yes, we worked things out more or less."
Cas watched Dean hurriedly wipe the tears away. The hunter avoided looking at Cas's eyes because he was scared he would fall apart there and then.
Sam observed Dean but before he could say anything, Dean spoke, "I broke him. I said he was the reason everything went wrong in our lives, that he was poison. Shit, Sam, I said I could never love him, that I didn't WANT to love him. Why did I say that? Why would I EVER say that? It's Cas. I would never say that."
"Cas, I'm tired. Please just let this go," Dean begged. He turned around to find the angel only inches away from him. Cas put his hand on Dean's shoulder firmly but gently, and went, "okay, Dean. But when you're ready to talk, I'm here." He knew Dean. The man had mastered the art of pushing away his feelings into the depths of his mind, and Cas knew he would have to be extremely patient if he wanted Dean to be more open with him. They were never eloquent at communication but lately, Cas noticed Dean was more straightforward.
“No, Cas, I’m starting to remember. I don’t remember what I said, but I remember what I did. How I punched you until you were bloody and broken. I was so…
Cas sighed, "I don't want you passing out tomorrow. Rest for like 4 hours, if anything happens I will wake you up, otherwise, I'll watch over you."
They would go on hunts as much as they could: a vampire here, a ghost there and a werewolf in between. Sam and Eileen wanted to have a movie on Fridays after the long week was over. Dean was hesitant towards the idea at first, but after seeing how excited his little brother, Cas and Eileen were, he agreed to join and give it a shot. They decided to pick movies in rotation so Sam was the first and picked a movie he and Dean enjoyed since they were kids. The first night was pleasant but a little awkward, or at least that's what Dean felt like. Sam and Eileen cuddled up together under a velvet soft blanket, placing gentle loving kisses between scenes. Sam laid down across the couch with Eileen's small figure was pressed up against him, as they watched the movie. Dean and Cas stayed on the other couch, a few inches apart. The distance was agonising and almost unbearable. Cas was too transfixed by the movie but Dean's eyes were on the angel, admiring the way Cas squinted his eyes when he didn't understand what was going on, or how he fiddled with his thumbs when he got bored. Sam caught Dean staring at Cas a few times, and eyed him as if to say "make your move, dumbass" but Dean never did.
"Well, look what we have here," Sam said, pretending to observe the paper. The step-mom frowned and her daughters complained about how there was no way Cas could have been at the ball.
Lucifer glanced around searching, "where's your kid?" Dean felt his heart drop for a second as he called out for Jack.
"I'm sorry, WHAT?" Dean yelled, bouncing up from his seat. Cas held him back with one hand. David smirked a little, watching them like a prey about to devour his next meal.
"Sam, take Dean to base. Give him one of the free rooms, get Kristy to cook him a good meal, and give him some of my extra clothes. I think they'll fit him better than your
Dean put his hands up defensively, "Woah, hey, not our fault. Not this time anyway. Sammy and I were working case here and we couldn't figure it out. And then these guys showed up out of nowhere!"
John took another bite out of his chicken before saying, "So, what I'm getting from this, is that you and Dean are almost like Jack's parents?"
"You let my mother die! Rowena wouldn't have had to die if you just stuck to the fucking plan! And then you leave for god knows how long and you don’t even text Sam back, who was worrying about you for days! You just pop in and out whenever the fuck you want?" Dean yelled back, raising his voice.
Cas breathed, backing away slowly, "I want you to understand, I am still your friend. I just don't want to lose you again. Every time we get… close, the universe tries to pull us apart. And it almost did. That day, when the world fell apart. I almost lost you then. That can't happen again, Dean. Claire lost Kaia, I could have lost you."
Cas intertwined their fingers together, always surprised by how well their hands fit together, "Sleep, Dean." Dean grumbled something like "kiss me" or at least that's what Cas heard because he bent a little to kiss Dean's lips softly. Dean smiled and closed his eyes, resting his heavy head on Cas. Cas watched and waited as Dean drifted off to another deep sleep for the second time that day. He brought up the covers over the man, making sure Dean was warm but not too warm. Dean sighed a little in his sleep as he swung his arms around Cas's waist and snuggled closer. Maybe their lives were a bit magical indeed.
"Listen, Cas, we don't have all night and we're both drained. If there's something you need to tell me, go right ahead," he was finished.
"This ain't no trap," Dean gritted his teeth, "that fuckhead has him, hasn't he?" Cas nodded, biting his lips.
"I want you, Cas. I think I always have, but it just- I just hid all my emotions and everything under the fucking rug because I didn't know how to deal with it. But then when you said that I said that I couldn't- lo-love you, I realised it wasn't true. I CAN love you. I WANT to love you. And I NEED you to know that," Dean said, now frowning and breathing hard, trying to get the words out somehow.
Castiel woke up the next morning feeling like he got hit by a truck. He wished he did. It would honestly hurt less. When Cas properly woke up he realised he was in Dean's room and suddenly panicked. He shouldn't be here. He quickly got dressed, realising his white shirt had been newly washed and dried, and carefully left the room. He bumped into Dean in the hallway, who was carrying a glass of orange juice and pancakes in a plate in his other hand.
"We'll get him back. Let's go," Clary interjected, and turned towards the door, not waiting for a reply. Cas saw Alec pull out his bow and arrow before following Clary out the door, always ready for a fight.
It was 3 weeks later when he met Castiel again. Cas didn't have time to hurry away because Dean caught up and pulled him into the busted and dirty alleyway.
"Hey sweetheart let's just talk this through alright?" Dean smiled his award-winning charming smile as he walked away from Sam. He knew he was in deep shit but least he could do was keep his brother safe.
"Cas, I'll be fine, you know me," Dean said casually knowing full well Lucifer was watching the whole scene unwind.
Dean looked up asking Cas to pass his drink over to him, "yeah she's hot. I mean, she's not like our demon bunch- she's cool." Cas rolled his eyes pushing the glass towards his friend. Cas got a bit of rest and decided to head out for a bit, leaving Dean and Jack to research anything rift-related.
"Dean doesn't remember any that though. I erased his memory so that he didn't have any recollection of meeting me in hell. We officially met at a barn, and then Dean went stabbed me in the chest,"
"You remember this place?" Dean asked, trying to smile, but every time he looked into Cas's eyes, he just saw a broken angel.
The angel then went to check up on Dean. He had freshly come out of the shower with floppy wet hair when Cas entered his room.
"I'm sorry, Castiel. I just wanted to give you an idea," Inias said, "You've been good to us here, but David's started threatening to kick people out who don't side with him."
"What happened yesterday? I've heard about five versions of the same fucking story this morning," Dean said suddenly.
"Hey," Dean said. Cas looked shit scared. Dean bowed a little politely, offering his hand, which Cas took without hesitation and Dean pulled Cas into him leading him down the small steps and into the crowd. Dean hooked his arm into Cas's, guiding him over to where Sam and Jack were staring at them.
"Let's go," Dean said. Cas nodded, and silently followed him through the forest. Dean didn't bother making conversation as he normally would, and he kept a few steps ahead of Cas. Being in purgatory was difficult for them, but they put their differences aside to complete the task.
"Trixie's teacher called, she got into trouble and Maze is dropping me off at her school. I handed the case over to Dan to handle it so if you want, you can work with him. But Lucifer, please play nice," Chloe said checking her phone unbothered to remove the strand of hair that fell over her face.
"Cas!" Dean screamed through all of nature's natural forces encircling them. Cas didn't look up. The only thing that made sure Dean knew Cas was even alive was the unbearable screaming.
"You're a dashing lad and you seem... interesting. But needless to worry, I'll keep my distance. I know your delightful little angel wouldn't be too please if I laid a hand on you," Lucifer said, again, teasing with a suspicious smirk plastered over his face. Dean thought about those words for a bit but decided to just drop it. The devil and the hunter had a delicious dinner, with Lucifer asking the most unusual questions down to the last detail- he was very thorough. Dean was careful not to reveal too much or anything important that could put his family and his world at risk. Like Sam said before, one Lucifer was enough.
Sam, Dean and Rowena waited. The field was an empty one indeed, stretching for miles, far and wide. Sam helped arrange and prepare the ingredients, while Rowena went over the spell one last time. Dean meanwhile paced back and forth restlessly.
"Monsters I get, but humans? Humans are complicated," Dean said laying his three knives onto the table without a care.
"Hey, feathers," Dean grunted, "can you turn the damn AC down? I'm freezing my balls off over here."
There was another blast behind them. One of Castiel's followers, Katelyn, called, "commander, the building is falling and we're losing. We must leave." Her eyes fell to Dean.
Sam and Dean left the impala and entered their motel room, switching on the light to find a bunch of strangers in black clothing and strange weaponry standing before then. Dean pulled out his .45 caliber, and Sam yanked out the angel blade.
“I know, dude, I know. I don’t feel peachy either. You’re fine.” Dean started to walk backwards. The heels of the angel’s shoes dragged in the dirt as he was pulled to the barn doors. Dean stopped when he noticed the doors were closed again. He carefully lifted one foot and kicked the door open. It swung open with a bang and he walked backwards through.
“Listen to me, Dean. Think about it. You’re at a bar. You’re drunk. You’re vulnerable. So is that girl you have been looking at all night. You walk over to her, sweet talk her, kiss her and bring her home. That’s the last and only time you see her.” Cas was now staring right into Dean, his eyes sad and angry at the same time.
Dean furrowed his brows. He placed his ear against the wood of the door, trying to listen for anything. Bed creaking, tv on.
As Sam worked, Dean wiped Cas’ forehead and face dry from the sweat with his sleeve. Cas’ eyes drooped closed again and his head fell forward onto Dean’s shoulder, making the hunter freeze.
With a chuckle, Dean stood up and moved the bowl to the coffee table in front of the couch. He grabbed a blanket from Sam’s bed next to him and draped it over the young Winchester gently. He turned off the TV and, as quietly as he could, walked out of the room and closed the door.
“Dean, you alright?” Cas asked, his deep voice impossibly lower. The hunter but his lip and nodded, his eyes slipping closed.
Raising an arm above his head to shield his face from any damage, Dean tenses his body in preparation for another blast of air only for a flash of light to fill the room, almost as if it were a secluded strike of lightning. Blinding and powerful, eviscerating in its existence but mute in the sudden absence of anything.
But, Dean was almost at ease. This girl, who he only met maybe 45 minutes ago, was treating him like they have been friends for years. Making sure he was okay.
Cas made a painful sound and his face scrunched up and Dean looked up at him, his heart beating at a million miles an hour. “I know buddy, I know. We’re gonna fix you up. Just like I told you.”
“Here, here!” Sam ran back over with rags,  more bandages and medical tape. He gave them to Dean and started to slowly peel off the old bandage. As Sam did so, Dean quickly covered up the wound with the rags and applied pressure.
Five more minutes went by, then ten. After 20 minutes, he gave up. Jack wasn’t coming. Not even for Cas.
“You’ve been sat here reading for hours. Even I don’t do that. What are you looking for anyway?” Sam cranes his neck to try and read the cover of a book that sat on the top of one stack but Dean slams his hand down on the book, covering up the title.
“Okay, Sammy, I’ll leave you alone, but I can’t do this hunt on my own. Who knows how many vamps are in there. I’ll call Ralph and Tim and fill them in. I heard they were in Omaha a couple days ago so they can easily zip up there.” Dean reached in his pocket and grabbed his phone and started scrolling through his contacts.
Dean knocked three times with the back of his hand, “Cas? Hey, uh…Sam ordered pizza if you want any.” He waited for some kind of response. Nothing come back. “Come on Cas. You’re gonna have to come out eventually, might as well feed yourself.”
Dean glanced down and saw that Cas still had a hold on his elbow. He lifted his eyes to  the angels, “Uh, Cas? Can I have my arm back?”
After they broke apart to catch their breath, Dean noticed a sudden dim in Cas’ eyes. There was always a glimmer of…something in them, but ever since that moment, the glimmer wasn’t there. Cas wouldn’t look Dean in the eye for any longer than 2 seconds. They would have conversations, but they weren’t anything more than small talk, really.
They have been on the road for a few hours and they drove into this weather system maybe 30 minutes ago and unfortunately it didn’t seem to show any sign on letting up.
Dean thought, “South Dakota, uh….St. Mary’s Hospital…” He squeezed his eyes shut and took in a deep breath, hoping to subdue the nausea in his throat.
But now, the one person he didn’t want to see is sitting 2 feet away from him and all he wants to do is open the car door and bail and not face the situation head on.
“Cause when someone is unsure of their feelings, or is uncomfortable about something, others try to help that person. They talk to them and help them”
Dean stood from his crouch and attempted to scrub the exhaustion clinging to his heavy eyes. A thirty six hour bender of drinking without sleep has done a number on his body, especially now given Chuck’s lack of helpful influence, and he realized with popping knees and the newly discovered vision problems that he wasn’t the young hunter he used to be.
He could already feel a small change in the air around him. It was almost like the molecules in the empty space were being pushed out of place. The metal sheeting on the roof started to rattle and shift as the wind began to pick up. The hunter looked up towards the banging. His heart pounded against his rib cage and huffs of hot breath escaped through his lips in small translucent clouds.
Castiel stayed in the hospital for another 3 days, just as a precaution, and the doctors said that the wound on his side was healing amazingly. Dean stayed with him most of the day, getting him food, helping him to and from the bathroom, and with his daily hygiene routine.
Dean lifted his head and saw Castiel walking towards him. He looked the same as Dean. His trenchcoat soaked in blood and mud. His hair mussed and tears in the fabric of his coat went in every direction.
Then suddenly, something cold whacked his face and the ringing stopped. He heard pats of footsteps come close to him and a muffled voice. It was intermittent, but it was higher pitched. A woman.
They kissed until Dean needed to catch his breath and they rested their foreheads together. Their breaths synchronized.
“Cool. Lets go.” He put his bag of chips on the seat beside him, and pulled out of the gas station with nothing but gravel flying out behind them as they sped onto the road.
That feeling of love took control and closed the space between them. A touch that neither of them thought would ever exist.
Somehow Sam’s eyes got even wider, which kinda scared Dean. He didn’t know that was possible. “You had a panic attack?! Since when did you start having those?”
The brothers talked for another hour about the events of the past days and Sam decided to order pizza. No one was in the mood to cook tonight.
Dean blinked up at Sam who was staring back at him, “What? Yeah, uh, Harrold, South Dakota. Should be there in about 6 hours, give or take. Gank the vampy sons-of-bitches and be out of there by sunrise.”
Dean looked to his left where the deep greeting came from. Cas stood about 7 feet away from him, as stoic as he always was. The hunter couldn’t help looking him up and down, almost searching for something to tease him about, but of course, he looks the goddamn same. Same dirty trenchcoat, same flip flopped tie. Same two top shirt buttons undone that almost line up with his Adam’s apple as it bobbed up and down. He could picture himself dragging his tongue over it and nibbling on his jawline as he snuck his hand under his-
He let out a deep shaky breath as he raised an unsteady hand to pat at his numerous pockets, searching for the crumpled piece of paper with a sloppily written incantation scribbled on it.
Dean’s eyes went wide. He didn’t expect this from the angel, but he liked it. He liked being taken control over. From him always being the leader on hunts, if he could be dominated in the bedroom, it was a fantastic day.
The relief that washed over the hunter was substantial and his face softened. They both stayed there in silence, staring at each other, the agreement setting itself in invisible stone.
“I can’t carry you. I’m too weak myself. I’m gonna have to drag you. Open your eyes, Cas!” He tapped the angel’s cheek again which made his eyes open. “Look at me, look at me…hey. You’ll be fine. I’ll get you out of here.”
Dean lit the match and dropped it in the worn silver bowl sitting in front of him on the bar. The hunter lifted his head and looked around the room, listening intently for a swish of wings or for the light bulbs to spontaneously burst but all he was met with was silence.
How could he be so stupid? Of course Cas was trying to avoid him. It was the goddamn kiss. Now that he thought of it, did Cas actually kiss him back? Did he even want it in the first place?
“Yes there is.” he spoke firmly. The hunter let out a huff and pulled Cas in, their lips crashing together in desperation. The angel let out a quick gasp through his nose but almost immediately grabbed the fabric of Dean’s jacket at his sides and pulled him close. He opened his mouth and let Dean settle into the kiss.
“Atta boy, keep doing that. We’re almost at the car. Just keep saying my name.” The rain pelted them in the face as they slumped through the mud. The blood in Dean’s hair started to drip down his forehead and into his left eye. He shut it to keep anymore out.
“Ho-ly shit.” Dean swore and chuckled. Cas laughed, softly letting down Dean’s leg, a soft groan coming from Dean as the stiffness of having his leg yanked up like that showed itself. The ex-angel ducked down, kissing Dean deeply, the hunter raking his fingers from the bottom of Cas’ neck and up through his hair.
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a long breath, “Seriously, Dean?” The older hunter laughed and clapped his brother on the shoulder.
Cas pushed himself up into a sitting position and leaned back against the cement wall. He closed his eyes for a long beat and took in a deep breath. “I had a small nap and I was feeling a lot better…I was hoping to see if I had any grace left at all, so…I took off the bandage and tried to heal myself. I guess it made it worse instead…”
Castiel pushed the button on the glove box door in front of him and the door dropped open, revealing said map. He grabbed it and opened it up, finding South Dakota and folding up the rest of it so he could see just the state. After a few minutes, Dean got back in the car holding a coke and a bag of Fritos. He opened the bag, took a couple pieces, shoved them in his mouth and angled the bag towards Cas. He made a small hum, apparently asking if Castiel wanted any. The Angel shook his head and Dean shrugged, grabbing a couple more pieces and eating them.
Jack did it. He killed God. He was okay too. Maybe a little banged up, but alive. They all came back to the bunker, Jack and Sam went straight to the infirmary to get him patched up and Dean and Cas went to Dean’s man cave for a beer.
“He did it, man.” Dean shook his head as he popped open his bottle and took a swig. “Jack freaking did it.”
He stares for a moment at the set up in front of him with furrowed brows and squinted eyes, as if enough concentration will start the ritual and he wouldn’t have to initiate anything, but to no avail. The barn door rattled against the frame as a gust of wind caught it, the slap of the wood interrupting the crickets banter. The colder breeze hit his ankles and ran up his legs in encouragement and he took a step forward towards his duffle bag and grabbed a dark red stained growler.
It was 3 am when he finally arrived at the barn. He pulled into the dusty driveway and around a sharp turn behind some tall trees and shifted the impala into park. He grabbed the duffle bag and got out and headed towards the grungy, weathered barn, but not before he grabbed his .45 pistol out of the trunk, loaded it with Angel killing bullets. You know, just in case. Oh, and a crowbar.
“Cas…” he repeated, not as soft as before, but his voice cracked the slightest bit. He waited for a reply. He waited for the deep register of his angel to respond, letting him know that he succeeded, and that everything was okay. He needed the reassurance that it was over.
“Vampires.” Sam confirmed with a nod. Dean sloshed the liquid in his mouth and swallowed. He slaps his hand on the table and stands up.
Dean felt an overwhelming need to be closer to Cas suddenly. He stood up, shuffled over to the bed and sat down beside the ex-angel, their knees brushing ever so slightly.
Desiree opened the door to her apartment and walked in, Dean following behind her. He walked past her into the main room as she closed the door and dropped her keys into the bowl on table next to her.
All Dean could do was stare at the broken man in front of him. The man that was always the rock in their team. The one who was strong, never backed down, and never showed his weaknesses.
“This was the deal. You have let yourself be happy. I brought Jack back to Earth in exchange for you.” the woman said, her voice monotone but smooth.
But then he couldn’t stop thinking about Cas. Lying in that cold, white hospital. Alone, hurt and scared. He could wake up at anytime. He wouldn’t know what was happening.
They said their goodbyes and she walked out of the room. Dean grabbed the handles of the duffle bag and swung it over his shoulder. “Ready to go, bubble boy?”
a web of spidersilk, woven by Black Widow witches. It holds dreams and visions and is impossible to recreate.
“Come with me, Cas,” Dean implores, one hand reaching out, barely touching Castiel. “I’m sure we could tear away the Ring of Obedience.”
writing Enochian on my baby," Dean warned as he shifted gears, eyeing the chalk that Ash held with his fingers, bypassing the usual means of travel so they could move around Heaven smoothly.
“Jack was missing. I thought it prudent to return with both rather than leave them for the cold. The vultures are circling already,” Castiel responds.
He sighed as he dragged himself out of bed to pick the cleanest set of clothes he could find in his closet. He had choices, never mind that he mostly wore a white button-down anyway. The mere fact that he was allowed choices, instead of the standard dark-pinstripe that the usual angels wore, was still a novelty despite the years that he had been allowed it.
“I chased your father across the Atlantic as soon as he left.” Her ears were an endearing shade of red.
Mary hesitates, deep frown lines etched in her face forming into a tight smile, but she says with conviction, “If you go without him, you’ll fail.”
Thank you, Lucifer, for bringing in more reason to be distrustful in Heaven. There was nothing in Charis that screamed death and destruction, but Dean's human senses had been wrong before. Lilith had occupied a child when Dean first saw her.
on tumblr whose meta was the one that started this fic off. It was a bit difficult becuase Season 9 had locked all angels out so how was I going to build a Heaven with angel's point of view? (I do not have tumblr, I barely write in Facebook and LJ as it is, I do not want to add more temptation XD)
Castiel braced his hand against his wind-whipped hair and smiled. The deepening peach of the sky as the sun finally deigned to show up filled him with warmth. “I think it’s just about perfect.”
Once Castiel had arranged himself sufficiently on the couch, and Bobby had dragged something comfortable to sit on to make the angel's neck eye level, Cas hyperextended his neck and drew a line on his neck from his ear to his clavicle, "This muscle is the sternocleidomastoid." Castiel then pointed to the area that bisected the muscle he previously mentioned. "This blood vessel is the external jugular."
Tears spring unbidden to Castiel’s eyes as he takes a deep breath of Jacob’s baby scent. “I’m so very happy to meet you.”
Dean scrabbles at Castiel, pulling several feathers from the base where Castiel’s wings meet his back. Castiel relinquishes to Dean, letting him flip them over. One of his wings is in an uncomfortable angle, but he’s content to lose himself in the moment and grinds against the Prince shamelessly.
Castiel let out a sharp whistle to which both horses acknowledged and began turning back towards them. It sent Dean into a temporary panic because now, instead of running full speeds around the lake, they were running
At that Lucifer stopped laughing, blinked out of existence, and reappeared in front of Dean, blocking Michael from view. The only things separating Dean and Lucifer were the bars of the Cage in its ethereal light. "Why would a Prince of Heaven lower himself to do your bidding?"
“Glad to be here,” Dean said with a smirk towards Benny. He then pointed over his shoulder and asked, “you remember Sammy, right?”
She rubbed her eyes as if wiping Sandman's dust away from them and blinking owlishly up to Gabriel. "An archangel is in Heaven again. Hallelujah, for we are not alone," she whispered in awe, her hands letting go of his to pat Gabriel's cheeks as if she wasn't sure that he was there.
Dean blinked rapidly, realizing that he had been lost in his thoughts. “Yeah, Sammy,” he said, giving his brother a solid smack to the back.
Castiel drank the sight of Dean but shook himself from his musings. He quickly changed into his sturdy pants and a white shirt he’d appropriated from Dean. It still smelled faintly of leather, coal, and a scent that Castiel identified uniquely as Dean’s.
To work off his frustration at the lack of results, Cas increases Dean's workload with his arm. He's started with calisthenics for the shoulder. Now, Cas adds weights by using wooden daggers. They practice basic training drills. When Sam watches, Castiel's ability to move so dexterously surprises him.
Castiel has grown red over the exchange, his fingers pinched over his nose. "We exhibit sexual dimorphism in the Eyrie. Female griffins are wingless but larger than males, presumably to protect the nest. Therefore, females are called lionesses, males are eagles and are winged. Raphael has treaties on it written somewhere if you want to peruse it."
“And who would’ve given him the opportunity, huh?” Dean asked, before taking a deep breath. “Sam, I wouldn’t have offered him a ride if I thought he was dangerous. He seemed like a nice guy on the boat.” Dean suddenly narrowed his eyes at Sam, who gulped at that. “We’re slipping out of Stava, too. Don’t forget that.”
“Hmm, you’re getting shabby again,” she comments, continuing her one-sided conversation. She trails her fingers on the tail ends of Castiel’s primaries, stretching them in front of her, making the angle awkward. “Make sure to ask someone to groom your wings before Lucian comes for a visit. It wouldn’t do for her to see my slaves unkempt.”
*I gotcha, Cas,* Dean responds in the spear thread, his hand clenched around his own Jewel. *We’ll take your boy and go. No kneeling necessary.*
As soon as he reached the lake, he ignored the clouds that were obscuring the sky; it was downcast and gloomy and not really conducive to anything but lying down, head buried under a pillow with comforters and a hot chocolate. Which was more reminiscent of Christmases before the fire that killed his mother, rather than the calm before storm but what the hell, right? It fit well with his mood and he just wanted to send a big shout out saying "fuck you" straight to Metatron because Heaven was made to be
Sam was suddenly unsure as he studied the length of the ship. “Captain Lafitte is meeting us right, Dean?”
Cas didn't have music preferences, and Cas didn't understand pop culture references, so it made things difficult for song choices. With previous tapes, he knew what the person liked or disliked at least, but Cas was a blank slate. In a way, it was up to Dean to give Cas the best music possible because this would be his musical education. So he chose the songs with care, and he appraised the next song like he would consider what knife to bring on a hunt.
Dean shook his head; anything Bobby related at this point would just be visiting family, and there was time enough for that later, when they had gotten what they'd come for. "You sure this girl—Ysa—wants out?"
Bobby eyed the two once more before he looked away with a grunt. “Fine. Come in, then. Guess you’ll be stayin’ the night, huh?” He turned with a nod and headed inside.
Sam stilled. If their parents were offering their blessing and support for the university, then Sam didn’t really have to be away. That left Dean. Dad’s gaze swung to him next before he said, “I talked to Naomi last night. Given the current situation, the deal with the Novaks is off.”
from him, and kept that knowledge to himself when he did find out, the fallout would be much worse. Not that Dean looked like he wanted to return to Stava for the wedding, anyway. He was dead set on staying at Stanford with his brother.
Michaela moans, reveling in the heat of a Warlord Prince at the cusp of his prime. His sexual heat, the part of the Warlord Prince’s nature designed to entice a female, washes over her. She’s been enjoying it since his maturity.
"Then at least we're not going through another Apocalypse," Castiel said in mild relief as they watched the souls drift peacefully towards the falls, infusing it with their bright light. Cas smiled ruefully. "Just something like it, then. I think I can handle 'something like it.' "
Castiel passes by Dean’s room. He misses the side table that Dean brought from Castiel’s temporary room to embellish Dean’s when Cas had been human. Once Castiel had regained his grace, the table quietly disappeared.
The griffin snorts, ruffling Dean's short auburn hair, and Sam swears that it rolls its eyes. After another light show, Castiel appears again, his arms crossed in front of himself and glaring at Dean.
Despite not being allowed his Jewels, Castiel could stand against Alastair, and the Master of the Guard knows it. Should he be lucky and kill Castiel, Michaela wouldn’t tolerate it. For the first time, Castiel notices Samandiriel, frozen on his seat at the display. Before he could say something to the Prince, Jack scurries to his lap and places a bowl of caramelized popcorn in front of him.
—members of the blood whose physical bodies have died but retained residual power, retaining their death wounds. Is the reason why assassins must 'finish the kill' by draining the Jewels before death. Can 'live' with taking blood, to maintain their bodies, thereby transitioning to being Guardians (see Guardian). Otherwise, they return to the darkness.
In the flurry of the new arrivals, it had taken a while for Castiel to get back to Dean. Dean was seated on his chair, his fishing line taut in Shehaqim, just as Castiel had found him once upon a dream, a lifetime ago.
“Oh yeah, yeah. I’ve always wanted to vacation in Bermuda,” Becky babbled on, her attention already drifting. She bagged the book and gave him the receipt. “Anyway, if you need books for your NovaWatch, you can direct download from our server here or just use the NVCode on your receipt. Have a nice day!”
“GRACE network access is forbidden by the user. Triangulating via local radio transmitters,” Nova answered.
Both Hannah and Jack settle in the middle, and the trunk is long enough, despite being narrow, that they are far away from Balthazar and Castiel’s axes.  Hannah calls in a decanter filled with ale, honey, and spices and pours some over the gnarled log. Jack happily writes the symbols he’s learned from his lessons before they strip the tree of its bark.
"I am not that unreasonable, Kevin. I will merely persist in the early morning if that is what you want," Castiel answered, but Kevin had already opened the door to his room, and Castiel stepped in, setting the small bowl down on the table that Kevin used for research.
Neither of them mentioned it, but Dean could feel the curiosity bursting out of Sam with his knee occasionally bumping Dean’s.
Dean waved back to the horse, who seemed to be looking at the whole exchange with amusement. Dean didn’t even know how he knew that it was amusement, because Dean was in a full-blown panic. “That’s worse! I'm not gonna be blown up into tiny pieces because you got a hankering to be a horse thief!”
Lucifer laughed and motioned with a sweep of his hands, manifesting a chair for him to sprawl over, legs wide open in easy invitation. Lucifer gave Dean a lascivious look, bordering on a leer, which bothered Dean enough for him to look away because dealing with a frankly sexual Lucifer was definitely way out of his comfort zone. "Don't you, now?"
“What you got for me, Sammy?” Dean asked when he heard the door close and assumed Sam had come back from his errands downtown.
Mary smiles patiently and reminds him, “Practice the weave for precision and finesse. You need control for that. When you’re in danger, a blast from all the reserves of your Green is still a bludgeon. It will incapacitate anyone lighter than a Green.”
be found?” Luke scoffed, shaking his head and pulling in a lungful of cigarette smoke before offering one to Castiel. He shrugged when Castiel declined. “I’m to accompany you until you see sense and let me escort you back to the fold. So to speak.”
“I know that’s a big reason you didn’t like your engagement. You thought I was unhappy with my situation.” Mom picked up where Dad faltered again, and Dean didn’t know how he never saw it. Mom had always been his dad’s silent supporter. Other than the engagement, she said nothing bad about Dad, waited for him patiently during the evenings when they had meals in the galley. “I was unhappy because my father sent me away, and life was
“Get me some white bread, and none of your healthy crap.” Dean orders while Sam retrieves vegetables for a sandwich. “And a side of egg-oil-juice.”
Before Sam said anything more, Dean opened the door with a snap, leaving Sam in the bathroom with his thoughts.
Castiel’s smiles grow shaper through every humiliating display that Lady Lucian does. His eyes are the sleepy gaze of a Warlord Prince approaching cold anger.
The Coach jolts to a stop, and the carriage doors opening cuts Dean off. Castiel sees their driver, dark brown hair peppered with white, and a full-month-old beard covering his face. “Come on, we still have to prep the Altar.”
It had flung Dean to the side. Thankfully, he is awake if a little stunned. The Green-Jeweled Warlord Prince has the faculties to send spears of power and take out the males that Jack hadn’t dealt with. They are few, and Dean dispatches them easily.
Dean curses up a storm as he struggles, not knowing if dying by plunging into the abyss is a better fate than being slashed to death by talons before being picked clean.
"You know I hate eating in my room," Kevin scolded as he broke the disposable chopsticks that Castiel had brought in half and took his share of the food.
Dean rolled his eyes and was about to retort when he noticed the Impala cruising along slowly by the lane with all the angels flanking it, being driven by— “Sammy! What are you doing with Baby?”
“Want me to read to you?” Castiel asks as he calls in a book from the shared library. Michaela isn’t one for old tomes, not like the aristos of Hayll. She’s an Eryien and values fighting more than she does words, but despite the small selection, there is a library. The book Castiel chose is filled with prurient material. As with most books of the class, it is unobtrusive and simply bound in unadorned leather. “I have a pleasant reading voice, I’m told.”
“I have no idea,” Dean said and then laughed because, for the first time, he felt free. “Probably help this brainiac with his dream to go to Stanford. It’s kinda a relief not to know.”
What he finds there would forever be etched in Dean’s mind. His father, shielded, protecting Sam, battling against a Warlord Prince unleashing the Red. His dad won’t win against that much power.
The man shrugged, addressed Dean and Sam’s purchases before they were on their way to some remote field, preferably in a state that was more fireworks friendly.
He listened to the riffs of the guitar, calm in the sea of dark thoughts swirling around his head. The music, along with taking care of Baby, helped him decide.
Gabriel extricated himself from the throng as he approached the tree and flattened his palm against his bark. "Nope, it's more the spell. The Enochian base is similar enough to my horn that it's calling to angels." Gabriel winced. "Aaand regardless of the base of the spell, unleashing this much grace was bound to get some attention."
Jack, his wings trembling, looks at them both. While Castiel wishes that in his heart of hearts that he could accompany the child, it is not done. And he knows that Jack fears Lucian. With a shaking hand, Jack silently reaches for his mother.
The griffin is lying on his side, with its legs bent and the tail swaying back and forth. As soon as Dean approaches, its tail tenses and curls closer to itself, twitching minutely before resting still. Some feathers are littered around the creature and a few that are at its beak.
Dean can already feel the impending headache. He turns his head towards the griffin. "I was gonna thank you, but was tripping me necessary?"
Souls take their human shape in the Pit because it is all they have known. Castiel was grace made light. Castiel could still intervene and had the upper hand. In an instant, Castiel was between the rack and the blade. There was a broad smile in this human's eyes, slightly mad, slightly anguished even though he was the one holding the knife. "Hail and be glad, o favored one," Castiel whispered, recognizing the soul, if not his form. "At long last, God's messenger has reached you. Salvation is at hand."
,” Castiel murmurs to the shell of Dean’s ear, Dean rocking on Castiel’s cock. The rhythm starts slow but builds momentum as it devolves into erratic, fast, and rough thrusts. Castiel could do nothing else but lose himself in Dean’s warm heat. Dean’s cock is red, leaking, and bouncing against his stomach with every thrust, leaving trails of wetness on Castiel, marking him. “Desperately. Endlessly. Tirelessly.”
Dean maneuvered the car and used the headlights to light their way as he set up the fireworks. He covered the hood with a blanket from the trunk, something kept for inclement weather, and arranged their impromptu picnic made up of leftovers from the Market and Deli across it. Food was bountiful since they were still not accustomed to large American portions. In the place of pride at the center of the feast was Dean’s stolen pie.
Dean flipped the page over to check who wrote—prayed, whatever—the words. At the bottom, signed in symbols that Dean recognized as Enochian was an angel name.
He remembered being told, but he had forgotten to actually go and do it. It was one of those annoying quirks of humanity without having his grace other than eating and sleeping and taking showers. Pointless and forgettable until suddenly his friends were haggard and wondering where he was at – he checked his watch – nine in the evening and running themselves ragged looking for him.
Dean brings pillows to her feet. Pretending to nod off, he rests his eyes but keeps his ears open. He listens to the crickets as they call out while waiting for his mom to gather her thoughts.
Dean hastily handed the items he bought to Castiel, who turned over the messenger bag, to examine the bright bee clasp. “So you don’t have to lug your heavy suitcase around. You could just keep all the important things in there.”
The sloshing of the water heralds Dean resting his head on his palms as he looks at Castiel from the pools languidly. “Relax a bit, Cas, no one’s out to get you here.”
because time travel and aliens, and just really his first book ever. But when he walked back, he was frustrated to find said book missing. Dean moves the books nearby to check if there were any volumes hidden behind but hangs his head in dismay.
for something more than your food because we pay our workers enough!” Castiel growled, shaking the fistful of cash in the air. Dean carefully took the money and gave it to Sam.
Gabriel chortled, tapping the bar for another drink. “I can tell with the way you’re moping and all.”
(Or maybe it was because he was locked up after the Garden, but CAS should have known better). One of the
That wasn't happening any time soon. Castiel might have opened a crack and lifted Sam out of the Cage, Death might have relieved Lucifer of Sam's soul, but Dean wasn't anything close to power with those two beings. Entering the Cage would be more torture than staying in Hell for forty years. "No can do."
Kevin gave a rundown of basic nautical terms—something Castiel was sure was more for him than the two new crew members. For the next few hours, they were taught about rudimentary navigation, as well as emergency drills. Lots and lots of drills. Castiel thought all the exercises were overwhelming.
Dean’s Birthright Ceremony shortly after his tenth birthday comes like the first daffodils after a howling winter.
Sam smirked and pointed to the flyer on the bed. “It opens at ten this morning and closes at ten tonight.”
“I was taking the steam bus.” Castiel thought he was soaking Dean’s shirt with both snot and tears, but Dean wouldn’t let him escape the circle of his arms
“Okay, then I suppose I’ll ride with Dean,” Manny said, remaining in line. Dean gave Sam a huge thumbs up, mouthing ‘thank you’ to his answering scowl. Sam gestured at him to shoo.
. You built a complete cabin away from the palace," Naomi said in entreaty. "Eagles die of pining when they do not mate."
While Cas and John's first meeting was guarded, Cas and Sam take to each other well. One moment they are talking about grimoires and the next moment, Sam is interrogating Cas about his knowledge on the Men of Letters' magic.
Motioning to the table to distract Dean, Castiel busies himself with the Dean's after training rituals. The Prince is wholly enthralled by the feathers. Castiel knows it would be a problem if Michaela gets wind of the stash. Castiel runs the bath, warming the water while putting in the herbs that the Prince likes. Then he adds medicine to soothe his aches.
When Castiel manages to crawl to a tree to support himself, he surveys the surroundings. The blast of power toppled all the trees and leveled the Sanctuary to the dust. None of the witches from the coven are standing, even Lucian, and the males are scattered and disoriented.
“The lady must really love you,” Dean says, appreciating the artwork. It’s cut from solid marble, its wings flared up and offered to the skies.
Castiel gives him a wide gummy grin in congratulations. If Jack had been stronger, he would have been ringed as a dangerous male, traded court to court to get a darker-colored Jewel. Opal is stable, solid, and able to protect if needed.
“My mother is Lady Lucian,” Jack informs him, then he sits on the bench nodding at the sculpture. “And my father is Castiel, although I haven’t had my Birthright Ceremony yet.”
Castiel stills, cutting his eyes to Lucian, and Michaela takes note of it. He’s been her slave for centuries and knows most of his tells.
They’ve absurdly ended up sectioning the bunker in half, with two shirts on a pole substituting as flags. The floor is littered with the spent pellets. Dean and Castiel have taken the toilets while Jack and Sam have sequestered the entire kitchen. Jack and Castiel are worse shots than Sam and Dean, but the Nerf gun that Dean acquired has a fast reload, evening out the odds. It works more like a machine gun than pistols.
Thankfully, Sam had given him a piece of his mind when Bobby announced that Cas had taken off. He’d suggested the bee farm. Good old Sam, who had his back despite being mad over Stanford.
“Don’t need to show me,” Dean interrupted as he slid back into the main highway. “Just tell me you didn’t kill, steal, or maim to get it.”
“First, I’m not a kid, Dean. Second, I only just applied for my place, so I gotta wait for their response.”
he wasn’t gonna win against Dean alone. Sam waited to drop this bomb at breakfast with Cas and Bobby.
Dean chuckled and snagged the canvas vest he used for work to put over his worn, secondhand cotton shirt.
To be denounced by your own kind hurt. Castiel hadn't known that he'd wanted to belong so badly until he'd been faced with the truth of the matter. He was an outcast and an angel's cornerstone was the feeling of belonging. It was why angels cut off from the Song perished. "I did not come here to talk about me."
“He means the mayonnaise,” Castiel clarifies. He’s already had this conversation with Dean over multiple sandwich-making experiments. Castiel has given up with trying to change anything Dean has dubbed with nicknames. This includes ridiculous foods that end up being more of a mouthful than the original words.
"Castiel, even your grace is literal," Gabriel huffed out in amusement before shaking his head at his brother. "Charis, Metatron must have mentioned the Caretaker to you. The only one that can rescind the lock on Heaven's doors."
Taking pity on Dean, Castiel leans down and licks around his fingers still inside Dean. It causes Dean to release a high-pitched wail, rocking against Castiel’s hand insistently, pushing against both his fingers and tongue.
The brothers stop to consider his words before Dean replies with, “You know, that ain’t a bad idea.”
"Castiel?" John sounds out the foreign name, and with his inherent suspicion comments, "That's an unusual name around these parts."
They visited the reef park and adventure dome after. Dean extended the stay to go to museums. Sam voted for the parks that were present in the hopes of making a small green relief in this concrete jungle. By the time the day-long detour into Vegas had stretched to four, they were fast running out of reasons to stick around.
Bobby pulled Dean up to his feet. "That angel of yours has believed in you since he pulled you out of Hell. We're in Heaven. Our coin is faith and promises. Cas believes in nothing—no one else—but you. You won't disappoint him, no matter what comes out of this clusterfuck."
The bells wake him: a loud tolling from Chesterford. Dean wipes his crusty eyes of sleep as he goes to the windows of the cottage, opening them to let the breeze in and to see out onto the horizon. Chesterford is some distance away, but apparently some magical contraption Castiel has in his house notifies him of the warning bells.
It was rude of her to ask. It was an unspoken rule that the citizens of Heaven did not talk of what they had lost, because that was too painful for this place. It was like asking outright how old you were, or who you voted for president, but more personal, and with more baggage. "Hunting accident, wasn't pretty."
Dean rubbed his fingers against the bridge of his nose to ward off an impending headache. “Worse. He’s marrying me off like Grandpa Samuel and Grandpa Henry did with him and Mom. Look where that got them.”
"Shurley?" John repeats with a different accent than Cas'. "Castiel Shurley is an interesting name."
She whirls to face Dean and shrieks, "Rumpatur!" her hands extend into claws, thrusting towards the hunter.
Castiel pondered the words Michael had given him while staring out into the ripening souls clinging to the Tree. The only being that Castiel could think of that had been 'cast the lowest', was Lucifer, and despite their Father's forgiving nature, Castiel couldn't reconcile the Angel of the Bottomless Pit to be the Caretaker of God's Throne as well.
"Yeah, yeah ok." This is what he's come to talking to a bird. It butts his head against Dean's shoulder again, chirping, which earns it another smile. So although Castiel is slightly cold, his pet is apparently willing to communicate.
“Wooow, it still works!” Jack says, grabbing Castiel’s arm to show his find, simultaneously cranking the telescope. The ancient machine’s cogs whine as it moves to his wishes.
“We just need to translate heat and light into a spell and thoughts,” Castiel tries to explain. He doesn’t have a lot of theoretical knowledge and soon would need other people to see to Jack’s learning.
"I'm Tessa," she introduced herself, and once, it wouldn't have mattered to Castiel. Names were things that had power and most immortals never exchanged them with lesser beings. It was the humans, and their constant want to describe things, in their need to be individuals, who had needed names.
“Balthazar Roché.” The man even sketched a low bow, which was all kinds of weird. It was the same man who’d given Castiel drinks. The same douche who’d earned Castiel’s fond smile—a smile that Dean had thought was reserved just for him. Dean rolled his eyes, and Balthazar chuckled. “Hard to please this crowd. Gabriel thought you might disappear before you said hello, so he sent me to fetch you.”
The Chevrolet Impala is obviously a 1960’s car (duh) and since we were going for steampunk, Baby was converted to its earlier cousin, a
Maybe it was the dim lighting, with the spotlight on center stage. Maybe it was the holos, but Dean felt like he’d been thrown under a stampede. He’d seen Cas in every corner of his world in the years he’d separated with him. While Sam called him out on it when they were in the Roadhouse, once he’d burned bridges with Castiel, it was as if his specter followed him everywhere.
Out of the blue, Dean was laughing so hard. He laughed because otherwise, he might have broken something, or worse: cried.
Castiel has taken to sewing homemade masks while taking a break from cleaning. A pandemic is sweeping across the world, and masks could extend some healthcare worker’s personal protective equipment. He has the time to spare and the skills to do it, so he sews. Mostly he finds old shirts that Dean and Sam have discarded or are too riddled with holes to use, and there are plenty. If he still has some scraps, he personalizes each mask with a flower. He often glues on a bee appliqué; embroidery would have worked better, but it compromised the cloth.
Dean grinned. “‘Cuz you were hot, and you looked so lost, standing in the middle of the street. Why’d you accept?”
Steeling himself, Castiel strolled towards Dean, his hands on the deep pockets of his trousers. He wished that Balthazar allowed him his coat, where he could have at least hidden some parts of himself.
Dean had taken one look at the foal that the Harvelles had produced and fallen in love. When his father saw Dean on top of the black mare, he’d smiled fondly and promised it to him when they could afford it. She’d had another name before, but Dean refused to call her anything other than Baby.
“You’re not using that term right,” Sam criticized while he glared at the cloth-wrapped goods—complete with its blue ribbon—in his lap.
He had wanted to beg for forgiveness, or a chance if Dean could only see why he chose to hide it. But Dean didn’t want explanations. Castiel could tolerate scorn; he could debase himself until Dean saw reason. But he cannot endure indifference.
"I've been tracking that witch since she built her hut in these forests," the dark-haired man growls. He furrows his brows, then looks towards the silver ashwood that litters the surrounding lands. "She's been wily in keeping herself hidden from me, but during her last hunt we crossed paths, and I managed to set her back. I've fought with other creatures here, but I have yet to see her."
"I see you met my pet." Metatron's arrival did not come with the sound of birds in flight but with a heavy whoosh of air. Charis, in contrast, had been noiseless. "Not content with Shehaqim, that you've come to pester me here?"
Castiel's experience had been unpleasant, but bearable. Like he had been constrained in the here and now and could not stretch his wings, like he had been breathing and moving through water instead of air. But Castiel had been a soldier in the lower ranks. The archangels were used to bleeding off grace, snapping realities into life was nothing to them. Castiel couldn't imagine how cut off Gabriel felt now.
“Do you know if NISC Twelve still has room for passengers?” Castiel asked, directly to the point. Though airships were already the mode of transport of choice for most, freighter ships could take up to a dozen paying passengers aboard their vessels.
Ash looked at the fire, then at Dean, and then slapped his palm against his forehead. "Uh, yeah, dude, I forgot to warn you. Sometimes when souls stay here long enough, their concept of Heaven changes. Other souls become incorporeal."
She gave Castiel a long, searching gaze, enough that the room's silence must have been uncomfortable for Kevin, before she responded, "No, I did not ferry this soul. I do remember Master Tran, though. Chosen."
Metatron with his angel blade was unlike other angels with theirs. He was unwieldy with it, he was slow in using it, and it looked like he'd never held a blade before. But Metatron was strong, he was graced-up, and most of all, couldn't be wounded fatally by Dean's own angel blade. Dean should know, he'd managed a few good hits in before the hunter had given up in attacking and just focused on reaching the Throne.
skip if you haven't seen season 10 ep 1 and you're particular about knowing those things ahead of time? But I don't think it's too spoilery.
As for shifters and vampires… They hid in the tower’s multiple levels having infiltrated some of the humans, adapting and hiding in the shadows. But overall, the towers were safer. So humans left the plains to the demons and surprisingly, to the devout.
"This was selfish of me." Castiel hacked a cough. He hadn't thought he would reach such an old age. "I shouldn't have indulged in what was, in essence, a movie."
Lucifer’s eyes flared deep blue in irritation, similar to a demon flashing their eyes black. It was a power play and Lucifer trying to assert his dominance over Gabriel. “Nope, I’m not going down that rabbit hole with you, brother," Gabriel said cheerfully, secure in the fact that he was beyond his brother's reach.
Outside, Dean opened Baby’s hood and stared blankly into her engine block. The smell of motor oil and grease reminded him of work back home, and he lost himself in its familiarity.
Dean cursed the bumpy roads around Sioux Falls, and for the hundredth time, thanked Sam for navigating. They arrived in South Dakota before it was fully dark, but the sun was already nearing nadir, ready to set.
"I didn't even know there was more than one tree," Dean muttered, stopping in front of the makeshift pew that he usually used for the entire reincarnation gig.
Somehow, Dean and Cas travel back to Winchester Manor with Dean's throbbing shoulder. After the Order of Hunters tests him with holy water and silver, the family descends on him as if they lost him for years instead of just a little over a month, recovering from his shoulder injury.
an angel whose name has been struck out since the first temptation of man, managed by Anahel (dimunitive: Anna)
Dean hastily mounted his own horse, but before Dean could utter a protest they were at the lake house already and Sleipnir was bending his forelegs to give Dean better access to the ground. He would have argued with the horse that he grew up in Kansas and he at least knew how to mount and dismount properly, if not ride, but he doubted that Sleipnir was going to let him explain.
Jack’s wings are relieved of tension, and they lay flat on his side. Castiel didn’t understand how Jack could be so complacent. But then, the child didn’t yet realize what servicing meant.  Castiel bows to Michaela in acknowledgment. She dismisses him with a wave, and he goes to where they took the Prince to heal.
He was absorbed in the familiar tale before he noticed that he wasn’t alone in the wings anymore. Dean was standing on the rail, leaning towards the side, and contemplating the waters. The sun wasn’t over the horizon yet, but the sky was already lightening.
"It's the closest that I could safely fly without Metatron knowing," Castiel explained, picking one of the roads that lead out of the Treasury. Like the Garden in the second heaven, all paths in seventh heaven lead to the Throne.
Then, written across the plastic in blocky letters were: CASTIEL NOVAK, followed by a cellphone number. He looked at Becky who shrugged and pushed the pile of books to him. “He does look dreamy doesn’t he?”
The entire arm is black and blue, and Dean winces as he looks. To distract himself from the discomfort of the examination, Dean focuses on the stranger's hands, which is feeling across the bone of his clavicle and his shoulder.
With a firm grip, Dean pulls the arrow's tip out with one yank. The griffin flaps its wings again, letting the empty cauldron sway, and the embers of the fire flare briefly before settling. Dean raises his uninjured arm up in defense, but the griffin does nothing. It has one eye closed, and the other eye fixed on him.
Castiel approaches Dean, a look of impatience on his face as he eyes the crimson hood. He strips the bed of its linen and covers Dean with it.
The server lays two steaming cups down in front of Dean before he answers. Dean nods to his father then calls in some coins for the drinks.
Coughing, Dean struggles to stand up, attempting to follow when the massive tail of the griffin sweeps under his feet and trips him.
Castiel frowned at Gabriel because they were actually going to something like a Tree of Souls and the archangel wasn't making any sense. Gabriel smacked his palm against his forehead. "I take it you have never watched James Cameron's
“Promise me you’ll keep this to yourself, Jack,” Castiel says once they both manage to remain awake with this… Leaching of power, for a lack of a better term to call it. “We’ll try to focus on shielding lessons for now.”
It made for a structured society with a complex hierarchy. While humans only had to contend with other humans, the entire angel hierarchy was based both on rank and species. While Castiel had been a malakh, raised as a seraph after his second death, Michael ranked as an archangel, classified as a seraph, and sometimes ruled as a principality. But Michael had always been the best of them all; he had been able to handle being in all three spheres of the Celestial Choir at the same time.
after Lucifer kills Castiel. However, Lucifer kills Castiel at the end of Season 12 to the beginning of Season 13, and the mixtape has canonically been given to Castiel at the indeterminate amount of time before season 12. (Most fanon believes Dean has given the mixtape right after Cas says I love you, I love all of you, and the mixtape is Dean's reply to Cas' confession) Besides, Dean is also correct, In My Time of Dying is Dean's death to Hell song. It's not something for Cas at all.
He told Sam to grab some cotton candy from a nearby stall. While Sam followed directions, Dean ran back to the ticket booth to snag some tickets so Manny could join in the fun with him at least once.
played. Once the song had ended, Dad stopped the recording and ejected both tapes before he handed his son the tape. “If you find songs you like, we can add it at the end so you have your own special track.”
Castiel noticed that Dean tensed and kept checking the rearview mirror. He was gripping the steering wheel intermittently while frowning at the road. He’d slowed down and was looking at exits.
Michael's doors were adorned with six pairs of bronze-plated, heraldic, burning wings, which probably reflected Michael's own, with his sword drawn through the center.
This fic happened because I really wanted to world build in Heaven and show how angels worked their grace in terms of spells and just angel mythos. Form there I wanted to work with Metatron's Spell, a whole lot of inspiration came off
He drifted off to sleep with the chorus repeating itself over and over, and the cassette proceeded to record the next songs onto the track.
"I have virtually no grace left, I can pass through a smaller opening and faster than any of you," Castiel explained to the angels who could hear him, although Gabriel gave him a look of exasperation. Archangels never explained their choices, they just were. "Besides, I am Gabriel's
"The Caretaker is your priority over everything. Heaven cannot be locked for long," Gabriel pronounced.
He marched over to sweet pies, seeing that there were several in a row inside a glass case. One, with a slice missing and a scattering of crushed almonds on top, had a blue ribbon pinned into its crust. His stomach rumbled at all the sweets and felt himself salivating.
for you—he’s even asking me. If Michael could somehow piggyback on the Novak wearables, he would have done it days ago. Thank god
Castiel huffed in amusement. Kevin continued to drive them towards the bunker, but he glanced sideways at Cas. "Do you want to stop by the usual place before going home?"
When the song ended, he wasn't sure about the addition. This song was about devotion, but also it has words like:
“Pizza is the unhealthiest food on the planet,” Sam complains, pulling out mixing bowls from the ancient cupboards for the ingredients. One good thing about the industrial kitchen is that it was designed to serve many people at once. They’ve never run out of mixing bowls. “The least we could do is just load it with vegetables.”
When Dean looks towards the village, two dots illuminate the night sky. This far, they are mere flickering specks, but the lights, coupled with the clanging can only mean one thing: children are missing again.
"Cassie, I think he broke it," Gabriel whines pitifully, pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off further bleeding. It wasn't straight before, but it could have been called regal in some circles. Now the bend would be noticeable.
The odd gesture of Castiel fist pressed to his chest. "Charis?" It came out as a question when Dean had meant it as a statement.
Jack kneels down on the snow, cupping the blood-red perennial flowers. They smell like a mix of plumerias and lilies. “Castiel said Mother requested Aunt Michaela to send for the statue when I was born.”
“Happy enough, I’d wager, with a piece of skirt like that.” Luke gave the brunette a leer. “He obviously doesn’t want you. He’s building a life here for himself.”
Dean stood up abruptly, eyes going towards the location where the answering tone had echoed. "Was that Metatron?"
Castiel tried to think back on similar experiences in college, but he’d had his own servants then, and barely went anywhere alone. “Right, I’ll remember that. My steam bus will leave in eight hours. We can part ways here,” Castiel offered.
They reached New York Harbor in the afternoon of their three-day trip. The city’s air was different. Heavier, richer. The sea still dominated, but the heavy feeling of water vapor from the engines was a welcome surprise.
Implying that he will not be for long. Dean swallows an outright protest. He can’t insult the Lady, who is also a Queen, but he definitely can’t be ringed here either. “You flatter me, my Lady, but I’m currently under contract with Lady Michaela and would see it through before I consider another court.”
There were people everywhere, most rushing to get to their destinations. He and Sam had previously passed through other ridiculously busy towns; Palo Alto didn’t seem to be nearly as big, more of a residential area from what Dean had seen so far.
"Shame on you; you're in the company of a lady," Metatron admonished, a smile plastered on his face, his hand holding Charis's. "Charis has been wonderful company. Heaven without angels is—rather empty."
He felt the weight of the realization on his shoulders. He’d curled them around his chest reflexively. “I’d hoped… I’d hoped that by offering you Polaris, I’d make you see that—”
In a hundred ways, Dean imagined seeing Castiel again and offered his heart in a thousand ways. But he hadn’t thought there would be a time where Castiel wouldn’t have accepted the offer because he’s moved on.
“Maybe I should’ve left you on the Ark then.” Dean stepped closer to Sam and raised his chin. “You’re trying to dictate my life! Just like Dad!’”
The quiet chirp that comes out of the eagle head surprises Dean. For such a large predator, the griffin has a high-pitched whistling squawk. Admittedly, it might be because the beast is doing what amounts to a whine. The griffin's eyes are blinking at him, pitifully. Dean finds his courage and walks closer.
Dean guffawed, slapping his palm against his thigh, as he reassured Castiel that there was probably nothing to it.
When he claimed a small patch of the bunker for his own needs, he’d planted flowers. He has two kinds for each season: hyacinth and wild lilac for spring, cosmos and foxglove for summer, zinnias and asters for fall, and the sunflowers to bring cheerfulness just because. They’re for the bees, so they’d have a place for nectar and visit. So Castiel could watch them dance.
Michael stared at Dean, unwavering, and if Dean had any sense at all, he would have stepped back and dropped eye contact because Michael was intimidating, despite being stuck in a teenager's body. Well, at least Dean now knew where Cas got his stare from. "News that would explain why Raphael has left his post near the Cage?" Michael asked.
In the morning, Dean cursed at the tape and chucked it in the bin after he rewound it to listen to what he had done. The entire tape was just a recopy of the first Led Zeppelin album after
A sound of clapping broke the united front and Dean noted Castiel’s grimace as Lucifer, decked in the most casual attire of all the angels gathered, appeared behind Michael.  “So this is what you do right after kicking me out the Gates? I swear it beats cursing blackberries every year during the autumn equinox.”
“You and Jack, you’re the closest thing I have to a family here in court. I’m asking you to come because…” Dean pleads, trailing off not knowing what else to say. His fingers brush the feathers lightly. “You got to trust me, Cas.”
, "Rejoice (Greetings, Hail), o favored one! The Lord is with you. Be not afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you are with child and will bear a son and you shall call him Jesus."
Amiel turned his attention to Castiel. As predicted, the angel did not recognize the almost brand new soul that had been bestowed unto Cas when Metatron had stripped his grace. And the vessel certainly held none of Jimmy Novak anymore. "A hunter? I'd expected you to stick with the Winchesters, Master Tran." There was a hint of disapproval in his voice. Other hunters were unknown, but the Winchesters, at least, were archangel vessels.
Sam grimaces. Castiel waits on the possibility of the rare event that Sam agrees with Dean on the length of his hair. Predictably, the younger man just shakes his head. “It can wait. But you’re closer to unkept than ruggedly shaggy.” He takes an elastic and scrunches the fistful in a short ponytail, which solves his problem.
the nestling through the bushes." Cas cocks his head to the side, which is surprisingly bird-like. In retrospect, Dean should have noticed the similarities between Cas and his 'pet.' The head-tilt alone was such a giveaway. "The witch and I have crossed paths before. She knew how to evade me effectively."
