"The setting your title, I don't know."
“Steve.”
Steve woke at six in the morning. Last night Tony had tossed and turned in his sleep, jabbing him in the ribs until he finally woke up and held him in his arms. He kissed Tony’s temple. He went to the gym. None of the equipment could handle his strength or posed a challenge to him. He did several hundred pull up, push up, and sit-ups. Steve showered in the guest bedroom so he wouldn’t wake up Tony. When he got out Tony was in the kitchen.
“You wouldn’t want to find out if you liked him?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked at him unsure for a moment, before following after him.
“Fucking hell Steve, how d-did you get s-so good at thisss”
First to the kitchen was Nat, who was then shortly followed by Clint, then Bruce and eventually Thor.
The second he heard that Tony was in love with him, Steve melted. Hearing those words warmed his heart and put the biggest grin on his face. He put his hand out, brushing against Tony’s jawline, cupped the side of his head and pulled him into a deep, passionate kiss. Steve laid back down more and Tony moved back on to his lap, with only his jeans and a thin sheet between them. He placed his hands on the pillow either side of Steve’s head, arms bent at a right angle.
“Are you sure Stark? Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer me to keep doing
“Now I know your name, can I get your number?” Tony smirked.
Steve was so embarrassed and felt so bad about what he had done. He often forgot his own strength but this was the one time he really needed to focus on it and he let himself get distracted. His face quickly turned a bright strawberry colour and he closed his eyes, ashamed. Tony could feel him getting softer in his hand as arousal was replaced with guilt.
Steve let out a small laugh and they both made their way to the Quinjet.
“Fuck me harder, Rogers” Tony whispered in to the blondes ear.
“Tony, oh my god, are you ok? Am I hurting you?” Steve looked terrified. He had tried so hard to keep his strength under control but must’ve still been too hard.
Tony looked at Steve for a moment, thinking of what to say to everything he just confessed. He could see the real pain on Steve’s face and in his eyes which were lined with tears. Tony had never seen Steve, Captain America, so vulnerable and hurt.
Tony was confused.
————————————————
“Fuckkk. Steve I swear if you keep that up I’m going to cum at any moment” Tony whined as he felt the tip of his cock repeatedly hit the back of Steve’s throat.
Steve pulled the sheet out from between them and gave Tony another kiss, they both very much enjoyed the complete physical contact of their bodies. Steve sat up so that he had access to Tony’s hole, the brunette's legs bent either side of him. Steve took a moment to admire the man in front of him. He couldn’t believe that Tony Stark was naked in his bed begging him for sex. He placed his hand on the arc reactor and slowly grazed his fingers down Tony’s torso. He paused to draw circles around his belly button and then continued down, stopping at the base of Tony’s erect cock. Tony moaned louder and louder as the hand moved further down his body, his cock aching for Steve’s touch.
“You have to prep me first Steve. And you should probably use some lube too” Tony really didn’t want to wait any longer to have Steve inside of him but even he didn’t want the pain of no-prep dry sex.
“I’ve never been more ready, Cap.”
That was enough to send Tony over the edge into what felt like another world. Thick white liquid poured on to his chest and abdomen as he cried out Steve’s name. His hole convulsed around Steve, causing amazing sensations throughout the blonde’s whole body. The sight of Tony orgasming and the sound of him moaning his name aroused Steve even more. He was right on edge and a few more strokes would do it. Before he got there, however, Tony managed to regain some consciousness. He grabbed a chunk of Steve hair and pulled him up from his neck so they were face to face.
Once Tony was fully in the room, Steve gently closed the door behind them and they both made their way to his large king size bed. Steve laid down on top of his duvet sheet - since the supur solider serum he runs very hot so only has a sheet over him at night - and waited for Tony to join him. Tony strode towards the bed but then realised he didn’t actually know where he would be in this. He didn’t want to cross the line and get on the bed next to Steve but he also didn’t want to just be stood awkwardly near it. He ended up taking the chair from Steve’s desk and placing it next to the bed. Steve looked at him oddly.
almost there😳
“That’s not true either.” Tony once again brought attention to the magazine.
Steve smiled and sat back up between Tony’s legs. He lined himself up and pressed his tip lightly against the brunette's entrance. He looked up and they both smiled at each other.
“I know whether I like someone the second I see them.”
“Oh fuckkk, Tonyyy- ohhh” Steve groaned, on a loop of about 5 times.
Piper whined and wrapped her tiny hand around his finger, squeezing it.
“No,” said Jarvis.
“Why did they take you?”
“It does.”
“TONY!!”
“Do what you have to, Steve."
"That's difficult to tell, sir. You gave him the liquid form of the knock out gas meant for Dr. Banner. It could be hours or possibly days."
Tony took a seat in the green armchair across from Peggy.
“Mmm, no.”
Steve was curled up in the fetal position shaking in pain. A thin trail of blood leaked from between his legs.
Whatever it was approaching fast. Steve raised his shield. A giant bear with glowing green eyes jumped from the woods, pinning him. He jammed his shield into the beast’s mauling jaws; his strength forced the creature onto its haunches, long enough for him to roll out from beneath it. Natasha and Clint were preoccupied with two smaller bears. Their weapons seemed to have no effect.
"Shower," said Tony, pushing Steve away.
A beta woman came into the room to take Rune.
“I want you to calm her down,” said Lena.
Steve shook his head.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Steve Rogers,” he said. She seemed nice. Her brown hair was tied into a messy bun. She had intelligent brown eyes.
"It isn't," insisted Piper, becoming agitated.
"Yes, I'll take you to his room now."
“So who’s home?” There was a house not far off. Less than a mile away with its lights on.
“Piper?”
He sighed heavily. “You won’t be home.”
"It wasn't foolish." He ran his fingers up and down Steve's arm.
“Have Jarvis remind you."
*****
"We can't go back to the penthouse," said Steve. It would probably be best for Piper to adjust in an environment with which she was already familiar, but the press would be relentless once they discovered she'd been found. Their frenzy wouldn't be conducive to healing.
“You couldn’t save the president with the suit. How are we going to save Steve and Pepper with nothing?”
Steve did as told.
"Not interested," he said. Again his gaze went to Steve he fully intended on being there to kiss him at midnight.
Tony followed Fury to a white door. He let himself in. The first thing that hit him was the scent of an omega in preheat. Its purity was ruined by a tint of worry. Then he caught a look at the full image. Tall, blonde hair, and blue eyes.
“Why not?”
“Do I look to be in a gaming mood?” said Thor.
“That’s alright."
Tony nodded. He picked up the omega. In the distance, they could see Thor and Loki.
“Are you alright? Your heart rate has accelerated,” said Jarvis.
The hours ticked by steadily as they worked through the subjects. Lena's problems were difficult and managed to stump her several times. But Piper refused to ask for help. She didn't want to ask Lena. As much as she hated admitting it, Lena was a good teacher that managed to challenge her.
“He didn’t just-
“I think so.”
“We have to go,” he said.
"We all have our bad days." Tony smiled.
"You're likely the head of some psychiatric unit at some well-known hospital. Because of doctor-patient confidentiality, you won't be able to report on me, at least not in name. But even if you blank out my name, it would easy enough to put together who I am. It will be real career booster,” said Piper.
“You stink of sex and sweat. Spend less time looking at me and more on bathing,” said Steve.
After an hour, Steve felt up to moving. Jarvis took them to the penthouse.
"Never got around to cleaning it," said Tony.
Steve sunk further into the bunk, trying to escape the alpha's anger.
“Because it shows weakness.”
Her hair was cut in uneven lengths. He struggled to find anything good to say about it.
Pepper called Happy.
He got to his feet, steadying against the counter.
They went into the living room. Steve was sitting on the couch running his hands over his stomach.
In a little less than two weeks, Steve had lost twenty-five pounds. He’s terrified that 6’4, 240 pound super soldier would wear down to nothing.
“Boss, we’re home,” said Happy.
“How could you sign anything with me reading over it first?!” said Pepper.
*****
“I can’t, sir,” said Steve. He couldn’t put his baby at risk. His only duty was to his unborn pup. Something both sides of him agreed on.
“There was no reason for them to be.”
Steve would miss the view. More than anything, he'd miss Tony. It had to be the hormones. Steve followed the garage.
“Tony.”
“Nicht gut. Ich habe erst gestern angefangen.”
“I’ll be right over.”
“What?”
“Bet you put Robin Hood in his place,” said Tony.
They talked the entire drive, neither growing bored of what the other had to say. Tony pulled into the entrance of S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve groaned when he saw Kate.
“You could say that she married one of your Howling Commandos,” said Antoine.
"I've gotten a lot closer to it since I've been with you. The arthritis in my hands has gotten better."
“Like, I said Tony it was perfect."
"I can’t say I know the exact science behind, but those were the results of my tests,” he said.
Papa went to pick her. She backed away. “I can walk.”
"See anything?"
“And what would the reasoning be?”
Winter pointed to her neck. She tensed as fingers touched the metal band strapped around her neck. Her first urge was to rip it off.
“What are you thinking?” asked Steve.
“That would be quiet a feat,” said Daddy.
“Hello, I’m doctor Jemma Simmons. I’ll be your doctor today,” she said.
The recent attack on the president and the end of the Mandarin was the main story. It was followed by the arrest of the vice president. The replacement would be Joe Biden. The feed cut off and changed to the cooking channel.
“I don’t see why not,” said Steve. He was just happy the pups were willing to eat something he made. Steve gave them each a bowl. Having a full stomach would help them go back to sleep. After eating two large bowls each, the kids started nodding off.
“While we’re gone, where?” asked Steve.
“Sure,” said Tony.
The pup smiled up at him. He threw away the diaper and went into the living room.
Knowing the little girl, she'd probably get more fun out of convincing all of them to join her in the playground. Nat wandered almost invisibly through the crowd.
"Steve it's, Nat.”
“I won’t hurt you,” he said.
He caught the man in a chokehold. Smith flailed against him. It took nearly a minute for him to pass out. Winter complete the assignment here. His usual tactics wouldn’t work here. They wanted Smith to disappear. Winter readied the room. Lining it with plastic. There could be no trace of him here. The room was it would be simple to end now. He was curious to why. Why he was sent here. Ever since the pup’s arrival, he questioned, not aloud though. His mission was the one thing he thought would be unaffected by her. But here he was lingering. This was dangerous. It was so uncomplicated before, yet he didn’t wish for it to change. He only had to keep himself in line.
"I was was in the mood."
Tony hung up.
He nodded.
He sipped his coffee, having finished his assigned task. It was peaceful. He could easily imagine many mornings like this. Tony placed a plate with two large omelets on it.
"Ready come out?"
“I don’t like these questions.”
"Here." He pressed the cash into the man's palm.
“I’m going to shower,” Steve said.
“Are you two an item?” asked Clint.
“The doctor?” asked Piper.
"You're healthy for a man of your age, but your blood pressure is concerning. It seems to be solely caused by stress. You'll have to watch that."
“I will.”
Distress leaked through his bond with Steve. It knocked the air out of his lungs. He only ever felt this when Steve was verging on a panic attack. Shit, he wasn’t there to help his mate through this. He should have been there in the first place and now he was placing an unnecessary burden on his mate and their unborn pup.
Steve hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. His arousal was brought to a sudden halt. He wanted to disappear.
He started explaining it to her in Italian. The change in langue kept her interest.
“Yes.”
“I’ll take care of them. That should be enough a diversion to buy the two of you sometimes,” said Clint.
"You may take a seat, Piper."
She rolled up her window and left. The building’s lobby was empty. He went to the elevator. Steve went elevator and hit the button for the penthouse. The elevator didn’t budge.
“The power you’ve been blessed with.”
“And you’ll be in the first row on the big day,” he said.
“I can’t here.”
“Good, choice.”
“I have nowhere else to be,” said Tony lightly.
“When did you come out of it?” asked Natasha.
Steve stretched out in his seat.
“Get some sleep, Tony."
"You don't get to do that," said Tony.
Steve yawned, stretching out a kink in his neck. He looked back at his painting. The rough image was of Piper sitting on Tony’s shoulders working on the car. A freeze-frame moment of perfection that only lasted a few seconds. He needed to paint more moments like this.
Tony stopped himself when she raised an elegant eyebrow, daring him to challenge her. When he lost his mother, Aunt Peggy became the only person he was willing to share the more intimate details of his life with. She let him live with her weeks after his parents' death.
“And on your Papa’s side?” asked Rune.
"Shh, go back to sleep."
He changed and joined Steve. Steve sat by the fire warm light flickered over him. Tony froze when the omega sent a gentle smile in his direction. He tensed when At Last started playing:
Tony leaned forward, kissing his neck. He moaned, tilting his head back, giving the alpha better accesses, blushing as at the sounds he was making.
“I don’t know how. I wouldn't want to step on your feet,” said Steve.
“Steve, you fell asleep on our last call."
Steve turned a deep shade of red.
And just like that, the alpha snapped out of feral state. Steve laid on his uninjured side. She numbed the area. Tony held his hand the entire time, running his fingers through his hair.
“The whole building knows. For a spy agency rumors spread remarkably fast,” said Barny.
He smiled through the embarrassing compliment.
“Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places,” said Banner.
August 4, 2012
"He's never had an issue while defrosting until now. I will be reporting this!"
“It’s my job!" No matter how much he wanted to leave Rumlow to whatever problem he’d gotten into. But there was more at stake than just a rescue mission. Those weapons had to be destroyed before they could cause any harm.
“He was sent to get dissolve a weapons store and retrieve an agent. An explosive device was triggered. He saved Natasha and the agent before himself,” said Fury.
“I broke something.”
Thor and Tony nodded.
Harley chased behind him, which didn’t help. The creeping anxiety became too much. He tore off his coat hoping it would release the constraining sensation engulfing his chest. He toppled to his knees landing on the snow. Tony tried focusing on the feel frigid snow under his hands. Any sensation was better than the nervous rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins. It seemed to be working.
“How’d you get them?” asked Rune.
“Perfect." He closed his eyes.
“She’s perfect, Tony.”
“Okay.”
“Wow, possessive alpha tone never heard that from you. I could comment on Pep’s legs and you wouldn’t give the same response,” said Rhodes.
Tony ran to his car taking out the newest update of Mark 5. He raced through the sky landing outside the burnt wreckage of the daycare. Every part of him wanted to crumble, but he needed to be strong there was too much depending on him. Steve sat in the middle of it with his head in his hands. Tony kneeled in front of his mate taking Steve’s hand.
“Am I interrupting?” he asked.
Piper woke up about the same time Steve finished his appointment. She rushed over to him.
“Don’t get too hopeful Tony you’re not avoiding our conversation. I can wait a few more hours,” said Steve.
Steve took a keyfob from his pocket with a single red button on it. He gave it to George.
“Would you go back for the jackass like him?” asked Rory.
“Okay.”
"Giving them nothing will only make them more desperate to find something."
The image of tall blonde muscular alpha appeared. The alpha’s jaw was square and bearded. His deep blue eyes were almost electric with life.
"I'm sorry, Steve. I built these suit to protect you, but I've failed," said Tony.
"Will you wait that long to tell him?" asked Natasha.
“Driving back now,” said Tony.
“I will."
“Get that and more with Stark”, said Clint.
“Just curious,” said Steve. He doubted medication was the answer, but it was worth asking.
Tony hadn’t even thought of his bachelor party. “Mmm, not sure."
“Don’t get your panties in a bunch, we’re only assisting,” said Rumlow.
"Who's your favorite Avenger, Mr. Captain America?”
"It's different this high-intensity focus on all of us," said Steve.
“Eat.”
"No reason to put a label on it yet. Take it day by day until we figure out what we want to call it," said Tony.
“No miss,” he said.
Tony sighed. He didn’t want to admit just how right Rhodes was.
"Fine, you can come in."
It clicked. The kid set off the flashbang made a run for it. Now that he was safe Tony could focus.
“Do you want me to turn on the light?” asked Tony.
“Where else would I go?”
“I want to make dinner tonight,” said Steve.
She smiled brightly. This was more than mimicking behavior. Piper was teasing him. No, he was overthinking this.
Steve accepted the bowl. Tony went to leave, but Steve held his hand. "Stay."
“Have you given up? It’s alright if you did.” He wouldn’t have blamed her. It was hard to keep up hope here. But they had each other. Piper had hardly spoken of escape since Sir had taken over.
The alpha simply shrugged. "I'll give you the tour. Well, start with the penthouse, that's where we will be spending most of our time."
“Tony?” The alpha's hand was in his pocket.
“Says the man who is two years away from being a hundred,” said Tony.
“Fine,” said Steve.
“Winter?”
Tony instantly relaxed. His back was stiff from sleeping in the chair. “How long was I out?”
Tony ran his fingers nervously through his hair.
“Sure.”
He ignored the father, knowing the man would not resume the fight and risk harming his daughter.
“Why do you call it that? We just play chess.”
“That doesn’t make it right! I should have had a choice. What if I didn’t want to fight? We should be able to choose. Not be forced into doing something we don’t want to do.”
“Jarvis get me a suite right now!” He jumped from catwalk trying to get near a suit. A suit opened for him, he vaulted for it, but it shot away before could reach it. He crashed onto the floor below him. “Come on!”
"Sure."
Jarvis scanned over her. “She’s perfectly healthy."
“That doesn’t make me feel any better,” said Piper.
Pierce forced a complacent expression.
“Papa.” She reached her hands out to him.
“I thought you wanted to wash your hands of them,” said Fury.
"I learn fast. I also speak Italian and Russian fluently,” Piper explained.
“Restoring a car together will help her,” said Tony.
“You’re not normally in a cage, are you?”
Fury nodded. That was the simplest request made of him all day.
“What this?”
"That came out of nowhere."
“Would you want more?”
March 13, 2016
"Only a friend."
“Goodnight Tony."
“Your personal life is my business. Everything you do could affect my company!” snarled Pepper.
The beta left. Sir moved from behind the desk. He spread a newspaper on the floor, then set a chair on the newspaper. Piper gasped when he yanked her onto the chair by the collar of her straight jacket. She heard the metallic slid of a knife being taken from its sheath.
"Good, what's your name?"
“Piper,” called Daddy.
"I'll keep it, but it doesn't leave the tower. Jarvis do we have the facilities to keep something like that here temporarily?"
"Steve?"
“He should know they are his weapons," said Steve.
He took a breath, not meeting his friend's gaze.
“Easy, Steve, this isn’t meant to come off by force,” said Tony.
How would he explain this? Telling her, he fucked and knotted Steve, her true love in every position wasn’t an option. It would give the old girl a heart attack. Steve was her past and his present, but he couldn’t move any further without telling her. She was the last person he'd want to hurt.  Aunt Peggy was the closest thing he had to family. She earned his respect when he was young. Carter was the only one who was successful at keeping his father under control, not even his mother could do that, no matter how she tried. The car pulled up to her home.
“Sure.” They leaned into each other again. Steve even dared to purr, again; relaxing further when Tony responded in kind.
“If I could get out of this I would,” said Tony.
“She normally doesn’t do that,” said Tony.
“No, it’s realistic,” she said.
“Do you know where we are?”
“What are you doing?”
“Maybe,” said Piper.
Tony went to his lab. There was a temptation to look into the Mandarin data, but he couldn't. Not when Steve was so upset. Tony spent the rest of the day working on Mark 42. His attention wasn't all there. He likely wouldn't see his mate for the rest of the day. It was a bitter realization. He wanted comfort that came with being near his husband. Late at night, he heard motion upstairs. He rushed up the stairs. Steve sat at the kitchen island picking apart the cinnamon buns. Steve growled, flashing his teeth when he came near.
“Before we start can you put my hair up?” asked Piper.
Bruce found Steve and Tony in the kitchen; both were nursing a drink.
“They may be shouting at each other now, but they really love each other. If I can see it, then it’s gotta be something real.” She pulled away from his shoulder. “I don’t like it when you cry,” said Rune, wiping her cheeks.
“Here.” Winter spoke again.
“I wish I could believe that,” said Daddy.
Steve hung up on him.
December 21, 2012
“Stark, congratulations on your new bond and pup. Let it grow strong powerful person like its parents,” said Thor.
Winter tensed but didn't push her away. Never had a person without ulterior motives willingly come this close to him. And there was that gentle fluttering sound again. Her little hand reached for his metal hand. He moved it away. It could hurt her. He'd already put her through enough. She whined and tried reaching for it again.
The girl’s blue eyes were focused on her desktop. Lena smiled.
“Be gentle,” said Steve.
He moved down the bed.
“It wasn’t my place,” she said.
"Is this what you were trying to make?" asked Rune.
“Thanks, but I don’t think I could even if I wanted to."
“200 feet, sir.”
Lena hung up, shaking her head. She was working with incompetent fools! After a few minutes of wallowing in frustration, Lena returned to her bedroom. She quietly started packing her bag, stopping when Helmut stirred.
“This isn’t a normal interview, Tony. There’s a lot that needs to be covered,” said Pepper.
“All clear,” said Steve.
Bert smiled at them.
“I do not know the details of his mission, so I’m unsure of his current status,” she said.
“Are you sure?”
“Contact doesn’t always mean sex. There are other things we can do," said Tony.
“Look at those dimples,” said Tony, caressing Steve’s cheek.
She grabbed a pen from her room, taking it apart so she could better use it. It was a simple task. There was a soft clunk as the door unlocked. It was child's play compared to what she'd been tasked with doing before. She climbed into their large bed, tucking herself in between her parents. It was so warm. Papa and Daddy's scents were so calming.
“Why didn’t you hire someone?” asked Steve.
He knew how much her parents wanted her. They were desperate to find her. He couldn't tell her. The words were there, but he lacked the capacity to voice them. He doubted her actions would diminish their feelings for the pup. If, by some miracle, her parents discovered her, it was unlikely they'd even come upon the footage of the attack.
“Winter,” she whispered.
"What if I mess up your face?"
"I'm running my hands slowly down, easing them down your chest. Working my fingers gently into your muscles. They move lower and lower the ache disappearing with each touch." Tony shuttered as Steve's soft breath, hitched into a gasp.
She went to the basement, taking out several tubs of legos with blue, gray, and white coloration from the closet. Among the blocks were also penguins, polar bears, and seals. She'd also taken out Elsa's castle set.
"How many people heard?"
“If you aren’t going to talk to me at least to talk to someone else. I’m calling Dr. Turner tomorrow."
“He fought in WWII. And saw a lot of horrible things. On top of all that, he lost his best friend."
Bruce looked up from his work when he heard marching footsteps heading in his direction. A man dressed in green strode down the hall surrounded by a troop of men. Oddly the stranger looked at ease with his circumstances. This must Loki. As their eyes met it set off a twinge of pain.
Even unconscious the omega's hands rested protectively over his stomach. He pried them away. For a moment, he lingered on the omega's swollen stomach. His mask filtered out the heavy panicked scent of the omega, which allowed his focus not to be so easily swayed by something as trivial as scent. He raised the man's shirt and took the serum dose from his bag. He took out the self-injecting syringe locked in place on the omega's stomach. A fleeting whine left the target as the needle pierced his womb.
“Taylor Callahan.”
“Don’t let losing to him get to you. Soon enough he’ll be waddling along like every omega,” said a trainee.
"For what?"
“Helmut please.”
She did as told, letting Lena take her vitals. Piper couldn’t stop herself from crying. She missed Uncle Bruce. He made going to the doctor fun. And Papa would be sitting in the corner chair if she got scared. She couldn’t cry! Piper sniffled, wiping away her tears. She was silent as the examine continued.
"Was I right?" No response. "Can you at least give me a nod or shake of your head? Something." Nothing.
“They’re fish in a barrel down there,” said Steve.
He ripped open the box. The cover the greeted him was:
"Jarvis put down the thermostat."
“Maybe a little.”
"I'll be in the living room if you need anything," he said.
But the alpha was clutching his left his arm, gasping. And then he was falling, backward… crashing into the cluttered work table behind him.
“What was she calling about?”
“Call me when it’s done”, said Tony.
"How do you know?" Had his scent grown so strong that a beta could pick up on it?
It was amazing how much Rune had come out of his shell, not say that he didn’t have bad days. He started several fires with lighting. It had Tony and Piper working on a fire extinguishing network. Steve piled a large stack of pancakes on each other their plates. Their appetites were inhuman. It would be best to broach the subject once the food coma set in. The pups ate a total of three stacks of pancakes.
“No worry. Are you ready to go?” he asked.
Steve slipped through the door, hurrying to the bathroom.
“Seems fine to me. I was the same way at her age. Any kid my age seemed like an unintelligible idiot. And I turned out fine,” said Tony.
"I want a blood sample from the child. And I want an MRI of her brain. For that, she'll have to be semi-conscious."
*****
“Twisting my words around.”
She added the finishing touches. The only thing that was needed was the explosive elements to be added and connected. She was only allowed to make the blueprints for that part.
“Having you here is not something to motivate, Tony Stark. It’s umm it’s actually more embarrassing than that. You’re here as my uh-
Steve pulled Pepper in front of him, dropping her down next to Tony. Tony reached out toward him.
“Now?” said Steve.
A few minutes ago he was fine.
“Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity,” he said.
"His appearance is likely due to the surrogate who incubated him. But, I assure you, he has the desired abilities," said Lena.
She jumped out of the crib, nearly going to knees at the uncomfortable jolt the motion sent through her. There was still soreness and bruises. They normally didn't last more than a few hours.
“Are you alright to stand?” Steve asked, all soft concern like he was talking to a child, and now Tony wasn’t
“Be quiet,” Natasha ordered, half turning to talk to Bruce over the phone, “and get upstairs to Bruce’s lab. He says there’s a low chance of anything serious happening, but it’d help to get it out of your system.”
Clint nodded once and his face vanished. “Hang tight!”
That was the hard part. Officially, Steve had required some more eyes for a stakeout on Stark Manor but had ruled that out as a possibility for the assignment, which would hopefully be enough to buy them a day or two.
“Can I ask what’s going on?” Tony blurted, but before he’d finished his sentence Archer-Guy (what, they still hadn’t been introduced) was pointing an arrow at his face.
Tony did as he was told, sticking mostly to what he’d need for the outer shell of the arm for the time being. When he finished, Bucky disappeared again and Tony thought, for a moment, that he was really just going to be left alone in the house. But his captor (was that even the right word anymore?) returned after only a few seconds.
There were some unintelligible sounds from inside and then Bucky opened the door a crack. “Whaddaya—oh, Steve, hey, get in here.”
The soldier was standing in parade rest in front of the doors, because he did stuff like that, even in the Tower. Both men barely glanced at each other before glancing pointedly away and moving to opposite sides of the small space. Tony fidgeted with the hem of his ragged T-shirt, greasy and stained and full of holes, and glanced at Steve, the perfect super soldier, fresh and shiny and standing tall in parade rest again. The tension was suffocating.
give it back.”
“Yeah. And then, Pepper, but she doesn’t...she couldn’t handle it, the superhero thing, you know? Which I get, obviously, but. I haven’t really had anyone, since Pepper.”
“Shut up, all of you,” Natasha snapped. “This is still a mission, yes, but it’s also something brand new we’ve never encountered before. We should take Stark—we can figure out what we want to do from there. Bucky, do you think you can cancel his magick?”
Then he was landing on the other side, Clint was whistling their signal, and they were sneaking down the street as quickly as possible without drawing suspicion. On the corner, they’d all hitched their Registration horses in case they were needed, and the four nearly identical bay horses watched impassively. Captain, with the small, white, vaguely star-shaped mark high on his forehead, lowered his head in greeting to Steve.
Steve opened his mouth to protest, then stopped. God. Tony was still building on the floor, nonchalantly fitting panels together in the vaguest shape of an arm. What kind of Omega—what kind of
The lights lowered a lot that time, and Tony was able to look around without being blinded. He blamed sitting in a dark elevator.
“That’ll be it for now,” Bucky said gruffly, starting to push Tony back.
, no one else, and he had one of your arrows, Clint, he had one of your arrows and he
Nat hesitated. “Steve, the hospital-”
“What the
Guess who got hit directly in the mouth with a big ol' dose of life and got their 4-day hiatus turned into two weeks of radio silence? This one!! So sorry about that, and also sorry because this chapter is wrap-up and shorter than the rest, but this is the first chance I had to be back at a computer and I wanted to get it out to y'all.
Steve watched for a second and cleared his throat. “What, ah, what are you doing?”
“But why don’t they? Something doesn’t add up. There’s no way Howard Stark doesn’t know about this,” Steve muttered. “Maybe...maybe we should hold off on the report for another day?”
The man—Buck?—cursed under his breath and shifted his grip slightly. They’d reached the horses. Too quickly and seamlessly to even take advantage of the moment, Tony was being manhandled into Steve’s arms instead and pushed onto the back of one of the horses.
“I can watch him and cancel the magick if he tries anything, and he’s not wrong,” Bucky shrugged, “so I figured, why not?”
, woah, balance was definitely not a thing his brain was doing. He managed to open the cabinet and pull down some aspirin and sleeping pills–at least, he thought that’s what they were, his hands were shaking and his head was pounding, and he definitely didn’t feel like trying to read the labels.
“I don’t think-”
Tony did laugh, that time, sharp and manic and bitter. “Sorry to break it to ya, Capsicle, but dear old dad’s been dead for years.”
“You can build me an arm, or try anyway,” Bucky said, “I mean, you said it yourself—you can’t do anything with me here, so I have nothin’ to worry about.”
God. There Steve went again, being all endearing and poetic and supportive and shit.
Steve laid his hand on Tony’s knee, and the reaction was instantaneous. The other man’s body stilled, and some of the tension bled from his muscles. Steve opened his mouth to say something, closed it again. He couldn’t trust himself not to shatter this.
Wow, the next chapter!! Yay!! In my defense, the doc for this fic was created June 20th of 2018, so I feel like this chapter was written relatively quickly by comparison.
She hates this.
“And he gets it! It’s a miracle! Now, you know where you’re gonna go? Anywhere. Anywhere at all that isn’t Bruce’s lab, Tony’s floor or his workshop.”
you,” Tony sing-songed from the other room. “And I feel like you should know there’s usually not this much fighting between kidnappers either. Also, Steve promised me questions. And answers.”
“How did you even get in here, I had the shop on lockdown, Jarvis I swear to God-”
, Steve,” the woman warned, eyeing the street behind them
“Tony,” the voice that said his name was soft, and worried, and gentle, and he held onto it because he was never Tony, he was Mr. Stark and
“Are you,” Tony repeated, slowly, “
And if Steve starts pulling her in for hugs more often than before, or finding every excuse to touch her throughout the day, well, Tony can’t complain.
Steve stared. This Omega, this rich privileged boy, had not only taken notice of some poor random runner, but he’d
They’d solved the mystery of whether Tony really was Welthari for Clint, but now they were faced with a few tiny problems. For one, they couldn’t nullify Tony’s magick forever—Bucky simply didn’t have the stamina to hold it for more than an hour or so. For another, they were no closer to knowing what to do with the Omega. And they were fighting over those two problems while Tony sat in another room—one he couldn’t get out of without going past the four of them.
The lights flickered once, twice.
Tony does, slowly. She does this, sometimes—gets too wrapped up in her own head with double meanings and worst-case scenarios. It’s awful.
Nothing.
She kneels to look Tony in the eyes, carefully not touching her. Tony stares at the bedsheets and Steve stares at Tony, searching. Cataloging her curled up body and fists tucked under her chin, childlike.
“Rogers,” he muttered by way of greeting.
“Yeah,” Bucky muttered, “I think I can take care of him.”
“You’re perfect,” Tony murmured. “Isn’t....isn’t that the point?”
Minutes ticked by. After maybe ten, Tony spoke up. “Hey Jarvis, how’s it going out there?”
“Jesus Fucking Christ,” Bucky whispered. “You...you know that’s not...
His mouth tasted like defeat he didn’t deserve to feel.
, so he paid attention. Tony had stopped working, but still hadn’t looked up at them.
America himself.
Tony’s jaws tightened, his expression shuttering closed. He gave Steve a quick, sharp nod and staggered to his feet. Natasha had her body between the elevator doors now, forcing them open, and Tony pushed past her. All three of the Avengers called out after the genius, but by the time Steve ducked out of the elevator Tony was gone.
Then Tony screamed.
(also, something wonky is going on with the end notes I think? I dunno if it shows on y'all's side but they're weird for me and I've tried and failed to fix it, so sorry about that)
“Yeah, I think I’m Welthari,” Tony smirked.
Finally Bucky shoved him towards the door with a muttered, “Get outta here, punk,” and Clint and Natasha ducked out of the house.
Someone—he couldn’t remember whose voice it was—said, “Buck, you can give it back now.”
He stayed there for another moment and turned toward home.
“We’ll answer what questions we can once we get inside,” Steve added to Tony as he slid from his horse’s back. Before Tony could even think about running, though, he was being awkwardly pulled to the ground himself.
“But that shouldn’t-”
Tony looked at the runner for a long moment. He was sweating like he’d just run across the city (he had), and he looked half dead on his feet. His magick wouldn’t hold much longer.
, and he bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, but he still couldn’t make himself move.
“I’m sorry!” Tony interrupted them, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—
, but he was never just
The runner started, glanced down and away. “P-pardon, sir?”
, the roar of water in his ears, blood pounding through his veins, a thousand screamed insults, the terse words of the man he’d loved most. And those were the worst, worse than the yelling, because yelling meant anger and anger made people do things they wouldn’t, and quiet, steady words meant they were true, and real.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t sure how long he stayed there, curled in on himself, but eventually the lights flickered back on, but dimmer than before. Tony pushed his head down, into his knees, gathered himself up tighter, because light meant he could be
“Hey, Steve, Tony, what’s up?” came a voice, too light and too loud.
“Don’t need any of that,” Bucky rumbled, “I may only have one arm, but I can more than take you.”
Tony winced inwardly. Running wasn’t a
“Duh, punk,” Bucky rolled his eyes. “That’s why I’m not. Let ‘im be, he kinda grows on you.”
“Fine,” Tony conceded at last, “but at least
They were nearly to the horses when the man holding Tony grunted, “I can’t hold both of ‘em for much longer, Steve.”
One of his screens nearby changed to display a WebMD page on concussions.
“Attempted?” Steve actually stopped for a second before he kept moving. “Jarvis, what happened?”
“Hey boy,” Steve murmured, running a hand over Cap’s neck before he swung into the saddle.
A terrible mix of disgust and fear rose like bile in his throat. He hit the opposite corner and curled in on himself, staring at his feet. Everything was so
“Fine, fine, maybe I have a teeny, tiny, mild little concussion. I’ll take some meds and sleep, it’ll be better by tomorrow.”
“Jarvis!” Tony screamed, “
Nat eyed Tony warily for a moment, then nodded sharply at Bucky. With another almost invisible motion, the Omega’s magick was released. Steve sighed. They weren’t going to get anywhere with Tony around, alternatively snarking and threatening them depending on his mood.
“Get back inside,” Bucky snarled (Tony was beginning to think he was more animal than human, he growled and snapped and hissed more than he spoke).
And then something
And then, because the universe absolutely hated Tony Stark, the elevator released an earsplitting screech and shuddered to a halt.
, right?”
After a long moment, Tony managed to tap his fingers once against his legs, a feat that felt like moving mountains. But then a warm hand settled on his knee, a tan blur in the corner of his vision, and it was nice and good and gentle and he stopped trembling, a little, maybe. Tony focused on that, one warm, heavy weight tethering him to the earth, to reality. A not-so-distant voice in the back of his head told him he was being ridiculous and stupid and
“Okay, Tony, you don’t have to say anything or move, okay? I just need you to tap your fingers once for yes, twice for no. Can you do that for me?”
“Same as everyone else,” Tony replied, “‘bout seven years. I was eleven.”
Okay, the beginning of this chapter is a bit heavy, I accidentally-on-purpose gave Tony my touch starvation and panic attacks, now with extra hyperventilating and flashbacks! Yay! On that note, I apologize if this makes anybody seem OOC (but Nat is not a robot, dammit). Oh, and I'm kinda (really, really) self conscious about this chapter, so. I always either hate or love my work, with no in between. I've also updated some tags, so probably double check that.
“How many runs have you done today?”
The super-soldier finally turned his head just enough to look down at Tony. “Come on, Stark, do you think I’m stupid? I know what all of 'your' projects really are.”
“This is the weirdest kidnapping I’ve ever been part of,” Tony muttered.
Natasha sprang, but Bucky was faster, canceling Tony’s magick with a savage twist of his wrist. Tony collapsed in on himself with a choked-off cry, gasping.
, you, you get out,
Tony reached for his magick to prove the other man wrong, but found himself falling into the endless pit that had taken up residence in his chest. Before he knew what was happening he was bent over, the fabric of his shirt fisted in his hands.
Nat, to her credit, didn’t react except to grip Widow’s reins too tightly and suck in a shocked gulp of air. Clint made a choking sound and nearly fell, and Steve couldn’t blame him. Canceled magick was like the ground suddenly dropping out from under you, and no one was immune to a bit of panic at the feeling.
Steve wheeled Captain around so he was walking beside the man. “Surely whatever it is can wait.”
“Fuck that, I’m fine, a little blood loss is nothing, I just need to sleep and get these
Steve looked confused. “I--yes? This, this morning, or last night, I’m not sure.”
Anyway. Thoughts? This was absolutely a blast to write, and seeing all the support for it has been amazing! I'm almost sad it's over, but I do have another project in the works I need to get moving on.
“Where else?” Clint asked, aiming for flippant but not quite making it.
She has approximately ten seconds to pull herself together. Steve doesn’t kid around when Tony is involved.
Steve puttered around the house uselessly for another hour or so, straightening up things that were already straightened and faking productivity until he thought he could go back to check on Tony and Bucky. Clint’s house was as quiet as ever and completely normal-looking from outside. Steve frowned a little and knocked on the door.
Clint’s face melted back into its usual grin and he nodded. “Hang tight!”
“No,” Steve said, the word coming out a command. Nat visibly bristled, but didn’t argue. “Bruce, now. Clint, help me.”
“Easy, Cap. Just about any problem, Jarvis can fix it in a second, right J?”
“Why’d you ask that runner if he was okay?”
Nat shot Steve a look and stalked into the other room. “Fine. What do you want to know?”
“I saw him,” Steve explained, “the mark—he’s an alloykinetic.”
she can’t answer, she doesn’t know, she doesn’t know-
“Oh,” Tony breathed. “Then, can we just, just stay like this? For, for a little while?”
. He was beginning to think Tony Stark was not at all what Steve had been anticipating.
“It’s
So, I hope y'all enjoyed, and if you did, comments and kudos would be GREATLY appreciated. Seriously. I check my inbox and this fic at least once a day. Please validate me so I am less likely to hurl myself directly into the sun.
about him. Enough to say something. And he was making Bucky an arm just
“Jesus,” Steve hissed, “how much experience with kidnapping does he have?”
Comments and kudos keep me writing!
, please don’t-”
dammit, what the hell were you two doing-”
“What we
“Um,” Tony said, glancing up at Steve, and that was answer enough. She really had no idea.
Steve hummed. “Perfect is relative. I was made to be the vision of a bunch of men in the 40s. Look at me now, dating a gal—do you think they wanted a queer Captain America? And trust me, I’m smart enough to get by, but the things you can do, Tones? They’re amazing. And I’m impulsive, stubborn, close-minded at times. I’m strong, darling, but that’s about it. I’m nowhere near perfect.”
“Tony? Are you o-”
The Omega was surrounded by shining metal and other bits and pieces Steve couldn’t hope to identify, and despite his magick was mostly working with his hands. He only seemed to be using the kinesis for convenience, not necessity.
The elevator doors parted a little, and someone’s fingers wedged into the crack to pry them open.
Steve nodded and left Cap in his friends’ capable hands. Bucky did the same and they snuck back to the Manor, creeping around the outside of the fence this time to lower the chance of being spotted. As Steve had hoped, Tony was exactly where he’d left him, crouched over the arrow’s remains. He seemed to be poking at them with a small stick. Steve couldn’t worry about that—they had a job to do.
They were most of the way through when Tony made a sound. It was something of a breathy grunt, so quiet that for a second Steve thought he’d imagined it. Then the engineer’s eyes opened, fluttered, and looked down at himself. It seemed to take a few seconds for Tony to process what he was seeing, and then he was angry.
“You just did, but sure, shoot,” Tony said, not looking up.
Steve made a noise. It was the sort of noise that was one part laugh, two parts disbelief, four parts disgust, and 100% condescending.
Steve told her everything, skimming over the part about Peggy as quickly as he could and skimping on the details of what was said, exactly.
“We have slightly bigger problems than what happened in the elevator-”
“I suppose some introductions are in order?” he asked. “Everyone, this is Tony Stark. Tony, this is Natasha, Clint, and, uh,” Steve hesitated, “James?”
And Tony
“Are you alright to stand?” Steve asked Tony, remembering too well all the times his panic attacks left him with legs to weak to support him at first.
Surprisingly, Bucky didn’t say anything else about Tony’s little stunt, didn’t take away the privileges he’d been given. He just carried in the package full of Tony’s materials and set it down with a heavy thud. Tony winced again. The runner had carried that
Tony’s heart practically leapt out of his chest, and his already panicked mind went haywire. Dim emergency lights flicked on, but they barely did anything for the darkness. Steve stopped speaking for a moment, caught off guard, and then started in again.
The servant stopped and turned toward Steve, hesitating for a moment. “No, sir,” he said at last, in a voice that was oddly familiar, “this is too important.”
It’s the exact wrong thing to say. Tony is only human, only a soft and fragile thing outside the suit. She’s got none of Steve’s strength or Nat’s training, none of Clint’s marksmanship or Thor’s magic. She’s smart, sure, but there’s nothing special about some math and a bit of metalworking. She’s only human, only weak, only only
“Listen, Cap, you got a problem, you can say it to my face.”
“Tony,” Steve tried, “Bruce said.”
Moving to Steve’s house hadn’t accomplished very much. They’d talked in circles for an agonizingly long time before finally agreeing to wait it out and see what the world looked like in the morning. Then they’d make an official decision by noon. Almost as soon as a decision had been made Steve was left alone, with Nat going back to her assignment and Clint vanishing to God only knew where.
Tony went back to working beside them. Steve made some noise about moving to his and Bucky’s house, letting Clint and Nat have their place back. Bucky responded with something along the lines of agreement and canceled Tony’s magick as a precaution. In the other house, Tony and Bucky settled down again and Steve left to file his report with the Registration.
“Tony,” Bucky growled, “you don’t give orders around here.”
, Tony wanted to say yes, he wanted to at least nod, but his mind was still screaming that he couldn’t move or everything would come crashing down and as long as he stayed still it would be fine.
Bucky stared at him. “You just offered to build me an arm. After we
“I dunno, it’s...it’s fun, most of the time, and...it’ll help you, y’know? I just...I like building things, okay?” Tony snapped, defensive.
Bucky dragged a chair over and leaned forward to watch as Tony started digging through his materials. Tony rolled his eyes and got to work.
Steve grit his teeth and made it down the last few stairs in two steps. The workshop windows were still blacked out, but the door opened without any codes at all. For a moment, Steve stood in the barely-lit workshop, trying to find Tony among the tables and strewn bits of projects or scrap metal or both. Then one of the piles moved, and Steve’s eyes adjusted to recognize DUM-E.
“Bucky. Bucky’s fine.” Tony turned to get his first proper look at Bucky and
and he didn’t know what to do.
“Steve…” Nat murmured.
He opened his eyes and carefully maneuvered himself into a sort-of seating position, putting him at eye-level with a certain super-soldier’s chest.
But of course, it stopped at the gym, just a few floors below his destination, and Tony knew who would be there before the doors even started to open. None other than Mr. Steven Grant Rogers, Captain
from people this whole time? Who do you think could make all of this?” He could hear his voice getting louder and louder with every word as he gestured around them, but he couldn’t seem to stop.
“But-”
Truth be told, Steve thought they all resembled their horses in one way or another, though whether that was a strange twist of fate or the product of years of working with them, he couldn’t say.
A disapproving beep sounded around the room. Tony ignored it and ducked into the workshop bathroom and
“Let me try again. Are you okay with me just doing this?” Steve asks, infinitely gentle.
A curse snaked up his throat, but Steve bit it back with a frustrated growl.
“Please, please, please, no,
“Did anyone ever...talk to you about it?”
There was silence at that. Even Natasha couldn’t fully conceal her surprise. The horses shifted restlessly under the tension, and as one the four of them jolted from their private thoughts.
and Iron Man and Anthony and
Still, Tony did not want to lose any body parts, so he poked at the lightly-smoking remains with a stick to see what happened. Unfortunately—and anticlimactically—nothing blew up or melted the stick or did anything remotely interesting.
“I know, I know, I have to go and apologize, where do you think he went? Workshop?” Steve pushed a hand through his hair.
him.”
Clint and Nat ran into the workshop behind him, and Steve, half-crouched over Tony, whirled to meet them.
job, per se—it was reserved for enmeve like Pietro, who could run fast enough to deliver messages across the city in seconds. But Welthari didn’t have an infinite supply of magick, and Tony had heard more than one horror story of runners simply collapsing, even dying, in the middle of a delivery. Though Registration runners would probably have better treatment, better pay.
Tony scowled. “Why can’t I finish a sentence around here?”
hover over him until he wakes up, and immediately tell him his aunt died and have it all work out just peachy, did you?”
Bucky growled lowly and flicked his wrist. Steve, familiar with Bucky’s moods, braced himself, but there was nothing that could properly prepare him for the sickening feeling of his magick vanishing. It felt like someone had torn out his insides and left him empty—he was grasping for something that simply didn’t exist anymore.
Tony was still a little shocked he was allowed to do anything at all, but when Bucky vanished for a moment and returned with paper which he pushed at Tony. “Whatever you think you’ll need, write it down. Just know I’m not stupid, I’ll know if you try to sneak bombs in here.”
“I meant you don’t have to be fine all the time, and you can’t always control when you need help. Okay? I’ll always be here if you need me. No one’s perfect.”
Tony can’t answer. Fuck. It’s a trick question, it’s a trap, it is good but it’s also not good enough, what does she say? If she says yes Steve might not come any closer, if she says no Steve might back off completely, might leave her, fuck fuck
“Look, I know you have no reason to trust me, but….can I try?” Tony asked, “You’d be able to cancel my magick anyway if I did something you didn’t like. And, trust me, if I wanted out of here I could’ve gotten out by now, magick or not.”
And because of that, every time he closed his eyes he could see Tony’s face, too pale in the dim light, could see him flinching backwards, cracking his head into the wall.
“Nat, Clint, come with me. We won’t get anywhere like this. Buck, I need you to stay here and-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, you might actually die if you don’t-”
Clint did a mostly decent impression of someone who was very convinced with Steve’s logic, then started extracting himself from their nest. Steve followed, and they began sneaking back off of the estate. It wasn’t too hard, save for the place closer to the gates where all the trees and flowers and bushes just stopped, leaving about fifty feet of open space to the fence. Clint ducked behind the last bit of cover and stared towards the house, pupils shrinking down to tiny pinpricks of black—a sure sign he was using his magick.
A pair of boots landed with a dull thud on the grass. “Tony. We aren’t going to hurt you.”
Fuck. Mistake.
“Oh,” Tony said. What else was she supposed to say, after Steve did things like that?
Tony was about ready to kick some dirt over the burnt grass, put the arrow back together, and go inside. He was vulnerable in the yard.
them? Bucky had been learning to get by without his arm, sure, but a prosthetic might, just maybe, help him. And Tony Stark was just...giving it to him.
“Well, duh. But where do you even think I got a concussion from, huh J?”
inside of him. Something vanished, dropped out from under his feet, dissipated. Tony froze, instinctively reaching for his magick to try and form some sort of weapon from the metal scattered around him.
“Howard,” Steve said simply.
out of my ‘shop, God.”
Steve left.
“Subtle,” Tony muttered. “And I do not have a concussion.”
“Tony,” Steve said. “You and Pepper broke up over a year ago.”
“Jarvis?” Steve asked, glancing upwards.
The engineer’s body tightened, coiled like a spring. His knuckles turned white as he gripped his legs, like his hands might move of their own accord. A second shaky breath sounded like thunder in the silence, and then his fingers tapped once against his leg. He instantly tightened up again, grinding his forehead into his knees, but it felt like a victory all the same.
. Omegas are made to submit. They aren’t made to be powerful.”
Steve swallowed. “Would you...you would be able to break that protocol, if, if Tony was going to…” he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.
He really tried to pretend the genius wasn’t there, and Tony seemed content to do the same. Until the elevator stopped.
Clint added, “You
Tony snuggled in a little closer against Steve’s chest and finally, finally slept.
Did you know that I am physically incapable of not writing endings as "two paragraphs encompassing the next forty years of story and a three-word-long ending line?"
And just like that everything slammed roughly back into place and Tony staggered backwards, narrowly avoiding falling on his ass. Jesus Christ. It felt like someone had shoved a massive rock straight into his ribcage with no care at all for what got broken or nudged out of place.
Tony was lying facedown on the floor, his left hand, side, and thigh cut open from shards of broken glass next to him. Steve reached down and took the engineer’s limp wrist in his fingers, feeling for a pulse. It was the weakest flutter of a heartbeat, but there.
Tony? What happened out there?” Clint demanded, abandoning his post so he could face Steve.
“No, no,
Tony bit his lip, so Steve jumped to answer. “Not yet, but we will be.”
for her.
“I-I...yes, sir?”
Jesus.
Curiosity forced Tony’s chin up, to a square panel of light in the ceiling. Clint Barton’s face appeared.
Because running was a job, and it was the lesser of quite a few evils, but in the end it was still dangerous and demanding and awful.
is wrong with you,” Steve whispers vehemently. “You’re only human.”
“You’re taking that the wrong way, aren’t you,” Steve sighed. It wasn’t a question, so Tony didn’t answer.
As the last words were directed upwards, clearly meant for Jarvis, Tony bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to draw blood and fought the urge to summon the armor and ask Rogers if he thought
In the end, he settled for the latter, but all his desperate kicking and clawing did nothing to stop the two strong arms from dragging him to the fence and hauling him over it into the waiting arms (arm?) of someone else. The person only had one arm wrapped around Tony’s body, but they were surprisingly strong.
He’d realized, then, of course, but it was too late. Jarvis was speaking, trying to calm Tony down, and it must’ve happened before because the AI hardly seemed fazed. All Steve could do was repeat Tony’s name while Jarvis tried to tell him he was in New York, in the Tower, and he was safe.
“We need to start doing something soon or all of this is going to turn into one massive waste of time,” Natasha warned. Clearly the others had started up again without Steve.
She locked onto Winter’s scent. Something stopped her in her tracks. Another scent. Honey and vanilla.
“I don’t want students watching this,” said Tony.
"He needs to break that feral state willingly. All he needs is a reason and we've provided him with that."
"Why! What could possibly be gained from bringing me here!"
He barely managed to catch Killian’s fist. Steve clamped down on it. The bone crunched under his touch. The alpha released his hold his neck. Steve struck the alpha. He tried to reach Pepper only to be grabbed. Killian threw him into a cell a glass cell. The pulled a syringe from his pocket. The orange liquid inside it glowed.
“So, what’s the plan?” asked Tony.
“I’m sorry” she repeated.
“Hungry,”
“You will,” said Pepper.
Steve breathed out the words his alpha seemed unwilling to say, but which neither of them could refuse to consider, “or if whoever it was decides to try again.”
“Nine, Sir.”
The pup repeated it over and over again. He patted her head. She was herself again. It was good to see. But was it good for her to be this person? They'd want that blue light show again. There'd be no limit to what they'd do to get it.
“Cargo shorts never looked so good,” said Tony.
He rolled his shoulders, enjoying the familiar comforting weight of his armor.
“Fine.”
If they got out it wouldn't take long to freeze to death in the subzero weather. Winter and her were like Papa. Rune seemed just as durable. Papa lasted seventy years. If they lasted trapped in the ice that long her parents would likely be dead. Maybe that was better than she wouldn’t have to face their rejection. They’d probably have several pups better than her by then. Piper shook away the bad thoughts. She shouldn’t be wasting brainpower on them.
"I believe so," she said.
“And the baby.”
“Maybe you should lay off the candy.”
“Please come back!” he cried, clutching the alpha's chest. "Please, I need you. You're going to be farther. I can't do this alone."
Steve kissed her on the forehead, then watched as Piper found a quiet corner and opened a book, completely ignoring the other children. She’d be fine. Piper spotted him staring and waved to him. Steve left for S.H.I.E.L.D. At the elevator, a secret compartment slid open to reveal a retinal scanner. He leaned over.
"You can enjoy yourself. Stark doesn't mind having you around. Call when you're on your way back. Enjoy breakfast," she said.
“That’s not necessary. The project needs my supervision,” she said.
“That’s stupid,” said Piper
“Deal.”
*****
“A few days at the most. We are going to the plane from here,” she said. The elevator doors opened on the garage floor.
"I hate this. He's my friend. You're making me betray him," said Edith.
“Will I be invited to the wedding?” asked Thor.
“So what did you really bring me here for?” asked Natasha, knowing Piper preferred getting straight to the point.
“Give him a break, Pep. He’s just off his heat,” said Tony.
“Sir is here.”
"Have you ate?"
“I don’t have a sitter. I’ll to bring Piper with me.”
“Tony?”
“You didn’t have a heart attack, Mr. Stark.”
“I’m fine, sweetie,” Steve
"You don't have to throw yourself headfirst into it. Take it in at your own pace. Progress is progress no matter how little it may seem."
Barny sighed. The loss weighed heavily on Steve. To everyone else, Bucky's death was decades ago, but for Steve, it was an open wound. He wasn’t going to press on. His patient needed time to mourn.
Rhodes waited for Tony in the kitchen. He was surprised when moments later, Tony came out again. He always gave Tony thirty minutes before any of their plans, knowing he would go through at least three different outfits before finally settling on one.
“She’s asleep. Jarvis is watching her. He’s the best baby monitor around.”
"Too bad it didn't last."
“It’s fine Fury covered it, even if he didn’t, I’d be happy to pay for it after the week we spent together,” said Tony. A deep red blush spread across Steve's face reaching his ears. Tony chuckled.
Tony watched from the bar as Steve struggled to find a comfortable position. He gulped down his drink and went to join him. He put Steve’s feet on his lap. The omega moaned when he rubbed his feet. Even though Steve looked more relaxed, the omega seemed uncomfortable.
“That’s not fair,” she said. He’d never made her promise anything before. Winter asked so little of her, but she didn’t want to give him that. “Okay, Winter.”
"You can't blame yourself for this I won't let."
“Let me put some shorts on,” he said.
“I strongly suggest against that,” began Dr. Havaldar.
“I’m not leaving,” he said.
“Don’t go. It won’t help,” said Rune to the betas.
Steve made sure Piper was securely tucked into his jacket. He grit his teeth as they pushed through the cold to their waiting jet. Once inside, Steve shook off the snow and quickly took a seat. Tony's armor fell away from him and moved to the corner, standing guard as an empty shell.
"When the last time you've gotten a good night's sleep?" asked Rhodes.
Tony brought Steve into his arms, pushing his husband’s nose into his neck. Steve breathed in his scent, and his muscles unwound. Tony had caught him just before another panic attack could happen. His alpha knew him so well. It felt like he was failing in some omega duty. He pulled away from him.
"How did manage it?" asked Thor.
“My help?”
“Yes, Jarvis.”
“Perfect,” said Steve.
Steve was willing to give it a try if it meant avoiding hours of morning sickness.  Jarvis filled the bath. He shed his clothes and wrapped a towel around his waist.
"STEVE!"
“All the more reason for me to use it while I can,” said Steve.
The pup fell asleep faster than normal. She squirmed in his arms whining. He rested her on his chest and she nuzzled against him, purring. Her fingers tightly grasped the fabric of his shirt. The sound of his heartbeat seemed to calm her and he curled his other arm over her back. He yawned as his eyes grew heavy. He could finally sleep. All thanks to the pup sleeping in his arms.
Steve nodded before running in that direction. He reached engine three. There it became apparent how much damage had been done to the ship.
“Yeah, we will need her input,” said Tony. He settled into the chair in the corner of the room.
“Close your mouth, Agent Hill,” he said.
"Yes, but I’d want to keep you to myself for a bit longer. But I'll happily share with the pup," said Tony, his hands sneaking over Steve's stomach. He nuzzled against Steve’s neck, deeply breathing in the omega’s scent. Steve purred. “Wait, pups? As in plural."
It sunk into her side. The pup yelped, and pulled it out. Her wound instantly sealed with a glimmer of blue light. She took the blade in her untrained hand, charging fearlessly back to the fray.
No one else could be Iron Man, because Iron Man was sitting right there. Tony shifted uncomfortably, then sprung to his feet. “You know what,” he said quickly, before Steve could ask any more questions, “I think I need a shower after all that fun. Care to join me?”
"Promise not to get mad at me if that doesn't work out?"
Tony wriggled against Steve, clearly impatient. "Right," he said, with the sort of tone that suggested he didn't quite
Steve was not above employing a little more to his tactics, and he tipped his head down to murmur into Tony's ear, sharing some of his dirtier thoughts aloud. Tony tensed around the time Steve was spinning a particularly elaborate fantasy related to just
Steve rolls onto his side and curls in toward Tony. This time, Tony is still wide awake, flushed and breathing hard, staring at the canopy.
“The hot dog vendor.” Tony paused. “Although the kid could probably use some money, too. Maybe we should start The Avengers’ Young Superhero Scholarship Fund.”
"Thanks." Steve padded off toward the kitchen, the tinny sound of the game on his phone starting up again once he was out of sight. When he came back a few moments later - coffee and phone clutched awkwardly together in one hand, donut in the other - he commented, "The weather looks pretty bad. I don't think we're going anywhere fast."
Steve sighed, feeling a spike of guilt of his own. It was true, Tony
Steve's gaze flickers to the side as Zemo approaches, unreadable through the hood.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “It’s okay. You had no way of knowing that I wasn’t
Tony raises his eyebrows, waiting.
Tony raised his eyebrows. "Did your homework pretty well?"
Steve leans over and presses his lips to Tony's jaw. "But I mean to come back."
Tony is so preoccupied with his work that he doesn't notice Steve returning until the smell of food - the strong aroma of garlic and tang of tomatoes - hits his nostrils. He turns and sees Steve at one of the emptier workbenches, setting out Italian takeout, frankly monstrous pieces of lasagna and a heap of breadsticks. He's even brought a bottle of sparkling water in lieu of wine, the glasses he pours looking adorably out of place with disposable containers and flatware.
Steve thanked the barista and hitched the cardboard sleeve a little bit further up the cup before he turned to the coffee shop's door. There waited his co-worker (and friend) Natasha Romanoff - also known as codename: Black Widow - with her gloved hands wrapped around a large cup of tea. She quirked a smile at Steve and let him hold the door open for her on the way out; a concession, maybe, since she wouldn't allow him to buy her drink.
Steve shook his head. “You don’t understand, Ms. Stark. Iron Man.
Prudently, Steve chose not to say any of this to Tony. He had a feeling that Tony didn’t need to be told, and one important facet to their relationship thus far had been learning the right place and time for certain conversations. The last few days had been long and stressful. There were a lot of important things that Captain America and Iron Man needed to talk about.
Steve followed Tony down to the garage once the rest of the team had dispersed, and settled himself down at one of Tony's workbenches to wait while Tony got out of the armor.
style adventure was exciting, no matter how much he had grown up since those magazines first came out.
Banner looks chagrined. "One and the same, I'm afraid."
to keep your shirt on, that’s fine, but you don’t have to hide. If you don’t want to.”
“Maybe,” Jim says slowly, “they were carrying it on the U-boat because it’s dangerous.”
Tony pressed closer, insinuating a thigh between Steve's legs while he worked at the front of Steve's uniform, ripping open fastenings and tugging down zippers. Steve shrugged out of the heavy outer layer of his uniform, and reluctantly pulled away from the kiss to tug the undershirt over his head.
Anthony stares back at them, confusion in his expression as he looks first at Steve, then past him at Tony. "You mean ..."
Natasha raised an eyebrow.
Tony gasped when one of Steve's hands slipped down the back of his jeans and squeezed Tony's ass. "In the kitchen?" he wondered, glancing around.
For all the fact that Stark probably also shares the similarity of being a genius with Tony, he seems to need a moment to digest all their sudden hospitality. "Yes," he says at last, using Steve's assistance in swinging his legs off the table. "A shower sounds fabulous, I'm sticky in places ... well."
"The gunman's word against Stane's, unless we can find solid physical evidence that he ordered the hit," Natasha pointed out. "Either way, it's probably a good idea that Stark is there to take over."
Steve gripped the edge of the counter, watching as Tony stroked him, as Tony’s mouth closed around the head of Steve’s cock. Watching was almost too much, and Steve moaned as Tony took him deeper, too affected to avoid making noise at the sight and feel of it. He would just have to hope that everyone else had gone to bed, or would be too tired to investigate; there were probably worse ways their teammates could find out, but Steve was having a hard time thinking of any. (He was probably deluding himself, imagining that any of them didn’t know, in the first place. He could readily think of at least one who most certainly did.)
"You're the one who came all this way," Tony says. "Do you mean to tell me you don't want to fuck as much as possible?"
"Admittedly," Anthony says, "I've never slept with Steve." He looks over at the stasis pods in the corner, something guilty but thankfully brief flickering over his face. "Not that I haven't thought about it."
Steve’s face was intent with concentration, almost innocent as they jacked each other, hips rocking together to help them better chase their mutual pleasure. He wasn’t noisy about it, either; when he came just a few minutes later, the only noise he made was a soft moan that was mostly muffled by the way he pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder.
He took a deep breath, blew it out in a soft sigh. Tugged off the glove from his right hand, in spite of the cold, and stuck it out. “Private Steve Rogers,” he said.
"Handsome soldiers, distractions," Tony says vaguely.
"You are a mystery to me," Steve blurted. He didn't even have the excuse of alcohol for that one.
"1918," Steve answered.
“I didn’t mean to scare you,” Tony said. He paused, then added, a hint of reluctance in his voice, “But I was prepared for that to be the case.”
"Good." Tony grabbed the hem of Steve's shirt and began to pull it up.
Steve raises his eyebrows, clear disapproval in his expression. They both know the war would hardly end just because Hitler said so; the machinations of Hydra behind the scenes would simply take the center stage.
It was maybe inevitable, then, that one of Tony’s personalities would someday cross paths with the Captain; he just hadn’t thought that it would happen to be both at once.
"An orgasm."
Tony looks away. "Don't be. You've got bigger things to worry about." He pauses, brows furrowing. "What are you going to do here, anyway? You stick out like a sore thumb - Hydra's going to have noticed you're here, especially if they're watching me."
of Frank Finlay - that part of things was not so surprising - had explained to Steve that Tony Edwards was merely an alias, and that the adventures chronicled in
Steve shook his head. “No,” he said, regretfully. “He must have been a little after my time.”
Steve frowns and sits up, pulling the covers to his waist. "Yeah."
“There was, uh ... that time ... on the quinjet ...” Steve said.
Steve settled between Tony’s parted knees, his hands coming to rest on Tony’s thighs, and, well, they just happened to be of a height this way. Tony reached right past the waistband of Steve’s sweats, because he’d be damned if he was going to be the only one with a somewhat inappropriate erection right now, only to find that, actually, Steve was on the same page and probably had been for a few moments now.
Steve pushes his way through the curtain that separates the front of the bar from the rest. In the dimly lit back room, a few tables are occupied: one, with old men playing high stakes cards, a couple more sporting couples in various stages of amorous intent. Steve takes a moment out to study them; two of the women and maybe one of the men are probably whores. None of them are the person he is looking for.
Steve pulled a face, unsure whether he should take that strictly as a compliment, but he decided to see it as a positive thing; it wasn't as if he
“Tony,” he tried again, louder this time.
After Coulson had been seen out and the dishes washed, Tony followed Steve to bed, hoping he hadn't misinterpreted the situation in assuming he was welcome to do so. Steve had been stiff and strange since earlier, his disapproval - or at least apprehension - for their plan clear in the lines of his face. He really was, well and truly, bad at keeping his feelings hidden.
The woman’s mouth screwed up into a wry twist. “I’m afraid so.”
Steve smiles. "Sure, Tony."
“Ludwig was fascinated by operas, fairy tales, by flights of fancy. Before he died about sixty years ago, everyone thought he was mad. He had gotten reclusive, obsessed with building extravagant castles. The ruins we were at were only a short distance from Neuschwanstein. I went inside once ... they opened it to the public after he died. There’s a giant painting of St. George and the Dragon,” Natasha said. “And that’s where things get interesting.”
.” He had, admittedly, just assumed that the company was a supplier of equipment to Iron Man.
Steve ran the thought through his head the entire way back to Avengers Tower, while he sat stiffly in his seat and tried not to act conspicuous. If Clint knew, that meant Natasha probably knew, too, since the two of them probably hid less from each other than any two members of the team. Sam was perceptive, and the Hulk was a genius when he let his alter ego Dr. Banner out to play, and Thor might have been behind on human society and culture, but it was likely that any - or all - of them had figured it out by now, as well.
By the time Iron Man found his way back to the conference room where this all started -- walking back through the offices was a lot more difficult than crashing through them on the direct route -- Captain America was delivering a final blow to the back of the downed Krampus' neck. Sparks flew as circuitry malfunctioned, and the entire thing went limp.
Tony couldn’t speak, but this time it wasn’t out of fear but awe. Here was Steve, Captain America, her idol since practically birth, telling her she was amazing. God.
“Peggy’s dead?” Tony asked, his stomach curling in on itself.
“Touch is a human need, Tony,” Steve said gently. “All you had to do was ask.”
God. Yeah, he needed some
“Tony, I wanted to apologize,” Steve began, “I know it isn’t much of an excuse, but I wasn’t--myself, when I said those things, in the elevator. I didn’t mean any of it.”
“I...I drove him off?” Steve asked.
“Steve, what happened in there?” Natasha asked.
Although technically, Steve wasn’t wrong. Tony had been building “Howard Stark’s” projects for years now. His whole life, practically.
Tony’s mouth was still decidedly not functioning, but Steve answered for them both.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve nodded.
"Thanks," said Steve.
“Of?”
“I don’t believe you.”
Piper went down the slide, and, sitting at the edge, she studied him. When she couldn't find any hint of a hidden weapon, she jumped onto the stone bench beside him.
"My friends were hurt because of me!"
(See the end of the chapter for
“I get it no mentioning my time as a playboy until you’ve worked through this,” said Tony.
Tony woke around three in the afternoon. Piper!
“That’s an easy one. Every engineer here aims to replicate it. Igor Pirosky. His work was beyond his time.”
"He's a mini Thor."
“It's meant for easy use. I’m sure you’ll be able to get the hang it,” said Edith.
“He’ll be back. He has to come back,” she whimpered. All she had to do was wait. She huddled down in Winter’s corner, where his scent was strongest. Piper counted down the hours in her head. Two hours ticked by and nobody entered, not even Lena.
"I just need to work it out. Watch her?"
“But Aunt Nat-”
“How soon can you come over?”
"Captain Rogers, knew the risks," said Fury.
“Thank you.”
"One cream and a spoonful of sugar," said Steve.
“I thought they were asleep,” said Pepper.
"No, without what you've made I could have lost you and our child. It may not be one of your Ironman suits, but your tracker saved our family's life. You didn't fail." Tony held him even closer.
“I won’t, it’s important to you”, he reassured.
"Alright, Edith."
“Air out the room, Jarvis.”
“Why are you crying?”
“He’ll never know,” said Tony.
Winter was a knight. Was she a knight as well? She didn't think she was a pawn. They wouldn't have gone through all the trouble they did if she were something that disposable.
Natasha took out a photo of Winter. Paninya quickly glanced away from the image.
“You’re my light, Piper.”
The next day they had their appointment. Steve was a bit jet-lagged, but the excitement being able to know their baby’s gender and see it again woke him up. Edith, Bruce, Steve, and Tony stood in the small homemade medical office. Tony stood next to Steve, holding his hand.
Steve sat on the far end of the couch. He dug his fingers into fabric denying his need to cuddle into his alpha.
Piper tried not to sigh at being called a subject, but that's was she was. She'd feel even more freakish if it were her name were continually being mentioned. Piper leaned against the arm of the couch as she flipped through the pages. She could only piece together a basic idea of what Cho was trying to say. Piper’s knowledge of biology and all related subjects was relatively basic, so she couldn't understand the advanced principles.
"We might as well take care of it now. By the time local authorities get around to it, they will have likely moved on. And when I get home the last thing I want to deal with is Agent Hill or Director Fury nagging me for leaving an assignment early," he said.
"Not as different as you may think. You'll balance each other."
George walked around the room. Large blueprints hung on the walls. The end product was a car with aquatic capabilities. Behind him, Piper worked, but her gaze bore into the back of his head.
“My sweet omega,” whispered Tony. It was so satisfying saying it aloud.
“This isn’t your fault. Sir’s coping mechanisms are far from healthy,” said Jarvis.
Tony eyes opened when he was sure his friend was asleep. He took out his phone and pressed on Steve’s number.
Piper woke. She rubbed her eyes. Winter was pacing the room. Every now and then, his gaze would dart to the door. The motion had her on edge. Winter didn’t pace. His default setting was still. What was agitating him?
"What did you think?" asked Tony.
“Passed on the floor.”
“You aren’t failing as an omega. How does your inner omega feel about leaving Piper?”
*****
He grabbed her mid-charge.
Zola thought so little of his field of study and the possibilities it possessed. Lena preferred Werner Reinhardt’s work on brainwashing, which posited a far less invasive approach. Unfortunately, Werner had been assigned to the alien object team, so Lena had to make do on her own.
"So you admit he's good," said Tony.
“No one will touch him,” said Lena.
“I’ll want daily progress reports on her,” said Pierce.
“Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy,” said Tony.
"Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?”
“Me?”
He didn't want to risk leaving the kid alone."Let's get you back to her," said Tony.
“You could have woken me.”
“Where am I?” he asked.
“This okay?” she asked.
“Nope,” said Barny.
“I’m sorry for everything I said,” he said.
She huffed, turning her back to him. Winter rolled his eyes. He scooped up the pup.
“Great.”
“Would you have rather her ask you?"
“Sounds boring,” said Rune.
“What?”
“Come back to me.”
He pulled up the footage on his watch. The fucking Avengers were making their way through the base. It wouldn't be long until they eliminated his men.
It wasn’t a suggestion or request, but an alpha command. Steve nodded. Their lips met in a gentle kiss. Tony let him set the pace. Steve slowly pushed his tongue into Tony’s mouth. The action was so foreign to him. Soon he became lost in the motion, his arms wrapping around Tony’s neck keeping, him close. The alpha’s hands wandered his form, relaxing him further.
“Thanks,” said Steve.
He pushed down. With every contraction, he bore down. It was a pattern, which made the intolerable pain somehow bearable. Steve lost track of time.
“Is that the only word about me?” asked Banner nervously playing with his hands.
A long moment passes, the silence broken only by the occasional groan of the broken soldiers lying around them.
Steve closes the distance between Anthony and himself, and leans down, brushing his lips against Anthony's in a soft kiss. Tony spends a moment simply watching; there's something sweet about the way Steve handles a lover, and Tony has certainly experienced it himself, but it's another thing entirely to be on the outside looking in, even if he technically isn't
It's like a big game of what ifs. Tony knows Reed would be fascinated. Reed
His thoughts must have shown in his face, because Fury went on, "We also have evidence that under Obadiah Stane's guidance, Stark Industries has been dealing under the table in supplying weapons to terrorists." He paused. "Stane is one of the most powerful men on the planet. Stark Industries is the holder of a lot of United States government contracts. Neither the company nor the government can afford the bad press in this economy. But Howard Stark was able to name his own successor, and he always meant that to be his son. If we can get through to Anthony and convince him to return, then he can take back his father's company and put a stop to what Stane is doing."
Tony laughed, reaching for Steve’s hand. He laced their fingers together, and spent a quiet moment studying Steve’s face in the dim light that spilled between them from the arc reactor. His expression sobered, and he said, “Look, Steve ... I just wanted to let you know ...”
. She's collecting herself pet scientists, and I can imagine all too easily that Stark has fallen into her web."
“Some of you might not believe we're the good guys,” Steve said, “but deep down inside, you all know something's wrong here. Taking down the Squadron isn't only justice. The fate of the entire world is in our hands. Tony had faith in us. Let's put our faith in him.
can be Steve, making love to Tony. That's what I love about ... this. Us."
Tony tugs a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wipes Steve's tears away. "Honey, it's not your fault."
This is everything Steve wanted, even though he should know better. Ever since he found out that Tony would be in Madripoor, his best attempts at professionalism aside, Steve hoped for this.
"Stark is fine," Natasha said. "He's getting a debrief from Coulson. After that debacle, there was no point in keeping up the charade."
Tony laughs at him again. "You're flattering me, Steven."
"It must have been terrible," Steve says.
Steve did sit up then, ignoring the woman’s protests that he should lie back down. Across the small clearing, the Iron Man armor was inert, in pieces, really. Steve’s eyes snapped back to the woman, and he gave her a second look. She was shivering, too, not at all dressed for the weather in a white shirt and pair of drab chinos, a jacket in the same dull shade providing what little warmth it could offer. Complete with the sturdy boots that ran up her calves, and the compass hanging on her belt, it seemed like just the sort of outfit Tony Edwards would ...
With Anthony present at the Baxter Building, and Tony working in his own shop, they reach a breakthrough with Reed by lunch, just as Tony suspected they would. It will take another day or two for them to fabricate and test the technology needed to implement their plan to send Anthony home, but it can be done.
“All in one place,” he said. “Efficient.”
"You scare me when you get domestic," Clint said, and that was that.
Even if Tony is among them.
Tony shrugs, walking up to stand at Steve's side again. "Could be she wanted to sell their DNA, but she wouldn't need to keep them alive for that. On the other hand, well ... speaking hypothetically here as a villain, you could do a lot with the right mind control device and a superhero under your control. Especially one like the Hulk, there."
“I know,” Tony said.
It isn't until a few weeks later, while Steve is taking some downtime after yet another encounter with another Kashmir Vennema (and of
"You can watch," Steve said, with a distinctly mischievous note in his voice as he reached down to touch himself.
Steve's sobs are gradually reduced to quiet shudders, and he finally leans back to sniffle down at Tony. "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry," she says, and opens her mouth to say more, but someone else walks into the kitchen before Peggy has a chance.
"I'm trying on this new thing," Tony said, pouring himself a cup of coffee. "Being a responsible and engaged team leader."
Steve had been doing a great deal of research into the educational system for the sake of his cover - learning about lack of funding for the arts, parent groups calling for schools to revamp school lunches into healthier and more nutritious meals, and some of the lengths that teachers went through to make sure their students had necessary supplies - but he still had difficulty imagining that

"Yeah?"

wheel over to the counter and pull open a drawer. After a moment of rummaging around in the drawer's contents, Dum-E wheeled over to Steve with something clutched in its claw.
Steve laughed, slicking his wet hair back against his head once he had rinsed out all the suds. He guided Tony under the water and helped him to do the same, then Steve molded himself against Tony's back, winding his arms around Tony's waist to hold him close.
When Tony finally opens the door and steps into his cabin, he isn't surprised to find Steve there. Steve rarely goes to his own quarters these days, preferring to bunk with Tony when they can get away with it.
"Be my guest," Tony answers.
. Don't you think I've been asking myself the same things? But we had to know this was a possibility. It was a massive organization, and there's no telling how many minor players were waiting to seize power."
In 1945, to commemorate the end of the war and another important occasion,
"If you need any help with these, by the way, you can just call me," Tony said, patting the top of one of the monitors. "I think they're using me to save on the budget and avoid hiring an IT person."
"It's alright, Steve," Peggy says. She steps aside to allow him to enter. "Is something the matter?"
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world," Tony says, his voice low and a little slurred. "He walks into mine."
chest.
"It might have something to do with the present I planned to have you unwrap on Christmas morning," Steve mumbled.
"Of course," Steve says. He's much better at handling Anthony than Tony is, maybe thanks to years of experience in dealing with Tony himself. "We'd like your help in getting you home, but we understand if you need to take some time to get your bearings."
These days, Peggy was notably more carefree, and was said to be enjoying a casual romance with fellow former Commando, Gabriel Jones. Gabe left his enlistment behind when the war was over, but remained on with the military as a civilian contractor, now acting as a translator and language teacher.
Tony laughed again, his chest loosening as the tight knot of tension inside him began to unfurl. He turned toward Steve and hooked a finger in the front of his uniform, dragging him down for another kiss, more meaningful this time. “So ... did I mention that Cap being my hero included a healthy dose of, ahh, adolescent admiration?”
Steve reaches up and tugs the hood off. He sags with relief when he sees the wry twist of a smile on Tony's lips.
Steve did well not to let his surprise show on his face (at least, he hoped it didn't show). "My undercover assignment is officially over," he said. "Technically, I'm on medical leave."
Tony hesitates at his cabin door, leaning his forehead against the door frame and letting his mind drift from his sore ankle.
"Talking too much," Steve says.
Steve looked thoughtful again, but this time something in his eyes was sharp. “So, taking out the reactor would take out the armor.”
"Good," said Natasha. "It's still a little wooden, but you've got that awkward charm so I think you can sell it without raising any suspicions."
“Alright, I’ll concede: that was in poor taste.” Tony strips off his gloves and tucks them into his tool belt. “What brings you here today, Captain?”
A sleek red car was parked in the other space, while a motorcycle that probably didn't get much use in this weather was propped a few feet further in. It seemed as if much of the house's square footage on the first floor was actually divided into the garage, as the typical parking and storage area sloped upward and expanded into a clean, warm space that could only be described as a workshop.
The handful of pieces that ultimately take up a corner of his lab space are Tony's first priority. The stasis pods were a lucky find, lucky for their inhabitants, at least, after Madripoor's tech failure that evening. Each of the units has a built in power supply, but those didn't make much difference against a complete shutdown of their systems; fortunately, Tony was able to get them up and running again on the way back from Madripoor.
Agent Drew lingers behind to keep Madame Hydra secured, even though she seems down for the count, leaving Steve and Tony alone.

"He hasn't turned," Steve insists. "I would know."
"You had that
“Nah, right now, we’re just gonna be Clint and Steve,” Clint answered. He removed his sunglasses, as if to make that point more obvious, and gave Steve an expectant look.

"My organization has been looking for you, Doctor," Steve says. "We've had you reported missing for a few months now."
Tony gasped when Steve's slick fingers brushed along his cleft, and he brought one of his knees up higher, spreading himself wider when Steve asked whether it was okay. Steve took his time in circling Tony's hole before he began to press a single digit inside of him. Tony responded sweetly, moaning and relaxing instead of tensing against the intrusion, and he took a second finger without any difficulty aside from his own impatience.
"When Hydra cropped up in Madripoor," she says, "we started to worry that he might be a target. But he appears to be there of his own free will, and as far as we can tell, Hydra is leaving him alone."
Steve rolls up the papers and stashes them in his bag for later. A part of him feels guilty, but Tony is the one who left Steve here, unsupervised. Resentment at having been left without a word - again - is enough to allow Steve to tamp down on that guilt and continue going through the apartment. It seems sloppy of Tony, in fact, to lead Steve to a place where Steve might find sensitive information. Tony is too smart for that, so Steve doesn't expect to find much.
Tony looked down at the mug in his hands. "No."
promise that I’ll get over it.”
"Then if awkward sexual tension isn't the case," Natasha said, turning to look at him fully, "maybe you should consider being a little nicer to him. Steve isn't a bad guy."
"It's all ... this," Steve said. He raised a hand and gestured around the room, before winding an arm around Tony's shoulders. "I don't like undercover work, but this part has been nice. Having a place, pretending to be normal."
The art festival was being sponsored by a local art supply shop whose address was listed on the flyer. Steve hadn't had much time for art since waking from the ice, so he decided to drop by the place and pick up a few things. It seemed, at any rate, a good excuse for getting out and seeing the town. He hadn't seen Natasha all day since they finished settling into 'their' new place, though she promised to be back in time for dinner.
"I don't know." Pepper shrugs. "I was the only one stateside with him. I knew there was something ... different. The way he was acting ..."
"No, it's ..." Tony shakes his head, reaching up to cup Steve's cheek in his hand. "It's been a long time. Howard was long dead

also means talking about Tony, and talking about Tony always leads into a conversation Steve knows by rote and dreads well in advance.
of Tony.)
with this."
Ah, well - Tony couldn’t say he was surprised by that question, and at least it was one that he didn’t mind answering truthfully. “The same time I was held captive, when I got this -” He tapped at the arc reactor. “- I created the first suit to escape.”
"The cure," Sternberg gasps. "Tony Stark will know what to do."
"Even though you're here working, Doctor," Steve tries, "I have reason to believe your safety may be at risk. Have you had any suspicious encounters, random visitors?"
“We just risked our lives
"What do you think she wanted with them?"
The castle was little more than a ruin, actually, and Steve figured that explained the logic for keeping something valuable inside: who would believe an important artifact would be specially stashed inside some ruins?
Tony shakes his head, laughing again as he turns back to his work. "I suppose after all these years, I should've known that mutually kicking Batroc the Leaper's ass would turn into a form of foreplay for us."
Steve couldn't help gawking a little at the workbenches and computers, the bits and pieces of projects. As he stepped further inside, a tall piece of machinery that stood about the height of a man and looked like a swiveling arm on a rolling base, swung around and pointed a claw at him.
Steve looks up at Tony again, swallowing hard. "I'm not," he says. "I just - I'm sorry I can't do anything to help."
"The twenty-first century didn't
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony, bearing him back down to the pillows. "Why do you think that?" he said. "For all you know, I could be the one who's nervous, talking to distract myself."
Tony sighs. "Steve, I might be flagrant with my regard for the law and social mores, but you're Captain America. Even if I weren't worried about my reputation, I have some regard for yours."
Steve moved further into the room and cleared his throat lightly as he awkwardly leaned against one of the student tables across from Tony, conscious not to put too much of his weight on it. "I don't mean to intrude, I just ... wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Less like I got shot and more like I've had someone digging their fingers around in my internal organs," Steve complained.
"You didn't have to," Anthony says. He plops onto a stool next to Tony's, eagerly unwrapping his sandwich. "Besides, I can tell you what
Steve reached up and grabbed a handful of tissues from a box on the end table to clean them both off, righting their clothes before he settled down again. Steve nudged Tony around until they lay with Tony on his back, Steve on his side next to Tony, half-draped over him.
"Right." Tony looked politely disinterested, but he gave it a moment before saying, "Well, I've gotta get to class. If I don't see you again before the end of the day, have a merry Christmas."
, but this is ... amazing, actually, the intensity of it.
So why, Tony thinks, does he have to feel so
Filling the glass with water and committing to chug it all down was a good enough excuse for a pause in a conversation that had always been destined to be awkward. Steve finished it all and began to refill it before he offered, “For you and for everyone else.”
Tony laughed softly in the space between them, the tension broken. Steve shifted around to brace himself on one hand so that he could begin to return the favor, unfastening Tony's jeans. They both wriggled their clothes down just enough to be out of the way, impatience taking precedence over the desire to see each other naked, and Steve settled in close, pressing himself along the length of Tony's body.
"He was hoping you might go to the Baxter Building for some scans," Tony says. "I'm going to stay here to coordinate on our end, so if Steve isn't busy today ..."
Tony decides he needs to come up with something better to call his alternate, as awkward as that is.
“It feels like a dream,” Steve said. “To think that just this morning we were boarding the quinjet — but were we?”
Reed comes over to help set up the equipment once it's finished fabricating, and when they've completed the last test necessary to be confident that Anthony will, indeed, get back to his universe in one piece, they assemble in the workshop to arrange the transport. Tony feels almost sentimental over the prospect of saying goodbye.
Steve takes Tony's hand, and twines their fingers together. "I'm happy with just one house," he says, "but otherwise I like the sound of that."
"I heard someone was asking after me." Tony turns to face Steve, reaching lazily for his cigarette.
"My name
Natasha gave a soft, oddly delicate, snort of a laugh. "If it makes you feel any better, statistically speaking, you were probably due for it."
"I will," Steve promised, but he let Tony's legs down to the bed and got his arms under Tony's back instead. Steve dragged Tony into his lap as he took up an intensely slow, easy pace, sliding in and lingering there, letting Tony's weight take him deep inside.
Steve glances down at himself and flushes, remembering that he's naked. He reaches for Tony's robe, discarded across the bed, and angrily shrugs into it. It's a bit snug on Steve in the shoulders, but it's a far sight better than being naked in front of a fellow agent.
Tony strokes his hand over Steve's hair. "I'm sorry."
"Thank you, Tony." Steve hesitates for a moment, then he pushes up on his toes - shorter than Tony, with Tony in the armor - and presses their lips together.
Clint slouched into the couch just a little. "Too late now."
Tony was distracted, distracted by getting his hand around Steve’s cock, distracted by the way Steve’s big, strong hand was jerking him in return, so he gave a confused and undignified flail when the room started to turn on end, until he realized Steve was shifting them around, and Tony ended up planted on his back against the couch cushions.
Steve watches the smoke begin to rise in the glow of the match before Namor snuffs out the flame. He gives the captain a few moments to enjoy his tobacco in silence before asking, "What can you tell me? About Tony."
Steve smiled; it was small and crooked, and very handsome on his face. “Okay, Tony.”
Steve waited to hear their reactions.
"Happy last day of semester." Tony bit into the doughnut, looking intent on inhaling it all at once.
Steve pauses, brows furrowing. "What?"
"So we got the same sandwich order," Tony says, pulling a face.
“No.” Steve ducks his head sheepishly. “I got excited and wanted to show it to you, first.”
adage has rarely seemed more true, until Steve finds himself one of the last men standing, with bodies littered all around, and his gun solidly out of ammunition. Agent Drew is lying in a crumpled heap near Madame Hydra's feet, her ruse likely discovered; Steve hopes that she's still breathing, but right now he has bigger problems.
“Tony ...” Steve begins, but Tony is already reaching for the sphere.
them."
never caught it?"
Hours pass while Tony runs tests on the pods and sorts through the rest of Kashmir Vennema's stash. Much of the tech proves to be scrap, at least to someone like Tony. He has most of it packed up for SHIELD to either use or dispose of, by the time the sound of a keypad beeping sounds outside the lab.
Steve laughs, his breath a warm gust of air over Tony's skin. "Remind me tomorrow."
"Coulson probably should have told you," was what Natasha finally said, her lips pressed in a disapproving line. "Instead of feeding you to the wolves."
"All of that did remind me how good you are in a fight," Steve says cautiously. "You know, I missed having Iron Man at my back."
"Hey," Clint said. "You hungry?"
Tony opens the door to a tiny studio apartment and lets Steve enter first. Steve glances around at the shabby furnishings and turns to raise a questioning eyebrow at Tony.
“Swell?” Tony suggested, grinning. He looked rather like the cat who got the canary just now.
Steve expects them to catch a cab, but when they leave the bar, Tony leads Steve down a few blocks instead, to a building that houses a busy restaurant on the first floor. The stairwell leading up to the second - then third - is cramped, and smells like stale frying oil.
Steve's own smile widened. "I'm due to start next semester, actually."
These days,
Steve finished the water, handed back the empty bottle, and dropped his head against the pillows. "And the shooter?"
“Crazy?” Steve said. “I know. Why do you think I hadn’t told you before now?”
Steve raised his eyebrows.
Steve pulled away from their frantic kissing long enough to pull the shield from his back, though it did not go far from reach, propped against the edge of the coffee table. He groaned when Tony’s hand found the bulge in his pants and palmed his cock.
Steve laughed; so much for avoiding being labeled
"He's not." Natasha placed a small notebook in her basket; the one Steve had been using was starting to get full. "You're refusing to see past the surface. Give him a chance. If you get to know him and you still don't like him, then I won't push the matter any further."
and give me credit that it worked?”
Steve drops his head back to the pillows and clenches his fists in the sheets.
The man sways, and Steve reaches out to steady him when he realizes the back of the man's shirt is wet.
Anthony rolls his eyes. "Stop talking and
Steve nodded to show he was listening, but didn't interrupt; it seemed like Tony needed to get all this off his chest.
"So," she says. "It's been almost two years now since he ran off."
That was the problem, Steve thought; he
>I figured since you're new in town, you might like some company.
Steve’s other hand, big and warm, curled firmly on Tony’s hip, holding him steady while Steve picked up the pace, adopting a rhythm that was hard and deep and exactly what Tony needed. Steve was always happy to indulge, responding easily to Tony’s requests for
"It's stupid," Tony says, reaching down to card his fingers through Steve's hair. "Just ... it's taken us so long to get here that the thought of a world where we're
“What the --” Tony began, quickly ducking into a side office.
"Wow," he said. "You really went all out with this undercover thing. Christmas tree too, huh?"
“Nightstand drawer,” Tony said, distracted as he began tugging down Steve’s pants.
“Enough worrying,” Steve said. He set his tablet aside and shifted, turning his body toward Tony’s. “It’s time to relax now.”
Natasha's snort cut off Tony's statement, not that he even knew where he was going with it, exactly.
Natasha glanced up at the sky, raising a hand to shield her eyes. “There’s our ride, Cap. Jarvis knows, of course, and Pep, but - I trust we’ll keep this between us?”
He wasn't expecting an answer, but the robot
There was a very distinct way that Tony said
"Thanks." Steve smiles. "It means a lot to me, Tony."
"It's probably nothing," Steve said. "Just - there was a car on Tony's street when I left his house. I thought it was a little strange. There was someone sitting in it, and they had the motor running."
"No." Tony shakes his head. "It's sort of - nice to get it out. My father ... he was in the Great War, but he spent the last six months of it in a prisoner of war camp. He and Jarvis - they were in the same unit, captured together. Kept each other going, really. Except ... Howard got subjected to a German experiment."
Tony kissed Steve again, and gradually they tumbled back onto the bed; at least for a little while longer, they could take comfort in the fact that someone else understood.
Steve got the strange, prickling feeling on the back of his neck, like he was being watched. He looked up, and over at Natasha. "What?"
"But you're watching him for his own safety," Steve says slowly.
Steve rolls up to his feet and hauls Sternberg up as well, keeping a hand on the man's shoulder to hold him in a crouching position. At their movement, a hail of shots rings out, embedding bullets all along the wall above them.
"So," Tony says, around a bite of wonderfully cheesy pasta. "Are you allowed to tell me how the rest of your mission went?"
, chin tucked down and eyebrows raised. He shifted until his erection, tenting the front of his sweatpants, ground against Tony's hip.
The plan was good, and it came together with the kind of ease that had all the members of the team sliding right into place like they had been working together for years — which, if their suspicions were true, they
"Maybe later, I'll help you degrease from the workshop," Steve suggests.
The lead that Tony picked up at the conference does not disappoint: he uncovers an entire cache of harvested and probably stolen tech being stored in Kashmir Vennema's name. The curious thing about her is that she never used any covers or aliases (unless the Kashmir Vennema identity itself is one), making it a relatively simple matter to track down her holdings in the city. Getting everything
Steve just sighed quietly and dropped a kiss to Tony's hair. They could worry about having that conversation later, but Steve did still murmur to himself and the four walls, before joining Tony in sleep: "Yes, I do."
"And do I have you to thank for tucking me in?" Tony asked.
Tony shrugged. “To be honest, I don’t know why we don’t have sex in your office more often.”
Tony looks over his shoulder at Steve, raising an eyebrow.
He was just on the edge of unconsciousness, ready to embrace the blackness behind his eyelids, when someone knocked on the door.
Steve propped himself on an elbow, eyebrows raised. "Is that so?"
Tony, still slouched in his desk chair and feeling a bit dazed, looked up at him. "... where did I go just now?"
, Steve."
Tony laughs softly. "The fact that your mind didn't automatically go somewhere dirty with that shows you are a far better man than me, Steve."
Shaken and confused, Steve crouches down beside the window and listens as the intruders finally charge into the lab.
“This,” she said, “is Ludwig II’s music box.”
Steve coughed lightly, a blush staining his cheeks. "Um. I'm pretty sure it was just calling everyone naughty, no matter what ..."
“Hey, next time don’t wait for a crisis as an excuse to visit. You know you’re always welcome.”
Tony sagged back against Steve’s chest while he caught his breath, and finally gave a little laugh once Steve lifted him off and began to straighten up their clothes.
“Come eat something,” Clint said firmly. “He’ll be there waiting when you get done.”
Steve planted his free hand against Tony's back, just between his shoulder blades, keeping him from squirming around. Tony assumed he might have hated being pinned down in such a way, but Steve's casual display of strength - something Steve had only been convinced to use in the bedroom after quite a lot of coaxing - just made him feel impossibly more aroused.
"So you're not," Tony agrees. "But you're still a recognizable public figure. A war hero. As long as Captain America and Iron Man had an excuse to always be together for the sake of liberating Europe of Nazis, then the public - and your superiors - didn't bat an eyelash, but now?"
"Oh," said Tony, suddenly serious. "If only you knew."
"Happy New Year," Tony said.
"Fuck, that's amazing, you're amazing," Tony moaned. "Come on, Steve, I need you."
Tony leaned against Jarvis and cried silently, and then only for a little while, unwilling to allow himself the weakness for very long. He still sniffled when he straightened, and gave a watery laugh when Jarvis produced a linen handkerchief for him to use.
It was a weird arrangement, and yet it worked better than any actual relationship Tony had ever been in.
After a moment of indecision, Tony sat down on the other end of the couch and began to eat his donut in silence, while the television documentary droned on about the sorts of creatures that lived in the darkest depths of the ocean. It was a little more entertaining than the videos often foisted onto science class by the educational system, but only just.
Inside the castle gates, the group splits up, with Jim, Dernier, and Dugan leading a group to find the rocket that von Strucker is rumored to have in one of the towers, and Tony going off with Falworth and the remaining soldiers in search of the baron himself.
"I prefer Anthony, actually."
“It’s just hard to look past the food fights and having to fix the holes he makes in my tower every couple of weeks,” Tony said.
Steve turned to look at Tony, smiling faintly; even at less than full brilliance, his smile caused an odd little pang in Tony's chest. Tony was conscious of the fact that they hardly knew each other, and might not even remain in contact once Steve's assignment was over, but Tony couldn't deny a growing affection for Steve that had nothing to do with his being - or having been - Captain America.
Tony raises an eyebrow, but he doesn't call Steve out on his insistence.
“Well, ahh, if you’re alright, then ...” the Captain began, as he led the way from the office, back to the hallway, his hand settling on the small of Tony’s back.
"Steve had a brief stint with that," Tony says. "It was bizarre, but the uniform was hot."
He did feel a little ridiculous with only a haircut and glasses constituting a disguise, like he was Clark Kent hiding his secret identity, but the new haircut went a long way toward modernizing his appearance, and his hair looked darker as a result. Natasha's guidance in that area had been wise, and she had assisted him in purchasing a new wardrobe of clothes that were appropriate for a low level teaching salary. Coulson had provided a few collegiate shirts for Steve's supposed alma mater, as well as a worn gray sweatshirt emblazoned with the word 'ARMY' in bold black letters on its front.
“It does,” said Matt.
Mark 5 came crashing through the door with a vial in hand. The helmet locked around his head. Even wafting in the smell would be enough to knock him out. Mark 5 clamped around Steve's wrists. It wouldn't hold him for long. Tony ran to Steve, tilting the content of the vial into his mouth. It was spat in his face, but it had the wanted effect. He caught Steve before he collapsed, lowering him gently to the floor.
"What do we have here? There's a lot of pageantry going on here. Lots of theater."
“Can I sit with you?”
“What’s on your mind?” asked Tony.
It was a simple lock keeping the muzzle in place. Why didn’t he rip it off? He had the strength. She took a bobby pin for her hair. After several tries, the muzzle fell off. Piper kicked it away.
She smirked, already taking a liking to the doctor. “Maybe not of the same caliber, but of the same breed. But even I find this one challenging.”
Fury watched from the control room as the newly formed Avengers went out to fight their battle.
“What are you in the mood for? Chinese, Indian, Tia?” asked Tony.
“When was that last time you slept?”
Lena joined her family at the kitchen table, handing the newspaper to Helmut.
“Where?” asked Bruce.
“Of course."
“Would tomorrow be okay?” asked Steve. Hopefully, that was too fast.
“A penguin named Theodore?” Carl repeated, focused on his mother. When she was gone at work, he would often replay her research details to himself. Keeping a little bit of Mommy with him while he waited for her to come home.
“Thank you," said Steve. He wanted to ask Tony for his number but wasn’t sure if the alpha wished to keep in touch. Part of the reason he chose Tony was the alpha wouldn’t cling to him. He should have known better than to get attached.
“FUCK!” shouted Tony.
Steve nodded but didn’t face him. He ran his hand down Steve's back. The painting was in its early stages, yet revealed a great deal. A frail being was curled tightly in the fetal position in a pool of red, facing the viewer. What could be seen of the subject's expression revealed the heavy sadness and fear of the moment, which would become more powerful as Steve added further detail. A hand was placed protectively over the subject’s stomach. Tony the exact moment in Steve's life the image depicted.
Piper looked to Winter, he nodded. He accepted what was about to happen, but it didn’t feel good. The glass wall of their cell lowered and Lena stepped in, then locked the collar in place around his neck.
“It’s fine, Tony."
“And what are your names little one?” asked Thor.
“You have met him I assume."
“Dr. Star will be here in ten minutes.”
"It was need to know, Stark."
“Do you got it?” asked Tony.
“Okay,” Piper acquiesced. “May I go play now?”
“Those god damn knotthead alphas who preached how it interest of public health for alphas to be omegas heat.”
“But-”
"Really."
“What?” he said.
"I will."
Steve groaned when his phone went off, waking him up. He answered it, not even looking at the time or who was calling.
Phil gave a relieved sigh.
“Two or three bowls.”
“Tony.” Steve carefully leaned over, gently kissing Tony.
“I beat her in chess,” she said.
“Upper thigh by a sniper,” he said.
Tony cringed.
It was too late for him to erase the thought from his mind. There was no forgetting it now. He nuzzled against Steve's neck and fell asleep.
Piper frowned.
“Built for something a lot stronger than you,” said Fury.
“Now or I’ll make you,” said Steve.
"Were you going to leave without saying goodbye." Helmut asked cautiously, a little suspicious.
"I didn't find anything like that. I know you have one now."
They went to a family restaurant. The only reason Tony knew about was it was the few places sold mango milkshakes at three in the morning. The news was playing on one of the TVs.
“Yes, Sir.”
He let Steve lead him out of the lab.
“This is what you saw?”
"It's the Stark New Year's Eve party you have to be there. Stockholders will be there."
The two guards shot at the same time. Bullets harmless pinged off his armor. Rhodes crashed through the window taking them out. Rhodes pointed his gun at Trevor.
“He stays,” said Fury.
Edith took a step back. She should have known better than to question his virility. It was one of the fastest ways to piss off almost any alpha.
“No. Were you expecting something?” Pepper paused in putting on her jacket.
"I'd put you in a hypnotic state."
Steve nodded.
Away from the ring was where the engineers were, watching their projects from behind the scenes. Among the many men, was a woman. She was dressed in cargo pants, a black tank top, and work boots. Her tan skin was marked with scars. The woman’s short black hair was tied into pigtails.
“Can I use a foreign langue?” she asked.
Winter shook his head and returned her books.
“How?”
Under Tony’s shirt were the lines of a brace, immobilizing his shoulder. It could have been worse. A nursed escorted them to their room. Tony flinched when he laid back.
“California? How?” asked Steve.
"It was my pleasure."
“A lot has happened Tony and I’m close,” she said.
“Tell me what I broke.”
“I’m pretty sure they want the same thing,” said Piper.
Rune grabbed her hand before she could challenge the woman further.
"I didn't know how you took your coffee," said Jarvis.
“Steve, you’re growling,” said Barny calmy.
*****
He nearly dropped his mug, trying to figure out if his boss was serious.
"Steve, what is it?" grumbled Tony.
“What did they do to you?”
“Alright, I need to change,” said Steve.
"You go."
"I drugged him. I didn't have any other choice."
"Thank you, honey."
“Where are you going?”
"You go, I'll unpack this."
“Sir?”
“Whenever the next chance arises.”
“I think it’s best if we discuss it elsewhere," said Natasha.
"How long have you been in here?"
“What do I smell like?” asked Steve.
*****
“She’s hurt.”
"What news?" asked Thor.
Steve smiled. There was still enough time to spar. He needed to get this energy out.
Carl continued on and on with his story. Some of them details seemed too odd. Steve the sickly penguin.
“No, Piper you can’t yank me like that." Tears welled in her eyes. “No, no don’t cry. Look at the funny face."
“I can't tell you what Steve sees in you, you'll have to ask him. We don’t choose who we love in love with. It would be simpler if we did,” said Peggy.
Finally, he reached Stark Tower, he pulled into the garage and parked the bike. Steve took off his helmet and set it on the bike seat. He hung up the keys on the wrack.
“Tony, I’m going home. We can work on this later.”
Victory never felt so bitter. The pain of his loss seeped through him. "What does it matter."
She raised an eyebrow. He sighed.
Steve nodded. Once done, he followed Coulson to a football field at one end of it was a large bull dowser. A football dummy was attached to it. In the bleachers were several scientists were waiting.
“Where’s my baby?!” he cried.
“Yes.”
“Math.”
Tony turned in his chair. “I’m fine with cheesy."
The air grew heavy with static. She had to calm him down. "Rune, please, you have to clam down."
Piper nodded, going to the corner. Lena waved her hand and the wall separating them sunk into the floor. Piper’s eyes darted to the open door, ten feet away from her. She dug her toes into the ground, forcing herself not to run. Lena walked into the cell, approaching Theodore without hesitation. There was a soft clink as the collar fell away from Theodore's neck. After that Lena walked out. The wall slowly rose from the floor, sealing closed.
There was a quiet knock on the door.
"Waking you up."
“Everyone needs sleep, Tony."
"We may have this well handled, but it would mean a lot to him if you showed more interest," said Pepper.
“Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there. But we thought it best to break it to you slowly,” said Fury.
"Understood." The call ended. Hill mentally put together a to-do list. A knock the disrupted her train of thought.
“Good, she’s regaining consciousness.”
“Glass.”
Tony carded his fingers through the omega’s hair. He stayed by his mate’s side until he fell asleep.
“I would say more than kinda, sweetie.”
“What are those things?” asked Rune.
"Let's get you to the bathroom."
“Steve?”
Lena sighed, gently hitting her head against the wall of her cell. She been taken away discretely, so as to not raise questions from her family. Pierce had plans for this. All she had to do was stay quiet, and things would work out.
“Remember what?”
To him the room was silent. But there had to be something if the pup was reacting like this. He kneeled by her side covering her hands with his. It seemed to help slightly. For ten minutes she cried out; then finally she fell into his chest.
There was only one more thing to take care of. Then they could go back to whatever brand of normal there was after this.
“Keep them. Best to keep everything. Less reason to set off Zemo,” replied Kevin.
"You should have noticed that in the sample," said Bruce.
“Do you think it will be a bad night?” asked Tony.
Once she left Tony got into bed with Steve. The omega nuzzled closely to him, seeking comfort, which he was more than willing to provide. He had to protect them. He'd failed to do that. As soon as he began to relax Natasha and Clint came storming into the room. He snarled not wanting anyone near his injured mate. Clint left not want to get into a fight with Stark. Natasha remained.
“What did I do to deserve you?”
“I need you in New York.”
"Do you want to try moving?"
Steve moved to his husband, kissing him. Tony reached for him, bringing him close, his arms wrapped tightly around his waist, keeping him there. The alpha's tongue crept into his mouth. He purred, his hands wandering Tony's form. Slick dampened his underwear. He moaned as Tony's teeth scraped against his neck. They froze when Piper stirred.
Every mind had a unique code to crack, with each project, she had to use a slight variation of her methodology. It required a gentle, methodical touch. Piper required a far more delicate touch. Even once she cracked the code granting her access to a subconscious mind, she was met with unexpected and fascinating difficulties. With Piper, Lena was unable to implant walls and suggestions that went too much against the girl’s nature. It was only a matter of time until that changed.
He went to the lab. Trying to keep himself distracted. He itched to call the omega his inner alpha so wanted. Even though his primal alpha urges were satisfied, he couldn’t stop the emotional connection it wanted.
“You don’t have to thank me, Steve. I’m happy to do this. We all have our bad days.” Steve nodded and returned to the elevator. Natasha sighed. She'd never seen him look so tired. What had he seen?
“Goodbye, Paninya.”
“You have something to say to me and I want to listen,” said Steve.
Piper’s awareness dulled as Lena hummed the child’s favorite lullaby. She tilted forward. Pierce had thought it silly for Lena to want of that singular piece of seemingly unimportant information. But the melody was key to getting Piper into a relaxed state. Soon her eyes closed.
He sighed. This woman had been lost to the passion of work. He'd seen it before.
“I lead her nowhere. Instinct took her there."
“And I missed you too.”
"I don't know how to answer, sir. I'm incapable of being in the situation you currently find yourself in. Even though I can't give specifics to such a hypothetical scenario, I can assume I'd do what you're currently doing."
“There will be issues. The two of you take stubbornness to a new level. There will come a time when he tries to push away don’t let. Don’t let him,” she said.
“To turn you into me,” said Winter.
“I know it matters just not in this case.”
"Cord blood, Jarvis can vouch for its authenticity," said Edith.
“It happened again.” Steve breathed, ashamed.
“There is no stopping it. There is only the war,” said Loki, pointing his scepter at Thor.

“Maybe, can you stop?” That edging panic was growing uncomfortably near it and the kid wasn’t helping. He took a breath trying to steady himself. “Remember when I told you I have an anxiety issue?”
“I’m sorry um for uh-
How could he be so damn perky? His baby was draining him of all morning energy. "What time is it?"
like he was
“Easy, beautiful."
“Fury may give you an assignment, but it will likely be minor. I don’t believe undercover suits you. Enjoy the free time,” said Natasha.
“Thank you again, Matt,” he said before following Happy to the car.
Steve pushed, pressing back against his mate. He felt the stretch of her shoulders.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
All wanted was a peaceful life with his mate. Well, as peaceful as their lives could be.
"How did you like your gift?" asked Tony.
"He will. Need anything special?"
“Working on it sir, this is a prototype, sir.”
The weight lifted off his shoulders.
“What?” asked Steve.
“You’re done.” He picked her up.
Clint chuckled. Steve had a very dry sense of humor. It made him sound even more the old man. Natasha came back with the French agent came to greet them.
“Put them on,” said Steve. Tony rolled his eyes. “Please."
“I hope this is a stupid question, but are you and Papa going to get divorced?”
“So, no?”
Steve's breathing calmed.
“I won’t keep you any longer,” said Edith before hanging up the phone.
“I will,” said Jarvis.
The footage of Steve's bedroom appeared in front of him. Only a tuff of his golden-brown hair could be seen from under the blankets. Steve buried himself under the blankets and curled up in a ball. He’d built a nest of the decorative pillows. He’s nesting.
“Perfect."
“What's it like there?” he asked.
“Hurry,” whimpered Steve. Whatever Tony was looking for, he found. Steve keened, canting his hips. Those fingers worked perfectly against his slick glands. The alpha added a second finger, scissoring him. Steve balanced on the edge of release, but those fingers weren’t enough to get him over it.
"It isn't only our relationship," said Steve.
“What?” Piper was caught short.
Thor stood up suddenly.
Tony kept running his fingers through Steve’s hair even once asleep. The simple touch reassured him that the omega was really there. He took his phone from his pocket. He hit his lawyer’s number.
“Don’t get up.”
“And Piper?”
“You won’t see me the same way. No one will.”
"I'll shower, then I'll be right out," Tony capitulated.
“That’s a square deal,” said Tony.
“Shh, you wouldn’t want to wake her.” Rumlow studied the two in disbelief. “The crazy bitch was right. I didn’t know you liked them so young.”
On his last trip to S.H.I.E.L.D., he planted a virus in their system. They'd yet to discover it. He'd planted it in a minor branch of the or so he didn't get anything juicy. Only basic level-six information.
“Anthony Edward Stark, I wasn’t expecting you,” she said.
“Hi, Piper.”
“So why didn’t S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him on the Tesseract project? What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?” asked Bruce.
The intimidating sound demanded he back down but he brushed it aside. Steve pinned his husband to the ground, smothering him with his scent until the alpha’s muscles uncoiled. Tony went still underneath him, but his gaze remained feral. Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Nothing.”
“It matters,” said Natasha.
“You didn’t," he said. Tony slowly approached, not wanting to frighten him. He took Steve’s hand, placing it over his chest. “See, it's fine."
“Yes.”
Tony slowly opened his eyes. An alarm was blaring in his ears. He was flying.
Tony couldn’t hide his surprise. “And how did you come upon that piece of information?"
The ride home was quiet except for the classic rock played at a low volume. Tony closed his eyes and enjoyed the music.
"I believe that was due to the circumstances of your previous pregnancy. Your inner omega felt unsafe in its surroundings, which causes restlessness. Now you have a mate and well supported it is relaxed."
“Jarvis, what time is it?”
“And the password please.”
She smiled. “That’s one possibility. Don’t hide from it. Enjoy this new opportunity however you wish. Don’t waste it."
“I might have something dry for you to wear,” said Tony, breaking the tension.
“Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters!” said Tony.
“And you couldn’t convince him?" she said.
“He’ll be staying,” said Steve, firmly.
“Papa isn’t feeling well. He needs a little bit alone time."
"News on an urgent mission. I have to handle this."
"A little," said Steve.
“Open the window,” demanded Tony.
“So?”

“If you have nothing else to tell me, Jarvis can show you out,” said Tony.
“An original piece by Captain America could be worth millions in the right market,” said Tony.
Rune yawned loudly and rubbed his eyes sleepily. The pup allowed Pepper to pick him up. He rested his head on her shoulder.
“What were things were like before you were taken?”
“The symptoms were obvious. To be sure, I scanned you while you were sleeping. You are approximately nine days along,” said Jarvis.
Tony yawned one round, and he was done. Steve took his hand, bringing him into bed. There was a plea for comfort apparent in his eyes. It had been there for some time and he was just taking notice now.
“Piper! Jarvis is she okay?! Did I hurt her?!”
Rumlow watched as Winter was loaded into the CT machine. The doctor watched the monitor waiting for an image.
“It's under repair, so no,” said Lena.
Steve debated whether or not to stay hidden. He took a breath, best to get this over with. If this were to somehow get out in the press, he would rather her face him in person, not by the paper or the internet.
“You saw that?” he asked.
They went into the office. Dr. Wu greeted them. He shook their hands.
“Watch it,” warned Tony.
“I promise I’ll get you out of this,” she said.
"Who I spend my time with is my business."
“If weren't important you'd be asleep. Tell me now so we can sleep," said Steve.
“Steve, what is this?” asked Tony.
"Good, it didn't seem as bad."
“What?”
“Jarvis, let me up."
“It only applied to mated pairs. What I have with you is the strongest connection I’ve ever had with another person. Only prove how great a mistake it was for me to push you away. I’ve never had anything like this before." Tony tensed but swiftly relaxed Steve nuzzled against his neck. Steve tenderly licked at his bruises. He shivered at the touch. “I don’t know what I did to earn you in my life, but I’ll try to be deserving of it."
Steve took a breath.
“You had a crush on someone. Come on Steve, you can tell me."
The elevator stopped on his floor, revealing a red-faced Happy carry twelve large grocery bags.
“More what I didn’t hear,” he said.
“Steve, we have to go.”
“Theodore!”
Steve smiled softly.
“Where’s our room?” asked Steve.
“Sam’s Diner,” said Clint.
“Coconut and metal,” said Tony.
“Every three months,” repeated Tony.

Tony quickly scrapped the bacon into the trash.
Steve blushed. Tony took the empty seat beside him. He brushed his fingers through Steve’s hair without a second thought. Steve purred in response.
Bucky snorted. “Yeah, I’d trust that.”
Several long, long moments pass like that, Tony buried in Steve in the dark and the quiet.
Steve swallowed at the “often.” How many times had this happened? How many times had he caused this before, without even knowing?
Slowly, a little hesitantly, Tony looked up. Steve was only watching him out of the corner of his eye, so he could still see Clint’s face change from a casual grin to concern. “Hey, why are you—wait, hold up, are you guys okay?”
it’s Tony Stark. Howard’s son. The Omega.”
As quickly as he’d taken it, Bucky released their powers again, magick slamming back with all the force of a hurricane. Steve nearly fell off Captain’s back just from that.
Have some Bonding, Howard going away forever (yay!), our favorite spy and archer back in the thick of things (hi Nat!! hi Clint!!!) and the happy ending our poor boys deserve. This is...maybe two notches above the original ending for this fic, but it's better and longer and the best I can do without making you all wait another month. So, here!
“I don’t know what’s
Bucky flicked his wrist. Tony froze where he was, and for one endless second nothing happened at all.
“Do you want more?”
and he was
Steve had had a low opinion of Stark before, when he was just a rich man dismissing his son because of his breed. This was….cruel.
Enough to not be afraid. Enough to know his father wouldn’t pay ransom.
They stayed there for about ten more minutes, and Tony never moved. Steve didn’t, either, just crouched next to him with one small point of contact tethering them together.
The two spies sprang to their assignments, Natasha vanishing in a flash and Clint helping to gently turn Tony over. Shards of glass were embedded in his skin, and the right side of his face was streaked with blood where his temple had split. Steve and Clint carefully picked out the larger shards, avoiding the minuscule slivers by mutual agreement—they were too tiny to be pulled out with large, clumsy fingers.
anymore, he didn’t need Captain America, he didn’t need to be saved, so he nodded once, harsh, and pushed himself up.
“Okay,” Steve says, “is it alright if I touch you?”
want me to, I shouldn’t have even offered, sorry, that was just. Stupid. I’m gonna, I’m gonna stop talking now.”
“So throw it up,” Tony muttered, not a question.
The screen scrolled down to the Related Articles section and zoomed in on one of the headlines: You Don’t Need To Be Unconscious To Get A Concussion.
“Do you want me to just keep doing this?” Steve whispers into the dark, and Tony hesitates. Everything still feels weighted and dangerous, but a quick breath in and she turns over, facing Steve, burying her face in her chest.
When they didn’t immediately wheel around and charge up the street, Nat frowned. “What’s going on?”
“Yeah, um, I don’t really get, ah, touched a whole lot,” Tony said quietly. “After, after Afghanistan, I didn’t want anyone to. You know.”
And went out.
Steve flinched at the bitter venom in Tony’s voice. “That’s not true.”
Aunt Peggy was gone, and he had to find out from Steven Goddamn Rogers, who had
Tony couldn’t see straight. His Aunt Peggy, his
“Hey Steve, Tony, what’s up?”
When the way was pronounced clear they both darted across the open space and vaulted over the high iron fence. Steve gave Clint a boost and jumped up himself, and wondered if Tony Stark had made this fence, if his magick had twisted all its little pieces just so.
It was a better job than most lower-class citizens could manage to secure. Pietro had been a runner, trying to support his sister as she looked for work—there weren’t many jobs that needed a telepath, and few wanted an employee who could peer into their thoughts, twist them around. Jarvis had found them while out on errands, and took a few days to convince Howard they could be useful. Jarvis had nearly lost his job for that, but he’d done it.
HERE COMES THE ANGST TRAIN CHOO CHOO MOTHERTRUCKERSSS
“Okay.”
“I know,” Steve whispered.
“Tony, how long have you had your magick?” Steve asked.
“Yeah, Cap?”
Steve looked away from Tony’s too-sharp gaze and found himself looking at Bucky. But Bucky was staring at Steve too, a mix of anger and something else written into the hard set of his jaw and the shine of his eyes.
Tony glanced up, a look of surprise flickering across his face before he bent over his work. “Bucky needs an arm.”
She can’t move.
“Tones?”
sprinting too quickly to see through the city. He shook his head. Too late to think about that now.
“Steve,” Nat cut in sharply, “he said no. Just get up to Bruce’s lab.”
The flinching was even more violent that time, Tony’s eyes wide and afraid as he scrambled back into the nearest corner. Steve crouched down, trying to make himself as unthreatening as possible as Tony drew his knees up to his chest and shook. As Steve got closer he could see his lips moving, and when they were side by side his enhanced hearing could pick up the barest whispers, more breath than sound.
