Working the shampoo into his hair, Dean made sure to tilt Cas's neck forward so none of the soapy runoff could flow down his back and touch his wounds. That shit stung like a bitch, and Cas had already been through enough that day. "Gotta rinse you off now," Dean said, guiding Cas's head underneath the faucet. He hummed contentedly as the water washed away the lather, shaking his hair dry like a wet dog as soon as Dean turned the spigot off. "Dude, not cool," he laughed, grabbing a towel. "Get over here, gotta dry you off."
Cas sensed Dean sitting down next to him, close enough to feel his body heat radiating in the cool night. He wanted so badly to lean into it, to rest against Dean, let the warmth envelope him.
"Oh. I… probably should not have said all that. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to unload on you," he said, quickly and apologetically. "I forget about boundaries sometimes." Cas flushed and looked away as though embarrassed.
By the time they finally made it to the diner, Cas had wormed his way onto Dean's lap, face plastered to his flannel shirt. Now both wings were trying to extend around Jack like a shield, quivering minutely. Once Sam put the car in park, Dean immediately moved to open the door and shrug off Cas. This only spurred the tiny angel to latch onto him even tighter, and that's when Dean realized it wasn't the Impala that made Cas nervous. No, it was simply anything outside the bunker.
you, but he doesn't
also this definitely won't be the last fic in this verse so if u are interested in more u can subscribe to the series!! i have a one chapter date night fic partially drafted and a short lil dean pov introspective half written but if yall have anything specific u would like to see lmk i am always open to suggestion!!
Huh. Dean thought about that for a second. It
"There's really nothing you can do?" Dean whispered, voice breaking just a little. Rowena simply rolled her eyes and sighed dramatically.
even. "Dee," he squeezed Dean a little tighter, "Dee." It seemed as though somehow his name had replaced the majority of Cas's chirps and hums. Dean had absolutely no idea how to feel about that.
just fuckin'
Dean’s going to be sick. Nothing happens, nothing at all, and it’s his worst nightmare.
"Yeah, of course, I wasn't trying to insinuate anything. It's not that we want him back because he's a burden this way. He deserves to be in his right mind, he would want to get back to normal as fast as possible."
“Does Dean know? That you’re in love with him?” Erin couldn’t stop herself from blurting out the question, regretting it the second it left her mouth. She didn’t even know why she asked. She didn’t care about the romantic ventures of her customers. It wasn’t any of her business.
“It doesn’t matter!” Jack yelled, startlingly explosive. He stood up and planted himself right in front of Cas, clearly trying his best to look determined and authoritative, despite the way his lip wobbled. “It doesn’t matter what you think you deserve because you
romantically involved? Yet they live together? Castiel’s sleep deprived and half delirious musings were not easy to interpret.
Holy fucking shit. Was that just how kid Cas was perceiving the memories, or had Cas already been thinking like that the whole time? Had
"I always come back to you." Cas turns his face to the side and kisses Dean's head. It makes him feel warm all over. "I'll always find a way to get back to you. Always have, always will."
Snowflakes clung to the fibers of Cas's t-shirt, the tips of his eyelashes, the curls of hair on the back of his neck. He caught one on his finger, using a smidgen of his grace to preserve the crystalline formation before it melted. Before
“Welcome to the club kid, welcome to the fucking club.”
When Cas felt the familiar crunch and grind of the tires rolling over the gravel near the bunker, he held his breath. He could already see it happening; Dean parking the Impala, turning to him in the passenger seat like that one night in Rexford, looking at him with some mix of pity and disdain, telling him, "Nothing happened, okay? We took care of that vamp nest and came straight home. Nothing changed. Got it?"
Dean continued towards the bunker’s main room, hoping to find Sam and Jack waiting there. He knew he was being selfish when he asked that they stay outside the dungeon when he rescued Cas from the Empty. Dean shouldn’t have a monopoly on Cas, he was Sam’s friend too; hell, he’s Jack’s fucking dad. They deserved to see Cas just as much as he did, maybe even more—it’s not like
She was still sulking in her room when her phone buzzed against her desk, light glowing briefly. She snatched it immediately, flipping it over to see the screen.
"Holy shit, Dean, what did you do?" Sam was doubling over but Dean just frowned. He for one did not find the situation very humorous. Not right now at least.
And because Dean needed to make sure it really stuck this time, he absolutely fucking hammered the point home, looking Cas straight in the eye and saying, "And you know what? Let's say you
Dean was supposed to get mad at
Dean flipped on the lights and sat on his bed, gingerly trying to remove Cas’s arms from his neck without waking him up. The kid wriggled around a bit, but ultimately Dean had successfully laid him on the comforter, limbs sprawled and hair floppy. This was the first time all day Dean hadn’t been touching Cas, and though he’d never admit it he actually kinda missed the contact. Cas’s fingers twitched, looking for something to hold onto, and he couldn’t help placing his pinky in his palm, Cas closing a fist around it immediately.
Dean passed the time by going into full deep-cleaning mode. He scrubbed the floors, did the dishes, swept the kitchen—anything to occupy his hands and mind. Not a single surface had been spared by the time Jack finally came back, Cas at his side.
They reached the couch and Erin took the pillows and blankets from Cas, arranging them then turning back around to face him.
Why would he come if he didn’t want anything?
Erin shrugged. "Alright, suit yourself. But you don't get to complain if it's something you don't like," she said, giving him a stern look.
"Yeah, actually. Weirdly enough I was reading through some old archives the other day and I found some 'angel 101' type documents, recorded decades ago by the Men of Letters. A lot of random information, more interesting than useful to be honest, but there was a section on angel habits. From what I remember off the top of my head, angels only make nests when they feel totally secure so it's kind of a big deal. I think feathers are normally the main material the nest consists of, but fundamentally it just has to be stuff the angel associates with safety, comfort, love, things in that ballpark. It's something they're very proud of, and it's important that other angels are impressed by it. Also, I think angels can ask another angel to share their nest by offering a feather or something like that, but it's pretty rare. They'll only do that if they have a really special connection, and apparently getting rejected is super devastating so the risk is a bit of a deterrent. There might've been more, but that's about all I can remember."
“Dean. Stop.”
As Sam and Jack lined up to fill their own plates with food, Dean couldn’t help smiling. Yeah, the day had started out pretty shitty, but as far as afternoons go, this was one of the best Dean could remember ever spending with Jack. Cas, too. He raised his eyes up towards where Cas sat, resting his upper body on the top of Dean’s head.
” Erin sang to Jack, laying him down on the changing table. “
repeating in his thoughts like a broken record. He drank himself into oblivion after Sam forced him to get up, later clinging onto him in the kitchen, slurring "I love 'm Sammy, I love 'm 'n I didn' even say it back.
angel—no, Cas was
Cas looked at her blankly before snorting and letting out a bonafide, honest-to-God
"Well, at least you boys can be sure Castiel is still an angel. Not many creatures have juice like that anymore." Rowena bent down to get a better look at Cas, who had retreated behind Dean and was currently using his legs as a shield. He had to fight the urge to laugh when Cas honest-to-God hissed at Rowena, like some feral animal, before hiding behind his knees again.
last chapter is finally here!!!!!! hope yall enjoy <3
"And you're sure you can? With your new responsibilities and whatever? Because you can't just promise that and walk it back later. You can't do that to me."

“But I just fucked up so bad. I fucking told him Jack wasn’t his son. God, I don’t even know why I said that. Cas is one of the best fathers I’ve ever seen, he loves Jack so much and Jack loves him. Of course that’s his son. Fuck.”
"Yeah, whatever," Dean mumbled, cheeks burning a bit. Being insinuated as Cas's parent was extremely weird and Rowena seemed to revel in his obvious discomfort.
he choked out, about two and a half octaves higher than normal. His gaze immediately lowered to her chest—which in any other situation,
Erin could tell something was off as soon as Cas opened the door. The dark circles under his eyes looked like bruises, his hair even more disheveled than usual. Clunky rumbling from what sounded like a washing machine echoed through the house, overlapping the faint wailing noise carrying through the hallways.
Everyday Cas finds a new way to break Erin's heart just a little bit more.
Dean went absolutely still, not even breathing.
Dean's jaw dropped.
An impulse shot through Erin like a strike of lighting. She lunged towards Castiel, grabbing his arm before he could walk away. “Hey, I’m serious about everything I said earlier. I’m sure the opinion of your local barista means jack shit to you and I definitely care about this way more than I should but you need to know you deserve good things too. You deserve to hear it. You deserve to get what you want, to be happy.” She inhaled deeply. “I actually like you, Castiel. Yeah, I think you might be kind of insane, but you also have a really big heart. I'm lucky to have met you. Jack is lucky to have you, and Dean would be too.”
“Man, I hate this part of the job. I mean, she’s just a kid! And this isn’t just some vamp or shifter, y’know. That shit is easy. How the fuck are we supposed to explain what Jack is? Or
"Make what easier?"
Fingers started running through his hair, something Cas was quickly discovering worked as somewhat of an off-switch for him. He sighed, sinking further into the mattress (the memory foam mattress) ((
"I'm sorry, Dean." Cas’s voice was barely audible, and Dean almost didn’t catch the apology. “I’m sorry for leaving and making you worry. I just don’t—”
Propped on his elbows, Dean moved to get out of bed and froze. His room looked like it had been torn apart by a tornado.
When he got back to Cas's room, he paused next to the crib, looking down at Jack sleeping in his arms. "Y'know I love you, right? Cas, too. He loves you so much. He'd give you the world if he could. You
Dean pursed his lips. That didn't sound especially reassuring.

apologize—that was sexy as hell." Cas turned even redder and Dean grabbed his hands, pulling him out of the passenger seat. Burying his head in his chest, Cas groaned in embarrassment; Dean just kept laughing, apparently amused by his humiliation. "I'm dead serious, Cas," he said, letting go of his hands to wrap his arms around Cas's waist. "I mean, imagine how many lights you'll blow the first time we fu—"
"That—" he wheezed, "that has got to be the
"Mornin’ to you too, buddy." Cas chirped brightly again and just kept hugging him, like a koala to a tree.
melted it, ruined it, because that's all he does, and that's why he has to stay away.
The baby began babbling urgently, making grabby hands at Dean, who looked like he’d been struck dumb by God themself. Erin swallowed, half expecting to get yelled at by Dean for bringing Jack into what looked like a scene from some freaky occult movie. It’s not like it was even her fault; still, knowing Dean, she wouldn’t put it past him to blow up at her, especially given how… clearly unwell he was at the moment.
“Yes.” Dean barely catches it, but his hands stop moving immediately. He leans away from Cas, cups his blotchy face in his calloused palms.
"I didn't realize it was love at the time, of course. I'd never felt
you know what I want.” The words are pouring out of his mouth now, gaining momentum with each syllable. “I don’t care what I have to do. I don’t care if I have to go through every single goddamn angel stuffed in you, I don’t care if it rips me apart, just—just give me a chance to find him. Just tell me where he is. Please.”
As Dean failed to respond to Cas, his happy chirping sped up and increased slightly in pitch, sounding more anxious now than pleased. His bottom lip wobbled and he gripped Dean's wrist even tighter, fingers digging into his skin.
“Me ‘n Sammy would do this sometimes,” Dean says softly. “Crack open a beer and listen to the crickets, watchin’ for shooting stars. Sometimes he’d point out constellations, smart son of a bitch. Never knew what the hell he was talkin’ about but I tried to follow along.” He chuckles and it hurts like nothing else.
“Oh, honey, I
"You're telling me his grace got a factory reset?"
Appearing to be a little lost, Jack frowned. "She didn't answer my question," he mumbled, grabbing a nugget. Dean shoved a handful of fries into his mouth before saying anything back.
Like a reflex, Cas scooted forward and threw his arms around Jack; he hated to see him cry, it was even worse than just crying himself. He spread his wings up and to the side, protecting them both from the onslaught of flurried snow. “I’m sorry, Jack, I’m sorry,” he said, his own high-pitched voice shaky now. “I don’t wanna leave you, I won’t, I promise. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said what I did earlier. I’m not gonna leave, I love you too.”
"It is a very pretty spot. Nice and peaceful, good for deep thoughts,” Jack said earnestly. “I think we should go home though. You can still think there, right? I like this place but Dean is kind of freaking out right now.”
Dean’s second mistake was ignoring the voices of reason screaming at him in his head, instead choosing to pull off course in search of the nearest bar. Ten minutes later he found himself throwing back a beer next to some sexy brunette who was practically undressing him with her eyes. A few years ago Dean would've given her a wink, maybe a smile, really put on the Winchester charm, but he barely glanced at her before refocusing on his drink. At this point, Cas had kinda ruined him for anyone else.
"Have
wrong. The kind that rips through your throat on the way up.
"I really am sorry, I wish we had another room for you but we didn't buy this house with guests in mind. Both Dean and I don't have many friends who would ever stay overnight. I can only think of a couple people who'd be exceptions, and even then it's fairly unrealistic that the occasion would ever arise."
Dean narrowed his eyes, brows furrowing; his expression shifted from pissed off and mildly offended to intensely sad, looking at Cas with something like guilt. He brought his hands up from Cas's shoulders, cupping his face for the second time that night. Cas silently leaned into it; he didn't trust himself to say anything more, not with the lump still rising in his throat.
Cas, her legs almost gave out beneath her. He looked… bad, really fucking bad. Dean was holding him in a way where his back faced to the side just a little, leaving it partially exposed, and Erin stared in horror at the gaping cuts running parallel to his shoulder blades. It was like someone took a butcher’s knife and sliced—no,
Bingo. It was shit like this that puzzled Erin to no end. Cas had vehemently denied that Dean was anything but straight (“Look, all I'm saying is no heterosexual man obsesses over Dr. Sexy like that.” “Erin.
Dean smiled, soft and fond and maybe just a little sad. "You gonna sleep now?"
Ah yes, Purgatory.
Dean bristles, wipes his face and growls, because
Cas because he’s feeling like shit and they’re best friends. Pieces continued to fall into place in Erin’s mind; now that she’d experienced Dean sans the rosy filter of Cas’s perspective, she was even more convinced that Dean liked Cas. For God’s sake, he
“Great. You know the Antichrist exists, whoop-dee-fuckin-doo. What d’ya want, a gold star?” Dean really hoped he wasn’t coming off as scared as he actually felt. His heart hammered against his ribcage, threatening to blow his already flimsy front of disinterested calm.
“I think Dean would be lucky to have the chance to build a life with you and Jack. He’d be an idiot to think otherwise. I know you don’t agree, you don’t have to, but it’s true. If anything, I’d say he’s the one undeserving of you.”
As Dean took a closer look at Cas's wings, he realized they were covered in a film of viscera. Downy feathers had clumped together, sticky with congealed blood. He lifted up Cas's shirt very gently; sure enough, at the base of his wings were two nasty looking gashes. The skin around them looked swollen and irritated.
Yeah, Dean felt a little bit like that now. Totally cracked open, extremely lost, saved only by the mercy and grace of his own personal Jesus, his best friend, his angel. Cas continued to hold his cheek in one hand, humming softly, staring at him like he was the only thing that mattered. Dean's lip started to tremble.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I’m so sorry.”
” she finished, placing the baby on his blanket as gingerly as possible. Jack squirmed for a moment but didn’t wake back up, and Erin left the room with a huge sigh of relief. Holy hell, that felt much harder than it should've been.
John's voice continued to echo in Dean's head, bouncing around endlessly. He clenched his jaw; since when do fucking Disney songs hit that hard? He wondered what John would say now, if he saw him literally dancing in the kitchen, making fuckin' pancakes with his pseudo-son who could sing every Disney song from memory and a male angel who he'd been in love with for years.
"Alright, I believe you, but if nothing's wrong, then why…" Dean trailed off, not really sure how to describe Cas's behavior, "this?" Not his most coherent sentence, but he figured Cas would get what he was trying to say.
"What the fuck did you do? I swear to God, Rowena," Dean growled, "I will fuck you up beyond recognition if you don't fucking fix this."
“Uh, hey guys. We have a problem.”
Dean Winchester,” he growls. He looks angry, then his face crumples like a flimsy sheet of paper and he’s burying his nose in Dean’s neck again, tears sticky on his skin. Dean continues to sit there, not quite sure what he’s supposed to do anymore.
“Anyways, Erin and Jack showed up and saved the day and then Erin drove us home. The rest of us made it here okay, but, um, Cas still needs some attention.” He looked down at Cas, curled up and clammy in his arms, and his face darkened. “I’m gonna put him in my bathroom, get him patched up. Can you grab some med supplies and bring ‘em to me?”
"No, that's
"Dude, you're making me drive?"
"Shit. That barista was right, I really did a fucking number on you, huh?" Dean smiled but his eyes were haunted, heavy. "I'm—I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I made you believe I'd do something like that to you. That's on me. But I'm not gonna leave you high and dry this time, okay?" He stroked Cas's cheekbone, light and gentle.
Might as well just say bye to Cas now.
"You can stay." A pause. "Please stay." His voice was hoarse, even when muffled, and it sent a pang through Erin's heart. God, she was gonna absolutely murder Dean the second he got back.
let Dean kill him.
And there's the catch, Dean thinks. Of course Cas couldn't just come back, no strings attached. Of course they wouldn't be allowed to be happy, to finally get what they want.
He sees something to believe in, and that's enough.
“You sell tea, right? There's gotta be something that would help with a sore throat, yeah?”
“Cas, I, uh—I know I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with you. Don’t need a ring or some piece of paper to make that true, but, uh—you deserve it, man. You deserve the stupid proposal speech, the ring, the whole nine yards, and I wanna give it to you, so.” He swallows, fumbles the tiny box out of his flannel pocket. His hand is shaking like a bitch but he manages to snap the case open and shove the band in Cas’s face.
,” she whispered, Jack snuffling and whining quietly. “Please go back to sleep, shhh, c’mon Jack.”
Jack's brow furrowed. "What did Rowena say about Cas? What's going on with his grace?"
him from me, I
Cas is beaming now, and he grabs Dean's hand from his chest, tangles their fingers again.
She took a second to breathe before shifting Jack to a better position, angling the bottle towards his face. Part of Erin expected Jack to fight it, but he hungrily accepted, sucking enthusiastically.
"It's us! See, there's you and Dean, and then there's Cas, and then that's me." Craning his neck, Dean attempted to catch a glimpse of the picture. He could make out four figures on the paper: two guys in flannel, one clearly taller and with longer hair, standing next to a man with black hair and a clumsily sketched tan trenchcoat, sporting a pair of black wings. In the middle of them all was a shorter boy in a t-shirt and jeans, drawn with a big smile and gold wings. Each guy was clearly labeled as 'Sam', 'Dean', 'Dad', and 'Me!'. It made Dean's chest ache, just a little bit.
Immediately, Cas's head jerked up, and he turned towards Dean with a stricken expression. Something passed on his face when he made eye contact with Dean, some emotion Dean couldn't quite place, and he mouthed
There were a few seconds where Jasmine didn't respond, just sat there holding onto Erin like a lifeline. Then she bit her lip, still avoiding eye contact, and nodded. Erin let out a breath she didn't realize she'd even been holding in. Ignoring the pain in her knees, she stood up from the squat she'd maintained for the past five minutes and lightly tugged on Jasmine's arm.
A minute passed and the fear didn’t lessen, not even a little bit, but Erin managed to make herself move in the direction of the sound. She walked tentatively down the hallway, Jack having quieted somewhat but still sobbing loud enough to make her ears ring. They passed the threshold of the kitchen, the remnants of their interrupted breakfast still out on the table and high chair. Somehow the room looked darker than earlier, and Erin looked up at the lights to see that one of them had blown out. Not just
you, you gotta come back—"
what if you’re not real?
"Cas?"
“You know, Dean directly told me this is what he wanted. Living with me and Jack, giving us a shot. He said I needed to give him a chance. And I've given him the chance to do right by us, and for the most part he has. That's what I find most distressing—he's been wonderful up until now, so this sudden change in his behavior makes me inclined to believe he's realized this isn't actually what he wants.” He opened his eyes slowly and looked down, smoothing out the wrinkles in the shirt currently resting in his lap.
you. Cas told me he was
Anxiety and panic burned hot in Dean’s body, making his skin prickle sharply, violently. “It’s,” He took a deep breath. “It’s okay, Jack,” he said through gritted teeth. “It’s not your fault. I’m just really worried.” His words were accentuated by a loud, hiccuping sniffle from Cas, his chirps and repeated ‘Dee’s sending rumbling vibrations through his chest. Dean could feel something wet starting to soak through his shirt; he couldn't tell if it was tears, snot or sweat. Probably some combination of all three. This realization did nothing to soothe the fear searing through his soul, and he looked at Jack desperately. “Can you go explain this to Sam so he can text Rowena about it? And tell him to make it quick.”
"You think you're real fuckin' cute, huh, Winchester?"
"Shh, don't yell. Jack finally settled down, I would prefer to eat dinner in peace and uninterrupted." Cas smelled like laundry detergent and baby powder, momentarily overpowering the spicy tomato basil soup as Dean took a deep breath. He turned his head slightly to kiss Cas on the cheek, then raised his spoon above the pot.
"How could Dean ever
Erin smiled. Honestly, it kinda made her feel a little warm and fuzzy that she was one of the only people close enough to Cas to do this. She didn't have that many close friends either, and it was kinda nice to know that someone considered her special, important. "Hey, it's no biggie, really. I've definitely slept in worse places, and I honestly don't mind couches. I'm just grateful you're letting me stay."
Cas chirped somewhat dismissively and snuggled closer, clearly uninterested in moving. His wings flapped a couple times before bending to cover Dean's arms like a feathery bear hug.
was the one causing pain. He had to close his eyes for a second.
Rowena laughed and stuck out her own pinky. "Alright, dear. Pinky promise." She looked to Sam and Dean.
Dean opened his eyes just a crack, lashes crusted together, eyelids swollen and sore. Something was plastered to his cheek, or maybe it was vice versa. It took a few seconds before he registered he was lying down horizontally, his body flat on the hard floor while his head was pillowed on something soft. After blinking a couple times, he could barely make out the fuzzy outlines of Sam and Jack, pizza boxes in hand, staring at him with wide eyes and slack jaws.
Dean grabs his shoulders from behind, fisting his hands in the fabric of the trenchcoat, pulling Castiel up only to slam him back down against the hard surface. It’s fast and violent and he can tell that Dean is really putting his whole body into it, putting his whole body into bashing Castiel’s head in
"Even then, sometimes the people you trust to always be there for you, the people you'd die for, are the ones that distance themselves once you really need them. They decide you're not worth their effort anymore the second you need more help than you can offer in return, the second you outlive your usefulness. They let you go and don't look back." He ran a hand through his hair, weary, bone-tired. Erin was starting to flashback to some of those first encounters at Starbucks, when Cas was still Castiel and she was still just the indulgent barista.
to be Cas’s Dean. Oh yeah, it was all coming together: of course Dean had never been here before, Cas always grabbed coffee for him. Dean came out here to get something
Cas opened his eyes slowly, wet eyelashes clumping together. Dean was staring right back, cheeks blotchy and green eyes red-rimmed.
"Sup, Sammy?" Dean’s voice was light, casual, but his eyes hardened, as though daring Sam to say something about the situation. In that moment Cas felt himself falling in love all over again.
“I—” Cas’s frown deepened. “I think I’m hungry?” He paused. “Yes, I think this is what hunger feels like. Can we get food?”
"C'mon, Cas. Just take the drink." Dean squatted in front of Cas and ruffled his hair with a smile. "It'll make you feel better, okay? Trust me."
Immediately after the words left his mouth, an ear-splitting shriek rang through the room, causing everyone to flinch and cover their ears. Blinding light enveloped where Cas had been standing just a second ago, and Dean's blood ran cold in fear and panic. Gradually, the light died down, shrinking to reveal a little boy laying flat on his back, still and quiet.
"Hey, I really do need to get back to work now but I wasn't kidding. I expect to get cute pictures of Jack on a regular basis."
"Sorry, sweetheart. Not interested." Dean set his beer down and turned to face her. She giggled and got even closer, her breath ghosting over his ear.
"Yeah, will do," Dean grunted as Sam walked out the door, shutting it behind him. He turned back towards Cas, still hiding in his nest. Guilt and frustration were mounting in his body and he put his head in his hands, heels pressing against his eyes til he saw stars.
Dean took a second to look over the girl’s shoulder discreetly. There was, in fact, a creepy looking blonde guy, sitting by himself, blatantly staring in their direction.
Jack cooed and reached forward, putting a hand on the girl before Erin could pull him back. He touched her wrist, specifically a patch of skin that looked like it’d had some kind of symbol burnt into it, like a brand. It glowed and disappeared, as well as the blade previously sticking out of her guts, and immediately the girl sat up, eyes wide with fear, chest heaving with unsteady breaths. Erin let out an incredibly undignified yell/scream hybrid and scrambled backwards, startled out of her mind. The girl (zombie? reanimated corpse?) seemed equally horrified, cowering when Erin very hesitantly scooted an inch closer, morbid curiosity quickly overtaking her fear. She curled up, bringing her knees to her chest and raising her hands as she wailed, “No, no no no,
Cognitively, Dean knew she was right. Sometimes for shit to work, you just gotta do what you gotta do. However, Dean had never been one to think with logic over emotions, and he wasn't about to start now.
and I didn't do a fucking thing. You shoulda had a home with me and I fucking kicked you out. I'm so sorry. Cas, I'm so sorry." Cas could barely breathe, Dean was squeezing him so hard. His words were mumbled into the top of Cas's head.
"Hello, Erin."
"Anyways, guess me being extra prepared with the holy oil ended up paying off. I didn't want things to have to come to this, but it looks like you're forcing my hand. I'm gonna give you one more chance to save your sweetheart." Jasmine whipped out the knife from earlier and sauntered over to Dean, placing the tip right under his chin. She twisted around so she could face Cas. "Gimme the nephil's location, or he" she jerked her head towards Dean, "dies in front of you. Your choice, halo."
“B-But it’s so
Another squeeze of his fingers forced Cas to look back up at Dean. Still radiant, still beautiful as ever. Dean exhaled a laugh.
“Oh, Cas,” he whispered sadly. “The Empty’s not here, I promise. I got you out, remember? I came back for you. We got outta there, together.”
Dean could hear his dad saying those words, almost verbatim. Drilled into his mind over years and years of growing up hunting.
Erin's mind put it all together the exact second the doors flew open. Her eyes widened as she beheld the sight in front of her: two grown men, covered head to toe in what appeared to be dirt and blood and soot, the unmistakable scent of smoky fire hanging around them in a thick cloud. Dean strode in first, determination in his step with Cas in tow, basically being dragged behind as he tugged on Dean's sleeve desperately. Cas's trenchcoat was ripped in places, the tears long and jagged and stained with dark red, while Dean sported a smudge of ash on his cheekbone, clothing also tattered and spattered with blood. Erin decided then and there that she never ever wanted to know whatever it was that Dean and Cas did for a living.
"Okay, good. Thank you for making breakfast, by the way. We can go eat in the kitchen." Cas adjusted Jack in his arms and flipped off the lights before leading the way back down the hall. Erin trailed closely behind, placing the toast on the kitchen table while Cas got the baby situated in his high chair.
"As much as I think we all hate to admit it, people talk about you. Recently though, shit's been real quiet, so after I dragged your sorry unconscious ass out here, I really started thinking about it. You and your brother have done a pretty good job of staying under the radar these past few months, which leads me to believe you're hiding something. You Winchesters
"Hey, Jack, remember how last week you had us watch Ratatouille for movie night?" Brows furrowed, Jack nodded slowly. Dean smirked and in one swift motion, swiped Cas off the counter and deposited him on Jack's shoulders, startling a squeak out of both kids.
is what it feels like to have it all. Bliss. Safety. Home.
of them—they’re back, and it’s my fault. It’s my fault.” Dean realizes he’s trembling, and he quickly draws him into his chest, tucks him underneath his chin.
Everyone's head whipped towards the doorway, where Jack stood rubbing his eyes, still in pajamas. He looked about as menacing as a kitten, but when he squared his shoulders and stared at Rowena, Dean could've sworn he felt something in the air change. Rowena's eyes widened, and she seemed equal parts impressed and mildly intimidated.
Cas bursts into tears.
"And everything else you said, it’s not true and you
—and his mouth fell open in shock.
Before Erin could say anything, Dean answered first. “Wait to go inside until I get Cas out. The key’s on the ring but no one’s gonna recognize you, you’ll need to walk in with me.”
"First, I'm going to check on the state of Castiel's grace. Jack told me it had been unstable earlier but has since calmed down, correct?" Dean nodded, walking closer to the table. Cas lifted his head as they approached Rowena, chirping at random pitches with no real intent.
"Thanks, Dean," Cas said shyly, looking up at Dean the same way a flower looks to the sun. His wings flared out behind him, feathers puffing up slightly, and Dean smiled.
"Hey, Cas, you good with some Alex Trebek?" When she didn't get a response, she turned to see Cas sitting cross-legged on the bed, facing a mirror in the corner of the room. He appeared to be staring at his reflection, studying himself as though he was observing a specimen behind the glass. Detached, almost clinical. He looked down at his hands, palms up, flexing his fingers as though he was unfamiliar with using them.
“I’m scared,” Cas admits quietly. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with—with all the power I have. I don’t know the limits of what I am.” He looks down. “You should be scared of me.”
Jack had been unusually quiet ever since Cas left. Suspiciously quiet. No crying, no screaming, not even a whine. To be honest, it was kind of scaring Erin. Meltdowns, she could deal with; this? Not so much. Even lunchtime passed by without a hitch, which
“Alright, here’s your total. Cash or card?” He handed Erin a credit card and she inserted it into the reader.
“What’s up, Jack?” She tilted her chin down, trying to catch a glimpse of his face, and he tilted his head back, looking up at her with those big, trusting blue eyes of his. He babbled but it seemed like he was really trying to say something, genuinely trying to talk to her.
what he thought the Empty would sound like. Actually, nothing about the Empty so far has been what Dean was expecting, but that’s not important. The sphere pulses as the words are emitted, loud and alien and dissonant.
in you, in you and Jack. I love you."
"I heard our angel has had an exciting past couple of days." She reached out a hand towards Cas but Dean immediately blocked it, grabbing her by the wrist.
"You," Cas whispered, "you called me 'babe.' Do you mean it?" He swallowed, his throat suddenly feeling very tight. "Did you mean what you said? Before? About me? About us and Jack?"
The ground disappears from underneath Dean and he’s falling, tumbling headfirst into full-blown panic mode, because holy
"Oh f-crap.
“Of course.” Cas frowns and grabs Dean’s hand, intertwining their fingers. Dean’s pretty sure he loses consciousness for a hot second there.
"Um, Jack? What the hell did Cas just do?" Dean was trying not to freak out because he didn't want Cas to freak out, but he was definitely freaking out a little bit.
Cas flinched. "I'm sorry," he said quickly, quietly, "I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure. I…" he paused, taking a shaky breath. "I wouldn't fault you, you know. If you wanted to take it back. You shouldn't feel pressured to reciprocate." It'd absolutely crush him, of course, but he wouldn't blame Dean. "I never expected you to feel the same way, you don't have to pretend you do. Just—just let me down now, if you're going to. It's okay."
Dean cleared his throat before speaking. "Okay, what's the game plan here?" Both Rowena and Sam turned around quickly, apparently startled by their arrival. Rowena recovered quickly, smoothing the front of her shimmery violet dress.
"You good?"
“Wh—who are you?” Her voice was raspy but not as weak as Erin would’ve expected.
"Can you stand okay?" At this point, Jasmine looked physically fine, but Erin knew she probably still felt pretty weak.
Cas lifted his head and blinked. Once, twice.
“J-Jack. He just fuckin’ showed up out of nowhere and healed the both of us.”
wouldn’t change a thing. Because it’s you, and he loves you, and he wants you, ‘all of you, flaws and all.’ His words, not mine. And you fucking treat him like this in return? You’re sick, Dean, a sick, fucking coward. Not only because you’re cruel, but because you’re a liar. I’ve seen the way you look at Cas. I remember how you acted when he was sick. You were only getting so pissed just now because you care about him. You’re possessive and jealous and afraid of being left so you fucking push him away before he even gets the chance.” She was yelling now, not caring about the late hour or the fact that Cas was right outside.
Tugging on a pair of sweats, Dean quietly opened the door and walked down the hall to Cas's room, just a few doors to the left. He could see Jack's crib from the doorway; Cas insisted they keep the door partially open so they could hear any potential meltdowns. Soft whimpers traveled through the air, and Dean could hear Jack kicking and squirming against the sides. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he shuffled across the room and reached for the baby, trapped under a layer of blankets. Cheeks blotchy and wet, Jack sniffled and looked up at Dean with a quiet hiccup.
"Oh, this is just the sweetest thing," she crooned, leaning over the remaining covers, a little too close for comfort. Dean tightened his arms around Cas and gave her a death glare. Behind her, Sam walked through the door with an apologetic look on his face.
Dean’s not breathing. The world is spinning and they’re outside but he still can’t get enough air and Jesus
(See the end of the chapter for
He squinted at Dean, incredulous, and then his expression softened. Dean looked… nervous? Scared. Terrified. His heart beat rapidly against Cas's hand, splayed on his chest.
"Alright. C'mere, squirt." Cas let himself be scooped up by Dean, eyeing Rowena suspiciously as she approached.
"Alright, let's get you dressed again," Dean said, rifling through the clothes Sam and Jack had bought earlier. He threw some clothes on the bed and sat down next to Cas, gently patting him dry with the towel. His eyes were closed, a weak but content hum resonating in his throat. There was basically zero resistance when Dean put him back in a shirt and pants, a far cry from his behavior earlier.
“Did he say it back?” Holy fuck, someone needed to stop Erin from ever speaking ever again. Castiel grew very still. When he responded, his words sounded a little shaky, a little pained.
"Are… are you insecure about your, uh, nest? Is that what this is about?" he asked, trying to figure out what exactly had Cas acting the way he was.
“Hey, Cas. Want dinner?”
"Cas, can I have my finger back now please? I need it to cook with Dean," Jack asked softly. Cas whined, wings drooping a little. Suddenly, Dean was struck by an idea. He put down the cup of batter carefully.
Dean snorts. “One more time, like it’s not a question.”
Cas sniffled and rubbed his nose. "Okay," he said quietly. "Okay, if you say so."
Dean snorted. There was nothing 'wee' about how much pain Cas had been in, how violently he'd struggled in Dean's arms, how gut-wrenching his screams were. "Yeah, whatever. Do what you have to. You're on a short leash though, real fucking short. If Cas so much as winces, I swear—"
"Tired," he exhaled, eyes already closed. "Lay down with me?"
"Here, let's get you up," he said, extending his arm. Cas grabbed his hand and pushed himself to his feet quickly. He swayed at first, apparently still trying to find his sense of balance. He almost reminded Dean a little bit of a newborn animal, like a deer or a horse. Unsteady and wobbly on its legs, foreign to the sensation of moving in its own body.
“Dude. It’s a song. Alanis Morissette?” Cas squinted then shook his head. “Oh, c’mon, there’s no way you’ve never listened to it.”
“Cas, you gotta wake up," Dean said, louder this time. He tentatively reached over and grabbed Cas’s shoulder, shaking him gently. “C’mon, you’re just having a bad dream.”
"Care to explain how Cas can be both healthy and fractured? Because as far as I know that's not fucking possible."
Instantly Jack's head perked up. "Me! Can I go? I just need a minute, I'm almost done with my picture."
pls ignore the way the final chapter count keeps increasing omg 🙈
"Wha…?"
There was the argument, and then a few days later Erin got Cas's text. This is what happened in between.
"Hey, sweetheart," he whispered, sitting down next to Cas's head. There were little moans and groans of pain being muffled against the mattress, but they quieted somewhat when Dean ran his fingers through Cas's sweaty hair, brushing back the strands sticking to his forehead. "Sam's coming soon, I promise. We're gonna get you fixed up, okay? Get you better again."
This was giving Dean a fat motherfucker of a headache. "Alright. Okay, so what's the bottom line here?"
"What time is it?" Cas asked, blinking groggily.
"I’ve… made some changes, so to speak.”
not Cas.
. He was not prepared to handle this.
me and he would never leave and nobody came to help me and I was all alone and it was scary. I don't want to remember."
. Not Dean's finest hour, that's for sure.
"Okay, I'm not going anywhere." Erin grabbed Cas's hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. He poked his head out from under the comforter, squinting at her before sitting up and shrugging off the blanket altogether.
“Hey.” Sam snapped his fingers in front of Dean’s face. “Do we have any kind of game plan regarding Cas’s grace? I know you said Rowena said his grace would just have to heal on its own, but have you done any research on ways to maybe speed it up?" Dean blinked, taking a second for his brain to catch up.
a bad person. I'm a bad
Instead, there was the unmistakable rustling of a trench coat, accompanied by an odd sort of humming noise, soft and light. He shakily swiveled back towards the portal, still on his knees, and found himself staring at the coat in a heap on the floor. No Cas.
"It's okay, Jack. It can be hard to tell what people actually mean sometimes. Cas still takes some stuff at face value and he's been here for…" Sam paused, "a decade? Yeah, close to a decade. You'll get the hang of it."
You couldn't lay a finger on me if you tried." There was a slight pause before Jasmine spoke again.
It takes a second but eventually Dean gets it. He knows Cas has never forgiven himself for his time playing God, for releasing the Leviathan, everything that followed in the terrible aftermath.
. All this and it wasn't even 7am yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright, thanks for the input. Could you actually grab me the other salt shaker? It's in the left cabinet, with the onion powder and dried oregano."
“You wanna know the first thing I did, after he saved me from Hell? I
“Balthazar and I worked together on the Ursas, and I designed Canis Major and Minor myself.” He sits up a little bit, points to a section of the sky. “See? There’s Procyon, one of the stars in Canis Minor, or Little Dog, as it’s known colloquially. And that over there”—he shifts a bit to the right—“that’s Orion’s Belt.”
“Cas, I, uh—Ireallywannakissyourightnow.” Dean cringes, because
anyways as always thank u for reading!!! it's been kind of a shitty week so nice comments are v much appreciated rn :D also if u have any suggestions or ideas u would like to see happen in the future lmk i rly love hearing from yall!!
were the dream, that you never came back for me, that I was gonna be stuck there forever.” Cas faltered, sniffled. “It said that you—you don’t love me. That I’m stupid for thinking anything different. It’s wrong though, right?” He sniffled again. “Right?”
"That can be folded, as well as any other shirt," Cas responded, carrying in another basket of laundry. He dumped the clothes on the unmade bed before flopping into it himself, sprawled on the mattress. Erin suppressed a laugh.
"You know, one of my only friends was originally a fierce enemy of Dean's. She was my enemy too, but when Dean left…" He trailed off. "When he left, she ended up being the only one really there for me. My only friend. She'd pretend we weren't, of course, but I knew she liked me. She took care of me when no one else would," he said fondly. There was a heavy kind of sadness in his face when Cas smiled.
“Oh. Then good morning to you too, sunshine.”
(fondly exasperated,
Mild confusion clouded Erin’s brain. So clearly Castiel is deeply, hopelessly in love, but he and Dean
It’s hard to see with just the light of the moon, but Dean thinks he barely catches Cas blushing. “No, but it is a rather spectacular coincidence. Perhaps I have been unknowingly adding a signature to my work.” His voice is so fond, so uncharacteristically shy, and Dean can’t stop thinking about how much he doesn’t want this to end. He hears Sam in his head again, like a message from the gods—
“Shh, it’s okay, you’re safe, I got you,” Dean tried to gently reassure Cas, covering his tiny hands with his own. He had no idea whether Cas could even understand anything he was saying. Cas maintained eye contact, looking as though he was silently pleading Dean to read his mind. God, it was hard to look at. Dean was at a total loss. “Cas, do you hear me? Can you talk to me?”
Castiel gave her a tired half-smile. “Well, I can’t deny that he can be… difficult in the mornings. I've told him he wakes up like an angry bear, but it’s not really his fault. He sacrifices a lot of sleep doing extra work and research, trying to protect people even when it’s at his expense. He cares an extraordinary amount about others. Dean’s the most selfless, loving person I will ever know. I’m only able to care as much as I do because he taught me how.”
Dean tried to wrap his head around what Rowena said. "So what I'm hearing is the Empty put Cas's grace through a strainer?"
Cas nodded, albeit slowly. They'd migrated from the map table to the kitchen so Sam could brew some coffee. Dean was leaning against the counter, facing Jack, who sat on the table bench, and Cas, who'd foregone the bench entirely and climbed onto the table itself. He swung his legs over the edge, kicking his feet back and forth.
No one said anything for a few moments. Cas was the one to break the silence, of course, squeezing Dean's hand with a softly murmured "Dee?" He squeezed back wordlessly, waiting for Sam and Jack to say something. Rationally he knew they wouldn't react with anything other than total understanding, but he still couldn't help bracing himself for judgment, disgust, ridicule. This was the most he’d opened up in years, probably the most emotionally vulnerable he’s ever been, in the history of ever. For a moment Dean wondered if all of Cas’s grace he’d used in the past few days was healing some of the effects of his trauma, a lifetime of steaming shit piled on top of more shit.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Shut up, Sammy. He doesn't even talk." He stood up from his crouching stance, bracing for his knees to pop like they always do now, but the creaky joint pain he was expecting never hit him. Instead, he felt Cas slap a palm on each knee and send out a surge of grace, easing his bones. He almost fell over in surprise.
So Castiel lets himself be flipped over, splayed out underneath Dean on his back like some wounded animal exposing its vulnerable underbelly. Dean swiftly removes the blade from his coat and raises it high, parallel to his shoulders, poised above Castiel like Abraham’s knife above Isaac. He wonders briefly how many of his brothers and sisters died this exact same way, killed by their own weapon, their own Grace. All their deaths are his fault, Castiel knows. Angels didn’t die, not until the Apocalypse happened, not until he slaughtered half of Heaven single-handedly. And now here he is, waiting for redemption in being killed, staring at Abraham's knife.
"Yeah, I know, I know. It's just," Dean floundered for a second, "just really hard to drop hunting, go total hands off, y'know? Like I can't see something
“Yeah, uh, you too,” she said, wincing as the words fell out of her mouth. God, she felt so awkward. Thankfully, Sam quickly diverted his attention back to Dean and Cas, walking over to meet them as they reached the bottom of the stairs.
"Be safe, okay? I don't really know what exactly it is you're getting yourself into, but you better make it back here in one piece." She gave Cas a stern look, and he smiled weakly before giving her a quick hug.
badly. It's
That was all Cas needed to fling his arms around Dean, latching on tight like some baby animal to its mother. Violent sobs wracked his body as he curled into Dean, wings jerking against his back with each cry.
Rowena gave Dean an exasperated look and rolled her eyes. "Don't twist my words, dearie, you know I meant no harm. Anyways, not that I don't immensely enjoy my time with you boys, but I do have other matters to attend to, if my services are no longer necessary?"
you and you—you—” He burst into tears and fell to his knees, crumpling in on himself like a broken doll.
. They continued to sit there, frozen in time: Dean struck dumb on his knees, eye level with a pint-sized Angel of the Lord. Cas was basically in Dean’s lap at this point, one chubby hand still grasping Dean’s shoulder, causing flecks of dried blood to fall from the imprint on the jacket. The trench coat had settled around Cas like a blanket, draping from his shoulders and swamping him in a sea of tan folds. His other hand had somehow fisted itself in Dean’s shirt without him even noticing, and it was only then that Dean realized Cas was trembling ever so slightly.
"Cas?" he asks again, because he's still scared this is too good to be true. He's lifting a finger to Cas's cheek and he's so fucking terrified he'll somehow pass through him, like a projected illusion. Just a trick of the light, just an array of electromagnetic wavelengths manipulated specifically to drive Dean insane.
"No. I'm done, Dean. I don't want to hear it. If you're going to go, just go. I won't stop you." He scooped out a heaping spoonful of orange baby food, accepted hungrily by a squealing Jack.
Taking a deep shuddering breath, Dean leaned back further against Cas, going limp in his arms. Fingers began running through his sandy hair, and he absolutely melted into the touch, exhaling a sigh. "Shh, that's it. Go to sleep, love. I'll watch over you," Cas murmured into his ear. Dean smiled weakly; he just realized that Cas was behaving the exact same way Dean had acted with Jack earlier, holding him and speaking soft reassurances. Normally he'd be slightly annoyed he was receiving the same treatment as a literal baby, but at this point he was too exhausted to give a fuck. Lulled by Cas's light rocking side-to-side, grounded by the arms around his chest, Dean's eyelids finally grew too heavy to keep open. He drifted to sleep, dreams filled with warmth and safety and blue eyes.
you, and you are
"But I used to be… more. I had skills, abilities that I've lost over the years since meeting Dean. He blames himself for my 'fall from glory,' so to speak. Would I still have them if I'd never met Dean? Yes. But it's not his fault. I
“Yeah, dude,” Dean said lightly. He gave Cas’s shoulder a little nudge before sticking out his hand, raising his pinky above the rest of his fingers.
(distressed, frightened, pleading). Cas tightened his hold on Dean even more, pressing his face into his chest. He acted like if he tried hard enough, they'd become physically inseparable. Dean sighed.
"If I have to take care of him while he's crying, again, I will definitely be joining him, and I don't know if I'll be able to make myself stop. Please, I need you to take over, just for right now."
, at least not to his brother. He tried to look down at Cas, but the awkward angle made him difficult to see. He suddenly felt exhausted, the full weight of the day just now hitting him.
Alas, no such luck.
"Oh," he breathed, "oh shit, I'm really sorry." He looked from Erin to Jasmine, concern and guilt flashing across his face. "How're you holding up? I know…" He swallowed. "I know you probably think you're crazy and that no one will believe you, but you're not. Demons are real, and you were legitimately possessed by one, but you're safe now."
"Dee?" And there it is again. Dean nodded with an affirmative grunt, feeling entirely too fragile. He stilled when Cas wrapped his arms around his neck, hooking his chin over his shaking shoulder.
"Mmm."
Cas shrugged, resolutely focused on his thumbs. "I dunno," he mumbled. "Cuz I'm using all your stuff and your bed and I didn't even ask first."
Cas kissed him one more time before pulling away and holding him out towards Erin. He whined as he passed from one pair of arms to the next, but he allowed Erin to position him against her chest without bursting into tears, which she figured was a good sign.
didn't hit him like a sucker punch.
"No, his grace replenishes itself. Because it's undamaged and whole at the moment, his 'supply' so to speak is essentially infinite."
“Promise?” Cas’s voice was quiet and steady, but his wings fluttered nervously at his sides. He wouldn’t look up at Dean, hands anxiously fidgeting with one of the towels in his lap.
Cas is looking at him with tears in his eyes, and Dean has to swallow back a scream, push down the urge to vomit, because he’s only seen Cas like that a few times. The last time it got him dead.
“That’s my angel,” he said softly. Cas’s hair was slick with sweat but it didn’t stop Dean from kissing the top of his head anyways. The bed sagged underneath Dean’s weight as he clambered back onto the mattress, situating himself behind Cas. Reluctantly, he picked up the needle again, eyeing it with disdain.
wanted.
but on the other, he had really been hoping for adult Cas to blip back into existence. He exhaled shakily and stood up.
"If you don't mind, that'd be nice, actually. It's just on the nightstand in my room, next to the bed."
Well damn. That seriously might've been one of the most weirdly heartfelt things anyone had ever told Erin. She was genuinely really touched.
“Jesus,” she breathed, beginning to feel unsettled. That was… weird. Really weird. And then she noticed Jack had gone totally silent, and her heart stopped. She quickly pulled away from where she’d been clutching him to her body, terrified that he’d actually passed out from crying too hard, but she was met with wide blue eyes, just staring at her.
"Whew, I really got you boys there, huh? Wish you could've seen the looks on your faces." Jasmine raised her arm and turned it so they could see the inside of her wrist, where some kind of brand had been burnt into her skin.
Dean."
“Actually, I think you may have just changed my mind. What’s your name?” Dean flashed her a smile and she exhaled in relief, giving him an extremely grateful look.
scared of being rejected, he can already feel the bile flooding his throat. But Cas is looking at him with soft blue eyes, eyes that have seen the mysteries of the universe and still find Dean to be something worth seeing, eyes that searched for Dean in Hell and found something worth saving, and he thinks maybe this time he can be brave. For Sam.
I thought I
Cas's lip began trembling and he sniffled lightly. "Dean," he began, voice hoarse. He tried to say more but ended up just floundering, overwhelmed.

“Yeah, that makes sense. Have you talked to Dean or Sam about it?” Castiel shook his head.
"I'm sorry, I know that was hard but you did really good. I'm proud of you for sitting through it," Dean said quietly, rubbing small circles into Cas’s back with the heel of his palm. Cas responded with a tired hum and went totally pliant as he let himself get wrapped up in the fluffiest towel Dean could find. He set Cas on the ground for just a second as he took off his own sopping shirt, drying his chest off quickly before scooping Cas back up.
"He's been crying all day. All day. And it's been like that ever since Dean left." Cas exhaled shakily and shut his eyes like he was trying to block the rest of the world out. Like if he couldn't see it, it didn't exist. Erin just continued to rub small circles against his back, not sure what else she could do to help.
It took another five minutes of coaxing and reassurances, but they finally got Cas to unglue himself from Dean. Reluctantly, he shimmied off Dean’s lap and sat next to him, releasing Jack’s finger with a few disgruntled chirps. He kept himself pressed against Dean’s side, holding Dean's arm hostage as he hooked his own tiny arm around it. Still not ideal, but honestly Dean was just happy to have his lap free again. He’d started losing feeling in his thighs.
“You read my mind, baby. Lead the way.” Jasmine quickly grabbed his hand and they exited the building, Dean keeping an eye on the supposed stalker. After a minute of crossing the parking lot, she stopped in front of a little red car and unlocked it before turning to look back.
There’s only so much a person can take. Helping Cas had definitely given her a metric fuck ton of respect for new parents.
Cas’s eyes shot open, and he found himself surrounded by inky black. Pure darkness, suspended in nothingness. A kind of coldness that only exists in an abyss, in the void. Cas’s chest went numb as he realized where he was, the echo of the voice rattling around in the silence.
Dean just knew his face was turning red as a tomato. "A lot. And I'm really happy you want this. You're so good for Jack, you know? He deserves more than just me as a parent, and you do so well with him. It just…" he paused, voice hoarse. "It just makes me happy. You make me really happy and I love you, I love you so much it overwhelms me." Dean felt himself going stiff, his brain overloading with everything Cas was saying about him.
Immediately her mood brightened a bit; Castiel was a quirky motherfucker, and that’s putting it lightly, but there was something strangely endearing about him. Erin had seen him a couple times since their first interaction. They would say hi to each other, chat for a minute if business was slow (and it typically was), and  after a few conversations she'd realized she actually really liked talking with him. Castiel was just so genuinely earnest, so sincere. It’s like he had no sense of obligation to cater to social norms, no constructed persona he was trying to project. Erin definitely felt like every day was a performance on her part; she wasn’t inauthentic per se, but there was a purposefully crafted identity she had created to present to the world. Castiel just seemed like he didn’t give a shit about what the world saw in him, and his lack of inhibition was refreshing, if not a little off-putting.
“Don’t you understand? You were never there. You were never saved. And you’re never going to be saved.” An ugly hiss boomed through the void, a sound Cas recognized to be the Empty’s disturbing laughter.
"I got it from here. You go take a nap or some shit, okay? I swear you're a few seconds away from straight up collapsing," Erin teased as she scooped up a squirming Jack. Honest to God, Cas looked so relieved and grateful, she was genuinely a little scared he might faint on the spot.
Erin watched as he read whatever Dean had sent, waiting to see his face light up. Instead, she saw the blood physically draining from Cas's face, leaving him pale as a ghost.
"Be good for Erin, honey." Cas yanked his trusty trenchcoat from the metal hook by the door and shrugged it over his shoulders. It looked ridiculous over his worn gray sweatpants and what was clearly Dean's black t-shirt, designed like the movie poster for
Dean opened his mouth to speak but Erin beat him to it, still maintaining eye contact with Cas, a wicked grin on her face. “Hi, Cas. You want your regular?”
Out of nowhere, a weight dropped on his shoulders. Two little feet appeared on each side of his head, and he looked over at Jack to see him turning off the song before flipping the last batch, currently Cas-less. A tiny hand splayed out on Dean's forehead, and feathers brushed over his right cheek. He swallowed.
A persistent poking in his side pulled Dean back from his thoughts. Cas had shifted out of Dean's lap to grab his picture and was now butting his head against Dean, humming impatiently.
It took a second for Sam to connect the dots, but once he did, his face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Oh my god. Oh my
insult me by devaluing yourself. You deserve all the love I bestow on you and more." Cas reached for Dean's shaking hands, holding them reverently in both of his.
"Hmm. Do you think Morissette would say that's ironic?" Erin boggled at him, mouth hanging open just a tad. Then she snorted, swatting Cas's arm.
Cas startled where he stood by the crib, whipping his head around to see Erin in the doorway. "Oh, good morning. I hope we didn't wake you up," Cas said apologetically, motioning towards Jack with his head. "He calmed down a few minutes ago but I'm sure you heard him earlier. It's been a rough few days for him." He looked down at his baby, lightly bouncing him against his chest.
"Okay, I'll be back soon. Thank you, Erin. I know you'll take good care of him." And with that, Cas was gone.
did not want to take a cold bath, but if that's the only way Cas would get in then so be it.
Rowena rolled her eyes as she curled her hand around the cup. "Oh, hush. That's because this spell is very, very simple and very,
a part of me that’s a little angry, even though I
"No way to tell, dear." That's it. He was going to be sick. "However, some part of Castiel has to know you. You possess a teeny-tiny sliver of his grace."
He could
The guy asked for four drinks: one black coffee, one iced latte, one iced matcha, one Very Berry Hibiscus drink. Kinda annoying that they weren’t all similar to make but whatever. Just this one last customer and Erin would be home free.
Even though all Dean wanted to do was close his eyes and melt back into Cas’s touch, he forced himself to sit up. Cas frowned and chirped with disapproval but helped push him upright anyways, his tiny body supporting the majority of Dean’s weight. He groaned, eyes shut tight as he tried to remember what exactly had happened. They were drawing, then Cas had a mini freak out, then he did a weird overwhelming mojo thing to Dean, then he tried to say Dean's name, then all these events culminated in Dean breaking down so bad he passed out in the middle of a crying session…? Yeah, unfortunately that sounded right.
Dean began to slowly rock side to side, just barely moving. "
as Erin dug around the kitchen cabinets for some plates. She took a few and returned to the toaster, carefully extracting the slices so as not to burn her fingertips. The lids on the jam and jelly jars stuck stubbornly to the glass rim and took more effort to open than Erin would ever admit, but eventually she got them screwed off and plopped heaping spoonfuls of the preserves onto the bread. Strawberry jam for her, grape jelly for Cas, and a container of sweet potato mush for Jack.
A few more minutes of quiet singing and Cas was out like a sack of potatoes, slumped against Dean’s shoulder. Dean himself was starting to nod off too when someone opened his door. Light from the hallway streamed through the crack, and he could tell from the shadow that it was Jack.
"I'll be right back, sweetheart." True to his word, Dean took all of two minutes running to the kitchen to grab a water bottle and a small towel, stopping at the sink to get the towel damp before returning to his room. He kneeled at the side of the bed, putting himself at eye level with Cas.
“did you just fuckin’, like, reoxygenate me through my face?”
him, and I was a goner. Even then, he somehow knew I had a weak spot for him, couldn't tell him no."
kinda sound than anything else.
"Um, can I have chicken tenders, please?" He smiled at her, all boyish charm. Dean knew that physically Jack was in his early twenties, but sometimes it definitely showed that he was really only a few years old.
“Okay, um, your total today adds up to $15.37. Cash or card?” Erin tried to look normal as Castiel opened his wallet and fished out a couple bills. She could feel him staring at her as she counted out the change, the metal coins cool in her palm.
The question tore through Dean like a hurricane just making landfall, shredding his insides into tatters and strips, raw and sensitive and soaked in acidity. He barely had time to choke out a "Sam, I—" before tearing himself away from Cas in pursuit of the nearest trash can. Or toilet. Either one worked.
me,” Erin whispered, relieved she hadn’t accidentally suffocated him or let him scream himself to death. “Not that I’m ungrateful for the quiet, but give a girl a little warning next time, please?”
Cas just shook his head, whimpering as he put his face in Dean’s neck again. “I-I wanna believe. I wanna believe but I don’t know. I can see your soul, and it looks right, but what if it’s a trick? What if the Empty knows how to fake it?”
“Just—” He inhaled deeply. “Just bring him home safe, okay? And you, too. No funny business up in the air, no sight-seeing, no detours.”
“Okay, Dean.” Jack rolled his eyes but he was smiling, clearly amused by Dean’s overbearing antics. He gave him one last thumbs up, unfurled his invisible wings, and just like that, Dean was alone again.
Before Erin could get up, a hand shot out of the bunched up blanket and circled her wrist, yanking her back down.
"Alright kiddos, who wants to help pour the batter in the pan?" Jack's head swiveled back over to Dean, ears perking up.
that noise. He has no idea what the hell kinda game the Empty is trying to play, but he’s not in the mood. "Shut
“Sweetpea, you know I can’t understand you,” she sighed. Jack closed his mouth and squinted at Erin, and a second later she felt some kind of tugging—actually, no, it was less like being pulled and more like being pushed, propelled forward by some unseen force. She stumbled forward in shock and stopped about a foot away from the presumably dead girl; Erin didn’t know much about injuries but even she knew that your spine is
"Can't—can't get better," he gasped, like every word was a Herculean feat. Dean's blood ran ice cold. "Never g-gonna get it back. Burnt through it all."
your fault.” She stood up from the floor and gently plopped down next to Cas on the bed. The mattress dipped from all the weight in the middle, putting the precariously stacked piles of laundry in danger of tipping.
"And three," Jasmine lifts her ring finger, "you've been out cold for over a day. You'd think it's been longer given the amount of concerned texts you've gotten, though. Clingy girlfriend much?" She motioned over to a small table against the wall, where Dean's gun, demon knife, wallet, keys, and phone were all resting. His heart took a nosedive thinking about the messages he'd left unopened even before getting kidnapped.
let me go back, stop it—”
Dean had to swallow the lump rising in his throat before going on to "

Erin gave him a half smile. “We’re cool. Don’t worry about it. What are you getting today?”
Shirt still lifted up, Dean brushed his fingers over the agitated wounds, light as a feather. They were hot to the touch; again, not a good sign. Cas hissed and shuddered at the contact, digging his fingers into Dean's shoulders. If he was at all phased by the physical nature of his wings, he didn't show it.
"Hey." The fingers were back in his hair. "You don't need to hide, Cas. It's nothing bad, I swear. I still…" Cas could feel Dean's chest expand and deflate, slow and measured. "I still love you, okay? That's not what I wanna talk about." Another breath. "I just—I just need to know if you were serious. About the house. Did you really find something?"
Erin could only gape at Castiel. Holy shit. Somehow, in attempting to get the conversation to lighten the fuck up, she had managed to make it infinitely heavier.
"It's—it's fine, Erin. Thank you for making me dinner." Cas picked up his spoon but still kept looking into the soup, searching the noodle letters like they held the answers to all his problems. "Dean makes good soup, you know," he said slowly. "We had spicy tomato basil the night before he left. It was a new recipe."
“Yeah, okay, maybe, but if he can only say one word does that really count as speech acquisition? I don’t know how much of a breakthrough we can legitimately consider that,” Dean said back. “Either way, it probably is a good idea to get in touch with Rowena, if you wanna text her and let her know. Maybe she’s finally got a spell or somethin’ we can use.” He exhaled loudly, suddenly feeling very tired again. Cas was starting to fall asleep on him, little fists wrapped in his worn shirt.
Rowena looked at Dean sadly. "I'm sorry dear, but I think Castiel's grace just needs time to mend the bonds holding it together. I suspect the reconnecting of his grace will restore him to his proper vessel, hopefully memories intact as well. His grace is pure so it should be able to repair itself adequately. Until then, it seems the only thing to do is wait."
“Nope. That’s it.”
"Is there anything else I can do to help?" Sam asked, eyeing them with a mix of sympathy, pity, and concern.
), both of them were too exhausted from hunting and talking to do anything more than fall asleep. Jack was already sleeping in his crib when they finally came in from the garage, leaving them free to just change and slide under the covers.
“Okay,” he said quietly. “I believe you.” Dean knew he should probably say something too but he really didn’t feel capable of coherent speech at the moment, so he kept his face buried. Cas poked his chest. “Dee.” He shook his head against him, still refusing to speak.
All Cas does is fit his hand to Dean’s bicep, and it’s enough to make him cry. He goes weak in the knees, half-collapsing onto Cas, who doesn't bend an inch under his weight.
"Yay, you finally whipped it out! Whole lotta good that does you from inside the circle though, hmm?"
It took a few minutes of struggling but Dean managed to get back on his feet, swaying a bit under Cas’s weight. He held him in a bridal carry, turned slightly inwards to Dean’s chest, head protectively tucked in Dean’s neck, under his chin, safe and warm and familiar. Cas’s body was still white and shaky, and he let out a quiet whimper every time Dean’s arms touched the burning skin surrounding the open cuts marring his back. Dean just clenched his jaw and readjusted Cas the best he could, whispering to him as he walked carefully, doing everything he could to keep Cas from hurting. Erin could tell Dean was trying to be strong, trying to keep it together, but he couldn’t hide the way he was blinking a little too rapidly, chewing on his lip a little too much.
"Cas? What's wrong?" Dean looked back down at Jack in mild alarm, not quite sure what he was missing that had Cas so distressed. Distracted, he was nearly knocked over by Cas, who had launched himself at Dean in what must've been the most aggressive hug in history. It was like being attacked by a boa constrictor, or maybe a very angry koala.
Clearly sensing a change, Cas ducked his head and tensed up, averting his eyes. "Sorry, I know hearing this makes you uncomfortable but I had to say it. That's how I feel and you deserve to hear it," he whispered. Dean could tell he was bracing himself for a negative reaction; seeing him expect Dean to be upset felt like a punch to the gut. Goddammit.
The second Dean tried to pull themselves apart, Cas shrieked so loudly the mirror above the sink cracked, hairline fractures streaking diagonally across the glass. "Goddammit, Cas, we don't have time for this."
you anymore?"
“Cas? What the hell is she talking about?” Dean demanded, Cas shrinking away from him.
“Sammy? Jack?” Cas startled as Dean yelled for his brother and the kid, jerking in his arms. Oops. Dean readjusted and held Cas tighter until he stopped squirming, trying to soothe him by whispering quiet nonsense against the top of his head.
“Morning, sunshine.”
Dean snorted.
Can't help envying the thick, ruined tome, can't help wishing his own blade had nestled itself between his ribs rather than between those dusty pages.
Dean clenched his jaw and nodded, continuing to work as swiftly as he could. Heat radiated from the wounds on Cas’s back, hot and red and angry. Back and forth he threaded the skin, stitching the flesh back together, closing the deep gashes as best he could. By the time he finished patching up the first cut, Cas’s face was gleaming with sweat and tears, his cheeks colored an unnatural shade of greenish-grey. Honestly, he looked like he was going to be sick.
“Dean, I think we should just go home. I'm tired and we're filthy and Jack's waiting for us and—”
He could feel the blood draining from his face. Fuck, he didn't think anyone else had really known what happened. No one alive, anyways.
“He’s so… pure, more beautiful than anything else in all of creation. He is worth everything to me. If I could just make him see himself through my eyes, I could make him understand. It’s so obvious too, everyone can see how good Dean is, how loving, and he just refuses to accept it. It breaks my heart.” His lip wobbled slightly.
"What's wrong, Dean?" Then he noticed a certain someone's absence. His eyes went wide. "Where's Cas?"
You really couldn't make this shit up.
"He said the job was only a few hours away. It should've taken him a day, tops, but we'd had an argument before he left so I expected he'd probably take longer coming back. No more than a couple extra days, though, and even then he's supposed to check in." He sniffled, nose brushing against Erin's shirt.
let Cas get roped into this.
"Minutes later, I chose him over everything I'd ever known, and it changed my life. No going back. Everything that's happened since then has been a result of that choice. Choosing Dean was my first act of free will." He sniffed, rubbing at his nose. "In a way, I guess you could call that the beginning of the end for me."
The truth is it’s a revelation. It’s breaking free. It’s too much, it’s wholly overwhelming, it’s drowning in the shallow end of the neighborhood pool. More than anything, it’s coming home. Finally coming home.
How was Dean supposed to resist
"Look, I don't like this any more than you do, okay? I hate that we're doing this, actually, but I'm worried about you and this will hopefully help. I need you to work with me. Please." Something about his tone must've gotten through to Cas, because after a moment he stilled and went quiet.
Dean swaggered up to the counter, Cas still trailing behind. Erin made eye contact with Cas, who looked at her like a deer in headlights. She'd never seen someone look so frightened before, and she could see his eyes practically begging her not to say anything indicating they knew each other. Poor thing. Dean really had no fucking idea.
of a taste of freedom, over and over, only to wake you up and throw you back into the horror of reality again. Your pain will be utterly exquisite. I’m quite looking forward to it."
Then Dean was in a warehouse, dead copies of himself littering the floor. Hundreds, maybe thousands, all lying lifeless on the ground. He heard a voice booming, "Again, Castiel. Do it again," and he looked at his hands. The right was gripping an angel blade, the left held a pseudo-Dean by the collar. He felt his mouth open, whispering, "I can't. Please, I can't do it anymore. Stop making me hurt him,
You are
"That's okay, beloved. We'll make it up as we go."
. She didn’t even know the guy and she felt like she could compile an entire list of evidence suggesting otherwise just based on what she knew from Cas. Take this instance: Dean LITERALLY called him an angel, and not just
"Alright. Guess we just need to keep an eye on him for now."
"Cas, I don't care what it looks like. The fact that it's
"Agreed," Cas conceded with an odd little grin. "And believe me, I've had enough legitimate mental breakdowns to know. You truly don't know who your real friends are until you've been certifiably insane at least once." Erin waited for him to wink or something, but he never did, which, uh,
"Dang, these look like they might even be better than Dean's," Sam said, smirking.
"Fuck. Okay, I promised Cas I wouldn't tell you any of this shit and truthfully I don't think you deserve to hear it but you're being so incredibly obtuse I don't know how else to get through to you. God, the way he talks about you," Erin closed her eyes for a second, "it's fucking indescribable, how much he loves you." Dean flinched. A sick, vindictive part of her enjoyed it.
Jack looked up from the pan and smiled, Cas tugging lightly on his ears. "Oh! This is the Man song from Mulan!" He began humming along, eyes returning to the pancakes. Dean was unfamiliar with the song but he also had to begrudgingly admit it wasn't half bad.
He was greeted in the kitchen by Jack’s smile, warm and bright, and Cas's back, stiff, cold. Dismissive and uninviting. Babbles and coos filled the air but did nothing to relieve the tension buzzing through the room. Cas's measured breaths were just barely audible, each one shaky despite their steady rhythm.
Well. Definitely not Zepp, but Dean couldn't say no to the kid. "Alright, gimme a sec to pull it up." A minute later, the kitchen was filled with the sounds of Mandy Moore and acoustic guitar.
i'm kinda nervous abt this chapter eee 🙈 but here ya go hope yall like it! also. if u saw me post this on accident two days ago no u didn’t <3
“Yeah, he finally cooled down, stopped sweating and shaking too. Still don’t know why it happened but I’m glad it seems to be over, at least for the moment.” Dean frowned. “He’s somehow become afraid of the dark, though. I don’t know why, but when I tried to turn off the lights he freaked. He even said ‘no,’ which is now the only thing he’s said besides my name.”
And his heart stops, because the voice isn’t right, the pitch isn’t the same, but the cadence is unmistakable. Reverence, adoration, devotion.
"Fuck, that's painful," Erin cursed, and to her surprise and delight, Jasmine giggled. Even more of the fear and uneasiness between them dissolved away, and she couldn't help the way her heart felt a million times lighter.
