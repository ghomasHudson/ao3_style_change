“Depends,” he said, and Dean felt his own eyebrows raise. He looked at the bartender properly for once—at his scruffy gray henley, the heavy black apron he wore over it; the carefully tied string around the waist. The way his forearms flexed at the towel he gripped between both hands. When his eyes made their way back up to meet the bartender’s, the man’s eyes were dark and steady, like he was just watching and waiting for Dean to make up his mind.
He didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. When he did, it was like his dreams were a cold set of sheets that someone kept tugging away in the night. There and then gone, waking him up with a feeling of loss he couldn’t quite pin down.
Castiel watched him march around gruffly, knowing that despite his tough-guy act, he would end up the same way the next time he slept next to Castiel.
Dean took another step, making it to the floor. Human? His mind raced, a thousand different thoughts bottlenecking together.
Only twice has someone said anything to him about the pictures- the first time a waitress tapped him lightly on the shoulder and asked if he was a journalist, and the second time a pot-bellied man eating a cheeseburger tried to shove him against a wall and tell him that he had not agreed to have his picture taken. Castiel had disappeared immediately, and the echo of an image of the man gasping lingered in his mind as he slipped into a broom closet of a new Biggerson's.
When Dean finally surrendered her back to her parents, his hands were shaking and he went out into the hall.
Had Cas ever had rhubarb pie when he was human? Dean couldn’t remember ever giving him any, and it wasn’t likely he’d have gone off and found some pie on his own.
Cas watched him carefully. Sometimes Dean felt like he was a long-running experiment of Cas’s. See how humanity ticks.
Dean waited expectantly for a minute before sighing and trying again. “Cas, seriously. I know someone intervened here; Benny was dead-dead. Beyond purgatory dead. Out of existence dead.”
Benny nodded. “I’ll be around. Any time you need backup on a hunt, especially. Wouldn’t want you scratchin’ that pretty face of yours.”
Cas’s face shuttered into a distant, cold expression, and he nodded slightly and turned towards the pile of discarded clothes on the floor, his shoulders tight.
It was like weights slipped from Dean’s shoulders; ropes untwined from his heels. He stumbled forward, reaching for Cas with hands whose course felt as familiar as breathing. He clutched at Cas’s coat, breathing heavily.
“What the fuck,” he muttered, pulling at the rope, and suddenly hands were on him, dragging him down, and the fabric around him was gone in a series of hard tugs and pulls.
“Shut up,” Dean said, rolling his eyes. He should’ve known this was how it would go with Sam. The guy was like a walking ‘keep hanging in there’ kitten poster half the time. Supportive, but in a useless, cringy sort of way.
Dean rounds the corner and gapes at him. The lights snap on- Castiel sees the larger man at the wall by the door, fiddling with the circuit breaker that is usually hidden underneath a wallpaper covered panel.
“Above your head,” Cas said, and his hands suddenly dropped away as he stood up straight again. “Grab the sheets—like that.
He'd happened into a Biggerson's by accident the first time. He'd messed up, landing there instead of on top of the Statue of Liberty, and as he had his camera out already, to take a picture of the New York skyline, he pushed his finger down and snapped a picture before realizing where he was. He flicked away from that restaurant quickly, and glanced down at his camera once he was safely in a hotel room, and found that in the very center of the photograph, a man stared straight into the lens. Not any man- not an ugly man, not a plain man, not even an ordinary man, but an immaculate man. Castiel had never experienced any kind of attraction, or even pleasant observance, of any man or woman until that moment. The man glared out of the picture, unknowingly centering himself in the photograph and suddenly in Castiel's life.
“In another life, I think we would’ve gotten along, Dean,” she said, not unkindly. She patted his shoulder, like she thought he was a sad kid in need of comforting, and walked away, shrugging her jacket on as she went.
in Cas’s eyes, wanted to see something colder and hotter all at once, something angry and demeaning and calculating. He couldn’t name it, he couldn’t even see it half the time for all the burning fury it created, for all the hollow cold it forged that festered in his limbs and made him cringe from the flirtatious reach of blonde twenty-somethings at bars.
Somehow, the thing Dean lingered on the most about that trip to the future—more than who Dean had become, more than the way things unfolded—was that version of Cas. Was it Zachariah’s idea of a joke? ‘Look at this angel who lowers himself to respecting humans, this is how I see him? This is what he will become?’ Or was it a real future, the way the past Dean had seen a few times was real? Could
Dean stumbled, his feet still caught in shreds of fabric, and he caught himself against what felt like wood. A pyre, he realized, twisting around to see what it was he’d been dragged off.
The wedding was the only thing it could be: sappy as hell. And Dean stood there and watched and tried not to let that bitter little part of him surge up in his chest and sour any of it.
“Oh, god,” Dean muttered, throwing his head to the side. Some small, still-thinking-coherently corner of his brain fixated briefly on the bedroom door that hung open and said
Dean shifted, pulling at the threads at the edges of his jeans as Thomas peeled his shirt off again and slowly sat on the other side of the bed.
There are police records the author found of both boys- Dean has been arrested for attacking a woman, there are records of Dean's death, followed by records of his arrest for murdering a woman, along with Sam for suspected association, the arrests from which they suspiciously escaped and a police officer named Diane was accused of releasing them, Dean has several other charges- mail fraud, credit card fraud, grave desecration, breaking and entering, armed robbery, kidnapping, and an extra murder count. Castiel is confused by the whole list, and barely can comprehend the time-line that the author presents.  Castiel goes back to the search page that the helpful boy had pulled up, and a new news story about the boys has appeared, announcing that they have murdered more people.
“Well, uh, anyone want a beer?” Dean asked. “And I’m going to tell the others they don’t need to hide outside, unless you want to get any punches in first, Charlie?”
“That’s not the point. I’m over it. Me killing my best friend because I...yeah. What else is new, right?” He took a swig of beer and wished it was something stronger. “He’s back. He’s alive, Jack brought him back. And he hasn’t even...he hasn’t even visited. Hasn’t even decided to drop by.”
“Oh,” she says, shoving him into the wall. Deep blackness suddenly pools over her eyes, and she bares her teeth. “What are you doing down here, filthy thing?”
Dean showered the feeling of a long drive off, letting the water burn at his skin and soaping up over and over and over again until his flesh was pink and almost tacky with the lingering feeling of the soap. He shaved, careful and slow. He changed his sheets. He sat on the end of his bed with his head in his hands.
That was how Sam found them, moments later- Dean pressed up against the car, rather heatedly kissing the angel he'd denied having a relationship with.
Castiel stared at Dean, noticing that he was breathing heavily despite not really having exerted himself.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean muttered. “You’d think monsters woulda at least learned how to be intimidating by now.”
“Dean,” Charlie said sternly. Dean blinked and realized Charlie had called his name a few times already. “Come here.”
“Yeah, in my—” In his bag, on the couch. On the pull-out couch. Dean’s stomach dropped and he shot upwards. “Wait, I’ll get it.”
The call went dead before Dean could conjure up something to say to that. He took a deep breath. Sometimes...sometimes, Charlie was deeply exasperating. He’d said she was the little sister he’d never had, and sometimes she took that sentiment a little too far in the ‘annoying Dean’ department.
Cas tilted his head, and it was like they were back in that barn, cold lights flashing. Dean blinked. It never stopped being uncanny, when those mannerisms crept back in.
him. He knew him better than Sam ever had. Dean knew he and Sam had, deep down, a fundamental misunderstanding of one another. He’d never known how to fix it. With Cas, even when things went wrong or they had misunderstandings, there was always that deeper knowing. Like they’d met before, like they’d always known each other.
“Have you—are you…” Sam trailed off, his face looking pinched and nervous when Dean glanced at him. He looked like
“No,” Dean said immediately, the word falling from his lips with force. “I’d like it if...we were really normal. Even if that means more root canals. I’d like to know what that’s like.”
Sam grinned, and then they were three. Often more than three, with hunters and friends pouring through the bunker on a constant stream. Charlie visited the most often, trying her best to defy the new normalcy clinging to all of them and keep them floating just out of sight of real-world consequences like charges of tax fraud and identity theft.
A breath released heavily from Dean’s lungs, and he stepped forward, bringing Benny to him in a tight hug.
Cas leaned back suddenly and loosened his tie with rough movements before pulling it off entirely. Dean’s mouth went dry as Cas shucked off his shirt and his hands lingered at his slacks, palming himself. A gnashing, cold little voice in Dean’s head suddenly snapped quiet—Cas wanted this as much as him. He didn’t just want to touch for the sake of it, or want to make Dean feel good in some distant, angelic way, he
Dean drove down the ramshackle street the bar resided on until he came across a motel. Seashell themed. In the middle of Nebraska. Whatever.
The bathroom door swung open and Cas puttered out, stuffing things away in his bag before taking the bag off the bed and setting it on the floor. Dean closed his eyes, not wanting to see Cas approach the bed, not wanting to let himself watch, when his fingers twitched around nothing. He’d forgotten to grab his gun out of his bag to stick beside him for the night.
“It’s Cas,” Dean snapped. The bit of label he’d pulled off the beer bottle tore, and he flicked the soggy paper to the table, trying to get his heart to stop thundering in his ears.
Dean laughs, and Castiel fumbles to capture the expression. He's accidentally switched on the flash, and several patrons turn towards him, their eyes accusative. A waitress approaches him, and he turns away, walking towards the bathroom.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said. He clamped one hand to the side of his ribs, feeling at a deep gash along his skin, skimming alongside his ribs. “That fucking—ow. That shit jabbed me.”
“Sam, you and I have never had the exact sort of bond that Dean and I share,” Cas said slowly. “I didn’t realize you’d been praying.”
“That doesn’t seem like the cheerful, optimistic Dean Winchester I remember,” Benny said. He stood still at the bottom of the stairs, staring around at the bunker. “Where’d you find this place?”
Dean’s straw sat on the table to his left, having rolled towards the ketchup and jams. Cas took a sip from his water, his lips closing around the straw slowly. Dean cleared his throat.
“And...what, that made you so uncomfortable you want to no-homo him into staying in the Empty forever so you don’t have to see him again?” Charlie said incredulously.
“I thought you—” Dean cut himself off as he walked into the room and up to Cas where he stood facing a blank wall. Thought he left. Thought Cas had decided to piss off to heaven again; leave Dean again.
and Dean laughed. The idea of Cas being a brother to him—he wasn’t sure if he’d ever believed it, when he’d said it. It
“Dean,” Cas said simply, looking up at him with an open, unguarded expression. Dean wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch him or run in the other direction.
Dean froze, his beer—what number was this, anyway?—halfway to his lips. This was a road he didn’t often go down in his mind. It led to things that he knew he shouldn’t think about too much. Things that would inadvertently turn to prayers.
Helen shifted slightly, repositioning on her barstool, her fingers adjusting where she clutched her shoulder bag.
Then, with a fluttering roll of her eyes and their accompanying eyelashes, she lolled her head to the side to stare at the computer screen beneath the counter and typed something in, her pointer finger pecking one key at a time.
Cas’s hands slowly, hesitantly lifted and began to move towards Dean’s face until they bracketed him, holding him together.
“I was under the impression that Dean didn’t want me listening anymore,” Cas said, and Dean winced. Charlie’s stare turned slowly onto Dean; giving for all the world the impression of a horror movie monster’s head spinning on its axis.
The news channel with a fat 3 in the bottom right appears in small bursts on the wall, Dean Winchester's face splayed across the screen.
“Shit,” he muttered. He sighed. There was nothing worse than finally letting your muscles relax, finally letting your bones sink into a mattress, and then realizing you’d forgotten to grab something.
Dean pushed past him and headed straight for the door, grabbing his keys and bursting out into the crisp, cold night air.
At worst, his love for everyone else in their life would poison them, too, and undo anything good Sam had been able to accomplish. Open, heartfelt Sam. Sam’s love wouldn’t send someone into the cold grip of death.
“No such thing anymore,” Dean said. He waved Benny into the bunker and watched as the man walked down the stairs. What in the hell. Or what in the purgatory, he thought, smirking at himself.
Dean started to say something, some unformed protest, but Cas cut him off. “You can’t deny it,” he said. “I’ve done it before. And have I not seen you at your worst?”
“Is—should I, you think—should I take off...more?” Dean said haltingly, his breath shuddering in and out of him, his pulse jittering his hands.
When the waitress came around to clear Cas’s empty plate, she tutted at Dean’s half-full plate. “You want a doggy bag, hon?”
He took a deep breath and walked back past Eileen’s room, peeking in quickly to see that the couple was peering down together at the baby that slept in her arms. The fire under his heels snuffed out and he found himself standing there, staring, feeling heavy and lost.
“Can you believe he won’t let me use the throwing stars?” Dean muttered as he shut the impala’s trunk and trudged after Sam and Eileen towards the barn, nothing but a stupid machete in his hand.
“I can see it in your eyes,” Charlie said, leaning forward over the table to squint up at Dean. “Go pray. Never thought I’d say that phrase, but do it. Go pray to your gay angel lover. Never thought I’d say that either.”
“Oh, it’s just...I really should’ve known,” she said. She reached out and patted Dean’s hand where it lay curled into a tense fist on the table. “You were a little too good at coaching me through flirting with that security guard. Oh, my god, and the way you talk about Harrison Ford! Man, I’ve really been slacking. I could’ve been your...your gay spiritual advisor.”
“No. You know what? No,” Dean said, his voice raising, his throat scratching. “That’s bullshit, Cas.”
Dean didn’t reach up to push the shoulder strap off his forehead. He was going to, just—in a minute. A shadow passed over his closed eyelids—when did he close them?—and warm fingers brushed against the frail, sunburnt skin along his forehead. His eyes shot open, something catching in his chest that was exactly as warm as the hand lifting the strap off his face. Cas just kept moving, settling the strap over the bag and shrugging.
“I just thought you were someone I knew, I'm sorry to trouble you,” he says, stumbling away from Dean, suddenly afraid.
“Listen, Dean,” Benny said. He took a step forward, and Dean noticed for the first time that there was a heavy-looking bag sitting on the floor behind him. “I got shit of my own to figure out. It’s harder than you’d think to get used to being really alive again after so long. Being here, pretending like I can have a life just sitting around here drinking beer and hunting monsters, it’s just a way to avoid thinkin’ about all that. Avoid doin’ something real.”
Castiel immediately returns to the Biggerson's main area, pulling Dean's hands off of his tie and leaving again. Dean cries out a wordless shout when Castiel yanks his hands, and the scream bothers Castiel as he returns to the hotel room.
He reached for Cas, taking the last step in towards him before his hand fisted in Cas’s shirt, the other drawing up against the side of Cas’s cheek, and the last thing he saw was Cas’s mouth parting, his eyes going wide, before Dean pressed himself in where Cas was taking a sharp, surprised breath, and stole it off his lips.
“Oh, they…” Something squeezed in Dean’s chest, and he lost the words again. “They said they were all out.”
Sam walked straight to the big table in the bunker and sat down heavily. Dean trailed after him and sat across from him, turning the bag over to dump out wrapped burgers and boxes of fries. He shoved some of it at Sam and unwrapped one, trying to act like normal-Dean, the Dean that Sam knew, even though his hands were shaking a little.
“It’s kind of lonely here by yourself,” Dean said, shutting the bunker door as the latest passersby-hunters filed out.
The door swings open and Castiel disappears just in time to see Dean staring at him, a slight frown on his face. Castiel finds himself smiling when he reaches a hotel.
Dean...had a lot to say. He found himself whispering to Cas as they began the hunt proper—commenting on the degree of heart-eyes Sam was giving Eileen. Commenting on the stupidity of
Thomas shrugged. “Sort of. My dad left it to me, even though I didn’t want it. But I got stuck, you know. Here I am.”
“Anyway,” Dean said. “You’re probably tired from the whole...being dead thing. There’s plenty of rooms.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the soft beige of the coat, the simple suit that had become so synonymous with Cas in his mind that sometimes when he was out on a hunt and saw a man with the right build in the right sort of suit, he almost had to sink to his knees just to stay upright at all.
"Cas," Dean whispered, hoping not to wake up Sam. Castiel looked at him immediately, standing up silently.
On the rare, quiet nights, Castiel would sit next to Dean as he tried to sleep, always a foot away as Dean insisted. But within a few minutes- and Castiel wasn't sure if Dean was ever asleep by then- Dean would roll closer and curl into Castiel's side, a pleased hum eitting from him as he wrapped himself around Castiel's warmer body.
It didn’t occur to Dean prior to the hunt to specifically mention it was vampires they were going after. It was...what, their tenth hunt since Benny had come back to Earth? Eleventh? And when the information came through, he didn’t think to get specific about what they were doing. He just relayed the facts—and maybe Benny immediately realized it was vampires; maybe he didn’t. But then they were face-to-face with the monsters, the worst sort of vampires, the kind that had a special preference for kids’ blood. And it wasn’t until they were both splattered with vampire blood; droplets clinging to their hair and eyelashes and every edge and button of their clothing, that Dean’s mind started to race.
The soft noise Dean made when Castiel's hands grasped his back was interesting, and Castiel broke off from Dean for a moment to move down to his neck, sucking and biting at the skin there. Dean made another noise, this one lower, almost a moan, and his hands gripped less tightly against Castiel's arms as he shifted his head up to expose his neck more.
Cas stared down at Dean for a long moment, and Dean shifted nervously. He’d never felt so—watched. So
“Sometimes I feel as though I can still see your soul,” Cas said casually. Dean raised his eyebrows.
“Maybe you should’ve invested in a pocket watch, Cas,” Dean bit out. “Or, you know, listened to me when I prayed to you.”
. Unless he’d—unless he’d known for years after seeing it in Dean’s memories somehow, as an angel. It wasn’t like Dean had ever worn anything like that since that incident with Rhonda all those years ago. Or, well. It wasn’t like Dean had done so
Dean swallowed, and he toed at his boots until he was flat-footed against the floor, and with his breath uneven in his throat, he pulled off his socks and started thumbing the buttons of his shirt open.
Sam couldn't help but wonder if something…more had developed between his brother and Castiel while they were in purgatory, but he dismissed the thought. It didn't really matter. He had his brother and his friend back, and that was what mattered. He would probably ask, though.
Castiel weaves in and out of Biggerson's for as long as he can stomach. Eventually, he finds himself wanting to take a break- not out of exhaustion but because of sheer boredom. Dean has not surfaced yet, so Castiel finds a slightly cleaner than usual Biggerson's and sits to actually eat.
It's easy to slip back into the constant grind of flipping through Biggerson's like pages in a book. It barely takes any effort at all, really. Once the adrenaline of being chased into a broom closet wears off, the only driving force in Castiel's mind is the desire to find Dean again.
But he turned around anyway to see the paper wrapping resting on the shoulder of the elderly woman sitting in the booth to Dean’s back. He hadn’t liked that they’d been seated where he had an occupied table at his back, but the woman had seemed harmless and there were no other tables open, anyway. It hadn’t seemed worth fussing about at the time.
it surprising? Were you not the one standing next to me when I acted like a damn fool because a Dr. Sexy lookalike was talking to us?’
Dean’s hands fisted in the sheets beside his legs. This shouldn’t be hard. He’d prayed to Cas a thousand times. More than that.
, his state after being chased into a broom closet by Dean could not be named, it is too enormous, too incomprehensible. It consumes him. It is not an obsession, it is his entire world.
Cas glanced over his shoulder, eyebrows raised, and paused. Dean gaped at him wordlessly, and Cas raised a hand between them and slowly crooked a finger.
“You were—you were dead,” Claire said, suddenly beside Sam. Her face was tracked with tears; she stared up at him like she was afraid he might strike her.
“What the hell!” Dean exclaimed, lunging out to grab at Cas, who stumbled back from the impact, nearly falling.
He opened his eyes again. One more glimpse—from so close. Closer than he’d allowed himself in years, since back when they were both still unfamiliar with that sharp, constant tension between them and had let it drag them too-close so often.
“I don’t understand why…” Cas crossed his arms. “Did you not want to admit that you would rather sleep somewhere comfortable, even if it meant sharing the bed? Is this one of those—toxic masculinity things? Because you think a real man would choose discomfort over closeness?”
Sam sighed and pushed away from the shelf he was leaning on and came around the table to where Cas was sitting. He set a hand on Cas’s shoulder and grimaced.
“I can’t do this,” Dean said urgently, tension suddenly gripping at him, pulling him away. He stood up, pressing his hands to his face.
Dean pulled off his jacket with shaking hands, walking unsteadily over to set it on the chair with Cas’s coat. Seeing them piled together—something quiet and small in Dean crept further from its hiding place, something greedy and wicked and wanting.
“Most people like to be kind in ways that people see,” Cas said. “So they can be thanked. Most of what you do is things nobody can see.”
“Wha—Cas, I don’t—” He tried to laugh, but his words kept—kept catching, and— Dean’s face was burning hot, and he blinked fast. When had he lost control of this situation?
Sam looked up from his baby, his eyes bright, and frowned only momentarily at Dean before his attention snapped back to the baby.
“Closing time,” the bartender said, rapping at the counter in front of them. Dean glanced over his shoulder at the rest of the bar—almost everyone was cleared out.
Dean dropped his eyes to the toaster as he felt his cheeks heat. “I’m sure you can handle yourself,” he said. “It’s not like we’ll be killing God or anything. Maybe a ghost, or a chupacabra.”
As people started to splinter off to go to sleep or drive home, Dean began plucking up abandoned bottles and glasses to take to the sink—the longer he lived, the more he began to accept that he was a bit of a control freak when it came to the bunker’s clutter. He almost wanted to throw one of the glass bottles, just to feel something break and take a breath. It was too much to happen in what felt like one day—die, find out Cas didn’t abandon him on purpose, come back to life, see everyone, get Cas back for real. And he felt like he had a tenuous hold on a fire inside him, a fire that was both fury and longing, the two emotions increasingly inseparable.
Charlie sighed. They both stared silently down at the table for a moment before Charlie let out a laugh.
“Hey, you okay?” he asked, grabbing Benny’s shoulder when the last vampire head rolled. “I should’ve mentioned it was vamps, I don’t know if…”
Dean took a breath and opened the door nonetheless, gun raised, lungs tight with air, body braced for an attack or for disappointment.
“Did Charlie say something to you?” he asked slowly. Eileen’s eyes darted to Sam, but Sam just frowned, his head tilting a little.
"I can't," Dean said truthfully. "And I figure it's better to wait out the night in the car than to toss around in my bed and risk waking Sam."
“No,” Dean said. “No. You always assume I don’t—I don’t care. But I do. You said you couldn’t have me, but you can. You can.”
“Cas, I—” words failed Dean, and he leaned into Cas, catching his lips with his own, just the ghost of a kiss, before pulling back and watching Cas’s expression shift.
“But, Cas,” Dean said, his voice cracking. “What if a ‘bit of time’ turns into more? What if it’s...years? Decades? In a few decades, I’ll be—old. Maybe dead, it’s not like I eat rabbit food and run all the time like Sam.”
Cas’s hand that had been lingering at Dean’s hip was abruptly at Dean’s shoulder instead, his palm cupped over the very spot his own handprint seared into Dean’s flesh so long ago.
He waited, sitting on the end of his bed and trying to remember to breathe. He toed off his boots, prodding them towards the corner but not getting up. He stood up hesitantly, peeling off his jacket before padding out to the hall to brush his teeth. He leaned down to spit only halfway, stooping awkwardly over the sink. Keeping his eyes on the mirror.
“So you’ll have to tell me if you want me to stop,” Cas said, and Dean’s vision blurred, a heady wave of heat rushing through him.
Cas’s face crumpled, all the lines and creases of age—age that would never become deeper; would always stay the same—standing out for a moment as he looked back at Dean. It was—it was like Dean’s body was being as cracked open and obvious as he felt on the inside, broken open like an orange split by two enormous hands. He couldn’t get his body to stand up, all he could do was kneel, sitting on his heels, his head tilted up, the sun warming his exposed neck.
Dean took a ragged breath and Cas’s thumb brushed across his parted lips. He didn’t know. He didn’t know what it was, what that raw, clawing
He threw open a storage room door and was already jerking away to keep moving when a flash of beige caught his eye.
She made a face. “You’ve been dead, like, two weeks. It took forever for us to get your body back from the feds. The real ones.”
“What?” Castiel asks, and his voice comes out a roar. One of the TVs shatters and the woman shrieks.
“Oh, can it,” Charlie laughed. “Go see your girl, it’s been like an hour, it must be so hard for you.”
“Not even me,” Cas said. “Especially not me, really. But it’s just a trial. After a bit of time, we’ll—”
“I was thinking, we were a pretty good team once upon a time,” he said. “Would you want to come on some hunts? There are still some, every once in a while.”
“We’ll be fine,” Dean said. He blinked down at the empty plate in front of him. One gone already. “Besides, you have Eileen, don’t ya?”
“I lasted a pretty long time, I think,” Dean said. Apparently too cavalierly, because Cas’s expression went from confused and angry to outright furious.
He picked the lock on the back door and crept inside as he carefully cut each palm. There was no time to mess around. If the creature got him before he got it, he’d be done for, like the other hunters who’d tried to stop the thing. And it would know what they were trying to do; it would be more prepared if someone else had to try the same spell.
“You know, if you could come to Earth, you could wipe out a nest like this in ten seconds flat,” Dean said, a warm
He led the way to the bunker; the door hanging open from Jody’s trip inside to get water. Another ten years pinned onto his life. If he didn’t die again barreling into a hunt head-first. Who was Cas to say how many years Dean was required to live before he was allowed to die? He could die any time. He could trip walking down the bunker stairs and—
It was only as they were parking at the pie festival near the case that Dean squared his shoulders and took a deep breath, shaking off the not-dream from last night. Of course Cas was abandoning him and everyone else for the rest of forever. What else was new? Why wouldn’t he? It was what he always did, over and over and over. Leave.
“This is all I’ve got,” Sam said, dropping a heavy spell book to the table with a thud. Dean jumped, startled out of hazily daydreaming of showers and a grumbling voice in his ear.
Dean flinched and the plastic fork he was gripping tight enough to snap went flying, landing in the dirt at Eileen’s feet as she returned with her cider. She looked from it to Dean expectantly, and he grimaced sheepishly.
“Get off,” he gasped. Thomas immediately slipped away, kneeling just beside Dean. Dean scrambled to sit up, his knees pulling in towards his chest.
Maybe, he thought, and immediately reached for the whiskey—maybe when he died and showed up in heaven, Cas wouldn’t even be there to greet him. Wouldn’t even care anymore, would’ve gotten tired of the idea of Dean and moved on to bigger and better things.
Sam was still alive, albeit different- stronger. He welcomed them back, crying a little upon the reunion. There were still things to deal with, and they dealt with them together. Castiel would occasionally consider leaving them alone, as he thought they should be, but Dean would see the contemplative look on his face and demand that he stay with them.
“I’ll give you two some space,” Benny said softly, moving away on quiet feet. Dean didn’t turn to look. He didn’t want to miss a flicker on his brother’s face, a warning that maybe it would be best for Dean if he tuned out, if he checked out of the situation entirely and pretended like he didn’t see or hear anything at all. Didn’t feel anything at all.
“Yes, I noticed that,” the man replies. “Have you wondered why that is, how you could even walk in my presence?”
The familiar twinge of guilt flicks on in his stomach as he leaves his bill unpaid, and he quickly finds a new Biggerson's to photograph. The restaurant is dark- not something Castiel has seen before. He glances at the clock to find that it is seven pm, which is well before closing time.
“Hey, wait,” Dean said, reaching for Jack’s arm but pulling his hand away before he could touch. “You’re the new God...does that mean you’ll be...pulling the strings down here? Writing our story?”
“Dean,” Cas said. “I would face the wrath of heaven and hell if it meant I could be near you for a moment.”
Thanks for all your comments; it's really been a joy to see people's reactions and feel a little more connected to other post-finale grievers and in general feel more connected to new people during covid. Hope everyone's staying safe, and if anyone else has fled back to tumblr since the finale fiasco, I'm @sgtjmsbrns on there.
Charlie chewed her lip, her brow furrowed as she looked closely at Dean. Too closely. Dean finished his beer and stood up abruptly, walking to get a replacement.
“You’re just—exceptionally bright sometimes,” Cas said. “It’s like you’re the only bright thing in a dark room, compared to everyone else.”
Castiel huffs, confused by nearly everything he's experienced in this place. He glares down at his feet as he walks towards the end of the alley, and slams into a woman.
And maybe it was stupid it had only been a few times, or that he’d been so drunk on liquid bravery each time. Because Thomas’s weight over him, the rough scratch of his stubble on Dean’s face, it was—it was good. He could do this. He’d gotten past the hard part, the part where he had to pretend like he was paying attention to the actual person and not just the feeling of skin on skin.
Sam laughed incredulously, his eyes wide. He hugged him tightly, nearly knocking Dean over. “What’s going—what’s going on? We could ask you the same thing.”
Castiel realized he didn't quite know what to say in this situation, so he simply leaned against the car, crossing his arms. Dean stood a few feet away, his arms crossed similarly.
"You shouldn't have stormed out on your brother; he'll probably worry if you disappear off somewhere."
“Well, he seemed a little panicked about me being God; said he wanted to help and make sure I didn’t...what was the word he used? Implode?”
Sam made his way down the stairs, and when he reached the bottom he held out the bulging bag of food. Dean’s hands moved robotically, taking the warm bag and clutching it to his chest.
“Tell me what you’ve been up to,” Benny drawled, holding out his beer to clink against Dean’s. “I’m sure it’s something good.”
He stayed on the fringes as everyone talked. It didn’t feel real. It felt like something he might have wistfully imagined years ago. Now, it felt like something out of place in his life, like a puzzle piece that was being forced into the wrong spot, even if it was a puzzle piece he’d been searching for for so long.
“Goddamnit,” Dean muttered, smoothing a hand down his body. His clothes were too large on him; loose and strange feeling against his skin.
was that made him push and strike out like a cornered animal—that made him want to see something other than placid, steady
Something angry and cold and wanting unfurled in Dean’s chest and he gritted his teeth as he took a deep breath. “You’ve done it before,” he bit out.
“Yeah, I am,” Sam said. He shoved the box away, back into his pocket, beaming. “You think...you think I can pull it off?”
“Why do you think you want me to hurt you?” Cas said, his voice suddenly light and casual; his hand slid slowly along Dean’s neck, curving around the back of it, tugging Dean forward slightly. Dean’s hand fell away haltingly, brushing first against Cas’s side and then quickly pressing back against the wall to grasp at the cold, hard surface fruitlessly.
Charlie appeared behind Sam, and the two of them stared down at Dean and Cas for a long moment. Then, moving quickly, Charlie walked down the stairs and Sam followed her.
“They have something called a donut burger,” Cas said, twisting the brochure to show Dean. “It sounds horrible. I think you should get it.”
Castiel was suddenly pressed into the side of the car, his back arching against the rounded angle of the side. Hands pressed against his arms roughly, fingers curling into his coat tightly. Dean's body was pressed against his, and Castiel could feel Dean's chest as he breathed. Their faces were close, not touching for just an instant before Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's, surprising him for a moment before he started pushing back into Dean, his hands finding purchase at Dean's back in the fabric of his jacket.
Dean knew that tone of voice. That was the tone Charlie used when she didn’t believe in something at all, but she thought maybe if she said it with enough false hope behind it, she might be able to get everyone else to believe in an idea.
“The week before you showed up I went on a hunt with this guy Paul,” Dean said. “He was a nightmare. I thought he was going to get us both killed before we even found the damn thing we were hunting.”
Dean’s stomach dropped, and he set down the burger he’d been about to take a bite out of. ‘With Benny.’
“Let’s do this inside,” Dean said. “I don’t think standing at the damn funeral pyre is the best place to catch up.”
“Hey, did you find everything you were looking for?” he asks, shoving his sweater sleeves up his arms. “I wasn't sure you had full control of that computer.”
“And I know you like to assume that I don’t—that you don’t mean as much to me as you do, but you had to have known what you were doing to me, and I don’t—”
Sam looked nervous. Like Dean might storm off. But there was something bright and shimmery where Dean might’ve expected to find betrayal. Where Sam clearly expected there to be anger.
It wasn’t long before there was another Winchester in the world—a year and a half, to be precise. Dean spent most of Eileen’s pregnancy in a state of panic, realizing that he knew absolutely nothing about pregnancy or how to prevent things from going wrong.
Benny raised his eyebrows. “I don’t have any extra speed or strength anymore,” he said. “I’m afraid I’m just a pretty average human now, darlin’.”
“I did try!” Dean said. “I did try. And you know what? Maybe I would’ve succeeded, if you hadn’t told me what you did that day. Or if I hadn’t killed you, saying it back. Or if you hadn’t promised to come back to me.”
Castiel has seen many more people from the past and future than any normal human. He's seen a woman who claimed to be a “supermodel”, paid to be beautiful, and she found it offensive when he said that she was “completely the same as every other female”.  He's seen a famous young man who was in the middle of being chased by young girls who called him “perfect” and screamed as they tried to catch the boy. But he's never met any person as stunningly, overwhelmingly perfect as Dean. To Castiel his face seems crafted by angels, the sort of person who could spark a second Trojan war, the sort of person who could inspire Michelangelo.
Standing at the door of the bunker, looking back at the dim, quiet space he’d called home for so long, Dean couldn’t help but sigh, feeling a bit like Sam with the overdramatic sighing-every-two-minutes. Sometime in the last few years, the bunker had started feeling like a purgatory of its own.
“The happiness was from finally telling you that you deserve love,” Cas said firmly. He stepped forward so assuredly that Dean stumbled back slightly. “And telling you that you have mine. And from realizing that you love me too, even with everything I’ve done. Everything I’ve done to you.”
He starts arriving in the bathrooms, deciding to stick with that for a few thousand. After a thousand of those he's halfway out of the stall when the door flies open and two people stumble in, arms grappling around each other, faces pressed close. Kissing. One, a man, pushes the woman he's with onto a sink counter, and Castiel chooses then to leave, knowing what is considered “private”.
“I—I don’t trust you,” Dean said, the words heavy as they tripped off his tongue. “And I’m—I’m angry. Really, really angry.”
He presses his lips together, thinking. He considers stopping, giving up on Dean, and his stomach drops at the thought. He swallows dryly and stands up. He couldn't possibly give up, not now. He'd already gone and broken his first rule, to not become someone anyone actually
Castiel twisted them around so that he was pressing Dean into the car, and the movement caused Dean to let out a quick breath. The car was fairly low, so Dean's head rested almost on top of the car, making his whole body arch out slightly to accommodate the angle. Castiel pressed harder into Dean, moving back up to his mouth, pushing into the man to relieve this tension between them that he hadn't really known was there.
“Eileen found it,” Sam said. He pointed at something written in jagged, brown ink. Probably aged blood, Dean figured. It was always blood.
“So this is your big trick?” Castiel recognizes the voice as Dean, but he cannot seem to drag himself away from the tray of meat to look at him. He takes a spare thought to note that Dean's last name is Winchester, a perfect last name for him. Dean Winchester. “Making people coo-coo for cocoa puffs?”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Dean asked, his voice coming out a little hysterical. Something was splintering apart in him, something heavy, and its shards were making his hands shake and his breath come out fast. This was real now. Cas was alive, and they—they’d said it, or Cas had and Dean had nearly said it, and they weren’t...they weren’t toeing around it like they had for...so long. So many years. How did you—how did you even deal with that? What did you say to someone you’ve loved like that for so long without saying it, once it’s all out there? Once you’ve spoken it into existence?
He took a deep breath before pushing through the group and passing a beer to Sam and a new bag of frozen food to Cas, taking the original one to put back in the freezer. People kept patting Dean's shoulder, like they wanted to make sure he was real and not a group hallucination.
“Over,” Cas said firmly, and he rose up and off Dean as he pulled his slacks off. Dean’s hands fell from the headboard limp and he took a deep breath.
As soon as Dean was asleep, he knew that Cas had decided to show his face. He was sitting on that familiar dock—on the actual dock this time, his feet in the water—and without turning, he could tell Cas was standing behind him.
“Even though you piss me off,” Dean said. “Even though you...left. Left me. I know it’s not gonna go away. Even if you forget to ever come back.”
But this Cas looked like he was considering making a joke, his mouth flirting with a grin, but he schooled it back straight and stared at Dean. “Yes.”
Cas didn’t say anything as he flicked off the light by the door and slid the chain into place, or as he climbed in beside Dean and their arms brushed. It produced the exact swooping sensation Dean had buried away no less than eighty times in the past two hours as he imagined this moment.
Dean turned his back to Cas and dug into the bag, pulling out the gun. He turned around slowly. Cas was still standing
“Why,” he said, tossing the motel key onto the little dresser by the door. “So you can try it without having to commit?”
By the time Dean had retrieved a few beers, after telling Jody that there seemed to be no more brawls going down inside, everyone was crowded around the table talking. It didn’t feel all that different from the night that Dean had left the bunker, although there was a bit of a manic mood in the air. Probably something about going from a funeral to a miraculous rebirth to a reunion all in one night.
“Even once I couldn’t see your soul, you never stopped glowing, Dean,” Cas said. Dean pushed his plate away, his stomach tight. Cas frowned. “It’s a complement, Dean.”
Castiel gazed at Dean for a long, somewhat uncomfortable moment before going around to the other side of the bed and sitting down, leaning against the headboard. Dean looked over at Castiel, glad that the angel had understood without him having to say anything aloud.
They could’ve had this years ago. He could’ve tasted the static electricity on Cas’s tongue, could have dug his hands into Cas’s hair and pulled him closer.
He felt hands shove at him and the vamp, pushing him ever-so-slightly to his left as the vamp’s head went flying and he and the vamp slammed into a hard post.
Cas’s other hand dragged up along Dean’s stomach, lingering where his ribs curved apart just beneath his chest, where his breath rose and fell raggedly., and his thumb brushed over Dean’s nipple through his shirt. Dean’s hand moved to grasp, to steady himself against Cas’s, but Cas’s head tilted slightly, warningly.
“He was taking photographs,” the waitress says. “I just wanted to make sure he wasn't snooping on little kids.”
“I, uh. Heard from Jack a while back that you’re out of the empty,” Dean said slowly. He kept his eyes closed, but couldn’t help but listen for any shift in the air, and slight rustle in the stillness of his bedroom. “I’ve been...waiting for you, I guess. I figure you’re pretty busy up there, uh. Helping Jack. I’ve been...hunting, sometimes. Trying out a new way to cook steak.”
The cold concrete floor was unforgiving. There was no yielding pressure there, no room to let his body sag or slump into resignation. The only option was despair.
He’d expected the drive to be overwhelming. To feel like the slow walk to the execution chair. But it felt more just empty. The highways were dark and barren, and the miles ticked by like they always had; the road feeling more like home than the bunker nowadays. Like it used to. It was like he was young again, his only reliable place to return to being his car. One thing that couldn’t leave him; one thing he could always bring back to life.
Cas finally moved, his cock dragging against Dean’s prostate as he withdrew; a pulsing pleasure flickering through him at the movement. He quickly moved faster, the phantom lube—fucking
He flipped back his sheets and slid into bed slowly, like maybe if he moved slow enough, he wouldn’t scare Cas away this time. And he stared at the dark ceiling, the minutes ticking away in the back of his mind even after he took his clock and put it out in the hall. And then he slept.
Dean glared and touched a hand to his reddened lips, still breathing heavily. "Not exactly," he said, licking his lips absentmindedly.
Castiel watched Dean as he leaned into the seat, closing his eyes. It made him smile when a few minutes later Dean's head slumped to the side, revealing that he'd fallen asleep.
“You come here often?” he said, tilting his head towards the woman. She leaned her arms on the counter and smiled at him.
“Let him go,” a new voice says. It sounds like the large man from Castiel's last past experiences with the two men.
Castiel briefly brings himself to a shed in Canada in two thousand and five, arriving five seconds after he left the last time. One of the bins of his clothes is slipping off the shelf from where he disrupted it on his last visit, a visit twenty Biggerson's ago. He catches the bin and opens it, pulling out a suit and tie, and as an afterthought, a trench coat. It was the exact same outfit he'd been wearing the first time he'd captured the man's image, and considered it a lucky combination of clothes.
There were other footsteps up at the door, and Dean leaned away, his heart thundering in his chest. It felt like ripping a part of himself just to look away from Cas and up towards the door. Sam was facing away, talking to people in the doorway, and Dean couldn’t help but smile at the idea of his little brother trying to protect Dean’s privacy. Or, actually, he wasn’t so much his little brother anymore, now that Dean was newly young, just barely past forty, and Sam was freakin' balding.
“You tired?” Dean asked as they strolled into the bunker, dropping their bags by the door to deal with later.
“Two or three—but wasn’t Dean praying to you?” Charlie asked. She leaned over a chair, bracing her arms on the back of it.
“I’ve done it before,” Dean said. Charlie shook her head questioningly. “I mean, I was in hell for forty years. Came out, barely any time had passed. I felt like I should be an old man, but I was still young. Had to try and forget what I’d felt for forty years and act like I was the same person.”
“If we rush off with some half-cocked plan, that’s no better for the families,” Jody insisted. “We need to figure out what will actually work and get it right. The first time.”
Cas eyed her as she walked away. “She reminds me of Ellen,” he said, once she was in the kitchen. Dean blinked at the empty doorway she’d disappeared through.
He didn’t take much. Just a couple weapons, the bare minimum. The clothes on his back; a flask full of whiskey in case he needed any...extra encouragement. The spell book. He lingered near some of the scrap papers from their research. He could write a note to the rest of them; tell them he was going to take care of it, but they’d figure it out on their own in time. He didn’t know what it was he could say anyway.
So he nursed his drink, staring down at the patterns in the wooden bartop, and listened to the drivel people kept playing on the jukebox. Tonight it was a whole lot of Taylor Swift, which he wasn’t too mad about but it just wasn’t hitting the spot.
Cas’s eyes flicked down to where Dean’s hand clung—not pushing or pulling Cas away, just clinging—and his face flickered slightly, his mouth twitching at the sight.
“Cas, what the hell are you doing?” Dean asked. Cas stared blankly at him. Dropped the bag at the foot of the bed. Dean gaped at him.
Benny crossed his arms slowly. “You’re in love with that angel of yours,” Benny said. “I don’t know why he’s not down here with you, but...I know love when I see it.”
“I—the metaphysics of existence were damaged badly in the aftermath of Jack’s ascension,” Cas said. Sam shifted, crossing his arms, and Cas winced. “It’s not an excuse, it’s just...time passed very quickly. I thought it had been two, maybe three years, and I...I told Jack that we needed to find another way for me to help.”
His hand pressed over the bulge where Dean’s cock strained against his jeans, and Dean jolted, a gasp wrenching out of him. His grip tightened briefly before it slid away and a hotter, damper pressure replaced it. Dean lifted his head slightly and saw Cas’s mouth pressed to his jeans, his eyes fixed on Dean’s face.
“And Sam is usually kind to people’s faces,” Cas said. “He would’ve told the waitress he was all set, but explained to her that everything was great and he just wished there was a fridge in his room.”
“Or did you not want to sleep on this, and assumed I would make you, if I knew it was here?” Cas asked. He shook his head, dismissing that idea.
His other hand swiftly moved between Dean’s legs and took his balls in hand, tugging lightly at them as the other grasped at Dean’s ribs, forcing his back to arch into the touch as his legs jerked and bent at the knees.
one more goddamn time he’d throw his drink, glass and all, across the bar at the hipster-looking college kid hovering possessively over the jukebox.
Cas gestured at the diner around them, the tired motel guests and the truck drivers passing by before sleeping in their cabs.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said. He paused, glancing down at Cas’s hand before grabbing it and tugging him along as he walked out of the storage room. “You know what I mean.”
Sam frowned. “No, not for a while,” he said, glancing over his shoulder at Eileen, who shook her head. Dean’s fingers tightened where his hand gripped the door frame, and Sam shrugged, the gesture a little too forced. “He’s probably just in the bathroom or something. Trying to remember how to floss.”
Charlie cried out, throwing up her hands in exasperation. “Hello, every rom-com plot ever,” she said. “He’s probably kicking rocks up by the pearly gates thinking that he messed things up with you and that
The bunker, which never quite seemed to be silent, had a quiet hum to it that was like a roar in Dean’s ears, a mocking, empty sound buzzing in his head. His footsteps echoed against the tiled hallway, his footfalls slowly growing faster.
sleep on this thing, or on the floor, if you think it’s so embarrassing to choose sharing a comfortable bed with me over messing up your bad shoulder again.”
He shook his head and yanked his phone out of his pocket to tell Sam they’d stopped for the night early.
“No, Cas, you know what?” Dean said. He pushed himself upright and jabbed a finger in Cas’s chest. “That’s bullshit. You and I both know I was always meant to go out this way.”
“I know,” Dean said. It didn’t matter that it had been...a year? A year and a few months, maybe? Since he’d finally prayed to Cas, finally gotten at least to talk to Cas and see him in his dreams. Sometimes he’d still hear Cas make a comment and turn towards where his mind tried to pretend he was standing, or he’d hold out a piece of food for Cas to try and realize only when his hand hovered awkwardly in space that there was no one there to take it.
Dean shoved the vamp away from himself and his hands flew to his side. There was pain, sharp, blindingly bright and unrelenting pain, and his hands came away silky with blood.
“That’s what you’ll have then,” Jack said. He drifted away, following the path Sam had taken through the crowd, and Dean swallowed around the cottony feeling in his mouth. A normal life. Even the bad parts.
“Obviously,” Dean said breathlessly, instead of resorting to threats, and kissed him again. How was it that his lips were chapped when he was straight off a ten year stint in heaven? Dean felt like he had something tearing inside him, built-up longing pulling outwards and away from him. And he was angry. So, so angry, an anger he hadn’t felt in years; burning, hot, clawing anger, but the pull was stronger; laced with fear and regret. They could’ve had this ten years ago, before that anger settled in, before he had to stare into the face of the dark side of loving someone with so much of yourself. He could feel his fingers gripping tighter, almost punishingly tight on Cas's arms.
When the bar was starting to empty out—much later than the last few nights, close to two in the morning—Dean was biting at his bottom lip and...wondering.
“Yes,” the old man says. “I see. That's one deep dark nothing you've got there, Dean. Can't feel it, can you? Not food, nor drink, not even with sex?
And then he pulled, and the cushions flew up and the pull-out couch unearthed itself from beneath with a righteous squeal of metal. Dean realized he’d taken a step closer, like he could stop this from happening, and he found himself standing at the foot of a pathetic twin-sized pull-out bed, right beside Cas, who was staring down at the bed.
“It’ll kill whoever casts it,” he said carefully, holding the paper in both hands. “And we don’t even know if it’ll work to kill the thing, but it will definitely kill whoever does it.”
“You know you’re a good man,” Benny said. Dean took a shaky breath and set down his beer. Why did everyone seem to think that he needed a pep talk? He could count on one hand the number of people he knew well that
Lights at the side of the highway flashed by in rhythmic pulses of yellow as the hours of the drive wore on and it went from day to afternoon to night, and Dean tapped the steering wheel to the beat of the song playing low. Last week, Charlie had called to catch up and she’d made a comment as they said their goodbyes that Dean sounded different—lighter, happier maybe. Dean couldn’t disagree—it was nice having Miracle around at least, although the dog was getting old, but it wasn’t the same as actually having someone else living in the bunker all the time, always ready to go on a hunt or just sit and have a beer. It was better than just having folks come passing through for a day or a week and then leave again. Everyone always left.
Dean looked over at his brother with alarm in his eyes. "What?" he asked, an incredulous look on his face. "Why would you ask that?"
But to some extent, Castiel feels that Dean's beauty was not what moved Castiel to track him down. The expression on Dean's face in that first photograph was what motivated the obsession. The hint of suspicion, mingled with the bright curiosity that seldom remains in a human beyond their childhood years.
Dean’s brow flickered with a frown as he read the hope and nervousness in his little brother’s eyes. It was like Sam was just waiting for an explosion. Or waiting for Dean to tell him that their work wasn’t done, that Sam couldn’t just quit.
“I have you,” Dean said honestly, cracking open a beer. “And everyone’s always coming through. It’s fine.”
Dean, until Dean was fully on the bed, his legs flung out akimbo and his arms tangled in the sheets. He pulled Dean’s t-shirt up and quickly wrenched it over his head before nodding darkly at the headboard Dean was now inches from. Dean’s hands moved before he could process, before he could wonder what the nod meant, and they gripped the cold metal rods above his head.
“Guess so,” Dean said. He couldn’t even picture the waitress’s face. He gave Cas a small smile though, before picking up his menu and flipping it open to the donut burger.
Dean only dozed fitfully, waking up in starts, flashes of Hell flickering on his eyelids. He wasn’t headed there, he knew that. You didn’t have God for a sort-of step-son without at least going to heaven, right? But he was afraid nevertheless, which was actually...relieving. Sometimes, sitting in the bunker alone for the twelfth night in a row, he’d imagine what it’d be like to die out of the blue, and part of him couldn’t help but think that it wouldn’t even matter, that he wouldn’t even be upset and neither would anyone else. But the house peered down at him, looking for all the world like the house he’d spent the first few years of his life in, and his stomach was queasy and his heart was thundering in his ears.
“When we were in purgatory,” he said, “you prayed to that angel of yours every night. I heard you, even though you tried to go out of earshot. One of the nights you prayed to him, you told him you’d kill yourself before leaving that place without him, and we found him the next day. I remember thinking you were either the luckiest son of a bitch I ever met or else someone really was listening.”
They all shifted closer to look. This one had called them all in. Two hunters had already died trying to kill the damn thing. It was something none of them had ever encountered before; an old, forgotten creature with the worst inclinations.
“Dean—I’m telling you I wasn’t listening as closely. You wanted me out of your head; I left. I didn’t—I thought you weren’t reaching out to me.” Cas spoke urgently, his eyes wide and fixed on Dean. “And when you—when I saw you in that dream on the dock, and you asked me how I’d left you, Dean, it was the hardest thing I could have done. I started planning how to finish my work with Jack and return to you as soon as you woke. I don’t know...I don’t know how so many years passed.”
The bartender—Thomas—already had his drink waiting for him, and Dean picked it up with a nod as he glanced around at the other patrons in the bar. It was starting to fill up fast, much faster than it had a few days ago when there’d been max six people in the bar at any given time all night.
Things he didn’t say out loud. If history was something to go off of, if he did that, it would all get snatched away.
“Maybe someday you’ll end up back here and you’ll tell me all about it,” Thomas murmured. He settled down on the other side of the bed, sprawled out. Carefree. It was funny, Dean used to feel like that, carefree. Or at least, close enough to carefree that everyone interpreted him that way.
As if that helped. But somehow, the horrors of childbirth—and Dean did not use that word lightly—almost managed to distract from the fact that there were very real, very normal risks associated. Sam seemed almost calm by comparison.
They slipped into the barn, quickly finding the boys and shooing them outside. Eileen ran with them, pulling them out the door as figures quickly surrounded them.
He pulled the page of instructions out of the spell book in the passenger seat and his eyes drifted over it. It was pretty simple, all things considered. A little blood sacrifice and a few words before getting a hand on the monster. Straightforward, clean, easy. It didn’t say what exactly would happen to him—if he’d explode, or choke on blood, or vanish entirely. So maybe there’d be a body, maybe there wouldn’t.
. Dean was stumbling as he fought it, and he only barely registered the sound of the barn door opening again and Eileen’s feet hitting the floor to his right. Sometimes it felt like the only time he could get a clear head was when he was fighting something—that was always when he could suddenly think things through without getting caught up on stupid hang ups.
Castiel feels choked, and he stands up, abandoning the computer. He frowns, wondering if he misunderstood something that he read, wondering if this is all some hallucination. The guy at the desk shouts something casually to him as he leaves, but the words blur into blackness and he doesn't really hear them, let alone comprehend them. He feels a hand on his shoulder, and turns. The librarian is standing there, his chestnut hair mussed, glasses crammed into the curls.
Castiel feels something like disgust at the name Sam, and he nods briefly at the young man and leaves the library at last, turning into the alley. He glances back towards the library and sees the librarian leaning out, his eyebrows raised as Castiel disappears into the dark alley. He slips back inside as Castiel grimaces at him.
Castiel decides to change his clothes first. Dean's offhand comment about his coat being “creepy” concerns him- does that make him, by extension, creepy? That was never his intent. He simply wanted to track Dean down, collect photographs. He cannot comprehend why Dean would find him creepy- if their places were swapped, Dean would have tracked himself down. Castiel cannot imagine that a person could see Dean staring at them through a photograph and not feel the need to find him.
Dean nodded. The wad in his throat was back, and he took a deeper gulp of water, almost draining the glass. Part of him wanted to say, ‘
Dean sighed out a heavy breath as the door clanged shut. He hadn’t quite managed to get himself to relax the whole time they’d been sitting there, no matter how mundane the topic of their conversation had gotten.
He stuffed his feet back in his shoes and stumbled out into the early afternoon light, answering the call. It was the least he could do.
“Oh,” the larger one says. “I remember when you told me about that...I thought you were hallucinating, Dean!”
“I don’t know,” he said finally. “I can think of a few things, but...I gotta see what’s possible, I guess, right?”
Dean took a deep breath. He could tell them that it didn’t matter—there was no reason why his life should count more than the four lives he’d saved in that family; five lives, really, since the kid left to survive wouldn’t really ever have a normal life. He could ask more questions, but the last thing he wanted to admit was that part of him had needed to know what waited for him after earth; needed to know if he would ever have something more than an empty bed and an occasional visitor. “I need a drink.”
“That’s a good idea,” he said. “I was thinking that I could be a good antiquities dealer. Check if things are authentic, you know? I could get started with some of the stuff we’ve got in the bunker, and it wouldn't be a forty-hour a week thing, so I could still help with hunts and research and—”
Castiel regroups in a hotel room, sinking onto a bed. He hadn't even taken a picture. All he'd done was get himself actually
“Hey there, Dean,” Benny said, his voice just as low and lilting as Dean remembered. “Gonna let me in?”
Before Cas could say anything else, Sam stepped closer. Dean's hand dropped from Cas's coat, letting Cas step towards Sam with his arms raised.
good. Maybe that was why he couldn’t bear to tell Sam—it would make it too easy for Sam to realize that Dean had nothing except for that one good thing. And it made him guilty to even think that it was the only good part. It wasn’t. He had Sam, he had Eileen, his niece, Charlie, so many people he loved. But the almost-having was like a bruise he couldn’t stop poking, and it was so much
He sighed. For the first time in a long time, he felt stupid to be praying. It felt like he was talking to no one. Talking to himself.
“Oh, dude, the serial killer? I heard about him, it's crazy,” the guy says, pressing keys. Dean's name appears on the screen, and abruptly an image of him comes up.
“Tell me what you want, Dean,” Cas murmured. His eyes seemed darker—was it the angle, or was it...something else?
“Think so?” Benny said, lounged in the passenger seat comfortably, watching Dean as they got on the highway back towards the bunker.
meant ‘leave me alone’ when he’d said as much, then fine. Dean was supposed to live his life, he could do that. He could. He wasn’t a child, wasn’t the broken little toy Thomas figured him as.
Cas just kept looking at him, and the longer Dean went on standing there silently, the more Cas’s mouth tightened with something like shame.
Dean sighed, but let it rest. Fine. Fine. If Cas wanted to be stubborn about this of all things, then fine. Of course he would be unyielding and resistant when it came to leaving, when it came to not being here.
“Why haven’t you been answering your phone?” she asked. “Like, for a week. Sam said you wouldn’t pick up when he called, either. I was this close to telling Sam your location and sending him out to find you.”
“Stop. No one lays a finger on this sweet little boy. Sam, I see you got the snack I sent you,” the old man says, most of the sentence incomprehensible.
before Cas was undoing the button of his jeans and tugging them down and mouthing against his dick through the gray fabric of his boxer-briefs, dampening the fabric before yanking those down too and leaving Dean entirely exposed beneath him.
“Of course I told him, Dean!” Charlie cried. “He’s your brother, and you’ve been a mess for the last ten years.”
Sam didn’t reply by the time Dean reached the motel room door, and he smiled. Good. Eileen didn’t deserve a guy glued to his phone for no reason.
The dialogue from "You're mister Winchester" to "But it'll work from them" is taken directly from the episode 'My Bloody Valentine'.
Sam perked up from where he was slouched on the couch, texting Eileen--she was just in their bedroom down the hall, but you’d think she was in Siberia for how pouty Sam was in her absence.
“Sounds like our kind of thing,” he said. If Sam asked a single question about what Dean just looked at, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
“Oh, don’t make that face,” Dean groaned. “I just mean—I don’t know. I like women. I like women a lot. So why would I—why would I…”
This is only sort of an ending. I plan to add a little sequel fic with more fluffy now-that-Cas-is-back content (what's that guy Thomas up to?? When does Dean get to go to a beach??), but it seemed like tone-wise it should be separate from this (which very much accidentally ended up being angsty).
“Yeah, I know, Cas,” Dean groaned, and as his head rolled back to the lumpy mattress and its probably-germ-filled blanket, he caught a flicker across Cas’s face. It was too fast to track everything—widening eyes, narrowing eyes, lips pursing slightly, biting lips together, ducking his head.
“Cas is back,” Dean said. He could tell he was grinning like an idiot; wide and beaming and giddy, but he couldn’t seem to stop.
Dean rolled his eyes. They’d done worse than California to Kansas in one go. But Sam was right, just this once—they’d gotten halfway across Utah and the highway had started to blur. It was like all that useless dust from Nevada had bled into the car and snuck in under their eyes. Ten hours was enough for the day. They could do the same tomorrow and be done.
“I do not...” Castiel feels his throat go taut, never having questioned that before. “I do not know.”
It all went fuzzy; Cas’s movements slowing as Dean went boneless, all his muscles suddenly limp. He blinked through the fog and felt careful hands roll him over; felt a warm wetness slide along his stomach briefly, and he breathed heavily, trying to get his bearings on the world. When he could see clearly again, Cas was hovering beside the bed.
“They’re really happy,” Dean said offhandedly, later, as he sat in the grass with Charlie and watched Sam and Eileen dance in the quiet evening moonlight. Everyone had trooped off to sleep, either in hotels or back home or in a spare room of the bunker.
Dean’s boots scuffed along the pavement as he walked the long path around the furthest edge of the motel, back towards the parking lot and the office. He didn’t like that the clerk had stuck them in the ass of the motel, either—where he couldn’t even see the Impala out the window. But the motel was cheap, it was there, and it bragged that the restaurant attached to its neck had
Cas pushed himself off the wall and took a measured step closer, his eyes never leaving Dean’s. “You want me...to hurt you,” he repeated, and he took another step, until their chests were close together; Dean could count the eyelashes curling around Cas’s eyes. “To push back.”
His shirt fell with a soft noise to the floor and his arms prickled with goosebumps as Cas slowly stepped closer.
“Doesn't take much, hardly a push,” the old man says. “Oh America- all you can eat all of the time, consume consume, a swarm of locusts in stretch pants, and yet you're all still starving because hunger doesn't just come from the body, it comes from the soul.”
Castiel wonders sometimes if he ought to create some kind of system, progress slowly through time and look for the man. But he can't bring himself to do that- it would take too much effort. It would take thousands of visits for every day in Biggerson's history, and he wants to get lucky for once, find the man with just a shred of good fortune. And besides, chances are, the man hasn't been to the future or the past, and only has a small window of time during which he's visited Biggerson's, maybe forty years. When he thinks about it, his whole modus operandi doesn't make sense. He's relying wholly on the idea that he'll stumble into the man again- he's managed it twice before, after all. He sighs again, wondering why he even bothers. He ought to stick to the location he found the man before, shovel through the debris of time until finding that same moment. But he could run into himself again, that's the whole problem.
Dean laughed, imagining a life that simple. Religion. It was funny, no matter how many times he got confirmation that it was all real; not just the whole God and angels thing but all of it, every strange little belief people had and held to fervently or dismissed as delusion or imagination...every time, it made him believe in
Then, sudden and frigid as an unwelcome breeze, Cas stepped away, and Dean’s shoulder and cheek and lips went cold, and he fell forward, catching himself on one hand before scrambling up as Cas turned and walked away.
“Uh,” Dean said. Every coherent thought he’d ever managed to conjure had vanished from his mind, leaving just vague tendrils of…
“Ah,” he said, and his fingers tightened on Dean’s jaw, hard enough that the points where his fingers dug into the skin burned. “I didn’t say you could touch.”
“I’m real,” Benny said, raising his arms in a shrug. “Far as I could tell. And, uh. Human, far as I can tell. Woke up next to the Impala.”
“I don’t understand why—why you would want me,” Dean said breathlessly. “I’m—I’m broken. Always have been, I don’t—I can’t—”
“Go back, this screen, go back,” Castiel says. “There! That one!” he shouts, pointing at a different one.
Dean just hummed reluctantly for him to go on, staring fixedly at the TV screen even though he couldn’t for the life of him say what was on.
He meant to say something, say what he was afraid of—of losing Cas, of letting him down, of disappointing his dead father—but the words died in his throat. Cas’s hands slid away, and Dean’s gaze dropped to the floor, a weight pulling at his chest.
Dean’s eyes snapped open. He remembered the alley, he remembered the way Cas threw him against the wall like he weighed nothing. He remembered the way Cas pressed himself up against Dean, the way he could feel every inch of him, the way his eyes burned bright and furious. Cas pulled at Dean’s hip as he pushed forward, settling deep into Dean. Dean waited for him to move, but Cas held still,
Dean froze, halfway down the stairs. In the middle of the bunker, standing there like nothing had ever changed, trenchcoat and all, was Cas.
“He’s human,” Dean blurted, the knowledge still burning warm and soft in his chest. Sam nodded slowly, making a ‘well, okay’ sort of face, lips downturned.
Cas reached for Dean’s plate immediately, dragging it over to him. He picked up the burger and sunk his teeth into it, biting off a sizeable portion. His eyes lifted up to meet Dean’s as he lowered the burger and began to chew, his lips shiny with grease and donut glaze. Dean reached out and dragged the plate back.
It took moments for Dean to fall asleep then, and Castiel was quite amused by how quickly Dean managed to curl around him, one leg shifting free of the blankets to tangle itself with Castiel's legs.
Dean is the first- and perhaps last- mystery that has ever bothered Castiel. He has witnessed the inexplicable, things that are as supernatural as him, but nothing has captured his curiosity as thoroughly as Dean.
Had this Cas ever looked at someone the way 2014’s Cas looked at Dean? Had he ever lifted his eyes slow and heady, like they were weighed down by his dark eyelashes; put that honey-thick layer of want on a word to show someone exactly what he was really saying?
Benny reached towards him, and Dean stayed where he was sprawled, boneless and placid against the couch cushions. His hand was huge and as it pressed to Dean’s cheek, Dean realized he felt almost
he’d felt when he saw the ring box, or if Sam had prayed to Cas even though he didn’t know Cas was out of the empty.
“They just messed up,” Dean said. He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. “Charged me for a double.”
Sam’s little antiquities dealer plan had turned into a real job with a real fake identity, and Eileen, being a stable and much more normal person than Dean or Sam, found a real job that was even more normal. And they found a house that was the normalest thing of all. A ranch with a, no joke, white picket fence. And it was only a thirty minute drive, for all that Dean complained about the distance.
“I’ll keep looking,” Sam said. He tucked the paper into the spell book and shut it with a sigh. “I gotta get home tonight, though.”
“What, you’re too good to get angry?” Dean snapped, and he stepped back slightly, his fists curling at his sides. “Wouldn’t stoop to that level? Wouldn’t just hit me back?”
“Ah, you can smirk and joke and lie to your brother and lie to yourself, but not to me. I can see inside you, Dean. I can see how broken you are, how defeated. You can't win and you know it but you just keep fighting, just keep going through the motions. You're not hungry, Dean, because inside you're already dead.”
Cas tilted his head side to side. “Like you’ve gotten good news but you don’t know how to break the news.”
“There’s nothing near this place,” Dean said, shaking his head. “I’m not leaving the bunker just to go be a grease monkey for some asshole in Junction City or something.”
Cas took a step closer, and Dean felt his heart in his throat. For all the time that it had been since they’d first met—face to face, anyway—in that barn, sometimes it felt like they were still there, standing toe to toe, staring each other down. Cas’s eyes sometimes had that same cold burn to them, the inescapable feeling of being seen past the walls other people couldn’t see past.
“Is it me?” Cas said, his voice low as he pushed at Dean’s jaw, tipping his head back effortlessly. His thumb tugged at Dean’s lip, catching against it. “Maybe...you think that it’s the only way I’ll touch you.”
“Cas wouldn’t judge you if you found love here,” Charlie said. “If you didn’t spend your life waiting. He’d probably be happy.”
Porky’s was starting to feel familiar. He walked in—Saturday night this time, he was pretty sure—and took his usual seat, the one with the rip down the side of the cushion.
“Yeah, yeah, I don’t want to hear it, sunshine,” Dean said. “You told me to order it. If you wanted me to be healthy, you shouldn’t’ve asked for it.”
Six months passed in purgatory, and towards the end, it was eerily quiet and empty, so nearly every night they would lie together as Dean slept. Dean even stopped leaping away in the morning, he would just disentangle himself from Castiel and lie next to him, their sides pressed together until one of them finally stood up.
But it was all gone, and he was in some sort of vacuum, a dark and empty and suffocatingly tight space that wouldn’t let him move or breath or speak. Maybe he was wrong, maybe he wasn’t designated for heaven like he’d thought. Maybe there were some sins that even Jack couldn’t overlook.
“We’re a good team, man,” Dean said the next morning as they climbed into the impala, cleaned off after showers at their motel and in blissfully un-bloodstained clothing.
again. Castiel had cursed himself at the time, realizing that he should have been using an old camera, one that would print the picture immediately so that he could write down the location of the Biggerson' the picture had come from. He had shook his head at his own stupidity- he'd gotten so enveloped in taking the photographs that he hadn't been looking at the restaurants until he went back through to look back. If he started doing both those things- looking and labeling, then he could see
“I have hurt you before,” Cas said slowly, and his hands slid down from Dean’s lapels, brushing across his torso before he raised one and carefully, deliberately, pressed a hand against Dean’s sternum, high enough that his fingertips ghosted at his collarbone.
When Dean emerged back into the main room, everyone was gone. He walked down towards the bedrooms, glanced into his own empty bedroom, and heard the murmur of voices from Sam’s old room.
He positions himself by the random plant in the corner, as he always does, and raises his camera, about to take the picture, when he hears a shout.
Sam found it a little strange that his brutish brother, who considered that kind of contact 'wimpy', would be leaning on the angel, but he didn't mention it. He simply returned to the motel room and waited for Dean to enter. Castiel hadn't noticed Sam in the parking lot, so it took a while, as Dean was a moderately heavy sleeper.
He really meant everyone. Every last living soul had vanished. The highway was like a slalom course of weaving back and forth between abandoned cars in either lane. The radio stations crackled absently, nobody left to put on the next track or make commentary about...anything. But Dean didn’t put in a cassette.
“I should’ve known,” Cas said, and he pushed forward slightly, finally, and Dean closed his eyes to better feel the slight burn and stretch and heat. “That moment in the alley—you’d have let me do this then, wouldn’t you? I felt the longing, I thought you wanted death, but you wanted
Castiel waits until the two men sit down to walk up to them. He knows that he shouldn't, he knows that he should just take a picture and leave again, but he's curious.
Dean sighed. “Listen,” he said, glancing at her nametag, “Maria. I may be tired, but I’m not blind. There’s only one bed in there.”
“Not him, either,” Cas hummed, and a second finger pressed beside the first, and Dean yelped. Cas’s other hand gripped his ribs tighter, hard enough that Dean knew he’d be bruised, pale blue ghostly smudges of fingerprints across his ribcage.
Dean jerked, Cas’s voice suddenly echoing in his head, berating the use of Jesus’s name in vain. Old Cas—the crotchety, pouting angel of the lord Dean used to know.
His eyes flicked open, and that blue, blue, blue made the shadows seem pale and grey. Dean flinched, feeling as though he’d been caught at something he shouldn’t be doing.
“I like to think it's because of my strength of character,” Dean says, and Castiel smiles into the meat. He recognizes a hint of humor.
Dean trailed off. Sometimes, in his dreams, he and Cas would just sit side by side, staring out at an image of the world. Other times, they would talk about nothing for what felt like hours, just like they did every day but face to face. The feeling of the dream always clung there, though, and dream-Dean felt syrupy and distant; dream-Cas felt like a mirage that flickered away if Dean tried to get too close. It wasn’t the same as really being together. Sometimes, Dean was afraid that if they found each other on another plane of existence, it still wouldn’t feel real. And Dean couldn’t help but picture himself old and contorted by age, facing an unchanged Castiel, a shining angel of the lord made only more brilliant by time, if he survived long enough for Cas to come to Earth. That was stupid. Dean knew it was. He'd rolled his eyes at the idea of fearing being too old for your immortal...love, when watching one of those godforsaken Twilight movies. But his hips already hurt in the mornings; sometimes he couldn't get a kink out of his neck for entire days on end. By the time Cas came to Earth, things wouldn't be the same. But Cas would be. Nevertheless...
Dean showed the others back to their guest quarters, even though they all knew their way around. Even if the reason for them all being here was grim, he couldn’t help but feel a bubbly lightness in him at the number of people who’d been in the bunker for almost a full week now.
The waitress popped up beside their table and set their plates in front of them with a grin. “Enjoy! she chirped. Dean stared down at the burger. Both buns were glazed donuts. A fried egg leaked yolk out from the middle of a burger patty and orange cheese.
“No, that’s normal, too,” he must’ve said a hundred times in the months leading up to the birth, and a hundred times in the hospital that night.
Dean scrambled to push Cas back against the bed and swing a leg over him. He gaped down at Cas, who laughed breathlessly, a wide grin on his face.
“That’s stupid, Dean,” Cas said vigorously, taking Dean’s silence as affirmation. He gestured at the two beds. “There’s nothing—nothing strange, or, or
Sam was looking at him extra strange now, and he took another bite of pie with a new fork from the tray. He was hallucinating again. Which was great. Maybe if he begged and pleaded, Cas could at least fix his brain this time so he didn’t go crazy with visions of Cas on the side of the road again.
His hands slammed against Cas’s chest, every part of his palms pressing against the warm, soft fabric of Cas’s shirt; his fingers curling over the edges of his coat; fingertips digging in as he pushed.
After they’d been sitting on the couch for a while, some TV show murmuring quietly in the background, Benny turned and considered Dean with a steady, appraising look.
His feet carried him back down the hall, and he shuffled into the bathroom tiredly. Who were they to decide that their lives—
“What happened, Dean?” Cas said, nearly a growl. He stalked closer, looming over Dean where he was sprawled half-collapsed against the car.
The next few Biggerson's are stuffed full of people, and Castiel gets pictures quickly, not quite at ease around the large crowds.
Dean reaches for something in his coat, and Castiel turns and walks quickly around the corner, hearing Dean's footsteps behind him. Castiel glances over his shoulder as he enters the broom closet, and sees that Dean is only a few steps behind.
“Got any big plans after you close up?” Dean asked as Thomas came around to give his usual ‘closing time’ comment.
with him? He slept again, ate again, watched more shitty television, and was back at Porky’s. And again. And again. His phone kept buzzing, always Charlie.
Dean cracked open his next beer and pushed at the swelling feeling in his chest. Resentment? Or maybe just plain fear. Maybe Cas hadn’t meant what he said that way, but now that he was a full angel again he could feel the desperation rolling off Dean in waves and needed some space. Maybe—
Dean nodded, leaning slightly to see Josie tucked into the center of the large bed, her dark curls flooding the pillow under her head. Eileen sat at the side of the bed, rubbing lotion into her hands and watching Dean with calm, curious eyes.
Sam paused, eyeing his brother with skepticism. “I mean, what’s your next move? All this freedom...what’ll it be?”
They took a turn about the impromptu dance floor, Charlie laughing when Dean dipped or spun her with a bit too much vigor. And if Dean imagined a rougher, larger hand in his as they shifted to the rhythmic buzz of the cicadas and the hum of the crickets...he figured Charlie would understand.
Dean dropped his duffle bag on the small, sagging brown loveseat against the wall across from the bed and sighed.
"Dean!" he called, watching Dean's spine stiffen as he slowed to a normal paced walk before stopping at the car.
Dean left and got in his car quickly, not wanting to make eye contact with the bartender as he drove off. He used to be able to burn through people like they didn’t even matter, like they were just objects. He didn’t—he didn’t think it was a good thing, but god, maybe it would be nice to go back to that once in a while.
Towards the front of one of the notebooks is a small section of notes on encounters with Dean- there isn't much to write, but there's a notebook dedicated to him nonetheless. Six pages describing the encounters, plus twelve pages filled with terrible sketches of Dean. The scratched lines and attempted sparkly eyes are a miserable failure at capturing Dean. One has managed to depict his mix of delicate features and masculine facial structure, but his eyes appear dead and far too small.
Dean gritted his teeth. Of course he was lonely. Of course he was lonely! How could he not be? He wanted to just scream at Cas sometimes. Everyone was doing good at this whole normalcy thing. Charlie was engaged, for god’s sake. And Dean was just—wandering around talking to a voice in his head like that was a good way to spend your life. And the worst part was, he didn’t mind that part. That was the part of his life that
Sam sighed. “Dean, I don’t know why you felt like you couldn’t tell me, but it’s okay. It doesn’t matter to me. It’s a little
“Or,” Cas said, his chin lowered as he stared at Dean. “Is it that you just want to feel...something.”
Sam threw up his hands and muttered something. Dean was pretty sure it was something along the lines of ‘fucking profound bond.’
Cas reached out and gripped the front of Dean’s t-shirt tightly, his fingers twisting the fabric so it pulled forward and the collar tugged at the back of his neck.
Dean shook his head but couldn’t help but smile as he took the top donut off the burger—the one untouched by the yolk slime—and frowned down at the rest of the burger.
He set the bottles down in the sink without throwing any of them and shook his head slightly. He wasn’t sure how he’d manage to sleep, with the adrenaline coursing in him. His hands were still shaking slightly, his body nowadays unused to so many stimuli.
“You know,” Cas said thoughtfully, one of his hands sliding down Dean’s sweat-slick spine as the other held him up by the waist. “When I’ve imagined you like this, I always thought you’d be controlling. Mean, even. I never imagined something like this.”
Dean couldn’t get himself to do anything but stand there and watch as Benny picked up his bag and walked towards him. Benny clapped a hand to Dean’s shoulder and stood there for a moment before he gave him a nod and started towards the stairs.
Dean lifted his head. Thomas the bartender was leaning on the other side of the bar, one eyebrow raised at Dean.
“It doesn’t matter anyway,” Jack said lightly. He stepped closer and patted Dean’s shoulder. The touch sent crawling, nauseous waves through Dean’s body, and he couldn’t pinpoint why. He'd never been a big fan of the idea of God in the first place, he figured. Even before he knew Him.
Nothing filled that silence. Not the music he cranked loud in the car, not the roar of the engine, not the dull, muddled cacophony of the bar he ended up in. Someone kept playing Elton  John on the jukebox, and if he heard
“Your fault?” Jack asked. He frowned. “Dean, I know everything now. I know what happened. That wasn’t your fault.”
Cas’s eyes narrowed. Dean’s breath was going too fast, but he couldn’t slow it down, couldn’t make his hands not shake.
The news story begins with a description of Dean and Sam's crimes. They are horrific, and Castiel's stomach feels empty and uncomfortable. This continues for most of the article. The author of the article comments proudly that they 'did some extensive research' into the boys and 'uncovered some revealing things'. It is then explained that in some old records from Kansas the author found that Sam and Dean's mother had died in a house fire that nearly killed the boys and their father, too. The author describes with words illustrating shock that from that point on, there were little to no records of the Winchesters as children. There were a few school records of the Winchester boys, but even those supposedly disappeared a few years after the fire.
Dean shifted slightly closer—until he could feel Cas’s warmth; could feel the cold of his feet, the brush of his skin. He couldn’t help it—wanting. He’d imagined having—isn’t that what wanting is? But he’d never expected this. But in this dark, worn-down motel room tucked away at the back of a third-rate Utah roadside motel, he had it. If he wasn’t so tired, or so drained by the quiet adrenaline he’d been pummeled with since he walked into this room, he might laugh. If he ever dared tell Sam any part of this story, they’d be able to laugh about it together—the way that there was something so
"I think I'm going out, actually," Dean said. He stormed out of the motel room, slamming the door rather loudly. Castiel stood up, giving Sam a confused glance before following Dean out.
Cas leaned down over him, one hand pressing into the bed beside Dean’s head, the other still gripping Dean’s hip to hold him up, to make sure that when his hips snapped forward, every inch of him drove deeper into Dean.
His head slipped down across the seat and onto Castiel's shoulder, and Castiel sat still, doing his best to keep the tired man asleep. Sam woke up panicked in the morning, finding Dean's bed empty and the sheets tangled, but calmed down when he ran outside and found him sleeping on Castiel's shoulder.
Dean opened the door as he spoke the last word of the spell and lunged forward. The thing was at the foot of the bed, its hands curled around the ankles of a husband and wife who were staring blankly at a TV at the foot of the bed. Dean’s hands clamped down on its back; the texture of the thing like smoke and water made solid. Relief and fear struck through his heart, and then everything was gone.
Dean moved slow up the stairs, already murmuring the spell. The parents’ bedroom door had a warm light spilling out from the crack at the bottom of the door. They probably didn’t even realize what was happening to them. It seemed like everyone who’d been killed just kept going about their mundane evening activities as if they weren’t being drained of life. Once the thing got its nails into its prey, they’d forget they ever saw its grotesque shadow and would sit there and take their slaughter like drugged sheep. If this worked, and if his body were to be left behind, Dean figured the family would be pretty damn confused. They’d stir awake as if they’d been dozing, even though they would be sure they’d been awake all along. A strange man would be in their bedroom, bleeding from both hands, and dead as soon as they realized he was there. Dean would almost think it was funny, if not for the fact he was the one who would be dead.
He knew how that conversation would go, though. It would go like every conversation of that ilk had gone with Cas—it would come across as an accusation, like Dean didn’t understand why Cas couldn’t be on Earth; that he had things he needed to handle elsewhere and that the time it would take would pass much faster on Earth...He did understand. He just didn’t like it.
“That’s why you ignored me for so long?” Dean asked. “What, decided you’d answer maybe a third of my prayers?”
“Phone call,” he mouthed, gesturing vaguely. She backed away, quickly returning to the festival proper.
“It doesn’t undo the fact that he left you here to throw a decade-long pity party,” Charlie said, crossing her arms. Sam leaned against a bookshelf, staring Cas down like he expected him to sprout wings and fly off if he looked away for too long.
Footsteps shuffled softly on the deck just behind him, and Dean turned his head only slightly. He didn’t feel quite like he could control his body here—inside, he was gasping, twisting around and lunging desperately. Running, the way he’d run for the door when Lucifer came calling as Cas.
Dean fell asleep still in his jeans. He realized immediately when he woke up and his whole body felt grimy and stiff in a way only sleeping in your clothes could accomplish. His phone was buzzing, and the light coming in front outside was glaringly, painfully bright. The alarm clock said it was one in the afternoon, and Dean blinked at it disbelievingly for a moment. He was pretty sure he’d knocked out around three.
Castiel nods, reaching for the mouse. His scrolling is ragged and awkward, and the boy hesitates, as if to check for Castiel's ability.
“So you can’t come to Earth and...intervene in person, but this is fine?” Dean asked. “You want me to just go about my life for a few decades but I have you in my ear?”
“How do you think, smartass?” Charlie said. “If you go anywhere stupid, I’ll track you there, too. I see you’ve been getting your beauty sleep in the parking lot of an establishment called Porky’s.”
“Something like that,” Dean said tiredly. He wasn’t sure how much he’d drunk, but it was enough that he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to gracefully get from this barstool to the backseat of the impala.
“You know you can tell me,” Charlie said. She smiled innocently, tipping her head to the side. “What is it? Are you bored without a big quest to do? Did some girl turn you down at the bar last week? Oh, god, is Miracle sick? Did you—”
“You don’t like to share beds,” Cas said. The meatloaf stuck in the back of Dean’s throat and he reached for the water to quickly swallow it down so he wouldn’t choke or cough. Cas continued. “But you share food. You won’t use straws. But you don’t have a problem with feminine clothes.”
Sometimes, when Cas was casually exposed like he was now, his arms visible in a way that would’ve been hard to even picture for so many years, Dean wanted to reach out and touch. To feel—
“I’m not ‘normal people,’” Cas said, raising his hands and finger quoting as he spoke. A pang of fondness swam through Dean. He was the same dorky angel he’d always been. "And time in heaven does not pass the same as on earth, I don't know..."
“Cas, I know you like to not tell me fucking anything, but you need to tell me the truth. Did you bring Benny back to try and...replace you? Try and shuffle me off onto someone else? Try and…
“What are you doing here?” Cas asked urgently, almost shaking Dean with the hands at his shoulders. “You’re supposed to be alive.”
“No!” Dean exclaimed. Something clattered behind him and he turned to see a woman tossing a bag of trash in a dumpster staring at him in horror.
He raised his eyebrows at Castiel, glancing down at Dean, whose body was thoroughly wrapped around Castiel's. Castiel looked back at Sam for a moment before looking down at Dean's relaxed face and deciding that this was a good thing.
He could feel Cas’s breath ghosting at his back; prickling pleasure skittered from that warmth down his spine.
Dean pushed himself to the end of the bed and back to his feet, at the complaint of every stiff muscle in his body. He was getting too old for this—not just hunting, but driving for hours every day, sleeping in strange beds. Living underground. Using fake IDs. And— Well. All of it.
There are loud footsteps coming towards him, and Castiel rises, wiping the residue of beef from his chin.
There was a moment there—on his knees on the concrete, staring up at the woman he barely recognized from some past life—that he wondered if he and Sam were about to go out in the lamest way possible. Slaughtered by some overdramatic mimes.
It was almost like Dean left his body as they tried to figure out what the hell there was to do, once he found Sam and Jack. What was the point? What was the goddamn point, if everyone was gone?
Something creaked in the bunker, louder than the thundering pulse in Dean’s ears, and Dean’s hand went to the gun in his waistband, lingering near the handle of the gun. The bunker made lots of noises; thumps and bangs and creaks and groans of pipes and walls shifting and a million other things. He kept his eyes on Benny; tried to feel out what the hell the feeling pulsing in him was. Was he just frustrated, or was there—could there be something?
Every breath caught in Dean’s throat. He couldn’t—couldn’t put it into words, couldn’t say the things he’d imagined, quietly at the back of his mind where he could pretend that he wasn’t thinking of it.
talk to Cas, not just tell him everything he does all day and listen as Cas does the same; not just tell him about a terrible movie Sam made him watch or listen as Cas explained fondly some strange thing Jack said (which usually was something either quite ordinary that Cas was actually the odd one out on, or something so unfathomably bizarre and uncomfortable that Dean had to threaten to put Cas on mute even if he could do no such thing).
” Jody said from her perch on the stairs. Dean shot a glare up at her, but she already looked chagrined, like she hadn’t meant to speak out loud at all. There was a whole damn peanut gallery up there. Jody cringed and turned towards the others, saying something quiet that made them all slowly trudge back up and out of the bunker.
“Well, we could try telling the family we think it’s targeting,” Sam said, running a hand through his hair. It was getting thin, his hairline inching backwards steadily, and Dean brushed a hand over his own hair, which was doing pretty damn well with age. He always knew Sam would be the one to go bald. Cared too damn much about his hair.
“Cas?” Dean said. His feet felt like they weighed a hundred pounds. He took one heavy step down the stairs, one step closer.
“Don’t lie to me,” Cas said, his chin tipping up slightly as he stared down his nose at Dean. “You think I can’t tell? You think I can’t
Dean’s boots were lead weights as he trudged out of the room. Through the bunker. Up the stairs. Out the door. His boot was heavy on the accelerator, too, taking him to the location texted by Sam amidst hours of other texts.
Dean’s fingers tingled restlessly at his sides, and he raised them, grasping at Cas’s coat as he stared up at him. What did he want? It was too much to name; too much to take. It was everything—the feeling that chased him, the feeling that caught in his throat when he glanced over his shoulder and found that Cas was still watching even as Dean walked away, the feeling that curled in the pit of his stomach when Cas’s hands twitched towards him but never touched.
Then, in the dream, he opened his eyes. Light glimmered off tiny ripples in the water in front of him, shading against the impenetrable dark of the lake at his feet. His boots were laced perfectly, like someone had knelt down and done it for him without the brutality of his usual triple knots. His jeans were sun-soaked, heat lamps pressed up against his legs, and he had to squint against the brightness of the sun in the cloudless sky. He’d been here before.
Thomas hovered over him, his movements paused at Dean’s motion. Dean’s face felt hot suddenly; his breaths felt tight and too fast in his chest.
“I, uh.” Dean fiddled with the car keys and stuffed them into his pocket. “I should tell you what happened with Cas. You deserve to know that it was my fault.”
He shakes his head and leaves, moving to a new hotel. He sits down on the bed, staring down at his hands. He doesn't understand anything he has experienced, from the electronics store to the alleyway, and he feels strangely emptied of emotion and comprehension.
“What? No,” Dean said, almost knocking over his beer bottle as he reached for Charlie’s flailing hands. “No, I…”
“Excuse me,” Castiel says, and looks up at the woman. She is sneering at him, and when he meets her eyes she laughs.
“Okay,” Cas said, and he dumped his bag on the mattress above Dean’s head, one of the nylon straps hitting Dean on the forehead. “Sorry.”
And extremely rarely, only when he began to get bored with his locations, he would arrive just outside the restaurant, by the dumpsters. When he felt extremely daring, of course, that was when he'd arrive in the restaurant itself, tempting fate and checking how observant Biggerson's customers were.
There was no reply. Dean often wondered if he just didn’t have the knack for praying in his mind. That is...if he didn’t have the knack for doing it on purpose. Just last week he’d been taking a long, lazy morning shower and had slipped into thoughts of Cas...and of course that had been one of the few times Cas seemed to hear Dean’s internal invocation of the angel’s name. His voice in Dean’s head, sudden and gone as soon as it had arrived—just there long enough to say Dean’s name in a confused, almost bleary voice before Dean could
Dean stopped in the hall, turning to Cas and taking his face with both hands, kissing the confusion right off his face. Dean couldn't help the lingering fear in his heart, that this wasn't real, that he didn't deserve this, that Cas would leave, that something would go wrong...but a splinter of hope was starting to work its way into the cracks. Maybe, he thought, they'd be alright.
