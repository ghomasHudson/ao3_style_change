“How’re you still hard?” Steve slurred out, his head flush with the pillow he had been clawing at, the cushion looking as worn as Steve felt. “Come, Tony,” Steve cooed, finding enough energy to turn over on his back, looking adoringly at the genius. “Want you to take all that you want of me.”
Steve walked into his apartment, gym bag in hand. He had just did a work out at a gym that had a feeling of old, a rustic space with crackled leather and the smell of chalk powder floating in the dim lighting. Steve was in a zone as he had pounded at the heavy bag, thinking of the past, with his friends in the war, with Peggy...and before Bucky fell. Now Steve was alone, in a world that was both full of curiosities and crippling unfamiliarities.
“No way,” Tony said with the shake of his head. “It’s gotta be one for the books. And hey, friends go on adventures all the time. I mean, that’s how the movies show it. Like
The genius sat on his old couch in the lab, screw driver in hand as he twirled it aimlessly in his palms. He wasn’t thinking about anything in particular, just the solitude and low whirring that surrounded him. Tony grabbed the remote and turned on the large flat screen that perched on the wall in front of him. He flipped to a main NEWS channel, needing a distraction from the lonely silence that began to eat at him. The brunette wasn’t overly interested in the weather, or whatever sports team was in the play-offs. What sport season were they in now anyways? Hockey? Baseball?
He went about the rest of the day as well as the next two days trying to keep himself busy, so that he wasn’t left daydreaming about Tony and his charming smile. By the third day without getting a glimpse of the genius, Steve became genuinely worried, though. When he saw Bruce walking out of the communal kitchen, he had to stop the man.
His flagrant problem underneath his pajama pants wasn’t going away anytime soon though. So, Steve waddled to his bathroom then, standing before the toilet and lowering his pants. Taking hold of his erection, Steve closed his eyes and bit his lip, stroking himself fervently and trying to get it over as quickly as possible so that he didn’t indulge in his fantasies. He tried desperately to not think about the way Tony’s rough hands felt on his body in his dream, or the way the brunette kissed him, causing Steve to elicit sweet and sultry moans…
“Lift your hips for me, beloved,” Tony whispered, grabbing hold of the blonde’s waistline. Steve abided, angling his hips up so that Tony slid his pants down with ease. Steve also kicked his socks off, helping the man out some and leaving him in nothing but his grey briefs. Tony traced a finger on the underside of Steve’s foot, tickling him there.
“In love with Steve,” Tony muttered to himself as he thought of the man’s cerulean eyes and kind smile. Tony scoffed. He really wasn’t gonna think about Steve’s appearance now. His strong physique and chiseled features had nothing to do with anything.
“J, hit the light, would ya?” Tony mumbled, and the light in the bedroom faded out then. Steve could feel his boyfriend’s body slacken under him.
“Fiiine,” Steve said, looking back at Tony with a grin, his pupils dilated. That look alone could have made Tony take Steve right then and there. But Tony had something else in mind for the super soldier. Pressing a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, the brunette nosed his way down Steve’s spine, nipping at the muscles in his back before he got down on his knees once more, wiping the backs of Steve legs.
“Uh,” Steve said intelligently, his body becoming extremely warm, his shirt collar rather tight. Tony just laughed then, turning away to plop down on the bed.
“It is very different,” Tony agreed, taking hold of the large ring at the one end of the rubber strand. “That doesn’t mean I’m not up for the task,” he added, licking his lips and smiling mischievously. He saw Steve’s face, which had been etched with self-doubt, instantly light up like the North Star, his smile beaming, his blue eyes glistening gleefully. “I take it you’ve done your research on this particular toy?” Tony queried then, setting the now empty container on the one nightstand.
“Mmmm, Tony, you’re so gorgeous like that. I love hearing your moans,” Steve said, shifting his hand in a tight grip over his arousal, exhaling in content as his eyes fixated on Tony’s leaking head.
Tony didn’t say anything, he didn’t need to, Steve could read the unadulterated love he had for him in his gaze. Tony leaned up, pressing his mouth softly to Steve’s. They kissed unhurriedly, the lust of earlier falling away, leaving only warm affection fluttering through them.
When Tony slowly undressed him the rest of the way, a pulsing heat flickered within his belly, his body reacting to the simple intimate act of being stripped down. Under the brunette’s gaze Steve wasn’t sure what to do, ringing his hands a few times before letting them fall at his sides. He couldn’t help but feel rather grubby though, he didn’t have time to clean up before they went to their bedroom.
“Oh, come on, Steve. You and I both know you have at least three orgasms in you tonight,” Tony said, a cocky grin on his face when Steve glowered at him. “Alright, fine,” Tony gave in, leaning in and tugging at Steve’s panties, the blonde lifting his hips to help him along. He heard Steve take a deep breath of relief, some of the pressure on his throbbing cock gone. The sight of his boyfriend’s aroused penis left Tony’s mouth watering, his own penis craving attention underneath his dress pants. He pushed that thought aside though, bending down to take Steve in his mouth, lapping at the salty precome that bubbled at the swollen head. He licked his way down the man’s length, using a hint of teeth as he worried at the engorged vein. Steve always tasted so good.
In an instant, Tony was off the bed, taking a hold of Steve’s legs and pulling him to the edge of the mattress. He hoisted his love’s legs up and spread them once again, showing Steve’s sloppy, loosened entrance. The blonde looped his arms under his thighs, holding them as he waited for the genius’s next move.
“What’s all this for, love?” Steve asked, taking a seat next to Tony on the lounge bed, giving the man a soft, languid kiss.
“I may not have ever had a blow job, but you never gave one before,” Steve said slyly as Tony slid his hands up Steve’s muscular thighs and to the elastic waistband of his underwear.
He worked his way down Steve’s back, licking and biting at the man’s sides, the blonde’s pleasurable sighs spurring him on. He mouthed at the silky fabric that covered a small area of Steve’s broad back, shifting it up then to kiss the warm skin. When he reached the man’s ass, he pressed a kiss to the top of each plush cheek, slipping a finger down the cleft till he found Steve’s entrance. He could hear the moans coming from Steve, the anticipation bubbling within him as Tony teased the tight flesh of his opening.
Steve couldn’t help but to roll his eyes at the genius. “Lavender, Tony. Geez, we haven’t even done anything yet,” Steve sighed, his voice giving away his slight impatience. He knew Tony was being conscientious and caring, but Steve was ready for the man to get the show on the road.
“Too bad I don’t have a dollar on me so I could stick it in your lingerie,” Tony chuckled, sipping his wine as he watched his silly lover.
“You wanna know what I think?” Natasha said after a pause. “From one friend to another, I think you should talk to him. Be honest. You taught me that honesty is best,” she laughed lightly, her bluish green eyes soft. If he’s truly your friend, he won’t slight you for it. Hell, he may even have something to reveal to you too.”
He heard Tony say “so good,” over and over before Steve felt the man’s lips kissing up his spine, settling on the nape of his neck. That was what seemed to drag him down to earth, all of his beloved’s languid kisses. Steve turned his head, opening his eyes to see Tony smiling down at him, petting his sweaty blonde hair.
"No thanks, buddy," Tony responded to the A.I. Though Tony had an internship program for prospecting students, this project was his own, and he didn’t want it in any other hands.
Tony felt like he was gonna explode in his pants at the sight of his love kneeling and waiting for him. He merely stared at him before remembering he needed to in fact get undressed. Right. Tony fiddled with his belt buckle as he bolted towards the bedside table, grabbing up a lube from the drawer before practically running back to Steve.
“Hey, Stevie,” Tony said, leaning in for a quick kiss before swiveling his chair so he could face his boyfriend. “I see you got your Easter basket.” He took in the sight of Steve in the new lingerie garment, his eyes taking in every fine detail. Steve stared at Tony the whole time, watching the man’s reactions as he perused over Steve’s frame. He took the initiative to turn around so Tony could see the back, and when he heard the brunette take in a sharp breath, Steve smiled proudly. He had hoped for that reaction. It was only a moment before he felt Tony’s hands on his bare back, slowly trailing them down to his waistline.
“I know,” Steve replied. “I just don’t want you to find me to be, not masculine because of it,” Steve confessed.
“S’good,” Steve sighed, the massage like feeling enough to add to his yearning for release. Tony was silent as he continued, only to speak as he came to the last few beads.
Steve did just that. Tony helped him keep his balance, arms tight around Steve’s back. Steve watched the brunette, eyes never wavering as he drifted one hand down to his erection, the other playing with the pebbled peak of a nipple. Steve let out sounds that were absolutely obscene. Tony was pretty sure he could put porn stars to shame. Steve touching himself was fucking heaven too, watching the man work himself up by his own touches was wonderfully erotic.
“Mhmm,” Steve hummed. When he felt Tony close behind him, Steve pushed his bum back, rubbing in against Tony’s aroused length.
"Oh, Steve," Tony said, sticking his free hand into his pocket, and the way Tony said his name made the super soldier's chest swell. Tony took out an object from his pant pocket and Steve realized it was his bookmark, and the blonde swallowed thickly. He had completely forgot about that before he gave Tony the gift.
He couldn’t help but to arch away at that sudden height of bliss that ricocheted within him. Breathing hard, Steve tried to speak, asking for more, but forming words seemed to be quite the challenge. Instead, the super soldier simply pushed back, his actions showing the need and desire that pulsed in his veins.
When he felt Tony’s cock was substantially coated with the slick gel, Steve released his boyfriend, shifting himself over Tony’s length. Tony helped guide him, lining Steve’s ass up with his erection. “Wait, Steve. I barely opened you up. I don’t wanna hurt you,” Tony said, a finger rubbing at the man’s opening, the pad of it barely slipping inside.
Muted voices wafted around Steve, the man slowly opening his eyes as the eye adjusted to the lighting in the room. He recognized Natasha and Sam hovering over him, both helping him sit up.
“Me too,” Tony interjected, his voice rather abrupt. “I’m curious though Steve, why the sudden yearning to call me now after you barely sent a few texts to me.” Tony wasn’t going to fool around. Steve needed to get this over with. He could see Steve’s eyes widen, biting his lip as he repositioned himself on the bed a bit. Was that guilt Tony saw on Steve’s expression?
“Please fuck me,” The blonde whispered, eyes falling closed as he begged his lover to appease him. Tony grinned and answered by lining his heavy erection with Steve’s hole. Instead of slipping inside the other man though, the genius tapped his length against the blonde’s entrance teasingly, watching Steve’s body wink and flutter, desiring to be filled.
Steve writhed under the ropes, trying to free himself when a man with a scar across his cheek wasted not a moment to spear Steve right in his side to maim him and his fierce actions. Steve yelled in pain, the wound crippling him as he nursed the bleeding laceration. The ropes were heavy, brushing his chest and arms raw as he weakly struggled to fend off the men on the ship, their weapons drawn.
It had been three years since they had met, and for three years, as the reality of their relationship became clear, they still fought their feelings.
This is a story about two such men, who through deep valleys of pain, anger and denial come to find that there’s a reason their lives have been so intertwined for centuries.
“Yeah, sure they are,” Steve laughed as well, only to gasp when he felt one of Tony’s hands trail down his spine and over the curve of his rump, his fingers leaving heated tickles along Steve’s skin. The super soldier let out a boyish giggle jerking away from his love’s touch and pressing against the table, his penis sliding on the glossy, finished table. They’d have to clean the white mess of precome later, but Steve pushed that thought away as he felt both of Tony’s hands massaging at the thick flesh of his bum, his fingers digging in while his palms caressed each cheek in circular movements.
“Thought you could use a break from all the strenuous online sessions and conference calls you’ve had for the past few days,” Steve said softly, leaning down to kiss Tony right on the lips. Tony happily reciprocated, exploring the soft pink pillows of Steve’s mouth, drinking the man in with a heady kiss of his own.
Once he reached the very top of the underbust corset, Tony sat Steve up, unlatching the hook and eye fastenings at the front of the garment as was usually seen in traditional corsets. Tony allowed for the lingerie to simply fall away once the last hook was undone, leaving Steve in nothing but the panties he wore, and the ribbon around his wrists. Steve’s newly exposed skin tingled as the cool air hit it, sending goosebumps blooming all over him. The blonde also knew he was reacting to Tony’s wandering eye, which took in every inch of recently revealed skin and muscle.
The brunette kissed him back softly, his beard pleasantly brushing against his chin. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s bare back, pulling him close as he deepened the kiss. Tony’s warm tongue caressed his own, tasting his teeth and the soft flesh of his cheeks. Enthralled in their kissing, Steve barely realized Tony was standing them both up, his hands blindly unzipping the fly of the super soldier’s uniform.
Overwhelmed with emotions and sensations, Steve stilled his rutting against the pillows. The blonde stared at the small headboard of the lounge bed, his eyes almost glazed as he focused on what Tony was doing to his body behind him.
Steve felt his already hard arousal twitch at the thought. “Yes,” he bit out, his vivid imagination getting the better of him. Steve quickly leaned in and devoured Tony into a searing kiss, tongue searching for entrance into his boyfriend’s mouth. Tony allowed him eagerly, his hands wrapping around Steve’s back once more, trying to get a firm grip over the slippery fabric. While his tongue explored the warmth of Tony’s mouth, Steve’s nimble fingers quickly began undoing the rest of the button latches on Tony’s shirt. It should be illegal for the man to wear clothes at all times, Steve thought, giggling to himself before pulling away. He looked at Tony, his pupils blown as they both took a moment to catch their breath. “I love you,” Steve said in between pants, a hand resting on the arc reactor on Tony’s chest, the other playing with the hem of his shirt. They had been dating for 10 months; it didn’t feel too early to reveal his true feelings for his boyfriend. He was confident and didn’t care if there was a chance Tony didn’t feel that way about him just yet. If he didn’t, he knew the genius would feel the same way for the super soldier eventually.
Tony rubbed at his jaw, groaning. He could feel himself fighting internally on what to do. He really had no desire to go see this guy who had been Howard’s own pride and joy. But Tony also felt this slight ache in his chest as he thought about the man in the profile, a man out of time, his blue eyes looking so unsure of everything.
Tentatively, Steve leaned forward, feeling his nose brush along Tony’s. He was close enough that he could smell the man’s faint cologne, and feel the warmth of his body. Steve held himself there, waiting for any sign that would say Tony was uncomfortable. The man didn’t though, and so, Steve moved in more, until his lips gently grazed the brunette’s own soft mouth. The kiss sent a wave of bliss through Steve, his heart revving up like an engine. Closing his eyes, he could hear Tony sigh, and before Steve pulled away, Tony began to move his lips over the blonde’s, smiling against Steve’s mouth and wrapping his arms around his shoulders.
“Alright, either way, we need to stick to the mission. The residents in this creature’s path are our first priority before anything else,” Steve said, looking to Clint and Natasha. “Stark, analyze its strategy and pattern. Thor, find out its weak spots.” They worked out their tactics and strategy then, settling on one that they had used for similar situations.
“Come here,” Tony said, pulling Steve on top of him and kissing him ravenously, his tongue licking Steve’s own as he cradled the blonde’s jaw in his hands. The blonde loved how his silk teddy slid against Tony’s chest and belly when they pressed together. Steve fought for dominance, his tongue slipping inside his lover’s mouth, tasting his teeth and the warm flesh of Tony’s inner cheek. Everything about the man was absolutely delicious.
“Steve,” Tony said softly, eyeing up the drawing. Steve smiled and looked at his art piece as well. “It’s beautiful, thank you,” Tony added, turning to place a sweet kiss to his love’s cheek. “We deserve a vacation like this. Wouldn’t you say?” The brunette asked, taking the drawing and carefully pinning it right in the middle of a corkboard he used for random design sketches and blue prints.
Tony didn’t notice the sincere blush that bloomed upon the sea creature’s cheeks and neck as the brunette observed him in wonderment.
“Hey, I’ve been meaning to tell you,” Tony started then, grasping Steve by the shoulder. Steve turned his head to see Tony staring at him, their faces remarkably close. So close that Steve could see the individual hairs in Tony’s van dyke beard. “Nick called me today, saying that we are to host a toy drive for the holidays this weekend,” Tony said, and Steve was merely watching Tony’s pink lips moving before he looked into the man’s brown eyes.
,” the brunette breathed, his voice more of a croak than anything. The nerves in his body seemed to stir to life once more, Tony’s climactic high slowly bringing him back down to earth. The brunette could feel the touch and tenderness of Steve’s hands around his thighs, could feel he blonde’s tongue cleaning up the mess the genius made of himself. Tony looked down to find Steve eyeing him before he slipped his beloved’s spent penis out of his mouth with an impressive
“Well, it takes a lot for me to get dressed up. It’s a rare sight,” Tony remarked nonchalantly. Though the compliment from the super solider made him blush. Tony blamed the alcohol for it. “How’s the apartment search going?”
“How is that fair?” Steve asked, trying to sound like a joke, but the neediness was clearly there. Tony smirked mischievously before laying on his back and pulling Steve on top of him. Tony looped his arms around the small of Steve’s back, leaning up to brush his nose against his love’s.
Now simply in his damp boxers, Tony drank in the sight of his gorgeous boyfriend, the man putting Adonis to shame with his round, perky pecs and defined abs. His thighs were strong and his arms sculpted, and seeing such a man prepping himself for Tony so that he could fuck him had the brunette floating.
“So cryptic,” Steve murmured against Tony’s mouth, sighing then as the brunette pulled back the lacey fronts of his boyfriend’s garment, exposing his firm and defined pectorals. It never failed for Steve to blush under his beloved’s intense gaze, knowing how Tony’s gorgeous doe eyes looked over every inch of bare skin, taking in the curve of the blonde’s pecs and the pebbled flesh of his petal pink nipples. Steve felt that Tony seemed to be able read his mind too, knowing how much Steve wished for the genius’s mouth and tongue to caress and move over his warm, heated skin. Without a word, the brunette slid a hand up Steve’s abdomen and traced the crease between the blonde’s pecs, caressing the taut skin there a bit with feathery fingertips before gliding that hand back down the super soldier’s abdomen.
“How’d your talk with Tony go?” Natasha asked, dicing up a tomato and adding it to the eggs before opening a package of shredded cheese.
“Wow,” Tony said, his chest filing with warmth and desire already. “You’re so beautiful, Stevie,” he complimented, taking in his fill. “I’ve got some great taste in lingerie, don’t you agree?” the genius giggled lightly.
Steve held onto the man as if his life depended on it, thinking how he never wanted be apart from Tony for a week
“When I was young, I had a hard time sleeping. Whether it was from an asthma attack or fever, I had many restless nights,” Steve said, watching the twinkling stars against the darkest of blue skies. It was like diamonds sprinkled upon black velvet.
“Yes, indeed. It’s okay?” The genius queried, his wet hand slipping between the blonde’s legs, up the cleft of his bum and to his stretched opening.
On a cool evening, Steve decided to catch up on some reading, a journal in hand so he could scrawl some notes down. He was sitting in his living room, reading about the political system of the Nautical Exploration Age. He read the book with great interest, writing down ideas and thoughts in his notebook. The super soldier was a few chapters in however, when two names came to his mind, two names that were not in the book at all. Steve needed to write the names down, and suddenly he found himself writing down a story involving those two gentlemen in Rococo France. Steve muttered the words as he wrote, almost reliving their history...as if he was being consumed by them.
Tony just laughed, itching the back of his head. “Well, I thought this would be a little sacrilegious…or something if we did this on Easter Sunday,” he admitted, petting Steve’s rump. He could feel the indentations from where his short fingernails had mercilessly dug into the flesh back there. Steve thought about what Tony had said before scrunching his nose up like a bunny.
Tony had been toying with Steve, tracing his tongue over the planes in his back, and nipping at the flesh of the super soldier’s soft inner thighs. But he didn’t seem to respond the way the brunette was hoping.
“Alright,” Tony said after a pause, seeing the drying come on Steve’s nightie and thighs. “Let’s get you and this place cleaned up, huh?”
Comments and Kudos are always appreciated. I would love to know what you all think about the story so far?
“There,” Tony said, bracketing Steve’s body with his hands as he loomed over him a bit possessively. “You’re so beautiful, you know that?” Tony remarked, pressing a kiss to Steve’s cheek. Steve held Tony securely around his back, beaming up at Tony.
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” Steve said innocently from the confines of his expensive sheets and comforter. “Do you like the last part of your present?” The blonde then asked, holding his bound wrists up and smiling sweetly at the brunette, who was walking closer to the bed all the while.
“Fiiiiine,” Tony sighed, and slowly they made it to Tony’s ornate bathroom, a large white porcelain tub beckoning them. Steve could feel himself practically waddling, his bum absolutely sore as Tony’s seed and the excessive amount of lube slid down the backs of his thighs. Yep, a bath was a must.
“I wouldn’t say that, darling,” Pepper said softly, eyes looking a bit distant. “There’s someone. And he’s been a part of your life much longer than I have.” Tony stumbled a bit in their dance when she said that.
“Look at me, Steve,” Tony said, his voice hinted with a commanding tone. And Steve did, pulling his eyes away from where they were joined to meet Tony’s gaze. “Don’t close your eyes.” With that, Tony pulsed his hips with an emphatic force, his seed spilling freely into Steve’s channel. Steve didn’t look away, the sensation of the man’s hot release and the beauty of Tony’s face when pure bliss washed over his face was all Steve needed to come as well. His body clenched painfully around Tony, his mouth open as he elicited an explicit moan before fusing his lips to the brunette’s, drinking in the genius’s own pleasurable cries.
"Shall I send this project to the interns of Stark Industries, Sir?" J.A.R.V.I.S asked Tony as he looked over the equations and schematics.
“I told you, Tony.” She sounded tired, her body void of energy. “I wanted to figure it out. Wanted to do all that I could to see what it was that I could do differently. But in the end…” The woman took a breath. “I just can’t do this anymore.” Tony looked down, emotion washing over him like a tide crashing against the sand.
Tony slowed his thrusts, his strokes filling Steve like a languid tide. He pushed Steve’s one hand aside so that he could be the one to jerk the man off, Tony’s other hand moving to the nipple Steve wasn’t toying with.
It all came to that final crescendo when he felt Steve constrict around him, the tightness and overwhelming friction blindsiding him entirely. Tony came with a raspy cry, biting into Steve’s shoulder as the waves of his orgasm crashed and whirled inside him.
Steve licked his bottom lip, eyes half lidded as he worked his fingers over a nipple then, lurching into his touch as he pinched and pulled at the rosy nub. Tony loved Steve’s chest, loved licking those hard nipples, biting the deep pink flesh with his teeth as Steve writhed beneath him. Watching Steve toy with them, and seeing how much he enjoyed it was almost as great as when Tony was there doing it himself. Almost.  “Wish this was you touching me,” Steve said breathily as he flicked his nipple quickly, the nub bouncing back into place with each passing stroke.
Tony did not touch Steve’s erection, nor pull down his lacey thong like Steve had anticipated; the brunette moved away entirely, and Steve could not help but to make a desperate whimper.
“My favorite stories Aunt Peggy told me were her missions with the Howling Commandos and Captain America, whom we have with us here tonight,” Sharon said with a smile, looking to Steve before people began clapping for him. The man of course blushed at the attention and gave a shy wave. Tony wondered how the man got through all those promotional videos and USO shows.
Tony quickly went to work wiping down Steve’s face, grazing the soft cloth over his forehead and under his eyes. He worked his way down Steve’s muscular frame, paying extra attention to Steve’s chest, rubbing at the man’s nipples with the cloth, feeling them perk up under his temperate touch. He could hear Steve let out a rushed breath, and Tony smirked at that. His precious boyfriend was always so responsive.
Steve felt his cheeks flush as Tony’s gaze drifted up and down his body. They obviously had seen each other half clothed before, when training and what not. But now there was desire and an invitation to look, to caress. There was self-doubt that began to creep its way into Steve’s thoughts, the black negativity slithering inside his mind and spreading. Tony had been so used to a woman’s body, but if he would end up changing his mind now? Seeing how Steve was built much differently.
Clicking the elevator, Tony was surprised that it didn’t open up for him right away. He waited a minute, opening up the crinkled file from Pepper that he had to fold up and stuff into a small compartment in his suit. He skimmed it, not absorbing any of the information. The elevator doors slid open finally, and Steve was standing on the other side.
“You shouldn’t feel ashamed of it, either. It’s normal, I believe, for partners to assume certain roles. Don’t you think?” Tony added, his voice sweet and unchallenging.
“Hey now, it was very well made,” Tony said defensively. “It was much better built than the squirt who made a Captain America snowman.
“And you’re such a tease,” Steve whispered, a light chuckle escaping his lips before he reached down between them and palmed at Tony’s own arousal. Tony, in reaction bit Steve’s nipple, not hard enough to break skin, but enough for Steve to enjoy the pleasure pain of it.
He was moaning? Tony hadn’t even realized those noises were his own. “Come on, Steve, play with yourself. Wanna see you touch all of those beautiful muscles of yours,” Tony challenged, smearing the precome around his swollen tip. He knew Steve loved when he did that during sex. He noticed a fine sheen of sweat beginning to glisten on Steve’s body as the man took his other hand and started to fondle his testicles, squeezing and pulling at the sac while stroking himself quickly. He watched Steve’s head fall back against the pillows that propped him up, his mouth parted, eyes shut as he just felt the sensations of his own hands.
“That ‘beefed-up golden boy’ is Captain America, Stark,” Fury remarked, voice stern. Tony didn’t say anything, wanting to get up and walk away. He was a busy man with more important things to deal with.
"Thank you for the mug, by the way," Tony added then, holding up the mug a little before taking a sip. "It meant a lot." Tony gave him a genuine smile, and Steve couldn’t help but to smile back, his eye lighting up, the happiness he felt indescribable.
“I do,” Steve whispered. “They just like to sell papers. I’m sorry, my love,” Steve breathed feeling beyond silly in that moment.
All those thoughts blew away though when Steve gazed dotingly at the brunette, hair in disarray, eyes closed. The blonde took in the way Tony’s dark lashes cast wispy shadows on his cheekbones. With a sigh of admiration, Steve brushed a few dark hairs from his beloved’s forehead, the genius opening his eyes then from the other man’s touch. Tony’s ruby lips quirked into a sleepy smile before nuzzling against Steve’s hand.
Once the film ended, it was a little after 11pm. Natasha had fallen asleep as the credits rolled; and though Steve asked if he could help her to her room, she kindly declined and curled up on the couch, fetal position. Covering her up with a blanket that was folded over the back of the couch, Steve headed toward his quarters to shower. He wasn’t sure how long Tony would be able to chat for, or if the man would be too tired. But Steve had an idea in mind. Something that would be new for them as a couple. And if he knew anything about Tony, Steve was pretty sure the man would like the idea.
Steve nodded, breathing heavy once again while he slipped the straps off his shoulders. Tony helped him along, sliding the fabric down Steve’s breathtaking body till it bunched around his hips.
“Just take the phone call, Tony,” Steve said faintly, his messy blonde head popping up to look at Tony between his legs. “Just to get it over with.” Tony saw the man’s point, but that meant if he talked to Fury his throbbing erection would have to wait longer, and that wasn’t fair. Then again, Tony was a fantastic multi-tasker.
“What the hell is that?” Clint asked, turning to start up the quinjet and head for Queens. Immediately, the rest of the team turned their heads towards Thor, expecting him to answer.
Tony looked at him quizzically and unmoving, but Steve merely pushed him back a bit. “What do you mean?” the genius asked confusedly. Though, Steve didn’t need to explain anything when Tony saw the blonde looking around their haven for where Tony had the lube. “Here,” Tony offered, reaching into a little bag he brought up earlier, pulling the bottle out and handing it to his beloved. Taking the bottle then, Steve gave him a thankful smile and piled up all the pillows before reclining amongst them gracefully.
“Oh, a break sounds fantastic,” Tony muttered against Steve’s mouth, wrapping his hands around Steve’s back to grab at his bum. “Mmmmm, a thong today?” Tony inquired then, pulling away just a fraction to catch Steve’s gaze. “You’re really spoiling me, aren’t you?” Steve just giggled sheepishly, nuzzling his cheek against Tony’s.
After the debriefing, the five Avengers headed back to the tower, Clint and Natasha heading to their quarters while Thor, though battered and bruised, went to the kitchen to eat the entire fridge.
It was then that Steve shifted away from Tony’s finger only to spread his bum cheeks with his hands and lined himself up with Tony’s cock, chocolate trickling down the length of it.
“I do not,” Steve resented. “I wanted us to do it together.” Steve wiped down his body with some wipes he kept in his nightstand.
“Oh my,” Steve said, his mouth falling open, his brows knit together. He looked down to see his cock bouncing with their motions, his length slapping against his belly, his precome sprinkling white on Tony’s toned torso.
He opened his mouth to ask Steve what he had been up to lately, if he had been working on any art projects only to immediately close it when he watched Steve strip out of his shirt. Ummm…that was unexpected. Not that he didn’t enjoy the view or anything.
It didn’t take long before Steve was in sync with the genius, rocking himself forward and then slamming back against Tony’s pulsing hips. He moaned loudly, not caring if Tony’s igloo shaped haven wasn’t sound proof. Each thrust into Steve from the genius filled him, yet the blonde desired more, wishing to drown in Tony’s touch and presence. The blonde heard Tony moan breathlessly behind him, the brunette’s fingers digging into his muscles as they ascended toward their crescendo.
Steve hurried along, though he really wanted to read every exhibit and study every object. Maybe he would come back another time and ask if he get a private tour somehow.
"I should have saved him, should have been there," Tony repeated over and over. He'd closed his eyes a moment, but when he opened them Tony was not in the hospital of a modern age.
Tony leaned on his elbow, his other arm sliding over Steve’s shoulder, his hand petting the man’s flaxen-hued hair.
“Yes,” Steve huffed out, arching his chest up for Tony to play with him there. Tony gave him a wink, reaching beneath Steve to grab his ass while then going to work on the pink perky nipple, savoring it. “O-oh,” Steve sighed, his eyes shutting as he felt Tony’s hands, tongue and lips caress him with skilled movements, knowing how to make Steve fall apart. Tony chuckled lightly, knowing exactly what he was doing while he kneaded his fingers into the plush flesh of Steve’s rump. Steve raised his stockinged legs up, bracketing Tony’s sides, wanting the man to keep on doing what he was doing, which was driving Steve wild.
“I will,” Steve offered, his hands slipping under the fabric of Tony’s underwear, his fingers digging into the meat of each cheek before helping the brunette wiggle out of them. He threw them to the floor with the rest of their garments. “Besides, I have been doing some research on it, and-”
One side of the genius’s lips curled up before handing the item to Steve. “You know what this is, love?”
“That was honestly a great event,” Steve commented, smiling lightly and slipping his hands into his dark navy wool coat.
“Can’t hear you, J,” Tony called as he buffed out the rust of the exhaust pipe. The A.I. repeated himself and Tony rolled his eyes, sliding himself on the roller seat from under the car. “I can’t understand you when you mumble like that,” Tony huffed, sitting up only to see Steve looking down at him.
Steve was a wreck above him, and for extra measure, the brunette gave Steve’s lovely rump a playful swat, leaving a faint hand print on the super soldier’s warm skin. Tony’s little spank was a surprise to Steve, and he gleefully groaned at the touch. It was harmless and barely made a sting.
“C’mere,” Tony mumbled, bringing Steve even closer to him. His other hand cupped the super soldier’s jaw, his thumb sliding over Steve’s plump bottom lip. “This part of sex may be new for us, but I think we know the gist of it,” Tony started. “But if anything is off to you, please tell me.”
Steve giggled, turning in Tony’s grasp and laying his hands on the brunette’s chest. “I guess so,” Steve replied, leaning in to kiss his boyfriend sweetly. He missed the softness of Tony’s mouth on his, the man’s scruff brushing against his jaw.
“Ah, come on, Tony,” Steve teased, lifting his hips so Tony could undo the clasps on the back of his thighs. “You’re a genius. Can’t manage to take off lingerie?” Tony just looked at him with a quirked brow, unlatching the final clasp, pulling the garter belt away and dropping it to the floor.
“Okay!” Steve called, sliding under the car while Tony lifted the hood to reveal the engine. The genius too began his work, removing the wires from the ends of the spark plugs, only to grab his socket wrench to loosen them. Tony thought about Steve loving someone else once more. Well, at least he didn’t ask Steve out like Rhodey originally mentioned. Because then, he more than likely wouldn’t be sharing this moment with Steve. The blonde would have shot him down faster than a speeding bullet, only to then avoid Tony like the plague, and this wonderful friendship they had established would be all for naught. Tony couldn’t deny it left him sour, knowing he couldn’t have Steve the way he wished to, but at least he had him as a great friend.
No. Steve needed to stop himself there. He could already feel his body responding to his overly vivid imagination.
Begrudgingly, Steve took the stairs to the floor and room that was indicated on Tony’s instructions. Jiggling the key into the lock of the specified door, Steve slowly opened it and walked inside the room. He turned on the light switch to reveal a luxury suit apartment. Closing the door, Steve merely stood there for a few minutes, taking in all the fine details of the space. Quite frankly, Steve thought it was breathtaking.
Tony’s eyes were locked onto the sight of Steve cleaning him up with his pretty pink tongue. “So perfect, Steve,” Tony murmured, lifting a hand to comb it through Steve’s damp blonde hair. “Just like that.” He could feel Steve shudder when Tony guided his head over a new spot of wet release on his chest. Tony had been storing these little quirks about Steve in his mind for a while now, the way the super soldier tended to fall into a pattern of obedience during their play time. It was definitely a conversation they needed to have later.
“Oh, shit,” Steve heard Tony moan as he felt the man’s penis jerk against his mouth. The blonde sucked at the mushroom shaped head of his love’s length, his saliva, along with Tony’s precome leaving a damp spot on the undergarment. Steve could taste a slight salty flavor from Tony’s wetness, something the blonde always found rather enticing. In a quick movement, Steve slid the brunette’s boxers down just enough to free up his erection before he wrapped his pink lips around the hard shaft of his lover.
“To-hohohoo-nyy,” Steve giggled, pulling his foot away. Tony, with a smirk on his face, reached up and took hold of the waistline of Steve’s thong then, dragging the fabric down and over Steve’s thick swelling erection, then down his legs, careful not to pull a thigh high stocking down with it.
“Tony,” Steve said, trailing heated kisses down the genius’s jawline and to his ear. “Would you take me?” he asked, his breath warm against Tony’s earlobe. “Want to feel you deep inside me,” he whispered, thumbing at the waistline of his boyfriend’s boxers. Steve leaned back to capture Tony’s gaze then. “Only if you are okay with it,” he added, not wanting Tony to feel obligated on Steve’s part. “I know it’s a new thing for both of us if you don’t want to. And I can always test my own blow job skills on you,” he said with a small chuckle.
He’d managed to work a half of a finger into himself, the tight drag sparking liquid heat through Tony’s body as he pinched the base of his cock, not wanting to unload before Steve. The genius watched Steve pluck at his nipples while thrusting his fingers deeply into his ass, each time brushing against his prostate. God, seeing Steve ride his own fingers was fucking heaven. He wished he could have watched Steve all night long. But Tony honestly couldn’t hold back any longer.
For a split-second Steve turned to go inside the exhibit before catching himself. He’d been there many times, watching the same reels of old footage, with him and Bucky smiling together, or Peggy telling the stories of the Howling Commandoes. In the modern world, Steve found solace and ease in that space of the museum. it was nostalgic, something he knew. Something that made him feel less alone. Steve hesitated, tempted to revisit it and ground himself again. but Steve kept walking, reassuring himself that his life in the present was equally as important as the on some seventy years ago.
Pepper’s words swirled around his slightly cloudy brain as he sat on the couch in his penthouse, the moonlight trickling into the room in slanted rays. Tony just shook his head, sipping at his scotch. Pepper didn’t know what she was talking about.
“Tony,” Steve finally said, stilling his lover’s hands with his own, his expression speaking volumes.
“Do you know if Tony is still in his lab?” Steve asked. If that was the case, the blonde would not have been happy about that; Tony never got proper sleep.
Getting a garter belt on was much more tedious than he thought. Steve was in his bedroom, wriggling on his bed, attempting to get on a ruffled, black satin garter belt with metal clips, furnished with tiny grey bows.  It wouldn’t have been so bad if he’d gotten one with an elastic waistband. But he loved the feel of ones created with the authenticity of the early days.
“Oh I could think of a few things,” Steve winked, taking a sip of the brew before handing it to Tony. “But later, after breakfast” he added before walking toward the living area. Tony watched the man go, eyes fixed on Steve’s gorgeous ass, appreciating how his sweatpants hugged it perfectly. He was also pretty sure the blonde swayed his hips more than normal, causing Tony to let out a soft groan.
“Hmm, yeah I would have to say so,” Steve replied, eyeing the man once more.  “Though, why did we exchange baskets the day before the actual holiday?”
Reaching his own hand down, Steve palmed and teased the growing bulge in Tony’s jeans, the brunette groaning as he rocked into Steve’s touch, wanting more. Steve indulged him a little while longer, watching the brunette’s expression twist with pleasure. God, Tony was gorgeous, his eyes closed, his dark lashes thick as his mouth parted in ecstasy, breathing heavy.
Later that night Tony finally fixed the problem with the algorithm for the arc reactor energy project. But as Tony set to work switching Stark Tower over to clean energy, everything that would make up the future chapters of his life would shift. And the next thing he knew, he was heading off to Germany to square off with some alien god who had an ego even greater than Tony's.
Finding himself once again, Tony grabbed ahold of Steve’s hips, pinning him firmly on him as Tony took the time to plunge into a desired, heated kiss with his love. The genius’s hands slipped back to Steve’s bum, grabbing at the thick flesh there, leaving the blonde to moan against him.
Steve was wrecked, his body sore to the point that he was close to tears. He wanted his lover to have this though, where Steve was there for his pleasure. He kneaded his lower lip with his teeth to evade the hiss of pain that wanted to escape him. And regardless of the ache in his stretched hole and inner walls, Steve of course managed to get hard again. But how Tony was now, gorgeous and desperate over him, his body warm, muscles sinewy, Steve really couldn’t resist the arousal his boyfriend easily got him in.
With one last kiss, Tony nosed his way down Steve’s body until he kneeled off the bed, grabbing Steve’s legs and pulling him to the edge of the bed. There was a part of him that couldn’t believe this was actually happening. But when the blonde sat up, only to see Tony kneeling on the floor looking up at him with a devilish smile, it all brought Steve back to the present.
The brunette reveled in this moment, giving pleasure to the man he would spend the rest of his life with. He nuzzled his cheek against Steve’s bum, brushing his facial hair along that lovely skin of his future husband.
Steve's one hand slid up Tony's chest, gently pulling at the fabric of his shirt before he deepened the kiss, not wanting them to part. Steve never thought he would know the true happiness of having a soulmate, especially when he thought Peggy was his true soulmate. But the way he felt with Tony, the way Tony felt with Steve, it superseded everything Steve had figured it would be with Peggy. He loved Peggy, truly. But it was Tony whom his heart, mind and body belonged to.
The blonde was near the end of his readings when he came across an article about new research in soulmate bonds. Steve hummed slightly in surprise. Soulmate bonds were not overly common in his generation, though his mother told him the she and Steve’s father were soulmates, and that most generations before her had soulmate bonds. Soulmates, his mother said were defined by an invisible emotional energy that tied two people together. Every night, when she would tuck a young, frail Steve into bed, his beautiful mother would tell him the tale of ancient men and women who were soulmates, their love and bond so strong that they could conquer every challenge before them, even death. Steve, sickly and weak would listen, his eyes big as his mother enthralled his imagination with magnificent visions of stoic heroes, fighting for peace and falling in love.
“How bad is it, Doc?” Tony asked with an easy smile as Bruce laughed lightly, securing the cotton tourniquet with a pin.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony bit out, cradling Steve’s face with his hands. “I was too enraptured with watching you come and then cleaning me up to worry about it,” Tony said in pure honesty. But now, when Steve touched him there and they were talking about it, the aching heat and sensitivity of his length was unavoidable. “Lay on your back for me,” Tony said, his tone sweet yet laced with assertiveness.
Steve stayed out there for a little while longer, the anxiety of his nightmare finally dissipated. Tony being out there had helped him, the man’s presence alone always calming. Yeah, Tony was constantly on the go, being pulled every which way with business matters as well as the scrutiny of the public eye. But when he was with Steve, he was always fully attentive, completely focused on him. It was sometimes intimidating for Steve, having 100 percent of Tony’s attention. But it didn’t surprise him either. Tony always did things with all that he had.
“Oh my,” Steve whispered, shifting his legs just a bit as he angled his neck to get a better view. He stopped his adjusting when he heard a small tear above him. He’d put too much strain on the binding on his wrists. But he was rather curious to know what his body looked like, stretched open by the sex toy.
“God I’ve just missed you so damn much, my love,” Steve breathed, his chest heaving as he gazed upon his boyfriend. The super soldier trailed his hands over Tony’s arc reactor and to his chest, thumbing at the man’s ruddy nipples as he spoke.
“I need to shower and get some things together before I fly out to California,” Pepper said, her voice soft. “Look over those files.” She walked away from him then, toward what Tony assumed was her bedroom. “You know your way out,” she called over her shoulder, disappearing down the hall.
Steve was absolutely ruined by the way Tony fucked him, his boyfriend knowing just how to leave him reeling. He held onto Tony’s hand that was toying with one of Steve’s hard, pink nipples, keeping it there as Steve’s other hand reached back to latch into the brunette’s thick hair.
The mission went bad, and everything seemed to be a blur. Tony the entire time stayed close to Steve; an unexpected need to protect him had overcome his senses.
Slowly though, it was all those things Steve originally saw as faults in the man’s character that caused him to slowly fall in love with Tony. Those were the quirks that made Tony who he was. And as time went on, as both men got to know each other, Steve realized how balanced they were together on and off the battle field. They had eventually become friends, the blonde often being invited down to the brunette’s lab to just hang out. Steve was more than happy to accept, sometimes bringing a sketch pad and pencil with him so that he could work on a drawing while Tony was busy with new tech or configuring new calculations. Steve would ask a question or two about what Tony was doing or Tony would ask him what he was drawing, but most of the time they were both quiet. It was never uncomfortable of course, both men were content with the silence, the presence of each other creating a peaceful space.
It was then, when Tony sucked at the wet pink rim before abruptly plunging a finger into Steve’s entrance that the blonde came, spilling his seed into his hand as he pumped himself dry, his other hand twisting into the sheets so hard that they tore. He fell in against the mattress, not caring about the wet sticky mess that would coat his belly. Nothing mattered in that moment besides the bliss that swam through his veins.
“Steve, my love, you and your innocent façade will be the end of me,” Tony commented, his voice a bit strangled. Steve couldn’t help but snicker, appreciating how hot and bothered he could get his boyfriend.
Tony had drove them to a quaint Bed and Breakfast a few miles south from where they were fishing. “I had J.A.R.V.I.S reserve two rooms for us,” Tony said, pulling onto the dirt road that led to the farmhouse style home.
“Goddammit, Pepper,” Tony bit out, draining his coffee cup, facing her then. “I don’t have feelings for the guy. Can’t you just let it fucking go?” Tony said, his voice strained as he forced himself not to yell.
“So sensitive, aren’t we?” Tony jested, biting his lip as he met Steve’s gaze devilishly. Steve only wiggled in response. So, Tony gave the man a little mercy and pulled his frilly panties down, springing the blonde’s penis free from its lacy restrains.
But Peggy lived on after the ice, was married and had a family. Steve was happy for her, though his heart ached at imagining what could have been for them. Soulmates happen once in a lifetime. Soulmates were two halves of a whole, completing each other, and bringing out the best in one another...Steve had his chance with Peggy. They could have had that beautiful life after the war. But Steve sacrificed that life, and though he didn’t regret the decision to crash Red Skull’s plane, Steve still wondered if he would have finally understood pure bliss with Peggy.
“I did, though what do we plan on using it for? Is it a new lube?” Steve was honestly curious. Tony stopped licking at Steve’s neck and pulled his hands away, resting them on the man’s narrow hips. Tony reached for the glass bottle, holding it up for Steve to see. He tipped it so his boyfriend could see the contents move slowly inside.
Even though he had the romantic feelings for Steve for a while, Tony had never become hard from them. This was not a good sign; he was falling even deeper when he knew he needed to be climbing up. Tony’s inner dialogue was extremely loud, and he felt panic rush into his chest. “You know, Cap, I just remembered I’ve got this thing down in…a meeting in like five minutes. Yeah, I’ll see you later okay?” Tony said, jumbling some form of a sentence together as he headed for the elevator, turning his body away so Steve couldn’t see his blatantly obvious problem.
“I love you,” Steve murmured, eyes big and blue and full of meaning. Those three words hit Tony like a wave crashing upon the sand, his chest filling with butterflies. He smiled widely at Steve.
Shutting the door then, Tony slipped off his shoes and tiptoed over to the bed, sliding into it, rumpled clothing and all. He slipped his arms around Steve’s, moving his hands underneath that pillow Steve held to rest them on his boyfriend’s toned stomach. Tony’s hands danced on the silky fabric of Steve’s nightie, absolutely elated that the blonde was wearing that garment Tony got him before he had left.
All of Tony’s sounds and features as he witnessed joy and satisfaction caused Steve to climax as well. His seed spilled from his swelled, reddened length, the relief of coming washing over him. The blonde was too captivated by Tony’s expression to care about that though, as his love’s mouth formed in a perfect ‘o’, his moans almost silent at the reprieve he felt from that disentanglement of need and desire.
“You can’t just decide to get eaten by a giant monster,” Tony started their spat up once again, turning his attention back to Steve.
“We’ll take care of it,” Obadiah cut him off. “Now go get yourself cleaned up.” The older man stormed away, and the brunette inventor was ushered down to the lower level. Before his vision of the deck was skewed though, Tony turned, looked over his shoulder and thought he saw Obadiah remove his revolver from its holster around his hips as he strode toward the merman.
The movie was long forgotten at this point, and when Tony said, “mute,” the sound vanished, leaving nothing but the men’s sultry sighs. Tony pulled away and asked Steve if this was still alright. Steve answered him by grabbing a handful of the brunette’s shirt and pulling him back for another breathless kiss.
A few moons ago, Steve had lost his best friend, James, though everyone but Natasha called him “Bucky.” Steve and Bucky were inseparable since they were merbabies, raised together in the same pod all their lives. Natasha empathized with Steve’s heartache entirely, for she and Bucky were life mates, bound together for years, their memories full of love.
Steve shook his head, smiling softly as he picked up the garment then, placing each leg in the bifurcated fabric and slipping it up over himself. Of course, it fit perfectly, the lace straps nestling over his shoulders, his pecs smoothing out the fine silk and chiffon over his chest. Steve could see the outline of his loins under the light weight fabric. He loved how the silk was cool against his warm skin, the difference creating gooseflesh all over his body. Steve went to the bathroom to check how his backside looked. The teddy was backless, exposing all the dips in the super soldier’s muscular back and shoulders. The fabric at the synched in waistline fell over his plush bum, the bottom of each cheek playing peek-a-boo when he moved. Steve fingered the lace there at the bottom of the shorts, tracing the angled hem on his upper thigh.
“Oh yeah sorry. Didn’t want to come,” Tony replied, standing up, only to lay in against Steve, kissing him softly. Steve was blushing down his neck and Tony knew the man was afraid that Fury would figure out what was going on.
So, after he made himself breakfast, Steve did his normal routine of research and paperwork for the Avengers, getting any legalities in order with Maria and what not. As he headed up from the main floor of Avengers Tower, needing a few papers sent out to Fury, Steve wondered where Tony had been all day. Even on days the genius worked in his lab, he would at least pop up to grab a snack or to clear his head by taking to the sky in his Iron Man suit.
And then, as the pain of his injury worsened, and his strength began to fade, and the seamen closed in, a masculine voice called out amongst the chaotic shouting around him. Steve was afraid, but the presence of that dark-haired man, with large eyes that showed genuine concern seemed to ease the utter fear that twisted in his chest.
"Mabe so," Steve responded. "Soulmates were always something of legend to the mass population. And now, science is saying its highly probable. Who would have thought," Steve tossed the small towel over his shoulder then, hiding his mark. He didn’t want Tony to ask about that as well.
“Before we get to that,” Tony said, laughing lightly and wiggling his hips, his tumescent cock noticeable under his slim fit trousers. “I want to try something out. Nothing over the top or different. But I think it’ll be quite pleasant for both of us,” the genius added, giving a slight shrug as Steve crawled back up to be face to face with the brunette.
“It wasn’t your fault, Pep. I-I just wish I could do something to make you stay. To prove to you how much I love and care about you,” Tony said, his own eyes pleading. He wrapped an arm around her small waist, just needing to have her close, as if that would keep her with him, making her stay.
Pepper just giggled and rolled her eyes at him. “Loving someone isn’t only about sex,” she said, basically reading his mind and smacking him lightly on the chest playfully. “It’s about the heart connection, emotional bonding.”
“I think we could figure something out,” Steve said, cheeks blushing while he leaned in for one more heated kiss.
After the formalities of shaking hands and giving cheek kisses, Tony excused himself from Rhodey, who was speaking with a military official and headed toward the bar. He really didn’t want to be here. If it weren’t for Rhodey, he’d be back in his penthouse. It was probably good that he was out of the tower, getting some fresh air and seeing other people besides his teammates. Especially Steve.
“Thank you, for doing what you did earlier, Tony,” Steve said, shifting slightly on the table. “You saved my life.” Steve believed that from the bottom of his very being, that if Tony had not intervened when he did, Steve would have been wounded even further or killed.
“So, did you like your Valentine’s Day surprise then?” Steve asked tiredly, eyes gently closed as he kissed Tony’s collarbone. The brunette could only laugh.
“It can be overwhelming.” Steve heard a soothing voice say, and he turned his head to see Tony walk up next to him. “Though Thor was always one to go for the gusto, when it comes to parties.”
“Oh, not too many things, I guess,” he heard Steve say, his voice muffled. “There was a car garage not too far from where I lived in Brooklyn. I’d go there once and a while after school to sketch the cars. All the workers knew me, everyone knew everybody back then,” Steve explained, and Tony could hear the nostalgia in Steve’s voice, the longing of his old life pushing through. “Some of the mechanics would show me basic things. And then Howard taught me about motorcycles, and he showed me how to fix mine up,” Steve added, and Tony’s pleasant moment of sharing ended like a needle getting dragged across a vinyl record.
Steve knew he was going to have to speak with Tony also, and hear what the brunette had to say about everything. He just didn’t feel like dealing with it tonight.
Steve came hard, ropes of white shooting out, only to hit the mirror in front of him. Tony continued to pump his fingers inside him, but with less fervor than before. His fingers were gentle then, caressing Steve’s loose hole, allowing the muscle to clench around them delicately as the waves of Steve’s orgasm calmed. He laid against the man for a few minutes, feeling the cool metal casing of the arc reactor pressed against his skin.
The genius obeyed, finding a new angle to thrust into Steve, the super soldier’s tight heat slithering a coil of warmth in his nether regions. Steve locked his feet around the brunette’s lower back while Tony pinned his boyfriend’s hands in his own. The air flow and ventilation would certainly need reworked, Tony briefly thought as the window panels of the private structure fogged around them. He rocked into Steve differently than before, hitting the blonde’s bundle of nerves, the man crying out, his eyebrows knitting together.
“Really?” Steve said, his voice sounding more elated then he meant to. Though, he didn’t really have to hide anything from Natasha anyways.
“I only speak the truth, beloved.” Tony smiled dotingly down at the man beneath him, taking a moment of pause to just appreciate each other’s presence. Leaning forward, Tony took a deep breath, stretching his body over Steve’s to lay a kiss on his lips and chin before he explored downward, focusing on one of the super soldier’s nipples, taking the rosy bud in his mouth eagerly. The breathy gasps and moans that rolled off Steve’s tongue made Tony desperate to touch himself. He couldn’t, not yet anyway. So, he continued on, flicking his tongue over that reddening peak on Steve’s chest, biting and sucking at it while his fingers found the other nipple once more. Never wavering, Tony rolled that pert flesh between his fingertips, feeling Steve lurch underneath him at the extra touch.
Tony was obviously upset when he saw how adamant Steve was about finding another place. Yeah, he wouldn’t be there all the time, but Tony couldn’t deny he was sad that Steve didn’t find the tower to be worthy of being his home. He knew that even if Steve was gone part of the time, Tony’s feelings for him would not ebb, if anything they would probably heighten. ‘Absence makes the heart grow fonder’ and the whole bit.
