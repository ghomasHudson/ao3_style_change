when the thought of Dean inevitably wriggles in. He loves him consciously now, with none of the evasiveness from the beginning, with more control and purpose, and less of that desperate hunger of the early days of their acquaintance. Mooning around the world, drifting, getting closer, always ending at each other's side and staying there long after the end. Hesitantly, tentatively, yielding. Sometimes he dreams of confessing it all just to lift a weight from off his shoulders.
He would have let Castiel go if his friend wanted him to, it would have been the right thing to do and there would have been no blame. Castiel's strange and archaic words had followed him, filled his mind, echoed again and again like a curse. They had gone outside, the acrid smell of sex slowly dissipating, and had gone to have breakfast: Dean had prepared coffee and Jack’s cereal bowl as Castiel went to wake Jack up. His hand had reached for Castiel’s and they had lingered on the doorstep, the dangerous experimentation had long turned into love and the same urgency to be together had momentarily stopped them from resuming everyday life. Two simple sentences, if somehow belated in their articulation
“Me too. That is, I love you,” replies Dean with more emphasis, matter-of-factly, articulating words as if he was the one who spoke them first. He feels Dean’s hand on his naked shoulder and slowly puts his hand on it, not daring to move.
Imposing and industrial, towering itself against the black sky. Lighting explodes and the outline of the building is revealed in all its greatness, dark against sudden white light. It’s a safe place or the next best thing, the result of years and years of work - part of him always found it impressive, almost like home were it not that after years there he still feels like he doesn’t really belong. Carefully, watching his steps, he goes down a couple of stairs to the entrance, the familiar black door surrounded by concrete and red bricks.
And the beginning of it all too, grabbing Dean and dragging him away just as something went off beside them: the loud explosion and the air leaving his lungs, surrounded by bits of... and later, weeks on, the understanding that perhaps being saved had never been one of Dean's priorities. That late-night confession, darkness hiding their secrets and their own vulnerability, the flat tone and the admission to Castiel or to Dean himself of having been so fucking close. That night, in the freezing cold, in one of the dreadful huts, the whole world shaking, muddy boots and scratching their skin to wash out the blood, irritating it further, opening wounds caused by the freezing air and the frigid winter temperatures, the unsparing cold of January.
s and the celery leaves brushing against his skin. He was walking with purpose, expectedly and longingly closing the distance. He was walking towards a future, a reality rather than a mere sickly potentiality: a clear one, one that had been carefully planned; happy too or as happy as humanly possible for he was well aware now that there was hardly a formula for happiness, that it came and went quickly and questions about its advent and source were unanswerable most of the time, and that conditionals were bound to be present and inevitably so.
“His room, playing with Marvellous Marvin. Apparently, they’re having a tea party. Sam and Eileen will be here in ten minutes-ish with dinner. Chinese. Jack’s choice.”
Trying to drive back would be a nuisance: a perfectly logical explanation for Castiel's desire not to leave, for this evening not to come to an end, for the last moments to stretch themselves towards infinity and beyond, company lasting for the rest of his life.
Dean grabs the poker by the fireside and moves the wood around, paying attention not to extinguish the fire. For a moment it feels as if it won't work, but then, suddenly, the flames start to crackle and blaze again, growing in size and flooding the room with golden light.
"A friend to last my whole life. It gets... lonely." He pauses. "There's Jack, but it used to- Never mind."
Castiel nodded. Dean stretched out his hands, taking Castiel’s. Their fingers brushed against the other's, their skin warm. Curling at the contact, a soft, light and precious touch. A simple welcomed gesture that could just as easily remain unnoticed; And yet, in its privacy, was simple and joyful - a gentle reminder that they were both there: safe, alive, together.
“May I?” asks Dean who, without really waiting for an answer, sits in the free space behind the tub, resting his back against the tiled wall and crossing his legs. Gently, he lifts his hands, starting to wash Castiel’s hair, fingers massaging the scalp. “Wait.”
The present was where it was at, always had been. Castiel told him everything about his days, distracting them both with the carefully chosen words that were calmly and neatly articulated, rolling off Castiel’s tongue with ease as they painted an almost idyllic picture of everyday life, evoking feelings and mental images alike, distancing them as much as it bound them, hiding the existence of all those subjects they were painfully trying to avoid - loss, fear, resentment, the sheer idiocy of some reasoning. They had spent a long time talking around their feelings, going in circles and never being quite able to skip the inanities and reach for the larger thought. Superfluous to even mention it, an exactitude and obviousness. So what had there been in the immediate aftermath? Conversations and plenty of them. Dean would listen carefully, glad for the ongoing flow of words and dreading cold and terse sentences as much as any indication that would somehow predict yet another parting. There had been a certain finality in it all, unspoken promises of a life together neatly tucked in between the jokes. And there had been plenty of jokes about anything, levity making up for the strange gravity, compensating. One afternoon, Dean had told Castiel that he was one of the only people he knew who could talk in purple prose and Castiel had fixed his glasses, laughed, and quoted Horace - the sheer hilarity of the moment an impediment to going further than life fourteen and the
"It took me a long time. Please, stop with me," says Dean, astonishingly bursting in. "Sleep the night with me, Cas."
The bunker, all of it, despite having been part of their lives for years, now appeared strange and foreign, part of a life that no longer belonged to him and that he didn’t recognize as such. For years, it had been a replacement for the cheap motel rooms, themselves mere replacements for a family home, and it was now being replaced too by a three-room flat - freshly painted and furnished, ready to be moved in. Such a flat, located in the outskirts of the city, in an area that was less congested and greener, was distant enough to be forced to rely on public transport or a car for the daily commute. Not only that, it was far away enough for it to be distinct, a whole new life. A house, nay, a home as small and cramped as it would inevitably turn out to be. Realistically, it wasn’t: Dean’s whole life was proof enough that the crap one carried hardly ever disappeared when moving from one place to the next - new beginnings dragging on the pre-existing rottenness. Either way, such a place now empty and waiting for its new inhabitants - curtains drawn, surfaces clean, dusty protective films removed from the floor, all cleaned up and tidied - was enough to highlight the bunker’s imperfections: no sunlight, for starters; no privacy; and most definitely not a place where to safely raise a child.
Rain and silence and none of the familiar landmarks illuminated by the lampposts at both sides of the roads. He simply travels the distance out of instinct - straight on and then left, left, right. Sooner or later he’ll reach his destination and then the hardest part will come later on, soon after, the one that will inevitably leave him out of his depths. Truth is simple, a series of facts pronounced matter-of-factly with feeling and conviction, with trembling voice and heartbreak. It’s partly objective, based on observation and recognition - looking even as the other has their head turned around, looking away. It’s up close and personal, verging on irrelevance. Apologies are different, slippery, difficult when a mere shift of stress can transform entire sentences into a question or an accusation. They have to be acknowledged and accepted, selfishness has to be taken into consideration, and may widen the distance more than they close it.
want, Cas? If you could have anything in the world, what would you want?" asks Dean as he pours two glasses of whiskey.
Darkness, it seems, is the universe. Like the Empty, cold and unforgiving, cruel. He doesn’t remember much of his time there, though he remembers the agony in the sorry weeks and months, the regret of having spoken about his feelings at such an inappropriate time, of not having left enough space for an answer, an admission, mutual happiness and ephemeral bliss ready to slip through his fingers, out of reach, still enough to keep him company, warm, safe inside his head by clinging onto it and leave no space for doubts. But standing there, with his heart beating hard in his chest, tears in his eyes, and realization settling in the room, Death pounding the door, each knock echoing through the air, it seemed like the only possible option. A selfless sacrifice in the name of love, a direct continuation of his usual wish and the readiness to die for it like a hind waiting to be mated by a lion. The memories come quickly, neatly, in all their details and so come the tears, prickling in his eyes and rolling down his cheeks, mingling with rain.
“Lots of poo and vomit. Jack found it hilarious.” Dean pauses. “He missed you. Kept asking about you. This way.”
Dean stretches out his hand ever so slightly, their fingers brushing against each other, curling, as they continue to look at each other. His heart soars. History in the making. Feast your eyes. Castiel feels dizzy, his heart pounding in his chest, any of the sounds and doubts that may have usually grounded him ignored.
“When you died and came back… Since we’re being open and honest with each other… When you came back I said we needed you. But I needed you. I was hardly functioning. You were
Shadows dancing, Castiel looks at the spectacle of colours a little while longer. He's about to get up when Dean places his hand on his shoulder, resting it there. It's different, something about it feels different - lingering, calculated, done on purpose, anything but a mistake. Castiel tries to think of something else, tries to ignore it, but Dean's touch is gentle and grounding, all he wants to do is lean into it. Not the first nor the last time for it to happen, but he's been rather clear-headed as of late and the smallest of things turns into something exaggeratedly big.
“Hold me,” Cas whispers. His voice falters as he breathes in slowly and comes out as a muffled sound against Dean’s skin. “And never let me go.”
The answer is easily guessed: a holiday from himself; from all the anger; from conditioning and resentment; from the ghost of his father - that angry and vengeful man still haunting his life. The words are on the tip of his tongue, he wants to speak them followed by words of reassurance and praise, perhaps, because he knows Dean and knows how Dean sees himself, but it feels wrong to speak sentences that aren't his to voice.
He walks in quietly, tiptoeing on the pavement and smiles as fondness washes over him. Gently, he presses a kiss on Jack’s hair and fixes the blankets.
Daringly, he kisses Dean again, running the tip of his tongue over his lips and the kiss deepens - tenderly, languidly, gently. Kissing as the French do. Wantonly. Wet and slippery muscle against wet and slippery muscle.
It's a dark and stormy night, but the world seems softer and more welcoming. Even the rain feels more like a harbinger of renewal rather than one of death and destruction. It is April, not so much with its sweet showers that filter through the ground and wet the burgeoning flowers and leaves, but with something more violent and primordial - nature in all its power, all motion and dynamicity. It’s torrential rain that started in the early afternoon as nothing but a drizzle, as announced by the weather forecast for days. Cold and harsh, with thunder rolling and rambling, getting louder and louder and coming closer - the whole world trembling. Howling wind that breaks the silence, blowing through the streets and making the window blinds clatter and all the branches rattle and rustle, move as the sooty buds appear more vulnerable and fragile. Alive and threatening, unsparing with its never-ending movement and noise of nature at its best. Frightening and Romantic, awe-inspiring and sublime, capable of inspiring greatness as well as belittlement - mocking people, putting them back in their place: immense power and such small and weak animals.
“Your hair is full of mud, it’s easier to get it out like this.” He pauses and for a moment they remain there in silence as Castiel plays with the water, leaning his palm on the flat surface before tapping his fingers on it, studying the concentric circles as they expand themselves until they disappear, fading away silently.
Dean doesn’t finish his sentence, he merely steps forward, slowly, stretching out his hands and cupping Cas’s cheeks, thumbs caressing his skin. Then, suddenly, with a hint of ludicrousness, he places lips on Cas’s gently, softly, with yearning. Hesitantly, once the feeling of surprise begins to vanish, Castiel runs the tip of his tongue against Dean’s lips, parting them, a silent question and a silent answer. They could stop, one sound or gesture and he’d step back, any sign of discomfort and he’ll step back and they’ll never mention it again. Repress the memory, burn it down. It’s a kiss without a kiss that becomes tentative and languid as familiar feelings settle inside of him, thoughts going staccato. Tongues touching, moist and slippery muscle, hands in hair and bodies close.
He lingers, uncertain of what to do and filled with indecisiveness. His heart pounds in his chest and cold water runs down his back, if anything there will be Jack and a hot shower, a clean and dry set of clothes. If things go well, if there is some benevolent force in this chaotic universe, there will be Dean too and they’ll be friends, mature enough to ignore what passed between them, mature enough to move on.
There is talk of snow too. People have spent the last couple of days trying to agree on whether it will be there in the morning or before the end of the week. Either way, such a prediction is an exactitude, the air already smells of frost and snow, but for now, the only thing that is whispering against the window panes is the drizzle of rain - droplets of water, barely visible, running down the glass panels, landing on the windowsill beneath them. It’s easy to imagine their continuing journey towards the ground: on the edge, falling down onto the grass and pavement, adding up to the puddles on the grass.
was expecting you. And Jack too.” He sniffles. “Bold to assume this place ain’t warded for these things. You look terrible, Cas.”
“Here I thought that the mud made me look irresistible,” Cas jokes. “Look at you, I’ve ruined your t-shirt.”
“Used to be. Used to wonder how you could be so selfish, mulling over your words only to find them stupid. You couldn’t possibly believe them. And you left. You left and I couldn’t… I couldn’t stop you, Cas, alright? Couldn’t do anything about it. Couldn’t consider you dust and ashes. Wish we’d done it sooner. What I did, earlier, it wasn’t-”
Down the corridor and right, headed to the bathroom. Once they enter, Dean closes the door behind them and says, “Here we are. I doubt anyone’s awake at this ungodly hour, but if you’d rather lock the door, I can knock when I’m back.”
He does as he’s being told. His shoes are definitely dirtier than theirs and he places them next to a pair of rain boots with a bee pattern printed on them. Standing next to each other, they look like a complete picture - three pairs of shoes next to the door. It starts now, he thinks, with three pairs of shoes next to a door and a kiss: They can resume and simply be. History restarting at once with an ending mixed with a beginning.
"I should go," says Cas, breathless, his voice panic-stricken, abruptly stepping away as the full realization of his actions settles. "I'm sorry, Dean, I didn't mean to... I like you, Dean, you're decent and this is rotten- I mean, not really, it is my life, not rotten business, but-"
It seems to be the most natural conclusion and he's happy about it, at peace with his destiny and his decision not to do anything to stop it. All of his friends are humans, fragile and mortal, and he'd rather not spend the rest of his days travelling the world alone. One life, the best of life, seems enough and to make the most of it seems something noble. Fulfilment and contentment. He doesn't mind not seeing the rise and fall of empires or new dawns as long as he'll get to go to sleep every night knowing to have done something worthy of his time and helping others, something enjoyable for himself.
Even now, looking back, this life wasn’t something that had come easily. A life with Castiel and Jack, not a bad one at all, even less so contrary to everyone’s expectations including their own. There had been plenty of frustration as they realized that they were letting themselves down and everyone else too, as if the whole world had been their witness and recorded every hint of failure and success, keeping score. He felt watched by the ghost of his former self, judged and mocked as if he should have figured it out a long time ago instead of complicating it further: nothing was stopping him, the past was buried, it had been like pointing a revolver to the head of every single thing that haunted him. Bang. Bang.
It happened slowly, throughout the span of thirteen years, and now that he’s finally at the end of the road, the prospect of gaining his humanity assumes nightmarish qualities: the last time he was human, it was all but enjoyable. He’s not too sure about what he is scared of, perhaps the worst thing of all is that if needed he won’t be able to make any difference, having to rely on nothing which in return makes him less than useful. Perhaps he's scared about having an aching body and tired bones, about the idea of losing some of his memories or no longer having the right words to express himself. There is always a price to pay and he's not ready to do so,  and would like to know what he's up against and how to diminish the inevitable pain in order to face such a challenge more positively. Above all, he doesn't want to face such scary and colossal changes on his own, no one to talk to.
“Yes,” Castiel replied. “‘When he said, come live with me and be my love, and we will some new pleasures prove.’”
“I’m losing my grace,” he whispers just as Dean finishes to tell him something about Miracle. It's the first time he says it out loud, that he admits it plainly to someone other than himself. It feels good, like a weight that's been lifted from his shoulders, the pain no longer insular. “I’m not angry about it. I’m... happy. I really am. But I’m also terrified about what will happen. I don’t know, the deep oblivion. It’ll probably take a while to settle and I have no idea what the consequences will be.”
Castiel's about to speak when Dean moves closer and away, he looks at him and smiles softly. Blood is rushing through his veins and his thoughts are going staccato, he cannot sort them out and whatever coherence he may find leads back to the idea of tangent closeness and possibilities. He leans in, slowly, waiting for Dean to step back in shock, giving him enough time to do so. He'd ask but doesn't trust his voice, and then his lips are on Dean's, a gentle touch at the very beginning of a scale of impropriety. Neither of them moves. There are no soft sights, no confidence, no tips of tongues playfully touching in curious exploration as movements start to become more confident.
“Dean, we have time. We have all the time we want to talk about what you did and didn’t do. I don’t care, not now anyway. I’m just happy to be here. The rest will follow. The weight of the world doesn’t rest on your shoulders, you know. I’m not saying that it won’t take time, but it’ll be alright. Eventually.”
Go back and tell him. Now that they were about to start again, the ending and the beginning, he’d do it - rewind time in order to get a second chance despite them being monomaniacally forbidden. To tell him what? That he had loved him for a while, that the realization hadn’t come in the immediate aftermath of Castiel’s own confession, that feelings no matter their nature and whether or not he would have been able to point at them and name them for what they were, had always been there. What else? That he knew that language was garbage, words were easy to be misinterpreted, the mere shift of a stress or a momentary distraction enough to change an affirmation into an accusation or a question. But something else too, that in hindsight he was aware that his reaction to such honest words must have hurt somehow, having been less than ideal - partly shock, partly anger. Disbelief coming off as rejection - it was not about being, not entirely, but also about having. How to say any of it in such little time? And they had had before and after. One more thing then, that all their conversations, those flowery descriptions of mundane tasks, had saved his life by filling him with a will to live - they were like the quintessence of happiness and felt as if he had been taught love, tenderness and beauty all over again as if he had previously forgotten about them.
"I'm just they all made it, that's all. I'd say she's too old for her first litter, but she simply had to go whoring around at the ripe age of six," Dean jokes.
"A donkey, so you can easily imagine Jack's delight. And a cow that ate some paint not three days ago." He pauses. "Talking of Jack, you know that he looks up at you?"
He kicks a pebble that bounces off the pavement and onto the street with all the force he can muster and falls down, slipping, landing on his hands - the skin burns after it scratches against the concrete.
“I ain’t a fucking psychic, Cas. Ask him if you don’t believe me.” He exhales sharply. “But I’ll tell you this, he found an old walkie-talkie in one of the rooms and on bad days, we used to talk to you. Messages to the universe to kindle hope - yours or ours I don’t know. We used to ask you to come back before and after your rescue as you call it. Months of it. It helped both of us, not gonna lie. And there must still be one of the signs somewhere.”
“Well, I’m back home after a long day and you’re making me feel very poetic, Cas. Can’t blame a guy.”
As they sit there, one word starts to settle between them: Home. To have been away for so long nothing but a dream or a nightmare, but coming back! To come back. And this, the possibility of a life together, the concrete example of it, of this more and want and longing he used to feel. Pieces of a puzzle falling to their right place and the whole world finally making sense - striking and unexpected realization.
The words are coming out wrong. It's evasiveness at its best and more powerful as his feelings and thoughts roll and rapid, leaving him jealous of all those people who consider themselves out of touch with their own feelings in so much as to be able to speak with clarity and clear-headedness. Rotten business? He can hardly believe himself, he never called it like that before or thought about calling it such. Shame had never been his to feel: There's too much trust to fear to be reported, too much general incompetence for concrete fears. But their friendship - the most precious thing of all, carefully cultivated so linear and effortless despite the occasional arguments, despite the difficulties of their own personalities that sometimes make him believe that whatever God or fate caused their meeting, it must be having a good laugh at them.
“Just like that.” He pauses, studying his friend. He looks different, softer, kinder, less tired. Longer hair and a beard. Still beautiful, still Dean. “Good things do happen.”
Whether Dean is talking about the methodical and precise movements with which he’s combing Cas’s hair or in wider terms, Cas cannot tell. Either way, Dean’s voice sounds as vulnerable and open as it gets, perhaps the epitome of it, and he instinctively believes him.
He follows Dean down the corridor, past the closed doors, and looks himself around, studying the surroundings, looking out for possible changes. He says, “It’s slightly different than how I remember it.”
“Fine. Do I get a kiss?” Dean smirked and winked, stepping closer, closing the distance. Their lips brushed, tentatively and with yearning. “It’s been a long day.”
He discards one piece of clothing after the other, starting with his trench coat and finishing with his boxer briefs - folding everything and pulling it together in a neat pile which he hands Dean.
"Y-yeah." I mutter out but my voice doesn't sound like mine. It is croaky and full of emotion which makes Sam frown.
"She betrayed us your majesty. She was killing her own kind in the battle of Lawrence." His voice cracked and shook but I just looked back at him sadly and with disappointment etched across my face. "I had to do it."
"I know Cas, i know. I will go to bed, you're right. I'm pretty tired right now and i probably have a long day ahead of me tomorrow." He says, nodding his head and looking at me intently. We both step forward at the same time, him trying to get to the door and me going to shake his hand good night but it only leaves us standing closer then ever, so close that i could feel the warmth radiating off of his body. I gulped and looked up at him slowly and he did the same while looking down at me.
I sat in my room for the rest of the day, ignoring the door when it knocked and ignoring the bell when it rang. I didn’t feel hurt by the fact that I had just been made to have sex with the king, even though that was embarrassing and humiliating I wasn’t really that bothered by it at all. No, what bothered me was the fact that the demon prince had broken his promise. I should have known he would, I should have known that he wouldn’t tell the king that I belonged to him, but I still believed the demon. I sighed, rubbed my face and stood up off of my bed, wanting to stretch me legs for a bit. I walked out of my room and into the slave’s courtyard which was full of angels. They didn’t recognise me, they probably didn’t even know of me. Most of them are dragged here and made to work here for hundred upon thousands of years. I looked around the courtyard and then up to the bright, evening sky above me that opened up to multiple colours like reds, oranges, pinks and yellows. I smile to myself which seems that I don’t do often seen as it felt weird when I did. I should smile more often, most definitely.
"I don't love him, no. But there is something about him Michael, he and his brother are not what I call... Normal." I pull a bit of a face and he tilts his head slightly.
"Well you're not getting there very fast! Hurry it up a little I'm a busy man! Places to go and people to see and all that!" I snap back and we both stand there, glaring at each other.
“Your majesty, we caught a demon snooping around the camp.” He called to me and my back stiffened. Oh no, they had captured Dean. I turned around slowly but to my surprise is was Samuel Winchester, being held by the scruff of his shirt as he looked at all of us with puppy dog eyes.
The day came and went and it was finally night-time. Samuel, Sam, had come up to me on several occasions asking if he could come to the party but I declined all 20 times. I put on my best clothing, a green velvet tunic and waistcoat with matching leggings and high black boots. I placed my crown on top of my head and placed my black fur cloak around my shoulders, tying it up with a gold band. I looked in the large mirror that used to be my mums and straightened my outfit out. Normally I would have an angel dressing me but they were all too busy greeting people and making food for the ball tonight. I walked out of my room and down the long corridors and stairs towards the great hall. It had changed so much from when I had last been in and I couldn’t help but approve of the work the angels put in to make it look so elegant and rich.
"Dean, p-please." He móans as I start súcking on his neck greedily, wanting the taste of him in my mouth.
“You want me to send my women into army just because you have a gut feeling that this is all a trap?” Anna asks me and Dean’s head snaps up.
"Of course your highness." She blushed again and I nodded my head before turning around on my heel and walking away. That went pretty well.
"Thank you! You're not making this situation any easier!" With that he laughs his arse out of the room leaving me to grumble to myself about kings and princes.
Papa sent me to upstairs for a little while but even with the door closed it didn’t stop the shouts from travelling up the stairs and towards my ears. I heard something break from downstairs and then boots slamming across the wooden floors. There was one more shout before the door slammed shut and then everything went quiet. I stayed in my room for a few more minutes before tiptoeing down the stairs and towards the dining room where papa was sat with his head in his arms resting on the table. There was small whimpering noises coming from him and I didn’t like it. Not one bit. I stuck my bottom lip out and walked slowly and quietly towards him. My hand rested on his shoulder and he jumped slightly before looking at me and breathing out heavily. His eyes were red and puffy and his face was pale.
"I don't know anything about her." Castiel says, his voice cracking slightly and i nod my head in understanding.
“I suppose I was remembering what it was like to fly.” I say without thinking. I wasn’t really remembering what it was like to fly, but I couldn’t think of a better answer so this one would have to do.
“GET YOUR DIRTY HANDS OF MY FOOD!” Shrieked a loud women and she came over and hit his hand sharply.
The whole kingdom now knew about Valentina. There was uproar and outrage as well as gladness and happiness for a heir to the throne. Everyone now knew about Anna betraying me about being an angel and they all also knew that I would never go for another woman again so this was the only way that there would be an heir to the throne unless Sam got married to a nice demon woman and produced one… which was unlikely.
"Nothing." I say a bit too quickly and he grins wickedly. He jumps up out of his seat but I'm ready for him and quickly knock him back down. He skips around me quickly but in too slow to catch him and is quickly running to the other side of the room with the parchment that I was writing on not moments ago. "Give it back."
"I knew you would be in here, i was wondering why you didn't come back to your chambers." She raised a suggestive eyebrow at me and i laughed.
We walk into my chambers where an almost full bath is waiting for me in the middle of the room. Castiel walks over to the fireplace where the last bit of water is still boiling and takes it off the fire to throw it into the tub. He then drops the bucket and smiles at me.
"Your mother-" I walk closer to them before coming to a stop in front of them both. "She wasn't a demon."
I don’t think so, Cas. You’re stuck with me now. Stuck until the end of time, however long that will be. You’re too late to turn back, you’re too late to turn away. You go, I go. You jump, I jump and there ain’t nothing you can do about that.”
"Got you." I muttered to myself and managed to push my fingers into him further to reach his prostate again. He moaned loudly in pleasure and I smiled proudly at myself. I hit it a few times with my fingers before adding the final finger inside of him, making sure to spread his legs even wider then before. He groaned in pain when the third one went in and when it was finally all the way in I stayed still for a moment to let him get used to it.
"You sure darling?" I ask him, my eyes flickering black which only makes him móan again at my sudden dominance. He nods his head frantically and I flip hip around so he is facing the floor, lifting his híps up so he's now knéeling in front of me, expósing himself to me. I make him lick my fíngers which I find so hot before bringing my hand back around and slipping a fingér intó him. I slidé another one in for good measure and start curling it around insíde him make him arch his back and throw his head back in pleásure.
"Valentina?" My fathers asked as i came running into the house, tears pouring down my face and straight up to my room. I hear them running up the stairs to my room and bursting in, approaching the bed slowly.
"Yes! It slipped out of my fingers! I'm so sorry!" She cries and i just laugh loudly while she crawls around on her hands on knees to find it. "Stop laughing and help me." I sigh and get on my own hands and knees and start trying to find her stupid engagement ring.
“I think we should pull our your imperial majesty, I think Alistair is right. We don’t have nearly enough demons to fight the whole angel army and we have friends on the other side of the world that we can call upon to help us fight but I will take them months to get here. I say we wait for them to arrive before we start the main battle.” I say, not sure if that was what he wanted to here. Crowley sighs and rolls his eyes before nodding.
"You have a beautiful name, my dearest one." I say and she smiles shyly and blushes down at the ground, letting her long black curly hair fall in front of her face. "My name is Castiel." She looks up at me quickly, her eyes wide in shock and her lips parted slightly before they break into a huge smile.
It took me until sundown to finish cleaning the whole of the king's compartments; the bedroom, the washroom, the dressing room and the meeting room. By the end of it I was knackered, wanting to just fall down on my bed and sleep. My body stunk of sweat and cleaning fumes and also, working under the circumstances of having to wear literally just a sheet around my hips didn't help the situation. Whenever I had to bend over for something I was always worried that someone would come into the room and see... everything. I picked up the now empty bucket and wet cloth along with a hamper of dirty clothes and shoes that needed scrubbing. I was about to start walking out of the room when the door suddenly burst open and the king came in. He stopped when he saw me and I stood there awkwardly, not knowing what to do with myself.
Cas leads me upstairs slowly, facing me as he does so so he is walking backwards and smiling at me. He is holding onto the flower that Valentina had given to him and i had give to her gently in his hand while the other hand is grasped inside mine, hooking onto my fingers. We get to the door and he leans backwards on it while i lean into him and bury my face into his neck, kissing it softly while he sighs.
“No seriously! You have such a hard life! I would hate to be in your sho-“ I was cut off my hard lips pressing on mine, stopping my rant completely. I melted into the kiss and wrapped my arms around his neck and opening my mouth to grant him entrance. After a few moments he pulled away and looked into my eyes.
“SHUT UP! I DO HAVE A SAY IN THIS!” I shout, “IF YOU LEAVE WITH HER I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND TAKE HER FROM YOU.” With that I storm out of my study, leaving Leliel alone with her thoughts. I storm down into my chambers and collapse onto the bed when I get there.
"Put on your armour Dean, Angels have been spotted not far from here. We are going to hunt them down." Growled my father, flinging my heavy armour at me. I caught it quickly and clicked one of the maids to get it on me. As I was getting fitted up for it my father filled me in on what was happening.
"I don't know, I suppose I would make it clear that he's mine." I shrug coolly and Gabriel suddenly reaches behind him and opens my fathers chamber door quietly. Inside is my father on his bed, straddling someone and shoving himself into that person hard. I heard whimpers of pain come from the person so I moved reluctantly closer to find Castiel laying face down, tied up to the bed post which tears running down his cheeks. I back out of the room and shut the door quickly to block the sight out, but it doesn't block out of my mind. I look at Gabriel who has fire in his eyes, fury in his face and anger in his body language but he still looks so calm.
“Don’t tell me what to do! You are a liar and a dirty dirty little cheat! You have betrayed me and you have betrayed our daughter!”
"I can't do as you ask, my father will know I'm up to something!" I sigh and Gabriel put his head down and nods in understanding. "I'm sorry."
"Oh my god, yes!" He screamed as I started slamming on to his prostate. The wood of his headboard was flaking and chipping a bit at how hard he was gripping it and the hand that was holding his leg to my waist had dropped it and had now run up to his biceps, gripping him tightly and leaving my mark on him. Grunts, moans, gasps and cries filled the room from both of us and with a few final thrusts and pumps from me he started shooting all over his and my own abdomens. The fact that his hole tightened up around me when he cummed made me shout out in pleasure and still thrusting in and out of him, I shot my own load inside of him. We both rode out our orgasms together until we physically couldn't anymore so I finally pushed his legs off me and collapsed on top of him, not caring about the white sticky stuff that was all over the both of us. We both lay there, our bodies tangled together and breathing heavily as we both came down from our highs. Sweat was glistening on our bodies making us even more sticky then we were before but neither of us could be bothered to move, to get up and clean ourselves down and I thought that Dean would eventually get sick of me lying on top of me and push me out of his bed but to my gleeful surprise he instead wrapped his arms around me and held me close to him, burying his face in the crook of my neck. This position that we were both in now was how we fell asleep, not caring that one was an angel and one was a demon because for one, it was the first time he had ever been fucked and for the other, for me, it was the best sex I had ever had in my entire lifetime.
“Fine, don’t tell me.” I huff, crossing my arms moodily and we both go quiet. After a moment of silence Castiel opens his mouth to speak but quickly shuts it again. “Got something to say?”
"Well you'll see me today when we fight each other to the death." I joke and he hold back a smile and shakes his head.
"You have created your very own Eden here, but remember the story of Eden. There is always a snake in the grass." My eyes widen and I gulp down the lump that had gotten caught in my throat.
"Did you seriously just ask me how I'm pregnant, Castiel?" She asks me with a perked eyebrow and a ghost of a smile on her face.
I hold onto Marian's hand firmly as she leads me out of the castle and helps me up onto my pony that i was learning to ride. It was a fun activity but i prefered killing uncle sammy when he pretends to be a giant or playing with the wooden angel that papa carved for me. It's my favourite toy and i brought it everywhere with me. To make sure i pat in the pockets of the cloak and sure enough i feel the wooden angel in my pocket for me to play with when we get to the woods. We start riding slowly there because dada says i'm not old enough to gallop yet but i am looking forward to doing so, apparently it is really fun but it also hurts your bottom.
“What is his name? Where do you live?” He asks me calmly, his eyes boring right into my soul. My lip trembles but I don’t answer him, instead I just point to where the demon castle is, towards the black tower peaking above the trees. “Dean.” Castiel whispers out and I look at him quickly.
A few hours later, with the ring on her finger we are sat talking about getting away from here and going somewhere far over the seas. She plans on telling her fathers about me but i tell her not too, they will think i have brainwashed her.
"I hope you live a long and happy life here Castiel. I will pop in and pay a visit to Gabriel, telling him how you are. Goodbye my son and Dean, it was nice meeting you." Dean nods in respect and stands up at the same time I do to walk my father out of the house. He exits and stops to watch Valentina for a moment before turning around to look at us.
“Castiel is marching into battle but I think it’s a trap sent by Crowley. I need the women warriors to help them fight; I don’t think they will succeed on their own.” I say, almost pleading. “Please Anna, I can’t have my husband die, especially not now I’m-“My hand automatically goes up to my stomach and her eyes go wide.
People were rushing around, getting ready and getting me ready. The whole time I felt like a doll, people dressing me up in fancy clothes while I just stood there lifeless, not wanting to move or to speak to anyone. I was ushered out of the room and towards the entrance to the great hall where I would be entering to accept my crown off my father. I could already hear people in there, murmuring quietly while the angels were still sorting out my cloak and adding extra jewellery as an added effect. Suddenly the angels disappeared and there were trumpets playing from inside the great hall. I heard my name being called out, loud and clear.
“His Majesty only has one male sex slave your highness; you must be talking about Castiel. Blue eyes and a sassy gob?”
He sipped down the rest of his drink and pushed the cake away from him. Suddenly he didn’t have very much of an appetite, as beautifully nice as the cake actually was. Castiel stood up from his table, avoiding the business table as much as possible and walked into the toilets at the far end of the coffee shop. He went to business and just as he was washing his hands, the doors flung open.
“EGH.” Castiel shouted loudly, throwing his hands up in the air before turning to Gabriel. “See this is what I mean, she just assumes things and is way out of her place.”
He imagines the sound of steps down the corridor or merely up the metal stairs, Dean’s hand on the handrail as he quickly runs up. His hand on the doorknob or perhaps turning the keys in the keyhole first. It’s different, he doesn’t dare think about how much he didn’t witness.
“It wasn’t out of pity. I’m forty-three, Cas, I know who I am and I know what I want and I don’t want to waste any time playing stupid games. You’re back and if you still feel the same way as you did last year-”
"You're welcome." Castiel pauses and looks away. He stretches out his hand and gently pets Dean's dog, checking on her newborns for any sign of distress only to find them peacefully asleep, close to their mother. "I should go. Head back. Jack-"
But there had been the need. Once. Almost two years ago. Castiel had told him about his feelings and he hadn’t said anything back, that itself was a muck up. Stupid and foolish because it was reciprocation and disbelief mixing together, feelings rolling and rapid. It was bound to happen, was it not? Realistically speaking, anyway: Every time they stood next to each other his heart soared and he always found himself thinking,
It had been Castiel’s idea to move out or, rather, Dean himself had toyed with the thought of it, and Castiel had been the first one to bring it up. Of course, he had been, always five steps ahead and Dean always behind trying to catch up. The bunker was hardly a place for a child to grow up in and now that they had stopped hunting it was hardly a place for them too. Trembling lips and broken voices, the lamp on Castiel’s bedside table exposing all their secrets - liars but not cruel to anyone but themselves. A sharp pain at his heart, such a wretched devil of a whole, as Castiel explained his intentions. Later Castiel would say that the thought of Dean not coming had never occurred to him: what they had was good, he had no intention of leaving it behind. But looking at Castiel, realizing that the lack of definition had somehow undermined their time together, making it fragile and ephemeral, although hardly insignificant, had come as a blow. The vulnerable moment with a sense of fatality, of gloom and destruction, preceded by the two of them lying in between the sheets, the cotton-linen stained with emission. Before that, hands skilfully undoing and releasing. A work of art.
From the very beginning although messier, an odd detention of the other's presence, capturing the very first moment and making it last infinitely long. Longer than necessary, distorting time itself. Silently creating a moment of exposure and education, revealing something new, influencing views and feelings, making it look different, bigger and of more importance compared to everyday life, inflated to the point that sometimes, at night, before checking on Jack one last time, it feels impossible to wrap his head around such knowledge, around his love, and the possibility that he relearned to care about the world from Dean.
Lucifer's face twists in a frown and he rounds on Castiel. "What the fuck do you think you know about Kelly?"
A voice in the back of Castiel’s mind reminds him of the brother, niece and toddler sleeping down the hallway. He hates the interruption, but he knows it’s right. He pulls away from Dean and says, “Grab some blankets, we’re going for a drive.”
Dean makes a disgustingly adoring face at his phone before turning up to look at Benny again. "He wants to buy you a bottle of your favourite drink, what the fuck. Who is that nice?"
"You know he'd never do that, he likes me too much. I know you do too." When Charlie does finally turn to look at him, she's got the stupidest grin on her face, and she's rolling her eyes at him. "I love you too by the way, and I'm still heartbroken that you won't elope with me and run away to California."
Castiel looks like he doesn't believe Dean. "I am finding myself extremely attracted to you, and I wish for you to kiss me again. A kiss I shall participate in this time."
Castiel's grin is sharp and smug, and he anchors his arms around Dean's shoulders then swings his leg around Dean's hip. Dean catches him, arms going under Castiel's knees, holding him up and against the tree behind him. Castiel's back is going to be scraped to hell after this, but he's an angel, Dean supposes he can just heal himself.
Dean never misses, and today is no different. His teeth sink into the hare's scruff, breaking its neck, and he waves it for the raven, showing off. The raven trills, swooping down with its wings outspread to peck at Dean playfully. He butts his muzzle into the tiny feathery body.
“If you’re going to present, yes,” Sam replies, nodding his head. “But what will you do if you do present?”
"You think a magic man cursed you?" Sorcerers, at least, Dean knows about. He's met a few over the years, that’s where he goes when he needs healing potions and he doesn't feel comfortable going into human towns. They ask fewer questions.
"I'll get to you in a moment," Dean tells Lucifer, blinking at Sam like he'll suddenly be a wolf again in the next blink of his eyes. "What the fuck."
"I can't feel him. He's either off-world, or he's hidden himself very well," Gabriel admits, shrugging his shoulders almost nonchalantly.
"Why are you alone? I mean, wolves live in packs don't they? And I mean, I know there's that expression, ‘
Dean leaves them in the kitchen to find Eileen, Mary and Deanna. They're in the bathroom, Mary sitting in a rocker while Eileen tries to braid Deanna's mop of dark curls, and Dean steps inside with them, stealing Mary before the other two have noticed. Mary giggles, and Eileen catches his eye in the mirror and turns back to look at them, pins sticking out of her mouth.
“I know what you’re doing wrong, but you can stop if you want to, Cas,” Dean replies gently, reaching over to pull Castiel’s hand into his lap. He takes the rope from him and says, “You’re still new to rope, man, don’t expect it to come in a day. Do you want me to show you again?”
Dean slides down until he's lying down, hands clasped over his chest. He closes his eyes, willing sleep to take hold, but it doesn't.
Castiel smiles smugly, and perhaps a little stupidly, and does as told, rolling onto his front when Dean crawls out of the way. He rescues one of the pillows from under his head and wiggles it under his hips. Dean takes another pillow, wedging it with the first, arching Castiel’s back further so his ass is higher in the air. The angle makes the base of his spine ache just enough to merge nicely with the heat in his gut, lighting his body on fire before Dean’s even gotten around to touching him.
"First of all," Dean says, "Dinosaurs, I love it. Second of all, sorry about the divorce. Third of all, you have kids?"
With nothing to input, no ideas of safe places for them to continue to, Dean simply replies, "Sure."
Rowena taps her finger over her lip. "Power comes with age, it's likely this witch is incredibly old and has no problem working with demons." She suddenly stops and her mouth turns down into a frown. "You know the story of Little Briar Rose - Sleeping Beauty? The sleeping curse? It was based on medieval prose, Perceforest, which was in turn based on the story of Endymion, a mortal man who fell in love with the goddess Selene. According to legend, Selene asked Zeus to grant Endymion eternal life, but Zeus instead put the man into an eternal sleep."
"You're being nosy, cher," Benny decides, nodding his head and pushing the tray shut until it clicks, throwing the cardboard tube in the trash under the counter. "Why do you care so much?"
"You're a dick," he tells Benny, reaching down to stroking his fingers through the short dark hair on the man's head. He really wishes it was long enough to pull, damn Benny and his stupid short hair. As Benny is reaching his hand into the open vee of Dean's jeans and taking out his dick, Dean shoves his hand into his pocket and pulls out the lube he took from the Impala's glove box. "While you're down there, do us a favour?"
The other man's eyes grow wide in surprise. Dean's not surprised he doesn't know about werewolves. As far as he's aware, he's the last one left. "I don't… werewolves aren't
Benny does, using his knife to cut a slice of the cheese, then spread the dip on a piece of pita bread. He puts it all together and takes a bite of it all, chewing slowly and swallowing. "I like that better." He eats the rest of it in one go, smiling as he chews. "And what's the last one?"
Castiel's mouth breaks into a broad grin, like he can't hold onto it any longer, and he nods his head vigorously. "Yeah, I did, they called me this morning, emailed me everything. It's a thirty percent pay rise, I'd be assistant head of the department and I can drive in from town every morning."
"No… well, yes. How did you know it was me?" Castiel asks, taking a seat on the edge of Dean's mattress, picking up the candy wrapper he finds hidden in the sheets. He rolls his eyes and stands up to put it in the trash can.
He hears shuffling outside the tent, footsteps on dry, crackling leaves, twigs snapping. He goes on the offensive, gun raised, safety off, with his finger on the trigger, watching as someone (or something) pulls the zipper of the tent’s door down.
One of Dean’s hands curls around Castiel’s crossed wrists, holding on tightly as he feeds his cock inside Castiel’s body. Once the head pops inside Castiel, Dean grinds his hips in, just slow enough not to hurt Castiel, but still bottoming out in seconds. Castiel groans deep in his chest as the tip of Dean’s cock brushes against his prostate briefly, tugging at his wrists in Dean’s hold, just to feel Dean’s hand tighten. Dean’s strong, he could break Castiel’s wrists if he holds Castiel too hard, but he’s always careful. It’s always tight enough that Castiel can feel it, and he can’t get away, but never hard enough to actually hurt.
He writes the note and leaves it on the kitchen counter before finding a sweater in the diaper bag for Mary. He makes sure that Deanna's got a coat on before he hands her Mary to get his own on. The walk to the drugstore is less than ten minutes, only the next street over and a few blocks up. They get the formula - and a candy bar for Deanna because she
Dean wiggles out of his briefs and climbs up Castiel's body, pressing kisses into his skin as he goes. Just as Dean is kissing Castiel and taking his cock in his hand to steady it, they hear drunken yelling from down the hallway. It's a male voice, so it has to be Sam, and it's not scared or angry so Dean doesn't worry. He just laughs.
Castiel nods. "Sometimes. I prefer teaching, but I have a speciality that sometimes means I get called out. Usually it's only to a museum or another university, but occasionally they'll ship me out to digs. Last one was in Australia in february. Australian megafauna is a pet project at the moment."
The glow of the archangel's eyes doesn't waver, and the smug look on his face proves that he's doing it on purpose - to prove his power, probably.
Sam is sitting at the kitchen table with a lore book and a beer, and Eileen is somewhere she hasn't seen fit to explain to any of them (again). Dean hasn't mentioned Sam's unwillingness to assist yet, or his laziness, which is unusual for him, but Castiel doesn't bother to ask why when he's far more interested in looking at him.
"What year is it?" When Claire tells him that it was made in 1960, Dean tries to remember the usual causes of an engine that won't start in a car made that long ago. It's hard without being able to see the engine, but he had a '58 Mustang in a few months ago with an alternator that hadn't been returning the power back to the battery. Even fixing the cables hadn't helped, when it normally would. Bobby had told him pre-70's alternators for Mustangs were a load of shit, and if he came across another to replace it with a new one without bothering to check the wires. "If she'll let you, get a replacement alternator, do you think you could replace it yourself?"
Dean's heart drops into his belly, and he feels like he might vomit again, like he had the night before. It had been a long time since he'd heard that name, but he remembered her, remembered the woman with the dark hair and even darker fur who played with him when he was small. His dad would talk about her sometimes, too, when he got older: how she loved Dean and Sam like her own sons, unable to have her own. She'd been like a sister to his dad. They'd been born on the same day and they'd grown up together. Dean wants to deny it, wants to pretend this guy is talking about some other Ellen, but he can't, he can't pretend. "Why would she take you?" he whispers, unable to speak any louder in case he loses control of his tightly held emotions. He doesn't need to cry again, not in front of Sam. "We were still alive."
As Rowena explains the plan, Dean takes his chance to observe Bobby Singer. He's sure he's never met the man before, but his face is so familiar, and Dean could swear he's heard his voice before, but he can't place it. He seems almost kindly, though, despite what Dean knows of his history, like an old uncle. It's a weird feeling.
"That I was working on it, cause I am." Dean reaches over and hooks his fingers in the belt loops of Benny's pants. "You working on it?"
Dean's suddenly come to the startling realization that it's entirely possible to die, for real, in this world. And with no angels or reapers or God to bring them back, that's it, it's over.
Castiel doesn't hesitate before he agrees, settling into bed with Dean and wrapping himself around the other man's back, deciding, without hesitation, that this is where he belongs. Dean's hand reaches over to the bedside table and the lamp atop it, and Castiel watches him turn it off with a click.
"Cmon, we're dining and dashing," he jokes in a whisper. Castiel looks horrified, and Dean bursts into laughter, catching the attention of some of the other diners around them. "I'm kidding Cas, I've already paid, c'mon."
“The third man hurt Ollie, he hit him on purpose.” The eldest looks back at Dale and Ollie again then, wincing. “And the fourth…” he doesn’t say else for so long that Dean wonders if he’s going to say anything at all. “She tried to yank Ollie off the street, managed to get him in a car before Ollie lost control.”
Benny bursts into laughter, but Castiel nods very seriously, like he actually thinks Dean would do something stupid like withhold sex when he's pretty sure he wouldn't make it a day.
Dean grimaces and says, "I get that. Hey, I gotta run to work, but if you need any help with the house," he reaches into his pocket for his wallet and pulls out the receipt for the gas after work the night before. "You got a pen?" Castiel opens the passenger door with a creak and leans in to pull open the glovebox, searching for a pen. Dean tries not to stare at his ass for longer than is polite but it is
"This smells amazing," Castiel says, staring down at the food on his plate before handing the spoon over to Dean who scoops out his own serve. It does smell amazing, and Dean's stomach grumbles. He takes a piece of garlic bread and says, "Okay, now
Christ. He slides his hand down Castiel's body from his cheek to his ass, pressing his fingers between Castiel's cheeks. His cock jerks when he feels the slick at Castiel's hole. "Holy fuck, Cas, you're incredible."
Castiel grows close quickly, already on the edge for so long, and it suddenly occurs to Castiel that the feeling of being so close to coming isn't far from using his angelic power, and isn't that a strange concept? At a particularly deep thrust he moans, "Dean I'm so close, I'm gonna come."
Benny and Castiel get down to their briefs, their clothes scattered around the room, and Dean takes the opportunity to wriggle his fingers down and inside to take them both in his hands. They gasp into each other's mouths and he feels them both harden further in his hands. Their mouths part, and Benny catches Dean's in a kiss while Castiel kisses down his throat. They're thrusting their cocks into his fists - Castiel slowly and Benny forcefully - and he squeezes so they both groan.
Dean reaches his hand down and aligns his cock with Castiel's slick hole, thrusting his hips up carefully until the head of his dick pops through the ring of muscle and into Castiel's body. Castiel groans, throwing his head back against the tree trunk, tilting his hips towards Dean and down, forcing more of Dean's cock inside him than Dean would have given him so quickly. A flush has worked its way from the apples of Castiel's cheeks down his chest, leaving his skin a nice shade of pink that Dean wants to suck red marks into. So he does. He gets his mouth on Castiel's shoulder and sucks a bruise into the pale skin there, fingers digging more bruises into the flesh of Castiel's thighs.
"Yes," Charlie confirms, nodding her head. She's concentrating on the saucepan in front of her, the milk inside just beginning to bubble, and Dean's about to leave so he doesn't interrupt her when she says, "He was Naomi Oksana's kid."
Dean hugs his brother again, stroking his back. His heart aches for Sam, and his heart aches for himself. But the ache is nothing compared to the weight that he's suddenly felt disappearing from his shoulders now that he knows his brother is alive.
Gabriel looks up from the chocolate bar he's been eating, eyebrows furrowed, and says, "You accused me of working with Lucifer? He's a bag of dicks."
He fights through the oversensitivity that's making his muscles shake, fucking up into Castiel a few more times, stroking his cock until he comes too.
After dinner and once Sam has washed the dishes and Eileen has put them back in their place, Dean announces to the kitchen that the Impala hasn't been out for some time and that he and Castiel are going for a drive. Castiel doesn't mind that he wasn't consulted, he enjoys spending time with Dean no matter what they do. When he turns to look at Sam and Eileen, Sam is undisturbed by Dean's announcement, however, Eileen shoots Dean a grateful look.
"We summoned the witch. You knew we were coming, but not as quickly as you would have if she was here," Dean says when he realizes the thought processes that brought Castiel to the realization that the witch had Jack. "If you left Jack alone with the witch, he's alone right now.
Dean throws his hands out. "Hundreds of years ago! How can you know what will happen when this baby is born?"
When Dean can feel his orgasm beginning to build in his gut, his thighs start to ache and he has to stop, which both his cock and the man under him protest. "I need to swap, my thighs feel like they're on fire," he tells Castiel, rubbing his knuckle down the muscle on the underside of his thigh. "It's your fault, making me do all the work, lazy son of a bitch."
"Why Toledo?" Sam asks as they surround Bobby, staring down at the laptop. "And why wouldn't he just take Jack down to hell."
. Now, he's just waiting for the moment that Castiel returns to heaven with Gabriel and Michael. It's an ugly feeling, one that sits heavy in his gut.
Dean lets out a loud guffaw and leans over to slap the back of his hand over Castiel's hip in a playful manner, leaving his hand on Castiel's hip when he's done it. "It was a joke, Cas."
Castiel hums thoughtfully. "Curiosity. Attraction. Another feeling I cannot name. It involves lightheadedness and occasional increased blood flow to my groin and genitals."
"I'll keep it open for ten minutes, be quick," Rowena waves her hand and a portal appears in the middle of the room. Dean pulls his shoes on in a hurry before stepping through it and into a janitor's closet.
The only thing that placates his thoughts is the knowledge that if the secret was something bad, they wouldn't keep it from him.
Dean wakes for the second time when the wintry sun begins to fill the cave, shining behind his eyelids. He's suddenly aware of his growling stomach, and climbs to his feet to look for any leftover dried meat. There are a few pieces left in the bag and he eats two of them before taking the last piece over to the raven. Castiel isn't asleep anymore, but he hasn't moved from his spot next to the fire. He's sitting there, watching Dean with piercing black eyes.
Castiel's face shoots up and he loses his hold on the boxes, the one on top crashing to the ground and flying open, leaving a pile of clothes on the path.
“Okay?” Castiel asks, checking the tension in each stretch of rope across Dean’s body. Each tug sends electric shocks down his body and makes the heat in his belly grow.
The angels arrive next, popping in with a flutter of wings. Gabriel stands in the middle, a woman on one side of him, with red hair who's shorter than even Gabriel, and a man on the other with dirty blonde hair and strangely piercing blue eyes.
"Dean, god, Dean," Cas says, breathy and high, digging his fingernails into Dean's shoulder so hard Dean's sure he's drawn blood. Dean dares a look up at Castiel and groans when he sees him, back arched and skin mottled red, muscles in his arms bulging.
Dean tilts his head towards the male nurse and pulls Alex off to the side with a hand on her elbow. He whispers, "Hunters are on their way, we need to leave. We only have a few minutes before the portal closes." Alex nods and pulls away from Dean, heading for a door across the hallway and slipping inside. When she comes out she's got a jacket over her scrubs and a handbag over her shoulder. She leans over the counter and whispers something to the man, who nods, waving her off.
Dean thrusts up into Castiel's body, chasing his own pleasure, and only remembers at the very last minute to not fuck in too far when his knot starts to form at the base of his cock. Castiel blinks big, pale blue eyes at Dean, and he would almost call that look innocent if Castiel weren't tensing his hole around Dean's cock on purpose.
He takes his medication and drinks half of the glass of water (God, he really hates drinking water, he doesn't understand why he can't take his medication with coffee, life would be so much easier) before checking his phone again. Castiel hasn't texted again, so Dean says,
"Cas, c'mon," Dean says, going back to the dishes. "It's not cool to fuck someone just cause you're curious."
Castiel's social skills aren't exactly perfect - in fact, they're far from perfect and much closer to absent, even after years spent in the human world - but he's almost sure Dean's trying to use his body language to tell Castiel something, something he isn't understanding.
When she's finished eating he catches her attention and signs, "Is it alright if Castiel and his children come to thanksgiving?"
Dean gets a bit annoyed when he realises Castiel probably thinks he's in the right and Dean's in the wrong, but he's too tired to care about it too much.
"Take him to Rowena," Dean tells Gabriel who nods, ignoring Sam's protests. "Stay there with them, keep an eye on Dagon." Gabriel nods again before taking Sam's arm and disappearing.
Rowena hums, and after a moment's pause she says, "An hour and a half maybe. Not enough time for me to be ready, we'll have to wait until tonight." She blinks over at Castiel, still sitting in the corner of the couch—he's not moved for hours. Dean's starting to wonder if he's in shock. "You can stay here, I've got things to do today. Call back and order me coffee, please."
Dean stands in front of the other man and kisses his hair before holding him against his body, head resting on his belly. "Haven't got a clue, either, but we'll figure it out. At least Rowena will be able to break the spell soon." Castiel's arms come up around Dean's hips and he holds him tightly, snuffling into Dean's belly. It's rather endearing and Dean chuckles softly. "Maybe you're a prince or something. Like the movies you told me about."
He finds one behind a large boulder a few feet from the patch of Cyprus and he picks it up, careful not to damage it in any way. It's beautiful, despite the fact it mostly looks like a moth, with big yellow eyes on its wings to scare away predators and light grey veins. He's not positive it's the right one, so he shows it to Castiel before he puts it in another pouch when the angel nods.
The vibrations of the cock in Dean’s ass are starting to get too much and he says to Castiel, who’s still shaking through his orgasm, “Ah fuck, get it out before I die!”
Benny squeezes again. "We need to talk about Castiel as well. How you want it to go. How I want it to go. How he wants it to go. This isn't something I've had experience in before, but I know you have, and I suppose I just need to understand everything."
They're almost back to the cave when a branch cracks in the distance, pricking Dean's ears. He stops there in the snow, sniffing the air and listening. Under the evergreen and snow is the distinct scent of humans and gunpowder.
"Toni Bevell, London Chapterhouse. Less of a pleasure," Dean replies, reaching over to slide the vial of Castiel's Grace into Castiel's jacket pocket, buttoning it closed. "The way I see it, you have two options here. One, you let us leave the room…"
Dean lets out a startled laugh and stares down at himself. He'd completely forgotten. "Jody came in when I was bathing Jack, said I should hold him shirtless as much as realistically possible. Something about bonding and skin to skin contact, helping him learn how to regulate his body temperature. I can't remember, I was only half-listening. I was too terrified I was going to drop him in the water." Jack falls asleep before he can finish the whole bottle, mouth fallen open around the teat, so Dean takes it away, setting it back on the bedside table. He shuffles down on the bed, lying against the pillows and lays Jack over his chest. Dean suddenly feels more tired than he can ever remember feeling before, vision almost blurry. "I'm going to sleep with him, can you-"
Dean takes a second, sorts through the emotions and the thoughts, takes a deep breath and says, "Not angry anymore. I feel down, but not depressed. I feel like…" he chews his lip. "Exhausted. I'm exhausted."
. The weight of her father's disappearance and her mother's death hasn't hung over her head for her entire teenage years. In this world, at least before it ended, she was happy, loved.
"Because I may not necessarily be able to sense it," Castiel side-eyes him, an amused smile on his face as Dean takes in their surroundings. They're in a patch of Cyprus trees next to a small lake gone green from algae. There are a few houses on the other side of the lake, mostly hidden by trees, and a little girl playing with a toy truck on the bank. She looks up at them, tilting her head to the side in confusion, before shrugging to herself and going back to playing. "You get the cones, I'll see if I can find a butterfly."
Dean's only response is to hum, and when Castiel looks up at him, he's got his lip between his teeth, worrying at the skin, looking deep in thought. He doesn't say anything, barely even registers Castiel's trying to get his attention until Castiel says his name again. His eyes refocus and the smile he bestows to Castiel is beautiful. Dean reaches up with his free hand and takes Castiel's face into it, running his thumb over his cheekbone. Castiel gets the urge to lean forward and press his mouth to Dean's, and he's just about to when Dean pulls his hand away again and says, "C'mon, Cas, let's go home."
Castiel reaches out and takes Dean's hand, threading their fingers together as Benny rests his own hand on Dean's knee. "Don't be."
Dean holds on as Castiel rides him, thrusting his hips up every now and then when Castiel grinds down, striking his prostate. Castiel’s getting desperate, whimpering loudly and digging his nails into Dean's shoulder. The muscles in his thigh jump under Dean's biceps, and his thrusts are slowing like he's getting tired and his thighs are aching. Dean pulls him down on top of him, kissing him and fucking up into the clutch of his body.
"So, I guess it's time," Dean nods his head matter of factly. "We'll summon the witch tonight, we all need time to sleep and get ready. Rowena, call the coven."
Castiel rolls his eyes and climbs off of Dean and the bed, just in time for a knock at the door, announcing the arrival of the pizza. Castiel throws the remote on the bed next to Dean and Dean props himself up with his arms under his head so he can watch Castiel answer the door.
Castiel shoots Dean a pleading look from between his fingers, and Dean decides to take pity on him. "I have many paramours, a regular Lothario."
. There's a jacket hanging over his bed, he'd planned to wear it that day but changed his mind and went with another, and he throws it over the back of the chair next to his bed despite how easy it would be to just
Dean laughs at the absolute absurdity of the situation. "You're horny, Cas. Your body is turned on."
"I want you to," Castiel says, licking his lips. Dean takes a second to wonder what he's saying, about to ask him, but he doesn't need to when Castiel continues, "Dean, I want you to put it in me, I want you to knot me."
Dean frowns. “I’ve no idea, I’ve never come across a pregnant ghoul before. I’ll call Garth and Sam, see if they can find any info.”
Dean laughs, lots of people ask him that, all the time. "I got a phone call when I turned twenty-one, said there was a trust fund in my name available to me now. Our mom's parents died long before we were born, and absolutely everything they had went into a trust fund for Sam and I. Sam got a scholarship for undergrad and the trust fund paid for the law degree. The trust fund had to pay for Adam's undergrad and medical school, but it covered most of it, I think I only ended up paying like five grand out of pocket? It completely drained the money, but it's what it was for anyway."
Castiel looks resigned and Dean chuckles at the two of them. "So glad I didn't have kids, means I get to be the cool uncle who lets them do the things their parents wouldn't normally let them do and I can hand them back when I'm done." Castiel laughs at Dean, and Benny rolls his eyes. Jack's eyes are sparkling, like he already has something planned.
Dean's heart hammers in his chest, and he chuckles, pressing his face into Castiel's shoulder. "Let's work up to it, okay, Cas? Why don't we... I dunno..." Dean looks down the line of Castiel's body, and this time, he lets himself look. Castiel's dick isn't fully hard, but Dean doesn't think it will take him very long to get there. He's thicker than Dean and slightly longer, and despite knowing very little about other men's penises, Dean decides it's a very
. Castiel really wanted the job in Missoula as research department head, but both Dean and Benny had been hoping he'd get the job in Bozeman. They'd talked about what would happen - what they wanted to happen with the possibility of each job, and they'd made decisions that they hadn't told Castiel yet, waiting until he'd gotten confirmation. "Well, don't keep us hanging."
When they manage to calm themselves down, Dean holds Sam at arm’s length so he can look at him. "You look like dad, you know, but fuck did you get tall. I swear dad was never this tall."
“Dean? What happened?” Castiel asks, trying to twist his body so he can look back at Dean. The angel releases his wrists and Castiel manages to get himself up on his elbows and his upper body turned around. It instantly becomes pretty apparent why Dean stopped. “Dean, your wings manifested.”
Benny's the first up, making a beeline for the coffee machine and making himself a cup before he presses a kiss to his cheek. Dean gives Claire and Benny some of the pancakes that are ready and makes more for Castiel and Jack when they get up.
They find a pile of board games in a closet with bed linens and play them, just because they can. Dean rules at
Occasionally, when he needs something Castiel has cut up, he'll lean over where Castiel sits, hand on Castiel's shoulder to steady himself, hair brushing against Castiel's cheek. It's the only time Sam will look up from his book, to shoot them a confused frown, before he shakes his head and continues reading. Castiel is still confused, more so than he was by Dean's increased contact, but he hasn't bothered to ask what Sam had meant.
"'Probably'?" Dean mutters in disbelief, leaning down to press their mouths together again so Castiel cant reply. When Castiel feels thoroughly kissed, Dean pulls back, a look of nervous anticipation on his face, and says, "I haven't really… I've never done this before, you'll have to, like, tell me if you don't like something."
"Thank you," he says to her, shooting her a smile before turning back to the food. She's left a spoon with the bake and Castiel takes it, scooping some out onto his plate.
Dean makes another choking noise, and the heat in his gut has morphed into a full blown hard on. He reaches down and gets his hand around the shape of it, groaning at the touch. Benny's trying to convince Dean to get off with him, or call him over to fuck, and Dean's more than ready to agree when his phone buzzes with a text from Castiel. He's convinced then that they're conspiring against him, because Castiel has written,
Castiel pulls Dean up onto the couch with him and shuffles them around so Castiel’s lying on his back against the cushions and Dean is settled between his thighs. Castiel loves holding him like this - running his fingers through Dean’s hair and stroking along Dean’s back, shoulders, and arms - even if Dean gets antsy quickly, needing to move. It’s so un-angel-like, Dean’s constant need to be active, he’s like no other angel Castiel’s ever met.
. It take a stupid amount of time for Dean to figure out Benny got it for Dean, for easier clean up. Guess he's not as stupid as he looks.
Castiel frowns, tilting his head to the side as he tries to process Dean's words. "Dean, humans who were born male cannot become pregnant, it couldn't have been yours, mine or Sam's."
"I hid the two boys in a house the hunters had already gone through, then called some people to come get them. I called a witch, told them to take the boy's memories. It's why you can't remember the night you lost your family."
"Castiel's the opposite," Dean turns to look at the raven again and says, "It's really him. It’s really my brother, isn't that insane?" With a flap of wings, the raven lifts into the air and settles itself on Dean's shoulder, pecking at a patch of scalp above his ear. "Oi, quit it."
Dean's honestly surprised she's lasted this long; he expected the Nephilim to come days ago. He'd thought, considering it seemed to be pretty much conscious already, it would have chosen to come out, rather than stay in longer. Dean gets the feeling the Nephilim is putting off its mother's death as long as possible (if that's even conceivable).
Dean grins broadly and fights the urge to kiss Castiel, brushing his fingers over Castiel's wrist before watching him leave. He goes back inside and starts on dinner.
“We won’t know until you do,” Eileen signs. “Dean’s attraction to you is no indication. Same presentation mating mating pairs are just as common as opposite presentation mating pairs.”
is most definitely one of those phrases. Dean's mouth tilts up into a sharp smile. "Lean over, then."
Lucifer and Michael delve into an argument in another language, presumably Enochian, the same as Castiel had spoken when he summoned the two. They're bickering like normal brothers would, and it's even more amusing than Castiel as the snotty little brother. Two celestial beings sniping at each other like children is hilarious.
"Go take this into the kitchen, I'll be in in a second." He hands Jack a tinfoil covered dish. Jack seems happy to go, but Claire gives them a
Despite the original tension he felt between them, they seem to have relaxed now, and they chat easily, pulling Dean and Rowena into their conversations - even Castiel after a little poking. Patience seems most interested in Castiel, particularly his memory loss, and wonders aloud if his memory is hidden or completely gone.
At one point, Jack explains that there's a new girl at school that he likes, who's hard of hearing, and so he's been teaching himself ASL, and Eileen is more than happy to let him practice with her, correcting his movements, and teaching him new signs. When she's had enough beer that she's pink-cheeked and glassy eyed, she also teaches him a bunch of swears and insults, which causes the others on the table who know them to burst into laughter. She also teaches him how to ask the girl out on a date without revealing what she's taught him, and tells him to sign it to her the minute he sees her next, promising that she'll love it. Dean's not sure what Jack thinks Eileen's taught him, but he doesn't question it.
“You look too smug for your own good,” Castiel tells him, wrist flexing as his body shudders and his mouth slants open. He’s panting and Dean’s hands itch to touch.
, and though Castiel obviously knows the word, he doesn’t understand the connotation. They both turn back to Castiel at the same time, looks on their faces that he can’t decipher.
, and he's done. His back arches almost violently as he comes, spurting over his belly and chest, his hand clenched around the headboard so hard it hurts. Benny doesn't last much longer than Dean, the warmth of his come seeping into the condom and making Dean's gut feel heavy and hot.
Castiel hangs around the doorway, but Benny walks to the bed and moves Dean's knees so he can take a seat next to him. Dean watches Castiel's eyes drift to Benny's, and he can see Castiel's half of a silent conversation. Eventually, after what feels like forever, Castiel moves, reaching the bed and climbing to his knees, leaning against the bed with his forearms braced on the mattress, resting his chin on his hands.
It's something that's been going on for a while, even longer than Castiel can truly remember, but something that he's only just beginning to notice. He'd been far too busy in the last decade, but now, with Chuck and his Grace gone - for good this time - he's had the occasion to examine the exchanges the two of them have shared in the ten years they've known each other.
Castiel comes then, biting into Dean's fingers, spilling semen between their bodies. When his body squeezes around Dean's dick, he comes too, groaning his pleasure into Castiel's mouth. Castiel grunts when Dean pulls out of him and drops onto the bed next to him.
Michael and Lucifer appear next to Kelly, each taking one of her hands. Gold light shines from Kelly's belly, climbing up her skin like lightning and glowing in her eyes before reaching out to the archangels. After a few moments, symbols on the building that had originally been invisible start to glow in that same shining gold before burning red and melting down the walls like fresh paint.
Dean nods, and watches as Benny calls over a waiter to pay for their dinner. It's their first waitress, and she waits until Benny's handed her the cash before she mutters something as she's leaving. He can't hear it, but he doesn't like it, and he climbs to his feet - probably about to do something stupid like get into a fight with a waitress in the middle of a busy restaurant - but Benny and Castiel both pulling him back down.
Castiel climbs to his feet and pulls his shirt over his head, leaving himself bare-chested as he fiddles with the button of his jeans. He’s trying to look coy, and if Dean didn’t know him any better, he would almost fall for it. “And how exactly do you want me on the bed Dean?”
"Do you speak French, Castiel?" Benny asks, and he has the good sense to look at least a little embarrassed.
Dean's walking away when he hears Crowley stand, smells the rush of power as he gathers his energy to spell Dean. He shifts back into his wolf form and pounces on the witch, clamping his mouth on his arm and biting until he feels muscle tear and bone crack under his teeth. Crowley yowls in pain and Dean flings him off to the side, letting go so he collapses against the concrete floor.
Castiel snorts into Dean’s shoulders, pressing a kiss to the bony skin there. Dean’s arms come up around Castiel and hold him tight to him, and he kisses Castiel back. “I need ten minutes before I’m back to normal.”
"Some ground rules," He starts, pointing at the women. "Claire has been given permission to shoot you if you piss anyone off, or say anything to anyone she deems rude. They won't be witch bullets so they won't kill you, but they'll hurt like a bitch, so don't try it. If you leave Rowena high and dry during any part of this, I'll find you and I'll eat you - you've agreed and you're here, so stay here. You'll need to keep your strengths up while you're working - you absolutely cannot fuck up - so eat whatever you want in the fridge. Except the pie. If I come back and someone's eaten my pie, I'm gonna eat them. Lastly," Dean says, smiling in a way that shows the sharp point of his canines. "If I find any of you have been working with Lucifer, his witch, or
"Can Rowena do the spells from here? After she and the Coven have trapped the witch?" Sam asks, worrying at his bottom lip. "Or does she have to be in the room with him?"
(He decides to ignore the fact he's now called Castiel endearing and decides to blame it again on this world's Dean's feelings.)
One of them, a woman, tells Castiel rudely, "Your brother and your sister-in-law are dead. Your niece is alive. We will take you to see her, but then you have to leave."
Dean hums, and with a nod, replies, “Naomi and Bartholomew have been captured. Michael is optimistic.”
Claire nods before disappearing down the pathway to join her brother in the car. Dean turns back to Castiel and says, "So, Thanksgiving?"
Sam rolls his eyes so hard Dean thinks his eyeballs might pop from their sockets before he turns to Benny and says, "Hey man, you good?"
Castiel appears, bringing in empty beer bottles and glasses to refill, and Dean watches him put everything down before he holds his free hand out, clenches and unclenches his fist until Castiel figures out Dean's calling him forward. Dean slides his outstretched arm around Castiel's neck as he gets closer and leans forward to press a chaste kiss to his mouth. "Thanks for coming, both of you. It's been great."
Castiel frowns like he knows something is going unsaid, then pulls his hand away from Jack's head, laying it in his lap with the other. His lips twist thoughtfully and he squints at Dean like he's trying to figure the wolf out. "Why aren't you wearing a shirt?"
Dean gets in between Castiel’s thighs and taps the base of Castiel’s spine, a wordless command Castiel knows well. Castiel shuffles until his head is in a comfortable position so he can wriggle his arms down, crossing them over his back. This is one of Castiel’s favourite positions (it follows closely behind riding Dean and Dean pressing his face into a hard surface). It makes him feel boxed in, unable to move, and he loves it.
“We should go out on a hunt, send Jack up to heaven to do his thing, let them have some time alone,” Dean tells Castiel while they’re in the kitchen making popcorn. It’s the second movie night Sam and Rowena have missed to ‘practice magic’, Dean would enjoy it much more if Jack was off doing his own thing too.
," Castiel groans, spurting between them and over Dean's hand. He collapses onto Dean, trembling and mouthing at Dean's skin gently.
"What? Why?" Castiel's brow is pulled tight, and his eyes are sad, like he thinks Dean's about to tell him he doesn't feel the same. As if.
Dean’s eyebrow raises towards his hairline. He moves his hand away from Castiel’s throat, which he would whine about - really - if it hadn’t gone straight into his hair, pulling his head back roughly so Dean’s mouth can latch onto his skin.
First date chatter isn't exactly Dean's forte, he never really knows what to say in these situations, but he wants to know more about Castiel's work, so he says, "Tell me the weirdest dinosaur fact you know."
“Thin ice,” Castiel whispers slowly, reaching forward to scratch his nail along the free expanse of Dean’s back, below his tied arms. Dean makes a noise in the back of his throat and pulls at the rope again. Castiel scratches him again, with all of the nails of one hand, and Dean’s whole body shudders. “Good boy.”
The woman smiles. “Not a problem. I think everyone’s just glad you’re here. They’ve been doing their best, but this one’s a doozy, it requires different expertise.” She gives Dean and Castiel a loaded look like she’s trying to tell them something without needing to say it, but Dean just can’t figure out what it is. She laughs, rolls her eyes, and says, “Garth said you two were thick. So, double shot Americano and black English breakfast?”
Castiel and Sam have both been given guns as well, though they seem far more comfortable with them then Dean does, holstering them themselves. They both get shoulder holsters and Dean whines about not getting his own until Donna explains that because he's less familiar with using a gun, it'll be easier for him to reach it quicker on his thigh than under his arm.
"None taken," Castiel replies honestly, nodding his head. He's pretty much in agreement. This is quite possibly the stupidest thing he's ever done. "Is this the secret you guys have been keeping from me? Did you all know?"
Castiel stares into the fire and shrugs, hunching over and lifting his knees up so his feet are planted in the dirt. "I couldn't. Can’t. Not until nightfall."
The first tear slips through his closed eyelids and rolls down the side of his cheek, his breath hitching horribly.
"I'm not stealing the baby," Dean signs to her, trying to look as innocent as possible. He slides out of the room before she can reply, clutching his prize to his chest, cooing to her as he escapes to the kitchen. He settles on the window seat behind the kitchen table with her and toes off his shoes before kicking his legs up onto the seat, bending them at the knee and sitting her up against his thighs. She stares up at him with curious big brown eyes, and not for the first time, Dean is reminded of Sam as a baby. Her mouth pulls up into a gummy grin, and he tickles under her chin until she lets out a gurgled laugh.
"You and my brother," Sam says, prompting Castiel to speak, but Castiel doesn't know what Sam wants him to say. At Castiel's continued confusion, Sam rolls his eyes and goes on, "You've been touching each other a lot, y'know. Like, you touched each other a lot before, but it's been worse."
Claire lets out a breath through her nose and falls back into her chair, crossing her own arms. "No." She looks a bit like a petulant child, and for the first time Dean realises she's still so young. He's never asked how old she is, but at a guess, she's barely out of her teens, twenty-two or twenty-three. She's so young, and she kills people for a living.
"You're late," Charlie tells him, like he doesn't already know, her back to him while she leans over a huge pot on the stove that smells like Benny's special gumbo. "Benny ought to fire you."
"I swear to the gods, Lucifer, we don't have time for your devil schtick," Castiel sounds like a snotty younger brother (which Dean supposes he is) and Dean coughs into his fist to cover a laugh. "Who's been protecting her?"
Castiel nods and accepts the food, chewing on the corner while Dean sits back on his hands and stares into the fire.
this morning." Castiel copies the horrified look Patience had given Dean and the couch that morning and Dean bursts into helpless laughter, muffling it in Castiel's shoulder. "Exactly like that."
. Dean's done a lot of terrible things in his life, but the thought of disturbing someone's final rest is pretty fucking horrible.
“Put the cereal down, kiddo, let me cook you something,” Dean says, taking the cereal box from Jack and pulling him into a hug. When he pulls away he takes Jack’s face in his hands and studies him. “You look like shit, Jack. Don’t leave it so long next time.
"You alright there?" Dean replies, leaving his phone wallet and keys in the dish on the counter (on top of Benny's) and going to the refrigerator for a can of soda. He opens it and sets it on the counter without drinking any of it.
They all look absolutely terrified, even the oldest, though he’s trying to hide it behind a mask of bullshit and bravado.
when he gets home. Benny's going to rib the shit out of him. "So you speak five languages? That's pretty damn impressive, Cas."
A growl rumbles from deep in Dean's chest and he tightens his fingers around Castiel's thighs until he's sure they'll bruise, fucking his cock up into Castiel's slick, pliant body. His thrusts are hurried and rough, but Castiel doesn't seem to mind at all. Every time Dean's cock enters Castiel fully and knocks against his prostate the angel lets out a choked keen. Dean gets his mouth on Castiel's nipple, flicking his tongue and grazing his teeth over the hardened nub, and Castiel whimpers, digging his nails into Dean's shoulders. The sharp ache of it sends pleasure shooting through his veins like lightning, settling into his gut.
Dean nods his understanding. “I don’t blame you, I would’ve killed him too. The third and the fourth?”
"I know," Castiel says, and he looks rather smug, and far more human than he's looked in weeks. He's still flushed down to his chest and Dean sets a hand over his chest to feel the warmth of his skin. "I don't-" he doesn't finish what he's going to say, eyes shining angelic blue.
They break apart after a moment when Castiel's chest is tight with the need to breathe, and he falls back against the pillows, body heaving. He's just about to say something to Dean when Sam yells from the other room.
"I probably should've mentioned that she's a hugger," Dean says with a chuckle, watching Jo squeeze Castiel's head into her chest and kiss his hair. "Alright Jo, enough, don't smother him."
"You don't want Sam to go with you?" Rowena shakes her head, smiling benevolently at Dean. "If you change your mind before we do it, tell me." She nods. "Alright, everyone right with the plan?"
Dean hears Castiel's heart rate pick up and his breathing quicken before his eyes finally open, endlessly deep pools of blue staring back at him. "What happened?"
Dean knows he isn't in the cabin when he wakes because the bed's far more comfortable, Castiel isn't starfished next to him and he can smell bacon. He's back in the bunker, he can tell by the electric and magical hum in the air.
Dean wiggles his fingers before shaking his head no. “All good, I’ll tell you if there is.” He tilts his head so he can look behind him, smiling stupidly at Castiel. “Love you Cas.”
Then, one day, Dean comes out of his room wearing Castiel’s red hoodie. Castiel could brush it off, tell himself it just happened to land in Dean’s room, and Dean hadn’t realised it was Castiel’s, but it wouldn’t explain the other missing items. He doesn’t bring it up with Dean, though. Instead, he waits until Dean’s gone, off to the store to pick up bacon, whiskey, Sam’s granola and Eileen’s rum and raisin ice cream. When Dean’s out of the bunker, Castiel sneaks into his room, going in search of his things.
"So, you, Benny and my dad…" Dean was waiting for this, but he was sort of hoping he wouldn't have to be involved in the conversation. He shoots her a look and nods so she knows to continue. "Just so you know, it was pretty obvious, from the moment we got here. So, none of you are very good at keeping secrets."
Castiel shoots Dean a very intense look and says, "I trust my brother, Dean. He spent hundreds of years hiding from our brothers and sisters, I highly doubt he would have fallen in with Lucifer."
What worries Dean more is that they have to go back to Sioux Falls, despite the risks the Men of Letters still pose, just long enough to dig Bobby Singer out of his
Dean laughs, closing his eyes and laying his head over Castiel's shoulder. "It's required after these kinds of things. Go to sleep, baby."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, better now," Claire says, then leans forward to whisper something into Castiel's ear that Dean can't hear. When she pulls away, there's a look on Castiel's face, a quiet rage. Dean almost thinks he's contemplating murder.
Castiel noses along Dean's throat and hums against the skin under Dean's ear, sending a shiver down his spine. "I promise to be quiet."
It takes Castiel a second to realize Dean isn’t talking about going for a ride in the Impala, his head tilted to the side in confusion and his brow furrowed. When understanding does dawn on him he grins up at Dean. “Oh yes, I would like that.”
"Oh," Dean unscrews the cap from the bottle of whiskey and takes a swig, wiping stray droplets from his mouth with the back of his hand when he's done. He collapses onto the dirt next to Castiel again, pushing the heartache in his chest down. "Well, werewolves are like wolves, I guess. They - we - do live in packs, but most stay in the pack they were born in." Dean taps at his head, trying to figure out how to explain it. "Weres have secondary genders. Alphas are strong, the hunters and leaders; betas are level-headed, they usually deliberate on all the decisions and counsel the pack leader; and omegas, well, they birth the pups and are usually the ones that protect the pack when danger comes. Wolves are sort of different: they have one alpha, one omega, the rest are betas." Dean takes another gulp of whiskey and hands the bottle over to Castiel. He watches Castiel drink from the corner of his eye, trying to pretend he's not. "So, yeah, most werewolves my age would still be with the pack. Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, I'm the only one."
"Hey, have to go out for a bit, if you need anything Bobby's in the office. For the love of god do not do anything stupid," He warns them as he's taking his keys and wallet out of his locker. They both nod their understanding before getting back to work, Dean leaving them to it.
They reach Rowena's cabin in minutes, and unsurprisingly it remains empty, with no smoke billowing from the chimney. Castiel lands in the snow in front of Dean and hangs his head, no doubt discouraged. Dean bumps his muzzle into the raven's body again.
They haven’t managed anything more than a handful of handjobs and a couple rushed blowjobs since they arrived, too busy working on the case, so Dean’s going to take his time. They don’t have to leave for at least four hours, which is four hours they have completely to themselves, four hours Dean is going to take advantage of.
“Lucifer ganked him years ago.” Dean collapses into one of the folding lawn chairs set up around the burnt-out fire. “What the fuck are we gonna do, Cas?”
Dean comes first, fucking his hips up into Castiel as he moans the man’s name. Castiel continues riding Dean, and reaches down to stroke his cock until he comes too, dick spurting on Dean’s belly before he collapses on top of Dean.
Dean shakes his head, smiling, then says "Nah, hate flying. I go on a road trip every year though, a month of vacation time in April to visit car shows and eat terrible diner food and sleep in the back of Baby in the middle of fucking nowhere. Adam and Sam came the first time, then Adam for a few years when Sam was away at Stanford, then Sam for a few years, then it was just me for a while. Charlie came a couple times, and Bobby came once, right after the accident. Benny came this year and last year, and the year before that it was Benny, Charlie, Elizabeth, Sam, Eileen and Deanna. We didn't all fit in the Impala, we had to take Benny's beat up camper, too."
"Pretty simple summoning spell, some words in Enochian," Castiel replies, shrugging his shoulders and worrying at his bottom lip. "If everyone could keep my identity to themselves untilI choose to reveal it, I would appreciate it." A round of nods flow around the others in the room, including Dean, and once they've passed, Castiel nods himself. "Okay, then, here we go," He takes a breath and closes his eyes, whispering words in a language Dean has never heard and doesn't understand. "
“Unless their body has identified that person as a potential mate,” Sam finishes, sitting back down in the seat next to Eileen. “Dean has identified you as a potential mate. The temporary theft of that person’s belongings is fairly standard. I should’ve realised it earlier.”
Dean thinks about it for a second. He wants to be able to sit down afterwards and still feel it, but not enough that it makes sitting for long periods of time difficult or maybe impossible. “Two.”
Dean shakes his head. "Nah, my niece Deanna- yeah, I know, my brother thought he was being funny. Joke’s on him, she's my carbon copy. I have another niece, Mary, she's ten weeks, and a niece by association, Elizabeth, she's twenty. Benny, you know the big guy at the bar who looks like he fell out of nineteen-ten? His kid."
"No… well, yes. How did you know it was me?" Castiel asks, taking a seat on the edge of Dean's mattress, picking up the candy wrapper he finds hidden in the sheets. He rolls his eyes and stands up to put it in the trash can.
“What happened to you?” The angel asks, circling the coffee table and kneeling on the floor in front of Castiel. He reaches out to push Castiel’s hand away from the wound, lifting his shirt and carefully taking off the gauze. “What were you hunting? Your wound resembles a bite mark.”
Dean lets the wolf overtake him then. Bones and tendons shift under his skin, cracking with the force necessary to change their shape and knit back together. He lands on four paws, howling at the human in front of him, listening for the howl back from Sam that will tell him the others are still safe. Once he's heard it, he lunges at Bevell, bringing her to the floor with his paws pinning her down at her shoulders and her knees. He pants in her face, teeth bared, and enjoys the fear in her eyes a little more than is strictly necessary.
Castiel replies anyway. "Most likely because everyone was well aware that you were a baby gay and no one wanted you to closet yourself for fear of your mother's rejection. I don't mind, I'd rather it to another child living in fear of being who they are."
Krissy had pushed Aidan aside and is leaning over the hood of the car with a combination wrench. She pulls back and turns to Aidan, hissing, "It's not fucking rocket science, if you keep fucking up they're going to fire you."
Early the next morning, after Castiel has been so rudely awoken by sounds from Sam's bedroom (sounds he would rather not think about), he finds his way into the kitchen and starts the coffee machine. He still doesn't enjoy the taste of coffee, but he finds himself turning it on for Dean every morning before using the kettle to make himself tea. Tea, he likes.
"Can I hold him?" Patience begs, holding her hands together as she does so, eyes pleading. Dean rolls his eyes and snorts his amusement, but hands the baby over when he’s finished changing him. She holds him carefully, practiced like she’s done it before, and coos down at Jack, tickling under his chin.
It's something that's been going on for a while, even longer than Castiel can truly remember, but something that he's only just beginning to notice. He'd been far too busy in the last decade, but now, with Chuck and his Grace gone - for good this time - he's had the occasion to examine the exchanges the two of them have shared in the ten years they've known each other.
"I was thinking we should go get a drink together, hash this shit out, make sure we're all on the same page."
“That is strange. I’ll look into it, tell me if anything else goes missing,” Sam says, pulling his laptop closer to himself, distracted now that he has something to research.
Jo rolls her eyes and then turns her face to look at Castiel. "Oh, I'm a sucker for blue eyes. Are you single?"
"Okay," Dean says again, nodding his head and bringing his hand back to Castiel's body. He looks back at his phone for a moment, then flips open the cap on the bottle of lube and begins to pour it over his fingers. He has this look of absolute concentration on his face as he rubs his fingers together to smooth the slick over them, and Castiel finds himself unbearably endeared.
“Your boyfriend popped up in the bathroom while I was taking a piss,” Gabriel tells Castiel without looking at him, pulling the milk and butter from the fridge and setting them on the kitchen counter. Castiel looks back at Jack’s bowl of milk and tries not to snort. “As much as I like d-” Castiel cuts him off with a hissed noise and points at Jack. “Bananas, as much as I like bananas, I didn’t need to see his.”
Between Castiel's departure and noon, Dean replaces a battery, changes the oil of two cars, then watches Aidan while he replaces a fan belt, and then an entire set of tires. He eats with Aidan and Bobby, and doesn't leave until Krissy arrives, to take over for him. He promises to be back as soon as possible, the leaves, climbing into the Impala and driving home.
"I take absolutely everything back, you two are a bad combination, I'm moving to Bora Bora with Jo."
Kelly settles into one of the bar stools while Dean goes to the fridge peering inside. "We've got left over pasta, or some chicken - could make you a sandwich?" After Kelly decides on the pasta, Dean goes about heating it up for her.
They barely make it inside, and Dean's just set the bag carefully onto the floor, before Castiel is pushing Dean up against the door, slamming it shut behind him and claiming his mouth. Dean gets a hand in the angel's hair and pulls his face to the angle he wants it, so he can kiss him properly and get his tongue into Castiel's mouth. Castiel tastes amazing and Dean dives further in to chase the other man's tongue, pressing his hips against Castiel's. Dean slides his hands from Castiel's hair down to his hips and back up underneath his shirt to paw at his skin. Castiel groans when Dean lightly rakes his nails down his spine and his hips jerk up harshly, pressing into Dean's, making his skin prickle with arousal.
Dean's grin is bright and full of teeth, sharp like a wolf's and he says, "Much. Swap with me and lay back." Castiel almost falls off of the bed again as they swap positions, and he's laughing when he rests his head against the pillows, his arm flung over his eyes. Dean's laughing too, and when Castiel feels Dean brace himself above him with his hands on either side of Castiel's head he pulls his arms away. "You were an angel, how are you so clumsy? You're gonna brain yourself one day." Castiel doesn't understand the saying, and at his confusion Dean laughs again, presses his face into Castiel's neck. "Hit your head really hard."
While he sits in the Impala waiting for it to heat up and melt the thin layer of frost on the windows he checks his phone again, just for something to do. Benny hasn't replied, so he checks his Facebook, likes a new photo of Mary that Sam's posted, scrolls through the for sales in the classic car group he's in, then gets bored and shoves his phone into his back pocket. He reaches over to the glove box and finds the tape labelled
“Awesome idea,” Dean agrees, pulling Castiel down into a kiss. He licks into the man’s mouth, tastes the beer on his tongue, sliding his hands around Castiel’s waist.
Dean splays his hands out against Castiel's back and lets himself feel the muscle and bone under his skin. He traces Castiel's spine, and Castiel shivers, his muscles quivering like he's being tickled. So he does it again, just because he likes the way Castiel's body moves against him.
He checks Dean’s bedside drawers first, opening each briefly so he can see inside without breaching Dean’s privacy more than necessary. He checks under Dean’s bed, in the bureau, in the book cases, through the headboard’s shelves before finally moving over to Dean’s closet.
Rufus tilts his head and narrows his eyes. He would look intimidating if Dean hadn't seen him on Bobby's couch every Sunday for the last twenty years drunk as a skunk and crying like a big baby at literally everything. Dean loves Rufus like an uncle but god does he repress his emotions worse than Dean and his dad used to, combined. "He was in here this morning looking for the death certificate and a cause of death. He also wanted to know where your brother set up shop."
The first thing Castiel asks - before either of the archangels have spoken, their faces turned towards Rowena as if they thought she was the one that had summoned them - is "Where's Kelly?"
, which is just about the stupidest thing Dean's ever heard. It's fifty for the night and Dean hands most of what he has left over to the kid behind the counter (who looks barely out of diapers), with just enough left over for what they need from a grocery store. He's handed the key to room 8, and he takes it back out to Castiel who waited for him in the parking lot, grabbing his wrist and dragging him towards their hotel room.
"Dean, there are so many things that can go wrong with that plan," Sam shakes his head and falls into the couch against the wall across from the bed, where Dean and Castiel are sitting. Rowena perches on the arm of the chair next to him. "What if, for one, the baby can't break the warding?"
Castiel goes easily when Dean pulls him in, letting himself be led, his head moving into the right position so when their lips meet again there's no teeth and no pain. His lips are soft and gentle, carefully easing Castiel into something more with his tongue, sliding a hand around the back of Castiel's neck to hold him there (not that Castiel would ever go anywhere). Castiel holds onto Dean by his sides, fitting his hands around the curves of his hips, feeling the way the muscles bunch and jump under his shirt.
"You're probably bored of Lafitte's, huh? There's a place that does pizza and pasta in the next town over, that sound okay? And I'll pick you up at the B'n'B at six-thirty."
"I'll show you tomorrow, you can take a video if you need it." Claire grins brightly at him and thanks him. She gets a notification then, and Dean suspects her attention has waned so he turns to Jack. He's not sure what he was going to ask him, he hadn't figured it out yet, but he doesn't get a chance because Jack butts in.
“Nah man, where was it last?” He’s just gotten out of the shower, wearing an old ratty pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt Castiel is sure is Sam’s, towelling his hair dry. It’s gotten long - it curls around his face now and Castiel’s not sure if he should tell Dean how much he likes it, how good it looks, or if that would be crossing boundaries. Dean was always a stickler for boundaries, though he’s loosened up on them a lot in the last three years.
Dean attaches his mouth to Castiel's throat as his thrusts become more rapid and irregular, fucking into Castiel until he's come too. Castiel kisses him as he shudders through his orgasm, taking his face into his hand and holding him there. Castiel can feel the warmth of his semen filling the condom and his body clenches around Dean once more, his cock twitching as he wonders what it would be like without the condom in the way.
“I know,” Dean replies, nodding his head as he gives them a sympathetic smile. “You have each other. Was he all your dad? What happened?”
When Dean pulls away then, he looks far more awake, and nervous, swallowing thickly and hiding his face behind his mug. "I mean, I dunno man, some people are just like that."
He stands in the shower for what feels like hours, letting the spray wash over him, staring at the pattern of the tiles, tracing them over and over again until he feels like he's going crazy.
Castiel pulls something out from under his shirt and it takes Dean a second to realise what it is: two shiny gold wedding rings on a leather cord. Dean stares at them, dumbstruck, only looking back out the front window when the car swerves.
Dean's hand slides from where he'd left it on Castiel's thigh to grasp at Castiel's cock, jerking it to the time of his thrusts. "C'mon, baby, I want you to come."
"I have to leave tonight," Castiel replies frowning. "They want me back at work on Wednesday now that the car's fixed."
Castiel says something in Czech by Dean's ear, and the thumb of the hand around his cock strokes over his slit
Benny shoots Dean a look and he rolls his eyes in reply. "What is it, then?" Benny relays the order - a chicken burger with onion rings on the side - and he goes to the kitchen window to lean in and pester Charlie. "Hey big red, miss me?"
Castiel plants his hands on Dean’s chest and rides his cock fast and hard, head hung down between his shoulders, moans pouring from his mouth. He’s absolutely breathtaking, and as much as Dean is desperate to close his eyes and ride the pleasure, he keeps them open so he can watch Castiel. Castiel’s hips slow so he can grind down onto Dean, which grinds Dean onto the vibrator, and Dean loses his ability to breathe for a moment. He chokes on the spit in his mouth and heaves in a lungful of air, the output a long, high, drawn-out moan.
"Pelagonia, an hour west of Bitola," Castiel replies, eyes scanning the field. "There was a village here in 1056 that was destroyed by fire after it was ravaged by plague. The bodies were buried in a mass grave that hasn't yet been uncovered by archaeologists." He looks like he's concentrating really hard, probably to see if he can sense the bodies. He gives up eventually and dejectedly asks, "Can you smell the bodies?"
"Against the wall," Dean tells Castiel, pressing his back against the wall on one side next to the doorway before Castiel does the same on the other side. Expecting traps, Dean carefully reaches over to the door knob and twists it open, pushing the door in. Nothing happens, no explosions or gunshots or traps, so Dean nods once at Castiel and heads into the room.
“Please, daddy,” he whispers. Castiel’s eyes open and Dean stares up into them pleadingly. “Please do it.”
“Why aren’t they consuming the entire body?” Castiel asks in a whisper so quiet Dean almost misses it.
Benny's fingers dig harder into Dean's hips and he fucks his cock faster into Dean, deeper until Dean's prostate is so overstimulated he's sure if he took his hand away from his own dick he'd come just from that. It'd probably take him awhile, though, he's no spring chicken, and he really wants to come
Back in the bunker, after Dean has disappeared into his room for the night, Castiel sneaks through the hallway to the door of Sam and Eileen's bedroom. He knocks on it gently, worried about waking them, but also desperate for the answers to the questions burning in his mind, and whispers, "Sam, it's Castiel."
Dean flushes and looks down at his hands. He's still terrible with compliments that don't come during sex, and he's not really sure how to respond. He doesn't need to though, because at that moment, their waitress is placing the cheesy garlic bread and broccoli and cauliflower bake on their table with two side plates.
“Our dog. Stray one we adopted a year ago more or less, sleeps in Jack’s room so you’ll see her quite soon.”
“It’s over then,” says Dean, voice deep and broken, syllables that are all edges. “I’ve missed you.”
or anything like that out loud, softly, whispering it like a prayer again and again and again, his own idolatrous fancy exposed to the world. He had to accept it, not stoically but with some resignation, isn't that the moment they were always travelling to? It had to come. It would come, leaving nothing but memories of the shadows of the real thing behind, substitutions, the best next thing, a replica of something else - distant and unobtainable.
The period of adjustment had turned out to be longer than imagined and predicted: for the first couple of weeks after Castiel’s return from the Empty, they had refused to talk about or even mention what had occurred between them at the eleventh hour. Their minds, on the other hand, were filled with it, painfully reliving the same scene, wishing to re-enter the moment and do thing differently, do them right, bring justice. Words on the tip of his tongue, as they had always been. Three words that he wanted to speak with such emphasis and honesty as if he was the one to confess them first. He deserved it, the same way Castiel deserved to hear it said to him out loud like a reassuring exactitude, but the feeling of lightness and elation had been so overwhelming and the heartbreak so fresh that they had forgotten or pretended to have forgotten all about it - not that it mattered, even now. Choices were made every day, shaping lives, innumerable futures never coming to be, why should it have been any different?
Barefoot, his socks in his hand, he walks down the stairs following Dean. Wet footprints on the tiled floor and droplets of water still dripping from his coat. He says, “I’m making a mess.”
“I’m back,” yelled Dean as he dropped the shopping bags, placing them on the floor before taking his coat off. He folded it, the pure cotton Club Check lining on the inside revealed at the sudden movement of the boiled wool fabric. He added, “It’s pouring out there. That’s why I’m late.”
They had had the entire afternoon planned out for weeks, with new details added that very morning: they would have lunch and re-enter the moment they had so brusquely interrupted - Dean’s hands in Cas’s hair, Cas’s lips on his, bodies close, not wanting to leave - never that - but aware that they should get going, start their day. Late. They had been late. They’d see each other at lunch and would have had an hour and a half before Jack had to be picked up from school. Plenty of time. But then the telephone had rung and he had decided that he would cover for one of his co-workers, delaying their move to the next day. Perhaps he should have said no, for the sake of being honest and clear about wanting this, all of it, that it wasn’t about desperate attempts at delaying moving away from the bunker. The thought had wriggled in, later, as he browsed the aisles of the grocery store checking off the items from the weekly shopping list, stopping to pick up some white chocolate chip and raspberry cookies for Jack - cookies they could have after dinner.
"You know he will be alright, don't you? It was just a few ribs, possibly. You and him have both dealt with much w-"
Dean wasn’t going to deny him, however, and pulled to the side of the road next to a nature reserve. Castiel said thank you and then remained silent as he got out of the Impala and followed an unkempt trail. Dean followed closely. He also said nothing, feeling that doing so would ruin the atmosphere.
‘Some kind of sick joke, huh? Anyways I… I dunno if you’ll ever come back. But I want you to. God, I really do. I need you Cas. There’s so much shit I didn’t get to say. All kinds of things I was hoping we’d do now that Chuck is gone- fuck!’ He cursed himself, his voice audibly crackling with tears.
Castiel couldn’t stop seeing the way Dean had looked and spoke when he mentioned the tapes. It was so vulnerable, so much more than rare for Dean. It certainly piqued the angel’s interest. Gazing at the tapes, Castiel picked up the one which wasn’t labeled and examined it. Curiously, he put it into the radio and pressed play.
“No. In Hell you have a sense of where you are. In The Empty you’re nowhere and somewhere at the same time. It makes you feel insane. You’re supposed to be asleep, you can’t think about it then, but I was always awake.I knew someone needed me. I..” Castiel and Dean made eye contact. “I could hear you, Dean.”
the stuff. He attempted to send Sam on a punishment shopping trip only to remember his brother really wasn’t supposed to be moving around so much. So that left him to do the shopping. Of course, Cas could’ve gone too, but Dean hardly trusted him to buy anything good.
Castiel hadn't said that before, at least, not directly. The words felt right as they left his lips. They were the easiest way of saying what he had meant all along.
“Do you remember when- when The Empty came for me?” Castiel worded the question as delicately as he could.
Dean nodded, simply taking the information in. For once he wasn't overthinking something. "And then, what you said before...?"
‘You’ve already been gone for months!’ The sad tone quickly turned angry. Dean was frustrated with himself; he never understood why these types of things took him so long, and he hated it. But Castiel knew why it took him extra time, he always had, and he understood.
Dean dropped the boys off at the police department, hoping that the cops would get them to their mother. He had been driving safely (as much as he could anyway) until they reached the police station, but going to the hospital was a different type of situation. He sped the entire way, thinking only about Sam in the backseat.
“I don’t belong with the angels anymore. They’ll always be my brothers and sisters, but I belong with you,” Cas explained. Even
Dean was about to make a witty remark, but stopped to cover his eyes from a sudden blinding light. There was screaming, and then, silence. Dean blinked furiously, trying to see what had happened. All of the vampires were dead on the floor, not dead in a decapitation way, but dead in an angelic intervention way.
“Cas, there’s something else too, that I want you to see.” There was no excitement in his voice. Dean was on edge, yet completely serious; Cas could tell, so he nodded without any questions.
Upon opening the fridge, Cas noticed that its contents were more than just sad. The only things there were hot sauce, kale, and some beers. “Dean, there’s no bacon.”
There was a period of silence in the recording. Dean had likely been thinking about everything he had said, and Castiel was doing the same. He wondered if Dean really meant for him to hear this. He supposed there was nothing indicating he wasn’t meant to hear it. In fact, part of him felt that Dean had left it there on purpose.
Cas nodded. “I never understood your words, like you were too far away, but I knew it was you. The tone, the- the presence in my mind. It
Dean allowed himself a small smile. “It was nothing Cas,” he attempted to be humble. He had put all of this together for the angel he hadn’t been able to stop grieving, and now that angel was here to enjoy it. It was all he could ask for.
“Yeah?” Dean asked, barely able to say even that. He chewed his lip anxiously. He had wondered about this since Cas had died, but he never expected to get an answer.
Still, Castiel felt like these questions were worth it. He knew Dean had a difficult time processing, well, most things, but a tension had come between them that the angel couldn’t stand. It always hurt most when Dean and he weren’t on level ground.
The tape made a clicking noise; the recording was over. Castiel’s eyebrows were furrowed in thought. He listened to the tape again and again until he could smell coffee brewing in the morning. Though Cas was certain that coffee smelled different to him than to humans, he still liked the richness of it. He wasn’t sure how many times he had listened to Dean’s words.
Cas went along anyway though. He’d just come back, and Dean wasn’t ready to have the angel out of his sight for longer than necessary. They were actually on their way back to the bunker, groceries filling the Impala’s back seat.
“Sure. You knew what was in there a few months ago,” Dean stated as though it were a fact (which it was).
"Alright great," Dean smiled warily. He went back to help Cas carry Sam's weight. "Okay, first, all you gotta do is open the door. Gently, got it?"
Dean’s mood seemed to go down from there, but he still tried to be supportive and happy for Cas. Sam, on the other hand, was entirely amazed. He asked a lot of questions which Cas refused to answer. The angel wanted Heaven to be a surprise for them whenever it was that they got there.
It was almost possible to hear Sam roll his eyes as he sat down in front of the war room table, leaning his crutches against a chair. “Dean, he’s not going to care about your-!”
On the second day, Dean couldn't take much more of the awkwardness. Cas couldn't take it either, but he believed it was what Dean wanted, so he kept quiet. Curiosity and a bazillion other emotions had been biting at the hunter's heels ever since he saw Cas again.
