Tony waved him off.  “I’m fine.  Thank you.”  It was a lie, and it was obvious that Bruce knew it, but he nodded anyway.
“I know right where it’s stored, and I’d do it myself, but I need a lookout,” she said, the words so quick that they were almost running together.  “I know who will be working that night, and if you can just-”
“It doesn’t say anything on the sign,” Peter said, because he was Peter, and he hadn’t learned yet.  Nebula’s pen stilled on the page.  Peter blinked at her.  “There…  There is no sign.”
“They’re children, Jarvis, I’ve been blackmailed into letting a hundred filthy urchins ruin my house,” Toy said.  “And likely my life.”
“Anyway, he was locking every door in that kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the cabinets with the cutlery, just…  Everything.”  Clint went back to his pan, giving the contents a quick turn.  “And Stark waved a hand at the kitchen, said something pleasant sounding in French, and they all trooped back up the stairs.  First Miss Potts, then Jarvis, then Stark, and Rhodes last of all.  The door up to the house closed, and-” He snapped his fingers.  “Click.  One last key turning in one last lock.
“Very funny,” Harris said, but he was smiling as he piled pancakes onto his plate.  “So we have, what?  Costumes representing different facets of your personality?”
“At least someone told us what was happening, because you clearly weren’t interested,” Natasha said.  “Or at least, you were less interested in talking to us than you were in smashing things.  And getting smashed.”
Making deals with disembodied voices was not a good idea.  DJ knew this.  Things that couldn’t be seen couldn’t be trusted, and the voice was wrong.  It was…
Steve shifted his weight, his thumb still rubbing back and forth across the surface of the ring.  “Do you want me to?”
The song reached a rising crescendo, and Rhodey swung DJ down to the ground.  “Pick one with a red label this time,” he said with a grin, and DJ was off like a shot, scrambling across the workshop to the record player.
Tony slumped back onto the bed.  Right.  Good.  Any night that didn’t end with him throwing up in a trash can was a good night.  Because he had very low standards and his best friend was absolutely the worst.
Tony looked at Shiro.  “Both of them are cut off,” he said, folding the sheet of dough over into thirds. He reached for a knife.  “Both.  Nothing more for either of them.”
Steve looked up as Carol poked her head around the row of lockers.  “We all okay over here?” she asked, her hands braced on the ends of the towel around her neck.  “Need us to duck back out?”
“Forth one this mornin’,” the man said.  “The cook told us which ones he was expectin’, and thems got a list out at the gate.  If someone ain’t on it, they ain’t gettin’ in.”
For a second, everyone was still.  Then Bruce started shaking his head.  “Oh, no,” he said, holding up both hands like he could ward off the room at large.  “No.  Absolutely not.  I, I do not know what this is, but-”
“We take our leave of you here,” T’Challa said, pushing back his chair, “and rejoin the rest of the delegation.  Being seen in our company will only draw more attention to you.”
“Well,” Stephen Strange said, his fingers still wrapped around Steve’s arm in a deathgrip.  He was strangely pale, his dark eyes bright as he took a deep breath.  “That was monumentally stupid.”
“Shouldn't you be in the gym, waiting for dance lessons?” Jan asked, her hands on her hips.  She was dressed to the nines, her perfectly tailored sweatsuit matching the designer bag in her hand.
DJ shifted his weight, and Tony focused on him.  On this child, with his quick, constantly moving fingers, with his swinging feet and his disinterest in the neat stacks of china and rows of silverware set out in front of his chair.  Tony took a deep breath.  “I…  Do not have an answer to that question,” he said at last.
“Cap.” Sam reached out, one hand clasping Steve's shoulder.  “You've got about fifty pictures of a naked man with black hair and a goatee and even if it's not an exact match, yes.  You did that.”
“For the rest of his life?” Tony asked, glancing down at his phone.  So many goddamn texts.  He started deleting them.  “I believe you said?”
“Someone wanted me out,” Steve said, doing his best to keep his voice calm.  He shoved a hand through is hair.  “Someone paid a lot of money to get me away from-”  He stopped, not sure of the right words.  “Away from the house.  And whoever that is?”  He closed the back door of the car.  “I want them to know I’m back.”
“I’m not part of this,” Bruce said, his voice tense.  “Just as a reminder.  I-” He held up a hand.  “I am not a part of this.”
Ty slammed his hands down on the edge of Tony’s workbench, sending a stack of books crashing to the floor.  He didn’t seem to notice, or care.  “Another.  Failure,” he bit out. “Another useless, worthless-”
Tony blinked at him, his face pasty and strained.  “Sick,” he said, and Steve stroked his hair away from his damp forehead.
He jogged down the hallway, heading for the stairs.  Down below him, in the grand hall, he could see DJ and Peter standing in the middle of the floor, an array of buckets and mops surrounding them.  As Steve started down the stairs, he considered the sheer amount of water and soap suds that were scattered across the stone floor and wondered just how long they’d been at this.
“Fuck if I know,” Tony said.  “Probably Parker.  Parker has a strange amount of loyalty to me and a vested interest in me not looking like an asshole, or at least not a stupid asshole, so…”  He shrugged.  “Probably Parker.”
“So send Happy, he’s been here enough, he knows where to find me,” Steve said, his voice barely above a whisper.  “I’ve never seen a man so determined to put whatever Guardian Angel he’s got out of work.”
“And what do you intend to do about it?” Stark asked him.  “Throw yourself in front of the bullet?” He tossed the letter onto the pile, and turned back around, his hands on his hips, staring up at the ceiling.  The massive lighting fixture had been halfway removed, chunks of the metal frame and wires trailing down towards the table.  “I don't have time for this foolishness.  Jarvis, where is-”
Steve fell into step behind him, still a bit unnerved by the sound of his footsteps echoing in the cavernous great hall.  "I can just leave it with you," he offered, because it was worth a try.  "I'm sure Mr. Stark is busy."
“Has the ride been so bad?” Steve asked, and both of them gave him a look.  He nodded.  “It wasn’t my idea.”
The women running the stand were dishing out paper plates of heavy, dense fried dough, dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon, and piled high with syrup drenched fruit.  They were apparently well used to tourists; it took only a few gestures for him to collect a plate of steaming dough and rough chunks of apple.  The woman handed him his change and stuck a fork in the fruit with a practiced gesture.
“This is my punishment,” Tony said to the ceiling.  He shoved back the blankets, rolling to his feet.  “For all my sins, this is how I am humbled.”  He snagged his dressing gown from the foot of the bed and shrugged into it as he headed for the door.  “Because who can complain?”  Tying his robe shut with a sharp yank of his hands, he wrenched the door open.  “You are my penance and my punishment, all at once, you know that, don’t you?”
Harris leaned forward, peeking out of the kitchen door.  DJ was still flopped out on the floor, a box of breakfast cereal braced on his chest.  “DJ,” Harris called.  “How’s it going, buddy?”
Tony’s lips stilled on Steve’s, and he turned his head to the side.  DJ was standing over them, an oversized red hat pulled low over his forehead, his jacket trailing behind him from one hand.  Tony cleared his throat.  “Hi,” he said.
He held up his half-eaten sandwich like he was proposing a toast.  “You’re all insane,” he said.  “And you can stay here, being insane, and have a normal lunch.  Because nothing.  At all.  Will happen.”
Tony grinned.  "Aw, did I get married?  That's nice.  That's very nice."  Up in the cockpit, Steve's head snapped around, his eyes huge as he looked back at Tony.  Tony shook his head, giving him a reassuring smile.  "Really, I get murder threats for a marriage rumor?  Because you should be used to those."  He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to relax the tense muscles there.  "Hell, you used to be part of them."
“Well, a giant robot is trying to kill me, and I'm in a HOLE,” she said, and there was an edge of hysteria to that.  Not that Clint blamed her.
He was pretty sure she was laughing as he shot off after Shuri, Nomad’s hooves flying over the stones of the road.  Steve leaned forward, his body hugging tight to the arch of the horse’s neck, reveling in the speed as they shot down the straight length of the road, dust rising in clouds behind him.  Ahead of him, he could see Shuri, who was sitting straight upright in her saddle, her hands in the air.  “Hold your reins!” he yelled.
Bobbi gave Clint a look.  “I don't see why I should, get your own jar,” she said, but she tucked the spoon between his lips anyway.
“I promise nothing,” Tony said.  He dropped the test tube into the rack.  “Pep. Seriously.  Invite whoever you want.  You know the ratios we're looking for.”
“What are you wearing?” Steve repeated, digging through his closet.  A shirt slid off of a hanger, dropping to the floor, and he reached down to pick it up.
He shook his head.  “Anyway, he looked at Nat, who, again, still hanging off the side of the library shelves like a cobweb, and goes, ‘how nice of you to offer, but really, I’m all full up.  The only open job offer I have is for a chef.’”  Clint stopped.  “Offhand thing.  She’s gorgeous, and he flirts, just, you know, as a matter of course, smooth talk comes natural.”
It did feel good.  Now that the initial shock had worn off, it felt...  Nice.  Tony considered giving in, but Steve was smiling at him, his eyes bright, and Tony loved him so much it hurt.  "Vile, base betrayal."  He gave Steve a steely-eyed look, and took a deliberate sip of his coffee.  He stopped, his nose wrinkling.  "You ruined my coffee," he said.
Okoye’s head rolled in his direction, her eyes narrowed into slits.  “You,” she said, her voice full of doom.  “I blame you for all of this.”
Darcy was wearing a pair of grey coveralls, folded down at the hips, with the arms tied around her waist.  A faded Black Sabbath t-shirt clung to the curves of her breasts, and a pair of welding goggles were pushed back on her forehead, holding her bangs away from her face.  The rest of her hair was twisted up in a loose knot at the crown of her head, held in place with two pencils.  Smears of ‘grease’ had been artistically applied to her jawline and neck, and across her left shoulder.  The outfit was finished with a pair of steel toed work boots.
He looked up, squinting against the faint light, and Steve’s stomach iced over as he found himself staring, slack jawed and stupid, at Happy Hogan.  Happy, for his part, was still whistling a jaunty jig, high and bright, as he stumbled his way through the mob of men, patting arms and shoulders as he passed.
Clint was at the stove, an apron tied around his waist, and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows.  The air was heavy was the scent of garlic and onion, and fresh baked bread.  Clint glanced over as Steve walked in.  “Coffee’s on the hob,” he said, snagging a jar of some unidentified spice from a high shelf.  “Mrs. Parker’s made some fresh apple turnovers, they’re in the basket on the sideboard.”
“You just want my shirts for yourself, I know the truth here,” Clint said.  He grabbed a pair of scissors from the knife block and cut the powdered sugar open.  “Fine.  Take them both, if it’ll make him happy.”  He pointed the scissors in DJ’s direction.  “I know what you’re up to, though.”
She smiled.  “He wears it on a chain around his neck.”  Miriam tapped a finger against the neckline of her shirt.  “As long as it's kept under his clothes, it's much safer for him, and he's-”  She shrugged.  “He's a  bit of a romantic.”
Pepper's fingers brushed the line of his jaw, catching his chin and turning Tony's head back towards her.  “Hi,” she said, with a smile.  “Go ask Steve where he lives.”
DJ's face soured in an instant, and he ducked down behind the car, until just the top of his head was visible, big dark eyes peering along the edge of the metal.  Steve shook his head.  “We can still see you.  You know that, right?”
"No, it's fine."  Steve settled his cap in his lap, his hands resting on the brim.  "I've got a hard head, and a uniform hat that'll cover the lump."
Steve's mouth tipped up in a slight smile.  “I am,” he said, and Tony rolled his eyes, despite the rush of warmth that went through him at the words.  Steve nudged him with an elbow.  “You okay?”
“Vile temptress,” Pepper said, lowering herself into a chair and crossing her legs neatly in front of her.  She took the cup from Natasha.  “Stark.  We have a meeting in ten minutes.”
That startled a laugh out of Steve.  Tony gave him a look, doing his best to look hurt.  “No, really.  Look at this.”  He held up the book.  “Clearly, we have Pepper working on the ledgers.  Rhodey working on one of the cars.”  He flipped the pages.  “Mrs. Parker threatening Clint with a a set of measuring spoons.”
“You were sitting down,” she said.  “You were wearing a shirt, though.  So.  I have no reason to think that you WEREN’T wearing pants.”
“Right.  He loves you, too.” Tony folded his hands in front of him.  “So if you work for Olive Garden, you guys, you’re fine.  Your TGIFridays, your Applebees, your Outback Steakhouses, all of you, we’re good.  You’re fine.  I’m not talking to you.”  He sat up, his eyes wide.  “Okay?  Okay.”
“I mean, I haven’t decided what I’m doing, but for now, DJ is here and when I figure out what I’m doing, I’m sure I’ll let you know, but that’s something I have to decide on my own,” Tony said.  He scowled down at the empty spaces on the chessboard.  “Where the hell have the rooks gone?  Were they even here to begin with?”  He crouched down, peering under the billiard table.  “Do you see them?”
Clint smiled.  “He's hitting his teenage years, Steve.  It's...”  He rubbed the back of his neck, his head lolling forward.  “It's gonna be fun.”
Agatha nodded, her head swinging towards DJ.  “You set a trap for a monster and snared a wandering child instead.”
“A truth to be sure.”  Obie heaved himself to his feet and leaned forward, grabbing Tony’s shoulder.  “Stop this nonsense.  This old man’s heart can’t take the strain.”
He drained the last of his tea, too dark and too sweet, and set the leaves aside to reuse in the morning.  “Done?” he asked DJ, who'd finished almost everything.  DJ nodded, trading his plate with Steve's, and scooping up the cups.  “Thank you,” Steve said, finishing the scraps that DJ had left behind before handing over the plate.  “I'm going to go wash up, will you-”
“Yeah, ordinarily, I'd say that you're doing the right thing, that you're respecting another person's choices and boundaries,” Sam said. “But-”
“For the time being,” Tony said, spinning on his stool.  He tossed his soldering iron to the side, wincing as his fingers protested the movement.  “God, how long have I been at this?”
His head jerked up, and she was smiling at him now, amused.  Or not.  Her eyes were sharp as steel, the light catching her teeth as she took the tiniest bite of a cookie, and set the rest back on her plate.  She left no crumbs.  She chewed, slow and careful, and reached for her tea cup.  “Clever.  But not clever enough.” Her silver spoon tapped the side of her cup, once, twice, three times.  It made no noise.
“I will have you know that I’m the absolute soul of discretion,” Tony told her.  “Any secrets you may have heard from me are my own, and that just makes them funny, self-depreciating stories.”
Obie coughed, his head falling forward.  His cheeks were flushed, his eyes bright.  “Don’t you judge me, boy,” he said with a smile, refilling his glass.  The aspirin tin clicked against the decanter, and he tossed it aside.
As they pulled up in front of house, Bobbi leaned forward, bracing one arm on the back of the seat in front of her.  “I’ll put it in the garage.”
“I don’t allow analog solutions in my vicinity, if you’re going to do that, you’re going to have to do it somewhere else, somewhere where I’m not,” he said.
“And he can juggle, can we stop it with the Parent Trap nonsense now?” Tony snapped at both of them.  “And which one of you belongs here?”
He plodded forward, trying to ignore the exhaustion that tugged at him.  “That…  Might’ve been too much,” he mumbled, and his tongue felt heavy in his mouth.  He shook his head, trying to get his blood back where it belonged.  He didn’t want to stay here.  He didn’t want to spend any time here, that he didn’t have to spend.  He took another step, and the world seemed to tip sideways.  Tony sucked in a breath.  “That…  Was too much.”
“Tell me a secret,” Tony said, and he didn’t know where the words came from, or even what they meant, not really. But they were out before he could stop them, and Steve was pulling back, his expression confused.
“Right,” Tony said, rubbing his forehead.  “She, and her cake, can come down to the workshop.  She knows where it is.  She was here yesterday.”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “That's not a 'type,'” he said, trying to sound stern.  “That's having sense.”
"This is what I'm saying," Tony said, considering his fruit salad as DJ stole one of his sugar cubes.  "I'm thinking you didn't feed anyone in this household other than me, Jarvis."
The sound of his breathing was very loud in the sudden silence, and he looked up to find Tony standing on the second floor landing, staring down at him, a faintly puzzled look on his face.  “Leave it,” he said, and Steve’s skin iced over in an instant.  “It’s where it belongs.”
“You might be proud, I’m not-so-secretly terrified,” Tony said.  He rolled halfway over so he could squint at Steve.  “You’re usually up by now.”
“In a box,” DJ explained.  “When dad was moving.  I was...  Damaged.” His toes flexed against the floor.  “And new.  I had been packed up.  And the box was, it was lost.” The words came out faster than he'd expected, as if he'd been practicing without realizing it.  “I waited, until my battery ran down.  Then, I went to sleep.”
"Mostly, but Mr. Fletcher down at the shop left a bit of meat on there for you."  Steve smiled at her as he headed up the narrow, rickety stairs of the tenement.  "Think he's sweet on you."
“Yeah, me, too, but that’s what happens when you cleverly design your menu around supposed aphrodisiacs,” Tony said.  He wrapped an arm around Peter’s shoulder.  “What’s our assignment?”
Tony pushed away from the workbench, snagging his phone as he went. "This sounds like an actual conversation that you have had."
She stared at him, her expression torn between amusement and dismay.  “Thank you so much for your restraint, Mr. Stark.”
He regretted the words, almost before they were out of his mouth, but Tony nodded.  “I do, actually,” he said.  “And was trying to find a socially acceptable way to demand it.”
He shook his head.  “Look, I just-”  He shook his head. “Fine.  Okay.  I'm sleep deprived and you are stubborn, I know this because you're still married to Reed when a sane or easily dissuaded woman would've filed for divorce years ago, so-”
“She shot in my direction, it was more a distraction than an actual murder attempt.”  Rogers stared at him, and Tony smiled.  “Don't worry.  She apologized.”  He paused.  “Well, no, she didn't, actually, but I'm sure she meant to.”
“Steve?” Sam's voice echoed out from the penthouse, and Steve was very grateful for the interruption.
Pepper watched this, her face full of consternation.  “I-”  Her eyes closed.  She reached for her purse, snapping it open with a flick of her fingers.  “Parker.”
“While I appreciate your dedication to your duty,” Tony said from between clenched teeth, “I do believe that I can manage.”  He arched his eyebrows. “Thank you.”
She fell silent for a moment.  She reached for the basket, picking an apple seemingly at random.  “They came, in the morning, the shift supervisor and the overseer, to tell me that he was dead.”  A muscle in her jaw twitched.  “Shot.”
“Don’t get us wrong, Cap, we love you,” she said, leaning her head on his shoulder.  “But you’re not a good choice for love advice.”
She sighed.  “This wee one’s teething,” she said, rubbing the baby’s round cheek with one finger.  He turned towards the touch, his mouth working, and she made a soft, gentle sound at him, exhausted and loving by equal parts.  Mrs. O’Malley looked up at Steve, a thin smile tugging at her lips.  “He cries less if we move a bit, and I figured the neighbors deserved a few moments peace, the walls as thin as they are.”
“That sounds great, but-” Peter sucked in a breath.  “Bruce sent me.  Tony's sick, and he's not, uh-” He rubbed a hand on the back of his neck.  “He's not listening to reason?”
“Of course, sir.  Don’t worry.  I know just how to enlarge the recipe to make sure there’s enough for two.”
“This as fast as this thing can go?” he said, and his voice sounded husky and raw, even to his own ears.  He grinned, heat rushing through him.  “Impress me, Rogers.”
He pushed himself up, his arms shaking, and he stared down at the unfamiliar shirt he wearing.  It took him a couple of tries to read the writing, upside down as it appeared to him.  'New York Original: Made in Brooklyn.'
Rogers continued to move, stiff and more than a little awkward, his jaw set in a stubborn line.  "I do all right for myself," he said, and it was such a transparent lie that Tony struggled not to laugh.
At the front of the room, they stopped, and Trip turned off the music with the punch of a button.  She waited until Darcy and DJ had settled down beside Harris before she turned to Steve and Tony.  She smiled, and Steve smiled back, his hand still clasped firmly in Tony’s.
An instant later, he was home, and he wrenched his hand free from another set of stones, another symbol another burning glow.  He stumbled backwards, his head spinning, his eyes focused on his arm.  The blue light flickered and died, leaving black lines in its wake.
Steve  looked past him.  There, at the foot of the bed, DJ was curled into a loose ball of limbs around Furbro, one bare foot trailing across the quilt, and one hand resting gently on Furbro’s flank.  The cat was purring, a low sustained rumble, and DJ was snoring along with him.
Tony stopped.  "You...  Want to talk to Steve?” he asked, confused.  “Because this is Tony.  Remember me?  I'm the one with the dark hair and the bad attitude?  Shorter and less...  Heroic than Steve, but much shinier?”
The door to one of the back rooms opened and Clint walked out, still in the process of fastening his pants.  As everyone looked in his direction, he wobbled his way across the floor.  “Thanks for the quickie.”
“Phil got.  I thought we expelled you.”  Tony ducked around him and strode into the room, his hands tucked in his pockets, his head tipped to the side.  He was smiling, but there was a tension around his mouth, around his eyes.  “Didn’t we?  I distinctly remember-”  He pointed a finger at Harris as he passed.  Behind him, Sitwell closed the conference room door.  “This is your fault.  Don’t think that it isn’t.  Absolutely your fault, you were given the defective product and a valid receipt and you were sent to make a return.”
"What is this, a press release?" Rhodey said, and Steve choked on a laugh.  Stark gave him a look, and Steve coughed into his fist, trying to pretend that he was still focused on his book.  He didn't think Stark was falling for it, but it was worth a try.
“Thank you for helping,” Steve told him, pushing DJ’s hair back.  “Did you have fun shopping with Jarvis and Mrs. Parker?”  DJ nodded with a great deal of enthusiasm.  “Did you and Peter pick out presents for everyone?  All the boys from Hammer’s place?”
“I have no interest in your orders, and as I said, I have no interest in hosting any occupying force,” Tony said, refolding the pages.  He flicked them towards the front door, the gesture disdainful and dismissive. “If you insist upon waiting, you may do so outside.”
“I kind of think it is,” Steve said, smoothing his hair back.  His hand might've been shaking.  He chose to ignore that.  “I've never asked anyone to dance.”
“That she is.” The young man tucked the bill into his pocket.  “Is there anything else we can do for you, Mr. Stark?”
And then he was gone.  Pepper stared after him, and then turned to stare at Tony.  “That was shameless.”
“Yes,” May said, her arms tightening.  “You’ve mentioned that.”  The hug went on forever, for so long that when she finally let go, Tony could swear he could feel the imprint of it against his skin, a bruise that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to shake.  May took a step back, and she wasn’t crying, but her eyes were bright with unshed tears.  “He admires you a great deal, you know.”
DJ nodded, and on the other side of the massive mahogany desk, Tony grinned down at his paperwork.  “He's honest, I like that.”
"I don't object to the story being told, I object to it being told without the express permission of the person it's being written about," she said.
“Oh, I absolutely know.”  Steve shook his head.  “Can you please-” He stopped, the words caught behind his teeth, and he focused on his breathing for a moment.  “We need to consider all options at this point.”
"Is there anything you regret, from this little escapade of yours?" Joy asked. She seemed glad that the conversation had turned from legal matters and journalistic ethics. Steve wasn't sure if he was or not.
No.  Yes.  He wasn’t sure.  He didn’t know if he could.  He didn’t know if he wanted to.  But his father sat there, chewing, his eyes level, waiting.  Waiting for DJ to make up his mind.  Waiting for him to decide
“He’s lying, I know he’s lying, he’s-” Peter’s hands flexed at his sides, and his knuckles were raw and cracked.  “He doesn’t want me to feel back, because he knows it’s my fault DJ’s gone, it’s-”
There was a pause.  “Sir appears to be having a slight crisis,” Jarvis said at last.  “I suspect intervention may be necessary.”
The Tony Stark that wasn’t his Tony Stark (and Harris hated the thought of having a Tony Stark in any way, shape or form) took a loud sip from his coffee cup.  “Appears to be a constant,” he said.  “Though I’d say my assholeary is more warrented right now.  Since I’m at a magic convention, in a universe that isn’t my own, with no current way to get my kid home, and no one, from Stephen Strange on down, has chosen to give me warning about any of this.”
“That's when I even HAVE a point,” Tony said, nodding.  “Are you certain that Reed needs us on this one?”  He turned his head back towards the holographic schematic that was floating at eye level in front of him.  “We're booked up right now, very busy, it's hard for-”
“Tempting, but, kinda defeats the purpose of paying people a fair wage, wouldn’t you think?” Tony drained the last of his water.  “I remain a man of the people.  Even while drunk.”
“Yeah, and Tony was joking with, I think it was Carol?  And he was a mess, just like everyone else, and he pulled the hem of his t-shirt up to wipe his face, and-”
"You are good like that,” Steve agreed, tossing the rest of the trash.  “You can make it up to me by coming over on Friday morning and help me fix my color problems.”  He grinned at Sam, cheerful about his manipulation.
Bucky did not seem concerned.  “Yeah, I'd, I'd be worried about that, except your partner's a real soft touch, and everyone else thinks I'm cute.”
“Well, to be fair to him,” Miss Potts said, starting to close her ledgers.  “He doesn't think he needs sleep either.  So he's just holding us to his own rather insane standards.”
“No.  DJ’s armor is built to be invisible.  Fast.  Maneuverable.  But mostly?  It’s built to be utterly invisible.”  He gave DJ a smile.  “It’s an escape route, more than anything.  If it all goes pear shaped, he will get out, completely unnoticed.”  His hands were warm.  Comforting.  “Get out in the desert, and he can fly.  No one will ever know he was there.”
“TRADITION,” Jan said, slapping her hands on the table, and the mistletoe bounced in place, ringing gently as it settled back against the wood.
Tony kissed him, hard and fast, and Steve leaned into it.   When they broke apart, Tony leaned his forehead against Steve’s, his eyes closed, concentrating on the feeling of Steve’s breath against his lips.  “I’m scared,” he admitted, the words thin and soft, and Steve kissed him.
For the first time, the words seemed to sink in for Steve, his eyes blinking.  “Your place,” he corrected, his fingertips dipping beneath the waistband of Tony's pants, his rough fingertips coaxing Tony closer.  “Mine is all the way out in Brooklyn and yours is-”  He sucked in a slow, heavy breath, and he was a mess already, his hair tumbled over his forehead, his shirt askew.  “Yours is right there.”
“You're a pain in my ass, you know that?”  His eyes closed.  “The two of you.  Pains.  In.  My.  Ass.”
“They couldn’t take care of him then, and that is a shame,” he said.  “I’m not going to judge them for leaving him where he’d at least be warm and fed, however poorly.  They did what they had to do.  They probably did what they thought was best for him.”
DJ snapped back to reality, so quickly that it made him dizzy.  His hands jerked back, and this time, when his tea cup went tumbling to the ground, no one seemed to notice.  Wanda looked over her shoulder at Agatha, her chin up.  “It’s not her.”
Steve reached for his napkin.  "No," he repeated, snapping the fabric out and spreading it onto his lap.  "No.  I'm done.  I'm done with all of it, and I've already ordered, and I'm going to sit here, and eat a very expensive meal, and I'm damn well going to enjoy it."
Steve tugged him down to sit on his lap.  “Also a surprising amount of sex,” he mumbled into Tony's shoulder, his ears red.
Tony paused, looking back down at the hall, where the two of them were sitting, silhouetted against the flames.  DJ was leaning against Steve’s side, and as Tony watched, Steve smoothed a hand over DJ’s hair, soft and gentle.  “And she always told me, never go down beneath the hill.  Never walk paths not meant for your feet.  Never let your name be whispered, by voices who tempt you to follow them down.  Down.  Down."
Steve considered that.  “My ma was from the old country,” he said at last.  He shifted in his seat, a bit wary.  “Ireland.  She talked a lot about the old ways of doing things, the old-” He shrugged.  “She was a good Catholic girl, Miss Potts, but some things die hard, in the spaces religion doesn't reach.
Hank straightened up, shoving his shock of blonde hair out of his eyes with one hand.  “You don’t know that.”
“Yeah,” she said.  She straightened up, and braced her hands on the table between them.  Her fingers, stained blue from the ink of her pen, stood out in stark contrast to the white paper.  “I did.  You know why?”
The elevator doors opened and they both froze.  Clea stepped out, her head swinging from one side to the other.  Her hair seemed to be a beat behind, hanging in soft, cloudlike formations in her wake.  Tony knew the moment she spotted them, her face lighting up.  “Hello, Tony!” she said, taking a light, floating step forward.  Her feet seemed to skim just an inch or two above the ground, barely making contact.  She balanced a plate between her hands, light playing off the mirror glaze that coated the perfectly shaped cake.  It had a strange sort of sparkle to it; Tony hoped it was just edible glitter.
"You think you're kidding," Tony mumbled.  “But I know.  I know I'm doomed.  He'll make my life a living hell.  He can do that.  He will do that.”
“Recipe that Hitomi gave me,” Tony said, sweeping the onions into a pile.  “I’m trying to learn some of DJ’s favorites.  This is a chicken an vegetable, well, it’s a stew of sorts,” he said.  “In creamy white sauce.  So it’s pretty much custom made for a small person who prefers his food comforting and familiar.”  He waved a hand in Steve’s direction.  “Or my difficult supertaster.”
Memory crashed over Steve like a wave, knocking the breath out of him, and he jerked upright, his free hand fumbling at the sides of his bed.  "Jessica!  Is she-"
There was a moment of silence, and then Tony appeared in the bathroom door.  His shirtsleeves were rolled up to his elbows, his vest unbuttoned, his jacket long since abandoned.  He leaned a shoulder against the doorframe, his arms crossed over his chest, a faint, amused smile on his face.  “Jarvis just ran that for you.”
Sue blinked, thrown for a moment, then she realized he wasn't talking to her.  She turned, following his gaze, and yes, that absolutely was a little boy standing right next to her.
“Of course,” Tony said, because it was cute that Steve thought that was going to happen.  Steve scowled at him, his eyes narrowing, and Tony tipped his chin towards the door.  “That little redhead’s trying to steal one of the flower vases.”
“Okay, what do we want for this thing?  Egg rolls, spring rolls, scallion pancakes, those chicken or beef teriyaki things, you know, on the sticks?” Jess said, circling things with abandon.  “What else?”
"In my defense, I assumed I was going to leave him to take the fall for it," Natasha said.  She cracked eggs into the bowl, one after another, separating the shells with deft, easy movements.  "I'm still quite disappointed that he managed to take me down with him."
Steve turned back towards the couch, a glass of water in one hand and a bottle of pills in the other.  “Tony.”
Everyone looked at Peter.  He nodded.  “Oh.  Yeah.  That…”  He slurped up a noodle.  “That makes more sense.”
Steve offered him the carton of egg foo young, and Tony took it, pleased.  “This is setting a bad precedent,” he said.  “You know what I like and I am going to fail utterly at remembering what you like, so the next time I do the ordering we're going to end up with something you hate, and that'll be the end of this.”
“At least someone around here is capable of doing their job,” Tony said to DJ, who nodded.  Tony's lips twitched.  “You're filthy.”
Some minor warnings for a slight, passing discussion of homophobia, it is rebuffed in the same scene, but I like to mention for things like that.  Also so romantic relationship fights.
Tony was slumped low in his chair, his eyes wet as he held up his hands.  "'Marriage necessary to escape clutches of evil dictator,'" he said.  "Great headline.  Let's run with it."  His head rolled to the side, his eyes locking on Steve's.  "We're both idiots, you know that, right?"
“Your place,” Tony said, wrenching the front door open, taking the stone stairs two or three at a time.  “Where else would he go?”
“Of course it is.” Steve shook his head.  “So that’s Bruce, and that makes the mother sauces the person who told you you could leave.  The only one who went with you when you left Big Star.”
Steve shook his head. “You need to get dressed so we can go upstairs.” He tipped Tony's head up, brushing a kiss against his lips. “You promised to fulfill my fantasies. And I've got a major one about you. And your bedroom.”
Jan gave him a narrow eyed look. “Jarvis, make it stop,” she said, tossing herself on the couch.  “This whole display is unnatural and frankly quite terrifying.”
The kitchen door opened.  “Dinner will be served in fifteen minutes,” Jarvis announced.  “For anyone-”  He cleared his throat.  “And everyone who needs to freshen up.”
"I admire your honesty.  I admire it enough to give you some of my fruit," Tony told him.  He pushed himself upright, groaning as he slumped back against the headboard, trying to find a comfortable spot that didn't involve any contact with the cat, who was now chewing on one of its back feet with single minded determination.  "Actually, you can have everything you want.  Just give me the coffee."
DJ blinked at him, and darted around the desk towards them.  He crouched down next to the desk, his back braced against the wood, a solid silver candlestick clutched in his hands.  Tony stared at him.  “What're you-”
Steve smiled down at her.  “No,” he said, and leaned forward to press a kiss on her forehead.  “Stay out of my closet, Jan.”
Tony spared the bakery bag a curious look.  It looked like the real thing, good solid bread from a good solid Italian bakery. “Not going to turn that down,” he said, laying out the table.  “Did you grab a bottle of wine?”
“You're fired,” Stark muttered, turning back to the light fixture, the rod thrown easily over his shoulder.
Steve winced.  “I don't think he's feeling 100% this morning,” he said.  “I'm going to make him some oatmeal and toast, see if that helps.”
Tony switched his betrayal to the horrible child who was undermining him.  He kept staring, his eyes narrowed, until the thermometer beeped.  He pulled it out.  “We've just met, this is...  This is...  Unacceptable.”
Steve’s head dipped, the movement slow, almost lazy.  Right before their lips met, Harris was pretty sure he heard him say, “Yes.”
Tony flipped through the book, his fingers stroking over the edges of the pages.  Steve hadn't been its first owner.  There were pale, almost invisible pencil stroked marking passages here and there.  They were hesitant, cautious, as if the person who'd made them had been afraid of getting caught doing it.  A tiny heart, smaller than his pinkie fingernail, had been sketched against one margin, and he smiled down at it.
“See, you do understand how this house is supposed to run.”  Tony tapped his pen against the stack of pages.  “He was talking crazy, by the way, and I don’t appreciate it.  Has there been gossip below stairs?  Are you gossiping?”  Jarvis gave him a pitying look, and Tony made a face.  “I have rules.”
“I don't think so,” Ellen said. She offered a hand. “Ellen Ning. New York Now magazine.” She nodded at Jesse, who was fiddling with her camera. “This is Jesse Delgado.”
He didn’t go far.  Just to the bottom of the stairs.  DJ hadn’t moved; he was still lying on the grass, staring silently up at the sky.  Behind Steve, the lights of the house spilled out over the staircase, and he could still hear the faint sound of the music.  Steve sank down onto the stairs, caught between the calm of the rolling lawn and the chaotic, welcoming embrace of the house.
“Your hair’s sticking up all over,” Tony said, crossing back to the bed.  “You look like a dandelion about to go to seed.  Come here.”  Without thinking, he reached out, smoothing Steve’s hair down with a gentle hand.
Steve handed them over, and Tony headed for the lounge, Sam right behind him.  Even as the kitchen door shut behind them, Steve could still hear them bickering with each other, and he smiled to himself.  A minute later, a roll of paper towels tucked under one arm, he followed them to the lounge.
“Excuse me?” Steve said, but Jess put a gentle hand on his shoulder and brushed a kiss against his cheek.  He gave her a side-eye.  “You’re trouble.”
He tapped his fingers on the side of the chair.  “But we bought this stuff when you were small, and we bought stuff we thought you would like, more than you picking it.  You're getting bigger.  And you're outgrowing some of your stuff.  So you can think about if you want to change it, if you want to get something you can grow into, rather than, you know, squeezing yourself into something that doesn't fit anymore.”
“No.” She reached out, pushing his hair back from his forehead.  Her fingers were rough, scarred from decades of hard work, but her touch was gentle.  “No, they shouldn’t.”  She leaned over, kissing him on top of the head.  “And best you remember that.”
“You’re not coming to Vegas,” Tony told him.  “I’m getting my jet back from Pepper, I’m putting the kid, and his baby-sitter onto it, and we’re going to get this done without any more complications.”
He'd been in the penthouse before; they all had.  Most of it was open floor plan, the kitchen at the center, with dining room and living room space forming a half circle around it.  Off of that were the media room, a library of sorts, a laundry room that looked unused, a few guest bedrooms, and the master suite.
He smiled, and pulled his hand back, a smooth, easy gesture, and the mechanism let out a rusty clatter, then the rope wrenched free, tumbling through the gears.  Tony, still holding it in one hand, dropped like a rock, his boot kicking free of the wall with a clatter of stones.

“I wasn't trying to hide the fact,” Pepper said, her voice tart.  To Jan, she said, “Please?  I could use some conversation that doesn't center around motor oil.”
Darcy patted him on the back.  “I’m not sure if smothering yourself with a high end hotel pillow is really the best solution to this problem, babe.”
“Damn him, and damn you,” Ty said, stabbing a finger in Tony’s direction. “We’re not finished with this discussion, you and I.”
Pepper sipped her lemonade.  “Oh, God, no, he's far worse than Tony when he gets going.”  She smiled.  “But he does like to think of himself as the responsible one.”
Steve let his eyes drift shut.  “Okay, but if you don't do the voices, I'm going to be very disappointed in you, Sam.”
“Professional decorating crew is coming in 48 hours before the start of the party,” Jan said.  “Which brings to me to my next point.”  She turned around, collecting a box from her chair and putting it on the table.  “I want mistletoe.”
“No,” Steve said, laughter stuttering off into a chuckle.  “I can barely put in a good word for myself.”  He looked at Sam.  “But I brought that up, because I was…  I was okay with that.  You know?  Nothing I can do about my dreams, about my subconscious.  And I could keep that to myself, I could handle that.
Steve held up the wooden spoon, his hand cradled under it to catch any drips.  "Try this," he said, and Tony opened his mouth without even thinking about it.
“We are-  We are just not good at lying, why does anyone believe a word that we say?” Stark said, pressing a hand to his face.  “Okay.  Right.  Look.  I was just checking.”
“Because I’m more than willing to fight Hammer, and the city, and the state, if it comes down to it,” Tony said.   “I don’t…  I don’t know if I’m willing to fight you.”
“I think we owe Officer Rogers more of a thank you than the Almighty,” Tony said.  “Where's Natasha?”
“Instead he found Peter,” Steve agreed.  “And I think Peter is all he found.  He doesn’t have DJ, and I doubt he can tell us who does.  He’s probably still on the grounds, and if we wait him out, or shake everyone down, we can find him.
“I don't know where that came from, honestly.  I panicked.  I was acting on instinct, and as we all know, most of my instincts involve weapons, and firing them wildly at the threat.  Lacking missiles, I find all sorts of other ways to destroy my life,” Tony said.  “Also, did you miss the part where we're married?”  He shoved a hand through his hair, disordering the strands.  “Because that's  the important part.  Right?  The part where I MARRIED HIM?”
DJ was hopping in circles around them, his feet bouncing from square to square on the marble floor.  “No.”
“I know.” DJ shifted in his seat to look back over his shoulder.  His backpack was still on seat behind them.  Satisfied, he looked forward again.
“There's more than one stray in the neighborhood,” Pepper said.  She gave him a smile.  “Steve.  Go back to bed.”
"I don't think there's any 'we' involved here," Rhodey said, sitting down.  "I think that's her way of telling you that you talk too much."
Gyrich squared his shoulders, reaching up to straighten his tie.  To his credit, his hands were steady, despite the way that the Hulk was staring at him, his face set in a scowl.  “I'll talk to you, too, Banner.  Soon enough.”
Jarvis smiled.  “Thank you, Miss Potts.”  To Tony, he added, “Sir, if you might come with me, please?”
Tony stared at him, his stomach sinking.   “Okay.”  He pushed himself upright.  “If you could give us a few minutes to discuss this?”
“Uh-huh,” Tony held a loaf of whole wheat bread at shoulder level.  “Am I replacing the punching bag again?”
“Fine.” His lips went tight, a thin, hard line.   “Here’s a question, Steve.  Would you have arrested Rhodey and Pepper for their marriage?”
Trip stifled a laugh.  “Thirty-two,” she said.  “And I am never doing that again, honey, it was, to forgive a term, a certified clusterfuck.”
Sue weighed her options, sensing the minefield all around her, even if she had no idea where the particular explosives were.  She'd navigated similar fields before, and the easiest way to deal with them was to sidestep them completely.  "It's not just education, Tony," she said, folding her arms over her chest.  "There's socialization."
He folded his hands on his stomach.  “I spent my entire life running yours.  I wasted years, decades, keeping you on a short leash and humoring you.  I built this company for your father, and ran it for you, and you think I'm going to let you ruin everything for a random filthy street urchin you took a liking to?”
“Thank you,” Steve said, with all due gravity.  He pulled another Coke out of his pocket, balancing it on his knee.  “That might be the food.”
“The premiums, my brother pays,” Thor said, grinning ear to ear.  “Since the last two increases were most certainly his fault, we decided it was best if he were responsible for them.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “I’m sure he’ll have something to say about the bills, but I have little interest in listening.:
Bruce was still working, his hands fast and steady, the movements practiced, almost unconscious.  “You need to go home.”
“Might’ve been you,” Tony said, his fingers smoothing Steve’s hair down.  Steve raised his head, just far enough to meet his eyes.  Tony was smiling at him, slight and warm.  “Don’t know if anyone’s ever told you, but you’re kind of an ass sometimes.”
Tony made a show of checking his watch. “You're going to miss the show at this rate,” he pointed out.
She leaned back in her chair, rocking it back on the casters.  “I mean, it’s pretty important to a lot of people,” she said with a smile.  “I’m just…” She looked at the display of reusable bridal bouquets, something which most people would’ve considered tacky.  She’d always liked it, though.  The flowers never faded, silk petals holding their shape and color year after year.  More permanent than some of the marriages they’d blessed.
Tony sucked in a breath.  “You're going to be fine,” he said, and he was certain of that.  That was a rock solid certainty.  He'd make sure of that.  “And if the serum stops working, well, then, guess we'll finally get a day off, Steve.” He went back to stroking Steve's hair, because Steve didn't seem to mind the contact.  “We'll get a van and drive across the country.  Looking for America.  Or, if that's too hard to find, just a good fried chicken joint.”
“We went to Mjolnir,” Rhodey said, rubbing his temples.  “That’s where we met Clint and Natahsa.  Fury and Phil were there, too, and, uh, Maria?”
“He’d attempt to fix this and in doing so, make it so much worse,” Rhodey said, shaking his head.  “He’s persuasive.  But this is not a situation that requires persuasion.” He rocked back on his heels as Steve climbed to his feet, collecting his bags and throwing his wrapped shield over his shoulder before he held his hand out to DJ.  For a instant, he stilled, looking back over his shoulder at the second floor, and Rhodey sighed.  “Divide and conquer?”
The water in the vase sloshed as he grabbed it, and the roses vibrated with every step he took back towards Tony, shivering in his grip, and he tried not to think of that, tried not think of any of it and then he was back at the front door, and Sam was there, but Sam had seen him do worse, Sam had absolutely seen him do worse and not said a word, he could do this he could do this he could do this.
In the kitchen, Steve was standing at the stove, wearing a battered pair of blue SHIELD sweatpants and a white t-shirt that clung to his shoulders like a second skin.  There was a simple white apron tied around his waist, and his feet were bare against the tile floor.  As Tony watched, his heart in his throat, Steve lifted the lid of a pot, leaning over to take a cautious sniff of the steam that curled above the gleaming copper rim.
Ellen juggled her bag and phone, managing to get a hand free. "Probably back at the coffee shop," she said, grinning. "Hey, have you seen Jesse?"
“I know.” Tony tossed his tablet aside and pushed himself upright.  “Want me to lower myself to manually typing things on your behalf?”
"We'll be fine," Steve said, wrapping his arm snuggly around Tony's waist.  He tucked Tony up close to his side, and started muscling him towards the door.  "I'll keep you updated."
Tony turned around in his pew.  DJ was at the rear of the chapel, a stack of flower crowns balanced precariously on his head.  Behind him, two Doctor Stranges stood shoulder to shoulder, mirror images of one another.  As Tony watched, DJ crouched down, and the cat hopped off of the podium, padding its way back up the length of the aisle.  As it proceeded, tail held high, SHIELD agents gave way, stepping out of the cat’s way and letting it pass.  DJ extended a hand, his fingers curled into his palm, and the cat rubbed against his knuckles.
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Steve said, reaching for his fork.  But his face was flushed, his breathing a little uneven.  He scooped up a bit of the ganache, swirling it through the blueberries before slipping it between his lips.
Steve let his eyes drift shut, strangely at peace here, despite his aching head, despite the things that he wanted that he was never going to have.  "As drunks go, you're a pretty harmless one."
Before the words were fully out of his moth, Phil interrupted him, repeating, “Where’s Stark?” his voice tense and crisp.
“Yes, but that was when I thought I was going to die alone, young and beautiful, and was in an all fired rush to spend it all before my inevitable demise,” Tony pointed out.  “Now I have a child to provide for.  A wide variety of superheroes to take care of.  I have a very spendthrift lover.  My milk expenditures alone are through the roof.”
Steve looked at his hand.  This was a bad idea.  This was the worst idea he’d ever had.  He had no place here.  He had no place with this man, in this house, in this world.  And every moment that passed, it was harder to remember that.  Harder to focus on the fact that this was temporary, this was a dream.
“Take this,” Pepper said, putting both of her hands on Steve’s back and pushing him in May’s direction.  “I’ve bigger problems to deal with.”
“And trust me, I can hear the comments already.  ‘Oh my kid is picky.  My kid only wants hot dogs.  I’m not paying for real food for my kid he won’t eat it.’  Fuck.”  Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “Do you know how easy it is to make a kid happy?  Even a picky kid?” he asked.  “Kids like control.  Kids like to feel like they can choose.  Why the fuck do you think fucking Lunchables is a thing?  Everything in a Lunchable is trash!  Everything!”  His voice rose to a dangerous pitch.  “But kids love them!  Because they get to choose!”
Rhodey smiled.  “All of his tattoos are, well, to put it bluntly, once you know the code, they might as well be names.”  He took a sip of his coffee.  “Yours is, well, it’s a bit more obvious than most, but every thing he’s gotten, they’re all people.”
“Communication.  That's why this relationship works,” Tony said, banking hard around the corner of a building.  Hulk was still ahead of them, taking the city in great leaps.  Tony couldn't go as fast as he wanted, not with Steve clinging to his side, but Hulk was clearly not making any effort to shake them.  "Jay?  Can you warn the bratbot that he's going to get a guest real soon?"
“I'm a benevolent overlord,” Tony said, sneaking a bite of Pepper's strudel.  She smacked at his fingertips, making him laugh.
Steve couldn’t think about it.  Wouldn’t allow himself to even listen.  “You love him.”  He was sure of that, somehow, and it was easier to say than anything else that was racing through his head.
“I'm a proponent of making allowances for who people are,” Steve said, his voice flat.  “This city only works if we accept that we're not the same, we're never going to be fully the same.  Things that are fair aren't always equal, and things that are equal aren't always fair.”  He gave a slight shrug.  “And things work better if we just give people a stool rather than arguing that they could reach if they really wanted to.”
There was a beat of silence, and then Pepper shifted, leaning up against his side, her head tucked against his shoulder.  “Do you want out?” she asked, her voice quiet, and the thought was so shattering that for a long moment, he couldn't think, couldn't speak, couldn't breathe.
“It depends, I suppose, on if my mother is currently in a car headed in this direction,” Phil said, and he absolutely wasn’t smiling.  “Fully armed and with nothing to lose.”
“Yeah, but the Protestants just don’t have suffering down to an art the way the Catholics do,” Tony mused.  Steve gave him a look, and Tony smiled.  “You know I’m right.”
“Yes,” Stephen said.  Strange said something under his breath in a language DJ didn’t recognize.  Stephen gave him a look, responding back in what sounded like the same dialect.  For a moment, the two of them mumbled at each other, getting more animated with each exchange.
“You loooooooove me,” Darcy said, as agents in combat gear and crisp black suits moved around her.  She didn’t seem to notice.  Harris put a gentle hand in the middle of her back, nudging her towards the line at the register.  “Wait, hey, I didn’t-”
“This is going to blow your mind,” Sue interrupted, “but I know where you can find a couple of kids.  Ones just about his size.”  Tony looked at her, his face creasing in confusion, and Sue let out a sigh.  “You do remember I have children, don't you, Tony?”
“Go back to sleep, Steve,” Tony said, burrowing down into the pillows.  A moment later, he was still, his breathing smoothing out into a slow, easy rhythm.  But his fingers were still tangled in Steve’s, his calloused fingertips rough against Steve’s skin.
Phil studied him, wondering why every warning sense in his brain was going off at the same time..  Clint seemed to be waiting for a response, and he sighed.  “Feel free.”
Steve reached for Tony's hand, trying to pry his shirt free of Tony's grip.  But even asleep, he held on, his fingers locked tight.  After a moment, he gave up, raising Tony's hand to his mouth.  He brushed a delicate kiss across Tony's knuckles, his lips lingering against the warmth of his skin.
Another soft, pained moan.  "I think that was rocket fuel, actually."  Very carefully, Tony moved his head, just far enough to peek at Steve with one bloodshot eye.  "Where are we?"
The color leeched out of his Bruce's face.  “No,” he repeated, but it had taken on a desperate note.  “Jane, that was-”
“Well, it did just happen, so yeah, it can happen, but probably more to me than you,” Clint said.  “Close your eyes.”
The smile was a reflex, smooth and practiced.  Tony turned towards the photographer who'd asked the question, giving the asshole his best side.  “Yeah.  Sleep and alcohol,” he said, setting off a wave of laughter.  He flicked a quick salute at the press gathered outside of the SHIELD building.  “I've got a date with about six different versions of 'A Christmas Carol' and a very comfortable couch.”
Tony slapped both hands against his face.  “I know.  I'm getting up.”  He took a deep breath, and pushed himself into a sitting position.  His back ached, his shoulders ached, his head ached.  “Under duress.  I want it noted.  Under extreme duress.”
"She doesn't care about the show, she just likes watching Jan work herself into a rage about it."  He shook his head.  "There's Luke's 'Antiques Roadshow' and Clint's stupid cartoon movies and Bruce has recorded every single episode of 'Mysteries at the Museum.'"  He scraped his hand over his face.  "Natasha's Bollywood musicals and Jessica's 90's rom-coms-"
“Right.” Steve set off across the parking lot at a quick lope, his feet chewing up the distance in a controlled rush.
“Fine.  Wake me when it's afternoon,” Tony said, throwing an arm over his eyes.  “Or evening.  Or possibly tomorrow.”
The words were like a shot of adrenaline, straight to the basest part of his brain.  Tony sucked in a long, slow breath, trying to ignore the sudden spike of arousal that curled through him.  There was something wrong with him, he'd always known that, but he was pretty certain that the combination of that voice and those words were going to haunt his dreams in the best possible way in the days to come.
DJ sniffed, scrubbing his the back of his wrist over his nose.  “Yes,” he said, the word almost inaudible.
“Never known you to do things by half measure, so I’m gonna believe that,” Bucky said, reaching for his mug.  “So you’ve got a hut…”
“Someone is coming for you.  As soon as they can.  We love you, we won't forget you.”  Tony leaned in, pressing a kiss to DJ's hair.  “Someone is always going to come for you, Deej.  Always.  As long as someone's still out there, we're going to find you.  I promise.”
Tony arched up, his lips brushing against the exposed line of Steve's throat, and Steve made a sound that didn't even seem human.  Tony laughed, low and dangerous, as Steve jerked backwards, almost tripping over his own feet.  Tony was grinning at him, his eyes bright, and Steve realized he'd clapped a hand to his neck, his fingers clinging to the skin that Tony's lips had touched.
“Look, I came into this late, but I’m going to say, ‘a lot.’” A pause.  “What do you think, Jess?  ‘A lot?’”
The boy nodded.  "What-"  He stopped, then forged ahead, the words tripping forward, tangled together.  "What was that like?"
Tony stood, his glass cradled in his palm.  “You were there.  You saw the end.  You saw what was left of Europe.”  His chin came up.  “Do you think that war is over?”
“The irrigation system on the lower fields has been acting up,” Tony said.  “It’s not drawing the way it should.  And with harvest coming up fast-”
Pepper glanced around.  "The-  Oh, DJ?"  Everything fell into place.  "Ah, so that's what pried you out of the workshop while the sun was still out.  You brought-"
“It would explain how he slipped away without any of them seeing,” Strange said.  “DJ wouldn’t be capable of something like that, it’s too complex to confuse this many people, but someone else-”
He handed over his credit card.  “You can,” he said, and his voice seemed to echo in the small space.  He licked his lips.  “If you want to.”
“There’s an emergency reset,” Rogers said, his voice quiet.  “If he gets too close to the ground, the armor reinitiates.”
“Such an unpleasant word.  I resent it.” Stark leaned over, his fingers closing on the fabric of his robe, and Steve watched him, mesmerized by the play of muscle and bone beneath his golden skin.   Stark straightened up, tossing the robe over one shoulder.  “I'll dress and meet you in the usual spot.”
Halfway through filling the filter with grounds, the doorbell chimed, and he tossed the pot into place.  “That was a quick ten minutes,” he mumbled, but headed for the door.  “Did you run?” he asked, throwing the door open and coming to a dead stop.
"A couple of the boys, they slipped out at night an' went all the way cross town to find Rogers, an' they told him what was happening, best they could, I suppose.  But when the fella came by the next morning to sign the paperwork an' pick up Mick, Rogers was waiting for him." The boy's teeth flashed in a smile that was sharp and hard and vicious.  "Ain't none of us knows what was said, Miss, but Rogers put the fear of the good Lord into that one.  None of us ever saw him round these parts again."
“And the con chair of this particular gathering.  So you know me, but I don’t know you.” Agatha stacked her hands on the top of her cane.  “I have come to realize I most likely owe you an apology, young one.” She smiled, and it softened the lines of her face.  “But I need to know what is happening, before I know just how large of one.”
“Stark's bi, you know he is,” Ellen said.  “He's had relationships with other men before, not as public, not as-”
Steve gave him a look over the rim of the tub, and Tony’s lips twitched.  “How do you pack so much disapproval into a single look?  I’ve dealt with priests and politicians who would envy your ability to shrivel the heart of a sinner with a single glance.  It’s rather impressive, I don’t know-”
“Apparently you are.”  Iron Man spread his hands wide.  “Don’t know what you expect.  Just imagine-” He gestured at the faceplate of his helmet.  “You’ve seen my pissed off face often enough, should be burned into your memory by now.  Use your imagination, Cap, and just assume that I’m really goddamn angry at you, and fill in the blanks.  You’re a smart man, most of the time, you know, when you’re not doing something monumentally fucking stupid, you’re pretty smart, so maybe you can-”
Some tension that Steve hadn’t even been aware of bled out of his shoulders.  He took a deep breath, and let it out.  “He’s fine,” he said.
“You fired everyone else,” Happy called after him, which was rank insubordination, and Tony absolutely wasn’t going to stand for it.
"I can't do this, I can't-" He shoved himself away the workbench, his whole body a live wire of frustration.  He wanted to blow something up, he wanted to punch something, he wanted to get out.  Instead, he picked up a wrench, bouncing it back and forth between his palms.  "Pepper.  You've seen what they're doing with my tech, I can't, I just-"  He huffed out a breath, his shoulders flexing with the force of it.  "I can't."
“Nothing excuses what he did,” Jarvis said.  “Nothing makes it right.  No one is required to forgive him.  But I do believe that he regretted what he did, as much as he was capable of regretting anything.  And knowing I was watching him?  I truly believe it helped him not to repeat that mistake.”
"There's no-" Ellen shoved her hand through her hair, and immediately regretted it.  "There's no winning!  We're not in this to 'win,' Jesse.  We're in this to tell the truth, and there's no winning or losing to that, there's only the hard facts and the reality of the situation, and we are obligated to report that accurately and impassively!"  On the other side of her cube wall, Al stood up, giving her a narrow eyed look over the top of his bifocals.  "I'm going!" she said.
“I’m not-” Steve scraped a hand over his face.  “No, seriously, I’ll pay for this, it’s my fault, I’ll-”
"And I'm not holding it against you, you'll notice I'm involving you in phase two, go get the paper," Stark said.  Peter stared at him, and Stark made a shooing motion.  "Paper.  String.  Glue.  We're burning daylight here, Parker."
Sam opened his mouth.  Closed it with a sigh.  "You want me to-" He waved a hand at the door, his eyebrows arched.  "Deal with this?"
"I also know," Sam said, giving him a flat look, "that I did what needed to be done today, instead of what I wanted to do, and I was able to do that, because I knew that you-" He flicked a finger in Tony's direction.  "Were here.  With him."  He settled back in the chair, his head tipped slightly to the side, his dark eyes steady.  "I trusted that you could handle this."
Her shoulders flexed as she leaned forward, the muscles bunching under the thin straps of her tank top.  “Because you’ve sent me the same design nine.  Damn.  Times.”  She bit off each word with a particular sort of violence, her teeth cutting into the syllables.  “Nine times.  In two months.  Every time you get frustrated, or drunk, or depressed, ping!” She snapped her fingers in front of his face.  “I get an email with the same design.”
Steve took a breath.  And another.  There was blood on the pavement, dark spots smeared by dozens of panicked feet.  But Steve could smell it, metallic and clangy, he could nearly taste it in the back of his throat.
Tony stopped, turning back to face her.  “Pep,” he said, his voice gentle.  “I want you to think back over your entire life, right back to your earliest times in trying to make friends.  When you were a tiny, adorable-”
Clint smirked up at him.  “Don’t know if you’ve met Phil,” he said, folding his hands on the flat of his stomach.  “Tall guy.  Lanky.  Would be banned from a poker convention for having zero tells of any sort?  Might not have a pulse?  Had to reveal he was still alive with a memo that ended up going viral amongst several governmental agencies?” His eyebrows arched.  “You’re asking what will happen when your ex-girlfriend and current CEO asks about his wild time in Vegas?  Let’s just say that I’m not real concerned about his ability to make up a cover story on the fly, Tony.”
“Yeah, yeah, find a couch and sit quietly, I have work to do,” he said.  “Oh.”  He turned away, crossing to the fridge next to the workbench.  “Hank McCoy sent me his newest find.”
Tony blinked at him, big dark eyes gleaming in the low light. “Hi,” he said, his lips twitching. “We had sex in the car.”
“Yes, of course.”  Strange smiled at him, and DJ smiled back.  “We have a visitor today, but I think-”
“I’m fine,” Tony said, holding up a hand.  “Jarvis.  It’s fine, let him be.”  Jarvis gave him a look, but he stepped aside.
DJ gave his clock a longing look, his fingers plucking a gear.  His eyes darted from Tony to Rogers and back, his face strained.  Tony shook his head, and reached for a rag.  "Don't worry, my small assistant, I won't play with it while you're gone.  I'll leave it right there, and you can come back to it when you're done frolicking through nature."
Tony smacked his fingers lightly with the pliers.  "Hold still, you're of no use if you're shaking the whole structure, so-”
Jarvis arched an eyebrow.  “And are we discussing things that we were absolutely instructed not to discuss?” he asked, his voice brisk.
She made a moue of displeasure.  "Rude," she said.  Her manicured fingers rattled against the front of the tablet.  "Don't you want to know why I want them?"
“There wouldn't need to be a cleanup if your people hadn't gotten involved,” Gyrich said.  “You destroyed government property, and interfered with a sanctioned operation.”
Steve nodded, doing his best to look disappointed. “I would, but it'd mean my job if I'm caught in a bar when I should be watching you.”
Steve threw his hands in the air.  “Fine.  If it will help,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  He headed for the kitchen, dusting his hands on his legs.  He heard Bucky chuckle and reached out, smacking him on the back of the head as he passed.  “Ass.”
“Offer received and soundly rejected,” Tony said.  “Look, that’s-”  He huffed out a breath  He was tired and not hiding it well.  “That’s not what I want, Steve.”
Tony sorted them out, making neat stacks on the table and on the floor next to his chair.  'The Greatest Ballpark Ever: Ebbets Field and the Story of the Brooklyn Dodgers.'  'Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.'  'City of Dreams: The 400-Year History of Immigrant New York.'  Under that, he found half a dozen battered fantasy novels, JRR Tolkien and Terry Brooks and Robin Hobb, and a couple of faded spy novels, a Bond book missing half its cover and a Tom Clancy volume big enough to serve as a doorstop.
She braced a hand on her hip, her head tipped to the side.  “We are, which is why I know you have a big mouth.”
"Hey, now, don't-” That was as far as Luke got before a wave of eager assistants crashed up against him, tape measures snapping through the air.
Jess put the empty plate back in reach.  “I’m going to die,” she said.  “But I’m going to die happy.”  On the stool next to her, Carol was munching her way through a pile of rice and toppings, her eyes half closed. “Thank god I’m not paying for all this.”
“Then I call dibs.  They’re mine now.”  Clint grabbed a gallon of milk, a pack of string cheese, a salami, and a bag of baby carrots.  “In fact, I’m calling dibs now.  In case this becomes less hypothetical in the near future.  If I open this fridge, and there’s egg rolls-”  He met their eyes, one after another, and tucked a carrot between his teeth like a cigarette.  “Dibs.”
DJ looked down at his bare feet, and wiggled his toes.  He looked back up. "No," he said, and it was so obviously a lie that Pepper had to struggle not to laugh.
She considered that.  "Validation, mostly."  She nodded.  "Hope.  It's hard, when you're constantly bombarded by the message that you don't belong, that there's something wrong with you, that you'll never be happy." She stopped, turning to face him.  "That you'll never be safe."
“Yeah, you told me all right,” he said.  He pushed himself upright.  “In my defense-”  He paused.  “Atlantic City.”
He made to move past her, and Pepper caught his arm.  “He’s in a foul mood, Tony,” she said, her mouth tight.  She scrubbed at his cheek, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  “You’re a mess.”
He wanted to shake Rogers’ hand off of his arm, and he couldn’t manage it, and he hated himself for needing that support.  But it took all the effort he could muster just to keep his heart beating as a form, close enough now to be visible, to be familiar, shot towards DJ’s falling form.
“At the time, it seemed like a really sick burn,” Clint said.  He nodded.  “That might’ve been the alcohol talking, though.”
“Because maybe you're right, and it's time to start asking questions,” Tony said, shifting the tray in his hands.  “But I'll be damned if I do it blind.”
“He loved her, I think,” Tony said.  As much as his father could love anyone or anything. He shook off the thought.  “So her family got a large influx of cash, my father got half ownership of a winery, and a wife, and my mother got-”  Tony waved a hand at the fountain, and the house behind it.  “All of this.”
Steve nodded.  “Doctor?  There was no way I wasn’t going to catch hell for this.  I knew that the moment I walked through that portal.”
The kitchen door opened and Jess leaned in.  “Hey, Greer’s up.”  She grinned at Bruce as she passed, Carol right behind her.  “Heya, Doc.”
Steve shrugged, fishing through the cartons until he found the one he wanted.  “Pepper seemed a bit worried when you pulled a disappearing act after the meeting.  I think she expected you to come back after you blew off a little steam.”
“I'll...  Bookmark that.”  He shook his head.  “But we both know that there's always been rumors about those two, Ning.  I mean, there's always rumors about all of them, you get that many people together under one roof and the public's sure someone's doing the deed.”
Jarvis smiled.  “He’s right as rain, tucked in warm and safe.”  He shut the door behind Steve, setting the locks with brisk efficiency.  “He was concerned about you.”
"Long enough for you to get your tongue stuck in the neck of the bottle, and then laugh yourself almost to tears about that once you got yourself free," Steve said, grinning.  Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Alcoholic battery acid, Tony."
“Going,” he said, ignoring the way that every deep breath hurt.  Too many times.  He realized that his hand was fisted over his breastbone, the fabric of his shirt tangled in his fingers.  As if that could keep anyone else from seeing.  From knowing what was happening.
The liquid was pale and golden and hollow down to the depths, far, far deeper than the cup that held it, so deep that he couldn’t see the bottom, so deep that he didn’t even know if there WAS a bottom.  It never stopped, it never got darker, it just went on, forever.
“Right,” he said to no one in particular.  He squared his shoulders.  “Right.  Time to do just that.”
Clea smiled.  “I know it does not count for much, but I love your child as well.”  She held out a hand.  “If you cannot protect him, I will.  I swear it.”
“Deal.”  DJ popped an orange gumdrop into his mouth, savoring the spicy-sweet crunch of the sugar coating.
“I don't know, but you'll be doing it on the street tonight,” Tony told him.  Not waiting for a reply, he stomped back towards the living room.
“Hi,” Steve said.  He didn’t smile back, and he didn’t let go of Tony’s hand either, tangling their fingers together instead.  “I thought I should offer.”
He didn't bother to lift his head at Pepper's voice. He heard the door shut, and the familiar sound of her heels. “I can't do this,” he said. “I know it's not fair. I know it's cruel. But Pep. I can't do this anymore. I can't-”
“Sweet mother, how have you not learned to recognize an ex-soldier?  There are enough of them in this damn city,” Tony said.  He looked back at the window, a nervous twitch of a movement.  “The way he stood, the way he moved, the way he kept his head moving?  He was a soldier.”
“A large part of the population experiences erotic or sexual dreams,” Sam said.  “Other people don’t.  We’re all wired a bit differently, Steve, but either way, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Well, an army does march on its stomach,” she said, pushing the basket of potatoes across the counter to his seat.  “Put the peels in a pile on the cutting board, Bruce'll want them for the garden.”  She headed back into the pantry, returning with a bin of flour and another in sugar, a tin of baking power balanced on top of the pile.  She set them down beside a mixing bowl and reached for a measuring cup.
Tony took a deep breath, his fingers squeezing hers.  “Then we shall take back what is yours by right.”
“I ate my weight in pastry, thanks, even for me, that’s enough for the day.” He still hated this website, but Tony’s presence made things better.  Tony’s presence always made things better.
“Nothing,” she grumbled.  Tony gave her a look, and she made a face.  “No.  Literally nothing.  I’m fairly certain he’s forgotten that I exist again.”
“I think he’s done for the night,” Steve said, even as DJ latched onto Tony’s shirt with one hand, pulling himself a little closer.
Steve was still grinning at him as he took the cup out of Tony's hand.  "I'll buy you another one," he said, taking a sip.  He looked down at it, his face considering.  "A little watery."
Clint yawned, his face scrunching up with the force of it.  “Fuck you,” he said, rubbing a hand through his hair.  “And anyway-” He stopped, and looked down at his boxers.  His toes wiggled against the carpet.  He looked up.  “Fuck you,” he repeated at last.
“Yeah, but it’s mostly food, isn’t it?” Steve asked, his fingers tapping against his coffee cup.  “Sure, it’s not my name, but this is the first one that’s just-”  His voice trailed away.
“Hospital?” Happy tossed the boy sitting on the hood of the car a silver dollar.  The kid snagged it from midair with a grin, hopping down.  “Thanks for keeping an eye on things, buddy.”
She tried to swallow and it was like trying to swallow a baseball whole, her throat closed up, her breathing hitched. "I outed you," she repeated, her teeth clipping the words. "You..." Her lips went tight. "I printed that you were in a relationship, and you had never confirmed that, let alone defined your sexual orientation. I outed you."
“And I am instantly not the most immature person in this room,” Peter said, squaring his shoulders.  “I am… Not the most immature.”
"Maybe," Steve said.  He crossed his arms.  "I think I prefer being an idiot with you than being smart on my own, though."
“She's terrifying and I'm finding I'm okay with that,” he said.  He looked down at the napkin wrapped bundle.  “Wonder if she likes cream puffs.”
It was always going to end this way.  Steve had known, from the beginning, that it was always going to end this way.
Ellen stared.  “Is that-”  Her head snapped up, so fast that she ended up swaying in place, her head spinning.  “Is that STEVE ROGERS?”
“Of course, sir.  My only concern is your well being and safety, not to mention your happiness,” Jarvis said, and if Tony could’ve gotten a hand free, he would’ve thrown a pillow at him.  “Do ring if you need more coffee, I should be happy to return with another pot once you’ve-”  His eyebrows rose and fell, a slight, puckish smile on his face.  “Handled your breakfast.”
Bucky slumped low in his chair, legs thrown out in front of him.  “Right,” he said, cradling his bowl in one hand.  He sounded gleeful.  “Storytime.”
“I think you should take your gloves off and have some breakfast,” Tony said, because Harris looked like he was going to have a stroke.  “Monique bought those off of one of the maintenance crew.”  He reached for an empty coffee cup.  “You can have clean boots, but no one’d believe a welder with clean gloves.”
Now, she studied Tony as she stacked up plates.  “Go wash up,” she said, hefting a tray of dishes with well-practiced speed.  “You’re a right mess.”
Laughing, Steve headed out after Bucky.  “I’ll leave you to your plotting,” he said.  “But if he disappears, I’m going to have to go find him again.”  Behind him, Sam groaned, and Steve hid his smile, breaking into a jog until he caught up with Bucky.  “Do you know where you’re going?”
Steve made an inarticulate sound, pressing his face deeper into his pillow.  Whatever it was, someone else could handle it.  All he wanted to do was sleep.
“I think-” Justin said, and that was more than Tony had expected to hear from him tonight, but Ty cut him off.
But his ears were his ears, and he hadn’t closed the door, and in the bedroom, he could still hear Tony talking.  “Want to tell me what’s happening in that remarkable head of yours, kid?”
“Dummy, I’m going to need you to change the sign,” Tony said, not looking up from his work.  “It’s now been zero days since Agent Coulson told us that we have a problem.”  He squinted down at the incredibly delicate electrical circuit he was working on.  “We didn’t quite make the record of eleven days set when Clint dragged him on vacation last year.”
“All right.”  She braced a hand on the edge of his window.  “What’re the chances you’ll come on and-”
He stood, and he was pleased.  He was steady on his feet.  His hands weren't shaking anymore.  He smiled, and it didn't.  “I'm going to go back downstairs,” he said.  “And finish my dessert.”
A blast of webbing shot over his shoulder, catching the mad science type in the chest and face.  Tony stared at him, nonplussed.  “Can he breathe through that?”
"They know who you are, even if they didn't know who you are, they know who you are," Tony said, trying to wrestle Steve's glove off and getting absolutely no help from Steve.  "You need to stop assuming everyone needs an introduction, because it's just awkward and it wastes time, and I don't care so much about the first part, but the second part will be the death of me."  He glared down at Steve's hand, still stubbornly encased in leather.  "Do you put these on with super glue?"
Steve heard Happy swear, but he barely registered it, already moving down the hallway, straight for Hammer’s office.  He gave the doorknob a hard pull, testing the lock, before raising his elbow and slamming it into the glass that covered the top of the door.  It shattered, shards raining down to the wooden floor like raindrops.
“Uh-huh.” Things were a mess in here, and Tony made a deliberate effort to ignore that.  Nothing was on fire and at this point, he’d take that.  The box was on the top shelf, and he collected it with hands that weren’t quite steady.
“It's less that I want to dance,” Steve admitted, “and more that Tony can dance, and dancing, in general, is expected, and I really would like to be able to dance with him, without making a fool of myself or creating an international incident.”
“Right, sit down, junior, until you’re old enough for us to go to work on you.”  Moondragon put a firm hand on Peter’s head and pushed him into one of the lobby seats.  His knees buckled, and he landed with an audible thump.  Moondragon leaned over his shoulder, a frightening smile on her face.  “Comfortable?”
The knocking stopped, and Steve scraped his hands down his face.  “Goddammit,” he mumbled into his palms.  “I haven't had enough sleep for this.”  He grabbed his pants from the end of the bed, shaking them out.  “Not that there is enough sleep for this.”
"I can do it," Tony said, even as Steve pried him off the floor.  Tony swayed on his feet, his head wobbling on his neck.  "See?  I told you I could-"  That was as far as he got before his knees buckled, his body tipping forward.  Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, pinning Tony to his chest.
That won him a smile.  Mickey mumbled a street, between bites of rice and sausage, and Steve leaned back in his seat, relief flooding over him.  “That makes it easy,” he said.  There was a small notebook on the counter, a pencil tied to the spine.  Steve scribbled a quick note, and ripped it out, folding it in quarters.  “Give this to your ma.”  He handed it over.  “Tell her to go down to the precinct on down by the old bank building.  She needs to ask for Sgt. Dionne, and give him that note.”
“Well, you have to admit, darling, it’s a bit worrying,” Jan said, her nose buried in a report.  Tony glanced up just in time to see her flip the page, her fingers flitting across the paper.  “In that most of the things that Coulson knows about are…”  She paused, her lips pursing into a perfect bow.  “I don’t know quite the right word.”
Steve traded cartons with him.  “So...  You behaved yourself?” he asked.  Tony considered taking offense at that, but it was kind of comforting that Steve knew better.
He smiled.  “Small things mean a lot, sometimes.  I guess.”  He took a deep breath.  “You're always going to be a hero, Steve.  We need your brains, after all.  You're the strategist around here.  You're the one with the plan.  You're the one we all trust.”  His thumb stroked over Steve's jaw.  “You're going to heal.  But even if you didn't...”  He smiled.  “We'll still need you.”
He cradled his phone against his ear, his gaze locked on the shiny toes of his shoes as he listened to it ring.  His pulse was throbbing behind his temples, his jaw painfully tight.  He sucked in a breath from between his teeth, and the air hissed with each breath.
Tony realized his hand was covering his breastbone with one hand.  He let it drop down to his side.  “A guest, what do you mean-”
Almost against his will, Steve smiled.  “I’m sure it’s not.”  He stood, and it hurt, everything hurt, and he wanted to crawl into the bed and pull the covers over his head.  He wanted to crawl into Tony’s bed and pretend that he didn’t care.  Pretend that he could collect a salary during the day and reap far different benefits at night.  He shook off the thought.  “I don’t want a job.  I want a home.”
“Dramatic, but not life threatening,” Bruce said.  He flicked a finger against the glass bottle hanging from the stand next to the bed.  “Our usual cheerful volunteer has been hard at work.”
Steve bit back a smile.  "You're efficient," he agreed, catching Tony's elbow before he could get swept away by the crowd, "but not even you could make this much trouble, this fast."
“Oh.”  Strange pulled a chair away from the table and slumped down into it, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “My house did no such thing.  The-”  His face wrinkled up in disgust.  “The vermin that is currently infesting my walls tried to eat you.  My house did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It expelled you before that could happen.”
“Fired,” Tony managed, and it worked, it worked because Jarvis started to laugh, wobbly and uneven, but it was enough.  Tony grabbed the wastepaper basket, just in time for his stomach to empty itself in a rush.
“Done.” Fury pulled a chair away from the table and sank down into it with a sigh.  He looked up, meeting DJ’s gaze headon, a faint smile on his face.  “Seriously.  You okay?”
“Of course you don’t,” Tony said.  He reached for his pen, and his paperwork, and Steve wanted to scream at him.  “Here I thought you were concerned for my wellbeing.  My mistake.”
Steve couldn't hold back a smile.  "Charming enough that I didn't kick your ass out into the hall," he admitted.
Her index finger tapped an uneven rhythm against the desktop.  “You're really going to sit on this?”
“You clearly never signed one of Howard’s contracts, or you’d know that is absolutely not true,” Obie said.  He took his hat from Natasha.  “Thank you, darling.”  He pointed at Tony.  “Guards.”
“And I wasn’t,” Tony said.  Steve gave him a look.  “I’m still not.”  He paused.  “Though honestly, now that I think about it, that does sound like what someone who’s cheating on you would write.”
“Oh, there's no chance we're not getting that back anyway,” Tony said.  He picked up a napkin, letting the snowy fabric unfold between his fingers.  “Keep the Fantastics away from the Atlanteans as well.”
“I’ll use the small child to wheedle additional pieces,” Tony said, holding his hands out to DJ, who took them and swung down to the ground, his feet kicking for an instant.  It was enough to make Tony ignore the spike of pain from his side.  “Right?”
He was breathing hard as he skidded to a halt at the top of the stairs.  DJ came around the corner and screeched to a halt, his bare feet catching on the polished marble floor.  He stared up at Tony, his eyes narrowing.  Tony raised a hand in a little wave.  “Hi.  Where are your pants?  We have rules here.  And pants, they are on the rules, so-”
DJ nodded.  “There are schemes.  And betting pools.  I’m not supposed to know about either of those, but everyone talks so loud all the time.”
“That might work,” Miss Van Dyne said.  She tossed Steve's jacket towards the dressing table with careless disdain..  “The vest will work for you and-”
“Because it’s not right,” Steve said, quiet and sure.  “Because no one deserves to get gunned down in the street in front of-”  He shook his head.  “It’s not right, and it shouldn’t happen, and I-”  He met Tony’s eyes.  “I won’t let it happen.”
“I have no memory of making a video, let alone uploading one, I assume it all happened after the drinking happened-”
“Very good, sir,” the man said, reaching for his ledger.  “Will you be paying now, or will we be billing you?”
“Oh my God,” Steve said, because he was standing ten feet from Sam and he was pretty sure he felt the backdraft from that burn.
“I’m living my best life, Jarvis, I promise I’ll bathe, and I’m firing you tomorrow, I’d do it today, but I’m too busy, I’ve got things to do, so many-”  There was a sound of clattering china from behind him.  He smiled. “So many wonderful things to do, so…  If you’ll excuse me.”
Tony pulled away, propping himself up on his elbow to look around.  Steve grinned up at him, because he was all sleepy eyes and disastrous hair.  Tony made a displeased sound and collapsed back onto the pillows.  “You must’ve pulled me over here.”
DJ dabbed another bit of blue, and swirled it into the white glaze.  “Hilma af Klint,” he explained.
"See, he's very literal," Tony said, amused.  "He's very bad at passive aggressive attempts at speaking in veiled concepts, for some reason, he insists on talking about the thing we're talking about."
He took a slow, shallow breath through his nose.  If he was lucky, he was at home, in his own bed, and Rhodey was somewhere nearby, also nursing a bitch of a hangover.  Tony took a moment to savor that thought, that Rhodey was probably in as much pain, if not more than he was.  It was a pleasant thought, mostly because he couldn’t remember much, but he was pretty sure that what he did remember was all Rhodey’s fault.
Steve watched them over the top of his book, smiling to himself as Peter ducked under the flapping kite, guarding his head with his free arm.  Just a few steps behind, DJ made a grab for the tail, his fingers managing to brush up against the string before it slipped out of reach again.  Peter made a hard turn, playing out the string, and the kite went crashing to the lawn.  DJ followed it, laughing as he collapsed onto the grass.
Pepper took a delicate step backwards, well out of range.  “Please tell me that this doesn't have anything to do with the new dessert menu.”
Steve sighed.  “No.”  He crouched down next to DJ’s chair, his eyes pained, his mouth a flat line.  “You can fly, though.”
Steve nodded.  “Yes, your Majesty.  You were…”  He scrubbed a hand over his eyes.  “You were King Phillips’ spymaster.”
Behind him, Steve was silent, and Tony shifted, twisting in his arms.  “Me, they just wanted to sleep with.”  He grinned.  “Bit different.”
It was a quick trip down the stairs, both of them moving as quickly as they could while keeping the noise down.  Steve saw a door open on the first floor, but didn’t bother looking back as they passed.  A matter of moments, and they were out of the building, the cold light of dawn hovering just above the skyline.
“Help me out here, Nicodemus,” Tony said, striding into the SHEILD boardroom.  “You cannot tell me you didn't know that the US Government was taking some serious style tips from Doctor Doom.  You can't tell me this.  I won't believe it.”  He threw himself into a seat, his legs bouncing out in front of him.  “So.  What the fuck.”
Trip leaned back in her chair, ignoring the way it creaked.  “Baby, this is Vegas.  Everyone takes cash.”
Iron Man stared at him.  “As a couple’s therapist, I’d say he’s more likely to take your side,” he said to Rogers.  “Which is wrong on a couple of levels, honestly.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Sir, I might not be Stark's biggest fan, but no one deserves to be gunned down in their own house.  If someone is targeting him, then we have to find out who.  And if it is the Bolsheviks?  Then it's the Bolsheviks.  But if it's not?”  He shook his head.  “Someone's trying to get away with murder.”
Jarvis gave him a look, his eyebrows arching, and Tony slapped a smile on his face.  “It’s good,” he said.
Steve went still, and from the bedroom, Tony said, “No.”  Then, “Don’t make that face at me, botboy.  Okay.  Fine.  I’m not mad at you for being here.  I’m not mad at you for the magic thing.  I’m not mad that you didn’t….   Didn’t tell me.  I’m a little mad about the ‘dropping the armor and going into freefall’ thing because we’ve been over that, and it’s not cute.”
Which, he supposed, wasn’t the pillow’s fault.  It couldn’t be more or less than it was, and it wasn’t the pillow’s fault that he was here, stuck with it as much as it was stuck with him.
Next to them on the blankets, Clint and Happy were on their second or third serving of everything, locked in a battle of wills and stomachs that only made sense to the two of them.  They were wearing the crowns that Bobbi had already finished, Clint's sitting slightly crooked on his head.  Bruce, who'd managed to escape up until this point, peeled an apple, the knife sliding along the skin with slow precision.  Furbro crouched nearby, his tail swishing as he watched the peel sway through the air as Bruce turned the apple in his hands.  Every so often, he reached out with a lazy paw, batting at the end of the skin.
Tony choked on a mouthful of wine, and Rogers gave him a quick look, as if realizing too late that he'd gone too far.  Tony grinned at him.  “Ignore him, discussion ruins his digestion,” he said, setting his glass down.
He wasn't sure how he heard it.  It wasn't loud.  It wasn't aggressive.  It was, if anything, strangely neutral.  Tony glanced over at the crowd of reporters.  And despite the chaos happening there, he knew who'd asked it.
He shrugged, and immediately regretted it when something dug into his spine.  “Not this exact situation,” he admitted.  “But close enough.  Sometimes it's an alien instead of a robot.  Or a boat instead of a bus.  Once I fell in a cheese making vat, that was worse than this.  That was like, a HUNDRED times worse than this.  Close your eyes.”  He waited, a breath, then two, then he cracked the glowstick, a practiced, one handed maneuver.  Even with his eyes squeezed shut, the sudden flare of light stung.
“Everything's going to be fine!” he said, and he considered getting Phil on the comm, because it sounded so much more comforting when Phil said it.  It actually sounded believable when Phil said it.  “Callie.  Everything is going to be-”
“That was my mistake,” Carol said, ignoring Jess’ flailing hands.  “You sound like a thirteen year old, Jess, this is undignified.”
“Nope.  Wrong answer.  Say, 'yes, Hawkeye, as it turns out, my neighbors are asshole bigots and it sucks that I have to deal with that, but they're the problem, not me,” he said.  He tried to smile.  “Right?”
DJ gave him a look.  “Scared me,” he said, and for the first time since he’d reappeared, he looked like a child.  He chewed on his lower lip.  “It didn’t work.  I tried to stop it.  It…”  His shoulders slumped.  “It didn’t work.”
“No one cares, Ed,” Morrison said, collapsing back into his seat. He looked petulant. “You can take your suggestions and shove them up your ass, really, I don't-”
“Practice,” Steve said, sitting back down  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony try to hide his smile behind the palm of his hand, and Steve kicked him under the table.  “Right.  So the holiday party?”
Stark's eyes were brilliant, a gleaming, golden brown, like sunlight through a bottle of aged scotch, and just as intoxicating.  Steve felt his face heat, and straightened up, his shoulders going back.  "My apologies," he said, his voice tight.  "I shouldn't have-"
“I give you a reason for wanting and needing the plane without having to explain that there’s one more Stark in the universe right now,” Clint said.  “I’ll keep Lewis from lighting anything valuable or irreplaceable on fire.”
"I have work to do," he said to Pepper, who rolled her eyes, her lips curled in an affectionate smile.
“They’re FISH,” Tony said.  “They’re-   No.  We’re not having this discussion.” To Dummy, he added, “Okay, fine, off with you, go keep all the pets and wild feathery things alive, but I expect you back here in half an hour.”
“I pissed off the New York culinary scene, and he’s laying into Congress,” Tony pointed out.  “The two are in no way equivalent.”
“Pretty sure you can still get it working,” Clint said.  Rhodey gave him a look, and Clint pointed finger guns in his general direction.  “I have faith in you.”
“Yes.  Because someone is always going to come for you,” Iron Man said.  “Always.  First and foremost.  Someone is always coming for you, Deej.  Sometimes it’s me, sometimes it’s Steve.  He did the right thing, and he came to find you, because you are chaos in a vaguely human shaped form, and you need all the help you can get.”
DJ took another bite of his soup, watching the creature lean into Harris’ hand. “How did it get here?”
The old lady chortled, and Tony’s lips twitched.  “And how long are you planning on holding that against me?”
"I'm buying this entire country," Tony said, as they exited into the airport proper.  He resisted the urge to kick Steve in the shins.  "You planning on putting me down?"
Tony cursed, but got back in the car.  Only after his door shut did Steve follow suit.  Happy looked at him out of the corner of his eyes.  “Playing with fire there, aren’t we buddy?”
“Yeah, that's, that's kind of my modus operendi,” Tony pointed out.  “You should be used to that by now, Pep.”
Steve’s face was tense.  “Stay here, until I get back,” he said, and Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “Mr. Stark-”
Tony twisted around in his chair, his coffee cup halfway to his mouth, and froze, his stomach icing over in the space of a single breath..
“I mean, I have to trust you,” Bucky said.  “I can’t-”  He stopped, his eyelids fluttering.  “Remember.”
Rhodes' smile only got wider.  “I'm sure Tony would be pleased to hear you think so.”  His head tipped in the direction of the car.  “That's one of his.”
“At this point, any more input will likely just confuse me,” he said, taking a drink of his coffee.  The heavy bite of whiskey hit hard, and he coughed, his head snapping back.
Steve grinned at him, water running along the planes of his face, down his neck, his arms, his legs, down EVERYTHING, and Tony was having trouble breathing all of a sudden.  “Because one thing I learned growing up in this city, Tony?  The rain feels better if you really need it,” he said.
“And that'll be handled, don't you worry,” Hogan said, his voice cheerful.  “But we've got a bit of a situation, and Miss Potts thought that you might be able to help.”
Then the pile of clothes on his armchair moved, a familiar head popping up.  DJ squinted at them from under the leg of a pair of pants.  “Where,” he said, his voice accusing, “have you BEEN?”
Val gave him a look.  “Uncle Johnny lies.  A lot.”  She tucked a long strand of pale hair behind her ear.  “Dad had to develop flame proof bedding for a reason, you know, Franklin.”
Steve choked on a laugh.  "We've only got the one, and I still feel outnumbered."  He paused, trying to gauge her mental state.  "Can I buy you a cup of coffee?"
Jan looked out, squinting at the view. The landing platform was sheltered by the building, giving a full view of the city without having to brave the full force of the elements. “I thought you'd be in the gym.”
“There shouldn’t even be an OPTION to do that, Daedalus,” Tony snapped, and Iron Man waved a hand in his direction, a dismissive, disdainful flick of his fingers.  “What were you-”
“That is quite enough,” Agatha snapped.  She hadn’t moved from her seat, her face set.  “I have no desire to discuss my motivations, you will all kindly sit down and behave yourselves.”
“I did.” Steve exhaled as they cut hard around a skyscraper, heading straight for the Tower.  “He's okay, Tony.  They're not coming for him.”
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said, as May passed him the water.  He held it to Tony’s lips.  “Take a sip of this, if you could just-”  Tony took it and dumped it over his head, and Jarvis blinked.  “Or…  That.”
Steve nodded.  “He loves you,” he said, and Shuri made a face.  Steve smiled.  “Know who he would blame if something were to happen to you?”
“Wait, are we talking about Sam’s potato nachos?  The spicy waffle fries, topped with cheese, sour cream, salsa, jalapenos, barbacoa pulled pork and refried beans?” Bucky asked.
“It might be that,” Clint said, grinning.  He took the jam from Bobbi.  “Also, he's gotta replace us.”
Steve shoved a spoonful of stew into his mouth and made a big show of chewing.  Laughing, Bucky turned back to Shuri.  “So you set out?”
Steve moved into the room, ducking down to peer up into the chimney.  “Appreciate that.  I’m…  Old fashioned myself, so…”
"I don't-"  Steve had barely gotten the words out before Natasha was there, throwing an old, ragged quilt around Stark's shoulders like a cape.  And Bobbi was right behind her, slipping a crown of golden lilies and deep purple mums onto his head.  Lacy white Queen Anne's lace filled the gaps between the petals, bright as stars against his dark hair.
“Yeah, sure,” Sam said.  “That, and also, how to run an effective sword check station when half your attendees are carrying blades the size of your left leg.”
Steve shifted his weight, caught between fight and flight, but Bobbi’s gaze was level and steady.  Natasha opened the back door of the car.  “Get in,” she said, her voice flat, and Steve got it.  She shut the door behind him with a very final sounding thud, and he did his best not to flinch.
He wasn’t, not really, but DJ took a seat, one hand tugging the sushi closer to him.  “You’re here.”
Steve laughed.  “Garlic bread,” he said, the words breathy.  “Che-” Tony's thigh slid between his, and the word died with a stutter of breath.  His hips jerked forward, and he tried again. “Cheesy garlic bread.”
Because there had to be enough for the next day, as well.  And the one after that.  All the ones after that.
Steve leaned in, his eyes dark.  “Stark.  At this point, I can't promise you that we'll make it to your CAR.  If we try to make it back to Brooklyn, you're likely going to have to pull over so I can have you in the back seat.”
“Because Coulson is surprisingly susceptible to your bullshit, and Director Fury hasn't stopped laughing since he heard the news,” Maria said with a pleasant smile.  “And despite my best efforts, the American public still associates you with SHIELD.”  Her smile got very thin.  “So that makes you, and this, my problem.”
Steve hung his keys on the hook beside the door, already too tired for this.  “I thought we agreed you'd go bother Sam until Tony's feeling better,” he said, kicking his own shoes off.  “There's really not-”
Obie set his glass down.  “You look pale, Anthony.”  His eyes tipped up from under the heavy line of his brows.  “Did you have another attack?”
Logan shrugged.  “You chose your side when you tried to stop it,” he said.  “I'm sure they wouldn't mind making an example of a few of you.”
Tony glared in Peter’s direction.  Peter didn’t seem to notice.  “Right, and maybe it was for them,” Tony said, gesturing between Rhodey and Pepper.  “Did you ever-”
“I’m not mad,” Tony said.  “Mrs. Parker isn’t mad.  Chef isn’t mad.  I want you to not be scared, or upset, or angry.”  He paused.  “Do you want to talk?”
“I'm not certain how to answer this question, sir,” Jarvis said.  He sounded appropriately apologetic.  Tony was well aware that it was an act.
A high, warbling whistle came through the fog, soft at first, and then growing in volume.  The thug in front of Steve took a step back, and another, his eyes narrowing as he tried to peer through the shadows.  “Who’s that?” he snapped at one of his men, who shook his head.  The thug jerked his head to the side, biting out a curse.  “Idiot.  Go check.”
He flinched. “I meant to,” he said, not needing her to be more specific. He knew what he was supposed to have told Tony. “I was going to. I guess it's good that I didn't, huh?”
“Back off, you harpy, you've got your own,” he said, and she laughed, settling back in her seat.  Tony petted his roses with a careful hand.  “It's all right, darlings, I won't let the greedy lady get her hands on you.”
She straightened up.  “We have reached an understanding.  Good.”  She looked at Tony.  “You.  You bring a minor into our place again, I will personally have your spine.  I will use it as a cane, when I am old and feeble, to beat men like you half to death, well, well into my declining years.”
Jan raised her hand, prim and proper as a school girl.  After a beat of silence, Steve nodded at her.  She gave him a bright grin.  "So, now that we've agreed that we're united in our desire to stonewall people we don't like-”
“I sure as fucking did,” Clint said.  He shook the wrinkles out of his map.  “And we’re going to like, at least one Cirque du Soleil show.”
Steve broke the pastry in half, revealing the hidden cache of golden brown apples, dripping with cinnamon syrup.  “Right,” he said, wishing he believed that.
“Well, that’s fine,” he said, twisting the pasta around his fork.  “More for me.”  He smiled down at DJ.  “Don’t worry.  If you’re here for more than a few days, Jarvis will figure out what to make for you when you’re feeling scared or sad.”  He held up his fork.  “Because comfort food is a healthy way to cope with a particularly bad day.”
She smiled. “Understandable.”  She pushed herself to her feet, relying heavily on her cane to get to her feet.  “I do know of the best dessert buffet in Vegas.  Private room.  Chocolate fountain at the table.”
“At least he showed up on time,” he said, reaching for his knife.  He flicked it back and forth in his hand, letting the light play across the blade.  “And with clean hands.”
“The thread’s coming lose on this hem, I should have caught that when they were laundered.  I’ll have them fixed before you return, and perhaps this button-”
Tony's body swayed against his, and Steve took his weight easily, his free hand coming up to brush Tony's hair away from his forehead.  His skin was hot and dry, and Steve shook his head.  "C'mon, Typhoid Tony.  Time to go home."
"Yeah, yeah," the woman said, a smile creasing her cheeks.  "Your charm is noted.  Now, how do you plan to-"
Fury nodded.  “Can't say I blame them,” he said.  He braced his jaw on one hand.  “And to answer your question, Stark, we were aware of the project.  We did not think that it was going to be unveiled in quite this manner.” His mouth went tight.  “Or quite this quickly.”
"He's social.  Look at him.  He's so social that if you held out a packet of baby wipes he'd probably follow you home," Tony said.
“I think that is an absolute certainty,” Tony said.  To Fury, he said, “Just how many of these things are we dealing with?”
“Well, you’re the one who dropped it and made that chip,” Jarvis told him.  “I see no reason to trust you with another.  The same thing will just happen again, and we only have so many dishes, sir.”
She smiled back.  “I am sorry, it was not my intention to intrude upon you without your permission or without warning.  I just…”  She took a deep breath.  “Forget that you cannot hear my footsteps as I approach.”
“It was-” Tony spread his hands wide.  “It was always your fault that he couldn't have a dog, May, that was one hundred percent on you.”
Tony’s fingers lingered on the black king, rotating it in slow circles on its base.  “He was a hell of a businessman,” he agreed.  “And he knew how to make money.”
“Good luck with that,” Jess said, grinning.  “Steve, we didn't list 'dance lessons' on the group calendar, that's about as discreet as we're going to get.”  Steve tried to glare at her.  It was harder than it should've been, and she just shrugged.  “We're helping!  Right?”
The second sweep, he’d try to keep focused, despite the way his brain kept trying to wander back to last night.  And this morning.  And the possibility of later on today.
It was a perfectly ordinary looking hotel conference room, set with a few arm chairs and a single rather lopsided couch.  There was a table, piled with con booklets and a few discarded bags of wrappers and brochures.  There was a table with a coffee urn and water pitchers, a plate of picked over cookies, with the crumbling and rejected remains scattered across the tablecloth.
“Oh, I think you are.”  She pulled her hand back, and a trail of holographic sparks chased her fingers.  She gave Tony a smile.  “Your view is so much wider, and so much deeper, than just about being I’ve ever met.  You are intimately acquainted with fear.  And you have the means and the ability to build a way to counter against all the things that go bump in the night.”
“No artist ever has too many sketchbooks.”  Steve dragged another crate of the damn things out from under the table.  “At least, that's what my brain keeps telling me every time I'm in an art supply store, looking at a display of sketchbooks.”
“Yeah, judging by my headache right now, yes, I was probably really, really, REALLY drunk,” Tony said, “And when I’m really, really, REALLY drunk I usually say things that I mean but that I really, really, REALLY shouldn’t say.”
“Library,” she agreed.  “Off with you.”  She yanked a page free, holding it up between her index finger and thumb.  It twisted back and forth, rattling against itself.  She released it, and it burst into flame.
He straightened his vest with a few quick, efficient movements.  “But in the meantime, Dr. Essex thinks it best for you to work hard, get lots of fresh air, eat carefully, and stay here.  Where you’re safe.”
“Spouse, and thus, medical proxy coming through,” Tony said, because he wasn't sure if that was right, but what the hell was the point of accidentally marrying one of your best friends if you couldn't use it to throw your weight around?  He brushed his way past a nurse and what looked to be a couple of interns, plowing straight towards the bed.
“We’re fine, Mrs. Parker,” Jarvis said, as Tony gasped for breath.  He realized Jarvis’ hand was on his back, rubbing slowly back and forth.  “Keep an eye on our uninvited guest, please.”  To Tony, he said, “Better?”
Tony smiled.  “I'm fine.  Go distract Marcy before she convinces the board that we can walk on water.”  The knob of the door turned easily under his hand, and he ducked into the stairwell.
“Rhodey, actually,” Tony said.  His eyebrows arched.  “The Army brass had limited use for a man of his intelligence and abilities, but he likes to make his own opportunities.”  He swirled the wine in his glass. “However, if you threatened any of her ducklings, I’m fairly certain May could figure out which end of the dynamite to light.”
“Your…”  Trip looked at the blonde, who did an amazing shrug-nod combo of a gesture.  “Like, dads who are together?” she asked.  The man nodded, a split second before the kid did.  Trip nodded, too.  “Because we don’t have to do a friendship ceremony for that, that’s legal, we can do the real thing?”
“Desperation,” Steve told her. “I mean, I'm hell to live with. I've been reliably informed that last week I went into a twenty-three minute rant about food waste in New York restaurants. I probably would've gone on longer, except Tony distracted me with a SHIELD briefing.” He smiled. “Which was probably the right choice.”
“She’s left it to you to actually press the button,” Tony said, grinning back at him.  His head tipped towards the door, and he rolled to his feet, leaving the chair bounce in his wake.  “For Jan?  That shows a remarkable amount of trust.”
Steve shook his head as he dug through his saddlebags.  “Not a prince,” he said, pulling a water flask out.  It was light for its size, well balanced and even better crafted.  Like everything he’d encountered in Wakanda, the function had never been forgotten in the pursuit of perfecting its form.
“Perhaps,” Jarvis allowed.  “Miss Potts did insist we contact him.”  He poured another cup of water.  “I am of the opinion that the wellbeing of the company could wait until tomorrow.”
Isaiah gave Steve a look of such triumph that it was all that Tony could do to keep from laughing.  “I'll check my calendar,” Isaiah said.  “And get back to you.”
"She knows what she's doing," Tony said, his head resting on Steve's shoulder.  He looked up, just far enough to meet her eyes.  "You know what you're doing."
“Yes, I'm sure you can,” Jarvis told him, and moved the stepstool into place next to the car.  “Here now.  Let's see if there's anything we can do to help without getting in the way.  All right?”
Rogers choked on his wine, and Tony grinned at him.  The man was bright red, from the tips of his ears, all the way down his neck.  For a bit of innuendo, it was overkill, but Tony almost wanted to see what would happen with some real dirty talk.
Tony took a deep breath.  “Now that we've reached such a deep and abiding accord, I think it would be best if I were to-”
He looked up, at the heavy weight of the vegetation that pressed in on them, a confusing tangle of impenetrable leaves and stems and blossoms, so thick that it threatened to block out the sun.  He could feel it, the damp air a physical pressure on his skin. And wondered if that warning was coming far too late.
He screamed, and it was a word.  “Stop stop stop stopstopstopstopstop.”  DJ lashed out with one hand, light pooling between his fingers, licking along his skin, uncontrolled and uneven.  He stared up into the roiling, twisting nothing, knowing that whatever small power he had, whatever he could summon, that was not anything that could stop the thing that was coming, that was already here.  His fingers snapped together in a fist, closing around that small, brilliant light.
The single word whispered through his head, the letters rattling against each other.  DJ sucked in a breath, not sure when he’d last remembered to breathe.
“Far better than I was,” Tony said, pouring coffee into his cup.  “However, I know myself.  If I ended up dating a therapist, that-”  He paused, the coffee pot hanging in mid-air.  “Let’s just say it wouldn’t be fair to that person, as I really can’t be trusted not to take advantage of certain…  Skillsets.”
“That’s…  Still up in the air,” Bruce said, but he started towards the door, with a slow, plodding tread.  He looked at Steve.  “Can I leave him to you?”
“She's not the only one,” Bobbi said.  She gave the spoon a lick.  “Rhodes was mad enough to spit bullets last night.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Jess dug through the mess on the table in front of her, coming up with the original catering suggestions.  “To keep you from ordering overpriced, under-spiced taco platters from a caterer named Bunnie?” She looked from the pages to Jan and back.  “I’m not letting you live this down.  I’m going to publicly shame you about this.”
The bark of laughter caught them both off balance.  "Don't do that again," Tony said, trying to get himself under control.  "Just-  Don't, I do not need-"
“Thank god for small favors, I guess,” Tony said.  He considered his coffee cup, but his stomach was churning.  Instead, he shifted sideways, leaning into Steve's personal space.  Steve wrapped an arm around his waist, his grip firm and strong.
Tony caught it, and leaned over to press a kiss to her tight knuckles.  “Twit,” he said, grinning at her.
Steve stopped, still so aroused it hurt.  But there was something sad about that one word, something melancholy about the way Tony mumbled it into his pillow, his head tipped away from Steve, as if avoiding his eyes.  He took a breath and let it out.
“Like it?” Stark gave him a wide, glittering smile.  He reached up to push his hair back from his forehead, and Steve lost his breath.  “Its's all the rage in Europe.”
“I don't live here because Hank and Tony have two modes,” Jan said.  She held up one finger.  “One, BFF's forever and ever, lets make friendship bracelets or perhaps a doomsday ray.”
Stark didn’t ask who ‘he’ was.  “I didn’t.  I don’t.  I-”  He took a deep breath.  “It’s more complicated than that, I suppose.  I just-  I figured out that what I needed, he couldn’t give me.  And what he could give me, I didn’t really…  I didn’t want it.  He never figured that out, and neither did I.  At least, not when he was alive.  I was looking for something that I was never going to get, and that fucking sucks, but it’s not my fault.  It might not even be his.”
She glanced away, the line of her jaw tight.  “But if I do that...  I expose him.  I draw attention to him.  I make him a focus, a target, and right now, he's not.  He's safe.  As safe as I can make him, and I'm finding out ugly things about myself.”
Mrs. Parker took a deep breath.  “It was a clean shot, at least.  He didn’t suffer.  Might not even know what had happened.  A gang of men had broken in, looking for-”  She shook her head.  “Well, I suppose it doesn’t matter what they were looking for.  Ben was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he…”
Steve held out a hand, stopping him in his tracks.  “I’m…”  He took a deep breath.  “I’m not coming back, Jarvis.”
The staircase flexed like an accordian, and Strange caught DJ by the elbow, lifting him away into the air before the stairs could collapse under them.  The wood parted, creaking as it did, and Clea poked her head up from between the boards.  “Drat,” she said, and disappeared again.
