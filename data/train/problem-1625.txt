Sherlock smiled faintly into his tea. "You have no idea what scientists do." He took another perfunctory sip, his bloodshot, weary eyes flickering away. "I know the chemist who made that initial discovery. That led to that article."
. Yet another person that Sherlock had let himself get close to and yet she'd still looked him in the face and shot him, and he'd forgiven her for it because what else was he supposed to do? What else had
"Sherlock.
Not at the snap of his fingers and drop of his hat that he wants it to.
It's not more dangerous than what he gets up to with Sherlock, though, and the reminder just gives John another reason to frown. Sherlock's going to be more than a bit put out that John won't be there at crime scenes for the next several days.
Sherlock shrugs out from under John's hand, and starts for the door himself.
He could lean in and kiss Sherlock. It would be the easiest thing in the world. His skin was warm and his eyes were bright and he was
Sherlock is really never going to let him hear the end of this one.
Sherlock's answering silent twitch was as good as an admission. And for once, John really, really hated to be proven right.
He gains weight, much to John's approval, and the last of the IVs come out. He's steadier on his feet, and the doctors stop talking about infection and his next scan and start talking instead about how he'll manage at home. Acute pain management turns into discussions about chronic pain management instead.
It'd be good for him. It'd be good for both of them.
It's that endearing and bit creepy thing he does, when a very crucial and important wire in his brain somewhere trips and leaves him sputtering on an emergency systems update. He sits there and blinks and just stares at him, a connection gone faulty and a team of little Sherlocks in his brain is hard at work rewiring it. He stares up at John with his brilliant eyes fluttering, for just long enough that John knows he's too sleepy to parse his thoughts.
Sherlock gave an uninterested shrug, still staring at his feet. What did it matter? He'd been hit before. Nobody had ever asked why or who. He didn't care about getting retribution or protection or... whatever it was the incompetent administration would promise. He just wanted to be left alone. "I suppose. Dr. W--"
By the time he's finished with the email, John is finished with whatever it is that he's writing, and they switch off. And at first, Sherlock has no idea what he's reading. It's a grocery list, milk, eggs, tea, and so on, but that's not all that it is. Each item is, very oddly, because John does tend to do very odd things, marked with directions.
"Is it not enough that you are my brother, Sherlock?" Mycroft asks, tilting his head to the side. He looks at him with naked sympathy, and it is disgusting beyond measure. But it is sympathy. It is genuine sympathy and it makes him feel more exposed than anything else ever could've. "Sentimental affection, for the only remotely intelligent individual I have the displeasure of sharing this city with? Make it out to selfishness, if you will... my life would be considerably dimmer if you were not in it."
He tries to say it. He signs the first two words and then mouthes the last, tasting their shape and weight on his tongue. It is just his name. Sherlock Holmes. That is all it is. He has known it since infancy, since he was a baby running outside with Redbeard and stumbling through the difficult syllables, softened into
Even his face is-- nausea tightens in John's stomach and he shoves back a moan. Even his beautiful
John couldn't help it, even with his nerves; he smirked and nearly laughed right into his mug. "Can you deduce what about, then?"
he wanted to say.
John kissed him. He set the takeaway out with Sherlock's help, the kitchen table overtaken by an ongoing experiment into viscosity levels, so they settled at the desk instead, eating over case notes and Sherlock's charging laptop. He didn't pour himself a drink, despite Sherlock still owning a few dusty bottles of ancient whiskey rattling around the cabinets somewhere, assorted gifts from clients. Sherlock couldn't be positive, but he was at least somewhat confident that John had not had a drink since that night with Oscar, now weeks and weeks ago. Sherlock hadn't, either.
Sherlock huddled himself back into a tighter ball, and shut his eyes.
But John looks at him, and somehow those two words were all it took to make him soften, that coldness in his face gone and the mug of tea turned in his hands. "It's... okay. Really. I think neither of us want to fight tonight. I just... I need for you to be all right. And I know you can't promise that but- not Magnussen, Sherlock. If Mary or whatever her name is can't handle him on her own, then fine. But unless you can look at me honestly and say that there was no way whatever plan you were thinking up could end in any way badly for you, then stay out of it. Promise me you'll stay out of it."
"And so do I, Sherlock." He smiled back, emotion stinging at the back of his throat, and somehow ended up allowing Sherlock's arm to slide again around his back as he dropped his face against his shoulder. "With everything that we have between us, I think we will. I think we'll be okay."
It moves on like it did when he was shot in Magnussen's penthouse and left for dead.

Sherlock's trying to speak. He realises how out of control this has gotten and he knows this is his one chance to explain himself before he gets thrown out of this hospital or worse. He has no choice left to speak. And he's
"Take this, John," Mycroft snapped, thumbing the mute button. He jerked to his feet with his face twisted, already dialing a number on his second phone. "Don't let him hang up. I'm seeing what the hold up is..."
"Yes," his friend said finally, his voice lolling and high-pitched, and
There was a beat of silence.
"I..."
He'd ruined John's life before. Why is John now looking at him like he's insane for trying to take precaution so that it does not happen again?
John, Sherlock decided, was acting strangely.
Sherlock took in another very deep, very calming breath. He smelled the alcohol between them and for a moment, just a moment, wanted to say sod the reporters, and throw up all over his lap.
Sherlock would be furious and scared out of his mind, and he would do
Mary shot Sherlock through the heart. Sherlock forgives it, because he's in his thirties, now, and has never once grasped how to care about himself.

But no, Sherlock had said very clearly that he'd had a

"Right. Because you'd know so much about what looks
"He's dead now. A bit ago, when the nominees were announced. Heroin overdose." He sat there, perfectly silent, nothing in his eyes at all but that same cold, angry hostility that had glimmered there since he'd knocked on his door.

"I'm... sorry," he finally stumbled out, looking back at Sherlock. "I mean, it's fine, of course, it's all fine. You know that. But I just always thought... well, to tell you the truth, until The Woman came along, I thought you were--"
Slowly, still feeling a bit as if from far away, Sherlock lifted his phone up, showing the incoming call to Oscar. "My apologies," he heard himself say, his voice tiny and distant. "If you'll excuse me a moment." He stood back up on legs that feel empty and numb, shivering inside his coat, and he withdrew.
It's late at night, by now, with Sherlock having sequestered himself in one of the seedier parts of London. It's a decidedly unsafe spot to be, this time of day. He doesn't really care. In fact, he's almost hoping a mugger or someone of similar repute will notice him, aggressively chainsmoking, and settled two back allies away from the street. He's in the mood for a fist fight... and
"Yes."
Sherlock kept his eyes shut, his face calm, and his entire body perfectly still. He very clearly had no intention of responding whatsoever, or moving in any way.
They didn't, really. They had nothing to do. Because the crime scene was back there, and yet Sherlock was down here, insisting that they leave. Insisting that there was nothing for them to do until Molly finished the first blood tests, which wouldn't be for hours or days. There was nothing for them to do at Baker Street, and no discernible reason why Sherlock was back in the lift barely five minutes after John had had to prod him out of it.
He had someone sitting on his sofa that was smart enough to win a bloody Nobel prize, and he was wasting every bit of himself into smack and heroin. "But the career. Discovering things, naming stuff after yourself, being a scientist. You know, productive member of society 'n all..."
Onwards!

Dr. Andrews' greeting smile faded as quickly as it had come, and its replacement was an exasperation that John already found much more familiar.

It was just touching. People touched all the time. That was what normal people did. He didn't want to be a
Irritation twinges inside him, a sour annoyance that just barely blankets over hurt. He'd expected Mycroft to show up, but not like this, and he doesn't know what to do with it.
Sherlock buried his face deeper into the cushions. He took in a deep, long breath, inhaling the familiar scent. Is that what the problem was? Really? John was almost killed, several different times in several different ways, and the problem was that Sherlock hadn't let him in on his plan before it had all ended up going awry anyway?
of a brother. He wants to shout at Mycroft. He wants to bodily throw him from the flat, shouting at him down every step of the stairs, and shout at him from the kerb and chase him off Baker Street with his voice alone.
And Sherlock insisted he had forgiven it, that he had forgiven it before John had even said he was sorry. Before he had ever promised to never do it again. But forgiveness didn't change the fact that all the experience Sherlock had with intimacy and closeness was the worst things that John had ever done to him.
Sherlock relaxes back down very quickly, the hard tension in his face and neck softening away. He melts back under the sheets and John's hand, turning into the pillow with a silent, shivered sort of snuffle.
Thank you so much for all the comments/kudos!!! Onwards!

Then:
Oscar Wilson couldn't break his heart because he didn't have it.
He can only hope Lestrade is the one who catches this case. The story of him apparently kneeing Mr. Mountain in the crotch to bring him down after a punch to the face hadn't been enough really isn't his best, but Lestrade will let him go home before dragging out his statement. Maybe Sherlock will even concede to getting the shopping.

His captors had gotten extremely, dangerously bored, and worked their frustrations out at his silence into his own skin.
The next step would be opening up his mouth, and talking.
No. This was not part of the plan!
He goes down so easily John knows the only reason he'd gotten the better of Sherlock at all is because Sherlock is still one six foot collection of healing scars and soreness and physical therapy, and that makes John hit him right in the fucking face for the third time.
And Sherlock likes to think there is no limit to what he would do for John, but this is for John. He'd thrown his voice away for him and now he wants it back. He

They pelt through London together, handcuffed and hand-in-hand, and he's higher than high, he's better than cocaine, but this time Sherlock falls from a rooftop and
This did not seem very comforting for Sherlock to hear. If anything, he looked even more distressed, and suddenly spun to turn his back and pace back and forth in the kitchen. He was clearly still agitated and now almost looked like the old Sherlock, twisting about the flat possessed by a manic energy, and John wasn't sure whether to be amused or genuinely concerned. He hadn't been this nervous on his own wedding day.
John straightens after a minute passes, and Sherlock remains upset. He goes to Sherlock's IV, increasing the flow of the sedative just a tick. They're already trying to wean him off opioids; John wants him to sleep through as much of the withdrawal and cravings as he can, and Mycroft is in full agreement. But if it's a choice between aggravating his distress right now, when he's in pain and scared and flinching away from John's hand with his bruised face looking so
The only reason Sherlock had squirreled himself away back here was to not be found. He's hardly surprised in the slightest that it's come back to bite him exactly like this.
At one point, stretching around from his abdomen across his right hip to his spine, were once letters, traced by the sharpest point of a knife:
Sherlock still felt that he'd deserved it.
John moves back home, and then the baby is born. John's eyes dim, and they don't light back up.
Davis has an eidetic memory, like Sherlock. It's the reason he's able to be so successful, while running this business on the side: he has no paper trail for the police to follow.
Sherlock still waits an extra eight minutes, long enough for John to have made it to the taxi queue on the kerb outside, and exactly as long as his patience can stand, to turn on the tablet.
"I didn't-- shouldn't have said that. I..." John dropped almost numbly into the nearest chair, suddenly unable to look at Sherlock. He hated seeing him like this. He hated wanting to erase every single thing he'd done in the past so many months but he couldn't and Sherlock sat there as incontrovertible evidence of them
"There's really only so much I can do when you're researching German Renaissance art and I don't speak
John's left hand is shaking.
he told himself, willing the concern to settle. Setbacks were normal. Bad days were expected. They just had to get back on track. "Come on, onto your back, sit up a little. You know the drill."
There'd been a good reason why. But honestly, painkillers and antibiotics lying suffocatingly heavy on his skull, he doesn't even remember it.
Sitting here, touching Sherlock's face in the intimacy of his kitchen, without a scar staring him in the face every time that he looked at him, was going to feel very, very different.
if he thinks Sherlock Holmes wants Irene Adler. "Brain is the new sexy," she tells him, and drugs him high as a kite, and Sherlock illustrates this fact by proceeding to have very intoxicated, very mind-blowing, very sexy sex with John in Irene's bed.
Oh, Sherlock." He wiped his mouth, looking up at him with realization dawning over his face as fully as a light being switched to on. He sat up and looked at Sherlock with soft eyes and a softer smile, beckoning out to him for him to rejoin him on the sofa. "Come here. It's okay."
"You," Mycroft says, "self-destructive, utterly incorrigible
Of course the interfering tosser knows. He probably watched John shepherd him out to a cab on CCTV. So?
Sherlock prances about as if his vocal chords were ripped out of his throat. To look at him now, nobody would have any fucking idea that instead he'd sat up in a hospital bed six months ago, with one black eye and a swollen lip and long, new scars on his back, and hasn't said a word since.
Or maybe he just shouldn't have had three whiskeys on an empty stomach, because they turned him even stupider and full of self-loathing than even
When the sulky genius at last reemerged, he had at least managed to piece himself back into looking like a human being again. Sherlock padded back into view barefoot and dressed in a suit that he hadn't slept in, his hair still drying and dripping onto a towel around his neck. He came to a halt to observe the room for just a moment, the fresh cups of tea, the waiting armchairs, where John sat on the sofa with his own cup.
"Yes," Mycroft agreed quietly. "I should have." He took another sip of tea, thumb tapping incessantly against the rim. "I didn't, which is the reason for what happened next."
Well, he certainly looked no more excited than he'd been in the car. If anything, he was just impatient, now, glaring daggers as the floors display ticked up and and the lift groaned around them. John raised an eyebrow at the chipped paint and nudged Sherlock, again trying to just prod him out of his funk. "Would've thought Cambridge would look a little nicer on the inside."
"Yes, yes, Graham, everyone relevant is assembled. Let's skip the pleasantries, shall we?" He all but vibrated as he stood, a self-contained ball of energy and nerves, smile blossoming. "You need me."
Sherlock jerks backward against the wall, rattling against it so loudly they both jump. At first John thinks something's frightened him again, but when he starts to move closer Sherlock reels back a second time, shaking his head.
He wasn't here to entertain idiots. He had been made to put up with these
And once again, he finds himself only signing to John's back.
he starts to sign, because John at least can understand at least that much. Even while obstructed by thick gloves and stiff fingers, everybody can translate the circle and three fingers pointing up as
"Um. No."
Oscar sat fully upright, withdrawing his arms from around him. It was an instant relief, but the sensation was short-lived, as he only reached across the scattered papers towards his previously abandoned drink, and the bottle of whiskey next to it.
"Now I really will throw up." Sherlock sunk deeper into his chair, almost folding up into himself like a prickly porcupine. The only signs of life in him were two glittering eyes underneath the wild fluffy wreck of his hair. "I think I did throw up on his shoes, actually.
There was a fucking difference between Sherlock hurting himself with needles and dangerous drugs, and John hating himself because he'd done a horrible thing. Because he was
"Get some sleep," he whispered. Somehow, his hand ended up in Sherlock's messy hair, and he brushed one long curl out of his eyes. "It'll be okay in the morning. I promise."
"But it's no worry, love, all of this. I'm sure you'll be feeling much better soon. You always heal right up so quickly... and with John
Sherlock takes a breath, and--

away. "For god's sake, John, were you not the one who requested this?
"...Greg?"
"'Kay. I'll get out of your hair soon-- please try and get something down later, though. You skipped dinner last night, too."
He drags himself to his feet then, suddenly incensed and he can't possibly say why. He slinks to the kitchen with his cup of tea just to set it down and make noise. A moment later he whacks the bottle of oxycodone to the floor, where it's loud and stupidly dramatic and rolls all the way out of his reach to wait at John's feet.
Lestrade jogs in through the entrance all in a rush himself, catching up to Sherlock with a hand on his back and noticing the oncoming security just as John had. He works out his badge, using it to wave them off, taking control of the situation, and-- that's it. There it is. That's the end of it.
And then it's suddenly too much, an expectation that hasn't been there in
It hurts, and yet from all the way down here, so very far away, he hears his throat spasm out a desperate noise that is only barely recognisable as human. It is not remotely close to a word.
He felt sick.
"...Okay," John said, when the silence had stretched on just long enough that Sherlock almost thought the subject to be dropped. "I'll make you a deal, Sherlock. I'll water- uh, Milgram-"
"I'm coming back," he chokes. His face crumples into John's hideous jumper and it's unforgivable. "I'm coming back, John," and John's fingers bury in his hair and his breath slides into Sherlock's chest there's nothing left of him at all, and the fraying threads of himself are stitched together solely by the warmth of John Watson.
When John does not interrupt, Mycroft chooses to simply go on, as calm as if this is just a boring chat over tea. "When Sherlock was ten, Redbeard died. We lived out in the country, so Redbeard never learned what a car was or to run away if he saw one. He was running across the road to Sherlock, and one of Daddy's friends hit him with their car."
It's a nervous habit to work off restless energy but it's also just who he is. He taps his feet and twitches his fingers and strokes his thumbs; Sherlock Holmes does not
Sherlock gulps air from behind the case file. It feels like there's something stuck in his throat again, a solid obstruction that sucks down oxygen but blocks anything from coming out. He keeps trying it, keeps trying to gasp for a breath to then open his mouth, but the second step never comes. There's nothing there.
John shrugged. "I don't know. Twenty-four, twenty-five, maybe. He was a graduate student. But Dr. Wilson would've been almost twenty years older, and I'm... god." He dropped back heavily in his chair to sink his head against his hand, bearing the brunt of a wave of anger and self-loathing. "You see what I mean? Sherlock would've been a foot taller than him and several dozen times smarter. Seriously, who could take advantage of
He could move just an inch and closer and kiss the fading scar that he'd just taken the stitches out of. He could kiss his face, and touch his hair, and work the tired, pained wrinkles out of his skin, and make him bloody
Damn it.
Sherlock was muttering to himself again, sounding especially forlorn and mournful. Definitely too much to drink. They needed to track him down, pour him into one of Mycroft's cars, and get him home.
Something else.
This is so pathetic.
"Yes," Sherlock says again, dazed.
Is it any bloody wonder why he tries to swear it all off, this caring lark, when it always ends this badly?
Oscar barely even glanced at him. Now that he'd learned he wasn't going to be able to use Sherlock to boost his reputation anymore, he'd completely flipped the switch, from adoring back to barely disguised disgust. "Hmm," he murmured, and took another sip of his own drink.
Sherlock sniffed, his nostrils flaring. He did, in fact, look at John, but it was a barely a flicker out of the corner of his eye, his jaw still clenched. He remained utterly annoyed with it all, not actually distressed but just
Sherlock grits his teeth, looking away. That's the reason he's here, isn't it?
"Come on," he says, squeezing his hand tightly. "Good work. You did your job, Mr. Consulting Detective. Now it's time to go home."
But on her way out the door, she lingers just a step, hesitating just outside the frame. She opens her mouth, then stops, conflicted.
The next non-John visitor is Molly.
He's still bundled up in his coat and scarf and shoes, and the ball he makes in his chair is just too limber and flexible to be fair, from a man in his late twenties that takes better care of his violin than he does himself. His bright eyes are staring blindly straight through John, long fingers bouncing against his knees, that clever mouth twitching.
Sherlock does not want breakfast, and he does not want a shower.
Sherlock, still slumped and unhappy behind him, just about submerged all the way into his glass of water, ended up making the decision for him.
John has no idea what the hell he's meant to do.
He just... he needed Sherlock to hear it. Not just to realise that what Oscar had done to him had been abuse, he realised, but to hear about his marriage, too. He wanted Sherlock to know because he didn't want to keep secrets. He didn't want to found a relationship,
"Of course not. There are a dozen unknown variables outside of my control that I have no ability to reasonably predict. It could be anything from a suggestion for a case or asking if I've got immunity to varicella, because Rosie picked it up at daycare. I am immune, by the way." He smiled again, very slightly, relaxing all the way back into his chair. "I'm a scientist, John. Not a psychic."
He was so tired. And he had been for so long.
and was never going to contact him again?
"It's that easy. Just like that."
"No."
"Sherlock?"
"Oh, I couldn't possibly, dear. Not something as hard to take care of as that!"
His phone buzzes again a few moments later.
He still
there it
John." He squeezed his eyes shut, counting to ten. Wasn't sure why. It was something Normal People did, to calm down. All it meant was it was now ten seconds later.
It had taken a while, for the lighthearted teasing to turn into mocking. And it had taken John even longer to realise it for what it was. But that was what it had been. Mocking. Mocking the blog, mocking the cases, mocking Sherlock. Once or twice, even right in front of him, and with John in the room. But Sherlock, after being so used to Anderson and Donovan brazenly calling him a freak right there to an audience of the world at crime scenes, hadn't quite picked up on it; John had seen it on his face at the time. Mary had once commented that John was perfectly prepared for a newborn to be screaming and snotting all over him at the slightest inconvenience, but that at least
He starts to straighten up. To curl his gloved hand to hammer a fist against the nearest wall, or wave his hand, or perhaps just dance like a trained monkey to get their attention, because he doubts whether anything else will even work.
"I'm so worried about you," John murmurs to him, his voice hushed underneath the spray. He doesn't think Sherlock can hear him at all. He thinks Sherlock is still lost in his own head and that's the only reason he says it, cradling his hair and forehead pressed to his. "You have no idea, do you? You don't think I pay attention but I do. I'm so worried about you but I can't read your mind, Sherlock. I know it's not fair to ask you to do any more than you already are but god, love. What do I do? What... what do you need from me?"
which makes no sense at all. Mycroft, thank god, has had the good sense to keep his mouth shut.
Well, he's not exactly wrong, is he?
Thank you all so much for all the comments/kudos, and for the well wishes- I do feel a bit better now :D And another quick thank you to the amazing J_Baillier for helping me out with NHS procedure here, because my training is American and I wanted to be accurate!

than Sherlock knows what to do with.
A very big part of John wanted to just...
He picks up the pace, now intent only on getting out to the kerb to start on his way back home. It's only been two hours. That's all. Just a bit over two hours, that's not bad, that's not bad at all. Sherlock knows how long A&E can take, and he's not an idiot, surely he's deduced all that's happened for himself-- he has to have! In fact, John is going to rush back home to find Sherlock sitting there in his armchair, sipping a cup of tea, all smug and proper, watching John with a raised eyebrow that just about says out loud
John doesn't need an explanation to be on his feet himself. The dishes are all piled quickly up in the sink and he's only just starting to toe his shoes on when Sherlock bounds back through the flat, Belstaff swishing and his face still glowing as a little boy with a puppy. He claps his hands again, all but bouncing up and down and vibrating from head to toe, and--
He hates this.
But John insists on an answer, he always insists that Sherlock answer him, and he slides his hand to his chest to trace a check mark.
are? This, none of this has changed
"Mhmm."
"Ah," Francis sighs, the confusion fading. "Well, I can hardly be insulted, Scott-- I'd find a dog easier to talk to than a therapist as well." He allows for another weighty pause, observing Sherlock very closely. "Do you think it might help you, if we had a dog here? Animal therapy is a supported practice, and can be very productive for some patients."
collection of all that is
"Okay."
"You want me to Skype you?" he tried, and without much hope at all. "We've done it before. And I wouldn't mind--"
Sherlock settles back, the tablet in his hands and an ache making its home even deeper in his chest, and decides that this must be what contentment feels like.
The pictures themselves are of two men, both older than John, and both very resolutely dead. He's sure there are any number of deductions to be made about who they are and how they got that way, from the bruises on their faces, the short, military hair, the bloody fold of the sheet. John doesn't care. For a perverse moment, he wonders if Mycroft could get an arm or a foot for Sherlock to experiment on to his heart's content.
The entire room, just about, blinks together as one. Even Sherlock manages to stop panting, his upset ground to a halt with shock instead.
"I can't do this halfway, either," Sherlock said quietly, after almost a minute of silence. He spoke very suddenly and very softly, his eyes dropped back down to his lap. "I do take it seriously. I want..."
John to fuck off.
s... allowed. Isn't it. John drinks, he can't get mad at this, I--" There were a few scrapes, Sherlock trying to walk or perhaps just working his feet over the ground. "I hate when he drinks, Mycr... Mycr. It makes him miserable. I wish he wouldn't. Why do we do things that make us misera, miserable, Mycroft, I don't-- 'ld've jus gotten a
Then, he tore it open with one ragged rip, and shook the contents out onto his lap.
So he sounds dreadful, and he plays for John anyway, and every night, feels just a little bit lighter.
Yes, yes, he

-- and that means giving him the space to be that. A few weeks with an overpriced therapist at a clinic on the beach is not going to fix this."
Well, Sherlock still doesn't know what this is about, but he'll never turn down the opportunity to interrupt Mycroft's schedule of machinating and scheming.
Tell him to do it!" John covered his mouth again, his fingers digging together just to stop himself from slamming a hand into the nearby table or wall. Because wasn't that how he'd gotten into this mess in the first place? Not being able to stop himself from hitting something?

Whatever. He skypes Molly.
"Mummy asked that I check up on you, of course. She worries."
Sherlock heads out of the office, his hands buried deep into his pockets and his face tucked into his scarf. On impulse alone, he bins the scrap of paper meant for the cabbie, on which he had already written
If Sherlock were in any other state, John wouldn't have felt comfortable with it. It's

The way he
Sherlock takes a deep breath, and hands across the prepared scrawl to the waiting psychologist.
Irene Adler died in a fire, and Sherlock identified desecrated body on Christmas morning.
One step forward, and three steps backward.
Sherlock's lips twitched, and he nodded stiffly once, keeping his mouth shut. A moment later he started to bite at his nails, picking like he wished he could stick a cigarette in there instead.
This wasn't right at all. This wasn't--

incredible.
He'd stitch what needed stitches, he'd deliver antibiotics for infections that needed stamping out- he'd even left the door open for having an oxygen set-up delivered, should Sherlock ever contract a severe cause of pneumonia, bronchitis, or the plague. But he wouldn't treat head injuries. Not before Sherlock had been bullied into accepting an examination at A&E, all to confirm that he wasn't
John watches him quietly, his eyes unreadable. They almost gleam in the monitor's glow, and in that eerie green backlight, he looks desperately unhealthy and sallow.
"Can you define normal, Scott?"
Ella again cleared her throat. She was still carefully neutral, like a good therapist should be, but right now, the professionalism didn't help. He wanted someone to shout at him. He wanted to be blamed. He needed someone to tell him
stay out of trouble." He coughed again, his voice low. "Nice... plant. Thing."
"It's not how it sounds," he said finally, his voice hoarse. Once again, it took him unforgivably long to find his words at all. "That's not Sherlock's fault. It wouldn't be like this if I hadn't..."
Potentially one of the biggest understatements of this side of the century.
"This is..." Sherlock licked his lips, his mouth gone suddenly dry. He looked up at John, another thudded heartbeat sounding in his ears.
Sherlock's deduction, of course, had been spot on. Only a few moments after they'd heard the door open and shut downstairs, Greg appeared, stepping into the flat dressed as if he'd just come in from work. By the time, he was surely still on duty. "John," he started, grinning, "you're here, good," but Sherlock had already straightened up as if electrified.
defend yourself, you--"
Sherlock was right, anyway. He always was. John wasn't an alcoholic, no matter what Mycroft thought-- he didn't crave it, like Sherlock did those chemicals to inject in his veins right now. He could stop himself when he'd had enough. But Sherlock was still right. What did he get out of pouring himself half a bottle of whiskey, what did he
John keeps talking anyway. He explains to Sherlock where he is, what's happening to him, and the smaller, easier details of what is going on. He reads off the names of all the medications that are dripping in to him right at this moment, and recites every last detail that he can remember about them all. He reads his chart, and he describes the scans that are in the file, and the surgeries they did to him, and what every piece of his vitals means.
"Good," he reassures, when Sherlock's bright eyes finally focus. He still won't look at John, and his face is reddening by the second, so John returns his attentions to his arm, trying to give him those few moments. "It's all right. You just got a little rattled, is all. But you're okay now. Yes?" He squeezes Sherlock's good hand again, giving him something to hold onto. "Just take it easy for a bit, Sherlock. You're all right."
"And just what the
"John, I've told you many times, if you persist in speaking with a cultural vernacular, you're going to have to retain a translator."
It's silly and boring, is what it is. Sherlock only needs to stall for just a minute or two, until John notices he's gone missing and tears off around the corner looking for him, thereby giving Lestrade a convenient assault to witness. Sherlock could end the fight in one hit, but that would rather defeat the whole point, so he lets himself get roughed up a bit, instead. An angry elbow gets into his ribs, but it's the ice underfoot that is his true humiliation. His ankle twists underneath him and

His words trailed uselessly off into nothing, collapsing underneath something that was so miserable, so
He closes his eyes, shaking his head to himself as he turns his back, rubbing his temples in the kitchen. He hates that book. But doesn't Sherlock hate this, too? He blows it off with arrogant waves of his hand and playing the role of a smug little shit, but this isn't Sherlock. That bundle of blankets on the sofa has never been something Sherlock would willingly do.
"Sherlock!" John looks at himself in the Skype call's mirror, unable to help it, and-- come on. The shirt is not
Okay.
John was even more lost than before. The only saving grace was that Mycroft didn't seem to be finding any drugs as he tore his way through the flat, but that was the smallest mercy that there was, barely a pinprick of a balm underneath the churning confusion. What the hell was going on?
His mouth moves again. John takes this as a yes and moves quickly, snatching up a cup of ice chips to push even closer, very gently nudging one at his mouth. "Sorry," he murmurs, "no liquids just yet. You don't even know what I'm saying, do you, love? You're high, god. It's okay. Let us take care of you, Sherlock. It's going to be okay."
He didn't have time to waste here, forming a deduction about why on earth John would insist on feigning interest in something as dull and mundane as a GP conference.
The Broca's area is associated with speech production. It has been their first guess for a culprit, in why Sherlock is suddenly unable to speak.
John hates the bloody book. He doesn't even know where the hell it came from. One day, they got home from hospital, Sherlock hobbling under his arm up the stairs and so horrifyingly

whatever it is that stops him from speaking what he wants, it's stopped him from writing it, too.
He shakes his head again, panting and desperate. He lets John hold his arm and swipes at his eyes with the other, rubbing his sleeve over his face, each breath a wince and a whimper. It hurts more than John can take. "What's
Francis smiles again, likely sensing the end of this discussion that has already been laid in stone. "That's enough of that, then, I think," he says, sitting back in his seat. "Let's move on. How has the violin been coming?"
He's no good at this. Perhaps he never was to begin with but John used to have the patience to put up with it, and then Sherlock made him watch him step into open air and he doesn't care to bother with it anymore.
Mycroft spat, and John flinched.
John shrugged back, at least a little in sympathy. Prevailing wisdom was probably that Sherlock deserved it, and the longer he had to last through the withdrawal, the likelier he'd be to resist the urge to use again the next time it came. But the look on Sherlock's face was just a little bit
Mrs. Hudson moves away to continue her fussing, setting the bowl down and straightening up the kitchen and in general being his housekeeper. "Oh, this is so
"Yes," he rasped. "Thai is fine."
"J'hn terrifies me, Mycroft. I can't-- Oscar makes me sick. I can't stand him. I d-don't, don't care what he says about me, what he thinks. But John--" Sherlock stuttered in another heavy breath, his words stumbling. He was barely intelligible at this point and John clutched the phone closer, biting his tongue.
It's quiet for several moments again. John is standing military-straight and silent, his hands curling into fists at the counter, breaths a measured, angry pace. "Handle the problem," he repeats flatly. "You mean kill Magnussen."
If ever there was a time, it would be now. But he can't even open his mouth. Earlier he'd at least gotten past that step; now he can't even make it that far. He
He thought about John.
And this was how things were
As the two go on, the pieces click in John's head. Sherlock had been trying to talk about the crime scene, before. That was what he had been trying so hard to say, and so angry and upset that he hadn't been understood.
Sarah, calling his name? Telling him to wake up?
"It was transparent," he called out, waving a hand blindly to the room at large. "No need to feel guilty, John; I was aware of the ruse the moment you first appeared. Don't be ridiculous."
"Hmm, yes. Quite." Mycroft sighs deeply, again lost in thought. "We tell people it was a family pet, but Redbeard was adopted as a puppy when Sherlock was a baby, and Sherlock was mostly the one to take care of him. We did not relate well to other children, as I'm sure you can imagine-- for ten years, Redbeard was Sherlock's closest and only friend."
"I don't nitpick. I am
"It's okay," he promises, a stern grip on his arm. "Come on, over here. Another deep breath, Sherlock; with me. That's it. Perfect..."
They will find a way on from today, and it will not be with anything Sherlock's sodding brother has to offer.
"She saved your life after nearly taking it from you," he said. Once again, he had to wait to speak until he could wrestle his voice back into something that approached calm. "She... she
He snatches it free, and at Sherlock's outraged face holds it up higher, daring him to get to his feet to grab it back. "You are going to sit there and eat at least three of those biscuits before you faint onto the damn floor. Then you are going to get up, and let me help you through your physiotherapy, which is what you

John turns, feeling as if his feet are stuck in wet cement.
"I said no," he said again, voice suddenly low. "I don't take cases at Cambridge."
Character A: FOUR MONTHS
"The game," he says, "is back on."
He nodded warmly, but it wasn't until he'd stepped back an inch and withdrew from his face that Sherlock could breathe again.
Then, he drew himself up to his full height, and more confident than he'd ever been in his
Victor was the worst student on the floor. What other explanation could there be, for why a professor would be speaking to him like that?
"Okay," he rasps. His voice sounds utterly wrecked and miserable, and he really doesn't know why Sherlock is so shaken at John seeing him cry, because he's not exactly doing much better himself and Sherlock can hear it and see it right there in front of him. "Okay. That's... thank you. Thank you for telling me, Sherlock."
And as easy and amazing and
All right,
Which is why he's now popping in on Lestrade in the waiting room for A&E, and Lestrade, perhaps coincidentally, looks like he wants to turn around, call in sick, and not leave his flat for the rest of the week.
Sherlock's eyes flicker dangerously, searching between John and the open door behind him. John starts to move back, thinking he wants him to shut the door, but catches sight of the spilled IV pole on the floor instead. It was taped securely in, and with Sherlock's hands bandaged so heavily, and the one arm entirely out of commission, he hadn't been able to tear it out. It was dragged in here with him and tumbled on the floor, the medication drip stalled without gravity to help it down.
Sherlock is not listening. Sherlock can not hear him, and even if he could, a conversation is clearly far away from what he's capable of right now.

. Sexually attracted to other men. Not interested in Irene Adler, or women in general, in any romantic or sexual manner. G-A-Y.
The evening passes Sherlock by with John watching the news on low volume and typing up the start of this case. The ones that involve celebrities (other than Sherlock) always do fantastically well, and the ad revenue from the blog is starting to be a bit incredible. They're easier to write up nowadays, too; it makes his stomach hurt a bit to admit it, but if he really has to look for the silver lining, it's that he no longer has to ask Sherlock to walk him through his leaps of logic five plus times once a case is over. They're all written down already, step by step for the Yard to follow, and all John has to do is copy them down.
It was a bluff, actually. It was a bluff, albeit one that he wished he meant with every fiber of his being, but a bluff all the same. He wouldn't do that to Sherlock, not without his consent, and he knew he would never get it. But it was the bluff that was important. Whatever he could do, to make sure this piece of shit knew to
"My emergency contact?" John frowns, his unsteady steps faltering again. "My--"
But they were rare, and there was no excuse for one to go untreated so for long that it turned into emergency hospitalization. Sherlock would've been experiencing stomach pain and nausea for months. It would've hurt to eat, it would've hurt not to eat, and he would've been throwing up enough that somewhere in that genius brain of his, he would've

He hadn't understood it at all, when investigating the lady in pink and the baby she'd lost years and years before. At the look on John's face, he doesn't want to understand it now.
He wants to be more than an addict smoking in an alley who can not speak.
this was going nowhere. He tried to sift through the words as best he could, to try and keep Sherlock's privacy while at the same time get an answer. Because he knew he could trust Greg, but he still didn't know what
and he can feel that awareness in the way Sherlock vibrates behind him, the tense trembling of a string pulled so taut it's about to snap. He can feel how frightened Sherlock is, not just of Mycroft but of John siding with him, and that's enough for John to know he's made mistakes with this. He's made mistakes, pushing too hard on this point, and he's made mistakes talking about it with Mycroft behind Sherlock's back.
"You should've told him to piss off. No one asked for him to be

Sherlock inhales deeply, head tilted back against the shabby wall. The only warmth there is to be had is the cancer stick between his fingers. The wind and the ground are biting cold, and the rubbish around him is of no comfort to anyone.

"Here we go," John murmurs, softer now, giving Sherlock's clenched hand a light squeeze. "We'll be home soon. Come on."
It's sustainable, what they have. Sherlock no longer limps. He no longer winces when he inhales too deeply, and he is no longer so deeply unsettled when someone touches him unawares that it shows on his tense face. He did all the physical therapy that they asked, though it was a bit like pulling teeth, and now he can bend and straighten his arm again without difficulty. He eats as well as he can. He sleeps as well as he can. He does both, and John has just given up on figuring out how much of what he still can not do is because of trauma, and how much of it is just in how Sherlock's massive brain has always worked and always will. He takes cases, and he still beams with sheer ecstasy at the gift of a nice murder, and he knows the pulse of London's beating heart.
2012-2014: Sherlock exists inside John, and John exists inside him. Sherlock nests himself in John's arms and this is okay. He'll never need to go again. For two years they exist in each other's arms and it's boring, it's tedious, it's stupid, but Sherlock doesn't
His phone is silent for several more minutes.
"...When we found him," Mycroft murmurs. He glances at John once, a pointed, needling look, and then down the corridor again, his grim expression softening as he looks towards his little brother's room. His hands clench together, and he looks almost ill. "You say that you read his chart, John? I'm sure that you do not need me to explain to you the condition he was in. You're a doctor. You can fill in the dots."
Sherlock huffs, looking outright scandalised. He repeats the motions even more aggressively than before, aggressive enough that it has to hurt, and Mycroft lets out a long-suffering sigh. "It was serendipitous, believe it or not. They were killed in a car crash on their way to what looks to be a small village on the coast, up north-- mostly retirees. My office repossessed the files when their descriptions were entered into the system."

Sherlock hummed an affirmation, the razor back against his skin. John did the math again-- Sherlock probably would've been in his mid-twenties, then. It was... a bit of an age difference, sure. But things had been different back then, hadn't they? It certainly seemed to have ended amicably enough, anyway. For Oscar to have been hugging him and giving him his card and... saying he'd

up off the floor right then and there. "What are you doing?"
John is so furious it takes two tries for him to even hear Lestrade at all, and he still does not care. He does not care that he just assaulted an officer right in front of Lestrade and he does not care that he wants to do it again. He wants to make him feel every bit of pain and fear that he just did to Sherlock.
"From what I've been able to find out, Sherlock is simply one of many students that Dr. Wilson had already repeated this pattern with. He took on vulnerable students like Sherlock, vulnerable but gifted students, and he abused their desire for praise to get as much work out of them as he could. He might've even genuinely liked them. But after years of stress and overwork and an abusive relationship, those affections began to turn very cold, very fast, when their work began to suffer for it. And when they wore out his affections and could no longer meet his standards, he got rid of them."
And Ella finally cleared her throat, and spoke up again.
"Do you know why Sherlock was so resistant about coming to Cambridge, the other day?"
and not even Sherlock has enough control over his brain to turn it off for a full eight hours, but he still lies down like a good, normal, proper human being and he shuts his eyes for at least a few hours, every day. Even on a case! It's a waste of time and it's hideous but he does it, he does it even when he wakes up with a scream caught in his chest but never in his throat, and John obviously knows he hates it, but what else is he meant to do? He can't turn the nightmares off. He's

, sitting here, kissing, touching. But they were idiots, and he wasn't going to listen to what they thought. No. This was normal.
"No, I just--" But he was right, of course. Sherlock had gotten clean before, for two, three week stretches, but it was always only ever so Greg would let him in on a case, and with no disguising the fact that he would be sauntering right back into a crackhouse the moment it was done. This was the first time Sherlock had ever said he was trying to actually get clean for good.
Sherlock made anther face and sat back, and this time, he actually did look

Sherlock had already said he forgave him, without reservation or hesitation. Maybe Ella was right after all, that this went deeper than what John had done, but into why Sherlock had been and was so willing to let him. And as much as John hated it, maybe the best he was going to get was Sherlock making an effort to pretend he hadn't forgiven it the moment John's fist had collided with his cheek. Maybe asking him to accept he'd been hurt by one of his only real friends was just one step too far to ask of him. Especially right now, when he was still in pain and hurting and reeling after one of the worst periods of their lives.
Bosco breathes heavily. He gives his face another lick.

But the words must be ill-advised, because John suddenly looks like he wants to clank his mug down again, to be loud and angry and shout at Sherlock. He breathes through his nose instead, the vein his neck throbbing- and it seems this night is going to be an unfortunate one after all.
"She hit her head on the way down, and ended up just... lying there. It actually wasn't that serious, but I was twelve, I didn't know that head wounds just bleed like that-- all I knew was that Harry wasn't moving and her face was just covered in blood. Dad was still shouting and Mum was crying, and I was just standing there and I really thought he'd fucking killed her. Mum told me to get in a cab with Harry and go to A&E, to say that she fell, and I was scared to death so I did."
It had been transparent, truly. Obviously. Thinking back on it now- it was Moriarty's playbook exactly, speaking to him through another's voice, playing the game one step ahead. It had been so

"The graduate student before Sherlock dropped out of university when it happened to him. Five years of research, and just before he was meant to have his final hearing, Dr. Wilson submitted his main project for publication, without his name on it. Mr. Trevor had nothing to present as his own, had just had his future career smashed to bits, and had no defense for it-- not unless he wanted his sexuality, career-ending in and of itself, to be outed to the entire committee."
"Oh..." he drawled, hunting somewhat pathetically for the words. "I'm... sure it's not as difficult as you'd think."
"He didn't do this for himself, he did it for me! He was trying to help me!"
"I am angry," he said, when he could be sure he could at least get the words out calmly. "But I'm not angry at you."

violin, his notes and scales that he has spent decades carving into his head, his bow, his music. And now he can't touch it.
Every move he makes feels so crushingly loud in the quiet.
The moments slid by. Sherlock counted them in each loud thud of his heart, and nothing changed. Oscar kept rubbing him, and Sherlock just sat there and didn't know what he was supposed to do back. He wanted an instruction manual, a class syllabus with point by point instructions on what exactly he was supposed to do, the faces he was supposed to make, how he was supposed to act. But there wasn't one, and Sherlock was pretty sure if he was handed one at this point it wouldn't even be helpful, because clearly he'd done something wrong about twenty steps ago if he'd somehow made his way to here.
So John makes himself up a bed in the
"Sherlock, you're scaring Molly. Deep breath, now. Right now."
John's worry just about broke the sound barrier.
"That was good of Victor," John said, squeezing Sherlock's fingers again. It was a battle to keep the words calm, but he did it because he knew the last thing that would help right now was letting him see just how angry he was. "That still doesn't make you stupid."
It was just Sherlock being Sherlock, John told himself. That was all. He'd seen Sherlock like this before after all, hadn't he? He could sulk when he didn't get exactly his way, and pout out the window like a child. It didn't mean something was wrong.
then that's the only boost that he'll need.
Sherlock's brain sputtered on the off switch.
It is also an inescapable, incontrovertible fact, that this is not enough.
Shut the fuck up, don't you
"You," Sherlock said, very quietly, "are an ephebophilic narcissist that inflicts your attractions on barely legal students so your poor wife doesn't find out. You are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and you should count yourself very, very lucky that
Donovan smiles tightly back, sitting on her heels. "My sister was born deaf," she says to John, clearly not an invitation to inquire more, and turns her gaze back down to Sherlock.
He takes five seconds to just sit there at the foot of the stairs, swallowing against his hand, and trying not to weep.
Or they would be, if Scotland Yard had ever heard of a filing system.
"Thanks," he rumbles, then coughs, making a face. "Sherlock Holmes, making me tea. And I can't even enjoy it. Worst day of my life."
The only spot of color on his face was the red mark on his lip. "Why should I have wanted that?"
He tucked a notebook into his lap, and started to read.
It has been long enough that the milk might just have spoiled, when Sherlock staggers himself up to his full height.
What?
There is nothing for John to say, to this. Nothing that Sherlock would want him to say, at any rate, and so he says nothing. He kisses Sherlock and lets Sherlock kiss him back, and this,
It's the same uncertain feeling from before. The same disbelief that's dogged him for months, that his life could ever mean that much to John Watson. The way he forgets it, over and over, because he doesn't understand why it does and he doesn't understand why John is here.
"I'm sorry," John landed on finally, his voice low, as neutral as he could. "Of course you can... have feelings like that. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. I'd just never see you be interested in anyone at all until Irene Adler, and then never anyone else after her, and I... assumed. I'm sorry."
"Jealous? Yes." He sucked his lip between his teeth, trying very hard to wrangle the words into something calm and in control. "That's actually why I brought it up. I wanted to make sure that was... all it was."
It's just that that limit is not at throwing his own voice away, but instead at reclaiming it back.
"Yes. Yes, it's me. It's me, Sherlock."
He spends a lot more time in the palace, these days. Whether there's a case or not, whether he has a puzzle that he can't solve or not. John supposes he can't begrudge him that. If he'd had a mind palace, after Afghanistan? A place where his shoulder and his leg didn't hurt, and he was free to do whatever he wanted without having anyone there to watch him fail?
When Sherlock clearly didn't care? When
, I-- oi! Sherlock!"
"You bugger. How'd you know that?"
Mycroft frowned again, his dangerous, veering onto a threat sort of frown. He curled his hands together in the same habit of Sherlock's, the fingers tight and white-knuckled. "He showed up three days after I did looking like a drowned rat, and clearly had no idea I had been waiting for him the entire time. He had, instead, been looking after Dr. Wilson's lab during the storm. Certainly not of his own accord, alone in a locked building with the power cut off, while Dr. Wilson himself relaxed at home." He made another face, a cold fury building back behind his eyes. "It was apparent just from the state of his room that he was in over his head, and looking at him made it even more so. He was too anxious to properly eat or sleep, and was working fifteen hour days to try and make Dr. Wilson happy. It likely speaks volumes that he chose to sleep alone at lab rather than accept Dr. Wilson's offer to stay with him."
Sherlock's mouth pulled down, flattening into a small, severe frown. He rocked gently for a moment, back and forth in the creaky, uneven chair, like he was swaying to a beat that only he could hear.
He strokes John from base to tip, watching the turn of his flushed face and oh,
Well. They are normal. He is not. He can do things that none of the idiot masses could ever
No. No, he can imagine not.
Dr. Andrews blinked, his turn around back to welcoming instantly put back on ice. Clearly, he had expected to find some sort of camaraderie, in dealing with the eccentric and impolite Sherlock Holmes. Equally as clear was that he wasn't used to being stood up to. "Oh-- no, it's not like that. I'm sorry, Dr. Watson," he assured, and had the bloody gall to
"Hmm. No. He didn't." Mycroft smiled, very slightly. But it barely looked like a smile at all, and he folded his hands behind his back with a look on his face that lowered the room's temperature by ten degrees. "You assumed that he was. And he let that assumption pass without being challenged."
for him to hear. "You were incredibly unhappy, John, and while some of those feelings might've been related to how you felt about Sherlock, the root cause of it was that you were married to a woman that didn't care about you. You've said yourself that you felt ignored, belittled, and brushed aside. You didn't feel that she ever took you seriously, and you've said that if it hadn't been for Rosie and Sherlock's encouragement, that you'd never have gone back to her. You've also said that you wished you hadn't." She paused for another long moment, her eyes kind. "That doesn't sound like a happy or healthy marriage, John."
Well, John figures, if Sherlock doesn't need to be minded today? Then he'll be glad to comply. All Sherlock has to do is speak up and say so, and John will give him whatever it is he asks for.
A hesitant warmth roots in his chest, unfolding just enough to make his mouth want to smile. He blinks back instead, his throat closed, and John gives him another grin that is almost delirious in its level of contentment.
That night he had been the most remarkable, fantastic diva that John had ever met. Tonight he's had nightmares for three nights in a row, and John knows about every one. That night, John had moved in because all he'd wanted was a breath of fresh air, and Sherlock had given him a car chase through half of London. Tonight he's kissing John at the foot of the stairs because the cold makes his leg hurt if he stands for too long. That night, John had taken one look at him and stayed, because Sherlock was

has the look of someone who has been wide awake for the entire night. There's even the textbook in his lap, the last necessary piece of the all-night cramming puzzle... or it would've been, if John didn't already know that Sherlock's entire existence was the oscillation between all-night cramming and crashing.
Why hasn't he said anything yet?
He looked at Oscar, at his split lip and smug face and the smarmy way he dabbed at the scrape, and there was
"It is. I know." He kissed the side of Sherlock's head, breathless, almost dizzy; he felt it too. Christ, it was
John squinted after him, still in complete shock. "A
Never again. He would never let himself do something like this again.
Mycroft's eyes widened minutely. He did not display his surprise with any more than that, but John was already turning away, grabbing for his jacket and shoes as fast as he could. "Sherlock called you, and not me, for a reason. He trusts you more than me right now."
This is not
"She probably knew that. She probably knew that you didn't love her anymore. That you might have been able to forgive her for lying to you, but not for hurting Sherlock, and that you never would." She set her notes aside again to look at him without any other distractions, because this was

the proof that he can still have his work. He can still be who he is.
His hand is then yanked back as if burned, and John's next words are a soft, muted sort of apology.
John was what? What had John done to him that was
John kisses him again, his smile imprinting warmth into Sherlock's skin, and when he reels back he's crying. He's
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock kept his smile forcibly arranged, twisted and fake and dragged through molasses. It felt like he was chewing glass. "If you truly insist, then perhaps-"
"It's... it's really nothing," Greg said again. But it was a transparent lie and he still wouldn't look at John. He flicked the turn signal and stared hard at the road and
John pours himself a cup of tea, and this time, doesn't bother to pour a second. If Sherlock gives some indication that he wants one, he'll make it, but every cup he's given that bleary-eyed blanket burrito over the past few days has been left almost entirely untouched. He sits down at the kitchen table instead, his back turned firmly to the rest of the room.
He can do this. He is Sherlock Holmes. He can, as John tells him, do
"He hit my mum, a lot. And he knew we all hated him, so he drank more. The more he drank, the more he hit her, and the angrier he got. Harry was three years older than me, so I don't really remember any better times-- I've just got my dad being an arsehole, and my mum letting him. Harry would make me hide in her closet if it was really bad. I got a lot of homework done in there."
Oh, John. A swing and a miss.

Experiments will only keep a restless Sherlock occupied for so long, and they passed that line more than several weeks ago, well before he was in any sort of state to go leaving the flat. Now Sherlock is suffocatingly bored, and looks at his microscope look like it has just personally insulted his mother. Or his coat. He is angry, his face furious and his temper on a knife's edge, and he stomps around the flat and doesn't sleep or eat or speak. He turns away private clients, because he proclaims that his brain rots into mush in the time it takes John to translate out one sentence of what he wants to say. He is in constant pain.
Mrs. Hudson, he tries to say. The neck of his violin suddenly bites into the grip of his fist, his blood howling in his ears and his heartbeat underneath it. Mrs. Hudson. I--. Mrs. Hudson. Wait. Stop. Mrs. Hudson.

Sherlock tried again.
Sherlock struggles. Sherlock has to be dragged through the slightest inconvenience with a toddler's level of kicking and screaming. Sherlock is, to his very core, a fighter.
They should probably move apart, now.
do you realise that? If I'd kicked you too hard? If you'd hit your head the wrong way?" He wanted to reach out to him, to take his rough face in his hands and shake him,
"--yeah, yeah," Greg chuckled, grinning, "and it's his area of expertise, really. It's a senior professor of chemistry at Oxford."
"You know, show the public that you're up and running again, taking cases after everything that happened with Culverton Smith. As long as you start out slow-- you're not really up for doing much more than taking a look at the scene." He paused, still gently trying to coax him forwards. It felt a little like he was trying to cajole a wild horse with a carrot. "And Greg's right. We were both getting pretty bored, locked up in the flat... god, we were actually talking about our
"How'd you know that? How'd--?" John started to his feet, craning his neck as if he might be able to see out the window from here. Sherlock looked even more smug. "You hear the car outside? You never can resist showing off, can you...?"
It hadn't failed at all. Christ, was that what he thought? Why was he so eager to spin everything around into being his own fault? The experiment hadn't failed, Sherlock hadn't failed, the premise had just been flawed from the very start. He... he was such a mad
"You are. You're angry." He giggled again, and John's worry spiked.
"Do you think you might need a bit of a break, Sherlock?"
He leads the way right out of the room and from where Sherlock sits silently, cold-eyed but increasingly ashen-faced as his physician had described the risks of what he was ordering Sherlock to sign off to. "Sherlock Holmes is one of the most intelligent, resourceful people on this bloody
"Oh." No, Sherlock didn't remember. Must've deleted it- obviously; why would he bother to archive something like this? No matter. Irrelevant. "You won't go, obviously. Now we've got a case!"
Sherlock's head nodded again, still without looking up.
John had done to him, it still wouldn't help. Sherlock would physically go to a therapist's office and make an appointment and stand up and walk inside, sure. But he wouldn't take it seriously, that wasn't something even Sherlock could force himself to do, and if he didn't take it seriously it'd be a waste of time. He'd sit there spending the hour deducing the therapist, then skip off and snag some Chinese on the way home.
. He gulps up soup with unnecessary vehemence, just to loudly slurp over the phone. He hopes Mycroft is scandalized. "If you're done keeping my doctor awake during his dinner break, then? Go on, run along and make yourself useful, now.

He can not be anything less than in control. And he hates that, because it's not what he

He doesn't have it framed (yet). Instead, Sherlock makes tea with honey, and texts Mrs. Hudson that John is ill, and he makes even more tea with honey. John sleeps. He makes more tea. Mrs. Hudson comes up with soup and pushes a warm bowl of it into his hands, with instructions on how to heat it up later and telling him it's sweet, how well he looks after John. He makes more tea with honey and throws it out and presses the heel of his hand to his chest and counts all the words that he can't say in the space of the silence.
Between the two of them, they manage to get a still resistant Sherlock onto his feet. He is heavy and shaking on his feet, dependent on both of them to stay upright, and Donovan takes one look before beating a hasty retreat. She is willing to be cordial to Sherlock, but seeing him like this is clearly a step too far.
Is that a real thing? Do people do that? Is that something that people are able to do, or is that yet another idiomatic turn of phrase that makes no sense? He wishes he could ask John, but-- well, he'll google it later. If he remembers. He probably won't google it later.
"If your girlfriends only date you because they want to see if I'll remember their names, then I think you're setting yourself up for some extreme disappointment, John." His violin safely settled down and at rest, Sherlock spun back around to flop himself into his own armchair, balled up and curled to rest his chin on his knees and lock his arms tight. It was as secure nest of blankets and restlessness as he could manage, and it wasn't enough.
The silence lasts until they get to the lift, Lestrade stabbing the button like it said something terribly offensive. Sherlock sulks, still working to get his breaths under control, and would rather prefer just melting into the floor to never get up again.

Sherlock clearly wasn't up to anything more and John didn't want to be either. He didn't want anything other than this right here.
She barely offers up a half-hearted shrug, the muffin passed from hand to hand and her mouth turned down. "I really would've appreciated him letting me know before tonight." She claims the side of his bed- Sherlock is currently taking up space in the room's only chair, half-asleep through a livestream of a forensics conference in France- and then. Then she just
"You're the one who disappeared, not me! I came back from my honeymoon, you knew the date, you booked the bloody plane tickets, and
Today, John doesn't know if there will be one at all. But if there is, he's not fucking taking it.
Sherlock swirls around the crime scene as effervescent as ever, his coat billowing after every step and his curls bouncing in a boyish charm. He looks wide-awake and so excited on a Saturday morning it should, quite frankly, be criminal. It will forever be the oddest parallel for John to experience, because-- because
John hated him. But this man had never hit Sherlock. Not once. This man had never thrown him down onto the cold, metal floor, feeling his ribs crack under his foot, and then just turned around and walked away. John had given up any right he'd ever had to have that Sherlock the day he'd wrote that fucking letter. He still could scarcely believe it that Sherlock even allowed him to be his friend at all.
and what's worse is that they reveal nothing in the most stubbornly unhelpful of ways. They confirm that there is at least no blocked nerve or swelling contusion or TBI, but that just means they have to look deeper, and that's when they run into a brick wall. They have him in an fMRI and run him through the standard battery of questions, mapping cortical activity, but the map is utterly useless when there's nothing to compare it to.
On one hand, it actually wasn't all that unbelievable a story at all. The general contours of it matched Sherlock, very exactly. Skipping class and meetings, arrogant and unlikable; even dropping out before finishing his degree. A piece of paper wouldn't have mattered to Sherlock in the slightest-- John wouldn't have been surprised if he'd just gotten bored with jumping through administrative hoops and required english lit classes, decided he'd learned all that he wanted to from the program, and skipped out on the rest of term. It was the same rationale for not being surprised that they remembered Sherlock either not showing up to class at all, or strolling in the door to be the most arrogant bastard on campus. Sherlock sure as hell wouldn't have bothered to go to a class he wasn't getting anything out of, and even back then, John figured that Sherlock was so brilliant that most of his classes wouldn't have been worth his time.
He knew he didn't need to spell it out anymore. Sherlock was smart enough. He'd hear the parallel.
It was with much fumbling, rolling, and one very,
"Hmm," he sighs again. "Have dinner with me."
John strokes his hair and says, "I told you so,", but Sherlock gets a week-long couch cuddle out of it and as much tea as he likes, so who's the real winner, here?
"Hey!
Greg gaped at him.
again.
"--you've... what?"
Another spike of frustration stabs through him, joining the nervous twitching already in his hands and knotted in his stomach. He tears on straight through to a clean page, skipping ahead in his head without bothering to even address that first question.
He just
Polite enough, John thought. Certainly more pleased to see him than most of Sherlock's old associates tended to be.
is, at this stage. Maybe you're coming down with something." John started to withdraw and then stopped, going over Sherlock's words in his head. "Would that be since we took the Cambridge case, then?"
"You want to section Sherlock," he says numbly. Next to him, Sherlock stiffens, confirming the horrible truth of the words without any need for it from Mycroft himself. "Because Sherlock refuses to go of his own accord."
"Because if we're going to do this-- if we're going to have a romantic relationship-- then I think there are things that you need to know about me, so we can do this right. I can't do this halfway, Sherlock. This isn't just a fling, to me. I'm taking this seriously, I want this to work more than anything in my life, and to me, that means giving us both the tools to make it work. And yes, I'm quoting Ella, here, but she's shown that she knows what she's talking about, so... honesty. Communication. All that rubbish?" He tried giving Sherlock a grin, something to coax him out of his shell by seeing that John was on just as shaky ground as he was, here. "Maybe we should try giving

"You weren't supposed to be there. He wasn't supposed to ever touch you."
Scooped and scraped clean until he was empty and very, very numb. It was a similar experience to the grief that had taken root inside him when Sherlock had stepped off a rooftop and made John watch it happen, and for two years John had thought it had been his stupid, callous words
He just couldn't put his misgivings aside. He
He settled himself in, sore and exhausted himself, and prepared to face the music.
Then he lets Sherlock slip back down, and a moment later, rewraps his arms around him, one lying over his waist, the other tracing lines between the patterns down his spine. His arms are strong and warm and so, so
The next thing John knows, he's moaning on the floor of the surgery, Sarah kneeling over him sternly calling his name, trying to get him to open his eyes, and his head feeling as if it's about to split open. Bloody
With no answer forthcoming, John gave in to the urge to protect and stand up for Sherlock, because that was about the only thing left that he had. "Will you put that
John, very wisely, he thought, didn't press Sherlock for details.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow back. "You've known him long enough, John. Does it really surprise you to learn that his moods have never been stable?"
Sherlock has carefully sectioned off and segregated the devastated rooms in the mind palace. The scorched, blackened corridors have been moved, put to the back and out of the way, and the rooms inside them, with all his recorded information on words and conversation and language? He does not need those rooms. He's finished building alternate entrances now, that allow him to write and to text. That's enough for him.

had, had--
"That's right." John did shake his hand, but only just, and maybe he wasn't quite capable of Sherlock's ice cold and murderous smile, so he just went for his own best attempt instead. He wasn't a six foot tall not-a-sociopath, but he was just as capable of laying someone flat. "You have anything else you'd like to say about my partner?"
But that DVD was not the first time she had nearly gotten Sherlock killed. It wasn't even the first time Mary had
He signs furiously. He signs furiously and desperately in-between deep gasps and looking worse and worse when it is clear nobody can understand him.

with social anxiety, that are being bullied at school or abused at home, and who are young and lacking in a support system and unable to cope. Sherlock fits precisely none of the typical criteria to watch out for.
"I'm... sorry. You're not--"
then that was what he wanted.
He kisses John in a French restaurant.
Well. To be thoroughly exact, or quite possibly just pedantic, what he really wishes is that he just weren't like
Sherlock readied his plan to be rolled into motion the very first morning.
Because what would Sherlock do if he didn't extend the invitation? By the looks of him, Greg would probably leave for work in the morning and find him still keeled over on his front step. At the very least, Greg could make sure he had a warm, safe place to sleep tonight, and some biscuits or toast to eat in the morning.
After tonight.
Now looking a bit haughty himself, Dr. Andrews tugged on his tie, tightening the knot. "Then... I apologise for the slight." It didn't sound like all that genuine an apology. He started another step back, clearly not in the mood to stand here and be insulted by anyone that wasn't Sherlock. "I hope--"
Sherlock just stared at him, his brow furrowed now and his mouth sunk into a tiny, strained frown. But John knew what was behind his eyes, because he'd heard it the night before on that bloody call.
He's not sure he'd ever sincerely apologised for anything in his life, before meeting John. He's not sure he'd even grasped what such a thing could feel like until Moriarty had made good on his oath to burn the heart out of him.
Sherlock."
Yes, I know... a surprisingly few number of answers, for the first month. John and Mycroft actually don't have those answers yet, either, so they can't be provided here- but never fear! Because next chapter is another important one, where I deliver most of those answers that you've been asking for... :)
And John doesn't know whether or not that scares him.
"I've been somewhat reliably informed that I deserved your welcoming party, anyway."
Sherlock took in another small breath, his gaze flickering back downwards. His face was clouded and unreadable, and John wasn't sure what to do with it.
John's next protest caught in his throat.
"But you said--" He snapped his mouth shut, his white face flushing faintly pink. It was one of the more endearing things that John had ever seen, and he rolled his eyes back.
his lips dry and cracked and his hands shaking, but he kissed him. Oh,
"I did. And I'm confident that you'll be there for Sherlock if he should need it." She smiled at him again, a solid branch of encouragement. "John. You were so concerned that you were acting for your own interests instead of Sherlock's that you asked me to make sure you were doing the right thing. You were that worried about him, and that committed to being a better friend to him than you've been in the past. Regardless of all the reasons you gave me to be worried for Sherlock today-- you are not one of them."
he thinks, curling his fingers into Sherlock's hair.
But he couldn't say any of that because it came too close to
Hmm. Sherlock seems to be keeping a secret... I wonder what's going on that he hasn't let us and John in on :thinking:
and that was what it was. Mary could dress it up in fancy words if she wanted, telling him to
Sherlock," he started again, his voice weak. "That's--"
Sherlock frowned. "Only an idiot would walk into a door." His professor pulled the ice back a bit to get a better look, a severe grimace settled onto his face. "It was a junior getting out of class. Sebastian. I ran into him and deduced his girlfriend was cheating on him. She was wearing a pink jumper."
to do right by Sherlock and Rosie because they were all he had left.
John briefly squeezed his eyes shut, and pressed those thoughts out of his mind. It didn't matter how bad things were now, for either of them. What mattered was ensuring that they began tomorrow as a fresh start.
He sighs, burrowing deeper under the sheets for a moment. Just one soft, warm, addictive moment. The warmth is intoxicating, and the feeling is borderline criminal, when he has to slip his arm out just enough to palm his mobile and switch off the coming alarm. He stays curled up there in a warm, lax ball, just breathing in the sleepy light of early morning, slowly flexing each of his fingers to feel the stretch and ache in his shoulder.
But it is all in his own hand, beginning to end, a story of blue ink, cramping hands, and John's loose, warm arm nudging against his foot. It is
They could only help Sherlock as much as he was willing to help himself.
"It's okay," he promises by his ear, his fingers wrapping in his limp hair. "We're both okay, Sherlock. It's going to be okay."
And speaking of anyone who'd so much as look at him the wrong way...
Mycroft; you've never had one of those, isn't that so? No one wants to be friends with a fat, interfering, know-it-all like you, so of course you wouldn't understand what that's like!"
But John looks at Sherlock now-- how content he is.
"I thought he was a graduate student," he rasped. He closed his eyes for a moment, raking through every word of the last week in his head. "If I'd had any idea... he told me that he'd been involved with Dr. Wilson while in university, and I just assumed. I thought... twenty-five. Twenty-six. Not--"
Which was why it was so important that they do this right.
"...Right."
"Helpful as always, brother dear," Sherlock sneers, because John's not

Molly will be easier than Lestrade, of course. What was he thinking?
If he was asking Sherlock to be vulnerable, then John could give him the same.
Rolling onto his other side is beyond him. He shuts his eyes again instead, curled as much as he can manage. There's a persistent throbbing, right there, deep in the center of his chest, a throbbing and a heat, and he folds himself around it until it bleeds out everything else left in his head.
