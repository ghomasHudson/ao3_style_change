Tony had never felt more focused on anything then he did right now. It wasn't hard to fix the phone and it wouldn't take long, he was Tony Stark after all, but the way he was treating it felt like he was working on a suit. That's how much care and focus he put into it. He was driven by the thought of his kids; he wanted to know everything about them, and he wanted to know now. Tony Stark was many things, but patient was not one of them.
"I think they're on their way" it took only a second before Bucky sprung into action. Helping Steve stand up he practically dragged him to see Doctor Adia and if Steve wasn't in pain he'd laugh at the fact that he looked like a rag doll. She looked up surprised as Bucky practically threw the door open, and if it was a normal door Steve was sure it would come off the hinges.
"We'll figure it out. I want to be a part of their lives. If I have to come to Wakanda to see them so be it. Now, what would you say if I asked to stay in Wakanda for a few days instead of going home like I planned?" Steve grinned at Tony, happy beyond words.
"Ok, we'll go back to the tower and you can call it a night" of course Tony wouldn't call it a night for himself, but he would allow his friends to get some rest. Steve wondered if he would have to call a cab to take him home, or if H.Y.D.R.A would have a car ready for him, but was stopped as Tony faced him.
“No. There was an explosion at an abandon Roxxon power facility, 45 minutes ago. Friday is assisting with the situation. Unfortunately, I am unable to disclose any further details,” Karen the AI responded.
Of course, you’re probably enjoying my movie education as well as music education. Friday keeps supplying me with songs. Although, with the counselor and I running missions, I do have a lot of time to listen, mostly when traveling to various undisclosed locations. Since Talbot knows about me, we’ve been trying to keep an even lower profile than before. So I doubt that you’ll be seeing much about Nomad anytime soon. I bet you’re kind of happy about that.
“Because I don’t deserve forgiveness. I remember it. All of it. I remember everything that I did, every life I took. What I did to the Starks was the worst. I can still smell the blood. I hear their pleading. The sound of broken bones. I shouldn’t be forgiven.”
Tony Bear: I’m sorry that we couldn’t get you in the lunch. Even Yo-Yo is having sandwiches in the back with the other assistants. I’m sure they’re having more fun than me. As well as more food.
Tony: Although if Spidey is screwing around with his BFF, tThen they could be having you almost got killed by a super villain sex which happens sometimes. Also something I don’t want to interrupt.
Red spider: I know, but I need to play the game if I don’t want to be on the raft. You know I’m on parole now. After the debriefings, I must do a press conference as well.
Bruce has been the only one that talks to me, although May has sat in on all those meetings, usually focusing on her phone. She was greatly relieved when she found out that Laura was from the timeline created by Leo Fitz, a.k.a. James Leopold being tossed back in time nearly 2 years by the monolith. She seemed grateful to find out that Leo didn’t die; he just created a new timeline where Tony and Steve started speaking to each other again and Coulson is not terminally ill.
Tony turns off the soldering iron and sets it in its cradle. He looks about the workshop in a daze and decides sleeping would be more productive than whatever he’d been attempting (it had seemed important). “I’m calling it a night, JARVIS. Shut it down for me, would you?” Distantly, he wonders at the detachment in his voice.
The whole situation was so strange and eerie that Steve nearly missed the feeling of something touching his boot.
He sank into the seat Jan saved for him. The lecture hall was still filling with students, and the drone of voices filled the space, interspersed with bright spots of laughter.
Me: Possibly tomorrow. It depends. Look, me giving you big things isn’t that much of a deal. I mean the house in Malta actually cost a lot less than your gear, if I was billing the military for it anyway. For you, it’s a gift.
It’s also the perfect place to bring other Fitz, Coulson and the person Leo refers to as The Rider, a.k.a. Robbie Reyes, back from the dead. Well not dead, but they are sort of in between dimensional planes at the moment. The Princess explained it to him on the way, but he didn’t quite get it. It involved a lot of discussions about the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of matter as well as dimensional theory. It all gave him a bloody headache.
My therapist tried to get me to explain why I was mad at you and I really couldn’t. I guess that means that I’m not mad at you, even though I know that you were the one that ordered Clint to knock me out. I’m starting to understand why you did what you did. You didn’t want to be in a position where you would have to bring me in or worse.
Tony: So I show up to the house early because my new assistant Mary decided that she can’t tell me when things actually start because I’ll show up 30 minutes late.
Nomad: They wouldn’t have been able to turn Bucky into their weapon, if I didn’t let him fall. There wouldn’t be blood on his hands and he wouldn’t be where he is now.
Tony: Well, I haven’t heard of any attempts by the UN or the military to try to kidnap you, so I would say yes. Just be careful out there. I’m tired of hearing about you getting shot.
Red phone: You’ll always be Captain Tight Pants to me, even if Vision tells me you don’t want to be called Captain anything anymore.
“We sold the Khan’s house. So, if we bring them back, where are they going to live?" Steve lamented.
HSBF: What really happened with that? You talked a little about it last time, but you weren’t up to talk about anything too serious.
Me: That won’t be necessary. I’m just worried. I keep losing people I care about, and I’d really prefer for that not to happen again.
Person that cares about my boss: So I engaged in a sexual relationship for almost a year with Tony’s ATCU handler?
We are back in the bad timeline, and we will be for a few chapters. But I don’t think you’ll be that upset about it because we have a lot of Steve Tony stuff.
“I regret not talking to you before everything blew up. I regret not talking to you after everything blew up.” Steve confessed, and it practically broke Tony’s heart.
Tony: He is my chief creative officer. Although maybe I should've been less cryptic since he's now missing. Pepper is not happy. The board is going to be pissed if he stays missing.
Anthony: He is not against having someone pretend to be Stefan except for the fact that whoever pretends to be him will most likely get picked up by Ross, the CIA, or any other number of people who are pissed at me.
HSBF: I could see how that would be a problem. I didn’t hate your dad, but I always felt that he had more money than sense.
CoulsonPJ: Talbot knows better, but doesn't care if it gets Captain America back on our side, the original Captain America. Honestly, he is more focused on one upping Ross at the package announcement. They really hate each other.
Red phone: You are not fine. You are nowhere near fine. The only reason why you just have one bullet hole in you right now is because of your gear. I knew I should have reinforce the shoulder area.
“You are Dr. Leopold James. Also, known as Leopold J. Fitz from Earth-199999. We really should’ve met earlier.” The doctor remarked.
Anthony: Oh, they are hampering. Not as bad as they would have with Mr. PR being in charge. But things are better because the current Director is the guy who told his superior officers to fuck off when told to stop looking for me in Afghanistan.
Me: Also if you kept watching you would notice that his wife and now former head of the Jarvis Foundation was also dragged out in handcuffs by Carter, Jr. She would be the one responsible for at least the embezzlement portion of the news ticker.
Tony: Honey, I know you have a saving people thing, but somethings can’t be salvaged, usually most of my interpersonal relationships. Right now, my relationship with Happy resembles Pompeii.
“Okay, as much as I want to continue this and possibly remove some clothing, we have to go rescue your other self,” Hunter said as he reluctantly pulled away, very reluctantly. These jeans were too tight.
Tony: OK, confession time because I trust you not to go to the press; Pepper and I aren’t really engaged anymore. We haven’t been since before Morgan was born. However, with the world as unstable as it is and being stuck with the asshole members of the board after the decimation, we kept it quiet.
Nomad: Not really. I slept with Jonathan, a former aide of Sen. Christopher Ward, a few times before I realized he was married and an asshole. He spouts out anti-power people stuff all the time as a paid pundit.
Cuddle Bunny: So right now we just have the more than coffee. How are you really feeling about Shield giving you a brand-new assistant?
Agent L. Barton: Tony being a cuddle bug is apparently a universal constant. They look very peaceful curled around one another.
Red phone: Like starting a war with the superhero community and making out with the recently deceased’s grandniece?
Thank you to everybody who has spent more than 3 years reading this story. This has been a real labor of love. This is not the end but just the end of this part because I have multiple sequels planned. The Infinity Saga is not done in this timeline yet. I have plans for three other stories set in this universe. Please subscribe to this series. I will post the first chapter to the follow-up story, Text Messages from the Edge of High School in the next few hours.
“Always, unfortunately. OK, this is the last question for tonight because I feel like it will go downhill from here.”
Me: Of course he didn’t because he did the same thing with me. I tried to explain to him after what happened in Baltimore, it wasn't a feasible plan. If Happy had told me the entire plan, I wouldn’t have signed off on it. I should’ve never taught him that it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Tony: I left the game, but I was never the only game in town, only the best. There are dozens of other weapons manufacturers out there. Some of these players are more legal than others but they are still here on both sides. They’re making a small fortune on everybody who is stocking up for the next robot apocalypse or alien invasion.
Consider this an emotional palate cleanser after watching Endgame and probably crying your eyes out. We need a little bit of an emotional break before we head into our endgame.
FRIDAY: You’re afraid that if you discover that the Winter Soldier did kill someone else Sir cared about that you will be forced to tell him. You’re uncertain if you can do that despite the consequences of not telling Sir the truth last time because you don’t want to cause him any more pain emotionally.
The new consultant: I still feel like there's more. My cousin is in Asgard right now. There's so much you're not telling me. You already mentioned a possible time travel Clint yesterday or rather this morning.
Anthony: Also it works nicely with my plans to have virtual reality sex with you as soon as possible. There’s no need for a harness or remote sex toys, it will be like you are really there with May. I mean, I was halfway there with the project I was working on last spring, but this will have more practical applications then trying to work through my trauma. Although, I’ve always been a proponent of orgasm therapy.
“Take your sandwich and go cuddle with Parker. You’ll feel better after you eat and get a cuddle in. I made his sandwich too because I know the smell of food will wake him up.”
Anthony love: Just for that, I’m not pulling you into the first empty conference room that we see. No welcome home handjob for you.
Me: If you want to find me, use the phone. I know there’s a GPS tracker on it that only you can crack.
This conversation begins right before Peter sent his last text message to Tony, but before Tony actually read it. He’s distracted.
Me: Yes. Anthony could put a circuit board together at four but I think his father resented him for that. When he was nine he lost his mother figure and therefore was sent off to boarding school. He hated it because he thought it meant his father didn’t love him, but it kept him away from bullies and possibly Hydra assassins.
HSBF: Does that mean that Laura is going to stop monitoring him or that Melinda will stop working with him when she’s around?
Okay, now I’m even more proud of you. You are being a good mentor to Spidey Junior. I know he needs that right now.
Tony: Yes. I did go to smart kid school like Benjamin. Private smart kid school where almost everybody was on scholarship, but still smart kid school so the rumor mill must be vicious as hell and it’s probably worse now because there’s Facebook.
Genius Princess: If it wasn't for the time difference, I would've been on the call yesterday. Ana sent me the readout this morning, along with the files that she downloaded from the other timeline.
HSBF: Thanks Friday. Do any of those videos include singing to somebody else? When was the last time you did it?
Morgan’s dad: It’s no problem at all. Morgan needs socialization. Although you don’t need to send a thank you text message. Your scary half has been doing that for the last week since you dropped your kid off here so you can go on your save the world mission.
Counselor Laura: I think me being stuck in 2023 qualifies as an emergency. Why is Tony not a part of Avengers? Is it because Steve is now married to May? How did that happen? Also, where is Ana? Why aren’t you Afia anymore?
I always felt like Howard hated me for being smarter than him. I’ve never felt like that. I’m pretty sure Monkey Lover is smarter than me and it kind of excites me. I need the next generation to be better than me, so they don’t make the same mistakes I did. I’m even intrigued by the person helping your James. Maybe I’m this way because I’m trying not to be Howard. It’s my goal in life.
Chief mechanic: Do you know that in the other timeline, you’re Vice President? That’s like one of the few nice things going on there.
Friday: Please see the document attached. Although I’m no longer allowed to forward you text messages that my boss does not plan for you to see he never said anything about his therapy journal excerpts.
“After comparing notes with the princess, I am sure they can but it’s still not a position you want to put your friends in if you can help it.”
Me: Yep. He is DC in the bosom of Agent Agent after his adventures on the Virginia/West Virginia border. I think Laura is going down to DC tomorrow for the sole purpose of kicking his ass. I hope someone gets video footage of it.
Counselor Laura: It’s tough to understand the musings of a drunk scientist even if you’re a recovering alcoholic with multiple Ph. D.s. Ones that are useful, not like the seven that Bruce has. Seriously, pick a lane.
“You understand mistakes were made on both sides? There were no good choices during the Accords’ fiasco or as my Tony refers to it as the Avengers’ uncivil toddler squabble.” Steve half chuckled at that.
Me: Yes, we’re still on. Yo-yo has yet to have to schedule something in this block. Also, the kids are preoccupied. They’re on their floor lamenting the fact that they have homework on day one in Yo-Yo and Happy are monitoring.
SimmonsJA: I know you’re upset that the current medical situation will prevent you and your partner from crossing the event horizon, but maybe it’s for the best. Once you cross that line, you can’t go back. Your relationship with him is already precarious.
Agent Johnson: We found Odin. We are on some cliffs off the coast of Norway. I’m going into cloaking mode. I don't want to interrupt the father-son moment.
"Of course boss.” He heard Friday’s voice from Tony’s phone. “Should I also send a box of the good chocolates to Ms. Potts?"
Red phone: Which apparently was how Hydra got their hands on the formula to make super soldiers, again.
Genius Princess: A while. The future is fluid. With each choice, I make Robbin’s drawings change. When she first arrived, she was drawing pictures of a cracked earth like you were aware of. Then they switched to a battle that was similar to what happened in the other timeline. You saw those pictures.
Me: Mostly because you don’t assume that Cuddle Bunny’s alter ego must be a paragon of heterosexuality. Although, how do you know they're fake? We’re separated by an entire ocean and a lot of political bullshit. We need to do something to keep the spark alive.
I also found out recently that this fic has a page on Tvtropes. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/IHopeYouHaveUnlimitedTextMessaging
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely. Look another chapter on a Thursday. Because we have reached the endgame of the story, I’m going to be posting chapters as soon as I get them back from editing. I don’t know if we'll get the last four up before Endgame comes out, but we are trying.
The boss: I understand the feeling, though. My other self is engaged to Steve. Apparently, they got there by playing ridiculous icebreaker games and honest communication.
Anthony: Now I either get to be babysat by your ex-girlfriend who you had crazy adventurous sex with or your ex-girlfriend's great grandniece/granddaughter who you made out with that one time.
“To get a hold of the company again for war profiteering purposes or possibly to help Ross with his hidden agenda. It wouldn’t be the first time around.” Steve just stared at Tony for a moment, mouth open in surprise.
“It wouldn’t hurt to have a possible backup name in case May and Laura can’t get Dr. Cruz. That’s why they‘re in New York right now.”
Nomad: I think Coulson can help you get away with murder especially if you got rid of the Ross problem.
Counselor Laura: Granted, I've been told Thanos' motives through my Robin's visions, but I thought he wanted to destroy half of life so the other half could thrive. Genocidal population control if you will. Isn’t eliminating fertility issues counter to that?
Nomad: No you’re not. Well, at least not anymore. You definitely not narcissistic. How can people still think that of you after you save so many people?
Counselor Laura: OK, now I have to ask you if you had any edibles or picked up any drinks of the alcoholic variety. I know my Tony won’t even do NyQuil. Actually, he’s even skeptical of any pain medication higher than Tylenol. He won’t even think about taking the version with codeine.
“And this is why Friday was pulled? To the point that she can’t even answer simple requests.” Tony asked skeptically.
Me: You might be right about her being indisposed. Maybe you should email Queens instead. Not just to hear his side of things, but to see if he’s okay and not just depend on what ever you’re being told in the briefings.
I was initially going to keep this conversation going on longer in this form, But I realized it was very confusing to read and would have been hard to interpret for those using screen reading software. They rarely tell you when the text switches to being italicized.
Me: Eventually I'm going to wear you down. I mean we're dating and we can't even make out because we are in different countries. Telecommunications sex was invented for situations like this.
Venom: A lot. This morning I found out why Peter is not going to make a move on you this summer because our field trip is probably going to get called off on account of a giant purple alien that wants to wipe out half of the universe. Also, apparently, that already happened once. I was part of the 50% that was wiped out of existence.
Anthony: I was bored and it wasn't like Agent Scary was giving up the goods on what dating you was like. I had to do something.
Genius Princess: Deke wants to know if his Nana has drunk herself into a puddle or locked herself in the framework? He’s concerned.
Counselor Laura: I think I know the answer to this, but how did Tony and Steve’s engagement end? Were they ever engaged or even dating? Did they even start speaking to each other again after the Siberia fiasco?
SimmonsJA: That is beside the point. No strenuous physical activity for at least two more weeks, including but not limited to, sexual intercourse.
Nomad: Don't. You don't need it. You're stronger than you think you are. Who cares what they think about you. They're wrong. They don't know who you are underneath the Tony Stark swagger. They have no idea of the true depth of your real character.
The Big Boss: Honestly, according to Perez, when your gay sex tape came out in ‘92, Obadiah told the members that were around at the time, including Perez's father, that it was a youthful indiscretion and a grief reaction to their death. It really didn't mean anything.
“Are you going to tell him that I’m your boyfriend?” Tony interrupted as Steve read him the letter. Steve was actually proud of himself for finishing something that almost resembled a complete letter. Usually he didn’t get more than a paragraph done before he had the nano paper Wipe itself. This he could almost send. It was just missing one thing.
“And - here’s the best part - Peter won’t have to reveal his identity because the media is going to be all over the fact that Captain America is back.”
“I just wish there was some way I could help,” Peter said thickly. He was exhausted, injured, and scared. Sitting around was only fraying his nerves further. “I felt like I was helping when I followed Mr. Stark to fight Thanos, but then… but then… one minute I was on Titan, and then the next thing I knew I was here. And now I’m useless again.”
Science and Tech Day was cool. That was the only way of describing it. They walked into a huge atrium with balconies as high as they could see, where every kind of invention was on display: from hover-boards and robots that did chores to holographic displays and an actual flying car (“Completely impractical,” Tony scoffed).
this version of Steve just yet. What if this version of Steve was different from the Steve he’d gotten to know over the last few months? He had said nice things earlier, but that was when Peter was missing. It might have been an in-the-moment kind of thing.
“So you’re saying that if they go after the Soul Stone - Steve and Tony - one of them would need to sacrifice the other.”
from SHIELD. The line between his undercover personality and his real personality was starting to blur.
Thanks for continuing to read! It all comes together in the last chapter, I promise. (Spoiler: The next chapter is where the "kidnapping" tag becomes relevant.)
MJ looked stunning. She was wearing a deep blue dress that sparkled under the light and her hair - well, her hair was just up in its usual messy bun, like she couldn’t be bothered to do it any other way. She looked perfect.
The third man finally chimed in. He had a deep, intimidating voice that put Peter’s spidey sense on high alert. “Do you really think Stark will fall for it?”
He seemed embarrassed about it, but Tony wasn't having that. “Uh, I didn't exactly read your resume. I figured Pepper did that sort of thing. But there's no need to be ashamed of your nerd school, kid. I went to high school for one year and then I graduated from MIT at 17. It doesn't get nerdier than that.”
Peter hesitated before he said quickly, “He’s doing a whole big article on the internships so it’s going to take more than one interview. I thought Ms. Potts told you.”
“You know that’s not why I’m mad.” Tony finally closed the first aid kit and took a look at Peter. His arm was coated in band-aids, he had gauze covering a burn on his forehead, and his hair was flying in all directions. He looked like a small, spider-y mad scientist. “I understand that the kitten needed to be rescued. What I don’t understand is why you took a flying leap out of a burning building into a tree.”
As the ashes of Peter Parker slipped through his fingers, as his life blew away in the eerily silent wind of a strange planet, Tony realized that he was completely and utterly alone. Helpless. His genius brain couldn’t get him out of this one. There was no math that could fix this. There was no technology that would defeat Thanos, no calculation that would bring back Peter, bring back Strange, bring back the Guardians. There was no equation that could calculate the total physical and emotional loss that had just happened in the universe.
“I don’t know,” said Fury flatly, which actually made Steve feel a lot better. He was starting to wonder if radioactive spiders were commonplace in the 21st century and he had just missed it, but apparently that wasn’t the case. “But here’s what we do know: Stark and his interns went to Science and Tech Day. Radioactive spiders attacked people. There were no major injuries, but a few people had burns. They didn’t have any weird after-effects that we know of, but two months later, Spider-Man appears. And guess who he works with most frequently? Iron Man. Who, prior to this, was known for working alone.”
It took him two days after the night Steve found him shouting out, but he finally said Peter’s name aloud. Admitted defeat. Like the rest of them, he had become a person who existed only to bear the weight of what he had lost.
It was only Day 57 of living in this century when Natasha Romanoff entered his life, or more specifically, his gym, and made things less boring.
“I know,” said Steve softly. “I’m sorry, too. I should have told you about Bucky and your parents. I should have been less stubborn. We’ve all made mistakes.” He noticed that Tony’s hand was shaking, so he put his hand over it and held tight. “We’re together now,” he said, his voice stronger than before. “Let’s make it count.”
Steve felt like he was reading a strangely detailed Wikipedia page. How did SHIELD even know that Tony and Rhodes were friends? And that he was an alcoholic? Either he had since become sober or he hid it well, because Steve hadn’t noticed. Then again, he hadn’t been around very much. And he had a feeling that Tony was good at hiding things.
Given his persistent belief that Thanos could still be defeated, Thor decided that the best plan of action was to gather as many allies as they could find, draw Thanos in, and destroy him together. The only issue with the plan was the central part of it: Thor wanted to bring Thanos back to Earth. His plan was, essentially, to head off into space, meet with some allies to announce that the Avengers wanted to kill Thanos, encourage them to make a lot of noise about it throughout the galaxies, and then wait for Thanos to show up to shut them down. His plan involved enticing Thanos to come directly back to Wakanda.
Strange continued, “Upon learning about the threat that Thanos posed to the universe, I meditated to try and find a way to stop him.”
They all froze, looking at the vibrating Stark Phone like it was about to explode. Tony said, “Jarv -”
“Not quite,” said Thor. He explained that since Thanos used the Soul Stone to make everyone disappear, it was likely that their souls existed somewhere… else. Somewhere unreachable. Someplace that no one had ever actually seen.
“I summoned you here,” said a voice from behind them. Stephen Strange looked ethereal here, the only one who seemed comfortable in this space between worlds. He also just appeared from out of nowhere.
Steve simultaneously felt like he was close to figuring all of this out and putting the pieces together, and miles away from an answer. The mysterious Spider-Man, Tony’s secrecy, the incident at Science and Tech Day - it was all connected somehow, but he couldn’t quite see how. And he was running out of time. He’d told Peter and MJ that he would need to conduct three interviews with each of them, and he was already running out of things to ask about that seemed plausible. It was a stretch to imagine that Tony wouldn’t grow suspicious if Steve tried to stick around any longer.
Steve snorted. “They’re dating, but they don’t know it yet.” He indicated a teenage couple strolling through the park, each holding a coffee in one hand and their cell phone in the other.
See? Lots of fun possibilities. Hope you enjoyed this! Comments and kudos welcome. Find me on Tumblr at marvelsmostwanted.
Tony stepped closer and lowered his voice so that Steve, who was standing behind them as if he was afraid to say anything, couldn’t hear. “She can call Bruce,” Tony added, “if you need Bruce. Do you need Bruce? Are you okay? What happened?”
“Tell her I’m on my way,” said Tony, dropping the wrench in his hand and brushing his hands on his jeans. He was sure he didn’t look his best, but he was also pretty sure it wouldn’t matter: May was definitely here to chew him out for upsetting Peter. He was ready to face her after berating himself all night. He deserved it.
at once, Tony worried that this wouldn’t be the last of their problems. What if Peter suddenly grew eight eyes or legs? They had no idea if, or when, the after-effects of the bite would subside. Would Peter be climbing up the side of a building one day and suddenly lose his ability to stick to things? Tony worried himself sick. Finally, Bruce threatened to turn into the Hulk if Tony kept stressing him out. Bruce ended up kicking Tony out of the lab and forcing him to work on something else for a few days.
this way and less like the dedicated reporter who had been lingering around Stark Tower for weeks. Tony knew it was foolish to fall for the act; Steve was still a journalist and Tony was sure he’d be reporting anything story-worthy that happened tonight, but for just a second he wondered if things would be different if they’d met somewhere else. Somewhere like this, where no one was thinking about consequences. They could have met as strangers at this stupid party and maybe… maybe things would be different.
“I know it’s a lot to take in,” Pepper was saying calmly. Tony was impressed by her ability to handle this situation since Pepper herself had only just found out about Spider-Man. He was suddenly grateful for her ability to handle literally any situation because time was ticking and they needed to channel their emotions into finding Peter. “May, I know it’s a lot to take in. But let’s try and focus, shall we? When did you last see Peter? Can we start with that?”
“How can we help?” He asked. Tony had to refrain from rolling his eyes. Steve was a soldier, even in times of tragedy. It was in his blood.
Pepper had a bright smile on her face, the type she always had when Tony was causing her stress but she was in public, so she couldn’t show it. It didn’t make sense until Tony’s gaze slid over to the man next to her - tall, blonde, and
“Technically, yes,” said Nebula, “which is why the location of the Soul Stone is such a closely guarded secret.” She tilted her head. Her dark eyes and expressionless face made her seem emotionless, telling them the logical truth even though it was painful to hear it. “What I’m telling you is that one sacrificed soul could save half the universe.”
“It’s a place to start,” Steve agreed. It wasn’t much of a plan: Find Tony, and hope he had answers. And if he didn’t have answers, then what? Panic together?
The questions started to die down, but they also took on a new tone: “What if I hear something bad happening, like someone getting mugged or worse? What should I do?”
“I don’t think that’s a coincidence, and neither do you,” MJ continued, ignoring him. She stepped into his apartment like she owned the place, settling on the arm of the couch and crossing her arms across her chest with a determined look on her face. “The kidnappers said on TV that they didn’t want Iron Man or the police to come looking for him.” Steve closed the door, a sort of anticipatory dread coming over him. How long had she known?
It had been so nice, in fact, that Steve didn’t want to think about it too much. He wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that he and Tony Stark might have been friends in another life.
“Don’t go near him,” said a voice to his left, and he turned to see Sam with his arms crossed again, eyes on Loki. “He tried to destroy Earth once and nearly succeeded. I wouldn’t put it past him to try and destroy this place, too,” he told Peter darkly.
Peter didn’t like this change of subject, feeling their scrutiny like a spotlight. He barely avoided a full-body flinch as the toe of a boot came in contact with his stomach as one of them lightly kicked him.
Pepper looked up along with all of the interns to see Tony, who had appeared as if right on cue. “I already did,” she said, her tone pleasant but clipped.
They were on Tony’s personal floor, with Peter sitting on the kitchen counter eating leftover pizza. Ever since he got his powers, the kid had twice the appetite of a normal teenage boy.
“What do you know?” Wanda demanded. “And don’t think we won’t leave you here to rot if we find out you’re lying.”
tell with journalists.” He didn’t want to tell Peter about last night when he caught Steve on the phone, because he hadn’t even figured out how to feel about that yet, but he needed Peter to understand this. He pulled to a sudden stop in front of Peter’s apartment building. “I know Steve seems nice, but you can’t trust everybody. Reporters always have an ulterior motive, even when they seem genuine. You just have to be careful, Peter. I just want you to be safe. Honestly, what were you even doing out patrolling that late, after the party? You know, with great power comes -”
He thought maybe it was the sleep deprivation catching up to him. This had all felt like some surreal nightmare until people started to actually do something about it. Now, it felt real. Frighteningly real. What if Tony said the wrong thing and Peter had to suffer the consequences? What if they were wrong about the location? What if Steve got hurt and couldn’t get to Peter in time? What if -
“And I know it’s all too much for one person to handle,” Steve continued, voicing Tony’s thoughts. “But you’re not alone. I’m right here. And so is Pepper, and May, and MJ, and we’re not going anywhere.” He slid his hand from Tony’s wrist to interlace their fingers. “When Peter’s back, he’ll be here for you, too. So if anything like this ever happens again - and I hope that it won’t, but if it does - you’ll never have to deal with it alone. Okay?”
powers if Tony hadn’t taken him and MJ to that stupid Science and Tech Day. Not to mention that Tony just
of this shows up in an article about Spider-Man two months from now, or anywhere at all, ever - even if it’s on a conspiracy website that has six followers - trust me when I say
There were no windows in the workshop, and Tony hadn’t been paying any attention to the clock. He didn’t notice that morning had arrived until JARVIS interrupted his thoughts.
He wasn’t entirely sure he believed him, but what choice did he have? He was pretty sure that Steve had taken his threats seriously, especially considering the quick turnaround from earlier, but anxiety continued to eat away at him. Pepper knew now, which meant that he would have to face a million questions in the morning. Peter would be upset that Steve knew. And now Tony couldn’t trust Steve, which - he hated to admit it, but that was disappointing, too. As much as Tony had complained about Steve poking around, he had become used to the other man, and even started to like him. Like,
he didn’t yell after him desperately as Peter disappeared inside, but he thought it, feeling conflicted. Was this what it was like to have a son? He didn’t need Peter to look up to him or anything like that, although it was nice, but he wanted Peter to take his advice. Tony wasn’t trying to lecture him. He was just trying to make Peter understand the lessons that he’d had to learn the hard way - once, twice, six times over.
Tony’s mind was racing. “They didn’t mention the confession,” he realized. “The news. The threat they received was different than the one we did.” Of course. They were framing him. They were framing Tony for their mistake. The investigation into Oscorp was ongoing, but it wasn’t over. If Tony confessed to creating Spider-Man, then their company would avoid the blame. “Oscorp wants me to confess to creating Spider-Man so that they get away with setting radioactive spiders on a bunch of teenagers back at Science and Tech Day.”
“Good,” said Tony. Then he clapped a hand on Peter’s shoulder. “And yes, of course I want to know how you did it, you idiot.”
Kind/constructive comments and kudos appreciated :) I'm @marvelsmostwanted on Tumblr if you want to message/follow me/yell at me.
“Yes,” said Tony, slamming his hands down on the table and alarming everybody, “it was the tech that was supposed to make every call from their phones
Initially, it seemed like Peter would be fine. They took him to the hospital, but he woke up a few hours after losing consciousness, much to his aunt's relief. It appeared that he had passed out because of the pain, but it was difficult for the doctors to say whether or not there would be any lasting effects. They were still conducting tests on the mutant spiders to figure out what substances might have made their way into Peter's system.
“Do you mean every two weeks or twice a week?” Peter asked as he obediently hopped up on top of a lab bench, which was not something he was supposed to do and also not a formal way to conduct a checkup, but Bruce wasn’t a real medical doctor either, so they were making do with what that had.
were to be sacrificed for the Stone, then they would take Gamora’s place and Thanos would no longer be worthy of it. The Stone would become the property of its new host.” Her expression hardened. “I do not believe Thanos loves anybody else in this universe like he loved Gamora, so he would be unable to get the Stone back.”
Tony only confirmed Steve’s suspicion that he was overwrought when he approached and said by way of greeting, “You look too sober. Have a drink. Let loose a little.” It was a transparent tactic to make sure Steve was here just to enjoy the party, not to get the scoop on the inevitable mess that was sure to hit all of New York’s papers tomorrow.
“Well, there is one way you could help,” he said with a careful glance to where Bucky and Sam stood with Wanda. There seemed to be a widening expanse between them. “Tell me what happened on Titan when you met Thanos. What do you know?”
His shoulders stiffened as the familiar, lead-heavy weight of betrayal sank into his stomach. He was prepared to hear anything -
“But you aren’t just like everybody else, are you?” Loki asked. Before Peter could get insulted, the god continued, “You’re far too young to know what it takes to be a hero. The sacrifices. The sleepless nights. The things you thought you would never be capable of doing, but did anyway.”
A timer went off in the kitchen. “Oh, shoot! That’s our dinner. Don’t want to let it burn. Again. I’ll be right back, excuse me.” May stood and hurried to the kitchen.
“They haven’t been in since last week,” Tony realized as he said it. The atomic force microscope wasn’t the most expensive thing in the lab, but it was an oddly specific item for someone to take. It was the only microscope that had nanometer-level visuals. There were only a handful of people who would know how to use it, and fewer still doing experiments that would require one. “But -”
For some reason, it felt significant that Tony was asking. Steve found himself telling Tony about Brooklyn, and going to baseball games and growing up poor, and it was mostly the truth with some crucial details left out, like the fact that it had been the 1920’s and not the 1980’s. A lie of omission was not as bad as outright making up facts, though, or so Steve convinced himself as he kept talking. He surprised himself with how much he wanted to share with Tony, even mentioning that he had been in the Army.
Unfortunately, one nice conversation didn’t mean that Steve wasn’t undercover. He was abruptly reminded of that fact when Tony looked through the sketchbook. It had been a close call. Steve made up some story, detailed enough that it sounded legitimate, simple enough that it sounded plausible, to cover the fact that he had been drawing Peggy and Bucky. Frankly, he was lucky that Tony hadn’t recognized them. Steve knew there were pictures of Howard with the two of them, and only the fact that Tony avoided thinking about Howard as much as possible had saved his identity from being revealed in the middle of Central Park.
“I literally can’t imagine what you would be doing in the stratosphere,” said Tony dryly. “There’s a reason I didn’t give you a suit that could fly.”
could be wrong? It made him stop and listen. Steve sighed on the other end of the line, resulting in a burst of static. He paused for so long that Tony almost thought the call had dropped, but then -
“No,” Steve said, and for some reason, his heart skipped a beat when he saw the way Tony was looking at him. “No, there’s no one.”
He was pretty sure that gaining Tony Stark’s trust would be an uphill battle, and it was a battle that he would have to fight on his own.
True to his word, Steve did not leak the story of Spider-Man’s identity to the papers. This was, of course, made easier by the fact that he was not actually a journalist. He had no one to tell. And despite his weak excuse to Tony about making the call to protect Peter, he’d meant what he said: He would never do anything that could potentially put Peter in danger.
Then Peter stopped asking questions altogether. His visits became briefer. His “internship” had already been extended into the fall to cover for the fact that he was getting regular checkups from Bruce to make sure he wasn’t gaining any new powers, and that he was handling the ones he had. Usually, Peter would stick around to trail Tony into his workshop, but now as soon as he had reassured the two adults that he was fine, he bolted.
I heard a rumor that they even sent War Machine after him, but they never found him.” He paused to catch his breath. “So,” he added, “I think it’s some kid. But he’s working with somebody, or for somebody. We would’ve caught him by now if he was working alone.”
HSBF: Why? She didn't give your allergy information to the Watchdogs or something like that? Why would she do that?
“We're ahead of where they were right now. We already managed to get the stone out of Vision’s head.” Afia told them.
Me: Seriously, how did you not realize this before suffering extreme bodily harm? He calls you Cuddle Bunny. Cuddle bunny!!! Are the good drugs helping you realize things?
“This is not how I wanted to find out my grandfather is bisexual. Nana never mentioned this.” The alleged grandson replied.
“I’m really the wrong person to have this conversation with because I never actually did an undercover assignment over a month." Melinda says changing the subject.
"I get it. It was probably even worse for you because you remember how Aunt Peggy was during the war. I knew my aunt was a total badass, but I didn't actually know what she did in DC all day. Not until later."
BITC: This is true. Our sleepovers aren’t the same anymore. At least when we could still have them before my mom went to zero tolerance.
CoulsonPJ: I hope so too. I'm still upset that Fury waited so long to tell you when he was always planning for you to know. You didn’t need to suffer like that.
“If there’s a good chance we’re going to get snapped out of existence, you might as well go for it.” Flash sounded resigned.
Here is Tony and Steve trying to finish their date. Will it be more successful than last time? We shall see. There’s definitely a lower probability of small children popping up at the most inappropriate times of the movie. But hey at least Tony didn’t talk Steve into doing something that would've been even worse for a small child to walk in on. That’s a conversation Tony doesn’t want to ever have.
Agent L. Barton: However, my Tony is really persistent. The ATCU is paying for me to go back and finish my degree. Despite the separation, Clint offered to be Nikki’s primary caregiver, so I could focus on my doctorate.
Melinda: Nothing happens if you don’t try. Isn’t that what you always tell our daughters? Maybe you should stop preaching to everyone else and take your own damn advice.
Thankfully, years as a mom and a guidance counselor made her an expert at typing one-handed while cuddling someone crying. You’ll be amazed at how often she had to utilize this skill before.
Continuity note: I did see Ant-man and the Wasp last weekend. I really liked it. The movie takes place after our continuity divide (about a year and a half from our current point in the story). So it’s possible some changes made in this continuity could affect that movie, especially the post-credit scene. But that’s something that would most likely happen in the infinity war/Avengers 4 fix it sequel for this story, if I do one (I’m 80% certain I am going to be writing a follow-up story). However, I did a tiny call forward to that movie in this chapter. See if you can spot it.
Venom: Is this the time we remind you that your uncle’s death wasn’t your fault? I thought that was a November thing.
SimmonsJA: The director obviously believes otherwise. Otherwise, he would not have allowed me to deploy Shield resources in this way. And he has known you since you were at MIT together. The fact that you referred to your assistant’s presence as “cock blocking” means that you were not planning to follow the advice of your physician.
Me: I'm sure the forensic accountants that I just hired are going to discover all sorts of fun and possibly illegal discrepancies. They’ve already found a few, considering the indictment.
Anthony: There are times that they use people close to me to hurt me because my identity is publicly known. Now they're using possible government sanctions against SI as a choke chain to keep me in line. Or at least they're trying to. They forgot I'm smart enough to call a bluff. Although now that Ross has lost some of his power, I’m sure he doesn’t think I’m toothless anymore.
Tony Potts: I wrote them, I never actually sent any of them. I still write them sometimes, although now I’m stone-cold sober.
“I didn’t need to. I was there when Leo knocked you out.” She may have said a few choice Mandarin curse words at that moment, at least in her head. Outside, her face stayed impassive.
Me: I’ve never been very good at remembering to take medication regularly or anything similar like eating.
Red phone: I really just want to hug you right now and I am not a hugger, but I feel like you need one badly.
Tony: I don’t know. Someone probably thinks surviving Afghanistan or maybe surviving the palladium poisoning. Don’t get me wrong I’m glad I am not dead yet, but I think you getting pulled out of the ocean is what I’m most grateful for.
Anthony: I think they could probably be Secret Avengers, but I would like to keep them away from Ross and all the anti-enhanced person politicians by whatever means necessary.
"Because Steve sitting is a full-time job and thanks to me gaining a daughter-in-law because I set a horrible example when it comes to dating an international fugitive, you have an opening." Tony joked.
HSBF: I’m still shocked that hasn’t come out publicly yet, considering you did tell the board Tuesday.
Me: So far we’ve mostly talked about how to deal with your Spidey problem and we really don’t have any solutions.
Tony: I’m not actually sure how long I’m going to be in DC. There’s meetings at the DOD and Congress already on the schedule with more to come. More Accords stuff that needs to be straightened out in case there is a regime change. But I should be done before Mumbai.
Considering that the Grand Master’s already made a pass at me twice I see this as a possibility and I’m not having that. I did some things when I was on the street to survive that I wish I didn’t. I know that it’s necessary for me to do whatever I have to do to survive this planet, but not that. Calling a truce with the being that murdered Coulson was hard enough. Yes, the death didn’t stick, but I’m still upset about that.
“What will be the subject of this heavy conversation I need to have with Tony?” Steve asked changing the subject.
The Mechanic: You were good at it though. The current Under Secretary for Environment, Economics, and Energy used to be one of my execs at SI before she took the job. So there’re precedents.
Thank you to everybody who read the last conversation. Unfortunately, there were no reviews for the previous chapter, but I did post it late in the day on a holiday.
Maybe if you can tear yourself away from your boyfriend for more than 20 minutes, we can get a drink. It will give you a break from being Stefan Carter.
Anthony love: I feel like that would lead to a broken nose, and there’s no way I’m risking that before the wedding.
"I have to do something during boring meetings and Yo-Yo keeps taking my phone. I can’t fight back. I don’t even see when she does it. No one else does either."
Oh by the way, a few assholes on twitter and a couple of supposedly reputable websites are accusing me of making you go gay. I usually respond by mentioning your sex tape. Sorry about that but it’s the best way to deal with it. Why is it they assume that you’re bisexualness disappears when you’re dating someone of the opposite sex?
“Don’t say that,” said Tony harshly. “Don’t say there was nothing I could have done. I could have been less stubborn. I could have listened to you, and we would have been together, and we might have had a fighting chance.”
Pepper stopped typing to look at him. “The agenda,” she repeated flatly. “You have never, not once in the seven years that I have worked for you, asked about a schedule before. Are you feeling okay?” She didn’t give him time to answer before leveling him with a suspicious glare. “Is this about Steve?”
And just like that, Peter was tearing up. He always wanted to do things himself, and this was no exception - it was incredibly frustrating to be told by Strange to just wait - but at the same time, Peter would give anything to have Tony burst in and save the day right now. What if Tony couldn’t save him this time? What if Tony just thought they were dead, and right now he was alone and scared in space?
“I was in space,” Peter rushed to explain, trying to make sense of any of it. “I was on Titan, with Tony and Dr. Strange and - them.” He pointed to a second group just as he noticed them, huddled away from the first. Peter wasn’t sure if they had been there the whole time or if they had just appeared, but there they were: Quill, Drax, and Mantis. A fourth figure had joined them. It looked like a talking tree. Peter wasn’t even going to question it at this point. “We were trying to get the glove off of Thanos, but we couldn’t do it. And then Mr. Stark was dying and Dr. Strange decided to save him, and then
So when Tony showed up to pick Peter up from school the next day, it was hardly surprising that Peter got into his car and started with, “It wasn’t in the paper, so everything’s okay, right?”
Steve was shivering, standing on the sidewalk outside of SI. He could still hear the music booming inside, but the party seemed distant now that he had been so abruptly brought back to reality.
It was a lot of information to process at once. Tony was dead? Who was Stephen Strange? Once again, Steve filtered out the confusing details and focused on what mattered: helping Tony. He lifted him with little effort, carrying him like a lifeless rag doll.
Natasha’s face was pale and her voice was less steady as she abruptly walked away, repeating, “I’m going to call Clint.”
Steve had been asking himself the same questions over and over since people started turning into ash and dust before his eyes.
“So whoever we sacrifice has a 50-50 chance of being brought back or gone forever?” Steve clarified.
...Sorry for the cliffhanger! I meant for this to be the last chapter, but I just haven't had the time to finish the very last part. This was already done, so I wanted to share it with you since I haven't updated in a while. The next chapter will definitely be the last, and maybe I'll take some time to go through and fix the typos that I'm sure are in here. As always, thanks for reading!
MJ didn't even flinch; she just wrinkled her nose at the dead mutant spider on the ground. “Those things really are disgusting.”
“Great,” he said. Wanda, Bucky, and T’Challa looked discomfited by the thought as well. “We are never getting out of here.”
Tony felt strung out and exhausted, physically and emotionally, but also restless. He wanted to get in the suit and start searching for Peter, but Pepper had stopped him with a reminder that if he was seen, people would want to know why, and it would only draw more attention to the situation. She suggested that instead, they approach it logically and call the police, try to narrow down where Peter could be, and then go from there. Tony wasn’t pleased with this course of action, but he knew they weren’t going to get anywhere while May was still upset, so he decided it was worth the time to calm her down and make sure they had all their facts straight.
Peter blinked, then blinked again. His thoughts were fuzzy as he tried to remember - what day was it, again?
“I really hope you mean that,” said Tony, distancing himself and finally letting Steve go. “Because I meant what I said, too. I will do everything in my power to ruin your life if this gets out.”
Peter took a moment to get his bearings. He was still in the suit, but his face was uncovered. His heart leapt into his throat at the realization, but he swallowed down his panic. There was nothing he could do about it now. Stupidity had brought him here - he’d been so stupid. Impulsive. He’d been angry with Tony, and frustrated at the world, and he’d gone out alone in the middle of the night in New York City without enough web fluid, and ended up here.
Nat didn’t call him on the subject change, looking thoughtful as she answered. “I had a mission a while back to keep an eye on the CEO of Stark Industries. Not Pepper,” she added quickly at Steve’s surprised expression, “but the former CEO. I don’t suppose you know much about it?”
“Hey!” Nebula snapped. “Before either of you jump off a cliff, you should know that the sacrificed soul may not be able to be brought back with everyone else. I’m not clear on exactly how it works. But the person with the Soul Stone should be able to go to the Soul World and snap their fingers, so to speak, to bring everyone back. I’m not sure if that includes the sacrificed person.”
She raised one eyebrow and didn’t look up from what she was typing as she pointedly moved her laptop away from where he sat, safely out of range of any potential coffee spills. “Can I help you, Mr. Stark?” She asked lightly.
It took a few weeks, but the walls around Steve's SHIELD colleagues started to come down. He learned that Natasha was from Russia, a place neither of them were eager to visit again, and that she had been trained someplace called the Red Room. In turn, he told Nat about Peggy and Bucky and the men he lost in the war, and the friends he lost after he woke up. In some small way, knowing that he wasn’t the only one with a mysterious past made him feel slightly less alien in this century. It also helped that Natasha was never starstruck around him. She didn’t seemed impressed by his super strength when they were sparring, and even encouraged him not to hold back. It was nice to have someone around who didn’t treat him with kid gloves, or like he was some sort of celebrity.
And that’s how Tony ended up sitting side-by-side with Steve the Reporter on a park bench eating a hot dog instead of doing the undercover stake-out he had originally planned.
“The interviewer Peter was just telling us about two seconds ago?” MJ said, exasperated. She managed to shove all of her books into her bag and the three of them started down the hall toward chemistry class. “The hot one.”
On Thursday morning, Tony slid across Pepper’s desk and perched on the end, swinging his feet like a little kid and holding a mug of steaming coffee.
Finally, a beaten-looking spaceship arrived on the roof of the Tower. And due to the strangeness of the last several days, Steve didn’t immediately assume it was Tony.
Tony hated to admit it, but she was right. “Look, I just -” He didn’t have a good excuse for his behavior. “I’m sorry,” he said finally. “Okay? Peter’s just a kid. I am just trying to keep it that way. He doesn’t need his name in the headlines for any reason.”
“We are not dead, as Mantis and King T’Challa pointed out,” explained Strange. “I believe we are currently existing in the Soul World. Thanos used the Soul Stone to eliminate half of all of the souls in the universe. This is why we appeared to fade into ash instead of dying as one would expect. You can imagine Thanos’ logic: It’s a lot less messy this way. No bodies left behind. It is simply as if we never existed at all.”
He wanted to talk to Sam. He wanted to know what Wanda would say about this, if she had any idea how Infinity Stones worked or if there was a way to reverse this. He wanted Bucky back, but that was a pain so intimately familiar that it had already been reduced to a dull ache in his chest. He wanted T’Challa’s level-headed leadership at a time like this, when there seemed to be nothing left to do but beg or shout or cry.
“Thanos killed her to get the Soul Stone.” Nebula tilted her head, her dark eyes alternately lingering on Steve and Tony.
“Kid?” Steve asked. He knew the man was described as small, fast, and agile, but he hadn’t heard anyone refer to Spider-Man as a kid. For some reason, he’d just assumed Spider-Man was an adult.
“It means that Thanos killed me before he decided to eliminate half of the universe,” Loki spoke up, bitterness coloring his tone. He seemed physically weak, but his snaking half-smile was familiar and cold.
He moved his feet, one at a time, to watch as the soldiers collected themselves. He owed it to them - and to Bucky, Sam, Wanda, T’Challa, and anyone else who had disappeared - to keep it together. He could fall apart later. The nightmares would come regardless of whether or not he kept going. So he kept going.
Pepper had also pointed out that Peter was the only person for whom Tony would stop working and pay attention. Tony explained that it was because Peter was smart and often insightful, and Tony could use someone on his level to talk to once in awhile. Pepper gently reminded him that he didn’t do the same for Bruce. Although he refused to admit it to Pepper, Tony grudgingly admitted to himself that he was a sucker for Peter’s puppy-eyed look.
The kid talked so fast that he ended up breathless. “Well, I was out the other night and it was getting cold, like,
“And now?” Tony pressed. His knee was touching Steve’s. It had been there for a while. “Is there anyone?”
“Thanos used the Soul Stone to eliminate half the universe because it is the most difficult process to reverse.”
There was a shift in the air when Thor, Valkyrie, and Rocket took off. The only ones remaining were Shuri, Okoye, Steve, Tony, Bruce, and a handful of grieving soldiers. Clint and Natasha stayed in New York to do damage control. No one said it out loud, but “damage control” was really code for
The question made him want to hyperventilate and then run, just run as far away as he could get from all of this. Away from the people looking at him expectantly. Away from the pressure, away from the pain, away from the responsibility.
“Tony Stark,” said a low, gravelly voice on the other end of the line. He didn’t recognize it, but it made his stomach drop to his toes. “We have Spider-Man,” said then the voice, and then nothing for a heart-stopping moment of silence, and then, through static: “...not look for him. Just make the announcement, send the money, and then arrangements will be made.” The line went dead.
Tony didn’t approve of Peter going out to fight crime, but Peter kept doing it anyway. The kid was ridiculously stubborn. Eventually, they came to a compromise: When Peter went out, he had to tell Tony. That way, Tony could either be there in the Iron Man suit, or if he was out of town, he could send one of the suits and operate it remotely. He preferred to be there in person, but he did what he could. Peter complained that it was like having a babysitter, but he stopped complaining after Iron Man saved his neck more than a few times.
“I have an assignment in Brunei starting next week,” she said without introducing herself or any sort of greeting. “Fury says you can come with me if you want.”
“He sent a message.” Her voice was clipped, which told Steve that the situation was urgent but she couldn’t stop whatever she was doing to deal with it. Hence why Steve was on the other end of the line.
Still smiling in an infuriatingly pretty way, the reporter holds out a valid-looking ID. Tony actually has no clue what real press credentials look like, so he just says, “I don’t like being handed things.”
Sam literally took Peter by the scruff of his neck and tugged him away from Loki while Bucky moved in close to Loki, Wanda glaring intimidatingly beside him.
“Steve!” Pepper caught his arm almost as soon as he walked in the door. “Our annual holiday party is coming up. You’re invited.” Her tone said,
“- then he could do it again.” Steve held back from rolling his eyes. He wasn’t sure what type of person Tony Stark was, just yet, but he was familiar with scientists who wanted to replicate the serum. They all wanted to play God or to create an army of super-soldiers. It never ended well.
That was the other thing keeping Tony up at night: Steve and whatever the fuck was going on there. Tony had exploded at him last night -
After taking Natasha’s advice and looking into Tony’s files, Steve was more confused about the man than ever. He thought about Tony all the time - at night, in the shower, even on his morning jog with Sam.
“The timeline is suspicious to say the least,” said Fury, sliding a new folder across the desk to Steve. This one was thinner than Stark’s, full of pictures instead of documents. Each photo showed a different scene with the same two people: Iron Man and… someone else. A smaller blur, usually hard to see. In one photo there was a clear shot of his face. Well, his mask. It didn’t give any indication of the person’s identity. “The incident with the radioactive spiders at MIT happened in August. This guy,” he pointed to the blur, “emerged on the streets sometime in October. He calls himself Spider-Man. That’s not a coincidence.”
“Maybe not,” Loki shrugged, “but it could take years to find Thanos by searching the galaxies. Much more time efficient to draw him out. However, I’m sure that our friends on Midgard will be mindful of the fact that like the first time, their plan may not work. If they can’t literally chop off Thanos’ hand, then they’ll need a different course of action.”
True to her word, Pepper kept them out of the same classes as Flash, but they still ran into him. “Hey, Penis Parker!” He called across the lobby, ensuring that a passing crowd of students stopped to look at them. Peter flushed, but didn't respond as Flash appeared beside them, looking unbearably smug as usual. “Did you see the flying car we brought? Pretty cool, right? I helped develop that. And what exactly did stupid Stark bring? A phone? It must suck working for someone so lame.”
“Hurry up!” He complained, making a few weak jabs at the spider, too far away to really make an impact. “It's going to eat me or something!”
"You're only dilated five centimeters. I'm surprised you didn't come in sooner" Bucky muttered something that sounded suspiciously like 'stubborn bastard'  "You have five more centimeters to go. You can walk around this room, or lay down but I suggest not going far. Would you like me to send for your friends?" Steve nodded and Adia excused herself to go and get them.
So, I'm including the Punisher, because I love Frank Castle. Imagine how badass Frank and Bucky would be together. Should I add anyone else to this little H.Y.D.R.A take down team? I was thinking maybe Deadpool, but idk what do you guys think?
“Hello my beautiful girl” Steve said to Maria after she was on the table. She cooed at him, reaching up with her hands to try and grab his beard. In retaliation he playfully bit at her fingers, making sure to use his lips and not his teeth. After her diaper change, he lifted her into his arms and cuddled her close, just like he had done with James. It was all a part of their morning traditions.
"You didn't either" Steve pointed out, watching as Maria started to crawl to a concentrating James who had re picked up his blocks. Of course, now was the time she would grow bored of Dora, not in say about ten minutes after Tony found out she and James existed. Tony laughed on the phone but it was bitter and broken.
One last thing; will Thor, Bruce, and Clint ever get back with the team? And the answer is yes, we just have to be patient.
"Wanda?" he called gently from outside her door. "It's Steve" of course it was, who else would it be? He rolled his eyes at himself. The door opened a crack, and Steve took that as an invitation to talk in. Wanda was sitting on her bed looking out the window, and it was the pose you would see in movies after a girl or boy had their heartbroken. It was all fictional, it was never a look that was supposed to be on Wanda. The kid had suffered enough.
“We have to fix ourselves. The stones are not going to do that. We have to do that.” Steve acknowledged.
Red phone: Unfortunately, Kevin is also 27 and married to Pepper’s assistant, Sarah. New rule, I can't date anyone born after January 1986. I’m trying to avoid the events that led to any Tony Stark sex tape existing in the first place.
Director Stark: Ms. Marvel and family are coming here. You know outside of the one cousin that’s a Shield agent.
D FitzSimmons: While I doubt he's going to leave Hunter now. He shouldn't because if we can get the stones back, then we can bring Bobo 2 back from the snap. Bobo 2 deserves to actually be happy.
Agent Johnson: Robin’s drawings were right. Odin just past and Thor is now crackling electricity. Oh shit!
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. I’m sorry I forgot to mention this last time, but all times are Steve’s time zone. We are just going to assume that Steve happens to be in the same time zone as South Africa. You’re getting this in under a week because this is probably the last quiet moment on vacation I will have. The next chapter will probably not be posted before August 5.
The random text showing up on my screen is creepy. Send an actual text message or something else next time.
Genius Princess: I'm glad to see that progress has been made now that the evil one has been vanquished.
“No, but you are my Leo.” Jemma placed an arm around him and this time, thankfully, he didn’t pull away. “We were friends long before we were lovers and we can be friends again. I want to be your friend.”
Agent Laura: I see Friday being a little Emma is a universal constant no matter what form she is in. I wonder if she’s made any progress on Spider Venom.
Me: Any way, once the decision was made, but before it was made official, I was picked up for the sake of being a bargaining chip.
Thank you to everybody who read and reviewed the last section. You're all wonderful. Before I really get busy, I have an artwork chapter for you. Is anybody curious to see what Lily Bear was working on before Tony had to rescue a certain spider?
Me: We tell each other the truth, but we make up answers for the public which is pretty much the story of my life
Agent Laura: The Guardians probably won’t get here until after our next meeting. But they are going to send me what they have on the stones. Friday and I are working on it.
“I think we finished that around 1 AM, but before he collapsed into the bed, Peter said that Hunter brought breakfast and left us some stuff in the fridge. If you behave, I’ll bring you a bacon cheese sandwich.”
Love: I think that’s adding to the speculation. Why would his assistant be with Pepper if he wasn’t on his deathbed?
The new consultant: Or because you just broke up with your boyfriend yesterday and you now know who he really is, so he needs to reassess things. That's why he's not making a move now.
Me: If you want to cultivate a friendship and eventually sleep with him when you’re both on more stable footing, then you need to at least acknowledge that to yourself. You can fill Tony in later once you’re more certain.
“Usually he was the one who fed the disgruntled employee that did that sort of thing to the wolves. He’s always been very protective of me.”
Me: I want to have sex with you. It has not happened yet because we are in different countries and you’re a war criminal. Also the time we did meet up recently, I was under medical restrictions due to surviving an assassination attempt.
“Do you think we could have another Siberia?” Steve asked once Tony was done ordering dinner, their very late dinner. The clock said it was nearly 11 PM local time. Tony got there around 4 PM local time, and they were together ever since. No wonder Tony needed food and a break.
Anthony: However, I’m more concerned with Pepper. If anybody could figure out how to take down a super soldier, it would be Pepper.
Anthony love: Your lack of response is making me believe that you’re no longer on Earth. With the Princess and little birds help theoretically, I’ve tapped into the interplanetary communications network, but there’s a lag time.
“Disney is now planning to do a whole cinematic Avengers universe with movies based on our real-life adventures. We are each getting separate bio pics and then a New York movie, except for Natasha and Clint for some reason.”
HSBF: Probably. I have to go. I’ll text message you in a couple of days. I have a therapy appointment in like 10 minutes.
Me: Apparently, not fast enough. The board knew this was going to happen eventually, you know since the sex tape scandal right after mom and dad died almost 25 years ago. So I don't know why they are calling emergency board meeting's now. PR has been working on this for the last week. There was an email. I know because Yo-Yo made me read it, twice.
Counselor Laura: I think Friday may have talked you into that too because she was working with Leo to fix things. At the same time, I think I needed a friend as much as you did back then, and that's why we bonded. My Tony did, anyway. We did become friends, and I think our friendship helped him work through a lot of his other issues. This included mending fences with his Steve, staying sober, and getting diagnosed correctly.
Steve: I’ve been busy trying to coax Simmons out of the framework. She says she’s in their consulting with an imprint of Fitz to see if he can help.
Me: Yes, and I think dad owns most of them. There is a giant collection of the stuff at the property on Long Island. You have to understand that pretty much the only normal kid toys I got to play with were Captain America memorabilia. Even though, Jarvis and Anna tried their best, I was treated like a little adult too often. Aunt Peggy actually got that for me and now I feel dirty.
Me: You are very skilled at that but I don’t think it would have made me sign the Accords. Also, please remember who’s probably reading this.
“You are covered in kids and arguing with your daughter. It’s adorable. Ana can you get me a picture of this? Or maybe a video file?” Steve asked.
Me: Your ex-girlfriend is a sadist. I had no idea that you were into that sort of thing. Did she bring out a whip during bedroom fun time? Everything hurts right now and not in the fun way. I bet we could do it the fun way.
“I’m fine with that and someday you’re going to have to share that childhood trauma with me. I have no trouble avoiding restraints for right now. Maybe later scarves?” Steve asked.
Me: Now we’re saying the same thing again. Except this time, it is humans first. No Inhumans allowed.
Red phone: A registry of all enhanced people. Or as I like to think of it, “The easy way for super villains to get the addresses of the people who want to kick their asses”.
“Okay, I think there’s a bug with Karen and she thinks that Monkey Lover is two different people,” Tony seemed puzzled.
She had told Tony more, but that might be because she’s closer to Tony, even if the Tony she spoke to was not her Tony. The sponsorship bond is strong. Tony has been her rock during the separation. So, of course, she’s going to be comfortable telling this timeline’s Tony about the drunk text messages.
Counselor Laura: Is it safe to assume that Mr. May-Rogers never worked with a therapist to deal with any of his issues? Has anybody here seen a therapist?
This interlude is from the perspective of May Parker-Riley’s cell phone. She is not okay. We are now in post Homecoming territory and we are a month or two out from the start of Agents of Shield season four. I’m tweaking the timeline a little. Also please note that for the sake of this story, the Infinity War prelude comic book will be viewed as Apocrypha. I may pull out things I like but just assume most of it doesn’t happen in this continuity.
Oh, you thought it was over, not quite. You know I always give you more. Although I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for their comments and kudos on the final chapter. The big sequel will be upon us soon, coming Valentine’s Day 2020. Here’s your first taste to end our year right. Although, if you decided not to check out Text Messages from the Edge of High School, please at least read the post-credit scenes. You’re going to need them for what happens next. You have time.
“Maybe we could list things we want to work on instead? I definitely want us to have a better relationship.” Tony suggested.
We had a good talk after I read your original email. Although, I wish you would’ve called me. I was so worried when he didn’t show up, especially with the reports about the ferry. I know many times I skipped school to go on the ferry with my friends.
D Fitzsimmons: I wonder what my boss will think of that. It's less strange than the fact that my grandfather is sleeping with Hunter. I guess Nana and Bobo have the same taste in men. This is so weird.
Red phone: Good subject change. Yes. Jarvis and his wife, Ana, were not able to have any kids. Some robbery that went wrong decades before I was born. I don't know the details, but they treated me as if I was there child.
The mechanic: But they may be heading over there with one of the SI UK’s lawyers to make him sign an NDA as well as agree to stay the fuck away from you, now that you have your shiny new eight-figure job with a Penthouse and your own Audi.
Director Stark: Also, MJ keeps getting you books on polyandry. I think she’s trying to tell you something. Just take the third option.
“That sucks. That is also another part of your history that is not in any book. Plus, you being bisexual isn’t public knowledge.”
Tony: I know what you mean there, Sweetie. I joke about it, but maybe we are not ready for that. I’m not really. I want to be ready, but I’m a little fucked up with more abandonment issues than my poor therapist can really handle.
Me: Being a vigilante should qualify. My child has a handler, but no one bothered to tell me or consult with me regarding how we should handle the fact that my child has superpowers.
Me: Also it doesn’t matter what we call the bloody things. The ghost of girlfriends past would still turn you over to Dr. Suarez. Both versions of you.
Me: Because of course my love life is so much more important than anything of actual importance. I’m so glad I’m going to be in a place where the press can’t get too close for a few more days.
“No, I’m not that cruel. And besides, he was the one who bought that one.” Tony answered, just as Agent Davis showed up with their food.
Me: If I remember correctly, that’s when I ended up spending a month with Aunt Peggy and she told me about who you really were, so I kind of got worse after that.
I’m going to apologize now. We’re going to have a lot of notes. This is the first section that I’ve written post Agents of Shield. This seems odd because this is also the first chapter I am posting after WandaVision has premiered. I enjoyed it. Although I feel like we're in the framework again. Please remember no spoilers in the comments for 30 days.
Monkey Lover 2: I think my baby brother has a closer relationship with Tony. Before we just occasionally emailed and messaged each other semi-anonymously until the Framework happened. This time around, he keeps checking up on me and invites my counterpart to dinner a lot. I’m not sure my baby brother as you put it would have decided to take Radcliffe’s side over his girlfriend because he was so desperate for a father figure because he has Tony Stark filling that role.
Maybe some time apart will allow your husband to get his head out of his ass and learn to appreciate what he really has. Also, we really do need medical assistance. I keep accidentally making contact with things with  sunflower oil and well, the boyfriend got shot in Mumbai. Not good. He’s healed but I am still not happy. So we really do need you.
They were currently sitting on one of the couches in the guest suite in the embassy. It was a lot nicer than the Shield rooms on the other floors. Around 3 AM, when Dr. Leopold showed up with his husband, Hunter pushed them all to sleep. They were only successful in getting her and Flash to leave. They opted to just sleep in the same room together. Which was a great decision because sometime around 9 AM, Peter just crawled into bed with them. Afia texted her pictures. She wished she could just send them to Ned, but Peter and Flash would kill her.
Ana Junior: It is already on the list. However, my main objective is to acquire the locations of all the stones in 2018.
Francis: I’m not planning to get back into the dating scene any time soon, and I already learned that lesson with Phil. I’m sorry I didn’t call or text.
“I know you’re upset, but this is a not terrible thing.” Steve explains, holding him closer. “Honestly, as much as I really want to do those things with you, I’m not sure if we really are ready for that. I’m not sure if I’m ready. We still have things we should work through. You’re still scared I’m going to leave you or you think that I’m only here because Bucky is in cryo, when the truth is I’m here because I want to be with you." Tony responded by pulling Steve down for a kiss.
Tony: I love you because of you. Because of your heart and your stubbornness and everything that is you. But it took me a while to realize that Howard’s standard yardstick of Captain America was not you. I think that caused some problems in our working relationship later on. I really wish that baggage would not have been there.
Anthony: I can see that. You know, you have a thespian look-alike too which is probably the only reason why I've seen the Nanny Diaries, twice. Is Snow Piercer on your list?
Tony Bear: Tell her it was a joke before she threatens to disembowel me, again. People talking bad about me in foreign languages is not a new thing. A lot of that's actually going on right now. This is why I keep a lot of the languages I speak off my CV. I'm working on improving my Mandarin just for her. I’m learning all sorts of new course words.
Me: I feel like my legacy is mostly murder bots and the Merchant of Death. I have tried to fix things but I can’t bring Red’s parents back from the dead. Even club Tahiti wouldn’t work at this point.
“I told the President yesterday that I was taking the job, so I am allowed to video chat with you since I’ve been authorized to negotiate with the Secret Avengers and Nomad.”
Tony Potts: That doesn't matter. We could just plop you back in your own timeline seconds after you disappeared.
“Which leads to my number one bad quality, which is I forget to do important things like eating and showering when I’m in the zone. Sometimes I think Hunter is more my nanny than Morgan’s. I remember to feed Morgan, but I forget to eat myself.” Tony joked.
Me: I don’t think I ever threatened to kill her. BTW she is here three tables over keeping an eye on things.
Me: I did not need to know that. Also, Leo’s request is time sensitive. We might have a situation and we need your AI to help.
HSBF: And maybe in 70 years people will hear your name and instantly think of the Stark foundation or the Jarvis foundation.
"Of course you do. So what else happened in Siberia? Why did you and Steve ended up physically fighting each other?" This is why his boyfriend shouldn't have a professional for a friend. Laura would do this. Laura did do this, which is how we ended up getting help in the first place.
Me: We are just going to focus on your relationship drama today. I assume you’re back at home base recuperating?
CoulsonPJ: You look really good in that suit. We already have enough bad publicity from the last time the Avengers started beating the hell out of each other because they are unable to use their words. I wish we could just tell everybody it was unresolved sexual tension, but that may make it worse in some circles, so please for the love of your shield, do not hurt the consultant.
“I like the vows hey use during the seven steps.” Steve told Tony while they were sitting at their table more than an hour later. The ceremonial part of the wedding was over and they were now mingling.
I would just like to let you know that the reason why Friday did not respond is because she still grounded for the great therapy Journal incident.
“Julie might do that anyway. I’m surprised she agreed to do our wedding, after what happened at the Fitzsimmons wedding last year.” Steve remarked.
Blue phone: I am really observant with the little things. Do you actually think they would try to arrest Laura?
The Mechanic: I am fully aware I owe you like at least six shoe baskets for that. I’m also willing to admit that was stupid and dangerous. As soon as I realized it was stupid, he was on a plane back to the states with Kevin, my assistant who BTW is a registered foster parent.
Me: I don’t even want to think about how it was before the Accords were adjusted to handle the underage with powers. The best case scenario would have been Coulson finding him first.
Me: Actually, I think we’re going to have to come up with fake answers for everything. The next question is “do you think you know how you’re going to die” or something along those lines. I don’t think they could print a straight answer from either of us on that one.
I’m glad you got back before school starts. I hate school. Can I just go to college now? Also, when will I get lab time again? I know I can’t be there all the time, but I can do Saturdays again.
Anthony: Like your best friend murdering your current boyfriend’s parents while he was brainwashed by a cult that worshiped an ancient inhuman that totally stabbed them in the back. Or, more importantly, the fact that you blame yourself for said BFF getting kidnapped and brainwashed by the cult of Hive.
“Just doing what my country asked me to do. BTW honey bear, you are not necessarily a fugitive right now. Mostly because most countries won’t extradite you. I would just like to thank whoever’s brilliant ideal it was to give Nomad and the secret Avengers credit for saving my ass from the Watchdogs and getting the power back on. Really, it made all of us look good. Also, Malta has your back.”
“Nooo, you have to stop. Listen to me. Steve definitely wants to go out with you! He’s socially awkward, and you’re socially awkward, that’s why you’re having communication issues.” Jan grabbed Tony by the face again. “Trust me, I know what I’m talking about!”
Tony spun around. “Will you stop making so much noise, Steve? I’m concentrating here!” Something caught on his boot and he tripped. He flailed and landed in a loud, ungainly heap.
He was almost at the edge of the Timefog when a hand clamped down on his shoulder and stopped him in his tracks. Steve’s voice registered behind him. “Where do you think you’re going?”
From behind, Loki called out, “Better take him home, America Man! Don’t want your boyfriend lost, do you?”
Tony’s sigh became a deep, jaw-wrenching yawn. The shower would revitalize him and then he could get ready for Jan’s party. He promised her he would be there, and he was going to be there, no matter how much he wanted to crawl back into bed right there and then.
Tony ignored his burning face and thanked whoever was listening that he had the faceplate down. “Whatever. Don’t get in my way.”
A red and gold lighter lay in the dirt near the boot print, seemingly dropped haphazardly. It was covered in so much dirt it nearly blended in with the ground. Steve picked it up and dusted it off. The fuel chamber was full and it was functional.
Having made his decision, Steve sent off a message on his phone before tucking it back into a pocket. He took a breath and stepped forward.
“Is that why you’ve been lurking outside the club?” Tony tried to stop and turn, but Steve’s hand remained firm and steady, and he nearly tripped over his feet. “Who knew you were hiding such creeper tendencies under that perfect face. Wow.”
Tony flapped a hand in the air. “I’d love to, JARVIS, but I need to finish up some things in the lab.” He dismissed the AI’s concern and headed down to the basement. It was only when the elevator dinged insistently at him that he realized he’d closed his eyes and was leaning against the wall. He pushed himself upright with a groan and stumbled into the lab. Holographic displays sprung up around him as he collapsed into his chair. There were two projects from the company that needed finalizing, and three for Pym. If it all went well, he could be done in six hours.
Steve made quick work of the rest, and before long he was able to free Tony from his prison. Any exposed skin that was in contact with the roots was raw and the deeper wounds glistened with a red tinge. He gave Tony’s shoulder a solid shake, but the other man stayed unconscious. He was still breathing though, and seemed otherwise uninjured.
Steve’s hand was a solid point of warmth. “You’ve been saying that a lot recently. Have you been sleeping at all?”
Properly distracted, Steve barely managed to deflect a hit with his shield. The hit skittered off the vibranium and clipped his shoulder. He gritted his teeth and leapt back a safe distance before pivoting into a throw. The shield sheared through the robot’s neck and sliced through another robot’s chest before bouncing off the force field and back into Steve’s hand.
From the shadows, from the corners of his mind, something creaked. It came from everywhere, nowhere, multiplied, echoed.
“You’re the second person who’s asked that today. It’s fine, I dealt with it.” Tony touched the cut self-consciously. “It’s not like I have a healing factor. This is just how normal humans heal. Slowly.”
“You okay there? You look constipated.” Tony had linked arms with Jan. The plan was to get some much needed coffee, and then a round of selfies in the quad before the next class.
Tony turned a corner and disappeared from view. Steve’s heart irrationally lurched and he sprinted toward the edge of campus. He turned the same corner Tony did and slowed to a stop.
Jan turned her head so quickly Tony thought she was going to sprain her neck. “Oh my God, you’re right! His face is so red. Wow. I guess he heard us.” She turned back and glared at Tony. “And I’m serious, he was totally asking you out! You need to say yes!”
Jan pursed her lips and considered him. “You know you always look good Tony, but you’d look even better in this!” She shoved her phone in his face, expectantly gleeful.
Tony clawed at his uniform and screamed into his face. “You’re hurting me! Why are you hurting me? Why are you
Tony woke up on Wednesday feeling better than he had the entire week. The aches were less prominent, his head wasn’t pounding, and he didn’t feel like keeling over when he stood on his feet. The strange preoccupation he felt seemed to be gone as well. No disturbing noises made themselves known, no creepy sensations, no odd shadows at the edge of his vision. Even the cut on his face was less red and angry. In fact, Tony felt so normal he wondered if he hallucinated the past few days.
He didn’t let go until they were well clear of the Timefog and back on campus grounds, to hell with anyone who saw.
Pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes, Tony breathed deeply. He focused on the hard edges of the gauntlet digging into his skin. It was a cool night with a slight breeze. He shivered and counted to ten. When he had enough of a grip on himself, he lowered his hands and opened his eyes.
Roots spiked out of the splintering ground and he dove out of the way. “I’ll take that as a yes.” He leapt over a root ripping itself out of the ground and hacked with his shield when more whipped in front of his face.
Steve helped him up into a sitting position and leaned him against his chest. “I think we should wait until the fire burns itself out before we leave. Just in case.”
