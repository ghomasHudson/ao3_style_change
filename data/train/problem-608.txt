“Not tactful but understandable”, I said. He nodded.
I supposed that that was true. And I had seen in our Presteign case with Mr. Dai Davies just what the late arrival of the railway could do to a place.
“Meanwhile Mr. Brown has returned unnoticed to the works and has obtained the copy of the plans that his rival has been working on. These he brings to his partner in crime at the railway-station. He cannot have been among those who attacked his rival otherwise he would surely have spotted the obvious and corrected her error over the hair.”
“Not if we catch him up!” he said. “Come!”
“Nor those at Eleanor Biggs's place three doors down”, she said. “I wondered if it was something in the water even though we are all off the same pipe and I asked her about it, but she said no.”
The Final Problem
The Adventure Of The Veiled Lodger
My other message might, I suspected, take a little longer to elicit a reply so I decided to spend the rest of the day explaining to John why teasing the man that you love is generally a bad thing, especially when said love can flip the red card across the door and then spend hours reducing you to a happy pile of goo. There was something still wonderfully domestic about sitting there reading, while a gloriously naked city doctor lay there gasping on the couch trying to gather his wits.

It was the summer of 1907 when our tranquil life was disturbed by the arrival of an unexpected visitor. It was June and, a little coincidentally as it turned out, England had just seen its first motor-racing track opened at Brooklands in nearby Surrey. Our caller was Sherlock's brother Guilford, now sixty-four years of age and thankfully rather less annoying. His marriage to Miss Petra Shepherd had turned him into something perilously approaching a respected Victorian gentleman which I supposed proved that miracles did indeed happen.
“Sherlock”, he yawned as he scratched his head, “why are you up so early? And what are you doing out.....?”
“Not bad for a fellow heading towards fifty”, I teased. “My horny hooker, my perfect mate. I love you so much, Bren!”

I sighed, and decided to lie back and think of England while he had his way with me. There were worse fates.
The following afternoon I had to go in and pick the jumper up – so of course bloody Lazarus had recovered and wanted to go with me! God bless Mrs. Smith when she met us in the High Street that she said nothing about it, although heaven only knows what she thought I was playing at! Sherlock remained glued to my side and I reached home feeling slightly depressed that I had been unable to retrieve the thing.
“He is not dead then?” I asked.

“Correct her about what?” I asked.

I too remembered the boy, similar in appearance to the man before us but a fraction of his build, all knees and elbows as only a teenage boy can be. And of course the case, one of our more unusual ones (and there was plenty of competition for that title) after which Sherlock and I.....
“Very peaceful up here”, I sighed.
“Hector always wanted to be in the army”, our host explained, “but he has something wrong with his principal arm which means that he cannot fire a gun. We played this charade for him, little knowing just what trouble it might bring us.”
“Heads on poles, I suppose”, John said.
“I think twice is enough for one night, John”, he said, edging backwards. “I had better leave you with that inside you so you can recover....”

This was one of those adventures which, strictly speaking, did not really constitute a case. Yet the outcome was rather amusing and indeed it led to that rare thing, Sherlock telling a lie. And in the end showing once more just how much he truly loved me.

Mr. Malone nodded.
As it was lunch-time and my stomach chose the steps of the police-station to inform me (and Sherlock, and a startled passer-by!) of that fact, we decided to adjourn to a local restaurant before going to the station. The establishment we chose was pleasant enough although there were three somewhat unsavoury young fellows in the corner who were eyeing us up for some reason. I was glad to leave the place especially as they did not even serve anything with chocolate, the heathens!
He leaped towards the stairs and I rushed after him. We both tried not to make too much noise and fortunately someone in one of the rooms was playing one of those new phonographs with the door open. We came within sight of the door to Room Five – and there was a large gentleman outside holding a gun!
“Give it to me”, he said bravely. “If I have to then.... I suppose I have to.”
The prolonged blow-job I gave him may or may not have been a factor in that perfect understanding. Just possibly. He was certainly in no fit state to manage the stairs down to breakfast – I had to take him a plate up – let alone leaving our inn! At least I very generously helped him by removing all the bacon from that plate, otherwise he would never have managed it.
“Indeed”, Sherlock said. “Would any gentleman do, or does she have more specific requirements?”
1910. The dynamic duo visit the capital again for a memorable experience, John's fears of flying prove all too accurate and, miracle of miracles, he actually manages to say No to Sherlock!
“We should be honoured, but I will respect your wishes and not inform the actors beforehand”, he said. “I suppose that you are right; it would only make them even more nervous. Mr. Freeman nearly forgot his lines twice last night, as it was.”
“Of course we did have a form of that institution before the earl came along”, said Mr. Smuggity-Smugness.
“What, out here in these temperatures?” he teased. I swatted at him.
“The relationship with Mr. Budar is all but over”, Sherlock reassured me, “as the fellow in question is returning to his home country very soon. But your niece – a leopard does not change its spots, as they say.”
My heart skipped a beat. John was standing there. John, panting furiously, gazing at me with those impassioned hazel eyes. I stared at him for a moment then I broke, hurtling towards him and falling against him as he struggled to slide closed the door. I whimpered piteously but he held me at arms' length for a moment.
I shuddered. John sending any of this to my mother was becoming a more terrifying prospect by the hour!
John may have described me as not one of the better human beings after I clipped a cock-ring into him shortly after we had left Hereford Station and spent the whole journey teasing him. It took him five minutes to stand and get out of the coach, and the yelp he gave when he stepped down onto the platform had two porters come running. He actually cried in the bumpy cab back to Baker Street, from which he took a full two minutes to get out. I would have made a remark about our landlady Mrs. Rockland's smirking, but I thought of that gun collection and very wisely decided against it.
“Luke loved you”, I said gently. “You knew that.”
He groaned.
I frowned. That dratted leering Cornish ex-fisherman again. It was a damn good thing that I was not the jealous sort and that had better damn well not be another smirk!

This whole sorry saga had started three days ago when, at my friend Sir Peter Greenwood's request I had left our cottage and travelled across country to Wiltshire and the home of Sherlock's 'other family' the Hawkes. His half-nephew Lord Harry Hawke's wife Alice had recently passed but that was the least of the fellow's problems. All three of his sons had come down with some unspecified illness which, while not apparently life-threatening (yet) had denied all my clever friend's attempts to drive it back. The fifteen-year-old twins Tobias and Trelawney and their eight-year-old brother Harry might well be the last of the Hawkes if they did not survive to have children. It was all very bad.

1918. So many things change – but some men are still complete horn-dogs!
“Need another cushion?” he grinned.
Ironically this had led to a double bonus for both the Great Cake-Detectives, who always 'just happened' to call in on Mrs. Rockland's baking-days. The scandal broke only days after LeStrade's son Galleron had made sergeant here in the capital and resulted in more vacancies when a London inspector moved north to fill one of the gaps up there, which at sergeant level had been filled by Gregson's son Tobias (the two young men were sort of related as Galleron's sister Iseult was married to Tobias's brother Tristram, but sadly it was back to the bad old days as both men – who, even more weirdly, both liked cake and shared their respective fathers' remarkable tendency to only arrive at Baker Street on baking days! – loathed each other with a passion. Perhaps they would end up as another pair of Cuddle Bunnies and damnation if I am not getting a disapproving look from 'someone'!
“But can we not take the District to Mark Lane and then double back?” he asked looking at a map set halfway up the footbridge. “That does not look to be much further and the underground platforms at Liverpool Street are surely on different levels.”
The Adventure Of The Velveteen Porter
The H.M.S. Implacable Incident
This year was marked by three births and one death. My nephew Jack's wife gave birth to their second son Aaron (named for a friend of Jack's) who joined young Dane. And my daughter-in-law Anne gave birth to offspring at either end of the year; Henry on the second day and Sarah two days after Christmas. Ivan really was my son, the dog!
Moments later we were indeed both coming home (sorry!). I had the blue-eyed bastard back and I was determined never to let go of him again. All was right with my world even if he had been inveigled into some case during our separation and I would have to write it up for him – his handwriting was one of the few that made my own look comparatively legible! I could even endure my brother's and sister-in-law's teasing as long as I had Sherlock. Which I did.
There was to be another and rather surprising development in the case before we could decamp to the March. Just after I had sent out to our friend Ginger for whatever he had on our unpleasant client (hopefully something incriminating!) we had an unexpected but welcome visitor. To wit Mr. Peter Wolf whose father we had helped a couple of years back.
If I mentioned how lucky my relatives were with their randy younger lovers and that we really should have Benji and Danny down to the cottage one day, then I enjoyed John's desperate efforts to try to 'persuade' me out of it! He may have been panting like Stephenson's 'Rocket' afterwards, but of course I was too kind to remark on it. I did not even smirk.
The two young men held each other while looking hopefully at me. I smiled reassuringly at them both, they deserved some happiness.
That Christmas season was marred by the death of my stepbrother Campbell. He had been ill for much of the year and Alan had taken him of all places to the Scilly Isles, where nearly half a century back I had met Lowen in the terrible Adventure of the Repellent Philanthropist. Sadly the sunshine had failed to work its magic and he had passed five days before the Lord's birthday. I helped Alan arrange for his burial in their local church in Buckinghamshire and made sure that he was all right financially; Campbell had left him everything and thankfully there were no other relatives around to cause difficulties. It was therefore a quiet season for once, and I felt the loss of my stepbrother deeply. He had been a good man and had done much good in the world.
“I moved to London some years back”, he began, “and am now full partner in a successful practice up in Camden Town. This affair concerns a client of mine, an elderly gentleman by the name of Mr. Percy Gable. He owns a large property with copious grounds in Golders Green which is an important part of my story as it is in an area being scheduled for development. You may have read that there was a fuss over the new railway being built up from Charing Cross and Euston over Hampstead Heath which has only just been resolved; because of that there will soon be a railway station near the house† there which will increase the value of Mr. Gable's property still further. I understand that he has already been offered and has rejected several large sums for the place.”

Prince Pale collected our two guests the following day. Mrs. Rockland, bless her, told us that meals would be left outside the door for a week and that I was to try not to break anything. Except the doctor.
“I only met him the one time myself”, our guest admitted, “and that would have been not long after you yourselves. He was about sixteen then; so thin that he would have disappeared if he had turned sideways! I would as I said have made some inquiries myself but my new boss Superintendent Worton – he is all right as bosses go but like so many he has that thing about officers doing work of a private nature, and I do not want to get off on the wrong foot with him having just been promoted ahead of my time. Even if the worst is true, there would still have been no crime here.”
catch.”
One of the best rooms in the little cottage (after the main bedroom of course!) was the bathroom which was positively luxurious for such a place. While we had been waiting for the transfer of the property Sherlock had with the permission of the seller taken the opportunity to knock through to an adjoining large cupboard, making the bathroom large enough to incorporate a huge iron bath. I do mean huge; the two of us could fit in it easily.
My son was still dazed by recent events but he looked round in surprise when we alighted at Berwick and drove down the road through Chuffingden, finally stopping at one of the terraced houses that Sherlock had had built by the ford a few years back.
He reddened for some reason.
“Of course”, Sherlock said.
Something had changed.
All right, I was grateful for some of the suggestions, even the ones that turned out to be physically impossible (we had fun proving that!). An especial note of thanks must go at this point to the mysterious 'Mister Lyster', writing all the way from the United States of America whose set of works 'The Highly Elastic Adventures of Shylock Hulme and Johann Whitsun' were more than instructive. It took us weeks to work through them all, and Bob our postman chuckled darkly at the sudden rise in boxes and parcels delivered to the cottage as well as at my more than usually dishevelled state around those times. I would have glared at the bastard, but moving all those facial muscles took a lot of effort.
After John had explained to me what my 'other' family, the Hawkes; had suffered from, I had I admit been fearful that the line might still die out. Of my three grandsons Tobias had married a lady who could not have children while Trelawney was still making my nephew Tantalus regret those nine years that he had on his insatiable younger lover (his last letter had been barely legible, but then it had been just after I had introduced my grandson to the delights of a certain Baker Street shop). With their sisters being married to gentlemen of only average calibre ('not half a clue between them!' John had quipped, which had been doubly annoying as the bastard had known that he was right!) that left just young Harry, now twenty-two, to continue the dynasty. Fortunately he had just married one Miss Geraldine Jephson, and my youngest grandson insisted on inviting us to his wedding even if, on our arrival, he for some reason asked us 'not to be

We had also had a fortunate escape with Billy – the insatiable Mr. Benjamin Jackson-Giles's second son – who had survived against the odds on the Western Front. His time there had been curtailed when he had been asked to escort his friend Sherlock's nephew young Major Carlyon Holmes back to England, as the latter had suffered a leg injury and I know that his noble father feared for his welfare, but fortunately he and Billy grew as close as his father was to Danny, the two younger men joining the two elder in the 'House of Sin and Ill-Repute' as Danny called it.
But he was mine and I would not have changed him for the whole wide world!

“John is sixty next year”, chirped a certain blue-eyed genius who wasn’t getting lucky that evening. I glared at him.
“This discovery places the landlady in a somewhat difficult position”, Sherlock went on. “She does not wish to
“I am seeing them when we go to London”, I sighed. “I will apologize then.”
Ah yes, his 'arrangement' with Sheikh Khalid of Arbir, the popular ruler of a small but strategically situated Middle Eastern state. The sheikh had wished to restrict himself to the woman he loved so Sherlock's nephew had, so to speak, stepped up to the plate. Or rather up into the princely bed. At least one hundred and twenty-eight times according to the official records, the dog!
The Trifling Case Of Mr. Mortimer Maberley
I looked up at Sherlock in confusion.
Life was a bit of a mess at times.
Postscriptum: Thanks to the wonders of the modern telegraphic system, my grandson and my nephew received an unexpected present from the latter's previous 'employer' the following month. Sheikh Khalid wrote that he understood both the importance of appearances and the difficulties in obtaining reliable servants – so he had dispatched the two giant eunuchs who my randy nephew had somehow found the time and energy for while in Arbir and who had been in on the harem secret! I suggested inviting Bill and Ben along the next time my relatives visited us, and John gave me such a look!
“I always admired that part of you, John”, he said softly. “In another age you would have been the knight-crusader, heading off to slay the dragon and rescue the fair damsel in distress.”
“How may we assist you?” I asked, smiling at the appellation.
“He is only a boy!” he said at last.
“Ugh!”
“It was because he loved you that he left it all to you”, I said, “save that small amount for the godson that you so generously named after him.”

Mr. Bennet was a cousin to Lord Tankerville who had unwisely placed him in charge of the Tankerville Club. He had turned it into a place where old men could physically and mentally abuse young (including underage) black men for their 'pleasure', but he was found out by Sherlock. He and his accomplice Mr. Blake were offered a choice; plead guilty or go to their lawyers and try for a short sentence. Rather unwisely they chose the latter; both men were picked up within minutes and then deposited on the streets where the men they had abducted came from – with the families of those they had abducted waiting for them. What was left of their bodies was found in the Thames the following morning.
“Did we not pass through a station at Marazion?” John asked.

“This is dashed awkward, John”, he said. “We have been friends since the year dot, but I have to ask you a really painful question.”
“Hey! Bad dead consulting detective!”
“What do you mean by that, sir?” the general demanded testily.
As I have mentioned elsewhere we still received a lot of correspondence through Mrs. Rockland in Baker Street, even five years after our departure. There were of course many appeals for Sherlock to investigate this or that case, but from time to time we had contacts with old friends who asked for help. One such came at the start of this year when the twins Balin and Balan Selkirk, whom we had helped when they had started their hotel on the shores of Lake Windermere, inherited a large plot of land over in the United States from an aunt that they had not even been aware was still alive, only for the whole thing to become entangled in legal problems. Sherlock was able to use his contacts to sort things out for them and they received some handsome proceeds from the sale of the land, part of which they insisted on donating to Sherlock's orphanage.
“What did you do?” I asked.

“On Saturday evening my client along with the other two men left their office having locked it with the plans safely inside, after which they all went their separate ways. Mr. Leeds was attacked by at least three men while walking along the riverside path and left unconscious. He had taken the slightly longer walk to his house through the park, and as he was left in a storage hut there was little likelihood that he would be discovered. Only the fact that he was due to meet a lady friend off the train the following evening and that she had the wit to call the police when he did not appear, initiated the search that found him. He had also been drugged; I can only assume that chloroform was used in the attack and that they opted to keep so young and fit a man under to make him easier to handle.”
“I quit after an injury last year”, the giant explained. “Thirty-two is getting on a bit for someone in my position, where we get the worst of it. When Ned had all this blow up he, uh, asked me to come and support him.”

I was sure that most people back in Northumberland knew just what our relationship really was but even in the Roaring Twenties one did not talk about such things, and any man who was openly in that sort of relationship with another man could expect severe opprobrium.

I smiled at the obvious insincerity in her tone.
“My unpleasant brother Mycroft is, like the late and unlamented Torver, bitterly against that idea”, Sherlock said with a smile. “He thinks that the franchise is far too wide already, although I assume that he has not yet voiced those opinions in our parents' house.”
“There has not been a problem with your father?” I asked. I had pursuant to the matter of the stolen gold bars made arrangements to prevent any retaliatory action being taken against Mr. Thomas Wolf; as I have said before, one could never fully trust large institutions.

Plus the note was clearly written by a left-handed person, yet Mrs. Whitlow from whom it purported to come is right-handed. What is going on?”

The same month of my loss saw a general election in which the Conservatives remained the largest party but lost seats to both the Liberals and the then still new Labour Party.

The new political force had promised much and it remained to be seen if they could deliver.
“It is my cousin Gareth”, he said. “As you know he lives with Mercy on the north coast of Devonshire; a wild area so they say.

She had two sons and two daughters, and it is their eldest son that is the issue here, by name of Galahad.”

“I cut his fuel-line”, the boy said, “and loosened four of his wires. Once he reaches flying altitude the plane will fall apart. He took off about ten minutes ago – he came early of course – so he should be down by now. I thought I heard an explosion in the distance a couple of minutes back, but I was not sure.”
“I should have been with him”, I said, “but I am delayed here for a rather important case although it will definitely be concluded by next Monday. I am awaiting news before I may or may not have to do something, so I have some time free. Is it anything that I could help you with?”

We both looked at him in confusion before John suddenly spoke up.
I was feeling doubly happy that day because I had finally completed my final additions to the now extensive Sherlock canon and tomorrow Nick would take 'Elementary 160' with its forty new cases to the publishers for a final check. It had been hard work choosing the cases to be included and in the end we had put aside notes from well over a hundred other cases (including the several dozen those that my love had undertaken during my time in Egypt) that we had deemed not yet suitable for publication yet, although we would leave those to a later generation. Also the good news from London had been that the awful King Edward the Eighth who had become King-Emperor on his father's death in January had abdicated because, he had claimed, 'I cannot do my job without the woman that I love by my side'. Hah! I had been proven all too right about his shallow character† but the good thing was that his much more suitable brother Albert would replace him and would reign as King George the Sixth. With his only having had two daughters so far that made a new Elizabethan Age likely in the future too.
Even better, Mr. Holmes who'd helped me out arranged for old Geoff next door to get that job he'd wanted down in Yorkshire, and Ned moved in there. He was now only a connecting door away, which was great. Even if I was in a bit of a state when we walked to work every morning – my man really knew how to wake someone up of a morning!
I smiled over what remained of my own meal. Thirty years since we had first met far too many moons ago in Oxford. His impossible hair was flecked with grey now but it only made him look even more distinguished. It was as untidy as ever although that was more probably due to….

A senior judge who 'went rogue'. Queen Molly alerted Sherlock to this and the judge was slipped the location of the safe house where Mr. Edmund Fitzroy, a key witness against Professor Moriarty, was hiding, along with the news that he was about to be moved. The judge went round there with his gun to try to silence Mr. Fitzroy but was shot dead.
“They are in trouble?” Sherlock asked.
“Gentlemen, I promised you two solutions to this crime”, Sherlock said, sitting before a roaring fire, “and two you shall have. Which one you choose to reveal to the public is up to you of course, but please hear me out fully before deciding.”
Both men looked at him in horror.
“I see”, I said. “Mr. Bassett-Evans was only half-right in his assessment, was he not?”
The young red-headed fellow who had arrived with the West Country pest was vaguely familiar, although I was fairly sure that we had not met before. He was in his early twenties and of an impressive musculature for one so young. And he really did not need to be wearing a vest and shorts that tight as if he had just come from an athletics meeting and had not had time to change. The young these days!
There was a certain irony in the fact that our next case began on the day that it did, October the eleventh. I had been reading in the 'Times' about the establishment of the Women’s Social and Political Union, a splinter group from the suffragist movement which had been pushing for equal rights for women for decades now. This new body promised – or rather threatened – ‘deeds, not words’ and I was concerned that the general movement (which I tacitly supported) might well be set back by such un-English aggression. Time would indeed prove me right; the new tactics would only serve to harden opposition against extending the franchise and it would be the essential part played by the fairer sex in the Great War which would result in women eventually and deservedly obtaining the vote.
“Well, while we are still here....”
I sniggered at the image.

“That is good”, our visitor smiled, mercifully unaware of my inner turmoil. “I was going to call on the young fellow while I was down here but I wondered if you gentlemen would be so good as to check something out for me first?”

Some people believe that they have a guardian angel watching over them. I am not that religious (although I would never say as much to Mother or I would get a clip round the ear) but if that is true then our family's guardian angel was in the human form of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who had assisted our family on more than one occasion. The last two times were when Father sought his help to try (unsuccessfully, alas!) to prevent Lion's father from murdering his mother, although he was able to secure justice there in the end, and more recently when that harridan Miss Reinelde Medlow had levelled false accusations against me. In both cases Mr. Holmes had ridden to the rescue and settled matters as much as they could be settled, and I know how truly grateful Father was even if he did complain (a lot) about Mother simpering at the fellow, which despite her denials she did indeed do. Three times, one of which was when Father had been standing right next to her!
On Monday morning what was left of me hobbled very slowly back down to the village. Thank the Lord (and Lowen) that the cottage had been fully stocked for our time there; it had saved us precious time and what would have been some painfully long walks to get food. Judging from the look that someone was giving me as we waited for the 'bus, that first-class compartment was going to be well-used on our return home. As was I!
Damnation!
At least it had been a good start to the day as we had been blessed with some good news. Ivan's son Luke who was training to be a doctor had last year married a most attractive brunette called Miss Sarah Wickham, and was now the proud father of a baby boy – my first great-grandson. And best of all they were calling him Sherlock, after a certain blue-eyed genius who had cried when I had told him the news. Sherlock Watson!

It was only a few minutes past ten when we arrived and I was relieved as we approached that there was no sight of an aeroplane, which I surely would have been able to hear had it taken off on time. Rather than go to Captain Henderson's office we went straight to the hangar where we found...
I frowned. I did not like Mr. Patterson and I knew that he was friends with the sergeant, which poor judgement further devalued him as a human being. But the American was for all his manifold failings a deeply moral man, even if his morality like his patriotism had to be forced down everyone's throat at every opportunity.
We would be making an extra large donation to the plate this Sunday!
I was about to agree when he suddenly pulled me into a kiss, his tongue pushing into my mouth. I was feeling a little weakened as he had scented me after my shower that morning and that always affected me. He pushed me back against the door and continued his assault; I moaned in pleasure then again as I felt his hand working inside my trousers and underpants. Those long fingers of his wrapped around my rapidly-hardening cock and began to jerk me off. I was putty in those hands and only his support kept me from collapsing to the floor as he jerked me towards an orgasm that left me breathless.
“A lot of superstitious mumbo-jumbo”, Mr. Thomas Fleet snorted. “This is the twentieth century for Heaven’s sake, yet they still believe in that rubbish. Father has been trying to buy the field for ages but the owner refused to sell right up to his death last year. Fortunately his executors accepted a more than fair price for it, but of course the villagers then started whining that they had lost access to the Sands.”
“You have the worst timing!” I grumbled. “The cab-driver will hate us!”
I tried batting my eyelashes at him. That usually worked.

“The telegram that came before we left this morning was from Carl”, he said, trying to pat down his impossible hair. “Or from Danny; he says what is left of my elder brother cannot hold a pen just now, the bad boy! They say that Mycroft did take legal advice on challenging the will but was told that he was certain to fail.”
“The play is not that bad”, Sherlock said comfortingly once we were in the cab on the very bumpy road to the theatre. “Look what you grew up into.”
The boy sighed heavily.
I finally got lucky just over a week later when Sherlock contracted a severe runny nose and had to rest on the couch all day. Although I had the correct medicines with which to treat it, I lied and said that I needed something from the chemist’s in the village as well as needing to order some of my favourite cologne from London of which I was running short (I was sure that I had had more than the single bottle that I had left but then I was never very good at keeping track of things like that as my mind was usually on far more important and mostly horizontal matters). He was obviously cross at not being able to go with me but I insisted he stay out of the driving rain. I was forced to give him a very thorough blow-job before he would let me go, but then as a doctor I had obligations to my patient which I felt obliged to fulfil. I always put my patients first.

“Blood?” the vicar gasped. “What? Who?”
“You saved me, sir”, he said. “Again.”
“And why he did nothing to save me from the firing-squad”, Ivan said angrily. “Then I wish to have nothing more to do with the Leedses. As far as I am concerned I am now a Watson, through and through.”
“Only the first part?” I asked, awed. He nodded.
His eyes shot open and a feral smile creased his features. In seconds he was between my legs fingering me open while I writhed above him, waiting for him to get on with it. Get on with it he very quickly did pushing in and bottoming out with a grunt then setting to work straight away by fingering my nipples with one hand and rubbing my cock with the other. There was no way I could resist such a combined assault nor did I wish to, and I was coming in minutes. I was surprised that he did not come inside of me, but when he stood on the end of the bed I realized why.
He grinned at me and slid elegantly out of the vehicle before walking round to me. I stared in awe at the sleek blue-black automobile.
“That she does not return to being her normal and terrible self?” Sherlock suggested. We all laughed.
“What am I looking for?” I asked.

“Coffee with the caffeine taken out”, he said calmly. “A new process; they found it quite by chance. Did you not like it?”
“I.... I never....”
“The reason that we are here”, Lady Bradstock continued, “is our growing concern for my husband. I should explain at this point that the earldom is unfortunate – in my opinion at least – to be afflicted with that the lawyers call 'nominative inheritance'. The title goes to the eldest son as per usual but the bulk of the estate around Stalwarton, the Oxfordshire village where my father-in-law lives, can be willed to any direct male line descendant at the whim of the current holder or, if he has no descendants of his own, to any of those of his brothers. Furthermore the estate has prospered greatly in the last ten years due to certain investments in gold and diamond mines in southern Africa, so there is much to inherit.”
“I had Constable Davis down in Irchester take her statement”, he said. “He is very sharp, one of our best men. When he brought me it, he said that he thought she was doing that lying without lying thing.”
“In my line of work”, Sherlock said, “it is usual that I start with a crime and then have to work out as the detective novels who mangle the English language persist in saying, ‘who done it’. Writers these days! This time however I have managed to prevent a crime.”
“Oh”, I said, reading down further. “He says that he has just moved to a place called Brierdene which is in the south of the county”, I said. “Do you know of it?”

It was the day after St. Valentine's Day, still loathed by the both of us and not marked in any way, shape or form. Certainly not by the broken man lying in my bed wearing only a thong with hearts on it and letting out the occasional whimper as he slept. Also no, I did not strut as I left him after helping him to hold his heavy breakfast plate. Indeed, showing great generosity I made things much easier for him by removing all that heavy bacon!

“It has”, he said frowning, “and it is most worrisome. I administer Mr. Gable’s estate for him jointly with one Captain William Wulfram, the son of his old army friend. A most reliable gentleman; he quit the army after suffering an eye injury and now works in a bank over in Finsbury Park. He came to me last week, exceedingly worried. Mr. Gable has asked him about selling off his shares and other investments in order to buy jewellery. I am afraid that he means to present Mrs. Bollinger with some or all of it for her ‘efforts’. Then today…..”
The two policemen stared at him incredulously.
Pot, kettle.... damn John!
1913. The shadow of war looms ever larger but life goes on. A day at the races ends badly for one lady, pillar-boxes get attacked because the suffragettes think that that will surely win then support (it does not), and Sherlock uses his money to ensure that there is still only one Chuffingden.
Some teasing bastard of my acquaintance had remarked the previous year that gentlemen of our moderately advanced age (shut up!) should consider getting someone in to help with the chores. This unexpectedly became a reality at the start of this year with the advent to Chuffingden of Master Nicholas Colsterworth, one of the many sons of the gentleman formerly known as Mr. Jaime Lannister, one of our friend Mr. Bronn Blackwater's lovers (although for some reason he persisted in using the term 'tormentors' in his shakily-written letters). Young Master Colsterworth was seventeen years of age and the image of his randy father who was currently augmenting the population of Kincardineshire along with his friend Mr. Dayne. And despite being young enough to be his great-grandson, the horny young bastard had within seconds of arriving here leered at my Sherlock! Harrumph!
The Man With The Twisted Lip
“Can he be stopped?” I asked.
“We shall take the boat out to Fair Isle tomorrow”, Sherlock said. “They make the most marvellous sweaters and I thought that we could buy some, and then celebrate my birthday.”
“He asked her that”, the sergeant said. “She last saw Mr. Leeds on Thursday when she met him at the works. She said that he was very excited over his new discovery, though of course she knows nothing about mechanics so it all went over her head. She says that she just nodded and praised him a lot. Saturday she went shopping in Northampton and spent the evening with her parents. Sunday morning she took the first train up to see her dotty grandmother who lives in Kettering just north of here and cooked a Sunday dinner for her, returning here to meet – or not – Mr. Leeds. Her train came in on time at five to four; the station-master remembers speaking to her as she left.”
I glared at him. Just how did one go about getting a divorce?
This has to rank as one of the cases that I most regret not being able to have included in the 'Sherlock canon', for it involved the overthrow of one of the worst excrescences of modern policing (and we in our time had seem some pretty bad ones, I can tell you!). The villain was the ghastly Sergeant Craig Whitefeather who, to his ultimate discomfort, came back into our lives at the worst possible time and was involved in a crime yet seemingly could not have been. And once again it was the man that so many wrongly call a mere scribe, my beloved John, who solved the riddle and helped me to secure justice.
“That is good”, I sighed.
“Then I got the letter from the blackguard demanding to know what the hell was going on”, he said. “I knew what would happen when I told Scott; sure enough Derek came over that same day and they slipped out of the camp that evening. I put Pitt on duty with McCullough as I knew they could both be trusted to not see what needed to be not seen. My sister let me know he was with her the next day; they live in an isolated place so there is little chance of his being found even in a search.”

He might be sixteen years my senior and bigger than me (worse luck!) but my big brother Ben had no right to give me that sharp look when I placed a single white rose on our late mother's coffin. Thankfully my mother's family were still there and even more thankfully, neither was my godfather which avoided so many complications.
Postscriptum: Mr. Creighton Dallas made it to the United States where he became an estate manager in the state of North Dakota. He died in early 1929 and a clause in his will asked his executors to send a note of thanks to Sherlock and myself for our actions that time in Galloway and to request publication of this story. I have fulfilled his last request.
“However, shortly after her arrival the landlady in question makes a most fortuitous error”, Sherlock went on. “An omission in a grocery delivery leaves her short of mushrooms so, being unable to order more and needing some for the next day's breakfasts, she takes a walk in the charming woods behind her home and picks some wild mushrooms that grow there.”
“I drive very well”, I said loftily, “although I have noticed that the roads are definitely a lot busier these days.”

“The Americans are staging what they call a naval exercise south of Hawaii next month”, he said.
“One of the top assassins in this country, who we had thought safely on holiday visiting a friend in Germany”, he said grimly. “Our job has become that much harder. So we shall just have to change the rules of the game to suit us.”
Sherlock nodded.

“So indeed”, I said. “You are doubtless not aware of it but scientists have recently established a new understanding of the constituents of human blood.

I ate the sandwiches in the cab on the way to King's Cross and had breakfast just before Peterborough, although I was too excited to eat much.

I really hoped that John would come to meet me at the station but I doubted it as I knew his brother's house was less than five minutes walk away from it. Or a very quick cab ride. If he did then there was always the Station Hotel.

Of greater import to the county (although we could not have known it at the time) was the Royal Wedding that year. Normally of course the match of a younger son of a reigning monarch would not have drawn attention or merited much in the way of celebration. But what with the recent war to end all wars and the country looking hopefully to the future, the marriage of Albert Duke of York, King George the Fifth's second son, to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon had led to Chuffingden again being decorated to mark the occasion. The shy young prince had shown considerable tenacity to persuade the lady to sign up to a life of public service, and I wished them both well.
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
The Adventure Of The Noble Beggar
As part of the Coronation celebrations that year, the General Post Office was running a trial air-mail service between the new air-base at Northolt in Middlesex, some miles west of London, and the Postmaster General's house at Windsor in Berkshire, about twelve miles as the crow flies. It had started on the ninth of September and the first flight had been managed in an impressive eighteen minutes. I had found it interesting but had not of course remarked upon it to my beloved, knowing how the mere thought of height made him nauseous. Besides that had been only a week after my fifty-ninth birthday and we were both.... let us say that we were not getting any younger.
The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. The 'Great War' was finally over. I sighed as I half-dozed with my man in my arms and thought of all those young lives wasted just because the vile Kaiser Bill, fled into exile in the Netherlands the previous day like the coward that he was, had wanted even more land for Germany. Never again.
“What about it?” I managed.
I let out a manly expression of surprise as my blue-eyed genius somehow managed to materialize right next to me, and glared at him.
He had been in charge of a local orphanage in the Forest of Dean where he had abused young boys and girls. Despite his father's assistance in suppressing a report into his vile doings, the local people found out the truth and kidnapped him. He was dragged to a charcoal fire and, unlike Mr. Greenstead, was not rendered unconscious before being incinerated.
“'Infectious disease'?” I asked. “What if he talks?”
Despite his brutal ending Mr. Holme, the excrescence who was paid by Torver Holmes to throw acid over his brother Sherlock, cannot be placed higher as his remains were found in either eleven or twelve places across the East End so his actual means of death is unclear (the number of places is also unclear because one part was too small to be officially recognised as his, although there can be no doubt that it was male).
1936. As Germany pushes its luck in the Rhineland, Dane Watson throws his hands up in despair at his relatives. Someone delivers rather more than a new car and John cannot believe his bad luck. Seriously, another one?
“I wish to know the full story of 'Lieutenant Addleford'”, Sherlock said. “It is only fair that I tell you I know who he really is, or at least I know his origins. I also know why you did what you did that day.”
Along with his sister Hilaria he followed the worship of the Egyptian goddess Nut, who sometimes manifested herself as a cow (a cruel author would make a remark about nuts worshipping Nut there, but I shall refrain). One night he went to a field of cows to carry out a ritual and discovered that waving a dagger around near a large and easily startled farm animal was not always a wise course of action. It was his last ever discovery.
Oh come on!
“He will need it!” Sherlock growled.
“How?” I asked. He smiled at me.
“A boy but, I am sorry to say, a criminal mastermind in the making”, I said firmly. “It seemed that both his uncle and cousins stood between him and a massive inheritance – but following the tragic loss of your son Aeneas he knew that you would prefer to leave your money to a male heir and a Gable, and also of your interest in the supernatural which he decided to play on.”

Having seen my nephew in all his glory one day I knew that he could rival the great (in every sense!) Mr. Galahad LeStrade in one department. But it would be better not to mention that as it would doubtless make John feel..... John.
Sherlock led the way across the corridor and into a large well-lit room where about a dozen people were gathered round a dais which had a large and very solid pole stretching all the way up to the ceiling. They were clearly setting up to draw something or possibly someone as there was some sort of post for someone to lean on, and I watched with interest. None of the gentlemen however looked anything like what I expected Mr. Galahad LeStrade to now look like after eight years.

Not long after this it was my son Ivan who alerted us to a further problem in the capital which, rather tiresomely, necessitated a trip there for us both. I also knew that Sherlock had been in communication with Mr. Tudor at Swordland's over some matter so something was definitely up. Although I really wished that he would stop with the knowing looks.
“How did it get there?” the earl asked.

He pouted, which was damnably unfair of him given the circumstances. He knew full well what that made me want to do with him, and my eagerness to solve this case rose still further. Like something else; mercifully I had worn the looser trousers for once.
There was one passing of note that year, although neither Sherlock nor I dwelt on it. Lady Amelia Dundas died, of a stroke apparently. I wish that I could say that I mourned her, but frankly I was glad that she was gone and that that chapter of Sherlock's life was closed.
“I shall get Tompkins to show you it”, he said.
“Yes, but at a price”, I said. “Now that he knows we were there he will likely do two things. He will alert the rest of his gang and he will try to intercept us himself, almost certainly at Liverpool Street. Which he is certain to reach before us.”
On a happier note, at the end of August we had the first of two policeman visitors to our little haven in what would turn out to be a momentous year for many reasons. Superintendent Baldur had been set to retire from the Metropolitan Police Service, but the recent police strike and the resignation of the Chief Commissioner Sir Edward Henry in protest at the lack of government support had left the force in a mess. Well, a bigger mess than the usual one.
“Is the gentleman's client known to you?” Mr. Guilford Holmes asked, looking curiously between us. “Because I have to tell you, from what little he did say of the matter it does not look good.”
“If the doctor would sign my books before he leaves”, the landowner smiled, “that is fine!”
“I can always come!” he grinned.
“On the contrary”, he said. “It shows rather a lot.”

In June we were unfortunate enough to have more dealings with my least favourite Cornish ex-fisherman of all time, Mr. Laurence Trevelyan, of whom I was not the least bit jealous whatever anyone smirked... said. He had asked Sherlock if he could arrange for him and his silent brother Blaze to attend the opening of the new cathedral in Truro down in their native Cornwall and, despite the event being all sold out, Sherlock had duly gotten them in. Then some teasing bastard had suggested that he might invite the ogling rogue
“I love it when you pout!” teased one soon to be ex-friend.
“Grandpapa sort of said that I had to be Gable rather than a Cooper when I come of age if I wanted to ever inherit anything”, he said. “He cannot make me change my name but I would do it to oblige him as he is a decent fellow, even if he did insist on a private tutor for me. I disagree with my uncle on most things but we are united in stopping that witch from taking advantage of a fine old gentleman!”
“No”, I said. ”Your grandson, David.”
I managed to give Lion some quick lessons in handling a weapon over the next few stops; fortunately we had a compartment to ourselves otherwise we would surely have attracted some attention for that. We had reached Stratford before we encountered any trouble. I looked out of the window once the train had come to a stop and quickly pulled back in.
“Ladies first”, he said. “Miss Alexandra Ockham, aged twenty-one. One of those aggressive, modern women; I would not call her a lady if only because she would I am sure take offence! She lives with her mother and two sisters at a house in Irchester close to the railway station. She has been dating Mr. Leeds pretty much since he came here in July. He was due to meet her at the station on Sunday but of course failed to show. She waited a little while then walked to his house and found it empty. A neighbour told her that Mr. Leeds had not been home the day before – I love nosy neighbours! – and she started worrying. She came to the station and we initiated the search that found him just under an hour later. It would have been sooner but he took the riverside walk home rather than the more direct route past the edge of town. They are digging up the road in town just now and it is very dusty that way.”

That too seemed odd. If this fellow's grandfather lived in the south of the county then why had he secured a place still relatively far away?

“I am sorry”, Sherlock said quietly, “but there is every probability that he did, and that that was one reason for your being disinherited.”
I shuddered. The raven-haired nurse had arrived here just after poor Herry, and had the sort of attitude that suggested she enjoyed making everyone's life as miserable as possible. Fortunately the men and women had separate wings and she was on the women's ward.
“As with all poisons the body works to expel it, most usually through the hair”, Sherlock said. “When she called me in on this case I questioned Lady Ursula about her husband's so-called attacks, and quickly worked out what was happening. I asked her for his hair-brush with as much hair as she could get on it, and the doctor then tested it for me. Your youngest son has been exposed to constant low levels of Chemical A for at least the past three months, it having been dosed into the fudge that he has a weakness for.”

Hopefully in Outer Mongolia!
“People expect extremes in the theatre, doctor”, he said soothingly. “We have to exaggerate characteristics to make the audience laugh or cry. I take it that you have not see the performance yourselves as of yet?”

First of course my dear wife Elizabeth, who is always right about everything” (I caught the blush from 'someone' as I said that). “Then my father and mother, especially my father who deferred his retirement for the good of the Service when he did not need to. And finally my father's friends Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, currently enjoying their retirement somewhere far away. They helped my father on many occasions throughout his long career, and always out of the goodness of their hearts.”

Finally the two of us went out into the now dark garden. Chuffingden lay quiet and undisturbed far below, slumbering under a night-blue sky from which all the clouds seemed to have fled.

I knew that Stevie was desperately unhappy and Hetty resigned to it but it turned out that the Gods of luck were with us Watsons for once; my nephew was found to have a mild degenerative eye condition which, while it would not greatly affect his sight in normal everyday use, made his wielding a gun unwise. Instead he joined up in a non-military capacity which, although I was sure he did not like it, made all around him heave a (silent) sight of relief. Especially as we knew that his disinherited younger brother 'Heinrich' was on the front line fighting for the enemy.
The actor playing Doctor Watson not only looked nothing like me – his taste in clothes was terrible – but the character was
“It is like a set of dominoes”, Sherlock's brother had explained in the carriage on the way here. “Austria attacks Serbia who calls on its ally Russia which unlike six years back is now ready to answer that call. Russia calls on France for help while Austria calls on Italy and Germany. Berlin is looking for any excuse to attack France but their common border is too well-defended so they will have to go through Belgium. Since we have guaranteed that country's neutrality because of its ports facing us, we look set be dragged in.”
What did concern me however was that John did not seem to snap out of his 'funk' as he called it. I started to grow anxious about him.... and I was not the only one.
“I do not see it”, I said, not in a complaining tone.
“What do I want with fair damsels?” I said lightly. “I have you, remember?”
Master Colsterworth's arrival to Sussex had been arranged with his father when he had rather unfortunately ended up dating a young lady in Scotland who was in fact his half-sister. Hence Mr. Lannister had asked if we might find some post for his son who wished to become a mechanic. Fortunately the young gentleman rapidly took up with Beattie Turley, the grand-daughter of Mrs. Turley who owned the sweet-shop and always seemed to give Sherlock more barley-sugars that he paid for for some reason (yes, and to simper at him!). Luckily I was not the least bit jealous of our new houseboy's lantern-jawed looks or his stunning muscular physique.
We looked as two familiar figures got out of the front of the train and hurried away towards the lane that led the short distance to the Low Level Station on the Great Western line to London. Moments later the woman from earlier followed them.
“Dad asked me to stand in for him at the reception”, Ben asked, eyeing me shrewdly. “I think we both know where he's gone, don't we?”
“Ironically however it was that very cover-up which proved their undoing. Such was the force of the bullet that it passed clean through the victim and ended up embedded in the scarecrow, leaving only a slight mark on the fellow's tattered coat to betray its passing. The murderers' hurried search for it was therefore fruitless and they had to leave the area.”

We had only been at our cottage for two nights following our return from Wiltshire to assist Sherlock's grandson Lord Trelawney Hawke when we were summoned to the capital on a matter of great urgency.

The year was also marked by three major events. In the War, the Germans finally challenged the British at sea but the Battle of Jutland was inconclusive; we lost more ships but it was they who fled back to their ports with their tails between their legs. Also at sea and as a consequence of the War there was the loss of the ill-fated Titanic's sister ship 'Britannic' which hit a German mine in the Mediterranean and sank in under an hour despite the design changes implemented after the loss of her sister. Fortunately this disaster occurred close to the coast and all but thirty of the over one thousand people on board were rescued.
“I do not have all the details of the case”, he said. “That is for the lawyers. But I believe it all comes down to the fact that a rival factory produced something identical to what they were working on, and they believe that he leaked some plans to them.”

“It is where she meets her confederate from the Derby works”, Sherlock said. “We were told that there was no train that would have got someone to Derby and back that evening, but it was possible to go to Leicester and back. There is just time for her to hand over the copies of the plans that Mr. Brown has supplied her with and then to return as far as her grandmother's house in Kettering. We were told that that lady was 'dotty'; if she had been asked and had remarked on her grand-daughter's arriving later than had been claimed her evidence would likely have been dismissed.”
“Is that true, Eddie?” my father asked.

“That definitely rules him out, then”, Sherlock said, looking relieved. “This incident took place at a quarter to four on a Thursday afternoon; seemingly I must focus my attentions on the other people involved. You say that you are happy with the fellow's work?”
He looked at me and nodded.
I sighed. I was so whipped!
Of course I did. The psychic cult-leader, the man who had saved my and Sherlock's lives many a time. Sometimes one could not make my life up; I doubted that even Sherlock's mother could....

The head of Malleus Maleficarum, a major London crime syndicate. She was short and physically similar to her husband Edred, and used that to masquerade as him as part of a bank-robbery. She attempted to murder Sherlock when she knew that the game was up but was shot dead by LeStrade.
“I shall be informing your father that I have that information”, I went on, “and that if her persists in his current bad ways then I shall feel perfectly entitled to share it with the whole world. I have also found out that he has been making covert efforts to destroy his daughter's medical career, which he will be told to desist from. Should he decide that he knows better – something that I consider all too likely given his actions thus far – then I shall arrange for some friends of mine to 'chance to bump into him' of an evening and to make sure that he fully understands the way things are now. Much as I might wish it to be otherwise bullies like him often only understand one language in my experience, that of the violence they themselves use.
He thanked me again for calling and I left. It was almost lunch-time so I adjourned to the nearby town for a surprisingly pleasant meal in a local restaurant before calling in at the local post-office. The postmaster was surprised at my request but acquiesced when he knew who I was. The paper I wrote out was copied and then signed by myself, himself and one of his clerks. I left him a copy before leaving to catch a cab back to a horribly empty Baker Street.
“Try not to make it obvious”, I whispered as I waited for the last form to sign, “but we are being watched.”
“I see”, Sherlock said. “My second question is to you both and may seem rather strange but I do have a reason for asking it. Has Mr. Thomas Bradstock been shaving any more of late?”

“I suppose I had better start by explaining the area”, he said. “The Mazarin Stone is we think as old as Stonehenge but is a solitary standing stone set in a field by the river for reasons as yet unknown. We have made some digs around it to see if there were ever any other stones nearby but have found nothing. The thing is huge and not of any rock type found in this area, and the nearest place one can find it is up in Moray, so it must have either been rolled or floated here for whatever reason. The local legend is that the ancient peoples regarded it as a fertility symbol, and even today some villagers still swear by it.”
“That is business”, I said. “These documents state that this woman is seeking a divorce from her husband and waives her claim to everything except custody of her children.”
Three times!
In the meantime I had Vic and our own hillside cottage, although if I ever find out which smart-arse up here decided to put the name 'Hill Cottage' (the original name of Sherlock's place before it became 'Elementary') on the front, then wings or no wings I am going to deck them! Vic of course found it hilarious – being dead does not seem to have improved his so-called sense of humour, worse luck! - so I took him inside and then fucked him repeatedly until he stopped smirking. Which he eventually did.
None of them were geniuses but they worked through that one quickly enough. The brothers looked in astonishment at my half-nephew, who looked equally dumbfounded.

“This weird business of the Millington Square attack, sir”, he said. “Mrs. Ollerton was attacked by three men and had her purse stolen. Her husband was with her but he's a weedy little runt; one of them was enough to take him down.”
My twin had asked to see me alone again before our departure, which I supposed was understandable. It was strangely unnerving, the way that he was able to both look so much like me and yet not like me at the same time. I had always eschewed the supernatural but what with one thing and another my innate logic was driving me to the point of accepting it, at least as far as he was concerned.
We both watched as Joe guided our father out of the room. He was fifty-eight now and the man in whose arms he would soon be lying naked was seventy-three, but they loved each other as much as Dad had loved my poor mother now finally at peace, God rest her soul.
I stared at him in horror.
The 'A' was topped with Sherlock's deer-stalker and had a pipe hanging out, while the 'L' had a red cross and a stethoscope wrapped around it. I pulled my love into my arms and held him as he cried tears of happiness. It was just possible that I may or may not have shed a tear myself (although of course mine were manly tears) and that I generously allowed Sherlock a lot of that manly embracing that he liked for much of the rest of that day. But then that was my job, to keep him as happy as he had been when he had seen that sampler.

A natural son of Sir James Saunders, he learned that his father's will could be interpreted in such a way as to make him the heir, and having secured employment with him under false pretences he set out to attack his father's horse to try to drive him to an early grave so the family might then buy him off. He was preparing to administer the fatal poison to the animal when it stampeded to enjoy its storm, driving his syringe into his own body.
“My son would never do anything like that!” the old man said hotly.

Despite his dreadful behaviour over the years Mr. Mycroft Holmes had somehow convinced himself that he should still have inherited everything, so after getting barely two per cent of the estate there had all too inevitably been an argument and Sherlock had returned ruffled and upset.

Should you persist in your current approach to any or all of these, I will have no choice but to reveal your base and utterly reprehensible behaviour to the newspapers. And to the society magazines.”

“Because if King George dies then his son simply takes over”, Sherlock said. “I know that Guilford has some reservations about that young man, rightly so I fear, but the constitutional disturbance to our country would be minimal, at least at first. If the French president is shot while visiting the capital of a supposed ally however, all hell would break loose. The French have never coped well with change and their response to any German attack would be weakened. Thus Mr. Cumberbatch, who is by the way an excellent shot, would only need one bullet.”
“My own gallant knight!” he purred and I could feel myself beginning to grow hard. “All you have to do is wait for me to finish this drawing so that we can have sex.”

He's... you've met him, sirs. He's sure no-one could ever want someone like him. Please, say you won't tell him!”
A thought occurred to me.
It had been two wonderful years since our last dealings with a Cornish ex-fisherman of whom I was not the least bit jealous and that had bloody better well not be a smirk or.... I would not be happy. Now we were in London that November and some horrible bastard insisted on us calling in on him no matter how much I pouted (and I did not pout!).

I was also, rather foolishly, worried about Sherlock being on a train. I knew that he would not go through Grantham (scene of the second of three inexplicable rail crashes around that unfortunate time), his route being out of Euston rather than King's Cross but I could not shake the fear that something would happen while we were apart. I scanned the papers anxiously the next day for any news of such a calamity and I loved him even more for sending me telegrams first from Glasgow and then from Oban to say that he was tired and footsore (and un-caffeinated, God help those around him!) but that he had made the ferry to Lismore.

A wiry fellow whose hair was almost as blond-white as his relative's, he greeted us affably and thanked me for bringing him the letter. He also leered at me just like Lowen had done all those years ago, again to the clear annoyance of someone in the vicinity who seemed to have developed a sudden cough.

My muscles felt like jelly and he must have taken pity on me for he suddenly reached down and pulled my legs up, striking my prostate full-on.

“Not a lady”, Mr. Malone grunted, “and bloody huge. Would probably get a place in a rugby team if she wanted!”
In early spring Elizabeth, Duchess of York (Prince Albert's wife) gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named in honour of her mother. The country's reaction seemed a little over the top, I felt, especially as there would likely be sons later on even if the increasingly wayward Prince of Wales failed to marry. My fears about him were proving increasingly well-grounded; Sherlock had told me that only the 'stealth-editing' of pictures of him doing his duties had prevented those shots of him looking totally bored from appearing in the newspapers.

“May I inquire as to whom that was sold?” I asked.
The answer came as something of a surprise.
I stared at my twin in horror.
“This all seems quite pleasant”, I observed. He nodded. “Your grandfather treats you well?”
I managed to slip away from John to use the bathroom in the local tavern, and used that time to slip out the back and meet Day so that I could pay him for his 'services'. If we strode back in chatting like old friends who had 'just happened' to meet up, the furious look on John's face said that I would be regretting that very soon.

1904. People change over time – but when Sherlock and John investigate the fears of a good friend, they find that some people can change an awful lot! And John is hideously embarrassed by a huge weapon.
“It will be difficult but you will need to keep an eye on your husband today”, Sherlock said. “Even though I do not expect anything to be tried until tomorrow.”

“Have you informed the police about this?” I asked politely.

“No, that is someone else's job”, he said. “They are a good bunch, although what with all this anti-German feeling there was some muttering against poor Hal because of that African rigmarole earlier this year. Stuff and nonsense in my opinion; we are all Germanic if you go back to our Anglo-Saxon forbears and no man can help his family.”
“I have one more question”, Sherlock said, sending me another annoying nod. “One of the reviews mentioned a scene where Mr. Cumberbatch walks behind a pillar in the middle of the stage and then disappears. Am I to assume that a trapdoor is involved?”
Throughout the first half of that year we had again been working on our still copious notes, in order that we could release more of Sherlock's cases to a general public still demanding them at a level that was exceeding even my publisher's expectations. Again the process took rather longer than expected and there were several that I was disappointed not to be able to include, but we still increased the total by a further twenty to one hundred and twenty, again to the benefit of our favoured charities.
Both ladies looked at him in astonishment.
“You two!” he grumbled.
“You may have to wait”, she advised us. “I have just sent up another visitor, a Mr. Smith.”
I nodded.
“Why do you think that we could help?” I asked curiously.

Most irritatingly he had sidled out of swatting range as he spoke so I had to settle for a scowl. My nephew and his wife both chuckled.

“Elizabeth went into the shop and turned on the waterworks for the owner”, she snorted. “It is frankly pathetic the things that some men will do just because a woman cries! He told her that the fellow who had paid for the photo was Lieutenant James Anderson, the son of Colonel Theobald Anderson if that means anything. The lieutenant is not the one by the way; the object of her affections is the idiot lurking right at the back.”

For some reason that question seemed to perturb the young ruler.
“The Great Western Railway is not that impressed with the Newlyn route”, I said. “They have told me that they will discontinue it if it does not pick up soon.”
I've never been one of those insufferably cheery fellows like Jay (Forthright) and with a face like mine that was understandable, but six month after Mr. Sherlock Holmes had sorted matters over Ned and four after the horny little bastard had moved in next door, I realized I was really liking my life. Even if I limped to work alongside some smirking horny little bastard every morning who insisted on a thorough wake-up call that ran from the bedroom via the bathroom to the kitchen.

There was one more event of note that year and it was what had I both hoped for and yet feared. In December my son Ivan's marriage to Miss Anne Gower produced a son whom he named Luke after his maternal grandfather. I too was now a grandfather, but my offspring would never know me.
My great-nephew threw a furious hazel-eyed glare at him.
In our many cases together it was often the small things that tripped a criminal up and allowed Sherlock to bring justice upon them. So it was with me in this instance, and I only realized my mistake the following Thursday when Mrs. Whitlow returned with all Sherlock's washing. The excellent woman did not even raise an eyebrow at the rather large load of both our clothes and bedding that she took away in its place.
I had not really expected that our path to that wonderful cottage on the Downs and the enjoyment of all that rural splendour (with those super-reinforced beds!) would be a smooth one. With our luck, such an expectation would have been totally unrealistic. But even with the fellow temporarily residing downstairs and currently sitting in our fireside chair with an innocent look that even John would not have believed, this was just downright
The Adventure Of The Dashing Hero
Said smirking blue-eyed bastard received a telegram during my brother's stay but unusually did not tell me what was in it, although I did note that it had come from abroad. We accompanied Stevie back to Berwick Station on his last full day when my love surprised him and me by asking if he might divert to Edinburgh on his way home and deliver some important documents that my friend needed sent to a lawyer in the Scottish capital (Stevie was living in Helensburgh just north of Glasgow at this time, having been made a full partner in his firm and put in charge of all its Scottish branches). In return Sherlock paid for an upgrade to first-class accommodation for my brother which was nice of him, although I was suspicious as I had thought he had told me that he had sold his Scottish interests some years back. Still, I said nothing. I trusted my Sherlock.
“I will not bore you with long scientific names which will mean nothing to anyone here”, he said. “Let us call these simply Chemical A and Chemical B. Both have been tested and certified by Doctor Watson here and also by a leading scientist in his field at Oxford; of their composition there can be no doubt. Chemical A is toxic but not deadly except in much larger amounts than you see here, while Chemical B is almost completely harmless. However, when they are imbibed at the same time, the
It was not only my nephew who was in for a rough night!
Lady Bradstock herself came out to greet and to usher us in. Once inside we met the rest of the family who were much as she had described. Her husband was young and smartly-dressed, definitely tending towards portliness (the fudge!) and had hair that was almost as bad as Sherlock’s. His two elder brothers both had the sandy-brown hair I could see in the many portraits in the entrance-hall and neither looked that pleased to see us. We were shown into the earl’s room where a gentleman in his late fifties was sat by the fire.
“Just how are you going to that when I ache with every move?” I asked not at all testily.
The Adventure Of The Crooked Man
We both had cause for mixed emotions that November, John received a letter from his son Ivan; he and his wife had just had their second child, a boy, and in respect of he and I having helped his family out, they wondered if I would agree to their naming him John – oh, and would my beloved please be his godfather?

The carriage outside was indeed being driven by Mr. Bassett-Evans, who I thought looked tired but happy. As I mentioned back in our original case with him, he really did ‘shine’ with the same sort of inner goodness that I had once seen in our fellow half-brother, the ill-starred Lord Tobias. In these darkening times there was it seemed still hope for Mankind.

It sounds like a cliché to say that it was only at that moment I became aware just how loud the tick of the grandfather clock in the corner was, yet it was true. I stared at our host in shock. Sherlock of course was unruffled.
