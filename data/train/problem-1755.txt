Sherlock grabs a napkin from the table and wipes his mouth. ‘Bit salty there, now were you, John?’
Slender.
‘I may not be the best boyfriend, and I know I get caught up in my experiments, forgetting entirely the date and time for important events, but I truly thought tonight was our planned dinner to celebrate your achievements.’ He takes his hands and places them on either side of my cheeks, thumbs generously tracing my jawline, causing my legs to give just a tad at the pads of his fingers on my soft skin. Beholding my eyes, searching for the right moment, Sherlock claims my lips with his. Gentle. Strong. Content. My Sherlock. His tongue begins to beg for entrance, but hastily retreats understanding this tender moment should not be disturbed by the arousals both of us can feel pressing against one another’s thighs.
My back arches, fingers lightly pull on Sherlock’s curls as his mouth takes me in. His hand pushes my hips against the countertop, giving him the push he needs to keep me still. While we both know Sherlock craves that demanding nature from me, he lives for the thrill of being the one in charge, putting his well developed skills to fruition. The slight bob of his head hardens me even further. I groan and grip the sides of the counter, knuckles white, and my bottom lip encased between my teeth. The sensation of Sherlock’s mouth wrapped around me sends my toes curling. I can hear my cock slide in and out of his mouth at a faster pace; he’s found his rhythm, and I don’t have much longer. His free hand goes underneath and firmly grabs my arse, releases and begins pulling his fingers along until he reaches my shaft. Combining his hand with his mouth, I can barely think, let alone breathe. Sensing my completion, Sherlock speeds up, twisting his hand along my wet cock, pulling his mouth to the tip.
I take a step back, realizing that I have Sherlock backed up against the counter, a slight embarrassed pink color creeping up his neck and onto his cheeks. I chasten myself. Of course he does, and for Sherlock, this is a big deal. Surveying the room around me, I can see that everything is in place just the way I like it. My newspaper folded next to the plate with two lightly buttered toasts and my tea, no sugar but a splash of milk, in my favorite coordinating mug slightly near Sherlock’s place setting. Not a hair out of place.
‘John.’
‘Oh so you finally decided to come home. How very nice of you. Did you soak yourself to the bone in the rain outside, John?’
‘No, Private, that’s an order. Drop and give me -’
'Excuse me, Sherlock, but do you think you’re the right person to be making tea? I hope this isn’t as good as my cuppa, or else I’ll be out of a job. What’s next?' I push my chest against his, trailing my breath up his neck, and placing my lips just underneath his earlobe. Fervently I trace my tongue in a circular motion that I know will elicit the right kind of sounds demanding liberation from his mouth. Releasing my mouth from his neck, I whisper on to his skin, 'Will you be better at sucking cock than I am? Sherlock Holmes, World’s One and Only Best Cock Sucker.' I can feel his smile widen and a forceful deep-bellied laugh vibrates the space around us.
Slowly tracing my upturned finger along your sharp jawline, I nudge your chin upwards, exposing the blank canvas of your neck. I hear a slight hushed moan as my lips make contact scattering a constellation of kisses along the base of your throat. Before I am able to continue painting a masterpiece on your skin, you force yourself downward. Noses grazing one another. Eyes locked. Breathing each other in. It could be my last breath, and I would always use it on you. I claim your trembling lips with mine coming undone as you part them, giving me access. Your taste never wavers. My chest hitches as you dominate our dance pushing yourself forward crowding my sense. Our rhythm is tender, sure, and unabashed. How long we are captured in this intimate moment I know not, and I care not.
‘John, before you get upset … I must have you know, after your temper tantrum I had to venture to my least favorite Tesco to get this damn jam you had me break whilst bellowing about your inept stature at our favorite Tesco. I’m sure they’re never going to let us back in with the scene you pulled today …’
Pivoting on my heel, I snatch the basket and head toward the checkout. 'Looks like we’ll be without any jam for tea this week!' I shout over my shoulder, unable to look back at him standing there all alone to clean up the mess he’s made. Those puppy dog eyes of his would have me back to him in an instant, apologizing for my tone and snogging him thoroughly right there, making a scene at our favorite Tesco. No, no. I press onward towards the machine, scanning each of the items - not the blackberry jam as it was the last jar that smashed to the ground in my fit. I scramble for my trifold, flustered with myself and that damned temper of mine. Seven counts in. Five counts out. Eight counts in. Release. I’m able to pull the card from its place, slide it into the machine, and punch in my pin - 7437. Hurriedly, I grab my receipt along with my items, because damn me if I forget the shopping for the week, and make my way back to Baker Street.
My head swivels round breaking the eye contact with the possible apology letter, and I come nose to nose with Sherlock.
I can see Sherlock’s smug face wiped right clean off, eyes widening, and finally clicking the pieces together. His shoulders are heavy and leaning forward. A small whisper escapes his lips. ‘A bit not good?’
These small moments of you being unaware of my soft gaze ground me when you're physically departed from the space I normally share with you.
You leave me breathless and yearning for more.
I drop the bags in arms, angrily stride over to Sherlock, and push my finger directly into his chest. My eyes are wide and full of contempt for his pompous face and sharp cheekbones. I ignore the way his lips pout and stare deep into his eyes. No changes in his face have been made, and it looks like we’ll be having that domestic he claims I started while at Tesco.
I whisper a soothing ‘Good morning’, lips meeting your youthful forehead.
My eyes, fully open now, glissade down your body. The sheet is draped lazily along your side, exposing favorites parts of you to me. Alabaster skin you’re apprehensive to present during the day, cloaked away underneath layers of unconscious distrust of the surroundings of the world; however equally ardent to reveal yourself solely to me in the radiant moonbeams of our hidden mainstay. I pull my hands away from your curls, more a mess than when I found them, gently skating your skin. Allowing the softness to slowly wake you from your sleep. Selfish of me, I know, rousing you when you’re peacefully displayed in front of me, but the desire to gaze longingly into your eyes when you’ve turned to face me overpowers your necessity to slumber. My heart races as I’ve predicted. Your sleepy eyes gaze longingly at me as if it were the first time you’ve laid your sights on me; similar to that of our first meeting back in that sterile room at Bart’s. Wrinkled nose accompanied by a tired half smile.
After adjusting my collar, I notice out the of the corner of my eye Sherlock’s hand is dangling just so almost brushing my  thigh. Odd he never does … oh! Immediately I remove my hand from my pocket and intertwine my fingers with his.
'You’re a damn tease, Sherlock Holmes.' I mutter wanting to pull his curls into my hands and push him where he knows he needs to focus and pay attention.
You give me that mischievous wink that you’ve spent weeks trying to perfect, secretly, in the mirror when you believe I’m not watching. I like this one you have gifted me. You must have deduced that this is my favorite since you’ve stuck with it for around a week now. You rarely make us a cuppa, and I greedily want to watch your long graceful body clamber out of bed.
'You listen here, Sherlock Holmes. You might be the world’s one and only consulting detective, but you’re a right arsed boyfriend.' I can feel the temperature in the flat rise, and breathing techniques be damned. I want to be angry. Heat rises and oh boy, is he in for it now. 'You forget dinner with me last Thursday over my publication. A work I’ve been finishing for months now. You know? The ones about your cases?! Or did you happen to just not care about that over the ‘categorization of color and composition of pen inks and inked writing found on a variety of documents’ or whatever such experiments you’ve been dawdling on about lately?'
'Oh bugger off you prat.' I go to lift my pants and trousers back up, but he stops me, pulling me down to sit by him. I lie my head on his chest as he strokes his hand through my hair. Kissing me softly atop my head, Sherlock mumbles ‘Are we okay? Am I not a shite boyfriend then?’
‘Nothing. Just thinking about how I don’t want to get out of bed to get us a cuppa this morning. I might get them ready and come back to bed since it is a bit chilly out this morning. Thank god the bedroom is close to the kitchen.’
His soft voice carries from the kitchen as I’m taking my shoes and socks off, tossing them in a heap on the floor to be dealt with later. I must not give in to his melodious voice. The tone is a bit more playful than normal, and I refuse to allow this method of skirting bad behavior to continue.  Coat off and barefoot, I stomp to the kitchen, pausing abruptly to see that our tea has been set on the table, fresh and warm toast with … blackberry jam.
'Dammit, Sherlock! I can do things by myself you know. It’s not like you’re coming to Tesco like we prearranged when we first got together.' I drop the basket to the floor, throwing my hands up with a temper I’ve not felt in ages. My eyebrows shoot up and my shoulders tense as a shiver runs up my spine. With each word my voice gets louder until I can feel the words vibrating off of the shelves around us. 'I’ve been reaching for this same type of jam for the last two months now all by myself. ‘Oh look at me! I’m Sherlock Holmes. All tall, dark, and handsome. I can grab the ritual spread from the tip top of the shelf without even breaking a sweat.’'
‘Just the way you like it, John Watson.’
The short journey to Tesco has been dull, and the atmosphere inside of the store is quite the same. I grab the shopping basket as I only need to grab a few things for the week, and look around for Sherlock. Dammit. Where has he gone off to now?! My chest swells with irritation as I scan the aisles for the tall man I somehow have decided to claim as my own. Why oh why did I decide to call him mine? I abandon my search for Sherlock and go about shopping. This is my normal routine as of late. Doing the shopping on my own. Being domestic. Good god Sherlock does nothing but irritate the shite out of me, eats all the food in the flat, and has the audacity to never thank me for making tea every single day. The hot air in my lungs, once trapped, is slowly escaping and I can feel it make its way up my neck and out through my nose. I feel like a Spanish bull eyeing the only target it has been trained to attack. I use a breathing technique my therapist has prescribed me. Seven counts in. Five counts out. Eight counts in. Release. There, I feel better already.
Always you.
Quite out of character, Sherlock, startled at the resonance in my voice, releases the glass jar from his slender fingers. Neither of us are able to reach for it in time before it hits the ground with a smash. He’s looking at me now. Eyebrows furrowed. Ahh not this time you don’t Sherlock Holmes. I will not let you deduce what is wrong with me right now. You didn't figure it out before we left the flat, you don’t get to know now.
‘You’re the epitome of domesticity, John. Let me try for once. Can't risk my doctor catching a cold because he seems to always forget his house slippers when getting out of bed to make a cuppa. Enjoy your moment in bed alone because when I get back, I would like to continue this lazy kissing with you. I’m growing quite fond of you, you know that?’
A group of younger men walk past, rowdy and loud, pushing each other as they huddle close like a pack. One of them says something and his words are met with a chorus of barked laughter. Sherlock can feel their eyes scanning them as they meet on the narrow path, like the eyes of young animals that don’t yet know how to categorize the world and want to pick and sniff and paw and growl at everything they come by in a useless, arrogant show of strength. He doesn’t mind them, but then John grows rigid, his back straightening, eyes burning two holes through space ahead, hands leaving his pockets to coil into fists at his side. His next step creates a gap between him and Sherlock, raising an impassable fence.
“Yeah, um, sorry...”
So Sherlock does.
“So…?”
“Mm...”
Their home. It brings back memories.
Sherlock’s stomach clenches, so much so that he almost loses the feeling of the ground beneath his feet. Whatever grimace appeared on his face has John shaking his head.
The scandal in December. Culverton. Sherlock watched all about that
Then he steps away to let them have their moment, stealing a glance when Honeybee giggles with a kiss on her cheek.
“From?”
Sherlock blinks slowly, his head tilting a little to the side before he speaks, as if John has his full attention. Like it used to be. But then Sherlock looks away again, as if he’s stopping himself from something, and the indifference returns.
him now. What would Sherlock do?
Harriet.
Woo, we made it! Sorry for being a little late.
“Me?”
No bubbles in the tub, no sign of any shampoo anywhere near Sherlock in fact. What could that mean? John’s mind is going frantic.
“Yes.” John hesitates for a moment, oscillating between his feet, flowers blooming in his mind until he finally touches Sherlock’s shoulder. He takes a deep breath, leaning over them both, leaving a kiss on Rosie’s little head. A worried Sherlock is looking at him, direct and expecting. John squeezes his fingers over impossibly jutting out bones. God, he needs to take better care of them both… “I am sure. Trust me. She’ll be alright.”
“Sherlock?”
When he closes his eyes, he finds himself in that in-between; not awake, and yet not asleep. He is drifting. His body is being rocked gently, as if he were floating on his back at sea. In his dream, his eyes fly open wide, and he flops to his belly with a clumsy splash. His skin is dry with brine, his lips salty. He knows where he is.
He walks in. Slowly. The door creaks. He watches as Sherlock’s fingers curl on the sheets. Otherwise he’s perfectly still. Poised, with a haughtily tipped-up chin, as always.
‘Shut up.’
‘Let me be.’
Sherlock stands up to give room for John to do the same, but John does not let go of his hand. His head is turned towards his daughter’s cot, and Sherlock follows his gaze to her sleeping form. Her cheeks are a bright, poppy red, her golden hair sweaty and matted at the nape of her neck. Her breathing is regular, but she has to sleep with her mouth open, her nose too blocked to let her properly rest.
“I’m afraid so, Mr. Holmes. Sherlock can no longer attend Radley.” Cornelia heard the sound of a chair scraping.
“Much better. Sectionals did you lot a world of good. Now, I’d like to run through with everyone from letter C before Lestrade comes down to observe. Maybe if you’re good, he won’t rewrite the damn arrangement. Again.”
“I have not the slightest-”
His eyes snapped open, and he stared, shocked, at John’s face hovering not far from his own. “…John?” He cleared his throat to ease its hoarseness.
For an instant, everything was still, as John stared at him with wide eyes and a slack mouth. Then he lurched forward with a groan, shoving Sherlock’s legs up as far as they could go so he could lean in to kiss him, deep and filthy. Moaning in return, Sherlock wrapped his arms over John’s shoulders, hands aching with relief to finally be able to touch.
John’s hand returned to his lower back, holding him firm. “Mmm, I love how eager you always are for it.” His other hand came down, almost as hard as when he’d stopped earlier, and Sherlock sighed around his moan. “My brilliant, beautiful cockslut.”
His captain’s voice. A loud part of Sherlock always quailed in the best way to have it directed at him. Swallowing thickly around his racing pulse, Sherlock did as he was bid with shaking hands. The overwhelming newness of having someone look at him like that, having
John’s swallow was audible, and his grip tightened for a moment. “Yeah? Need my cock, do you?”
“Bed?”
John’s mouth pulled away, and a moment later, it was replaced by his cock rubbing against him. Hands squeezed and moulded his buttocks around it so that it snugged up against his hole. Sherlock groaned and pushed back in a rolling motion, breathing hard. The tingling heat made every touch down there light up his spine. Cursing, John thrust against him a couple times before pausing. The snick of a cap being opened (John must have grabbed the lube at some point), and a moment later, John withdrew only to rub slick fingers against his entrance.
“All right then, Sherlock. You want to hide, I’ll let you hide.” The smooth, gentle lilt in John’s tone should have been reassuring, but was most certainly not. Hands pulled him sideways and into John’s lap. The position was such that John’s erection (now free of his pants) was trapped against his own, teasing but not offering any relief. “We’ll just have to find another way to keep you out of your head, won’t we?” Sherlock tensed with apprehension, not relaxing even when John smoothed a hand across his lower back and let it rest there.
John’s eyes fluttered, his breathing and thrusts losing their rhythm as he groaned. But instead of being provoked, John just chuckled. “Are you trying to say you want more, hm? Well you’re going to have to be more polite than that to get it. And specific. Using your words.” He raised his brows expectantly, eyes bright with mirth.
It seemed to go on for ages, fading slowly, until he was left a trembling, wrung out mess of nerve endings. If it wasn’t for John holding his hips up, he would have collapsed completely. John gave him only brief respite, though, before starting up his thrusts again, slow and gentle. They made Sherlock’s aftershocks more intense, and he clenched around John to chase them, the only muscle movement he had the strength for.
As Sherlock slowly remembered how thinking worked, he stared at the ceiling through slitted eyes. Which he realized he’d been doing for quite a while, without really seeing it. He’d been too lost swimming in the warm, buzzing haze, which had only receded a little.
. He needed it in him, or he’d surely die.
Thankfully, Sherlock didn’t have to stay flustered and blushing for long, because John resumed their kissing with more passion than before, though no less sweetness.
Distantly, he was aware that John was putting most of his strength into each smack, with how he used his whole body in the motion. And yes, it hurt now, really hurt, but it was still the good kind, still made his cock twitch and ache.
John’s hand switched to massaging each cheek in turn, giving him a break yet aggravating the hot, pulsing sting that had become a constant. “Not this time, though. I don’t think I have the patience to hold off from fucking you long enough for that. God, your arse is going to look so pretty wrapped around my cock like this.”
“Sherlock.” John accompanied the chastisement with gripping Sherlock by the chin.
One final blow that shook Sherlock’s frame, and the hand stayed, rubbing the stinging ache while John caught his breath.
to give a talk, since clearly John was a better doctor than any of the simpering, arrogant imbeciles that would be attending.
John hummed and pressed a wet kiss to a vertebra. “There you are. I knew you could do it. Such a good boy.”
“The American President, Sherlock. My dear brother, despite your lack of international awareness, you have the second-cleverest mind in all of Britain, and you will put it to good use. I won’t have you faffing about in a concert hall.”
“Sherlock!” Lestrade looked scandalized.
“Well, James, maybe it’s about time she comes home. John’s never- well, he’s asked, but-John’s never gone off to some American boarding school or… or enrolled… well, you know, he’s always worked for what he’s got. Maybe it’s time we-err- you know, we spend all this money on Harriet and we assume that John- that he’s okay with it, but…”
“Oh, yes there is. Music comes from in here. In here!”
“You’re a sweet girl, Harriet.”
“Yeah, go ahead, I’m sorry for interrupting. Ah, bollocks, I’ve done it again. Talk, John.”
“Then what do you want me to be, Mycroft? Everything seems to be about what you want!”
“Yeah. Look, dad, Sholto’s - he’s essentially offering us charity, isn’t he? An expenses-paid spot in the Guildhall program? Doesn’t that make you feel- you know?”
“Why? What did I do?” The trench coat- ‘Sherlock,’ as Lestrade was calling him- seemed generally perplexed.
“You’re the second person to say that to me today,” said Lestrade. John looked at him, intrigued.
The latch clicked again, and James Watson walked in the front door.
Sebastian and Giles dragged Sherlock, who was kicking and crying, inside, where the Pastoral Housemistress, immediately dropping her cuppa, raced to phone campus security.
Sherlock tore into the parcel, revealing an elegant wooden case. Fumbling to undo the latches, Sherlock popped open the lid, hinges creaking as he swung it back.
“Like your work is of consequence, blackmailing the American Prime Minister?”
“So you speak for the world, now?”
“Really? If I’d suffered through a DMA Musicology program, I’d make my own mum call me Dr. Lestrade.” John snorted.
“Sherlock! You-you are crossing a line from which-”
Sherlock sat in the C Social garden, wrapped snugly in a white trench coat, plucking idly at his violin’s strings. Boys lobbed snowballs at each other as they raced around the snowy courtyard. After Warden Humphrey had declared the day an official snow day, the residents of C Social had been shooed out of the dorms by the Pastoral Housemistress to take their minds off looming Lent Term exams.
“The Army is out of the question, John. Out of the question. No son of mine is going to be gunning down naked little girls or planting bombs under the cars of suspected IRA members- no. It goes against everything we’ve ever taught you.”
“They have you reading the classics! Not so dodgy after all, perhaps?”
Mycroft stood on tiptoes, groping for the frosting tub. His eyes were glued to the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which was a simply fascinating document- not dull in the slightest.
“I love my violin. I love music.”
“Now look what you’ve done, John! On Christmas, no less!”
There was a note attached, tied smartly around the violin’s scroll. ‘A rent boy,’ it read, in small, loopy writing. Sherlock looked blankly at the card before it hit him.
“No, I’m right, am I not? You. Don’t want me. Learning to do something. That you. Can’t.”
The trench coat rattled off a rapid barrage of words. “You’re the cock-up. It’s usually one of the musicians that speeds up, all the players around them speed up to compensate, it ripples out. But no. Not here. They all follow you, and you speed up through the bit you don’t like to get to the bit you do. Sentimentality. It’s the making of a composer, and the absolute death of a conductor.”
“NO!” Sherlock looked utterly crestfallen, completely gutted. The violin’s bridge had snapped, rendering the metal strings loose. One had popped off completely. The wooden body of the violin was cracked, splinters of wood now littering the ground. Sherlock looked like he had just woken up in hell.
“Yes.” Sebastian smiled a bit. This was shaping up to be one of his longer conversations with Sherlock Holmes.
“Oh Sherlock, what’s the point?”
“I’m not going back to another boys’ public school, Mycroft!”
The door clicked open, and Harriet staggered inside, supporting John. There was blood dripping all down his front.
“John, I don’t know how I can make this much clearer to you: if you join the Army, I will be irreconcilably angry. I won’t go so far as to say you wouldn’t be my son, but… our convictions define us.”
Sherlock crossed his arms impetuously. “Oh, so you can read her mind now?”
Lestrade gulped. “He’s a genius, John. He’s a great man.” Something clicked. Their conversation from yesterday.
“Julian broke my violin,” he whispered back, the wunderkind sixteen year old rendered a hapless child once more.
“Oh.”
In which several biblical allusions are made.
John was nearly 15. Christine Watson never forgot a Watson child’s birthday, as she felt she’d put quite a lot of effort into the birth part of the birthday.
“I don’t-”
Several chaps in the woodwind sectional chuckled, the rather flirtatious pianist giggling a little too hard. John grinned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Christine, I’d like a word with John.”
Lestrade popped out as soon as John ended the piece with a flourish, clapping. Many of the musicians, a bit star-struck, started whispering eagerly to one another. The rather flirtatious pianist unconsciously touched her chest, causing John to cringe and Lestrade, who never missed a beat, to wink at the unsuspecting girl.
“You’re welcome,” said Mycroft.
“Mycroft is the name you gave me, please use it!” Mycroft shook his head. Weak. Childish. The jibe sounded wrong as it came out. Barely snappish, let alone cutting. He’d amend the saying, dial up the scathing.
“Ah, well, you didn’t need a DMA program to hone your talents, my friend.”
“Sebastian.” Sherlock seemed interested in Sebastian all of a sudden, turning towards him.
“Johann Sebastian Bach? Quite astute. I assume you recognized the styling? I transposed the Menuet from the Anna Magdalena manuscript. Good on you, most people can’t follow a conversation and a song all at once.”
“Oh my god!” screamed Christine.
“I know, darling,” she said, pulling him to his feet. “Let’s get your things.” As they left the administrative building, Cornelia pushed open the door, a cold gust of wind tossing both their curls into disarray. She tucked Sherlock into his white trench coat, noticing yesterday’s bloodstains still damp on his sleeves.
“In London. Most of my friends live in California now.” Lestrade scratched the back of his head.
“Sherlock!”
“Menuet.”
“We’re poor. This is what we do.”
In a quasi-desperate bid for more public support, the BBCSO had offered Lestrade a residency, paying him to compose his own classical symphony at Maida Vale. Their little ploy had worked. Ticket sales for next season were up 27%, if the marketing prats were to be believed, which, on second thought, John supposed they weren’t, since they’d be fired if they said otherwise.
John wiggled his fingers, bringing out the brass section a bit. Lestrade sat below John’s podium, reclined, rubbing a hand thoughtfully across his stubble as the orchestra launched into another section of the symphony. Phillip Anderson, the Hollywood music critic Lestrade had brought in, took notes on a clipboard as he listened to the symphony.
“What the hell, Christine? You left the door unlocked? Harriet, what are you doing home-” James, having strode into the living room, saw John asleep on the couch, face puffy and bruised. “Another fight?” whispered James, dropping his bag.
A property deed for Mycroft- a pleasant Manchester home, to do with as he pleased. There were perks to marrying a man of status.
Sherlock sighed melodramatically, maintaining his pace.
“Okay. All right.”
“Come on, Sherlock,” she whispered, reaching down. He stared up at her, clear hurt in his eyes.
“Oh god, Julian-” began Sebastian, frowning. It was too late.
“You’re good and happy!” called Mrs. Hudson from halfway up the stairs. Sherlock stopped playing, turning to grin at her.
“I need you, Sherlock. God help me.” Lestrade looked down, stuffing his hands in his pockets.
The bickering had gone on for days now, ever since Mike’s return from uni. Miriam and Rochester ardently ignored it, cheerily proceeding with present distribution. The Holmes family sat on the carpet around the heavily ornamented tree, a fire slowly waning in the grate behind them. Sherlock had hung a few bones from some of the upper branches, courtesy of his latest growth spurt and a fascination with dissections. Mycroft had purchased a delicate Union Jack ornament, which hung just below the cloth angel topping the tree.
Sherlock’s sprawl on the couch slumped and tightened until he was curled in a loose, pouting ball on his side. With malaised fingers, he reached out, straining, for his phone where it lay mostly on the coffee table, but was foiled by a few centimetres distance. He let his arm drop heavily over the edge of the couch with a grunt and glared in betrayal at his quarry. The one-sided staring contest went on longer than it probably should have before Sherlock squirmed forward, arm outstretched once more, until he could scrabble at the jutting corner of the phone. It teetered up, slipped further into his grasp, and —
“That’s it, Sherlock. So, so good for me. This is exactly what you needed, isn’t it, sweetheart?” The next his was the hardest yet, and Sherlock gasped and moaned John’s name. “Fuck you’re gorgeous. And the sounds you make.” Another hard hit, another cry, with John thrusting up against him. “I wonder if I could make you come like this. Just from spanking your perfect arse. I bet I could.”
Mouth trembling with nerves, he nodded. “Yes…”
His quick compliance earned him that third finger, and he reveled in the burn of it, how it complemented the quiet burn in his arsecheeks. Thankfully, John didn’t seem to have very much more patience than Sherlock, because he focused solely on getting him stretched enough for his cock, not even bothering to go for his prostate. Which suited Sherlock just fine. He might have spilled if he had.
Yet here he was, his low cries halfway to moans and his cock dripping into John’s lap, onto John’s cock. He had to turn his head to the side to gasp for air, no longer cognizant enough to care about embarrassment.
Sherlock keened and shook through the onslaught, and continued to do so to a lesser extent when John slowed. The brief harshness had made him even more sensitive. His cock leaked another short stream of pre-cum into the growing puddle on his stomach. Having a taste of a pace that could easily make him cum made the current one feel close to torture. His desperation made him even more whiny and petulant.
“What is it, love? You want that, hm? Want me to fuck you?”
Little shocks ran up Sherlock’s spine with each movement, toeing the line between pain and pleasure. But it was more this sudden change of pace that had him shaking and whimpering. This wasn’t just John fucking him, but
Biting his lip, Sherlock arched up into him and did his best to move with John’s guidance. And when John pressed their mouths together, he licked against John’s tongue. This, this was what he’d been craving. John
But John simply got a tight hold on his waist and braced him more firmly against his stomach. “Ah ah, you wanted to be disobedient and hide from me. So you’re going to accept the consequences.” His other hand caressed the stinging cheek.
John cursed and sped his thrusts, which lost their steady rhythm but none of their force. “Oh fuck, Sherlock…” Groaning, he bit into the meat of Sherlock’s shoulder, his cock beginning to pulse, and —
With graceful, controlled movements, John pulled him a little closer and, for just a handful of thrusts, pounded fast (but not frantic) right against his prostate before slowing to a luxurious roll of his hips that bounced him in his lap.
To hide the obvious heat in his cheeks, Sherlock leaned up for another kiss. “Good,” he murmured into it. “Baker street is dreadful without you. I was completely unproductive, utterly useless. For the sake of London’s crime rates, you really should stay home as often as possible. Or simply take me with you next time.”
. Nothing else had ever felt so exquisite, setting off a constant stream of a thousand sparks in his brain. Not the drugs, not solving a near-impossible murder. Nothing.
“I hated being left behind far more.”
Sherlock’s quiet whine turned mournful when John pulled out, leaving him clenching around an awful nothing. But before he could remember the words to protest, John rolled him over, hooked his arms under Sherlock’s knees, and pushed back in. Sherlock didn’t even try to muffle his guttural moan of relief, the thrill of being filled again almost as good as the first time.
And it was such a casual thing to say, something John had said plenty of times in their day-to-day lives. It breathed sharpness into this moment, reminding him with crystal clarity that yes, this really was John,
Thinking about it now marked yet another inflection point between anger and depression.
And now John wasn’t even
The command was all it took, because what else was Sherlock to do but obey? With a loud wail, he clamped down on John’s cock hard enough to limit his movement, and shot his cum all over the bed and his own stomach. Through the pulsing waves of euphoria, he was distantly aware of John murmuring to him and massaging his backside while he did his best to fuck him through it.
This time, when Sherlock opened his mouth, the words were waiting for him, though he still stumbled and stammered with nerves. “Please, John. Please f-fuck me harder. I…I want to cum on your cock again.” He even made an attempt at looking up from under his lashes. Let no one say that Sherlock ever did anything halfway.
With something like a growl, Sherlock glared at him and purposefully squeezed his cock,
“Hi there.” Grinning, John ground his hips forward.
John grinned, still stroking his hair. “Hey there. I decided to skip the last bit today and come home early.”
More pre-cum dribbled down Sherlock’s cock as he whined, as much from John’s words as his ministrations. He had no doubt John could do exactly as he claimed, and the thought of it made him shake.
The hand moving to grip Sherlock’s arse was a favourable answer indeed, almost as much as the way John’s mouth strangled around Sherlock’s name.
Two days, ten hours, and twenty-five…twenty six minutes. Almost three days, really, that Sherlock had been forced to endure an empty flat. All because a group of dithering idiots who thought themselves close to science had decided to host a medical “conference” in order to show off their “expertise” and spoon feed new material to doctors who should already be up to speed on advancements. John certainly was, always borrowing the latest journals from the clinic to study. They should be getting
Heart pounding in his ears, Sherlock rallied his courage (aided, he was sure, by all the feel-good hormones still coursing through his system), and raised his eyes to look into John’s. John was simply gazing at him, heavy-lidded and patient, still rocking his hips at a lazy pace, and now he smiled with reassurance.
“That was beautiful, Sherlock.” He continued rolling his hips, and the new position had his cock brushing against Sherlock’s oversensitive prostate, making him flinch and whimper. “Shhh, just relax. I’d like to try making you cum again. Would that be all right?”
“Are you close, sweetheart? Gonna cum again for me? God I’m close, too. You’re so…” Apparently John couldn’t find the right words, because he set to sucking the sweat from Sherlock’s collarbones instead of saying what Sherlock was. Or maybe his actions were a sort of answer.
The control from earlier had all but disappeared from John’s voice, and it came out uneven and breathy. “Such a greedy thing.”
John slid his hand from Sherlock’s hip to beneath his lower back, pulling him tighter against him with a deliciously strong forearm. Trapping Sherlock’s weeping cock between them.
him with his whole body. He couldn’t hide or look away. Couldn’t come up with any way to doubt John’s affections. He felt…safe. Truly safe. It still overwhelmed him every time John did something to engender that feeling, making him want to flee and yet never leave in equal measure.
Sherlock jerked back enough to glare at him, appalled. “You wouldn’t
Sherlock whined, squirming in John’s grip. As much as he enjoyed the praise, John was taking entirely too long to get to the fucking he’d been promised.
John laughed, hand sinking into Sherlock’s curls, and shook his head. “Of course not. Definitely not worth it.” Eyes crinkled and bright, he cupped Sherlock’s face in his other hand. “I missed you far too much. Why do you think I cut it short? I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping alone for another night.”
Frantic, he tugged at John’s hair, scratched at his back. “More, John… Nnnngh! Please please
Now that the haze from earlier had somewhat receded, the endearment had him flushing just as it usually did, his chest going warm. He bit his lip and nodded, the desire to be good settling back over him.
He slid his hands along Sherlock’s arms until he could twine their fingers together, pressing their hands into the mattress. Gentle restraints. His thrusts took on more purpose, but remained much the same: slow, easy undulations. One knee pressed against the back of Sherlock’s, bending it further up against his side for better access. He peppered all the skin he could reach with affectionate kisses.
The words were
“Hi there. Welcome back.”
No sooner had the words left his mouth than Sherlock seized hold of John’s shirt and
, so Sherlock was left stuck in a miserable, lonely ball on the couch, antsy and bored but unable to do anything but give in to the whiplash current of his thoughts, which revolved almost entirely around John. What was he doing, thinking? Was he having fun at that dreadful conference or was he bored? Did he miss Sherlock like he’d said in his last message, or was he just going through the expected motions? It wouldn’t be unreasonable of him to not miss Sherlock terribly yet; only a couple days had passed after all. The vicious ache in Sherlock’s chest as he pined was the anomaly here. He cursed his sentimentality yet again for crippling him as it had. Going most of his life without must have left him utterly unprepared for the intensity of loving someone as fiercely as he did John.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” he said between thrusts that rocked the bed and had Sherlock crying out with each one. “That was the hottest thing I’ve ever heard said.”
The string snapped, released, and Sherlock
The smugness coming off of John was palpable. This time Sherlock was quite able to roll his eyes, though he supposed John had a right to it. Just a little. He smiled against John’s chest.
Even so, Sherlock squirmed and struggled to get away, embarrassed and a little frightened of such a new experience. Namely, how it would affect him. What if he humiliated himself?
Sod the phone. It’s not as though there were any new messages for him. The last had been from John over three hours ago, checking in and reminding him to eat if he hadn’t already (hadn’t but did).
Needless to say, John had noticed his reactions and had now apparently decided to put his knowledge to good use.
Squirming and pushing back against John’s hand, Sherlock nodded. “Please… Need you…”
Eyes widening, Sherlock dug his fingers into John’s back. “Oh oh oh… John
Sherlock looked away, blushing with embarrassment.
John let the silence grow thick and uncomfortable, making Sherlock squirm, before finally sitting up. Sherlock pouted harder, missing John’s weight.
John’s weight settled on top of him, his hands running up and down Sherlock’s sides. It had Sherlock lying flat on the wet spot he’d made, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. John rested his face against the base of Sherlock’s neck, breathing hard.
“Oof!”
.” He tried not to whine as he spoke, but there was nothing for it. This was the only way so far he’d been able to ask for what he wanted. ‘Please fuck me’ always got stuck in his throat.
. John was home.
They’d only been romantically involved for a little over two months now, sexually so less than one. Enough time for novelty to wear off, and if there was nothing else underneath it… Anxiety sank its claws into familiar grooves in his mind.
A seeming eternity later, John withdrew his fingers and laid a parting smack on his arse. The sound of the lube being used again, this time on John’s cock. Breath speeding up, Sherlock wriggled in place, whispering “yes” over and over.
.” He was fully prepared to switch to the cold shoulder if it would discourage such a habit.
John’s smile widened to a grin. “I think the whole street heard that. My ears are still ringing a bit.”
“Fuck you feel so good. Better than…ungh, anything.
A huff of soft laughter brushed his cheek before lips did the same. “Sherlock. Wake up, love.”
“Having trouble there?”
They’d exchanged those words before, even if it had taken several weeks before Sherlock could say it back. But this was the first time he’d said it unprompted.
Though he nodded, letting his arm fall to the side, he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes.
(It had not taken John long to learn how very much Sherlock liked being manhandled.)
. And on top of that, John had been right. It kept him firmly in the moment, in his body, and quieted the swarming noise in his head nearly as well as being fucked by John’s cock. But still, it shocked him, because he’d never thought himself a masochist. In fact, he rather disliked experiencing pain anywhere else.
“You don’t have a heart, Mycroft! You never will.”
“I just want you to know, mum. That. Well. I do love you. So much. I love John, and dad. I don’t say it enough. None of us do.”
“Lestrade, I swear I mean no disrespect-”
“Join up with the fascists, John? No son of mine would ever sink that low.”
Feet thumped up the stairs. A male, obviously, gauged by the weight distribution and gait. Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on his bow as he executed a rapid bariolage, bow flying from string to string. He stopped abruptly as the feet reached the landing. He listened intently for a split-second. Leather soles, based on the click against the hardwood. Status symbol. Wealthy, but not too dignified. He had taken the stairs two at a time. Sherlock had listened to Mycroft creep around the Holmes manor enough to know that elitists took small, precise steps. Sherlock supposed they were trying not to miss a rung on the social ladder. Sherlock resumed playing, now stroking out a slow funeral dirge, knowing exactly who stood behind him without turning around.
“Sorry, Champagne?” asked Lestrade.
Sherlock had come to Radley in Remove Year, or Year 10, which was unusual. If rumors were to be believed (which they likely were, as Giles Jencomb had a grandfather on the board at St. Paul’s), Sherlock had been expelled from his old school for poisoning a star athlete. Nothing lethal, according to Giles, but something that left him bedridden for days. Sebastian reckoned the St. Paul’s boys had given Sherlock a rather hard time.
“Well.” The Warden cleared his throat obnoxiously. “Julian Gillespie, age 15, went into surgery last night after your brother assaulted him. Sherlock broke his nose so severely that he needed immediate reconstructive surgery.”
“A bit,” replied Christine lightly.
“What’s his name?” whispered Mycroft, brushing his brother’s porcelain cheek with a grubby thumb. Mummy placed a kiss on the top of Mycroft’s head. Mycroft had simultaneous urges to smile down at the infant and throw it off the upstairs balcony.
“Not you! Not you!”
Frustrated with his inability to form a snappish reply, Sherlock stared up at the display case in a violent silence.
“Oh god,” scoffed Anderson. “Freakier than I remember.”
The violin was perfect. In the biblical sense. The soft light of the display case illuminated its brindled flesh, the arch of its neck casting an eerie shadow on the velvet cloth it rested upon. Its strings seemed to quaver, vibrations from passing cars sending miniscule tremors up its length, up from its waist into its strings and scroll. It was heaven.
“STOP!” yelled the black trench coat. “STOP PLAYING, NOW!” John didn’t know how to react. He had never had a rehearsal so brazenly interrupted, let alone mid-performance. Some of the musicians kept playing. Many tentatively slowed down, a few stopping altogether. Sighing, John signaled that the orchestra should stop. Silence quickly filled a space previously filled with sound.
“I’m the smart one, Sherlock.”
“Mum, I’d love to pursue medicine, but I can’t be a doctor unless it’s with the Army. We’d never be able to afford medical school.”
“Harriet?”
Greg Lestrade had gained international fame after nabbing a few Academy Awards for Best Musical Score. John figured that, as a Principal Conductor at an acclaimed symphony, he had ‘made it’ in the industry. Someone like Lestrade, whose face was plastered on tabloids and GQ covers and billboards, made ‘making it’ seem like a great spectrum on which Lestrade and John occupied madly different spots.
Miriam learned to be careful what she wished for.
Rochester’s father had been the Viscount Holmes of so-and-so, posh accent and peculiar phraseology to boot. As a woman of science, Miriam had keen powers of observation and recollection, a skill which extended to examining her in-laws. Miriam clearly remembered that the Viscount was unable to look her in the eye, a slight Rochester hastily assured wasn’t due to her Jewish heritage.
“Oh dear,” said Mycroft, overwhelmed. It was heavy, but a good sort of heavy, like the end of ‘1984.’
The black trench coat skulked down the center aisle, glancing left then right, left then right. John saw glimpses of fair skin, an angular nose peeking out from a turned-up collar.
A goldfish for Mycroft, and a broadsword for Sherlock.
Miriam and Rochester Holmes insisted on few rules when it came to their boys, their boys being so extraordinary. No skipping years, no matter how dull the other boys were. No pouring acid down an anthill, no matter how hard the little bugs would writhe. No talking about torture at the table.  And Christmas.
Lestrade was clearly struggling with the composition itself. He’d rather drastically revised the piece many times over after various workshops and trials, never quite satisfied with how it sounded.
“Merry Christmas.”
“Your reaction gave it away, but let’s walk through the rest, just for fun. You parked in the driveway last night when there was space in the garage. Thought it was odd, given the snow. It snowed before dinner and again in the morning covering any tracks, but when I got in the car an hour or so ago, I noticed the volume of snow on the windshield didn’t match the volume on the ground. So you got in last night and drove off, clearing away the snow with the wipers, trying to make as little noise as possible, doing something you clearly were paranoid about me discovering, something private, which I hypothesized to be sex, a hypothesis which was confirmed by your reaction. No girlfriend at uni, secret sex, a call-girl. Thank you, Mycroft, for this delightful excursion, and properly bugger off.”
John cleared his throat. “You’ve already had the BBC’s best people in, Lestrade. And Professor Hooper from Guildhall gave you her notes, didn’t she?”
Tickets to ‘Hamlet’ at the Barbican for Mycroft, a velvet eye-patch and taxidermy parrot for Sherlock (“Arrrrr, matey! Mycroft, if I were the Captain, I’d have you walk the plank!”)
“Oh, bollocks, Sher- John, I’m so sorry. Please don’t go!”
“We finally got him a proper one, too,” said James, making his usual unsuccessful attempt to lighten the mood. He cleared his throat. “How can I help?”
“Sentiment,” continued the trench coat. “It’s rather obvious you fancy the flautist. You were rushing to get to her solo bit, then rushed after she was done. I wouldn’t bother, she just broke up with her boyfriend of two, maybe three years, a museum employee, she pretends she’s over him but she isn’t. You’d be a rebound.” John’s fist curled into a ball, his lips pressing tightly together.
For a second, Mycroft could have sworn the corner of his brother’s mouth twitched ever-so-slightly, as if the infant was smirking up at him.
“Befriending the nutter, Seb?” Sebastian frowned.
“I’m sorry that I- well. You know. I make it all about me, don’t I?” Harriet bit her lip, staring at John.
Christine nodded numbly, running a finger along John’s swollen jaw. She was moved.
Sherlock waited til Lestrade had thumped back down the stairs before commencing an animated performance of ‘Ode to Joy.’
“No, no. You should go upstairs. Maybe you can call Harriet, she’s probably sitting down for dinner about now. “
Flashback sequence is over.... for now! Let’s take a peek into the present day, shall we?
- G.Lestrade
“Are you out of your mind?” she asked loudly. Harriet’s eyes welled up with tears. Christine softened her tone. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for yelling. I just… you would’ve gotten hurt, and that wouldn’t have done anyone any good.”
“No,” said John, grinning. “Who was the first?”
Sherlock wordlessly tucked himself under her arm, sobbing quietly into her neck.
“Right,” said John, firmer than he intended. “Sorry, what?”
“He had a shoe buffer on his desk. His shoes were freshly shined, yours hadn’t been for days. He never offers it to you, even as a courtesy. He can’t stand you. Anyway, no friends at uni, so certainly no girlfriend. And yet you’ve had sex.”
Lestrade adopted a conspiratorial tone. “It still sounds a bit…. Heavy, wouldn’t you say?”
The cab screeched a violent B# as it pulled up to the white arch of Maida Vale. Sherlock quickly paid the cabbie, turning up his coat collar as he hopped out. His phone buzzed.
Sherlock stroked the violin with his fingertip, ears turning scarlet. He plucked at the ‘A’ string, involuntarily gasping as it twanged under his touch. He put his finger to the vibrating string, letting the movements shake his finger in turn. Illuminated by the colorful lights of the tree, the violin looked like wildflowers, or a rainbow, or the aurora borealis.
“John. I’m not going to rat on you or anything if you tell it like it is. To tell you the truth, you’re one of my only friends here.”
“Poof!” hissed Julian, causing Brian to double over in amusement. Sebastian glanced at Sherlock, who stiffened, momentarily stopping his music. He resumed. Snow crunched underfoot as Giles approached the bench from behind, leaning over Sebastian’s shoulder.
School was dull. Most Year 2 boys were learning about Ancient Greece. Mummy insisted he go to school to learn to play with other boys, though permitted the (dull) material to be supplemented with the tutelage of Dr. Applebaugh. Who was also quite dull. He wanted Mycroft to learn about the discovery of the Americas by Europeans. Dull. Mycroft supplemented the supplementary work with a study of the French Revolution. Gorey. Class warfare. Not dull.
“Oh. Right. Well-”
“You’d like us to chuck you in with the females, then? Would you know what to do with one?”
Miriam decided against telling Rochester of her suspicions. Rochester loved their boys, Miriam had no doubt, but seemed determined to sand down their “rough edges,” as he euphemistically put it.
“Bugger off, Mycroft. Find yourself another escort.” Sherlocked lathered his last word in contempt.
“I am your ghostwriter.” Lestrade sighed, running a hand through his hair. Sherlock played a particularly solemn note, reflective of Lestrade’s nebulous feelings.
Sebastian peered over at Sherlock, shading his eyes from the sun, which glinted painfully off the sparkling ice.
If physical bullying is upsetting to you, feel free to just skip this chapter.
“Deduction is a science, Mycroft. Anyone can learn it.”
“Can’t we have different convictions and still get along?”
“And he said that playing the clarinet looked like… you know. And I could tell John wanted to hit him but I held onto his arm, you know, reminded him I was there.”
“What’s wrong this time? We both know you’re trying to wean yourself off my services as your ghostwriter. You wouldn’t have come to me if it wasn’t something awful.” Sherlock’s voice was lathered with contempt.
“John, it’s out of the question. Your mother is upset enough about Harriet faffing off with her host family in Massachusetts without-”
Sherlock looked up. “There’s always something,” he said, lip twitching.
“Who. The hell. Are you?” asked John, doing his best to sound cordial. He was livid. The man didn’t reply, methodically looking over the contents of the orchestra.
“You.” John looked up, to see the man striding straight towards him. “The conductor. Interesting. It’s never the conductor.”
“Let’s play deductions. You’re about to tell me you’re applying to a music program.”
She always hoped her boys would grow up fighters, too.
Sherlock was creepy. His Year 10 roommate, Ewan Barnaby, would amass a small crowd outside the chapel telling horror stories about Sherlock. They were heavily embellished, or, at least, Sebastian hoped they were. Sherlock allegedly hung a skull from the ceiling over Ewan’s bed, like a mobile. He kept his cut fingernails in a jar of hydrochloric acid. He played the violin loudly whenever Ewan asked him a question he didn’t fancy. Sebastian could believe that one. He’d heard Sherlock play. He was rather brilliant at it.
“Oh, Jesus,” whispered Christine.
“Yes. It’s just the mother, a wealthy widower. He’s her only child. They’re quite close.” Cornelia nodded behind the door. She’d met Mrs. Gillespie, who was confined to a wheelchair. It was quite sweet seeing Julian, normally brash and combative, be so sweet to her. Quite close, indeed.
“Oh Sherlock, I think you’ve gone a bit foggy! I’m Martha, and Christmas was last month. Not that you celebrated, mind.” Still nursing a smile, he neatly cleaned the rosin off his strings, efficiently locking his violin in its case. Mrs. Hudson kept talking, unperturbed by her tenant’s habitual silence. “He’s rather dashing, isn’t he? Oooh, isn’t it exciting, having a Oscar winner here, in Baker Street? Sherlock, you should introduce us!”
“Shooting ranges,” answered Sherlock. John opened his mouth, amazed. Sherlock was right- he had every intention of going to shoot. At Alpha Guns, too. John was preparing to turn around, when he thought the better of it and left Studio MV1 without so much as a glance back at the man in the trench coat.
“He knows. Sholto feels- well, I got the short end of the stick, didn’t I? I didn’t make it, professionally. It’s how it goes, I suppose, in the music industry. But he made it. His boys went to Eton.”
“Alpha Guns or Champagne,” answered Sherlock. John stopped in his tracks.
“Mm. It’s odd. In the alumni publication, they highlight all these people from my class who are doing great things. The actors, of course. Then the other musicians- singing backup for Janet Jackson. A couple at the LSO, quite a few teaching at Guildhall, the Royal Academy, Leeds, one man composing for Monty Python, of all people. Yeah. Geoffrey Burgon, I think his name is? And Sholto, of course, he’s developing these grand oratorios, and been made chairman of the Guildhall board. Came a long way from our dodgy London school.”
The first was instant affection. Mycroft found depictions of cherubs rather sickly and unbecoming, but now he understood their magnetizing quality. The infant bore plump, soft cheeks, a bit flushed from the laborious act of being born. Its eyelids fluttered, eyelashes thinner than butterfly legs. Mycroft would know, his parents had bought him a mounted set of opulently-tinted butterflies for Christmas, proudly displayed above his bed. This infant....Mycroft was proud to be its brother, shifting so that his father could gently move the thing into his arms.
“They threw his clarinet down the storm drain, James,” whispered Christine, exchanging a glance with Harriet- a silent agreement not to mention the homosexual bit.
“Believe it or not, Mycroft, I actually have managed to learn something from my ‘little tussle.’ Real chuffed with that euphemism, were you?”
“Thank you!”
“She proposed the measure. At Radley, we disincentivize such drastic maneuvers.... well, you work in public relations yourself, don’t you, Mr. Holmes? You understand the value of public opinion.” Cornelia smiled at ‘public relations.’ Based on a few conversations she’d overheard between the Holmes brothers, she greatly doubted that Mycroft Holmes was in marketing, or anything of that ilk.
Mycroft Holmes despised all things dull.
“I’d be happy to help you.”
Patience.
Lestrade sat up, adjusting his jacket. “That’s enough, Anderson. As for you, Sherlock, I want you to apologize to Dr. Watson right now.”
“You said… I’d like him.”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes. Your father’s substantial donations to the Silk Fund are greatly appreciated, but-”
“Maida Vale. Will you come?” Lestrade was slightly out of breath.
“Jokes aside, you shan’t become a pirate either.”
“Mikey!” It was his mummy this time, voice breathless from carrying a bassinet containing what could only be-
“Careful, Sherlock!” said Miriam automatically, before catching the look in Sherlock’s eyes. It was of heaven.
Harriet’s voice quavered as she spoke with an uncharacteristic insecurity. “John picked me up like usual, to walk me to lessons.” She hugged a pillow tightly. “This boy, Will, he’s in, err… John’s year, I think, maybe one up. He just… came up to us and called John these… these horrible things. He was calling him a homosexual.”
“Yes!”
Are you sure, Sherlock?
“A bit not good, yeah,” said John lightly, feeling the flats of his fingers pressing into his palms.
“Who was the first?”
John murmured incoherently as Christine and Harriet tugged off his bloody shirt and trousers and lay John on the couch, wrapping ice cubes in washcloths and pressing them to his face. He shivered violently. They pulled a blanket over him, into which he curled up and fell asleep. Christine and Harriet sat next to him in silence. Harriet’s eyes were swollen with tears, John’s nearly swollen shut.
Sherlock???
Mycroft let a delighted, boyish smile escape his lips. “Hello, William. Welcome home.” He paused, softening his voice to a nearly imperceptible volume as he lowered his mouth to his brother’s ear. “You’re lucky, William. They named me Mycroft. Ridiculous name. The boys at school tease me horribly. I hope, for your sake, we don’t end up calling you Sherlock.”
“Sorry,” said John. “Who is this?”
“No, Sherlock, I meant my name is Sebastian. You called me Ewan.” Sherlock sharply returned his attention to the violin, increasing the pace of his pizzicato.
“You won’t have it? My music is personal, it belongs to me. It’s the only thing that ever has!”
Lestrade was walking backwards towards the door, returning John’s smile. “Tommorrow. You’ll like him, John. He’s a great man. And one day, if we’re very, very, lucky, he might be a good one.”
“How do you manage that, then?”
Having successfully located the frosting tub, Mycroft settled in his father’s armchair, scooping gobs of frosting into his mouth with a finger. Mycroft supposed that he was an aristocrat, by French standards. He looked around at the fine china surrounding him. Definitely an aristocrat. Better than the French ones, though. He’d be far too clever to get his head lopped off. Mycroft thought Marie Antoinette suffered not from aristocratic bloodlines, but from a dearth of ingenuity.
Sherlock easily hailed a cab and set off for Maida Vale, gazing out the window with his legs tucked up and his thumb twiddling on his bottom lip. He cracked open the window just a tad. He liked to listen to the sounds of the city, to imagine the beeps and shouts and clatters ordered in neat notes on paper. In one eye Sherlock watched the city, in another he composed another London aria.
“All right, strings, let’s take it from... 51?”
“The world is in dire need of your ministration.”
This infant would be his arch-enemy.
“Men like the older women these days, you know. You should see what I found on Google-” Sherlock slipped his black trench coat on seamlessly, roughly tossing his blue scarf around his neck before tucking it into his coat. He swept out the door, slamming it behind him, eliciting a little “oh!” from Mrs. Hudson.
Soo-lin played a light legato melody across the booming staccato percussion, before the other woodwinds joined her at letter E of the adagio. This was John’s favorite movement to conduct. He liked the way Soo-lin, easily one of the most concentrated, stoic musicians he had ever worked with, unconsciously smiled as she took a six-measure rest after one of her solos. She loved this work, as did John, who flicked his baton confidently to cut off the woodwinds and introduce the strings. Soo-lin put her flute down, but she wasn’t smiling. Weird. Out of his periphery, John saw a black trench coat swooping towards the orchestra.
“I won’t have it, Sherlock. I’ll only tell you once.”
Christine groaned. “They beat the shit out of him.” She stroked John’s hair, watching his chest rise and fall. “I’m glad you’re safe, Harriet.”
“His shoes?” interjected Mycroft, brow furrowing.
“I supposed there is nothing I can say to convince you otherwise.”
“John, the army is a tool of the state. I won’t have my son as a pawn-”
“Yes. Quite. Then I suppose you encouraged Mrs. Gillespie to ask for Sherlock’s dismissal from Radley, in lieu of a legal battle.”
“Not in your Benz, I’ll be right behind you.”
“I go to a rather dodgy London school too, dad.”
“Social mobility, my literature teacher would call it. Like Heathcliffe.”
“Nah, she got sacked for shagging a Year 10 boy.”
Rochester would privately whinge about their sons’ aberrations. “They’re not even human, Mir!” “They’re capricious, they’re too clever…. They’re so queer, Miriam!” “I hope St. Paul’s will whip them into shape. Not really whip them, of course, but it wouldn’t hurt.”
Sherlock tore himself away from the storefront. The violin was heaven, but Sherlock was not willing to play the part of an angel in order to get there.
“In my head.” Sherlock twanged a discordant note, clearly irritated.
Dog toys for Redbeard, although those were met with great excitement from Sherlock as well; he had grown quite fond of the thing.
“You don’t want me learning to do something you can’t!”
“Get on with it!” As the players quickly shimmied into appropriate positions, John looked around the Maida Vale soundstage at the complement of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Eddie van Coon. Alex Woodbridge. Henry Knight. Soo-lin Yao. Jennifer Wilson. These people had worked tremendously hard to get here. They had made it. Not that the musicians got paid nearly enough, mind. John spoke to administrators about the pay, a tad brashly at times, but truthfully the thrill of conducting was its own reward. He’d do it for free, not that he minded having a nice flat and spare quid for the homeless.
“Six years, John?”
“When mummy established your monthly allowance, she hardly expected you to waste your funds on such trivialities.”
“Meet your brother, Mike.” Daddy lifted the infant from the bassinet, carrying him to the armchair. His father swept the Mycroft’s papers off the seat carelessly, forcing Mycroft to squash himself into a corner to accommodate his fattening father. Fattening and balding, Mycroft noticed. Aging seemed tedious. Father lifted the swaddled infant, pushing a bit of cloth aside so that Mycroft could see its face.
“Yeah, I’ll- I’ll tidy up.”
“Oh. Right.” Sebastian puzzled over that one. Composing? The Chaplain always chided Sherlock for never having a pen and paper out with which to take notes. “Sorry, but how?”
“I’m sorry, dad. It’s- I know what you want. It’s not what I want, but. I dunno. Maybe it’ll work out.”
John was nearly 15.
John swallowed. “Yeah. Lestrade, why don’t you… you know your own composition. You can take them the rest of the afternoon.” John grabbed his bag, stuffing his baton and his music binder into it.
Sebastian bit his lip. He needed to distract them from picking on Sherlock. “You’re a boor, Giles, which is probably why you’re so shite at snowball fights!” Sebastian smashed a fistful of snow into Giles’ face, both boys laughing their arses off. Giles sprang over the bench, tackling Sebastian. Sherlock rolled unceremoniously out of the way, only to be jumped by Julian and Brian.
“Then Will took John’s clarinet, took it out of the case, and he started just miming… oh, god, mum, it was awful. Will was trying to provoke him, ‘course, and when John didn’t rise to the bait, he…” Harriet sighed, pausing.
“I should’ve made you walk the plank!”
“About me being a cock-up,” said John, pressing his hands together behind his back to keep himself from taking a swing at Sherlock.
“Oh, really? So he knows we think he’s a poof?”
Sherlock was one of her favorite boys. He was strange, but quiet, usually no trouble. The lonely sort, although he pretended he wasn’t. He had a lovely mother, a socially inept father, and a gorgeous dog. Cornelia was well aware that she was one of Sherlock’s only advocates at Radley. She was the only person he seemed to take to, really. Oh, he was arrogant sometimes, a bit rude, but she could see he had a good heart. One of the boys, John Carroll, had referred to her as a “saggy bint.” In response, Sherlock had nudged Carroll’s chemistry notebook into the common room’s open fire. Nobody noticed but Cornelia. He knew she saw him. He had raised an eyebrow at her, a question in his eyes. She shook her head softly. No, she wouldn’t turn him in. She had smiled and got herself a cuppa, running a hand through his curls as she left.
Mycroft was immediately struck by two very distinct feelings.
Greg sighed, nodding. “Will you come?”
“Sherlock, this is a very old argument.”
“A bit rich coming from you, don’t you think?”
“You’re so good with them, Dr. Watson,” said Lestrade, walking with John on the outskirts of the soundstage. “They like you and respect you at the same time. That’s an achievement.”
“You, John? You’re busy enough conducting!”
“Mmm. So... Sholto was my major in marching band, you know. We were the only two that went for it.”
“Blimey!” said Lestrade, grinning as he strode over to John. “Can you believe I wrote that?”
“At… Maida Vale?” John gestured at the opulent studio around them, twisting his head to disguise the blush forming on his cheeks.
“He deserves a big cake this year,” said Harriet, rather solemnly.
“He threw it down the storm drain. And then John pushed me into the grass and he jumped Will, and of course Will’s friends were right around the corner and they heard him yelling and they ran over and just…”
Mycroft smiled placably. “I assure you, Sherlock, the sheer number of tasks I engage in which you could not begin to fathom-”
“William,” mummy whispered back. “William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
“John, your Year 11 grades were...err.. superb! Superb, John. Mr. Willoughby says you have a real knack for biology, that you would make a great doctor!”
“But I’m not an artist, dad. Clarinet is great, I love it, but how in God’s name would I make any sort of money after I graduate? With the Army-”
Lestrade sighed, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands. “It was the bit before, Sherlock.”
“And one, and two, and-” the orchestra swelled to its full volume, Soo-lin carrying the melody beautifully on her flute. A subdued type, Soo-lin had nearly started crying when John told her she’d gotten the featured solo in the symphony. She deserved it. Damn hard worker. Beautiful girl.
“Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay.”
“What bit?”
“Oh. I-” Sherlock took a long look at John, a strange look in his eye. “I’m… sorry?”
Lestrade shifted uncomfortably. “He’s with me.” John looked at Lestrade, incredulous.
“You don’t want me learning to do something you can’t,” he finally said, glaring at Mycroft.
“Your assistant?” asked John, incredulous. “And you let him…”
“Come along, Sherlock. I’d hate to see you become…. attached.”
‘Over blackberry jam, nonetheless.’
He pulls back, and I confidently lick my lips, knowing that once I give the command he’ll be the one weak in the knees.
‘What are you looking at?’
'Right, over blackberry jam.' I close my eyes knowing this won’t be the last apology Sherlock will make.
Unblemished.
Sleek.
'Sher-Sher-Sherlock!' I cry out with my release. He continues to stroke my cock as I shudder and try to regain my breath. 'Okay. Okay! I get it, I get it! Apology accepted.'
'We’re more than okay, Sherlock. I just … overreacted.' I grab his unoccupied hand and interlace it with mine, brushing my lips on top of his knuckles.
‘Is that a challenge, Dr. Watson?’
Shame you have on your pyjamas. I’m rather fond of your vulnerability in the mornings. It’s intimate the way you share parts of yourself with me, unbeknownst to you or not. Moments with you set in this stage are blissful, and I hope to have an eternity of them with you.
I’m briskly walking back to my flat, but my short legs can only take me so fast. The thoughts swirling in my head overcome me, and I have to rest on a nearby bench. Have I eaten today? Is that why I’m nauseous or is it because I basically had a one sided domestic with Sherlock in the middle of Tesco over blackberry jam? My cold fingers run through my hair as I quiet an unexpected sob trying to escape my throat. Of course. Dinner at Angelo’s this past Thursday. That was the night we were to celebrate one of my published works. A case we worked on at that. Tears start to trickle down my cheeks. I was left there at Angelo’s all by myself, drawing unnecessary attention from Angelo walking by patting me on the back saying ‘He’ll show up. I just know it.’ By the end of the evening, my entire meal had been comped, and I traipsed back to our shared flat to find Sherlock passed out on the couch. I had been so embarrassed and hurt, that I completely blocked the fresh memory out, unwilling to bring it up to Sherlock and have a row with him over it.
I tug the collar of my coat up to avoid the muggy London air. It’s just another Tesco Tuesday except for the first time in two months Sherlock has decided to grace me with his presence while we shop. How I was able to pull him from this latest experiment - John, trust me when I tell you that the UV-Vis spectrophotometer is quite a simple machine, and that we do need one in our flat. It won’t take up that much room! - is beyond me. The last time I looked at him funny while he was in his studious nature, he threw me out of the flat with a huff, briskly telling me 'go grab a pint with Graham or Molly' and leave him be. To his dismay I had been out all night at the pub watching the game and didn’t get back in until well after two in the morning. Someone at 221B was a bit upset with the fact that their dinner hadn’t been made that night, and it sure wasn’t Mrs. Hudson. Ha. Served him right for kicking me out of our flat and having so many expectations.
Christine smiled up at her husband. “Make dinner, will you? Me and Harriet will stay with John.” James nodded, kissing Christine on the cheek. He turned to head to the kitchen before pivoting back to gently lean down and kiss John on his bruised forehead.
“I don’t. I use that class for composing.” Sherlock’s tone was icier than the thin air around them.
“Pray tell, brother mine. What have you learned?”
“You’re not my ghostwriter, Sherlock.”
“Your talents are more suited to something concrete, something of consequence.”
“Thank you, so much. And please, call me John.”
Lestrade winked. “I best be off, John. That pianist looks ready to shag me with her eyes.”
“Sebastian, remember? You sit behind me in theology.”
Then the second, worse feeling started to skulk over from the back of his skull, curling up somewhere in his frontal lobe. He couldn’t shake the feeling that this infant would be the bane of his existence, be chaos to his meticulous order.
John was humiliated. He could feel the heat rising in his cheeks. “Take five,” he called in a steady tone. The musicians seemed particularly eager to slump in their chairs and lean over to chatter at each other.
“Stop whingeing and get on with it,” said John, laughing. “And-” as he lifted his baton, the string players lifted their horse-hair bows to hover centimeters above their instruments, hands poised to strike at the strings like adders at unsuspecting mice. As John began to conduct, the orchestra sprang into action. At first, the low cellos sounded like sighs. The violins and violas joined in, playing at a delightfully jaunty allegro tempo. As the string section reached the end of the phrase, John held up a hand to indicate they should stop.
Harriet and Christine sat in silence for a while longer.
“Has the Gillespie family reached out to you, Dr. Humphrey?”
Christine heard James fumbling with the key. Glancing at the digital clock on the shelf, she noted it was a bit early for James to be coming home. Usually, he stayed after work to talk with a few of his fellow instructors at the grade school. Then he’d go out and pick up John and Harriet from music lessons before coming home for dinner. For a bohemian, he kept a regular schedule.
And stops.
John’s palm squeezed around Sherlock’s. It was smaller, thicker, it couldn’t physically engulf Sherlock’s hand, but Sherlock felt that it did so anyway; that it engulfed all of him.
“I need-” He pauses, half-expecting Sherlock to interrupt, tell him it’s not needed.
One unwanted talk and a much needed one.
“It’s good. It’s doable. You can do that, yes.” She nods, scribbling.
“Yeah, there you go. Hooray!” He chuckles, noting how after a month of so, her palms won’t fit both into one of his. He cherishes the moment as it is. Here and now. Hopes to never forget it as he reaches for a hairbrush somewhere on the nightstand.
“What? Yes, of course, I’m alright!” Sherlock protects, belatedly, but downs the glass anyway, putting it back on the table in a sharp movement.
He feels John’s gaze on him, and stops, the thread so tight around his finger it hurts as if it were cutting into his skin. He hears the small wooden thud of the cup being placed on the bedside table, and then a warm, reddened palm rests atop his hand.
She turns around, but she won’t be able to sleep again. John has watched her before. She can’t sleep again if she wakes in the morning. It’s about her time anyway, so that shouldn’t bother her in the long run. He makes a mental note that he left her alone without her elephant and without him either so that he can damper the pounding joy in his heart. He’s a father. He should focus on that. Too.
She snorts.
Just to repeat the warning of the tags here; strong homophobic language in this chapter (not by John or Sherlock, obviously).
“Thank you.”
“Left or right?” John asks, an ever-present grin straining his zygomatic muscle for which he couldn’t care less.
‘Get. Up’
. They’re here to talk about Rosie and Rosie alone.
Dancing.
Sherlock’s mouth has still not closed in its entirety. He tries to object once more, but John nods before Sherlock can and she motions them towards her office. A hand flicking back in confident dismissal of any worries one of her patients’ parents might have.
Note: depression anxiety can be a weird combo. And in any case, not one person will experience these mental health illnesses/struggles in the same way as another. Even symptoms can vary. No individual journey through this storm is more trivial than another.
Faceless greetings. That’s what they’ve become. Every time he leaves for work or returns from it. All blurred into one. He has forgotten how these people - Greg, Molly, Angelo when no one else is available, even Donovan passing once – were actually there to take care of both his daughter and check in on the detective in the early mornings. Forgotten to thank them. To express gratitude. He doesn’t know how to do that anymore.
“That’s good, Rosie. Very good”, he praises with a kiss to her right hand, that she keeps braced onto the table. Left-handed. Of course. She giggles, and offers him a spoonful, waving it to his direction with encouraging whines.
“I would advise you to keep up the good work then. Both of you. It’s working.” Chloe adds.
Moments when he caught the glimpse of a fleeting smile or ones when the lack of any reaction was alarming. When John felt ill-prepared for his mind’s tricks. When he would lean close just to smell the man beside him. Let the warmth and homely scent envelop him and scare his fears away just for a moment. Moments when he could hope, that’s what his daughter felt as well. Innocent care.
would never come between John and his sister. John was not that kind of man, that kind of human. And perhaps that he could tell her that she wasn’t that kind of human either.
“Well…” Sherlock shrugs again, looking at his shoes.
“Hey. She likes you fetching it for her. She doesn’t mean any harm.”
The silence is broken by Rosie’s soft giggle and they both look at her, a little bit wide eyed at how much happier than before she sounded; if that is even possible. Then John goes on to fix her breakfast and their routine catches them, letting them dance around each other again but not reveal more. And when John goes downstairs to put in the laundry -a small pink elephant showing at the top of their laundry basket- Rosie follows him with grabby hands and Sherlock rushes to help her get down the stairs. And John’s heart is still giggling with love.
Some notes:
“When you are my age, you can be allowed some freedoms”, she says, facing him with her hands crossed over her chest.
He could not look at John for long each time. If he did, the vision might shatter, and reality around him collapse once again.
“What’s going on, Sherlock?”
“Not-… entirely. I believe… he’s been really good at hiding it.”
“Making a mess for nothing.”
“Hey, hey, it’s alright, I’ve got you.”
Sherlock narrows his eyes, flicks the kettle switch off. He is not happy she is here.
“Hudders. And I told you I couldn’t sleep”
“I’m glad you told me.”
“The big ship sails-ow” He tries with his nose closed, chuckling; snorting. “On the ally ally oh!” John pants a breath, voice getting muffled by the nose-hold.
“I believe Rosie is going to be just fine. Such psychological imbalances before the age of three are not usually sustained or remembered. She might need your careful guidance and some nudges maybe, but I believe she’s already on the way to perfection. As long as you love her and show her. I can help if you want me to. We can keep an appointment every week for a month and then depending on Rosie’s progress, one every other week.”
“To pass it on as a second name to all sons of the Watson’s.”
‘What the fuck am I gonna do with both of you, huh...?’
“Sorry. Just. Um. Too vague. Could you… um… elaborate?”
“She is”
“No, no, that went… wow, that went, yeah…” He looks at his jeans.
“You’ve had enough of your
He hates having to think about his failing attempts at fatherhood. Realising his daughter has had minimal contact with people who love her. Doubting she will even remember even a faraway scent of her mother’s presence. (‘Mary’ barely even cared anyway.) He hates to watch in this blasted life that he’s locked himself in, while she takes her first steps into this world slower than normal, underdeveloped in certain areas because of his flaws, but too fast for him to change anything he has done wrong.
Disappointing. He can’t keep up with anything. He’s so far behind that it’s better to let go. Let go, say goodbye and stop grabbing onto life so helplessly. Wouldn’t that be brave to do? Wouldn’t that honour his past? His history? Wouldn’t that appease them? Letting them have a better life without him?
“Morning!” John ruffles Rosie’s curls and she blinks, eyes owllike at him, any sound she was about to emit, crushed into her little throat.
Rosie falls silent, cuddling her pink elephant.
They do need to talk. Rosie can ignore him, but Sherlock can’t avoid him. They can’t do that. Not forever. John needs to know. He needs to ask. Will it be rejection, indifference or annoyance? Is it decided already? Since this morning? Sherlock discreetly pushed him away, so... Was it the fact that he talked? That he tried? Was it too much? Too little? Too late?
Rosie left a small sniffle escape the quiet. Her screaming had stopped. John’s hands were coiled at the sink -white, white. A sink brimming with more things broken.
He has stepped down the stairs without noticing. His nails are digging hard into the tapestry of their corridor.
“How is she?” He controls his voice.
John waves a hand dismissively and goes back to making coffee. He’s already dressed for work. Sherlock looks down at his clothes and regrets that this is not a I’m-strong-enough-to-get-out-of-my-pyjamas day. He stands slowly, and it is an agony when he tries to get comfortable on the kitchen chair. He braces an arm around his ribs.
“Come on.” John walks to Sherlock’s side, leaning close, hand over his shoulder. “Let it be for now, hm?”
No-one had contacted Sherlock, during those days. Sherlock had kept himself well away, as instructed. He was still holding on to Molly’s message. Found himself reading it when he felt too close to being happy, when he stopped noticing things that were novel and took them for granted. Almost like a pinch on the arm.
“Why?”
to intervene.
There’s a soft cling at his side, creating a chain of echoes in his ringing ears. He dares to peer from one open eyelid, only able to make out the shape of a glass at the table beside him. Two plops and then sizzling. John imagines the small flick of the bony hand that threw the effervescent tablets in. His mind roars and it all crashes down on him at once.
He empties the glass of vodka promptly demonstrating. His mind starts to quieten down. Not enough yet, but just so he can order another glass. The fire courses through him one more time, aching muscles are tremoring in its passing, smoke clouds his eyes. He blinks.
“John, it’s important to note, you’ve been doing very well, despite the circumstances. You need to guide yourself to let go of the blame and focus on her as the person she is once more. You both deserve it.”
He watched as John was digging through the second medicine cupboard, and at last -after some rummaging- produced the syrup for Sherlock’s heartburn; pills were even harder to get down when it reared its head. John measured the dull liquid with precision in the little cup and handed it to Sherlock with a gentle nod.
‘Genius.’
“Apology accepted.” Comes the soft rumble and John almost smiles.
John’s face is burning. He looks at his feet as he gathers Rosie’s bag and they walk past the door Doctor Chloe opens for them, ushering them inside like a mother hen. John remembers she’s around their age, late thirties – early forties, but she looks way younger without any attempt to do so. Has working with children all her life taken any part in this? Maybe. He supposes when one knows what to do and has done it millions of times before -a plus for her-, it’s not as challenging as society likes of you to think.
But it’s fake. But this is real.
John pauses, contemplates while he chews on the inside of his cheek. With a sniff of his button nose, he nods.
“It seemed fitting to just… let you know now.” He shrugs, fingers engulfing the cared for palm. “I don’t mind it as much anymore. Thanks to you.”
. And I am rebuilding my life. I am trying. You see? Something doesn’t add up. I would have cared for you, would have
“Look, I…” John lowered his gaze to his feet, fingers scratching at his nape compulsively. “The past year hasn’t been easy for either of us. We just… We decided to at least try. We are trying. We work better together than apart…”
But now he has one. A little, precious girl.
“Yes. However you want that to be. If you’d want things to be as they have been so far then that’s what we’ll do. I just have to… For me it’s…” John’s voice cracks, but he reins it in, resuming control. As if he is trying to stay strong for both their sakes.
“It wasn’t? Then why do you prefer
John inhales. Holds. Sherlock’s eyes drift to the baby chair. The small head with sunshine curls is resting, blissfully asleep, a tiny frown over the small button nose. The glance is meaningful, making John swallow at his ignorance. Of course Sherlock would understand. John has not stopped feeling the iridescent gaze on him, caressing as it comes and goes in slow inspections; as if it were taking stock that everything in their surroundings is in order. Vigilant but gentle, a bird herding its younglings.
“Some water, please? A bottle?” John’s voice is polite and kind, and, as always, dashing, show-off green. Sherlock wants to pick it apart, to stop it from doing the inevitable.
John doesn’t know why he repeats himself, needing to check this is still real by hearing his own voice, not knowing what else to say. Posture defensive and closed off, it’s obvious even for the stupidest man to realise Sherlock is bracing. He doesn’t want John anywhere near him, especially in a private space that is his room.
John doesn’t know what comes over him. Maybe it’s the simple fact their little Rose is strong and healthy and happy that makes him lose composure. Or their locked gazes, filled with questions and expectation. Or their perfectly mutual love for their tiny little bundle upstairs in itself with no other fact surrounding it. Or just the fact they’re there alive. But John nods. Nods with delight. And when Sherlock’s face shows the first signs of registering the fact, when the first sparkle flies in the air… John just runs down the steps and falls into the very much startled man he loves, arms wrapping around him, momentum pushing them back and back and back until they hit a wall. John’s face mushes against Sherlock’s neck as he oomphs surprised with the wall behind his thin frame and John pushes his palms up to hold him tighter, protective of Sherlock’s back as with every part of him.
Their eyes meet. John knows Sherlock knows, or perhaps he fears that Sherlock does. He looks away, gritting his teeth. The fridge stops gurgling, and there are no sounds, then, nothing to fill the empty space between them, so that it grows into a void, an airtight bag. There is a kick in Sherlock’s stomach, his blood surging, as if being drawn to the surface of his skin. Adrenaline.
Trust issues.
John stomps down the stairs exasperated; Rosie, a bundle of crying blankets in his arms. He enters the kitchen in a flurry, one baby blanket hanging loose over his thigh.
Why? His scarlet for the red, and then maybe the red would be red no more, but sky, sky, and there’d be nothing more, a window, a way out, call, why a call, why that voice, that voice on the end of the bloody line-
He has tried to understand why this is happening. He was not diagnosed as having neurological damage before admittance to rehab. The drugs he overwhelmed his transport with could have idled his memory, left a punch of a black hole of those days in it. And that they did; there are days, even weeks missing. But could that have been enough to strip away an entire mental faculty, his ability to deduce and store, almost every single wing of his Mind Palace? He has researched every article, consulted every paper, every study ever made in search of an answer. Nothing. Every turn he takes is a dead- end.
books. Sherlock’s. Long gone. The man. The books. He might as well have thrown them in the fireplace. None of it existed anymore. Not for John.
Sherlock’s arms are already there to catch her, even if he was nibbling like a sparrow on a scone when they entered.
was the one who had caused more hurt. He had been there, all the time;
John’s vision turns quick and blurry as he rushes beside him. Sherlock had straightened up from the start of the conversation. Now his fingers are digging to his pyjama bottoms and his back is curved inwards with the effort to breathe.
“I will just hurt you all over again.” An icy breath.
“Come in”, in a voice rough from disuse. Unable to conceal an undertone of warning. He winces at the realisation.
Sherlock watches from the safety of his armchair as Mrs. Hudson scoffs, clearly unimpressed by the effort.
“Sorry. I said; we can watch Bake off today if you’d like. There’s a rerun of the last season playing all day in Channel 4.”
"There", John whispers, his eyes seeking Sherlock's. "We don't want you catching a cold in this weather".
This is familiar. This is his doctor skills territory, he can do this. Sherlock’s eyes remain terrifyingly blank.
On with it then.
“You don’t want to be. But you are, now. It’s okay”
John joins him, and it’s seamless; stream flowing into its river. There’re two sets of hands with coordinated movements, two figures filling the space against the first white morning light.
“You need rest…”
Lips touch. And lock. Slide. Brush.
At first, he used to fight against it. Used to fear it. He doesn’t, now. He closes his eyes and just waits for it to spread, for the shivers to come, for the hollow feeling to settle in his throat, that of wanting to cry but being entirely unable to. And then it truly starts. The whirlwind that comes and goes, carrying
“It’s okay”, John adds, quickly. “Only if you-” Sherlock is happy to shush him by turning his body so that he can lie with his legs resting across John’s thighs; one and then the other.
“I know we have talked about Sherlock before. Many times. But things have changed and talking about it now might help.”
Sherlock. Today. It is as concerning as the halo of fire diminishing around his friend.
“A little”
John clears his throat. "I should-". Sherlock waits, tilting his head a little to the side. "Would you mind? Me and Rosie, staying", John adds in a steady voice. Sherlock blinks. "I know it's a bit of a rush, but I just-" He shuffles, looks at his shoes as if seeing them for the first time.
“Sherlock.” His tone is steel. “I
She gives a small, hesitant whine. He can almost smell the fear. She must have heard them shouting. She must have picked up their upset tones and now she’s afraid because she whined and drew attention to herself. John leans and picks her up with gentle fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s hand falls. A small tremble to it.
John sweats himself to wakefulness. Uncoordinated legs try to untangle from the duvet. His breathing is erratic and he curls into a ball once again. The clock on the bedside table showing the date and time punctually. The 17
He steps into the kitchen doorway, eyelids fluttering madly, blinking, trying to distinguish any movements through the shadows. The small light of the cooker looks too much like a fire for his liking, flickering as he blinks again and then looks away, always at the edge of his vision.
“Then, if anything concerning happens, you know who to turn to. He will trust the people you do.”
Of course, there is still the issue of Sherlock’s physical recovery. His cracked, struggling-to-mend ribs still hurt, even though the bruises have mostly healed. The stitches on his forehead have been absorbed, as they were that convenient kind of stitches, and the hematoma in the white of his eye has faded to a soft pink. His cut lip has only a small scab left over what used to be a wound. He may be on fifteen different pills daily to keep him going until his immune system has established some semblance of control. But even to his health, there is a routine. John knows what to do, how to care, how to help. Nothing unexpected or serious there to make him worry more. Well, bar that incident in the bathroom earlier today. Which was stupid on Sherlock’s part, really. He feels ashamed at the memory, decides to make sure he is never found in such an embarrassing state again.
“Was it this way or…?”
Never daring to ask. John longed to hear those words; “May I... can I hold her?”. In any form, they would be enough. But Sherlock never asks. Never indicates his longing to do so either. But he’s always ready. Arms always waiting for when he’ll be granted with the gift to hold her. Equally, no objection left neither of their lips when John leaned close to take her. It was all a game. That’s all it was.
“But..?”
Then, the alarm sounds. He winces. Milk barely escaping from dripping down his trousers.
John doesn’t hesitate. Is not frozen, not for one moment. He’s beside Sherlock in mere seconds, holding him steady. The man is panting, in a state of panic, pupils wide and respiration rate almost non-existent. John holds the wrist of the injured palm tight. Sherlock makes an attempt to hide it away but it only lasts a second as John turns them face to face. There are shards all over the sink. A broken glass. Water. Sherlock was trying to calm himself when it happened? What happened?
was the one needing a forgiveness. That
“Hey, Sherlock... everything okay?”
Where is the harm in never telling John? In never letting John find out? It won’t be that difficult, after all. Not more difficult than it has already -and always- been. Most probably, it is for the best.
“Yes, she’s doing-” Sherlock.
“All done.” John hears Sherlock’s immediate relieved exhale. He raises to meet the blue gaze, closing the syrup bottle safely. “Come on, let’s get her to rest. I need to get you fed and nourished too.” He jokes with a soft tone.
John makes tea. It should feel more surreal than it does. He lets Sherlock hold honeybee, and Sherlock removes her gently from the carrier to nestle her against his chest, to the sounds of John searching about the almost empty kitchen. He can still picture every movement of John's body behind the screen door. Every single one.
He composes a message swiftly, presses ‘send’;
“Oh” He swallows, eyes finding the sitting silhouette at the centre of the bed. “Sherlock?”
sound agonised. Where her tone wavered and she looked genuinely lost. Just as in need of help as she claimed John was. Sherlock wishes he had helped her and John reconcile, somehow. That he had been able to give John his
Sherlock stays still. Harry does not see him as she walks to the chair beside the sofa. And then she’s lost from view. Sherlock gravitates closer to the fridge on silent feet. He leans against it, and waits. Its monotonous mechanical purring calms him, helps him focus on something other than the gallop of his heart.
He takes a step forward. And another.
“You’d let me”
Sherlock looks up, shrugs... and smiles back. John halts a moment. Just to witness such an act is a wonder.
It felt as if they had swapped places. His every fear was being reflected back at him. It was surreal. It made him doubt everything. It forged a new path through everything. It was just a glimpse, and yet it grabbed a hold and would not let go.
That was her whole face. Screaming it. Constantly.
Sherlock did not want to face the answer.
But… was he?
His eyes are laughing.
That sounded demanding. He peered an eye open.
Cathartic. His entire chest roars with life, with colour, with joy so sharp it feels like pain, relief so overwhelming his knees go weak.
John brings his finger between them, holding it for Sherlock to inspect. He nods, satisfied and John sits back on their Persian rug with a smile. The fire’s warmth is floating towards them at a slow pace. The -only a tiny bit- damp wood catches and bursts, pops with the heat, releasing any trace of humidity from inside its cracks. No smoke is coming out to dull the room. A job well done.
“Harry.” John growls.
“An elephant! One of the most intelligent and intriguing mammals. A very interesting choice. And of course, it is obvious now! Here is the trunk”, he points on her artwork, where vaguely a head shape is drawn by a still-clumsy childish hand, “and these are the ears!”
.” She rushes with an impatient sigh, as if lightning will strike, just by her talking about it.
She stands in front of the fridge and looks up at him. He picks a magnet and gives it to her -she has to let her elephant down at her feet to take it. “You do it, little bee. Place your drawing wherever you want, and put the magnet on it to secure it”
First they’d been running around in circles. John refused to see clearly, how it wasn’t him, how it was Sherlock’s stupid outburst that had caused the nightmare of the previous day. John had spoken about rehab as if he were a dog with rabies that had to be put down. The memory still made Sherlock’s bone-marrow run cold.
together, I just-”
It had felt like waking up on the wrong side of the looking glass. Looking at his reflection in the mirror and seeing that it was another face looking back at him. The words John had spoken weren't at all what he had been expecting to hear. Not from John's mouth.
It’s always been like this with Ella. She supported the theory that everything will come on their own time. It’s times like this when he feels grateful for having this with her, a close relationship cultivated through the years he’s been coming for his sessions, never erased even at times he stopped for an indefinite hiatus.
He nods. She waits, pen on the notepad. He breathes.
“I want back in. To the group.”
John takes a step closer.  And Stops. “It’s serious”
It’s better.
John sniffs but keeps breathing through the nose. Sherlock realizes he was panting ever so softly. He swallows. Then reaches for John’s other hand. John jerks, and his eyes blink rapidly before they focus on Sherlock’s face. The pressure in the muscles and tendons of his hand increases; Sherlock can feel it, almost as if it is a live wire, charged up again.
“Mm?”
It’s not a single moment in time but their accumulation. Building up gradually like the crest of a wave; this is not them. This was never meant to be them. But this is them now. His skin feels foreign on him; stolen, almost. As if he’s woken up and found himself in someone else’s life, in someone else’s nightmarish dream. And the worst is, that this was happening. It was happening, and he did not stop it, and it became this.
“Good”
John remembers now and doesn’t rush, doesn’t push forward in his worry anymore. It’s normal. To have lost the tender balance they once had. It’s normal to seek to find it again. To test it, modify it, work it to perfection. He knows how it is to lose it. Twice. It cost him everything. There’s no way he’s giving up on it again. Ever.
The next cry is incomprehensible.
“I didn’t- didn’t hurt them, just... was afraid I might had, and so drunk myself to a stupor in the evening.” He clenches his fist, the fresh bandage over his knuckles stretching with the motion. He’s sure she’s noticed but he doesn’t want to talk about that at the moment.
“Great.” He breathed.
“John, if I may ask…”
“John, you’re fussing.” He nudges him when he lingers too much.
Sherlock places his feet against the floor of the tub, and his knees poke above the surface of the water. A sack of flesh and bones and ruins… There is no knowing what tonight’s ordeal caused further. Except if…
“Want it? Yes. I do. Of course I do”, John replies, without missing a beat.
“First of all thank you for… Giving me space. About therapy. I needed… I needed to settle with my decisions first before I told you about them and… Yeah, I’m ready to do that now”
John chuckled. What a tease.
“Mm? Yes, she… well, yesterday… we went to the park.” He swallows. He needs to talk about this. Still, silence follows. His foot fidgets. He digs his nails to his knee. “She was happy. Played in the grass.”
John is running. Slow at first, and then faster, steadying Honeybee to his chest with both arms.
“Did not doubt you did.” Sherlock nods, as if persuading himself.
“Got it.”
John opts to open the door immediately at Sherlock’s whiny voice coming from somewhere closer to the floor than he’d like.
‘Stop it.’
John shakes his head with a bitter chuckle. “I have no idea. No fucking idea. I don’t think even she knows anymore”
‘I think about it all day anyway and nothing can take that away, so what’s the point of not doing it?’
Sherlock doesn’t want John to let her in. Doesn’t want this illusion of togetherness, of domesticity, to end here, to be poisoned by all the words that wait on her tongue this time.
Why did she stare at him for a second more than necessary?
Her shoulders fall and she slouches as if scolded by a teacher. Just as she used to do when younger. She catches John’s gaze and straightens up, eyes burning red with shame and anger. John manages to keep himself from smirking. It wouldn’t do. She would be furious. But she can’t stop him from contemplating how great a team Sherlock and him make. Once again. After so long. Both fit to take care of Rosie. As a team. As they’ve been doing. Only thing they need is to get Harry out of here and dissuade her from alerting social services.
Sherlock frowns.
Today was different. Maybe he had seen it before. Maybe that once. But it was still different. Sherlock hadn’t recoiled. Hadn’t flinched. Hadn’t stopped. Hadn’t pressured. He hadn’t been urgent or indifferent, bored or dismissing. Most importantly, Sherlock hadn’t sat and taken it. Hadn’t attempted to divert John’s anger at him as usual. He simply, knowingly, respectfully, strongly, strictly had been
“John dear?”
Sherlock nods.
Their gazes lock and John almost sees the same conversation running through Sherlock’s mind. He looks at his knees again.
The breaths ease. The heartbeat slows down. The last faded images that haunted him retreat, like hissing snakes scared away by fire.
Just to hear him giggle again.
A gasp. Tiny, but there. John turns his eyes to him. This time Sherlock’s gaze is water on his skin, cleansing him whole.
John kissed him.
Fingers stilling, he inhales, sharply. Holds the air as he lets his eyes stray to the window and the first moments of clear day through it. They’ll be waiting for him. John, Honeybee. As if not a single day apart has passed. As if… as if it was only ever them. If only for some moments, Sherlock can believe that’s all there ever was.
“Will you? Just for a second?” John leans forward. Rosie lets go of his shoulder and leans away too.
John enters 221B with his hands full of shopping bags. He’s been scolding himself for not dressing Rosie in warmer clothes yesterday the whole way home. It’s later than Sherlock would have expected him to be back and he hopes the target of his adoration is not panicking too much. John can imagine him. In fact, he can see him clear as day; pacing over furniture and twitching whole, eating his nails one by one until they’re all done, checking on Rosie and starting over again. John is already regretting his decision of stopping by the shops, but they needed to do the shopping one way or another and since he needed to buy Rosie’s syrup… might as well get done with it all.
John stops, palms over his knees, head bent between them, wrist aching, heart clenching. He would die. He would die if Sherlock left again. Left or…
And they follow a rhythm, John immersed in Sherlock’s softer tones, still in progress of creating that cocoon, that nestling little place with Sherlock’s voice all around him? Yes, that. Until John has melted over the bathtub’s side again, head tipped over once more, breathing slow and steady.
“I know, you moron. Wouldn’t think I’d hear from you again so soon. What changed your mind?”
But John had smiled.
“What is?”
But isn’t that what he wants? Wasn’t it him that was so sure he’d take shards over nothing? The possibility of friendship over not having John in his life at all? This only reads like a joke. There must be a punchline somewhere -possibly voiced by his brother, who will appear showered in the confetti of state files.
John walks down Elgin Avenue, hands shoved in pockets, head bent low, the drawn consonants of the voice in his head haunting him. His lips purse.
Rosie shifts and sucks on her thumb with a content whine. Sherlock smiles.
If there’s one thing John knows by now, is that Sherlock will never let Rosie be hurt. Whatever his decision will be regarding yesterday, Sherlock will always be there for her and John believes it, knows it, wants it, hopes for it. Even when he wonders if this is enough, if in a couple of months Sherlock would want to run around London chasing criminals, John can’t ignore what he has seen in Sherlock’s eyes when he looks at her. So, it is indeed no surprise the way Sherlock looks at her now and the way he responds with a definite
Sherlock feels the boundaries of 221B, its sounds, its colours, the light that tries to reach them, dust particles floating in its rays. There is safety here. There is safety under this roof, where John is his friend, where Honeybee can have a home.
“She’ll be here. She has missed you.”
She whines, not understanding the sudden outburst of emotion. Even though she loves being cuddled and coddled, she now picks up on the strange hue in his mood and is worried. Sherlock hurries to place her on the mat again and smile to reassure her. She pouts, boops his nose in silent question. He boops her back, affirming all is well, and she squeals and rushes to her toys again.
John’s eyebrows raised above the rim of his glass.
“Sh’lock?”
Sherlock lingers close. Not close enough, not close like he used to do, but stays in John’s orbit. His presence is quiet, self-contained, whatever words he means to say lingering on the edges of his fingertips, the tilts of his head, the pursing of his lips. But but it is solid enough to chase away the eerie silence eating away at John’s bones, the ugly whispers it brings with it. Sherlock is becoming his very own moon, binding the caprice of the tide inside him, guiding the waters to push, pull, find a rhythm, turn into waves,
Next update will be next Thursday *fingers crossed* Check our Tumblr for updates/any changes -and say hello, too, if you wish ^^
They are shoved and prodded, and John is now beside him. Sherlock cannot physically turn so that his eyes can remain locked on him and has to stare ahead to a random point. There are murals and posters on the curved walls, for musicals and ads, and the fonts and colours coil and hiss into his mind. Other, other, he needs to find something else. Breaths flocking in his throat, he looks around him. Lady in the pink hat. Pink... Pink... Baby pink? Blush? She has golden earrings... And... Is that... Is that a promise ring? Heavy makeup. Is that contour?... Where did she come from? High heels. So... not much walking? Her stride is small... Not used to them? Hurts? Uncomfortable? Her dress is ironed... So that means... That means... Other, other! That man in the tuxedo. Tuxedo. It's barely nine forty. Then... required by his job? What job requires the employees to wear a tuxedo? This early in the morning? Maybe an important event? This early in the morning?! Can't be going far -has he sweated? What if he has, if he hasn't? His hands are smooth, so not manual, but then can't be... Can't be... He hasn't shaved! He... He's... His hair is... matted... at the back of his neck, so... Improper grooming? Rest is polished. Someone matted it -no, he did? Other! Focus! ‘Don't be stupid’. That woman in black! Widow -no. Lipstick. Adulterer? What? No- the boy in the uniform. Easy –‘come on Sherlock!’ Which school? Where? How far? 'I don't know'. Stupid. 'I don't know!'. Stupid. Other! The girl the man the one in the green shirt no the white no the tie why too young too old office worker what rank what company don't know stupid don't know don't know don't-
Sherlock can swear he has seen before. All proud and content, and yet as if it were tutting at the same time.
Into battle, then.
“Well then. You can imagine” John smiles at him over Honeybee’s golden hair, as he had leaned close to praise her for eating her last bite, with a kiss. “Not that he ever deterred her from being ‘loud and proud’. But it did… bounce back a lot”
“John?” There’s alarm in Sherlock’s voice.
‘Only today.’ He reminds himself.
“Now, now, all done. All well.” John dabs a wet cloth over the blood, careful and around the wound only, not to agitate the cut. “Hooold your breath.” He demonstrates as he holds the disinfectant patiently, like he does with most of his younger patients.
His fingers coil; tight fists. It’s his trigger. He knows it is.
John can’t help but feel he’s not doing enough again. Not being a proper parent, not being there when she needs him. But he needs to keep his worry back. It’s selfish to think more about it when he has to take care of her. He needs to block it out. And he doesn’t want to worry Sherlock more either.
“Which one?”
The man took him by the wrist and dragged him along to where Rosie sat over Sherlock’s armchair on her baby chair.
“You’re sure?”
There is silence for some moments, and Sherlock can almost hear John’s mind whirring, thumping against the confines of his skull. And then John pulls at his hair with more force than before.
“Morning...”
“…Yes”
John’s steps are slow ad tentative over the creaking wood of the corridor. His ears are tuned in for any developments from the bathroom. There’s shuffling and a quiet grunt and John’s feet accelerate, his hand raising to knock.
“Nonsense, of course she wants a hug! Come here, darling, don’t listen to him calling you stroppy”, Mrs. Hudson coos, coaxing Honeybee into her arms.
She’s not rebuking, not judging.
“Hm? Yes, yes”
“He passed by last on the… twelfth of January, I believe. I assume he’s busy”
“Thank you.” Sherlock just speaks; soft, as he sat. As simple as that.
“After what I did to you. After I beat you to a pulp.” His voice is coming out but barely, hoarse and aching with every word. “It wasn’t what I wanted. But I had to. It was necessary. I needed to- to say goodbye. I needed -selfishly, again- to leave you alone.”
“Sherlock has always been… like a little brother to me.”
‘Just like Harry.’ He thinks. He’s bitter. Of course, he’s just like Harry. It’s doesn’t matter how their lives turned out. What matters is, they’re heading on the same track and they come from the same childhood. End of story. Neither of them can be parents because of it. That’s why he can’t give her Rosie. That’s why he can’t give up.
. She’s ours”, John cuts in.
‘Lullaby…’
“Oof… Christ, how did you manage-”
Weirdo,
“Alright. I will check. You stay calm, alright? It’s probably just a cold”, Mrs. Hudson soothes, transferring Honeybee to his arms -which raise to hold her without prompting. She sneezes again as he settles her against him, her small body shaking with the effort. She is clinging onto him like a baby monkey, her face mushed in the crook of his neck. She needs reassurance more than he does, and that helps shake him back to reality. He is the one responsible for her in the absence of her father.
“Sherlock…”, she tuts when she took in the mess in the sink and the kitchen table. “Is this from my good china set?”, she lifts a cracked cup from the top of the pile, keeping it away from her as if it were a dead rat.
John can hear the tentative tone. Checking, needing reassurance, caring. Rosie’s fever could have come back after all.
“John.” A breath. A double check. “It was me who needed forgiveness first. At least, I thought so.”
“You could’ve made an exception.”
The ice cracks. A veil being lifted. He can breathe, where he was underwater all this time.
“Been thinking of making her a formula. One of the old ones she’s not eating daily anymore.”
Just as Harry said. His life is departing without him. The kitchen is empty. No pig in the fridge. No toes in the microwave. No glass microscope slides filled with samples and immaculately catalogued and organised over the table. Maybe that’s it. That’s reality. Maybe he imagined it all. Maybe John is dead because
"I mean, you- You must not get tired holding her".
And John can’t end this. He can’t finish it with a click of a trigger like he once could have. All because of one simple reason. One major development that he hadn’t thought of when he put this off for years. Believing he would get better. He would get a normal family and the best man he ever knew by his side… It would all get better… But it hasn’t… and he can’t do anything about it.
He blinked, suspicious. He knew this was a dream. Which was strange and terrifying. He was dreaming. Moving made no difference. There were no walls or floor. Nothing to touch. To feel. Only... a faint smell of tobacco. Tobacco ash. Sherlock’s favourite. Although forbidden.
be on the same page? If John thinks he has understood, even now, he is in for a treat. Sherlock must somehow make a meaning out of this. Because what happened is weird, and confusing, and all he yearned for but seven years late and in the wrong version of reality. But now he wants to cling on to the only things he knows. He wants to feel this moment as it is. Consequences can wait.
“Ready?”
“I don’t- think so. We did run full tests at her birth. And she understands what we’re saying and when we refer to her or call for her.”
The secret was out. The silence severe. John had finally told him.
“Tell me how you’re feeling”
“That has nothing to do with Rosie.”
“Aren’t you going to tell her someday, mm?”
Sherlock is sitting by the desk, laptop on the morning papers. He types slower than John ever remembers him doing before but he has stopped now. John shoots up a glance, curious.
John’s lips are warm against his, the pressure he puts into the kiss what has him leaning against Sherlock’s body and standing on tiptoes. Sherlock thinks of the down on a peach, the softest pastel sky-blue, the trembling dew-wet wings of a butterfly.
“You too, Ella” He smiled an honest full smile then.
John glances at Sherlock. He’s hiding a smile behind his scarf and his eyes are shining.
John doesn’t see him.
He swallowed a growl, but the next came louder. The shards were falling form his hands as if his palms were soap-water. Scalding, acidic.
They spend some time in companionable silence sipping tea and Sherlock even starts nibbling some eggs, legs curled under his body, plate on his lap. John takes a plate with two scones on, their gazes locking for a fleeting moment. John gives an encouraging nod and they look back on their plates again. Understanding is passing between them with every gesture. Pity is non-existent, as it should be. Companionship and genuine care are highlighted. John hopes Sherlock feels it too.
He supports her weight with an arm below her bum and stands. “Now… Let’s see what we have, mm?” He finds the packaging of the cream she refused this morning and shows it to her. “We have this. It’s… Ah, peach flavoured”, he holds the colourful small can closer so that she can see. “Would you want to give this another go, Rosie?”. She shakes her head no against his neck and hides again. “That’s alright” He puts the can down and cups her head with his palm. She whines like a kitten, but her body eases against his.
“Oh.” He paused, his mind racing, trying to think of clever alternatives and coming up empty.
...That it wasn’t about
The brilliant man who stuttered and stood silent when John declared him his best friend.
Sherlock knows. He heard John’s choked off, watery words at the therapist’s office too. “For so long. Too long.
No needles here, no blank-faced doctors and blinding lights above his head, no straps, no pain. Pain.
He stands, joints creaking, and approaches cautiously.
“Say what?”
let you do it again. You
Sherlock said he wants to. He blushed. He liked it. He wanted it.
‘Tell me something I don’t know.’
“So?”, she asks, getting comfortable on John’s armchair.
“Your daughter has the most beautiful eyes!”, the waitress coos at Sherlock. Honeybee burrows closer to his chest, weary of the new voice.
“John.” Deep, drawn, vowel puffing like a bird free to fly home. Steady.
“Ah…” John looks down. “Yeah… it makes sense for you to believe that and I am truly sorry I made you think of it that way.”
Mesmerised by the expertly cultivated female tone of a clearly top of her field therapist and soothed by Sherlock’s secure embrace, Rosie peaks out of her hiding spot, curious.
Resistance had ebbed from him gently, easily. Sherlock had just closed his eyes and felt it, felt how it was to be held, to feel John’s solid body against his own, drinking it all in like a parched flower finally getting to bask in the sun. Everything John unknowingly touched, every ruin and scar and flaw, he gentled and smoothed out, gave beauty to. Healing was real, in that moment. Healing, living, wanting,
“Oi! Oi!” chorused the violinists as they turned back a few pages, scrambling for their bows.
John smiled. Lestrade was easy to like. “Not at all. I like the way that the fervor of the brass and percussion contrasts with the calmness of the strings. And Soo-lin’s delicate solo atop it all!” John wasn’t much of a flatterer. He did think it was a bit heavy, but didn’t want to extend rehearsals even later to accommodate any new changes. He licked his lips, hoping Lestrade would buy it.
A bona-fide human skull and spine for Sherlock (“Excellent!”).
“Well, err- John, what do you want? I mean, you want the Army. I know you want to enlist, and it’s not just because of the money, but I don’t really want-”
“Oh, right. Bit dodgy, that school.”
Mycroft broke the reverie.
“Dad, I’d be a doctor, not a munitions expert. Have you looked- I looked it up on the school computer, and the Army offers an extremely generous bursary. They-”
“He’s willing to finance your musical education, as a personal favor to an old friend. Regardless of how I feel about charity, it’s a free education, John, an opportunity most young artists- most young people- would jump at.”
“That applied to a music program?”
“He’s a freak,” said Anderson, before Lestrade had a change to open his mouth. “Complete arsehole. Always losing the plot. Lestrade keeps him around like… his sniffer dog.”
“Are you trying to ask me something, mum?”
“I’m afraid so, Dr. Humphrey. Sherlock is ill-accustomed to criticism, let alone criminal accusation.”
As Sherlock entered the building, he could hear the melody leaking from a nearby soundstage. He rounded the corner and found himself standing in the gargantuan Studio MV1.
