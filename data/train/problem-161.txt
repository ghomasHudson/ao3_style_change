Lo mien?
John stopped and pressed this lips together, and halting Sherlock's arguments instantly. Their eyes held like a thin thread of steel connected them before John finally stretched a hand towards the taller man.
"Well open the next one then."
"You're claustrophobic" he murmured, earning another poisonous glare, and a growl
Her sharp voice cut through his thoughts and drew his cold blue eyes to her face, "Since when do you have a degree in Psychology, Sergeant?" before she could stumble over a reply, the lift doors opened and he marched out, eyes already seeking a familiar tall figure, arguing with Greg.
He sighed, pulled on his coat, and stole Sherlock's gloves to combat the icy chill before leaving without another word. There wasn't any point to speaking at the moment, and he could only hope this was over by Christmas.
"You said you couldn't dance."
"Whatever possessed you to get a room with a single bed, John?"
A glass of water was pressed into his hand, and he drank it without question without even opening his eyes. When the glass was refilled and two tablets pressed into his hand, he once again obeyed the unspoken commands without argument or question, and eventually his doctor shut the curtains and blocked out the sunlight
"I sit like this... so that one day... I might see something outside... something good... something that makes me smile... something only the sunlight shows... something I can remember instead of heat... and sand... and pain..."
John's hands wandered swiftly while his partners' attentions were diverted and swiped a hand over Sherlock's weeping head, drawing a strangled cry and John watched the worlds only consulting detective begin to loose his control right in front of his eyes.
"You're the one being ridiculous!"
Sherlock's commentary on the arrangement of the band continued, but John simply laughed, stopping rapidly when he felt Sherlock tense "only you would know that much about the perfect composition for a band, no one else even noticed."
"Sherlock..." John muttered, as he spotted the shop assistant on his way back, "I can't dance."
Oh shut up John.
"Ready?" Sherlock whispered his lips pressed to a soft mouth, his body pulled against the strong man that made him happy, and John smiled.
Sherlock scowled, and didn't answer, settling for a brief brush of lips and a soft "You look amazing", before the waiting taxi hit his horn and summoned them swiftly out of the flat and on their way.
He shifted, wincing, and felt his lips part to speak, not 100% sure what he wanted to say, when John growled at him from the other side of the cab. The Doctor's eyes were closed and his face was turned to face the opposite window, but somehow he knew exactly what Sherlock was about to do.
There was the warm musky smell John always gave off, but there was something else, something he'd never noticed before his long absence; the scent of warmth and wool and soft comfort. Sherlock moaned and pressed himself tighter against his partners' strong frame, soaking up the warmth and softness that radiated from the Doctor.
If he hadn't been so tired, John would have found the look of shock of his partner's face hilarious, as it was he simply curled into his chair, and sipped his tea.
In the last week and a half, John thought he'd probably managed to sleep five nights, and had run the rest of the time off cat naps and caffeine. So when they'd finally returned to the freezing cold flat, Sherlock sulking after being manhandled at the hospital, and John with a blinding headache from the strain on his body and the hospitals' fluorescent lights, he had been less than amused when he returned to the living room with tea to find Sherlock on his phone, actually talking to someone.
Only Sherlock's hands on his hips, pressing him into the wood of the door, kept him upright as that talented tongue swirled around him, focussing John's attention onto a single point on his body; his breathing ragged, his hands clenching and his vision fading out.
John sighed. He'd never hear the end of this, from either of them, no matter which of them he sided with. On the other hand, Sherlock could make his life infinity more difficult than Mrs Hudson... of course; their landlady could always evict them. Decisions, decisions...
"It was very hot though Sherlock" he whispered, "If you wanted to keep that in mind for when we get home, I promise to be surprised."
John didn't say another word, didn't dare breath, but he felt the atmosphere relax. He'd actually won, although he wasn't convinced it was going to be worth the sulking he'd have to put up with for the rest of the month.
My gun?
It took John a long time to work this out, because sometimes, when Sherlock seemed to be in that condition, he was partially still in the room, and then your chance at throwing a single question at him failed.
John smothered a smile and hid his head in the fridge as Sherlock scowled, then glared at John, but he moved fluidly to select one of the ripe fruits and bite into it.
"Don't you dare say another word, the last time you spoke the whole situation got worse" Sherlock snarled, and John started paying attention, taking in the situation. Sherlock had been in a surprisingly good mood all morning, had even behaved in a cordial manner towards his brother, the sudden shift to sharply aggressive wasn't right. It usually took a slow build up before Sherlock would snap back into 'I'm a sociopath, and you don't deserve to share the same air as me'.
At the moment though, the consulting detective was more interested in the gasps coming from the mouth beneath his as their tongues tangled in a dance, short sharp nips and rough lapping kept the doctor compliant under Sherlocks' control and a softly growled "
Dan practically wilted once his father had left and apologised almost continuously as he set the two men up with their guns, and wished them luck, swiftly adding that he didn't think they'd need it when he caught sight of Sherlock's black glare.
"Why not!"
"What are you doing Anderson?"
Sherlock bit hard on John's neck lapping at it tenderly once he'd drawn a sharp gasp and bucking hips from his lover.
"Well?"
It took less than five minutes once they'd left Angelo's and got into a taxi, for Sherlock to realise that they weren't going home, but no matter how much he badgered, and wheedled John, the ex-service man wouldn't crack.
The doctor cleared his throat and returned his gaze to the consulting detective, who looked totally lost and completely alone, adrift in the middle of 221B's living room and it took everything in the doctor's willpower not to cradle the tall man to him and whisper sweet, comforting nothings.
As the ballet began reaching its grand finale, John had half expected some form of scoffing at the climax of the performance as the male adaptation of Odette and Prince Siegfried threw themselves into the depths of the lake to stay together forever. He'd expected some mention of how foolish it was, or how dull, or the pure folly of the action.
"I reserved a table for two, under the name Holmes" John's soft voice drew Sherlock's gaze back to his lovers face and he frowned.
A small envelope landed on the desk by the small packet from the doctor's hand, and all Dimmock could do was stare in surprise.
"This?"
John found he didn't have a valid argument for that, and proceeded to follow Sherlock's example and celebrate the season in a very traditional way, like turtle doves. After all, they really were made for each other.
A small pocket magnifying glass, very much like Sherlock's, was sitting on his desk, along with a gift tag.
He beamed, thanked her, kissed her on the cheek and went to grab his coat. John knew exactly where he was going, because if someone was going to try a food for the first time, then you wanted the best quality available to you. Mrs Hudson watched him go and smiled before going to text Mycroft. It seemed the good doctor was taking the poem quite seriously.
"Yesterday lunch time"
With a small contented smile at Sherlock's stunned expression that was slowly turning furious, John sighed, and pressed his face into Sherlock's shoulder gently.
Sherlock flushed once at the compliment, and once again before ducking his head at his lover's reference to his three day stint of violin playing. He finished tying his scarf round his neck and moved to stand in front of the seated half-sleeping John and gently replacing the tea mug with a soft kiss
As John stood, waiting for the lift, he swept his eyes over the office; most of them didn't have enough of their brains working to understand, even if he was willing to explain the unique symbiosis he shared with Sherlock... and those who would understand didn't care to listen. The lift arrived, blissfully empty, and he stepped inside, pressing the button for Lestrades' department, and relaxing against the far wall as the door slide closed, hiding him from prying eyes.
He was scanning through various case files for much longer than he'd planned to leave Sherlock alone for, and was starting to worry about what, exactly, he'd be returning home to when some details he's just skipped past caught his eye.
"You think I don't know you can forge his signature-"
Sherlock was silent for a moment, studying John intently "You're staying?"
John frowned, his humour fading "You mean, it
" dragged an interesting shudder from the smaller man that Sherlock filed away to explore at a later date.
He spotted Sherlock tense out of the corner of his eye, but the man covered it quickly, even as John's chest filled with guilt. He wasn't entirely comfortable with public displays of affection, but he knew that Sherlock liked to show him off. He sometimes thought it had something to do with proving that someone could do more than tolerate him, someone did indeed love him with all his eccentricities and quirks, and not despite them.
, Sherlock thought,
He was just lucky Sherlock hadn't said soup.
"I'm trying to see how long it takes cat guts to rot in a Neutral pH solution..."
John does, he knows very well. He also knows that Sherlock's never tried egg in his life. He also realises that the reason Sherlock has scrambled egg on his plate is because he's given the consulting detective his plate.
"Right now, tonight, I simply want to be with you, to rest with you" John spotted the exact moment his partner melted, and was prepared for the deep yet unutterably tender kiss the man pressed to him and John would have felt guilty at the manipulation if it hadn't bee one hundred percent accurate.
The start of the sentence was cut short with a sharp gasp, and fingers clutched at the detective's bare shoulders when John felt teeth pressing tightly against his neck, and he bit his lips against another groan.
The consulting detective paused, and almost seemed to struggle with himself before frowning "Is this... a date?"
John knew, and he knew that John knew. It didn't need saying...
imagine it, but he didn't. It would be a recipe for disaster.
"You won't shoot" he drawled, his deep voice sounding ridiculously loud in the small room, but he caught John's shoulders shift from 'tensed' to "calm" and a part of his brain mentally sighed. John trusted him far too much.
When John's hands came up to tangle in long black curls, Sherlock smirked at the gasp he heard from somewhere to his right. Maybe she'd thought John would punch him, or at least back away horrified, but to watch her work colleague not only give in and surrender to Sherlock, but to actively partake, Sarah was shocked. It was all in that single gasp.
"It's no good, we'll have to wait it out, there's not another safe route round this pandemonium what with all the ice."
"Don't argue with me John, you know I'm always right."
The doctor bit his lip as he studied the mounting irritation on Sherlock's face. Donovan was sighing audibly, and Anderson was beginning to look smug, and John knew, from experience, that it wouldn't be long before the snide remarks started
It's the middle of the night; don't hangovers usually occur the following morning?
The shadows of their booth had hidden where their hands had been roaming, but Sherlock's breath was stolen at the hint of tongue escaping the cage of lips, and the expressions of pleasure plastered on their faces.
Deciding swiftly to get Sherlock's out of the way, she pulled the gift towards her and began ripping the paper away hazardously. She nearly dropped it when she realised exactly what Sherlock had sent her.
Shoe cupboard? Hollow heels, possibly, but it would be rather obvious to his partner. Under the bathroom sink? Maybe, but the police were checking there now, and since it was a popular hiding place for drugs, he didn't think they'd skip it. Hollow walls? No, there was only one wall in the whole flat that could have been worked on for that, and they'd already questioned the neighbours about any loud noises coming from the flat, their answers being negative.
need to go?"
Superstition had saved the serial killer thus far, but John wasn't a very superstitious person. He pulled his hands from his jacket and spun the large mirror in its stand so the back was showing and frowned at the small catches holding the wooden back in place. They were very tight.
"So, why do
"I didn't say I paid attention to my deductions" Sherlock admitted reluctantly after a tense silence, and he bit his lip.
"It seemed the best way to annoy him... at the time... you mean... you didn't know? Nothing's been... said... to you?"
No matter how many curses and server failures it took.
in her presence.
The outer door slammed downstairs and John frowned. Sherlock never slammed doors;
"Fine then, three a piece... Most are lucky if they leave with one, so there's no danger you'll both hit three"
When John could finally see straight again, they were still in the same positions; Sherlock pinning him to the door, John holding himself upright on his lovers shoulders, and Sherlock beaming at him like a contented cat, and John had to huff a laugh before loosening his grip and leaning down to thoroughly kiss the other man senseless. He was the one who felt boneless after all.
It doesn't matter
Mycroft knew, after all, what John's Christmas present to Sherlock was, and it seemed strange to John that a parade was blocking their way home, a parade that happened to have exactly eleven drummers in it's band.
John let a small smile slip over his face as he tied the second bird to the tree "more festive than anything else in the room Sherlock.
: JOHN
Don't bother.
"Say's he's a plumber, but it doesn't seem... right?"
There was every float imaginable, beautiful Christmas scenes, some amusing tableau's, some of them had singers, that made Sherlock shudder and John laugh at his partners reactions, and there were even one or two floats depicting traditional scenes of Yuletide celebrations.
Get it yourself; I'm at the doctor's convention in Essex
Hmm, Mrs Hudson's getting it. What's the hotel like?
Two snails and one legend.
"You could have died" The questioning tone was vanishing, underneath a harder anger that needed to be vented somewhere, somehow, preferably at someone.
"Did she escape?..."
"We need to get home swiftly, John, and there's not going to be any taxi's running in this weather; none of the roads have been gritted properly."
John raised his eyes from his book, a small affectionate smile on his face as he watched Sherlock pace round the room in long strides as the taller man shifted through papers and books. John didn't know how he kept track of everything he needed, but Sherlock never seemed to have any trouble.
"How was the Yard, Sherlock?"
"Sorry"
"No, John, I meant the wind suddenly changing directions... of course I meant Mr Peterson"
"You know what my job entails..."
Certainly, I'll fuck you up after my shower
"What-" Sherlock paused to cough, wincing as the bruised muscles in his chest pulled tight, "What happened?" and just like that, John's fury returned like a forest fire, burning away his relief and happiness and affection at the bemusement on his flatmate's angular features
Sherlock pressed a soft kiss to Johns waiting lips before pulling back briefly "Guy Fawkes Night display, while greatly appreciated, wasn't necessary John" he whispered, unwilling to shatter the moment by speaking any louder, or letting his deep voice travel any further than his partners ears, "
It took moments for Sherlock to skid to a stop next to his lover, but his mood wasn't improved by the closeness of everyone else and his scowl deepened
He closed the book with shaking hands and reverently placed it on the coffee table before turning on John, hands to his lovers' face he pulled him into a kiss to rival the photograph on page twelve, and ravished the doctor till they were both gasping for air, and Sherlock was practically lying on top of the man.
"That's what it's become, not what it is!"
As he moved away from the speechless woman, his phone beeped and he drew it from his pocked as he weaved his way across the crime scene.
"You don't need me, and I got the file to keep you occupied Sherlock... You go and be brilliant, and I'm going to use the short time it will take you to solve the case to catch up on the sleep you've deprived me of"
I lobe...
"Well get into bed then."
"Sarah wants you in for some night work tonight, they've got a small flu outbreak, and I said it'd be fine."
"If she doesn't like your humour, or spots those army tattoos, I don't care... you're not here for them, you've come for me, and I know that..." he bit John's ear softly, careful not to mark it, and felt his lovers breath catch, and strong hands twitch as John fought to keep them from twining into Sherlock's hair.
"Well, Dan had a brother, a twin brother, also in the forces, and also in our squad... they were pretty close too, they could practically communicate without words, they were the perfect scouts..."
The two boxes were delivered by private courier. Or so the delivery man said, but Anderson could see no insignia on the mans uniform, and the black car parked outside his home looked more than a little suspicious.
As his opposite, John only seemed to eat out when they had a case on and he couldn't drag Sherlock back to the flat, so for the good doctor to arrange an evening out, a
Yes you are. You can't honestly be stubborn enough to wank all the way home.
John grinned, and shook his head, flicking his fingers over the phone as he tapped out a reply.
Sherlock almost looked like an abandoned puppy, and for a moment John felt guilty, but he was falling asleep where he was sitting
The silence was like particularly sharp shards of glass and Sherlock actually hesitated before answering.
What for?
"I'm bored, not hungry, and I don't find that eating alleviates the boredom enough to condone it as an appropriate solution"
With a sigh, the doctor merely shook his head, grinning, as he traded his coffee for one of the tickets. The grin turned into a full blown beaming smile at the glow Sherlock's eyes suddenly obtain and he relaxed knowing he'd made the right choice for the evening.
"I'm beyond fucking tired! I'm exhausted, I'm ready to drop where I'm standing, I haven't slept properly in a week and a half, you nearly got shot, and then some
John levelled a stare at him that had Sherlock swallowing a single mouthful of chicken salad before the army doctor nodded in concession and stood, leaving money for their meal on the table.
Of course, can't sleep?
"What is what, Sherlock?"
I'm sure I can accommodate you
"I'm yours, Sherlock" John promised, whispered, once he'd smoothed the wound with his tongue, "and you're mine".
China! Harry, he meant China, it's the IPhone auto correct...
Sherlock suppressed the shiver that the warm words against his ear elicited and stumbled over his response
"Well, thank you Mycroft... It's uh, a lovely party."
Maybe Sherlock had infected his laptop with some kind of virus to win this battle of wills...
"Not tonight, I'm tired"
"Fine..." he grumbled after a moment, and a couple more slow kisses, "Now go and get that shower, you absolutely stink"
What?
"No Sherlock! Christmas is important"
"Oh no! You didn't fork out a small fortune on this suit so that we'd stay in and it never got used" John smirked, feeling more comfortable with the heated gaze of his lover on him than he had all day, his nerves over Mycroft's Christmas dinner party had vanished and he merely grinned at his lover.
"Where the hells is the milk, Sherlock!"
When Sherlock was in the middle of a case and deep in thought about something, when his mind was miles away and not one ounce of his attention was focussed on you, it was in those moments you could ask him a question and get a simple, straight, truthful answer.
"You must be Sherlock!"
"What the hells did you think you were doing?" John almost whispered, putting the spoon on the counter, the tea's only half made, but already forgotten and Sherlock saw that the Doctor's hands were shaking.
"Hmm? Oh, you mean Mr Peterson?"
Time seemed to slow as Sherlock's strangled voice stretched across the room to John's ears and Sherlock watched the Doctors eyes widen and turn to face him as he stood from his chair. It seemed as though each action took a millennium, so Sherlock did what consulting detectives do best; He saw.
Sherlock's frame was still trembling, even as he clung to John like a lifeline, soaking up the warmth of skin against skin. John was silent, and Sherlock pushed his face into the Doctor's chest like a child seeking comfort, so that's what John gave, despite certain parts of his body intensely interested in the fact that Sherlock was pressed against him completely naked, making John's pyjamas tighter than they should be.
John laughed softly, his head thrown back in true amusement and Sherlock couldn't draw his eyes away from the expanse of neck bare to him until John calmed, and re-caught wandering eyes with his own twinkling blue.
"Do you really want an answer to that?" the detective scoffed, and he saw John's eyes darken with anger, and paced towards the man. Kissing him hard, pushing him into the sofa, straddling his lap before John could fight back... there was nothing tender in their motions, every action a battle for dominance.
"Wha... What?" Sherlock managed to squeak as John snatched the book he'd been reading from the detectives' hands, marking the page and dropping it unceremoniously on the coffee table.
Sherlock scowled, pouted and flopped onto the sofa "It had it coming"
"Well, I was the medic for my squad... There's only one medic in a squad, and we were under fire one day, we were most days as you could probably guess..."
Something about John was different. It had always been different, from the moment he'd walked into the lab at Bart's. From the moment he'd listened to Sherlock's deductions with amazement, how he'd asked about the method behind the madness. How he'd not corrected Sherlock on his mistake until the consulting detective had asked him.
Sherlock, where are you? I thought you were going to tidy this living room?
"Don't get snarky with me young man! Permission to shoot the walls is not in your tenancy agreement, and I could evict you for the amount of damage you do to the place!"
The detective didn't need to be told twice and laid back on the sofa again, pulling John down with him to the army doctor was laying on him and he could feel the mans arousal pressing into his stomach. Sherlock busied his mouth with placing a love bite high enough on the doctors' neck that the man wouldn't be able to hide it while he waited impatiently for the feel of the lube, his nerves impatiently waiting.
The doctor swallowed, a thin trickle escaping down his chin, that he wiped off slowly as he sat up, knowing Sherlock was watching him. He smirked up at his lover, and Sherlock grinned back, dragging John back onto the sofa to straddle his hips as they reignited their kisses. He could taste himself in the doctor's mouth and he groaned, while John shuddered once again as his now hard cock pressed against the detective's stomach. Their hands continued to roam, nipping at each others bodies, and dragging nails across pale skin, like marking territory.
"Plumber"
"I love you" he whispered, his voice a low purr, and John could feel his hands begin to tremble. Sherlocks mouth brushed his ear as he spoke, and John's eyes fluttered closed as he focussed on the voice in his ear, whispering precious words that would get him through the evening.
I hadn't finished with the body
Sherlock, I thought you said you were married to your work?
A few hours later, Sherlock agreed. The tree could stay.
"You're not coming?"
Why did Mycroft buy me one of these useless phone's again? On my way.
, Sherlock?"
Dimmock flipped the card over the find only a short sentence in the doctor's hand writing, "Just in case you ever need his help."
"You sure you're safe with a weapon after that injury you got?"
Sherlock smirked.
You what?
"John..."
"Yes" he responded slowly, still frowning "But it's going to be later, it should be ready in about ten minutes, but in actuality it won't be for another half an hour or so... the recipes were inaccurate."
"Not particularly, but it is polite when we said we would be there for one"
No, lunch break, what's up?
You're laughing and passing these texts round the office aren't you...
you?"
"I'm sorry," Sherlock muttered again, clearly not enjoying having to repeat himself.
"Have fun running interview's, Sherlock?"
Long fingers pushed open the door that hadn't been closed properly, and he stood in John's bedroom doorway, completely lost. As Sherlock stared at the still form of his flatmate, he wanted to crawl over to the man, curl around him, soak in his warmth and his smell and cry like he hadn't since he was a very small child. It took him longer than it should have to realise that John's eyes were open, watching him, and suddenly he couldn't move, couldn't breath. He wanted to run, afraid of whatever judgement he's find in that steady blue gaze, but he didn't.
""We're out of milk John"
"I don't need to set a limit, no
"It's ok, it's fine, we belong together, and we both know that, so what does it matter...?"
Sherlock should know by now. It wasn't brain surgery or rocket science that he found John attractive, that was, after all, the reason they'd progressed relationship from "flatmates" to … well more.
Sherlock made no sound, so John kissed him, a soft sigh, but no other reaction. John grinned, and began trailing his way down the familiar body, mouthing at Sherlock's bulging cock before slowly easing the clothes from the thin body beneath him.
"You got me a song book?"
like eggs"
"Dan, this is Sherlock Holmes... my partner"
It's a good thing I know you mean pork. Christ I'm glad no one else reads these texts.
Sherlock's eyes had already moved across the room before he'd finished his question and was taking in the two perfectly placed gunshot wounds in the chest and head on Sharon Swann, before those grey eyes returned to John's furious face
Um...
It was a rare event that Sherlock wasn't peppering him with questions, so John made the most of the surprise Sherlock was letting him give and sent him to grab two coffees while he went to get their tickets.
When the man, Sherlock had borrowed to send his Christmas presents, returned to Mycroft's office, he carried one more, large box and placed it on Mycroft's desk with a soft "sir".
John blinked. How had he worked out John's plans from staring at the Christmas tree?
Sherlock kept up a continuous stream of information on the origins and plans that went into each float, and John was grinning and more than once telling his lover just how amazing his deductions were. Every compliment was followed up by that semi-surprised and partially disbelieving pause that John relished and hated, and neither of them could feel the cold seeping into their bodies as they stood wrapped in each other.
Chinese?
"You didn't want my mouth shut last weekend..."
"Oh you
The consulting detective stood in the middle of the living room as though he didn't quite know where he was, the painful colouring on his chest looked like a small child had been set loose with a pot of paints, and the ripped, ragged mess John had made of Sherlock's silk shirt was
do you think happened?" John growled, almost enjoying the shock that filtered through the detective's eyes "She shot you, you complete idiot!"
"John! Christ man, you're looking well!"
"John?"
With a firm hand on the glass front of the mirror, John used a short nail to slide the clips over the wood and loosen the back of the mirror, prising it off carefully, and turning, only to find Sherlock already at his shoulder.
Yes, he'd protect that man to the ends of the earth; the only person allowed to kill Sherlock Holmes was him.
It took an embarrassingly long moment for Sherlock to connect "Peterson's Fowl Farm" to John's comment of "shooting something useful".
"Wouldn't be much of a surprise if I told you would it... here's your coat"
There was practically nothing a hospital could do for the severe bruising caused by the impact of the bullet, so once they'd gotten seated in the taxi, John gave the address for Baker Street and that's where they were going now. John still furious, with his heavy glare focussed out of the car window and Sherlock desperately trying to make sense of where everything went wrong, and what he could bribe Mycroft with to help get John out of suspicion with the Met. His brain was also considering, how it could have simultaneously gone so very right. John's strong hands round his waist, and the gentle surety they showed in helping his battered body get into the Taxi... well, the thought still had the ability to quicken his breathing, and Sherlock shivered in part apprehension and part cold as the chill air in the taxi, leaked through the rips in his shirt.
Sliding the lid off slowly, his was truly shocked to see an exquisitely cut suit lying in swathes of tissues paper. He recognised the work of the Holmes family tailor, so Mycroft knew it would fit, but he rarely purchased himself suits for work in a material of this quality. He could afford them, certainly, but that often took the pleasure away from wearing them. Wearing
"Yes, John, it is."
"Sherlock-"
He glanced at the clock, half hidden by the skull, as he removed his coat and smiled. That gave Sherlock less than three hours to get home, and look like he'd never moved form the sofa. At a guess, he'd be back in half that time so John put the kettle on and went and found a book while he waited for it to boil.
"I intend to Ariadne, Sherlock insisted on introducing us before we began the evening properly though."
There was a beat of silence again as John turned to face Sherlock after he'd finished tying a small feathered bird shaped decoration to the tree.
*live
"So, they were both hit, but I could see from where I was the Charles was already a dead man, there was nothing I could do for him... Like I was trained to, I moved onto someone I could save, which happened to be Dan"
"Absolutely not!"
"How did you know?" Sherlock murmured curiously, eyeing John with intrigue, but John merely laughed and shook his head.
"All right, come with me"
Today however, as he walked through the door with the weeks shopping, he had the added help in making this deduction of Mrs Hudson's dulcet tones as she scolded Sherlock.
"Christ-!" John's fingers clenched around Sherlock's hips, but the detective kept the small space between them, tormenting his lover, and himself.
When whoever the doctor had called answered, an easy grin flashed across the mans features, and John wasn't sure whether he was pleased or disturbed that this fact caused Sherlock's hands to tighten on the still loaded gun
!" John hissed, suddenly furious at his utterly selfish flatmate, "I slept more than this in Afghanistan!"
"It's not like you have a case," John huffed as they continued through the ridiculously busy London streets "Why are we hurrying?"
Sleeping on your crotch in your room tonight, experiment
"If I'm recognised by any of the police officers here John-"
Something imperceptible shifted in John's face and Sherlock swallowed.
"I thought you were exaggerating the issue... Well, the solution is simple; we'll simply buy double the milk, and label one bottle as yours"
Are you available for "a call" tonight?
"Let's stay home..."
"Oh don't worry Sherlock, I'm photocopying them, and placing them in a number of safety deposit boxes... just in case they get pick pocketed from my desk draw."
"Charles... We were under fire, and both of them were hit..."
"Is that our milk?"
Sherlock was still at Scotland Yard when John got back from the local French farmers market with half a dozen freshly laid eggs. Yes, they cost a small fortune, and yes it was going to be worth every penny when he told Sherlock what exactly went into eggnog. The only other thing the doctor had needed to pick up was a small bottle of rum, and he swiftly set about cooking so that by the time his partner actually arrived home, there would be no evidence of egg anywhere. John laughed to himself softly. He'd invite Mrs Hudson up for a small Christmas drink too, that would make three after all, and fulfil the 3 French hens line of the poem.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock growled after John, but his expression softened at the delighted laugh the other man returned as he beckoned Sherlock over with an easy grin.
"Mother wants to meet you."
"Yeah, weird bloke too, had an umbrella, although he needed it with his problems, and some snotty assistant who wouldn't speak a word, or offer a hard workin' bloke a coffee!"
Nothing, just bored, just leaving my life
Sherlock slid down to the floor, pulling trousers and pants with him and kneeling lightly before John, grinning at the clenched hands that were pressed against the door in a bid, he knew, not to grip long curly locks of dark hair, and the doctor's muscles had gained a fine tremor of anticipation that Sherlock took a moment to relish in.
He wouldn't refuse the detective outright, the one time he had had been an absolute nightmare, but his lover needed sleep more than this,
Soft lips brushed his own, and warm air ghosted over his face. He was surprised, he'd not heard Sherlock move, but when his hands were untied, there was no hesitation in standing, instinctively finding the mans hips and guiding him back onto the soft bed John had just vacated.
Has a bunch of dead people so it should be pretty quiet.
A perfect way to end Christmas Eve.
"I've got a, uh, another gift for you Sherlock... one I didn't want to give you while Harry was still here" the doctor said softly, drawing Sherlock's gaze from the view at the bottom of his new microscope, and onto John's face.
Dan fell silent, and Sherlock noticed John tensing again, so he did what he did best when faced with anyone John knew and he didn't. In an attempt not to embarrass his partner, he simply scowled.
John kissed the man, who responded as well as he could still stuck beneath the covers, and when John felt Sherlock twitch trying to escape the fabric and groan in frustration, he pulled back laughing a little.
Many people in Beresford Road hear the shrieks of Mrs Anderson that night, and the promises Mr Anderson made to her.
That was it, and John sighed. Sherlock said he hadn't needed him for this case, it was simple. Well if it was so simple, John found he kept wishing Sherlock would solve it and get things over and done with. As much as he didn't want to admit it, he missed the taller man's non-stop chattering and even the explosions in the kitchen, or surprising new body parts in the freezer.
The flat was silent when John got home, and he immediately began worrying. Moving slowly up the stairs, the tension in his body mounted as he advanced.
John was on the eighth step now and Sherlock's mind was working overtime on the issue, feeling the thrill of the time between this moment and when John would step through the door. His flatmate had been at Scotland Yard, helping Lestrade by providing a statement. Lestrade wouldn't have infuriated John to this degree; in fact the only people Sherlock knew who were this irritating were Donovan and Ander- ah...
Sorry *Unwanted
"I have two tickets reserved for the ballet being held in the main hall this evening"
"All right then, we'll see you this afternoon, my best to your dad?"
"I'm back, Harry's with me..."
"But when the sunlight hits my face I see light glinting off guns, and I can smell blood and fear. I know it's in the past, but it makes me stop, and think, and sometimes doubt..."
"I've been having my surveillance team take some appropriate photographs John, if you'd like copies for some kind of ... memento?"
"Got the point of this little sleepover then?"
I want to cook dinner, and I need to know what time to start
"..."
Sherlock huffed, and shut the door behind him to keep the warmth in the room, leaving his own coat on. It had clearly cooled off quickly since John had walked home.
John thanked her and began following her inside when he noticed Sherlock wasn't with him and turned to find the man still standing in the doorway with wide eyes.
Every evening since their shopping trip John had been going out, and not returning for around four hours, usually sweating, and sometimes out of breath. If Sherlock hadn't known better, he'd have thought the doctor was cheating on him, but the evidence was inconclusive. John knew how observant Sherlock was, there was no way he'd be able to hide that from the consulting detective.
"Sherlock, do you trust me?
"Yes! Long time no see; I didn't know you were...?"
"That was the idea; we haven't been on a date since we started this strange relationship of ours...
Yes, if Sherlock thinks of anything I'll let you know, just give me some warning before the drugs bust to hide my gun? Sorry about the delay in replying, Greg, I fell asleep yesterday and by the time I woke it was too late to text you back. Couldn't get back to sleep till 6am, so I waited till now... At least I got some rear at last though
"You told me you were tired, so this is what I prescribe – sleep!"
He stared at them both and Mrs Hudson moved carefully to the kitchen and the consulting detectives eyes narrowed at them both
"What?"
"It's a customised photo album" John watched Sherlock's eyes narrow, as he became suspicious and began deducing, and the doctor simply smirked, "Stop working it out, and open it".
He was almost done. The tinsel was hanging around the room, and there were fairy lights in the two large windows of 221b Baker street.
He could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, before they flicked to Mycroft who was purposefully staring at the cane in his hand. It took moments for the consulting detective to bend his mind to the problem, and Ariadne winked at John while her younger son was distracted.
John, we need unwanted butter.
They were led through the huge house in silence, and left outside what John could only assume was the dining room, but as the Butler left, Sherlock halted his movement towards the door, crowding his against the nearby wall.
Raking a hand through his hair, John sighed again and added milk to the now stewed tea, picking up his own and leaving Sherlock's on the kitchen counter. "Right then..."
John sat in front of his laptop, staring at his blog. He'd written up the case for Sherlock, as he always did, but hadn't found a title yet. Then he suddenly remembered Mycroft's text at the beginning of the week and the poem he was trying to complete for Sherlock by Christmas day, and grinned, shaking his head softly and setting fingers to keys.
"You're shattered; it's obvious, so you're going to bed, and to sleep."
"Milk?"
John frowned, but nodded. This was starting to sound like something he would expect back at home after one of Sherlock's experiments, but he didn't interrupt the man.
"I warned you I was jealous..."
"You're hopeless Sherlock, if you'd merely been paying attention you'd have more than likely worked it out by now" John laughed, his face flushed from Sherlock's ministrations, and a small bruise starting to stain his neck, causing the detective to smirk satisfied.
"..."
It was 11.30pm...
"The powdered milk was so that when you used the normal milk I'd have something to put in tea"
The location had obviously been something else prearranged, and Sherlock was beginning to wonder how John had managed to pull this off without him noticing anything. He suddenly realised the taxi was silent, and turned his head to where he knew the Doctor would be sitting
"But what-"
Sherlock glared and John chuckled.
"No, this is" the doctor handed over what looked like a folder for a case file and Lestrade became wary again.
"Mycroft flicked a glance at his brother and must have seen far more than John could for the moment because he frowned, which seemed to John to be the most expression the doctor had ever seen on the face of the politician.
"Five years old"
"Sherlock!"
"After the last time we had to stop and go looking for it at a point like this" John lent down and snagged the bottle he'd put there a week previous, and sat back up with a grin "Now, shut up Sherlock, and lay down."
"I don't care, Sherlock, I'm not sending this report to the MD, until I get a professionals opinion-"
She nearly threw them across the room, but refrained when she realised she'd have to clean to goop up, and had to satisfy herself with simply dumping them in the bin and hoping her dustmen wouldn't ask too many questions.
Leaving his partner to gape stunned at his retreating form, John made his way calmly, smugly, to his bedroom, oblivious to a sulking consulting detective checking the sent folder on his phone.
That is until Sherlock stretched out his long legs and sighed "I still think you should invite Harry over for Christmas"
The consulting detective should have known by now that John wouldn't ridicule his skills, or think them strange, and he felt a small amused smile sneak it's way onto his face as his shoulders relaxed and he registered that John's first reaction was, of course, to think how he could use this information to surprise the detective more often.
It was a bad joke, they didn't get on, it wasn't true, and it took till the early hours of Christmas morning before Mrs Anderson unlocked the front door and let her husband back inside again, but the doubt had been planted, and she would watch.
"You went to see Lestrade?"
"I am not more important than you!" Sherlock all but snarled, his body tensing and silencing the Doctor, "Don't you see, John? I don't know how to do... this... without you any more"
The sound of flies unzipping ripped through the air and had John gasping, and his dark blue eyes snapping open (when had they shut?) to stare at the enthralled detective before him.
John didn't need to be told twice, and stripped his jeans and jumper, before swiftly sliding between the covers and tangling legs with Sherlock, their lips crashing together like magnets and drawing soft sighs, and indecent groans from the both of them
His words were sharply cut off with a firm kiss. It wasn't tender, or gentle, it was firm and possessive and Sherlock nipped at John's lips until he let him in with a gasp and a sharp groan. Sherlock felt the soft brush of eyelashes as John surrendered to him, letting him have his way, and stake his claim. The Doctor understood, he knew, and Sherlock wasn't sure if that embarrassed him or made him want the man all the more.
It was the night of Mycroft's dinner party, and he was going to be introduced to Mrs Holmes as Sherlock's partner. He hadn't dared to ask Sherlock how many people were going to be there, especially not after his show of possessive dominance a few days previous.
"What's this?"
want to know"
"Right" John took his own seat and relaxed back into the sofa cushion, shutting his eyes and cradling the mug in his hands a he relaxed slowly with a sigh, occasionally bringing the cradled mug to his mouth for a slow sip of the warming drink.
"Not unless Sherlock hasn't told me something" John reassured her gently, and the old woman grinned as he continued, "No, we've just been out delivering presents and it's freezing out there, we've just got back but wanted to give you yours..."
John, stop laughing!
John. I'm bored
I'm at work, on my lunch break.
"But you drown out everything, Sherlock... You're so... I don't even have words for it, you make me feel whole, and normal, and accepted" Even through his haze, Sherlock could feel, sense, know that John was smiling. The soft, hardly there smile he saved Just for them, and he began to feel a tight heat coiling inside him at the memory of that smile entered his brain, that smile; small, barely there, but Sherlock could feel it like a lightening bolt when his lips were pressed against John's, his tongue tracing it's shape as it probed for entry...
"Name?"
"That's just what he's like, Harry, it's nothing personal..."
"His mother always reminds me of Harry, Mum was sort of relieved when she realised Harry wouldn't have kids..." John murmured, mostly to himself as the Queen brushed off her son's attentions, and scolded him.
The man in question was so surprised by the Doctor's entrance that he promptly toppled off the chair he'd been standing on in the middle of the living room and managed to let himself fall onto the soft sofa
"Holmes?"
Their hands twined on the table briefly, before they returned to their calm conversations and for once a meal Sherlock was enjoying.
"If you answered my questions like that normally, I wouldn't feel the need, Sherlock" John responded, standing and moving to the kitchen to make tea. He could hear Sherlock grumbling in the living room, complaining that his thought process had been interrupted, but he knew that John was right. After all, his lover didn't throw random questions at him very often.
It took very little time for Sherlock to be divested on his shirt, and John's jumper swiftly followed, neither of them keeping track of exactly where their clothing landed.
"Not tonight, Sherlock-"
"Sherlock?"
Ah. You know what you need?
"Because it was none of Mycroft's business" he muttered, his voice silky smooth once again, "It should have been my decision, our choice... not HIS".
Paracetamol and water then
Sherlock's gaze swept over John's new clothes and his sharp eyes narrowed at the leather trousers John had gotten from Harry for his birthday nearly half a year earlier, and the dark blue button shirt that matched his eyes. John was beginning to feel uncomfortable under his lovers intense stare as the detective eyed up the long military style coat had managed to pick up cheaply.
"What's going on?" John asked softly as he reached them, his hands in his pockets, and his face carefully neutral as Lestrade turned to him like a starving man might turn on an all-you-can-eat buffet and Sherlock threw his hands in the air, his posture portraying pure irritation.
It had been fashioned into a crude looking noose and Sherlock glanced at it from his sprawled position on the sofa "Oh relax! It's just an experiment, and perfectly safe now you're back, if you'd just..."
"Nooo!" he whined, trying to grab it back, only to be neatly side-stepped.
Sherlock looked as smooth as ever, in one of his sharply cut suits, but for once in the taxi, his entire focus was on John, and the doctor smiled before moving his eyes from the back of the cabbies head to meet Sherlock's eyes.
He let the man rest and kept another close watch on the cab's charge until they pulled into Baker Street. Sherlock woke on his own, and slid out of the car ahead of John, opening the door to their flat silently, and they both crept up the stairs to avoid waking Mrs Hudson with their late entrance.
"Wife was murdered in their home, in the living room..."
The front door shut behind John and Sherlock leapt into action. Contrary to popular belief Sherlock could cook when he wanted to. It was just like any other science experiment after all. What prevented him from cooking well, and produced black sausages, mush instead of beans on toasts, and convinced the man that's the way it should be, was nothing more than boredom, lack of experience because everyone knows that food at home is completely different from food when eating out, and a perchance to want to experiment with the cooking process.
Sherlock's lips twitched, and John's eyes narrowed playfully.
"No."
Sherlock, where are you? I've got a case for you
As soon as John groaned, and surrendered, letting his hands slide up Sherlock's body instead of gripping, the consulting detective let John's hair slide through his fingers, and he delved into his lovers trousers, finding the man already hard.
"Thank you John, please continue"
"This looks like a sodium burn, I'm going to have to brush your skin to make sure there's no residue left. You were explaining how you got this burn?"
With a tired groan, and the horrible feeling he was going to end up with another splitting headache, Dr Watson sat at the computer and waited for it to boot up. The things he did for his lover, honestly.
it only took him moments to realise that Sherlock was matching his breathing, and he let his own arms slide around Sherlock's slightly trembling body.
Sherlock almost purred, his body finally starting to unwind against John's, and he slipped the same arm John's fingers were tracing along around the Doctor's waist, tangling their fingers together shyly, once again glad his blush couldn't be seen in the dark, even as he heard John's breath catch in his chest as Sherlock let his arm rest across the Doctor's pelvis.
"I did lie a little bit" John murmured softly, and he felt Sherlock still against him, and smiled "about your annoying habits? Well I wouldn't mind if you cleaned up after your experiments every once in a while."
It wasn't a request and Sherlock knew it. His eyes narrowed but his interest had been piqued, so he moved fluidly from the table and into his room without comment.
That was until he opened it and began reading, and then he nearly dropped the blasted thing in shock.
"Shut up Sherlock!"
John couldn't see him. Someone, most likely Sherlock, had put a blindfolded him, but knowing Sherlock was in the room suppressed Johns need to remove it and he could feel himself relaxing slowly.
Sally could have screamed, but she refrained, managing simply to grit her teeth and set the cream aside. It was ridiculously expensive, and she would be damned if she was going to throw it away to spite Sherlock Holmes.
"Well it won't be for much longer will it, enough Sherlock, I won't-"
"Sherlock... have you, cooked, Christmas dinner?"
The taller man was filled with an agitated energy, and even with his hands in his pockets, John knew the mans long fingers would be clenched with the desire to run, and remove himself from the multitude of people swiftly and efficiently.
"Sure! One's fine, we'll have lunch somewhere and head over"
"Perfectly."
John shivered, but nodded, light fingers tracing lines along the small of Sherlocks back where a small patch of skin had revealed itself under the detective's jacket and Sherlock shivered, feeling John grin and capturing those smirking lips in a kiss.
"I needed answers, it meant nothing..."
"I had the vest-"
"Yeah, you'll have to get one of the officer's to do it for you, but I know you're not gonna try sneaking evidence out like Sherlock"
Sherlock woke with a sharp groan as he tried to remember what had happened. Who had hit him, and with what?
"How? Gods, Sherlock... I'd know you anywhere"
Sherlock was silent as he eyed a flapping bird, before deciding against it
John had been holding the burn under the cold water for much longer the necessary and Mr. Lewis was starting to squirm as the ice cold water began sending his hand numb. The doctor pulled the hand out and gently dried it, checking the burn again before applying a cooling salve and wrapping it with a light bandage.
"Do you really want to ask me that, Sherlock?"
Page three had a picture of John, Mrs Hudson, and Sherlock sitting in the living room of 221b, laughing happily, and clearly drunk. Page four, a photograph of John's blog post on the case he'd found for Sherlock. Page five, a snapshot of Lestrade holding up the evidence of five wedding bands they'd needed.
successfully snuck his Browning handgun out of the local barracks.
John blinked with his jacket half off, and frowned at Sherlock as the taller man laid stretched out on the sofa with his fingers pressed together under his chin.
Sherlock gasped, and his hips snapped forward without permission form his brain, the cry clamouring up from his chest was smothered as John took his thrown back head and caught the desperate gasps with his tongue.
Just like that, Sherlock was as angry as John, at the lack of trust, at the stupidity his lover was showing, and he attempted to shove the man off him, only to find his wrist held firmly as he thrown unceremoniously into the kitchen table, sprawling across it and finding John's solid, comforting weight, pressing him into the table.
, I've seen you go weeks without dropping, so now that you've decided to top and tail in a single bed like a bloody high school student, stop complaining and let me get some rest!"
"Making tea didn't
"She'll love you, I know she will".
"Go ahead then" he taunted, "What exactly are you waiting for, you won't get a better shot than this? or are you really as pathetic as your burgl-"
"I dun do tha' night shift 'cause I dun want drunks bein' sick in ma cab..."
John was silent as he finished removing his coat and gloves, and carried the shopping into the kitchen as he thought.
Leaving? What? Sherlock!
Mouths met again slowly, and the men's eyes slipped shut as their bodies settled against each other comfortably, Sherlock lying between John's legs, pressed close to his partner and tongues probed mouths, testing and reaching and challenging each other, as teeth began nipping at lips, and hands began wandering.
"Lube?"
Sherlock on the other hand was still smirking as he smothered the remainder of his laughter, "No, not me."
John was on the edge of the precipice, his chest heaving as he drew in breaths and watched Sherlock intently, and Sherlock knew it would be a matter of a moments work to pull the man over the edge into ecstasy, but he had to finish showing John the way through the deductions he'd made and where he'd gone wrong.
At least that's what he'd told himself before he'd planned this surprise, and proceeded to research the best way to make Christmas dinner.
"That's what I thought"
"Pears"
When did you start using emoticons?
Living, relax John.
Merry Christmas? Yeah right.
... suggested to Sherlock that there was more to his lover's motives than just the date, or simple sustenance.
"Your pyjama's are on the bed, it's entirely your choice Sherlock, it's your room after all."
"Sherlock?"
John moving in had made the self proclaimed sociopath realise that half of his problem with eating was that he couldn't cook. Sausages were not supposed to be black, and the beans on toast were supposed to be hot, and not mush.
I'll meet you back at Baker Street
' he thought to himself as he managed to shuffle carefully down the stairs in search of tea and pain killers. Why had he slept so long? Usually Sherlock woke him with the violin, or a case, or out of sheer boredom.
Sherlock had swooped from the restaurant and was heading for the car eagerly, as John chuckled
Mrs Holmes was stunning. Long black hair, that held only a sprinkling of grey here and there, and John half wondered why she didn't simply pluck them. She'd look more like Sherlock and Mycroft's sister if it wasn't for those singular age distinguishing marks.
"Somewhere you can shoot things, useful things" John threw Sherlock's coat at him, and tugged his own on before throwing the taller mans scarf and gloves at him as well. Sherlock was still sulking, but John had caught the sudden shine to his eyes; he didn't know where they were going or what was going to happen, and the unknown had intrigued him.
She smelt a rat.
Do you have the china set or not, Harry
"I love you, John."
"Of course, I did!" he pushed off the table, throwing John back and spinning to pin John to the wall, "I was playing a part you imbecile!"
Sherlock tensed in his arms, and John pulled back a fraction with a frown marring his face, but Sherlock wouldn't, or couldn't meet his eyes.
"What was all that about?"
Sherlock missed a step and John stumbled.
"Shut
I'm vomiting
John knew he was out of his depth when one of Sherlock's experiments got tossed off the kitchen table in the mans anger, and he didn't seem to care"
Shame. What do you want me to do about it?
REST! I honestly don't know why anyone buys these phones! I'd throw it, but it was a gift...
"Doctor Watson, may I recommend-"
"And if she'd aimed for your head!" John spun still furious eyes on Sherlock, and surprisingly the detective fell silent. It took a few long moments of that dark chasm of unnatural silence extending between them, but quite suddenly John wilted and finally seemed to
She studied the still shivering men for a moment, beaming at them brightly "I really can't thank you enough, such thoughtful gifts... but I'll start with some hot eggnog, come in, come in, it's freshly made."
The doctor released Sherlock and the detective stared at him, an expression in his eyes that John couldn't place as his spine straightened and he folded his arms.
"You let her ki-iss you" John's voice broke, even as it lost it's venom and Sherlock realised exactly what was bothering the man, but it only flamed his anger.
Ur taste in dates ain't improved John, fuck sake!
By the time they'd both regained their breath, and their composure, the sweat was cooling on Sherlock's body and John had begun to place tender butterfly kisses along the detectives forehead.
It took moments for John to get a response, and it left a warm glow in his chest for the rest of the day.
The voices had stopped, the murmur's had been silenced and Sherlock's brain was reawakened as the facts in the scene before him slotted into place now that the distractions were gone. He beamed at the eviscerated body and John stood his hand lingering for half a heartbeat before he retreated, letting his lover have his moment to shine.
John managed to make himself turn to glare at Sherlock then, despite the mans soft, guilt ridden, voice.
Sweet and sour chicken balls?
"I … uh, I wasn't attempting to"
"Is it important we're there on time? Is this a booked appointment?"
He sent one more measuring glance at John's small form before he turned and left, merely telling his son to set them up with shotguns.
"Give me your phone."
"Doctors orders, now move."
"There must be! He would keep the mementoes at home so he could look at them, relive the experience through them!"
"Yes there's a bloody problem! You cannot keep shooting the walls!"
When I get in, I'm going to need a fuck
"Keep looking at me, and just breath... I know it's boring, but your mind is occupied with this room, and it's size, but I want you to put that amazing mind to the task of dragging in oxygen at exactly the same time as me-"
*Most likely able
"Good night, Sherlock."
The actual meal had gone without a problem. Soup, followed by a pheasant dish, and concluded with some kind of alcoholic chocolate mouse. Mostly, John asked Sherlock which cutlery to use, and by the time they'd finished the meals provided most of it was still unused. John didn't understand it, and Sherlock promised to explain it later.
"The rum, John, don't you remember last time?"
John sighed and sank into his chair. He didn't really mind going, but he'd not met Mrs Holmes before, and that did make him a bit nervous. But honestly, how bad could a Christmas dinner party be?
, just to confirm that what I wrote is accurate?".
"How irresponsible of him, I suggest you boys go and have fun, Mycroft, weren't you going to introduce me to that assistant of yours?"
As their front door was pushed shut, their lips crashed together and one of them groaned quietly, but John could feel the shaking in Sherlock's hands, and pulled back gently.
Four women. Murdered. Sniper rifle. They'd been shot while on the phone, and the checking of their phone records after the event suggested they'd been on the phone for a long time. Police were stumped, and had no leads as the bullets had shattered on impact, giving them precisely nothing. They hadn't even been able to find a link between the women.
"I'm sorry"
"To clean the house, yes, yes, yes, anything else, anything new, anything you noticed yourself, something that might trigger something I missed, come on John! The motive! It has to be there, in his actions!"
Sherlock grinned back. He could hear her teeth gritting. John's gift to Sherlock, while useful, and very welcome wasn't particularly inspired.
Is the meatloaf still in the fridge for dinner?
"Sorry John, I know it's your lunch break but... well, an emergency's come in, could you take it?"
The consulting detective blushed and ducked his head, before remembering they had company, and bringing his eyes back up with a scowl and a swift, sharp nod.
"..."
Sherlock really needed to thank the photographer, because he'd managed to capture the look of pure adoration Sherlock remembered sending John at that moment.
"I wasn't certain you'd appreciate the interference, John... ah, here comes Mummy."
No one could take this from them.
"Someone stole my mobile; I'm sending a text to my phone." He hit the send button, dropped Sherlock's phone on the coffee table and sent a much calmer glare at the man as Sherlock's shoulders began to relax.
If anyone else had screamed at him, demanded he stop shooting the walls, and even arranged an alternative entertainment without consulting him, Sherlock would have scowled, crossed his arms, and continued shooting the walls.
He didn't look at Mycroft, but he could practically feel the smirk on the mans face, confirmed when after a while he heard the consulting detective wrapped around him issue a soft command to his brother that simply consisted of;
"Well ... who was it then?"
He always heard John. Always.
Sherlock laughed softly, and when he finished that glowing smile he shared with his mother stayed on his face, and John pointedly didn't mention the dampness to the other man's eyes. He knew how much this simple dance in public, had meant to Sherlock. He didn't need to mention it, Sherlock did it for him
"You think you're so damn smart Holmes! but even your brain can't stop a fucking bullet"
"Mrs Holmes, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"I suggest, Sir, that you set a limit on the number of birds I can take home..."
John suddenly withdrew almost fully, and snapped his hips forward without warning, dragging a growl from Sherlock as his teeth clenched in pleasure, staining his lips with cherry juice, that John proceeded to suck away, even as his hips snapped forward again, and his hand began working it's way along Sherlock's length; with the cherry gone, Sherlock's volume increased until John received the final ingredient for his ice-cream sundae.
"Sherlock will you stop fidgeting?"
Tea made, and book prepared the Doctor let his amusement simmer and lost himself in a fantasy world.
"It's a contract, well done Lestrade."
He could actually hear the smugness rolling off of Mrs Hudson as she threw the parting comment of "I'll leave this in Doctor Watson's capable hands then!" and swiftly left the flat in a cloud of her rose scented perfume.
"We're ready to go home, then?" Sherlock whispered, warm lips brushing Johns as he spoke, and marking his lovers increased pulse rate as John nodded
Silence reigned for a moment, before Peterson senior snorted through his nose "Right then, free reign on the geese then Dan says?"
Where did you go?
"What is wrong with you?" John turned at the hissed question, eyebrows raised. He knew what the problem was the moment his eyes focussed on the shocked expression of Sally Donovan.
"Very clever, Holmes..."
"Just answer the question"
Don't make plans, I'm cooking tonight. Take the baby out of the freezer and defrost it for me please Sherlock?
More fun when I don't.
John was already nodding; treating chemical burns was becoming second nature.
The Doctor was desperate, and Lestrade had worked with Sherlock long enough to know that if even John was desperate for help, the consulting genius was at his worst.
"If this is another of Sherlock's-"
John had barely pulled on a pair of white latex gloves when his patient stumbled through the door, hissing softly when his hand caught on the door.
The detectives exclamation had John instantly irritated
"Yes... I have said this"
"You were wrong Sherlock, that's what I've been doing all week, taking a crash course in dance lessons."
Damn it if his wonderful little landlady didn't have a point!
Their conversation was stilled by another tender kiss, and both men's breathing picked up as slowly as their touches. Eventually, John pulled back enough to speak, and found himself pressed against wall with no knowledge of getting there
No, Harry's in the bathroom recovering from a hangover
"Come on John! This is fascinating, I need to see the locations of the murders..."
"Is it not right?"
"Eggnog... It was an ingenious idea, John... You're brilliant, do you know that?"
I'm open to the idea of a divorce, but I'm also thirsty and the can of "COKE" in the fridge seems appealing.
"God, Yes" The Doctor's confidence returning in the straightening his back, and the light in his eyes. If Mother couldn't see that this amazing man made him happy, then let her disown him. Sherlock didn't care any more. Let Mycroft meddle to his hearts content.
"We have a Christmas present for you."
Everything was finally as it should be and Sherlock sighed, relaxing against his Doctor with a whispered;
The doctor blinked and turned to stare at Sherlock, his deep voice having shattered the silence more effectively than a shotgun. He swallowed the last piece of bacon sandwich before answering,
"'Course not!" came John's sharp response, rather closer to Sherlock's ear that he'd anticipated
He'd not fooled him, no chance of that, but his lover had conceded the point, and John considered that a win every time. He treated the detective to a beaming smile and the man rolled his eyes but stopped sulking, turning the T.V on and continued munching on the fruit as John opened his text message, still smiling.
Lube slicked fingers pressing firmly into his ass had the Doctor shuddering, and he relaxed his arm, lowering onto Sherlock's fingers, and effectively fucking himself. His legs tensing around Sherlock's hips brought swearing forth in that velvet voice and on John's next downward movement Sherlock replaced fingers with his cock, the gasps and mewling coming from deep in John's throat were enough to have Sherlock clawing at the precipice of an orgasm waiting to shatter you; the hot tightness of his lover, shifting, lifting around him dragged sounds from him he didn't want to admit to.
John didn't see Sherlock's eyes close against tears that he hadn't expected, or the sudden throb of pain in his chest, that could have come from the bruise, but probably didn't. John was already upstairs by the time Sherlock moved slowly into the kitchen, tentatively picking up the tea and wincing as it pulled painfully as his injuries, and John was tucked up securely in bed by the time Sherlock had painfully peeled off his clothes, dropping them in a trail as he headed towards the bathroom and ran a hot shower, letting the water scald his skin as punishment for hurting John.
"Dan was complaining of pain where I knew he hadn't been shot Sherlock, but I treated the pain in his legs anyway, the legs Charles had grenade damage from... I administered morphine for the pain and managed to save his life"
"When?"
So when Harry tore the paper from a large case of wine bottles, Sherlock didn't think John was going to give him a chance to explain from the black look he was receiving from his lover.
"Grass, John?" Sherlock asked, frowning beneath his blindfold and drawing a chuckle from the shorter man
Urgh, boring.
"No questions, remember?" John told him, even as he grinned, hands in pockets waiting on the detectives cooperation. Sherlock sat up and set aside his book with a sigh that hid his intrigue, and as soon as his vision was plunged into darkness he heard John dart around the flat. The Doctors light steps on the stairs, heavier on the way back down; so, carrying something. The rustle of coats in the hall confirm that they're going somewhere, which supports the theory that John has been watching for some kind of vehicle, probably a pre-booked taxi, hopefully not one of Mycroft's cars
"Sodium."
The look of pure shock on John's face had Sherlock laughing again and he pushed off from the wall he'd been leaning against to head into the kitchen, "Honestly John, where did you think I got all my eccentricities from?"
"I can pour it down the sink if it's a problem, Sherlock" he added softly, in a much calmer mood now he wasn't dizzy from exhaustion "Stop being dramatic, if I'd fallen asleep in the middle, you'd have been even more pissed off."
It was only when she placed a neatly manicured hand on John's arm, far too perfect for a doctor's hand, that Sherlock snapped, he saw red. The consulting detective pushed open the door to the surgery and John spotted him, almost beginning to frown at the look in his pale grey eyes as Sherlock stalked across the room.
He could just imagine dragging Sherlock along to see some kind of performance that involved pipes. He
"Hmm?
"The wall is going to be added on to your rent, that's what the wall is Sherlock! There's only so many times my heart can take this!"
He noticed the exact moment realisation flooded John's face, and he took a step to the side out of Sarah's grasp, and another step towards Sherlock before the tall detective reached him.
You awake?
John had gotten his sister a pair of leather gloves that she gushed over, she Sherlock smirked silently, knowing exactly how much his partner had spent on Mycroft, compared to his own sister. Sherlock had been given two instructions in regards to the gift giving on Christmas day. One, everyone got a gift, so Sherlock had to find something for Harry Watson, and two, it couldn't be alcohol.
John was thinner, but he hadn't replaced his clothes... so he was earning less, eating less to compensate but couldn't afford to adjust his wardrobe to his new size. The limp had stayed gone, as Sherlock had hoped, but the tremor in his left hand had come back and his shoulder was hurting from the cold and the rain, reminding Sherlock that he was still soaked to the bone and dripping on the floor. John had been home, relaxing for the evening; no shoes, just socks, loose jeans and that utterly ridiculous oatmeal cable knit jumper. The one that was too big
That was if Sherlock didn't use the little tree for an experiment before then. What was he thinking? Decorations were like a red flag to a bull when it came to the consulting detective. Mycroft's assumption that he'd been preparing to start a trail of gifts, following the twelve days of Christmas would have made John laugh expect it hadn't been a bad idea.
The detective didn't answer, running over the recipe instructions in his mind and he heard John's familiar footsteps on the stairs.
As Sherlock raised himself onto his elbows and let his hands began wandering down John's neck he could feel the doctor's pulse thrumming beneath his fingertips, and followed the trail with his mouth, soft kissing and sharp nips began marking the skin as John shifting under the detective's weight, gasping in breaths as his neck tipped to one side to give Sherlock more access.
Sherlock wasn't in when John got home, but then John hadn't expected him to be. He knew Sherlock went wandering, to think or to find new cases, while he worked at the surgery but the genius was always home by the time John was.
Want your cock. Lestrade said it would be polite to ask first.
Where are you? The cab can pick you up
"You could have gone back home hours ago, or you could have slept on the floor... Sherlock, you could have just
If James Martin had hidden his trophies in the garden they had no hope of finding them, and this was in the forefront of everyone's mind.
Bring home a bottle of cyanide
"Do you mean the room has to be like this for another 23 days? I can't work like this!"
Their growled and hissed conversation, drew tears, and more blood, but eventually John let loose and sharp whimper of pleasured pain, and bit Sherlock's long neck hard, bruising the skin, drawing blood, and dragging a powerful shuddering orgasm from his partner.
Umm... Should I be worried...
"Swans do not always mate for life; it has been proven through recent studies into genetics that quite often the creatures will divorce from their partners, or even mate with other swans while maintaining their main partnership, some swans have even been known to shown homosexual and transsexual tendencies... "
They sat in silence, keeping each other warm, until eventually John shifted his head from where it had been perched on Sherlock's shoulder and unwound his arms from the other man's slim waist to pull the blindfold gently away and revealing the view to those steel grey eyes.
"Does it matter? It's about love, after all, not stars on top of tree's"
"That, would be perfect Mycroft, I've been trying to think of some way to put everything together as an actual present for Sherlock."
? Well that changes everything!"
"Don't think, for one second, that means you're going to get away with spreading our sex life around Scotland Yard... If you can't keep your mouth shut for one week..."
"Christmas is just another way for companies to extract money from you"
"Ah well" he muttered, as he jogged after his partner, "at least that's another case solved, maybe I can hide the violin with the skull..."
Pure, untouchable, silence descended over 221B Baker Street, and John was pleased to note that Sherlock looked as shell-shocked as John felt that those words had come from his mouth.
"Is this an army thing? Are you all simply incapable of reacting in anything other than blatant acceptance?"
"Did you actually write it though?" Anderson cut in, his nasally voice grating on the last of John's nerves "Or did the freak fake it?".
Clothes were pulled from them both with slim dexterous fingers that John had no hope of following. As much as he hated letting Sherlock get on with it, with no input from himself, and as much as he hated not reciprocating the teasing touches on his lovers body, Sherlock wasn't leaving John much choice as he made the doctors body sing.
"Really? And how did a plumber come into contact with sodium..."
What do you want for dinner?
"So, his twin?"
Sherlock's words had their intended affect, and the tension in his partners' shoulders gradually leeched away and John removed his glare from the goose that had escaped him to send Sherlock that small sweet smile he adored with a quiet "thanks"
"..."
"That overweight, meddling, insignificant... Why can't he stay out of my life!"
Lestrade had left his office, through the desks, down the corridor, gotten down in the lift to the ground floor, and halfway across the lobby of Scotland Yard before he was stopped.
They both began moving, just as frantically as before, almost viciously fucking, and yet still loving in equal measure.
I may have prostituted for too many hours last night, and been sleeping in your room all day...
! He merely mentioned mother would be there... she'd be upset if I missed it."
"I had an emergency case, so Sarah let me go early"
"You mean you can't
He's not dignifying that with a response... so he's having me do it instead; walk.
"People like the sunlight, Sherlock... It reminds them of picnics on Sunday mornings maybe, or happy childhood moments, apple picking or camping trips"
The detective blinked at Johns shocked exclamation as the assistant removed the current selection and scurried away to pick out some more for his customer's perusal.
"You must come for tea one day in the New Year and tell me all about how you met, Sherlock has been irritatingly vague, and Mycroft tells me it's confidential, which probably means it's an incredibly interesting story... what do you say?"
Message received and understood.
"What is that?"
"Is this report accurate? It throws the whole case out of window if it is John, as a Doctor-"
On Wednesday the fifteenth of December, John could have kissed Lestrade when he text Sherlock, no case but he wanted the consulting detective in to confirm some details in the Osman case.
It was silent.
"He's told Mother" Sherlock finally muttered, his body trembling when he couldn't stand John's steady silence any longer, and with their bodies pressed close, he felt the panicked exhale John couldn't smother and fear flooded his system, drowning his anger.
"John...!"
second, I'd let her get away after fucking shooting you? You're an imbecile Sherlock Holmes! Sometimes I wonder what the hell you do with that gigantic brain of yours, because you certainly don't fucking
"Oh don't exaggerate."
"Because he was unfortunate enough to be one of a group of companies Mycroft hired to fix his water pipes after his dinner party the other night."
John had pulled on of the armchairs in the living-room round to face the windows, and was sat, his arms crossed and resting on the window sill so he wouldn't hurt his neck as the doctor leant his chin there and gazed out of the window at the street below and the mundane people passing and getting on with their boring little lives.
The suit looked good, he had to admit, and the fit was exquisite, even the new shoes were comfortable and oh gods, he was going to be sick.
John merely sighed and stood slowly, glancing at the teenagers and murmuring a soft "sorry". The girl was sobbing and throwing her coat on, and John thought it was probably lucky Sherlock had stopped talking and left when he did, or the young lad might have ended up getting hurt.
When Mrs Hudson opened her front door to be faced with two shivering tenants, she immediately asked if the heating was broken in their flat.
"Sherlock!"
They'd collected their prizes and were already on their way back to the farm by the time John had finished his story but at the sudden low note to his voice, Sherlock stopped them and pulled the doctor round to face him
The consulting detective didn't reply and John sighed as he made his way into the living room and scowled down at Sherlock with his arms folded.
"And how would he explain to his partner the sudden collection of wedding rings on her dressing table?"
Sherlock shrugged, suddenly relaxing "Oh, well that happens too."
"Well there's not enough room-"
He was angry, furious in fact, which was why he had filled Sharon Swann with two bullets before Sherlock had hit the floor, or the action had processed through his mind. He had stood there, in the middle of the silent office staring at the gun in his hand for too many seconds before he slid the weapon back in his pocket far too calmly, and advanced on his flatmate's prone form, lying still on the floor.
A man in a black suit, calling himself a private courier delivered two small jar shaped packages to the one bedroom flat of Sally Donovan on Christmas Eve.
"You're telling me now, why?"
Like a machine gun. No wonder John hadn't stayed with her, that laugh could have set off flashbacks to Afghanistan immediately upon the doctors return to England.
When he grazed his teeth over Sherlock's throat, where neck becomes shoulder, and pulled it into his mouth slowly, Sherlock gasped, and writhed lightly, but John held him still, gently, firmly, leaving the detective to gaze out at the sunlight and anticipate his next movements.
"What's wrong?"
Their case had gone on nearly a week and a half, had taken them all over London and had finally finished just over twenty four hours previous in a fight (argument, Sherlock would correct him) in an abandoned warehouse on the edge of the Thames.
Sherlock blinked for a moment, disorientated as he felt John slip his arms back round his waist... Then he smiled as his sharp gaze focussed on the stars above them and a memory assaulted his senses.
It was cut off swiftly as the taxi jerked to a stop and announced that they'd arrived, along with a ridiculous price for a car journey. John, however, paid without so much as a murmur of complaint, which was unusual all on its own, and it took a moment for Sherlock to pinpoint why.
John was nervous, and it had very little to do with the new suit he was standing in front of the mirror staring at.
Sherlock was silenced and Lestrade gaped "That was amazing John, that my gift? Him being silenced?"
What?
"Sherlock... if you don't behave, I'm simply going to withhold sex indefinitely... if you feel so inclined to share the details, then I feel rather inclined to deny the members of Scotland Yard their entertainment."
John narrowed his eyes at him.
"Really John, that's a question on a scale of stupidity I expect from Anderson-"
"So... Not tonight
Surprising him, Sherlock pouted at his comment and sat up, accepting the tea with a quiet, and distinctly sulky "thanks", but the doctor let it go for the sake of peace.
As he knelt over a young woman who'd had her entrails ripped from her body, Sherlock grit his teeth.
"Anything complicated, cold cases are all unsolved by Scotland Yard... Oh don't glare, it's true, and he'll get a kick out of it" John sighed wearily, wiping a hand over his eyes again "I'm too tired to be polite Lestrade, I'm sorry... I won't really know till I see it, I sort of know what cases he likes now so I'll just have to … browse, I can take photocopies home, right?"
He'd had to do most of the preparation at his surgery, and now all he had to do was simply hope that Sherlock was in a good mood. He should be, he'd gotten Lestrade's help in supplying the detective with a simple case the day before to stave off the boredom, but John had insisted that whatever case Lestrade got him to do not linger into today.
Moving swiftly and unpacking the selection of pears before anything else, he filled a plastic fruit bowl he'd picked up at the shops, and placed it on the coffee table. A couple of the fruits went on the window sill, the mantle piece above the fire, John even slipped one into the detectives coat pocket when he replaced his partners gloves.
"Eleven drummers... well they'd be fine if the other instruments there were balance, but there's too few of everything else, the drums are drowning out whatever tune they're attempting to regale everyone with..."
The paused only briefly to shed the rest of their clothing, and then they were meeting again, falling back into the familiar positions on the sofa, and writhing at the heat from skin on skin contact. Sherlock slide his was down John's chest, his tongue flicking over nipples, and teeth nipping at ribs, and the detective spotted the trembling in his lovers body.
Sherlock, I'm used to your experiments, but this one really should have been requested rather than insisted
Sherlock had been speaking, complaining more like, about the incompetence of the police force in general, and the faults of Anderson and Donovan in particular, when John suddenly pushed himself off the closed front door without and word and moved across the room, eyeing the dressing table with narrowed eyes, and the look of someone who was dissecting a particularly dangerous explosive.
The consulting detective's mind was snapped from the path it had been on as it re-evaluated the new data and he gasped, shocked, as he watched angry-John take his phone.
"Sherlock..."
... I'm sorry, what?
The only moment where the evening looked like it might head south was when Angelo tried putting a candle on their table, and after a brief argument, the doctor managed to convince the restaurant owner to remove the candle, and he'd let the man waive the price of the meal.
on Sherlock Holmes.
Chow mien? Give me something to work with, Sherlock!
"But John!..."
He stood for a few moments with his hands tucked into the high pockets on his warm bomber jacket while he stared at the dressing table, eyes still narrowed and flickering. He wondered if it was too simple, too easy, and not slightly creepy, that this serial killer had the same hiding place as his childhood self.
John glanced at him and grinned, seemingly pleased with himself.
"Ok... so, I'll see you Friday, you're still doing the night shift again yeah?"
The two whispered words silenced John and after a moment, he wrapped his arms around Sherlock's trembling shoulders, and cradled the taller man as long legs tangled with his own.
OMG, ur such a sic fuck Holmes!
"You didn't"
Page two, had a picture of their Christmas tree, the same one that sat innocently in the corner of the room, with a second photograph of the two turtle dove ornaments hanging from it. Sherlock remembered that day, and exactly how John had gotten him to agree to keep the tree.
He laughed softly under his breath, forgetting for a moment that Donovan was even there. "You need to get out Dr Watson, out of that flat; I think you're loosing it".
John tensed unwillingly, and saw red. With a dark scowl of his own that he usually saved for unruly army recruits, he leant over Sherlock and pulled the man's chin round to stare into his steel grey eyes.
"That is a contract, signed by Sherlock, and it promises his help in three cases of your choice... No fee needs to be paid, and he will refrain from insulting or antagonising any member of your team, except in defence of himself."
Molested for Breakfast?
"Hmm?"
"My nephew won't drink soup in casserole's" Mrs Hudson told him, matter of factly, as he complained over what had happened at breakfast that morning, pretending to be insulted by the way Sherlock had reacted, "So I simply used to tell him it was gravy, my niece! She won't touch anything with pepper in! I simply don't tell her it's in there, they never know the difference John... Sherlock eats cakes after all, doesn't he?"
"Sherlock glared at him, but John could see the signs of a sulk starting "I didn't
"Dr Watson, how are you?"
The doctor had the rare pleasure of watching Sherlock stiffen in apprehension.
By the time John hung up the phone and turned his, once again stern, eyes back to Sherlock; the consulting detective was sulking against the back of the sofa.
He'd have already followed his lover, but John had made him promise not to, telling him he was preparing something for Christmas. He wasn't lying, exactly, but Sherlock knew when John wasn't being completely honest either.
It shouldn't have been too difficult, even with the six different types sitting on the shelf. Sherlock could have told him everything about each pear, what countries they came from and why which one was best based on the colour of the skins or something, but John simply stared at them, getting jostled by the people who were out on December first, panicking that there would be a food shortage this year and that they simply had to fill their freezers full to bursting.
"I'm going to bed" John indulged himself, letting his eyes scan over Sherlock, evaluating "I suggest you take a hot bath, it should help ease muscle pains, and get some sleep"
"You, John, you said..." Sherlock was sulking again, he'd been hoping to gain some information if their location required a booking in time, but...
Bloody Iphone. I'm putting it in the trash when I get home!
"I thought I'd lost you today... When I saw you knocked back..." John shook his head, and shifted more firmly onto his back, his left arm curled around Sherlock's back and began rubbing a soothing path up and down the detective's arm, from shoulder to elbow.
"But you're still getting the why wrong in the process... I wasn't attempting to disturb your rest, or prematurely bring you back to London to help me... I merely saw an opportunity John"
Sherlock frowned, and his frame tensed until John smoothed his hands down the silky skin of Sherlock's back where they had snuck beneath his shirt.
"Tipsy, Sherlock! John made a wonderful Christmas drink but you took quite a while coming home dear..."
DI Dimmock was tired, but he forced himself to keep writing; if he finished the report he was doing, he'd promised himself he'd leave the rest till after the holiday's, so when he glanced up from his desk, looking for coffee and finding Sherlock Holmes and his ever constant companion, John Watson striding towards him, to say that he was irritated was an understatement.
"What..." Sherlock stopped, and John opened his eyes, that secret smile dancing in his eyes again, prodding Sherlock into continuing.
"You are."
Champagne, John, I've already located the correct poison, I'm onto forms of administration now
Anderson's been suspended for two weeks.
"I haven't put the star on the top"
"I simply don't want to share you or your reactions with anyone else" the doctor whispered and Sherlock flushed.
"Dear sweet Christ, you are mad... of course it was you, but it was everything..." John gasped, pulling Sherlock's face down to his once again for a deep, soul searing kiss "everything from your amazing mind... to your body and... right down to all those irritatingly... annoying habits, that I wouldn't change for anything" he explained between drawing lungfuls of air back into his tormented lungs.
"Not everything remarkable is out of reach, Sherlock" Johns soft voice reached him as the doctor studied the other man's rapt expression greedily, his own face softly smiling when piercing grey eyes finally turn to meet his gaze at the end of the firework display.
Their landlady brought in a glass full of John's eggnog for each of them not very big glasses, and it was clear they're been sipping away at the stuff for a while now. Sherlock sniffed at the glass delicately and raised an eyebrow at John
Both men felt the pleasant tension between them spike, and John felt his gaze drop down Sherlock's face without his consent, he did narrow them, however, at the confident smirk he found on the other mans lips.
I had
Bad day?
John woke to soft kisses pressing repeatedly against his lips every couple of minutes or so, and it slowly brought him back to consciousness until he returned the pressure, keeping the lips there longer than the brief brushes to wake him up.
John looked guilty for a split second before he saw the amusement and irritation chase themselves across Sherlock's features "well … you've never even tried them"
John, come to Barts Lab when you wake up, I need head.
A muttered "oh for heavens sake...!" that didn't fit with John's fury made Sherlock pause as the foundations for his theory wavered and John acted, darting forward and slipping the phone from Sherlock's loose fingers with minimal resistance.
"Is... is this what... what I think it is?"
"I was right."
John stood by the door as he watched the chaos ensue. Sherlock had solved a new case, or he would have if any of the Scotland Yard team could find a single piece of evidence confirming the consulting detective's theory.
Mycroft stared at John for a moment before he sighed and sat down "How much warning did Sherlock give you?"
"Don't be ridiculous, Sherloc-"
Sherlock moved across the small kitchen to press his lips to Johns, barely brushing a tongue across his partners' lips when the alcoholic sister reached the top of the stairs. It was 12.30, and she was already tipsy, and Sherlock could see very clearly how John's request that anything remotely resembling alcohol be removed from the house had not been an exaggeration.
"If you have a problem with the consultants your superior officer is bringing in, why don't you raise the issue with him instead of behaving like a child in a school playground, act the man you're supposed to be for Christ sakes Anderson! And you," he added, whirling back to Lestrade, "Couldn't this have been discussed over the phone? What in the seven hells possessed you to drag me out at this time in the morning when I'm certain you were aware I was on a night shift last night!".
It hadn't needed saying until his brave little soldier encountered something that was truly frightening him. Loosing Sherlock. The detective had to make sure, in his own mind, that John knew he'd never loose him, not for anything.
Sherlock's hips were rocking in time with John's hand, and his mind was beginning to become a blur of sensations. He struggled against it, knowing that the words coming from the man behind him were important, but there's only so much even a consulting genius can take and eventually he gave himself over to the Doctor's skilled hands, and mouth and merely mewled as the pleasure and pressure on Johns hand spiked simultaneously.
John, on the other hand, was rather good at cooking. Sherlock blamed the army, but it did mean the doctor could tempt the detective to eat at home, and usually once a day when there wasn't a case on.
"It's not fair" Sherlock hissed, his voice growing softer as his forehead began to rest against John's shoulder, "What right does he have to decide my life for me? To say that... that..."
The Doctor was left alone with a quick acknowledging nod, and a basement full of files. The single computer was obviously used to look up cases, and then John would have to navigate the shelves upon shelves of cold cases that Scotland Yard had sitting around.
The bloody genius actually looked surprised as John stood from the chair, struggling not to throw his now mostly empty teacup onto the coffee table, and standing while he shook the sticky liquid from his hand.
A CALL damn it! I know you knew what the phone meant!
merry Christmas, John."
It was new, untested ground, and he sent a glance at John across the seat. He looked carved from stone, and the consulting detective knew this could easily turn into another of their explosive arguments; He almost craved it, to see if the Doctor's varied vocabulary drew the same... interested reaction from him, now that the adrenaline had leaked from his system.
"What for this time? Another experiment neutraliser? Something to feed the stray cats? Washing your bloody hair in it? I had a whole two pints in there, Sherlock!"
"You should invite her for Christmas, John" Sherlock's gaze hadn't diverted from the dancers on stage, and John could see the delicate precise steps echoed in his lovers eyes before he chuckled.
Just got into a fight with Anderson. Need stitches, meet me at Scotland Yard, on way now.
A final whisper sealed the evening.
He couldn't let this end. He needed John... Needed John? He blinked at his own reflection, his lips parting in a soft gasp, and he watched his own eyes widen in astonished realisation. He did need John. Completely, for everything. For work, for comfort, for advice, and for forgiveness. A thin steel of determination thread itself through his stormy gaze and he softly padded from the glaring artificial light of the bathroom, and up the creaking stair towards John's room, his anxiety returning the closer he got to the Doctor's bedroom door.
"What-"
The first thing Sherlock's brain noticed was the way Dan paled and winced. The second thing was the dark look that passed over his lovers face, and third thing was the slight smugness around Peterson seniors eyes and following that was a quick succession of movements. John twitched forward a single step, Dan shook his head quickly from behind his father, and Peterson seniors back straightened in response to John's motion
Well, that'll definitely wake me!
"No, Sherlock"
"For Mycroft's Christmas dinner."
He was being ridiculous, I needed a penis and he wouldn't let me borrow one.
John nodded, but Sherlock was already pulling him out of the building.
"Don't do that, it's hard enough when you're doing it right, Sherlock" John muttered, his face flushed as he avoided his lovers questions.
A quick glance and
Not really, you busy?
John couldn't stop his smile, but still embarrassed over his unrestrained temper, he wouldn't look at the consulting detective, "Because I'd never be able to trust you again, and trusting you is what makes this work".
Unfortunately for Sherlock, John had stopped listening at the word 'Parade' and much to the consulting detective's displeasure, was already heading towards the wall of human bodies crushed together against a police manned barricade.
"You're very quiet, John"
"Yes..."
Request for omelettes, offer of molestation of course
He'd finally resorted to something he'd sworn he'd never do. John got himself an account online, and he went to the closest supermarket, and ordered eight pints of milk, to be delivered, every two days to 221b Baker Street for the next month.
Sherlock knew this was more than a 'bit not good' when John froze and his back straightened; Sherlock felt himself tense in response to John's changes even as he waited for a reaction. This new knowledge was confirmed when John suddenly hissed out a question, without even turning to look at him.
"Sherlock, what-?"
I need milk
The doctor cleared his throat, and finally turned back to Sarah, "You're my boss, that's fine, but I finished my shift 30 minutes ago, so if it's not a problem, it think it's beyond time I went home".
"'e's not gonna be sick is 'e?" came the gruff voice that identified John's chosen transport as a London cab
"Wasn't necessary though was it, 'cause you didn't notice anything anyway"
any of you plans, I hope" Sherlock muttered and John froze, his hand still wrapped round the cup he'd just put down.
"Rubbish" came Sherlock's deep voice, shattering the teenager's whispers and drawing their unwavering gazes to his
"Yes."
interesting John Watson found him.
He wanted to get Sherlock to eat more, and despite his best efforts, it wasn't going exactly… swimmingly. Strategically placed pieces of the detectives favourite food around the flat? Well it was his best option. His last hope.
It was warm and soft, and he didn't stop the gentle whimper Sherlocks lips drew from him as the detective tapered off the kiss, and drew away, hopping into the taxi and leaving John to complete his own questioning at the scene.
"That fact that you're supposed to be investigating the missing agent for Mycroft"
The world is supposed to slow down the moment before death, give you time for your life to flash before your eyes and relive your joy's and regrets. All Sherlock remembered hearing was a series of consecutive bangs that made his ears hurt, and a spreading agony is his chest that he couldn't explain. It may have been bullets, or his heart breaking. Later he remembered thinking that he hadn't thought she'd snap that swiftly, was prepared for more taunting before she gave into desperation and fired, but in that instant, when bullet hit body, he just felt numb, wondering if John would be angry.
Always blunt. Sherlock had considered softening his words, but that wasn't him and he hoped John knew that. True to form the Doctor huffed a small laugh and shook his head, finally, slowly, leaning back in the chair and tipping his head back to gaze at Sherlock
I can do that too
"What's in it, Sherlock?"
Blame the phone. Tea?
"Anderson suggested he was hiding the evidence, but you said it was-"
How about anal me before hand and cough in Tesco's
Sherlock scowled at John but the doctor wasn't even looking, focused on devouring his own lunch
He'd worked till 6am, and Sarah had told him she could manage now, and she sent him home, a pitying look on her face. John sighed as he struggled to slip the key into the lock. He must look like hells, because he'd barely entered the surgery before she'd apologised and told him she should have known better than to trust Sherlock's word, but she really had been rushed off her feet.
It had taken Sherlock a little under 24 hours to solve the case. Swift visits to all four murder locations had helped his mind sort out locations of the bodies and possible trajectories for the shooter. He'd missed John's warmth by his side, but at least his thoughts were distracted. How dare the criminal class take a vacation just because of a bit of snow!
Linking their fingers, Sherlock moved to perch on the arm of the chair, but John tugged him down with little effort, till the lanky detective was kneeling on the threadbare carpet, trustingly letting John manoeuvre him so that his knees were comfortably spread for balance and his thighs were resting on the heels of his feet, letting him slide between Johns knees and have his back pressing against the warm, sun-drenched leather of the chair, gazing out of the very window John had been staring through.
The park was very quiet, the cold keeping most sensible people inside, and John relished the quiet. At was never actually quiet back at Baker Street, and as much as he loved Sherlock, sometimes he just wanted that little bit of peace
Silence reigned as Sherlock stopped his rant short, and john frowned. Surely the man hadn't actually realised, on his own, that his comments were inappropriate?
"John, this is ridiculous, why can't we-"
These emoticons are starting to worry me Sherlock
"Uh... You said, personal, but didn't want to face her... He'd cleaned up though..."
As the taxi eventually pulled to a sharp stop, John even swiftly managed to remove any clue the price of the journey would have revealed by firmly telling the abrasive driver to 'keep the change', before guiding Sherlock from the vehicle and moving them away from the car onto soft, uneven ground.
