child, and I don't give a
Peter shrugged. "Yeah, I know."
"That's an affirm," said Cam. "Oh, Phillips isn't gonna like this!"
Tony sighed, shifting Steve so his back was against Tony's chest with Tony's arm across him. "I know that, honey. And Pete's name was also in those research materials that you guys found in Siberia, so—"
"All right, let's see what you bastards got," he murmured as he raced towards the invisible but deadly line of demarcation, his hands gripping the throttle and stick as he counted down in his head.
Tony's eyes narrowed as he swerved to get in front of the rude-as-hell doctor. "Circus clown?" he said through clenched teeth. "That's my son, you ungrateful son of a bitch! And since he just saved your magical ass, how about showing him a little goddamn appreciation!"
Steve's eyebrows knitted together, and he brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "If you had, you might've seen me on occasion," he said. "My teammates and I sometimes come out here after patrol."
"Yeah," Peter murmured, trying very hard not to pout. It was bad enough that his dads still treated him like a little kid, he didn't need to give them more ammunition. "But at least I know exactly where they are this time. They're sitting on the bedside table in my room."
“Master Peter wishes for me to inform you that he is awake, sir.”
And then, it was Steve's turn.
"I appreciate that very much, Captain," said T'Challa. He glanced around their group, acknowledging each of them with a nod. "However, I do believe that my father's unfortunate death is not the main reason for your visit here today."
"Please, don't get up, sweetheart," he said again as he handed Tony a pair of his sleep pants, tucking him under the covers once Tony had pulled them on. "I want to remember you lying in our bed just like this while I'm gone, with that look of contentment on your beautiful face."
"Steve!" Peter exclaimed as soon as Steve stepped inside. "I'm so glad you're here!"
"Babe, why're you still watching that garbage?" Tony said as he came into the bedroom, cleaning his hands with an old towel. "You know it's just gonna make you upset. That guy blows the most hot air I've ever seen in a politician, and that's saying something."
Grandma's lower lip began to shake, something that Papa's also did when he was upset. "I couldn't—I couldn't take the chance," she whispered. She jerked her head in the direction of the poster. "All his life, Steven just wanted to serve his country, like his papa. He never even got to meet his papa, and yet Joseph was still Steven's hero. Every night when he was little he would tell me that he couldn't wait to get better so he could fly the aircraft like the ones in the poster. The same aircraft that Joseph flew. And there was no way I was going to tarnish any thoughts that he had of his papa. No possible way."
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthe saints! ♥️
"You were?" asked James, obviously taken aback. "When?"
Sliding his arm into the right side steering gimbal, Dad jerked his head towards the opposite side. "Get your hand in there and close the top around it. This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time, yeah?"
"Papa?" he said, his full lips curling into a stunned smile. "Papa, you're—you're home! You made it home!"
"Yes, yes," Thor said once he'd downed most of his glass of lemonade in three huge gulps. "It would be my honour to escort young Starkson and his sweet lady friend to the revelry you people like to call hockey. Especially since Starkson has informed me it is that much more exciting to view these sporting events while they take place in the arena than on the viewscreen."
“That one of the flips you're teaching Pete there, Widow?” asks Tony.
Just like he couldn't tell Ned the truth about how Dad had lingered near death for days in the hospital while Uncle Bruce and Helen Cho worked round-the-clock to develop an antidote to the Aminacin that was trying to kill him, and how messed-up Papa was now because of it.
"Well, let me know if you need any help later, okay?" Steve said. Tony had mentioned something about venturing into his lab the night before, which Steve had been absolutely ecstatic about. It had been months since Tony had done anything other than set a single tentative foot inside his workspace, and Steve was hoping that once he got in there, he would maybe feel compelled to start tinkering again.
"I'll be a lot better once you take this bastard out!" Joseph yelled back, grunting as he banked a hard left and curved into a dive, pulling up just in time to avoid crashing into the top of a mountain.
The subsequent argument-turned-shouting-match he’d had with Obie that’d nearly led him to indulge in a few shots of that thousand-dollar-a-bottle Scotch notwithstanding.  Tony hadn't taken a single sip of hard alcohol since the day he got the call about Peter, but that didn't mean he wasn't still tempted from time to time.
Tony huffed, slumping back against the couch and crossing his arms. "This isn't how I meant to tell you."
"Cap!" Clint called from somewhere else, high-pitched and frightened. "Cap, we're getting overrun!"
"Yeah, I think so!" Bruce answered as he lifted off from the plain, landing several metres ahead of Steve's speeder. With Bruce and Hulk still having their… differences of opinion, Steve had suggested that Bruce start out the impending battle wearing the armour. If Hulk then decided to join them once things got underway, all the better.
All the air whooshed from Peter's lungs in one fell swoop, and he had to physically stop himself from gasping out loud. Of
“Tony!” Steve pleaded, his body so frozen he could barely breathe.  “Tony,
Tony just pursed his lips as they crossed another street, leading Steve inside a coffee shop.
He would never get used to seeing Peter like this. Absolutely never.
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"The arc reactors," Steve blurted out, shaking his head when he felt his cheeks heating up. "Isn't that correct, Mr Stark?"
“Good idea,” agrees Steve.  “So, Clint and Natasha will take out the perimeter guards as quietly as possible.  Once they start making too much noise, the rest of us will move in.  Thor, Bruce, and I will spread out, concentrating on the rest of the perimeter bunkers, while Tony focuses on disabling the main building defences so we can get in there and search for the Tesseract.”
sounded over the comm as the tesseract discharged from Steve's aircraft, with Tony waiting with baited breath for Steve's assessment.
Of course, Steve can simply explain to Peter how to do all of those things, but if Peter is anything like Steve, then he would likely catch on a lot faster after seeing what Steve’s talking about in action.  Which means that unless Steve feels like coming up with some sorry excuse for why he can’t physically swim anymore, he’s going to have to do it.
"Just… show us what you found, big guy, yeah?" Tony said quietly.
Bucky's eyebrows shot up. "Another civilian? Really?"
"I didn't—!" the man gasped, grabbing onto Bruce's arm and causing him to jump. "I was—I was programmed—I didn't have a choice—I didn't—!"
"Because Thanos knew you would do whatever it took to protect your planet," said Gamora. "I believe you would call it, killing two winged creatures with one chunk of fossilised soil."
"Uhh, yeah," Peter stammered. "Yeah, it's—it's good. It's very, very good."
" he exclaimed as JARVIS suddenly zoomed him out of the way just in time to avoid being bowled over by another ship as it suddenly appeared at the wormhole's exit, this one even more ridiculously massive than the one they'd just blown up. "Oh,
“That it might’ve had something to do with his son?  Yeah, I do,” says Natasha.  “Which is kinda interesting, don't you think?”
"Pretty sure," Gwen said as she leaned back, allowing Peter to take her place. "Up there, slightly to the right of the North Star. Do you see it?"
his way back down the hall, leaving Steve alone, immobile, and absolutely freezing.
"He wasn't too upset with them, was he?" asked Steve as Clint started yelling for Natasha to come and help him up as Wanda and Pietro giggled in the background.
Not to mention he needed to make sure that Tony actually ate something of substance once he woke up, instead of trying to subsist only on coffee for the next three days. Again.
With a slight shudder Tony returned his attention to the screen, sitting up straighter as the code completed its compile and the words INITIATE SYSTEM appeared across the top of the screen.
"And in the meantime, Captain, Mr Stark," he finally said. "We're just supposed to trust that you and your… team will do the right thing?"
"Mmm, yep." Tony was tired, and now that his entire body was buzzing with the post-coital fuzzies, he thought he might actually be able to fall asleep without trying to solve all of the world's problems beforehand.
Peter gave a nod. "Yeah, that's what she told me." He grinned, remembering how Grandma had told him that she'd had to stand on a chair in order to reach Papa's neck. "She also told me that she hadn't realised until then just how much the serum had made you grow until she had to stand on a chair in order to reach you."
"Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!" cried Quill as he activated his Flash Gordon helmet. As soon as it was in place he took off, aiming for Thanos just as the building covering him exploded into a huge, purple fireball. Thanos' indignant roar echoed across the desolate plain, forcing Peter to slap his hands over his ears until his mask was able to modify itself to better block out the sound. As soon as he freed himself from the rubble, Thanos raised his left arm, the glowing stone shifting purple to red as he launched pieces of the building—that somehow had turned into giant evil bats—towards Dad at the speed of a rocket.
you attempt to blackmail the very person you should’ve loved as a son into giving up the man that he loves, simply because you find our relationship repulsive!”
Papa let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head as he scooped out a huge bite of ice cream from his glass. The little crinkle between his eyebrows that Dad always called his worry wrinkle was on full display, and Peter always hated when Papa was worried.
Steve has
"I'm gonna miss you so much," he whispered once they broke apart, hugging her as closely as the centre console would allow. A traitorous tear escaped down his cheek, one that he quickly swiped away. "Please, promise me you're gonna be careful! You never know when you might run into some badass British supervillain or something, and then Spider-Man won't be there to save you, so—"
Because if there was anything about Steve that Tony might've considered a flaw, it was the fact that the man seemed to wear his emotions on his sleeve. And judging by what Tony often saw in those blue eyes he could quite literally get lost in, Steve honestly cared about him.
"Yeah, I appreciate that," Tony said softly. "J, can you get Sam on the line please?"
"This is just a nightmare," he whispered. "Only it's even worse, 'cause I can't seem to wake up from it, and—"
"Okay, fine," replied Peter. "But… what's going on? Did something happen that I don't know about?" He and Gwen had started to discuss possible college choices over the summer at Gwen's suggestion, but only casually, as Peter hadn't really wanted to think about it all that much. He'd always figured that he'd either wind up going to Columbia, his preferred choice at the moment, or MIT, Dad and Uncle James's alma mater, and since he and Gwen were still only juniors in high school he had decided that he didn't need to worry much more about it yet.
Steve breathed in slowly, trying desperately to hold onto his patience.
A huge thank-you to my awesome friends on the IronDad and SpiderSon Fic Recs discord for their input into this chapter!  You guys are amazing! 💖
"Well, I suppose that we can always work on your manners later," Hammer finally said. "Because you see, today is a very important day. The latest prototype of our new design is finally ready for testing, and I'm so excited that I can hardly contain myself! To see one of my own prototypes going up against the legendary Steven Grant Rogers, well, let me just say, I had to take a moment to collect myself before coming in here."
After making sure that Tony finished his food before he escaped into his lab, Steve kissed him goodbye and headed down to the lobby, where he found Sam talking with the owner of the newsstand.
"No, Dad, it wasn't a nightmare, 'cause I wasn't asleep," insisted Peter. "I was—I was—" He lifted his head, his brown eyes red and swollen and his round cheeks lined with tear tracks. "I've—I've gotta tell you something, and I don't think you're gonna like it."
"All right. Tell him we're ready, JARVIS."
"Стив, we did it!" Steve heard Bucky call over the comm as they crossed the aircraft landing area outside of the palace. "They're all fading! Every last one of 'em are fading!"
"If I have to," Papa said. "But I still don't—" He paused, shaking his head. "I'm not quite sure what's real and what's not anymore."
Natasha was right, though. If they, the Avengers, couldn't hold on to hope, how could they expect anyone else to keep holding on?
"Oh, I really hope you can come, Uncle Bucky!" Peter continued. "The Decathlon finals are held in the spring, and that's a really nice time to be in D.C. with all the cherry trees blooming and stuff. And then we could take you around to see some of the landmarks! I bet you'd love 'em! Papa and Dad even got to see the Smithsonian exhibit on the Howling Commandos on one of their trips down there!"
"Howard, no!" she gasped. "You can't—you can't go! Tony, he—!"
"Absolutely," Peter said. "We have those two half-days right at the end of the school year, right? I'll ask my dad if we can get tickets for one of the matinee shows, and we'll go."
Tony sniffed as he put down the phone, swiping his fingers across his eyes under his glasses. He knew the X-302 pilots were used to seeing him in various stages of fatigue and general unkemptness, but if what Steve had said was true about his teammates already knowing about the two of them, all any of them would need to do would be to take one look at Steve's face and know that something had happened.
"I didn't tell you 'cause I thought it would just make you sad!" Peter exclaimed, followed by such a junky coughing fit that Tony's heart almost dropped to his knees. He really had no business trying to get Peter upset.
"Do what?"
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Oh, really?  It does?  Then why did the head of the Relief Foundation out in Sokovia just tell me that she’s starting to see the active targeting of civilian homes, huh?  ‘Cause that doesn't sound like less chaos to me.  In fact—”
“Well… I suppose that could potentially reflect poorly on yourself and Peter,” Pepper said diplomatically.  “If indeed any such bias existed.”
Because even now, after two-plus years of marriage, Steve still always asked Tony what he wanted.
“It could very well be, Master Peter,” said JARVIS.  “However, I am still unsure as to how this is helpful.”
"Um… is—is that, a guy?" Tony asked, incredulous. "Like, a
Dad’s eyes narrowed, then suddenly snapped open so wide Peter thought they might pop out of his head.
Besides, with Papa's foot still in a cast he was already cranky enough from his lack of mobility, and Peter didn't feel like adding even more ammunition to it.
like Siberia all over again. "Please, tell me it's not—!"
Mr Optimism indeed.
“Tony and Peter Stark are here to meet with Mr Steve Rogers,” Dad says into the intercom.  “We have a four o’clock appointment.”
And not just the chilly kind of cold, the kind that would prompt him to put on a sweatshirt or jacket, or cuddle up with Tony under a blanket.
"It appears so, sir, but the data was processed through an innumerable number of routers, so I am unable to determine exactly where it was accessed from, or where the data ended up."
"Just about, Pete." Tony tapped in some more commands as he glanced furtively at his son, who was flipping the pen around his thumb so fast that Tony could barely see it. "You sure that Bucky's the anxious one here, though?"
Dad gave him a brief smile, ruffing his hair. "So, what's new with Ned?"
Uncle James was on another phone call when Peter got back to the living room, so he just gave him a quick wave and headed back to his bedroom, not really wanting him to see that he'd been crying.
Tony whispered as his arms wound around Steve's waist, his palms splayed across his ass. "Honey, you're just—"
Tony had told Steve numerous times that he'd never had any intentions of becoming a father, and especially not after having his heart broken by Peter's mother, an undercover SHIELD agent sent by Nick Fury to evaluate Tony. Steve had heard the story of the night Peter was born many times, mostly at his request. Since he didn't get to meet Peter until he was already eleven years old, Steve loved hearing stories about when Peter was a baby and younger child, and especially about how much Tony had adored him from day one. From the moment Tony laid eyes on Peter as a tiny baby, he was hooked. Born prematurely and suffering from underdeveloped lungs, Peter spent several weeks in the hospital after he was born, during which Tony didn't leave his side for longer than a few minutes, a protectiveness that hadn't waned at all in the sixteen years since. Tony was so head over heels for his sweet boy that Steve had no doubt that he would move heaven and Earth in order to keep him safe.
"Ah, go ahead and start on the render for the devices, yeah? Let's just make three for now, we can make the rest once we're able to test 'em out. Oh, and why don't you get another batch of the Pym Particles going too, yeah? I have a feeling we're gonna need 'em."
Steve gasped as Tony broke away from his mouth to trail kisses down his cheek to his jaw, sucking gently on the super-sensitive spot just below his jawline. "Sweetheart, we don't—we don't—"
HYDRA had done everything in their power to try and break him, but Steve had refused to give in, just like he always had. Tony had never known Steve to back down from a fight, even when the odds were practically insurmountable against him.
And, since the weather had been absolutely glorious since they'd arrived, topping out around thirty Celsius every day with plenty of bright sunshine, Steve's most common state of dress had been a pair of swim trunks, tight, ab-outlining t-shirt or sexy-as-hell, shoulders-bearing tank top optional.
Steve is just about to turn away and concentrate on his music when Shostakov suddenly looks up, a wide, sneering grin stretching across his face when he realises he caught Steve looking at him.
“Oh, I get that from Dad,” Peter said without missing a beat.  He then shot Steve a grin that was downright maniacal as he moved his remaining knight, forking Steve’s queen between the knight and his other bishop.
And all of that happened
"And he's eating okay?"
"Oh, I'm sure I've heard someone mention something like that at some point," Tony said with a wink. He suddenly clutched his abdomen as he launched into another long series of coughs, a fit that left him gasping for breath once it was over.
(See the end of the chapter for
"At least two more," said Thor. "The Space Stone or tesseract, which is currently well-hidden within New Asgard, and the Soul Stone, located in Wakanda."
"Oh no, please, I wouldn't want to interrupt your work," he said. "I'm just here to—"
"Oh! Are you gonna be staying here with us again?" asked Peter.
"Oh, come on, Tony," Natasha said, rather cheekily. "I know you've been to bigger parties than that."
Finally free of the grass, Peter lurched forward, shooting a web just as Gwen's hands slipped free from the railing. He cried out as the web caught her around the waist, just a split-second too late to prevent her head from snapping against the rock-hard floor.
The timing was especially sucky for Dad, since his birthday was at the end of May. Peter and Papa had gone out of their way to try and make it extra special for him this year, and Peter knew that Dad had appreciated it. It was just hard for him sometimes to forget that on his birthday six years ago, he and Peter were being held prisoner by terrorists hired to capture them by his very own mentor.
Tony turned his head, just enough to reach Steve's jaw with his lips.
“Shh, Steve, it’s okay,” Tony whispered.  “You're okay.  I’ve got you.”
He really needs to ask Tony about those earplugs again.
Steve watched from the door as Tony walked down the street to his car, not turning away until he had disappeared around the corner.  Then he hurried back to his room, scooping Ashes into his arms as he raced over to the window to catch a glimpse of Stark Tower, beautifully bathed in the light of the full moon.
The boy gave an unaffected shrug. "So? We all know it's what Dad's thinking anyway, I'm just the only one brave enough to ask 'em out loud."
“Well, yeah.  But—”
And it wasn't like Tony didn't agree, either. HYDRA was evil incarnate, and there was no doubt in his mind that the world would be a far, far better place once it was wiped out.
said Uncle Bucky.
"We can see ourselves out, Mr Stark," Stacy said as he offered Tony his hand. "Thank you for your trust."
"Promise?"
"It okay if I take him out on the lake for a bit before dinner?" Steve whispered. "Give you a break for awhile?"
Tony thinks as he pulls his car into a parking place about a half a block away from Mags’s.
Something else was going on.
, he’s been what Peter would call obsessed, trying anything and everything to locate the rest of them.  In the almost twelve months since the Battle of the Triskelion, Steve has led the Avengers on six separate raids, trying to hunt down the HYDRA remnants scattered across the globe.  Add all that to the ongoing search for Bucky, who so far has managed to evade every single one of their efforts to find him, and Steve can’t exactly say that he’s been the most fun person to be around lately.
“Ah huh,” Steve finally managed.  “And who’s ‘our’?”
Eventually.
"Okay," Steve said slowly. "But what is it? 'Cause right now it kinda looks like one of those round robot vacuum cleaners that Peter used to have."
"I did," Tony said proudly. "Why, he beat ya?"
"No, no, nothing you can do about it," Dad said firmly. "But I will definitely be making it there tomorrow, okay? Colonel Phillips even said so."
said Uncle Sam.
"He does, buddy. And I'm hoping I'll be able to bring him by here soon and introduce him to you. He says he's really looking forward to meeting you, and he's even told me that he likes to draw."
Steve smiled, a smile that Tony quickly mirrored. One of the worst things about Peter only getting to see his Auntie Nat on the weekends was that it had greatly decreased their opportunities to continue with Peter's ballet lessons. Peter still practised a couple times per week, and both Tony and Steve loved it when they just happened to wander into the living room to find Peter gracefully leaping across the floor while
"Mmm, maybe." Tony let out a positively wanton moan, heat spreading across him like a blanket as Steve's hand slid down his abdomen to his sleep pants, tracing along the rolled waistband.
"Mmm, I s'pose," said Ned. "I just… I thought we were best friends, but now you're telling Gwen stuff that you don't tell me, and spending almost all of your extra time with her, and—"
Lang shook his head, looking like he'd been knocked in the face by the Hulk. "Uhh, yeah! I do, actually. I've been talking with a few buddies of mine about opening up a home security company. I figured no one knows better how to secure a home than a bunch of people who're used to breaking in to 'em, so—"
“All right, Tones,” Tony heard Rhodey say from behind him.  “Let’s do this.”
Tony has asked him on more than a few occasions, sometimes amused and sometimes not.  Whenever Steve tosses an almost-completed drawing aside because he messed up one tiny part of the smudging.  Whenever he makes the team go over a training formation three separate times to make sure they have the timing down perfectly.
"Well, it is. And that's not your fault. It's just… how it is. But yeah, there were plenty of times when I'd look over at Pete while I was working, sitting there in his little cordoned-off play area in my office, and wonder what the hell I was doing to him. You know, one of the first words that he ever said was 'rocket'? His very first one was 'Dada', which, you know, made me pretty damn proud, but 'rocket' wasn't too long after that. And, I don't know, it just didn't sit right with me. But at the time, the company was all that I knew, and I was hell-bent on making sure that if by some chance something happened to me, Pete would be taken care of. And that meant I had to make sure that Obie stayed in his lane."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Steve, it's always helpful to get this stuff out, right?" Sam gently prodded. "It's not good for anyone to keep things bottled up, mainly 'cause then you're never sure when it's just gonna start bubbling over and make a huge mess."
And the Joint Chiefs had agreed, much to the chagrin of Senator Stern and his HYDRA lackeys.
"Don't you think that if the wizard's aware of how we win and he's still refusing to leave, that we should maybe do the same?" asked Gamora. "He said he saw over fourteen million possible outcomes, and only two of those were victorious!"
"Thank you, Mr Harrington. I really appreciate it," Papa said in his Captain's voice. He leaned sideways, looking around the practically drooling teacher and begging Peter with his eyes. "Peter, are you ready to go?"
"Uh huh," Peter said warily, just as he heard Ned's mom's voice calling for him in the background.
Being embedded within the Air Corps for as long as he'd been, Tony had heard plenty of stories about the voracious sexual appetites of the pilots, with some even bragging about how they had worked sex into their pre- or post-flight routines.
They stayed there for over an hour, intermittently dozing and exchanging the occasional soft kiss, but went no further than that.  With the all of the stress of getting Steve started on his recovery and accumulating the evidence against Obie, sex had fallen by the wayside.
"Hey, sweetheart," he said as he stepped inside, avoiding a precariously leaning stack of papers as he made his way over to Tony. He glanced briefly at the computer screen, his eyes crinkling as he smiled.
"Стиви? You okay?" he asked, then immediately scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Hold on, that was a stupid-ass question. Are you gonna be okay enough to handle this?"
Peter looked exactly like he did in Steve's drawing.
"You'll be able to handle it," Rhodey said softly, looking up from his datapad. Apparently Tony was now to the point where he was speaking his thoughts instead of just thinking them. "I know you will."
"Oh, I know it," said Grandma, rather vehemently. "Not as well as you or your father, but I do understand."
"Can you please state your complete name and birthdate for the record, Captain?"
Tony frowned as he watched Bucky go, grateful that Steve hadn't decided to stop by the lab on his way to get cleaned up from his run. Tony was admittedly very possessive of his husband, and especially with how damn sexy he was when he was all flushed and sweaty and panting after one of his hard runs. It tended to remind him of other times when Steve was flushed and sweaty and panting.
"Really?" Steve said with a frown. "Almost like you were one of the Howling Commandos with us?"
"I love you," he whispered happily, the sentiment meant for both of his sweet boys. Then he picked up Peter's discarded drafting pencil, adjusted his desk lamp, and went back to work on the airliner design, already daydreaming of their upcoming ski vacation.
"Thank you," Steve said, barely getting the words out before he claimed Tony's lips in a bruising kiss, pulling back after only a second to whisper, "You're not too tired, are you?"
After putting away his sketchpad and brushing his teeth, Steve crossed the items off his list and stripped out of his clothes.  He had been almost uncomfortably hard the entire time he’d been sketching, and so didn't waste any time grabbing the tube of lube from under his mattress and squeezing a generous amount into his palm.  He let out a sharp gasp as he began stroking himself, the pleasure immediately spiking to almost stratospheric levels.
Adjusting the backpack strap on his right shoulder, Steve tightens his grip on the bar as the train lurches forward, rumbling on towards its next stop.  Empire State is ten stops away from his tiny Brooklyn studio, but thirteen stops away from the physical therapy centre, which means by the time Steve exits the train, the pain in his shoulder has ramped up from a dull ache to a sharp, stabbing throb, prompting him to reach for the bottle of ibuprofen he keeps in his backpack as soon as he steps out onto the street.  He frowns as he sees that there's only enough left for two or three more doses, groaning at the thought of having to make yet another trip to the pharmacy in the next day or so.
A loud
"You are no match for me!" Thanos snarled. "No matter how big your army grows, mine will always be bigger! You have lost!"
Steve gasped, so dangerously close to losing it himself. "No, sweetheart,
It’s not until Tony’s left eyebrow quirks slightly up that Steve realises he’s been too busy staring at the man’s face to answer his question, something else that Natasha’s seen fit to point out on more than one occasion.
"Steve, it wouldn't've mattered if you had," Tony said, muffled against Steve's broad chest. He wound his arms around Steve's waist, closing his eyes as he breathed in the scent of salted peanuts and beer lingering on Steve's sweatshirt from the baseball game. "You're the Captain,
He tucked his head down under Steve's chin, grinning as Steve asked JARVIS to play
"I talked to Pete," Tony cut in. "This morning before the simulator sessions."
"But,
Peter shot Tony one of his
"Tony!" Steve choked out as he clung to his beloved, finally allowing his tears to flow. "Tony, what—what
"Yes, it is," Steve said, way too fast when Tony frowned. "I can, I just… once we can root out where the rest of HYDRA is hiding and take 'em down, and once that legislation is rejected for good, and once—"
replied the nurse. She leaned closer to the incubator, smiling fondly. "
And who just happened to be the daughter of Hank Pym, who, while not officially reported missing, had not been seen by anyone since Thanos' snap.
"I was… I doubt that I would've lasted another six months, honey." Tony dropped his chin to his chest, self-loathing emanating from him in waves. "The night that I got the call about Peter, I was so drunk that I thought someone was trying to pull one over on me. It wasn't until the doctor called me back for the third time that I finally realised that he wasn't actually trying to bullshit me, but even then… it wasn't until I saw Pete with my own eyes, saw his tiny little self lying there in that bassinet, that I really believed it was true."
"I have already alerted the rest of the team, sir, and Mr Wilson is inbound to your location along with the Mark thirty-five armour," JARVIS cut in. "However, be advised that the armour is not yet fully equipped with your standard armament."
"Tony, you stand down! That's an order!"
"All I'm saying is that it might give you some more chances to unwind a bit," added Sam. "Which, no offence, you could definitely use."
"No!" Steve gasped. "Oh God, please, no!" Carefully, he took his son into his arms, pressing his ear to Peter's chest to listen for a heartbeat.
"Mmm. Thought so," Tony said. He swiped a slice of garlic bread from the tray, ripping off a piece and stuffing it into his mouth. "Which one was it this time?"
"Yeah, it does," agreed Phillips. "But based on what you've told me this plan of yours is pretty much foolproof, isn't it?"
"Very good, sir. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance," the cadet said with a rather confused nod. It was rare indeed for an officer to show his face in the cadets' computer lab, but the kind of information Steve was after wouldn't likely be as easy to find on his handheld datapad.
"All right, enough about your private lives already," barked Phillips. "If no one has any further questions about the actual aircraft that you're about to fly, then you're dismissed. Wheels up in twenty."
“Who are you?” he asked in his Captain’s voice, or at least what was passing for his Captain’s voice when his mouth felt like it had been coated with sand and his tongue weighed as much as the
"And Pete?" Tony asked. "What about him? Colonel, if this doesn't work and we get caught, then—"
"Ah… JARVIS?" he tentatively asked, cringing in anticipation. "You there?"
Steve's arms froze against Tony, and he buried his nose into his hair, breathing in deeply.
"Well, from what Papa and Dad have told me about him, he kinda is sinister," said Peter. "Dad always says that he gives him the shivers."
"I believe it would be best to be frank, Captain," T'Challa stated. He held his hand towards the inside of the trailer. "Please, why don't we all sit down and discuss this."
“Yeah, honey, that sounds good,” Tony whispers as he gives Steve a wink.  “And I love you too.”
Steve didn't even justify that statement with a reply, choosing to simply glare at the man until he shifted on his feet.
"Well, how 'bout you tell me after we go and visit Pete tonight, hmm?" said Tony. "He made me promise not to go and see him unless we went there together, so—"
Tony's shoulders dropped, and he let out a heavy sigh. "Yeah. Honey, I'm—I'm… well… I guess I'm not sure—"
"Oh God, Tony," Steve groaned, his breath hitching when Tony's hand slid down his sternum to his abdomen, tracing along the waistband of his pyjama pants. "You don't—you don't have to."
Steve's fingers closed around Tony's, causing him to jump. "Honey, your hands—!"
Until Steve, that is.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh huh.”
“February 12th, 2019,” Steve went on, his voice getting lower and tighter with every sentence.  “Approximately thirty minutes after the attack on the civilian apartment building, a single sniper bullet is shot into the building where my team set up our base of operations.  That bullet explodes, causing the entire building to come down, killing two of my men and injuring two others.”  Steve paused, glancing back at Bucky, who gave him a single nod.  “Including one Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes.”
Tony frowned, tilting his head. "Oh, you're not going to
"Oh God, Tony, I've missed you so much!" Steve practically sobbed. "I've missed you so much, I can't—I can't—!"
"I have been told that from time to time," Steve answered. He leaned down, whispering in Tony's ear, "But I'm not the only one."
"No—" Tony started.
Steve reached for Tony's face, trailing his thumb across his cheekbone. "Yes, I know you do."
Peter reached for his father’s hand, squeezing it.  “Daddy, this wasn’t your fault.  None of this was your fault.”
Steve wasn't sure how long he was floating in his sea of sensation, his limbs deliciously weightless as Tony pressed a few final kisses to the inside of his thighs before crawling back up his body, trailing the pad of his thumb softly across Steve's cheekbone.
Tony lets out a kind of morbid chuckle.  “Good one, Cap.”
He had always known that Justin Hammer was a jealous, petty man who shamelessly used anyone that he could in order to try to get ahead, but this went even beyond that.
But now, things were different. And while Tony still channeled a lot of his energy into Peter, he now had a partner with which to share the burden. Someone who loved and protected both himself and his son without hesitation or prejudice, someone whose arms chased away the horrible memories of the freezing-cold Afghanistan cave when they woke him in the middle of the night, and whose voice spoke words of such devotion and adoration that Tony often was convinced that he was a poet as well as an artist.
"At ease, Captain," said Phillips. Then he walked over to the door and pulled it open, stepping back as one more person entered the room.
The task that happened to be defending the Time Stone against the strongest creature in the entire universe.
day, this regular Tuesday afternoon sitting in his physics class directly behind his girlfriend was a walk in the park. Peter shuddered as he recalled the throbbing pain in his head and the severe tightness in his chest that made it hard to breathe, all of which was magnified by the nearly crushing fear that Dad was going to die from some raging infection after his heart surgery.
“Yeah.  Or even nothing, as it were,” Dad said with a smirk.  “Actually, come to think of it, I’m pretty sure I prefer the nothing.”
"I don't want him to ever be targeted by anyone," Steve blurted out. "I mean, I know we just overthrew our corrupt government and now we'll probably have at least a few years of peace—"
Several heartbeats ticked by as Steve waited for Tony to move, finally giving his arm another gentle tug.
"JARVIS?" Steve said, or rather, croaked.
"I guess it does make sense," he finally admitted. "I'd already been thinking that the reason why HYDRA hasn't tried to nail any of the rest of us yet is 'cause we've been so off-track with our searches."
"Have fun, buddy!" Tony called back, warmth spreading across his chest as he watched his two boys motor away until they disappeared into the sunlight beaming off the water.
"Stay here," Colonel Rhodes said once they pulled into the parking lot. "I'll go and grab a wheelchair."
And now, he was paying for it.
"And I've told you that you have no reason to be nervous," Steve said. He tugged on Tony's hand, pulling him up to his feet and wrapping his arms around Tony's waist. "Ma's gonna love you, sweetheart. There's nothing for you to be nervous about."
"'Kay."
And now, thanks largely to Peter and Sam, Bucky was almost back to his normal self.
Peter shrugged as he tore the pages from his notebook, handing them to Dad. "So, how's Steve doing?"
Bucky frowned, grabbing a bag of chips while he watched Steve eat. "So, you gonna tell me what's got you all messed up? It's not like you to forget to eat."
Next it was Steve's turn. "I'm so proud of you, Buck," he said, clapping him on the back. "That took a lot of guts."
"I was at my absolute wits end one night. I hadn't slept in days, Pete was screaming so loud I thought he might shatter the windows, and Howard was ranting around in the living room 'cause he'd run out of whisky again and it was after dark, so no civilians allowed out on the streets. I ended up calling Ms Ana, Mr Jarvis's wife, who actually risked arrest to drive over to the house, and she showed me a trick that she'd learned while working as a nanny."
And then he gathered his husband and son into his arms, burying his face into their heads of curly brown hair as a whirlpool opened up deep inside his gut, sucking everything inside him down into a dark oblivion of pain and grief, leaving nothing but emptiness behind.
Tony had been fully aware that Project Phoenix would completely overhaul their entire world, especially since that'd been pretty much the entire point of it. But not even he could've predicted all the ways that things had changed in the last six months or so. Not only had the planetary energy crisis been completely abolished, but because energy was no longer a commodity that needed to be bought and sold—or price-gouged, as it were—every single citizen in both Langara and Meridia could now enjoy luxuries that were once considered so out-of-reach that they had been nothing but mere fantasies.
"Honey, I still don't think this is necessary," Tony said as he fiddled with Steve's time/space compass. "It's really not a big deal if I go in again, and—"
And there were still at least a dozen people trapped in the auditorium with him. Helpless, innocent people who he needed to save.
"I'm so sorry," he whispered as he settled himself over Tony, gently kissing his way down the scar. "Tell me what you want, sweetheart. Tell me how I can make you feel good."
"Well, if that's what it takes to keep you with me, then so be it," Steve said. "I'll take that chance."
"Oh!" Steve breathed, fighting the strong urge to jump for joy. "Oh, Tony, that's—that's incredible! Does that mean we'll find out the rest of the mission parameters as well?"
"Natasha, you have to be getting tired and hungry," Steve said as soon as the door latched closed. "And Bruce, you as well. Why don't you let me take Peter now so you guys can get some rest?"
"Not yet," Tony said carefully. "Bruce is working on it, but it's gonna take awhile. JARVIS says the encryption on this stuff is at or above Project Insight levels, so we can't rush it if we want to be able to transfer everything that's there."
"Yeah, I know. I guess I was just kinda hoping that it hadn't gotten to that point yet." If HYDRA was already trying to smear Papa in the news then that could only mean that they were starting to move to the next phase of their plan, which likely included total or almost total control of the media.
"But I'm sure Papa's got everything under control," Dad added, probably to convince himself as much as Peter. "You know him. I'll bet you he's already got everyone in line down there in Wakanda."
“Ah—but—um—” Pepper stammered, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.  “Um—”
"Huh?" Quill said, looking up from where he and Gamora were huddled together a few metres away. "What'd you say, Mr Man?"
He had saved the universe.
"Well, I don't know," Tony said, turning to Strange. "You couldn't do one of those fancy-schmancy circle things and get us back to Earth, could ya?"
"Ah, he's such an awesome kid," Tony said as he took another sip.
Steve thought.
"You haven't been a jerk," Gwen murmured. "Just a bit… broody. You're much cuter when you smile." Peter let out a chuckle, his smile widening when Gwen laughed. "There, you see? Isn't that better?"
He was just stuffing his backpack under his chair when the blonde girl sat down on his opposite side, holding out her hand.
As the weeks stretched on, as the summer faded into autumn and then winter, Steve and Tony slowly grew back together.
"Huh?" Peter asked. "Uh, nothing's wrong. Why?"
, do you hear me? You stay out of that water, Steve, and that's an order!"
It was something that Steve now understood all too well. His fear that he would somehow lose the husband or son that he loved beyond reason had never been more profound than it had been down in that Miami hospital, when he kept vigil over them both for weeks as they fought for their lives.
And holy
come off as being anything close to an asshole.
Steve's heart was in his throat as he stared into the grizzled colonel's eyes, finding nothing to indicate any deception on his part.
Not ten minutes later they were sitting in the steaming hot tub, filled to the brim with lavender and vanilla scented bubbles.  Tony had Steve’s back to his chest, his head resting on Tony’s shoulder as he stroked his fingers through Steve’s thick, blond hair.
Almost immediately Peter felt his cheeks blushing pink, and he let out a soft cough as he nodded. "Thanks," he said. "Papa… he's a big fan of plaid, my dad really likes it on him so he wears it a lot, and since he's the one who usually takes me shopping, he thought it'd be nice, so—"
"Uh huh."
"Seeing as how they made Iron Legion Halloween costumes this past October, I'm not sure how you can say that people are frightened of them, Senator," Tony replied. "And to answer your question, yes, I do believe it is absolutely necessary to continue guarding the convoys. As I said earlier, I don't believe that Toomes was working alone, and until we're able to get him to talk and find out who else was involved, we can't be too careful."
"History?" Tony frowned, squinting at the too-small print. Of course he had left his glasses in the lab. "Why the hell would you need to go to the Museum of Modern Art for History?"
"Well… hell. Thanks, Tony," Clint said with wide eyes. "It really must be Thanksgiving."
"It was the Chitauri," said Steve. "I mean, unless we know of another space-faring race who's trying to come after Earth, then it's gotta be them. Right?"
“Ah, don’t mention it,” answers Tony, nearly drowned out by one of Hulk’s roars as he and Thor start thundering down the road, taking out enemy agents and weapons as they go.
"So, just for their peace of mind, as it were, do you care to add anything to your statement regarding these… observations, Captain?" O'Brien asked.
"Colonel Phillips? You forget that I'm the one who's reading all of your team's flight reports everyday," said Tony. His lips curled into a smirk as he added, "Phillips was gonna make the announcement by the end of the week, once everyone's gotten through at least one re-entry practise session, but right now it looks like it'll be you, Barnes, and Danvers who'll be going up on the trial mission, with Wilson as backup."
“Thank you, Mr Wilson.  We’ll be waiting.”
"Yes, sir," Steve said firmly.
"Yes, well, if anyone thinks that he can insult my little Starkson here and get away with it, then he has another think coming, as I believe you Midgardians would say," Thor said, clapping Peter on the shoulder so hard that he would've driven him through the floor if he'd been just a normal kid. "Especially since I know that the StarkPhones are in fact far superior to any competitor currently on the market. Or at least that's what Banner tells me… I still don't quite understand the need for a phone, but, well, here we are." Thor let out a smile as he squeezed Peter's shoulder. "Now, Starkson, I do believe you did challenge me to another game of chess while the Captain here was transporting us back to our grand Tower?"
he thought as he raked his hands through his hair.
As long as he would be able to present his new proposal to the military leaders before Peter's condition worsened any further, everything should be fine. Tony had checked and rechecked his arguments a million times and he knew the proposal was sound, with absolutely zero margin for error, so unless the military had completely lost its collective mind—which wasn't entirely out of the question—they would have no choice but to accept it.
Not surprisingly, the entire six-hour patrol shift seemed to go by in only a matter of minutes, such that Steve was actually disappointed when it was over. The X-302 had handled like an absolute dream, the smoothest aircraft he had ever flown, and he already couldn't wait to take her up again.
It had been
"Yeah!" Peter said with wide eyes. "I mean…
"Good." He planted another kiss on Steve's neck. "Then let's get back, hmm?"
Tony sighed, giving her what he hoped was a grateful smile.  “No, that’ll be all, Miss Potts.”
"Yeah, I know it," Tony said softly, biting his bottom lip to keep it from shaking.
Steve frowned, and Tony had to bite down on his tongue to keep from laughing. This whole thing was starting to read like something that Peter and Ned would make up during their Minecraft games.
"That's better," he said to his reflection, wrinkling his nose as he noticed a blemish forming on his upper lip. He didn't get zits all that often, probably due to his healing factor, but when he did they tended to be doozies. Guess it was time to stock back up on the zit cream he ran out of over a week ago.
"It's not out of the realm of possibility, Tony," answered Steve. "Stane and Killian did manage to break into the Tower, so it's entirely possible that they were able to plant spies here as well. Do we know for sure if the sceptre is still contained?"
Even more evidence that his little boy was growing up.  And that Tony was nowhere near ready for it.
Steve sniffed, nodding.  “Yeah, I am.  I just… it’s funny how certain things just seem to happen that don't seem like such a big deal at the time, but then—then—”
Coincidence?  Tony thinks not.
"There's a dude in the water," Sam said as he dove towards the middle of the lake, scooping what appeared to be a man floating facedown on the surface. Steve locked eyes with Bruce, with Bruce tilting his head in silent question.
"You know not everyone believes it though, right?" said Gwen. "You should've heard my father ranting when he saw the first news story. It really wasn't pretty."
"Who're you?" Peter shrieked as he took one step back and nearly tripped over a gravestone, almost crumbled into ruin. His heart leapt into his throat as he read the name etched into the stone, the grave so overrun with weeds and tall grasses that he felt like they were suffocating him.
"Who the hell are you?" Tony snapped. "Where's JARVIS?"
Somehow the experiment seemed to have caused he and Peter's empathic connection to reactivate, the same connection that had allowed him to locate Peter during the battle.
And besides that, the man looked oddly familiar.
Peter nodded, allowing Grandma to help him guide his IV tower into the bathroom next door to his room so he could pee and brush his teeth. He was so tired that he was practically falling asleep on his feet, his strength so low that he could barely even squeeze the toothpaste from his toothpaste tube. Lately it'd been taking so much of his energy to just keep breathing that even the simplest tasks had turned into almost unbearable chores.
Stepping up behind his starting block, Steve breathes in, focusing on the soft ripples shimmering across the surface of the clear blue water as he brings his right arm across his front to stretch out his tricep.  He slowly counts to three—
"Whoa there, child!" Dad exclaimed with wide eyes. "That's a pretty grown up word coming out of such a young mouth!"
"Yeah," answered Peter. "I'll FaceTime you."
Steve smiles.  He was happy to have Bucky as a teammate at the Trials, and he’s even more grateful for him now.
“Good morning, Miss Potts,” Tony said as he took the mug, inhaling the delectable scent of his favourite strong, dark roast.  “Ah, this is exactly what I needed.”
“Yeah, Dad, I can do that,” Peter said softly.  “Just as long as you don’t freak out if Steve tries to kiss you or something.”
"All right, little guy, just try and remember that once you drop your ski, your first instinct is gonna be to lean towards that side, and that's what's causing you to fall. So try and put most of your weight on the other side before you drop the ski, okay? That'll help you keep your balance once you're just on one."
But now all the progress that he and Tony had made with conquering their water demons was gone, and he was back to square one. And while Tony would tell him that being frozen in ice for the second time in his life would be enough to cause any man to be afraid of the water, Steve still couldn't bring himself to accept it.
"Thor showed up at the last minute with some information that we'll need to share with the Wakandan prince," answered Steve. "Do you have any new intel for us?"
"Steve, Thor and I have secured the biological," Nat said, just as Rumlow aimed a hard kick directly at Steve's face. He managed to get his arm up in time to block the kick, rolling up onto his feet and crossing his arms as Rumlow advanced. His shield still several metres away, Steve dodged and twisted as Rumlow continued to swing, leading him away from most of the onlookers and hoping he would eventually tire himself out enough to make a mistake.
Wouldn't it?
If it hadn't been for the four large satellites mounted underneath the rounded wings of Steve's and Carol's aircraft, Steve would have almost been convinced that it'd all been some sort of mad dream.
"Mmm," Tony said as he dragged his tongue down Steve's sternum, dipping it into his navel as he worked his pants down his legs. Steve tried to keep his eyes open, tried to watch as Tony pressed feather-light kisses all along the length of his cock, but he just couldn't. It had been too long, and Tony's warm, wet mouth just felt too damn good as it closed over his length that Steve's head fell back against the headboard, his hands fisting hard into the sheets as Tony practically swallowed him down.
Steve shook his head, unable to admit just how right Peter was. In fact, despite his dislike that Tony had taken to wearing his nanite armour case around the clock now, even to bed, Steve had unconsciously grabbed his own case while collecting his wallet and keys, placing it underneath his leather jacket in the hopes that Peter wouldn't notice.
Actually, at the moment, Tony couldn't remember a time when he
"I'm all right, damnit," snapped Tony. "I need to watch him."
Emotion welled up inside Tony, so strongly that one of the tears he'd been trying to hold back finally escaped, rolling its way down his cheek. Steve's words, spoken in the old Irish language he used to speak with his ma back when it wasn't really all that cool to be a young Irish lad in New York, were the perfect soothing balm to his insecure soul. Tony could still remember his shock when Steve first spoke in the language to him, during their honeymoon. After watching Steve frolic in the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea all afternoon, his hair soaking wet and his sun-kissed skin dotted with water droplets, Tony hadn't believed that his husband could possibly get any sexier.
"Oh no, not at all," Tony said, thick with sarcasm. He shook his head, a smile lighting on his lips as he recalled how he'd had to run Peter's glasses up to the school that very morning after Peter realised two periods in that he had forgotten them. Again.
Uncle Thor shook his head, sniffing as he took a huge bite of one of his sandwiches. "No, no, Young Starkson, although I do promise to visit from time to time. My people and I have decided to settle in an area of your planet that you call Norway."
He just had to make sure that Papa didn't die in the meantime. So far they could thank the super soldier serum for keeping him alive, but Peter assumed that not even the serum would be enough to keep him alive forever.
Peter huffed, his arms tightening around her as much as he dared, trying to focus on the burst of sensation sparkling across his chest than his upcoming secret mission. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this pleasantly warm.
"Has the potential for extra-atmospheric flight," Tony finished. "Yes. That is exactly what I'm telling you."
As it turned out, Dr Strange wouldn't have been able to do anything for Peter anyway, and not getting him involved ended up saving his dads from having to explain Peter's genetic mutation and enhancements to yet another person outside their family.
"You're right," Steve said as he pecked Tony on the nose. "Don't really want him to start gnawing on the furniture, I don't think it'd taste very good."
He was cut off by a piercing scream, one that nearly stopped Tony's heart. In a flash, Steve took off running out of the lab, nearly tearing Tony's arm from its socket as they raced back to Peter's room to find him thrashing around on his bed, obviously trapped in one of his nightmares.
Steve pursed his lips, swallowing his groan of frustration.
Bruce let out an excited grunt as he finally located the part Tony had been coaching him to find for the last ten minutes. "Is this it?"
"And go against the wizard's prediction?" asked Mantis.
“What in
Tony's hands clenched into fists. If this didn't work…
"Papa," Steve suddenly heard, both from Peter on the bed and inside his own mind. He immediately snapped his head back, clapping a hand over his ear.
"Dad, I'm right here," Peter said softly, giving Dad's hand a quick squeeze. "I'm fine."
"Yes, mo grá, I promise," said Steve. "Bucky got him right in the chest."
"Well, train wreck is a rather appropriate metaphor." Tony tossed the towel into the nearby hamper and wound his arms around Steve's waist, hugging him from behind. "At least now we know who we have to watch out for."
"Thank you," she said as she stifled a yawn. "Can you also please tell him that I—well, you know what, nevermind. I—I'll tell him when I talk to him."
"What can I say?" he said as he reached for Sam, pulling him into a quick hug. "Congratulations, Sam. You couldn't've picked a better guy."
"How in the hell did you get in here?" James cut in. "This place is secured!"
"Yeah," Quill said. "What if us going to Earth is what causes us to lose?"
Steve's look of pure joy mixed with confusion was so cute that Tony almost laughed.
"Well, then,
"You're the fun uncle," Peter said as he took Uncle Bucky's knight, giving him a triumphant smile.
"And you did, Steve," said Natasha. "You did rid the world of HYDRA, even if it wasn't quite in the way that you thought."
Peter thought, then immediately felt bad for even thinking it. As per their usual, Dad and Papa hadn't shared too many details from their recent mission since they'd been back, and Peter hadn't been able to get much of anything from JARVIS either. But Peter could tell that they had found something that had unnerved them both, even more than they were already.
"Mmm, I'll think about it," Dad grumbled. "I love you, buddy. Sweet dreams, yeah?"
"Then tell me what you want, mo grá," Steve said as Tony attacked his neck again, kissing his way down to his collarbones. "How can I please you?"
"Uh huh. I'll be there." With very rare exceptions, Peter always helped Papa make dinner every night, and it was especially fun when he knew his uncles were coming.
But if Peter at only eleven years old was assisting Anthony with a project that he had designed for the Air Corps, now
Steve sucked in a deep breath, gripping his shield. "Good afternoon," he began. "My name is—"
Steve had said. "
"Uncle Bucky?"
"Diagnostic revealed no anomalies, sir," JARVIS said. "System is ready."
"Сделано," he said with a single nod.
Tony thought as he tipped his head back against Steve's shoulder, briefly closing his eyes. He, Steve, and Peter were curled up on the couch in the living room of their Irish cottage, watching the latest Star Wars movie on the big-screen TV. It had been a pretty busy day, beginning with yet another flat tire while driving along the bumpy Irish roads—and what
"Yeah," scoffed Tony. "At least there's that." He tipped his head against Steve's shoulder, briefly closing his eyes when Steve kissed the top of his head.

Bucky narrowed his eyes. "Oh, and you do? What the hell, Steve, have you been checking up on this guy or something?"
"Dad's gonna be fine, little guy," Steve said firmly. He placed a hand on his son's shoulder, giving what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze. "He says it's just a simple chest cold, but—"
"And it looks like she did an excellent job of it," Papa said, brushing some non-existent lint from Peter's shoulders. "She taught me how to tie a tie right after I got fitted for my first Air Corps uniform."
"Tony, is that really necessary?" asked Papa. "He's just a policeman, not one of D.C.'s politicians."
"Ah, you mean nothing else weird, right?" Peter said with a smirk.
"That's correct," Gwen said. "Awesome job."
“Steve, Dad,” said Peter.  “His name’s Steve.”
"Yeah, I know," Steve whispered back. "But we will."
Gibberish spilled from Steve's lips as he wove his fingers through Tony's silky hair, his fingertips gently pressing on Tony's scalp as Tony practically swallowed him down. Tony had told Steve not too long after their first time that he loved giving Steve blowjobs, loved to watch Steve's face as he surrendered to the pleasure that he gave him, knowing he was the only person to ever see him that way.
He found Peter hunched over his computer at the breakfast bar, the counter covered with splatters of milk and marshmallows as he giggled through a mouthful of cereal.
"It's a long story, Sam, okay? And one we don't have the time to tell at the moment," he said, securing his shield on his arm as Thor swung his axe, slamming two more Chitauri warriors into yet another whale.
"No!" Steve said, far too emphatically, he realised after the fact. "I mean, no, thanks. I don't want to bother him if he's busy."
"Yeah?"
Tony rolled his eyes as he blew across the rim of the cup before taking a careful sip, shivering as the coffee burned its way down his throat and into his empty stomach.  “If you're trying to imply that in my old age I've somehow forgotten the definition of insanity, then A, you're wrong, and B, okay, you’ve made your point.  So run it again.”

Howard flinched as the overhead lights suddenly cut out, plunging the entire house into near-pitch darkness. With a muffled curse he opened the top drawer of his desk, rummaging around until he located the small handlamp that Maria had purchased for him during her last shopping trip. The Langaran government had been issuing repeated alerts for the last two weeks, warning the continent's citizens that due to the ongoing energy crisis following the destruction of the main power plant six weeks prior that it would be instituting rolling blackouts. They had even included a schedule of the areas to be affected and when, but, as he usually did with anything government-related, Howard had simply chosen to ignore it, preferring not to be reminded of the day that his young son almost died on the operating table.
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
that it will, Captain," clarified Dr Cho. "But Peter did sustain a pretty notable concussion, so… it's probably best to plan on a few days, maybe even a week. That way if he wakes up sooner, it'll be a pleasant surprise."
"You know, this job… we try to save as many people as we can," Steve quietly began. "Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody, but… that doesn't mean that we should give up, and hide our heads in the sand. When we go back, when we all step into that tunnel and transport ourselves back to that battle, we'll be saving billions of people from a fate that they didn't deserve, but we'll also be placing ourselves directly in the line of fire. We're used to it, because we're the Avengers. We're supposed to fight the battles that other people can't. That's what we signed on to do, so we owe it to the people of this world, and all the other worlds in the universe, to see it through. Whatever it takes."
, and I didn't know where the hell you were or if I'd ever see you again. Just getting to sleep next to you again has been a gift."
Seeing what he’d seen and living what he’d lived through over the last twenty—or really for most of his life, if he were honest—Steve had been convinced that nothing could truly shock him anymore.  But he would now swear on about a thousand polygraph tests that
"Thanks," Steve whispered back, very aware that Chief Stacy was still standing about a metre away. They both watched as everyone crossed the street, with two of Happy's security guards taking up their positions by the theatre entrance as soon as the three of them disappeared inside.
And, since cinnamon was not only a good germ fighter but also tasted good when mixed with honey, it made the perfect choice for Tony as well.
"Steve!" Tony yelped as Steve watched Thanos struggle to replace the Power Stone, his entire body sparkling with bolts of bright purple lightning. "Honey, we've got no other choice! I've gotta—!"
"Yeah, well, he is my kid," Tony muttered. "Can't say I'm too shocked."
"I—I just… took a shower," he murmured.
You mean Asgard is gone? Like,
Steve nodded in thanks as a guard wheeled a padded chair over next to the table. Slowly, so as not to jostle Tony, he sank down into it, stifling a groan as his sore joints and muscles moulded into the adaptive cushioning, his eyes slipping closed almost against his will.
"Oh, that's okay," Peter said quickly. After the rather tense afternoon he'd had with his grandfather Peter was looking forward to relaxing a little. He picked up his own notebook and pencil, flipping to a clean page.
"Just a bit," Steve said with a laugh, tugging gently on Tony's shoulders. "C'mere. I wanna kiss you."
It also didn't mean that he wasn't almost scared to death about the fact that he was now placing the man he loved in danger of getting arrested for treason. Tony had no doubt that Steve would gladly go along with whatever version of Project Phoenix came to be, and especially if he knew that it was Peter's wish as well. But the fact that the stakes had already been raised about a million-fold haunted him. Tony had heard various stories over the years about Air Corps widows and had personally seen the anguish Rhodey and Carol had gone through after his accident, and it wasn't something that he was at all looking forward to having to face.
"Because I was curious?" Steve said, just a hair shy of patronising. Being so hungry was sorely testing his patience. "I wasn't aware that Howard's son was involved in the test-flight program, so I was just wondering—"
And they even came with a small, one-sided blade for sharpening.
Steve sat as still as a rock as Peter began shuffling towards the bathroom, only exhaling once he was safely inside. Then he dropped his glassy eyes to the floor, searching through the tangle of blankets until he located the fallen notebook. He picked it up, intending to place it back on the bed when he noticed a page covered in the same odd gibberish that he had caught a glimpse of on one of his earlier visits, only this time complete with a title written across the top in large block letters.
"Yeah, so conversely it may also be his best chance against us!" snapped Tony. "Because if I'm assuming correctly, you can use that thing to tinker with time, yeah?"
"I'm not going anywhere."
"Yes, you are," she said, so softly that Peter barely heard her. "But Steven, he doesn't know. I could never bring myself to tell him."
"Uh huh." Peter allowed Papa to lift him to his feet, setting him back down on the couch. He did feel a bit better after he ate a few slices of Papa's awesome homemade pizza, and after tackling his physics and chemistry homework and taking a long hot shower, he crawled into his bed, cuddling his polar bear to his chest while his dads hovered over him.
Peter pulled back, his lower lip shaking. "One of the files that I decoded tonight, it was talking about the same kind of technology that the old SHIELD helicarriers had, the retro-reflective panels? Well, I thought that kind of tech could only be used for planes and other stuff that can fly, but now—now it seems like HYDRA's figured out how to use it to cloak a building, and—"
As soon as the doors closed, Tony tipped his head forward, his forehead resting against Steve's collarbone as his trembling arms wrapped around Steve's waist, squeezing him with every ounce of his strength. As difficult as the last few days had been for Steve, he knew they had been even more so for Tony. He also knew without a doubt that Tony had not yet come to terms with the realisation that he was now dependent on his formerly-disgraced father, the very man who had neglected him for most of his life, to attempt to save their son.
them, if you know what I mean.  And you never really
Peter rolled his eyes, mumbling something under his breath that Tony couldn't quite catch as he watched him disappear down the hall with Steve. His husband and his son, his two boys who he never thought he'd have, and now couldn't live without.
"Well, that's actually what I came in here to tell you," said Natasha. "Thor got here about a half hour ago, and he's waiting to talk to us whenever you can break away for a few minutes."
"Sure! That sounds fun!"
"And you think that's enough?"
His voice trailed off, unable to bring himself to finish his sentence.
After all, keeping over twenty million people content under martial law for the last twenty-eight years hadn't exactly been easy, but Tony had a strong feeling that it was going to be even harder for him to convince them to choose to give up their power, even if it meant the betterment of the entire planet.
"Yeah, maybe. We can hope."
“That’s exactly what I’m thinking, bud,” Dad said.  “It makes perfect sense.”
Unfortunately, his ability to point out just how grateful he is when Tony does simple things like that hasn't yet caught up to that awareness.
he thought bitterly. If anything he was even more stressed out now than he'd been before they started, not to mention how he was now going to have to order some poor cadet to go and fetch all of the baseballs
"I'm definitely okay at the moment."
He can always tell him he’s sorry later, after he knows if Mr Rogers will agree to coach him or not.
“I’m sorry.  I don't mean to,” said Steve.  Parking the truck, he hurried around to Tony’s side, opening his and Peter’s doors.  “I’m just really happy to be with my family tonight, is all.”
Tony watched as Steve's gorgeous blue eyes scanned the room. "I don't see why it wouldn't be," he murmured. "But if you're not comfortable here we can talk outside."
"Steve," Tony rasped as they broke apart. "Honey, take me to bed."
"Oh Christ, Steve, you know that I do," he said instead, burrowing even further into Steve's embrace. "But you also know that you don't have to go through the whole literal song and dance to show me, right?"
And then they all just… stood there. Almost like they were waiting for something to happen.
"Oh, thank you," Steve said in relief. "For everything."
"I would say so, sir," said JARVIS. "He and Sergeant Barnes spent the evening watching movies while Colonel Rhodes participated in several conference calls."
"I don't know," Steve said honestly. "But what I do know is that neither Tony nor Peter have done a single thing to deserve any of this, and yet they're both being punished for it."
And if it happened to help prove to them that he could be a more than capable addition to the Avengers at the same time, well, that was just icing on the cake.
"What aren't you telling me?"
"Okay," Peter said, grinning. He opened his notebook, showing Dad the code he'd written earlier that day. "How 'bout I tell you about how I figured out how to program JARVIS to monitor the X-302s while they're on their space missions?"
"Copy that," Sam said grimly.
“Set.”
"Okay, but I'm still going to," Steve said, stifling a cough. "So you're just gonna have to get used to it."
"Eh, Papa didn't mind too much," Peter said with a shrug. "Uncle Sam still teases him about it, though."
"No!" Steve exclaimed just as a drop of sweat landed right in his eyes. He blinked against the burning hot sting, yanking back on the stick just as he banked hard to the right, managing to manoeuvre behind the missile so he could take it out.
And now, the rest of the team needed to engage in theirs.
"Yes," he whispered as he opened one eye, giving Tony a crooked smile. "Now, what about you?"
The fact that the company’s stock tended to drop if too much time passed between unveilings was a secondary issue, but, according to Obie, only barely.
"Yeah, yeah, big guy, all right." Dad rolled his eyes, scrubbing his palm down his face. "Here, you wanna come say hi to Pete?"
And now, he was
“Oh, and just in case you're not busy enough, there’s one more thing I need you to do.”
Image Papa sniffed, nodding as he patted Uncle Bucky on the shoulder.
After enduring so many years of unrelenting war, both throughout his country and inside his own home, Tony Stark was finally at peace.
"Don't be afraid," she said, smiling. "I'm here to help you."
"Come in?" he said, his belly swooping when Sam walked into the room, followed directly by Bucky, Ma, and Sharon.
, only a minute or two later, I find out that not only have you been working on these things for the last few weeks, you’ve also taken over one of the rifle lines so you could manufacture ‘em!”
After the chorus of affirmative grunts, Steve steps back inside the Quinjet to replace the tablet and gather up his cowl and shield.  Securing the shield onto his back, Steve fastens the cowl under his chin as he heads towards the jet’s aft section, where his brand-new Harley Davidson Street 750 motorcycle sits secured to the floor.  Tony presented him with the bike the night before they left for the mission, and while Steve knew he shouldn't read too much into things—Tony has supplied all of the equipment for the six of them ever since the Battle of New York—he still can’t help but let out a smile as he unhooks the binding straps and grabs onto the bike’s crisp, leather-covered handles.  Rolling it down the ramp, Steve arrives just in time to catch Tony as he steps into his armoured suit, the shiny red and golden metal encasing him into its protective shell.
"What?" both Steves said simultaneously, just as a glowing, sparking circle suddenly appeared, hovering right there in the middle of the battlefield. The very same kind that Dr Strange had used to locate Steve and Sam in Central Park back before the whole mess began.
"No," Peter said softly, swallowing hard. "They can't… I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna let them have me."
Peter nodded, taking a small drink before licking his lips. "Thank you."
At least the physical therapy is working, even if his progress seems slower than molasses in January.  Unable to raise his hand above the level of his chin right before the surgery, at almost a month post-op Steve can now at least wash his own hair again.  He has to tip his head over to the left, but it still counts as a met goal in his PT regimen, and something both he and his hair appreciates.  His next goal of taking a quick jaunt around the block on his bike is still a few weeks away, but if Sharon’s praise after his session that morning is any indication, Steve is making steady enough progress that hopefully he’ll be able to meet that goal without too many issues.
Valkyrie's
"Yeah, I think so," agreed Tony, his voice trailing off as Captain Rogers emerged from his cockpit and removed his helmet, his thick blond hair plastered to his head with sweat. Tony's heart gave a flutter as he licked his lips, trying to not imagine running his fingers through that hair—and failing so miserably that he almost laughed—when Rogers suddenly turned his head and locked eyes with him, giving him an almost imperceptible nod before his buddy Barnes tugged on his arm and dragged him away.
"Remember when I told you that I'd met Tony's son?" Steve asked. "And how protective he was of him?"
smiles that he knew Steve could always see right through. "It's probably nothing, babe, just—"
"Oh," Peter said, wrinkling his nose. "So… he's like a cyber cat burglar?"
"Eh, pretty much the same old shit—I mean, nonsense," answered Tony. "Davis keeps pushing me to get rid of the Iron Legion 'cause he says it's scaring people, which is just a bunch of bullshit, and they're all still whining about the Triskelion mess not being done yet. I swear, if they would actually get their heads out of their asses every now and then and actually
"Yeah, yeah, hot stuff," Tony said with a wink. Steve chuckled as Peter immediately rolled his eyes, leaning down to press another kiss to Tony's lips.
He can do it.  All he has to do is believe that he can.
A massive shudder rippled through Tony's body as he remembered that night, that horrible night when his life got turned on its head. He'd been only six years old, his entire chest throbbing in pain as he screamed for his mother into the pitch-blackness of his bedroom, pain that only got worse when his mom finally returned to him, her face streaked with tears that had ruined all of the makeup she had so carefully applied.
Carefully, so as not to disturb his sleeping husband, Tony lifted his head, blinking as he took in the sheer gorgeousness that was his Steve. His adorably mussed blond hair, softer than silk. His strong arms, the right curled around Tony's waist and the left resting on his pillow, bent up over his head. His smooth, broad chest and deliciously defined abs that disappeared under the thin, silky bed linens.
"Steve, something else is happening!" Bruce suddenly cried, clomping to a halt a few metres behind Steve, where the wind had mysteriously started to swirl, churning up dirt and leaves in its wake. "Oh God, he's coming!"
“Honestly, it hasn’t crossed my mind, Tony,” Steve says softly.  “That was an… interesting time.”
"I'm still here, honey," he said once he finished with Steve's abdomen and chest. His pale skin was almost covered with huge black and purple bruises, only increasing Tony's desire to personally strangle every single piece of HYDRA scum that had ever dared to lay a finger on his family.
"T-Tony! Where's—?" Steve choked out as he grabbed onto Tony's arms, the sheer terror in his voice and eyes hitting Tony like a blast to the chest. He was shivering violently, and Tony drew him close, hoping the reactor powering his suit would help warm him a bit. "T-Tony, w-where is he? Where's P-Peter?"
Groaning, Peter tipped his head back against the seat, lolling it to look at Tony.  “Dad, it’s so obvious it’s like the two of you are walking around with cartoon bubbles above your heads!  You and Steve like each other!”
“Oh, nothing I wanna get into now, bud, okay?”  He stepped over to Steve, rising up onto his tiptoes for a kiss.  “Hey, hot stuff.  You doing okay?”
"Master Peter is not present, sir," JARVIS said. "I currently have his location marked at the school, but—"
the Chitauri!" stated Uncle Clint. "But I thought Tony blew 'em all to hell, so where the hell'd they come from?"
“Yes, Iron Man, I am,” Steve says in his Captain's voice, or at least what’s passing for his Captain’s voice at the moment.  “Because until I say otherwise, our mission isn’t over, which means that you're still obliged to follow my orders.”  He ducks down when Tony drops his eyes, refusing to let Tony break his gaze.  “Is that understood?”
son now?"
He had just set the suitcase down next to the doorway when he heard Peter yell for him from the living room, startling him. He wasn't used to living in a house where one could yell from room to room and still be heard.
Tony dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head.  “I can't tell you that either, bud.  Not yet.  Not till I get some stuff figured out first.”
A flush crept up Ned's tanned cheeks as he let out a slight cough. "Oh, she—she's good. We—you know, we're—we're hanging out… some, and—"
"Yeah, that too. But seriously, Steve, you know how perceptive he is, so he probably already knows or can guess most of what's going on, even if we don't wanna admit it."
"She won't find it," Steve cut in. "They're not gonna fire it again, not now when there's all kinds of eyes looking for it."
Returning to the Compound, they found Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky finishing their dishes in the kitchen after their own dinner. After showing them the ice cream, and sending a picture to Peter's dads, Peter and Gwen got to work on their dinner. Gwen turned out to be an excellent sous chef, something Peter probably should've figured out a lot sooner when she pointed out that she and her mom were tasked daily with feeding four hungry boys and men.
"I'll make sure you and your team receive a continuous feed on all incoming known casualties, Captain," the general said. General Arnold, one of few remaining top Pentagon officials, had been coordinating with the Avengers ever since their return to the Compound three days ago. "We sure do appreciate the help you've already given us."
But Steve only shook his head, pressing a soft kiss to Tony's collarbone. "Sleep now, mo grá," he whispered. "I've got you."
"Well, there's not really much else to do here," Peter said, barely stifling another cough. "But I promise I'll try."
"And we need to disperse them, Captain, as much as possible," said Thor. "The Chitauri are powerful and their reach is vast, so we must make it as difficult as we possibly can for them to obtain them all. This will also ensure us more time to study various methods of defence against them."
But apparently the twins, and Clint and Natasha, were settling in pretty well up at the Compound. The four of them had spent most of the summer on Clint's sister-in-law's farm in Indiana, returning to the Compound just before the start of the school year. Since upstate New York was a lot more like Indiana than Manhattan was, the team had decided that it would be best for Clint and Nat to take up year-round residence at the Compound so the twins could attend school up there.
But Flash only smirked, shooting Peter a rather maniacal grin as he took another sip from his cup, which Peter now realised probably had been spiked with something.
"Very good, sir."
"No, it doesn't!" Peter yelled, startling them both enough that he nearly knocked over Dad's coffee. He got to his feet, running his fingers through his hair as he paced back and forth. "Dad, there's no way that Gwen's father is a HYDRA agent, there's just no way! I'd know it if he was!"
"Oh yeah, you do," Bucky cut in. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a tin of the Altoids that he always carried—whenever he wasn't around Peter, at least—and tossed one onto Thor's lap. Bucky had loved peppermints for as long as Steve had known him, often buying bags of the brightly-wrapped candies at the corner store whenever he was able to save up the ten pennies he needed in order to pay for them. With Peter's sensitivity to peppermint thanks to his spider DNA, Bucky mainly stuck to cinnamon candies now, but Steve still remembered the day that he first asked for a peppermint as one of the biggest turning points in his recovery.
"Yeah, it does. Fuck, baby, you're so good," Tony whispered, his stuttered breaths hot puffs of air against Steve's cheek. "I swear this ass of yours was sculpted by the gods."
"Okay, so… then how'd you guys get away from… Knowhere?" Peter asked. "How'd you manage to escape?"
"Yeah, you'd think. But when has anything our government done ever made sense, hmm?"
"So, Peter," Mrs Stacy said once everyone had started eating. "Have you always lived in that huge Tower?"
Peter had told him during their very first visit. "
Especially since his last name happened to be Stark.
Tony smiled, reaching over to bop Peter on the nose. "If you can make it, I s'pose I can too, bud. But next year we're going to Italy instead. No more of this leaving one freezing cold place just to fly to another freezing cold place halfway around the world nonsense."
"Tony and I know that Peter has enjoyed himself as well," Steve said. "And for that, we thank you."
Peter shrugged, rubbing at his nose. "Well, yeah, but… nevermind. How was your day? Did you have another patrol today?"
Steve scoffed as he levelled his aircraft, his eyes sweeping his designated area for the rapid flares that indicated another missile launch.
"Now, Петр!" Bucky said as they burst from behind their barricade just as the enemy appeared on their left. Before Bucky had even gotten the words out, Peter was on his feet, launching his webs at the target's legs and yanking down, chattering nonstop about how he was going to show it who was boss. The target immediately fired its booster, attempting to break away with Peter still attached as Bucky took aim, taking it out with a single shot to its chest.
Setting down his StarkPad, Tony rubbed at his temples, trying to stave off the headache that persisted in taunting him. Steve had gone over to the residence about twenty minutes ago to make them some food, and while Tony wasn't hungry in the slightest, he knew that if he didn't eat, Steve would try and cut off his coffee intake, and that was simply unacceptable.
"Oh, really?" said Gwen. "And did your papa teach you how to make that too?"
“I would agree with that assessment, sir.”
"Yeah, Pete?" Tony answered as he tried to take a deep breath, his throat and lungs already burning from the stale, dusty air of the planet.
"Genocide," said Dr Strange.
His web fluid carefully packed into his backpack, Peter headed next for the kitchen, and the large vent cover behind the stove that led directly into one of the main ventilation shafts of the Tower. For some bizarre reason Uncle Clint seemed to enjoy climbing through the vents in the buildings sometimes rather than taking the elevators, which usually drove Dad bonkers, but the upside of it was that Uncle Clint had had Peter shadow him on his excursions more than once, so Peter pretty much knew how to get anywhere he needed to get in the Tower without having to use the elevators.
"Nope," Gwen deadpanned. "I was talking about Ned."
, Stevie, you are really way out of practise! I mean, that was like a primary school-level attempt back there, and from a guy like you—"
"Well, from the sounds of it, he tried to do the same thing he did to Barton here," said Tony, way too nonchalantly for Steve's taste. "Only it didn't work, so then he got all pissed off and threw me out the window."
"Seems like those Meridians aren't liking what we're hitting 'em with up here," said Mitchell. "How long do you think it'll be before we see some of their new hardware?"
"Tell you what?" Tony snapped. "Tell you that I managed to kill the Avengers because I didn't do enough to stop what's coming? Tell you that just about every goddamn night I see you lying on a battlefield, surrounded by our dead teammates, with your face all busted up and your shield broken in half? Tell you that as I check to see that if by some miniscule chance you're still alive, you grab onto my wrist, demanding why I didn't do more to stop it from happening? And then—oh God, Steve, and
A mission that proved to be futile, as minute after minute slowly ticked by. Steve watched through their bedroom windows as the stars moved across the sky, telling himself that he wasn't scanning for possible incoming attacks, but knowing he was only lying to himself. And then, as the first tiny slivers of light began to peek through the surrounding skyscrapers, he shifted again, carefully tucking the blankets up over Tony's shoulder before sliding out of the bed and padding towards the bathroom. He still wasn't planning to go running, as his foot did need the break, but there was no sense in just lying in bed when he wasn't asleep. Time was short, and there were plenty of other things he could be working on instead.
"Hey," he whispered. "Tell me what's going on."
Flew.
"There're worse things, Петр. Стив and Тони are two really good guys, you're all damn lucky to have each other."
Steve leaned closer as Peter shifted the laptop towards him, chuckling as he watched Clint wake up from his spot on the Compound's living room couch to find his entire complement of arrows arranged in a sort of elaborate pyramid shape across his torso, essentially pinning him to the cushions. It was funny, and something he could definitely see the twins thinking up.
"Code green for containment, and Helen's developed a sedative she says should be able to knock him out as long as we can get it into a large vein right away," said Tony. "And Nat's already volunteered to take care of it if it comes to that."
In his hand, Steve held his tiny sketchbook, flipped open to the drawing of Tony and Peter cuddled up on the couch in the Malibu house. He bit down on his bottom lip as he carefully traced the outline of Peter's round cheek, tears welling in his eyes as he recalled the moment that the sketch had captured. So soon after their return from Afghanistan and trying to deny his growing feelings, Steve had been almost overwhelmed with affection for the two of them in that moment, with Peter's head resting on Tony's chest and Tony's arms tightly around him, as though he had feared that even in sleep, his precious boy would somehow be snatched away from him.
Lang's jaw opened and closed as he tried to come up with a response, finally muttering a quiet, "Ah, sure. But if you're gonna ask me how the suit works or anything like that, I'm afraid I can't tell you."
"I'm fine," added Peter, rather petulantly. "I told you guys you don't need to worry about me."
As Uncle Thor put it, only Loki could cause so much trouble from a prison cell, but Peter also secretly wondered if Loki didn't just miss Uncle Thor from time to time, and therefore was making up problems just so he would come back to see him.
As the announcer finishes introducing the rest of the field, Steve presses his palms against his goggles again before covering his head with his second cap, a white one emblazoned with his name beneath the American flag.  He had at first been resistant to the idea of wearing two swim caps, as he honestly preferred to wear zero most of the time.  But since Coach Phillips nearly had a coronary when Steve suggested sticking with only one after his semi-final, he gave in.
Ever the gentleman, Steve insisted on coming around to Tony's side with an umbrella before they headed inside the hospital, the hallway dim and quiet as they made their way down to Peter's room.
"Yes, honey," Tony said, playfully rolling his eyes. "I'm not a complete invalid, you know. In fact, I'd still be working on my suit if it weren't for you."
“Oh, swimming is such a lovely sport!” exclaimes Mags.  She slides into the booth next to Tony, folding her hands as she regards Peter.  “You must tell me more, young man.  Why no more soccer, hmm?”
"Mmm. Then you damn well better take some notes, yeah, buddy?" Tony muttered from the table, his eyes still closed. "Or better yet, just ask if you can record the whole thing."
Like Dr Erskine had told Papa when he selected him for the SSR, maybe what they needed now weren't the big, strong heroes.
"N-no, thanks, I'll j-just t-talk to th-them tomorrow."
"If you knew my papa at all you would know that he tried everything he could to save as many people as possible on that day, and that he's felt guilty every single day since then that he couldn't do more," he said quietly. "Papa always says that in his line of work he tries to save as many people as he can, and that sometimes they can't always save everyone, but deep down it eats away at him so much that he can't. So maybe the next time your father starts ranting about the Avengers and how it's their fault that the aliens came in the first place, you can tell him that."
"All right," Steve murmured. "I love you."
something instead of just complaining all the time, it'd probably be done by now."
They would figure it out together, because they always had each other's backs.
"And once we do that, we're committed," said Peter. "No turning back."
He would gladly listen to Anthony's voice all day.
"And when I'm not telling you that stuff, I'm just supposed to sit here and listen while you complain about it? And then just nod and tell you it's normal?" Gwen continued. "Is that what I'm supposed to do? Well, I hate to say it, Peter, but I don't think I can do that. Because it's not normal. None of it is."
he cried out into the universe as he flopped over onto Steve's pillow, hugging it to his chest.
"You're very welcome," O'Brien replied. "Please give her my well wishes the next time you see her."
And of course, Toomes was absolutely refusing to say a word to anyone without having a ridiculous immunity deal in place first, which Steve was taking as a personal affront. He was so frustrated that he had already punched through the wall in Tony's lab once, and barely been halted by Bucky a second time.
Everyone was eager to reassume some level of normalcy after an entire year of absolute chaos. Or at least as "normal" as a team of superheroes could achieve while still being superheroes.
Tony Stark showing up to something like that by himself, right?”
Peter held up his hand, as if he could halt Dad’s dumb excuses right there from the hallway.  It was useless, and he knew it.  But the stubborn Stark in him couldn't help but try anyway.
"Yeah, Dad, I'm fine," Peter murmured, muffled against Tony's neck. “Papa's the one who's hurt."
“Nah, I can’t imagine someone who could recognise that book set getting into too much trouble,” Steve said as he rang up Peter’s stuff.  He grimaced slightly as the total appeared on the register, giving Peter a worried glance.  “All right, so with tax everything comes to $265.13.  Are you sure it’s still going to be okay with your father?”
Tony waited three heartbeats before carefully placing his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve flinched at Tony’s touch, but thankfully didn't try to jerk away, his entire body shuddering as Tony tightened his grip.
honey, we actually did it!”
As much as they both didn't want to admit it, Peter was no longer the tiny, sickly eleven-year-old kid that Steve first met in that awful desert. He was now a superhero.
"Language," Steve said automatically, chuckling when everyone except the three Guardians groaned and rolled their eyes. "All right, all right. Is it dinner time yet?"
"Uh huh. Love you."
"Tony, I said I understand." Steve cupped Tony's cheek in his free hand, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "I'm not going to let anything happen that might hurt Peter, all right?"
aspect of his husband's personality.
“Thank you,” Tony bites back.  He turns back to his armour without another word, his shoulders hunched so tightly they look almost painful.
"Copy that," Stacy said through yet another gunshot. "Most of the flying suits have exited the building, but we're still rooting out the rest of the ground personnel inside."
"Yeah… well… a little tinkering never hurt anyone," Tony said, his head bobbing his head back and forth. "Or at least not too much. Let me know once you're done with all of your inquiring, yeah?"
"Yeah," said Peter. "I'm pretty sure."
Three more tears tracked down Tony's cheeks, so salty and hot that they stung his skin.
"Thanks." Tony ran his fingers down his unkempt goatee, trying to concentrate on the fact that they were going to find Steve instead of the possibility that it might take another week, or even longer.
Everything looked the same as Steve and Tony made their way across the base to the hangar. They walked through the same hallways, passed a lot of the same cadets and airmen on their way back from various training exercises and missions. Even the hangar itself seemed the same, with the aircraft all lined up just like they always were, the din of their engines and the shouting back and forth of the various grounds people filling the air.
Uncle Bucky huffed, shaking his head. "I don't have to ask him. I already know."
"Okay, little guy," Steve murmured, hugging his son as tightly as he dared. "It's gonna be okay, I promise."
Pietro pursed his lips, but nodded anyway. "Aye, Captain. Understood."
"Yeah, I think so," Tony said. He climbed up onto the motorcycle behind Steve, wrapping his arms tightly around Steve's chest. "I'm ready, honey."
"He's choking on his endotracheal tube, Mr Stark!" Sharon said firmly as Steve drew Tony back a few steps. "If you'll just give me a couple seconds to remove it, he should be fine."
"Okay, but who?" asked Carol. "Do we know who this person is? And maybe more important, do we know where this person is now?"
Tony frowned when he heard what sounded a lot like Peter either crying or giggling into his elbow, he couldn't quite tell which.
"Thor, what just happened?" he whispered. "What—what—?"
"Here," he said as he handed the squishy, buttery soft hoodie to Peter. "If nothing else, it'll help keep you warm tonight."
"Yeah, that's true." Peter couldn't argue with that one at all.
"Very good, Captain."
"That's fine," Steve said, stuffing his own hands into his pockets. "As long as you're careful not to pull on any of his tubes, okay?"
"And he was, Mr Stark, until about an hour ago," Stacy said grimly.
"And Tony's car," said Steve. "That sounds good, Sam. Thank you."
"I'll take care of him," Steve gasped as he cradled Peter close, brushing the soaked hair from his eyes and kissing his forehead. Peter's skin was littered with scrapes and bruises and as cold as a metal flagpole, and his lips were an absolutely horrible shade of bluish-purple, sending a violent shiver through Steve as he draped him over his arm and clapped his palm between the boy's shoulder blades. Peter jerked three times before coughing up what seemed like more water than his lungs should be able to hold, gagging and sputtering before going completely limp again.
“Mmm,” mutters Steve as he fiddles with a loose corner of the apple juice label.  Natasha is right that he could use the money.  Even a couple hundred or so extra dollars a month would go a long way to paying down his mountain of debt.
"Солдат?" asked the colonel.
"I'm not—I'm not sure what you're implying, sir," he said, as politely as he could muster. "But if you're referring to the Battle of New York and the Battle of the Triskelion, my dad has been working very hard with the Department of Damage Control to make sure that those areas that were affected are being cleaned up as quickly and as safely as possible."
"Teddy bears are always good, Птер," said Bucky. "Can't usually go wrong with one of those."
"Not gonna say no to my favourite space heater," Tony murmured. He burrowed in a bit closer, closing his eyes as he wished that he could unsee the words JARVIS had flashed across his tablet screen while Steve's back had been turned.
Following the crowd off the ferry, Peter shuffled towards a row of novelty shops, ducking down behind the largest one and heading for the rocky shoreline. There he stripped out of his clothes, quickly downing the last of his Powerade before pulling out his web shooters and the repulsors. Then he buried the backpack underneath a couple of heavy rocks and pulled on his mask, allowing the adjustable eye frames to widen so he could get a visual on the prison.
But not this time.
Steve's chest heaved as he nodded, withdrawing his fingers. Then he slid a pillow under Tony's lower back and hooked his knees over his hips, leaning down to brush a soft kiss across his lips.
"Стив!" Steve suddenly heard Bucky yell, barely audible through the blood rushing past his ears, punctuated by the growl of the war dogs and near-constant machine-gun fire. "Стиви, c'mon! You gotta get up!"
his touch said. "
Unfortunately, while Adrian Toomes had been arrested on charges of doctoring official Damage Control books, they couldn't yet charge him with theft of government property because they had yet to actually recover anything that he'd been suspected of stealing. And, while the conversation Peter overheard indicated that Toomes had been speaking to someone who apparently didn't like Tony very much, they couldn't as of yet figure out who it was as all of Toomes' phone records were erased by an outside third party before he was even arrested, and erased so well that not even JARVIS had been able to recover them.
Steve grunted as he pushed himself up to a sitting position, his swollen right hand pressed against the broken ribs on his left side and his teeth tightly clenched against the pain shooting through his body like a million bolts of lightning.
"Okay, that's enough," Steve muttered as he raced towards the flagpole on the far side of his course, knocking it with his palm as he ran by. Bucky had once held many of the same fears as Steve, something he had confessed to Steve back when he realised he was starting to fall for Sam. Bucky had always enjoyed going out on dates, even when they were kids, but it hadn't been until Sam came along that he'd felt like he could actually see himself sharing his whole life with someone.
"Honey, you did it!" Tony let out a gasp, still trying to decipher the readings in front of him. "I'm looking at all the numbers now, and… oh gods, Steve, just get your ass back here, yeah? I really need to kiss you!"
"I'm not sure I would use the term, 'tinker'," said Dr Strange. "But yes. I can manipulate time to my advantage when necessary."
The look that Tony shot him, so full of anguish and self-loathing, was almost enough to cause Steve's heart to shatter right there in his chest, like a piece of porcelain dropped onto a concrete floor. He audibly gulped, his back as straight as an iron rod as he forced his swirling emotions back down into the pit of his belly, where they could continue their festering.
"I'm sorry, Mr Beck, but that's my final word on the subject," Tony said firmly. He got to his feet and held out his hand towards Beck, who looked as though he would rather spit on it than shake it. "I'll let you know when I've completed my analysis of the holographic system."
"That legislation was shot down for a very good reason," Peter said firmly, trying to stamp down his guilt. "The Avengers are not vigilantes."
he'd said, his eyes so lust-blown that the blue was barely visible. "
"Well, then you definitely could use some. But only after you go and find your engagement ring, okay?"
Just another terrible, awful, no-good nightmare.
"But—but,
"Thank you, Mr Chairman," Steve said softly. "It is still quite a painful memory, and one I don't particularly enjoy having to relive."
A knot rose in Tony's throat that he quickly tried to swallow down. In Langara, meeting the parents of your significant other was a pretty big deal, considered to be just a hair shy of a proposal. In all of his years of dating and messing around, Tony had never, ever been introduced to a partner's parents.
"You try and get some sleep tonight, bud, yeah?" Dad said. "You're looking pretty tired."
"His heart rate's a bit elevated, which isn't too surprising since we just moved him," Sharon said, removing her stethoscope. "It's something we should keep an eye on though."
"Yeah, yeah." Still running calculations through his head—all the better to avoid thinking about the fact that in about an hour Peter was going to be riding to his field trip on a goddamn
It also explained the intense stress that Steve had noticed in Anthony. He couldn't imagine the pressure Anthony was under with such a sick child, and, as busy as Steve imagined Anthony was, he also knew there was no way it could be easy for him to get away to visit his son before curfew.
Which they very well might've been, especially if Colonel Phillips had called ahead to warn them. But still… the thought that Peter had been forced to wait for almost eight years to have a life-saving surgery while numerous medical professionals were just sitting around on the off chance that an Air Corps member would become sick or injured… it just wasn't right.
"How you can talk about a literal god like he's just your goofy uncle or something," said Ned.
Steve's heart was in his throat as he silently counted the seconds down, finally ordering Bucky and Thor to back off just as Thanos was about ten paces away. Less than a second later, Thanos raised his arm, the red Reality Stone glinting brightly in the gauntlet as the entire plain transformed into the same apocalyptic landscape as before, revealing the yellow Soul Stone glowing beneath the surface.
"Hmph," Tony said, sniffing. He looked up at Steve, his brown eyes glassy. "It was the least I could do for the boy who saved my life."
into the search bar.  A few seconds later, Tony’s heart flutters as the search returns a series of videos, the first one being Steve’s Olympic qualifying race.
"Well, there ya go," said Rhodey. "See? The kid does have a plan."
JARVIS actually sighed. "Of course, sir. Master Peter's safety is always of utmost concern."
“No, it’s not,” answers Steve.  “Tony’s just entered the building, but… he seems to have vanished somehow.  I've got no eyes on him at all.”
This chapter has a bunch of pure, domestic Avengers fluff, one of my very favourite things to write.  I hope you all enjoy it!  💖
of a pair of hard-soled shoes on the floor. Peter froze, gasping as Gwen suddenly came into view, her green eyes going briefly wide before narrowing again.
"No, not exactly," Steve whispered, biting down hard on his bottom lip. "It was—oh God, it was even worse than that! It was—it was—"
"Um… are you actually asking me about my personal life, Colonel? Don't you know that's against Air Corps regulations?"
"Yeah, you did. Say, speaking of kids, has Sam been out to see Riley's wife and son recently? Just wondering how they're doing."
"Okay, let's see here…" Tony said as he skimmed over the introduction, finally getting to the main part of the proposal.
The grocery store was packed when they arrived, not too surprisingly since it was close to dinnertime. After picking up what they would need for the linguine dish Peter was planning to make, they headed over to the freezer section to check out the desserts. Peter was examining the selection of ice cream bars when Gwen suddenly burst out laughing from two doors down, pointing to the Ben and Jerry's section.
And according to Steve, it hadn't been any better with him.
Shaking his head, Tony crept closer to the platform. He could see Strange suspended in mid-air about one story down, surrounded by long silvery spikes. The goofy Squidward alien was standing in front of him, his hands clasped as he droned on and on about pleasing his master, or some other such nonsense.
"I swear to God, Сэм, if you don't—!"
Obie breathed in, smacking his lips.  “Are you absolutely sure about that?” he asked, so closely to Tony’s ear that Tony had to suppress a shiver.  “I'd hate for your math to be off.”
And if that were to happen to someone else, if Steve were to be responsible for a kid developing an injury like his, then…
"And have you ever met that Spider-Man dude?" the guy continued. "He was up there too, right? Is he any good?"
"Steve, you know the stones are destroyed, so this could be our only chance!" she exclaimed. "You know we have to try!"
Tony shouted, pushing back against Steve's chest. "I'm not gonna let you do it, Steve, so you just get that out of your stubborn head right the hell now!"
"No, no, I forced myself to go home and get cleaned up," answered Tony, laughing for the first time in he couldn't remember how long. "Those uniforms really are hideous, aren't they?"
"We should get packing, Tones," Rhodey said softly a few heartbeats later. "Pretend like it's one of your old Stark Industries business trips, yeah?"
Finally, James spoke up. "Well, there's no time like the present, right? So unless you think we need more training, which we don't, by the way, then I say we go tomorrow."
"No! Oh, God!" Steve screamed, his heart dropping to his knees as he watched his husband disappear below the surface. His cry of agony caused the creature to turn towards him and let out another roar, this one even louder and more bone-rattling than the first. Steve instinctively clapped his hands over his ears, sucking in a deep breath as he took off running towards the trees where his shield was stuck, managing to get there just before the thing swung again, hitting the trees and knocking the shield loose. Steve caught it and immediately launched it again, this time hitting the creature just below where its neck would have been.
"Yeah, but now Peter's not here anymore," Steve said, gasping as soon as the words left his mouth, the realisation hitting him like a machine gun blast to the chest.
They all loved him, and Steve knew that not a single one of them would hesitate to take care of both he and Tony if it ever became necessary.
"Home," agreed Steve.
No.  This was the type of cold that Steve
“Steve?  Cap, are you—oh holy shit!” Tony exclaims as he suddenly appears as if out of nowhere.  He kneels next to Steve, his gauntlets retracting as he reaches his hands towards him.  “Oh my God, Steve, you—your
Climbing down the stairs, Tony shuffled Peter over to stand with Rhodey and Thor as Happy led he and Steve over to the young, brunette woman casually leaning against their car, two folded up pieces of paper in her hand.
“Yeah, I do,” Papa said, his lips curling into a smile.  “And I’m glad too.  It lets me check on you before I go to sleep every night.”
"What were you working on?" asked Papa as he set Peter to chopping garlic bulbs and scallions for one of the Italian dishes he liked to make for Dad. Ever since he'd told his dads about the senate bill, Peter had noticed that Papa had been cooking almost all Italian dishes for dinner, almost as though he was afraid that he wouldn't get to for too much longer.
"I love you, sweetheart," he whispered. "I love you so damn much, and I—"
"Pete, I thought we've already talked about this," he said. "Papa and I said that there'd be no need for you to—"
He supposed he wouldn't have to wait too long for an answer.
"Exactly." Tony's lower lip quivered as he recalled Peter lying in that hospital bed as still as a corpse, completely unresponsive. It had been one of the worst things he had ever experienced with Peter, second only to when he stopped breathing out in the middle of the Afghanistan desert.
Peter huffed as he stuffed his sweaty, stinky gym uniform into his backpack and zipped it closed, taking extra care to not yank too hard on the zipper. He was already on his sixth backpack of the school year, having torn his last one only the week before, and it was starting to get more than a little embarrassing. Especially since Gwen seemed to take notice every time he showed up at school with a new one.
Rhodey grinned. "Oh, hell no. She sleeps like garbage on a normal day, so… maybe a couple hours or so, but she's always been like a ball of pure energy. I can barely keep up sometimes."
"Oh, then he's in for it," grumbled Bucky. "I was only late because he told me the wrong spot to meet him! I was sitting there all by myself in the dark waiting, while—"
"All right, you bastards," he muttered as he pulled up the Meridian hangar feed. "Let's see what else of mine you've stolen."
Sam let out a soft chuckle. "Hey, that kinda comes with the territory, doesn't it? At least we got to see the whole game."
"Mmm," Peter murmured. "My arm hurts."
"Absolutely, bud," Tony said as he kissed Peter's head. "No question about it."
"Hello, Gwen," answered Papa with a friendly smile. "How was your day?"
Gwen frowned, tilting her head. "There's no need to get defensive with me, Peter, 'cause I already know all this. I'm just relaying information here, okay? I know the only real interaction you've had with my father was at that one dinner, but—"
Steve sucked in a deep breath, his shoulders so rigid they were starting to ache. "Howard Stark was once a civilian scientist working for the Air Corps. He was responsible for the design of many of the aircraft flown up to and during the Battle of the Continents, and was also rumoured to be conducting research into alternative power sources due to the country's diminishing supply of palladium, the element utilised in our power plants. Approximately six weeks following the Battle of the Continents, Howard Stark was arrested on charges of treason. His trial lasted three years, after which he was acquitted and returned to his home."
"Yes, but I'm not exactly sure what you're getting out of this," Steve protested, rather weakly since Tony's magical fingers were still busy rubbing his scalp.
he thought as he rubbed at his aching temples.
He knew the answer, of course.  All he needed were the guts to take that final step.  He had told himself that he’d been waiting for the right time, when in reality, the right time had passed a long time ago.
"Then let me tell you all right now, that I believe that it is," T'Challa said.
"Thank you," he said as he caught an errant drop with his wrist. Even if Peter's resting vital signs were no longer considered normal for a boy of his age, it was comforting to know that at least one of the three of them was getting some halfway decent sleep.
Peter immediately choked on his mouthful of Dr Pepper, prompting Gwen to pound on his back.
"Yes, but you're still not," Steve said as his eyebrows knitted together in what Tony had already nicknamed his worry wrinkle. "You look worried, Tony. How can I help?"
At Tony's reluctant nod, Natasha scooted forward, allowing Steve to curl his arms around their sleeping son. Peter was apparently so out of it that he barely even wiggled as Steve situated him on his lap, burying his nose into their son's hair and holding him as if he feared it might be the last time.
"Uh huh." The delicious scents that'd been wafting up from the kitchen for the last twenty minutes or so were already making Peter’s stomach rumble, despite the fact that he'd just had a pretty big snack right before he got ready.
"Hey now, little guy. That's no way to be talking," Papa said sternly, pressing a kiss to the top of Peter's head. "I really hope that you're exaggerating here."
“My only attitude,
son, and Tony was not about to share him with anyone else.
"Yes, Senator?" Tony said, with as much false sincerity as he could conjure.
looks, but thankfully didn't press him.
"Nope," Gwen said, still poking around inside the freezer. She pulled out yet another carton, one that read Hulka Hulka Burning Fudge. "I think I'll go with this one. Do you think Dr Banner likes fudge?"
“On what?” Steve exclaims.  “What could you possibly have to work on down here that's more important than getting some sleep?”
"Yep."
"I have no intention of doing otherwise," Steve said softly, his heart fluttering when Tony grabbed onto his forearms, rolling onto his tiptoes to press a gentle kiss to his lips. It was chaste, and over far too quickly, but it was still enough to cause heat to pool low in Steve's gut.
"Right. And Captain, I totally get that," said Scott. "I would completely agree with you if I hadn't actually experienced it for myself."
"Oh, nah, not too bad," said Steve. "Mainly just going on about how we're all supposed to be on our best behaviour tomorrow. Apparently our new class is being taught by a civilian liaison instead of one of our own."
"Good," said Dad, just as Peter heard Uncle Bruce call out Dad's name in the background. "We gotta get going, bud, okay? We'll call again once we're on our way home."
"You know that the current continental power modules only have about five years left before they stop working, right? And that's only as long as they're able to keep up with the palladium mining requirements, which isn't exactly a given, so—"
Steve thinks as he pumps his arms, his lungs burning from the dry, freezing air.  He used to love it.  Used to love having snowball fights and going sledding down the nearby hill on his ma’s trashbin lid during the Brooklyn winters growing up.
"Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change, Stark, no matter the circumstances," said Dr Strange.
"I'm sorry it has to be this way, Maria," he said before turning and heading back down the walkway just as Tony let out another bloodcurdling scream.
"Somehow, I'm not quite sure that I believe you," Steve said, gasping when Tony sucked hard on the fragile skin of his pulse point, marking him. It would fade by morning, as they always did, but Tony still loved to see them on Steve's smooth, pale skin.
Ms Sharon's face fell, her eyes trained on her stethoscope bell.
"Tony!" Steve choked out as the pleasure ramped up to nearly unbearable levels. "Tony, I'm gonna—!"
"All right, fine. But I want a monitor on Pete the entire time I'm in there, understand?"
"Ahh… nevermind." Tony let out a grin as a thought suddenly occurred to him. "Hey, Thor, remember the last time we fought these assholes? The whole, 'doth mother know you weareth her drapes' dance we did in the forest?"
attempt to date anyone right now.  Not when his heart is even more battered and bruised than his shoulder.
"Easy, honey, okay? We're not in any hurry here."
"I am quite all right," T'Challa called back. He pushed himself up to his feet, nodding at Steve as he brushed the dust from his arms. "I am more than capable of taking care of myself, Captain. You and your team must be on your way."
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, his expression softening as he looked over at Steve, bathed in the moonlight streaming in through Peter's bedroom windows, the faint beams highlighting the lighter blond strands in his hair and causing his blue eyes to seem even more striking than usual.
"Yeah, okay," said Tony. "I've got a suit stashed in the SI jet anyway, and a spot in there for Rhodey's new suit. We can make it as incognito as possible."
Not even against HYDRA, the toughest challenge the Avengers had ever faced.
"Steve, it's okay," Tony assured him. "I'm here, aren't I?"
"Yeah, I know all about their goddamn protocols," he said. "I also know that if you or Phillips were in charge of everything instead of that asshole General O'Brien, things would be a lot different."
"It's gonna be okay, Buck. You're gonna be okay," Steve murmured as he carefully laid him down, stepping back to allow Sam to take his place at Bucky's side.
"Steve…
Peter nodded again, stepping around the hologram as he studied it while Tony watched him fondly. Peter had always been curious, to the point where it often got him into trouble when he was little, but the fact that he could simply look at a complex hologram and almost instantly understand it was something that both amazed Tony and filled him with pride at the same time. There was no doubt in his mind that Peter was someday going to change the world with his brilliance, and when that day came, he and Steve would be right there in the front row, cheering him on.
"And so does Dad," Steve said with a frown. "Because I know he didn't sleep hardly at all while I was gone."
“Tony!” he tries again as he drags himself across the frigid floor.  “Tony, please!  I need—I need—!”
"Well, for a girl we're gonna go with Aisling," Joseph answered, only a bit sheepishly as he removed his mask, allowing it to dangle off to the side. "And if it's a boy, he'll be called Steven."
"Don't worry about it," Uncle James said quickly. He lowered himself onto the hard chair next to Peter's bed, his face etched with trepidation.
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, blinking away the tears still threatening to fall. If anyone knew how relentless HYDRA could be, it was Bucky.
"No, not exactly," agreed Steve. "So how do we get around that?"
"I don't—I don't know. I've done—they've made me do so many terrible things. I've—I've hurt so many people… made them see their worst fears as if they were happening. If I were to ever go out there everyone would be afraid of me, so I don't think—"
It seemed like something out of a cheesy rom-com, but it seemed like as soon as he met Steve, everything in Tony's life started to look up. Peter was as stable as he could be, his work was going far better than he ever could've anticipated, and with the additions to the JARVIS program that Peter kept coming up with it was looking more and more like his plan for Project Phoenix was going to go off without a hitch, therefore bringing an end to over seven decades of war.
"So, what was Phillips going on about over there?" asked Sam. "He got his panties in a wad again?"
Obie, in what he probably thought was his infinite generosity, had informed Tony that he was giving him until next Friday to ponder how he was going to respond to the Board’s motion.  Which meant that Tony now had six whole days to decide to either give in to Obie’s demands and break up with Steve, or face the very real possibility that he would be voted out of his own company.
Gwen let out a giggle as they arrived at the doors, prompting Peter to make an attempt at a smile. Her laugh was one of the things that he liked about her the most.
"Carol? Are ya ready?"
"Uhh, hon?" Dad said as his helmet retracted again. "You got any idea what's going on?"
It was stupid, really, just how many people seemed to think that since Peter was only eleven—
Reaching for his water bottle, Peter chugged over half of it in just a few seconds, wiping his sleeve across his chin before tapping open the next file. He breathed in, letting it slowly out as he allowed his eyes to relax into their unfocused state so he could decipher the text.
And Brock is a nice guy, in his gruff, no-nonsense, take-charge sort of way.  Ma just hasn’t had the opportunity to spend enough time with him to see that yet.
“What in the goddamn
"Yeah, it kinda is!" Peter insisted. "Dad, Steve told me that he loves you! He told me he's in love with you, and—and—and you can't just throw all that away just 'cause you're mad at him! That would be so incredibly stupid, Dad, and you're not stupid!"
"Yes, you were. And it was stupid," Gamora said firmly. "But after what happened on Knowhere, we should probably start figuring out what we're gonna do once Thanos gets here."
"Ah, sure," Bruce said with a frown. "Except that since I'm not a complete sci-fi geek like you guys, I'm just gonna assume that we're all talking about the same thing here. Which means using the Quantum Realm as a way to search for one of the two universes where the outcome is a victory."
A feat that turned out to be a lot more difficult than Steve had anticipated as the clock dragged along towards 1900 at the pace of a drunken snail.  Only the arrival of three separate customers during the final forty minutes was able to give him something else to focus his attention on, even if the final customer, a late twenty-something or early thirty-something woman, kept trying to flirt with him.  It wasn't the first time that a customer had tried to wheedle her way into Steve’s personal life, but since this particular lady had borne a striking resemblance to Bonnie, his girlfriend during his final year of high school and the first girl he’d ever slept with, she had been particularly annoying.
"Well, good. I'm glad we've finally got that taken care of," said Colonel Phillips. "Now, if the two of you are done with your questions, I think we're ready to get started."
Which, at least from Peter's perspective, there seemed to be far too many. Aside from the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime before and during World War II, there was also the increasing hostility between the U.S. and Soviet Bloc countries that led to the weapons races that nearly bankrupted the economies on both sides before they were finally brought to a halt in the 1980's.
Tony's cheeks paled into that ashen, greyish colour that never failed to make Steve's heart skip a beat or three, as it always meant that he was either terrified, or horribly, horribly sick.
—finger, to Steve it also reminded him of what Mr Jarvis had often said to Tony, that hope was still stronger than fear.
"Copy that, Control."
He’d also managed to make it so far without having to add anything to his list, a feat that he considered miraculous given how nervous he was.
But he knew he couldn't say anything because then his cover would be blown. Dad and Pepper had finally been able to debunk the incriminating video that had been sent to the media just before they were kidnapped from the Tower, so it was even more important now to keep a lid on what had happened down in Miami or else the media scrutiny and government interference would just become unbearable all over again.
"Copy that, One," replied Barnes and Carol.
Not while his beloved man was up there alone in space, slowly freezing to death.
"Uhh… one of the guys that I've been working with the last few weeks. He's—he's one of the X-302 pilots."
"God,
"So, you think you're feeling up to moving again?" Tony asked after a couple of minutes. He was still combing his fingers through Steve's hair, which felt so incredibly good that Steve had almost managed to forget the very reason why they were now sitting in the middle of their bedroom floor.
"Okay, so… do you think that the project could work?" Tony asked. "Odds-wise?"
Tears stung Tony's eyes, and he quickly swiped them away. Why the hell would he even think that the military would care at all about what he was going through?
Steve's fingers at his sides twitched ever-so-slightly.
"Steady!" Steve warned, his belly giving a violent swoop as Thanos managed to get the surge under enough control to raise his arm.
But now the summer was coming to a close, and while there hadn't been any whispers of any newly developing threats as of yet, Steve knew it was only a matter of time before someone or something else came along and the Avengers would be called to action.
"Oh, yeah, there he is!" he exclaimed. "Hey, DUM-E! Good job there!"
"Yes," said Steve. "Those are the satellites that we'll be deploying, right?"
“Good,” Fury said, just before the screen went blank.  As soon as he was gone, Tony stumbled backwards, barely grabbing onto the edge of the counter before his legs gave way and he crumpled into a heap on the floor.
He was silenced by Steve's fingers, brushing softly across his lips. "No apologies, okay?" he whispered. "I love you."
"I can assure you that Peter will be well taken care of, young lady," Papa said in his Captain's voice. "Now, is there someone we can call for you?"
“You're right, Tony, you're right,” he said quietly.  “Just so long as you remember that we’re a team.  There's nothing we can’t do as long as we stick together, like your father and I.  Howard and I worked really well together, so there’s no reason why you and I can’t too.  Right?”
"Sounds good."
"Peter, another time, okay?" Papa said, giving Peter's hair a ruffle. "In fact, why don't you come and help me get dinner started while Dad works on Uncle Thor's new eye, okay?"
Hank Pym, a man Tony had grown up despising thanks to Howard's influence, had felt it necessary to essentially blackmail some no-name cat burglar into trying to steal from the Avengers' Compound.
"Gods, you're incorrigible," Tony rasped. "Like,
He’s not sure how long he sleeps the second time.  Or the third, or even the fourth.  But by the time three days have passed and no help has come, Steve is about at his wit’s end.  He’s so cold that his limbs feel frozen in place, he has maybe one or two sips of water left, and with no books to read or drawings to sketch, the constant pins-and-needles sensation of his healing leg has become so all-consuming that he feels like he’s going mad.
" Tony said as Steve started trailing soft kisses across his cheek and down to his neck, latching onto his pulse point. "Please, just—"
"You're here," Steve murmured as his movements grew more frenetic, more frantic, the grip on Tony's hip tightening. "I can feel your heart beating."
, and I'll need you to help me stay warm."
"Accuracy is now to within 0.00001%, sir," JARVIS said. "And I do not believe it is possible to improve upon that."
"Yeah!" Peter exclaimed as much as his waterlogged lungs would allow. "I haven't talked to him in ages!"
"Especially history that he didn't get to live through," added Gwen. "Yeah, I bet he was excited."
"Uh, yeah," another voice suddenly said, one that caused Tony's heart to jump into his throat as Peter—his very own Peter—came into view, dangling upside-down from the top of the ship. "And speaking of loyalty…"
"Yeah, but only 'cause you still owe me for the last one, Sheppard," said Cam. He rolled his eyes, quickly downing the rest of his beer. "But now that Rogers is here, I'm thinking that he can cover the next round."
Davis's large nose gave a twitch. "Yes, well, it did seem as though things finally went your way at that point, isn't that right, Captain?"
"I love you so much, sweetheart," he whispered once they were back in the bed, with Tony's head pillowed on Steve's chest. "Sleep now, okay? I've got you."
Bucky immediately rolled his eyes. "You really don't miss a thing, do ya? We were gonna tell everyone once we all sat down."
Tony gave a quick nod. "I build them into each of the Avengers' uniforms, so if Pete built himself a suit he probably put one of 'em in there."
Steve thinks for a few seconds, then shakes his head.  If what Lorraine said about the kid recognising him is true, then the last thing Steve wants to do is be a jerk to him in return, like some athletes tend to do.
"Whatever you say, honey," Tony mumbled into his pillow, his muscles already turning to mush. The bruises that he'd had on his back from the Hammer suits had taken a pretty long time to heal, with new ones emerging as the older ones faded, but they had all finally disappeared during their first week in Ireland, so while Tony didn't think Steve needed to be as careful as he was, he wasn't about to complain about the way his husband's hands were currently running across his body.
“So, have you ever set a leg before?” he asks, trying so hard to sound casual, and failing so spectacularly that he lets out a choked-off laugh, causing Tony to raise his eyebrows.
“No, goddamnit!” Tony cries.  “For Christ’s sake, Steve, can’t you just leave me the hell alone?  I’m trying to work here!”
go on the record and say that if anything happens to you, that it will not only destroy me, but Pete as well, so you'd better make damn sure that it doesn't. You got that?"
Steve shot up in bed, still clutching Tony's pillow. "And why would he do that?"
"You're exactly who I want to be with," Steve had reassured him. "And I don't care what anyone says."
"Hey, Cap, why don't you let me take the stick for awhile, hmm?" Sam said as he dropped into the copilot's seat next to Steve. "You've been at it for almost twelve hours already, I'm sure you could use a break."
A sudden knot rose in Tony's throat, and he gave a slight cough, trying to clear it. If Steve only knew a fraction of how worried he had been, how scared he'd been that he might never see him again…
