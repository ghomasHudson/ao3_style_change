“What,” he grumbles loudly, and smirks when the room erupts in hushed giggles, the mattress dipping all over as half a dozen baby Avengers arrange themselves around him.
This, Tony thinks as he leans back into Steve’s chest to watch the rest of his family collectively lose their shit over their new member, is so damn good for his ego.
“I’m, uh-- I’m just gonna take Bucky trick-or-treating around the neighborhood,” Steve finally says, when his face feels normal again. “What about you?”
Steve blushes prettily, and then looks around at the boxes scattered around the room. “Alright, so where do we start?”
Tony just grins down at the baby. “Papa’s just cranky ‘cause he hasn’t had a good chance to hold you all day."
Rhodey huffs out something that, on any other day, might have been laughter. “He’s always been like that. Always. But you should tell him when he wakes up,” he says, patting Steve’s shoulder.
“I meant every word I said when we first talked about it; the grounds upstate... they’re perfect. It’s a good, sound plan. And it’s not like we’re never coming back, right?”
“Are you gonna let me get a burger, big guy?” he asks Steve, but the blond shakes his head. “Steve--”
“Better than last year?” Tony mutters, and the dimness of the room isn’t dark enough to hide the sight of Steve Rogers rolling his eyes as he elbows him.
“...Can dey live here with us?” She finally asks, a proud grin on her cherubic little face, and Steve feels happiness rush through him like sunlight, feels his heart close to bursting with love for the two people in front of him.
Prompt (ask on tumblr): "GIVE ME A REASON IS MY STONY ANTHEM AND I WOULD JUST DIE IF YOU COULD MAYBE PLEASE WRITE A LITTLE FICLET INSPIRED BY THAT IT'S JUST SOMETHING I NEED."
“I’ll get you one after,” Steve says, and turns Tony around to face him. The warm, smoky air in the room just makes him more gorgeous, and Tony bites his lip to keep from groaning at the unfairness of it all. “But only after we dance a couple’a sets, ‘cause I’m feelin’ a little ignored, Stark.”
– and the next, every machine in the room goes off, lights blinking brighter than they’ve been all week. A room full of doctors and nurses come flooding in to shoo him out, before Tony’s mind can even register what’s happening.
“But, um,” Steve says tentatively, curling his shoulders in almost imperceptibly. It’s almost like he’s... nervous. “If you ever want to... well, sit in again, I’d-- we, we’d be more than happy to have ya.”
,“ Tony growls, but whips around to face the doors when they open, and at the faint sound of his team in conversation, he takes a step back.
“You think you’re man enough to judge someone who’s given blood, sweat and tears for this city?” Steve keeps cold, steely blue eyes on the reporter. “Come up here and say what you just said again, right to my face. Or better yet, pour your own blood, sweat and tears out there, and then come tell me the same thing.”
] I almost threw him off the roof once, after he saw it the first time– wouldn’t stop humming the ‘Do-Re-Mi’ song. If he starts again, I’m suing.
,” Tony winces, looking down at the sharp point digging into his ass. “Shit, I’m on top of your sketchbook, I’m ruining it.”
, okay,” Tony groans. pulling himself up until they’re face to face, sharing one of the many pillows scattered around the bed. “What’s up, buttercup?”
“I know!” Tony cuts him off loudly, but the gleam of amusement in his eyes tells Steve he’s not as bothered as he sounds. “Stand down, soldier.”
Steve doesn’t say anything, and he’s still holding the sketchbook so hard, his knuckles are white. “He’s always wanted one,” he says, and Tony grins because just like that, he knows he’s won.
“You don’t gotta sound so enthusiastic,” Steve laughs, but when they walk out their door, his hand is warm and perfect around Tony’s.
“Clint Francis Barton, if you finish that sentence, I swear I will put you on truck-wash duty,” Steve says loudly, eyes not leaving Tony’s.
Tony’s lips curl up into a wicked grin, and Steve feels his face begin to burn even more before he’s even said a word. “I like the view from behind. Those suits make your ass look--”
“Uh, Macaroni and cheese,” he says, but it comes out more like question, and Clint sees the brunet’s eyes go wide in what might be panic. They both know Cap’s not going to buy it.
“I’ve got Chris and the legal team on hold,” she points to the bluetooth speaker attached to her ear, and then gently sets her folder and bag on the table by the lavish chaise lounge. “Neither of us are leaving until he gives us the get go, is that clear?”
“Shouldn’t-- shouldn’t you be, y’know, saving this for the vows?” Tony doesn’t hide the way his voice breaks, but Steve just keeps smiling.
“If you don’t start talking,” he says, “or doing anything, really— you’ll see how quiet I’m actually not. I could probably start screaming, but I’m pretty sure you didn’t put me so close enough for anyone to fucking hear me.”
“Yeah,” Steve replies, but he’s fidgeting beside Tony– all hunched shoulders and hesitant baby blues– and he has yet to pick up the needle. “I’m just…”
“So how was Papa’s day?” Tony asks, casually shoving an entire chocolate muffin into his mouth. Their daughter takes one look at him and does the same with her own banana nut muffin, cheeks bulging adorably like a hamster.
“Nope, no like. Zero like,” Tony shakes his head, and feels his traitorous heart skip a beat when he feels Steve’s laughter brushes across his face. With Steve sitting on the edge of the seat, his height is closer to Tony’s than usual; it just makes it all the more harder to ignore the crooked quirk of his lips, the bright, blue eyes dancing with mirth, or the faint Irish freckles on his cheeks and nose.
“Only half?” Pepper scoffs, but doesn’t move to take it from him. “Whatever makes you feel better, Tony.”
“Hell yes,” he whispers, and when he grins Tony seriously has to wonder if he’s ever seen anything more perfect.
“Shut up,” Tony grumbles, even as his eyes are drawn back to what he’s been trying to ignore all lunch. Fucking Steve and his fucking gorgeous smile…
He doesn’t even bother hide how his hands tremble as he stumbles back to Steve’s room. Barnes stands tensely by the window, and turns to Tony when he sits down beside the bed. The silence returns, light and heavy all at once, until–
Steve is jerked from the book he’s reading as the sound of his boyfriend’s voice, and doesn’t even have time to say a word before Tony plops himself onto his lap. Steve’s arms move on reflex to wrap themselves around his waist, book forgotten on the table next to them, and he brings him close until their chests touch. “Doin’ what?”
Tony’s laughing so hard now, he’s leaning back into Steve to keep from falling. “Fucking Christ,” he wheezes, wiping tears from his eyes, “How did I not notice you were wearing this when we went out?”
“Why not? You’d make a good owner,” she says, and Tony laughs so hard he has to put coffee down to keep it from spilling.
Almost immediately, he’s pulled into a warm embrace, and he buries his face into the familiar chest just as he makes sense of the words being whispered into his ear.
“Nope, not right now,” Tony tuts, curling further into him. “I’m freezing my ass off, and you’re just about the warmest thing in here.”
“Zip it, mister. I just thought…” Steve shrugs, but trails off as he leads Tony out the ballroom and into the chilly night, through carefully trimmed shrubs and leafy walls covered in flowers and fairy lights.
“Obviously,” he grins. “It’s the least you could do after dragging me out of bed to walk a cat. Jesus, it’s so fucking ridiculous…”
“Do you--” Tony swallows the lump lodged tightly in his throat, and takes a deep breath. “Do you have any fucking idea the kind of shit you put us through?”
“What happened?” she asks immediately. “Do we need to call the lawyers, or the police? Tony, what's wrong? What did you do?”
is the very definition of hole-in-the-wall, sandwiched between a shady-looking delicatessen and a cluttered little dollar store, but the first time Tony’d gone past its vibrantly decorated sign and windows filled with stacked up pet-pens, it’d caught his attention.
“I just...” Steve finally looks up, nose brushing Tony’s jaw with every breath he takes. “It’s been a while since we’ve been able to relax like this.”
Steve spares him a long, deep glance before looking back at the road, and there’s a smile on his face Tony doesn’t think he’ll be able to get rid of.
“We had t’do it b’cause--” Barnes hiccups, face pressed against a cell bar, and waves his hand in Rhodey’s direction. “
Steve laughs even as he rolls his eyes, and as he watches Tony fall asleep, his lips quirk up into a smile he knows will stay all night.
"I’m happy enough watching you hold her, y'know,” Steve says. “I think I could do it for the rest of my life. ” He falls gently on the bed, turning sideways, and Tony follows wordlessly, nestling their baby between them. She squirms and whimpers for a second or two, but then falls right back to sleep with a sigh.
Steve’s eyes widen, bright and soft as the morning sky beyond the walls of the Tower, and he looks down at the mess in his hands. “Sorry, I just–”
“Hey, whoa,” Tony sits up, pausing the movie to look down at the blond. “No, what’s… okay, talk to me. What’s that supposed to mean?”
Because Steve didn’t come alone, and the sight of their daughter dozing peacefully on his shoulder, golden curls– the same shade as her father’s– covering half her face, makes him warm all over.
“Sure, come on. Who wants some help from Buck?” he calls, and then gestures him over when Sam raises his hand. It’s another hour before Tony calls them over for lunch, and Steve herds them in and out the elevator with a conspiratorial wink that sends his little crowd into titters.
“You could, uh... You could come with us?” Steve blurts out, because Tony’s eyes suddenly aren’t as bright anymore, and the thought of Pepper sitting home instead of being out just feels
“Yeah yeah,” the brunet sighs, giving him a fond eye roll, but he’s still smiling as he looks back down. “Daddy’s just being boring right now, princess, but I swear he’s not that bad--”
“I feel like... maybe none of that matters to you,” Steve says, and when his chin trembles, Tony just breaks all over again.
“‘Kay,” she replies, and waves the kitten while making airplane noises the whole way there. “Daddy?”
The white ball of fur at Tony’s feet just scampers in circles around him, yipping out little barks of approval even as the sky keeps pouring outside the gazebo they’ve found themselves under. “No, Ellie, baby, stay inside. Mommy will kill me if you get wet.”
Steve, the bastard, just sits across from him, and holds out the Spaghetti plate. “Take however much ya want.”
“Alright I gotta– where the fuck’s my– I gotta go, shoot’s running late,” he says, scrambling to find his phone and sunglasses. Everybody just snickers in response, and he has no idea why until Steve just grabs Tony’s wrist as he’s rushing past and–
“You’ll have what everyone else is having,” he tells Barnes, yawning as his teammates scramble off the bed and line up in front of him. It’s only then that he realizes he’s one short. “Where’s Rhodey?”
Tony’s laugh is rough and broken, without a single shred of humor. “Goes to show how little he knows, huh?”
This is different, he thinks, as he stares at the baby girl sleeping comfortably in the crib in front of him. She’s hardly making a noise except for the occasional sniffle or the rustling of her onesie as she moves a tiny limb almost imperceptibly.
“Thor, don’t go too far! Clint, that snow’s not for eatin– Rhodey, don’t let go of Bruce’s hand, okay?”
Natasha’s lips quirk up into something that could almost be half a smile. “We’re actually fourth in the district.”
“Hell if I know,” Tony scoffs, and then he grins playfully. “If I weren’t such a cynic, though, I’d say it’s destiny.”
“Mommies take care of us,” Bucky explains, with another decisive nod. “Mommies cook y’food, a-an’ dey give you baths—“
“Yeah, Papa’s my iced venti Cap,” Tony winks at Steve, who rolls his eyes even as he feels his ears start to burn. “But you’re my little one,
“Hey,” he waves a hand in the blond’s general direction. “If y’keep lookin’ at me like that, ‘m gonna think y’did this on purpose.”
thing to do, and it’s so like these two to rub off on each other so much, after all the time they spend together.
Steve’s heart skips a beat, and he grins as he meets warm, brown ones. “Yeah?” he whispers, but Tony shushes him dramatically.
“Well ain’t you a sweetheart,” Tony breathes, slipping a finger under the lid to swipe a generous amount of the frosting, and Steve almost swallows his tongue when the brunet proceeds to lick it off his finger. “Thanks, cupcake,” he says after, reaching up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek.
“Heya, Cap,” Tony can’t help smiling, and even with his eyes barely open, Steve smiles back, a thin quirk of his lips that nevertheless helps to lighten the heavy weight on Tony’s chest. “You okay?”
“How ‘bout I just call you mine?” Steve asks, mouth brushing against Tony’s cheek with every word, and Tony bites his lip to smother the pathetically giddy smile threatening to break out.
Steve rolls his eyes even as he feels his cheeks grow warm. “Just shuddup and watch the door, will ya?”
Tony shakes his head. “’s why he has Ir’n Man,” he pokes the helmet splayed out on Steve’s shirt. “They fly t’gether.”
Steve’s hand is comfortingly warm on the small of his back, and like he’s done countless times before, Tony revels in it. “You’re never gonna let that go, are ya?”
“I heard jet skis,” Barnes’ head pops up from inside, and both he and Sam are running off the patio seconds later.
“Jesus,” Tony groans. “We’re gonna laugh about this later, really. But trust me, you need to meet him.”
Tony just nods, and noses the fabric of Steve’s shirt once, then again, before laying his head back down. “You know we’re not moving for the rest of the night, though, right?”
She enters the kitchen on a Saturday morning, and is not surprised to see Steve standing by the coffee maker-- he’s one of the earliest risers she knows, and like her, it’s clear that he appreciates the way the world feels when the day’s just beginning-- but she is surprised that he’s the only one there.
Steve doesn’t. Instead, he pulls his boyfriend’s thin, limp body on top of him, settling the warm covers around them. “No, I think this is better, don’tcha think?”
“It’s about to pull me back!” She tells him. “I’ll be fine, though! You’re on the other side, I’ll be okay!”
"Like I said," Tony chuckles, and leans up on his tiptoes to brush his lips against Steve's cheek. "Batshit crazy."
“God, you’re really are crankier than the kids. I was hoping the pancakes would take care of that...”
Tony feels his heart skip one beat, then another, but he reaches out and takes the note with a steady hand.
“Me too,” Steve says softly, leaning against the elevator wall as it brings them closer to their floor.
” Tony warns, and when Rhodey sees the smile on his best friend’s face when Steve just giggles in response, he thinks the magazines might not be completely wrong.
It’s only a short press of lips, softer and more chaste than any kiss Tony’s ever imagined his first kiss with Steve would be. But it’s absolute
“That’s good, right? The whole point of this is to get people to vote for me.” Steve looks so damn hopeful, Tony’s heart skips a beat.
“Then it’s time for a nap, I’d say,” Steve decides, and moves the tray to the beside table before tucking himself under the covers beside his family. “You too, mister,” he nods at Tony.
“Doesn’t hurt to double check,” Steve smiles, boyish and rogue, and god, Tony falls in love with him all over again.
“Oh my god, why are you doing this to me?” Tony groans, wiping his tears. “This is your fault, y’know– I’m a fucking mess because of you.”
“Is there anything we should know about when you… disappear?” Coulson cuts in. “Anything we should be ready for?”
“My poor girl, come here,” Tony cuddles her when Steve lets her go, shushing her when she sniffles. “I got you, princess. Let’s take a nap, hmmm? And Papa can go make us some yummy snacks to feel better?”
Steve opens his eyes at the sound of Tony’s voice, lifting his head from his pillow just enough to send the brunet a smile. “Hi.”
Mr. Rogers, all six feet two of blond, muscled perfection, is weaving through the crowd of easels where his students are all primly seated, engrossed in their paintings. He moves in time with the rhythm, smiling and offering comments of encouragement-- at least that's what Tony thinks, from the way each kid smiles after he passes. It’s such a contrast to the sort of organized chaos in his room that Tony can’t help but be impressed.
“No surprise,” Bucky mutters beside Steve, viciously stabbing at a chicken nugget with his spork. “Fucking assholes.”
The woman standing next to him, all bright red hair and crisp suit lines, sighs into her hand. “Tony, can you just… This is a
“Yeah? What’re you drawing?” Tony asks, and watches with rapt attention as Steve suddenly can’t meet his eyes. “Oh, hey, whoa, is it... is it me?”
“I’m not,” Steve says loudly, and then looks surprised at his eagerness. “Shit, sorry. That... gosh, that was loud, wasn’t it? Sorry--”
Steve nods, and his hair looks so soft, Tony aches to run his fingers through it. “I’ve got enough to keep me warm nowadays.”
"I’m so glad you’re okay,” Steve blurts, and doesn’t wipe the lone tear that finally manages to escape from the corner of his eye. “Don’t ever do that again. Please.”
“Rockin’ the wet t-shirt look though, Stark,” Natasha says, walking past them with a bowl of fruit salad she sets down on the large patio table already teeming with food.
“Uh huh,” she nods, and holds up her finished product shyly. It’s covered in every shade of pink he owns, and although the skill is obviously child’s-level, it’s also very carefully made; every pink border and heart sticks on the card with little traces of glue peeking out.
“Where’s Steve?” he asks immediately. “Is he still here? You didn’t send him off, did you? He told me he wouldn’t leave--”
by leaning in to press a kiss to his cheek. It’s warm and short, and Tony will deny the way his knees go weak until his dying day.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “It’s my turn. The house in Malibu, the mansion in Manhattan. They were huge, and they were flashy, but that… that was all Howard. You know that. And I used to feel so fucking alone. I loved my Mom, but they were
Tony nods. “Not gonna work, though. We’re staying here if I have to tie you to the bed-- and not in the fun way,” he adds, wrapping his arms and legs around as much of Steve as he can.
“Ten hours!” Their daughter squeals, lifting her head up to face Tony with large, familiarly blue eyes, and Tony’s heart gives a happy lurch when Steve leans over to kiss her cheek with a laugh.
Steve takes a deep breath, and squares those broad, beautifully painted shoulders. “Okay,” he finally says. “I’m ready.”
Awareness comes slowly, settling over him like a soft, comfortable blanket, but he immediately knows he’s not alone.
“I can still remember exactly what she looked like. She was so beautiful. Most of the time, she looked tired, and a little sad, but she was always beautiful. I needed her so much– I still do. And now… every time I think about her, it’s like… like I can’t breathe. Sometimes,“ Steve looks up, and Tony’s heart breaks again at the pain in his eyes. “Sometimes I feel like maybe I’d rather forget– forget her, forget Bucky, forget everything. Because it hurts.” The last word comes out quiet and broken. “But I don’t want to. I love them… I always will, and I can’t do it without them. I don’t know what’d be worse, anyway.”
“Alright,” he announces, when the minivan– and thank every fucking god this spell is only temporary, because if he thinks about what he’s driving any longer, he might get hives– finally stops in the semi-crowded parking lot of
“Better turn the music up, then,” he says loudly, and just barely gets to wink at them all before Steve’s drags them out the apartment. “God, I love it when you get all hot and bothered.”
He does his run a little faster, partly because he’s feeling particularly energized, but definitely because he wants to be there when Tony wakes up.
“I better get on that, then,” Steve grins. “Can I, uh...” he jerks his head in the direction of the elevators, and Tony’s heart gives a happy little lurch when he realize what Steve’s asking.
“Sap,” he whispers, resting his head on the blond’s shoulder even as he continues to chew on his burger. “I can’t believe you lied in there to play hooky.”
Tony nods, and even though he can still hear Pepper running damage control across the room-- even though he can feel uncertainty and apprehension clouding his mind-- when he catches sight of the gleaming band around his ring finger, he welcomes the soft, warm tendrils of anticipation.
“Give it here, then, I’ll do it for you,” Barnes holds out a hand expectantly, and Clint hands over his mug with a glare at Tony.
His mother shakes her head. “Handsome. So handsome, my goodness. Come,” she gestures at the sofa along the wall. “Tell me all about you--”
Tony can’t keep his face from growing warm, or his lips from quirking up into a disgustingly happy little smile when he sees Steve look down shyly.
“I lost count of how many I made, but if coffee’s what you want, then… I guess I’ll just eat them all. Want some, Tony–”
“Unless the scans show something I haven’t caught,” Steve replies, “he should be good to go. Can’t fall asleep for a couple’a hours, though– it was a pretty nasty concussion.”
"I sure hope our daughter doesn’t get her manners from you,” Steve mutters, pushing the door to their bedroom open and dropping the carrier by the bed.
” Tony snarls, and maybe he’d feel bad about the hurt look in those blue eyes, if he weren’t cold and tired and
“I dunno why I even called you,” he says, still glaring weakly as Tony proceeds to take photos of him from several angles.
“Mmhmm,” Tony nods, and relishes the feel of Steve’s lips as they caress his jaw. “Think you can handle it, Cap? Or is it too...
Natasha lets out an uncharacteristic giggle, and even Dr. Banner– curled up in a recliner by the corner– snorts softly into his book.
“It’s six thirty,” Steve rolls his eyes, but burrows them further under the covers. “I think I’ll stay here today, though.”
“My plane, my schedule,” Tony waves his hand lazily. “I will go when I’m good and ready, Captain Rogers.”
“–you can’t seriously be bringing that up now,” Steve says firmly, but his eyes are bright with humor.
“Love you too, darling,” Tony sighs, and then there is nothing, as the silence settles over them like the warmest blanket of all.
,” Tony insists, almost stumbling over the weight of the blond as they walk towards the rest of the team.
“You might need another one of these, then,” Steve holds up the tray, and Tony takes one with a smile.
” Steve groans, holding his clipboard over his face to hide his blush. “You can’t possibly be like this all the time.”
“Virginia. Potts,” she replies. Her smile is friendly and professional all at once. “And don’t let him talk you into anything, either.”
Steve takes a deep, readying breath, and starts walking toward him. “I... God, if that’s what I think it is, I might go crazy if you actually make me wait,” he laughs a little wetly, fingers fiddling in front of him as he gets closer and closer.
“Back atcha, Winghead,” is all Tony can say. He closes his eyes, breathes in the clean, surprisingly woodsy scent of Steve’s uniform, and then moves away. “Now chop chop. I’ve got a company to run and you’re just taking up all my time-- really, Rogers, you’re a menace.”
“It’s a fucking week till Christmas and I’m--” Tony’s mouth snaps shut with a click of teeth, followed by a brittle curve of his lips. “You’re a tough nut to crack, Cap,” he says eventually, and Steve wonders if he can feel the way Steve’s heart suddenly feels like it wants to beat right out of his chest.
“If I didn’t know you better, mister, I’d believe you,” Steve chuckles for a few seconds more, before his eyes soften with earnestness. “But we know there’s more important things still keepin’ us here.”
“I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean for it to sound rude.  But, jesus, I’d definitely know if Hamlet was gay, right?”
Rhodey cocked his head to the side, for a second, thinking.  “There was an SI code in his file.  Rogers, I mean.  I obviously don’t know what it is.  But it looks kinda like a QR or something.”
He'd miss the way Steve would wink at him before stealing Clint’s yeast rolls right off his plate while he was hotheadedly arguing with Natasha.  He’d miss the way only Steve could manage to make a “Yes Ma’am” or a “No, Sir” sound like a reproach, a commendation, or a pick up line, depending on the smallest inflections. The way he could work every modern gadget he'd ever come across except the microwave.
“Well, I’ll be.” Tony turned to Steve. “Ok.  You.  So.  You speak French? Where’d you pick that up?”
He exited the apartment, stopping for bagels on the way to school.  He grabbed a dozen.  Their friend group wasn’t quite that big, but Sam, Steve, and Rhodey could always eat.
“So Tones, what possessed you to kidnap a giant, huh?” Rhodes asked.  Behind him, Steve came down the stairs, carrying what looked like a pitcher of that lemonade. Rhodey tracked Tony’s eyes, turning around to see what had caught his attention. “Oh, nevermind.  I know exactly what possessed you. Tall, blonde, and built, huh?”
Tony shook his head, mockingly.  “You’re the worst.  I can’t take you anywhere.  Dad jokes, Rhodey.  You’re not even forty yet. And you don't have kids! Where did you even pick that up?”
Steve reached for the glass in Tony’s hand, eyes wide and innocent—“For me? You are the best boss”—and downed the glass in one swallow. “Wow. You know, you told me this was going to be amazing, and you’re right.  You really know your whiskey.”
Taking out a specialized unit.  An essential step in order to lay the groundwork for a future something.  Job?  That seemed a little weird, and more organized than he was used to seeing in a lot of the smaller warlords.  The other voice on the call seemed somewhat familiar, but that could just be his brain playing tricks on him.  It wasn’t like he knew a lot of people who might be involved in these kinds of deals.  He didn’t recognize Raza, he didn’t think, but the video quality was shitty and the small screen of the phone didn’t help.
Was this how the superrich lived? A giant tumbler of scotch for lunch? “Iced tea, Ma’am,” he supplied, bewildered. “With a slice of lemon.”
Steve’s face went still. “He won’t touch you.  He won’t.” His tone dropped. “I’ll tear him apart if he tries.” Tony believed him. Completely. Steve addressed the other two. “Stane has some sort of electronic taser or something. Tony?”
Steve sat in the corner of the bed, holding Bucky’s hand as he slept it off.  It had been a bad night. Alcohol had always fueled bad dreams for Bucky. He knew it, but he’d been so devastated yesterday it hadn’t mattered.  Turned down by the VA.  No real answers, just a vague dismissal from the program.  Natasha had apparently left.  Packed a bag and taken off.  Her stuff was mostly still around, and Steve had a feeling she wasn’t gone for good, but Buck had been too distraught see anything with a clear eye.
Pepper turned to him, surprised. “Tony added that one when Happy and I went down to see him. Otherwise you’d just have me and him.” She smiled at him and straightened his tie.  “He’s right, you know.  You look edible in a tux.” After a final adjustment to his tie, she walked toward the front of the ballroom, muttering under her breath about bagging the Swede.
“He’s good,” Steve said, under his breath to Pepper. He’d been the one to send Tony the text to mislead the reporters about the money trail—he didn’t want anyone thinking they might have gotten close—and even he could barely tell that Tony was getting his cue from somewhere else.
“I guess you wouldn’t know, and that’s not really a highlight of the time you missed anyway, so it’s probably not worth telling you about,” Tony continued, rambling. “Or, wait, are you having gay panic? Steve, Cap, look, first, it doesn’t make you gay, we were just sleeping, I would’ve felt it this morning if we’d been, what did you guys call it, making whoopee? Well, assuming you’d be topping, but have you seen you? Seems like you would be. But seriously, the public frowns on homophobia, Steve, put on your big boy pants, it’s a new—“
Steve took a step back, going from bright red to pale in seconds.  He was beyond embarrassed, wishing he could sink through the floor and melt into whatever wouldn’t attract attention.
“Indeed, Captain.  He prefers to stay sober, now.  He has found it intensely helpful, and so has Ms. Potts. He finds that he uses his time more wisely and is less vulnerable to being taken advantage of when he is sober.”
Tony put down his tablet.  He’d created the plans for making Steve’s new palette.  He’d use the new shiny metal he’d gotten from Mr. Morita.  Whatever it was, it’d hold paint.  It was strong, too.  It could probably take a punch even.
“Poppyseed? Yes!” he grabbed one out of the bag, pulling out a plain one for Pepper while he was at it.  Their reunion was blocking the steps, but it was just as well, given that Steve and Peggy just pulled in, looking a little haggard.
Tony rolled his eyes, pulling a packet of dried blueberries out of his pocket. Might as well have snacks during the entertainment.
“Ugh,” Barnes grimaced, while Steve just made a face. Interesting.  So, not his boyfriend? “I’m the one who broke in. I should be the one to work it off. This isn’t about you!”
The forms asked for standard employee information, but he still didn’t really want to give anything away. Nothing he didn’t have to, anyway.  Most of it wasn’t a big deal, since his parents were already dead.  Place of residence? Well.  Here, he guessed.  He wasn’t going to drag Natasha into it.  Contact in case of emergency? Bucky.  Last place of employment? The army.  Those were discharge papers that he had fought hard to win.  He had only ever wanted to look after Bucky, anyway.  Steve filled out as much as he could.  References? Pretty much Bucky.  Who else would he have listed? Monty? Pretty sure he was with MI6 right now.  Last he’d heard, Dernier was on some top-secret research problem in Switzerland.  Jones was still with the military, but not officially.  It was one of those things.  And Steve was pretty sure that both Morita and Dugan had been flown to some country in the middle of Africa to help a transitioning government.  Besides, he didn’t want to get anyone else involved.  Although, given that Mr. Stark had a functioning AI, that might be a lost cause.  Still.  Steve wasn’t just going to give up anyone else’s name. He signed at the bottom, eyeing the mostly blank form balefully.  It was a paper reminder of what he no longer had. He shook himself.  Enough with the maudlin thoughts.  He had work to do.
(Mod)Wilson: Mel’s right.  Glad to have you. We’ve all got the same problems here.  Guilt, regret.  We’re listening.
Well, one was probably quicker than the other at this point.  He closed his eyes and unzipped his pants, two opposite images warring for control in his brain.  In one, he was on his knees, just as Steve had found him, sans cat and clothes though. God, Steve would take such good care of him.  He knew he would.  Steve always took good care of him, sex wouldn’t be any different. And Tony could be so good for him, he knew he could. He’d taken enough measurements and bodyscans of Steve—for work!—to know exactly what he was packing, at least when he was soft, and it was beyond impressive.  He didn’t know if it was superserum or just how Steve had always been built, but he’d like to do more investigation.
Don’t get me wrong.  I know how lucky I am.  We go to a great school. I’ve got a great future. I have a house, and food, and clothes, and money, and a new phone, and a computer… I’ve got it all.  I’m lucky. I am.
Tony buttoned up his shirt before a sea of cops flooded in, taking their cues from Pepper and Rhodey.  When they hauled Stane off in cuffs, Tony let out a little sigh he hadn’t known he’d been keeping in.  Steve had made his way back to his side, standing close enough that Tony could feel almost feel him, but not quite touching.  Tony turned to look at him, raising an eyebrow to indicate his question.
“Hey,” Tony says, because Steve’s pulling away and fuck no, that’s the last thing he wants. “Hey, talk to me.”
In hindsight, then, it shouldn’t have been a surprise either that none of the team spills the beans when they’re all together.
“Simmer down, Shellhead,” Steve rolls his eyes as he flings himself at Tony, dumping his water gun to wrap his arms around him. “Youd’a done the same thing and you know it.”
, but she said I can call’er Pepper, and she got red hair, and she’s the smartest girl in the class. I shared some o’my cookies for lunch, and she helped me with m’numbers."
“Because she’ll be three in a couple of weeks and I think she’d like ponies, and we can have the party there and why
“Modest? Not me,” Tony laughs, that familiar, impish grin turned straight at Steve. “I don’t even know what that means, no sir! Never met her.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but looks shy and pleased all at once. “I feel a little ridiculous, to be honest.”
Steve’s laughter is immediate and loud, and if he’s where Clint thinks he is, he can imagine all the SHIELD agents’ faces as Captain America laughs his head off right there in HQ.
“God, I don’t know if that makes things better,” Pepper says. “If that’s all it took for you to run off and get married to a...” she waves at Steve. “Sorry, what do you do?”
CHAPTER 100!! *throws confetti at everyone* :') I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all of you guys, for all the hits and the kudos and the comments. It means a lot to me, and ILY ALL! :D
–” he points to the dark, gleaming motorcycle five feet in front of him “–is real. There’s no way... Steve.
The blond looks completely blindside for a second, and then another, before the most delicious blush appears on his cheeks, spreading down his neck and below the collar of his tight, wet t-shirt.
“No,” Steve giggles, jumping up and down. He’s so close to the edge of the couch, Tony’s heart starts thundering in his chest– harder than it has all morning, with all the activity he’s been put through– and he takes advantage of Steve’s distraction to run up and sweep him into his arms. “
Pepper puts her pen down. “Tony Stark,” she says, and even though her voice is soft, it’s all business. “Are you seriously complaining about signing papers for
“Oh my god, stop it,” Tony laughs, lifting his head to brush his lips against Steve’s shoulder. “‘M trying to sleep.”
“I have been. I want to go home.” Steve’s voice breaks on the last word, and Tony feels the empty space on the bed more than ever.
“I’ll make it up to you later tonight,” Tony promises, cuddling further into Steve’s chest. “But for now, you’re stuck with me here.”
Steve nods miserably, coughing into a tissue a second later, and God help him, Tony wants to hold him in his arms and never let go.
“‘s why they dropped me in week two, remember?” Bucky grins. “Don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone, punk.”
Steve shakes his head. “Not too much,” he answers, and then gives them all a sheepish smile. “Coulson and Hill brought out some celebratory lunch, and I felt bad about declinin’. How ‘bout you?”
“Y’sick?” Tony asks innocently, lips brushing against the top of his Captain America plushie. It makes Steve hold the boy even closer, pressing a kiss to his soft, brown hair.
But even through the tears in his eyes, Steve’s smile is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. “Because I’ve got everything I never knew I wanted right here,” he tightens his hold.
“And make everyone’s day? I don’t think so,” Tony huffs. “If I’m miserable, the whole fucking world’s gonna be miserable with me. You’re so hot when you get all Captain-y, though.”
“You’re an ass,” Steve mumbles, lips brushing Tony’s shoulder with every word as he lowers his head back to where it was.
,” Tony replies. “Beggars can’t be choosers, and all. Not that we’re begging for villains and monsters and shit, but... honestly, this month’s been a
Tony scoffs. “Tell me that again when you’re dripping wet with milk and have tiny hands shoving Froot Loops down your shirt.”
“God, Tony,” Steve whispers, holding the brunet tighter as he presses a kiss on every inch of skin he can reach. “I’m sorry–”
” a tiny voice whispers in Tony’s ear, and little arms wind themselves around his neck a moment later. He turns instinctively, and Natasha settles into his arms without another word, red curls tucking themselves neatly under his chin.
“The point remains,” Tony mumbles, pausing to stretch like a cat and then flopping over on top of the blond, “that you’re not making sense, dew drop.”
“It’s Pepper to you. Always,” she replies, the words unplanned but not any less true for it. “And a very happy birthday, too.”
“Nope, shut up. I just– I’m happy just… being with you,” Tony says shyly, cheeks a rare, pretty shade of pink. “Don’t get me wrong– you and me? We’d make kickass prom kings. But I also don’t… I don’t give a fuck anymore, babe.”
Tony lets out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding when Peter barrels into his legs. “Hiya, baby,” he coos, and lifts his boy up into his arms. “Did you have fun?”
And Tony’s the most amazing person Steve’s ever met, brilliant and gorgeous and one of the kindest souls he knows– Tony could have anyone, and Steve wants to cry at the realization that maybe Tony’s figuring that out, too.
"You sure are somethin'," he says, and the smile Tony’s lips soften into in response-- soft and warm and as familiar to Steve as
“Behave, Shellhead. Just sit tight and enjoy the view,” Steve laughs, and with his family settled around him, Tony finds it easy to do so, closing his eyes against the surprisingly gentle winter breeze.
“I guess we got no choice now,” Steve says, after a short, comfortable silence. “Lemme get my wallet,” he says, and gives Tony a delicious view of his jean-clad ass when he turns to reach into the duffel bag sitting in the backseat.
It doesn’t take Tony long to appreciate Steve’s plan in bringing them so far away, because not a single person stops them. Everybody seems to share the single minded focus that’s brought them all here, so the most either of them get is a curious second glance or an awed wave.
For a single, terrifying moment, he’s back in the caves, back in Afghanistan with the heat and the fear, the endless pain of the
“Who the hell’s running these things?” Tony asks from the direction of the couch, and Pepper knows she should leave, because she doesn’t need to hear any more to know this is a private conversation. But there’s something in her ex-boss’ voice she’s never heard before, a wistfulness and vulnerability she’s always known lies behind those dark eyes and razor sharp tongue. “They’ll be packing up their boxes in an hour when I find ‘em.”
Natasha rolls her eyes, and is just about to pull out her phone and call Steve, when she sees Tony swagger into the room out of the corner of her eye.
“Guess… guess you were r-right about those bedroom eyes th-then, huh?” Steve stutters when they finally pull away, eyes still dark with desire.
“Give me fifteen minutes,” Pepper tells him, “and you will. But in the meantime, take care of that boy.”
“I’ll take that,” he says instead, relishing the utter happiness blooming in his chest, and leans back in.
Bella rolls over onto the now empty space beside him, bright blond curls gleaming in the morning light, and grins up at him. “Thank you f’my pwesents.”
“Yeah, it runs in the family,” Steve chuckles, and Tony doesn’t know if it’s that sound or what Steve’d said, that makes his chest bloom with more warmth.
“No, hey no, fine, it’s good, Macaroni’s fine,” he stutters, rocking his arms back and forth. “Good, yummy Macaroni, okay? Don’t cry, sweetheart. Fu–
“Can’t fool me, mister,” Steve says softly, and when he pulls his hand away, Tony’s pretty sure he imagines the way it lingers just a little bit as a finger traces his jawline. “I see right through ya.”
In response, Tony’s body goes limp, and when Steve just crouches down to throw him over his shoulder as he walks towards the door, he can feel the smile settling happily on his face.
Both of them turn to the door, and Tony can’t control the smile when he sees Steve standing there. “I hope one of those is for me,” he points to the cups.
“I love you too, sweetheart,” Steve tells him, and when they finally make it into their apartment, his smile is brighter than anything Tony’s seen all night.
(Never mind that sometimes, he imagines what it’d be like to wake up and hear that voice right next to him, low and rough from sleep; to feel Steve’s lips on his neck, on his chest, and then lower...)
“Then it’s yours,” Tony decides, placing a buying sticker on the wall beside it. “Consider it an… early birthday present?”
“But then you came along— you, the Avengers, everyone else— and just like that, I wasn’t... wasn’t alone. And now, I get to come home to
“Clint used to make fun of me, because I was always starin’ at you before. But I couldn’t help it,” he reaches out, running a thumb across Tony’s sharp, rough jaw.
“Yeah, I’m, uh, I’m sorry about that,” the Captain admits. “We just… we couldn’t find a better way to contact you in person without putting both of us in any more danger.”
“Years?” Why does his own voice sound so far away? “I-- but I-- I just... What the fuck are you talking about?"
“This is perfect, sweetheart,” Steve says, an awed, happy sigh leaving his lips as Tony slides the ring onto his finger. “Oh my god...”
“Nope. Come on, you won’t drop her, lemme see your arms– yep, there you go. Careful, please… see? All good,” Tony says, then smiles at the baby again. “This here’s Uncle Bucky, on your Papa’s side.”
Tony can’t help but bury his face in the blond’s neck, savoring the warmth and the mere presence of the love of his life.
By the time Tony lets out a loud sigh as he stirs his mug, Steve’s shoulders are shaking from his efforts to keep his laughter inside.
“Don’t know what you’re talkin’ about,” Steve says, and the happy little hum he gives when their sock clad feet meet under the covers sends something warm down Tony’s spine. “‘m not doin’ anything...”
Steve is nodding before Tony’s even halfway through. "Shit, are you-- yeah, yes, oh my god, yes. I'll marry you sweetheart, of course I will, I'll marry the fuck out of you."
"How does she know?" Tony asks, but a second later, he smells apples and he turns and there she is, his Pepper-pot, heading straight for him. God, he feels better just looking at her.
“Then sleep,” Steve says, but the soft, soothing brush of his fingers along Tony’s hipbones just make him more awake.
It’s slow, whisper soft, and still as tentative as the first time, but it sends Tony’s heart racing like nothing else can, and he loses himself in the warmth of Steve’s lips as they caress his own.
“I caught the time on Agent Ward’s wristwatch just before I took him down,” she smirks. “And then I looked at yours a couple of minutes ago. That’s the one you gave him, isn’t it, Dad?”
Because Steve’s breath is leaving him, his heart’s slowing down, and Tony can’t do anything except watch the man he loves grow colder and paler.
But he has no clue how to get there, and fuck, this is just like Becky Carmichael all over again, back when he was a stupid, prepubescent teen.
“Tony...” he says, whisper soft, and it seems to jostle Tony out of his head, because he reaches out and takes it gently from Thor’s tiny hands. His movements are more than a little as he opens it, only to let out a quiet curse a moment later. “
,” Steve says, grinning as he holds said slider-- ridiculously tiny in between those large, pale fingers-- out to him, and Tony’s always known when to take what he can.
Steve says, and his voice gets even lower and sadder, even though it hadn’t seemed possible a moment before. “You’re right. It’s not even-- I shouldn’t be complaining...”
“That’s not important,” the brunet scoffs, pulling at Steve’s sleeve as he waves to the rest of the room. “We’ve got a new arrival to bring home!”
“N--” Peter starts, but then snaps his mouth shut when the words seem to register, and his eyes-- big and brown like Tony’s-- widen in distress. “Fwiends?”
“Shut up,” he hisses, just as Steve lets out another laugh when the puppy in his lap gives his face an enthusiastic lick, and he’s pretty sure something on his face betrays the longing in his chest, because Rhodey mutters a low, breathy curse.
“An’ dey take you to duh park!” Clint chirps, and beside him, Natasha lets out a hum of agreement. “An’ Tony takes us to duh park lots!”
But Steve’s favorite part of the night is when he asks Tony about what he does, because the brunet’s eyes go wide and bright as he goes off about robotics and engineering and other things Steve couldn’t even begin to understand. He can only stand there and take in the way Tony just
Soft lips press against his own— once, twice, then his mouth is being nudged open and fuck yeah, there we go…
Tony shrugs, and hides his smile behind his coffee mug. “It’s how I cope. You’re not the one being left behind, so you can’t complain.”
,” she sighs, walking carefully towards them. “Antonio, what’s-- what’s going on? They... Oh, they told me, and I just couldn’t believe it. The future?”
. I’d tell him that I would sleep another hundred years, a thousand, as long as you were on the other side of ‘em.”
“Wish me luck, then, Pepper-pot,” he says, with more confidence than he actually feels. She just shakes her head and blows him a kiss.
“Awww, that’s sweet,” Barnes snickers, and god, Tony hates all of them so much right now. “But he’ll be fine, Stark. I mean, look at him-- happy as a clam.”
“It wasn’t the best idea to kidnap me, then,” Tony says. “Doesn’t do all that much for a good first impression.”
Natasha rolls her eyes, and he knows the only reason she’s not hitting him is because they’re in a room full of patients. “One day, Stark…”
“He won’t apologize, you know,” Rhodey says, breaking the silence that Steve would give anything to hear filled with Tony’s laughter. “He’d do this for just about anyone, but for you? He wouldn’t even blink.”
Steve’s laughing before he’s even finished talking, breath warm along Tony’s neck. “You made our daughter an Instagram account?”
“Yours!” He hears Rhodey say, right before they disappear into the throng of people on the dance floor.
“Get outta here? Yeah, okay,” Steve gasps, and all but flings himself off the couch, holding out his hand to Tony. “Night, everyone!”
“Oh pipe down,” Steve chuckles, pulling him closer into the warmth of his chest as he rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. “We’ll go back in a bit. I’ll even make some more hot chocolate to make it up to ya.”
“I hit you in the head with my football! God, I didn’t mean to-- it was an accident! Bucky said something and I got distracted, and I didn’t throw it right and then you were just there and
, he can see the man’s eyelashes from here. He’s even more beautiful now, if that’s possible. “Oh, and Sam and Bucky are outside-- they wanna meet you.”
He ignores the lone nurse taking vitals, and when she leaves, he doesn’t hesitate to climb on the bed and lay down beside Steve, timing his breathing to the soft rise and fall of Steve’s chest.
“Bucky, stop,” Steve shakes his head, and then he stands up and wow, this man’s just a masterpiece all over, isn’t he?
“I’m not judging,” the man shakes his head. “I’m just curious as to why you’d let a man– who’s got more blood on his hands than the rest of us in here put together, let’s be honest– why you’d let him join the rest of you heroes in protecting the world. Tony Stark is hardly the first person that comes to mind when you say ‘hero’–”
,” he whispers, shoulders heaving with every breath he takes, but apart from the slight softening of her green eyes, she doesn’t budge.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony says vaguely. “Can I–” he reaches up to pick at a corner of the gauze, only to have his hand slapped away softly.
Steve shakes his head. “Nah-- didn’t, um... didn’t feel right,” he replies, but takes the card when Tony holds it out for him.
“You can’t leave me on my wedding day,” Tony scoffs. “So just calm down and look pretty. I promise I’ll behave–”
Tony looks over the rim of his tablet to find Steve shuffling by one of the kitchen counters. “What’s up, buttercup?”
“Really, I’m not surprised you guys have nothing b-better to do,” he snarks, breath hitching when one of Rumlow’s goons pushes him hard against the locker, his back hitting the sharp end of the handle. The hallways are empty except for him and a handful of guys. And Brock, of course.
“Happy birthday!” His team yells, before he’s even taken three steps onto the floor, and Pepper watches every emotion play out openly on his face—confusion, realization, and finally, incandescent happiness as he makes his way further into the room.
“Gonna give me your helmet, then?” he finally says, sauntering up to the bike with more aplomb than he feels.
“I don’t... have a present. For you.” The last part is whispered into Steve’s shirt, and he frowns when Tony tenses in his arms and looks away.
“I don’t give a shit,” Steve grins, and the others chuckle in approval. “I would do a hell of a lot more than curse for you, Tony Stark. You’re worth it.”
Steve’s voice sounds oddly distant, even as his chest presses against Tony’s back, arms wrapped comfortably around his waist, and Tony turns his head away from the stars above them to look at him over his shoulder. “I guess it’s not so bad,” he says, and feels a thrill of satisfaction when Steve grins in response.
“That doesn’t work,” Tony whines, and Steve barely resists the urge to lean over and kiss the pout off his face. “I’ve tried
“Okay, no, I’m not,” Tony says loudly, “because it’s the truth, and I don’t fucking know why you’d bother–”
“I already have that,” Steve says, and then both of them try to pretend they don’t see the other blushing.
Because as the days turn to weeks and Steve’s mission keeps them away, Tony starts finding other kinds of notes that leave his cheeks burning and his heart racing:
“There is no way you should be just as cute when you’re flustered,” Tony mumbles, and there’s a soft smile on his face Steve doesn’t want to look away from. “I really lucked out today, fuck.”
He has his phone out before he knows it, and even with trembling hands and blurry eyes, he still finds the right button to press-- he could find it with his eyes closed, for all the times he uses it-- and then brings it to his cheek except
She looked dissatisfied at his answer. “Want to tell me what else is going on? Did Loki say something to you? You know you can’t trust him, Steve.”
“Mr. Stark!” one of the kids said into the video call.  Her eyes sparkled, excited.  “We’re so honored to have you call us, we’ve been looking into palladium replacements—“
“Okay, I’ve got you, I’ve got you, babe,” Tony said, refocusing. He licked the joint at the top of Steve’s thigh where it was red, irritated from his beard, tongue pressing firmly into the crease, and Steve’s cock pulsed again, spurting liquid across his abdomen. Tony swiped his fingers through it, sucking gently at the base of Steve’s shaft.
“I know, I know. You’d think a man like me would have room service, right? I almost put on the French maid outfit, but I figured it was overkill,” Tony said breezily as he entered the room. He was carrying a glass of water and a plate with a few crackers, his pajamas masking the glowing metal Steve knew resided in his chest.  Steve’s body reacted wildly to the suggestion of Tony wearing a maid’s outfit.  Tony nearly naked, bare ass peeking out from under a ruffled skirt, apron lifting to accommodate his rising cock. He shifted, pulling the blankets over himself discreetly.  He was going to chalk this one up to the dump of hormones from the nightmare and the surprise visit. Of course Tony was sexy—mouthy, intelligent brunettes were sort of his type, after all, not that he’d had a lot of time for dating in the army. But Tony was also his boss.  Who was in his room.  With snacks. Because, dammit.  Because of Steve’s inability to handle his own shit.  The night before a big press conference.  Fuck.
“Not based on what I saw.” The dirt floor, Yinsen. The taste of fear. “We’re not doing a good enough job.” Tony picked up a screwdriver, tapped it in his hand a few times.  Put it down. “We’re going to do better. We’re going to do something else.”
The first time they make love, Steve is amazed by how much it feels like coming home.  His heart expands, feels whole, he cradles Tony like he’s precious, because he is. He draws the pleasure out, takes his time learning Tony’s body, kissing every inch of him.  He sees Tony looking at him, illuminated by the reactor and other starlight, and presses a kiss into the soft skin of his thigh.  He can feel Tony getting impatient, but this is important—he is important, and Steve is going to make sure he knows that, for him, this is it, this is everything. When he finally enters Tony, slowly, so slowly Tony’s pulse is racing in counterpoint, silently begging him to hurry up, he can feel his own body trembling with the effort, holding himself back, knows Tony can feel it as well.  Tony cups his cheek, smiles at him, eyes too bright, says, “Steve, please,” voice breaking, and Steve is ruined. After, Steve pulls Tony to him, lets him curl up lazily on his chest, while Steve runs fingers through his dark hair, traces the reactor, kisses Tony, light and sweet. He has never imagined anything could feel like this.  He never wants to let go.
Steve smiled again, one of those sweet, molasses smiles, like Tony was all he saw, all he wanted.  They killed him, every time.  “Thanks, Tony,” he said, trying on a glove. “They feel like leather,” he noted, surprised.
Tony couldn’t concentrate.  He couldn’t focus on anything.  Class went by in a blur, robotics meeting was a giant waste of time because Bruce was in a meeting with Dr. Selvig and Hammer couldn’t remember his password on the tool cabinet.  Finally Tony just shouldered him aside and entered his own code.  Still, they barely made any progress on their competitive robot by the time Natasha had to leave for practice.  Tony finished cleaning up the tools, setting them all back neatly and cursing that he didn’t have Dum-E in the school robotics lab to help.  Finally, he made his way to Coulson’s office.
The study group broke down from there, but Tony couldn’t stop smiling the entire time.  They packed it in early, since Steve and Sam had regionals the next day.
Sleep didn’t come easily. He tossed and turned, trying to find peace.  He had too much on his mind, anyway.  Around 10:30, he finally gave up.  Steve laced up his running shoes, popped in earbuds, and headed out.  He didn’t have a destination in mind, and he was fine with that.  He just ran.
“Um, hate to break up the date,” Tony broke in, but really, who says “gross” anymore? Is this guy four?
The line goes dead. Tony sits with the stupid phone in his hand, thinking of what Rogers would do if he were here.  If he was the one on dad duty. Be closer, probably.  Well, he can do that.
“Pep, Virginia, boss lady, what can I, humble servant, do for you?” It would have gone over better if his mouth hadn’t been full of apple.
Tony’s phone started blowing up, but it wasn’t email.  Pepper.  Rhodey.  Natasha.  Sam.  Howard.  Howard. Howard. Pepper. Rhodey. Howard.  Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Tony finally closed his mouth over the tip and Steve gasped.  He was so hot and wet, the pressure eclipsing whatever thoughts Steve had been trying to have.  Tony shifted, trying to take more of Steve, swallowing him down, the tip of Steve’s cock pressing into his throat, sliding down, cutting off his air. He worked his hand around the part of the shaft he couldn’t take, fondling behind Steve’s balls. He pulled off, breathing hard.
You know, Flying, I don’t think there’s anything in the world that could change my dad’s mind. The president could come out as gay, and he would just make sure to donate however much money it took to get him out of office the next cycle.” Tony stopped and re-read.  Nope. Sure, many of the families at Shield High were wealthy, but maybe not as wealthy as the Starks.  So. “…and he would make sure to vote him out of office the next cycle. But I’m not in danger.” He
Seriously, he’d thought the awful part of his day was over.  His mind flashed quickly over the past twelve hours or so.  Had they discussed anything classified? And—hadn’t the kitten been a little handsy with him? He blushed, his entire body burning hot.
She smiled at him, a bit wryly.  “Nah, the hero’s the girl who reported the scumbag in the first place.  Look, Steve.  I’m just saying.  In this hypothetical, you’re me. You worked for him, he held all the cards.  And Stark, he thinks he’s Hodge.  I know, he’s not.  But he thinks he is. I think he was apologizing because he didn’t mean to overstep.  Didn’t mean to come on to someone if that person couldn’t say no.”
Steve finished up, tossing the bandaid wrappers and putting the kit neatly away.  When he stood up, Tony was in the other room, getting a new shirt.  Steve turned to the kitten, still curled happily in his towel.  “Okay, baby, let’s go find everyone else,” he said to him, picking him up again.
After a moment, Tony cleared his throat.  “So I brought him back to the tower to clean him up.  I had Jarvis check him for a microchip, but no luck. He’s quite the little asshole.  Seems to like you, though.”
“Thought you didn’t know how to dance,” Tony shoots back, trying to keep the mood light. It doesn’t exactly work.  Steve laughs, but it's a thin sound.  Still too raw, maybe.  Tony tries to remember that for Steve, it’s only been a few years, and everyone—literally everyone now—has left him behind.
And fuck, that was true, too, wasn’t it? He did still want a drink, he did still have weaknesses, and he never had made Howard proud.
“Not so wise as that.  I still.  If I get only a day.  I would want to be able to show Tony how much I love him.” It tore him apart to say it out loud.  He’d only ever admitted it to Sam, and then obliquely, and he struggled, every day, to keep it hidden.  He was cautious at team meetings.  He purposely spread his attention to the rest of the Avengers so Tony didn’t notice the way Steve’s eyes tracked him, how he glowed when Tony praised him, how he tried so hard to be the person Tony expected him to be. Sometimes, when Tony worked on a piece of his uniform or equipment, he’d let Steve come down with him to the workshop so he could get immediate feedback on the changes.  It didn’t matter what Steve was supposed to have going on that day—he’d blown off a meeting with Fury in favor of talking about parachutes.
“Yeah yeah, let’s go get your new playdate,” Tony grumbled, hiding the rising tension.  When they pulled up, Jimmy had quite the smile on his face.
Tony reached up for him, caught his collar, dragged him down, Steve’s mouth soft, tasting vaguely of ash, Steve smelled of sweat and battle but he kissed him back, sweet, the relief of having won, the joy of a free sky, his tongue slipping between Tony’s lips—if this was the other side of dying, Tony would do it over and over again.  It was like he hadn’t truly understood kissing, chained in some Platonic cave, until he'd kissed Steve and stood outside, breathing the clean air, sun warming his face.
“I hear you’re mentoring the Queens kid,” Steve says when Tony calls him for his birthday. “He seems like a good kid.”
These were Mr. Stark’s blueprints.  What had he done? He was supposed to be helping, not sticking his nose where it didn’t belong! Mr. Stark had told him just this morning, he was an engineer—the foremost in the country.  And Steve was an unemployed veteran.  He had no training in architecture or mechanics; he had no right to mess with Mr. Stark’s documents. And he’d written it all in pen. Steve was sure that Mr. Stark could print another copy, but it was the hubris. It was the arrogance of his actions.  He’d overstepped his bounds.
The witch (Tony was half convinced it was just Loki, in disguise, the slippery little shit) threw down a golden apple. It hit the ground in the exact middle of all of the Avengers, precisely on Steve’s boot, dissipating into a cloud of lavender smoke that set everyone coughing.  Everyone but Tony, who quickly captured a sample in one of his spare vials.  The lavender evaporated, leaving the team generally unscathed looking.  After asking Jarvis about the air quality, Tony lifted the face mask.
Tony wasn’t really listening , trying to keep working on the ultraglass and fight his reflex to say yes to Steve.
Again, this was the absolute wrong time to get a hard on but Jesus, how had anyone in Steve’s unit gotten anything done when he gave commands in that voice?
“I believe in love! #shellhead” one comment read.  It popped up again seconds later. “Go get your man! Love conquers all! #shellhead”
Tony’s vision was a haze of red. He could practically feel his blood pressure spike dangerously—couldn’t tell if he was more angry or confused, although scared could probably round out the top three.  Steve was no one’s rent boy, didn’t belong to Tony. How dare Obie talk about him in that condescending tone? But figure out what? And how? And how did he know whatever it was that he knew?
His mind was whirring, and he didn’t think he’d breathed since he started typing.  Before he could think better, he clicked send. What’s the worst that could happen, right? He brushed his teeth, got dressed, and flashed Jarvis a patented Tony Stark smile on his way out, skipping breakfast.  He couldn’t eat. He pulled the A4 out of the driveway, then swung by to pick up Rhodey and Pepper.  Last stop was Natasha, the new girl who seemed to fit in with their friends just fine.  She was a bit of a geek, on the robotics team with Tony and kicking ass on the lacrosse team.  For some reason the other team just never saw her coming and then all of a sudden she was scoring on them.
Pepper was already there, no surprise, and she’d picked up Bruce on the way.  Natasha was perched in an armchair, flipping index cards in some sort of fancy David Bowie-esque move. She gave Tony a significant look and slipped him a packet of papers to sign inside a slim black notebook.  Steve came out of the kitchen with a beautiful brunette.
Tony looked mock-affronted.  “I will have you know that I ate a burger.  With cheese.  And fries. Baked, but still, fries.  Can we call them fries if they’re baked? Doesn’t matter.  Pull up a chair, take a load off.  Happy called you?”
Steve stood up and went to the sink.  There weren’t very many dishes to be done, but he carefully washed each one and set them in the rack.  Then he picked up a new towel, wiped each dish, and put it away in the cabinet.  He reordered the porcelain mugs so that they were all facing down, handles turned toward the front right corner of the cabinet.  Easy for all of them to grab.
Tony laughed openly, subsiding when he saw Steve’s stern glance.  “Thanks for the rescue, though.  Everhart makes it difficult to stay calm.”
“And I saw that interview, too, the one Stern saw.  I watched it with Nat.  Did you see the way he was looking at you when you shut down that reporter? I’m telling you.  All gooey and heart eyes, I swear. He looked like he was thinking about what he was going to name the kids you two are gonna have.”
Tony considers that.  It’s bad news.  He’d thought maybe there was backup somewhere.  Nah, he’d hoped there was.  Steve Rogers functions best with a team.  They hold him back from being reckless, from putting himself in the crosshairs every goddamn time. “Healing factor,” he’d always grin, as if that meant anything against well-aimed bullets. As if Tony doesn’t—still—stop breathing when Steve gets hurt.
On his way down the stairs, Jarvis alerted him.  “It matched Captain Rogers’s file, sir, the encryption key for the last file.  It appears to be encrypted by your father, and only has a ten digit passcode.”
Barnes started to reply--definitely stepping in to make sure Steve didn’t get himself in trouble--but Steve talked right over him. “Yes, sir.  I can start whenever you need.” He glared at Barnes.  “And Bucky will stay out of your hair. I promise.” Barnes sulked.
This was what Barnes had been looking for, what he thought Tony might one day hold over Steve’s head.
Tony almost laughed.  “You know I’m a mechanic, right? World’s best engineer? Greatest mind in science?”
Tony hesitates.  Actually, he’s not.  He’s never changed the coding for the door.  He gives a brief command to Friday, missing Jarvis terribly.  That one’s on him, though. He nods, releases the restraints.  The cuffs open.
“I have a lot of spare time now,” Steve says. He turns his hands, flexing his fingers, trying to keep blood in all the right places.
“Um, no, he’s not a land tract,” Tony said quickly, ignoring the fact that yes, he felt quite possessive, thank you very much. The other Avengers burst into the room behind him, weapons out.
Christ. That kid was too nice for his own good. “Oh, he’s not my friend,” Tony assured him, going to open the door.  Hammer hadn’t stopped pounding on the doorbell anyway.  “Quit it, Hammer,” he said as soon as he opened the door.  A wave of cologne assaulted him as Hammer pushed past him.
Excuse me, Wilson, but the Stark estate is huge. It’s three or four miles to the nearest house. I can’t possibly walk that far in time.
Tony blushed a little.  Mr. Morita was the best. The nicest to him.  “I wouldn’t have any cool toys without you, Mr. Morita.  I’ll show you what I make this little baby into.  When I figure it out.”
Tony doesn’t understand how all of America can be so stupid.  Steve is just wearing a mask, for christ’s sake.  A mask that clearly he made using the front of his new spangle-less but still very tight and now even more revealing uniform.  Not that Tony is complaining, exactly, it certainly makes a nice poster, and he’s seen a few of them up around town.  But how have they not looked at the way he fights—the same tactical genius is at work.  The way his shoulders always hit the target head on.  The speed he carries.  Tony hasn’t even seen him in person, just the footage from newsreels.
Steve just grimaced.  Well. That was odd, even if it wasn’t any of Tony’s business. Steve pulled out his phone and started playing with it in a clumsy attempt to change the subject. “Who’s #3?” Steve asked, looking at his quick contacts.
Steve sighed, putting down his watercolor.  Tony was fiddling with an arrow tip, so Steve slid a hand around his waist, kissing the back of his neck.  Tony put down the arrow tip, turning fully in Steve’s arms.  He smiled, pulling him in for another kiss.  “Come get me after,” he told Steve.  “And don’t let her do that flippy thing with her left ankle. She always pins you with that move.”
“Bucky uses that, on his arm.  Says it helps. With the pain, and the inflammation.” He looked up, an odd expression on his face, but it wasn’t aggressive. It wasn’t disgusted. “It isn’t poisoned,” he said, with a tiny grin.
“J, whatever that prosthetics program costs at the VA, find out how much it is, and double it.  Make an anonymous donation via the Maria Stark Foundation.  Attach a rider to it—half the funding into mental health care. Make it happen today.”
He thought her technique could use some work.  This was more in the vein of “things to hit people with” rather than “things to eat.”  He poured two mugs of coffee.  Maybe Bucky would wake up for him this time.
“Oh, thanks,” Steve said. “But cross country is a team sport, even if we run individually.  It’s really Sam and T’Challa and the Peters. And Pete’s only a freshman. He’s going to be amazing as a senior, so much better than I am.  Shield is really lucky to have these guys.” He knocked Sam on the shoulder as he said it and Sam pretended to take a fall, staggering like Steve had really pushed him, then saluting him jokingly.
Well, he thought in retrospect, he should have been more specific.  Because he got a witch who was also a mad scientist.  Goddamnit, that wasn’t what Tony meant.
“Fine, fine,” Tony grumbled. “Grab Jack the Ripper and let’s go introduce him to the rest of this zoo.” He walked toward the elevator, knowing Steve would catch up.
“How about make sure you eat breakfast today.  And tell that nice boy he did a good job.” She paused. “He seems very sweet, Tony.” There was an implied,
“Shit, you made your mom’s recipe?” Sam asked, willing to overlook Hammer in favor of something better.  “Hell yeah! Chem study group is awesome! It’s been like a year since I’ve had one of my favorite chocolate chip buddies.”
Tony continued staring at the little graphic. Yes, he had seen that before.  On a filing cabinet right in that basement where Barnes had been digging around.  Of course. Jesus, how had he been such an idiot?  And what was in those goddamn files?
“Cap, I’m sorry, but Hulk just threw half the food in the gutter and Thor fried the rest with Mjolnir.  I have no idea what’s going on, but---hey! Stop that! Steve, we’re not bringing dinner home.  There’s no way I can go back there and—Natasha, put the goat down! No, I—no! I don’t need an ode! Jesus I gotta go.”
frightened!” she called out to them, striding nimbly on top of the prone body with her stilettos on her way out.  Steve thought she maybe stepped with extra force on his sensitive bits, especially with the heels.
Tony shot a sidelong glance at Pepper who chewed the end of her pen a bit guiltily. Clearly she already knew about Morita’s mom. Tony wasn’t sure why Pepper had to feel so guilty—it’s not like the interviews had been her idea.
Steve goes red, then white.  He makes a tiny sound in the back of his throat.  Keeps that calm demeanor fixed in place.
He started the conference call, introducing himself as Steve Rogers, the new PA for Mr. Stark, and apologizing for conducting the call in English.  Engineering seemed to be on the up and up.  Within four days, they should be fully operational.  Not a problem.  He thanked them politely and told them he’d get the information to Mr. Stark.  That screen closed, and only Batroc was left.
Tony looked over at Steve, still hard at work, even after Tony’s transgression.  He swallowed, guilt rising in his throat, threatening to drown him.
“Who says it’s for you? It’s for me.  I’ve finally found one that lasts.  That’s big.  That’s like, mini golf big.  Dancing big.  Piñata big.” He shoved a cracker in his mouth, chewing for a moment.  “So what do you think, Rogers? Dancing? Mini golf?”
in Tony’s “Netflix recommends” list and demanded that they watch it immediately, since it was a completely awesome and underrated movie, and high-fived Bruce and Steve when they said they’d seen it too, even if Bruce felt that there were some major scientific inaccuracies.
There they were. Photos of Steve, scrawny and defiant.  A fierce surge of protectiveness shot through Tony.
Of course, of course, Steve calls after the ferry.  Tony is upset, guilty. He’d helped Peter, and Peter had been reckless, and it was his fault.  Maybe not all of it, but some of it.  He has the suit, packed away.  The kid had said, if he really cared… Well, fuck it.  He really cares.  He cares so much he thinks he’s dying of it.  He isn’t sure how to do it all alone.
He put the sketch of Obie in the book, closed it, and laid it on top of the clothes in Steve’s bag.  That was it.  He’d have someone take it to the apartment tonight.
The door popped open. Steve put the tray down immediately, snapping to attention and saluting Colonel Rhodes.  To Tony’s astonishment, Rhodey saluted right back.
“Obie, I just.” He paused, his giddiness momentarily interrupted. “I don’t want a body count to be our only legacy, that’s it.”
“I’m already packed.  I really do understand. I wouldn’t lie to anyone, I wouldn’t tell anyone anything at all.  It was my fault.”
Tony grinned. “That means we can have sex, right? Cause I gotta tell you, I’ve been dying to see what you’ve got down there.” He hooked Steve with his ankle and flipped them. “I told you,” he said smugly, pulling Steve’s pants off.  “Well, hello there,” he purred, looking positively gleeful to get his hands on Steve’s dick. Or, his mouth, anyway.  He kissed his way down Steve’s body, tonguing his balls, swirling them on his tongue, licking along the seam.  Steve’s cock jumped, straining.
“You, are a dream.  You are seriously, the best thing. I love you.  You complete me,” Tony rambled to Jarvis, following the smell of delivery. He stopped short as he turned the corner and saw Steve Rogers, freshly showered by the look of it and wearing a shirt that was just worn enough to cling rather enticingly, slicing a pie in the middle of the kitchen.  Steve promptly blushed, his cheeks pinking just slightly.
Steve handed him a coffee. He must have known Tony didn’t stop in the kitchen like normal.  Tony’d said once he didn’t like being handed things.  It was true, but Steve was different. “They’re fine,” Steve told him. “Back to normal.  Apparently the lady was trying to recreate the effects of an infatuation spell through science.  Good news for us, there’s a formula and some pretty good experimental notes. Not even that bad intentions, even.  She posted an open apology last night. She just wants everyone to get along better.”
“I know,” Steve replies. “I’m sorry.” He draws his knees up onto the couch, rests his head on them, looks up at Tony like he’s saying goodbye. He tries to smile, that Captain America smile, the smile that says that he’s okay, everything’s okay, even though nothing is okay and they’re both a little broken.
“Stern or Stark?” Bucky teased.  He knew Steve’s type, watched him fall for a feisty temperament with a sharp brain and dark eyes before.
Somehow, they ended up in Steve’s room, in his bed. But every time Tony tried to get rid of Steve’s pants, he managed to divert his hands somewhere else.  Finally Tony gave up.  He looked at Steve, inches from his face, mouth gorgeously pink from kissing.  Steve held back from chasing his mouth.
The night continues its watch, sheltering them in the deep protection of starlight, sex eventually giving way to sleep after Tony tries to express his revelation with his body, with his touch, as many ways as he knows how, and Steve seems to understand, tries to show him that they are in this together.
“Um, hey guys, does anyone know why Justin Hammer is at my door?” Steve asked curiously.  “Is he even in chemistry this year?”
What exactly did Stern want with Steve, anyway? Well.  Maybe Tony couldn’t take back his crass actions in the limo.  Maybe he couldn’t erase the time Steve had spent playing his assistant.  But he could protect him from whatever Stern wanted. Probably. Men like Stern, like Howard, they understood money and power and threats.  They had to be bullied, or bribed.  Tony had years of practice playing this game, and Tony had learned from the best—Howard had been better at it than this orange buffoon.  Howard had been better at it than nearly anyone. And he was, he thought acidly, his father’s son.  He could see it tonight.  Wouldn’t Howard be proud? Tony fought the queasiness, the nausea.
Steve looked pointedly around the room, the cops finishing up, Pepper, Rhodey. Then he smiled faintly. “I’m all in, Tony. But… I can wait.”
It probably said something about their shared life experience that they all froze immediately, listening hard.
You know, these emails are the brightest part of my day.  Not that I don’t enjoy school and everything, but. Well.  I just thought you should know.
“Weird,” Tony said, glancing around.  “Do you like your room? You need new sheets, you know that?” He huffed a breath.  “Nice view, though.  Skyline looks great from this side.” He stretched. “Well.  I should get back to my own room.  Thanks for the crashpad, Rogers.”
Although he couldn’t hear anything, it was clear that Mr. Stark hadn’t noticed he was there.  He jumped, almost dropped the soldering gun, and turned to look at Steve.  He saw him say something, but couldn’t hear it.  The door clicked unlocked, and Steve opened it.
“A day.  Maybe two.” His phone rang.  He looked at it.  Steve.  Was he in trouble? Was Stern trying something again? Apologizing to Obie and promising to return immediately, he started up the stairs to the living room. It had been a long day and a longer night before, and Tony’s exhaustion showed. The dying reactor probably didn’t help. His progress up the stairs was slow and his breath came heavy and difficult. The phone continued ringing in his hand, long after it should have stopped.  Apparently Pepper had shared the secret of how to bypass voicemail. Hitting answer when he reached the sofa, he quickly put the phone to his ear.
She posted on insta and ShieldSpies after the administration wouldn’t say anything “to protect privacy.” Tony had set an alert on his phone, and tweet after tweet went after Hammer and Hodge.  Hammer got his legal team on it immediately, but damage was done. The gossip sites—real gossip sites, not just high schoolers—picked up on the story since Hammer was such a big name in tech.  CNN started interviews by the time school was out—Howard even did a videoconference, gloating.  It was ugly, even to Tony.
“Alas, you’ve caught me, brother,” Loki said languidly, blinking up at them from the bed. “And just when I’d gotten so… comfortable.” He looked up at Steve from under heavy eyelashes, smiling slyly. “You’re very impressive, Captain,” Loki drawled, winking at him. Steve’s blush intensified. He couldn’t help it.  He’d let that stupid kitten roam all over him while he was wearing next to nothing.  It couldn’t get any worse. Loki looked him up and down, then trailed a hand up his thigh. “Very impressive.”
A motorcycle. Mother dead a few years. Harry Potter. Playing a sport. SATs. No. No no no. There was no way, was there? He couldn’t be this much of an asshole just to cover up his secrets?  If he was, Jesus, he’d done too good a job. No way to ask right now.  Maybe Tony could just drop some hints in an email tonight? See if he’d had a particularly bad day?
Nat made a skeptical sounding noise. “Steve was a cute kid,” she said, noticing one of the photos in the hallway.  She left Tony standing there, slipping into the bathroom.
Steve hadn’t been able to sleep all night.  At 10am precisely, Coulson walked into Steve’s office, holding a stack of thick manila files.
The look Steve flashed him was grateful, as much for the lack of questions as the lie.  Then he took the elevator to his room and shower.  As soon as he disappeared, Tony told Jarvis to find everything he could on Steve Rogers.
Tony tried to get up when the doorbell rang, but it appeared physically impossible from the way he was wedged in between them all.
Tony stepped out of the suit, left it on the porch.  “Did you… When you… That morning when…” He fidgeted a little with his phone in his hand, prowling the tiny room.  He didn’t say anything about the bedspread, although he briefly scanned the bookshelf, eyes catching for a second on the three copies of
Sam texted around noon; he had time for a run.  Steve pulled himself out of bed and into the shower.  Running was good.  Physical exertion was healthy, and it wasn’t like they had to talk the whole time.
The room went black.  Tony straightened his hair, wiped his hands on his shirt, and walked down.  Clearly, Barnes knew he was caught. It wasn’t like he could go anywhere.
“Initializing prismatic accelerator,” Jarvis announced.  Tony grabbed a wrench.  The last part had to be cranked by hand.
“But—and I may be overstepping my bounds here, it’s pretty common with me—I feel like you shouldn’t worry about being what your parents want you to be. You said you wanted to be good for them.  You’re still good, Flying.  I mean, I don’t really know you, but I feel like I know what kind of a person you are.  The guy who worries about his friends getting bullied when
