“I tell you what—you finish this last set and get through one more round of leg curls and I’ll treat you to pizza.” Dean watches as Castiel hesitates a moment, mid-lift, and tilts his head. Dean’s eyes go wide as he realizes he may be crossing the line here, inviting Cas to stay for dinner.
Castiel's finger runs up along the underside of his cock with the lightest touch, and Dean gasps at the pleasure of it.
“God Dean, no, of course he didn’t. He just told me I was...pretty...and he hoped he’d see me again. Like I said, creepy alpha.” Sam goes back to his waffles while Dean tries not to lose his ever loving shit.
“That’s a shame, Dean. There are powerful antioxidants in leafy greens, including the carotenes that compose vitamin A—which I’m sure you know are phytonutrients genetically low in omegas,” Castiel rattles off casual, swirling his wine glass around. Dean gapes at him a little, looking thoroughly surprised.
“Nonsense.” Castiel opens his eyes again and smiles, his heart so full it feels like bursting. “Dean…what do you think I should do?”
Dean lets out a long sigh before looking up at Castiel. His expression is that same firm, immovable look. “Collar, calling you Master, and following your rules. Got it.” He isn’t so sure how good he’ll feel about all that once they reach Sioux Falls, but he’s sure as hell gonna try.
Here is Chapter 13, you will get an update on Sam and some POV from Cas and Dean in this chapter. I also plan to post 14 shortly after this one so hold tight!
“I think I can help you out with both things, Mister Novak,” Dean smiles at him. “What kind of rope are you looking for?” His eyes follow as the mans long fingers trail over the different ropes, from cotton, to nylon, to hemp and even some jute. There are a lot of options.
Dean chuckles in a far-off, distant way, turning his head but keeping his eyes closed. “I like the sound of that,” he says, softly now, then he drifts into a deep and peaceful sleep, leaving Castiel confused and emotional—alone with his thoughts.
“Hey, bud. You ready for dinner?” he asks, giving Cash a pat on the neck as he secures the halter. Cash has on a light sheet that Dean bought him in red with black piping to keep off the rain and wind. He puts his hand down beneath the sheet to feel his chest and make sure he’s warm. Satisfied, he leads the horse into his stall.
“That's good at least.” He scuffs at the ground with his foot, thinking how much he misses Cash. He eventually has to head back to the barn to finish his chores. Ellie has a few afternoon lessons and the farm is busy with riders and the farrier coming to shoe and trim the horses as well. He’s fairly tired by the time he glances up to see Sam’s car coming down the drive.
“So alluring,” Castiel mumbles, licking and sucking on the only patch of skin he can currently reach. The song begins over again and his sub is suddenly chuckling above him, his laughs making Castiel withdraw.
“Now you’re too late,” Dean says with a low chuckle. Castiel sighs, on the verge of giving up when he feels Dean push up behind him. The proximity makes his breath catch in his throat, his hand white-knuckling the fishing rod as he tries to remain collected. Dean reaches his hand and places it over Castiel’s, moving the alpha’s index finger down to the line.
“No thanks needed, just doing what you taught me,” Sam sees the question on his face and adds, “taking care of family.”
"Yeah, go on ahead. Anything that can't be re-purposed on an actual car is all yours. What in the hell your gonna do with it, though, is beyond me." Bobby shook his head, going back into the house.
“Now this is the kind of dessert I like to have after lunch.” Castiel licks over one nipple, making him shiver before he pulls back to stare at him.
Dean frowns, lifting his arm and sniffing. Sam isn’t wrong—those blockers stood no chance against the chlorine. He shuffles a little, feeling embarrassed that he’s so transparent.
“Alright,” he whispers in agreement, and once his knot goes down they jump in the shower, preparing for Sam’s arrival and the long, busy day ahead.
“Surprise surprise,” Gabriel says sarcastically. “You haven’t answered your phone in days, and whenever you do, it’s ‘not a good time.’”
“You’ve got a big heart, and a knack with troubled teens. I could put in a good reference for you at the KU School of Social Welfare. The head of the program there owes me a few favors.”
okay, and he isn’t sure what his decision is going to be because he never thought Dean would offer him
Castiel seems to recover though, going back to his set with a slightly reduced scowl on his face. “I find that acceptable...if I can pick the toppings?”
“Fine,” he snaps, flipping to the last page of the contract and snatching up a pen. His hand hovers over the paper, breathing in his last few seconds of freedom—praying for something to stop this, anything.
“I don’t understand that reference,” he deadpans, thinking his sub will smile and laugh, will kiss him again.
Right as Michael’s finger goes to hit the remote Dean shifts his upper body forward. It's awkward and agonizing and he isn’t sure how he doesn’t fall over, but somehow he pulls himself to kneeling.
“Maybe one day I’ll see you with a real cock in your mouth, while I’m buried in your ass,” Castiel growls, mostly just dirty talk, though he’s surprised by how turned on he is by this idea. He’s healthily possessive of Dean, more than anyone he’s ever dated or dommed, but his boyfriend loves cock so much that just the image of him being surrounded by more men, mouth stuffed full and hands stroking cocks, makes Castiel feel heady and reckless. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you, slut? Me owning you while you have so many cocks ready for you, you don’t even know what to do with them?”
At the opposite end of the table, Castiel hears a sarcastic snort. Dean blushes, staring back down at his plate as if that reaction had escaped accidentally.
“Of course I knew. Come now, you think I don’t know my own daughter? Or you, for that matter?” She looks between them.
“It’s none of your business who I call, but I get my damn phone call.” Dean grits his teeth and tries not to wince in pain at the manhandling. With some of his adrenaline gone, he’s starting to feel all his aches and pains from his fight.
She straightened up and trailed off to another room. Ruby had given Sam two conditions for joining the Hand: firstly, he had to help them hack into confidential Fist sites - something he was more than happy to do. The second was he couldn't breath a word about his brother to anyone, not even other members of the Hand. If he followed those rules she would help him find and free Dean. The second request made no sense to Sam. Why he would need to keep that a secret from the other members of the Hand? But he was in no position to bargain, and there wasn't anything he wouldn't do to get Dean back. Sam typed as fast he could, feeling with each key stroke he was closer to finding his brother.
“Oh, aren’t you the prettiest picture,” Castiel hums, running his hand up the cover of Dean’s back. “Since you can’t speak, I want you to stick two fingers out if you have an emergency and need my help. Do you understand?”
“Please sir, please,” he whines and Castiel sinks the digit into him and they both let out moans at the tight clench of his hole.
Sam turns his classic bitch face on him before moving to put things away. “Pie is not on-diet, man.”
Not bothering with shoes, he pads down the hallway toward the library. It’s become a nightly ritual for him now, going to the library. He checks to make sure it’s empty before heading in. He only flicks on the small desk lamp and then moves over to the biology section, where he left off. He has to climb the ladder a bit, but he finds the book he’s looking for, pulling it down and heading to the table where Sam normally does his homework.
Dean doesn’t answer—just closes his eyes and shakes his head, a fresh wave of tears streaming down his cheeks. Interpreting this as Dean’s surrender, Castiel reaches for the strap of leather holding Dean’s arms to the cross. When he touches the buckle, though, Dean’s eyes snap open.
“Only my good boy is allowed to do that,” Castiel says, emphasizing his regret, as if the decision is out of his hands. And it
“Still doesn’t explain why.” Dean mumbled, rolling onto his stomach and pillowing his head on his folded arms, looking over at Cas.
Castiel’s eyes shoot up, a smirk forming on his face. “See? That was exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean stands stock-still, staring at his feet on the matted playroom floor. Castiel has removed his plug and cage, leaving him in just his collar. He wants to squirm, but he wants to be a good boy
Dean can’t help but grin as he watches Castiel shift in the seat next to him. Peering up at the rearview, Sam fidgets in the back, running his hands through his too-long hair for the millionth time. It’s strange to be the calm one in the car. He thinks he should be more worried about this, but he just can’t bring himself to be. He’s about to have all his favorite people in one place and all that brings him is excitement. It’s been two weeks since the night the power went out and they’ve fallen into a wonderful new kind of rhythm together, like they finally found their footing with their burgeoning relationship, and this just feels like the next natural step.
He’s very close already, his erection stiff and pink and glistening wet, and the sub increases his speed, rutting against Castiel and clinging to his upper thigh. Castiel is falling over the edge again, the rough rhythm of his sub clinging to him increasing the momentum, and he demands, “Come for me,
Gabriel blows air through the receiver and says, “There’s a beta I know—a guy who works downtown. He did some marketing for the casino once. His name is Inias, and I showed him your picture a few years ago—he visited the offices in Nevada—and he basically drooled all over you.”
“I would require your resume, of course, and any academic transcripts,” Castiel says matter-of-factly. “This is a job offer, Dean. Everything will be done above board. Are you in college now?”
"Sir, do you know what you would like for dinner?" Tessa asked in a soft voice. Apparently she was reluctant to wake the sleeping Dean either.
He straightens up then, speaking directly to the other Dom in the room. “Can you take her out of the scene, and provide aftercare? I have to find Dean.”
“I would like to suspend you, Dean, then pink up this beautiful skin for me.” Castiel’s hands never leave his skin as they test and tug at all the harness, checking it all over.
He looks up and realizes he has angry tears in his eyes. He wipes them fast on his sleeve before he spots Cas standing a few feet away. The alpha looks incredible, hair swept back and sleeves rolled-up, his suspenders off his shoulders and dangling by his hips. Dean glances up and sees most of the lights in the house are off, and wonders how long he’s been out here. Long enough for his legs to go a bit numb.
“Fuck me, baby, come on.” Castiel tightens his hands on the headboard, giving himself better leverage, and then Dean’s cock strikes his prostate and he cries out. “God, right there, right fucking there—”
“I need time, Sam, time to figure out what our next move is…alright?” He lifts the pot of boiling pasta, arms shaking, and nearly drops it. Luckily Sam swoops in to help, grabbing Dean’s hands and steadying him. “Thanks,” he mumbles. Can’t even drain pasta on his own.
“We can try,” he says lightly, accepting the knife graciously and opening it. He looks between the hive and Dean, then says, “You may want to back away.”
Dean seems pleasantly surprised by these instructions, and follows them closely while Castiel finishes laying out the spread for lunch. He then takes his seat at the table, putting Dean’s mat on the left side, closest to the view. The sub comes out wearing a slinky white robe, short and silky, and blushing a lovely shade of pink.
Fuck, he’d even admitted to finding the boots sexy. FlyBoy was probably going to wake up and think Dean was some kind of perv and never talk to him again. He rolls over, scowling, and pulls up his phone to reread the messages again. It had sounded like flirting…no scratch that—it
It deflates some of the anger puffed up in Dean’s chest, and the omega eventually mumbles, “Nothing, okay? Nothing. It was shitty being in there but there’s nothing you can do. So, sorry if I ruined your grand plans or whatever, but I don’t want to fucking talk about it because it doesn’t matter. Got it?”
“I told you when you signed the contract that your brother was welcome here. Though you did not provide notice he was coming and that does break the house rules.” Castiel gives him a stern look that makes Dean’s stomach turn to jello. “Seeing as you were simply trying not to interrupt while helping me get set up this morning, I can hardly fault you for it.”
He really hadn’t been expecting Cas to even bring up the cops. They’ve never really cared about Dom abuse in the past—hell, most of the force is made up of Doms and an occasional switch.
“Tell me when you’re close, Dean,” Castiel tells him, in a voice that sounds way too fucking calm for how utterly undone he feels. His hole clenching and releasing around the toy reminds him of his reward,
“Knew my whore would like that,” Castiel says appreciatively. “Now go and strip. Did you wear a pretty pair of panties for everyone to see?”
Dean grits his teeth, drawing in a deep, shaky breath. “You’re not going back there, Sam.” His brother nods, blinking his eyes and standing up tall. Dean can see the brave face his brother is putting on, and he isn’t sure if he should feel proud or sad. “Don’t know how we’re gonna figure out school, though. You have a few more weeks left and you can’t drive yourself yet.”
“Wait,” Crowley says, voice harsh and firm. Castiel turns around slowly, his jaw set tight, his teeth grinding.
Everyone quickly digs into their food and he has to admit it's damn good. He has a fleeting moment where he thinks of Benny and how much he’d love a good barbecue like this. Maybe that's a bridge he should try and mend soon. He gets a bit lost in thought till Cas brings him back into the conversation with stories of Lou and his antics.
“The next time I see any of you dickheads around,” he begins in a husky, threatening whisper, “I’m gonna let my knife do the talking. Get the fuck outta here. Now.”
“Research from two different labs. I need to be able to compare what each one found about the same formula, but it's taking me forever to manually calculate it all. Can you do that thing you did before on the other file?”
“He was spirited, a people pleaser. It was impossible not to like Jimmy. He lived a wholehearted life, wasn’t afraid of anything.” Joshua smiles, as if remembering. “His loss was very hard on all of us.”
He looks down at the phone again and wonders about calling Dr. Barnes. He wonders if she might know what's going on with him, since he feels stuck in this weird headspace. Maybe talking to her will ease his anxiety and he can be a better sub for his Dom. He calls her back and holds the phone tight to his ear.
“I’m afraid those are beyond a dry cleaner’s expertise,” Castiel says sadly, looking at the various stains—Roman’s blood, his blood, tears at the bottom cuff. He liked that suit quite a lot, but he has no intention of keeping it now and reliving that day.
Dick smirks at him, his gaze practically feral. “That means you are a virgin. Imagine, Castiel, the feeling of a tight virgin hole catching on your knot…”
Eventually everyone splits up to their tasks for the day. Castiel goes to assist Ellen and Missouri with party planning, while Alfie takes Joshua to a follow up appointment for his hip. Sam heads over to get the information he needs for his summer internship working on Jody Mills’s presidential campaign. After Jody had won a second term as governor she had set her sights higher, with omega reformation one of the biggest ticket items on her campaign.
He takes in all the rings along the walls, imagining all the ways he could be strung up. A low whine of anticipation comes out on an exhale, and he is never more grateful that he waited for Castiel.
He licked his lips a moment and cleared his throat before uttering the name he hadn’t said in years…
“Fuck off, Luc. Not in your dreams.” Dean scowls at the alpha, feeling the hair prickle on the back of his neck as he struggles to focus with this new piece of information.
Dean can’t help the scarlet blush to his cheeks. They must have read his ID card…they know he’s a submissive.
He stayed very still, not wanting to break the moment between them. Dean’s eyes fluttered open and he gave Cas a small, shy smile, ducking his head. He took that as his cue and drained the tub, grabbing a towel and helping Dean up. He helped to dry Dean off without letting his hands stray.
"Well, I don't know about any out of the ordinary plans, except that Nick is planning to go on a trip for the next month and asked that I stay at his place to house sit." He could feel Charlie's hand tighten on his shoulder but ignored her for the moment.
“Sounds good,” Castiel says, not meaning it. It seems to pacify Gabriel, though, and they chat for a few more minutes until Castiel heads downstairs. He skips breakfast, eager to bury his head in his work. Taking several days of unplanned time off is never good for his clients, and when he checks his inbox, he has two hundred emails and six calls scheduled for today. It’s going to be a very long and tedious day.
He tries to get his bearings when a guy grabs him from behind. Dean stomps the guy’s foot till he hears a howl, then pulls away. After that it’s a tangle of limbs and thrown punches, and Dean’s heart races as he grapples with the alphas, feeling his lip split and wincing as he’s tossed against the brick wall. He only hopes Sam stays inside—he doesn’t need his brother witnessing any of this.
he thinks and sighs as a cool cloth wipes him down and the cuffs and gag are removed. He collapses into the bed with his master, who hums softly, stroking his hair while he slowly but surely comes back to himself. “Thank you, so good for me, thank you,” the man whispers to him and Dean hums in pleasure. He’d made him happy…he could really get used to this whole Master thing.
They head down a small trail they took yesterday, once Dean’s heat was over and they could safely exit the confines of the cabin. They’re in a remote spot and there are no neighbors around, but Castiel still wouldn’t risk Dean’s safety until his pheromones had become somewhat muted again. Castiel slips his hand into Dean’s and the omega takes it gladly, grasping his fingers as they walk down the gravel.
Joshua’s eyebrows shoot up, as if he can’t believe Dean’s already heard about what happened to Castiel’s twin.
When Sam nor Dean answers, he tosses his phone into his briefcase, feeling restless. By the time Alfie has reached the correct street, Castiel is vibrating with energy and seething with alpha wrath.
“Dean?” Castiel pulls himself to sitting quickly, looking Dean up and down. “What's wrong, sweetheart?”
He’d found it easy to be confident with Castiel—something about being around the alpha gave Dean courage and made him more bold. Alone in his room later, though, the doubt had started to creep in. Fear that Castiel didn’t really want him, fear that Cas would never want to mate with him, fear that Cas
Castiel nods his approval, but crosses his arms against his chest, thinking hard. “Pull up his file.”
“You’d look perfect stretched around my knot, sweet omega,” he breathes, cock still knocking against Dean’s ass as his fingers travel down, seeking his hole—
He shakes his head, knowing Pam never likes to beat around the bush, well not that bush anyway. “Uh, yeah. I wanted some advice, actually.”
“Nah, Cas, you’re good.” When Dean looks at him, he has a mischievous twinkle in his eye. “It was fucking hot, to be honest.”
“Please what, my sweet boy? Tell me what you need,” Castiel encourages, and the stubble on his cheek tickles the back of Dean neck.
“Then let’s go inside,” Dean whispers, popping off Castiel’s cock long enough to speak, his voice sounding wrecked.
“You will do no such thing, just continue to take excellent care of my Oscar and we are square,” Rowena nods at him, bringing a hand up to flatten her hair that Dean frazzled a bit.
Dean locks the stretcher into place, feeling it rattle as his belligerent patient bounces around. Jo eyes him from the back of the truck, and clearly they are both thinking the same thing about this guy.
. They’re on equal footing, the sub taking as much as he’s receiving, and Castiel knows he should put an end to this…should focus back on the scene…but it feels so damn good, just being together in this way. He can’t remember the last time just kissing someone got him this hot and bothered, but he’s almost fully erect and feeling drunk with desire when he finally separates their lips.
“Well…yes,” Castiel mutters impatiently. “But that contract may not even be valid. Some of the results were switched, and… Well, it’s complicated, but I need to see Dean right now.”
Dean has gone from concerned to downright worried. No one is answering their phones and it’s mid-afternoon now. He’s been too busy caring for Sam to try any other way of contact. Gadreel is nowhere to be found, but Dean thinks that’s likely for the best as well. He doesn’t want too many people near Sam when he’s like this. Even going to the kitchen to get Sam a Gatorade, Dean can still smell the sweet omega heat scent. It’s never stronger than on an omega’s first day of their first heat. Some biological bullshit about attracting a mate.
Dean stares at the paper, up to Castiel, then down at the paper again. He does this several times before whispering, “You bought this on the day of Sammy’s first heat.”
“That’s all for today,” he replies, grabbing two bundles of the Jute rope. “Thank you for your help.”
“Smell so good, mmm,” Castiel practically purrs, rutting forward. Dean lets out an embarrassing whimper as he feels the hard line of the alpha’s cock on his leg. Castiel’s hand tightens in his hair as he noses at the base of his neck, making Dean go mad with want, body already slicking for Castiel.
“It’s gonna be okay, Dean.” Sam tries to reassure him, but all Dean feels is gut-wrenching terror and blissful relief at the thought of Cas.
The image of his dom wrapped around him has his cock stirring. That decides it for him…he is going to need something more to get himself calmed down. He pulls off his towel and digs through his bottom drawer till he pulls out a long bunch of blue rope. He’d bought it not long ago when the bright color and soft texture had stood out to him. He is fairly skilled with ropework and even read a few books on shibari that Pam had leant him.
“Good boy, so good. I am so proud of you,” Castiel tells him, and Dean feels the praise soothe his ragged nerves. He blinks up at Castiel, eyes squinting as the room feels softer around the edges.
Castiel feels a flash of momentary guilt—he and Dean decided to stop using scent blockers at home, since scenting each other as mates is practically compulsory—but he can’t focus on that issue right now, not if there’s something more pressing going on. Jo grabs him by the shoulder and drags him toward the living room, the non-formal one with a large television and an L-shaped couch.
“But he’s right? Isn’t he?” Dean’s voice is stronger now, more insistent. “Are you even in the registry?”
Michael chuckles. “Oh, we’re not one of those fancy facilities. It’s not about us changing for the subs…it’s about the subs realizing the Doms are in charge and adjusting to their needs. Because of that, the first day is pretty standard—sadism, serious impact play, and obedience training with a shock collar.”
He whines as Castiel teases and pulls at his nipple through his shirt, body rolling and hips bucking up, looking for contact. His jeans are getting tighter and more uncomfortable by the minute, and Castiel just keeps kissing him, running his hands over him in light touches that are driving him mad. He tries to kiss back harder, nipping at Castiel’s lip and trying to nuzzle towards his neck. He wants Castiel, and he wants all of him now. But a firm hand on his chest keeps him in place as he struggles for more.
“I am going to put you on your knees on that bed, then I am going to tie your upper body to that ring up there in the ceiling. Then I will bind your hands and your legs so you are at the perfect level for me to fill all your needy holes... What color, Dean?”
“Hey there,” comes a deep, friendly voice that sounds as familiar as it is welcoming. The newcomer is speaking quickly, obviously in a rush, as Castiel scrambles to greet him. “So, Missouri forwarded me your chart, but it isn’t done downloading. Thought I’d come introduce myself while we wait for our ancient technology to catch up.” There’s a slight chuckle, one meant to put someone at ease. “My name is—”
Missouri eyes him with distrust and mischief, throwing her hands up. “Sir, you don’t pay me judge. But if you did…” She drops her voice down to a whisper. “I’d say you’ve gotten yourself into quite the predicament, haven’t you?”
Dean grunts out a laugh. “Can you fucking blame me, man, with alphas like Dick Roman wandering around—thinking I’m a basically just a hole to fuck?”
“G-good, thank you, Doctor,” the man responds, breathing heavy and holding impossibly still. Castiel wiggles his finger around, hooking it slightly until he brushes the nub that he knows is the man’s prostate, and the sub whines and pulls against the restraint.
“Ellie is here, and last time I checked he was my horse. Rowena signed the bill of sale over in my name.” Dean nods rubbing a hand down Cash’s neck. The horse’s head bumps against Castiel’s side, and sniffs at his jeans pockets looking for a treat.
“I know,” Dean says, hands reaching to unbutton Castiel’s pants. “But some other sub had her paws all over you, and I’m fucking pissed, okay? So if anyone’s gonna get you off, it’s
Castiel flushes, chuckling nervously and staring down at his glass of ice water. Dean sits quietly after that, just waiting for Castiel to take the lead. The alpha finally takes a deep breath, and says in a rush, “Dean, what happened between us today is something I’ve thought about.”
“Hey, it’s my right as big brother to bust his chops,” Dean answers. “Besides, him having a meltdown that night gave me an excuse to leave the party early and weasel you away from that douchebag who was drooling all over you.”
Bobby whistles. “You oughta try law school after college, boy. You’re pretty good at arguing a point.”
He maintains tight circles around the table, not touching his sub apart from fruit dropping onto his bare skin, and he sees the man shudder. Without warning Castiel bends over, mouthing at a strawberry slice near his belly button, and his sub’s body trembles as a soft moan escapes his lips. Castiel’s mouth is wet and wild, leaving open mouth kisses and lavish licks as he chews and swallows the fruit.
“See! He can’t keep his mouth shut for two seconds. I’ve had to correct him several times already for not using appropriate titles with me.” Gordon glares at Dean, and he bites his cheek to prevent shouting at him and proving him right in front of Castiel.
His eyes caught on the one bit of color on the page. Dean had colored in the blue in his eyes and it made them stand out, making it look like Cas was staring out from the sketch pad.
By the middle of the week, a package arrives on Castiel’s front stoop. On the outside there’s a return address for Dean scrawled in tiny, messy script. Inside is a hardcover book of Mary Oliver’s selected poems, Castiel’s favorite writer…a fact he’d mentioned in passing months ago but Dean somehow remembered. There’s an inscription on the title page:
Dean smiles at her and nods, thinking the sooner he gets his barings the better. Shooting off a quick text to Sam telling him he made it fine, he tucks his phone in his pocket and gestures for her to lead the way.
“You’re fine now, Sam, but you just started your heat. It's gonna get a lot worse, okay, and your needs are gonna get a lot stronger. Just keep them nearby, in case you need them. Take some Advil too, it should help the fever.”
A cool, gravely voice breaks the silence in the room, and the buzzing in his head. “Just a moment, omega. I may have another option.”
“Th-thirteen,” Dean breathes, and Castiel brings his hand down again and again, watching in rapt attention as Dean begins to moan after each hit. The cries of pain have turned to cries of pleasure, and the last trace of tension leaves Dean’s shoulders as he drops, fully submitting to Castiel.
“Let’s begin with Inspection Pose,” Castiel says, hands tucked in his pocket. Dean lowers himself down down, knees and hands shoulder-width apart, head down and ass perked and on display. “Very good. Nadu?”
“How, uh…so how does that work? Sir?” He knows there's blood tests involved, but he’s been kind of avoiding asking about the subject with Castiel. He doesn’t like thinking about leaving Cas.
“Hmm…” Castiel’s hands can’t help wandering over his sub’s face, stroking his cheek bones and petting his freckles. “Is that why I spotted at you the bar, talking to another dom? Because you missed me?”
Sam doesn’t look convinced, but he at least doesn’t challenge Dean the rest of the way back to Bobby’s. He waves goodbye to a worried-looking Sam and heads toward Cain’s house.
“Sleep, Alpha,” Dean mumbles, feeling exhaustion dragging him back under. He feels lips press to the top of his head, and Cas shifts and moves till he goes still as well, falling into an easy sleep.
Dean looks down at his feet, a slight blush coloring his cheeks. “Mighta been practicing with Ellen all week. Wanted to surprise you.”
bed—feeling both clammy and hot at the same time. He swears he can still smell Dean on his sheets, even though the janitorial staff washed them days ago without his permission. He nearly went into a rage when he came back after working a sixteen-hour shift just to see his perfectly rumpled bed, with Dean’s sandalwood scent still intact on the pillow case, washed and dried and remade. It’s unfathomable to him that some people are carrying on with their daily lives—like the world hasn’t collapsed around Castiel, even though it has.
Dean smiles, shaking his head at his highly intelligent friend being a complete bonehead. The rope had been a great idea, just like jerking off, and he can tell he staved off a potentially shitty day by using them. It’s no replacement for his dom though—the actual warm arms, the caring in his eyes. He feels better knowing his friend is taking care of himself, though surely having a lot less fun than Dean had been.
As filthy daydreams pass through his head, Castiel vaguely recognizes that all the songs sound immensely familiar. It isn’t until he finds himself humming along to a Zeppelin tune that it finally occurs to him—
Castiel nods approvingly. They’ve only been home for about five minutes, but Dean is already looking significantly better now that he’s washed the blood from his face and hands. Between them, Castiel thankfully bears the brunt of the injuries. He knows he should head upstairs and take care of himself, but just the thought of climbing the grand staircase makes his body ache.
“That’s not decorative, you know,” Ellen grumbles at the other end of the table, staring at Dean’s untouched salad. Castiel blinks back into the conversation, trying not to let his thoughts run away with him.
“Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, I am.” He purses his lips a little in that same way he used to do when they were kids and Sam got his first crush in school.
He hears a female voice calling, and looks up to see a brunette standing by the front of the room calling his name.
“So beautiful for me,” Castiel hums almost to himself. He then quickly pulls a rope through a ring on the harness at Dean's chest. Taking both ends, he runs them in between Dean's legs and proceeds to tie them to his ankles, keeping him from being able to straighten up, while the rope in the ceiling keeps him from falling forward.
Castiel chuckles. “Hmm, I have some ideas. I see you registering for classes, finding something you love to do, probably saving the world. I can take a step back from big business, focus on projects I’m passionate about with business partners I don’t feel the urge to murder.” Dean barks a small laugh at that. “Find ways to make you laugh,” Castiel adds with a grin. He hesitates, then his voice comes softer. “Maybe even…have children?”
“Happiness and health go hand in hand,” Pam interjects sharply. “Especially for high-levels like you and Dean.” When Castiel looks down and doesn’t answer, she says, “Or do you think I’m wrong? Me, the medical professional you pay an exorbitant amount of money each month?”
He went to the kitchen where Jo had made a few peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for herself and the girls. He requested four more and she happily obliged, confused when he refused a more complex lunch. He brought the sandwiches and glasses of water out to where Dean was sitting and nervously set them down.
He writhes on the toy as his sweaty hand strips his aching cock. His mind starts to fade into a fever haze. His body rocks against the damp sheets, skin aflame and freezing all at once. He smells his own faint cinnamon tangled up with the bitter oil and can’t hold back the whine.
Dean hesitates—he doesn’t want Castiel to worry about him. At the same time, he wants him to understand just how badly he needs out of there.
good enough that Castiel volunteers to help again sometime. Almost. Over dinner they don’t discuss anything consequential, just small talk about their friends and work and Dean’s progress in reading
She just shrugs. “They weren’t bad. Weren’t exactly awesome, either—something like seventy-nine? Or maybe, eighty percent?” She grips the arms of the chair, sitting up straight now. “We didn’t really care, though. We knew any relationship is a gamble, but as long as we’re committed to each other, that’s all that matters.”
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam adds, as he gets up and brushes off the grass from his jeans. They hear the back patio door open and close, and catch sight of Gadreel coming outside.
He dries off, ignoring his half-hard cock as he walks back into his bedroom and begins to dress. Just being in the shower and thinking about Dean is enough to make his body react favorably, but he hasn’t scened or orgasmed since Dean left. He knows it’s unhealthy, and the longer he waits the more he’s going to fall into Dom drop, but there’s a dark part of him that thinks he deserves to be punished. He was so sure of their connection that he never once prepared Dean for the possibility that they might be separated. That seventy-four point five percent compatible score is printed in his memory like ink bleeding onto paper. He’s confused by it, devastated by it, unsure of it, but he’s checked the numbers himself and there’s nothing he can do.
“After this I deserve all the things,” Dean replies, arms crossed and eyes on the road as they drive towards his fate.
“Miss MacLeod…are you talking about my contract?” Sam asks, shifting in his seat. So far, they’ve been unsuccessful in finding the contract or learning who would inherit ownership.
“I tried to get him out tonight,” Castiel says, feeling pained at the thought of letting his good boy down, “but the administration has the transfer paperwork from his previous Dom, so they’re holding him.”
“I just want to make this good for you,” Castiel admits in a quiet voice, trying to push through the haze of lust to make Dean understand his intentions. “We’ve never done this before, with each other or anyone else—as alpha and omega, at least. So I need you to communicate with me. If anything makes you uncomfortable, or doesn’t feel good, then we can—”
There are more impact toys on the other wall, and he walks across the clean white floors and sees the rugs and large pillows, a regular leather seating bench facing what Dean figures is a traditional triangle spanking bench. It reminds him of the one he made for Balthazar last year.
“We can get you some popcorn at the movie,” Inias suggests, and Castiel’s interest in piqued. It’s been a long time since he’s since a film at the theater, and if this date is continuing, he’d rather have an excuse for silence to settle between them. He’s exhausted all his pre-selected first-date topics, and now he’s just drawing a blank. It doesn’t help that, at some point over dessert, he spent the better part of twenty minutes talking about Dean. Inias had asked a simple question about Castiel’s staff, and that somehow digressed into Castiel cataloging how impressive Dean’s classic rock knowledge is.
“You saw him without me? Dean, you could have gotten hurt! What if his jackass friends were back there? What if they tried something on you?” Sam looks furious, eyes glistening. If Dean didn’t know better, he’d say his brother was fighting back tears.
Breakfast passes without any further outbursts from John, and Castiel is pleased when Dean asks for a second helping of eggs. Dean’s dad flees the table as soon as he’s finished, and Bobby just grunts and rolls his eyes, scoffing and pouring a little whiskey in his coffee. Castiel and Sam scrub the breakfast dishes together, chatting about Sam’s senior year and all the AP classes he’s enrolled in.
The omega looks down at the ground, then back up at Castiel, eyes determined. “Listen, god knows I’ve wanted to be yours for…for forever. But not like this—not because you feel like you have to—”
“Don’t forget your toy, Toy,” Castiel reminds him evenly, “it sounds like you might need it.” The sub’s cheeks flush a beautiful pink as he reaches down for the cock cage and stuffs it in his open bag. He exits the room with his head down, though his eyes are on Castiel’s lips, and the minute the closes, the dom leans into the mattress and sighs happily.
“Let me,” he says, shooing Dean’s hand away. He kisses his collarbones, his chest, then latches onto a nipple, enjoying the feeling of Dean squirming beneath him as he works the nub over. Then he sinks lower, leaving kisses on his belly and his hips, and when he’s finally reached his destination, he looks back up at Dean with a predatory smile. “Please tell me you’re clean, because I’ve been dying to taste you.”
“Your biggest weakness, the thing I noticed the moment I met you, is your courage—your reckless bravado. That is what is standing between you and your submission. Do you need me to lay it out for you, boy? You are mine now. You don’t belong to anyone else but me.” Cain gives him an almost sad smirk.
“Hey Cas! Sorry I missed your call. Gilda and I tried to this new LARPing group, and dear gay lord in heaven, it’s lifechanging. She’s been testing out this new handmaiden outfit for me, which is just…” Charlie whistles loudly. “My girlfriend looks so hot, it should be illegal.”
Dean stands with the steady hand Cas provides, then his dom gets to work tightening his collar and harness. The leather tugs on his skin and cinches around his torso, snug but not constricting. “How does that feel? Color, Dean?”
“Castiel, what a pleasant surprise,” he says dryly. “I didn’t expect to see you back after our last meeting, though judging by your scent, you’re
“Oh, y’know, finally sealing the deal with your online bestie. Never woulda thought he wasn’t a secret creeper, though it’s only your first date, so the jury’s still out.”
Before Castiel can answer, Dick snorts loudly. “Novak? God no. He’s a perpetual bachelor.” He drops his voice down low, as if he’s releasing a scandalous bit of gossip even though Castiel is sitting right next to him. “Don’t you read
. It was nuts! I’m only a beta, a ladies-only beta at that, but even I couldn’t walk by the west wing without catching a whiff of that. You were putting out some serious ‘down to clown’ vibes.”
“You as well,” Castiel answers, coming closer as his father touches his shoulder. “Were you writing?”
“Come, Dean,” he says in a commanding rumble, and walks back toward his office. Victor and the others just watch, silent, as the sub follows at his heels.
he isn’t quite sure…but in the end, he just chuckles dryly. “You’re good. More persuasive than I remember, which is saying a lot.”
Dean’s shirtless upper body is lying flat on the table, tears rolling down his cheeks. There’s a bite mark distinct and bloody on his scent gland. In the main frame there’s only Dick Roman, suit barely ruffled, mouth red and sloppy with Dean’s blood. They’re in the police station.
“Let’s get you home.” Joshua and Missouri begin to open the doors of the SUV, with Alfie siding open the driver’s door. Dean moves to climb in after Joshua, but Castiel puts a hand on his back, shepherding him backwards. Dean jerks away skittishly and Castiel drops his hand, feeling like he’s been burned.
He tells Pam and Gabriel goodbye in a flurry, heading for the elevators with a nervous thrum in his chest. He’s already calculating the drive to Sioux Falls. If he packs in twenty minutes, he’ll be on the road in thirty, and with the two-hour drive and no stops for the bathroom, he’ll be there by ten or so… He mentally assembles a packing list, wondering if he should pack enough clothes for days or weeks, knowing the answer depends entirely on if Dean is willing to leave his current Dom. He hasn’t actually read the contract Dean signed with Cain—since his father keeps those on his private server—but figures it’ll be the standard agreement. Exiting on his own terms should be easy enough to navigate, especially since Castiel was one of the files chosen for Dean’s trial placement.
He hangs his drenched trenchcoat on the coat rack, but he’s still soaked to the bone. The magnitude of the last few days hit him all at once—he’s barely eaten or slept. He’s moved from one crisis to another, his fear and longing for Dean buzzing like static in the back of his brain. His nerves are on-edge with the news he has to deliver to Dean’s family—especially John Winchester, who’s passed out on the couch with an arrangement of empty beer bottles at his feet.
“State facility. Where else?” Cain shakes his head. Castiel feels like the air has been punched from his stomach. He’s never set foot in a state-funded submissive training facility before, but he’d heard plenty of stories and more than a handful of rumors.
“Something like that,” Castiel says, returning the smile. He makes a point to look at them both, though Sam is standing several yards away. Cas notices the bruise on the teen’s face is fading, thankfully…though he frowns at it all the same. Dean takes a step towards him, so close their arms are almost brushing, and whispers, “It’s, uh, from some douchebag guy at school—not our dad, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
, because Castiel is currently being reminded of why he never cooks. Honestly, if Dean or Ellen aren’t shoving food under his nose, he barely eats—some days he just forgets.
“I know you’re not Jimmy. I know you’re strong and healthy and full of life. I know you have an incredible future ahead of you, not only as a parent, but as someone who’s helping to change the world. But if something goes wrong and I lose you, I…” His voice breaks and Dean kicks off his drawstring shorts, his boxers along with it, and then he’s fully naked and straddling Castiel’s lap. He surges up to kiss Castiel’s forehead, just as the alpha whispers, “I would never recover, Dean. You’re my whole world.”
“Mouthy as well,” Crowley says approvingly. “That’s preferred. Nothing bores me more than an omega who simply bends over and takes it.”
Castiel’s heart pounds, his face softening. He squats low, so his face is closer to Dean’s, and he reaches out with a tentative hand, putting it on Dean’s forearm. “I’m so sorry for everything you’ve been through since you left Purgatory, Dean.”
There was a seat in the shower, and Dean convinced Cas he could take it from there, so the man finally left him to get cleaned up. The warm water was amazing on his aching muscles and he scrubbed himself three times with Castiel’s body wash till he began to feel human again. He even managed to dry off with one of his big fluffy towels, and wrapped it around his waist before going back out into the room. He saw Castiel finishing putting new sheets on the bed and gathering up the dirty ones in his arms.
“Good morning,” Gabriel chirps, as if sensing Castiel’s thoughts. “What’s on the agenda today for my successful, badass, swoon-worthy baby bro?”
Dean can’t believe Cas will really just let Sam stay like this. “Are you sure it won’t be too much trouble?”
And yet as Castiel slides into his Lincoln Continental, he can’t help but fantasize about being reunited with Dean tonight. What would it be like to see that man kneeling at his feet, miles of golden skin at his fingertips, those plump pink lips parted for his cock? His jeans grow tighter just at the image, and he adjusts himself in the car, stopping at a red light and impatiently tapping on the steering wheel. He needs a release, and he needs it now.
Dean reaches towards the first-aid kit, and when he turns back around, he has gauze and bandages in his hands
Castiel can feel heat radiating from his skin, his head nearly feverish with rage. His father not only willingly sent Dean off with a Dom he was not that compatible with, he also wrote in a clause sending him somewhere other than Purgatory?
He knocks on his father’s door and a blonde sub answers, wearing a thin robe with her head tucked down. She’s half of his father’s age, but considering Dean is young as well, Castiel figures he has no grounds for judgment.
“Well, then, we’re gonna have to see a lot more of each other. Appointments twice a week for a month.”
“It’s not my sweet tooth, it’s my sub,” Castiel corrects, and then realizes his mistake when Gabriel kicks him from under the table.
Dean gave him a wolfish grin. "I said, why don't you get me those supplies and I can start a sketch of you."
Dean beams, as if taking care of Castiel brings him immeasurable joy, and the alpha shifts in his seat. He feels nearly feverish just at the sight of Dean, and he averts his eyes and stares down at his sandwich, picking it up and taking a large bite. The burst of flavor is better than usual, and he moans a little as he swallows, Dean sitting at his own desk and chuckling quietly.
“The first day we worked on rope work, mostly. I did a few different ties with him and we worked on him learning his body, and when a rope was too snug how to signal his Dom.” Gordon’s voice is a bit muffled by his stuffy nose. He thinks of how hard he tried to be good that afternoon, even though something about Gordon had him on edge.
The cold air wakes him up and he knows the drinks were pretty weak—he should be good to still drive. The whole ride home, as he presses the heel of his palm to his hard as stone cock, he thinks of storm-blue eyes and a deep, gravelly voice.
Castiel eyes the back seat a moment and gives it a long look before glancing up at Dean, a failed attempt at an innocent smile on his face. Dean swallows hard, imagining all the fun they could get into in that back seat.
, and he begins to slide toward the floor when his Master catches him to keep him in place. “Easy there. Weʼre done with pet play, Dean. You aren’t Princess anymore. You did such a wonderful job. I am so proud of you.”
“Holy crap,” Gabriel moans after the first bite, somewhat absurdly in Castiel’s opinion, “this is actually
“You can use some of that hot air to blow up these floats?” Missouri suggests with a smirk, her tone light and full of sarcasm. Charlie laughs at their banter and walks by, mentioning that she’s heading into the laundry room to gather up a stack of pool towels.
He throws his head back over Castiel’s shoulder and writhes on top of him. The feel of Castiel all around him, the mouth kissing his neck and the hand on his chest and the legs bracketing him is all so intense and amazing he can’t help but pant and whine, canting his hips begging for more.
“Yeah, I’ve been working a lot, too. We moved to Kansas City, actually. I meant to look you up, but things have been so busy,” Dean says apologetically.
“Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, oh Dean,” Castiel chants in his ear and its a like a benediction, like being enough, being what this beautiful man needs. He falls into darkness then, letting sleep take him.
Dean freezes in place a moment, feet slowing to a stop as the words sink in. Alistair thought Alfie was a good sub. He told Alfie he was good. He stopped when Alfie told him to. It doesn’t make any sense, though. It was only three days but he’s certain that not once did Alistair tell him he was good. He never stopped, never cared. Maybe the problem wasn’t Alistair…
“Are they mad at me?” he asks, as Castiel comes around to grab his own expensive-looking suitcase. The sight of it by his torn and patched duffel is a little too on the nose for his taste.
“Panties down just below your cheeks, and spread them nice and wide for me so we can see this needy hole or yours,” his master growls, and Dean leans his face on the bed and reaches back to comply. Spreading his cheeks with his fingers, there is a quick snap of a bottle cap and a lube-soaked finger rubs at his sensitive rim.
“Yes. A separation between our romantic relationship, and our relationship as dom and sub.” Castiel’s proud he can even think this clearly, honestly, with Dean being this naughty to him in public. He wants very much to go to the car and teach him a lesson, but this is a
“It’s 10:53 right now. If you can last three whole minutes—until 10:56—I’ll use my mouth instead of my hand.”
“Yeah, apparently you’re a genius,” Kevin says, grinning toothily, “though I’ll be the judge of that.”
can make him regret last night—and then they brush their teeth with filtered water and get dressed. Castiel keeps getting distracted by Dean’s lips, and they end up making out with Castiel’s shirt only half-on and Dean’s pants around his ankles. The kisses are fun and flirty, rather than heated and sensual, and they keep honest-to-god giggling every few minutes and muttering, “I can’t believe this finally happened.” Castiel feels like his heart is glowing so brightly, he’s surprised Dean isn’t blinded by it.
“Come on, let’s dry off and then I can hold you in an actual bed.” He smiled, thinking of those nights on the beach or in the back of his car. All he’d wanted then was one night in a nice soft bed with Castiel in his arms.
“Shhh, sweet boy, you- you’ve been sooo good,” Castiel huffs above him, short of breath as his thrusts speed up. “You can come for me, Dean,” Castiel grunts out, hand reaching forward to tease at Dean’s weeping cock. He feels it coming, like a tidal wave bursting past the constriction of the ring he comes. The vibration on his cock ring mercifully stops. Warm hot pulses rock through him, he lets out a cry muffled by the cock trusting erratically in his mouth.
He hesitates only a second before hitting send and curling up under the covers. Getting his own ass pounded might be just the trick for his mood. He falls asleep, waking up hours later feeling like ass warmed over and in desperate need of a shower.
"No worries, and you can call me Cas outside of class, okay?" He handed the note to Sam who tucked it into his workbook with a smile.
“Oh, a very long time. I worked for his father, Chuck, before he moved away. I stayed on when Castiel came to live here full-time.”
Castiel looks at the flowers blooming, the rays reflecting off the tiered fountain they’re passing, the pollen already floating in the air. He thinks for a moment about how spring reflects what it’s like to be in Dean’s presence—pure, unequivocal sunshine.
Dean purses his lips like he wants to say something, but he doesn’t—just fluffs the pillow and leans in closer.
P.S. This chapter is dedicated to all our readers impacted by COVID-19—whether you're sick, your loved ones are sick, your employment situation or living situation is challenging, or you're just stuck at home full of anxiety. We see you, we're here for you, and we hope these lovesick boys will help give you a moment of reprieve. <3
“Where the hell were you?” Castiel demands, glaring at the bodyguard and feeling another wave of wrath wash through his body. “It was your job to keep them safe!”
“What you said, about submission… I, well I want you to know that I respect you.” Dean reaches for his beer, taking a large gulp. “I’ve been thinking about it, and—we’ve been through a lot, and I’m not always gonna agree with every decision you make. I’m not even pissed about what happened anymore. I’m just, I dunno, frustrated at the whole damn system. But I do trust you to do what you think is right, Cas.” Dean looks nervous as he adds, “You’re a good person and a good Dom.”
Dean lets himself be pulled into a hug and feels the hard thump to his back that makes him smile. “Heya Bobby, I see you haven't changed.”
“Tell me what you’re not telling me,” Castiel says coolly, following a hunch to see if he’s right. “Master doesn’t like when you keep secrets.” He leans down, his lips brushing the other man’s ear, as he whispers, “If you want to be my good boy, you’ll tell me.”
“Seatbelt,” Castiel reminds him as they slide into the seats. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever sat in a car this expensive before.
The sub stands next to him immediately, Castiel’s heart beating out his chest. His pet keeps his eyes fixated on the floor, a true sign of submission, and it makes Castiel ache to come all over his sub’s stunning face. But this is about his pet being rewarded and achieving true subspace. Even so, Cas is still human, and he can’t help but run his hands on the outside of the panties, a shiver running through his sub. “These are beautiful. You’re a beautiful little slut, aren’t you?”
“It’s this guy who started coming a few months back.” Gabriel cranes his neck, as if the man will appear in front of him. “He’s got model-good looks and a bunch of doms buzzing around him like flies, but he hasn’t sampled the merchandise yet,
“That's a panic button. All the restraint furniture in this room has them. You can always hit that button if you ever feel unsafe, and the dungeon master will come in and help you. Do you understand?”
“I’m going to tell you everything that is going to happen tonight before we begin, and you can tell me if you consent. Do you understand?” Dean nods his head in response, and feels a harsh pinch to his side that makes him jump and yelp. “Words, sweet boy.”
promise,” Sam’s answers, and it's true. Dean never thought he could fulfill that promise, but maybe he can.
“So good, Cas, feels so good,” Dean slurs, face planted into the mattress. “Never…never knew it would feel so good with you…” Dean’s scent has changed completely now, a combination of Castiel’s earthy tones and Dean’s sweet spices, and it’s intoxicating in every possible way. His knot catches with a particularly aggressive thrust and then the mattress is suddenly falling, the bedframe around them splintering in half as Castiel empties himself inside Dean.
Castiel tilts his head, considering. “You know, for years it was the time Gabriel stole my swim trunks at the eighth grade pool party, when they fell off after a dive—”
“Yeah sure, no problemo.” He hopes he isn’t completely bored stiff in the first hour on the job. Castiel nods, twisting to crack his back a little. Dean can still see the tension in his body and the heat in his cheeks. Dean wonders if his headache is bad again and if he should offer to use the pressure point. He just wants to be a good employee and help his boss have a good day, right? That’s a totally normal impulse and has nothing to do with getting his hands on Castiel again. Plus, Dean is just a natural caregiver…and no, it has nothing to do with being an omega, despite what his dad says.
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head. Unable to resist any longer, he takes a chance and leans in. His mouth brushes Dean’s ear, and he says in deep rumble, “I don’t have to tell you how breathtaking you look tonight, or how difficult it is to have you in my arms and not kiss you. But just know, omega, I’m counting down the minutes until we’re alone again. I can’t wait to show you just how beautiful I find you…every naked inch of you.”
He covers the receiver with his hand taking a steadying breath that is all the harder with the banging and death threats coming through the door. “This isn’t up for debate Sam, Amy is not safe like this and neither are we.” He brings the phone back up and hears the dispatcher say she is sending a unit. “Look, Amy Pond is here, she’s the daughter of the woman banging down my door. I’m concerned for her safety.”
Dean nods, feeling oddly quiet as he sinks deeper into his submissive space. He pads over to his familiar table now lying down on the mat with his knees bent and hands behind his head. Eyes closed, he drifts to the sounds of dishes clinking and water running.
“Not officially, just helped Bobby some,” Dean says humbly, as Castiel begins to pull out of the parking spot. “You might have a bad starter or a worn-out ignition switch.” He frowns at the pop station Cas had it turned to, adjusting it to classic rock with a smirk.
Castiel arches off the bed a bit as Dean begins to suck and bob his head in earnest. He can taste something different on his cock and realizes that it's his own sweet slick. Not for nothing, but it's not half bad. He moans around the cock, trying to keep his eyes on Castiel’s face, mouth hanging open around a soundless “O” as he struggles not to buck up into his mouth.
“Dean this is serious…you were hurt yesterday, and then accosted by an out-of-control alpha,” Cas crosses his arms, frowning at the carpet.
he’s requested this meeting. It’s not wise to tell Dean the particulars though, not unless he comes back with good news.
, is deep in subspace. He hasn’t tried to speak for days, and wakes up curled at the foot of Castiel’s bed, whining and ruffling the covers to wake him up.
“Kneel down for me, tiger.” Cain gives him a wicked, promising grin and Dean attempts to stop shivering as he falls gracefully to his knees—wondering if Castiel would be proud of how well he did that. Hands come forward and latch the collar around his throat, and Dean feels like the sound of the buckle is the final step to sealing his fate and saying goodbye to his dream.
“Oh, my sweet boy…my hungry boy…” Castiel sighs, unable to keep the image of Dean on his knees, sucking cock, from entering his imagination. He slides his pointer and middle finger between Dean’s parted lips, and the sub sucks them eagerly, moaning around the intrusion and writhing around on Castiel’s lap.
“Good toy,” Castiel tells him, and then Dean hears the sound of keyboard keys clicking above him. He can do this though, he can be a good toy for his Master. Dean rests his face in Castiel's lap and thinks his Dom really wasn’t lying…he said Dean was going to be fully stuffed today. What better way to spend a Sunday?
He watches Dean descend down the hallway and then closes his door. Two minutes later, he’s managed to pull up a pair of sleep pants when his next visitor arrives—a smirking Missouri, with her eyebrows raised.
“Yeah, yeah, I heard you.” Dean reaches forward, searching for his phone. His skin is sleepy warm, his neck a little sweaty, and Castiel is tempted to just fall back asleep in each other’s arms. It’s starting to become too hot for that, though. The air conditioning must be off. “Weather alert. Looks like a storm threw out a bunch of power lines… Sam said half the city’s in a black-out.”
“You answer your Master when he asks you a question,” he reprimands tersely. “If I don’t want you to speak, I’ll tell you.”
Dean had more free time on his hands then he was used to, and with the nice weather he spent every minute he could outside. Castiel showed him how he gathered honey from his hives even though Dean wouldn’t go over. Way too many stingers for his taste. He did use the honey to make some baklava for them, though—a sticky sweet mess, but totally worth the effort. Dean could tell he was falling harder and harder for the alpha with every passing day.
Once he’s covered Dean’s ass in come, he does what’s guaranteed to get Dean off, too. He spears his tongue inside Dean’s come-soaked hole, then uses a finger to go deep, down to nearly two knuckles, before curving his finger against a bundle of nerves—
Dean’s eyes go wide but he instantly obeys, and watches as Castiel shifts down his sleep pants and pulls out his incredibly hard cock. He feels sorta desperate for it, to be able to give Castiel pleasure and make him feel good. It's suddenly all he wants as he rocks forward, mouth open and waiting.
“Come for me, sweetheart,” Castiel coos softly, and on-command Dean’s cock pulses out his release. He melts into Castiel’s arms, kissing him slow and messy and soft. He lets the sensation of safety and home wash over him, and he feels utter relief that he can still feel that way—even after everything.
He hears a crack of hardwood behind him, and Castiel leans up in his chair, the lamp light barely illuminating Dean as he stands in the doorway.
“Omega,” he whispers softly, and Dean can barely hear him before he’s closing the gap between them and shoving Dean up against the wall.
. But he doesn’t have an alpha—Castiel is not his alpha, and it’s not Dean’s job to take care of him…despite the feeling in his gut telling him otherwise.
Dean scoffs, crossing his arms against his chest. “What’d you think—that I’d come out of jail all chipper—maybe do a little song and dance? Everything sucks, don’t you see that? I get attacked, Sam is nearly raped, and I have to empty my savings account to pay a goddamn fine.”
we are.” He laughs again but his jaw is set tight, tense in his every movement. Out of nowhere, he grabs the empty plastic cup off his tray and slings it in Castiel’s direction. He’s so taken aback, that Dean launches a stack of napkins and an extra pillow at him before he’s caught on that Dean is tossing everything in reach.
“It’s just oatmeal. Did you sleep at all?” Castiel put a hand to his forehead and frowned at the fever he still felt there. The heat would go for at least another two days, but he was feeling stronger than the night before.
“I decided to get a bit creative. This is a leather cinch strap I just bought. Would you like to help me break it in a bit?” Castiel gives him a devilish smirk.
The implication hangs heavy, and Castiel shakes his head vehemently. “No, I haven’t had…those dreams in a long time.”
He stands in the road a second longer, and feels this strange draw to turn around and go talk to the man. He can’t seem to figure out why he just wants to be near him. He shakes off the feeling and puts his boots to the ground, heading for home. Tomorrow, he thinks, is going to a very long day.
His sub moans outrageously, his erection held snugly in the cock cage, and Castiel grins wickedly. Yes, this might’ve been an intense experiment for his pet, but he’ll make sure the outcome is more than worth it. It takes a moment to situate him properly on the table, leaned upright to begin. “Can you hold onto the straps yourself, or would you like to be tied in?”
Dean makes an incoherent grunt because he can’t get words out, throat closed completely. Castiel looks like a deer caught in headlights, staring at Dean and looking guilty as sin. Which is stupid—Dean knows it’s stupid. Castiel has every right to be out on a date and he’s not obligated to tell his employee about it. Still, it doesn’t stop the gut-wrenching pain he feels as Inias puts his hand lightly on Castiel’s elbow, gently cupping it. It makes Dean’s skin crawl seeing someone touching Castiel—even such an innocent gesture.
"Duh, dummy, I am logging into a video chat with Naomi. She wants to talk to you and she wanted to be sure the line was secure so here I am," she said, twirling her hand with a flourish.
“That was worth the wait,” Dean whispers with a dreamy sigh, tucking his head into Castiel’s neck. “That was fucking amazing.”
He sucks in a quiet breath, caught in Dean’s gaze. The sleek suit and slender black tie look amazing on Dean, his hair tousled with gel, his face closely shaved. Cas hasn’t seen his omega for several hours now—separated by the crowd and Dean’s general sense of busyness—and having him so close now makes Castiel itch to reach out. To touch.
“Very good things.” Castiel let’s his eyes linger on Dean’s body, and though all he can see apart from the sleeping bag is Dean’s bare chest, it’s the most intimate look he’s allowed himself yet. When his eyes float up to Dean’s face, he sees sharp green eyes staring back at him and Dean’s mouth hanging open.
“What? No, you know that was awesome—I came in like two seconds. And the pregnancy hormones have me horny as hell.” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. “Listen, that was a bad example. All I’m sayin’ is you gotta let me live my life. It’s exhausting, having you spazz out everytime I try to lift more than a freaking paperclip!”
A moment later, Dean is only halfway dressed when there’s a tentative knock on the door. Castiel calls out, “One minute!” Dean’s bottom-half is dressed, but his t-shirt is pretty soiled now, so Castiel tosses him the first t-shirt he can find.
“I understand.” Castiel’s voice is warm and genuine, hands scrubbing at his scalp. “You were coping with a trauma, Dean. I’m just glad to be here now.” Castiel’s hand pauses in his hair, and Dean can tell he’s debating something. “You don’t have to tell me, Dean, not now, not ever if you don’t want to...but was the bite all that happened? Did he…did they…?”
Okay guys, this is it, all she wrote, the end. (I'm not crying your crying). Its been so great sharing this story with you, I feel like I learned a lot writing this and I feel like a better author after finishing it. I could not have done it with out my friends, Ellen of Oz helping edit every word a long the way (mostly fixing my present tense to past tense and adding lots of comma's lol). WaywardAF67 and waywardjenn and TrenchcoatBaby for reading and encouraging me along the way. (I highly recommend looking up TrenchcoatBaby and her State of You fic, its so so hot and all the eye fucking you can handle).
“I hope you don’t mind if I finish my meal…” He begins to trail slices of fresh fruit over the man’s skin, on his shin and hips and collarbones. His sub just breathes through the sensation, following the directive to stay motionless, and Castiel trades out the strawberries for the mangoes. He scatters chunks on his abdomen, his arms, his lower thighs. “I could’ve finished it earlier, but it seems you’re too distracting. The only logical solution is to make

We know we're entering some difficult territory here, so we want you guys to be fully prepared for what's ahead. As such, please check the content warnings at the chapter's end (if needed).
“Then why are you so against being with an omega?” Dean asks, the question coming out strong and clear, as if he’s wondered this for a long time and is relieved to finally ask. “You’re not a sexist douchebag, Cas, not like so many alphas I know. But you’re still keeping me at arm’s length because of some stupid rule—”
The scent of lavender hits his nose as hands press into his back, Castiel’s thumbs running up along his spine. Dean lets out a long, low moan of pleasure.
Dean how he hoped training is going…there’s a distinction there that makes Castiel uncomfortable. Now that Dean knows he’s a dom, and knows that fact very well, Cas doesn’t want to come off as an overbearing, domineering dictator. Not after he’s spent six months calling Dean a little bitch, a slutty whore, a needy pet, and a whole range of other humiliating names that wouldn’t seem normal to anyone but them.
“Then I’m not going anywhere. Never going to leave my good boy.” Castiel cups his face and pulls him for a warm kiss. Dean knows then that everything is going to be alright.
Still he had trouble doing what Castiel wanted sometimes, like sitting on the furniture. It made him uneasy and he couldn’t stop the panic attacks, waiting for the a blow that never came. Eventually Cas stopped asking him to sit at the table or on the couch, but would put a pillow down for him and that made him feel a bit better.
“Course you didn’t,” Dean mutters against his skin, in a tone that implies Castiel would never try to entice Dean back to him by manipulating him through their scent bond. Which is true, of course.
Dean practically falls to his knees at the deep, lust-filled command. He bends over, pressing his forehead to the ground, and sticks his ass in the air. He reaches back with both hands and spreads his cheeks as wide as he can, fingers digging into his own skin. The footsteps echo in the room as Master moves behind him. The toe of his boot presses into his thigh, lifting his ass a little higher. Holy fuck…if that isn’t so hot. He feels his dick fill out with the press of leather and rubber to his skin. The boot slides up the inside of his thighs and just barely taps at his balls, making him flinch. Fuck, this guy might be the actual death of him.
“It won’t be any trouble. I can clear out this whole side for you. Maybe we can go shopping and get you some new flannels, with winter coming soon,” Cas continues talking to him from the closet, but Dean isn’t listening.
The rest of the night comes back to him slowly, in pieces. Pacing his room, unable to settle, eventually going down the hall to Castiel’s room, the smack to his cheek and the mind-blowing orgasm. Oh god…he thinks his whole family may have heard him. He wonders if he begged?
Hannah scoffs, her expression outrageously shocked. “If you’re fishing for compliments, then fine,” she muses. “Castiel, you are incredibly attractive. If Dean has even one gay bone in his body, he’d be into you in a second.”
“Don’t call the police, Missouri. I mean it,” he says in a deadly command. Then he reaches for the handle of his briefcase with a quick snatch, walking briskly down the hallway and toward the garage. Missouri is on his heels still, calling his name and begging him to slow down. But all he feels is fury rolling through him, a surreal sort of anger that makes his conscience feel disconnected from his body.
With a hand on his shoulder, Cas guides him to the mirror by the front door. Dean can practically feel the heat of the alpha’s body as it presses up behind him. So close…but not touching. He can’t help but wonder what would happen if he just arched his back a little. Castiel’s arms reach around him, and he smiles warmly at Dean over his shoulder as he undoes the mess Dean started.
“Yeah, yeah, never said I was a gymnast,” Dean gripes, falling back into Castiel’s arms. “Okay, same question.”
When the elevator doors open, he’s practically giddy, feeling more animated and hopeful than he has in weeks. He turns the corner, but the closer he gets to the door, the more he realizes a small, blonde woman is standing with her back to him. She turns around abruptly, and with a confused frown, he says, “Becky?” It takes him a moment to realize why her appearance at his door is such a surprise. “Aren’t you out of town with my father?”
Castiel gives a soft chuckle. “Answer me, sub.” It's not a harsh admonishment, but a warning nonetheless.
Sam is quiet on the whole drive over, which is fine by him since he can’t seem to stop thinking about his dom. What would he look like standing in the kitchen, cooking breakfast with a spatula in hand? But a spatula in his dom’s hand only makes him think of how good it would feel making his ass red, and he flushes at the image of being bent over the kitchen table, a firm hand to the back of his neck.
He hopes his voice isn’t shaking already, but good god, it’s difficult to sustain a clear head when all his fantasies are coming true. He stares at his stunning pet as he walks over, the tight and muscular abs and arms, the trim waist, the metal of the cock cage thick and noticeable through the thin material of his panties. The man’s face seems neutral but excited and as he kneels at Castiel’s feet, but he winces, adjusting himself. Castiel makes him wait nearly five full minutes, as he tosses through his papers and looks busy, and he can feel his sub getting needier and more impatient by the second.
“Nope, the Jolly Green Giant can sit his ass back on the couch, I got this,” Dean grumbles, giving Cas’ wrist a squeeze before heading into the kitchen. Sam invites Castiel to sit down on the opposing loveseat, and he perches on the edge, hands clasped over his knees.
Castiel nods approvingly, his grip transforming into something more gentle and loving. “Are you familiar with the stoplight system, Dean?”
The door to the room swings open and Castiel storms in, taking in the scene. If Dean’s legs weren’t frozen in place, he thinks he might run to the man. Castiel swings a briefcase into Alfie’s arms before dismissing him and striding into the center of the room, eyes only for Dean.
He knows it’s early and he should go back to sleep, but he slips into a pair of sleep pants and tiptoes out of the suite without waking Sam. The house is dark and quiet as he makes his way to the west wing. Climbing the stairs, he begins to smell the familiar scent of his alpha, which makes him feel immediately calmer. He creaks open the bedroom door, with only a soft light starting to show through the curtains. He looks to see Castiel sleeping on his back, stretched out across the bed. He’s in nothing but his boxers with blankets tangled around his legs.
When Dean is finished, Castiel wipes a drop of come from the bottom of Dean’s lip, the sub instinctively sucking his thumb into the corner of his mouth. “You are wonderful, Dean. I think you’ll do quite well here.”
“Spread your legs for me, sweetheart.” Castiel moves up on the bed a bit, kneeling between Dean’s legs. He pushes on Dean’s knees until they’re bent, his back arched and his feet planted flat on the bed. He wants to reach his hands down to cover himself, and he flushes a little bit at being so exposed. “Look at you, all helpless and laid out for me.”
Dean wishes that the flirting could have been real…but in the end, this right here, this friendship is nothing he wants to risk.
Dean’s stomach drops just at the mention of the man. He can smell the bitter oily scent, can feel the sharp teeth sink into his skin, can perceive the burn on his wrists as he struggles. He tries to suck in air, but he can’t, it’s like his whole throat has closed up and he can hear Dick laughing in triumph. His mind whirs, and he can hear the faint sound of someone calling his name.
He reaches the kitchen and swings the double doors open, spotting Ellen over the sink, her apron wet with dishwater.
Dean chuckles gently, in obvious agreement, before Castiel’s mouth overtakes his. It’s a slow kiss, sweet and reassuring, and Cas only separates to stretch over to open the drawer of his end table. He comes back with lube but leaves the condoms there, thankful that they both were tested thoroughly—regularly for club membership, and then again, just weeks ago—and slicks his fingers up. Dean watches the whole process with drifting, lust-filled eyes.
“Please…” The voice is small and pleading, and Castiel just hums with dim acknowledgment, walking over the counter and wiping his cock off with tissues. He tucks himself back inside, zips the fly of his jeans, and bends over to wipe the come off his boots when he hears his sub shout, “No!”
“It was, but I’ve changed my mind. Now ‘this situation’ is an element of my counter offer,” Castiel says smoothly. “Try and keep up, Dick. Or shall I call in your receptionist to take minutes for you?”
They only have twenty-five minutes left according to Castiel’s watch, so he decides to combine their puppy play with aftercare, merging them slightly and cleaning them both off before instructing his pet to come lay with him. He sits up on the bed comfortably and instructs the man to curl up beside him, his head tucked in Castiel’s lap, breathing heavily and nudging the dom needily by rubbing his face against his thigh. Castiel touches him all over, his head and neck and shoulders and back, fingertips light and soothing as his sub relaxes beneath him. Finally, when he thinks it’s very possible the man might have drifted off to sleep, he whispers, “Is my good boy ready to talk again?”
“No, stop!” Dean cries suddenly, rising to his knees and nearly knocking Cas off-balance. Castiel blinks, his vision blurry, not understanding why Dean is reacting this way.
He cuts the engine and peers up at the house, the broken shutters, the peeling paint, the moss-covered roof. He wonders what on earth possessed him to bring Cas here. “If you wanna just wait here, I won’t be long,” Dean adds, feeling reluctant to get out of the car.
“I am. Consider it a perk of the job,” Castiel says casually, and sees Dean smile and shyly drop the blanket, facing the wall again. Without the distraction of an ongoing scene, Castiel can finally appreciate all the smooth curves and freckled skin of the man standing in front of him. The slopes of Dean’s shoulder blades are muscular and carved, his calves tight and athletic, his ass perfectly perky. Castiel finds himself distracted as he works, reading emails but then losing his train of thought as he tries to reply. It’s barely been two hours, but he’s tempted to fuck Dean all over again.
I am only a day late its a miracle thank chuck! Life has been INSANE, but I got this chapter done and I am pretty happy with it. Its all Dean POV and normally I like to have a mix of the two but this just worked better from his perspective. I hope you like it.
“Gorgeous,” he whispers, running gentle fingers all over the man’s body, from ankle to collarbones, touching him everywhere. Before the come begins to cool, he wipes it from his face, then gathers a larger amount from his sub’s abdomen and covers his cock with it.
“Yeah, umm…” Dean scratches the back of his neck, a nervous tick Castiel noticed during their first meeting. Dean’s cheeks flame scarlet, shifting uncomfortably in the leather chair, and Castiel’s interest is officially piqued. “No judgment?”
“And leave Purgatory?” Castiel says skeptically. “You heard my father today. Business isn’t slowing down—if anything, it’s growing. He’ll need me if he plans to expand the facility.”
“Stupid, stupid, stupid.” He smacks his hand against his head, about ready to hide under the desk and never come out. He just needs to get through this night and then he can snatch a bottle of fancy-ass whiskey off a bar cart and lock himself in his room till he’s good and drunk. He grabs the envelope from the desk and tucks it in his jacket, taking a few more slow breaths before he heads to the kitchen to find the caterer.
And then there’s Dean. Brave, lively, kind-hearted, strong. He’s one of the most fascinating individuals Castiel has ever met, and that’s to say nothing of sparkling green eyes, dusting of freckles, the sound of his laugh…
They chat about what they’ve been up to the past few years. Dean tells him about his accelerated courses he took to become a physical therapist in Lawrence while Sam finished high school. He tells him how he moved to California to follow Sam when he got into Stanford, realizing that saying it out loud makes him sound like he doesn’t have a life outside his brother. That isn’t true—Sam is just the only family he has, and he wanted a change of pace from Lawrence. Cas tells him how he spent time in Chicago for his undergrad before transferring out to California later.
“You’re the best, Pam.” He grins, just thinking about getting to have another scene with that voice and those eyes.
Garth quickly sends him a text with where to meet him. Garth heads out and Dean waits on the last floor for thirty minutes with no sign of Cas. He takes a chance, brewing him his usual order and slinks through the cubicles toward where he thinks Castiel’s office might be. He walks with confidence as if he has any idea where the hell he is going and stops short when he catches a pacing figure in one of the side offices.
"I appreciate that. Have a good night, Cas." Dean gave him a small smile, heading for his steps. His instincts told him to trust the guy, but his instincts had been wrong before. Actions speak louder than words. He figured he'd give it time to see who this guy really was before he decided friend or foe.
“He didn’t tell you? Well why would he bother telling the coffee boy?” Zachariah laughs and Dean is about ready to punch him in the nose.
Dean lets out a breathy intake of air, one that has Castiel shifting around in his seat. If Dean keeps making sounds like
is a hard question to answer. He wants to say he hates most of it, though he knows his body doesn’t hate all of it. He worries if he tells Castiel about things he doesn’t like, he may try to force him to like it.
The man smirks at him. “He’s in a bit of trouble, son, but maybe his prayers have been answered.” The man’s eyes rake over him and it makes his stomach drop. He’s looking at him like a piece of meat, but he shouldn’t be able to tell what he is. Not unless someone told him...not unless his dad told him. A cold chill runs down his spine, and everything in him is itching to break this guy’s nose and run.
“Master…” Dean moans, wiggling his ass needily. Castiel smirks but ignores him for now, putting his sub’s legs into the new piece of equipment and attaching the carabiners to the metal circles near Dean’s arms. Once Cas has tested the bonds and everything is secure, he instructs Dean to relax, and his sub follows the demand immediately. Even with his muscles lax, Dean’s held snuggly with his knees up and together, his arms still held back, only his head able to be lifted.
Dean, he can make things alright again. He flings open the door, turns the corner, and runs right into Alfie, who seems bewildered to see Castiel out of the playroom.
“I had considered using the registry results. But getting a lawyer…” Castiel mutters, thinking aloud. “That’s not a bad idea as well.”
“She’s at some convention in Vegas this weekend, but she said she’d come next time.” Dean’s childhood best friend Charlie is a spitfire of a redhead who was orphaned young and had been quickly taken into their misfit family. Charlie was actually the only one he’d even told about his extracurricular activities, knowing she’d never judge him for it. He hasn’t told her about his new dom though, and he thinks maybe he needs a night out to talk things through with her. She’s usually pretty good at helping to tell him when he’s in over his head.
“I’ll sue them. No…I’ll bury them! I can’t believe they let something happen to you, Dean. I’m so sorry I couldn’t do more, that I couldn’t protect you from this. I tried calling you every few hours, but they would never let me talk to you directly anymore. Did you try calling me? Would they not put my messages through? It was torture, sweetheart, thinking you were locked away, alone and hurting, and I couldn’t do anything—”
There’s a pang of regret in Castiel’s heart then, thinking about all the other Doms who will get to work with this gorgeous man. But he’s not a trainer anymore, not officially, and he has his paperwork, his research… After today, he can’t get distracted.
He heads to his room to put on his uniform before he ends up running late. His pants alone weigh a ton, and he does his check to be sure he has his flashlight, knife, trauma shears, all with him before bolting out the door. He feels hot already in his clothes, and is kinda glad the sun is going down soon and things will be cooling off in a few hours. Jo is in the back of the truck checking stock when he gets there. His phone pings with an email and he ducks out her line of sight before checking it.
Castiel shakes his head. “No, I left right in the middle of the scene. Highly unprofessional, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that sub leaves a scathing review once Victor pulls her out of subspace, but… I couldn’t stand the thought of losing you.”
“Good, needy little pets only get what they want when they ask for it.” Dean blinks up at the face staring down at him and is overwhelmed but the look of desire, lust, and awe on Cas’ face. “Feel free to come up and get a better look, just remember, no one lays a finger on him.” Dean doesn’t think anyone would challenge a threat like that. He hears the shuffle of feet and sees the crowd move to form a circle around them. People whispering and laughing sharing drinks. Several with subs of their own at their sides. He feels even more small and exposed like this. He loses track of Cas for a moment and when he finds him again, he’s standing between Dean’s splayed open legs, a riding crop in-hand and devilish look on his angelic face.
“But we have to maintain some semblance of professionalism in business dealings, even in disagreements.”
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuuuuuck,” Dean chants, feeling his orgasm building in his balls. One of Castiel’s hands wraps around his cock, giving it a squeeze, and it has him coming undone, cock spurting out across the alpha’s chest. He groans long and low, body clenching around Cas, and he feels the alpha’s knot starting to form. Dean is so loose after the rush of endorphins from his orgasm, just one quick thrust and the knot pops into place. A low growling whine comes from Castiel as he feels the alpha filling him up, cock pulsing deep within him.
“Perks of being the boss!” Jo calls over her shoulder, stacking the empty plates and passing them off to Dean. So Castiel wanders back down to his office, passing Dean’s empty desk wistfully, though they’ve just parted at dinner. It’s unsettling how quickly the omega always leaves him wanting more. He fishes his cell phone from his pocket and stares at the text from Inias, stomach twisted in knots before finally replying:
health.” Castiel crosses his arms too, looking resolute. In response Dean actually turns his head, and to Castiel’s immense surprise, laughs fully. Instantly, any tension evaporates from Castiel’s insides once he sees the pearly-white smile of Dean Winchester looking down at him.
They both begin to speak at the same time, then stop, gaping at each other. Castiel smiles awkwardly and Dean lets out a low chuckle.
“Best behavior, Ellie, we’ll save the screwing for after dinner,” Castiel adds in such a deadpan it makes Dean’s jaw drop.
“Yeah, it was…kinda hard,” Dean admits, “picking the breed, I guess. At first I thought husky, because I’m pretty stubborn—”
“A few of my less reputable business partners…Roman, for one.” Castiel says the name like it physically pains him. “I’m bringing Jo with me for security, but I don’t want you anywhere near them.” Castiel glances at him worriedly.
“Shhh, handsome, it’s just me,” Castiel’s honey warm voice greets him and he immediately settles. “Let me see how my boy is doing.”
“Bet it’s even better when you make him scream.” The other man’s voice drops low and dangerous and it sends another shiver prickling over Dean’s skin, and oh god yes, make him scream, make him scream.
Dean surprises him by switching their positions and pinning Castiel to the bed. Dean has a hand on the front tie of Castiel’s robe, looking into Cas’ eyes for permission to loosen it. The alpha just lies back and nods, observing the reverence on Dean’s face as his chest becomes bare.
He touches the soft leather of his new collar and feels a bit weird putting it on himself. He carries it out to the kitchen and finds Castiel already sitting in his seat—a huge plate of food and Dean’s pillow by his side. Breakfast smells amazing, and Dean’s stomach rumbles. He’s quick to lower himself down and get settled.
“I think it got in my hair,” she whines. It really isn’t that much, it just sprayed a lot. They got the bleeding under control pretty quickly, but not before Jo’s shirt got covered.
“I was going to give all of this up because I was falling in love with my best friend. It tore me up inside—the thought of losing the most beautiful, responsive, giving, uninhibited sub I had ever met. You are a fantasy come to life, trusting me with all of yourself, it was...it
Sam nods and Castiel tosses him the keys from his pants pocket. “Drive us to the hospital. I’ll stay in the back with Dean.”
“So beautiful, you did so well sweet boy, just so well,” Castiel’s words are like a balm softening everything in the low lit room. “Are you ready to come undone for me?”
Castiel is nothing if not a hard worker. So he falls into a rhythm at Bobby’s house, a rotation of meds and food and baths and naps, every moment of his day devoted to what Dean needs. His good boy spends a lot of the day sleeping on the couch, the pain meds making him drowsy, and Castiel is pleased to be used as Dean’s pillow—his lap and shoulder, mostly—all while his hands gently rub Dean’s head and neck. For the first two days he sleeps fitfully, even in the haze of medication, waking up with a gasp and his body shaking, dreaming about a type of pain Castiel will never fully understand. It breaks his heart every time he sees Dean like this—his eyes foggy as he searches around for danger, heart pounding, Castiel’s name whispered like a plea. He’s been through something traumatic, and he’s thankful that Dr. Hanscum recommended a therapist for Dean to see.
“Hey, we aren’t starting on the kids yet, alright? So keep it in your pants.” Dean laughs as Castiel grips him tight in his arms. Despite what he said, just the press of their bodies has Dean tightening in his jeans.
It’s a dreary, gray Thursday evening when his office door is thrown open. He glances up from the stack of papers on his desk, completely caught off-guard by the sudden appearance of Pam.
“So what if I am? Hop to it, stable boy,” Castiel chuckles and swats at Dean’s butt as he jumps away.
"I'm- I'm g-gonna, Dean..." Dean moved one hand to give a tiny tug on Castiel's balls through his pants and pressed a finger by his perineum and sent him over the edge, coming hard down Dean's throat. He'd almost forgot how much an Alpha could come and he worked hard to swallow it all down, enjoying the sweet taste of it and letting his eyes flicker closed.
He’s speaking openly, honestly, though that’s nothing new. He always misses his beautiful sub—but the past few days, after being so embarrassingly drunk and hitting on his best friend, Castiel has felt a total loss of control. He doesn’t know what’s slowly developing between him and Medic67, but it feels like he’s on the verge of developing feelings that are more than platonic…which is so entirely inconvenient, he doesn’t even know where to begin. As much as he truly cares for ‘67 and values his friendship, he can’t imagine ever giving up his sub, not now. Not ever. But reading back through his drunk texts, he can’t deny that ‘67 had seemed turned on by the thought of Castiel fucking a man publicly against a bar. Not to mention that he said Castiel’s boots were sexy, which was a surprising but welcome compliment. What could these things mean? Could he actually have sexual chemistry with a nameless, faceless friend?
The gorgeous man moans softly as he lowers himself to the floor, on hands and knees with his back arched, and it reminds Castiel of the very suggestive cat-cow pose he sometimes practices in yoga. He wants to run a hand through the perfect dip on the man’s lower back, brushing every tight and active muscle…but there are better ways to reward a bitch.
“You look lovely.” Castiel’s voice grabs his attention, and he blinks up to see his Dom watching him from the doorway.
They pull up to Kimball Farm and Dean’s eyes widen with shock. He hasn’t been out here in ages and had forgotten all about it. Last time he was here, it was just a small ice-cream stand with mini golf. Now there’s a driving range, batting cages, bumper boats, food stands, candy store, and a pitch and putt.
“Come on, you look like you could use some breakfast…though maybe I should have got you decaf.” He smiles at the alpha and heads into the office, putting down the drinks and food.
He sends another hurtling slap down to Dean’s bare bottom, and the sub arches his back up, chasing some sort of pleasure he hadn’t been before.
“Look…” Dean scowls a bit, crossing his arms and trying not to watch to see Cas come in. “Cas and I have a strictly professional relationship.”
“Come on, let's go see what's for dinner.” Dean puts on his best smile, and it must be good enough because Cas returns it before following him out toward the kitchen.
win back Dean’s trust. There’s no other option now, because life without him is too unbearable to stand.
“Gentleman?” a woman’s voice repeats, and Lilth comes from the corner of the room. She’s in a floor-length, slinky white gown, her lips pursed in a smirk. “Do you hear that, Abby? Our host is being horribly sexist.”
Dean’s own heart aches as he slowly approaches the table to see the smiling blonde looking back up at him. Jess had been so beautiful, so striking, she had kinda reminded Dean of his mom a little. “Why’d you go?” Sam’s hiccuping voice breaks the silence, a long finger trailing over one of the polaroids. “I’m so sorry,” Sam says barely above a whisper and Dean manages to lunge and catch Sam right before he face plants on the table.
Dean returns the grin and enters his office, walking steadily over to Castiel’s desk. He swings a leg over Castiel’s lap, hands entwined behind the alpha’s neck, straddling him.
A moment passes between them when they’re both still staring, but not speaking. Dean has eyes that he could fall right into, so vivid and mesmerizing.
CB here with another chapter for you guys. This weeks conversation between TCBaby and myself went something like this.
He can see Castiel now riding in the arena, his boyfriend seated atop the large bay appendix quarter horse, Maco. He blinks a few times till he realizes Castiel is riding in an English saddle and he’s wearing tight tan pants and tall black boots. Even from a distance he can see the outline of his thigh muscles and it makes his mouth water.
“Oh, honey,” Ellen wraps an arm around his waist, “you could never disappoint me. I just want to see you find someone who will make you happy, is all.”
TCB: I can't decide what makes me more excited sometimes. Our story, our friendship, or our readers. ❤
Castiel feels a flicker of endearment spark inside him, a connection tethering him to this wild man—this sub who came to their facility on the precipice of death, and already seems to be on the mend after one orgasm. But he suppresses the feeling, pushing it down where he can process it later. He stands up briskly, all business again, and looks down at Dean.
“You look so beautiful.” He runs a hand over the front of Dean’s panties, tracing the outline of his cock cage with one finger. “Such a perfect sub.”
He heads back toward the arena where Castiel is lunging Cash. He leans against the top rail, watching as Cash bucks and tugs on the line. Castiel stands his ground, waiting out the tantrum Cash is throwing. Dean can’t help but smile, watching Cash pin his ears and kick up dust. Castiel gives an annoyed eye roll but even he is smiling too. The horse breaks to a trot, finally floating over the arena footing with his tail up like a flag.
He smelled even stronger in there and it was dark, since the power was out. That’s when he heard it, a small tiny whimpering sound that if he hadn’t had Alpha strong hearing would not have registered over the howling wind. He took the stairs two at a time, desperate to get to Dean. He
The fingers teasing and playing with his chest are making him mad with want. “Come, I need to come, please.” He just manages to get the words out.
“What the hell happened here?” Ellen demands, then looks over at her daughter. “Joanna Beth! Are you hurt?”
when Castiel pulls his fingers out, his heart racing wildly. He squirts a generous portion of lube onto his hand, then lathers up his cock, nudging his cockhead at the entrance of Dean’s hole. The only sounds in the room are breathy moans, but as Castiel pushes inside, bottoming out, they both cry out from the intensity of it.
Jo proceeds to smack him in the arm, making him jump. “Don’t be a goddamn coward, Dean. Tell the guy to his face that you’re done. I'm sure he will understand your reasons, and if he doesn’t, that’s not on you…that’s on him, okay? You can’t let anyone get in the way of being with the right person.”
“How can I do that when you’re fucking hitting me?” Dean snaps, then adds, with a burst of anger, “You know what,
Dean nods, thinking it does. “But I don’t wanna do that all the time, you know?” He can’t deny he had enjoyed himself, now that he’s a bit more clear-headed.
“It’s fine,” Castiel cuts him off stepping back a moment. “I came to tell you that one of my brothers and some of his associates are planning to stop by today to discuss a few business items. I will need you to reschedule my afternoon meetings to later in the week, and then you may be excused the rest of the day.”
“This won’t be a…fun conversation,” Castiel warns, and Dean frowns a little but nods in understanding. “Can I tell you about Jimmy?”
“I think…sir…” Dean’s breathing is uneven now. His head drops to Castiel’s shoulder, as if he’s so turned on, he can’t hold himself up. “Fuck, Cas, sir, I want you to do that to me. I want you to do
Dabbing on an extra dose of blocker spray to cover his scent, he takes a final deep breath before tucking a knife in his boot and heading in. It’s a cool spring night, the warm air of the day long gone. He hurries in the front revolving door, feeling his nerves tingle as he tries to assess his surroundings. The lobby seems relatively empty except for a brunette sitting behind the reception desk. He slowly approaches her as dark, round eyes lift to meet his.
Castiel’s body goes stock still as his blue eyes widen a moment and Dean fears he guessed wrong. He begins to try and pull away but his doms grip is too strong.
“I missed you so much.” Castiel kisses his neck, slips his hands around Dean’s waist until he finds that perfect ass and grabs roughly. Dean lets out a needy whine that goes straight to Castiel’s cock, and he nearly growls.
He starts clicking through the list, calling the laundry service to find where the Tuesday dry cleaning delivery went. He reschedules two conflicting conference calls, replies to a few meeting requests and emails, and he can already feel his eyes start to burn. He’s thrilled when Missouri messages him that Mr. Adler has arrived, asking if he can come escort him to Castiel’s office.
“I am going to bring you to the brink of orgasm, Dean, and when you are at the very end of your limit I want you to tell me before you come. We are going to do this ten times, and if you can make it that many, without coming or tapping out, you will get a reward.” Castiel gives him a mischievous grin as he strides up to Dean, hand sliding between his legs and slick finger circling his hole.
“Dean there’s no reason we can’t both have what we want. If we work together I know we can make it happen. If I just—”
“Well, trash is done. And I gotta say, even in a swanky ass place like this, it’s nice to see that a dumpster is still a dumpster. That thing stunk to high—” He halts in his tracks when spots Castiel, door latching behind him as he swallows, eyes wide, “—heaven.”
He nods, glancing back at his dad who’s just standing still as stone with his arms crossed. Roman clears his throat and Dean’s snaps his eyes back to the man. “Good boy. So, I’ll be frank with you Dean, your father here has gotten himself into quite a lot of debt with me. I’m afraid he’s going to have to forfeit over his house and auto shop to me by the end of the week.”
“Would you consider yourself currently aroused?” He hopes drawing out this “clinical” line of questioning might help him regain some of his control. Plus, he
. A wall of impact implements, a table with brand new, in-the-packaging insertables, gags, and leather bondage gear. Then there’s the furniture: a Saint Andrew's cross in one corner, a spanking bench, stocks, a small cage, and a big, beautiful bed.
“The light makes this my favorite room, too.” He looks around the spare room. It's a mishmash of furniture, a treadmill, weight machine, an old padded medical table, and boxes of weights and elastic bands stacked in the corner by an exercise ball and yoga mats. The other side, however, has a loveseat and bookshelf right by the window. It’s one of his favorite spots to unwind after work.
A shy smile breaks across his face and its so contradictory to the Dom persona from before. “Tonight was more about meeting your needs, Dean, and believe me I found the experience more than satisfactory.” Castiel nods toward his pants and pulls the blanket back to reveal what looks like a dried wet spot.
He returns to his chair afterwards, his steps measured, and flips open his leather portfolio. It was a birthday gift from a relative, and he’s pretty sure he’s never used it before, but he’s ready to pull out all the stops for his new sub. He’s scribbling away on a legal pad, flipping through a collection of old W-2s in a way that makes him look preoccupied, when he hears the door crack open. His body begins to thrum with adrenaline.
Castiel spins around to see Rowena standing there, smiling up at them. “Rowena? What are you doing here?”
Dean looks a little awestruck at the open invitation to visit the buffet, and he nods, smiling a little as Castiel dismisses him. He watches from the table, grinning to himself as Dean hoards plate after plate onto his tray. He comes back with all manner of junk food—pizza, fries, and apple pie.
In this chapter Dean enters into a scene with Alistair, they have strictly defined limits and safe-words for impact play scene, with nothing sexual. Alistair ends up ignoring his safe-words and using a whip on Dean. He is hurt but will heal. It is split between two scenes in this chapter. If you need to skip in order to take care of yourselves all you need to know to continue the story is that Gabriel and Castiel step in to help Dean, Castiel confesses his love for Dean and gives him a chance to decide how he feels and see if he wants to move forward together or not. All love my friends <3
He looks up to see Castiel step out onto the patio. Sunglasses are settled on his nose, but his eyes are obviously scanning for Dean. He can tell when the alpha freezes that he’s spotted Dean, a sad kind of smile on his face. Wanting to take that sullen look off Castiel’s face, Dean stretches his arms up above his head, feeling his swim trunks fall a little down his hips. He watches in satisfaction as Castiel’s Adam's apple bobs up and down.
“Still such a brat,” Castiel chuckles quietly, and begins to thrust headily, taking a few moments to figure out the best rhythm. Then he’s going at it earnestly, pounding into Dean as his boyfriend thrashes and cries out. Every inch of Castiel’s skin feels like it’s on fire, he’s practically vibrating with need, but he knows he isn’t hitting Dean’s prostate at this angle. It takes a moment of adjustment, but he pulls Dean up by his sides until he’s stretched out like putty in Castiel’s arms. Dean has to do a little more work now, but he takes it on beautifully, rutting his hips around and riding Castiel’s cock. With every raise of his hips, Castiel plunges in deeper, both of them picking up the pace with sudden urgency once the head of his cock hits Dean’s prostate.
mercy?” Dean smirks, slipping a hand in Castiel’s back pocket. “Now that’s something I could get used to.”
“Not something you hear every day,” Dean smiles a moment till he sees Castiel’s face start to sour, “but I like it, it suits you.”
“What a lovely offer, my good boy. Unfortunately I don’t want to be late for brunch. Would you go grab me a tie from my closet? Any color you like.” Castiel plants a kiss on the top of his head and Dean gets up to go find a tie. He thinks it’s pretty formal attire for a brunch with his own dad, but then again, Castiel is a pretty formal guy.
“Alright Dean, did you finish signing everything for me?” Missouri comes back in the room and Dean hands over the papers. “Wonderful, these look good. You know, Dean, have you ever considered a career in social work?”
man out of his head. He craves a deep connection with someone, a bond that’s monogamous and passionate, unlike anything he’s ever had before. He shakes the thought from his head ruefully, though, knowing the chance of finding that tonight is slim to none. As long as he comes at some point tonight, he’ll consider his goal accomplished.
He looks up to see Sam standing in front him, with a very pissed-off look on his face and the bag from their house gripped in his hand.
“Yeah, well, she’s a smokin’ hot alpha so I’m happy for me too,” Gabriel says coarsely, grinning toothily. “You should see her in the sack. I swear, she must have four extra arms hidden away somewhere. The way she can hold me down, get between my dirty pillows while still having havin’ a hand wrapped around my—”
Dean had almost forgotten that Gordon is a cop. He’d always just thought of him as his dad's drinking buddy. Or the asshole who had come on to him and gone after Sam, chasing him out of the house. Why did it have to be
Sam smiled and nodded understandingly. "He can be a bit... prickly lately, but I'll talk to him. I know we can trust you - you’re one of the good ones."
Hands guide him forward till he’s draped across a solid warm body, and Dean’s limbs instinctively curl around it, clinging to his Dom. His Dom has him and all feels right in the world.
“That’s totally freaky, right?” Dean says, voice rising as he—mistakenly—takes in Castiel’s reaction. “You’re right, that’s—that’s nuts. Nobody in their right mind wants to get
Dean blinks hard, trying to rid his eyes of the burning pain. He can’t afford to start crying again, and part of him is shocked he has any tears left to give. Earlier, he’d soaked his first goodbye letter to Cas and had to try all over again. It hadn’t been perfect, but he hoped it was legible. His chest gives another aching
“Yeah?” Castiel leans in, and Dean can’t take his eyes of those fucking lips, pink tongue darting out to wet them.
“No, I had some things to get done,” he answers with his half-truth, knowing Cas would have been fine with him going. “You just laying down mulch?”
“Grab the bed if you need to, whore, but don’t you dare move another muscle.” His dom growls, and Dean quickly braces himself against the bed, shivering at the fierce lust in his voice.
“Hey man,” Dean greets him, and fast as a whip Victor snatches his wrist and twists it up behind his back, making him gasp in pain and drop his bag. “What the fuck!” he grunts, trying to pull away from the firm hold…but Victor got the jump on him, and he can’t move without dislocating his shoulder. Dean’s cock gives the tiniest twitch of interest at being manhandled—
“Are you alright, sweetheart?” The alpha’s voice goes soft as he slowly gets closer, approaching Dean like a skittish animal.
“I love you, Dean,” he whispers out, the words seeming to fill up all the empty spaces within him. Looking up into those eyes, he knows the undeniable truth now… Dean Winchester is loved, and he’s going to love this man right back.
