All that came out when Castiel tried to open his mouth was a tiny squeak of a word, "Yeah." And just like that he sounded like a kid going through puberty again. Get it together Novak! How many men get to say they meet their favorite porn star, and added bonus he's your new neighbor, don't fuck this up! Castiel cleared his throat and turned to walk to the kitchen to put the dish down on the island counter, "Why don't you come in Dean? Have some of this delicious smelling food you've prepared." Castiel asked as he peeled back the tin foil covering and let the aroma of ham and cheese waft off the food and make him moan, "Mmm, this smells so good." His voice was back to it's usual deep sultry tone and that got Dean's attention as he followed him to the kitchen and sat down at the table.
Claire tapped her chin thoughtfully, "Interesting." She giggled as she sank into the comfy cushion on the wicker chair.
"I'm Dean by the way. Dean Winchester. But after so many years working for the studio, I'll answer to Dallas or Dal too- but uhh- I'd prefer if you don't tell people who I am. Not that I'm ashamed or anything...it's just that I worked really hard to save up and start a cooking career and it might not be good for that if people were to find out I did gay porn before, ya know." The tips of Dean's ears were red and he was just too adorable as he looked away from Cas towards his feet, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. It made Castiel want to reach out and devour the sexy man in front of him.
Dean Winchester is an ex-pornstar. Years of being in the industry and saving up has afforded him the opportunity to pursue his lifelong dream of having his own cooking show.
Dean couldn't suppress his laugh as he chuckled at his neighbor, "Yeah man, I'm me. And I'm assuming you're you. Who else would we be?" He shifted the Pyrex pan of casserole under one arm as he placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder, "Though judging by your reaction and the fact that my eyes are up here..." And god Dean hated how much he sounded like some offended woman right now that was being eyed like a piece of meat by a man he didn't know. "...I'm gonna say you used to watch my uhh- videos?"
All the while Dean was studying his neighbor, Cas looked to be a little shorter than Dean, by about an inch or two and the shaft curved up slightly at the end. Whilst Dean kept his pubes neatly trimmed back, Cas preferred to shave it all off and looked to be completely smooth down there. Dean couldn't wait to run his hands, his face, his tounge, across the span of smooth silky skin encircling his crotch.
Cesar let go of Jesse and turned to go, but his wrist was caught by his mate. "You mean we got this."
Jesse cleared his throat before speaking, "The Alpha that took him is Castiel Novak. I managed to find out that he has an estate about four miles from here up on Crest Hill. Sar, he's...he's from a bad family. Their Alphas have a long history of domestic violence, assault and getting off on homicide charges." Jesse clung desperately to his Alpha as he sobbed into his chest, "I'm- I'm scared Cesar. What- what if he kills Dean?" And that was all the Beta could manage before he broke down in his lover's arms.
Yet again Dean found himself acting on instinct and impulse, reaching out to gently touch the Alpha's arm, "Let's start over. I'm Dean Winchester. I'm an Aquarius. I love sunsets, long walks on the beach and frisky men."
Sometimes if an omega's family can scrape together enough money, they can pay an Alpha to claim their omega and sign them over to the family. Then it becomes the family's Alpha's job to find a suitable Alpha to care for them (the Omega may or may not have a say in who they are mated off to, depending on the family alpha, but in most cases they do and pick a compatible alpha who will be nice to them).
Castiel tilted his head and squinted at Dean, "On every planet. Or at least any planet with Angels or any life form capable of speaking Enochian."
Castiel palmed lightly over his hunter's jeans, causing little moans to escape the green eyed man. He slowly unzipped the jeans and pulled them down, along with a pair of purple and green boxers that said 'This is where my monster...hides! with the O on the word monster being a green monster eye. Cas raised an eyebrow at that and let out a laugh, "Seriously?"
Over time the House has decided that if they had to still take care of this useless "meg", they would at least get free labor out of him as compensation for how much more food they had to feed him to keep him alive.
"Probably about as hard as that." Cas flicked his gaze down to Dean's dick that was now fully erect and couldn't get any harder if he tried.
Urged to walk about the house and see the Omegas in person so that he may change his mind, Castiel is captivated by the sun-kissed skin, and piercing ocean-glass green eyes of Dean as the Omega brings him dinner after spending a long day at the House meeting personally with all the Omegas. And if he thought Dean's physical appearance was captivating, he had no fathomable way of describing how intoxicated he'd be by the older Omega's scent. Hints of honeysuckle and rain mixed with the scent of soil after a fresh summer  downpour and drizzled in toasted almond. It reminded him of the summers he spent as a child at his great aunt Silvia's estate watching the bees in the apiary on the north side of the creek where the wild flowers grew. Castiel loved that place and longed for those carefree days of his childhood.
"Hello Dean." Cas said, his voice barely a whisper. "I'm sorry you have to see me like this, but I didn't know where else to go."
Dean moved Cas so he was now sitting up in bed and straddled his gorgeous lips, pushing in slowly and sliding down Castiel's throat. Cas let out moans of pleasure and a muffled, "bweah ween" , which Dean could only assume meant 'Yeah Dean'.  The full size of Dean now buried deep inside his throat had Cas stretched open and full, panting for breath and enjoying every moment of the feeling of the other man inside him. Dean's eyes rolled back in his head at the feeling of Cas' warm hot breath surrounding his dick, "Argh- shit Cas- You feel so good! Sure you can breathe okay?" Cas nodded and that was all Dean needed, "Good, then let's see how much you can handle." Dean grabbed the back of Castiel's head and began slamming his hips into Cas' face, causing his dick to ram down inside his boyfriend's wanting mouth, and damn Cas' mouth felt so good wrapped around him like that. Dean would never admit it aloud, but he had spent countless nights since meeting Cas, just fantasizing how wonderful this very moment would be. And Cas? Well he did more than live up to those fantasies.  With all the obscene little moans and sounds coming from Cas and the beautiful way he looked at Dean through half lidded blissed out eyes, it wasn't long before Dean could feel his orgasm building within him as he slammed one more time, deep into Cas' wanting mouth. Shot after shot of hot thick cum slid down Cas' throat as the angel dug his hands into the firm muscular ass of his man and pulled him as close as possible, Castiel's own orgasm being ripped from him as he struggled to keep up with the sheer volume of cum Dean was feeding him.
"Yeah. I guess a big fat cock is just what the doctor ordered." Dean laughed back as he stroked Castiel's sweat dampened hair.
"Please Dean?" Castiel begged for the tenth time that day since waking up. His crystal blue eyes gazing up at Dean in an adorable puppy dog stare. "Please?"
Dean placed a kiss on Cas' lips, briefly tasting his own cream on Cas' lips, "I love you too angel boy." Dean wrapped his big strong arms around his angel and held him tight. Saying I love you was still so foreign to Dean, but he found that the more he said it to Cas the easier it got, "I love you so much."
Sam and Dean exchanged looks as Dean pales, his eyes going wide, "How- how long have you been standing there?"
Jesse would never never tire of seeing his husband. Cesar had been out of the Army for near three years now, but couldn't shake the habit of dressing like he was going to war each day, especially in moments like this when Jesse called him in a panic.
Cas cursed himself as he sighed deeply before turning to meet the Omega's eyes, "Yes I- I was- I'm much better now. I apologize for my earlier behavior Dean." And the fucker actually bowed his head to Dean. how was he supposed to take that? Alpha's didn't bow or show signs of weakness and humility to anyone, especially not some omega like him.
Dean brushed back a lock of damp hair from Castiel's face and damn those eyes, those piercing blue eyes got him every time as they peered into his very soul and melted the defences around it. Dean would never admit it, but he loved this man, this angel and he would do anything for him. Subconsciously Dean stroked Castiel's back in tiny soothing circles until the exhausted angel fell asleep. When he was sure Cas was out cold, he dared to place a kiss to his temple and pulled him ever so slightly closer to him. He was his and always would be for as long as his angel would allow it. It was getting late and Dean let himself fall into a peaceful sleep with the angel curled up close to him.
Lilith, seeing the Alpha red tinting the oceanic blue eyes of Castiel a dark purple , bowed her head in submission to him, " Relax, I won't touch him. But why do you care?"
Shock filled Cas as he surged forward, his eyes turning violet in response to Dean's howl of approval, even if it was just on a biological level, Dean accepted him, accepted his inner Alpha. Cas' lips crushed Dean's in a passionate kiss. Dean wrestled him for dominance of the kiss, turning it more and more sultry, parting the Alpha's lips and darting his tongue in to claim his mouth.
Castiel gaped at Dean in awestruck wonder. How was it that he was here, but gave off no underlying alpha scent claim? Had no one really chosen him? Had he been alone and here his entire life? The scent dissipated and Castiel looked up from the tray that had been placed in front of him, only to find the Omega had left. Castiel hastily finished a wonderful meal of roast pork, spiced apples and rosemary garlic seasoned carrots and potatoes, before going to speak to the house director Lilith.
"I understand the reference just fine Dean, it's to do with all those movies you watch with the men with superhuman powers." Castiel huffed in annoyance, he wasn't as clueless as Dean often took him to be.
Dean dropped his hand and roared in laughter, the sound echoing off the cement walls, "Wha- Dude, no. You're missing the point, it was a joke, ya know like if we were on the dating game?" Dean noticed the Alpha's expression getting even more confused. "The Dating Game? Come on Cas it was a fairly popular game show in the 70's."
Family of Omegas can not claim them, the only way the Omega can ever see their family again is if an outside alpha claims them and allows the family to see them.
Castiel smiled, "I wouldn't say that. do you have any idea how stunning you are? How perfect? It's the other Alphas, the ones who passed you up, that are the losers. But there loss is hopefully my gain Omega."
Dean was tired. He was tired of hiding who he was. He was tired of all the excuses. and he was tired of the long string of one nighters, just to hide-or at least he thought he was hiding- the fact that he liked Cas. He took a deep breath, about to finally come clean, "Truth is, I hated having sex with all those girls over the years. There was no emotional attachment or bond between any of them. My whole sex life has just made me feel cheap and dirty." Sam placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "I'm not even sure when it started, maybe slowly over time, or maybe right off when he held me close to him and pulled me out of Hell. I don't know. But somewhere along the lines Sammy, I fell for him. It's like he always says, him and I share a more profound bond. And that terrifies me. Not because I give a shit about what others will say, but about what he'll say. I can't- I can't even handle the thought of him just running off if I told him how i feel. I just can't."
Dean's head swirled with the new information, "I see." And then had to stifle a laugh at his next words, how much it made him sound like a fairytale princess, "And what are your intensions with me if I stay?"
Dean broke the kiss first, jumping back once his senses returned and wiping his mouth off, "What the fuck Cas! You used your Alpha powers on me, didn't you!" A accusatory finger pointed at Castiel.
Dean told him what happened and Castiel scolded his daughter, "Claire, do you have any idea how dangerous this could've been if Mr.Winchester wasn't around?" Claire hung her head, too afraid to meet her father's disapproving gaze. Castiel turned to regard Dean, "I'm surprised you spotted the early signs of heat exhaustion."
"Yeah and that all sounded great, but maybe instead of some crappy diner breakfast, you'd let me cook you some real food? Show off my culinary talents for you."
Finally caring enough to at least wear underwear, Dean got dressed and went out to his shed. He paused a moment when he saw his neighbors daughter struggling with the still high temperatures and the weight of the mower. A deep frown creased his handsome face. What was the girl's father thinking sending her out in this heat to mow?
"Which is exactly why you shouldn't be so mean. What if I die? I bet you'll feel bad then. Start crying, 'why oh why didn't I let Cas suck me off when I had the chance?' "
"Ugh- yeah, all but the last part. Your intel's right on the money there. Dean Winchester 35 year old virgin loser." Dean chuckled in attempt to hide his feeling of ineptitude.
Dean shrugged, "I'm a paramedic, I've seen my fair share enough to know the warning signs and that children and the elderly are more susceptible to it."
Dean chuckled at how annoyed the angel was, "Yeah ok, obviously you're sick. And cranky. But I mean how? I thought you said angels were immune to sickness."
Dean swallowed hard and suppressed a moan, not from his own cooking but from the down right sinful noises it elicited from Cas and the knowledge that it was his fault it sounded like his raven haired neighbor was about to cum just from eating. "Ta-talk about what?" Dean subtly shifted the position of his legs under the table to accommodate for his growing length between his thighs.
Again Dean found himself on auto-pilot, taking the proffered hand and stepping out into the lot. Glancing around Dean saw many vintage cars, among them a cherry red 1968 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet and a 1967 Chevy Impala caught his eye. Dean let out a low whistle, "Damn, you got some nice taste in cars Cas-teal."
It was then that Sammy spoke up, clearing his throat, "Ahem, well I think we can deal with that later. For now we better work on getting you better so you can storm the gate. I'll do a supply run at the drugstore, see if I can't find something that might work on Cas. I think you should get him in bed while I'm gone Dean."
Castiel grinned from ear to ear, "Yeah we are. But Dean, I love you even if we can't have kids together. And if you ever did want a child, there are other- as you would say "less fun" ways to have children." And Dean had to laugh as Cas' actual use of air quotes.
He subtly scented the air, taking in a larger breath of the omega's scent, surely he must be claimed, his alpha must just be allowing him to earn a living as some progressive alphas do.
"I love you too...pal." Cas smiled knowingly at Dean. He had heard the whole conversation with Sam and he knew Pal was Dean's way of casually saying he loved him.
The heat had dragged on for two whole weeks in the 100s, and that wasn't even counting the humidity. Dean cursed the heat as he was sure he would quite literally sweat his balls off. It was nothing but cut off jean shorts, or as his sister Jo had called them, his Daisy Duke booty shorts, for the entire time of the heatwave. That was at least when he wasn't working. Not even bothering with a shirt or even underwear, if his junk happened to slip out a little from time to time while he chanced an outing to water his yard, so be it, it wasn't like he was forcing anyone to look at him. If people had a problem with potentially seeing things they didn't want to see, well Dean supposed that was their own fault.
The Alpha seemed calmer now, the Alpha rage gone. Sensing Dean's fear, he looked over as he pulled up to a security gate, "For what it's worth, you're safe now. My name's Castiel by the way."
Fueled by his innate alpha instincts to sniff out his intended omega, Castiel chased after that sweet summer scent. He flung open the kitchen doors, reaching Dean and tossing the bewildered omega over his shoulder. The sounds of Jesse screaming and hysterically swearing in Spanish were silenced as Castiel spun around to stare him down, gritting out one word and one word only, "Mine!" His eyes now an all consuming inferno of scarlet rage.
A mate in this case does not necessarily mean the Omega will mate and bed the Alpha, it simply means that the Omega becomes the property of the Alpha as far as the law is concerned.
"Dean I- that was beautiful. Do you realize that was the first time you ever said you loved me in exactly those three little words? And in perfect Enochian...you really have been trying hard for me, haven't you?" The angel had to sniffle and hold the tears back as he wrapped the hunter in his arms and folded his wings around him.
Castiel is getting on in years, he has put his career 1st for too long and now, feeling pressured by his family to mate, has decided to choose an Omega to spend his life with. He was given pictures and scent samples of all the Omegas at Primrose, but none caught his eye, or had a scent he found pleasing to his inner alpha.
"That don't make it any better kid." Dean looked over to see no car in the driveway or signs that anyone was even watching the girl. "You alone?" He asked, almost certain he already knew the answer.
Cesar smoothed a massive hand over his mate's back and held his head close to him with the other, "Shh." He soothed. "It'll be okay. Dean's practically family, he's a brother to you. I protect my family Gatito." Cesar tilted Jesse's head up to kiss him. "The Jeep's loaded with enough firepower to storm the city, I've got this."
Those eyes, those stupidly blue, perfectly wonderful eyes.And raven colored hair that was messy and screamed of bedhead and sex. What Dean would do to make the man's hair messy for that very reason, late night sex and sleeping in with the handsome doctor. Dean was awestruck and dumbfounded a moment before his brain supplied him with an answer, "Winchester. Dean Winchester." He held his hand out for the other man to shake.
Cas? Castiel decided he liked the nickname, no one had ever called him Cas before. Plenty of people had butchered the pronunciation of his name, but no one had ever thought to simplify it to Cas. He turned to scoop two large spoonfuls of the casserole onto Dean's plate and his and grabbed them some forks to eat with before joining Dean at the table. "So, do you want to talk about it?" Cas said between mouthfuls of food that made him moan.
While it is perfectly legal for an Alpha to marry a Beta and even choose to never claim an Omega, Beta men can not bare children like an Omega nor can they impregnate Omegas like Alphas can, thus they are seen as lesser and sometimes even lower ranked to Omegas as they can not contribute to humanities survival as a species.
Sam pulled out his phone and held up a picture of his brother snuggled up to the angel, "That's because I finally have proof of how much you love Cas."
Dean is not so lucky. He does not get picked at 18. He does not get picked at 28. Omegas typically stop conceiving and therefore being desirable for breeding after 32.
Dean couldn't help but laugh as the pup let out a sad little whimper, getting his paws back under himself and righting himself once more, the dang thing was just too adorable, just like the man he fell in love with.
Dean expects to receive a 35th ribbon when he goes downstairs and nothing else, instead he is presented with a chain of 35 ribbons with 34 knots, told it will take him 16 years to conceive a child and laughed at by the cruel alpha Crowley that sneers at  him, "At 51, you'd be lucky if an alpha even still touches you. Hell at 35, you'd be lucky if they even desire you now. I bet you're all dried up and useless already. An alpha would be daft for choosing you over our younger, more desirable models."
Castiel was frustrated as he sat in his faux leather computer chair, his hand wrapped tightly around his lube covered dick. Since the first Time he watched Dean Winchester strip on camera- when the freckled face, bow legged, muscled Adonis had posted his first video with Stallion Studios- Castiel was quickly done in, no other guy could get his dick to so much as even twitch in eagerness. Cas could only get off to Dean and now- now the man had announced he was leaving the world of porn and becoming a chef. For a brief moment after watching Dean give his final performance and say,his good byes to his loyal fans, Castiel had pictured Dean in the kitchen with a rather large zucchini shoved up his ass as he worked the produce in and,out of himself to get off. Castiel had come hard, his head tossed back, vision blurring at the edges as he screamed out Dean's name,into the void of his apartment.
Dean is edging on 33 and has long given up on ever leaving Primrose Omega House (such a pretty name for such an ugly place, Dean thinks). The law is quite rigid though, no omega may leave without a claim on them, even at his "old" age, Dean is restricted off the grounds and would be deemed as a rouge (feral) omega and danger to society if he left. He would be put down on sight off the grounds.
"Woah! Hey, kid take it easy. Hey come here, sit." Dean placed a hand on her shoulder and the other on her arm and gently guided her over to his porch to sit on the steps before he took off into his house. He emerged a minute later with a bottle of water and a cold wash cloth. He pressed the cloth to her burning forehead and held the bottle up for her to take long slow sips. "What the Hell was your old man thinking sending you out in this heat to mow?" Dean glanced the girl up and down, "What are you ten?"
Again the Alpha shocked him, getting up out of his chair and lowering himself to kneel on one knee before Dean, "I swear to you I will do my best to be an Alpha worthy of you. I will follow your lead and do only what's asked of me. I will take no more from you than you permit and if I step out of line Omega, please let me know so that I may right my actions."
"He's right you know, about you being in bed. Come on, you can take my bed, "Dean moved to sling an arm under Castiel's and help him into bed."
Dean considered his options a bit, stay here with this strange Alpha he knew nothing about save for his first name and the obvious fact he came from money, or go back to a place where no one wanted him, no one except for Jesse that was- oh shit! Jesse! He was there when Cas went all Alpha rage on the place and stormed off with Dean over his shoulder shouting and pounding on the Alpha to let him go. He must be worried sick about him. He and Jesse had become close like brothers over the years and Dean could only imagine how he'd feel if things were reversed and he were in Jesse's position.
Dean gave him his best bitch face, "Oh cram it Samantha." Sam just smiled, causing Dean to eye him suspiciously, "someone's in a good mood. You always hate it when I call you that."
Dean rolled his eyes and let out an exasperated huff, "Cas, buddy, I already told you, that's not gonna help unblock your throat. And besides you're sick."
Dean had moved to the small New York town to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and the night parties he had come accustomed to. He lived on a secluded dead end street and hadn't had a chance to say hello to his only neighbor on the road yet. He had caught a glimpse of the man- a dark haired man dressed in a suit and jacket- driving down the road one day, but that was the extent of their meeting. After a week of unpacking and settling in, Dean thought he'd make a casserole bake and bring it over to his neighbor in an attempt to introduce himself to the man.
Dean is taught how to fix things around the estate and is in charge of any minor medical care the omega children might need, applying creams and ointments, and dispensing over the counter medicine as directed. He is also taught how to cook as part of his omega duties and develops his talents further as he becomes the 2nd chef in command of the House, working under a Beta male named Jesse who is about his age.
bailed the accountant out. Only, I didn’t know who he was at the time. If I knew, I never would of put up the bond. I mean, it would only be a matter of time before Lucifer vanished him from the planet and I’m out my four hundred and fifty grand.”
From out of nowhere, three men in suits appear and surround Dean. Crowley gestures to the car. “Best if you get in, yeah?”
“The number Novak called after he was arrested.” Dean starts to copy it down. “Two-one-two. Looks like I’m going to New York.” He gives Bobby a hug for his trouble and exits the police station. A short man with steel-rimmed sunglasses, dressed in a sharply pressed navy-blue suit stands alongside a car outside of the station. His name is Crowley. As Dean walks down the street, Crowley blocks his way. They lock eyes.
As Benny turns to look, Dean decks him unconscious. “So damn gullible.” He bends down and forces Zeke to his feet. “Let’s go.”
“Right.” Dean sighs and speaks around a mouthful of pancakes. “How do you even know this Novak guy’s even still alive?”
“Oh yeah, right,” Gabriel replies, waving the slip in the air dismissively. “I was just going over to Denny’s to catch the ‘grand slam breakfast.’ They start serving at six-thirty.”
“No. Because I’ve got you! And you’re gonna go find him and bring him back so I don't lose any money.”
He bounces on his ass, curses, gets up, pulls out his .45, and doesn’t need to open the door to see into the apartment through the hole. Twenty-six-year-old Zeke Langston climbs out of his window into the night, clanging up the fire escape in an attempt at a getaway. Dean kicks in the door and chases after him. Zeke makes his way up to the roof and starts running. The lights of downtown L.A. sparkle in the distance.
Gabriel stops and puts a hand on Dean’s arm to stop him as well. “Dean, I’ve got something better than fifteen hundred.”
There’s a dark cavern filled with file cabinets. Bobby pulls the police booking slip and hands it to Dean. As he reaches to take it, Bobby doesn’t let go.
“I was just saying to myself that this has been the worst day in memory. All I need is Dean Winchester to appear, and look what blows in.”
The street’s dead silent as the Impala pulls into a spot at the curb beside the four-story slum. Killing the engine, Dean gets out and takes a moment to light a cigarette. The flame reveals his strong yet haggard face. He’s a pressure-cooker, always about to explode. The flame of his cigarette dances for a moment, the only light to be found on the street. Dean glances at his watch. It’s an old and battered Timex that’s been with him for many years. He doesn’t need to check his .45 to know that it’s loaded inside of his shoulder holster. Raising his collar against the chill in the air, he trots towards the slum. It’s easy enough to break in and he quickly moves up the first few flights to the third floor. The building is silent. He hits the top step. Squints. Finds apartment 3C. Approaches. Stops. Puts his ear to the door. Removes a lock pick. Crouches. Slips it in. Jiggles it quietly. Drops it. As soon as he bends over to retrieve the lock pick, a shotgun suddenly unloads from the other side of the door. Wood chunks fly and a gaping hole appears in the door right where Dean’s head was a moment before.
Garth bites his lip but knows not to push. Giving a nod, he says, “Okay, well, if you change your mind, you’ve got my number!”
“Because he sends Lucifer postcards from everywhere, telling him what a great time he’s having with his money. It’s like the guy has a death wish.”
They make it to Denny’s and sit at a table. Knowing it’s on Gabriel’s tab, Dean doesn’t stop himself from ordering a coffee and a ‘grand slam breakfast’ for himself. It’s not often he can swindle Gabriel for breakfast food.
“Hey, can we stop and buy a copy of Playboy, because when I’m being jerked off, I like to look at something.”
Dean tosses his cigarette to the ground below, hoists himself up to the roof, and pursues Zeke. As Zeke leaps from his building over to the next, Dean does the same. The pursuit continues across three more rooftops. Amazed that Dean is still on his tail, Zeke makes his most daring jump yet. He lands with a tumble, scoops up his shotgun and keeps moving. Without missing a beat, Dean makes the leap and misses! He grabs at the ledge with his armpits. He slides slowly, grabbing for dear life as the old ledge cracks. It’s a four-story drop. Some debris falls away. Dean manages to pull himself back onto the roof. Winded, he spots Zeke going down a fire escape at the far end of the building. Dean is up and after him.
Dean takes a long drag of his coffee before answering. “He’s that accountant that embezzled a couple million from some Vegas wise guy and gave it to charity.”
Dean looks around the restaurant. Without looking back at Gabriel, he says, “I’ll do it for a hundred grand.”
Gabriel runs a hand through his styled hair. “If you don’t get this guy, I might be out of business. I can’t absorb this kind of loss, Dean.”
Jez flips through the Los Angeles Times. “It says here that eleven percent of people, in the course of dreaming, are aware of the fact they’re dreaming while they’re in the dream state.”
“I’ll do it for a hundred grand and then I’m out of this business forever. And I want a contract. I want it in writing. A hundred grand and I’ll have the Angel here by Friday night.” Dean sees that Gabriel is about to give in. “Now, do you think I could have my fifteen hundred?”
Dean moves through the homicide division with Detective Bobby Singer. Other detectives sit at their desks and phones ring as the two pass by.
“If you want me for a job this big, you pay me what’s right. Maybe you haven’t noticed but I’m tired of getting shot at.”
One of the agents gets out of the car to allow Dean to pass. Giving Crowley one last smile, Dean says, “Have a nice day!” and gets out. As the door shuts, Dean asks, “Do you think I could have my sunglasses back?” As the car begins to roar off, Crowley tosses Dean’s sunglasses out the window. Dean catches them and watches as the car disappears. “Thanks a lot,” he mutters as he reaches into his pocket and retrieves a wallet he stole from Crowley. Looking inside of it, he sees Crowley’s FBI identification and it makes him smile. “Thanks a lot.”
Gabriel shrugged and popped a handful of M&Ms in his mouth. “There were some very handsome twinks involved too.”
Cas glanced at Dean, uncertainty spelled out on his face. Dean shrugged. His dad would find out sooner or later that he’d been to Hell.
“Don’t.” Sam could see the faint waves of power rolling off of the archangel. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“I used up all of my grace recently in order to heal… someone.” Dean was glad that Cas didn’t mention Jack yet. He wasn’t ready to introduce John to his son yet, he wasn’t going to lie.
Jody blinked in surprise. “Y-yes. Yes, of course I’ll help you.” As much as Claire itched to leave this very second, she knew that Jody’s help would be instrumental to this case. And she needed all the help she was going to get if she was going to avenge Kaia.
“This is a dumb idea,” he bitched to Sam, unbuckling Jack from his car seat and securing him in the bjorn that he hadn’t bothered to take off while he drove.
“There have been two murders in the last twenty-four hours, both at the same local business.” Dread dropped into his stomach like a stone as he looked up at the television screen. He recognized it as Missouri’s friend Dede’s house. “The latest victim has been identified as Missouri Moseley. She was found dead at the scene.” He didn’t hear the rest as his pulse roared in his ears.
“It’s fine.” Claire knew she had no ground to stand on here. “I’m the one who left.” God, how long had it been? Weeks? Months?
Dean swallowed thickly, thinking about the home that Cas and Kelly had so painstakingly built for Jack. Just for it, and them, to be taken away. “Yeah. We’ll, uh. I’ll grab the basics, take apart the, uh. The crib. Grab some formula. Yeah.”
The fire returned to Gabriel’s eyes. Before Cas knew what was happening, he was enveloped in a blaze of light.
Dean made his way to where Cas lay in the mud, wings burned into the ground. He felt as though every organ in his body was constricting, but he continued taking steps toward the angel. He couldn’t leave him out here, like this. He couldn’t.
“Patience, I said now,” James yelled. Dean almost flinched, reminded of his father. The three adults stood in silence, an almost solid tension between them.
“Alright, single file line, tell me your names when I give you a sandwich so I can learn them,” Dean ordered. They formed a line, and Mary handed them plates as they filed toward Dean.
“She’s dead.” It was sad news, but at this point, Dean didn’t care. He had a mission, and he intended to complete it.
“Thank you.” This time, Jack took the bottle, and grunted happily as he sucked at the rubber top. Sam walked over to the table and sat in front of his laptop, then frowned.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, but the sound of loud footsteps reached his ears. They were headed towards their room. Dean grabbed his gun off of the table while Sam set Jack down on the bed. He made his way to the door and nodded at Sam. Sam picked up his gun and nodded back. In just a few swift movements, Dean opened the door, grabbed whoever was outside, and flung them onto the couch.
Sam glanced at Dean to confirm the truth of the statement. “Yeah,” Dean said, “well, he’s had his first real human breakfast, and now Mom’s kicked me out of my kitchen to cook for her new kids.”
Sam was hunched over a collection of books, ones that he said all had mentions or more of alternate realities. Dean did not envy him the headache he was likely causing himself.
“You’re doing great, Donatello,” Sam said to the prophet, ten trips to KFC later. “I mean, it looks like you made a lot of progress.” There were notes sprawled all over the table, mostly unreadable, but still, it was something.
Where the hell was Dean going? His brother was going to get himself killed, and by some witch’s curse. He strapped a rather unhappy Jack into his car seat in Cas’ truck, and drove as fast as he could to the grocery store. When he arrived, he spotted two young blonde women standing near Dean. One held a large sledgehammer in her hands.
“Oh, Baby,” Dean bemoaned, walking over to the cartoonized car. He got into the driver’s seat, so Sam took his place in the passenger’s seat. It was extremely odd, doing something so normal from a cartoon lens.
The archangel’s scowl melted into something Sam could only describe as haunted. “He was shooting up my grace.”
She stared at him. Was it a low blow to psychoanalyze her like this? But then again, Sam had been in her shoes. She knew this.
Cas made his way to the refrigerator, still shushing Jack. He pulled out a bottle of formula, and offered it to Jack, but he was inconsolable.
When Cas placed his socked feet on the ground, he gasped. The floor was freezing. Normally things like this didn’t bother him. He hadn’t felt cold since….
He wiped off as much of the dirt as he could, scrambled out of the grave, and tucked it into his jacket pocket. Jack stared at the clouds above them as Sam pushed him back to the car.
That seemed to be enough acceptance for John to take a seat at the end of the table. “Um… Dean said that a lot has happened since I…”
Missouri paused before answering. “He has his reasons.” Dean wanted to say something, but he didn’t know how to handle the look of sorrow on his friend’s face. “I’ll just stay behind, say my farewells to Dede.”
They both looked over at Patience. Claire was skeptical– sure, she’d seen a lot more of the supernatural than most, but she had to draw the line somewhere.
“Yeah, well, neither are me and Sam.” Cas watched as Dean walked out to the hallway. “I’ll let you put him to sleep,” he said as he gently shut the door behind him.
So quickly he stumbled over his words, Sam explained what Kaia had told him. Dean’s eyes grew wider and wider.
Dean grabbed a box of raspberries out of the fridge, and set a few in front of Jack. He picked one up in his pudgy little hand and angrily threw it to the floor. “Da!”
“I told you, I don’t–” She sighed. Sam waited for her to speak again. “Before he crushed my skull, Lucifer showed me his face. His true face.”
“Dean, this isn’t a dummy,” he hissed, “this is blood.” He ripped away the blanket, revealing the body. “He’s dead. Like, really, actually dead.”
Mariana nodded. “Well, I’m pretty sure I saw a ghost up on Mount Healy today. It was a little girl, in this old timey dress… and I mean, she looked real, but… the wind, it was blowing really hard today, I mean it nearly took Rori off the mountain, but this girl… her dress and hair weren’t moving at all.”
“No!” Cas shrieked. He lept up, snatching the child out of Lucifer’s arms, but it was too late. His grace was gone.
Her dad gave her a mournful look. She couldn’t bear to watch it, so she turned and jogged the rest of the way down the stairs. As she ran out the front door, she heard her dad behind her.
No shit. It’s a children’s cartoon. “Yeah. Yeah, okay,” Sam sighed. Then a thought hit him. “So, if that guy can die for real in this cartoon, that means we can, too.” The thought did not sit well with Sam. Surely Gabriel wasn’t trying to kill them? Just teach them a bit of a lesson? Then again. He had orchestrated the Mystery Spot situation.
Claire sat in the back of Patience’s Jeep, watching Alex and Patience throwing rocks into the nearby river, trying to teach Jack how. The kid was cute, she had to admit. He still held onto her Grumpy Cat plushie. Though she wouldn’t admit it to anyone, she’d grown stupidly attached to the thing. It was like a good luck charm.
He ignored the Winchesters calling after him as he slammed the dungeon door behind him and slid the bolt closed. Donatello watched him with disinterest as he approached.
The next morning, Cas was gone. This didn’t surprise Dean all that much; Cas sometimes disappeared when Jack felt a miracle should be performed. Despite his speech about non-interference, he occasionally used Cas as a loophole to answer a well-deserved prayer here and there. Besides, the guy had his wings back, and Dean knew how much Cas loved to fly.
Claire trailed after her dad and as they left, Dean suddenly knew why the young girl had questioned him so. She was fishing for answers as to where her dad stood with having a chance at him. Had he liked him for a long time and Dean was just too oblivious to it? He had been told he often threw himself into work and blocked out everything else. Dean was confused by Cas' forward flirting.
Castiel raked his eyes down Dean's sweat glistened chest and lowered his gaze down to steal a peek at Dean's tight little shorts, "Well, keep dressing like that and I might need CPR." Castiel gave a filthy wink and flashed a bit of tongue before smirking and heading back to his place, "Thanks for everything Dean. Maybe I'll see you around work sometime?"
"What?" The girl's eyes widened as she realized the implications of her question to her 'hero'. "Oh eww. If I was like 20 years older maybe, but gross, you're like my dad's age. So girlfriend, you got one?"
Dean had felt kinda bad for his most loyal fans, the ones who had paid to watch every video of his since he started in the adult video industry. That combined with the fact that if Dean was,totally honest with himself he enjoyed people worshipping his body, he decided to do his cooking show in nothing but a small waist apron that covered his well endowed length and left his ass exposed.
"Claire." The girl replied as she tossed her long braid back over her shoulder. "Clair Novak. And I need to finish before my father gets home, he's always working so hard and he'll be so tired when he gets home. I really wanted to do this for him so he didn't have to worry about it."
The Alpha tossed a glance over his shoulder at Dean, "I guess." He shrugged, "They were all gifts from father. And the name's Castiel. Not Cast-teal. You can just call me Cas if you want."
Turning the faucet on cold, Dean let it run while he grabbed a washcloth from a nearby cupboard to soak in the icy water. Castiel was all bundled up and had managed to steal Sam's blankets as well when Dean returned. Stern emerald eyes pierced through Castiel, "What in the hell do you think you're doing. You're burning up and making yourself worse." Dean tore all the covers off the angel and threw them across the room before placing the cold compress onto Cas's forehead.
"You know he loves to study, plus I think he's doing it just to win Gabriel over and get in his pants...not that that'd be hard to do considering how easy your brother seems to be. But Cas I do- I mean you know that I- gon urmedvangraph gonmedvan." Dean finished out the rest of his sentence in flawless Enochian,that set Castiel's crystal blue eyes pooling with unshed tears.
Castiel woke up briefly to feel Dean still tightly wrapped around him. He peered over at the hunter's sleeping form, shocked to see how peaceful the man beside him looked. Tiny butterflies flittered in Cas's heart at the thought that he had been the one to put that smile on his face. The angel rolled over and went back to sleep, his eyes becoming blurry with the image of the emerald green eyed hunter wrapped around him.
Castiel roared as his alpha fangs elongated and the claws on his hands morphed to miniature dagger, "And if it were up to me I'd do the same to you for even suggesting that!"
The petite alpha female shrugged," Oh, you mean Dean? Well, that's because he is unclaimed. Pathetic thing really. A day shy of 35 and not once has an Alpha claimed him, not that any would now given his age and most likely barren body. We were able to teach him a few things as evident from that meal you had, so I suppose he's not a complete waste of space. Though if it weren't for pesky laws, if I'd have my way I'd have used him as fodder for the fields long ago. We'd have wasted your time including him in the files we sent."
When both men had gotten their fill of the other, Dean broke the silence by looking up at Cas and asking, "So, what now?"
The Alpha skidded the SUV to a stop and jumped out, whipping off his aviators and clipping them onto the side of his Army pants. Last nights remaining snow and the myriad of fiery orange leaves crunching under his tactical boots as he marched up to meet Jesse on the porch of primrose. His biceps threatened to shred his olive green tee as he crossed his arms, hazel eyes looking up at his husband as he spoke, "So where to Mi Gatito?" Gatito was Cesar's pet name for Jesse, Spanish for kitten. Many assumed it was a sexual thing, but few knew the truth, it was because the two had met when Cesar's retired Army dog (A hulking German Shepperd aptly named Goliath), had chased after a stray kitten, chasing it and running into Jesse when the kitten had ran between his legs. Goliath had toppled Jesse over and when Cesar caught up, he was captivated by the man, despite his obvious Beta gender.
From birth all Omegas are placed in the care of an Omega House, an institution where they are cared for (all though just barely enough to meet their basic needs, there is to be no special attention or love shown towards them beyond caretakers simply meeting their basic needs) until an Alpha comes to claim them as their mate to do whatever they see fit with them.
“Oh, cowboy, I’m not that weak,” Lucifer shot back, standing from the bench and backing away. Cas stopped, but did not let his glare waver. “You and I need to talk.”
“You liked her, right?” Lucifer teased mirthlessly. “Oh, Cas, you should’ve seen it. The things he did to her, I mean, in all my time in Hell, I have never seen anything that horrible.”
Billie looked at him for a long moment before speaking again. “You want to know something interesting?”
Dean shook his head, and laid a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “You were dead, man. It’s enough of a miracle that you’re back at all.” Cas looked up at him, and he smiled encouragingly. “Now, it’s time to meet your kid.”
“Well,” Dean said, “it’s good to have you back, Cas.” The last word came out a breath, and it made Cas’ heart stutter. “All right, follow my lead.” He smirked briefly, reaching for the door handle. “We’ll fit right in.”
“You know,” Dean said, sidling back towards the table, “Sam and I, we’re actually mystery solvers, too. Mind if we tag along?”
” He paused. “‘Cause, fun fact– in all of forever, nothing ever wakes up here. I mean ever. And second fun fact– when you woke up, I woke up, and I don’t like being awake. So,” the being took a deep breath, which Cas knew to be more of a dramatic and theatrical thing, to display its displeasure, but it unnerved him nonetheless, “
“Okay, let’s face it, Cassandra, the truths I say hurt because they’re hard to swallow, so people call ‘em lies. Go figure.”
The Sarge was already there when he arrived, shotgun in hand. Dean cursed under his breath. He hoped he wouldn’t have to explain the whole ‘monsters are real’ thing to him.
Jody stared at the rip. No, she wouldn’t go back. She wouldn’t let Claire put herself in danger. “I’m going in.”
Claire didn’t expect Kaia to be able to move so quick, but her mouth crashed against Claire’s in a heartbeat. Claire allowed it for a moment, a long moment, before pulling away. She smiled at Kaia.
When John poured his third glass, Cas appeared to him. John yelled and dropped the glass, and it shattered on the floor. Cas watched idly as John grabbed a knife from the knife block on the counter behind him and stabbed him in the chest. He was hit with a very brief wave of nostalgia, recalling when Dean had done the same, but staring at the man who had left so many scars on Dean’s beautiful soul, it washed away quickly.
“It was quite a shock to me as well. I was much more comfortable with her dead, after all she did…” Cas trailed off, lost in horrific memories. He shook his head, as if shaking off the memories. “But, Heaven needs angels, even ones like Naomi who torture the free will out of angels.”
At that, Sam inhaled sharply and began to straighten up, shaking off his delirium. He pulled uselessly against the ropes that bound his wrists.
Sam had just finished explaining the whole apocalypse-world ordeal when Rowena interrupted them. He’d forgotten that she was still in the room. Cas had taken Jack back to his room for a nap, Gabriel had disappeared out the front door to mope about getting pickpocketed by Lucifer, and Mary had returned to the refugee children. Sam hadn’t even had a chance to call Dean yet.
“She referred to them as her kids,” Dean confirmed, setting Jack down on his blanket and collapsing into one of the library chairs. Cas followed suit.
Finally they found themselves all in the sitting room again. Sam and Dean stood protectively between the Scooby Gang and the doors.
“We’re going to have to keep him overnight,” she explained apologetically. “We’re not sure if we’re going to be able to break the fever, and something is still causing him pain, we think a headache, but he’s too young for us to prescribe him any painkillers.”
Who did these guys think they were, a couple of Incredible Hulks? To be fair, they had the build for it.
She stopped in her tracks and dropped her duffel. Alex jumped up. Her eyes were glassed over. Another vision. She gasped as the vision ended, then raced down the stairs. Alex followed her. Claire and Kaia looked up from playing with Claire’s plush Grumpy Cat with Jack.
Sam rolled his eyes. Dean’s obsession knew no bounds. He came back out a few moments later, his eyes bright with excitement.
“Hmm.” Cas was lost in reading another informational plaque about placer mining and its influence in the archeological world. Dean huffed and turned to another exhibit displaying a multitude of vintage Winchester rifles.
“Missouri,” Sam said, the recognition flooding him with joy. He hadn’t realized that he’d missed her. “Wow, I mean, it’s been…”
“We hear you’ve been in conference with the Winchesters,” the woman said, stalking in a circle around Kaia.
A loud clanging sound resounded through the hallway. The demon gasped. Cas heard the wardings on Lucifer’s cell fizzle out. This was his chance. He slipped past his own bars, and watched Lucifer continue to strangle the demon. He yanked open the door to Gabriel’s cell and pulled the archangel out. He was clad in a filthy straightjacket covered in wardings. He’d have to deal with that later.
He jumped to the side as Sarge pulled the trigger, blowing the ghouls head to pieces. Athena gasped as she was hit with flying chunks of brain.
“Hey, Dean?” Cas said, standing from the table. Jack was fussing in his arms. “I’m going to put Jack to bed, he’s getting pretty cranky.”
“Yes,” Cas grumbled. Sam turned to see him watching Dean with an exasperated expression on his face, the closest thing to a bitchface that Sam had ever seen on the angel, “yes he does.” How the hell did Cas know about that? He thought of a few choice files he’d had to delete from his laptop, and hoped Cas didn’t know the full extent of Dean’s obsession.
Sam flared his nostrils in irritation, shutting his eyes tight against the bright lights of the bunker. “Yeah, well, I’ve been a little busy, Dean. Sorry.” He most certainly was not sorry.
“What the hell, you’re not driving, right?” the waitress responded in a friendly voice. Dean looked up at her sharply. “I’ve just– I’ve seen you around the hotel,” she said, backtracking slightly. “Passing through with, what, your…?”
The man stood and shook Dean’s hand. “It’s Sarge,” he replied in a deep, gravelly voice. “Sergeant Joe Phillips. Sheriff’s on vacation.”
The nurse walked away from Kaia’s bed and Claire ducked away so that she wouldn’t be noticed. She waited until the nurse was far enough away, then entered the room.
“How?!” How could Dean just sit there and drive as though they were still in their twenties, chasing down run-of-the-mill ghosts and vampires?
“Jody, that’s always your excuse.” Honestly, Claire was sick of it. “Every time we’d go out on a hunt together, you’d end up taking care of the monster while I wait in the car.”
Suddenly, a pale orange rock sailed through the girl’s head. She shrieked one last time as she vanished into a flurry of sparks.
Dean stared at the two bodies laying side by side on the pyre as he shook gasoline onto the logs below them. They almost looked fake. He wished they were. Sam stood a few feet away, rocking a sleeping Jack in his arms. The kid looked so tiny in the arms of his towering brother. When the canister was empty, he walked over to Sam and took out his lighter.
Cas shrugged the shirt on, figuring it was better to just oblige than to try to argue that he really wasn’t cold.
“You know,” Dean said, “I said it before, but good work in there.” He didn’t want to admit that he probably could have been taken out if it weren’t for Patience’ warning.
“Hey, buddy,” he cooed, trying not to sound nervous and failing. “Hey, you’re okay, I’ve got you.” It was no use. Jack wailed, showing off his tiny pink tongue and gums. Sam was just about to call out for Dean when he heard his heavy footfalls on the stairs again.
Cas melted into his arms. They stood there for what might have been a few seconds, and might have been years.
“Well, I’m Agent Russell,” Dean replied. “This here is my associate.” He looked over at Cas, signaling to make up a name for himself. Going with a theme of westerns, huh?
He raced down to the basement, meeting up with Dean and Sam. They had prepared a salt circle beneath a winding slide. After a few moments, the ghost came careening down the slide, and tumbled into their trap. It shrieked and flung itself at the border to no avail.
Sam clenched his jaw. “If Buddy is doing this, he’s targeting your patients. So who else has access to this office, your notes, your appointments?”
Dean figured it was too late for any attempt at a normal explanation. “Okay, well, your boyfriend, uh, is not exactly human.”
Mary figured that Dean would not take her newfound motherhood well. It was something that she had denied him, but gave freely to the children she’d taken under her wing in the alternate world.
As if some unspoken prayer had been answered, there came a crackling noise from above Kaia’s shrine, where Claire was kneeling. Not daring to believe her ears alone, Claire looked up. Her hopes were confirmed. There above her was a sparking, glowing portal, exactly like the one she had lost Kaia to. Without a thought or plan, Claire reached out to touch the portal.
The first thing Dean noticed upon entering the museum was the whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling.
Sam groaned again. He was hungry, sure, but he wasn’t lizard-level hungry. “We really gotta get moving, keep looking for that door.”
“No,” Dean replied tersely, then immediately dropped a sizzling piece of bacon on his wrist. “Son of a bitch!”
The car door creaked open. He whirled around to see Rowena exiting the car. Hoisting Jack up on his hip, he followed her.
“You should go with,” Dean pleaded. Cas was human now. He didn’t know how to fight as a human. Dean couldn’t lose him.
“You have work to do. That’s all you need to know.” Dean didn’t like the sound of that. “And trust me, having my eyes opened to the necessity of any humans, especially Winchesters, is not a thrill.”
“We…” he swallowed thickly. “We found Kelly and… and Cas. They were renting this little house on a lake in Washington. We were supposed to grab him and Kelly, get them back to the bunker, where they’d be safe….” He didn’t want to go over every detail. It was too painful. “Things went to shit, as they always do. Somehow, the birth ripped open this… this portal to an alternate universe. I know, it sounds crazy, crazier than usual.” Jody scoffed at him, but didn’t say anything. “We trapped Lucifer in the other world, but in the process he grabbed Mom and pulled her through, and Cas….” He couldn’t say it. Tears threatened to spill down his face, but there was no way he was crying in front of Jody, mother-figure though she may be.
“Why do you have all this?” Patience asked shakily. Poor girl was still new to the monster-hunting world.
“No reason,” Dean said quickly, turning his gaze back to his pizza. He knew that Cas probably suspected what he was thinking, but the angel said nothing about it as they finished dinner. They left the pizza box on the table when they got up to get ready for bed, knowing that due to it being Heaven and all, everything would be cleaned up in the morning.
Dean almost missed the days when hunting was just going wherever his dad pointed him, following orders, salt it and burn it and walk away. Life was simpler then.
Dean nodded resolutely. “Well, then we do what we do.” Somehow, Dean’s determination was comforting. “Whatever it takes.” He clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder and headed out the door.
“Just until we’ve checked things out, okay?” She was desperate to keep Claire out of this until absolutely necessary. After Patience’s vision….
Sam stood and followed his Gabriel and Dean, Cas close behind him with Jack humming tunelessly around his pacifier.
Quicker than Cas ever remembered being, his counterpart was rushing toward him, blade at the ready. Though Cas parried the strike, he immediately recognized that this version of himself was much more seasoned and much better trained in battle. He would not win a straight fight.
He wouldn’t think about that now. He couldn’t. Push it down, focus on the more pressing issue. Get Mom back. Do that, then deal with the Devil. Don’t let the fear consume him.
“Jerk.” Sam left the room, and Dean sluggishly made his way over to the dresser. As much as he wanted to crawl back into bed and drink away his brain cells, he needed to do better. For Cas, and for Jack.
“I don’t see what the problem is. Lend us a little grace, and then we owe you a favor. Sounds like a fair deal to me.”
All of a sudden, the car swerved. Sam grabbed onto the dashboard to steady himself. Jack began to scream in the backseat.
Cas walked into the movie room and froze. Gabriel was perched contentedly on the couch, feeding Jack a red lollipop. Cas would have voiced his concerns about feeding Jack such a sugary item, but the child seemed to be getting more of it on his face than in it, and he had bigger concerns due to the lack of Winchesters in the room.
“The spell I told you about requires two witches. The portion that I will do requires a powerup from you in order to kill an archangel.” She sipped at her wine.
The laptop on the coffee table chimed, so he walked over to the kitchen table so he could check the alert. A ‘code three,’ whatever that meant.
Claire watched as the little girl she’d just saved ran up the front walkway and into her mothers arms. The sight played at her heartstrings; moments like these made her miss her mother. Her father, too. Not that Castiel hadn’t made his own place in her heart, but he could never take Jimmy’s place. Jody, though… she had definitely taken a motherly role in Claire’s life.
Her jaw went slack as soon as she recognized him. “Oh my god, Dean! You’re one of the guys who was researching that luck-granting bar last summer!”
Dean brushed past Dr. Vallens as she opened the door for him. Jack whined a bit as he entered, but quietly down again quickly.
“Well, thank you, Sarah, we’ve had a very… informational day,” Dean said as she walked out with them, flipping off lights and locking the doors.
“Sam,” he said breathlessly, standing in the kitchen entryway. Mary took a seat next to Sam, across from Rowena, still staring John down.
“Indeed.” She watched for a moment as a comet whizzed by. “There is another rule regarding Death. The version of Death that reaps the Light, becomes it.”
He paid for the gas and snacks and made his way back to Jody, trying not to let the grief tear at him. If he let Missouri get to him, then he would think about Mom, and then he would think about Cas, and he couldn’t afford that right now, not when he was responsible for the lives of Missouri’s family.
The apocalyptic Castiel scowled, his eyes flashing blue with anger. “Following the orders of Heaven is right. The command of Heaven is the only right in this world.” With that, Castiel charged at Cas again.
“Look, what happened to Rowena was messed up, okay? But you just let the deadliest witch in the world walk away with a page from this book.”
Sam was out of the car before Dean had even put it in park. He ignored the twisted hands pushing out of the Earth, his only goal to take Jack away from whatever villain it was that they were facing. As he reached the fake Donatello and Jack, he heard Dean’s gun go off, and watched as two bullets hit the man. The world seemed to go into slow motion as the thing dropped Jack. Sam leapt toward the falling infant, catching him in midair, and turned to see the creature’s disguise fall away like mist. In the fake Donatello’s place was a man in a white suit who looked not unlike many of the villains in Dean’s favorite westerns. His face had two long scratches down the side, and when he turned to Sam, his eyes flashed the same yellow as Azazel. Sam felt his blood run cold.
“Cas, that was weeks ago.” Then it hit Dean. “I just talked to you on the phone, though, yesterday. How is that possible?”
The question made Dean pause for a moment before he remembered that Jack’s birthday was in a few days. “Uh, my kid’s first birthday.”
Sam sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He hadn’t had a headache like this since he’d been dealing with psychic powers. “That might be a good idea. Hang on, let me set you up with some protection charms.” He pulled a few charms from one of the duffel bags and tied them around Jack’s tiny wrists, then handed a charm and Jack to Donatello. “Be back in fifteen?”
“Fully resurrected, thanks to some very lovely spellwork by Samuel,” Rowena interrupted, sweeping into the room. She made for the cabinet next to the fridge, where Dean kept his whiskey, and pulled out a bottle of red wine.
“No,” she conceded, “But I think what you need right now is forgiveness. You need to forgive yourself.”
Then it was just him, Cas, Jack, and his Dad in the kitchen. Cas pulled out his phone and started texting someone. Probably Claire, or maybe Jody. Dean didn't really know who else was friends with the guy who wasn't in the room.
“Ah, don’t worry, he’s fine,” Chuck admonished. As if on cue, Dean coughed and opened his eyes. He stared at Cas in disbelief for a moment before registering that there were quite a few other people in the room.
“Yeah, I ran her name through the system,” Jody replied. “She was picked up for possession in Lebanon, Kansas, and then she escaped from the hospital there three days ago. There’s a warrant out for her arrest.”
Jody entered the room, and nodded at them. So Claire wasn’t about to run into the nearest vamp nest and take herself out. Good. She liked her crazy sort-of-sister, despite all the fights they got into.
“Every notebook on this shelf tells a version of how you die,” she said, gesturing at the shelves stacked so high that Dean couldn’t see the top. “You specifically– heart attack, burned by a red-haired witch, stabbed by a ghoul in a graveyard, impaled by a piece of rebar, and on and on.” She paused a moment, eyes drifting over the shelf. “But which one’s right?” She turned back to him. “That depends on you. On the choices you make.” She looked him over briefly. “Since I got this new job, I stand witness to a much larger picture. Do you know what I see?” She paused, as if waiting for Dean to answer, as if Dean could possibly know. “You. And your brother. You’re important.”
“...must bear witness to possess ability of it. To protect it. Yes. Protect the power. The power has been given you to… TREAD… UPON… YOUR… ENEMIES!”
Dean pressed his lips together before answering, turning his gaze to the shelf. “Well, you were gone. I would’ve gotten one with a little trench coat, but, uh, that’s a little bit too niche of a market.” He looked back at Cas. “And, when we were little, before the demon, we had one in the nursery. Our mom used to tell us that angels were watching over us too.” He smiled, a trace of bitterness on his face. “I don’t think she’d’ve guessed that most of them are dicks. Or that one really would….”
“Nothing.” Sam couldn’t say he felt exactly the same. Yes, Cas was back, and that was great, but it made him think of his mom, trapped in that other world. If Jack could bring Cas back from the Empty, could bring her back too? “I just mean, you’ve been having a rough go, so it’s… it’s good to see you smile.” He smiled tersely at his older brother, hoping that his internal turmoil wasn’t showing. They needed a moment to just sit back and be happy that Cas was back.
He sat up slowly. His head spun, but he could tell that he was on the little knoll above the bunker.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Gabriel.” Then he grimaced, recalling the scene he had left behind. “He decided to introduce Jack to candy.”
Cas nodded, and began to remove his coat. This could get messy. He had hoped never to use Heaven’s interrogation techniques ever again, but right now, they were necessary.
Her thoughts drifted to Lucy, and her time in the apocalypse world. Memories replayed in her mind like a movie reel.
Rage boiled through Cas. “You want truth?” He stood and walked toward the far end of his cell, toward the warded bars. “How about I tell you a few truths about your son?”
Then Lucifer caught on to what Sam was doing. He snarled as Sam pulled the needle out of his neck and jammed the needle into a readied voodoo doll.
“No, I cracked it!” Donatello replied, slapping a sheet of notes onto the table. Dean and Sam crowded around him to look. Cas hung back, bouncing Jack on his hip. His wound was healed now, and he had returned to wearing his formal shirt, although he had left the trench coat off. Some part of Dean wished that the angel would relax a bit when he was in the bunker, just throw on a T-shirt and sweats when he wasn’t off on some mission. Having his jacket on all the time made it seem like he was always waiting to leave.
“Castiel, I’ve been telling John about what a good friend you’ve been to our boys,” Mary said, setting the salad on the table.
Dean shrugged. “All right, well, I got the address. Rowena was right. These girls are not fan favorites.”
The girl was silent for a moment as she thought. “She stays in the mineshaft all winter,” she said, nodding to herself. “But comes out in the spring, because that’s when the village came back and found her body. And on the sunset before the winter sets in, she runs to the bottom of the mountain, to the river, but only very briefly. That was why they didn’t realize they’d left her,” she explained, “because they thought she was fishing in the creek at the bottom of the mountain with her older brother, but he sent her back because she was being troublesome.”
Cas waited for him to finish his coffee, and then to get dressed, nodding to Sam as he left with Jack.
Sam smiled softly as Dean left the kitchen, and turned back to the sleeping baby. Maybe Dean didn’t trust the kid yet, but ‘dad duty’ sounded pretty promising to him.
“If you can’t sleep, I can’t sleep,” it explained, anger flashing through its eyes. “And I like sleep. I need sleep.”
Dean and Cas served up sandwiches to each person, one by one. The first few that Cas made were slightly burnt, but by the time they sat down with their own plates, his sandwiches were the same golden brown as Dean’s. Sam was feeding Jack berries and Cheerios from his plate, and for once ignoring Gabriel as he fed Jack M&Ms. His sandwich sat untouched.
“In here,” Cas ordered, turning sharply into Jack’s nursery. As soon as he stepped inside the sigils’ protective zone, his feet stopped moving without permission.
Sorry for the cliffhanger, things are going to really diverge from canon after this, because a lot of the plot points from now on sort of hinge on Jack being an adult. Also, I'm cutting out some of the dumber small plot lines. It's a challenge to plan.
Dean nodded, his eyes locked on the road. They had a chance at saving their mom. He hadn’t dared hope that it was possible, but now….
“Claire’s gonna need a lot of time,” Jody replied softly, opening the back door of the Impala so Dean could strap Jack into his seat.
Dean tried not to eavesdrop on Missouri’s conversation in the other room. He perked up when she came rushing back around the corner.
“You’re a good father,” Cas said simply, as if that sentence didn’t rock Dean’s entire world. He felt his face flush again.
“I’ll never forget the first time I met him,” she said softly. Dean turned toward her. It felt strange, talking to his mom like this. He supposed this was what having a mother was supposed to be like.
Sam glanced over at Cas. The angel seemed to be thinking the same thing that he was; according to Winchester luck, Jack definitely was not okay.
“A shapeshifting demon?” Cas asked, surprisingly unconcerned with the fact that the Winchesters had been ignorant enough to let Jack get kidnapped within the first week of caring for him.
“Well, we heard about the attack over the wire last night,” Dean explained. “Wondering what you can tell us about the victim.”
Dean made his way into the library, feeling heavy but refreshed. Who knew that sobbing your eyes out to sad music could leave a person feeling so purged clean?
“Okay,” Cas said, letting every ounce of irritation drain into his voice, “how do I save the world?”
Donatello’s study room was dim and messy. How they hadn’t noticed earlier that he was going crazy was beyond Cas.
“You threw away their chance at normal lives! And for what? What? Killing Azazel wouldn’t have brought me back!”
When she pulled into the driveway, Jody was waiting on the porch with her hands on her hips. Shit, had she been away in the Bad Place for that long?
“Oh, we got us one of them,” Sarge replied. “Carl was the one looking in on it.” Cas glanced at Dean. “You think there’s a connection?”
“Hey, Jack, this is Castiel,” Dean said, his voice soft. He gasped lightly as Jack reached toward Cas with one chubby arm. Cas felt as though his heart could burst. Hesitantly, not sure how the child would react, he stepped toward Dean and the baby, and smiled. To his surprise, Jack whined, leaning away from Dean as much as he could.
“I saw it.” Cas walked swiftly over to Jack, who was asleep again. Sam glanced at the door, but Nurse Paguio had shut it behind her.
Cas crept down the hallway with Shaggy and Scooby (what was up with these ridiculous names?). Suddenly, the electricity began to flicker. Great. How Dean had convinced him to go, he couldn’t say.
“I just need a minute,” Rowena whined. “I’m not fleeing, don’t release the hounds.” She stopped a few paces from the car.
But it was far from okay. Cas turned toward Donatello, still strapped to the chair, rage burning through his veins. He could imagine a thousand different ways to make him pay for hurting his family.
Not until he walked into the kitchen to find Cas pacing the kitchen, still holding Jack, and Mary sitting at the table, picking at the label on a beer bottle. He cleared his throat to get their attention.
“He’s checked in as Jack Kline. Hurry.” He hung up, and continued pacing outside the door to Jack’s room. Cas walked up to him, holding a cup of coffee. Sam took it, nodding gratefully, although he figured caffeine would not be the best idea the way his anxiety was acting up. He sipped at it anyway.
“Well,” said Dean, thinking, “last time I dealt with one of these was a really long time ago, but we altered the story so that we could kill it. Bound a made up spirit to the house it was supposedly haunting, then burned it down.” He thought for a moment longer. “Although, looking back, we probably could have just destroyed the symbol.”
The scene in the dungeon was an odd one. Somehow, Gabriel had gotten a hold of bondage materials… but the kinky kind. He walked across the room and took the ball gag out of Donatello’s mouth. The prophet began to speak as though he had been in the middle of a sentence.
Dean cleared his throat, making his way down the stairs. “Anyway, Cas, I got you some changes of clothes.” He dug through the bags until he found the one with Cas’ new clothes.
“Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack... I cared about the whole world because of you.”
“I’m not the kind of girl folks come looking for. In this world, I don’t even rank a milk carton.” She could feel her voice cracking. “No one is going to come for me. I’m not white, rich, blonde. No one’s gonna fight for me. I don’t matter.”
“Uh, Dean, what are you doing with the Black Grimoire?” Sam asked. Something was definitely off. He glanced over at Jack, who was rolling a miniature Impala back and forth across his blanket.
“Look,” Patience shot back, rising to Claire’s challenge, “I gave up a lot to come here, to do what was right, to save you.” Alex was impressed. The new girl could fight when she needed to. “You wanna brush that off? You wanna think I’m fake? Fine. But I am telling you, right now, we’re all in danger.”
“Hey, it’s not like you knew. But hey, I haven’t had a chance to catch up with the world above. I could use a nice conversation, even with Cas- “stick-up-his-ass” -tiel. Last I heard, the Apocalypse had been narrowly averted. What’s happened since?”
The two girls calmed down immediately, and he served their sandwiches. The kitchen was filled with the sound of chattering, giggling children. Dean glanced behind him to see that one of the kids, Jamal, was helping Cas feed Jack. John was scowling, but the children ignored him.
“No, no, don’t worry about it.” Dean sat on the bed next to Cas. He tried to ignore the way his heartbeat sped up incrementally. “How’s he doing?”
“I…” Cas didn’t know whether or not to lie. He knew what Gabriel was capable of, even with diminished grace. That said, Gabriel would certainly be able to tell if Cas lied. “Yes.”
“So,” Claire said loudly, “Sam and Dean– what do we know?” She walked past Jody and sat at the table.
“Dude, he just turned human, let him chill,” Sam chided, sensing Cas’ hesitation to leave the bunker. After Dean kicked him out last time, Sam couldn’t really blame him.
With little more than a thought, he was in the kitchen. Still invisible, he watched as John poured himself a large glass of whiskey and downed it all in one go. Cas waited until he sighed in relief, a sign that the alcohol was taking effect, then healed John, flushing the alcohol from his system. John frowned, poured himself another drink, and downed the glass again. Cas sobered him again. Perhaps he should have let John get drunk, but Heaven did not allow hangovers.
“Cas–” he said, trying to think of how to convince the angel to take it back, undo the deal, anything.
Sam stared at the frozen screen, just feeling sorry for Kelly. She had deserved so much better. She deserved the chance to be a mom for Jack.
Gabriel glared at him, simply snapping his fingers. The bags of groceries disappeared, presumably now sitting on the map table in the main area. John stared at Gabriel with wide eyes.
“Time to go,” Claire announced, turning and running back the way they came. The Winchesters followed closely behind.
Cas set his jaw, and Dean knew that no amount of pleading would change his mind. “I have to save him.” His eyes flared a brilliant blue, and Dean could feel the energy in the air as Cas channeled his grace into the little limp body.
Sarah smiled at them. “You’re my last visitors, I was just about to come and let you know that I’m closing up.”
“Her. She told me to bring it to the market. I have to bring it to her.” Dean took the book and walked swiftly out of the library and back down toward the garage.
“Yeah, we’re hoping to see the doctor,” Sam replied. Dean suppressed the urge to add ‘obviously’ at the end of the sentence.
Dean grimaced. “Right. Right. You, uh, pack up, I’ll go get some coffee. Meet me down there in twenty.” Before he could protest, Dean was out the door.
Well. She remembered the first time she’d met Castiel, how Dean had put himself between the angel and her gun, which couldn’t harm him anyway. She remembered how Castiel had thrown his arms around her son, and Dean’s soft, relieved smile. It seemed a little bit absurd that the two weren’t officially together, but when she had asked Sam about the nature of their relationship, he had simply said that Dean had his head up his ass.
“Whoa, okay, okay,” Dean comforted, bringing him back up to his chest. He sat in the rocking chair by the book shelf and continued to hum to him. He looked up to see Cas watching him with a soft look on his face.
When Jack was done being fed, Sam brought him back to the nursery to sleep in his crib. The little guy was tired all the time, but according to the parenting books and websites, that was normal baby behavior. Human baby behavior.
Dean grinned, and placed a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Don’t tell your dad, he doesn’t know that I did this.”
Dean looked over at Sam, hoping for an explanation. Sam just shot him a dubious look, as though he couldn’t believe Dean didn’t know what fifth base was. Dean thought for a moment. What the hell went beyond penetrative sex? Unless… oh. Okay. Yeah, he knew what fifth base was. Just didn’t know there was a distinction.
Dean hadn’t even gotten out of the car. He was still double and triple checking his grocery list, making sure they would have enough supplies to feed and clothe the infestation of refugee children back at the bunker.
It was morning by the time they stopped. Jody figured that Patience could use a break driving. She sure could, anyway. They pulled into an empty lot behind an abandoned warehouse.
“Turn!” Donatello yelled, pointing to the right. The tires screeched as Dean made the turn. “This is worrisome. I’m sensing a power emanation alongside Jack’s. It gets stronger the closer we get to it.” They passed a sign reading ‘Jasper, Wyoming.’
“Where are you, you bastard?” she screamed. “I’m here! I’m in the Bad Place! Come and get me, you motherfucker!”
He must have felt eyes on the back of his head too, because he and Dean both turned around at the same time. Behind them was a black hooded figure with a spear, much shorter than the both of them.
There was a loud clatter as Dean dropped his spatula and whirled around to look at Sam incredulously. “Rowena?!”
“Morning,” Dean grumbled. Sam grunted in return, not looking up from whatever he was researching. He poured himself a mug of coffee and sat opposite his brother. They sat in silence for a few minutes while Dean’s brain whirred, trying to make sense of what had happened in his sleep. Sure, it may have been a dream, but he had no doubt that it nevertheless was real.
“What the hell happened?” he demanded, glaring at Sam, who was sitting on the couch, head in his hands. “Where’s Jack?”
“Okay,” Sam replied softly, “I’ll take care of it.” He led the way down the stairs, his eyes landing momentarily on Cas’ body, wrapped in a white sheet and sheer yellow curtains, and made his way outside. There was a wood shed behind the house, but he needed large logs as well, so he grabbed an axe that was leaned against the shed, and stalked off toward the treeline. He wondered if Cas had chopped all of that wood.
The girl dropped Dean, and he sank to the floor. Dean watched as her eyes began to bleed. His heart dropped. So this was how he’d die? At the hand of some amateur witch turned attack dog?
“Yes.” Cas sighed. “I had thought she was dead, but it turns out she survived when Metatron stabbed her in the head with a needle.”
“Did you know that he loves hearing stories?” Cas continued, “Fantasy stories, with heroes who crush villains.” He was certain that Jack only loved those stories because Sam made funny voices while reading them, but how would Lucifer know the difference? It’s not like he was ever there for his son.
Maybe Mary just couldn’t stand to see what John had turned her children into. If she could go back in time, she would never have gone into that bedroom.
“Nah, you kick in your sleep,” Dean replied, his eyes closed, “can’t have you accidentally punting the little guy.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed. Hearing the words aloud, he found himself relaxing a bit. He leaned back a bit on the headboard, shifting Jack to lay on his chest. His eyelids drooped, so he closed them.
“Come on!” Patience looked up and saw that Alex had set Jack on the floor and run up one of the branches of stairs, and was attempting to push a large filing cabinet down the stairs. Patience helped her turn it, then shoved it down the main stairway, into the throng of monsters. It caught between the stairs and the ceiling, blocking the way.
That was not the answer Sam was expecting. “What?” The cogs in his brain whirred uselessly. “You’ve been wanting me to admit that since it happened.”
Sam looked up as Dean walked into the room, set down the six pack, and made a beeline for the drawers full of cursed objects and dark spellbooks. He stood, holding a large tome wrapped in white cloth, and set it on the table before removing the cloth.
Rowena turned around, scotch glasses in hand. She shrugged, smirking at Sam. “That said, it took a very long time to heal.” She set one of the glasses in front of Sam with a light thud, then passed the other to Dean. “And I’m not interested in it ever happening again, which is why I need the Black Grimoire.”
The ride to Lebanon was tense and horrible. Jack continued to cry until his voice gave out, at which point he gasped and coughed repeatedly. The sound of him choking on his tears was worse than the crying. Sam pressed his foot into the accelerator, going well over the speed limit, regretting the decision to take him back to Lebanon but not daring to stop anywhere along the way.
Slowly, although he couldn’t explain to himself why he hesitated, he clicked on his lighter, watching the flame for a moment. He threw the lighter onto the gasoline-soaked wood. The flames whooshed as they quickly spread over the logs, enveloping Cas and Kelly. Thick black smoke curled into the sky as the sun rose over the lake. He wondered how the sun could possibly rise on a day like this.
Not just something. She’d just killed. It had been a nest of melodramatic twenty-something year old vampires, all wearing black cloaks and speaking in various foreign accents and hiding out in some once-upon-a-time-bougie abandoned hotel. They’d been picking off homeless folks around Philadelphia.
“I just need a win,” Dean said quietly, “I just need a damn win.” He was tired of losing. Losing friends, losing family, losing battles.
“Sure,” he muttered to himself, “come to Dodge City, we’ll have some laughs.” He groaned as he continued to struggle his way through the damp dirt, breathing in dust and musty air.
“You know,” Mary continued, attempting to cover for her husband, “I thought you were dating when I first met Cas, and I saw how you two acted around each other. Honestly, it’s about time.”
“It’s all good up in the hood,” Gabriel said, holding out his hand. “Archangel Gabriel. And you are?”
Linebacker shoulders? What? “Why do you keep talking about my shoulders?” he asked, distracted for a moment from the hunt.
“They’re people, kind of,” Donatello explained, “sometimes referred to as brothers, other times lands.” He chuckled. “You know how Bibles are, too many damn translations.”
“That’s incredibly traumatic,” Dr. Vallens replied, her voice soft. “Look, Dean, I know you don’t take this seriously, but… it does help to talk about it.”
“I was afraid you might say that,” Rowena replied, turning away. She dropped a large hex bag on the ground, yelled “Manete!” and clicked away across the pavement. Sam’s feet would not move. It appeared that neither would Dean’s.
“The Winchesters are looking to jump between worlds, in search of their mother. We know that they’ll be looking for you.” The woman smiled at Kaia coldly. “Making you the perfect bait.”
Dean ignored him, staring at the article on his computer screen. He’d read the same paragraph at least five times over.
“No,” Sam replied, “and don’t wake him, I could get used to him sleeping in later than four in the morning.”
Besides, Lucifer probably thought he needed her. For a spell, for leverage, something. He knew the devil; he’d spent long enough in the cage with him. He wouldn’t kill Mom until he was certain she was useless to get him back to this Earth.
“Almost,” Donatello replied. Suddenly, something blunt and hard hit him square on the back of the head. He fell to the floor, his vision fuzzy, and watched as Donatello brought a bottle down onto his head.
When Cas opened his eyes, it took him a moment to get his bearings. He inhaled deeply, taking in the bunker’s slightly stale air and the smell of laundry detergent. He knew he wasn’t in his own room: the sheets on his bed weren’t as soft and worn.
“What?” Cas appeared behind Mary, holding Jack, who was watching the scene with a bottle sticking out of his mouth.
Dean grinned, and took Cas’ hand. “This is Cas, my husband. Sam’s back in Kansas, this is a sort of six-month honeymoon.”
He pushed his worries away. No matter what, Dean would be glad to have him back. Right? Jack certainly would.
Gabriel looked away. “He siphoned off my grace and hit up with it like some kind of junkie. Gave his powers an extra boost.”
“Hey Jody.” It was Sam’s voice. “Thanks for your help earlier. So listen, we’re looking for someone named Kaia Nieves. She might be the key to saving Mom. So if you hear anything–”
“There’s no ‘if’ here in this equation, okay?” Lucifer shot back. “Let me just tell you something about my dick brother, about every version of my dick brother, okay? When he decides to do something, he does it. Doesn’t matter what the cost, or who has to die. It is gonna happen, ‘cause that’s just the way he rolls.” Cas reminsced briefly about his near-brush with the Apocalypse. Sounded about right to him.
Sam made his way down the stairs to the morgue in the basement of the funeral home. A pretty woman wearing a black mask and apron and bright red headphones was working with some unidentifiable pink liquid. He glanced around briefly, while her attention was occupied. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary; there was a desk in the corner with a few pictures of the woman and a weather-worn man who looked like he came straight out of one of Dean’s cowboy movies, and a great deal of messy paperwork, but nothing incriminating. He waved to get her attention, and she turned around with a start.
“Oh, I just remember being a young, overly ambitious, wee witch,” Rowena drawled, “And I have to give them some credit.” She turned to Dean. “Outfoxed you, didn’t they?”
“Look,” Sam said, “why don’t you come with us someplace else? We can do this quick and quiet.” Dean knew that he wouldn’t go for that, but he supposed it was worth a shot.
After the eighth hurricane and subsequent explosion, he’d thrown up his hands and put Sam on it. He needed a goddamn drink. Not to mention, the kid liked nothing better than to listen to Dean tell stories, and the only child-appropriate ones he could think of were fairy tales that he could barely remember and the stories about creation that Cas had told him on drunken nights in the lounge downstairs. So, yeah, he was tired and angry and missed his best friend like hell.
“I’m helping people. My patients. I shift into the person they’ve lost so that they can see them one last time, so that they can say goodbye.”
Suddenly, there was the sound of running feet. Sam jumped to his feet, only to see three of the refugee children running through the library, playing some sort of chasing game. They careened past Jack, disappearing around the corner.
He cleared his throat. “Uh, Dad. Just…” he bit his lip. “A few, uh. A few things before we get there.”
Lucifer scoffed, and Cas heard him pacing in his cell. The guard demon stalked toward his cell again, and Cas backed away to sit on his bench again.
“Welcome to my reading room.”  She set the scythe down, far away from Dean. “Know not to leave this lying around near you, don’t we?” she said, her voice awfully flat for someone telling a joke.
All of a sudden, Nurse Paguio and the doctor burst out of Jack’s room. The doctor walked swiftly, but the nurse stayed behind. Sam and Cas stared at her expectantly. She turned to them, and sighed.
Suddenly, one of the creatures leapt on top of the car. Without any further words, Donna shot through the roof, and Jody heard it shriek and jump away. As it turned to attack the car again, it was engulfed in flames. It roared in agony, then fell quiet. Jody and Donna jumped out of the car, ready to tackle the newest threat.
Claire froze for a moment, clearly not expecting that response. Somehow, in that moment, Jody felt that they understood each other.
It replayed the deaths of each and every angel he had killed, every brother and sister whose life had flickered away before his eyes.
“How did you…?” Dean mumbled. How had she known to warn him about the wraith jumping at him? That hallway was not visible from where Patience was tied.
Dean rifled through the books on the shelf, but realized that he wouldn’t be able to focus on anything even if he tried.
All of a sudden, a burst of energy came from the bundle strapped to Sam’s chest. Kaia watched in shock and fear as her kidnappers were blown away, the woman tumbling through a window and the man falling on his blade. His eyes sparked with brilliant white light as he screamed in agony.
Claire nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She listened as Jody left the room to help the rest of the girls with the cleanup efforts. She’d join them in a few minutes. As soon as she could stop the tears.
“No,” Sam replied, “when Lucifer… came through the portal, Mom… she fought him off, but he pulled her through with him.”
“Ach, I’m sure it won’t be an issue. And if it is, we’ll deal with it after you’ve got your mum back, yes?” She shrugged. “It’s already done, so now we just wait for your brother and his angel to get back.”
I went back and rewrote a scene in chapter 7, I highly recommend going back and rereading. It's kind of very important, you'll see why when you read it ;)
Three hours later, she walked though the front door. Jody was in uniform, standing by the kitchen table while Alex pored over the address book.
“I didn’t do shit!” Dean said defensively, “I– Sam, you tell it, you’re the one who gave Jack to fake Donatello.”
Chuck shrugged. “My little assassination attempt didn’t go so well. I didn’t think mother Mary had it in her to kill daddy John.”
I can't guarantee that I'm going to pick this up again, but I will try. I have another big project in the works that I'm only about halfway through writing, but that one I definitely won't publish until it's done. I just wanted to make sure these scenes I had written got published.
Jack grinned mischeviously, reminding Dean that really, he was just a kid. “I won’t.” He snapped his fingers again, and Dean was back in his cabin, a warm apple pie waiting for him.
He had just finished loading the groceries into the backseat when Dean heard a footstep behind him. In a flash, he spun around, gun at the ready.
“It’s the Larson Brothers Shipyard,” Alex announced. Jody glanced over and saw her tapping away at her phone. “Just off Route 14, shut down in ‘08.”
“Mhmm,” Dean mumbled, “And hopefully this fourth Prince of Hell is the last Kardashian in the family.”
Mary bounced Jack gently in her arms as she carried him to his nursery. As soon as they entered the room, he relaxed a bit.
“Except you know that won’t work, or you would’ve done it already.” He hoped he sounded more certain than he felt.
Sam seemed apprehentious. “I-I don’t think we should separate,” he said nervously. “It’ll be easier for Dean and me to keep you safe if we’re all together.”
The kitchen fell silent again, except for the pans sizzling on the stove with the sandwiches Dean was making.
“I don’t know,” Cas mumbled. All he knew was that he had to get out of here. Back to Dean, and Sam, and Kelly. How long had he been gone? Had Lucifer killed the Winchesters? Had Jack been born? Was he good, or had he gone dark side as Dean had so vehemently warned him?
Dean didn’t want to know what the hell that meant, nor how she knew that Jack was a nephilim. “This is Jack. Kelly Kline’s kid.”
Dean stared at Sam, trying to find the words for how he felt. But he could never figure that out, even on a good day, so he did what he usually did– deflected. “Right now, I wanna kill some dead guy’s dead wife.”
But Sam could not stop cackling. He grabbed a spoon and a yogurt cup and made to leave the kitchen before his brother remembered that they kept knives in the kitchen.
In the center of the room was the undertaker, Athena, tied to a chair and gagged. She tried to cry out, but it was muffled by the handkerchief in her mouth.
Mary looked at him like she’d only just noticed he was there. “Oh, I picked it up in the other world. Kind of had to.” She shrugged, and disappeared back into the hallway.
Chuck grinned. “Yes, Sammy. A token of faith.” He pulled his hand out of his pocket, a knife suddenly appearing out of thin air. “A sacrifice.”
The demon stopped in front of Cas’ cell. “Don’t think we forgot about you,” they teased. Cas glared at them. “When the boss gets back, big plans for you.”
“No, today is good,” Dean retorted irrately. “Like right now.” He hoped he still looked intimidating with a baby strapped to his chest, but that seemed unlikely.
“I’ll keep an eye on her,” Sam offered. He figured Dean and Rowena would kill each other if left alone in the car, regardless of whether or not Jack was napping in there with them.
When the water ran clear, he dried his hands and walked back into the bedroom. To his surprise, Cas was already trying to sit up.
Dean swallowed thickly, trying to keep himself from crying, breaking down, sobbing, screaming at God and the universe and everything that had led to this, and threw the sheet back over the angel’s face. He turned away, and his gaze landed on the yellow curtains in the window. As if on autopilot, Dean reached up and pulled the curtains from the window frame, ripped them into strips, and began tying the sheet around Cas’ feet. He faltered as he pulled the knot tight, and for a moment he just leaned against the table, clenching his eyes shut, trying not to break.
She then turned to her sister and began attacking her. The younger sister did the same, and they both fell to the floor, bleeding from multiple wounds.
“If this is about me hunting alone,” she continued, determined to shut down an argument before it happened, “I know I should have called more, but–” Jody tried to speak, but Claire raised her voice “–I’m fine. I’m good. I’m safe.”
Claire glanced between the two of them, but decided not to ask. Alex stood and made to leave the room.
“Sleep is what you need. I’m checking in, you deal with Jack.” Sam opened the door before the Impala had even come to a full stop, and marched inside. When he had a key, Dean walked in with a still-crying Jack in his car seat carrier.
No. Cas was dead. They were all dead or otherwise unavailable. Was he Jack’s father? He sure was playing the part. He thought of the little dude in the bumblebee onesie, staring up at him through the folds of a blanket.
“He went downstairs with Rowena,” replied Cas, appearing from the hallway. He stopped when he saw John.
“Everything I am telling you is true,” Lucifer whispered urgently. “You were there, man. You saw what that place was like.” Cas glanced around the bar, scoping out the exits in case things went bad. “The Michael I just described to you is responsible for that.” This other Michael did sound terrible, but Cas was honestly more concerned with maintaining his living state. So long as that Michael stayed in the other world, they had nothing to worry about.
This was just a ploy for Lucifer to get under his skin. “Stop,” Cas growled, “I don’t want to hear any more of your lies.” What was he thinking, trying to get under Lucifer’s skin like this? He should have known that he would only try to get back at him.
“Oh, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,” Lucifer taunted, grabbing Sam’s hair in his hand and pulling his face up until he was forced to look into those hellfire red eyes. “We’re going to have such a good time. I’m all powered up on nephilim grace; now that I hold the power of Hell, I’m going to have some fun with it. And I want you to see. I want you to watch as I bring the world to its knees.”
“Awww, Sammy, am I really so ugly that you want to kill yourself?” Lucifer taunted. He laughed maliciously. “I always figured that only a Winchester could take out a Winchester for good.”
Patience sighed. “This is just… all way too freaky. I mean, your mom’s out burying a monster in the backyard.”
He glanced at Jack, sleeping in the backseat. As much as he hated the idea of using the kid’s pain as a tool, he knew it was the only way to get Mom back.
Sarah shrugged. “Yeah, I wanted something on campus.” She glanced over at Cas. “Who’s this? And where’s your brother?”
“Jesus Christ.” So the Apocalypse World had a Kevin Tran, one that helped Lucifer return to this planet. Great. Dean grabbed a chair from the desk and sank onto it. He could already feel exhaustion creeping into his bones. “When was this?”
Sam bristled. “His name is Jack. And he’s our kid, and we’re going to raise him however we see fit.”
Cas sighed, but put it on anyway. Dean grinned at him, and led the way out to the parking lot. Though Cas wanted to be irritated at Dean for his antics, he found it somewhat endearing. With everything going on, it wasn’t so hard to just wear a hat for him. Even if it was a terrible hat. They listened to the radio in companionable silence until Dean pulled up to the crime scene.
Dean made to protest, but Cas interrupted. “Your brother makes an excellent point.” Dean slammed his mouth shut and noisily set the breakfast items he’d cooked out on the table. Gabriel piled a plate with eggs, then procured a bottle of maple syrup from somewhere and drowned his eggs in it. Sam grimaced.
‘But the thing that killed Kaia is still out there. And I don’t care if I have to tear another hole in the universe. We’re going to find it. And I’m going to kill it.’
When Dean finally quieted down and got to unpacking his own clothes, he turned to his older brother. “Still can’t believe you brought your own hat,” he teased.
“Here.” Cas sidled up behind Dean and reached his hand over his shoulder to brush his hand against Jack’s face. With a faint ringing of grace, the candy mess was gone. He laid the hand on Dean’s shoulder for a moment as he retracted his arm, sending small shivers through the hunter’s body.
Donatello wheezed with laughter. “I don’t wanna fight it. I….” He frowned at Dean. “You’re supposed to be dead.”
“He’s somewhere in the bunker, I’m not sure where,” Sam said. Mary nodded, glancing around at the other members of the room. She frowned when she saw Rowena.
“Great,” Sam replied, the severity of the situation returning to him, “so we’re stuck in a cartoon with a talking dog.” And Gabriel is currently babysitting Jack, and Mom is in an Apocalyptic timeline, and Lucifer is on the loose.
“So, looks like you guys are celebrating something,” Dean said, gesturing to the collection of half-empty glasses.
She heard Jody yell for Alex and Patience to get their asses downstairs before her mother figure was on top of them, taking some of Kaia’s weight off of Claire’s shoulders and helping carry her into the house. They set her down on the couch, and Claire went into the kitchen, filling a glass with water and grabbing a granola bar out of the snack cabinet. Kaia gulped down the water quickly, gasping for air when she was finished. Then she burst into tears. Claire dropped down onto the couch beside her and wrapped her arm around the girl’s bony shoulders. She watched silently as Jody herded Alex and Patience back out of the living room.
Sam pushed past his brother to see that the room was empty. The window was open, letting in a cold draft. Sam walked over to the bed with the messed up sheets, and paused. There on the side table was a sketchbook that Kaia must have forgotten in her haste to escape.
Cas wouldn’t look at Dean. “A little bit of… reprogramming, I guess you could call it. Trying to set me back to default settings.”
Sam glared at Dean. “A demon posed as Donatello, and kidnapped Jack,” he admitted. “But, I mean, he’s fine now, and whatever it was he was trying to release from the pit didn’t make it topside, so….”
“I came here to tell Jody about my vision, and Claire just blew it off. And I am not a fighter. I can’t even imagine going up against one of those… things.”
The monsters were rushing up the narrow stairway. It should have been like shooting fish in a barrel, but they would not fall.
Claire stalked down the hallway and stopped by the window of the closest room. She looked inside to see the girl, Kaia, being tended to by a nurse. To her surprise, she was clutching a baby to her chest. Odd. Jody hadn’t mentioned a baby.
“And,” Dean continued, “since you speak God, we figured it was right up your alley. So, give it a swing.”
“It doesn’t matter if we die. Scooby-Doo could die!” Sam gawked at his brother. Was the dude going insane? “That’s not happening, not on my watch! I’d take a bullet for that dog.” Before Sam could respond, Dean turned and left the room. Sam followed him into the large and now rather creepy sitting room.
“Triple-cross, actually.” Dean didn’t want to do the math on that. “So I ended up on your side, and we defeated the villains, just as I planned.”
“For a little while,” Cas said. His mind was still on the Empty. He knew what he had to do. He had just hoped for more time.
Cas sighed. Unfortunately, the devil had a point. “Well, I have to talk to Sam and Dean.” Not to mention, he would not take Lucifer to Jack unless it was absolutely necessary.
“Yeah, well, uh… Fergus… uh, Crowley, um… had changed a lot,” Sam replied. “You’d have been proud of him.” Dean doubted that greatly.
“You’re my true vessel.” Lucifer grinned, crouching down and reaching out a hand to caress Sam’s face. He fought the urge to vomit. “You’re mine.”
Rowena smiled bitterly. “Samuel, I don’t think you understand.” She inhaled deeply. “I would not survive the spell needed to kill Lucifer.”
For a long moment, the only sound in the kitchen was the still-sizzling bacon. Cas genuinely considered smiting Dean on the spot for a long moment.
The sun had set by the time Dean pulled up to the cemetery. He was worried about Jack, but he pushed it to the back of his mind for the time being. Right now, he needed to take care of this ghoul. Nursing a sick child was not his forte– killing, though, that was.
“All right, well, Mom was great, now she’s dead,” Dean said quickly. “Now, what’s the deal with catharsis?”
“Cas is on other business.” It wasn’t really a lie, so Dean figured he could get away with it. “So, where’s this door?”
James set his jaw. “So we run. We can work all of this out later. But right now, get your things. We need to go.”
Mary shifted uncomfortably. “Someone needed to step in and take care of the orphans. They needed me, and at the time, I needed them.” She inhaled deeply. “Actually, when we move them to Bobby’s place, I’m going with them.”
Gabriel scowled. “You could put it that way.” He rooted around the bag of trail mix for a moment longer, then set it back on the table.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, a lot of the stuff we have on nephilim is either wrong, incomplete, or written in dead languages.” Cas replaced the book on the shelf as Sam scrolled through his news feeds in search of a case.
“We should probably get you some toys and stuffed animals, huh?” Sam said softly. Jack just stared at him. “Let’s see, we’ll get you some cars, and blocks, and a teddy bear.” He smiled gently. “Maybe we’ll get you a little angel to watch over you in your sleep.” He knew it was silly to think that angels really kept children safe as they slept, but Kelly’s words echoed through his head. ‘There’s an angel watching over you.’
“Aw, please.” Asmodeus flicked his finger, and both Lucifer and Cas flew backward, slamming into the bar.
“It’s not different, and you know it.” Cas gave him a stern look. “I saw your memories when I raised you from Hell. I know what he’s done to you.” Dean opened his mouth to argue, then shut it again, knowing that Cas was right. But his not arguing didn’t change the fact that Cas’ abuser was walking around Heaven to bump into him at any time, and that did not sit well with Dean at all.
Cas shrugged. “Sounds like it was about the same time that we went to the apocalyptic world, so I imagine it was an overstretch of Rowena’s spell. Based on the origins of her spellwork, if Claire was praying for that exact thing to happen at that exact moment, and the witch were powerful enough, it would appear before her.”
Regardless, it hurt to see her caring for them the way that she never cared for him or Sam. Now that he had Jack to think of, he understood better why she worked with the British Men of Letters. Their promise of a monster-free world was too attractive to ignore. Dean wished he could do the same for Jack.
The ex-angel chuckled softly. “You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell... Knowing you has changed me.”
Cas fidgeted with the hem of his coat. “I, ah. Used all of my grace to save Jack, after Lucifer took his grace. So… now I’m human.”
“Why don’t you come meet him?” Dean gestured to the car, and Cas got in, settling on the passenger’s seat. Dean turned the key in the ignition, and the engine roared to life. He turned on the radio, and a Led Zeppelin song wafted through the car. It was one of the songs on Cas’ mixtape. He turned to see Cas smiling at him. He quirked his lip upward in return, then put the car in drive.
“Anyway,” Dean continued, “after that, we packed up some things from the house and brought Jack here. It’s not as kid friendly, but it’s safer here.”
Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean. “Dean, I am not going through this fight again. I will not apologize for saving you.”
Dean drove the both of them to a tourist lodge built to look like a log cabin. They checked in and headed to their room.
“We’re not half bad at parenting,” Dean retorted, “And besides, you’re one to talk. Crowley had some choice things to say about your parenting style.”
That’s when John and Mary entered the kitchen. The two of them were tense, but John’s shoulders relaxed when he saw Sam.
“In the process of reassembling his soul and body, I became very familiar with the his memories, especially the ones that scarred his soul,” Cas continued, staring John down, “I had to differentiate between the ones that had been inflicted upon him by Alastair, and the ones inflicted upon him… prior to his time below.” John’s face went pale. “So I hope you understand why I am about to do this.”
Jack gurgled at him, and looked at him almost expectantly. He recalled that Dean usually sang him to sleep.
“The hell there were!” As if sent from Chuck himself, a motel sign flashed from the next exit. “Take the damn exit or so help me I will take the wheel!” Dean scoffed, but followed Sam’s directions. Jack continued to wail from the back seat.
Dean barely processed what he was doing as they herded the kids into the van and put Bobby’s address into Mary’s phone. He strapped Jack’s carseat into the seat directly behind Mary, and stood back while Cas strapped him in.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, his voice soft but heavy with emotion, “I was the one in the wrong.” Cas glanced up at Dean. Remorse was written all over his face. It shocked Cas to see him showing this much outward emotion. “I should have had faith in you, but I just couldn’t believe that this kid could be anything but his father.” He stopped in front of a door that was once a guest bedroom, and fell silent for a moment. Cas waited for him to continue. “Now that he’s here, I… I see how wrong I was. He’s just a kid.” He chuckled. “A kid who blows up lightbulbs when he gets too upset, but a kid nonetheless.”
“We’re screwed.” Dean was back, carrying another duffel and one of those strange blades. “There’s too damn many of them!”
“Dead guy in Madison,” Dean explained, “police say it was a home invasion, but neighbor claims that she saw the vic’s dead wife leave the crime scene.”
Gabriel scoffed, and tossed a handful of Skittles into his mouth. Where he had procured them from, Sam had no idea. “Well, you know how I like shiny things. I’ve got the Seal of Solomon stashed away in one of my old hideouts.”
Dean nodded, then gently transferred the baby to Sam’s arms. The baby made a noise, as if it were about to start crying again, but Sam bounced it gently, copying what Dean had been doing, and it calmed down, eyes sliding closed.
Donna pulled up closer, having seen no other monsters, and they made their way inside the large derelict ship, metal walkway clanking beneath them.
“Okay, well if you’re not doing this, then who is?” Sam asked, still pointing his gun at Dr. Vallens.
In a split second, Mather pulled out a revolver, but Sam and Dean were too quick; both brothers shot at the ghoul, and he fell back against a minivan as a slug hit him in the shoulder. However, he was mostly unharmed, and ran around the car, firing his pistol as Sam and Dean ducked behind a crappy old Honda. It was a real shootout, no movie magic involved, and it was decidedly less fun than in the westerns Dean enjoyed so much. Sam and Dean took turns firing at Mather over the top of the car, glass shattering as Dave shot out the windows. They heard him whoop excitedly as he fired off multiple rounds in a row. Dean went to shoot again, but the gun just clicked with a hollow noise. He glanced at Sam, but his brother shook his head.
Wordlessly, Cas led the way down the hall and up through a door. Gabriel followed him, helpless in his straightjacket. The door opened up onto Earth, onto the front porch of some abandoned building. Always with the abandoned buildings.
Dean realized that he was crying. He straightened up and wiped the tears from his face, then turned and left the room. He had to take care of Jack now. He could think about this later. But the guilt inside him spread like poison, filling his veins and boiling his blood.
Sarah glanced at them skeptically. “It’s a hell of a hike, you’re not going to make it to where we saw her before sundown.”
“I’m…” Cas paused, remembering what had happened last time he’d been turned human. Dean wouldn’t send him away again, would he? His heart began to race. He couldn’t leave Jack behind. Dean couldn’t send him away again, not now that they were raising Jack, and with Lucifer on the loose, and with Chuck after them….
The archangel scowled. “I spent a very fun near-decade hopping casinos before he got to me, I’ll have you know.”
He frowned. Sam and Eileen weren’t due back for another two days, and besides, Sam had a key. Mary sometimes dropped by without notice, but never as late as– Dean glanced at the clock on the stove– 3:07.
Before Patience could ask a single one of the hundred questions swirling through her head, a high pitched growl sounded behind Donna.
Her boys had certainly formed their own little ragtag family, though. She liked Eileen a lot already. She was fierce, but kind, and she could see that Sam loved her very much. Gabriel was quite the character, and maybe not the best influence on Jack, but he had his nephew’s best interests at heart. Rowena was mysterious, but seemed to have taken on a mentoring role for Sam, and she appreciated that.
“Well, she… felt that I had become estranged from Heaven, so she…” he tilted his head from side to side, trying to come up with the right word, “reformed me. So that I would follow her orders.”
The sound of car doors slamming outside caught the man’s attention. Sam. He glanced out the window, and grinned.
Dean shook his head angrily. “Do you ever have any good news?” he quipped. “Well, see if there’s anything in Jasper that’s demon-y.”
“Looks like the victim was covered in bite marks,” Sam continued. Dean grunted and sat on the couch, his shoulders hunched as though he were wrapping his entire body around his coffee mug. Jack whined, signaling that he was done eating, and Cas set the bottle on the table and took a pacifier from his pocket. “I guess I’ll take Jack and check out the cemetery so you and Cas can hit up the crime scene.” He closed his laptop with a thud, and took Jack into the bedroom to get dressed.
Another creature leapt directly at Patience. She shrieked and squeezed the trigger, and it fell to the ground, limp.
Sam bounded up the stairs of the house, heart racing. The images of Cas’ eyes flashing out, of his mother being pulled through the portal, of Lucifer’s grotesque smile all flashed through his mind. He stopped when he saw Kelly lying on the bed, still as stone. Slowly, he walked over to the bedside, and gently closed her eyes.
“Let me get this straight,” Sam interjected, “you felt the book moving and you decided, what? You’d show up and just take it?”
“He is half angel. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but without enough angels to spare to negotiate with me….”
Dean had finally gotten used to being in Heaven. He’d wake up next to Cas, try to sneak out of bed without waking him up (he always failed), make breakfast, and then he and Cas would drive around all day, visiting friends, pulling over at viewpoints that always seemed to match exactly what he was in the mood to see, going fishing, drinking beer from a cooler in the backseat that never seemed to run out of ice or beverages or snacks, then return to their cabin in the woods and make dinner and watch old westerns and head to bed. Always the same, always perfect. A lot of the time, the two of them wouldn’t even talk, but just revel in each others’ company.
Lucifer screamed again, light streaming from every eye in his form. Sam could feel the blood vessels in his eyes popping, but he couldn’t look away. His eardrums felt just about ready to burst. Suddenly, someone blocked his view, shadows of wings obscuring the scene before him. In the blink of an eye, he found himself on the floor of the library. His head and ears throbbed in the sudden silence, and he blacked out.
“Hey, Sam.” His half brother did not look pleased to be in his company. “Michael’s here too, just letting me be the social one.” He gestured to his head.
“How are you alive?” Dean asked, content to oblige her for now. Though he did not like the sight of an enemy-turned-reluctant-ally making herself so at home in their library.
Jack turned to look at Naomi, pondering for a moment. Then he snapped his fingers, and she was gone.
“Good.” He suddenly realized that he hadn’t even opened his beer. Touchy feely crap without the help of alcohol? That was new.
“This is Jack,” Sam replied, scooping up the baby, who maybe was not as helpless and human as he had originally thought. “Jack is a nephilim.”
Oddly enough, Sam did not fear this new development. At least, he didn’t fear that Rowena would intentionally cause problems for him.
“Oh, yes,” Donatello rasped mystically, “According to the tablet, they were ancient warriors who enslaved half the Fertile Crescent, until some priests cast a spell on them to bind them in ‘a place without a place and a time without a time.’”
The first bite was incredible. Cas moaned happily. In his time as a human prior, he hadn’t had any home-cooked meals. He looked over at Dean to compliment him, only to find that the hunter’s face had gone tomato-red.
“You raised me to do what’s right,” she said slowly, “and this is what’s right. If I don’t go, people will die.” Her heart hammered in her chest. She had never defied her father like this, but she knew that it was necessary. Jody and Dean were in danger.
“We got run off the road,” Kaia continued. “We pulled into an abandoned boatyard. I didn’t see a sign.”
Dean felt his neck heat up. He didn’t remember anything from the moment some blonde tried to flirt with him at the grocery store to waking up with his arm clenched around Sam’s throat.
Cas was laying there with his eyes closed, shivering slightly in the cold room. His wound was red and raw, and there was a trickle of blood snaking down onto the blanket. Dean took the already bloody washcloth from a bowl of pink stained water sitting on the floor next to the bed and wiped up the blood. Then he took a bandage, ripped open the package, and pressed it to the wound. Cas hissed with pain.
“Growing up with her, she was always on the road, hunting!” James tried to explain, his voice taught. Dean looked away. He knew exactly what James had gone through. “I spent my entire childhood terrified of monsters, of– of losing her!” His voice became soft. “I didn’t want that life for you. I… I didn’t want her encouraging–”
“Hell no,” Dean said, much too quickly. No way was he taking his little brother into that apocalyptic wasteland again. If it were up to him, he wouldn’t be taking Cas either, but neither Sam nor Cas would ever in a million years agree to him going alone. So, the guy with superpowers it was. “Jack needs a chaperone, and I don’t trust the witch or the trickster.”
“No,” Cas whispered, then inhaled sharply as the blade bit into his throat. He could feel his grace welling up at the spot.
“Dean, I… before I….” He swallowed thickly. Despite how things had worked out, he couldn’t bring himself to say the word. “I made some mistakes, hid things from you, and I–”
Jody didn’t have time to answer before a loud thud in the room upstairs caught their attention. Patience hoisted Jack under her arm and the four women raced upstairs toward the source of the noise. Jack shrieked with laughter, as though this were a game. Patience hoped the Winchesters wouldn’t be angry with them for bringing Jack on a hunt.
Cas let out a breathless laugh. “He does, doesn’t he?” He started as a plate clattered onto the table. Dean had laden his plate with eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.
“Just come into the kitchen,” Sam interjected before Dean could respond in his usual aggressive fashion. She followed the brothers into the mess of breakfasttime.
They went on a few short and leisurely hikes in the Savage River area before deciding to call it a day and heading back to the tourist trap village for some food.
Sam exhaled softly with laughter, but decided not to make fun of the fact that Dean just referenced the Kardashians. He turned back to the lore book in his hands. “According to this, if that was Asmodeus, it’s the end of the line.”
Sam turned back to his books. He could see why Dean was so unnerved. Mary had made it clear that she was not the apple pie mother figure that he had been missing all his life, only to now be acting mother to all these other children. He didn’t harbor the same sort of resentment that Dean did towards their mom for making that deal and dying because of it, but… it certainly did rub him the wrong way, at least on Dean’s behalf.
Shaking slightly, he donned his trench coat and slipped his feet into his shoes. He should probably get new ones: these were extremely uncomfortable dress shoes. He slowly shuffled out of the room and down the hall. Jack’s door was open, and the room was empty, so Cas moved on to the kitchen.
He swung the angel blade, but Naomi was ready with her own blade. The clash rang through Dean’s ears, but he barreled forward anyway, letting his rage fuel him. He slammed her into the wall with the light paneling, shattering the glass. She yelled with rage as he twisted her sword arm, causing her to drop her blade. It clattered to the floor as Dean grabbed her throat. Using the blunt end of the blade, since his fists would not work on an angel, he pounded at her face, leaving angry red and purple bruises and giving her a bloody nose.
A voice drifted down the hall. Vaguely, he recognized it as his own. But not his own, because he was sitting in a cell down a hallway from where the voice was.
It was probably only seconds that Sam waited for Lucifer to appear, but it felt like hours. His heart pounded in his ears. Rowena sat upon the throne, a stony expression set in her face.
“Order for Sarah!” called the server from behind the counter. Sarah turned away and grabbed three drinks.
“I just… wish I could tell him… things. I…” she sniffed, and Dean turned to look at her. There were tears running down her face. “I still hate him, sometimes. For taking my dad. But… he was trying so hard to be there for me. And I loved him for that.”
That’s when he heard the crying. It was coming from the next room over, the nursery. He crept warily into the dark room with the alphabet painted on the walls. In the cradle, wrapped in a white blanket, was a squalling newborn.
“Y-yeah.” He decided not to explain that Azazel wasn’t the only one. “Um… we’ll go into more detail later, but… Mom’s back.”
All of a sudden, the bunker door opened and slammed closed. Sam dropped his spoon and yogurt and rushed to the entrance, pulling his gun out of his waistband. Dean followed close behind.
“What a coincidence,” Dean quipped, leaving the glass on the table. Jack reached for the glass, and Dean pushed it away and rolled one of his Hot Wheels into reach. “You show up right when it gets stolen.”
Dean didn’t know how long he’d been sitting there, staring at the blue fabric on the walls. He couldn’t bring himself to move. He knew he needed to. He needed to get Sam out of Hell, and figure out what Chuck had done with Eileen, and make sure Jack was safe.
“Great,” Sam replied, “thanks. Again, sorry.” She shrugged and put her headphones back on as Sam left. He went back to the car, where he had left Jack sleeping in the back seat. He knew that if Dean and Cas found out about that, they’d be beyond pissed, but he couldn’t just bring a baby into a morgue. Besides, he’d left the air conditioning on, and he was asleep.
“All right, then. Uh, aim for the head.” He turned and led the way through the cemetery, flashlights and guns held out in front of them. They wove between headstones, searching in the dark for any sort of movement.
“Oh ho!” Dean chuckled loudly, “the Wild Bill suite.” If Sam hadn’t been taken so aback by the room, he might have appreciated Dean’s wide grin a bit more.
Gabriel shoved the ball gag back into his mouth and shrugged. “I don’t know how useful he still is in this state, but I figured you’d be pissed if I hurt him, so….” He clapped his hands together. “I’m going to go watch Scooby Doo.” He looked over at Cas, and held out his arms. “Quality uncle-nephew time?”
Claire tossed and turned. She couldn’t sleep. She had so much on her mind that she needed to get out. She sat up and pulled her hunting journal from the bag sitting next to her on the floor. She began to write.
Dean waited out front of the bank while Sam moved around to the side. A man with a black cowboy hat and a red bandana over his face exited the bank, a black duffel bag in hand.
He cocked one side of his mouth upwards in a smile, swallowing before answering. “The kid is a menace. He’s just discovered that he has powers, but has no idea how to control them.” Cas frowned. “I mean, the kid will get excited, and when that happens, he’ll make a stuffed animal or whatever fly around, which gets him even more excited, and then it’s hurricane Jack.” He chuckled. “This is, until he blows the light bulbs out in his room. We had to change them seven– no, eight times this week.” Cas scoffed quietly, looking down at the table. “But other than that, the kid is normal. Just starting to crawl around, which means we’re really going to have to babyproof soon. That’s going to be a nightmare in and of itself. And it does no good if it turns out the little dude can fly.” He pushed the thought out of his mind; tonight was for celebrating Cas’ return. Parenting could wait until the morning. Or, at least, until Jack woke up again.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean replied, not really paying attention as he stared at his phone. He could have Sam drive if he needed him to. On the screen he had pulled up a text thread with Cas, scrolled up to their conversations prior to when Cas ran off with Kelly. His chest ached at the various obscure emojis that Cas had sent. Who knew that there was a beaver emoji?
Sam sighed. “Look….” He paused. Maybe this wasn’t the best time to dive into this, but it needed to be addressed. “Losing Mom and Cas, that’s a lot to process, Dean. Especially on no sleep.”
“Not just any talking dog,” Dean protested, “the talking dog. The greatest talking dog in history! Now come on!” He began to make his way across the diner, towards the Gang, then turned briefly back to Sam. “Dibs on Daphne.”
The Devil’s eyes flared wicked red, and he inhaled deeply. A strangled cry wrested its way out of Jack as a glowing cloud of golden grace flowed out of his mouth.
“You’ve lost someone recently?” came a voice from behind them. Dean turned to see a woman standing on the stairs. The doctor.
“Rowena MacLeod.” She tossed a lock of flaming hair over her shoulder. “I heard that you died years ago.”
“Okay, so what do we know, besides all work and no play makes Donatello a homicidal boy?” Dean said, half heartedly digging through the papers of scribbled notes spread across the table.
“Go,” Claire urged. She didn’t look particularly happy, but it still shocked Jody to no end that she wasn’t trying to fight her on this.
Cas remained silent. Lucifer was impatient, if nothing else. The Winchesters would get him out. Although, maybe that was Asmodeus’ plan. The thought soured his mouth.
“Well, Kevin translated it,” Dean added, “and it was hard on him, sure, but he never went full psycho.”
Patience set Jack on a ratty old desk, and they formed a semicircle around him. She let out a shaky breath.
Sam grabbed his phone out of his pocket, and checked the screen to see who was calling him. “Dean,” he said as soon as he answered.
He could use a distraction from the current situation. “Sure, actually, might as well teach you how to make grilled cheese.”
Cas paused a moment, realizing that he hadn’t come up with a cover story. “A, uh, little kid. With, uh, cancer. Healed him up so that he can grow up and become a singer.”
Jody stared at her in disbelief. Claire couldn’t take this. She didn’t want to. She began to walk out the door.
“You know, in theory, you should be able to fly up there,” he said to Jack. Jack gurgled happily around his pacifier in return.
Dean hung up, then turned to Dr. Vallens again. “Is there somewhere I can put him down to nap?” He asked.
“Okay, I get it, I get it,” Lucifer chided. “Custody of my son is a non-starter. But if you can please just shelve the eternal enemies thing for a second, we have a situation.” Cas narrowed his eyes. “And by ‘we,’ I mean everything alive. We’re sorta...” Lucifer sighed, “all gonna die.” He shrugged in a manner that was probably supposed to appear helpless.
Donatello arrived the next day. Sam opened the bunker door for him, splashing a little bit of holy water on his sleeve as he entered. The prophet did not react.
Honestly, she wasn’t sure why she ever loved John to begin with. He was safe, he was normal, he was so different from the life she’d known, but she could have had that same life with someone else. Anyone else.
“Good,” she breathed. “Now get behind that pillar. When I start to chant over my bowl, you light a match and recite your part.”
Charlie scoffed, but didn’t lower her gun. “Oddly enough, that’s not the first time I’ve heard that story.”
“Agent Elliot,” he replied, taking his FBI badge from his inside pocket, “I’m here about the grave robbery. Uh, you live on the premises, right?”
Dean raced down the hallway of the high school, gun at the ready and Jody right behind him. As soon as he turned the corner and saw the wraith pinning some teenage girl– Patience– to the floor, he took the shot. He knew it wouldn’t take the monster out, but the man yelled and ran, leaving the girl gasping on the floor. Dean tore after him, figuring that Jody would make sure Patience was alright. The wraith grabbed a mop before tearing out the double doors, then slid it into the handles so that Dean was barred inside. He smirked at Dean through the window before running away.
Claire turned too late. Kaia pushed her to the ground, and Claire heard the all-too-familiar sound of a blade sinking into flesh. Kaia fell beside her. Her face was blank, in shock with pain. A large double-bladed spear protruded from her stomach.
“Well, whatever it was, it’s gone now,” the blond man said, running his hands along the walls in search of said hidden door. He turned to a door. “It looked like it was coming out of here.” He pushed the door open with a creak.
“No, Gloria was on the phone with roadside assistance when she died. Operator said she was talking to someone named Scotty.”
“You must be the hunter,” Mathers commented, pointing to Dean. He seemed completely unfazed by the shotgun. Which made sense, since ghouls could only be killed by a clean headshot.
“He’s a baby, Sam, of course he didn’t mean to!” Dean sighed. “I guess we have an idea of how powerful he is, though. And he’s only going to get more powerful.”
Claire paused before answering. “Yeah.” No reason to lie. Besides, she trusted Kaia. “Jody always said I’d get myself killed. Hunting. And I’d be like, ‘good.’ I’m gonna go out, then that’s how I wanna do it, doing something great.” She looked back over at the other two girls and the baby. “But Patience’s vision… it’s one thing thinking that you’re gonna die. But actually knowing it?” She looked back over at Kaia. “For once, a part of me kinda just wants to sit back and let Jody handle it, you know? Stay safe.”
“Bon appetit,” Dean said, sitting on the seat next to Cas’. Cas took his seat, and Mary went to go serve herself a plate.
A burst of courage allowed her to turn around and face her dad. “I see things before they happen. Usually small things– a conversation, what someone will be wearing the next day. But Dad, this is someone’s life. I can’t sit here and do nothing. I can’t.” She straightened up.
“If that’s the case, then that’s one Winchester less on this planet.” Dean opened his mouth again, but Billie interrupted him. “However, should you boys find a way to bring him back, I will not take him back.”
Adam glanced at Dean, looking unimpressed. Sam couldn’t blame him, after they’d left him in the Cage for so long. “What’s wrong with him?”
“So your orders were to fall in order to serve this Righteous Man?” Castiel asked, stopping in his tracks.
“Okay, okay,” Sam sputtered as they tucked their guns into their waistbands, “So– so who’s got Jack? And who– or what– did I give him to? A shifter?”
“Not yet,” Dean grumbled. Sam hoped that he heard a note of kindness in his voice. After hearing Dean sing to the kid, he couldn’t imagine that he would turn around and suddenly decide to loathe him. But Dean was stubborn; even if he had changed his mind yesterday, when his grief for Cas was fresh, he could change his mind back today, decide that this child was, in fact, a monster that the world needed gone.
“Alright, so, three days ago, a vintage pocket watch with a personalized inscription was sold at auction, but when they went to authenticate it, they discovered that it had been buried with its original owner, who had died twenty years previously.
