They’ve got two more games in the following week in the Southern California area, then take a bus to Arizona for a game, and lastly fly to Texas for one more exhibition match before returning home for real league play to begin come April. After an entire pre-season of not getting any in-game action, Natasha finally allows Steve to grace the starting line-up again for their last few games. He naturally falls back into the rhythm of playing, still starting off easy, only playing a few innings here and there.
Steve doesn't speak again until Tony shuts off the machine and peels out all his newly made propellers, shoving the scrap material into a heap on the ground. Tony opens a few cabinets before he finds a large vat of clear liquid. He sets it down on a large Bunsen burner and turns it on, plopping down all his propellers. "A polycaprolactone solvent. It'll help seal and expand the composite."
Steve just hums in reply, twirling spaghetti noodles around in the sauce before shoving a forkful into his mouth. They eat in silence for the next few minutes. Tony can feel the apprehensiveness, thick and cloying in the air between them.
“Right,” Tony nods, a bit of disappointment there. He’s happy to see Rhodey and the rest of the team, but he really had been hoping he could convince the introverted man to try and hit the town with him after the game. That was sure to lead to trouble, and Tony did love getting himself into (and out of) sticky situations.
His last pitch is a Sinker, a feeble ploy to try and convince Steve he could swing on it. The Captain’s position remains true, the ball coming down and too close to his thigh to be even close to a fair pitch.
The team isn’t normally this dedicated to watching some other teams’ game unfold live, usually just finding out the score later on the radio or television recaps, but this match of the Clippers versus the Bisons was very important for one specific reason.
Three frames left. Tony takes a deep breath. The odds are stacked against him, but this isn’t a dice roll at a Craps table. He’s got three innings and absolutely zero control over what their offensive line-up can accomplish, but if there’s one thing he does have authority over, it’s making sure the Pacific League doesn’t score a
They all get out on floor nineteen, leaving Steve to go back up to floor twenty. His room is in the opposite direction of Tony's, but he finds his feet carrying him back towards room 2071.
Peter bumps into Steve in surprise, quickly righting himself, throwing an apologetic look up at his Captain before looking back to Tony. “S-Sorry, Mr. Stark!”
There's no dialogue exchanged as they drive to the diner. Steve has sort of become accustomed to this with Tony, and it’s actually a nice break from the forced small talk Steve normally has to endure with most people.
Pulling the hood of his raincoat up to shield his face from the rain, Steve hurries out onto the field. The rain has picked back up with the wind, droplets slanted sideways and splattering loudly against any surface it comes into contact with. “Tony!” He shouts over the rain and the howling winds, his voice drowned out as he approaches the pitcher.
“You sure haven’t made it easy on me,” she teases, catching him in the ribs with an elbow. “But… the team is gonna miss you.”
“I miss you too, Tony. The team misses you, even if they don’t want to admit it,” his chest vibrates with laughter as he gives his former player a squeeze. “You sure there’s no way I can convince you to come back? We don’t have to tell your dad.”
him. He’s not all bad, if you like wholesome do-gooders who are constantly making their moral agendas known. Tony just has to sit back and remind himself that he didn’t come to the Avengers to make himself happy. He’s proving a point, and so far it’s working splendidly.
The cheers are as deafening as Thor’s bat finally connects with the ball, sending it to the far corner of the stadium. He takes off around the bases, each stride propelling him forward with impossible power. The ball hits the top of wall, just out of the left fielder’s range, ricocheting off the padded foam and heading back to the infield. The fielder has to make a slight scramble, but manages to fire the ball straight to third base with no hesitation. The fumbling cost him though, Thor touching down on the base just before the ball connects with the third-baseman’s glove.
“I’ll take a coffee with milk,” Steve follows her gaze over to the bathroom door. “Make that two, actually. And the check, please.”
Tony's expression is unreadable. "So you don't care? It doesn't make you... uncomfortable?" Tony's dark eyes trail down Steve's naked chest predatorily, sending a shiver down the older man's spine.
Steve apparently notes his disdain. “That’s all I brought in terms of any kind of ‘formal wear’ and they’re for the press junkets after the game.”
Steve feels an entire new wave of arousal crash into him at the idea of Tony fingering himself in the showers when their other teammates were still around
As soon as Tony knew he was going to be joining the Knights, he immediately started doing his research, managing to convince Hill and Coulson to send him all their player files. He knew about Sam Wilson, Steve’s friend who used to play for the Avengers, and there were only one or two other players he recognized from the Triple-A League. The biggest shock was finding Tiberius Stone’s name slated on the list.
Her eyes fall down to his chest suddenly, brow knitting in scrutinization before her lips slowly curve into a smile, green eyes sparkling with mirth. “Really, Steve? A quickie at my wedding?”
It’s quick and rushed, but no less pleasurable because of it. Their circumstance is only fuel for their passion, Steve letting Tony yank his head back by his hair so he can hear those satisfying sounds freely pouring out of his mouth. Tony fucks him at a relentless pace, never once faltering in his rhythm or dragging things out. Steve is a goner as soon as Tony reaches around to pull him off. He knows all the right ways to bring him to climax, rubbing his thumb along his head and slit, stroking and twisting his shaft in the optimal motions that has Steve seeing stars behind his eyes. Coupled with the sensation of Tony penetrating him from behind, pulling out less and less until he’s practically just
He places a hand on Tony’s chest and lifts himself up slightly, hovering above him on the couch. He hates himself for doing it, but he can’t let himself get too caught up in the physical aspect of things and endanger how he really feels. “I… I think I need to take things slow.” He smiles sheepishly. “You okay with that? This is all still very,
He lets his eyes close, completely unconcerned by the world around him. They’re with mostly friends here, but even the strangers don’t stop either of them from showing their full affection to each other. They’re two men dancing together at their dear friends’ wedding. Two men who snuck off to have sex a couple of hours ago. Two men who are irrevocably in love with one another, and no amount of onlookers could change that.
Tony’s face shifts from dangerous levels of rage into something much more guarded; It’s honestly a little terrifying to watch the emotion get wiped clean so quickly from his features. “You’re right,
It’s a brutal blow, Tony knows it is. Hurting Steve is the only way he can possibly get him to leave. To walk away and save himself instead of falling off the ledge with Tony. The words cut deep and Tony can practically see the heartbreak. Steve’s expression immediately falls, releasing any pent up anger and frustration at the unfairness of their situation.
“You must think I’m such a terrible mother,” Maria says eventually, a laugh that turns into a sigh halfway through escaping from her.
He earns something between a laugh and a snort as Steve follows him back inside. They change into lightweight running gear and Tony takes Steve on a loop around the bluffs of the cape to give him a tour of the path-less-traveled by tourists. It’s not the most elegant course, plenty of hilly slopes and fields beset by knee-height grass. It’s a rolled ankle waiting to happen, but luckily neither of them get hurt when breaking away from the sand-dirt path through the moor. Their journey takes them through fields overrun with clusters of wildflowers, barren trees to their right and the cliff face leading down to the beaches below to their left. They keep up a steady pace, taking a winding path to travel at least a few miles away from Tony’s chalet, eventually taking a break atop a wide berm that stretches out over an idyllic, pastoral view, houses scarcely dotted across the landscape.
He hears Steve’s head shift against the grass in a nod. “In a weird way, I think I would too. As much as I don’t like some aspects of it, New York is all I’ve ever known.”
He knows their rules and the reason for caution, but he’s feeling bold. It’s early, there’s no one around, and Tony can’t bear to let Steve go without one last parting kiss. He leans down to stop Steve from entering the car completely, pressing their lips together in a melancholy goodbye. He expects it to be over just like that, a quick farewell, but Steve melts against him. Tony sighs against his mouth, running his hands over his body to just
Tony stays still as he hears Steve roll over to turn the blaring device off. He closes his eyes, feigning sleep as Steve begins shuffling about the room, eventually making his way into the en suite bathroom. Once Tony hears the shower going he gets up himself, changing into some comfortable athletic wear before calling in their breakfast order to room service.
Greene’s got a mean fastball, and Tony is sure he intends to use it to try and strike him out. He’ll probably throw a poor pitch to throw him off, make him think he was trying to get Tony to swing at a poor time and then follow it up with a pitch of blinding speed to end things quick.
Eventually, they untangle from one another and get back to their feet, blades of grass still clinging to their backs. They return home at a leisurely pace, framed by the pinks and oranges of the sunrise as they go. By the time they make it home, Tony’s exhaustion catches up with him. Steve somehow convinces him to rinse off in the shower, washing away sweat and dirt and pollen before letting him slog back into bed, not even bothering to dry off before collapsing face down on top of the sheets, naked save for the towel wrapped around his waist.
"No. No more buts, Steve." Peggy shifts forward in her seat, placing her elbows on her desk. "I have been nothing but transparent with you since the end of your first season. I understand you want your questions answered because you're upset about Bucky's injury and don't know how else to act other than lash out at me, but I know you're better than that." Peggy takes a deep breath, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Bucky was prone to injury, and Chester and I both knew that going in. It didn't help that Barnes refused to follow Dr. Erskine's advice time and time again. Chester wasn't willing to sign him on for more seasons than he could play for. There was no point. We decided to keep him on this season with a probationary contract, accounting for the fact that it might be his last with us."
There’s more photos, capturing the entire encounter from start to finish, with pages of written speculation about the identity of the mystery man, where he came from, and how long Tony’s been hiding this secret. The photos of the kiss alone aren’t enough to be convincing that it is in fact, Tony Stark making out with that man against his car in the middle of some abandoned street in Detroit. From certain angles, it could be argued that it could be any brunette man of slightly below average height who happens to bear resemblance to the world famous pitcher, but there are other photos that make his identity clear. Them approaching the car holding hands, Tony holding the door as the man starts to get inside, and after the car has driven away there are clear, unblocked shots that it’s undoubtedly Tony Stark.
Steve tries not to let it show how much Tony even bringing up the idea of marrying him warms his heart, even if it is in a completely joking and blasphemous manner. “Sounds good to me.”
Curiosity burns inside of Tony along with another corrosive feeling he can’t quite place. He follows after Thor, security leading them to the elevators not accessible by the public to take them down to the base level of the stadium.
“Okay guys, thanks to Stark we were able to keep the last inning at a standstill. Now I don’t want to see a single one of you go out there without giving it your all.
Steve hesitates. “Actually, it’s Sam. Yeah, he’s in town and I got a few drinks with him and crashed at his place last night.”
”, so to speak. But with the sounds that come pouring out of Tony every time they have sex, he has gotten a little curious about what the big deal is. Tony wasted no time in introducing him to a gland in his body that he didn’t even know existed for anything pleasure related, and on more than one occasion has shown him just how pleasurable it can be when he gets his talented fingers and mouth involved.
We're in the home stretch, so to speak! Once again, this chapter was meant to be around 20k and really got away from me, haha. You know I had to end it on a cliff hanger. One more chapter, and then an epilogue to wrap it all up. It's sad to know I'm almost finished, but this has been one of my fave chapters to write!!
is not the proper term here. Mansion, maybe. Estate, probably the most accurate. There are spotlights pointed on the three-story, gleaming white house sitting atop a cliff, overlooking the Pacific. There is a huge fountain in the middle of the circular driveway where they park, an impressive garden lining the front yard.
Tony slumps down onto the bench, shoulders heaving in a sigh as he stares down at his hands. He flexes each finger, one by one, Steve seeing the worn skin there as well as a torn nail or two. He’s not actively bleeding anymore, but Steve can see redness welling up against the surface of his skin. He quickly retrieves the first aid kit and gets to work, both of them straddling the bench to face each other. Steve is grateful he’s allowed to focus on Tony’s hands rather than meet that provokingly heart-rate-increasing stare again.
“Rain check? Tomorrow at the LaGuardia airport bathroom?” Tony gets to his feet and tries to will away his hard-on.
A tense and awkward silence hangs in the air. Steve is pretending to busy himself with examining the row of bats lined up on a rack, fingers gliding over the wooden and metal surfaces. “Sir, I hope you don’t mind me asking this, but do you happen to know why Tony left the Irons?”
Confetti explodes around them as people jump out from behind the counter and booths and tables, all the lights flickering on at once.
"You really think Tony gets into that kind of stuff?" Steve asks, put off by Natasha's blasé attitude around Tony's supposed drug trip. Of course, Steve knows better, but even if he didn't, he'd hope their coach would show a little more concern.
"Thank you, thank you," Steve says before rushing off again, apologizing as he bumps into people on his way to the elevator. Even with his rushing, he didn't see Christine Everhart anywhere. He might be too late.
“Fifteen thousand on red for Mr. Stark,” the dealer encourages as he places Tony’s chip, the entire table cheering in approval. He’s a young man, tall and thin with caramel skin and dazzling brown eyes that are now locked on Tony’s with intent. “It’s good to see you again, sir.”
Steve feels ice in his veins, hair raising on the back of his neck in alarm. There’s a moment that he wants to believe their coach is joking, but she would never kid about something like this. The room is deathly silent, shock evident across every Avengers’ face, none of them knowing what to possibly say in that moment.
Annie’s brothers immediately come rushing down the hill, not even bothering with the sleds. The kids building the snowman at the base of the hill come running up when they catch wind of the celebrities among them, immediately clamoring for attention, throwing out questions about baseball and the other Avengers.
Silence hangs in the air for a few moments as the two lean against the brick wall of the bar, Peggy's hands in the pockets of her blazer. Steve has no idea how to initiate conversation, but luckily his manager takes the reins before he can fumble out any awkward small talk.
Tony presses his lips together and closes his eyes. He can’t be looking at Steve’s face when he says his next words. He knows he’ll chicken out under the weight of those baby blues. “Steve… I love you.”
Steve scoots his chair closer, leaning through the space separating them to press a kiss to his temple. His lips are warm and Tony can’t help but tilt his head closer, following the gravitational pull the man always has on him. “What are you thinking?” Steve murmurs against his hairline, reaching out to clasp his cold fingers between his hands.
Howard’s eyes are a bit glassed over as he follows Steve’s gaze, his brow furrowing for a moment before it smooths out again. “Ah, right. That one is for Tony. If he can ever earn it,” the man grunted.
“Yeah,” he immediately jumps in, picking Bucky’s jacket off a balance beam so he can help the man into it. “I mean, last week you could only get it to about forty-five, right?”
"Now that you've all had a few drinks, I figured it was time for speeches and some praise for the players who deserve recognition after this season." This is met with more raucous cheering which Peggy has to silence again. "Alright, you animals, let me get to it or we'll be here all night."
Tony steps forward with his fellow two teammates chosen to have their photos taken for the papers. Pepper stresses to the reporters that they don't have time for questions, urging the rest of the players to cut through the stadium and get on the bus to Sacramento.
Tony attempts to glide right past him towards the dugout, but Steve catches him by the back of his untucked jersey. “What the hell was that?” He snaps in annoyance.
He hears Tony snort from beside him, but he doesn’t comment otherwise. His mouth is too full of crab meat to bother, apparently. That, or he was still following Maria’s instruction to keep ill-mannered comments to himself.  “That sounds about right,” Howard huffs. “Tony here always did have trouble with authority.” Tony remains silent, keeping his eyes stubbornly on the table.
Once he’s gone, Tony turns to Steve and the other two players ahead of him on the batting order. “Okay guys, ignore whatever Rezzo just told you and listen to me. Waynes, Nancy, I need at least one of you to get on base. Most likely, one of you will get an out, but that’s okay as long as it’s not both of you. Hammer’s show-boaty, and he loves to throw a pitch he knows will go foul to try and psych a batter out. There’s a reason Stane saved him until the end for this exact situation. You guys need to be careful when you do and don’t swing, but Steve—” He turns his full attention on his Captain now, his blue eyes alight with attentive energy as he listens to every word Tony has to say to him. “As long as we don’t have two outs, don’t swing.”
“Does this not prove I was right to be?!” Tony practically screams, gesturing to himself. “What’s it going to take, Steve?! How many more assaults before you realize you can’t give the entire world the benefit of the doubt and realize that the
Steve is speechless, and he’s not sure if there’s a single appropriate reply to what Tony just laid out in front of him. Dove is suddenly a saving grace, finally coming back to take their orders now that most of the tension has dissolved.
Already having an inkling as to what it could be, Steve carefully pulls out some of the glittery tissue paper to reveal a vintage Polaroid camera sitting in the box, along with a few small packets of what must be the film cartridges. In awe, Steve slowly lifts it out of the box, almost in disbelief at how close it is to his now obsolete camera that sits on a bookshelf in his bedroom as more of a momento than anything else. It had stopped functioning properly years ago, and just like Tony’s note had pointed out, Steve found it near impossible to find a replacement for it that actually works properly. With all the developments in film and photography, everyone has moved onto the digital space. While Steve can see the appeal and convenience of what digital cameras provide, there’s nothing quite like a point and shoot with an instant development, no fancy tricks. There’s too many buttons and settings on those new cameras anyway; Steve doesn’t even know where to start.
Steve meanders around the house, peeking into open doorways as he makes his way back to the stairs. Howard’s warnings about Tony swim around in his head, Steve forcing them away as nothing more than ramblings of a drunk. He ascends up to the third floor of the house which has two large oak doors towards the center of the estate, overlooking the main foyer. Steve pushes them open, his jaw dropping at the size of this library.
“Hey,” she places her hand over his to bring him back down to earth. “I didn’t mean to be so blunt about it. I just wanted to let you know you have someone in your corner.”
Steve can't breathe properly again until he's in the elevator. He doesn't hit any buttons, just stands alone in the tiny metal box, clinging to the support bars. He isn't sure what happens next. Does Tony come charging out to explain himself and tell Steve it was some big misunderstanding? A well-orchestrated practical joke at his expense?
Steve takes his glasses off to rubs his eyes after staring at the screen for too long, leaning back in his chair and spinning around to stare out of the window behind him. He can see the building he and Bucky used to live in, their old apartment sitting in the distance, now almost unrecognizable from all the additions and renovations. It had been Tony’s idea that they rent an apartment in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan when they were in the process of moving back to the city so that Steve had the chance to feel a little more at home. He would miss the sanctuary that was their private little domain Upstate, but they could still go back whenever they wanted (and whenever their jobs allowed).
Natasha ignores him until they reach her office. She slams the door shut behind Steve. “Have a seat.”
Vegas’ own Linden Jacobs is Tony’s third and final victim of the bottom of the Seventh. Jacobs is one of the new players Tony would realistically have reservations for, but he knows he’s a good hitter who tends to hesitate on balls that he thinks will earn him a walk. That’s more than enough info he needs.
He waits another few moments before speaking, making sure the room is utterly silent, waiting for him to speak. His eyes flicker down to the cards in his hands. “Recently, photos of me have surfaced to the public. Photos that depict—” Fuck. He swallows down the lump in his throat, trying to play it off as a thoughtful pause. “A deviant act. What the photos didn’t provide was context. I am not allowed to disclose the identity of the other man in the photos, and we will not be discussing him today.” His hands tremble slightly as he flips to the next card, something heavy settling in his stomach. “It’s no secret that I enjoy to drink, and at the time of the photos I was not in my right mind and under the influence of alcohol. This is a terrible addiction that I have been dealing with in private for some time now, and unfortunately, I was caught in a very unfortunate lapse of judgement with a stranger. I am not, and never have been, attracted to the same sex in any way, shape, or form—”
Tony sleeps through the second leg of their trip in preparation for the night ahead. After a bit of initial grogginess as they all file off the plane passes, Tony’s feeling awake and raring to go as they exit the airport. Media hounds are lined up outside, paparazzi with cameras and reporters with microphones trying to shove their way forward. Most if not all of the All-Star players are passing through this airport today, and every sports outlet is hoping to get any kind of quote from the players.
Arms tighten around his waist and he feels a wetness pool against his neck as Steve tucks his face there, letting Tony know that his words reached him after all.
, and I’m going to make the most of being back in my old stomping grounds. I would tell you about all the incredible weekends I’ve had there if I was ever sober enough to remember them.”
Tony isn’t sure why Steve has the impression that he’d be susceptible to anything that some old teammates or his old coach had to say to him, but he doesn’t press the matter any further. He changes into his cleats and hurries out onto the field to work with Bender and the team’s catchers so they can get used to the interaction between one another to try and build seamless exchanges.
Steve shrugs. “I don’t know what you care about, but I do know you came to the Avengers for a reason. Maybe I don’t know what that is yet— Hell, maybe
Tony is grateful he’s out of Steve’s view so the man doesn’t witness him choking on his mouthful of poached eggs. He takes a gulp of the bittersweet coffee, not caring how much he burns his mouth as long as he can get everything down the right pipe. “Wh-What?”
This is Tony’s old league. His old teammates and rivals. His old coach and mentor, for fuck’s sake. He left all of that behind to take a chance and prove that he could be so much more without any of them. This is supposed to be his redemption, his chance to finally rid himself of the chip on his shoulder that he’s been carrying his entire baseball career.
Tony’s less abrasive when he asks him a direct question or gives him a suggestion during warm-ups or between innings. It’s not until Dallas that they actually play a game together for the first time.
?” Tony groans loudly. They’re surrounded by their other teammates who are casting sidelong glances at each other, flashing wide eyes and raised eyebrows.
The fingers are his own, he realizes after a few cycles of this, feeling returning to his fingertips.
“Hey, Joey!” Steve gets the boy’s attention, pointing over to one of their abandoned sleds at the bottom of the hill, beside one of the cars. “Sneak over there and grab me that sled, I have an idea.”
He elongates his strides to catch up with her, wondering what’s up with the urgency. “You don’t usually want my opinion on that kind of stuff. Is it really all that different?”
Steve rises to the bait, surging forward and pulling Tony into a kiss, water pouring between their open mouths as they rut against each other, Steve’s cock settling against Tony’s. He can feel the ridges of his abdomen as his hips slide over his skin, hands reaching down to grope that familiar lean muscle. He knows every line and plane of skin on Tony’s body at this point, his fingertips and mouth tracing over it time after time. He remembers being in total awe the first time they had sex, Steve insisting they turn on his bedside table lamp so he could watch the way Tony’s body moved and flexed as he rode him. Steve never thought of himself to be an inherently sex-driven person, but there were multiple gym sessions with Tony in the following weeks where he had to learn how best to hide an erection in gym shorts and sweats when he saw Tony’s arms or chest flex a certain way.
“You know, I really don’t appreciate being singled out like this,” Tony huffs, narrowed eyes still trained on Steve’s behind as he tries to figure the best way to go for the keys. Maybe he stares for a little longer than necessary, but no one seems to notice.
“Hey! We were wondering where you two were,” Scott greets from where he’s stretching with a group of their teammates. “What took you so long?”
The talking immediately halts when they enter. Steve crosses the room to get a good angle on Tony, the hospital staff immediately stepping aside so his view is no longer blocked. He’s unconscious, laying on his back with his arms at his sides. There are bruises and swelling on his face, and a bandage wrapped around his head. He can see the dried blood clumped in his hair by his temple, as well as some rust color seeping through the bandages. Purpling bruises are blossoming along his face and down his neck, visible beneath the bandages and oxygen mask over his face. He’s got IV’s stuck into his elbow and some wires going underneath the fabric of the gown and a brace on one hand that goes all the way up to his forearm, the other wrist heavily bandaged. His eyes are closed, form eerily motionless. Tony is never this still, even when sleeping naturally. He’s constantly twitching or shifting around, and even if his body is mostly static, his eyes can always be seen moving around behind his lids, face occasionally tweaking into some sort of expression based on whatever kind of vivid dreams he’s having. The only sign of life is the constant beeping of the machine next to him.
He was almost grateful when the news came that he would be moving down to the Triple-A league. Despite moving up in the ranks, one league at a time, Triple-A was the one league Steve never played in. The Stars had called him up after four seasons of playing in the Double-As, so he had skipped right over the top league in the Minors.
Steve can’t resist the natural pull, ascending up a few steps to meet Tony half-way. He stops two steps below the first landing so the two are matched for height, staring into dark chocolate eyes. “Cutting it pretty close, aren’t you?”
Tony laughs and rolls his eyes. Steve can feel his blood boiling at this kid's attitude. He clearly has the attitude of a teenager who couldn't be bothered, which made sense as to why he has such a mouth on him. "Of course I am. It's what Starks do." He looks off camera then and nods to someone off screen before clapping the reporter on the back. "Feel free to quote me on that too," he says, pointing and winking at the camera before walking off.
“You said Natasha will be there too, right?” Bucky asks, a familiar tone of interest in his voice. “So I’ll finally get to meet the elusive Coach Romanoff?”
The office is larger than Natasha’s, mainly because more of the formal meetings with investors or other managers usually take place in here as Janet is the front end of the entire operation. She’s sitting behind her desk as a familiar anchor, but there are three more strangers seated in front of her. Their conversation stops abruptly when Tony walks in, all but Janet immediately getting to their feet to greet him. The trio is dressed rather sharply, more formal than Janet’s simple blouse and slacks
Tony can feel his anger and frustration mounting. “You’re the one always lecturing everybody about injuries and taking care of them properly and blah, blah, blah! But now you’re not even taking your own advice!” Tony shouts at him, stepping closer into Steve’s personal space. “Don’t you care about yourself?!”
The first batter takes his place. Tony’s lucky, because it’s Longoria, his old teammate who he’s seen at bat hundreds of times in hundreds of situations. He hardly needs to think about it, the process almost happening automatically as he works out the perfect pitching pattern in his brain.
The whistle blows for a time out after Tony’s next pitch, the batter just barely getting away with a single. Killian is the reason for the hold up in the play, barking something into the dugout where Hammer finally emerges. Tony watches through narrowed eyes as he jogs out onto the field, taking the place of the batter on first. Ah, so he wasn’t slated to pitch at all this game. For some odd reason, Killian had switched him over to a pinch runner. Thinking about it, Hammer’s pretty quick on his feet even if his baserunning stats don’t reflect that. Still, the choice seemed odd unless the man he subbed in for is particularly slow. Putting in a pinch runner at the very beginning of an inning when he’s only on first base is almost useless, especially this late in the game and
about it.” He feels childish saying it, but all his anger and frustration since their break up is seeping out of every pore. “You could’ve been killed that night, Tony. We’re lucky you weren’t. When I saw you laying there—” his voice cracks, betraying him. He closes his eyes, refusing to cry right now. He’s cried enough over Tony. “I spent those weeks in the hospital with you, so grateful that I hadn’t lost you, and then you immediately cut me off. Tell me how that was meant to help me?”
“Yeah,” Tony takes his lead-off, but keeps closer to Steve and the base than he usually would when getting his head start for his next run. “Sometimes you gotta go above and beyond, right?”
"No." Tony says immediately before dropping his underwear and striding right past Steve into the showers.
Steve is ready for it, glove outstretched to safely catch it, immediately bringing his arm in so his dominant hand can scoop the ball and fire it towards home. Hammer loses the race against the ball, tripping over his own feet as he falls down onto the plate seconds after Victor has already received it.
Their maybe-hypothetical-maybe-not-so-hypothetical discussion of a ridiculously gay wedding ends when one of the servers approaches the table. She gathers the empty champagne flutes and sets down freshly refilled ones at the place settings. Steve accepts his with a smile and Tony holds up a hand in rejection when she gets to him.
Steve pauses for a moment before letting out a short laugh. "I didn't even realize— Yeah. We," he clears his throat, suddenly feeling very on the spot with how Peggy is looking at him. "It's always been the two of us since the beginning."
Tony shakes his head, seeming displeased at his idea. “No, we should go back to the stadium so you can get your own car.”
Tony flips him the bird as he steps into the spinning doors and disappears into the hotel lobby. Steve is still smiling to himself about finally getting the last word in as he walks the last couple of blocks home.
Coulson steps forward. “I’ll remind you all that questions are not permitted at this time. Security, please escort Miss Everhart from the room as she has broken the agreed protocol.”
Her face screws up in annoyance and she shakes his hand off her arm. “Fine.” Tony finishes pitching to the next batter who ends up getting a single. Natasha signals to the ref for a timeout, the whistle blowing. “Sixty seconds, Rogers,” she grumbles.
Clint pouts at him but continues around the table, undeterred and now harassing all of their friends to try and get them out of their seats. “Come on, losers. This is a wedding. Weddings are for dancing, not sitting around.”
about Bucky's injury is now pushing him further in the direction of ignoring the problem and expecting it to just disappear.
Whitaker holds his arms out, walking away from Tony. “That’s the game, kid! If you don’t like it, then go home to Daddy!”
Steve is on deck when it’s time for the bottom half of the inning, but even as he peers back into their dugout from his designated spot near the sidelines, he can’t spot Tony’s familiar head amongst the rest of his players. He’s distracted when it’s his turn at bat, luckily getting a walk to first. The pity base doesn’t last long for him when the very next play ends in the Fisher Cat’s second baseman tagging him out.
“Did I stutter, Cap? Jeez, I said don’t swing,” Tony grabs him by the shoulder. “Trust me, okay? Hammer doesn’t want to risk you getting a triple or even another home-run, which we both know you can pull off at this point. His pitches are gonna be wild, and you’re not going to swing at a single one, understand?” He doesn’t let Steve’s gaze go, needing him, begging him to follow his direction despite his better judgement.
He stares down at the steaming liquid in his mug, rotating it slowly between both hands. “I told you, the camera—”
“Steve,” Bucky looks past the small group of medics that have gathered around him, all of them turning in surprise. They're so preoccupied they hadn’t heard Steve enter.
More pieces fall into place, the sudden realization washing over him. He laughs, much to Ty’s confusion, having to press a hand against his ribs just in hopes of not busting one from his sudden fit. “Holy shit, those snakes are fucking
Steve’s arms are shaking in protest as he continues to hold Tony up, the man going completely limp in his arms as he comes down from his orgasm. Steve clutches him closer, intoxicated by Tony’s natural and artificial scents coexisting, the rising steam in the room only further accentuating the smell of sex and evidence of what they’ve done here. He rolls his hips gently inside of Tony as he feels his member twitch through the aftershocks, earning a small whimper as he continues to prod inside of Tony’s sensitive area.
Looking down the field, Tony Stark is no longer all smiles. Sunglasses removed and hat turned forwards to cast a shadow over his brow, he looks like a different player. Steve shifts uncomfortably, eyes darting between Vision and the newcomer, both of them poised and ready with Natasha filling in as catcher, glove at the ready.
Peggy follows Tony over to his sports car, the engine revving loudly before Tony pulls out of the stadium parking lot. Steve rolls his eyes at the power display and kicks his bike into gear, following behind them. Tony certainly does his best to lose Steve on the short, fifteen-minute drive to the restaurant, an Italian place called Donatella's, but Steve stays right on his tail the entire way.
The music swells and all the guests get to their feet, turning to the entryway of the greenhouse. Bucky steps into the center of the aisle in his grey suit, flashing one last, private smile to Steve before holding his arm out.
Steve is grateful that Tony is the one he’s discovering this aspect of his sexuality with. He’s kind and patient even as Steve awkwardly tries to fumble his way through figuring out what works best for both of them. They take things slow, Tony insisting Steve just sit back and relax while he
She takes away their plates and brings out two fresh cups of coffee, his with milk and Tony’s black, sugar and creamer on the side. The coffees are cooled enough to drink by the time Tony slogs his way back into the booth, still looking pale with a sheen of sweat coating his olive-toned skin.
After a much improved season from last year and their game earlier that afternoon won, The Avengers, for the first time in thirteen years, are in the running to play in the Minor League Champsionship Game against the finalists from the Pacific Coast League.
He turns back around, letting his vision tunnel in again on the opponent at hand. The sound around him dulls down into a roar. He can still hear Hammer’s tones in the cacophony, but his words are incomprehensible as Tony stares down the line and in three clean pitches, strikes the next batter out.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect assumption to make. An hour later once all the team is packed and ready to hit the road again, Tony's nowhere to be seen. Steve double checks the lobby, a frown on his face. He walks up to the man behind the reception counter.
" The reporter is looking Tony in the eye again. "Do you have anything to add onto that and perhaps clarify to the side of the baseball audience that isn't on board with your 'scientific' approach to the game?"
Steve pushes the door with his hand, hearing the chain click as it strains to keep the door shut. "I know she's in here, Tony, you don't have to pretend."
He walks around the inside of the stadium, plenty of spectators queueing up for merch, food, alcohol, and the bathroom, and not necessarily in that order. He keeps his hat down low and goes unrecognized by most of the fans. A single young boy spots him while waiting in line with his parents, mouth opening slightly as he makes eye contact. Steve holds up a finger to his lips and flashes the kid a knowing smile, the little boy nodding immediately and mirroring the action.
Steve laughs. “I just meant to say a quick hello…” Something in his demeanor changes. He hears a bit of movement on the other line— making himself comfortable? “But it
Almost imperceptible smile lines now appear around his mouth and the crinkle at the edge of his eyes, another noticeable line between his eyebrows from all the furrowing he did while tinkering and inventing. Strands of premature grey shimmer in the light right around his temples, a stark contrast against the deep brown of his shorter-cut hair. His facial hair is a little more managed as well, cultivated into a sharp goatee that’s spotting the same salt-and-pepper treatment. It makes him look refined, although part of Steve wants to start his due diligence of firing back the old man jokes Tony used to throw at him so cavalier. His skin is nicely tanned as well, clearly coming off of some vacation to somewhere much sunnier than New York is in the winter months, the little freckles and sunspots on his nose and cheeks darkened and much more noticeable now. Steve wants to run his finger along them and watch his nose scrunch up in response beneath his touch, Tony’s laugh echoing clearly in his mind.
Tony doesn’t get much time to rest at all. After his run, they got two players to second and third base before their next batter struck out, earning them no additional runs going into the third inning. They’re still up, 2-1, and Tony is determined to make that gap bigger and prove himself to Whitaker. There is no more room in his head allotted for Steve Rogers.
Steve shrugs. "I guess I can understand where you were coming from." Tony's points at dinner, as harsh and vulgar as they were, weren't completely unwarranted. Taking it out on Steve wasn't exactly fair either.
The panel of players take turns answering the cookie-cutter questions that they're all used to. How they feel about the season, if there was more pressure after how close they were to reaching this point last season, how rigorous the training was as they fell under a new, stricter coach, how much pressure they felt being this close to win the American League, those kinds of inquiries.
, being the operative amount there. I swear, it’s like his sole purpose in life is to bend things until they break.”
This question flusters Steve much more than the last one did. He glances towards Peggy who's giving him a patient look. She takes a deep breath, motioning for Steve to copy her.
!” Steve finally bursts. Tony’s retort dies in his throat. Steve grabs him by the shoulders and for a terrifyingly exhilarating moment, Tony thinks he’s about to get kissed.
“A family friend owns this hotel chain. I paid him upfront for the next year to let me rent out the penthouse at a discounted rate,” Tony shrugs.
Peggy starts speaking again, listing off all the names of the notable players this season and their accomplishments, Steve cheering and clapping for all of his fellow teammates. "...And lastly, our newcomers, Rogers and Barnes."
“So… I think the only silver lining I have right now is that I’ll be under a female coach again with the Knights,” Tony brings up, nudging Natasha. “Although I know she’ll never be as great as you.”
“Who’s here for Tony Stark?” They suddenly hear from behind them. Both of them are on their feet in an instant, approaching the nurse who had just come through the ER double doors holding a clipboard.
He sees her pacing halt in his periphery, still tending to cleaning Tony up just to have anywhere else to put his attention. “Oh, darling,” he hears her sigh. “I know it wasn’t a lie in any way except for legality. The love you two have for each other is painfully obvious to anyone smart enough to pay attention.”
If Tony feels Steve openly staring at him, he doesn’t comment, focused in on his work like he’s alone by himself. “Merry Christmas, by the way,” Tony eventually mumbles, eyes flickering back and forth between the results on his computer screen and what he has written down in front of him.
He’ll try and pitch Tony something he has to hit far and high, the best position for them to be in to try and get him out. A bunt isn’t going to cut it this time, but Tony also noticed his fast balls tend to be less accurate in staying in the strike zone.
Dove seems to remember there’s two customers sitting in front of her, and Steve doesn’t miss the way she ogles at him for a moment before speaking. “Well, hi, Tall, Blonde, and Handsome. What can I wet your whistle with today?”
“I…” Steve doesn’t know what to say. Tony is genuinely asking permission to come back, seemingly with the best intentions for once. He looks healthy, and underneath all the emotional turmoil clouding up between them, he looks
Steve tries to hide his smile. “Nothing, I just pegged you more as an Upper East Sider. Figured you’d have a swanky place right on 5th Avenue.”
,” Tony hisses back, leaning forward as much as he can with Rhodey doing his best to block him with his entire body. He leans around the man’s shoulder and spits at Hammer’s face. “I don’t need the satisfaction of beating your intolerant ass right now because beating you in the championship will be so much better!”
hot topic. Maybe all the gab about him has rooted somewhere deep in Steve’s subconscious, slowly building up a distaste for his new teammate without him even realizing.
I don't even know what to say other than thank you for reading and giving feedback. I love this story SO MUCH and I've never been so inspired or written so much content that I love for a pairing I love as much as Stony. I'll see you guys soon for the epilogue and am so happy any of you have given this niche little fic a chance. <333
prick. Why bother trying to find the good in Stark if you and him aren’t ever gonna be close like you and me are?”
“You think it had to do with…” Steve feels his throat tighten, a hotness prickling at his own eyes. His stomach drops again and he’s unable to voice a concern that had been pushed to the back of his mind as something that you just heard stories about, not things that could actually happen to you or your loved ones.
“I won’t listen to anymore slander out of that mouth!” Howard points angrily at his son, a vein bulging on his temple. “You don’t even know how lucky you are to be playing underneath such a stand-up player, let alone sitting next to him at dinner right now. You could learn a few things from this man, but instead you choose to misbehave, complain, and make your snide little comments under your breath like a
They had carpooled over to the physical therapy facility, Steve getting his knee and Tony getting his shoulder checked out before the game due to Natasha’s insistence. Steve has been playing more this season than he has in the past couple of years and luckily enough hasn’t seen his old injury flare up at all. After a much more rocky season for Tony, Nat had him on weekly check-ups for sign of any rotator cuff tears in his shoulder or strain on his lower back. Spondylolysis was a pretty regular spinal injury to see in baseball, mainly from the constant twisting motion experienced by batters and pitchers.
“I have to go,” Steve insists softly, plucking each of Tony’s fingers to open up his closed fist. Rather than push Tony’s hands away, he captures both of them within his own, thumbs smoothing gingerly over his calloused palms. “Let’s keep an eye on our schedules okay? Maybe we can see each other on the road again soon. We’ve got a couple days break next month for a weekend training camp. I might be able to convince Nat to let me duck out and I can come to D.C.”
“I’m from Southampton, myself. I miss Long Island every day, but I’ve grown quite fond of the West Coast.”
In case you don't come from my other social media platforms, I'm also an artist! I plan on doing some fun fanart and things for this verse, which I'll either add directly into this fic (maybe under a 9th chapter or something?) or just create a separate works under this series to share those with you guys. Fun fact: I actually drew fanart for this fic years ago: https://papistark.tumblr.com/post/149194352236 . I hate it now because I've improved IMMENSELY since drawing that, but now I'm just motivated to redraw it and draw so much more. So keep an eye out for new and improved art to go along w/ this fic, even if it is super lame that I draw stuff based off my own writing lol.
his play style. On paper, it makes sense to push the outfielders forward, not expecting Tony to hit it all the way to the back right corner of the field. But he does, and it’s all thanks to Hammer and his shitty pitching.
No one is sitting as the second out is called and the next Clippers player steps up, a single player on third base, already in position to high tail it for home plate. The batter hits the ball into the outfield and the entire team is on their feet as they watch the ball come hurtling back down towards the ground before being caught snugly in the fielder’s glove.
Janet shakes her head and sits back in her seat to try and calm herself before continuing. “As I’m sure you’re well aware, despite never
when he overextended his elbow. Is it a muscle tear? Could it be worse than that? What if Bucky is out for the rest of the season? Or the rest of his life?
Tony’s heart is racing now, his breaths shortening. He fights through it, no longer shying away from the confrontation but looking headlong into it, his stare hard and unwavering. “You think you saved me. Made my life
As Tony surveys around the open space one more time, counts his bags, double-checks that all his necessary grooming materials are packed in his toiletry bag, he realizes he hasn’t heard the buzzing in a while. It’s soon replaced by insistent pounding on his door, the sudden sound making him jump. “I know, I know, I’m almost ready!” He calls as he jogs over the door, quickly opening it. “Oh good, it’s just you. Help me grab these bags so we can make it down in one trip.”
. In his eyes, everything is a work in progress; There will always be more room to build, grow, and improve.
He almost doesn’t expect Tony to respond, watching the young man roll his eyes before pulling his other foot up onto the edge of the bench to finish tightening his laces. Steve closes his locker, now dressed in the team’s casual kit. Natasha confirmed with him this morning that he won’t be playing today, and honestly, Steve won’t mind getting the chance to watch from the sidelines and focus on all the strengths and weaknesses his team is going to show today. It's a brand new season, and he's not going to let Tony’s upturned nose and venomous glares get him down.
While they kept their personal life off the field, it would be kind of impossible not to take their work home with them somewhat. Steve is sure there will be plenty more nights like this, discussing the team, certain members, making plans and hard decisions together. Hopefully they won’t always be having these talks on their living room floor eating Chinese food on top of a box, looking more like the twenty-something year old college kids that probably surround them in this apartment complex than the pair of married, grown men that they are.
Tony’s head snaps over to look at Bucky, wondering if the man is trying to call his bluff. He doesn’t look conniving or manipulative, pose relaxed as he drives with one hand on the wheel, the other resting on the center console. “He did?” Tony asks, voice catching in his throat slightly. He and Steve had agreed on keeping things a secret for a multitude of reasons. Pepper only knows because she’s privy to everything going on in Tony’s life, and he supposes it’s only fair if Steve has someone he can talk to about their relationship as well.
Steve doesn’t have time to ask Tony to clarify when a woman suddenly slips into the space on Tony’s other side, leaning in front of him. “Hi, Mr. Stark? Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. Is it okay if I talk to you for a few? Off the record, of course,” she flashes a brilliant white smile, holding out her hand.
Steve immediately reaches back and grabs Tony by the wrist, bringing his hand forward to show that he had the hotel keys sandwiched between two of his fingers. Rather than take the keys back again, he drops Tony’s wrist, letting him have this win. “Only because if I don’t come with you, you’ll be out until ungodly hours getting absolutely trashed.”
Outside of the stadium, things are less productive. Tony throws himself into his training and his studies of their team so he’s completely wiped by the time he returns to his empty home. As long as he’s focusing on other things, he doesn’t have to think about how lonely he is. It’s something he’s practiced for most of his life, but the past couple of years lulled him into a false sense of security. The emails between himself and Steve grow less and less frequent. Tony forgets his promises to call Steve back, and when he does remember, it ends up going to voicemail. The Avengers are plenty busy as well, treading water near the top of the pack for the Triple-A so that they can hopefully go to the Championship once again. Their stolen days together turn into a few hours at a time. It’s harder to find dates where their away games match up in nearby cities. Their times being able to see each other become more spaced out from weeks to months. No one can be at fault for their relationship slipping during the height of both of their seasons.
“Oh my god. This is so bad. I can’t watch, but I also can’t look away,” Quill covers his face with his hands, peeking between his fingers. “It’s like seeing a car crash on the side of the freeway.”
"A priority pain in my ass..." Pepper mumbles under her breath, checking her pager. "We're going to be late and your father is going to kill us both."
Ah yes, the very strict rules that every player for the Knights is supposed to adhere to. Coach Danvers runs a tight ship, that’s for certain. He’s already been given the entire spiel about appropriate behavior, dangerous activities that could risk injury outside of the field, drinking and smoking, diet, and all things he had to sign a fucking
“Um, I’ve always looked up to Mr. Stark. When I was finishing high school, I really wasn’t sure which direction to take with my life. I really loved baseball, but I loved school and science too. The fact that Tony was always so open with his love for both sides of things and has been able to create this style of pitching no one has ever seen before with all his knowledge about physics and maths really pushed me to try and do the same thing. He’s actually the reason I quit baseball for a bit to pursue my interests in STEM research.”
, but what can he do? He has no idea where Tony could be, and no real confirmation that he even boarded his flight in the first place. He needs Tony to walk through that door so they can laugh about the numerous panicked voicemails Steve left when all Tony had done was get delayed with lost luggage or cab troubles or media swarms. He isn’t sure how much longer he can sit in his apartment, driving himself mad with worry.
He has no idea when they’ll have another opportunity to see each other like this again. Even with his face shrouded underneath a baseball cap, hood, and sunglasses, Tony openly gazes at him in the soft morning light. He really is gorgeous, and it’s quiet moments like these that Tony wonders what not-crappy thing he ever did in life to deserve someone so kind. So good.
“You look excited to be here,” Steve comments, Tony’s mouth open wide in a yawn as he stops in front of his locker which is now directly beside Steve’s.
As always, I love this fic more than anything and hope you guys are enjoying it too. I'm still sticking to saying I'm going to TRY and update within about 3 weeks, but uhhhhhh we'll see!!!
“Good, good,” Peggy straightens up a little, brushing something nonexistent off Steve's shoulder. An old habit he remembers her doing to all the players when she was doing her best to be casual about congratulating their performance. “I really do think you’ve found your place with the Avengers. How is Barnes, by the way? I haven’t heard much about him since… Well, everything.”
Tony doesn’t reply, but he slides something down the table towards Steve. He looks over in confusion, seeing Tony’s compact cell phone sitting there. It’s got a sleeker design than any of the ones Steve sees advertised in the market, and it has to be because Tony built it himself.
It’s a bright day in New York. The light of the sun is diffused but undeterred by the thin stretch of clouds covering the grey sky that stretches out above the stadium in front of Steve. He walks into the Polo Grounds with a renewed confidence that this is going to be a remarkable season.
Janet shakes her head. Steve can’t even convince himself with those words, let alone persuade someone else. “I know he’ll be okay, but I’m sick of him ignoring authority. This is the entire reason why I was hesitant to take him on but Fury
Now dressed, he sets out on the insurmountable task of looking for Tony in the massive penthouse. As he exits the room, the rest of the apartment is dim, curtains still drawn in the main rooms with a few lamps turned on here and there. After enough aimless wandering, he can hear the sound of a steady bass line coming from somewhere above. He finds a spiral staircase in a tucked away den near the back of an apartment, ascending upwards closer to the sounds of guitar riffs and stadium-sized vocals.
Full of energy and raring to go, Tony slides over the hood of Steve’s car to jump into the passenger side, ignoring the indignant outcry from behind him. Maybe a few more scuffs here or there would finally tip Steve over the edge to buy a new car already and get rid of his
Steve sighs. “Tony, I don’t want to talk about it like this. I’m not attacking you—” Steve sees Dove coming back towards them and decides to shut up. This isn’t a conversation they should be having in front of a complete stranger.
The crowds and press begin to overwhelm Steve as he tries to remember where Peggy told him they would be watching from. There are baseballs to be signed and reporters with microphones and it’s all too much. The rest of his team is still on the field, surrounded by their own sea of people dying to get a glimpse of the World Series winners. Steve is about to give up completely until he feels a hand grab firmly to the back of his jersey. He whirls around quickly, relieved when it’s just Bucky and not some crazed fan. They grab each other by the wrists and force their way back through the crowd, Steve’s eyes trained on the brace that Bucky’s other arm is currently wearing.
pretty uncomfortable, but he’s too distracted with the man on top of him to be that concerned over it.
"Steve, please," Tony begs again, his voice lowered now, less forceful. "Just turn around and go. I don't know what you think is going on, but I need you to get out."
Games are an entirely new experience. Tony isn’t wavered by the new level of athletes he’s facing, but it’s definitely not the same as the Triple-As. There’s no such thing as
“Well, I guess I don’t know the logistics of it all,” Steve admits. “Just trying to see the silver lining here. Did Peggy mention any kind of clause that says the contract stays in place even if there's an injury? I mean, they’re still paying for the treatment and the surgery since it happened before season’s end, so maybe you’re still--” Steve realizes he’s alone, turning around to see Bucky had stopped about fifteen paces ago.
his favorite. He abandons his clothes on the tile floor before making quick work of his shower, knowing that Pepper will be blaring the horn on the car outside any moment now.
Tony’s mouth is immediately on his own, tasting of sugary sweet peppermint and spiced rum. He barely has time to flick the pictures onto the coffee table before he has a lap full of Tony, the other man wasting no time in straddling one of his thighs as he surges forward.
"Morning," Tony huffs under his breath as he heads for the door. Steve hears an intense sounding electronic lock slide into place behind them, following Tony up the dark path back to the house. There's a few steep inclines that Tony almost face plants on, but he shoves Steve's arm away every time it's offered.
“And my hands?” Tony asks, staring down at them. He gets a phantom tingle from both wrists, remembering being held down and stomped on by his assailants.
“Just that your nose looks better than it did last year. I imagine that’s the only thing that’s improved for you.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Steve laments, signaling once more towards the bar for another round of drinks.
They arrive at the front of the room, dropping their linked arms to instead face each other, clasping each other’s hands. Clint is already weeping openly, holding a tissue up to his face to muffle the quiet sobs. Tony rubs his back comfortingly, Carol standing behind him and reaching around to do the same while clearly trying to hold back laughter. From where he’s standing, Steve isn’t able to fully see Bucky’s face, but he can tell by the body language alone that he’s moved to tears as well.
Steve smiles up at his best friend, bringing his arm up to wrap around Bucky’s waist. “’Til the end of the line.”
Tony makes good on the first part of his deal. He tags out one player himself, and also manages to get the ball to first base and home for two more outs. He can hear the garbled praise from the announcer’s box as they move into the bottom of the third with no runs for the International League.
circumstances, Tony. Realistically, it shouldn’t have happened in the first place, but Fury, Romanoff, and I decided to allow it. Since you came to the Avengers, you have absolutely refused to sign a multi-season contract and as dubious as your request was, we accepted those terms.”
“Uh, sorry, I expected to get your answering machine,” Steve scratches the back of his head. “What are you doing home? You’re normally gone during the break.”
“You’ll want to go downstairs, there’s concrete and aluminum in these walls that will interfere with the signal,” he interrupts before reaching over and turning his stereo back on. The blaring music leaves no further room for argument, Steve quietly picking up the phone and retreating back down the stairs. He feels awful for even implying in front of Tony that he didn’t want to be here, but he’ll have to find a time to apologize for that later. He knows the man well enough at this point to know his stubbornness has a time limit, and he’ll just need to wait it out.
It’s not as emotional as he’s expecting. They had their suspicions, of course, but everyone puts on a brave face to wish him well in the Majors, making their own drunken speeches as the night winds on to make sure Tony knows how much he’ll be missed.
Steve smiles tightly, fumbling with the key before getting them into the room. He lets Bucky collapse onto the bed, making sure he's careful not to land on his bad arm. “Until the end of the line, right?” Steve asks as he removes Bucky’s shoes for him before crawling into his own bed. He looks over at the outline of Bucky’s form in the darkness, realizing he's already passed out. “’Til the end of the line,” Steve repeats to himself before letting Bucky’s steady breathing lull him to his own fitful rest.
Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever figure Tony out. “You don’t have to pretend you’re something you’re not. I told you I don’t judge—”
Hotel security eventually forces the crowd to dissipate, letting them exit quietly out a back door. Tony leads him towards what might be the oldest car on the lot.
, Tony!” She finally bursts, getting to her feet. “I know you treat your entire career as some big joke, but this affects people’s livelihoods. I’ve held my tongue and let you make a mockery of this sport because it doesn’t mean a thing to you, but that’s ending now. You might have other options to fall back on, the family name, the company, your Masters’ and Doctorates and whatever other accolades you got from one of the most prestigious universities in the country, but that isn’t the case for 90% of the people here. Baseball is their
Suddenly, all the electricity in the apartment cuts out, a loud burst of electrical energy suddenly shutting off resounding around the apartment. There’s sounds of confusion from all the people in the room, as well as a few startled yelps at the sudden blackout. Tony turns semi-blinded and reaches for Steve, grabbing him by the collar and pulling him down into a kiss.
“Yeah?” Natasha arches an eyebrow and grabs his tie, waving it in front of his face in a flash of unexpected scarlet. “If I turn around and look at Tony is he going to be wearing your tie? You two just decided to sneak off somewhere to, what, switch up your wardrobe a bit?”
He doesn’t. Steve narrows his eyes and can’t stay seated any longer, knee aching a little when he stands. “What the hell do you mean? You can’t be coming back— That doesn’t— Why would you—” A deja vu of anger sweeps over him, reminded of the first time he was blindsided by his peers with the sudden addition of Tony Stark to their team. “Did they seriously sign you again without telling me?” He stalks back to the door, having no intent to apologize to Natasha for breaking the lock off of it. He could destroy everything in this office and still not consider things even between them after she betrayed his trust
Steve just snorts and busies himself with the menu. “You’re absolutely ridiculous, you know that right? And here I thought I was the one who was going to come across as overcompensating.”
your face being the first thing I woke up to in the morning. You invited me over for dinner and asked me how my day was despite the fact that we were together for most of it. You showed interest in my hobbies outside of baseball, and I started wanting to know about yours too. This stopped being an outlet for sexual frustration and turned into something I wasn’t at all prepared for! Hell, I can hardly even concentrate during games now because your stupid
“Not until he’s out of surgery, I’m afraid. You’re welcome to wait, I’ll have a nurse fetch you when he’s ready.”
“Listen, this is gonna be a long enough car ride, so why don’t we just cut the shit?” Bucky fixes a glare on him before turning his eyes ahead again. “Since I retired I’ve watched every single one of Steve’s games, which for the past few years, has meant I’ve also watched every single one of
“I think you were doing okay,” Steve places his hand on a comfortable position around her waist, taking her other hand in his. He’s never been a big dancer, but Natasha seems to know what she’s doing and is probably able to make his stepping in a circle look a lot more impressive than it is.
“Yes,” Tony affirms. “I’m here to play only if you’ll have me. I’m asking for your blessing, so to speak.”
Tony cleans up when they’re done, allowing Steve to quietly slip into the shower where Tony joins him after. There’s a little half-assed foreplay involved, but they’re both too exhausted after a hectic first day of Spring Training to really get anywhere past some open-mouthed kisses and lazy groping. Steve might be painfully aware of his age at times, but when Tony is a man in his prime and still finds Steve attractive even at fifty-two, he must be holding it together pretty well.
He and Tony haven’t spoken much to the public about their relationship. They don’t hide when they go out to dates in the city. They hold hands on the street. They make their appreciation known to fans and interviewers who support them but don’t offer any insight beyond that. Steve isn’t sure how to take on the role of an activist, but he doesn’t mind paving the way with Tony, Carol, and so many other strong individuals at his side.
His senses return to him slowly, first smelling something vaguely chemical-like, then tasting the dryness over his own mouth as well as something cooling that’s flowing through his airways. The dizziness begins to subside, needling pinpricks beginning at his fingertips and toes and slowly crawling up his extremities, the feeling of numbness fading away and being replaced by a slightly uncomfortable buzzing beneath his skin. He twitches his fingers on one hand, the other one still not cooperating yet. He stares down at it in annoyance, the feeling returning to his face and helping him realize there’s something strapped over his nose, mouth, and chin that blocks his vision. His neck feels stiff and hard to move, his frustration only growing at his plight.
He swallows and steps aside so the next person can be helped, rasping out a quiet thank you before taking his seat. He sits with his head in his hands, staring down between his feet.
“Let me help him,” Steve requests once he gets his wits about him, the medics now helping Bucky to his feet, placing his arm in a sling to keep it from being moved too much.
While there’s really only a handful of players left since Tony was last a part of the team— himself, Thor, Bruce, and Clint— The entire team has welcomed him back with open arms. Most of the controversy faded not long after Tony left the Knights, but they were all prepared for it to come back tenfold after today. Somehow (aka Janet’s expertise), they’ve been able to keep Tony being back on the team a secret from the media. Today is their first televised friendly, and the cat will be out of the bag once Tony is seen in the dugout, eventually taking center stage once he goes in as Peter’s relief.
Dr. Erskine told him to expect to play a few friendlies here and there up until April, when he’d most likely have to sit out for the rest of the season. These games, also known as exhibition games, had no weight on standings in the regular season, but were more like scrimmages to show off new players and ease teams into the season, letting them play some teams they normally wouldn’t get to as much in regular league play.
Steve makes a show of looking up towards the ceiling in thought. “Now, if only there was an immensely popular, successful, Major League Team in New York, full of promising, young, talented players and fresh management and leadership, strongly beloved or detested by all, that even non-baseball fans regard as one of the best teams…”
,” Tony answers softly. “Footprints in the Snow, with a little Arabesque No. 1 thrown in at the end… Debussy was my mom’s favorite.”
Steve jolts out of the memories suddenly, snapping his eyes open to meet total darkness. There’s a brief panic that everything that happened last night was actually all a dream, his deepest desires he didn’t realize he had coming true. He reaches out and gropes along the sheets, feeling nothing but a cold, empty space next to him.
when, as always, Tony pulled him right back in. After a sufficient media drought of the megalomaniac genius, he came back in full force. While the company exponentially grew, so did Tony’s notoriety as he graced tabloids time and time again with his presence, drunk out of his mind, spotted at countless gay clubs without a care in the world. Stories leaked of him being admitted to conversion therapy or rehab centers. Even though he had left the baseball realm behind him, most people refused to let go. He was still used as an example, and while some of the world was starting to develop tolerance, there were still plenty that continued to rake him over the coals.
“I s’pose not,” Tony mumbles, lifting his arm so his husband can snake one around his waist, pressing his back against Steve’s chest.
Tony licks his lips. “About all that stuff Hammer said… I-I just wanted you to know none of it’s true. I shouldn’t even have to defend myself but it was just a bunch of bullshit Hammer was making up to try and get under my skin— I mean, it worked, clearly, but I just don’t want you thinking that I’d ever—”
“I’ll join you in a bit. I think I owe Nat a dance,” he smiles, allowing his boyfriend to part from his side and put a little space between them. Hopefully the less perceptive guests won’t have noticed their joint disappearance.
The woman laughs, shaking her head. "Don't let Howard hyperbolize me. I run a large charity foundation is all."
Tiberius’ family owned a smaller manufacturing company that had been partnered with Stark Industries when they were kids, eventually being bought out and absorbed fully into the SI brand. They had a good relationship with the Stones, both their parents close friends and Tony and Tiberius being very close in age. One of the last boarding schools Tony had gone to only allowed him admission because of the Stones’ pull as donors and Tiberius being a star pupil. Despite Tony being a few years younger than him, they had struck up a friendly rivalry at the time, constantly fighting for top marks in their class— and once they got old enough to care about that sort of thing— attention from girls. Their paths had split once Tony went off to MIT and Ty went to business school, also becoming a star pitcher on the university’s baseball team. He was scouted immediately for the Majors out of college, always jokingly promising Howard over their dual family vacations to the villa in Florence that if he ever had to step down down he would play for the Irons.
Tony finally rolls to his feet, not even bothering to try and wipe the dirt off his uniform as he goes over to the dugout to switch out his bat for a glove. “Stark!” He hears Whitaker bark at him from the field. “Good job out there. Now put down the mitt, Denver’s subbing in for you.”
Tony wants to keep up the charade of self-righteousness, but he can’t help but feel that wave of sadness he’s been trying to keep at bay when he looks at Natasha’s expression. “...I heard you were the only other person fighting for me to stay.”
hate your guts, but I was also a hormonal, closeted teenager who grew up surrounded with magazines full of ripped, handsome, male baseball players. Can you blame me for sneaking some of your spreads out of my dad’s office to jerk off to?”
Steve doesn’t bother to answer Tony’s question as he’s fairly sure it’s rhetorical considering Tony is probably used to owning many, many things that are purely for aesthetics rather than functionality. “Water,” he points out instead. “Drink it.”
“Morning…” Steve replies, voice still rough with sleep. He scratches the back of his neck. “Uh, thanks for the clothes.”
“I’m not trying to guilt trip you, I’m just trying to make you think about this rationally,” Steve sits forward in his seat,
They haven’t even won yet— haven’t even tied— but that doesn’t stop the entire International team from surging out of the dugout to join in a celebratory pile-up on home plate as if they had. Steve had just knocked a ball all the way into the stands, bringing the score up to 7-9.
“And that’s a reasonable reaction to have, but you and I can both see Tony’s not himself right now, on or off the field. I mean, he doesn’t even
There’s a beat of silence after the accusation before Tony shoves at Steve’s chest with all the strength he has, Steve simultaneously releasing him and stepping back. Tony stumbles away from him, catching himself on the kitchen counter. For a moment, the only sound in the apartment is Tony’s labored breaths.
Tony whips his head around in surprise, gaze torn away from the pitcher. He’s been so focused on watching the Internationals that he didn’t realize the feats the PCL accomplished. Caught off guard, Tony quickly puts on his batting gloves and grabs his bat, getting into place off to the side of the foul lines. He looks up to the scoreboard and out across the infield to fill in the gaps he missed. They’ve scored two runs, currently have one out, with one man on base, and the batter down with two strikes. Okay, there's still a salvageable plan out of this. Their batter just needs to get a single on this next ball. That gives Tony plenty of wiggle room to get them both home. Him getting his own run is going to depend on the batter up after him, but he can hopefully at least get to second or third—
“I tried my damnedest to get him on the Yankees, but he was set on spending at least another season in the Minors,” Tony smiles, nudging him with his shoulder. “Too bad he’s so good that there’s no way the Majors can look him over now.”
Steve scoffs and knocks their knees together. “Hardly. I’m more worried you’ll die without me to look out for you.”
Howard laughs. "That cocky brat? Who knows with him. He's set to graduate from MIT next Summer, we'll see if he takes up any interest in playing after that."
“Steve’s straightforward to a fault sometimes. He thinks so big picture that he forgets all the little things. Maybe he didn’t think he needed to say it. He figured you already knew.”
Exhausted, Steve collapses onto his bed without even fully undressing. He’s still riding the high off the adrenaline from the drive, the unbelievable conversation he had with one of the most influential people in baseball, and the residual excitement of winning their final game of the regular season.
“Are you nervous about today?” Ty asks over the passing wind as they pedal down the bike lane side by side, occasionally drifting into a tighter, linear formation when they need to make room for other passersby.
He’s not a spiteful man. Quite the opposite, really. Steve doesn’t believe in holding grudges, not when you never knew where life would bring you next. From a young age he had learned to be grateful for every opportunity, every blessing he was given or earned. It did no one any good to linger on any kind of negative encounter, not with a world as big as theirs.
“Tony,” Steve chides gently, crawling into bed next to him. “Hey. Those papers will still be here tomorrow.”
“I told them to bring the essentials first. Plates aren’t that essential— what the hell do you think takeout boxes are for?”
Steve wraps bandages around Tony’s fingers and palms, layering the gauze without pulling too tight. “Why?” He asks, trying not to come across as too defensive.
The image is a little blurry because of Tony’s unsteady hands while holding the camera, but he’s right, it’s a pretty okay shot of him. Steve doesn’t love getting his picture taken, but there’s something soft and genuine in his expression as he looks directly into the lens— or rather, at the person behind it.
The cold post-practice shower is satisfying, but not quite the level of distraction Steve needs right now. He moves so slowly that by the time he's finished with his shower, there is no laughter or sounds echoing throughout the locker room. Everyone’s already packed up and gone home, probably excited for their day off tomorrow.
Janet probably did this on purpose to make sure Steve could keep an eye on Tony and also to make sure he didn’t end up in a room with some player who hated his guts. Everyone is supposed to be a united front for the All-Star game, but even Tony had his own is when he played for the PCL a couple of years ago. Some rivalries aren’t as easy to just lay aside.
Tony angrily shoves his chair back from the table, the sound of the metal on marble unforgiving to the ear. "You should have him show you the fucking
The only upside to having more talented pitchers on reserve is that it’s a lot less damaging to let Tony play the field a bit. Natasha experimented with this in the past, but ultimately made the right call in having Tony pitch, occasionally pulling the DH from the lineup so he could bat as well. While on the pitcher’s mound for the Knights, he’s in for about two to five innings. He and Carol experiment together to find the best infield option for him, hoping to improve some of his already incredible stats that have been stagnant during his time with the Avengers. He can hold his own across all the bases. On First, he can take advantage of left-handed throws, his flexibility, and receiving throws from across the field. He tags out batters before they can get to his base, helping stop the momentum of the other team before it can even get started. He can pivot on a double play while on Second, quick reflexes with his hands and feet following snap judgments needed in the middle of a play. He’s got an accurate arm for Third, and does well to defend the hot corner and get the ball to home when needed. Shortstop is the most challenging of all, and Tony is only able to keep up thanks to all the tips and tricks he’s learned from watching and working with Steve over the years.
behavior. Pierce had nearly ripped him to shreds in the green room afterwards, Hill and Coulson clearly upset but too shocked to berate him much. Pepper had been the only one on his side through it all, torn between telling Tony she was proud of him but worried for his well-being and timing of the announcement.
As much as he tries to ignore it, he knows Steve can smell something in the air. They’ve been practically living together during the last couple of months since their hectic game schedule came to an end, their belongings coalescing at each other’s apartments, though they tend to spend more time at Steve’s. It’s a little less visible to outside attentions, the neighbors not quite as privy to gossip. Tony hasn’t slept in his own bed alone in weeks, but after Janet’s meeting he keeps finding excuses to hole himself in the workshop and dodge Steve’s calls just so he can keep his thoughts away from his career.
“See you,” Steve waves casually. He waits until Peter exits through the doors to the lobby before he turns a knowing smile on Tony.
Natasha blows her whistle to get everyone to quiet down. “Start your warm ups for now, we can’t wait around all day. Rogers, you lead stretches.”
Greene throws the first curveball. Tony doesn’t even flinch. It’s a ball. He can feel sweat dripping down his brow and readjusts his helmet as he readies himself for the next pitch. He almost, almost swings, but decides not to last minute. A second ball. This sets a new plan in motion.
Tony is still yelling for Steve to stop when he pries the younger man's fingers away from the knob, forcing the door open. "I'm sorry, Tony, but I have to—" Steve freezes when he stumbles onto the scene.
“No worries, man. Maybe I’ll make it down for New Years. And, hey, call me if you need anything, alright?”
“Because I go back to sleep,” Tony explains as if it should be obvious. “Human sleep cycles actually changed during the nineteenth century. Neurologically speaking, many of the great inventors and craftsmen had a broken sleep schedule where they’d wake up in the middle of the night at the peak of creativity, and then sleep again until after dawn.”
There are blackout curtains keeping out all signs of light, which explains why Steve slept in so easily for once. In his own apartment, his curtains are gauzy and weak, really just there for show. The plastic blinds over his windows do very little to keep out the morning light, but here there’s thick fabric covering the floor-to-ceiling glass walls.
Before he can stop himself he’s streaking across the field, blowing right past a referee, Natasha, and the Irons’ third baseman who’s coming over to help. “Steve!” He drops down to his knees beside the man who’s still laying on his side. “Steve, are you okay? Can you get up?” He asks frantically, reaching out to help him back to his feet.
“It’s beautiful…” Steve leans in closer, coming to a stop with his nose pressed alongside Tony’s. They share breaths for a moment, Steve letting Tony make the decision to break through the last inch of space separating them. Tony kisses him as gingerly as he had played the song, no overtly sexual energy in the exchange, but the same butterflies are stirred up in Steve's stomach. He breaks the kiss, resting his forehead against Tony’s. “Will you play some more?”
"Ah, yes," Howard clicks the heels of his feet together, wiping a hand down his face. "I should take that. Steve," he claps the man on the back a little harder than necessary. Steve is starting to catch on that that's just how Howard does everything. "It's getting late so feel free to take your pick of the spare bedrooms, or you can head downstairs and we'll have a driver take you back to the hotel."
Steve loops the bandages down to his wrists, taking his time with securely fastening them there. “What does she think not PR-wise?”
“Better come back here quick, we can’t get the show on the road without you!” Bucky calls after him teasingly as he heads for the door.
“Oh, Steve!” she exhales in relief, immediately wrapping her arms around him in a hug. She’s practically shaking in his arms and he doesn’t release her after she pulls out of the hug, leaving a steadying hand on her elbow. “They said he’s still in surgery— do you know what happened? How long have you been here?”
Unforgiving, Tony continues to piston into him, chasing after his own climax. Steve lifts a knee to support himself against one of the lower shelves of the rack, hearing it groan in protest as he puts more of his weight onto it, body jerking forward with every one of Tony’s thrusts. He twists around the best he can, not as flexible as he used to be, but flexible enough to grab Tony by his shirt and drag him closer. He covers Steve’s back with his body, wrapping both of his arms around him to keep them locked impossibly close together. The angle is perfect now, Tony swearing dirty promises against Steve’s ear as their panting intermingles. The oversensitivity makes him dizzy, his body instinctually tightening up at the intrusion from behind. That’s all it takes for Tony to finally crest over that edge, his teeth sinking into the back of Steve’s neck to muffle his cries of pleasure, hips still jackhammering into him to ride out his orgasm. If Steve were any younger, he’d probably be getting hard again already. His refractory period just isn’t what it used to be, which doesn’t bother him aside from the fact that his much younger partner tends to bounce back rather quickly. Wearing Tony out is no small feat, and one that Steve finds plenty of pleasure in when he takes up the challenge.
Steve can’t even complain that there’s no room for foreplay, already impossibly hard beneath his trousers as he does as he’s told. He spreads his legs slightly, leaning against the metal rack as he feels one of Tony’s hands slide over the hard line of his cock over his pants. He lets out a breathy moan as Tony undoes his fly for him and pushes his pants and underwear down around his thighs. He bends forward, back arching already as he feels slicked up fingers tease between his legs, sliding from his balls up over his ass, barely ghosting along where he wants them most.
Steve ignores his pleas, still furious about the entire situation. Tony is protecting this woman to save his own dignity or for some other reason that Steve can't think of. Meanwhile, she’s manipulating and putting Tony at risk just for a story. He can't let that slide.
He finds himself slipping outside about an hour before midnight. He, along with everyone else, is significantly hammered (minus the few unlucky bastards who volunteered as DDs for the night). He stood amidst Steve and some of the older vets on the team who had also stepped down from the Majors and had nothing but sage words of wisdom to offer to Tony about the differences in the leagues. After about two minutes of the well-meaning advice, he had zoned out, standing there with polite nods and smiles before excusing himself for a smoke.
“It’s okay, I’m glad you’re home safe…” He hugs Tony tightly for a few moments before holding him at arm’s distance to lock eyes. “Please don’t ever do that again. That was dangerous, Tony.”
He walks through the crowds of mixed jerseys, everyone here supporting different teams and players from across the entire MiLB. Thought it isn’t really a Yankees game, the fact that they’re hosting brings plenty of blue and white jerseys for Steve to blend in with. He’s hardly the only person there with STARK and 42 blazoned across his back, but that doesn’t stop the occasional fan from recognizing him and asking for an autograph or a picture.
“Why are you bringing so much?” Steve questions in disbelief. Despite the judgement and annoyance written across his face, he still walks over to where Tony’s extra suitcase is sitting with three garment bags stacked on top of it. “We won’t even be gone for that long.”
He numbly stares down at the words typed out for them, echoing them back to Coulson in a monotone. The man sighs. “Tony… You have to at least try. We need this to be believable, remember?” He places a hand on his shoulder, lowering his voice slightly. “There are people who love and support you. Don’t forget that. We just need you to sell the lie for right now.”
Tony smiles up at him, easily shifting back to a sitting position. He combs his fingers through Steve’s hair one last time, pressing a kiss to the edge of his jaw. “So the student becomes the master…”
“M’Tired,” he mumbles, tongue feeling heavy in his mouth. He lets out a few irritated grunts, struggling to speak around the mask planted over his face, still blowing air into him.
Steve nods, sharing her bittersweet smile. Whatever disputes they had about Steve’s exit, it’s in the past. “All is forgiven, Peggy. I miss the Stars all the time, but I don’t think I miss the majors as much as I thought I would.”
"It's not a pity look," Steve denies, looking down at his hands instead. He hates talking about Buck's injury. He doesn’t even like thinking about it. Steve knew he hadn't been playing the same ever since Bucky got hurt, no matter how many times his captain and coach tried to reassure him that isn't so. In the end, it really didn’t matter. His time with the Stars feels long behind him now. "What are you doing here anyway, Buck? I thought you weren't getting back in town until the weekend."
Tony scoffs. “We’re all not like you, Rogers. Emotions and sex don’t mix for some of us. There’s a thing that exists in the world that we live in called
The snow is still coming down in huge flakes, an abrupt gust of wind picking them up and blowing them directly into Steve’s face every now and again as he jogs down the street. Most of the sidewalks have been recently maintained, but he still has to be careful to dodge any icy patches. The roads are an absolute mess, traffic lower than Steve usually sees it as he runs the few blocks to Tony’s apartment, knowing he can get their faster on foot than a cab can make it in the inclement weather. He realizes halfway through the trek what a stupid idea this is, the biting cold tugging at his clothes and snow coming down impossibly hard. There’s supposed to be a blizzard that hits overnight, the promise of additional feet of snow already making itself known as it piles down around Steve.
Steve nods, pressing his lips together. “Thank you, Maria. I promise I’ll do my best. Tony’s a good kid, I at least know that much.”
“Quill?” Tony wrinkles his nose and stares down into the cup suspiciously. “Should we test for laxatives?”
She stares at him for a few more seconds before shrugging and walking over to the couple’s table to get them a refill on their pitcher. Tony glances out of the corner of his eye as he sips on his cheap whiskey. The bearded men are staring at him now, muttering something back and forth to each other. He can't tell what they’re saying, but the pinched expressions on their faces can’t mean it’s anything good. So he won’t be asking
He turns, slowly, to face Tony again, taking him all in. He opens his mouth to speak and Steve holds up a hand, side-stepping towards a chair. “Just… Shut up. For a second.”
Thor is the culprit yet again when Tony is hoisted into the air, now being lifted by many strong hands all around him until he finds a seat on Steve’s shoulders. He kisses the award and holds it out to the crowd, pointing as he’s spun around in slow circles. A few of the players chase Rezzo down with the water hose before it gets turned on Tony, soaking him and Steve both. He has half a mind to strip off the wet uniform and take a victory lap around the field in his underwear, but he decides to save Janet the aneurism just this once.
"Here," Pepper hands him a comb, not looking up from her folder as she crosses out more names on the PCL roster.
“Steve!” He hears Tony call out through the crowd, spinning around wildly to try and see him. He can’t tell exactly where the voice is coming from.
The man is an old grizzled type, and it would be just Tony’s luck that out of the four refs mixed from each league, this one happens to belong to the PCL. He stands with crossed arms, staring indifferently at Tony before he glances over at Hammer. “Zip it and let the kid throw the ball.”
Tony’s gaze sharpens, nose wrinkling as he frowns. “Didn’t really want to listen to people praise my abusive dickhead of a father all day. Any reason you didn’t go? You’re the son he always wanted, you had way more of a right to be there than I did.”
The Avengers manage to match each run, the game already tied at 4-4 going into the second inning, essentially putting Tony in the exact same position he started in. His first two pitches go
"Brilliant idea!" Peggy claps her hands together. "Is that okay with you, Tony? Steve and I go way back."
Although seeing Steve standing at the front of the line-up with his shoulders squared and a determined spark in his eye tells him that maybe his newfound love for the sport has a different source.
Steve smiles politely through the conversation, not knowing how to contribute otherwise. He can’t exactly picture an MIT student being athletic enough to make it in the big leagues. And Howard thinks his son would want to play professionally after that level of education? Steve's head spins just thinking about the years of schooling one would have to go through to achieve all that. The MLB isn't exactly looking to recruit people of Steve's age or older with no prior minor league experience.
,” Rhodes corrects, arms crossed. “And it shows. You’re just out there throwing what you think is a good pitch.”
He doesn’t hear anything for a few moments before Tony walks into the foyer, carrying a book in his hands. “Morning,” he says noncommittally, not looking up from the worn paperback in his hands.
She nudges his foot playfully and drops the subject. Thankfully, no one brings up the assault, his condition, or the World Series. Tony lets Steve and Peggy just talk and fill him in on everything he’s been missing out on the past few months while he isolated himself with drink and work, forgetting the people who ever actually meant something to him. He slips his bandaged hand into Steve’s as he eats, letting the man feed him French fries and wipe ketchup from his chin.
“What is there to discuss?” He asks, taking a few strides back towards her desk. “You asked three weeks ago if I was staying on another season and I said yes. I had Pepper send the paperwork over, already signed and sealed. There is no further
Tony just nods along with it. “Ah, it was sort of a last minute decision. We don’t need anything special tonight though, just showing my Captain here the ropes,” he jerks his head over to where Steve is standing awkwardly off to the side.
Tony’s heels dig sharply into his back as his entire body bows outward, Steve leaning back to watch his face as he falls over that edge. His flushed prick is straining upwards against his belly, bobbing between them as Tony continues to bounce on his cock. “With me,” Steve pants out, grabbing onto Tony’s hip with one hand to keep him seated fully, grinding himself up against that sweet little gland inside of him. “Come with me.”
“We’ll see,” Tony hums and very gently pushes Steve’s hand off his thigh. He avoids his gaze, staring out of the window for the rest of the ride.
Rhodey takes a step back, placing his arm on Steve's shoulder. "Whoa, buddy, what's the rush? Last I saw him he was heading back to his room." Steve takes off running before Rhodey can say anymore.
“You caveman. Fire bad,” Tony replies sarcastically but picks up the glass and dutifully downs the whole thing in a few chugs, wiping his hand off on the back of his mouth. He starts to actually look around the apartment now, Steve realizing it’s the first time Tony’s ever been over to his place. He doesn’t really have any guests other than Bucky, but he’s at least glad the flat is relatively clean and organized. “What are you reading?” He asks suddenly.
him. It’s sad, really. “Hilarious, Stark, really, so funny. Always something to say— I don’t know how your new team puts up with you.”
“Steve,” Tony interrupts with a sense of urgency that immediately quiets his captain. Tony looks tired. “I’m… I’m sort of done talking about this.”
Steve watches his best friend crash to the ground, carried by the momentum of his throw. “Bucky!” he immediately sprints over to him, his heartbeat pounding in his ears, drowning out the sounds around him. He has no idea how the game is unfolding, falling to his knees next to Bucky who’s now on his back, clutching his arm.
“Oh shut up,” Steve huffs, covering Tony’s face with his hand and shoving him away. “I’m starting to regret having this conversation.”
She ushers them to their usual two-person table in the corner, lanterns of different shapes and sizes hanging down over them. “Do you boys need menus or you’ll be having the usual?”
Steve nods. "Upstate. We were extremely poor growing up. My dad wasn't around for too long and my mom worked tons of jobs just to make ends meet. I loved Brooklyn, but it was always my dream to one day have enough money that I could buy a house for me and my mom in the country upstate. A big yard, white picket fence, porch with a swing, all that good stuff."
Steve clinks his glass with everyone within an arm’s reach, grinning so hard that he doesn’t even care when he feels some of the liquid slosh out onto his hand. He’s so proud in that moment and when he turns to his best friend, he swears he can see tears glistening in Bucky’s eyes.
“Steve?” Bucky calls softly when he gets a knob on the door. “Good luck next week. I know I’ll see you before the series starts, but… I just wanted to tell you now.”
“Do you really have to shake these?” Tony asks as the piece of film develops, pinching one corner carefully between two fingers.
Steve raises his head to see Peggy standing at the counter, looking just as wrecked as he probably did. It’s been a long time since he’s last had time to see Peggy, too long. He notices streaks of grey in her dark chocolate locks that are pulled away from her face in a hasty bun, her appearance not nearly as put together as Steve is so used to seeing her. She must’ve been woken up in the middle of the night because of this.
“Nah, you did good, man,” he pats Steve on the back, a thoughtful look then crossing his face. “So what did you do to keep him distracted long enough for us to get everything set up?”
He hears his house guest come tromping back down the stairs, the banister squeaking in protest while he swings around it like he’s in a musical and comes bounding towards the kitchen in the back of the house.
“This was a last minute decision,” Natasha starts slowly, pressing her fingers into her temple. “Janet has been going back and forth with Pepper Potts since November. Tony apparently wanted to leave the Irons for another Triple-A team and both Fury and Van Dyne saw it as an opportunity. The kid wanted to keep it on the down low, and his old man and Fury go way back or something. Fury did it as a favor to Howard Stark.”
“Thanks,” he mouths. Even though it’s Steve’s job to try and get as many players out as possible, Tony likes to think that this one in particular was just for him.
“The foresight on that one is commendable,” Tony murmurs, happily crunching on the celery. “D’you have fun last night?”
After some time splashing his face with cold water and crying into the sink, Steve returns to Tony’s room. Doctor Hallstatt is gone now, leaving just Peggy, still holding Tony’s hand with her head resting on the bed, shoulders visibly heaving with sobs. Steve wordlessly pulls a chair up next to her and rubs her back until her crying eventually ceases.
“Whatever. I’m going to shower and get this plane stink off, then we’re going out,” Tony hangs his suits in the closet before slipping into the bathroom.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark,” the man, Coulson, says, giving him a vigorous handshake while his counterpart just gives a gentle shake and polite nod in greeting.
Her eyes dart up, but don’t meet his, instead landing somewhere past his shoulder. He turns around, realizing that her office isn’t empty. Every last bit of air escapes his lungs. He feels like he’s been punched through his chest— Being punched through his chest would feel less painful than what he’s experiencing right now.
Tony’s right, he is alone right now, but he still has plans tomorrow to drive upstate and spend Christmas Day with Bucky. Tony doesn’t have anyone after an impossibly tough year. Impulsively, Steve hangs up the phone and immediately goes over to the door to pull his snow boots back on. In his surprise to speak to Tony at all, Steve realizes he also completely forgot to thank him for such a thoughtful gift. He places the camera back in the box and tucks it under one arm, haphazardly throwing on his scarf and hat before exiting the apartment.
“You have to go,” Tony whispers against his lips. His eyes are closed and he refuses to open them just yet. Not until he’s gone. He wants to remember his last sight of Steve as the sincere expression on his face, eyes full of love and surprise as Tony leans in to kiss him out in the open, all unbridled affection and heartfelt abandon.
Steve’s heart sinks. As complicated as Tony’s relationship had been with his parents, this would be the first year he would be spending the holidays with absolutely no family around him. “You’re spending Christmas by yourself?”
Tony collapses onto the hotel bed in exhaustion, happy that Hill and Coulson let him pay extra so that he gets his own suite. He’ll occasionally share a room with Ty, but that also usually means waking up at 5 a.m. to go for a jog before the game. They’ve been on a traveling streak for away games and Tony just doesn’t have it in him.
Tony breaks out of the holds of the two women, stepping forward. He feels Natasha grab at the back of his suit jacket to stop him, Hammer also jumping back by a step. He doesn’t look scared of Tony at all, smarmy grin still on his face. “Hey, hey, hey, I’m being sincere! It’s
"Or what, you'll break the door down? It'll come out of your paycheck, buddy," Tony says through grit teeth, his strength no match for Steve's.
Tony seems lost in contemplation as he pushes around the scrambled eggs on his plate. “I mean, that’s kind of a redundant question, don’t you think?” Tony asks, a wry smile gracing his face without any light in it touching his eyes. “I don’t really think I ever wanted to play baseball professionally. I didn’t even play as a kid.” Steve does realize what a silly question it is, even if it’s just an attempt to try and get Tony to open up. He remembers his conversation with Howard years ago about how Tony had no interest at all in picking up a glove and a bat.
Steve looks up from the photograph to see Tony only a few inches away from him, sitting beside him with his legs crossed, brown eyes open and earnest. They look too focused, almost unnaturally so. Even Steve is sure his gaze is a little more glossy at this point, and he hardly has anything on Tony as far as inebriation went. He feels his mouth go dry, tongue flickering out to wet his lips. “I didn’t want you to be alone?” He doesn’t mean it to come out as a question, voice sounding thin and unsure.
He expects Tony to pull away from him. He’s always manifested his emotions physically, but for once, he’s completely still. They’ve both grown since that argument over whether or not he should leave the Avengers so many years ago, especially Tony. Steve watches as his eyes flicker, unsurely absorbing Steve’s reasoning and weighing them in his mind. It’s a mature thing to do, accept someone else’s opinion on a matter that affects your own life, and it’s one of the many things they’ve been able to teach each other over the years.
The tension is so high that Tony finds out later about a dozen spectators needed to be checked out by medics from the stress of watching it all unfold. He and Thor are grabbing onto each other’s jerseys as what could very well be their last batter steps up. He hits his first pitch impeccably, and their base runner on second makes the snap decision to run for home. Everyone is on the edge of their seats as the game plays out, Tony about ready to burst out of his skin. Not only are they about to win this entire All-Star Game, but Tony is going to get the added satisfaction of the fact that the PCL only used two of it’s three pitchers, leaving Hammer without a single second of playtime. It’s poetic justice, really.
"New gear is one thing, but this kid openly trashes the hard work and effort these athletes pour into the game," The newscaster looks into the camera now. "Just a refresher, this was the statement Tony Stark made after last season."
“Don’t take it personally,” Steve sighs, oiling up his glove. “He’s been stubborn about his elbow since we were kids. You’re not just preaching to the choir, Doc—” Steve tosses the oil back in before shutting his locker and brushing past the man. “You’re preaching to the whole damn congregation.”
“Stark, head out of the clouds, Coach wants you warmed up and ready to go,” Strange snaps at him, waving him over. Tony has always felt like the guy kind of resents him, but it’s not his fault he showed up and is a better pitcher than the guy playing in the Triples after recovering from hand-related injuries. He’s a clever man and a decent pitcher, but he’ll probably never be able to make it past this league with his inconsistencies in ability.
Steve sets down his empty mug and moves Tony’s feet off of him to fetch the camera. He pulls it out of the box, letting the strap hang loosely as he walks back over to the couch and points the camera at a stone-faced Tony who has shifted into a lax sitting position, a throw blanket pulled off the back of the couch and into his lap. “Smile, Tony,” he chides.
He eventually lets Tony’s legs fall to the side, his softening cock slipping free as both of them get their feet back from under them. “
"Yep, Master’s in physics and engineering. Talks about working on a doctorate after graduation too."
Tony’s fists clench deep in his pockets and he hopes Hammer doesn’t notice. He flickers his eyes over the rest of the Irons players— Kanes, Wellens, and Longoria. “Well the PCL really must be lacking if they let you lot play in the All-Star game. But I guess the Irons try to whore out anyone what with their star player being gone.”
"It's alright. The real problem in my lap now is to try and find a capable enough manager," she laughs then jokingly adds. "You want to interview for the position?"
“Yeah, well I certainly don’t make it easy on them now do I?” Tony responds easily, unwilling to give Hammer any sort of satisfaction. At this point, the rest of the group seems to be humoring him as well.
for a moment during the extended break time. His hands are shaking as he stands in front of the sink, clutching at the porcelain until his knuckles turn a similar shade.
He's been pretty good these past few weeks about not lashing out at everyone trying to help him. His physical therapy training with Dr. Erskine is slow-going, but going all the same. For a while, it was impossible for even Steve to try and keep him rational about the situation, but he eventually came around. For the first few times, Steve would just drop him off and pick him up, but lately Bucky has allowed him to come in towards the tail end of each session.
He doesn’t get to the ball in time to get the batter out, diving forward to catch it on its first bounce. Steve watches at Bucky twists his body around, his arm arcing back and lashing forward with all the power he had to get the ball in to home. Steve has the only set of eyes in the entire stadium that doesn’t follow the path of the ball to see where it ends up, his gaze locked on Bucky’s face as it twists in pain.
Before Steve can ask for some elaboration, Bucky pushes himself away from the wall, heading over to where Dugan is standing. “What’s Barnes’ deal?” Jack asks, still fresh having just gone on as pitcher.
“And go against my old man’s dying wish?” Tony asks with a lop-sided grin. “Wasn’t really expecting that answer from you, Cap.”
“Tony, you have to share rooms all the time when we travel, I thought you would’ve gotten used to it by now,” Steve sighs, moving past him to start putting some of his things away on one side of the room. “Just be happy you’re rooming with someone you know and not a stranger.”
"Why not now?" Steve suggests, raising his eyebrows at Tony. "I'm sure you can afford another plate on the bill, right?"
"I'd have to disagree," Steve laughs. It's kind of satisfying to see Tony's ego knocked down a peg every now and then.
Even if Tony doesn’t walk away from his time with the Avengers with all the glory he’s desperate to reach in attempts to prove himself to the country, at least he’ll have a good workout regimen to keep in mind. He’s never been in as good of shape as he is now thanks to Natasha’s brutal training programs. It also might have something to do with the fact that he can’t skip out on practices as much as he used to when Obie was his coach and left him to his own devices as long as he could cinch them a win.
“Yeah, but I retired for health reasons. S’Different,” Bruce shrugs, leaving Tony to fend for himself.
“You can’t be here,” Dr. Erskine says, his voice strained as he walks over to block Steve from coming further into the room.
“Not until you,” he answers honestly. He had plenty of guys back in the day tease him about being a homo or a fag just because he didn’t express his interest in women as outwardly as they did. It never really bothered him back then, but he also didn’t consider any kind of validity to their remarks.
“I’m good,” Steve promises, looking up at all of them. Tony and the medic get their arms around him to haul all 200 pounds of him to his feet. He holds a hand up to the medic who immediately turns her attention on his knee, her hand curling around the back of it.
It’s a solid hit with the bat, the ball coming right back towards Tony. It bounces once on the ground before he jumps forward to catch it. He knows he has the chance to get it to first and get a possible out, but he instead pivots in the opposite direction and fires the ball to third.
showing something other than total despondence. “You’ve got an incredible talent, can you fault me and the people who love you for wanting to see how much more you can be if you let yourself? The Tony I know wouldn’t just throw it all away for nothing, so why are you?”
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets, the fall chill nipping at his exposed skin. He turns to look at Steve who’s standing a few feet back, giving him his space. “What do you expect me to do here, talk to the air?” Tony grumbles.
If Tony thinks some inappropriate language and unconventional scare tactics are going to push Steve away, he’s sorely mistaken. If there’s one thing Steve Rogers isn’t, it’s a pushover. Even if Tony doesn’t want someone to pour his heart out to, he doesn’t want Tony to block him out because of this incident.
“I insist on paying, buddy,” Tony smiles and pulls a wad of hundreds out of his pocket, sliding it into the man’s pocket. “I’ll start with some gin and tonics and you can keep them coming. Steve?”
There is no time to panic. Tony looks over his shoulder at Whitaker. “We’re up by three, you still gonna hold me to this stupid deal?”
Tony passes out as soon as they get back from dinner (on his own bed this time) and manages to sleep soundly until Steve’s alarm rouses him for Game Day. They have to get down to the field bright and early for the pre-game interviews, but then it’s go time.
Tony’s new bodyguard is waiting when they arrive at the hotel, helping Steve with the wheelchair and quickly ushering them inside. They released a fake “source” yesterday that Tony would be staying at a different hotel on the other side of Manhattan, just to throw the media off the trail and make sure he didn’t get swarmed the moment they left the hospital.
He wakes up a few hours later with the comforter damp underneath him. The cottage is warm, Steve most likely turning up the heat to protect Tony from pneumonia. The master bedroom door is open, the thick smell of maple and sausage filtering in from the kitchen. He dresses himself in a comfortable, worn-in pair of light wash jeans and a cream sweater, pulling on some woolen socks before letting his growling stomach lead the way.
The guy looks him over and sighs. "Sure, I think he's out on the balcony." He scooches out of the way enough for Steve to enter the suite.
thing, for obvious reasons. I can’t be open and honest with who I really like or my life would be over, and I also can’t expect anyone to keep things a secret so… I just don’t do things to get attached.” He shifts slightly, looking over his shoulder at Steve. “I think you shouldn’t overthink it. Things are the same between us as they were before, they’re just a little more fun now. Let’s just keep things on the down low, enjoy what we’ve got, and not let anything get too serious beyond that, yeah?”
Steve finally obliges, placing one hand on the back of Tony’s head as he leans away from him and begins to pump his hips in earnest. The sound of wet skin slapping against wet skin is amplified in the room, the sounds of their misconduct echoing around them and making it all the more thrilling. Tony’s hands scrabble against the slick wall as Steve fucks him from behind, slowly sliding until he’s practically bent at a ninety-degree angle, breathy moans punched out of him with every thrust. Steve’s grip on his hair tightens, finally giving in to what Tony craves. He yanks his head back, earning a delightful sound tearing its way from Tony’s throat as he quickens his pace, letting all his pent-up frustration from the day out.
“I know you were,” Steve sighs, expression softening as Tony relaxes in his arms and falls back into REM sleep. The stairwell is narrow, but he manages to carefully make his way down the metal steps without jostling Tony too much or taking a tumble himself. The smaller den area beneath the loft is a bit more cozy than the formal living room out by the main entrance. There’s a rectangular space lowered into the floor by a couple of steps, Steve gently setting Tony down in an armchair with pillows on it that at least look cozier than the angular leather couch in the other room.
“Captain Rogers,” Obadiah gives him a firm shake before patting Tony twice on the back, hard enough to send him towards Steve by a couple of steps. “You take care of this one, alright? He may be an Avenger now, but he’ll always be my boy. I taught him everything he knows.”
Natasha shakes her head. “I’m going to respectfully disagree with you there. Honestly, I don’t know how you didn’t lose all your hair after one kid, let alone three.”
Her voice is calming. A life preserver tossed to him in the middle of a hurricane on the sea. He grasps at it with weak fingers. “Uh… Huh…”
“How does your knee feel?” Tony asks after his hunger is sated, now able to properly think straight again.
with the team that I was happy with, because it was good for my career. So much for that, right?” he laughs bitterly, shaking his head. “Now I don’t even have that to hang on to, but I don’t have any fucking choice. And as if worrying about my baseball life wasn’t enough, now we know I have to fear for my
