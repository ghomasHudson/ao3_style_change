Thank you for being so patient and understanding! ❤️
Steve chuckles softly. “That is also tempting. No, I’ll be okay. Maybe after some cake.”
“I won’t. I’m not like the alphas that will have you cook and clean all day. This isn’t the fort-never mind. Sorry.”
Tony fumbles with his belt, the excitement of getting to properly breed this omega becoming too much. He slides his slacks and underwear down, his cock bobbing free and smacking the omega’s ass. The omega groans, desperately trying to bring himself closer to the alpha’s cock.
“Don’t apologize. I’m not leaving you. We’re doing this together, remember? I’m staying.”
Morgan was sure that would all stay the same. Until her baby brother was born.
Natasha hugs Steve next. “Congratulations, Steve. Guess you need something blue.”
Tony nods but doesn’t dare push the topic of Steve’s death. Obviously it was too touchy of a subject for Peter to even talk about it. If it was ever brought up he found ways to skirt past it.
“Mr. Stark-”
Steve smiles. “Yeah. He’s my brother. Just like Harley is yours. You need to be nicer to him, Pete,” Steve says then he turns to his oldest. “And you mister need to do the same. I know it was you who broke his LEGO set.”
“Okay,” Tony agrees and Peter cheers. “But no goofing off. This is a serious project.”
Steve glances at him for a second before turning away and casting his gaze down. Tony blows out a breath. He was making things worse. He just knew it.
Tony grunts when he reaches his release and he spills his third load inside Steve’s body. Steve follows soon after, moaning out Tony’s name when he comes.
He needs another distraction. Something that’s going to take Steve’s memory away for good. Tony laughs at himself. Steve was never going to go away. He was always going to be there, haunting Tony for the rest of his life. Maybe Tony deserved that. He deserved that kind of pain.
Tony rises to his feet and lifts Steve up to his own. “Can you walk?” Tony asks when Steve stumbles forward.
“Like his mama.”
Steve nods and directs his attention back on Morgan. He sniffs. “I don’t want to let her go. She’s my baby.”
Tony moves toward him and leans back against the island, folding his arms over his chest, the envelope getting tucked under his arms. “I’m sorry about the other night. I didn’t mean to...it’s just hard talking about them.”
Steve chuckles and kisses Tony again, then he leaves the kitchen and disappears to the living room to start the movie.
“No. I wish I did. I would’ve learned about you a lot sooner. I’m so sorry.”
“Shit,” Sam is the next to say. “So you were-this whole time!”
Peter whimpers, his face contorting again in distress, only to relax when Tony continues talking to him.
He reads the letter everyday. It kills him.
Tears have gathered in Steve’s eyes now and despite his best efforts to keep them from falling, he can’t hold them back and they roll freely down his face. He tries to pull his hand away to wipe at them, but Tony brings his hand back.
Tony grimaces. “Guess I’ll have to fill in the blanks.”
When Tony gets back up to his penthouse, he doesn’t drink. He feels proud of himself for not reaching for the bottle. It was progress.
“-we’re close. Probably the closest we’ve ever been. We’ve actually been better than ever and-”
“Peter, you’re kinda scaring me,” Ned’s worried tone is what has Peter finally facing his friend. Tears spring to his eyes and Peter quickly looks away, his eyes squeezing shut.
Tony smiles and kisses his son’s cheek. “Yeah it does. Good job, squirt. Maybe one day you can help daddy build more, hmm? Maybe one for mama?”
Tony lies back and Steve hovers over him, their lips never parting. Steve breaks away to attach his lips to Tony’s neck, emitting a soft sigh from his husband. Tony groans and tangles his fingers in Steve’s hair, tugging harshly when Steve bites and sucks along the sensitive skin on his neck.
With his eyes closed again, Tony drifts in and out of consciousness. It’s not until someone is taking his hand and squeezing it tenderly does Tony force himself awake. The light is still blinding and he gives himself a moment to adjust to its brilliance.
“I do it!” Peter tries again to take the bag. With a huff Steve gives in before Peter decides this is the morning to scream. He keeps one hand on the bag to help pour in the chips.
Until it didn’t.
“Hey, kiddo you’re okay. I don’t know what you’re making a big fuss for,” Tony speaks softly to his son. He brings his son closer to his chest, hoping the closeness would ease Peter’s discomfort. Peter responds by turning his head, mouth opening and closing as he searches for something Tony can’t give.
“This isn’t going to be easy.” Those words are meant for himself, but Bucky picks up on them.
He’s reminded of the family he still has, but sometimes they weren’t enough. He wanted his parents to be together, and for the team to be reunited. But it would never be reality. His parents were gone and his family would always be broken. No matter how hard he tried he could never put the pieces back together.
“Wait, you’re not mad?” Peter looks back and forth between his uncles.
“T-Tony?” Steve hates how timid he sounds. He never used to be this way around other alphas. In fact he vividly remembers standing up to the ones who tried to make him feel like he was of little significance. But those days were part of the past. He needed to respect alphas if he wanted to be treated right.
Tony smiles. Steve wasn’t one to pass on any sort of activity with their son. Watching movies and catching up on the films he’s missed with Peter was one of his favorites.
“Cookies it is!” Tony decides, making sure to send a wink Steve’s way when the omega frowns.
Her eyes dart down to where he’s holding his middle, then up to his eyes again. She’s gentle when she touches him, but even her soft touch forces him to cry out. Blood spills from the deep cut above his belt and Natasha replaces his hand with her own, not caring if his blood coats her skin.
“I didn’t know you had one of those.”
“Captain?” Jarvis pipes up and Steve naturally glances up at the ceiling. He can tell by the tone of voice the AI takes on that he was going to get a lecture. He’s heard Jarvis concerned and he never hesitated to let Tony or any of the others know that he was worried. Sometimes Steve would forget that Jarvis wasn’t human.
The sound of Alpha’s palm connecting with his cheek echoes in the room. Steve instantly grows silent. He opens his eyes, immediately regretting doing so when they connect with cold blue ones. They’ve gotten darker; the pupils are almost black.
“Whatever,” Tony grumbles and slips on his own shirt. He climbs out of bed to search for the rest of the clothing, ignoring the attempts Steve makes at talking to him. “I said it’s fine!” Tony snaps.
Steve sneaks out of the room and rushes back toward the table where their forgotten plates of food remained. He grabs the knife from his own plate. He sets his gaze down the hall, an idea forming in his mind. One stab with the knife and it would be over. His abuser would be gone.
“No,” Bucky shakes his head. “I’m going. You can stay with Pete.”
“You know it’s not always about you.” Tony sits up quickly and turns to face Steve. “I get that you’re tired or you’re annoyed or whatever, but I’m just as tired as you are. I’m fucking pregnant!”
“In the meantime, look over those contracts. That’s still your job.”
“I-I don’t know. Tony never said-”
“But you and me...Tony, were just the ingredients for their recipe. We’re the key to their perfect creation.”
Tony doesn’t bring up the fact that Steve had called him multiple times a day and wrote him more than just a few letters. It was obvious Peter didn’t know the full story. Tony wasn’t ready to share it with him yet.
Bucky switches and makes a fist with his metal hand, then he digs it into the spot Steve was complaining about the most. Steve lets out another pleasurable moan. It paid to have a friend with a metal arm.
“Can we just talk about this? Please?”
“You were supposed to be mom. And if this kid is stubborn it’s your fault. Stubborn is your middle name,” Tony shoots back.
“Tell him that,” Natasha spats, her eyes narrowing in Bucky’s direction.
Tony nods and watches as Steve disappears from the room. He returns his attention back to the movie, but every now and then his eyes travel toward the stairs, waiting for his husband to come back.
For ten minutes Peter and Tony were going back and forth asking each other questions. It was a fun little way for them to really get to know each other. So far Peter’s only learned a few facts about his dad. It was progress.
“You finally did it.” Bucky smiles and he steps closer to his friend to properly congratulate him. “Congrats, pal.”
Without Steve leading them, they were forced to part and head their separate ways. The tower has never felt so empty. So lonely.
Tony nods and rises to his feet, making his way to the kitchen to fill his own glass.
“You can’t lift heavy things, Rogers,” Natasha scolds, her lips forming into a scowl. Steve rolls his eyes, and with a huff, leaves the bag to hang. “And it is a good thing. A baby isn’t the end of the world.”
Tony scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Good. He should be scared.”
Peter sighs. “Sorry. I am happy…I think.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s staying with his aunt and he’s not surprised it’s her who questions him. He appears dressed for school, but school was the last thing on his mind. It would be a good distraction from his home life, and he did miss his best friend. He’d go to school tomorrow. But first he needed to find out about his dad.
Peter shakes his head and slips himself free from the shield. “Then if I get to make the decision...I choose you. He wanted you to have this. I know he did.”
Steve moves toward another poster, but before he can make a comment about it, a soft knock on the door interrupts and the doctor steps inside.
“Go to sleep, Steve,” Tony whispers. “He’ll be up soon.”
“Sorry,” Steve murmures and kisses Tony’s cheek. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”
Steve sighs and rolls over onto his side, wincing from the tenderness that still lingers. “I’m fine,” he assures when he catches the worried look that flashes across Tony’s face.
The beta comes closer and Steve’s eyes flicker in his direction. He tries to move away, only to halt his movement when one of the other alphas points a gun at him. They won’t shoot him, Steve knows this, but he can’t help but cower in fear.
“Yeah. So?”
“And so am I. Cap, I’m done. I’m getting older and honestly this crap is just weighing me down. It’s just a little break.”
Peter gasps at that.
“He might,” Tony sighs.
“Well you know how babies are made so…”
The suit would be a better way to keep his family safe. His days building weapons aided him in creating the suit. He could finally protect his family the way he was supposed to.
“No. No, Uncle Bruce please! Please, guys help him! Please!” Peter begs. “Please you have to do something. He’s-”
He should have called Steve and told him that he was going to take care of the base. Steve probably would have stayed home with Peter and avoided the mess Tony created. Or maybe they would have teamed up like in the golden days. And if Steve did end up getting hurt, Tony would have been there to carry him out of the base and to safety.
Steve sniffs and wipes his tears away. He turns away from the window and tips his head back against the seat, his eyes squeezing shut. He grips Tony’s hand tightly.
Tony doesn’t appear to notice at first. He steps in, eyes everywhere else than where Steve would like them. Tony must be nervous. At least that’s Steve’s assumption.
“Do it! Now!”
“It’s okay. You didn’t know. I just don’t like going in there anymore.”
Steve scoots closer until he’s pressed up against Tony’s side, and he reaches out to gently brush his fingers along Morgan’s face. For a moment, Tony believes Steve is okay, but his calm demeanor disappears faster than it arrived. He curses all of a sudden and moves away, startling Tony.
“I love you, Pete,” Tony says softly. “I’ll always protect you. No one will ever hurt you or mommy or your siblings. I’m gonna keep you safe and love you for as long as I live.”
At the sound of his name, Tony is rushing back into the room, carrying a few towels in his hands. He doesn’t even need to ask what’s wrong, the sight of blood and Steve’s panicked expression is all he needs.
“He’s ready to go,” Tony announces and carefully lifts Peter off the changing table and cradles him in his arms. “Uh-oh. Papa’s going overboard, Petey,” Tony tells his son when he catches Steve stuffing the bag.
“Okay,” Tony says and a small smile forms over Peter’s face. “But if I get punched-”
“Sorry, kiddo. I needed some air.”
“It’s alright.”
“Tony,” Steve calls out to him and moves closer, using the bed to hold him up. “I’m here.”
“N-no.” This time Peter steals a glance in his papa’s direction and he’s met with a look of relief. He quickly turns away when the doctor asks the next question.
“What? No, Pete, no. It’s not your fault okay? Your dad and I are just…” Steve trails off with a sigh. “Don’t worry about it. I just want you to focus on yourself and the baby.”
“I figured out what to do,” Peter gets to the point, feeling confident now that he’s safe and secure in his bedroom and not the school cafeteria.
“Nothing to apologize for, honey. I know this can’t be easy.”
“Are we supposed to just accept him back?” Bucky is the first to say. Sam turns toward him, not surprised to find the hard expression on his face.
He takes a seat in one of the black, leathered arm chairs. Another drink is offered and he takes it without hesitation. If he was going to get through this night then he needed a little buzz.
Another growl builds in Steve’s chest. His head gets slammed into the wall, leaving him dazed. The same order is repeated, and this time Steve listens.
“I don’t think you’re a threat but...yeah, I don’t know you. And maybe we just need to fix that.”
“Tap the right side.”
A soft pressure in his hand reminds him that he’s not alone and his eyes snap open, blinking back the tears before glancing down at the little boy holding his hand. His cousin smiles at him, the simple gesture enough to dry Peter’s eyes and bring a smile to his own face.
“I know. I’m gonna help you okay? I promise.”
“Yeah. I figured you’d want some. I made tea for myself and I thought maybe we could...talk.”
“It took some time before they brought me another alpha. I had another boy. I named him James after my best friend. He wasn’t the one Alpha wanted and they took him. I didn’t even get to hold him.”
“So he’ll be here soon?” Tony asks.
Steve gives in. He listens.
“What did you do?” Steve asks. When he doesn’t get an immediate response he shouts, “What did you do!”
“I give up.” Tony rolls over with a huff and shuts his eyes. He does his best to tune out the soft barks the dog produces every time Steve plays with him.
“I love you so much,” Tony whispers. Tears gather in his eyes and he struggles to hold them back. He needs to be strong. “You can get through this. You’re amazing. You’re strong. Keep fighting okay? And don’t forget how much Morgan and I love you.”
“Okay. I better go. Let me know if you need anything.”
“Shh.” Steve holds a finger to his lips. “Don’t wake your brothers and sister. It’s a little late for them to have hot chocolate.”
Steve turns in Tony’s arms until they’re facing each other. Tony smiles softly at him and strokes his face.
A bright smile forms on Peter’s face and he quickly ducks his head down as if you hide it. But Tony doesn’t want him to and he stretches one hand out, lifting Peter’s chin so their eyes can meet.
“He can,” Tony answers quickly. “He can measure the baby, detect any health issues, determine the sex-”
“J, place an order at-”
It was worth it though. Their son was responsible for rekindling their love.
“Good,” Steve replies, “I really feel like this is my calling.”
Steve smiles and nods. “It is.”
“You don’t know them, Tony.”
The moment Tony is gone and the door is shut, a heavy silence hangs in the air. Steve can feel eyes on him and when he turns, he locks his gaze with Happy’s.
Steve glances down at his lap and fiddles with his fingers nervously. “You’re...an alpha,” he says quietly and peers up at Tony through long lashes. “Your job is to protect and keep me safe. I...feel that...I think. I mean, I’m still scared but your scent...it’s nice. I haven’t had a comforting scent in so long. I never thought I’d have one again.”
“Steve?”
, is what Tony wants to say but he keeps his mouth shut. It’s a struggle but he forces a smile. “Sorry, honey. I guess I just...panicked for a second.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t have to do that. You already feel that way.”
“It’s not fair.” Peter can’t help the small sob that escapes. He clings to his aunt tighter, feeling her own body tremble.
He finishes up and flushes the toilet, then pulls himself up on wobbly legs and moves back toward the sink to rinse his mouth out.
Steve nods. “How was your day?”
Steve removes his hands from Tony’s hips and presses Tony down into the bed, leaving his ass in the air and face buried in the sheets. The new position allows him to reach deeper and hit those bundles of nerves with each thrust. Tony grunts, turning his head to the side and squeezing his eyes shut. He’s unable to get himself off like this, but he doesn’t have to. Another hit to his prostate has him reaching his release.
“Um...I’m not sure.” Steve can’t help but frown again. He was never told the details about his pup. It wasn’t his to worry about. All of his pups belonged to Hydra.
The tears come first. It’s like a dam has been broken; the tears stream down his face, unable to be stopped. Peter chokes back a sob and rushes toward the toilet. He’d rather throw up than cry. He was supposed to be strong.
“I need some space. I’m sleeping in the guest room.”
“Not here,” Tony says once they part. “I want you to be comfortable.”
“I don’t know. We’re not there yet. Look don’t worry alright? I can handle this and if it gets worse then-” Tony pats Happy on the shoulder. “-I have the best bodyguard in the world.”
“I’ll be right there with you,” Tony promises.
Tony’s head snaps up and he connects his eyes with the ones that match his own. Peter’s frowning at him, his own eyes filling with both tears and concern.
“He’s having the baby here?”
The kiss doesn’t stay soft and gentle for long. Steve rolls onto his back and Tony follows, positioning himself between the omega’s spread legs.
“Thanks, Tony.”
“About him?”
“It feels like it is. I’m sorry, Auntie Nat,” Peter whimpers and hugs her tightly. She hugs him back and cradles the back of his head. Just like he remembers her doing when he was younger.
“Don’t. Please! Don’t!”
“Okay. So I was talking with my uncles right, and they were kind of uncomfortable about it because I haven’t really talked to them after the whole thing with the party, but then-”
“I'm here, baby.”
With each passing hour, the contractions get worse and more intense than the ones prior. Steve was usually pretty good at handling pain, and even though he’s been through labor more times than he likes to admit, the pain of bringing a child into the world never failed to to test his limits.
He can’t help but worry and listen to that voice in his head. It constantly reminded him of the screwed up relationship he had with his own father, and the childhood that was anything but happy. He vowed to be a better father, and to give his son all the love in the world. It’s what he had wanted.
Tony pulls away, frowning down at the omega. “What’s wrong?”
“I know, I know. But when you were in the shower and I was left behind in the cold bed-”
“You deserve it, Tony. I wish I could do more-”
Bucky looks him over, not entirely convinced but he doesn’t question him. He turns to Natasha and they share a look. A look Peter has seen before.
“And the messiest.”
“Hey, what did I say about apologizing?”
Tony wraps a hand around Steve’s cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts, urging him to come. It’s too much and with one more hard thrust, Steve is screaming Tony’s name and coming, spurting ropes of cum over Tony’s hand.
Alpha comes over with the glass of his favorite alcohol in his hand. Steve’s gaze lingers on the glass a little longer than he means to. He doesn’t like when the alpha becomes intoxicated.
“No. And Peter knows that. He just wants you to be
Tony rolls his eyes and rises to his feet. He doesn’t bother cleaning up his work station when he’d probably be back down to finish. He asks Jarvis to lock up the lab, then he’s going back up stairs.
“He promised me a trip to DisneyWorld and we never got to go. It was a tradition. Can we keep it?”
“Yeah.” Bucky sighs sadly and folds the shirt. He rises to his feet and heads toward the door. “I’ll let you get some sleep now. Goodnight, Pete. I love you.”
Another alert from Friday comes through.
“We’ll be fine,” Steve assures. He shifts awkwardly from foot to foot, arms crossing over his chest. “You better go.”
With a shocked gasp, Steve backs away and glances down at his hands, eyes widening at the red that paints them. He lifts his head when he hears a gun cock and his eyes meet those of Brock Rumlow. He’s never seen the alpha so scared.
The video ends and the next one starts. It’s during one of the many Christmas parties Tony threw every year. He’s recording again, showing off the large space the hired decorators had set up and commenting on the giant tree displayed in the middle of the room.
“Hurry up then, Stark.”
“It’s right here, Maguna,” Tony assures. Steve holds her out, expecting Tony to take over and feed her, but Tony holds back. “This is your time.”
Peter looks around, for a moment forgetting that the AI was everywhere. He doesn’t know where to look but up.
“Yes,” Steve says slowly, almost cautiously. “Is this okay?”
“You have one from me, Captain.” Thor beams, holding out a tiny gift bag.
“Only because I have to. Now come on. The sun will be up soon.”
“Happy didn’t pick me up? I always call him.”
His eyelids droop and his head rolls to the side.
“So you being late wasn’t because of Ned or school, was it?” Sam asks.
“Steve, what’s wrong? How can I help?”
“He won’t...h-he won’t s-stop.”
When Steve doesn’t answer, Tony takes a few steps forward. “Steve, what’s-”
“Look,” Steve smiles and lifts his shirt, showing off the bump. Tony peers up from where he’s lying on the bed, and sets his tablet down to give his husband attention. Steve’s belly is on display. “The baby’s growing.”
Steve sniffs and nods his head. He rests it on Tony’s shoulder, small sniffs escaping when more tears fall from his eyes. The guilt is eating at him, plaguing him and making him feel like the worst person in the world. Like the worst parent.
Steve lets Tony in. They pass by the second bedroom that will eventually be turned into their son’s, and Tony places the boxes inside until they are ready for them. Steve is already shedding off his t-shirt once he’s in his room, grimacing at the mess he finds it in. He quickly rolls it up and tosses it into the hamper with a heavy sigh. He forgets that Tony is still lingering in the doorway and he flushes when he glances up to find him there.
Tony doesn’t get any sleep that night, not that he was expecting to in the first place. He was usually pulling an all-nighter on a new project or celebrating his success at a party. It was a lifestyle he knew he couldn’t continue having. And after the last party he went to, he vows to never go out to a public event like that again.
“You okay?” Tony asks and Steve glances up to connect their eyes.
Remember how I said it was going to get worse? Yeah...this is it.
“Don’t. Leave me alone.”
“What?”
Steve chuckles. “Sure,” he says and slips free from Tony’s arms. “I’m in need of a shower.”
Tony sighs. “Fine. Keep me posted. I don’t want to miss anything.”
“I’m still having contractions.”
It’s not until he lowers himself in the rocking chair and puts a bottle to her lips does she quiet down. Tony breathes a sigh of relief and glances down at her, watching quietly as she nurses greedily from her bottle. Tony rocks back and forth in the chair, hoping the soothing motion and her warm bottle will help coax her to sleep.
“Oh uh...” Tony quickly takes it out from under his arm. “Just mail from the office. Pepper is sending me all of my mail so...just mail.”
“Tony!” Tears are streaming down Steve’s face now. Tony has never seen him so terrified.
Peter and Harley aren’t even in the living room anymore. Harley is sitting at the dining table while Peter takes over breakfast. Both are too occupied to notice her slipping out the front door.
“Yeah. But if not…”
Steve whimpers and nods his head. Tony backs away to allow Steve to undress. Steve sits up to discard his shirt, his face flushed as he reveals part of himself. Tony smiles at the sight.
“What? You’re not making any sense. Who brought me? Brought me where?”
“Been around? And who’s fault is that, Tony? You abandoned me.”
“You did? Hmm. Why do I feel like help was involved?”
They finally make it to the apartment. The stairs leading to the upper level is a struggle, but soon they’re stepping inside the master bedroom. Tony carefully lays Steve down on his side of the bed, not caring that he’s staining the sheets with dirt and blood.
A mission was the last thing Steve wanted to deal with, but it was his duty as both an Avenger and Captain to take part in it. If he could have it his way he would stay behind and suggest someone else take over, but leading the team was his responsibility.
“I swear you two are always together,” Steve says with a shake of his head. He collapses on the couch beside Tony, letting his head fall back against the sofa. Dodger is up from his spot near Tony to greet Steve with a lick.
“Hey. She’s okay. You didn’t mean it. I know you didn’t.”
Peter lets his father hold him a little longer, finding comfort in his warm embrace. His mind is racing with too many thoughts, making it difficult for him to think straight. He’s never been so scared in his life.
“And you want that correct?”
“This is awesome!”
“Jarvis?” Steve’s gaze lands on the ceiling above him. Tony had reminded him countless times that the AI was everywhere but Steve found himself talking to the ceiling whenever he acknowledged Jarvis.
Tony can’t remember the last time they’ve all been gathered like this. He thinks maybe it was back for Steve’s baby shower, but even that was some time ago. He enjoys being around his friends, but it’s not the same when someone special was missing.
“Always.”
“I’m sorry...did you just say…” There was no way Tony had heard correctly. “You’re pregnant?”
“Love life? Come on, Pep, you know that doesn’t exist. He’s not-it’s not that like that at all. I’m helping him out.”
Steve is sure the topic of marriage isn’t going to be brought up again...until Bucky calls out to him and asks, “Who’s gonna be your best man?”
“Yeah, boss, he’s here. Yeah. He’s-” Happy pauses his private conversation to glance at Peter, scanning him closely and making Peter shift uncomfortably. “Yeah he’s good. He’s smiling...or was. Yes-you know what I’m sending him up. Ask him then.”
Tony throws an arm around Peter’s shoulders and together they make their way toward the entrance. Tony stops abruptly and frowns.
“I know, kid. It’s getting cramped in there, huh?” Steve gets another kick in response, this time harder than the one before and he winces. “Okay, don’t take it out on me. We’re almost there.”
“Do you feel better?” Sam asks. “Ready to kick butt?”
“Because I needed to talk to him. It was his party I went to. I thought maybe he’d know more about that night and-Steve, I’m sorry. I didn’t know it was him. I never would’ve invited him over if I did.”
“I made him do this,” Natasha points at the second photo. Giggling she says, “No more abs!”
Happy nods his head and Morgan is placed in his outstretched arms. “She’s beautiful. Her name’s Morgan, right?”
The room he’s been wheeled to is just down the hall from Tony’s private suite. It’s smaller in size and lacks most of the accommodations of the other room, but it has a bed, an armchair, a connected bathroom and a space for the doctor to gather any supplies.
“Are you ready to talk to them and tell them how you feel?”
Steve opens his eyes and he meets soft brown ones. The hand on his cheek is softly caressing him.
“What’s wrong with his helmet?” Bucky questions, pointing out the strange hat on Steve’s head.
“I think they’re adorable.” Natasha grins and kisses Peter on the head.
“You sound like him when you say that.”
“You’re fine,” Steve assures, “but...don’t say it again.”
They weren’t a perfect family. They fought, they drove each other crazy, but at the end of the day, they were all that they had.
Steve waits a few days after Bucky comes home before he breaks the news. The last thing he wanted to do was bombard his team with new information after they’ve just welcomed a new team member, and lost an old one.
“Don’t worry about him,” Tony says. “He’s a nice guy.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes. “I’m dampening the mood huh? This was supposed to be about you and our son.”
The smile on Alexander’s face widens.
“Not good,” Tony replies honestly. His eyes drift to the little boy passed out on the couch. “How’d he do? Good, I hope.”
“You feel so good,” Tony groans and increases the pace of his thrusts, punching out moans and gasps from Steve. “Does it feel good for you?”
“Thank you. Nat, you don’t know how much I appreciate this. Everything you’ve done for me...thank you. I don’t know what I’d do without you. You’re an amazing friend.”
Steve nods and fishes into his jacket pocket for his keys. He sighs harshly when he pulls out a tiny toy car along with his set.
“It’s okay.”
“We will soon.”
Tony smiles and nods. “Okay. I’m sure Jarvis will let you know when the food’s here.”
Steve sniffs and pulls away so that their eyes can meet. Tony has never seen him so heartbroken; so distraught.
Steve nods and rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I hope so. I’m tired of feeling like this. I want things to go back to normal.”
“Yeah, baby. I’m okay now.” Steve brings his son close, letting his pup inhale his scent. Sarah crawls over to join them, making herself comfortable in Steve’s lap and nibbling happily on her cookies.
He’s reminded of the one person he technically could refer to as family. Tony Stark wasn’t a part of the team anymore, but he was still Peter’s dad.
So heads up...I’ve had this idea for a while and let me tell you it’s...it’s rough. And I know a certain someone is going to get a lot of hate, but this wasn’t supposed to be a happy story. Not everyone gets a happy ending. And if you’re fine with that then great! If not...I’m sorry. I did warn you guys a while back. 😬
Steve clicks his tongue. “Not of him...I’m just...I’m tired.”
Steve growls and takes a step forward, only to halt when the gun is pointed at him.
“I miss you.” It’s words Steve has been keeping to himself since the day they ended their relationship. He had thought he’d be able to get over Tony, but sharing the same living space made it difficult. And now the life they created only made Steve’s heart yearn for Tony more.
“This is what’s right. It’s hard, and believe me I wish I could bring you home right now...but this is going to work. This is going to help you.”
“I was forced to stay with him. I was forced to mate…” Steve chokes back a sob and that’s when Tony moves closer, wrapping Steve in his arms. “He took everything from me.”
“Yeah, yeah that’s great,” Tony interrupts, “so what time do I need to have you back?”
Tony is snapped from his thoughts and his eyes flicker up to meet Steve’s gaze. “I was just picturing you carrying our baby. I never imagined it before but now I can’t stop,” he says and he reaches out to splay his palm over Steve’s stomach. “Our baby would be right here. It’s crazy.”
“I wish you were here to tell me what to do. What do I do? I need...I just need to know that it’s okay.”
“Anyway,” Bucky continues, choosing to ignore his husband’s remark. “I just want you to be happy. And if that means having a relationship with your dad then that’s fine with me.”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to grow confused. “You know J?”
“So taking down corrupted alphas is officially a thing of the past?”
“Yeah. He is acting differently. And I don’t remember him owning anything like that. Unless Steve really was okay with it.”
They fall silent for a moment. Steve keeps his gaze locked on Peter, and gently traces a finger along his chubby cheek.
“I’m not leaving you. We’re getting out of here together,” Steve promises. He ignores how pale Tony’s gotten. He wasn't leaving without his mate.
Dodger seems pleased with that response and he runs out of the lab, barking when he’s not followed right away. Tony shakes his head and takes Steve’s hand, then they’re following Dodger.
Before another attack can be issued, Steve is up and blocking the blows thrown at him. His shield is out of reach, but he’s fought without it before and this time was no different. He crashes his fist against his attacker's jaw, filling his ears with the crack that follows. The man screams and reaches out for his battered jaw, and with him distracted, Steve finishes him off.
“I’m going to miss you like crazy. I’ve never really been apart from you…not like this.”
“You’re awake,” Bucky says, his tone showing both relief and bitterness. Peter knows who the bitterness is for, but he knows better than to bring up his dad now.
“Is she okay?” Steve snaps his head back in the direction of the tiny screen, completely forgetting that Tony was still on the line. “Steve? Hon?”
“Nothing.” Steve lies. He doesn’t miss the way Sam watches him closely. “Guess it just became a little much. These parties are just so…”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, then he’s leaving the apartment and taking his daughter with him.
Bruce smiles, but it appears sad. “Yeah he had us, but we were just aunt and uncles to him. That’s not saying that we didn’t matter, but Steve was his whole world. Steve always knew how to comfort Peter when he was sick or scared. They played and laughed and probably watched thousands of movies together. They were close.”
“Pete,” Sam says, his voice soft. He steps toward the hunched over figure, and with a sigh, placing his hand over the kid’s shoulder. “I’m-”
“No...he’s not even here. At least not fully. Tony, you told me if I ever needed you for anything…”
“Petey?” Comes his papa’s soft voice. Peter wants to scold him for the nickname, but with his head buried in the dirty toilet bowl, his papa doesn’t get the scolding.
“Some?” Natasha smirks, coming over to assist. Tony ignores the teasing. She takes Peter into her arms, the smirk on her face instantly replaced with a smile. “Hello there. Shh it’s okay.”
his life. He lost the person that meant the most to him and now he has you.”
“I know, and I’m proud of you for how much you’ve opened up. Steve, this is going to take time. I’m not going to rush you or pressure you into talking to me. I’m here to help you.”
Peter doesn’t even want to know what he means and he rushes out of the bathroom.
He’s agitated when he’s woken up to be burped and cleaned, but then he’s relaxing again and falling back to sleep.
“I’m sorry.” It’s barely above a whisper, but Tony picks up on the two words. Steve lifts his head and turns toward Tony, his once vibrant blue eyes lack their shine. Tony has never seen them so dull.
He disappears into the elevator and the room is left in a heavy silence. Tony can feel the eyes of his teammates on him, and turning toward them he’s greeted with worried and confused faces.
“Nothing,” Tony lies. He knows his lie is falling through. He had been repeating the same lie for years, and each time Happy had been able to see through it. “Baby’s good. He’ll be here soon, though.”
They were ready to take that next step and start a family. Tony had been hesitant about the idea at first. He didn’t want to end up like his father or somehow even worse. It took a lot to convince him that he’d never be the type of father Howard was.
Steve can only nod in response. He gazes down at his son, lovingly stroking a finger along his cheek. Peter responds by placing a hand over Steve’s chest.
“You don’t have a fever, but you don’t look so good. Do you want to stay home? One day won’t kill you.”
Hello! Hope everyone is having a good day! I’m feeling better and my results for Covid came back negative. I have no idea what I had then. Anyway, here is the next chapter and I tried to make it longer. I hope you all enjoy it!
Peter relaxes and he opens his eyes again. He doesn’t voice his complaints and remains silent while Steve gets him ready to head down to the medbay.
“You can’t be angry at him. He’s just a kid.”
“Only because Peter dragged his ass away from whatever hole he’s been hiding in,” Bucky points out.
Peter just shrugs. “It’s fun.”
“No! The baby can’t die! It was supposed to grow and be my brother!”
The pups are huddled together on the medical bed with Steve in the center. He has Sarah cradled in his arms and James and Harley beside him. James is snarling at the unwanted presence of the SHIELD physician. Tony waits outside of the room, not sure if his own scent would only upset the pups even more.
“What the hell does that mean?” Steve demands.
Steve nods and glances down at Sarah and James; both of them have dozed off as well.
“Just tired. And...Tony and I are in a fight. Don’t worry about it,” Steve quickly says when Bucky opens his mouth to speak.
“I won’t keep you late. I don’t want to get on his bad side.”
Morgan’s cries can be heard in the background and Natasha tries to calm her down.
“There he is!” Clint grins. “Stark finally decided to grace us all with his presence.”
Steve can’t help but smirk to himself. Found it.
Morgan refuses to acknowledge the behavior and goes in search of her parents. It’s easy to find one of them and she assumes the other is still at work.
“You don’t seem happy about it,” Sam retorts.
By the time all of their friends leave and he and Steve settle in their apartment, Tony is beyond drained. The nursery is full of the gifts Peter received and Steve promised he’d deal with it in the morning. Right now he’s content lying in bed with his arms wrapped around Tony.
“Why? What happened?” Pepper asks.
“No big scary alphas you’re trying to beat off with a stick?” Pepper jokes.
Tony had gathered all of their friends for a welcome home party. It’s not just Steve who sheds a few tears when he’s greeted by everyone. Bucky is the first to rush to him, which didn’t come as a surprise. Bucky was the one who probably felt the most guilty. Well, as far as friends go. Tony was always going to carry a majority of the guilt.
This was his chance.
Tony nods. “Me too.”
“You’re hard to forget.” Tony regrets those words the second they leave his mouth. He clears his throat and shifts awkwardly. “Um...do you need...I can get you…”
“Tony, that’s not what I’m saying.”
“No more coffee.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Tony asks innocently as he cuts into his chicken breast. “It’s true. The baby needs all the nutrients it can get.”
“Buck-”
“Are you an intern or something?” Tony asks.
“Steve, what’s wrong?”
Deep down he wanted to be bonded and share a life with a mate. They had so much that still needed to be revealed. But the pup in his belly was already the strongest connection they had. Steve wanted to know if there was more.
“I’m going to protect you,” Steve whispers to his son. “I won’t let anyone ever hurt you. I promise.”
Steve leans in and Tony follows until their lips are meeting again. Steve rests his hands on Tony’s shoulders, letting them slide down to Tony’s chest and playing with the buttons of his shirt. Tony has to stop him from going any further and Steve pulls back with a frown.
“Are we good? You’re not still upset with me?” Peter asks once they pull apart.
“I don’t know the full extent of what happened, but I can assure you that you did nothing wrong. You lost your control. Your power. That wasn’t your fault.”
“You mean so much to me.”
But once dinner is over and Ned leaves, Peter is left to deal with his parents. Luckily they leave him alone and he’s able to sneak away to his room and pretend to do homework.
Bucky suffered along with him. Regardless of the serum running through their veins, sleep was still needed, and the lack of it was putting a strain on them. And it was only the first night.
Peter quiets down instantly and slumps in his seat, his cheeks red with embarrassment. “Sometimes. Papa would always laugh at me.”
Tony doesn’t hold back now that Steve has granted him permission and he picks up the pace, his goal to bring Steve over the edge first. His knot has grown, tugging harshly on the rim of Steve’s entrance. The omega cries out from the feeling and he grips Tony tighter.
I’ll update soon!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes!” Harley nods his head and wraps his arms around Sam’s neck. “I stay with you!”
“Thanks. Um we can get you new clothes. Whenever you want to go just tell me. And if you want to borrow anything else I don’t mind.”
“He’d hurt Stark,” Clint says.
“Oh.” Tony frowns. “Okay. Thanks.”
“He’s late,” Bucky grumbles in annoyance.
Steve relaxes slightly and steps fully into the living room. He nears the couch, only to stop when he realizes he hasn’t received permission to sit down.
Ever since the promise he had made to Steve had been broken, Tony vowed to never break another one like it again. It was his job as an alpha to protect his omega. Steve was more than just his mate. He was his best friend, the mother of his children, the love of his life. He needed Steve just like he needed air.
“Baby Stark? I thought it was Baby Rogers?”
“I’m just gonna go…” Peter adjusts his backpack and steps around her to leave, only to stop when she calls out to him. He turns around to face her. The frown is gone, and in its place is a sad expression. He knows where this is going.
Peter knew he was risking detention for skipping the last part of AP American History for this, but he needed to get Flash alone so they could talk.
“Hang on. What did he do? What happened?” Bucky frowns.
“Uh okay...wow. Um...hmm…” Tony is at a loss for words. He leans back in his chair and scratches at his chin. He didn’t know much about Steve, but it was clear that he had been through some shit.
Steve’s screams throughout the night only seem to get worse. He not only wakes Tony and Peter, but the rest of the children during one of his nightly episodes. He hates it. He hates how much he scares the pups when he’s screaming and begging for help. He hates that’s the image they see of him.
“Honey, stop. Kids act this way. Remember how Harley-no, wait that’s not a good example. Sarah! When she turned two she had this issue. She still does.”
“Hey, Pete. Guess you’re finally awake, huh?”
“What am I going to do with you?” Pepper shakes her head and comes over, pulling open the first drawer of his desk and retrieving the red tie that’s inside.
It was over.
“Yeah? He didn’t want to hang out with daddy today?”
“It doesn’t matter.”
Tony carefully leads Steve over to the bed, only to stop when another contraction decides to hit. Steve cries out and doubles over. He grips Tony’s hand and the alpha grunts in pain.
“Good. Now get some sleep.”
Peter only sighs. “Me too.”
“You’re a terrible liar, Steve.” Bucky shakes his head. His eyes roam over his friend and a frown appears over his face. “You also look like crap.”
“30 seconds.”
“Did I hurt her?”
Tony turns in his chair and takes Steve’s hands, pulling him close and between his legs. “I’ll be up in a minute. Are the kids asleep?”
“That doesn’t help me at all. What does that even mean?”
“Speak of the devil,” Steve says and he folds his arms over his chest.
With a sigh he lowers his tools and slants back in his seat.
This time he was well aware of today’s topic. Peter loved his best friend, Ned. They had been inseparable since their first day of kindergarten. Steve had been worried about his son starting school, afraid Peter would struggle to fit in just like he had. Steve had been the scrawny, sick kid and Peter was...well, a super kid.
“We come in all shapes and sizes,” Clint says and he eyes Steve up and down. “Damn. You sure you’re not an alpha?”
He keeps running and fighting his way out until he’s finally outside the compound walls. He doesn’t slow down, using his superhuman speed to outrun the guards.
“Can we go home? I’m just really tired,” Peter replies.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. He lingers around a little longer, deciding to try nursing again now that both himself and Morgan are calm. With Tony’s help, he’s able to get Morgan to latch on. She gets her fill and Tony takes her back in his arms, ushering Steve out of the room before either one has another meltdown.
They break apart when the sound of little feet padding against the floor captures their attention. Steve turns away quickly, using the bit of dishes left over in the sink to distract himself from the little boy coming into the kitchen. He doesn’t want his son to see him with tears in his eyes.
“I wish you were here,” Peter says, his vision blurring from the tears that form in his eyes. “Everything’s so different now and...and I don’t know what to do. Dad is...he’s trying I guess but he’s not you and...and I don’t know if it’s worth it. Is that wrong to say?”
“Sorry. The point is you did all of the work. And yeah it was hard and it sucked at times, but look at her. She was worth it, right?”
“You’re a good dad, Tony.” Steve smiles and threads his fingers through the alpha’s hair. Tony pulls back slightly, a look of uncertainty crossing his features. “You are. Peter’s lucky. And so am I.”
“My name is Natasha Romanoff. I’m an Agent for SHIELD and have been tasked to...keep an eye on you.”
Steve sighs sadly and gives up on setting the table to comfort his mate. He wraps his arms around Tony, bringing the alpha close and allowing him access to the mark on his neck. Tony inhales the moment his nose brushes against Steve’s neck.
“Maybe for some, but we’re not going to do that. We need to talk about it. A lot happened.”
“Play it!”
“Are you sure?” Natasha appears wary.
The room falls silent.
His uncle keeps moving and Peter waits until he’s out of sight before dropping back down. He grunts when he hits the floor and quickly wipes the dust from his jeans, then he keeps moving.
It leaves just as soon as it comes, and he’s able to forget about it. Steve makes another attempt to sleep, only to find that he’s lost the ability. His stomach doesn’t hurt again, but it’s the fluttering sensation that keeps him up most of the night.
“Come here, kiddo,” Tony opens his arms and James shakes his head. Tony sighs and drops his arms to his side. “It’s okay. You don’t have to talk to me yet.”
“I can get him,” Tony says. It’s tempting to take the offer, but one glance in the alpha’s direction shows him on the verge of passing out.
Tony doesn’t respond. He honestly doesn’t know if he believes Steve’s words. He can’t see everything being fine when Steve wasn’t here.
“I know. I’m so sorry that he’s gone. I’m sorry we lost the baby. But none of that is your fault.”
“For now.” Tony kisses his mate’s shoulder again. “I just want to stay like this forever.”
“I don’t know why you’re fighting sleep,” Tony tells her. “It’s pretty much bedtime. Are you waiting for Papa to come home? I bet you are, huh? Me too.”
“Actually…I was hoping I’d walk. I...want to be alone.”
“I’m scared. I don’t know how to do any of this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter reminds himself of the good things he still had. He may not have his papa around anymore, but at least he had the rest of his family. He could still train with his aunt and have dinner with his uncles. He could still learn about Asgard and the funny stories Uncle Thor liked to tell. He could still work in the lab with his Uncle Bruce. And when his Uncle Clint came around, they could practice with his bow.
“Still out there, searching for me. I thought once I escaped he’d never find me and I would be safe. My pup would be safe. Now he knows where I am.”
“Tell them, Bucky or I will. I can’t keep hiding it anymore. And I know you can’t either. The person you are now isn’t you.”
Bruce frowns. “Then why is he carrying your baby? That is your baby, right?”
The reason for revising his old apartment is to clean it out. Peter can’t even imagine touching his papa’s things. No one had gone in there since the funeral.
Peter shakes his head and Steve breathes out a sigh of relief.
“Come on,” he tries again. “It’s freezing and we’re standing in the middle of an intersection with angry New Yorkers.”
He regrets the question the minute it leaves his mouth. What possessed him to even ask something like that was beyond him. It’s clear Steve is just as bothered by it, if the look on his face is anything to go by.
Tony is busy preparing snacks for the pups when Steve comes down stairs. Outside he can hear their children running around and playing whatever game their imagination conjured up. He smiles at the sound of their laughter, at their happiness.
I’m bringing Rhodey in (fingers crossed 🤞 I’ve never written a lot of him before) and another mission 😏 And more angst! They’ll be some happy stuff but this is a angsty story so 🤷♀️
“We’re gonna go,” Natasha says and she passes Peter back to Tony. Clint whines behind her and she whips her head around to scold him again. “You ruined it. Let’s go.”
“And if this is really it then I’ll be here until Tony arrives. You’re not doing this alone.”
“Nat, please?” Steve begs. He wants to be done with this conversation. Talking about Tony was too painful.
Steve doesn’t respond and the room falls silent again.
Peter wishes he could turn around and have the apartment locked up, but it was uncles and aunt that decided to clean up the space.
Steve keens quietly from the praise. He wishes he could turn over to face his mate, but the alpha’s knot was preventing him from switching positions. He lies contentedly in Tony’s arms, enjoying the warmth and comfort his alpha brought.
“Maguna,” he soothes. “You’re okay.”
I couldn't resist not posting the next chapter. It's a little on the short side but it's full of bonding time with baby Peter. I hope you all enjoy it and have a wonderful, and relaxing day!
“Hey,” Sam moves to sit next to his husband, taking his hand in his own. “Look at me, Buck.”
He doesn’t get very far. His thoughts are once again plagued with Steve and the painful regrets. He’s reminded of his second chance sleeping on the floor above him. He doesn’t know much about the kid that’s forever turned his life upside down, but he knows he’d do anything for him.
Steve keens from the praise.
He ends the call.
He can’t help but let his eyes linger a little longer on the poster of a smiling father cradling his new baby. Peter wonders if he’ll be that happy when he’s holding his baby for the first time. It’s a scary thought, he can’t imagine holding something so delicate in his arms. He couldn’t even carry his workbooks down the hall without dropping one of them.
“He’s not still pissed at me, is he?”
“Thanks,” Peter mumbles and searches for his math book. He finds what he’s looking for and shuts the door, his eyes locking with Ned’s. “I’m fine,” Peter is quick to assure. “Just...tired.”
“Not really. I’m trying to get a hold of Tony and-”
The omega flinches when a hand comes out to touch his cheek. The feel of the alpha’s palm is familiar, it awakens nightmares Steve has tried to forget.
“Steve was given a serum to enhance him, making him this perfect omega. He’s strong, fast; built for God knows what, and he got into the wrong hands. The alpha before me...he did some things. Terrible things.”
“That’s okay, kiddo,” Tony assures and he rises to his feet to kiss his son on the top of his head. “You’ll get there.”
“I need to lie down,” Steve responds. His eyes travel down to the floor, widening at the sight of the blood. “Tony! Oh my God. There’s so much. Tony, there’s so much.”
“Can we go? Please!” Peter begs. “I promise I’ll get good grades.”
Steve catches the sad expression on his son’s face and he sighs. He rests both hands over Peter’s shoulders and their eyes meet.
“Let’s do it.”
Peter sucks in a harsh breath and gives up on his lunch completely. If Ned wasn’t asking about Flash then he was asking about Peter’s parents. A part of Peter wanted to tell them about the predicament he’s found himself in, but the other half argues against that. It would be better if no one knew.
“I know. And I’m sorry that I’m feeling this way-”
“You said you were happy. I guess I just assumed-”
Morgan begins to whimper, the sounds rising in volume until they’re loud wails. Steve struggles this time around to calm her down. The cry she makes is easily distinguishable to Tony’s ears.
Tony frowns at those words. “That’s the first I’m hearing this.”
“Hey, buddy, are you okay?” Tony asks, taking small steps toward the man. He stops when the man moves away.
“Steve!”
Flash rolls his eyes. Of course he knew. Everyone knew who Peter’s parents were and the glorious life he lived.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony assures and rises to his feet. “I think I can order us something...if you want.”
“Jesus.” Tony sighs heavily and throws his head back against the pillows. “This is taking forever!”
Peter kneels down beside the grave to clear away some broken twigs and dried leaves. He takes one of the drawings, smiling at the image of his papa. It reminds him of all the drawings he’s created over the years.
“Thank you, Tony.”
“I don’t know. It’s been...a long time and after the baby I wasn’t sure if you’d-if you’d ever look at me like-”
Peter frowns. “They won’t do that. I think they’ll be happy to see you. They were wondering where you were for the funeral. I know I was.”
“Ow!” Tony cries out when Steve slaps him across the back of the head before assisting Flash with the mess.
Peter’s face lights up. “Really? You’d do that for me?”
Steve takes a shaky breath. “Yeah. I’m trying, Tony. I’m doing everything they ask of me, but sometimes I wish I never did this. Sometimes I wish I had done things right.”
“Yeah?” Bucky sniffs. “Steve promised me the same thing and I lost him.”
Steve smiles and hugs his son. “I thought you forgot.”
Steve glances down at his feet and mumbles, “Yeah.”
“You’re safe now. Go, Steve.”
Steve notices the lack of response coming from his team after he asks a question, and he sighs when he finds them distracted. He glances at his son, who smiles cutely, then to Nick. He doesn’t get a cute smile in return from the Director.
Peter gulps. “That doesn't make me feel better.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “We’re fine. You on the other hand look like shit.”
“What kind of question is that? Of course I care about you. Your dad would kill me if I didn’t.”
Bucky cranes his head in curiosity and Steve yanks him back. “Don’t look.”
It’s difficult to attend to a fussy baby with only having just one sip of coffee, but Tony manages. It’s easy to forget about his exhaustion once she’s in his arms and staring up at him. Her eyes are still that dark blue that all babies are born with, and Tony hopes they only get lighter. Her dark hair was something she inherited from him, but he wanted her eyes to resemble those of his husband’s. Steve wasn’t convinced, and was positive she was going to have brown eyes.
“Now you have another.”
“So what do you think? I can live here right?” Peter asks, the excitement never leaving his tone.
“I hope you got it, sir. I’m happy to be back.” Jarvis doesn’t sound very thrilled, but Tony’s not about to question his attitude. He had to deal with the nagging and disappointment for years.
“Papa?”
The door to his room opens and Steve’s head snaps up. He quickly uncurls himself and scrambles off his bed, ready to greet Alpha. The smile Alpha wears is one Steve has seen many times before. He was pleased.
“My body’s fine,” is all Steve says before storming out of the apartment. The front door slams hard behind him.
Steve gasps and drops his hand, but Tony takes it and grips it hard. Steve struggles and Tony fights back, pushing him deeper into the bench. The pressure on his belly sends warning signals.
The alpha appears from the cockpit and makes his way to the empty seat beside Steve.
“It’s a curse. I swear I don’t mean to be.”
Tony nods and glances back at the road. He doesn’t see the way Peter crosses his fingers.
Steve snaps his head up at Tony. “What do you mean? She said she would babysit, right?”
“I’m not leaving you behind.”
“Stop apologizing! And no. We did discuss it though.”
“My feet hurt.”
“I know, but it could just be something small. I’m trying to not be afraid anymore and I think it’s working and I don’t know maybe a party would...sorry I’m rambling.”
“I know,” Tony says and Steve’s shoulders sag in disappointment. He knew it.
“Well yeah.”
But now that he and Tony were expecting, their friends didn’t hesitate to celebrate alongside them. A new team member(that’s what Clint decided to refer to the baby as) was exciting and a bit nerve-wracking all at the same time. A baby had never fully fit into the equation, but Steve was determined to make it work.
“Do you want to train or not?”
Tony swallows the lump that’s formed in this throat. He knew Steve was hurting, but he didn’t know his pain was this severe. He wishes he had seen the signs sooner. Maybe it wouldn’t have come to this if he had.
Now, his poor excuse for an office has been transformed into a room he doesn’t recognize. Tony had cleared away the bit of belongings he did have, and replaced them with items strictly meant for their son.
“Of course I love you.” Tony takes both of Steve’s hands in his own. “Why would you ask that?”
The camera shifts, showing off Natasha and Clint lounging on the sofas, deep in a conversation. Natasha notices the camera first and flips Tony off. He chuckles and moves on, searching for someone in particular.
When Peter decides to venture out of the guest room, he’s greeted with silence. He pokes his head out of the room and into the hall, expecting to hear some kind of activity, but he’s left with only more silence.
“Maybe I want a kiss.”
“What? No! No this isn’t it. Just tell Tony I’m fine.”
He approaches the desk and sits down in the chair, a heavy sigh leaving his lips. His eyes are immediately drawn to the first drawer and he slides it open, his vision blurring at the sight of the sketchbook inside.
Tony takes a shaky breath and gulps down more of his coffee, ignoring the burning down his throat. He wants a different kind of burn.
Tony eyes the bump, fighting back the urge to frown. He forces another smile. “That’s great.”
Steve smiles behind the rim of his mug and his face flushes from Tony’s soft gaze. Tony tears his eyes away and takes his first drink from the mug, sighing in delight.
“This might be a little cold,” Doctor Patterson warns before squirting gel on Tony’s belly.
“No offense but...you don’t get to decide. Sorry,” Peter quickly apologizes and glances down at his lap. He’s never spoken to an adult like that before, let alone his parents.
Steve attacks.
“Tony, you don’t have to...if it’s too much.”
“Yeah.” Tony smiles and rubs Steve’s belly fondly. “He’ll be here soon. Tell you what, after I get back we’ll get the nursery started and then plan your birthday and a baby shower.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s no remaining tissue in his uterus. Everything had been passed. His baby was gone.
Tony holds his breath, a part of him hoping the omega takes his offer. Then by some miracle, the omega nods his head again and allows Tony to lead him to the car. Happy doesn’t appear too thrilled but working for Tony for years has made him practically immune to the billionaire’s crazy antics.
Tony lies back and watches as Steve rides him, enjoying the way the omega whimpers and moans as he fucks himself on the alpha’s cock, as he takes what he needs.
Tony sighs and sets his beer down, no longer interested in the beverage. He contemplates joining the rest of the party, but he holds back, not wanting to disrupt what they have going on. They were hurting because Steve wasn’t physically with them on this day, but they still had each other and that was enough to keep their spirits high. Tony would only ruin that.
“Leaving you was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I didn’t know how I was supposed to be away from you, but I knew I had to if I wanted to see you again. I’m sorry for what I did...for what I didn’t do. I promised to be a good father and I failed. I’m so sorry, Morgan. I’ll do better. I don’t want you to ever think that I never loved you because I always have, and always will.”
The call ends.
“I just want to make sure you’re okay.”
There’s Steve with their upset son in his arms, his own face streaked with tears. It’s a difficult scene to take in. Tony has never seen Steve so upset before.
“Always. He’s taking after Tony. He loves building things and now cars apparently,” Steve replies and slips the car back into his pocket.
Steve seems cheerful the morning Tony and Morgan stop by. His face lights up the moment he sees his daughter. Morgan doesn’t even fuss when she’s in his arms.
The memorial is littered flowers, pictures, and candles. Peter suddenly wishes he had brought something and he makes a mental note to bring something when he visits tomorrow. He already knows he’ll be at this place more than anywhere else.
“I don’t know what to do. They’re going to make us mate.” Steve’s eyes drift in the direction of the bench, his stomach churning at the thought of having to relive another nightmare.
Those plans were broken now due to the horrible timing of his rut. He had wanted to be in the right state of mind before he took that big step with Steve. Right now he still had some time before the rut fully took over. But it would get worse throughout the next few hours. He just hoped he could keep his promise and not hurt Steve.
“Shh. I got you, sweetheart,” Tony promises and he kisses Steve again.
He hasn’t seen the city in sometime. He was usually cooped up at home to train for becoming an Avenger. The only times he really left the compound was to go to school or if he and his papa went out. He enjoyed their outings and the stories his papa would tell him.
A painful cry can be heard in the background.
“You know I’m right.”
“Because I knew you’d act like that. You’d be angry and disappointed. I just wanted to figure it out by myself and pretend it never happened.”
not ready. They were all damaged and needed extra time. Surely the world could understand that.
“So Peter huh?” Tony grins and places both hands over Steve’s protruding middle.
Steve takes a deep breath and pushes as hard as he can. He moves his hand away quickly, and cries out when the head inches forward. The doctor replaces his hand with her own, and with another strong push, the head is out and cradled in her hands.
The pain is unlike anything he’s ever felt. It didn’t compare to the time when he lost his parents; not even close. It was a different kind of hurt. Not that he didn’t grieve when he lost his parents, but it had been Steve that saved him from his pain. It had always been Steve.
“You know-” Pepper begins and Tony just knows what she’s going to say next. “-married life would suit you.”
Steve lets out a yawn and reaches for Tony’s hand, interlacing their fingers. He doesn’t fall back asleep right away. His mind is racing, preventing him from finding any rest. He traces his finger along one of Tony’s, relishing the familiar feeling of rough skin against his own.
“They’d hurt me. Everyday they would take turns beating me. And if that didn’t work, I’d get locked inside this room…” Steve pauses to take a breath, hating how shaky it comes out. His eyes burn with tears and he has to squeeze them shut.
Then finally Steve speaks, “I’m sorry.”
The alpha laughs. “You don’t deserve anything. Be grateful with what I have given you. You’re lucky to be alive, Omega. I could’ve left you in that ice.”
“Tired, mostly. Going back in the ice sounds pretty good right now.”
“You want to go?”
Steve screams.
Peter sniffs and lifts his head, showing off his red rimmed eyes. “Papa, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I-I-I didn’t mean it. I swear.”
I got some new ideas for this story and I can’t wait to write it! Some is angsty and sad but this whole story has been this way so 🤷♀️
“It’s Steve,” FRIDAY informs. Tony’s blood grows cold and he’s out of bed in seconds.
“Look, Steve I know i said anything but I can’t get involved with this kind of stuff anymore. The team is yours now.”
“Damn. You sure you don’t want just me? I think the kid votes yes.”
“How was school?” Tony decides to change the subject.
“Honey, our teenager is pregnant. We fucked up.”
I hope you all enjoyed this update! The next one will have some of Tony’s pov and then him and Peter will meet up again. Thank you so much for reading! I love you all! ❤️
I wonder how Steve’s birthday is going to go 😉 I’ll update as soon as I can! I enjoy writing this story and I writing for all of you wonderful people 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
Pepper lays a hand over his shoulder when she notices the tears that gather in his eyes. Steve welcomes the touch, happy to have her comfort again.
“Who are you?” Tony questions. “What is this place?”
The breakfast Tony prepares is nice and Steve accepts it as an apology. Tony refuses to let French toast and bacon be enough and promises that he’ll make this the best Valentine’s Day ever. Steve wishes he wouldn’t.
Steve chokes out a sob and casts his head down. Tony urges him to lift it and their eyes meet again.
The warmth disappears, emitting a disappointed cry from Steve. Tony strokes Steve’s cock and ducks down to take the head in his mouth, sucking softly. Steve’s hips stutter and with a cry he comes down Tony’s throat. Tony hums as he swallows every single drop of Steve’s release.
They’re getting closer to the entrance when Peter rushes up to him and calls out, “Mr. Stark!”
Tony moves to get around the island and get to Steve, only to stop when Steve takes a step back.
Happy New Year, everyone! I hope 2021 is kinder to all of us!
“I wanted to be alone. I told you this.”
“Oh. I’m sorry for-”
“I guess. But not me. I want my uncle Sam to do it. He’d be perfect. I just want to be Spider-Man.”
“Yeah…”
“It’s a big step,” Steve says.
“You did a lot more than that.” Tony rises to his feet and moves toward his friend. He lays a hand over his shoulder. “I owe you big time for keeping them safe.”
Tony grumbles some kind of response. Steve thanks the doctor and once again they’re left alone.
The alpha above him picks up on the name and his lips curl into an evil grin. “He can’t save you. He’s not your mate. Why don’t you be good for him anyway? Put on a good show. Just like you always do.”
Steve nods. But he can’t help the shiver of fear that runs up his spine.
“Um...um…”
As if on cue, the lock on the door clicks and opens. The two alpha’s Tony recognizes from before enter the room, but it’s not their presence that has him fueling with rage. His mate is held tightly in their grasp and dragged into the room, his head hanging between his shoulders.
“Sorry.” Peter blushes. “I’m just curious.”
“Hi.” Tony continues to run his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You trying to wake the kid up?”
The first night with Peter since coming home is harder than Steve thought it was going to be. Steve’s thankful he’s not alone to deal with the late-night feedings and fussy tantrums. Bucky, Natasha, and Sam all volunteered to help out. Having the extra set of hands was a life saver.
Peter sighs sadly. “Okay.”
“-and I felt bad for almost killing him. God knows I don’t need a lawsuit. I invited him back to SI-”
He allows Steve to schedule the first appointment and get a glimpse of the baby before he takes it all away. He feels he at least owes Steve that much.
“Yeah. But hey, we don’t have to spoil him. Trust me, material things aren’t that important.”
“Sorry,” Bucky mutters and makes sure he’s standing beside Steve’s head. “You’re doing good. He’s almost here. About damn time, huh?”
But he stays, making sure he doesn’t interact for long. He sits down on one of the sofas, the world around him blurring. If only the pain would do the same.
“I know. But we can still visit him and we’ll be distracted when we’re not. We have to get his room in order.”
“I know. Sorry. This is just-” Tony releases a breath, leaning back on his haunches and running a hand through his already messed up hair. “Fuck, Steve! I don’t know what to do! I never thought-”
“Okay, okay. It’s bedtime.”
When Peter enters his uncle’s apartment, he’s not surprised to find his other uncle crying. Realizing he’s been caught, Bucky quickly wipes his eyes and stands up from the couch to greet his husband and nephew.
He leaves and shuts the door.
The rest of the night goes exactly like Tony expected. Peter is up every few hours demanding food, cuddles, or a new diaper. Though Tony enjoyed their cuddling sessions more than the smelly diapers, he had made a promise to both Steve and himself that he would be the best father he could possibly be. He wanted to be hands on and do all the dirty work. It was part of the job description.
“He should’ve fought harder.”
Tony frowns. “You? What do you mean?”
“I’m sorry. I won’t step out of line again. Alpha, I’m sorry.”
“Wow. Tony Stark is standing right in front of me. Man. If Riley was here to see this.”
Steve pulls back just enough so that their eyes can meet. He cups Tony’s face and brings him closer, connecting their lips. Tony responds instantly, moving his lips along with Steve’s, swiping his tongue along Steve’s bottom lip and begging for access.
Steve tries again, even though he already knows he’ll get the same response. He ends the call and presses his phone against his forehead, the urge to throw it across the room tempting. He takes a breath to calm himself, only to choke on the air when his belly spasms painfully.
Peter sniffs and shakes his head. “Please?”
He rubs tenderly at the spot where the new life is growing. “I’ll protect you,” he whispers. It’s a promise he’s made to all of them, but this time he will do everything in his power not to break another.
“I know it’s tough but he wanted you to have this.”
Sam takes a moment to think of an answer for the difficult question, but before he can voice how he feels, Bruce is adding his two cents.
It’s not until they’re stepping out of the elevator and into Tony’s penthouse does Steve become aware of his surroundings. He still comes off as hesitant and unsure, but there’s a hint of curiosity in his eyes. It’s amusing to watch his reaction.
“No, Pete, that’s not it. I guess I just...forgot what this was like. The last time I was around everyone was when...never mind.”
“You’re not. I know that face, Steve. If this is about being alone, remember that you’re not. I’m here.”
If they ever did show their faces again, he’d be ready.
“Great guy, huh? Wanna tell me about him?”
“I...would you? I’m sorry. I know you probably miss your own space,” Steve says.
“Too late isn’t it?” Steve snatches his clothes and retreats to the connecting bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
Steve grits his teeth. It was like Tony was purposely trying to piss him off.
Again, his fault.
He makes his way back up until he’s kissing Tony’s lips again. Tony kisses back slowly and Steve feels arms wrap around him, pulling him closer. Steve pulls back slightly, finding Tony’s eyes still closed but a small smile on his lips.
But I swear I haven’t forgotten about my other stories!
Tony leans in and pecks Pepper on the cheek, then he’s leaving the office to meet his new interns. All he can think about is Steve and the pup while he shakes hands with SI’s future employees. He still has his doubts, but the more he thinks about the baby, the more he yearns for it to be his.
Tony wanted to believe all of those things. He saw the way Steve reacted when he opened up; he remembered the screams and the crying. How could that be made up? Unless he really was just a great manipulator.
The move back to New York wasn’t for a couple of more weeks. Steve had wanted to wait until Peter was a little older before they packed up and moved to their forever home. It was exciting to be going back, but at the same time there’s a fear that hangs over Steve. New York was his home, but it was also the home of his abuser.
“Please? Let’s talk. We need to.”
He settles into bed with a book, deciding to educate himself on parenthood before dozing off. He’s already read a few chapters, finding the information both useful and overwhelming. It’s a lot to grasp and he knew once he finished the book that he wouldn’t be an expert on babies, but the information is comforting in a way. He felt it would improve his skills and aid him.
“Why do you have him?” Steve asks.
“So you’re gonna walk out on me? Is that it?”
“What did you expect? I can afford the best and I hate to say it but this place is it. I’d do anything for you....even this I guess.”
Their eyes meet and that’s when Bucky notices how dull they appear. Steve smiles weakly at his friend, then it’s faltering and his face contorts in pain. He glances down, a panicked look crossing his features at what he finds.
His skin is fair and unblemished; the pink hue that has spread across it is the only thing that taints it. His hair is golden, bright like the sun. Tony wishes he could see his face, but with the blindfold secured around his eyes, Tony’s wish can’t be granted.
“You to wake me up with more than just kisses. You can keep going.” Tony brings Steve back for another kiss and then tries pushing his head down, but Steve easily overpowers him and breaks free completely from Tony’s grasp.
“It’s part of the plan. That’s all it is.”
Fuck. They knew.
Peter gulps and unbuttons his jeans, then he lifts his shirt, exposing his flat belly. He flinches when a gel is applied to his skin.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
Steve groans again, gritting his teeth when the contraction peaks. The pup drops lower, creating an uncomfortable pressure deep in his pelvis. He manages to glance around the room, heart sinking at the realization that he’d be giving birth here and alone.
He’s about to give up and retreat to his tower and hide away, but then he spots Peter crossing the street. Tony kills the ignition and slips his sunglasses over his eyes, and after a quick check in the mirror, gets out of the vehicle.
“Hmm?”
It’s a struggle to keep his eyes open. Three figures are looming over him. Then everything fades to black.
“How is he?” Tony asks, gesturing with his chin toward the ceiling.
Just thinking about his father brings tears to his eyes. Peter wants nothing more than to go home and lock himself away to release all of the hurt. But nothing was going to take his pain away. It was always going to be there.
“Whoa, whoa. Who said anything about being romantically involved? We’re not even mates!” Tony hisses, eyes darting quickly in the direction of the closed door.
“I don’t feel that bad anymore for leaving my kids for this,” Clint laughs.
“But you’re not! How many times have you-” Tony stops himself before he can make the situation worse. But it’s too late. The damage is already done. Steve knows what he’s referring to. “I didn’t mean-Steve, it’s not like that. I didn’t-”
“Of course. Where’s Tony?”
Peter’s eyes widen at the amount placed in his hand. “Whoa! Mr. Stark, I can’t accept this. It’s too much!”
“Uh-oh. Is it the pups or the alpha?”
“Uh...maybe later.” Peter isn’t ready for them to meet yet.
“Good.” Sam smiles and his eyelids grow heavy. “Don’t do anything stupid while I take a nap.”
Pepper smiles softly and lays a hand over his shoulder. Her touch was nice and offered comfort, but it didn’t compare to Steve’s touch.
“How could you?” Natasha takes another drink and sits back, crossing her right leg over her left. “You weren’t here.”
“How do you want to do this?” Tony asks, smiling softly down at his mate and carding his fingers through the omega’s hair.
“This wasn’t too much, was it?” Tony asks.
“You didn’t have to take them in. They were mine to-”
“No, sir, you don’t,” Jarvis informs.
“He’s good. He’s with Nat outside. I was really worried. For a second I thought I lost you.”
“Papa, you look just like me!” Peter exclaims and he rushes over to give Steve a hug. Steve smiles down at his son and wraps his arms around him.
“Okay.” Tony appears more at ease. “Do you need anything?”
He does as he’s told, keeping his gaze cast down and his mouth shut. He doesn’t feel like talking anyway.
“That’s enough,” Bruce cuts in and sends Clint a warning look. “Tony didn’t have to be here but-”
“I promise!”
“No! Go away!”
“It just takes practice,” Steve agrees and copies Tony, groaning slightly from being on the floor. “I’m getting too old for this.”
Tony pulls up to the cemetery and shuts off the ignition, a heavy sigh leaving him as he peers out the tinted window and toward the cemetery gates. He practically talked himself into coming, otherwise he’d still be cooped up in his lab and fighting the urge to drink.
“Just until I can? I’m sorry. I’m just…never mind. You don’t have to.”
Tony huffs. “I do. After what happened between us-”
“No. Actually, wait. Yeah. Can you...play that video again? The Christmas party?”
Steve nods. “You won’t have to worry about him. He’s...he’s gone. For good. I have a mate now.”
Morgan is still crying when Tony steps through the front door of the apartment. Her cries have gotten louder, more painful to hear.
Tony rarely did any of the cooking, and there was a good reason for that. Steve’s lost count of how many times their kitchen was almost burned down. The alpha was getting better in the cooking department. He still hasn't mastered how to keep flour from getting everywhere, but at least the kitchen wasn’t filling up with smoke.
Steve is at the stove, his back turned as he finishes up the bacon and French toast. Tony doesn’t take his usual seat at the island where Steve has already set up his plate, and instead he comes up behind the omega and wraps his arms around him.
“He won’t,” Steve interrupts. “He’s a good kid.”
He didn’t want that for his children. He just wanted them to live a normal, happy life. Was that too much to ask for?
Movement on his left has Steve turning away from her and setting his fiery gaze on the beta. Steve sniffs the air, his nose wrinkling. The scent was off. There was a hint of sweetness lingering in the air.
Though he was coming around and grasping the idea of parenthood, he still had those moments of doubting both himself and his abilities. Nothing was the same since Peter was born. Steve’s life had been turned upside down. He had a new baby to care for and his relationship with Tony appeared more problematic than ever. It was like they had taken one step forward and then twenty back. Any ounce of a relationship they had left was crumbling away.
“I’ll get him and you find our son,” Tony says.
“Hmm.” Steve ponders. The more he thought about leaving and starting over, the more appeasing it sounded. “Maybe once the pup is born.”
The door is opening again and Tony is returning, an ice pack in hand and another can of pain relieving spray. “I got more,” Tony explains, giving the can a little shake before setting it down on the small table near Steve’s bed. “Oh and these guys,” Tony gestures toward the still open door.
“Okay, okay. It’s alright.” Tony takes their son in his arms, rocking him gently when he continues to cry. “Hey, kiddo relax. You’re okay.”
Peter sighs and stretches out his fingers again, letting his palm roam over the shield the statue has in its hand.
“He’s on his way,” Natasha informs and she rises to her feet.
“I want you, too. I want you so bad.”
I really wanted to update this today and I'm so glad I did! I'm sorry it's an okay chapter but I promise this story is going somewhere. These two are just dealing with a lot and have a long road ahead of them. I have plenty of time to update now since I can't return to work for a while for showing Covid symptoms. I'm getting tested tomorrow and go from there I guess.
Tony didn’t want to know what those words meant.
Natasha shrugs slightly. “You missed the funeral.”
Tony sighs heavily. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. Now get out of here so I can clean up. You’re not doing a damn thing today.”
His own mark is still tingling. Steve had bit him during their second round of mating. The feeling of having the gland broken was indescribable. For so long Tony wondered if he would ever create a bond with an omega. He had accepted living out the rest of his life alone. But that all changed when Steve entered the picture. Now Tony had a mate and pup on the way.
Tony bites down hard on his bottom lip.
Peter’s eyes roam over the variety of options, his stomach growling in response to the delicious looking food and smells. He immediately goes for the pizza box, a smile forming over his face at the sight of the Brooklyn styled pie.
Peter nods again.
“Guess now we can start shopping,” Tony announces later that evening when they’re both curled up on the sofa. Tony is sipping from a steaming cup of coffee while Steve works on finishing his chamomile tea.
“You don’t need to worry now. This kid’s not going anywhere.”
Steve kicks the alpha a few more times until he falls still. With both threats down, Steve is able to catch his breath and compose himself. He spins when someone approaches him, ready to issue another attack, only to realize it’s his mate and he freezes.
“I know. And I guess he is the reason. He did bring us back together.”
He lunges at Steve again and presses him up against the wall. He wraps both hands around the omega’s neck, smirking at the sharp intake of air Steve takes.
Peter’s eyes roam over the space. It was simple with a queen size bed in the center, a large acrylic painting of New York above the bed, a bedside table with a lamp, and a dresser against the wall.
Steve eases off and his body slumps back. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”
The tears break free and run down his face, and this time he doesn’t bother to fight it. He sobs, his body shaking from how intense they are. He slides down to the floor and buries his face into his hands, screaming until his throat burns worse than the alcohol.
“I’m not a perfect alpha.”
Sam shrugs. “Do what you want, Pete. We’re here no matter what.”
“Oh. Um…” Steve’s brows furrowed. “He didn’t. I just-”
“The elevator is this way,” Tony gestures for Steve to follow.
Tony felt helpless whenever that happened. He had made the mistake of trying to help position her, only to have Steve get upset and bite his head off. Tony made sure to give his husband space whenever it was time to feed Morgan, not wanting to be in the way as Steve liked to call it.
“Steve, stop.” Tony’s had enough of being ignored. This time Steve does acknowledge him. “Why are you leaving?”
“He asked where you were. I told him you were busy and if he wanted to schedule a meeting with you again he can go through me.”
“It’s okay,” Steve assures, but he can tell his words do little to break the tension in the air. He doesn’t want his friends to act like they’re walking on eggshells around him. Tony’s name wasn’t going to be forbidden.
“That doesn’t mean anything,” Bucky grumbles.
“Not even Nat.”
Steve eyes his mate, searching for any indication that Tony was lying. He can’t find one. “Okay,” he says with a smile. “And this breakfast...you did it all by yourself?”
Tony glances up at the other two people in the room, silently begging them for some privacy. Sam nods and gestures for Bucky to follow. The ex-assassin is hesitant to leave his best friend, but then he’s forced to give in and follow Sam out of the room.
He feels a little hopeful too. Maybe they could try one more time. Maybe this would be the one that takes.
“N-no.” Steve manages to grit out. The contraction is beginning to taper off. “They’re getting closer. Seven minutes, I think. Maybe five.”
“Hey, kid. How’d you sleep?”
“I get that. We all have a lot to unpack. Hell, my life story is insane. Trust me I get it. Is there anyone I can call for you? Surely you have someone here that you know.”
“I can try. Just until I can...figure this out.”
The door opens and Alexander Pierce steps into the room, his faithful dogs with him. Tony growls in warning when one gets too close to Steve, and he lunges forward when they issue a kick to Steve’s side.
“Fine,” Peter agrees.
“Sneaking candy?” Tony questions when he enters the room, smirking when his son jumps at the sound of his voice. “You’re too easy to scare, kiddo.”
“And you still went? Jesus, Steve what the hell were you thinking?”
“Tony-”
Steve stays near Tony’s side the entire time, holding his hand and speaking encouraging words. Tony appreciates the comfort. Lord knows he was going to need it.
“Nah,” Steve decides, though the look in his eyes says something totally different. “This works. This is fine.”
He stops himself and moves back; that other part of his brain has switched back on, even for just a moment, to remind him that what he was considering was wrong. This wasn’t who Tony was.
“Yuck!” Harley whines and pushes his plate away.
Tony grows silent. He honestly doesn’t know when their lives will find a sense of normalcy. Morgan had changed a lot. Tony doesn’t regret her and the way she altered everything. And he knows deep down Steve feels the same way.
“You can come to us, you know that right? Anything at all, we’re all ears.”
“Yeah? What were you expecting?”
“Still sleeping. Being born must be exhausting,” Steve chuckles. It was exhausting for both of them. Steve was ready to shut his eyes and drift off himself.
Tony’s hand comes up to rest on Steve’s. “Sweetheart, I’m much worse. What kind of father murders their own children?”
“Stop! Stop! I’ll let you go.”
“Steve?” Tony calls out to his mate, praying that Steve would look at him. But Tony’s not sure if he really wants that. He’s afraid to see how much pain his mate is truly in.
Hello! It’s time to welcome baby number 2! Thank you guys for being so awesome! I love all of you. And thank you to my friend, Marisa for helping me out with this chapter 😊
A new mission has been assigned and Steve knows going out in the field wasn’t an option. He could easily send Sam or even Bucky in his place, but it would raise suspicions. Steve found himself between a rock and a hard place.
He had already broken one promise to Steve and he wasn’t going to break another.
“Did he ever keep them?” Tony asks. Peter peers up at him, noticing the tears in his dad’s eyes. He hadn’t seen him cry, and wondered if he’d ever see it.
Natasha rolls her eyes and climbs off him, and Peter gulps down the air his body desperately needs. She frowns down at him and shakes her head.
“He’s really scared,” Steve says.
A gray rocking chair is set up in the left corner of the room, and beside it is a dresser, the rich, espresso color matching those of the crib pieces laying near Tony. On the opposite side of the room, the changing table is already built. There’s an empty spot next to it that Steve assumes is meant for the crib Tony is currently working on.
Steve yawns again and works to lift his shirt so that he can nurse. Tony carefully passes him their son and Steve tries to get him in a comfortable position.
Steve scoffs. “Something like that. The effect it had on him was negative. Like I said, if it can make good great, then you can imagine what it does to someone bad. He wanted control of everything. He believed that alphas were more superior and omegas had no place in the world other than for breeding. I gathered a team and together we set out to make things right. At the time I didn’t know we were chasing Hydra. They knew how to keep a low profile. I lost my best friend on that assignment. There was nothing I could do.”
“Soon. He’s just extra tired because of the baby,” Tony replies.
“Pregnant?”
“You’re doing a damn good job, Buck. Steve would be happy.”
Peter only shrugs. “I’ve just heard a few things.”
But deep down he ached for a child. It would be difficult to raise a child in the world he lives in, but he would give up the superhero life. He was willing to hang up the shield or pass it onto someone else just so he could have a child of his own.
“Of course you do. I’ll try my best to answer whatever you throw at me. Now get out of here and go watch a movie. And not some cheesy, old one.”
“I don’t know. Maybe...maybe you just can’t do this.”
More tears escape and this time Peter doesn’t bother wiping them away. He brings his knees up to his chest and wraps his arms around them, sobbing quietly. The pain was still fresh, and he honestly didn’t know if it would ever go away. Time was supposed to heal, but Peter wasn’t sure if he truly believed that.
Bucky frowns. “That’s a classic! We saw it like ten times.”
Tony doesn’t reply and with his drink in hand, makes his way to the sofa and lowers himself down a few seats away. He takes a drink, enjoying the familiar burn as it travels down his throat.
“Honey?” Tony calls out when he enters the bedroom again. Steve has just finished nursing Morgan and he’s in the middle of burping her. She squirms in his lap, clearly not fond of the position he has her in. “You got it?” Tony asks, coming closer to step in and help.
“I don’t need a reminder,” Tony retorts and downs the drink, not even grimacing from the intense and fiery taste.
To his surprise, Tony doesn’t move back to his original spot. He stays nearby, keeping his gaze on Steve to make sure he is okay. Being this close to the alpha is comforting. Steve can’t help but want to be closer.
Just thinking about his mate makes him nervous all over again. He’s wondering how he’s doing standing in front of the press. Tony’s probably used to these types of things, but Steve still doesn’t understand how he can do them so easily.
“He can do it,” Peter assures and he turns his head toward Tony. “He can. He’s-he’s got this.”
“Yeah.” There was no point in denying it. Steve had turned his life upside down, and in the best way possible. “If I could go home now I would.”
“She wasn’t having it,” Tony explains as they stroll together through the courtyard. There’s a slight chill in the air, providing the perfect excuse for them to walk close to each other.
It’s not for long. Peter was improving, and the doctor assured him that it would be a few more days at least until he could go home. It could be worse. At least, that’s what Steve tries to tell himself.
“We’re not naming the baby that. You’re terrible with names.”
“I know, but don’t you want to see the baby?”
“Can they stay with us?” Steve asks, glancing over at his mate and showing off his teary eyes. Tony doesn’t even look up, too engrossed in the task of tucking in the older pups. Harley yawns and curls up beside his brother, eyes falling shut almost instantly.
“Idiot,” Peter mutters to himself and exits the bathroom. He doesn’t bother tidying up his room or trying to make the space comfortable. Flash was still a bully, and they were far from friends.
“I do. Tony, I swear I do. I know you won’t hurt me like he did. I'm just...nervous.”
Sam wasn’t here now to brag, unfortunately; he was with Steve and Natasha on their newest mission doing God knows what in God knows where. Maybe he should have paid more attention than coloring.
“They’re alive?” Tony asks in disbelief. Just hours before Steve had told him otherwise, and now he was learning that the pups Steve had thought he lost were in fact alive and under SHIELD’s care.
Steve is exhausted by the time they get back up to the penthouse, and the first thing he does is go up the stairs to the bedroom. He lets out a sigh and plops down on the bed, eyes falling shut the moment his head hits the pillow. Not even a few minutes later a knock on the door disturbs him and he sits up right when Tony enters the room.
“Hi, sweetheart. You’re home early.” He frowns.
James, being the bravest of the three, pokes his head out first and sniffs the air, searching for the person behind the voice. His nose wrinkles and his brows draw together in confusion.
“What the hell was that?” Sam asks after Bucky’s finished.
It just wasn’t fair that his papa wouldn’t be there to see any of those things happen. His papa was supposed to be there for his graduation, his first day of college, his college graduation, his wedding, the birth of his future children. His papa was supposed to be there for all of that.
Peter instantly calms down the moment he’s back in his father’s arms and the bottle is placed to his lips. He sucks greedily, drowning down the warm liquid. Tony chuckles at his eagerness.
There was nothing to worry about. Steve was safe under Happy’s care. Tony trusted Happy with his life, and he knew the beta was the right choice to keep his mate safe.
Steve can’t help but flinch when Bruce begins the exam. Tony immediately senses his nervous energy and reaches for his hand, interlacing their fingers and offering a reassuring smile.
“I love you, Uncle Bucky.”
“Look at me. Darling, I love you. I’m sorry for what I did. I panicked and reacted wrongly. But I’m so so sorry. I want this to work. I want us to be a family. I want you.”
“He’s being weird, Tony,” Steve sighs harshly into the phone. He’s already had this conversation with his husband, but it was like he was the only one taking Peter’s new attitude seriously.
Sometimes heroes die. And Peter lost his.
“He better not be pushing himself too hard.”
Peter had always been around for the training portion, but never an actual mission. The closest he got was the time he snuck onto the jet. He doesn’t regret sneaking into a mission, he regrets not doing anything to help his family when they needed him.
“You didn’t know. How could you? I didn’t even know his name until the other day. Crazy, isn’t it? For years I’ve been under his watch and never knew his name.”
“This isn’t about Steve, is it?” Natasha asks.
“Thanks.”
Tony is still laughing at the state his friend is in. “Nice beard. It’s a good look.”
“I’m fine,” Steve says, hating how broken he sounds. He takes a deep breath to compose himself.
“I think I’ve decided. You’re definitely a Rogers.”
“What?” Steve asks, suddenly feeling shy. His face grows hot. “What?”
Tony finds his son hiding out in his tent one afternoon, and he’s not surprised to find Dodger inside with him. Tony pulls back the flap and pokes his head inside, immediately greeted with a happy bark from Dodger.
“Full,” Steve gasps when Tony shifts and his cock hits that spot inside of him. “Shit, Tony, that feels good.”
Nothing. Not a single appearance from Alexander Pierce. It was both relieving and uneasy at the same time. Steve warned not to underestimate him, and though Tony promised he wouldn’t, a part of him can’t help but wonder if they’ve won.
“It’s okay. And yeah it’s not. I don’t know, maybe I can be a decent omega here. Maybe I have a chance of fitting in.”
Tony smiles and leans in to give his son another kiss. He remembers when it used to be Steve he was kissing goodnight, but that was all in the past now.
Steve is still indecisive. It’s pathetic.
Steve nods in understanding and keeps the drive silent. Well, as silent as he can. He peers in Peter’s direction every few minutes, wishing he could read what was on his son’s worried mind. He has a vague idea about the thoughts swimming in there, but he doesn’t want to pry. That would only make Peter more uncomfortable.
His daughter pulls away from his chest, emitting another whimper. Steve tries to comfort her, only for his attempts to fail and her whimpers rise in volume. Her cries send him into a panic. They’ll hear her.
Bucky’s tongue swipes along his bottom lip before he bites down on it. “I do need a distraction.”
“Papa!” Peter cries and jumps out of Tony’s lap to get to Steve. He giggles when he’s lifted up and wrapped in a big hug. “Papa, you get lots and lots of kisses too!”
“Maybe if you were doing your part-”
There’s a moment of silence before Bruce speaks up.
“Tony-”
“What’s in here?” Tony gestures to the closed door they pass on the upper level. He reaches out for the knob only to pause when Peter stops him.
“I-I know.” Steve sniffs and pulls away so that he can sit up and wipe away the tears that don’t stop spilling. “I’m happy. I am, but I’m scared. They don’t really know me and...and what if I can’t be a good mother. They suffered because of me and-”
Those same words have been said before. Steve didn’t trust them. He made the mistake of trusting them once, only to learn that the pup he had given birth to was not the one Alpha wanted and it was taken away.
Tony pauses, brows crinkling together in confusion. He opens his mouth to speak, only to shut it and clasp a hand over it. Steve immediately knows what’s going to happen next.
“She’s too young and who’s going to watch her for us?”
Morgan’s eyes flutter open at the sound of his voice and lets out a yawn. Tony chuckles and reaches for one of her hands, gently brushing his fingers along her smaller ones. Morgan is wide awake now.
“It’s good for me.” Tony shrugs and takes another sip from his mug. “Oh come on stop looking at me like that. One cup won’t kill me.”
“Homeschool.”
“No. This is about you. I want you to feel good.” Tony leans down to kiss Steve. He waits a few moments before moving again, rolling his hips slowly, ignoring his own needs to meet Steve’s.
A choked sob escapes him at the thought of his son. He had no idea where the little pup was being held and if he was okay. Steve had promised to protect his son and he had failed. He had failed all of his babies.
“Not yet.”
Steve whimpers when a kiss is placed to his forehead. The alpha eventually pulls out and tucks himself back into his slacks. Steve grimaces at the feel of their mixed fluids between his legs, and one glance down shows his thighs stained with the mixture and a bit of blood.
“I know,” Peter says softly, his eyes flickering in Bucky’s direction again, then quickly back to Sam’s. “I guess it’s just easier to pretend it never happened.”
“I’ll be on the jet,” Natasha says before making her way to the jet where Bucky, Sam, and Bruce are waiting.
“I wish you would’ve said something sooner. I don’t know who this other alpha is and if he’s still pursuing Steve-”
“What? Jarvis, what are you-”
Bucky sighs sadly. “I know. You’re almost there, right?”
“Who? Bar-”
“It hurts. I just want him back,” Peter sobs.
Peter nods. “Okay.”
“He did for a brief moment. He got hungry and though I offered to order him something to eat-”
Both his sons whine and pout, their bottom lips quivering and their blue eyes bright with tears. Tony sighs in defeat. His kids knew how to play him.
“Hey,” he greets with a small smile.
Something inside the desk drawer catches his eye and his brows furrow. There’s two envelopes inside, one with his name scribbled on one and his dad’s on the other. Peter takes both. He doesn’t open the one for his dad, and a part of him is afraid to open the one for him, but his curiosity beats the fear and he tears into the envelope.
“They will.”
“And the rest of Hydra?”
“Forget it,” Steve mutters, choosing again not to look Tony in the eye. “Can you just go?”
“I love you, too,” Tony confesses. “Do you know how hard it is not to love you? I thought I could move on but I can’t.”
He didn’t want to admit it, but now he was finally starting to understand what Tony had been talking about. He loved Dodger, but the constant following was starting to get under his skin. Steve blames his pregnancy. As of late, it’s been the reason for many things, his mood swings being one of them.
“Alexander. You don’t have to call him that anymore. He has a name. Though I’d prefer to call him other names.”
Peter was everything Steve needed and more. They had their bad and good days. Raising a child alone wasn’t a walk in the park, and more often than not Steve found himself struggling. Luckily he had his friends to help him when he was on the verge of a meltdown.
“So tomorrow?” Peter double checks once they’re outside the tower.
Bucky sighs. “I know I’m not him and I’m not trying to be, but you’re still my nephew and I care about you. A lot.”
“I know. I think I better get him some flowers. Something. I don’t know. I really screwed up, Pep. I honestly don’t blame him for taking the ring off.”
After a while of lingering and chatting with a few other guests, Tony is led away from the party to be introduced to the leader behind all of this.
Tony sighs. “Honey, sooner or later we’ll have to come forward. What about when we send the kids to school-”
Tony crosses the room to get the couch. Peter is curled up under a blanket and sleeping peacefully. Tony almost doesn’t want to wake him. Tony pulls off the blanket and lifts his son with a small grunt. Peter stirs and his eyes flutter, only to shut again. He wraps his small arms around Tony’s neck.
Steve couldn’t even remember the last time he had gone on a date. It had been sometime during his relationship with Tony. They rarely went out in public, especially during the first few weeks of their relationship. The last thing they had needed was their pictures printed on all the news and gossip tabloids. Tony still made sure to take Steve out, even if that meant somewhere secluded or just staying in and enjoying each other’s company.
He doesn’t dwell on those thoughts for long, and instead he focuses on being with Tony right now. His eyes shut and he drifts off to sleep.
“You’d be off too if…” Bucky stops himself and takes a deep breath. “Never mind. Anyone hungry?”
“Could you take over? I need to get dressed,” Steve says.
“Dad, he’s fine. We were just-”
Steve nods and allows Sam to lead him back to the party.
Steve sniffs and peers up when he hears Tony enter the room, his eyes shiny with tears. “You came back?”
“How are you going to do it?” Happy asks as they make their way toward the Audi parked on the street.
Tony sighs sadly and sits back down near Steve, not caring if his jeans are wet and uncomfortable. “Hey,” he says softly. “I won’t hurt you like he did. I’m not that kind of alpha.”
He grows braver and trails his hand down until he reaches the band of Tony’s charcoal gray slacks. He peers up at Tony, getting a nod of approval. His teeth sink into his bottom lip as he unbuckles the belt secured around Tony’s waist and pops open the button of his slacks. Steve slides his hand down the front, feeling Tony for the first time in months.
“You did a hell of a job.” Tony glances back down at the photo, grinning widely. “I love it. I love you.”
The world was always going to need saving, whether he carried on as a hero or not. The Avengers could withstand anything thrown at them, even losing one of their own. They would be able to carry on if Steve stepped down.
The bed has become too uncomfortable for Steve to lie in, and after his doctor suggests he try walking around, Bucky eases him out of bed and leads him around the room. For a while Steve is able to pace around the room, one hand holding his belly for support and the other gripping onto Bucky.
It was at that point when Steve wished he could have sent the alpha away, but he knew better than to step out of line. It wasn’t his place. They were supposed to mate. It was all part of the plan.
“What about the baby?” Peter asks. He doesn’t miss the way his uncle Bucky tenses and grips his fork a little tighter. “Uh I mean...you know I don’t want to...be in the way.”
Those same words have been said before, and again before every single one of Steve’s missions. It was how they said goodbye.
Steve nods.
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll buy a bassinet for your place. Come on.”
The fight was going to be rough, but no one ever walked away from a fight unscathed. He’s reminded of his son and the other pups before him; the ones he had failed to protect. He would fight for them.
Yay I’m finally updating this one! Sorry that I got stuck. Endings are hard for me and since this one is close to wrapping up, I panicked and struggled to come up with the next chapter. It’s all coming together now...I think.
That was all that mattered.
“He’s fine,” Tony assures and he crawls back into bed, sighing in content now that he’s close to Steve again. “Kiddo is out like a light.”
He can’t tear his gaze away from the little boy in his arms. It still hasn’t him yet that he had just given birth. The experience was something he was never going to forget. And though it had been difficult and the most painful thing he’s ever suffered from, he’d do it all again if he had to.
Natasha nods. “I love this little guy. I’d do anything for him.”
The smile that forms over Alexander’s face has Tony’s stomach coiling tightly. He braces himself for another punch or kick; something, but it never comes. That scares him even more.
“Oh that’s just Jarvis,” Tony explains.
It’s his close friends that help him back on his feet. Tony figures they’re tired of seeing him deteriorate. He doesn’t protest, but he doesn’t tell them that they’re efforts aren’t working. He deserves to suffer. He doesn’t deserve happiness. Not when Steve lost his.
Upon arriving home, he’s greeted with a quiet apartment. Evidence of dinner remains on the stove, filling the apartment with delectable aroma. It goes ignored.
“And choose your words wisely if you can. I think you’ve caused enough harm.”
That bit of happiness disappears and the heavy sadness hovers over them again.
“Did I- he jumped in front of me!”
Steve chuckles and leans back in his chair, watching as Tony bonds with their son. He wondered how it was supposed to work now that his relationship with Tony was over. He didn’t know if Tony would stick around and help, but the past couple of days, Tony had proved that he was going to do more than help with their son. He was going to love him unconditionally, and be the best father he could possibly be.
Steve smiles. “Sounds exciting to me,” he says, then his smile is faltering. “I hate missing everything.”
He makes it over to his locker and quickly begins turning the lock toward the first number of the combination. He misses it and curses to himself. He takes a deep breath and waits a second for his hands to quit shaking.
“I thought we weren’t-”
“It’ll be fine,” Steve offers a smile of reassurance and slips one hand free so that he can take Tony’s. “I’ll get better and...and we’ll be okay. We’ll be happy.”
It’s heartbreaking and Peter wishes he didn’t have the urge to run away and only consider his dad family. The team had been his family for as long as he could remember. He couldn’t leave them yet.
! I’m the worst person he should ever meet. I shouldn’t even be in his life! I’m a fuck up and all I did was hurt the one person I loved. How can he even want to meet me, Pep? I ruined his life.”
“Oh, thank you.” Steve steps further into the room. He’s still unsure and it must be noticeable because Happy frowns at him, then sighs heavily.
“Relax,” Bucky says and sits down on the sofa across from Tony. “I just want to talk.”
“So needy, huh, baby?” Tony croons and Steve whimpers in response. “I got you, sweetheart. I’ll make it up to you.”
Tony glares in Clint’s direction. “Nat, if you weren’t holding my son right now I’d have you kick his ass.”
Steve didn’t want to rush into bonding with Tony. They still had to learn more about each other. Tony was careful with his past, and Steve even more so. He kept his past close, probably closer than anyone should. The past had parts that weren’t always bad. Bucky, his old life, his mother; all of them were in there, hidden behind all of the trauma and abuse. Steve couldn’t let go completely.
There was nothing that could be done.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Tony says as if he can read Steve’s mind. “I designed these for you, big guy. These are made from the strongest metal on earth.”
He’s barely making it the door when the knocking starts. The frantic knocks are worrisome, but it’s the loud cries that have Tony opening the door as fast as he can.
