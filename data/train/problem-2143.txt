“That is
“Is there anything you think you could eat?”
John stands to run towards him just as he hears Murray yell out, "Hit the deck!"
John places both hands against the man’s shoulder and shakes, knowing from experience that he won’t wake from words alone. “Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,” he chants.
“But…”- and John can hear Sherlock wait for Lestrade to interrupt him again- “his last marriage…did not turn out well. I don’t want him to feel pressured into making a decision, doing what he thinks I want him to do. I want him to say yes because he
“Sherlock?” He tries to call, but his voice cracks with sleep. He clears his throat and calls louder, “Sherlock?”
He just lies in his hotel room and silently weeps.
Something about the way Sherlock says his name has John leaning in, and Sherlock meets him halfway.
But Sherlock had kissed him back. He tried to continue the kiss when John had to pull away, even snuggling up to John afterwards.
“What do you need?”
“Your feet are cold.”
“That’s nice of you,” John says insincerely.
John laughs. “Jesus, what the hell do you get up to? First I’m kidnapped by a crazy man asking after you and now you’re acting like it’s completely normal. Are you some kind of federal criminal? Should I be worried about MI5 knocking down my door any time soon?”
“The most dangerous man you’ve ever met and not my problem right now.” Sherlock goes back to eating.
The man’s head lolls to the side, his cheek pressed against John's temple.
John turns back to the machines and starts making coffee.
Sherlock feels a hesitant pressure against his right hand, bringing his attention to his senses rather than his own thoughts.
“I’ll throw up.”
"Dead." John's fist clenches in his lap. His wife died long ago.
“Oh! Of course, yeah.” John hastily replaces it and comes out with the most generic hand-lotion in the cabinet. He washes his hands and flips the cap open for Sherlock to sniff. “Better?”
“How does Skype later tonight sound?”
John reaches for them and clasps them in his own to still the tremors. His skin is dry and warm.
It’s not unusual for Sherlock to wake up before John, but he hasn’t ever left the bed before John has a chance to check on him.
Because there is nothing Sherlock won’t do to keep that from happening.
As John gets everything ready, Sherlock lowers the toilet lid and sits, leaning against the water tank. John is hyper-aware of Sherlock watching him, and tries to will down the flush threatening to rise up to his skin.
Sherlock snatches the robe and
John exhales hard in frustration at the missed sleep before memories of the previous night hit him with the force of a lorry.
“Mm.”
“Then that’s enough.”
“Are you still feeling nauseous?” John asks, trying to find something helpful to do to take his mind off of his incessant worry.
"Alright?" John asks. He retrieves a waste paper basket and places it on the floor in front of the junkie in case he needs to vomit again.
John can feel Sherlock's surprise and hesitance as his arms come up to cover his body with the flaps of his coat, giving John the illusion of more privacy.
So here he is, wandering the park, dark thoughts circling in his head.
But, John thinks, Sherlock wants to
Sherlock can practically hear the annoyed smile. Or was it an exasperated sigh? He isn’t sure, the two silences do sound very similar. But what he does hear is footsteps to his bedroom door.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Just tell me.”
“Gonna get your upper lip now,” John says quietly.
John turns from the sink and moves to stand in front of Sherlock.
“I know this may seem like basic stuff, but I need to say them. Now, is there anything that you’ll eat?”
John can’t believe this. “Well, your archenemy, according to him—Do people even have archenemies?”
"Try again for me?"
The other café-goers stare at his outcry, stare at the broken military man with a limp and a cane and an ego too large to even accept help from his own sister.
“May we sit?”
“Most other people wouldn’t have left me all bloody.” Sherlock’s eyes open, his gaze piercing into John’s.
Sherlock shivers at the cold air, and John rubs warmth back into his skin in apology. He can feel his calluses catching at Sherlock’s skin.
John wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, pulling him into an embrace. “You won’t,” John says with conviction. “There is nothing in the God forsaken world that can keep me apart from you. No man, no god, no law. Nothing.” John pulls away to hold Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Do you understand me?”
Mike chuckles. “Didn’t get much sleep, did’ya?”
At that same moment,  John feels an intense pressure at his shoulder that knocks the wind out of him and forces him to the ground.
the ca–”
“In a moment.”
John settles Sherlock into the cushions and hands him his cereal. “Eat as much of that as you can,” John says, sitting on the other side of the couch and starting in on his own breakfast.
Sherlock’s gaze darts about the room, looking wretched and confused. He’s breathing heavy, a hand to his chest.
Pocketing it, he turns in time to see the junkie blink his eyes open and groan.
“Er, he says so.”
At the end of the semester he passes his finals with points to spare.
wants to be that someone, he can admit.
He looks back down at his feet. “I just keep fucking up my relationship. And it’s all my fault.”
Sherlock swishes the water around in his mouth for a moment before spitting it back out into the bin, then gulping down the rest of the glass.
“...Okay.”
Nothing happens. No angry quip, no struggling against his bonds, nothing. His only movement is the shallow rise and fall of his chest.
John scoffs. “I can’t believe you.”
"I'll never get to meet her," John whispers.
John replaces his hands where they were on Sherlock’s back. Not moving, just resting there.
“Moisturizer.”
Sherlock shrugs. “I had just received a concussion, I was confused. I don’t know you nor your intentions. It wasn’t until after that I realized you were actually concerned that I conceded to stay.”
The stranger pouts and seethes, but allows John to clean the wound on his bottom lip. It’s full and too pretty of a mouth to fit for a man, but the softness of it makes up for the harshness of his other features—the sharp cheekbones, the gaunt face. John can’t help but think that if he lost the facial hair and were in top health, he would look lavishly posh.
Mrs. Hudson smiles at him. “This better be a one-off!” she toodles, walking away and into the back as she waggles her fingers over her shoulder.
It’s silent for a moment after he’s done, and he risks a look up.
His body is too used to the hypervigilance of a warzone. It refuses to shut down and rest, and the precious few hours he does get is wrought with a sense of dread and terror, too nebulous to form a coherent narrative. Just the feeling that everything is wrong and will never be right.
He exhales and nods.
He finds Sherlock with a pillow behind his back and head, creating a cradle for his body, and the duvet pulled up to his shoulders. His eyes open into slits as John approaches the bed.
“Feel free to eat anything you find while I’m gone,” John says.
“I just fell asleep. Why are you yelling.” He sounds wretched, and John immediately feels his stomach drop out from under him in guilt.
“…What?” John breathes out. He looks Sherlock over but doesn’t see any blue and purple bruises, or red scrapes against his skin. Sherlock is as perfect as John knows he is. “You lied to me,” John says. Not a question, but a statement.
Sherlock stops pacing, his breathing still aggravated.
“You’ve met him. How many friends do you imagine he has? I’m the closest thing to a friend Sherlock is capable of having.”
John supports the man's weight against his side, arm wrapped behind his back to keep him steady.
This man Sherlock loves, the man he has died for, the man he has decided to
John doesn’t resist the urge to place a kiss to Sherlock’s hair.
“Hm.”
John’s been kicked out of the flat, so he makes his way to Regent’s Park to wallow in self-pity.
But there would have been nothing preventing Sherlock from just taking his mobile and running. Would he steal anything of John’s and leave? His food, the emergency cash stored in his dresser, his clothes–
He returns to the chair, holding up the ice cube wrapped in cloth. “Here, suck on this. It'll help the swelling go down and numb your lips.”
“I never tire of hearing it, John.”
“Love you.”
How John, a University student and part-time barista, can afford a bedsit such as this without a flatmate is questionable. I don’t know how he does it, either.
There’s a strained silence. John didn’t know what he expected when he got into a strange person’s car, but it certainly wasn’t an awkward social encounter. “What’s your name, then?”
“You-You’re seeing a therapist?”
He digs his thumb into Sherlock’s palm and rubs in tight circles. His other hand holds Sherlock’s steady, pliant under the attentions. He spirals his thumb outward, vaguely remembering something about pressure points.
“Pity, we could’ve split the fee, think it through next time.”
John briefly wakes to Sherlock slowly removing John's arm from around his waist.
That night, John drowns himself in enough alcohol to forget every moment of his meaningless existence.
Now closer, John can see that the man is wearing an impeccable grey suit that makes his significant height over John even more imposing.
Slowly, John lifts himself out of his chair, grumbling that
John stands awkwardly, having just risen from his seat in the waiting hall. He looks ragged, the wrinkles on his face deeper and more defined. The elbows of his cardigan are worn thin. His hands are clenched loosely against his sides.
“If you shut up you can sleep.”
“I know. I just want you back sooner.”
“No, they left after I stopped fighting back.”
It feels odd to be there again after what happened. He feels like he was ripped out of his own life and placed into someone else’s, only to realize they had the wrong person and put him back where they found him.
The deep baritone startles John, expecting the light and sweet voice of his mother on the other line.
“Hm? Wassat?” Sherlock mumbles.
He continues to read his textbook until the sky darkens and the city-sounds from outside diminish. He sets his textbook aside and pulls his arms above his head, stretching his back and groaning in relief.
When he can no longer realistically continue, he rinses his hands and takes up a disposable razor.
“Not really, but I think I will be.”
Subjecting himself to being awake, he says a bit louder, “Come over here and make me.”
The sky darkens further and the clouds grow heavy.
After that first day, John is overcome with loneliness whenever he’s at his empty bedsit. He asks Mike and his other coworkers if he could cover some shifts for them, needing the distraction, but none of them take his offer.
“Are you all right?” the detective asked after giving the cabbie their address.
This stopped Sherlock in his tracks. “John, is that so? You would be upset if I left?” He sounded astounded.
Probably a wise precaution.
Then he was pacing again, and now was issuing a continuous litany of increasingly meaningless and undiscernible words, punctuated by the most disturbing laugh on occasion. He seemed to become completely unaware of our presence. Mycroft and I engaged in our own conversation whilst not looking at one another, but keeping our eyes fixed on him, and speaking over his endless monologue.
His uncertainty irritated him, as had Mycroft’s request that he tell them what had happened to him. He couldn’t. He simply couldn’t.
“So, what brought you to London and your current position?” I demanded in some surprise. “It seems an unlikely change, if you don’t mind my saying so.”
“I do. The doctor here knows that you do. Even your landlady knows. But we also know that you have, so far, failed to master yourself for more than a few moments during any of these fits.”
She nodded and walked out of the room without another word.
“So, it was not that I was boring you.”
“But not now?”
He nodded.
“Shall my maid go with you?” Mr. Harper inquired, concern on his face. Clearly, he noted Sherlock’s distress at my announcement. “Just to ensure that you do arrive safely?”
“John?” he quavered, confused and distressed by my reaction.
In the privacy of our rooms, I am anguish and sorrow. I am devastation and horror. I am empty. I am racked by guilt. Why could I not save him?
wanted
Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises—the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day.
His brother stared at him in disbelief.
Before it was safe.
“Yeah? Thanks, ‘Lock.”
He was aware, too, that he had been away for a long time before that, and that during that time he had not exactly been on holiday. When he bathed (he ignored the parade of nurses who were in constant attendance) he would stare down at his body and attempt…
“It is all right, Watson,” Sherlock managed. “Please, leave us alone for a bit.”
“That is very philosophical of you,” I commented quietly.
“Sir, are you all right?” Sean demanded.
“Fascinating,” he nearly whispered. And there it was—the sting that so often accompanies honey.
“Merry Christmas, Harry.”
“I cannot believe you think it wise for
It was on the train that Sherlock seemed to finally show that he was affected by our hideous encounter; he had given me just the slightest hint when he mentioned the possibility of Miss Stoner suffering repercussions from her discovery by her stepfather, but as we flew along the tracks, it obviously began to disturb him more and more. By the time we reached Leatherhead, he was sinking fast into one of those low moods which worry me so. If it overtook him entirely, he would be utterly useless for the investigation. I dreaded those situations much more than him simply refusing a case at the outset, for I would be forced into the role of detective myself, making all the enquiries and coercing him to at least pretend to be keen on the scent of something.
His patient was restless, and Christopher let him take the lead, following quietly as the silent man limped out into the hallway. He didn’t seem to have any specific goal, walking slowly through the immense house. He was peering keenly around himself, pausing to examine seemingly random objects: the door to another bedroom; the carpet runner on the stairs. They descended to the ground floor, where he paused to run a finger along the locked lid of the piano.
“Yes, all right, I am horribly underdressed,” he snarked at their stares.
“Apparently only when she was quite small. Then she had to stay home to take care of her younger brothers and sisters.”
“No, John.”
His brother was completely bare, water dripping off his fingers. He shook his head in mild distain (and just a touch of amusement) over the familiar image.
I did not sleep well. I awoke several times, always to the sound of Sherlock tossing and turning; getting the bedclothes in a hopeless tangle. Sometimes I could hear him whimpering; he was desperate for sleep, but it would not come. I debated rising and giving him something to help.
“Okay,” Greg replied gently. He could play along. “If you’re that tired, why don’t I run you home while you tell me about the valuations?”
He shook his head. “My mind is all a jumble of cheetahs and pokers and bed-ropes. I am so gratified that our client is safely removed from it all. May I tell you something, John?”
This took me by surprise, and my hand, still clutching the wet sponge, dropped to my side. “Then what is it?” I demanded.
“Once again, surely the doctor here is not the only medical man who has discovered a better application of his skills and knowledge than attending to sick headaches and ‘bad chests’.” Sherlock fiddled with his cigarette, examining its smoking end intently.
Particularly at this time of year. The
dressing
“He can’t eat that,” the housekeeper had told her plainly.
“Uh… yeah.”
I had left him alone only long enough to open the door to his brother’s knock (I had locked it and slipped the key into my pocket), and he was still engaged in the activity that had caused me to send an urgent message to the elder brother.
“Yes. I have no idea if any of it is any good—it just seems sheets and sheets with lines and dots to me—but when he is engaged he seems to forget where he is.”
The mattress was dropped back into place and he felt his arm being pulled. He tried to raise it and found that he couldn’t.
talking
“You’re in your own room in your brother’s house,” she offered gently. “Big Brother wouldn’t let anyone hurt you, would he?”
No no no no no keep away no bad people no hurts go away no touch no injections
I moved toward the stove. There was, indeed, a pot of some sort of white soup on it. I peered closely at it and frowned. “What are those dark bits?” I asked.
Oh, well. It was still an opportunity that he couldn’t pass up. Moving stealthily, he entered a code into a small keypad and then swung open the door that led out to the back garden.
“Yes, a CT scan and x-rays. We don’t believe he currently has any broken bones,” remarked another medical professional, “but it would be good to see if there were any in the past; ensure that everything is healing properly.”
She paused, a thoughtful expression on her face. And then she smiled a bit victoriously. “Felicity Thatcher! She would probably be able to at least bring some meals from their shop,” she offered, “and perhaps she would be able to do a few things in the house.”
“We picked him up eight days ago. We don’t actually know how long he was back in the country before that.”
“He means that Father was still alive and would not allow him.”
“Well, a bit more than ‘a bit,’ I’m afraid,” I admitted. “You are going to have to be off your feet for quite a while until all this heals.”
They were both startled when Sherlock made a sort of derisive sound.
I slit it open and withdrew several sheets of paper, covered in the same tidy handwriting. The correspondence was headed with the usual date, location, and salutation.
“Or what? You going to beat us up? Both of us?” The teens in front of him were both taller than him (not that that was much to brag about). They sneered.
In response, he surprised me by lifting himself to his knees and falling onto my chest. I instantly held him, and felt his sinewy arms wrap around me. He buried his face in my shoulder. “I will tell you, but you must understand that it was strictly an experiment on my part.”
Better than the condition he was in now, that was certain. Clever—and stupid—little brother had managed to find a dealer and, based on the way he looked now, the wallet he had pickpocketed had been well-lined.
“If you already know, why do you ask?” he snarled back.
“Etta, sir,” she introduced herself.
“Is that such a horrible thing?” I inquired drily.
“You know as much as I do. You know that he hasn’t been eating or sleeping; that he is exhausted and sorrowful about nothing in particular. What he needs when he is like this is for someone such as yourself to encourage him to eat a little; to assure him that the mood will eventually pass. Stay by his side if he wishes for company—and for comfort—but do not press him overmuch, especially when he seems particularly distressed. I know that I am asking quite a bit of you, but I would not if I did not think that you were capable.
“I know you are,” I soothed. “And I certainly do not wish for you to go to one of those places—”
And so we found ourselves in a restaurant nearby to the theatre—apparently accustomed to this sort of evening audience. My poor cousin Albert, who is a bit stupid, I must admit, had gone along with everything happily.
The barber had been to the house many times before, and possibly in similar circumstances, so he hadn’t blinked an eye at his task: trimming the hair and shaving the face of a man who was not quite connected to his surroundings. He was moving sluggishly, and his odd eyes wandered aimlessly around the room. The nurse (he was old and old-fashioned enough to shudder internally at thinking of any man as a nurse and any nurse as a man) was hovering, ensuring that the patient (who was wearing rather fruity pyjamas and an almost embarrassingly-lush dressing gown) was comfortable and constantly reassuring him that the man was there just to trim his hair and shave him; Big Brother had called him so it was all right; he would look so handsome and feel so much tidier when it was done.
“Mrs Parker. I’ll show you to your patient.”
I tossed my bag to the floor and threw myself into my chair. “Come sit up here with me,” I instructed.
He watched blearily as the nice lady quickly made up a nest of blankets on the sofa. That was better. Daddy let him sleep on the sofa when he was feeling ill.
, and then they’d want to
attentions Himself requires. Those, I am afraid, will be entirely your responsibility.”
I shifted him in my arms so I could see his face, and I kissed his high, white forehead. “No, my love,” I assured him. “For I felt exactly the same."
I took my cue and, as gently as I was able, took hold of my darling’s hands. “Sherlock,” I said calmly, “leave the packing for a bit and come tell us your plans.” I drew him to myself before turning him and, with my hands on his shoulders, directed him into the sitting room. He struggled a bit, looking longingly at his case over his shoulder, but his brother, following us directly, rather emphatically shut the bedroom door behind us.
He allowed her to lead him into the en-suite bathroom with the obscenely large tub and help him clean his mouth and face.
“And… I don’t know why I did it.” I was mortified to watch as my friend’s head hung in shame.
[The original letter is folded up with this particular manuscript.]
She bent and kissed his forehead. “Go back to sleep, love,” she murmured.
“The cook was always shouting orders. Not in a cruel way—it was just that he was rather deaf. He was actually quite a nice man who enjoyed teaching others cookery. I learned all the basics from him and he even had me do some of the food preparation.”
I have been quite erroneous in my impression, a point that was made rather poignantly clear that evening.
For a while, the clatter of dice and click of the pieces on the polished wood blended comfortably with the music and cracking fire.
Sherlock shrugged. “They’ll figure it out eventually.”
“I am grateful that because of this, I did join my friend today, for meeting you and your husband has allowed me to make a deduction about your
He nodded vigorously, still smiling. “He was extremely helpful in that respect. It was a fairly simple one—rose gold, with a round red garnet surrounded by six small diamonds in a pattern of braided vines. It was of a somewhat unusually large size, as women’s rings go, and although somewhat valuable, my client was more distressed because it had belonged to his mother and had great sentimental value.”
“If you were so worried, you would not have moved out.”
I turned and he grasped at my wrist.
“An orange would be lovely. Anything else? What about some nice tea and toast?” she added. He nodded again.
The hall was gloriously cool. Not being exposed to sunlight, it was blissfully refreshing and dark.
And now they had no idea where he was.
“Excellent, John,” Sherlock murmured. I could tell he was becoming sleepy. Regardless, I basked in his praise. I was feeling calmer than I had since the moment I had opened that wretched letter.
“As has been proven this past fortnight, even if my brother should be stricken as horribly as our poor mother was in her later years, I have the means to manage him here, in our family home. There might be some improvements that would need to be made to ensure his safety, but those could be easily accomplished should they become necessary.”
them—whether or not you understood them. That is what I have been trying to explain. Sherlock, I have said this before. We are healthy men. I have urges. You have urges. It is completely normal.”
“Where is she now?” I asked.
Where
“Then I heard about a position as a lady’s maid, and there I was working for Mrs Simpson. She was so lovely and kind, and I tended to her for three years. Then, sadly, she passed, and her son, who is equally kind, read your advertisement and here I am.”
Looking back, I am mortified to not have realised it earlier and even more chagrined to not have written to you immediately upon my discovery. I am sure you understand that at the very first I was overwhelmed by the entire situation, and then I will admit to allowing myself to become distracted by my marriage, establishing our new household, and the sale of the manor-house.
So why was she suddenly so sleepy?
well-behaved...
I found myself nearly blushing at his blunt words. “I am certain that Mrs. Bloom does not have occasion to avoid such things; she surely is not exposed to them,” I suggested.
She put down the book. Her patient whimpered and hit it with his hand.
“You can barely keep your eyes open! And when you crash, you’re going to want to be somewhere warm and clean and dry, with lots of painkillers—am I right?”
“Oh, yes,” he replied stiffly.
“So?”
The head of dark curls moved back and forth; he was shaking his head “no.”
With their assistance, I got him to the bed and we rolled him in the sheet. I knew that I would have to tend to his injuries, but that would be impossible until he was somewhat calmer.
“My brother hasn’t been
I suppose some of it was simply serendipity—he had not suffered any bouts of mania or melancholia for some months, and between his researches and a few interesting clients, he was as content as he was ever likely to be.
She had him back in bed now. He was being unusually complacent. He had allowed her to help him from the bed and into the bathroom. As was obvious, he was in no shape to do anything other than sit. She winced in sympathy as his leg hit the seat, but he seemed to take no notice.
“Yes, John,” he agreed sweetly, “but for the moment, the door to the corridor is locked, the curtains are drawn, it is quite late at night, and if you would turn down the gas again, I should like to add to my collection of observations regarding arousal.”
“So discuss it,” he said coldly. As he paced, he glanced out the windows several times—and I admit to becoming more alarmed with each look. I could see that his brother was equally apprehensive of his actions—the horror of the night before was still so present in both of our minds—and in the bandages on Sherlock’s hands. He startled me by suddenly hissing, “You have never requested my input before; why should I think that you desire it now?”
It was when I went down to ask Mrs. Hudson for breakfast that I learned of her decidedly unpleasant encounter with our intruder. I was relieved that she had not been injured and apologised profusely, but she waved me away. “I should be more cautious about opening the door—I should certainly know better by now. I’m just glad he’s gone. I’ll have breakfast up in a trice,” she stated firmly.
“No. It is all right, John. It was a long time ago and that man cannot hurt me any longer.”
“Perhaps I will,” I agreed.
Dimly, I could hear Sherlock’s distinct voice as he exclaimed about one thing or another. It became much clearer as he and Mr. Harper emerged from the house, and I did not need to open my eyes to know that the detective was as eagerly throwing himself upon his face amongst the flowers and hedges as he had been amongst the legs of the dining table. He was chattering on about indentations on the lawn and a broken latch on the window and scuff marks on the window-sill.
The quiet man bent his head down as he began to examine each page of the oversized tome. He was quite focused and methodical. He carefully opened the book and smoothed his hands across the pages, and then, using his fingers as a guide, scanned each map.
He turned those two sheets to face inward.
“Sit down,” I instructed, manoeuvring him to the bed. He dropped down and allowed me to remove his boots and stockings. I admit to wrinkling my nose a bit. “Not the worst,” I managed, “but these boots will have to be aired thoroughly.”
So, there he was, trying to impress Dr John Watson—who had as a total bonus been in the army; what did he look like in uniform? —without frightening him away—and then it had occurred to him—he couldn’t. He couldn’t frighten him away. The man was attracted to danger. And it was that—exactly that—that made him so very desirable.
His confidence had not been misplaced; he had known that his brother was the only—
“Oh, this is lovely,” I agreed, taking a sip. Unlike a port, which I certainly do enjoy, this was not heating in any way. With it she had brought a dish of the lightest biscuits—they were really rather exquisite.
“I… did not mean to be so vocal about my… I try not to be...” he attempted to explain himself, and I was taken aback by his admission.
“I am delighted to hear that,” he began. He was speaking slowly; almost languidly. “I am a great admirer of those who perform acts of charity. What in particular do you do?”
How stupid did they think he was? First, they try to strap him to whatever torture device that was—waterboarding? Probably. Then, when he managed to extract himself they…
Of all the feelings that had assailed him since that first glimpse of his little brother on the grainy CCTV image, for some reason his father’s gentle tone was the hardest thing he ever had to bear.
The letter appeared in the usual fashion, with the rest of the post. I sorted through everything and placed Sherlock’s letters on his desk, then seated myself at my own desk and opened mine. I wasn’t expecting anything except the usual bills.
“What is it, Sherlock?” his brother responded. He couldn’t hide his surprise.
Sherlock nodded indulgently, a slight smile on his lips. “Yes. I am not a student of human behaviour as is my dear friend here, but I do find myself intrigued by this conundrum.”
“Are you well?” she asked.
“To do as you and Mrs Hudson wished. To behave myself whilst the new maid was here.”
“It’s not always that easy, Sherlock,” I growled, growing impatient with him. “You evoke quite strong sensations in me—you know that you do.”
And when Little ‘Lock wanted tea with Daddy, it was almost all milk and sugar and just the slightest hint of camomile or some other caffeine-free, herbal mixture because his sweet boy did not need the stimulation…
“I do not have to reiterate our countless conversations about hiding our relationship, do I?” he responded a bit bitterly. “Or how your editors see fit to disguise our household arrangements with false marriages to imaginary brides on your behalf?”
“I believe that I will retire,” Mycroft said softly.
His broken head
“Of course. Your descriptions of me in your published stories have been quite precise. If I had gone there in my usual apparel and spoke naturally, I would have been recognised. It would have appeared quite odd that I was inquiring about you.”
I was relieved when he rallied himself upon catching sight of the old manor-house and encountering our client at the entrance to the foot-path. I believe that he was buoyed by our client’s coming out to meet us. She had proven to us that morning and again when she appeared that she was truly brave and eager to take an active role in understanding her situation. Indeed, as he climbed the stile, he seemed quite his usual energetic self, and he grinned a bit wickedly as he described how we had made the horrible man’s acquaintance.
“A hundred or so,” I admitted, “but I don’t know where to begin.”
She thought about the confidentiality agreement and how now she was even more grateful that she could not tell a soul outside of that house what she was witnessing—as the once-great detective drifted off with a cushion clutched to his chest, his cheeks wet with tears and a knuckle pressed to his wounded lips.
No. Damn. There was some fuss at the perimeter of the scene. He glanced over, scowling. A constable was arguing with someone across the yellow tape. He looked at the DI.
“Yes. I believe that I was rather too hasty when I said that I would send my brother to an asylum.”
He shouted himself hoarse and fought like the devil whilst they wrapped him in a large bedsheet. I am not ashamed to admit here in my private writing that this in particular brought tears to my eyes. For it was not in anger that he shouted and fought so.
“What did he say?” John muttered through gritted teeth.
“So… nothing unusual for my brother,” he murmured. “Sherlock, how are you doing today?” he asked him.
Miami?
Still, he was intelligent and thoughtful and was studying to become a doctor. He had a special interest in diseases of the eyes and in surgery, having grown up with a grandmother blinded by cataracts and so terrified of the idea of an operation that they never could convince her to have it done. He had felt so helpless back then. But now, when his studies were complete, he could help others in her situation. That was his plan.
“His... thigh. It was for but a moment.”
“Your clothing. It’s decent—posh stuff, probably expensive—and it’s clean, but it’s a bit thin for the weather. No coat. You probably got checked in a few months ago and that’s all you had with you.”
(it took Mycroft a second to decipher that to mean
“We will address why this is so distressing presently, but for now, you must accept that yes, Mrs Hudson has had quite a turn, but she will—with care and rest—heal. Our neighbour and then a new servant will assist us with meals and some of the more basic necessities, but we must not expect her to do everything that our friend does for us. You do understand what I mean?”
It was all rather chaotic after that. Henry and one of the attendants rushed in from the dressing room and a footman and the other attendant burst in from the corridor. I was already on my feet and at the window. Without hesitation, I grasped him from behind, pinning his arms to his sides and pulling him bodily away from the broken glass.
I rose swiftly. “Yes, Holmes. I believe we are.”
As Belinda shared more of her story with me, I pictured her as a young girl determinedly scraping and chopping carrots, being careful not to chop a finger instead.
John let him play with the object for a few minutes, during which he discovered that he could make both geometric, symmetric shapes and more abstract ones. He also obviously liked the feel of the smooth wood, as he kept running his fingers over the balls, naming the colours under his breath.
“Do you think he’ll find out?” Sean inquired a short time later.
But not the fact that the hands encased in them were trembling.
“Belinda cannot read.”
Sherlock, who had been poking at the housekeeper’s computer (she had locked out the internet per Mr Holmes’ instructions and knew more than enough about the younger brother to be able to create an almost-unbreakable password for the web, but it was fine if he wanted to use a word-processing or other app), scowled and shook his head, but then, leaning heavily on the counter, he rose and got over to the kitchen table.
was. The clinical terminology wasn’t fooling him. His baby brother had had his head bashed in and it had damaged his brain (screw the scans) and that was why one of the most gregarious men in England was now
She was one of those nurses who says “we”—as in “How are we doing this afternoon?” when it was obvious that she was doing just fine and Sherlock—and anyone else in the house with him—was exhausted, tense, and miserable.
“Doctor Watson! You’re needed!”
“She did not seem to understand the necessity of scrubbing the fenders every day. She left the breakfast remains in the scullery sink, and now the entire room is foul. I told her a
“It’s about time.”
And then there were other pieces—where were they from? Who was the composer?
“What was that?” the older man leaned toward him slightly; his brother had attempted to say something. “Take your time.”
His brother nodded and sighed, dropping the crayon.
“Don’t hurt him!”
“Fear of retaliation,” he stated plainly.
“What have you been trying, my love?” I asked gently.
He shook his head. “They’re not exactly on the grid, Inspector Lieutenant. I have to go look for them.”
This was so irritating, he thought. Why was he here, dressed in one of those ridiculous hospital gowns that left nothing to the imagination? His head was
He barely seemed to notice as I took his pulse and rested my wrist on his forehead. I fetched my stethoscope and listened to his heart and his lungs. “Look at me,” I requested. His eyes were clear. I prodded gently at his neck. “Open up,” I instructed and he did; his throat looked fine.
“What’s this about food?”
“Yes, sir.” She did.
The older brother had already described what he had observed before he had been retrieved—the head injury and then the difficulty balancing and walking; the vomiting. His inability to speak. That his head hurt was more than apparent.
But that wasn’t possible right now, was it? No. Clearly not. His brother needed him.
“Holmes?” I nearly whispered. “Are you all right?” I laid a hand on his shoulder. He slowly turned his head and stared at me. “Can I help?” I added.
In fact, I am rather stupefied that you have remained for so many years.
“I just needed some air. Give me a moment and I will be fully recovered presently.”
The biscuits were just ordinary ones from the shop, but at least they were chocolate. Mrs Hudson made his favourites for him—jammie dodgers and ones that looked like little hedgehogs, even while insisting that she was not his housekeeper.
They set up John’s new backgammon set and enjoyed their second glass each while playing. It was one of the few games they could play together without pieces flying. Sherlock had instrumental versions of classic Christmas songs playing, and John had poked up the fire until it cast dancing shadows across the room. The street was blissfully quiet.
“Why not open your presents, anyway?” Greg suggested softly. “It can’t hurt.”
I do not wish to dwell upon Sherlock’s reaction to my leaving him this morning, even as I assured him it was for half a day at most. He was alternately angry, indifferent, and—and this made my chest ache—heartbroken. I told him over and over that I would be back in just a few hours, but he in his addled state could not seem to accept my promise. That he was even aware of where we were and where I was going was a bit miraculous; last night he thought we were aboard a ship to New York and wondered why we could not smell the sea air in our cabin.
In retrospect I realise that his choice of words was purposely antagonistic; that my anger would be much more conducive to navigating the untenable situation than fear or panic. But at that moment, I reacted instinctively, bristling at his words.
"Apparently,all of the snakes were driven from Ireland by a saint. Was not aware Ireland ever had the climate for many reptiles,but then I looked further and it made sense"
The sudden spark of pain and unsteadyness startled Sherlock enough, he was able to wriggle and run away.
Dada had zipped her up in a jacket and sat her in a car seat before running off again.
John kept a steady grip on his hand steadieing Sherlock's arm. "I don't think I'm done with all of THIS job to go to the hospital just yet. You do need sleep yes, but you need to eat to keep you and that brain," John pointed with his other hand to Sherlock's brow, "fed and cared for. We can get home and start with some calming tea, then I'll get something solid fixed before, yes, you should get a quick shower and then off to bed with you."
He knew from experience to not get too relaxed.
"That would be Katy! She enlisted as soon as she aged out of foster care!" John caught himself and quieted down, looking at the lump on the chair. He soon looked right at Sherlock with a smile and kept stirring the stew before leaving it behind with a lid on it.
"This looks forged and sloppy" Sherlock said, showing a picture of a paper signed with the wife's name,with the name of a museum in the papers heading.
"Steel fists over velvet gloves. That strategy has been discussed in several bits of literature. Without you, I observed and acted. The wife I had knocked out and cuffed,and the husband I had tied with rope and zip ties before I texted Lestrade. This" Sherlock said, looking at all of the officers and investigators around " seems to be lasting too long. If they will not listen to me, I want to get some coffee, rest, and maybe the blankness of sleep. But not here"
After finding mostly solid footing, John got the solar battery lantern out, unfolding and tapping it on before tapping Sherlock on the shoulder with the torch he was lending him.
John looked at the overhead of ropes that connected to a round crank on his side, right next to the building.
With that, Sherlock backed up and waved his hands out of the way, leaving room for John to dart to the shower upstairs.
John curled against Sherlock's chest, burying his face in curls.
"You should know being mature and knowing details like how to work without a car seat has little to do with actual size. The law is the law and we help police, so we would be the first caught if we break it. You do not want me or John to be in trouble do you?" Sherlock said.
"Won't be a problem sirs" the driver said before taking the cash and speeding towards the destination.
Things opened up to show a cave within this cliff side that managed to be all but hidden.
" If she wakes up and starts crying,it will echo down here in this old building, she's past the age where she should be learning to sleep on her own" Sherlock hissed grabbing the shoulder of John's shirt."As I mentioned,you are very much needed here,so come on! I don't even need to measure to know we could sleep in the bed better than the couch".
" Your not having anything but coffee?" John asked.
As more thunder got shockingly close, Sherlock was walking over wearing only a towel, spreading the clothes he was wearing out along and over a metal chair he had unfolded.
"If that is the case, many parents would not approve. But that is a side of being a doctor and WITH you I know not to doubt".
Why John followed the freak around,and even had a blog about the cases (very cencered and kept unclear in parts for safety) she would never know.
"Lestrade will meet us at the station, although how Mycroft knows to take us there I don't care to know. He has done more than enough meddling for me,you would think keeping an eye on the inns and outs of Britain would be enough! " Sherlock turned and looked back at John,still taking the steps down. " If we were up to more than just swimming,that was not for him to stick his nose into! It's almost tempting just to make him jealous, but it's really not for him to know".
pebbles into glass
The leader that Sherlock was able to chase after and tackle down while John was fighting, cuffing, and disarming several of the followers had fought back. The leader had pulled a knife on Sherlock.
Irene was leaning down,and almost seemed snake like with the way she seemed,and the small shake of the yacht, and the way it was all oddly, suddenly connected...
" It's an oil that doesn't burn or react on skin. It feels nice and helps with any dryness"
The pilot,soon after landing,followed where the phone signal seemed to come from.
He was in a familiar area right now, but felt if he learned to rely more on other senses, more cases would be solved quicker.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and parallel parked. All this over jewelry! Sentiment with some people! He unbuckled and leaned over as John undid his seat belt.
Which Sherlock as usual went right back to shattering to bits,but like an onion peeling,there were tears, frustration, and now John knew he would never need to date again.
" This way Mr. Holmes and" he looked at John " his friend"
Well, since there have been several chapters written alongside TOS, let's throw the boys in a well understood and structured world full of fun oddballs where our cute weirdos would NOT fit in...but they can learn....and it's for a case!
The men were all talking back and forth before looking at Sherlock.
"That's what I was saying earlier! It wasn't even a good case,but I got out of the apartment,away from this snow,but not away from whatever this is..." Sherlock mentioned scratching at his ankles.
"You get in the way of an international conference for more than childish bickering. And of course your timing is too perfect. What must this be about?" Mycroft followed close by, unlocking his office and having both men step inside before closing the door.
He didn't turn it on, because he could hear the shower going. Instead of freezing the man he lived with,he went towards the bathroom to try and help him. (With washing,drying, unwinding, calming down. He had long learned how to multitask in a way many he worked for would care to know nothing about,and has helped him stay in good shape)
They watched the parade go by,then got dressed when Sherlock recieved a text.
"That sounds horrific! How did you escape? How were they taken care of?" John said, shocked.
Let me know how badly I messed this up!
The elevator dinged as they got to the right floor. It was quite, but still well lit as cleaners gathered thier equipment and left.
"So I'm not allowed a break?! I'm not looking to get married again, but I do need some break from my work,cases, changing diapers, and being stuck in these same walls tonight!" John then sighed,took a large drink from his glass and crouched in his seat leaning into his crooked arms, staring at the floor, trying not to cry.
"I want to see that you can handle yourself better before you RUN OFF AFTER ANOTHER CRIMINAL before the rest of us can catch up and see that your not DEAD..".
"Hmmm this makes no sense"...a familiar voice came from the other side of the blast area.
"That is why we are still here! To hell with it,I came as a redshirt" a man,who was in a red costume walked up and said and everyone cheered.
He closed the door and set the milk on the counter, with one hand still holding a smiling Sherlock. He got two cups down, and two bowls with two light, plastic plates before walking over to the pantry and getting the oatmeal still, with one free hand.
No seeing what's beyond them
"You are not missing anything!" John hissed " we don't have to worry about any more kids by ourselves, and you don't have to do anything for me if it won't do anything for you. I'm not that kind of ass"
"The couple you set the meeting for changed thier minds on thier agenda. Wanted me in thier operation. I am not talking about the international tea house that's privately owned,but has locations in 2 other countries" Sherlock told John.
The wrestlers used thier winnings to support abused spouses in different countries, with the country's own local based programs and hotlines. Various groups formed up to fight for charity matches of different kinds. Underground smuggling was given more policing and checks.
"But we just finished a case! What else do you have to work out in that head of yours? Whatever it is will soon include a cinnamon roll or" John took a step to flip through the pamphlet." They have that frosted cereal you've eaten dry,so there,you can eat while you pace" he said, before grabbing and stepping into his own slacks.
The sun was over the horizon,but they still had plenty of time before they had to leave the hotel room.
Dimmock gave them a ride to where this convention was to be held at,and even though it wasn't opened up just yet,there were already trekkies fully dressed and conversing. Several had thier own tents set up and everything.
All part of factoring in more of each equation.
John woke up rattled as he had a harsh, sudden re-adjustment to consciousness.
Sherlock pointed out the small path, was this a path to a child's remote control car? Before John carefully stepped out, careful to keep balanced with the bags on his back.
Still, Sherlock had wished him luck, which was odd, because he never showed interest in any of John's dates. Something was suspicious,but John had no plans on being interrupted on this date!
It was 11. Seemed to take hours to get there,but it was soon 11. He had showered, changed clothes, and combed his hair but looking out the sun and clouds stayed in a form of stasis. John could be heard walking to and unlocking the front door before jogging up the indoor steps and opening the apartment door.
Sherlock sighed and leaned back against the seat,head
John could not last. Everything was perfect in the way that such times are often fleeting. He looked up to see barely open, blissful eyes staring down at him with black curls in a haphazard mess around his face.
John tensed as someone in a well tailored business suit with a black uniformed guard on each side stepped out. Sherlock looked down, so John followed along, then remembered to shake off Sherlock's handhold.
Let's see if this works
" I do now, I didn't say they belonged to me but your concern with public appearances..."
Anderson jerked up, waving his hand where any colored mist suddenly vanished.
It was almost out of body for both. Sherlock could feel John's pulse, and acted accordingly to what would join them in pace,breath...all for the higher cause of both being completely content,as long as this moment can be made to last without rushing to be over.
Ok,this was done in a rush in between doing errands and favors for everyone else who needed to get things done yesterday, when it's cold and ice now. This will get re edited when I dare find time. Sorry if this is a mess compared to my other works,but I'll see what I can do when I can.
John finished, put his cup in the sink, then walked to the unused chair.
He had been lost in his mind palace again, which he felt he should be ashamed of and have better control over.
Got behind once,and had to rush chapters to catch up. I know I'll be busy tomorrow,so instead of falling behind again,(to rush tales I'll have to find bits of time to edit and re-edit until it's well enough to leave it) I might do a chapter ahead tonight!
Sherlock was thinking back for a moment,then grinned looking down at 221G below him.
It wasn't long before John simply stopped, took off his bags, and started digging through one keeping his back against the rock.
Well, I got the prompt, I drew from a story I wrote a long time ago and lost.(didn't think it would be of interest on AO3, and was unsure about posting it) and yes,what I described is army based and for sale online.
Hands held onto John's rear and Sherlock seemed to have dove in,eyes closed and everything. John started with his hands on the back of the chair, keeping him distanced from Sherlock,but soon his cursing stopped and he slowly relaxed into Sherlock's grip.
"I slept,then I woke up,now I'm waiting on coffee" Sherlock said with a bit of frustration.
John had not dated anyone who could do what Sherlock seemed to do easily. He gave a low moan and came hard down Sherlock's throat. Any attempts at nudging him a break were swatted away.
The open area revealed was not only dryer, but even branched off to rooms with carpet and computers that were safely not even on.
John paid the cabbie, then turned and carefully rushed up the icey steps home.
Sherlock held up his practice piece and swung down at John.
John had made it this far, following the messy, cryptic map that had been delivered to him at his work office.
John was was often turned down when he did, but often made a fuss and pout in the process. He knew how stubborn John could be, often to a foolish extent. He was not usually this content, almost giddy about going bar hopping with Lestrade and the MET.
"What brings you here at such a time brother mine?" Mycroft said after he stepped off the nearest lift.
He dug to the back of his closet, and got the practice swords out of his bag before running back downstairs.
Sherlock had Irregulars he had known for many years, and knew which ones he could deeply depend on.
Soon they were home, and Sherlock started stripping further before he was all the way inside.
"This is for you, I don't want you to get useless and mindless after a few drinks, because I do like to see you keep a level head when you can" Sherlock said, setting the plate on the counter in front of John.
No one developed an instinct for when to trust people,when to hide from them,or when and how to fight them locked in a house most days. He felt picking up on such starting early in life would have helped him so much when he started things,such as college's and being within Mycroft's reach to be used in his politics early as well. He knew she would be walked over and dropped off right before the time John should be home from work.
John gave Sherlock a steady, unflinching stare into his eyes.
------------
"I really don't have time for this, can those two be escorted out? Get a ride for them to Baker Street and I will be there soon after this international meeting is taken care of," Mycroft looked towards Sherlock, "I don't like missing details any more than you do. I'll be by there as soon as I can to dig you out of wherever you got yourself into. Goodbye and don't scamper anywhere but home."
Well,to keep things along,this is the 2nd chapter I'll write today, because my schedule is packed, and I doubt I'm alone
John dove under the bound arms and grabbed the top waist around what was left of the cut trousers. Sherlock stilled,shocked and stunned that it felt like John was chewing through one of the crotch seams. When that hold was released,John was able to grab both sides and give a final rip before pulling the ripped bottoms away from Sherlock.
The weather had left everything down for days. Rules could bend here, and they were not expecting guests. No one would expect them for some time,so for now,John thought,he should just  keep making sure to keep up simple things like making coffee, making sure Sherlock eats, and getting Sherlock to break down and explain his theories,one step at a time.
He just smiled and shook his head, digging through the bag of what was apparently,folded clothes once.
John's face turned serious, but bad habits and all, it was very fitting. At least they were staying in a place better built than the wet cave.
With the noises coming from John, Sherlock was quick to get his mouth over his cock again. Between the renewed warmth, the toungueplay, and Sherlock breathing nasally through any gag reflex that tried to start,John did not last long.
Memories then,stuck in past memories. The room was still dark, and the blanket was...he looked over and down.
"As I stated earlier,we are safe here for the next few days. There was a mention that our client was found innocent of a robbery that at first,a competition company said he had set up himself. Fits my theory, and likely factored into creating it to begin with"
"That's a quick summary of what was found, from the results gathered from testing results on a Jordan Sheen, and what could be found even easily on public record" Lestrade said, flipping through,then handing John a folder of case notes. "I've got to go to a courthouse about findings for another case tonight,along with a never-ending line of paperwork to finish by tonight. I was going to send Anderson to help with this,since his daughter is also into these convention type things,but he showed a level of disrespect that will keep him off of the field for a time".
" Yes I would,you know how I like my coffee" Sherlock said,"we're getting close to something good!" He smiled, looking at a sleepy, yawning John,and started to look and wave towards the kitchen."I've used that heavy metal pot down under the sink to heat water over a fire at times,the glass one on the coffee maker has too many thin areas to be trusted"
He wanted to be alone with his thoughts, but he couldn't make sense of them. He thought of Sherlock, and knew that's one place where it never made sense. Even early on, he was not far from his mind. The way he could deduct, the things he stuck to,no matter what anyone else thought. Well,the way he cared for a few people without caring what anyone else thought of him. The way John had to learn how to read Sherlock, and knew he still could not usually find much. The way he always seemed fluid, in his thoughts,in his movements...
The hotel lady parked the cart next to the bed and left with a smile.
Sherlock followed, quickly climbing down. The rock was slick in the rain, but his hands kept grip. The gloves John had laid out for him on the bed (the fingers were cut off. All John had were gloves of his, and it was obvious Sherlock's hands would not fit in them) helped, but Sherlock always had been a good climber.
"Not after a case like what we solved. You solved really, I just called for help." John said,then looked to the ears and back to Sherlock.
"Yes I do, about 2 scoops of milk along with it,but what is that special posted by the door?" John asked, pointing.
"Really no need to......*purr*...." John said. He was already amazed and content to come back to such later before he lost the voice to speak.
Sherlock got the box of sugars down, and put two on top of his tea before getting a spoon and stirring it. Still with one free hand.
The skull didn't see much,but heard John cursing as ripping could be heard.
John said nothing, but slipped something through the rocks and a clank was soon heard. A spool of rope was taken out, and apparently one end was attached to whatever John put in the rocks.
One that was too dedicated,or as he put it, married to his work to ever think well if his flatmate massaged his back,ran his hands along his hips...
This is another super late chapter again,but we all know how life loves to interfer with any endeavors that may have relaxing side effects (even if it is many edits later, I'll start another edit after brunch before I map out and type the next chapter)
"That,after seeing how some patients are,and thier parents....I can only agree with you" John looked at Sherlock with a smile and took another sip.
"Solved the case you two were somehow allowed on, now we will be out of your hair, until you need something else figured out for you" Sherlock said bowing, before both him and John turned and walked away.
He managed to drop her to the floor and had his foot pressed rather firmly on her shoulder before Mycroft was able to dash across the room to intervene.
“Are you not Christians?”
“Hello, Mary?”
) stirred slightly as he shook his head, frowning at first his own plate, then his brother’s. The plate wasn’t even half full, holding just a small serving of chips doused in malt vinegar and one piece of battered and fried fish.
“You won’t need them. I am quite calm, as you observe.”
Solomon chuckled in amusement. Sherlock, wearing a blanket like a gigantic shawl, was seated cross-legged on the bed of his own room, avidly enjoying a book. “Got distracted?” he asked. “Happens to me all the time when I’m supposed to be organizing my magazines.”
“Oh, I know. I just hate it when he’s all doped up.”
“Turn here,” Mycroft requested. His driver nodded and pulled onto a quiet street.
“Father would often do that—grip my arm so hard that I would bear the marks for days. Sometimes it was my shoulder. If we had visitors, he would parade me in front of them, boasting about what an excellent scholar I was, and all the while he would be digging his fingers into my neck to ensure that I behaved.
“Well, I’ve considered the average time it takes to walk from the closest Tube station, how closely the intervals coincide with typical meeting times—you tell someone 'I’ll see you at seven’ or ‘eight-fifteen’, never ‘twenty-one minutes past two’—even how often that dreadful music loop repeats.”
My dear friend turned and glared at his brother, and the look was the most terrible thing I have ever seen. I am trembling, even now. I, who have run into enemy gunfire, am trembling. Why does this affect me so? Why does the possible fate of this man—my dear friend—make me so unsteady; so unsure?
“Oh! Is that all? Do not concern yourself. There is no reason for you to know anything at all about it. It happened before you and Mr. Holmes lived here. It is in my past.”
His brother had been so sweetly complacent about the bath; grateful in such a touching way, but the medical team had assembled and was now ready for them. He had helped him out of the water and wrapped him in an immense bath sheet before stepping into his bedroom to retrieve some clothing.
He had absolutely no qualms about drugging the nurse. As soon as she was out (it was fairly obvious because she snored), he set his plan into action. There was no time to lose. Malcolm would be back from the cinema soon, and when he opened the gate to drive in, he would have his opportunity.
“Do what? Say it.”
unexpected, but in retrospect, I should have deduced it. I could hear Sherlock berating both of us for not attending to the details—noticing that Belinda had become upset only upon Mrs Hudson offering her the book. Casting our memories back to consider if we had ever witnessed her reading anything. Well, he was not there, and Mrs Hudson and I were, and we were equally taken aback by this discovery.
Oh, yes, I do know—I can hear him now, pointing out that I am hardly dull or ordinary. How many English doctors have multiple bullet wounds and impressive scars? How many carry a revolver? How many are perfectly willing to bend and break the law in the pursuit of the truth? How many men not only do not flinch at that thought of tests for human blood but express their admiration and awe?
Stop that, you prick. You’re dead.
“Excellent, Sherlock!” Mrs Parker praised. “You’ve done really well.”
I do hope that I remain,
Or that it was Sherlock.
“It is. Sherlock, what on earth are you looking for?”
Mycroft fought it. He did. He fought the trembling of his lips and the moisture in his eyes.
he demanded. Well, he tried to demand. He was baffled; the words simply wouldn’t come. He took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and tried again. Nothing. This was madness! Sherlock Holmes, unable to ask the simplest question?
“Mycroft, move aside,” Sherlock ordered petulantly.
He shrugged, the picture of nonchalance.
care about others seeing him completely naked like that. Not the naked part—he certainly had nothing to be ashamed about in the usual sense. It was what they might say about the cuts. It wasn’t that he was particularly ashamed of that, either. It was more the bother of it all. They would see them, and
What the hell was wrong with him? He knew what he wanted to say. It was fairly straightforward. He wanted to go home, and he knew the route that the driver needed to take.
The bell rang. I rose and peered down. I frowned. The woman who stood there was familiar to me, but I could not immediately place her. I heard the quick steps of Mrs. Hudson as she crossed the hall and cautiously opened the door.
Sherlock was so startled that he nearly dropped his fork. “Did I hear that correctly, John?” he managed. “Did my brother just say that he changed his mind about something?”
He definitely could say that his shift had not been boring.
Why had he needed a disguise? He had been looking for something. No, that wasn’t right. Not something. Someone. A person. A person of great importance to him…
“That is correct,” she agreed.
“You’re the poufter,” Derek accused, catching up with the conversation. He hated it when Watson did that—it sounded so weird—those big words coming out of that mouth but no posh accent—John Watson was no public-school boy.
She nodded, biting her lip.
So, that was how he was so easily able to quote chapter and verse so aptly applicable to the situation. I should have realised that he would have prepared himself. This also explained the thicker-than-usual smoke in our drawing room that morning. Then something occurred to me. “You do know that quoting from the Bible could have led to either of the Blooms quoting right back at us. I doubt the outcome of our conversation would have been quite so... gratifying if they had brought up—”
It started out reasonably well. In fact, the past few days have been tolerable. Sherlock, apparently keen to earn access to his violin, has been making a more than admirable effort to calm himself. He sets himself small goals—to finish reading a chapter; to complete a letter to Mrs. Hudson—and I cannot praise him highly enough each time he succeeds. When he does not, I rather pointedly do not pass comment.
“He’ll need a new bank account. Identification… oh, you know.”
We were out in the corridor; I had wanted to give Sherlock some privacy for a bath. It seemed unlikely that he would get himself into any mischief bathing himself—but we kept the door open and ears pricked for sounds of distress.
The scalpel his brother had hidden under the inner lining of his shoe was now in his pocket.
The last time he had been at Bart’s—don’t think about it.
John flipped open his book and sighed. It was quite excellent—an adventure/spy/war novel that had been, until a few days earlier, capturing his imagination. He wasn’t sure why now he was having trouble settling down to read it.
It left him tied to an uncomfortable, narrow bed in a filthy room occupied by three loud, drunk students, not quite completely covered by a hideous, rough, cheap duvet that smelled strongly of the last time he and Victor had been together—a pungent mixture of body odour, cigarettes, and semen.
“Luckily for you, he is currently downstairs in the kitchen having tea with the gardener.”
And then he said something that astonished me.
“Well... does it?” I stammered.
I do understand that. She is a very wise woman.
“David,” Mycroft replied in disgust, “you know better.”
thought out!” he exclaimed, sounding like nothing more than a fussy child.
He looked up from his book, surprised to find himself alone. He cocked his head and listened. Ah. Low voices in the hallway. That was all right, he supposed. He was a bit fuzzy on where he was, but it seemed comfortable, at least. A hotel? No. One of those old-fashioned inns that… someone. He had gone to inns like that with someone, and that someone had liked the “ambiance” whatever that was but the rooms were always drafty and he it was a he well of course it was a he girlfriends were not his area he didn’t like to be cold and blankets extra blankets orange blanket soft blanket special blanket special times special person very special person who was he he tried to remember he wanted to remember it hurt his head but he had to remember or it would kill him
“Clearly,” he huffed. He almost ripped the mucky garment off.
He was a motionless, vague lump on the bed, still dressed in the dark shirt and trousers he had so cleverly chosen.
“Correct. In the flood of information my questions drew from the neighbours, there was not a single reference to a child, or children, so I finally inquired directly, and my observation was confirmed.”
Later.
I had begun with the china. I had made notes—copying the marks on the back of the plates and whatnot. They mean little to me—I knew they identify the maker, sometimes by name and sometimes by just a letter or symbol, and sometimes the name of the pattern. Beyond that, I have no idea. What I had noted was the size of the plates—from very large to very small, and shallow bowls. And what I recalled then was the actual pattern. It was floral. Very floral. Rather ostentatiously and fussily floral. Most certainly not to my taste.
“Pertaining to what?”
“You mean an asylum?” he spit out bitterly. “Are you unwilling to even say the word?”
“I know she cannot
Nothing was making him happy—or, more accurately—everything was making him unhappy. He fussed about the tea Mrs Hudson had brought up—bread and butter and lovely, hot tea. I was a bit taken aback. I was accustomed, even in those early days, to his eschewing good, nourishing food in preference for sweets, but this was different.
“Yes.” He sounded distinctly sulky. “But only when I have pushed you far more than any more ordinary man.”
“He’s showing signs of concussion, of course, but nothing to indicate serious brain swelling or bleeding,” the neurologist noted.
The man liked singing. He had a nice voice. Maybe he went to church because he liked singing there.
“I’m fine,” she responded, glancing around the room. The bedclothes were strewn on the floor, the bedside table was on its side, and the lamp it had held was on the floor across the room.
Yes, I had confused him. “Do you mean more difficult or more rigid?” he asked plainly.
So now we each had tea and cake. Sherlock was enjoying his, but I could not bring a morsel to my lips, let alone swallow anything. The time had come.
She did know. Sherlock was not the first person they had “resurrected.” He was, however, the first who was returning with his actual identity—that would make things interesting.
“Yes, I do, Holmes. Please take as long as you need to complete your enquiries here. I shall make my way home and hear all about your discoveries later.”
“She went into service when she was ten years old,” our landlady related a few days later as I examined her slowly-healing foot. “Can you imagine?”
“I suppose it’s as good a time as any,” he continued. “Call everyone in and come sit down. We have to discuss my brother’s reappearance.”
“So I aware, more than you, of the progression of her illness.” And then the stern, stiff façade broke. “Sherlock,” he begged, “she was so different before you were born. She had moments of… unsteadiness… but far more times of calmness. Of happiness.”
I absorbed this information quietly, while rather absent-mindedly rubbing his back. Finally, I was able to speak. “You are certain?” He nodded against my shoulder. “Then you are probably correct, my love,” I admitted slowly.
“Possibly...” He mulled over this for a moment. “But you cannot possibly believe that I would allow you to go on your own.”
“No? Not even if I give you something to help with your sore head?”
I nearly wept when I awoke, alone, in the bed of my hotel room.
"No seat!" Rosie yelled.
He never let anything take control of him again, outside of what he could step away from.(nicotine patches were not near as good as smoking, but he currently had a full, undamaged sense of smell. Drugs still helped him focus... before he found other means to direct his focus that did not leave him needing something that could be watered down or tampered with).
The pilot then spoke into the intercom to be heard over the wind and machinery.
" I'm not a helpless child John" Sherlock said with a dejected look.
"Why did you not feel like telling me? Was she an old fling with your residential sentiment?" Sherlock asked,with the masked expression and final smirk.
Mycroft slowly grinned."Your welcome for the room found for you. It seems to have suited you and " he peered at a sleeping John past Sherlock's shoulder "Mr. Watson quite well." He gazed at Sherlock up and down. "I'm sure any staining is being taken care of that might stick out on your clothes, unless you are in one of your sheet moods again. Mr. Watson might like those as well after the palace"
Sherlock looked at the card as the elevator doors opened at thier floor. Room 515.
It had been long past that,and earplugs worked most of the time for John.
"Are we meeting up with a helicopter anytime soon Sherlock?" John said with a curious smile, sighing and shrugging and saying. "If we are just going to call a helicopter to the airport, or just have it get us at the park for all I know, we are going to need to pack. Lundy is not exactly London you know. And we know bad weather is coming there. You do know what all we are looking for?"
Sherlock was trying to defend himself, keep the leader from getting away, and was thinking over what he had noticed.
He placed his left fist over his own heart and started circling his fist counter clockwise as his eyes dampened up.
"Ok,we have a bit of time, I'll help you into what you should be wearing, and I can check the progress of a few areas while I'm at it" John said as he moved Sherlock into his room.
Yup, the title is true. Had several ideas to go with this,but now that I have time, I'll just see where this goes and hope for not messing it all up entirely
Sherlock let out a breath he did not know he was holding. His arms circled around John, and he started rubbing his back and shoulders. The tension slowly left John, and he was quietly snoring.
"I am fine!" He jumped,then stumbled over to see Sherlock. His coat was burnt off,his button up was reduced to sleeve rings around both wrists, and his pants were mostly reduced to shorts. Sherlock however,seemed unharmed.
Things should keep warm longer, without getting into a large flaming fire.(looks better to others,but goes out quicker as well as makes more fire wasting ash)
By the next day, John relaxed and watched TV. He had already made himself breakfast, even did the dishes from such.
Well,no use in both of them being upset.
John smiled. They must be a pair of Sherlock's and this is now full circle from just using his red pants without asking.
"No to what Sherlock? After tearing up a pair of my jeans? After what happened in your chair and on the rug there,it will take more than case talk and cups of tea to keep this down for long."John said pointing to his crotch" I would like a few answers,I would like to see this shifting you talk about, and if that's what it takes for another round, I used to be known for going more than one round with the ladies"
They kept going before finding one last room that seemed to be full of scrap parts and partial repairs.
He had worked his double shift days,then came home right when he could. By now he was owed a good amount of time off he very much planned on taking advantage of iced in as he was.
John stared back,eyes wide and tearing themselves.
A lighter was pulled out and he lit the candles,then grabbed John's hands as they lowered everything back into place.
John walked in and saw Sherlock in a professional suit, waving at John.
"I feel too much on the floor and walls. This keeps the worst away. Please, for the storm, then we can go on as if this never happened."
" We'll have two of your coffee's and he'll have a small order of your curry chicken" Sherlock told a lady working at the bar that approached them,and nodded towards John.
John was tempted by the term and insinuation made while the driver directed them,but it wasn't worth it right this minute. John kept his silence and followed Sherlock in the car.
Well, things went longer than I planned on,but I'm sure many writers know when you set the boys lose,they can do anything!
He sat back down and Sherlock had set his tea down and had his feet up,curled in his chair again.
Soon, John's hands were swatted away when he tried to lower his slacks. With a very renewed energy, Sherlock simply ripped them off like they were made of paper,where John was soon naked from the waist down except for socks.
Yup,goofy concept idea to play with, weird research I might have to do, let's let our boys loose and see how this killer turns out...
By now,the cups of coffee were following the law of diminishing returns and Sherlock was coming into a tired,but steadier focus.
Time to see things from Sherlock's POV
"Good morning" he said,"would you like me to fix us some coffee?"
John smiled. Sherlock will be busy soon enough with cases and several things as well,might as well not make too much noise. He set out a few different kinds of painkillers, anti-inflammatory, whatever might help him when he wakes up, on the kitchen counter.
You've had me forever owned
Both residents made it back to 221B Baker Street. They got out of the costumes, and took long showers to get rid of any sweat,make up, basically scrub the case off.
"What kind of woman?" John asked, checking the inside of a work bag he had just hung up, and hanging his hat on top of his coat on the hook.
"Will it be another night at Molly's?" A high pitched voice said from the branches above.
After some time,they were all on the ground floor right outside of the building.
"What is he doing to Carl?"
Well,in all the years of tutoring and babysitting kids, I know often the kids problems start with the parents. I also grew up having several medical folk in the family,so I hope when I characterize John, I don't make him out to be like someone from the E.R drama.
There were plenty of books and reading for both, but Sherlock might be sleeping through a lot of the nausea until at least a few days had passed.
"Weather's getting bad, let's hurry! I've hooked all of this through carabineers I've put on my belt, would you like one to stay attached as you follow behind me? The wind sounds fierce," John turned his head to point and explain to Sherlock.
"I use this bottle at times during one of my disquises. I've cleaned and filled it with different things at different times, but seeing what day is getting closer,this is filled with Guinness." Sherlock said, pushing one of the wine glasses towards John's plate before taking the other one.
After seeing our boys servive whatever hell thier put through (though,like it shows on the BBC showing,not easily and blindly taken without question at all,which is hellish,but like many relationships,both sides end up with a closer understanding and bond once the smoke clears)
A couple of tents with groups of men in costumes talking around them seemed pretty normal. Aside from they went out of thier way to not have much to do with the circle of women, and had mixes reactions to John talking to them.
"Is that her snoring upstairs?" John listened right when things quieted.
"We do have what we need, and there ARE tourists here at times. Can you give me what I need and I'll put it on myself? We ARE on a cliff and I don't want to upset you," Sherlock said, and John dug out the adjustable belt and carabineer and put it on.
The daughter was found,and taken from her parents custody. She was put under years of relearning and therapy,then adopted into a loving and accepting family. After following hints and calculations made by Sherlock, an international sex ring was broken up,and many helping to run the ring were put behind bars. Many women, children,and quite a few men were given recovery and resources to start new lives.
John thanked them as they went inside and took seats.
"What do you mean?"
Sherlock could hear pounding on the steps and John coming through the front door.
It was soon not hard to play with John's prostate from the outside.
"I have guards set up at different points all around this hotel. Didn't think you would actually come down to a pool after what Moriarty did, much less with the one he strapped a bomb to, but you like much like staying unpredictable brother mine" Mycroft said, from beside the elevator.
He walked the stool with him,got his gun, and walked everything back towards the painted smiling face on the wall.
"I would like to know when the repair people will get here,so at least we can get enough power to do more than flush toilets." He turned, looking at Sherlock."Would you like some coffee?I can get it set up to brew over the fire....and we do have plenty of eggs to work through"...
Out in the public
It was surprisingly delicious! But he was still eating slow and wary.
The stairs seemed to go on for a while, then a door was found against a cave wall, while stairs continued going up. Legs got tired, but another crack and rumble gave both a quick jolt of fight/flight and energy, and Sherlock opened, then ran through the door.
"Well dear brother this is a nice interruption, but why are you finally coming to me, now of all times, for help? What do you think I could do for you that others will not?" Mycroft said.
Looking down he saw feet facing the other direction and forward,also knocking the insides of the knees belonging to the coat.
It was like he had amplifiers on his ears, and Kate standing stone still nearby,seemed oddly reminescent of a rodent.
He looked around and saw a woman with short,dark hair and a green dress waving at him.
John had an idea. He didn't want to give Sherlock any bruising, and the idea of wrestling...'not now' he thought to his hard on starting to rise at the flashing thoughts of holding down and brushing against different parts of a moving Sherlock. Always at the worst times it seemed.
Afterwards,he stepped out and dried his hair. Fortunately,there was a decent,but small bottle of baby wash to use. It worked for hair and skin without the tacky,cheap soap smell and feel.
"Your brother was very helpful in that" Greg said with a smile before turning to leave. "You can change in the bathroom, and there is an accountant and a secretary that offered to help if you have any costume issues and need small adjustments. The convention starts in the next two hours,but if you get there early and blend in with the other fans,you may be able to get an eye for Jessica or anything else troublesome that may occur. Several photographs are in the folder I gave you John, and maybe you could help this turn out smooth. The tickets are in the bag as well, you'll need them" he said before he quickly left out of hearing range for John and Sherlock.
"So, someone beyond wealthy robbing themselves?" John asked, confused.
"Why? If there's nothing going on there, it will be a waste of time! Not to mention NOT OUR JURISDICTION!" Lestrade said, but looked at Sherlock with wider eyes.
He then took two wine glasses down from a shelf and filled them with a dark drink that had a familiar smell, though the bottle was bagged.
Several of the met had spread out to try and catch,or herd the latest Sherlock had figured out.
"I can fix at least one mistake that you made that upset you" Sherlock said, holding the bowl of hot cereal mixture up with the spoon handle sticking out of the side.
blue irises. He knew, despite the pleasat color, John was focusing hard on something by his head.
221B was nearly spotless. John had resorted to stress cleaning some nights to calm down when the ear plugs would not work with the violin massacre happening by the window. For some time, conversations were approached tentatively, and that could too easily be turned into another argument by a increasingly moody Sherlock.
"The couch is too small for both of us, and no need to wake Watson up just yet,so come on John" Sherlock said, getting up and walking to his room.
"Hmm" John mumbled,"I guess I'll take the dish half regular and half with cinnamon?"
Early the next morning, both residents showed back up without Rosie. John talked about having today off, and cooked both of them a hearty breakfast. Sherlock seemed unsteady,but ate much more than he usually did,which John encouraged,but kept watch and patted his back when he swallowed too quickly.
"They were never taught respect to begin with!"
"I'm tired of this! Just record from other statements I've said on other phones! Go after the real problems! There's a girl in an abandoned cleaning closet in the hotel those two have a room at!"Sherlock yelled at Anderson who was holding his phone to record.
He hesitated a second, glancing towards the door with a frown. “Mmm…? he managed. From the notes she knew that he was able to form words sometimes, but it was still a struggle. From his tone she could tell that he was attempting to ask a question.
He made a sort of whimpering sound and allowed his head to tip forward, pressing against my stomach as I stood in front of him.
While she was cooking, she allowed him and the nurse to use her computer, Christopher assuring her that she would not allow him to get into anything upsetting or dangerous online before she entered her password.
I would not swear to it, but I do believe her eyes rather filled up as she waved to us with her handkerchief from the door to 221.
if it’s easier for you,” he hissed. “My brother has endured two years of physical and mental abuse. He does not need to be made to feel any more vulnerable than he already does.”
“Clearly I can.”
Sherlock looked slowly from one face to another again. He was clearly trying to follow the conversation but didn’t seem to be having much success.
Humming in satisfaction, he found a brown crayon and soon one of the bodies of water was graced with a distinct image of a sailing ship. “Here,” said Mycroft, bending to hand him the black crayon. His brother grunted—was that meant to be a thank you? —and carefully added what could only be a classic Jolly Roger flag.
The skin covering the top of her foot, up as far as her ankle, had apparently been scalded—in addition to the redness, vesicles had already formed, and there was noticeable oedema as well.
bratwurst
“No, that is not necessary,” she protested.
The fact is that it was not the snake which killed my sister. Not exactly.
I opened the door slightly. The gas was up, and despite his claims of a draught, the room was noticeably warmer than his. As I entered, I laughed aloud with delight at the sight that greeted me.
I laughed. “They are quite comfortable and more practical—they don’t ruck up and leave your legs cold.”
And then I gently—as gently as I was able--began to prod the top of the burned, rapidly bruising and swelling foot. Our intrepid friend bit her lip and looked away, but she did not cry out or even wince. “It is a bit difficult to say for certain with the swelling, but I do not believe that any bones are broken,” I reported, and I am not certain which of us was more relieved.
Sherlock’s knees buckled and I was grateful that I was standing so close; I caught him and guided him to the bed, seating him and, not even thinking about it, crouched in front of him. I grasped his hands in mine and pulled them onto his lap.
It was in fear.
“I know,” I managed to respond. The words hurt me as much as the bullets that had struck me during my service.
“Sherlock!” I interrupted. “Breathe.”
And he had said something. One word.
himself.”
I am not certain if I should consider myself “fortunate” in that that evening actually unfolded exactly as I desired. After the concert reached its conclusion and the crowd began to wander out of the theatre, I linked his arm with mine and guided him out to the street—did I fuss a bit settling his cloak and hat on him? Yes, I did. He was entirely in my hands, though. He did not seem to have the internal fortitude to accomplish something as simple as preparing himself for the night air, let alone hailing a cab, so I tended to all.
“I merely wished to acquaint myself of our adversary. As I have often remarked, I must have data.”
Finally, he seemed slightly more calm.
I honestly do not believe that I could have positioned myself better—there was the issue of my not being spotted, after all, which I was not—and how could he determine that my hiding-place was faulty if he has not been to the very spot to observe the actual lay of the land? Miss S’s description was accurate and useful, but she did not specify the location of every single bush and tree and stone in the road.
say the words aloud. Granted, sometimes it was muttered in an undertone to himself, but he had to vocalise it all or he would go mad.
“Take it out! Take it out of the box, Daddy!” he demanded, waving it frantically at John, who beamed at him and took it.
John sighed and hit the “play” arrow; he had never liked murder mystery films before—before Sherlock. But now he found them amusing and—if he could take that sort of credit—rather simplistic.
“He said
They both laughed.
Why cannot I celebrate his life and mourn his death with the intensity with which I actually experience both? Is it because I am British? An ex-army captain? A doctor? —both occupations being rife with deaths of the most horrific natures. Is it because our love was illicit?
“And yours is much more… traditional, and I have never once objected to that.”
He did and I was.
“You are thinner; you have not been eating,” I reprimanded, seating myself. “You worry our poor landlady to death when you do that.”
I leaned over him and kissed him as I turned off the tap.
“No wonder none of them came forward earlier; rather awkward to have to report that your dealer’s sliced off your ear because you haven’t paid for your illicit substances,” John mused, expertly examining the wounds.
I carefully unwrapped his hands, teasing the cloth, stiff with dried blood, away from his damaged fingers. I wiped them and wrapped them in clean bandages. “Does it hurt a great deal?” I asked.
Her long skirt, still covered by her immense, coarse apron, was gathered halfway up to her knee, exposing her bare ankle and foot—and the exposed skin was horribly reddened.
“Oh,” he sighed. “It was rather dull. After I realised that the intruder could not have lifted both herself and all those dishes through the window, I went around and examined the door that led directly into the kitchen. It was clear from the impression in the soft dirt around it that someone had recently rested a wicker basket beside it. From that I deduced that the intruder had transported those objects in a picnic hamper, placed them outside the door at the rear of the house, lifted herself into the dining room through the window, then unlocked the door from the inside and brought her burden inside to set up her macabre scene.”
She nodded and answered the call. “Yes?” She spoke briskly; professionally. She listened for a few seconds. “So, he’s back?” A pause. Listening. “No,” she replied calmly. “I haven’t seen him. I’ll let you know if I do. Bye.” She ended the call. “Get going,” she breathed, tipping her head towards the door.
“I’m not a DI yet,” Greg pointed out. He looked at him carefully. “You just got out of rehab or somewhere,” he declared.
What had happened to him?
Where was I? If this was for publication, my editor would mark the above paragraphs through with rather vicious strokes of his pencil.
Mycroft rolled up his sleeves, pulled the small stool over, and, with a sigh, bent over the tub’s edge with a flannel and carefully—so carefully—removed as much dirt and muck from his brother’s skin as he thought safe. He didn’t want to rub him raw.
“Did you?” I enquired teasingly.
“You were in disguise,” I realised.
Despite the soothing scene, all four of them were terribly on edge. Nothing was right. The injection had quieted Sherlock, but it had not calmed him. Behind the terrible lethargy it brought on, it was obvious that he was fighting it; still agitated.
Needless to say, I kept to my own bed last night.
The bell startled me; I had been engrossed in a recent medical journal and had tuned out my surroundings—quite deliberately, I might add. I was greatly concerned about Sherlock, but I felt that my constant attentions were distressing rather than helping him, so I had stepped back from my efforts to draw him out.
That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for his part, stood staring—
“What are you doing?” Sherlock was finding it difficult to form words. God, whatever Victor had given him was lovely. His brain was barely controlling his autonomic functions, let alone racing out of control the way it usually did.
“I… I don’t know. I cannot seem to gather my thoughts. How long have I been in here by myself?”
It was not the first time I had tended to the Thatcher family. There had been other injuries and illnesses, including the passing of elderly Mr Thatcher. I had been under a misapprehension early in our acquaintance that he was her father, but I learned after I treated him for a bad chest that he was actually her father-in-law. Miss Thatcher was really Mrs Thatcher, and I finally did meet her husband, who worked at the brewery and so was usually out hours before I rose.
She blinked in surprise, and for a moment I was afraid that she would end the interview or at least protest his question, but I should have had faith that he was in complete control, and I admit to feeling a thrill as she rose to his bait.
“Sherlock?” I pressed. “What were you doing?” He suddenly found something that seemed to interest him keenly in the newspaper. I knew what this meant. “You were poisoning yourself with that damned cocaine the entire time, weren’t you?”
He wondered how far the drops of soup would roll down her hair versus her face.
“Did you arrange to withdraw any funds?”
When she had first entered his room; he was seated cross-legged on his bed, fidgeting with something. What was he doing? She leaned over him and he shied away, frowning at her.
have impulses. Urges. You know you do.”
“No. You may read it.”
John looked at the scrap of paper. It was written in thick, black marker—just a phone number and a name. He didn’t even know why he still had the paper. He had entered the number into his mobile’s contacts—first and last name—not long ago.
Sherlock never cared what his tea was in—he would reach out for one of Mrs Hudson’s delicate cup-and-saucer bits as easily as a lovely, thick (heat retaining!) mug as long as it had three to four sugars and lots of milk.
“Love?”
We have had another dreadful conversation just now—Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock, and I.
He rolled towards me then, and I was so very gratified to feel his slight weight as it pressed against me.
“I do not believe so. She would not have gone this far in accusing us if she thought that it might somehow reveal such a terrible secret.”
I smiled at his merriment, then shook my head. “What amuses you so, my love?” I wondered.
Philic
“You’ll be having dinner with your brother in a bit,” the nurse informed him. “Isn’t that lovely?”
[Sherlock has added:
“He mentioned my war wounds, and conjectured that it was they that inhibited my ability to...” I stopped myself. “Is that what he has told Mrs. Bloom? That he was crippled in some way?”
“Oh, what have you done to yourself now?” I exclaimed, hoping that the exasperation in my voice would disguise the concern. Sherlock was in the open doorway, propped up between two young boys, smiling sheepishly up at me.
[John’s response:
“Sherlock?” I burst out, almost before I had the door open.
Mycroft, uncharacteristically, waited quietly, sensing that the man had more to say.
stupid big brother
you accuse me of lying?”
“I placed your correspondence on your desk. –Sherlock”
“No... no,” I managed to gasp out. “She cannot know...” I found it impossible to continue.
“Good lad,” Mrs Parker praised. “How about some biscuits and a lovely cup of tea?”
“Do not direct any ire at Mrs Hudson, Doctor. She did precisely what I have instructed her to do—she does not mention me and she only communicates with me when my brother is afflicted in such a manner. Of course, now that you are here—I suppose all of this should have been revealed earlier.”
“What’s wrong?” His father’s gentle voice had an unfamiliar edge to it; he realised that the elderly man had grabbed the phone away from his wife at the mention of his name.
“It will be whatever you wish it to be,” I promised. “Whatever you need, I will gladly offer.”
Would he need an eye patch?
“That would be useful,” he shot back. Why was Mycroft talking to him like he was a four-year-old? “Obviously.”
“How do you think?” her boss replied bitterly.
“Oh, poor you,” I teasingly grumbled back. “We have both been horribly spoilt and it is time that we took on some responsibilities here.”
“No… that was not it.” She stopped speaking, looking so distressed that I wished to embrace her as I so often did my darling when he was unhappy.
“Come over here,” Winifred invited, placing her bag on the table in a different bedroom than he had been inhabiting. She had found her patient there, sitting on the floor and impatiently flipping through the pages of a book. Etta had filled her in on their patient’s somewhat rough start to the day—a tetchy stomach, outburst in the kitchen. Thankfully, things had smoothed out after that. He had seemed to genuinely enjoy his brother reading to him, and after that, he had gone wandering through the immense house, eventually involving himself in a creative (and harmless) activity.
She cannot possibly know what a thrill it always is to me when Sherlock grasps my wrist or arm; when he puts his lips so close to whisper to me that they sometimes brush my ear.
Ethereal features; whip-thin limbs—and an iron constitution. I do not exaggerate in my published stories when I describe the discrepancy between Sherlock’s appearance and his surprising strength. Without another word he nodded and swept her up in his arms, she making a few dignified squawks of protest. I walked very closely behind them, ready to catch them if he faltered, but he easily transported her up the steep kitchen steps.
“Sometimes, yes,” I agreed, “apparently so, but I think that in many of those cases it is not as sudden nor inexplicable a decision as it appears… or, if it is a sudden decision, it is usually predicated by extreme and unusual circumstances.”
“Go away, Watson, won’t you?” he begged, his voice hoarse.
The first time he missed his daughter’s dance programme, he was entirely conscious of the direction he had chosen. The first missed birthday party. The first missed anniversary. He knew what he was doing.
“I will stay and keep watch here with you tonight,” Henry offered.
Possibly all the shapes, if attached to one another in the proper way, made up a human being.
24-hour nursing care was called for. Anyone who had any contact with him would need security clearance, and all were required to sign a confidentiality agreement. Mycroft glanced at Anthea, who had been standing in a corner, out of the way, during the entire examination, and she nodded. “I’ve got an app for that,” she reported calmly. The nursing agency they were using screened their staff well; it would not take much for her to do the additional work necessary to clear them for service and get the necessary agreements signed. It most certainly wasn’t the first time someone in the imposing house had required intense, but confidential, medical intervention.
“Hullo, Watson,” he said rather shyly. “Did you get more of that cherry tobacco that we both enjoyed?”
“I have been trying so very hard,” he managed, his voice low. He was clearly chagrined about whatever had occurred.
I now first listened closely. I could not hear any alarming sounds. I knocked, making a point of imagining that I was in our rooms at Baker Street, knocking him up to see if he wanted breakfast or something equally mundane.
She had arranged some of the pillows up against the headboard of the enormous bed. She propped herself up. “Come cuddle, love,” she instructed, and he eagerly curled up against her. She held the book open in front of them and began to read.
Sherlock nodded. He began to meticulously return each crayon to the box. While he focused on this, Mycroft gathered up the remainder of the papers from the floor, and Solomon handed him the drawings from the other room. He tapped them into a tidy stack. “These are very interesting, Sherlock,” he told him, sincerely. “Shall I keep them safe for you?”
There were a few false starts on one page, and then the final result was carefully copied, sans crossed-out words, on a fresh sheet in Sherlock’s tidiest writing. I admit that I counted the words; there were, of course, exactly twenty-four. Mrs Hudson would not, even if we were paying for the advertisement, tolerate the 1d cost for every extra word over the standard 24.
“I’ll save it for court.”
His eyes opened wide. It was something we seldom did. When we were out, we were, of course, accustomed to dining in inns and hotels, but when at home, Mrs Hudson spoilt us thoroughly by making everything she served us herself. When she left us to spend a few days with her sister, we would go out for our meals. The last time we had brought prepared food in had been a year prior, as close as I can calculate, when, after some rather surprisingly colourful words from Mrs Hudson—directed towards a smoking and ill-behaving stove—she had set out to purchase something for lunch and employ someone to repair the monstrous thing.
Mycroft spun rapidly around, whipping the hand holding his cigarette behind his back and looking decidedly guilty. “No!” he exclaimed.
“I shall lay the facts before you and allow you to make your own deductions.” He shifted himself so he was sitting on top of the bedclothes, facing me. “The Blooms do not have any children.”
“Sherlock,” the thin man sighed. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“He is a spy?” I exclaimed in some disbelief.
I felt my heart skip a beat. He was treading on thin ice.
[There is a note in Sherlock’s writing at the end of this: John, I am so very contrite. I have just read your rendering of this adventure of ours as it appears in The Strand and, looking back, I am rather appalled at my behaviour. I wish that I could object; could say that you exaggerated and painted me in an ill light, but you were quite precise. I was rude and cruel and so dismissive towards you that I am surprised at you deciding against abandoning me for a time; I most certainly deserved it.
