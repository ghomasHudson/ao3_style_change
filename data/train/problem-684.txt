I laid my head down, reaching my hand out. John took it without hesitation. He stayed quiet, but his thinking was so loud. They swam around, his thoughts, they floated above our heads and around our hands. I didn't know if I liked them. I liked that he kept quiet. I sniffed and raised my head.
John raised an eyebrow, "I'm sorry, what am I then?"
"Really? Was it weird going with a guy when all those couples were around?"
Sherlock took another drag just to do something with his free hand.
Sherlock spun side to side in the chair. There was a heavy silence in the space between John's breaths, and an even heavier one between Sherlock's.
He let out a huff and sank back into his bed.
Sherlock stepped forward and placed his legs on either side of John's hips. He leaned down and  kissed him softly, but John wasn't fooled. He saw fire in Sherlock's eyes and could feel the twitching in his fingers.
"That was part of it."
John rolled his eyes, "Please?"
John held up his hand, "Uh, I don't know- What-" He blinked rapidly, "Why would we need to talk-"
"You called?" John looked over his shoulder.
"Humans are predictable, John. All I did was use precedent."
"In your perspective."
Before John could respond Sherlock had already turned on his heel and left, leaving John slightly out of breath and late to class.
"Oh, thank god. Let me in? I've been looking for hours. God, I thought you might've died."
Sherlock winced. His words were too hard. Usually Sherlock would be fine with it, maybe even ive John a smile, but right now... God, right now it was too much.
“Not often, figured this was a special occasion.”
"So, you just wanted me to kiss you?"
“...You know about him?” (Dumb question, obviously he did.)
He liked being the one to make Sherlock both mad and happy. He liked laying on his bed and staring at the ceiling. He liked being able to just talk, without worrying about what Sherlock was gonna say, since Sherlock said odd things himself. He liked being asked questions and feeling like there was a reason he was being asked those questions. God, he just really liked Sherlock.
By the time he got home he was dead on his feet. He felt like he would never be truly awake again, his whole life from now on would be blurred and fuzzy. He walked up the stairs with his eyes half closed, not even caring that his sister actually looked in his direction as she made her way out the door.
“Are you alright? What’s wrong?” John asked, finally coming into focus.
The man held out his hand, "John Watson. If you didn't know already."
The sound stopped for a bit, then John felt someone shaking his shoulder. Neither Harry nor his dad had ever woken John up like that before. They usually resorted to shouting.
John's eyebrows knit together, "I just…I just wanted to know more, Sherlock." He looked at the ceiling, "Sorry."
John tried to communicate everything he had yet to say through that kiss. He wanted Sherlock to know everything he had thought from the moment John  saw him. He wanted Sherlock to know that he wanted him from the beginning, and that nothing felt more satisfying than having him right here.
John blinked, then couldn't come up with a reason not to. He sat up, Sherlock rolling off to the side, and pulled his shirt over his head.
had changed.
Sherlock's voice was too high and too quiet. He was looking at his cigarette in hand, his other one tapping on his thigh.
“I would do it anyway.” John answered.
"You." He sighed a bit, "God, Sherlock."
"Nothing you have a part of."
worked a bit harder on this one. i'm stuck between making them longer and thus letting people get more into them and have less question and getting them out a bit faster. not posting after a few days makes me feel anxious. maybe i should just work on that instead.
John rolled his eyes before kissing Sherlock again, his hands on either side of Sherlock's face and Sherlock's chest pressed against his.
Sherlock's head fell, a small smirk on his face, "John…I'm not interested in them."
Sherlock threw his hands up, "Exactly. This is completely unreali-"
"Leaving." She stated before slipping out the door and shutting it behind her. John frowned and looked out the peep hole, seeing an equally dressed up brunette meet Harry at the door, beaming brighter than the sun.
“John.”
John raised his eyebrows, "Yeah, how 'bout we sleep."
The cabbie asked where exactly he was going and before he knew it he was back at Baker Street, where the memories were the loudest.
John's smile then was a bit heavy, "Sherlock, it could go well."
(edit: changed this chapter a bit in hopes to make it less confusing. small changes, mostly affecting the timeline. also don't worry about not getting to see john and mary's relationship in a bit more detail, i'm working it into the fic. gonna try and focus more on making the chapters good than getting them out fast. see you next time x)
“What? What about the killer?”
If he had to describe their dynamic, Sherlock would say she was like a little sister, but that really wasn't it. Sherlock would never do this with a younger sister, to a younger sister. He trusted Finn more than he would a sibling, and that would probably be both their downfalls.
Silence buzzed around both of them, and when John looked up Sherlock's eyebrows were knitted together slightly, just enough to make a small wrinkle. John looked back down.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yep. The knight in shining armor."
"Why not, Sherlock? Remember when you were first in my room and you said I felt suffocated? I didn't believe you, but you're right. You're so right." John gripped the sheets around him,
"Alright." He handed it back, hands slow, eyebrows pulled together, "Don't do anything stupid. Call me if you need anything, anywhere, anytime."
"So, she was a distraction?"
“I think it’s worth it to find out.”
"Yet."
"You're s-such a-
This earned a little smile from Sherlock, "No. Of course not, but I tend to be much quieter when I'm wrong, John."
He didn't know what he would say to Sherlock. Would he start off with telling him about the dare? Maybe Sherlock wouldn't care either way. Maybe that was the reason John should tell him, no consequences.
"I thought I addressed this, you do count." Sherlock gave a small smile.
Sherlock didn’t sleep. He didn’t want to lose this, and he knew if he let himself fall asleep he would’ve. He wanted the day to be longer, time to stretch this moment into an eternity so he could sit here, live here, and never have to be anywhere else.
There was a full minute of silence after that, in which John thought he had messed up. Sherlock was staring at him, the ash on the end of his cigarette growing by the second.
"Yes, babe?" Sherlock stopped, but didn't go anywhere, keeping his head at John's stomach.
"How'd you even get in here?"
"Yeah, junkies."
He mulled it over for most of Sunday morning.
"So what?" He shouted, throwing his hands in the air, "So what if I'm being dramatic, John? Not everyone wants to be as boring as you."
"Have you not met me?"
Sherlock didn’t want to think about her. He probably shouldn’t have felt this guilty, but it sat in his chest like the pit in a peach. He only saw her the moment she left, pulling out from the driveway.
“We could. I’m sure Mycroft would provide-“
"I don't need a babysitter." Sherlock let his eyes go cold and sharp. It wouldn't make Mycroft change his mind, at this point there was nothing that would, but he definitely wasn't going to make it easy. He had already mapped out all the exits, including the ones in the bathrooms and closets. It wouldn't be hard to get out and away if he needed to.
"You'd be surprised."
"Well, I'm not leaving you here."
"Got it." Sherlock said, "Would've expected somewhere lower."
Sherlock carried on, "I'm getting good."
John wanted to laugh. He did a lot more than hit on John.
John wrapped his arms around his middle, around his pale pink sweater and undershirt. He looked down at his feet.
. It felt like John wasn't just kissing a boy, but kissing
"I would rather have you here." John said, his eyes on the floor.
John shook his head, his hands still pushing Sherlock away, wishing, pleading that he would leave because if he didn’t, John wasn’t sure he would be able to muster up the courage to do it himself.
Everything had (Mostly) gone to plan. Sherlock was back in London, breathing in the city. He stepped into various shops, watching as everyone walked around, like ants in an enclosure. Not the most original thought he had.
First it's gonna be people just saying it, but then it's gonna be people believing it. It won't matter whether or not it's true."
"Lovely, really."
"No- Yes. Sort of. I don't- I'm not-" Sherlock inhaled, "I don't know how to handle people wanting to be around me. And you seem to want that."
"Here."
“My clothes are fine.”
At school, Molly wouldn't leave him alone.
Sherlock sat up and opened the door, getting out and looking back at John expectantly.
She shrugged and moved against the wall.
John huffed.
It was a single bed on the third floor. Shower wasn't awful, nor was the actual bed. He could live with this. Hopefully not for long, but for the night it was manageable. He flopped down on the bed, not bother to dry off or even lay down a towel, his whole body relaxing into the mattress, and his feet unbelievably sore from the walk.
"Because you're boring." Sherlock said towards the ceiling.
John looked out across the streets. He saw two people on a bench, their hands intertwined, one head on the other's shoulder. A car passed and splashed water but they didn't even flinch. He looked at Sherlock.
“Just see what he likes. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t go with girls." She said with scandal in her breath, "It’ll just be for kicks.”
"Tell me anyway."
"People say that you two actually
"I'd much rather be here."
Sherlock let out a deep sigh, “I don’t…. It’s- I don’t really like it there.”
Again.
Sherlock chuckled, "Who said I was sane?"
"John?"
“So?”
(See the end of the chapter for
And Sherlock
"And you didn't. That's my point."
"Then tell me about yourself." John's hand fell to Sherlock knee, Sherlock's eyes dropping with it.
John looked him up and down, "I wouldn't be surprised if you did, but I don't think I'm quite as pessimistic."
"An ass." John tilted his head up, "Too arrogant for your own good."
"I can change my mind."
John instantly felt selfish for thinking that. He had hurt Sherlock too. John sighed and stood, deciding it was better wait outside, the movement allowing him to think about something other than waiting.
"What should I start with?"
"Never wanted to." Sherlock lit a cigarette and blew a puff of smoke into the air.
In the brief moments that Sherlock was quiet, John wasn't even annoyed at how much Sherlock had been talking. Actually, it felt kind of nice to have someone ask him all that, because Sherlock was actually interested (or at least it seemed) in John's answers.
"That's a stupid question." Sherlock said, his hand making it's way under John's shirt.
hope you enjoyed x
"A date?" He asked quietly.
i think this might be one of the last chapters. i’ll write 1-2 more maybe to wrap everything up but,, i think i’m mostly done with it. i love these boys so much, and i love everyone who’s taken the time to read this. i feel like every fic i write makes me seem john and sherlock in a different way, and it makes me so happy uncovering more about their character with every chapter. it’s not quite done yet, but it will be soon.
They were on the road with as much food as John would let them take and two bags, a suitcase, and a box of books in the backseat. John couldn’t stop smiling.
"You…God, John."
He was putting on his shoes when he heard a honk from his driveway. He looked out his window, and didn't have to see anything more than headlights before dashing downstairs, finding his sister quite dressed up and by the door.
"How 'bout we make a deal, then?"
"I'm not." His mouth hung open on the last letter. John could've kissed him right there.
"Mycroft isn't with you?"
He didn’t know if he was getting better, but he felt brighter. He had found a ‘job’ at a local police station, helping with smaller cases. He was able to put together profiles more effectively than most others, and he enjoyed the stimulation.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and unrolled his sleeve, pulling out a small box.
"You don't have to."
"I think we
"You're not—"
"Too early for questions, John." He gave a little mocking smile.
"Yeah, girlfriend. Gonna test this." He said, referencing this needle.
"I never asked you to worry about me."
John shook his head back urgently, “No… Sherlock, please.”
"You didn't eat all of it." John said.
John turned when he saw a flash of headlights in his window. He smiled to himself and bounced down the stairs, trying not to break his ankle in the process.
Should've been simple.
He took a moment, "Army."
“Yes.”
“Bad different?”
“But you can’t leave her. Not for me.”
John must've been losing his mind. Sherlock chuckled, and John felt warmth from his face all the way to his fingertips.
"How so?"
"I don't know. I'm a bit... worried that it won't work," He fumbled out.
John barely even reacted. He blinked and tilted his head slightly, “She doesn’t.”
"I mean, how did you…?"
He didn’t know where his hands were, or if he would ever find them again as Sherlock’s mouth moved in ecstasy around John’s.
Sherlock sighed, "Why can't you accept that I don't want to talk about it?"
John looked at him for a long moment, almost trying to figure him out.
John frowned, "So I'm just supposed to ignore it then?"
"Say it again."
"I thought you would like it, with all your value in traditional courtship."
It took forever for someone to answer, a voice John hadn't heard in far too long.
"Hey."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I want to be with you because I like you, not because of some stupid dare."
"That's not an answer."
"No, they went to
In his classes John was a mess. He couldn't sit still. Either his leg was shaking or his fingers was tapping on his desk all through the lesson. He kept looking out the window or towards the door, as if he could summon Sherlock with pure will.
"My point is... I don’t know how to do this."
fuck. im in love with my own fic. this is my new child. (also i think i figured out how to format it right?)
John shook his head, "I never have money, dad. I don't got a job, remember?"
He had fallen against the side of the bed, John crouched over him, his hands back his his hair. Sherlock wanted to shake him off.
"I can't believe you think that."
"You have an unfair advantage." John pointed out.
Sherlock sighed and sat up. His legs were on either side of John's hips and his hair was a complete mess. His eyes were a crystal blue now, and they scanned over John in a familiar way. Simply a week without Sherlock had been too much. John felt like he needed to absorb every inch of him.
Hell, he had a girlfriend to do that with.
Sherlock nodded.
“Exactly.”
"Don’t you?"
"Stay for awhile?"
"And take away the privilege of getting to see you like this?"
John's eyebrows hooded his eyes, "Not the time."
"I wouldn't?" Sherlock cocked his head, "Why not?"
John didn't really know what to say to that. He was. No need to reiterate.
"I don't expect everything to instantly go back to the way it was just because we want it to, and you should do the same." Sherlock said, his hand in his pocket and his face blank and solid.
He found a vein and pushed out just a little, gauging the effects. Finn's head immediately tilted back, and he took out the needle.
"Again."
Sherlock knew he would, but it wouldn’t be the same. He wouldn’t be like this.
Sherlock smiled wider than the grand canyon.
Maybe he was over estimating her power on John.
John smiled and looked up to Sherlock.
Okay, maybe he wasn’t a /total/ stranger, but he was close enough.
"Hmm?" John asked, not able to keep his eyes from wandering the room. It was the exact opposite from the living room just a few feet away, and had Sherlock written all over it.
“John, I know, just trust me,” He said quickly, his eyes pleading. Less like a puppy dog and more like the look right before John was almost killed at the hands of some serial killer.  John rolled his neck and started running with Sherlock. The rain splashed around his calves and he could feel the splattering on his entire leg.
Slow. He held back, yes, but guided instead of dominating. Simply teaching instead of taking. Their mouths were open but no tongue intruded. John instead got hints and glimpses of it. Nothing more.
"No, actually I don't."
"Don't give me a lecture Mr. Damsel-in-Distress." She stuck out her tongue, but it turned into a smile.
"Never said I had an accident."
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry."
He probably shouldn't have been this angry. It shouldn't have affected him this much, but god, it didn't do anything.Being locked up for months at a time didn't do anything. Why would he ever want to go back?
John spent the next couple days thinking of the ways he could approach Sherlock, without much result. The only reason he even kept this a possibility was Molly's incessant talk about it. She constantly asked John what he was gonna do, if he was ever gonna do it, until it turned out he didn’t have to.
"Mm?"
He stayed aware of his surroundings, careful to not knock anything over. He gave a quick glance to John. His head was titled back, arms over the sides of the chair, legs stretched out. Sherlock repressed a chuckle, and made his way to the bathroom.
Sherlock pulled himself higher on the bed, "Leave the house?"
"It's okay." John said softly, turning away from Sherlock.
"You are." His breathing was getting faster, his fingers getting numb, "You are. You're trying to force you're way into my life like a fucking quirky, coming-of-age story. Go fuck yourself, John."
"John." The voice was a whisper, but John recognized it instantly.
"Hey, Sherlock?"
John wondered who she was, and what she meant to Harry, and where they were going. He sighed and sat on the couch, tugging his pants down over his ankles.
Sherlock rubbed his hands on his thighs, "I don't wanna be home." He breathed in.
Sherlock laughed, "You
He hoped he was.
Sherlock chuckled, pushed John's shirt up higher and whispered against his skin, "Take this off for me."
"I'm alright, Sherlock."
Molly stopped asking him questions since every time she did John shut down. No matter how much time passed, or how much John built his routine around not having Sherlock there, the wound was still fresh in his mind and the words kept replaying in his head.
"We have a deal." Sherlock snapped at him, "Didn't want to be home so I came here."
John ended up wearing what he wore to school that day, really what he wore to school everyday. He wanted to dress up or look different in any possible way, but his current wardrobe didn't allow it.
He took a breath and snubbed out that cigarette on the side of the building. He nodded his head and John loosened his grip on his arm.
John was pacing.
John’s eyes were wide. He didn’t want to be loud, but
"Breakfast."
house."
John convinced Sherlock to wait until Friday. Sherlock said he was gonna pick John up himself, he wanted it to be as close to a real date as possible. (John had come around to calling it a date. Somewhere between Sherlock kissing him and John getting ready.)
"Maybe I want to be."
She rolled her eyes, "Listen," She brandished a needle, the tourniquet still stuck tight, "Either you call him and have all the nice gay moments your heart can hold, or you wait, keep getting high in this damn building, and lose your happily ever after."
It was soft, slow, like every other kiss Sherlock has shared, and oh, so fucking different. It was the kiss of a lifetime, drenched in time and want. It was utterly perfect.
"So, you like me?"
Sherlock huffed. This was all too normal.
He pulled at his sheets with one hand, as the other felt at the marked skin through the fabric of his shirt, the only evidence of Sherlock’s hands on him, his lips on him. John blocked everything from his mind except his own hands. If he focused on anything else, he would end up punching a wall or throwing a vase.
“I was gonna do it anyway.”
"Besides," John pulled himself onto his side, and propping his head on his elbow, so he could better see Sherlock, "I doubt James Dean would have any interest in me."
John sputtered, "You are most certainly not my type."
Sherlock chuckled, staring at John's hand, "Might've, at one point. I've worn out his patience by now."
Mycroft glared at him, "You have to at least try, Sherlock."
He shook his head, "Alive. In one piece. I'm fine."
"No, no." John chuckled, "The... Greek god thing."
"Actually…You should come over here. I could pick you up."
Everyone said Sherlock didn't have a heart, didn't have feelings, but John could see them clearly. He could also see how Sherlock thought they weren't there. He liked the idea of people leaving him alone, but John wasn't too sure if he actually liked being alone. He seemed to like John around. Either that or John really was an idiot.
Sherlock snuck out of the window when he had finally decided it was time to go home, his hair practically a nest, and his shirt in a fashion that no well intending mother would ever allow. He asked John if he would let him in again, but John didn't know.
“She wants to marry you.” He said softly, like maybe if John didn’t hear it it wouldn’t be true.
"Whatever. You're lucky 'cause you don't get locked up."
“From what you told me, he does go with girls. He goes with everyone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The shuffling continued, but John couldn't find the energy to see what it was. He rationalized it being the wind.
"No. You're the good guy."
"But,
John opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He ran away. With a boy. Sure, he was a scandal, but he probably didn’t care the moment he realized he didn't have to.
Sherlock shrugged.
He got dressed in the morning, got to school on time, did all his school work, and smiled at all of his teachers, but when he came home there was no one. There was no smoke in the air, or ashes on his floor. There weren't quick smiles from beside, or above him. There was no flame anymore.
"You sound tired." John said.
Sherlock sat in silence for a moment, “…You won’t be doing it for me?”
"You didn't want coffee."
On the way John actually told him about Mary. They weren’t madly in love, they didn’t stare into each other’s eyes and see the whole world. Sherlock felt a little relieved at that, that he wasn’t breaking apart a legendary love, or anything decent, according to John.
He came home with me. He picked up my violin and made a joke about glueing it back together because he would miss it too much. I dropped my coat on the floor and he picked that up too. His footsteps weren't right. He didn't walk like he owned the room, more like he was renting, like he was just occupying space, like he was waiting to be kicked out. It was different, and I already had too much different.
It shouldn't have been this hard. This goodbye, because it was a goodbye. Sherlock knew that.
open, and Sherlock grinned like the first time they had met, all wolf teeth and hell.
Sherlock nodded again, keeping his lips sealed.
"Would you rather me come over to ask about the weather? Maybe your grades, or family troubles." He smashed his cigarette into the side of John's bedframe and hopped off the bed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He really needed to stop doing that, "What does
"I think I like it," Sherlock said keeping his hand on John's hip, keeping him close, grounded.
“What? Where?”
"Just went to a drive-in." John answered, following her.
“I would leave her. If you wanted this.”
"Are we gonna talk about it?"
Sherlock stayed still.
It's okay, he just needed to stay calm, he just needed to breathe. It would be alright, he just needed to stay together until John left, and he would.
another one up!!!!! i really like this fic jsjsjjsjsjsjjs.
In hindsight, Sherlock should've changed clothes. The hospital slippers were soaked through and the gown was doing little to shield the rain that was hitting him from all sides. He looked around for the closest hotel, beyond relieved when he spotted one. Could've been in better shape, but at the moment Sherlock wasn't too concerned, hell, it was probably better than an upscale place. Hiding in plain sight and all that.
Sherlock didn't expect John to look at him with pity, "I don't know, Sherlock."
"You wouldn't"
He turned the knob, gently opened the door, and stepped in, not bothering to close the door behind him.
Lestrade hadn't given me any cases. Said he was giving me time, but I didn't need time. I needed something to work one, something to put my mind into. He of all people should've understood that. Mycroft hadn't said anything, Molly wasn't speaking to anyone, and Mrs Hudson was bringing me tea. Every hour on the dot, she would come through the doorway, a tray in her hand, and she would replace the cold mugs with new, hot ones. She still brought two.
"Mycroft decided to take me in when once he turned eighteen."
Another flick.
"Why are you here anyway?"
(See the end of the chapter for
How do you describe everything you’ve every been waiting for? How do you put into words the perfect moment?
?" Mycroft tapped his umbrella against the floor, every tap making John blink harshly.
Sherlock looked surprised, but in a flash it was gone.
Sherlock smirked wider.
John shushed him and went off to make coffee.
Sherlock was a madman. Dragging them into a dim alley and leaning against the wall, doubled over and his chest rising and falling so rapidly it made John’s heart skip. Rain clung to Sherlock's hair, but did little to flatten the curls. John took his time letting his eyes run over every wave and curl in Sherlock's hair while he was still facing the ground.
“And?”
“It’s a…we should talk realistically about this.”
"I know I'm not close. I know I don't know you, but I'm not going anywhere, yeah? I've got a job to do, and that means making sure you're alirght. So... Are you alright. Sherlock?"
"Then don't leave."
"…Amazing."
"And if this keeps going?"
"Can't. Mycroft already hates me, we can't make detours."
John turned to look at him. His eyes were almost clear in the sun. He wondered if Sherlock knew his eyes looked like that. He wondered if beautiful people recognized that they were beautiful.
“I would feel shit.”
He sighed, "Of course I do, John. Otherwise I wouldn't be here." He grabbed John's hand.
Sherlock felt his chest tighten, "Is Mycroft with you?"
John shrugged, "Family."
A part of him wanted John to be there. Sitting in his chair, grumbling over today's paper. His face would light up as he saw Sherlock, so ready to tell him the most recent thing the tabloids have said about him.
“Maybe I should decide that myself?” John asked. Was it even a question, really? John didn’t seem to work in questions.
Sherlock smirked, "You sound like a comic book villain."
Sherlock paused.
Sherlock smirked, "We could definitely sleep together."
He looked down and chewed on his lip, "You didn't do anything with her did you?" He asked his shoes.
"Not if you do it right." He tapped one out and held it out to John, "Here."
John chuckled, and Sherlock could feel it vibrate against his cheek.
Molly tapped him on the shoulder, squeals passing her lips, “John! John!” she said in an urgent whisper. Blue and ash was all John saw at first, stomping towards him with all the grace of a charging bull, all rock and roll and...something John couldn't place.
Sherlock leaned in a little closer, “You’re attracted to
"We're barely doing anything." Sherlock said. His head was already at John's waist. John was glad he could cover those marks up.
He couldn’t shake the feeling that all of it would go bad, that it would blow up in his face. John would start to hate him, would leave, would forget about him.
Sherlock shook his head, "Not really. Just distractions, John."
John chuckled softly, "Yes. Here. Because if I let you off now, you'll find a way to get me to let you off forever."
"Good. See you soon?"
Sherlock found his way to John's neck again, adding to the marks that were already there. John's every nerve was on edge. He could feel every breath and every shift on top of him. His eyes were closed but he knew every move Sherlock was making.
"I mean, it's better than living with my mom and dad, but…"
One, he liked having Sherlock around and wanted him around more.
Two years.
John was going to set this house on fire. He knew Sherlock was trying to prove a point of some kind by getting John to do something, but how in the world was he supposed to know what it was?
"Mycroft, probably, so we'll have to be quiet." He reached for John's hand, and pulled him upstairs as soon as he had it. John was then dragged down a hallway and into a room. It looked like a normal teenager room that someone then smashed with a bat.
God, he wished everyone would leave him alone.
"So, am I less human for not saying it?"
He smiled wide, "Wanna go on a ride?"
Sherlock laughed, turning the key, and John could feel the rumble through his entire being.
He smirked at John, "Ready?"
"Be safe? And I can't keep a secret?"
John grinned, “Yeah, fair. You don’t have to talk about him, you know.”
"People say Sherlock showed up at your house and they never saw him leave."
"Okay."
“Don’t wanna say.”
"And that way is?"
“I’m not one known for listening to others.”
Sherlock's smirk grew, "I had no idea you existed until this very moment. Are you going to answer my question?"
He put his hand over John's, then sighed and shook his head, "Alone is what I have, John. Alone protects me."
John huffed, "It's too early for questions, Sherlock."
"Humans are built to be bored, John, it's what makes us different from the apes who can pick fleas all day long and don't think about a higher purpose."
Sherlock  blew a cloud of smoke out of his mouth, "Whenever you feel like  you would prefer to have someone besides your drunk family-"
"Well, at least I get to stay longer. Even though it's because you're alone most of the time anyway." He sat up and John rolled to the side.
He did like having Sherlock here, no doubt, and it had to be somewhat bad if Sherlock didn’t go to school. Or he could've just completely ditched (that's what everyone else thought anyway).
"Why'd you ask? Why'd you talk to me to begin with?"
"Bad form. You should be better at this by now." He said.
John smirked, smuggness lining his lips, "You wouldn't."
A part of him was surprised that he wasn't found yet, another part slightly disappointed. He sighed, shut his eyes and willed for his mind to shut off, falling asleep just like that, in a puddle on a cheap hotel bed.
"What was your accident, then?" Sherlock asked in a cool tone.
"I know."
"Go ahead."
John almost snorted at himself.
John tugged his arm until he laid back down, pushing his face into John's neck. John didn't like that Sherlock put up his guard so easily. He wished they would get past…whatever this was.
"Right." His eyes darted across the carpet, "Let me know when you find a place, yeah?"
Sherlock waved his hand, "Know that, I mean where?" He gestured vaguely to the man's body.
"Exactly. I don't expect you to want to be around me all the time, because I don't want you to expect the same from me."
He smoothed out his clothes and opened the door with a bit more apprehension in his body than he would've liked. Sherlock was already standing there, white sleeves rolled up past his shoulders and black washed jeans high above his ankles. His hair was pushed down with a flat top hat, but still sneaked under the visor, curling it's way over Sherlock's eyes. All the air left John's lungs.
"My assumptions are usually right."
"Good, because…well, I was thinking-"
Sherlock shrugged again.
"What's one little kiss gonna hurt, Doll?"
“He doesn’t stay with girls, and don’t be so dramatic, not everyone. Please? It'll wipe that look off his face, if anything."
"We're boyfriends?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes then kept them fixed on John, watching him attempt to take a drag. John tried to make it look cool, but the moment it hit his throat he could feel a cough coming, and it wasn't long before it came out.
John didn't miss a beat, "Why's that?"
"I could say the same."
“...You and Mary…?”
Sherlock seemed to constantly pulling John in different directions. One moment he thought he was a jerk, and the next he made John laugh. It both confused and fascinated John. He stood from the chair and sat on the bed, next to Sherlock.
"Flew through the window."
“How much of it?”
"No. Isn't my job." John said simply.
Because, of all notable things, John was taken.
John nodded.
“I doubt he would picture our relationship going this way.”
Sherlock pursed his lips, "...What am I to you?"
John didn't really know why he said that. There was no point in making conversation. In fact, he probably shouldn't make conversation, so he doesn't give Sherlock any reason to keep talking to him.
John ran a hand through his hair, (short, choppy, recently cut) "We talked about this."
"I don't know what you want me to do."
He moved closer and kissed John’s forehead, “Don’t let me forget this.”
"Here."
"According to your brother, I do."
"I've never sat like this before." John said stupidly.
"Where are those bruises from?"
He stayed up and watched how the sun rose on John’s face, revealing the palest of freckles across the tip of his nose.
"No?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "Not in the typical sense."
“Your clothes are all the same.” Sherlock muttered from John’s closet.
“What way?”
John kissed Sherlock's chest, "So, are we?"
Sherlock shrugged.
"What do you wanna know?" John asked, yawning towards the end.
Every time he saw Molly she was frowning. She kept trying to pry more and more into what him and Sherlock did all weekend, but John just shrugged her off. He couldn't bring himself to care, nor find the energy to make a believable lie when all he was focused on was whether or not Sherlock was even alive.
Maybe it was because John didn't have to tell her everything now. In fact, it seemed more productive to tell Sherlock everything. Maybe John should feel bad about that.
"I was the one who started it."
Sherlock drove him to a movie- a passion pit. John never liked that term very much, especially now that he was going with Sherlock. He really did want all of this to matter in some small way. It wouldn't be better for either of them, it would probably just make things more complicated, and it drained John, but he couldn't help but yearn for meaning.
Sherlock ordered a milkshake, but let John sneak drinks of it when he wanted. He sat across from him, but would bump their feet together whenever he could. He stared at John with all the willpower of the world, and John was sure Sherlock could move mountains at that point.
"I'm flattered."
"Do you really think that?" John bit his lip.
Enough air, enough of Sherlock, enough of this.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "You're drifting from the point. Humans always want more, I'm just able to say it."
John pulled his lips tight and stared at Sherlock for a long few moments.
"Then why are you here, Sherlock? Why did you even want to talk to me?"
Sherlock  took a long, smooth drag from his own cigarette. Show-off.
"I'm not!" John said, a small smirk already brewing on his face.
He had to pull away to keep from combusting.
John seemed a bit lost, wandering about by the door, while Sherlock had moved under the covers and pulled them above his head. He didn't know what time it was, but he did know that every bone in his body was calling for sleep.
“I’m not cute, shut up.”
John huffed, "So you just get to know everything that's happening in my life, but I have to sit through you not trusting me?"
He looked at the ground for a long moment before lifting his head and paying the cabbie.
“Fuck normal. Don’t want it.”
"He and Sherlock had just gone to an ice cream parlor."
He stood but his vision was too bright around the edges. He had done this all before, except not he was the bad guy. Now he was the shitty one.
"Figure it out."
He watched as John’s eyes fluttered open and landed on his face. He watched as John’s lips slowly curved into a smile, skin tinted the color of the sun. He reached out a hand and ran his finger down John’s cheek, skin brushing skin, rose-dawn hugging them both close.
I couldn't find words then. All of them were the same. We stayed quiet, a good amount of time passing without words. Evening light came through the window and John should've been asking about dinner, he would've been asking about dinner about now, but instead, he was back from the dead, taking up too much space in a chair that I had thought would be empty for as long as it was there. He didn't look at me, he looked at the wallpaper, looked at the sofa, looked at my chair before he looked at me.
Sherlock was partly worried that Mary would be sitting right on the bed, refusing to go anywhere. This wasn’t his drama, and he didn’t know how he would handle being right in the middle of it.
John thought about it for a moment, "I like you because…God, you're brilliant. You're interesting, and I feel this need to spend more time with you. I like you because there's always more that I don't know, and a day with you feels like an eternity, and a day without you feels like too much. You…I don't know how to even put you into words, Sherlock. I love you."
"Have you ever actually watched any movie?"
As for John, he was… Brilliant. More than. It wasn’t picture perfect, but it was perfect enough. They both worked well together. Fights were rare, and were never serious. John always took the time to remind Sherlock he was staying, a luxury he never had in past relationships.
He looked up, and Sherlock was already there, just a few inches away. John could pull him closer, pull him under his thumb.
John's head sprung up. He turned slightly, and out of the corner of his eye saw a small movement. He rolled over and pulled himself up into a sitting position.
"I…" He sighed and looked up, "I never said I wasn't."
"Sherlock." John said quietly, like the name itself was dangerous.
"You do know that I have a hot cup of coffee in my hand right?"
"Stop, my head hurts." He chuckled.
"Dick. You're such a dick, Sherlock. Don't flatter yourself."
"I don't mind, and yes. I'll leave whether you know about it or not."
"Flattering."
By that time Sherlock's eyes were drooping and John didn't know if he should tell him to go home or let him fall asleep right there.
Sherlock brought his shirt up more, and ran his thumb across the space right under John's ribcage, "No. Well, yes, but in a different way."
"Were you hurt?"
Sherlock pressed his hands flat on John's chest. John felt like screaming. Ten more seconds passed and he couldn't take it. He sat up, and pulled Sherlock in again. Sherlock tasted like burnt rubber and cigarettes, which sounded terrible in John's mind, but he didn't actually mind it.
"Can you change your mind about getting out of bed?"
Sherlock had pushed him back onto the bed, and John could smell the smoke on him, on his worn leather and cotton shirt. He destroyed every protest John had, consumed them in an instant. John couldn't breathe, couldn't move.
"No, you're right." He stood, "You never asked me to be here, not once."
Both of them were vaugely damp from the rain, but they were still pressed closed together, John holding onto Sherlock tight, and Sherlock folding into the embrace.
"Yes. But you did it anyway." My voice still had an edge to it, an edge that contrasted his desperate attempt at normalcy.
"Um…" He turned his head a bit, "It looks like a rhino." He raised his arm next to Sherlock. He wondered if they would look like conjoined twins with this many limbs this close.
"Not all the time, no. Just when I find it amusing." He cracked a grin, and John couldn't help but return it.
Clothes and paper and books were strewn across the floor, bed was unmade, and John hoped those holes in the wall weren't from bullets. Sherlock's hands went on John's hips, pulling him closer than necessary.
"Well, I'm not leaving anyway, and yes, it has. I think my track of time is better than yours at the moment."
"Can't just what? Stay here? You think?"
“Is that a yes?”
." John hissed.
John nodded and pulled Sherlock back in.
Sherlock shifted, but didn’t respond. John took the opportunity to push closer, his mouth now against Sherlock’s neck.
So, he told him. He told John everything he had gone over in his head a thousand times, from meeting him to losing him. His heart was beating way too fast, and his stomach was going to jump ship at any moment, but he kept forcing the words out.
Instead, he reached for Sherlock's hand. It wasn't that far apart to begin with, so all it took was one small movement and his hand was in John's.
John looked up, "Hi."
Sherlock sighed, "You're very persistent."
"You kept saying it!"
Sherlock shook his head lightly, turning to the side. Finn was nodding out at the same time, her head dipping and rising, trying to get a look at John but was mostly unsuccessful. John himself was already getting frustrated.
Sherlock was certainly of the devil, and oh, how John wanted a taste of hell.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know?"
John was- something else. John was everything Sherlock thought didn't actually exist in a person. He bought Sherlock clothes when he saw his was worn, he lent him his coat when it was cold outside, he laughed when Sherlock got snow in his hair. He was... Not Sherlock's.
Sherlock scoffed, "Mycroft really didn't you about me, then."
Sherlock didn’t deserve this. That was the only thing going through his head on the way back to John’s house. He said he was going to get some of his stuff and break up with Mary, but Sherlock was on the fence that he would actually do it.
John raised his eyebrows, "Do you?"
I sat in my chair, staring at the one opposite me. I sat, and the sun went down, and I couldn't find the energy to get up. I didn’t want to move or breathe or acknowledge that this space was real. When I met John— A long time ago, almost a forever ago— I swore I wouldn’t get attached. I never get attached, but now here I was. John was gone and I… His chair was empty. And he wasn’t coming back.
." He hissed through his teeth.
John shook his head, "I mean, I have a decent life, a decent house, I'm not disfigured or in the war-"
His words were quiet, but they ran through John the way only Sherlock's could.
John rolled his eyes, "Do you have to interrupt me all the time?"
"So...What? I should just let you destroy yourself? Stand back?"
"And yet you still know almost everything."
John blinked and pulled them both back to reality, “You should sleep.”
He could've gone back inside, but by the time he considered it a cherry red car was in his driveway. John didn't know if he should wait for Sherlock to come to the door or meet him at the car, so he stood awkwardly between them, pulling at the fabric of his pants.
This is the part he loved. Just before he explained how his head worked, when his chest felt full and his eyes felt bright. When he felt the only power he had rush through his fingertips and legs, and spine.
"You're nervous." Sherlock stated.
John’s eyes were closed long after it ended, his mouth partly open. It took everything not to kiss him again.
John cocked his head, and kept his eyes on Sherlock, "
"John?"
Sherlock never saw Mary again. In hindsight she was so small, so obviously bitter and full of dark, so fucking expendable. When he thought back on her the pit in his chest had settled to a small pebble. He slowly stopped worrying about her coming back, and stopped worrying about the influence she had over John.
"I didn't want to hurt you, Sherlock."
"Is it really that bad?"
, John. And unless you're a teen girl in a young adult novel, or happen to be polyamorous, I'll take that to be a sign.”
"Because you do look like the worrying type." John rolled his eyes.
"I don't think of you as others, cause you're not like them, John. You never were. You're so different from everyone I've encountered that I can't believe that I have to explain this."
“John?”
"But you didn't," I replied, voice cool and quiet.
Sherlock pulled away, his eyes grazing against the landscape of John’s face.
John took a deep breath, collecting his thoughts, "I think you're brilliant. I think you're... So good, and you need a reminder of that, of the fact that there are people who don't see you as something to be avoided."
Sherlock sucked in a breath thought his teeth, "Everyone thinks you're predictable, boring, mainstream. You're plain and not at all extraordinary. If it wasn't for me you'd end up dating a just-as-boring soc with long blonde hair and dreams of ankle biters."
"Do you think it doesn't matter?"
Sherlock shrugged.
"I'm fine, Dad." He said simply, because for the most part, he was. He had accepted his situation a long time ago, and he could be doing a lot worse.
John didn't know to respond, but before he could think of anything Sherlock was talking again.
Sherlock took the cigarette back, "You'd pick him over me?"
"That doesn't quite make sense then. Boss implies control. You just sound like a stalker."
Sherlock pushed him back against the wall, and opened his mouth to say something, but bared his teeth instead, then leaned back in and sucked a harsh mark right above John's collar.
"Right, because I would go through all this trouble and not care."
Sherlock bit his lip, and John wondered if he would actually answer him.
"People do little else."
"I see…" Eyes, lips,
More heads turned when John walked by, and more breaths floated around him when he sat at his desk.
"I wouldn't call this within reason." Sherlock said, very aware of the space (or lack thereof) between them.
He could feel a smirk forming. He quickly looked down, busying himself with the blanket on top of him. He had no idea who Sherlock was, meaning he could be whoever he wanted to be.
He still looked so calm, and I wished he would break. I had seen him break. I had listened to his nightmares, I had seen him fall. I rested my head in my hand, titled so the whole room was off balance. I wished I could read him. I hadn't been able to that day. I should've seen it coming.
Sherlock sighed, "Why do you like me?"
John frowned.
This bed felt odd. It could’ve been because Sherlock hadn’t had a bed that wasn’t in the hospital in far too long. Waking up next to John was also odd. They had hardly done anything ‘romantic’, but it still far too intimate to be sleeping in his bed.
asked for Sherlock, but right now he wanted him. Right now he couldn't see himself with anyone
"Moving-? What?"
hope yall enjoyed x
"Yes. I don't mind."
Sherlock's muscles tensed.
"Just right." She breathed out.
He readjusted himself in his seat, "What are you talking about, John?"
“Wanna go for a ride?” Sherlock asked, letting his arm fall to this side, dragging his cigarette down with it.
“I hid them behind my bookshelf. I would…” He shook his head lightly, “I would save up money I found around the house until I had enough to buy a record.”
"I'm not asking to define it. I just want to know where you are," John said, "I know this kinda stuff isn't easy for you."
I shook my head. I couldn't think. He always made it hard to think.
Something flickered behind Sherlock's eyes, "You're a virgin."
The whole thing was Molly’s idea. She thought it would be just the most if John led him along. In the middle of the damn year too, when Sherlock had already stared John down plenty of times.
“John, you’re too good. You don’t love her.”
"You should come over." John said, just as quiet.
is telling me about his dreams to run away."
John shrugged, "What if it does work out? What if it's a good idea?"
Girls fell at Sherlock’s feet, there was no denying it. In spite of this, Sherlock never really seemed interested. He could have anyone in (or outside of) the school, but was never the type to go out. Never the kind to ‘do’ relationships.
"And I'm not?" He asked skeptically.
"…Okay. We're gonna talk about this, right?"
"But you're gonna ask anyway." Sherlock said. John could tell he had lit a cigarette from the smell in the air. The first drag always smelled the sweetest.
John jumped out of his thoughts, "Yeah. Selfish."
"How is it not fair?" I asked, sitting straight, keeping my face blank, "If I was the one who fell, who came back without a word—"
"I have a good idea."
He licked his lips.
want to. He just couldn’t. He didn't know what would be left of him if he did. He would just be a whispered name on church gossipers' tongues. A small town scandal. A cigarette burn on his family's name.
"But it certainly makes it more entertaining."
"Even if it's for something as simple as that?"
"If you weren't worried about hurting me, would you agree?"
"Exactly. We could run away."
Sherlock bit his lip.
"Right." John pulled a chair from the wall and placed it next to Sherlock's bed, then sat down, "Guess I'm supposed to be looking out for you?"
"I think we're similar."
"You're always careless. With everything."
"Have you ever smoked, John?"
"Actually no, see, I can just pour this all over you and you'll absorb it through your skin. That's actually how you're supposed-"
Two, Sherlock liked being around John too.
When John got back to school he felt like he was keeping a secret. Like every mark under his clothes and every word Sherlock whispered in his ear was another one he was forced to hide. It was almost a relief coming home to an empty house, where no one would ask questions about where he had been.
Sherlock spun his phone in the hand absentmindedly. Finn was across him, tourniquet wrapped around her arm.
Sherlock looked between them, “What’re- Are we going in?”
“Wh- Sh- I am not-” John’s face was hot and he was stuttering. He hated Sherlock for being able to read him like a book.
He grinned as they pulled up, bouncing out the car and leaving John in his seat, an eyebrow raised.
Sherlock sighed. This is why he needed to be here. She was too careless. If she had done this by herself she would've injected the whole thing.
"Sherlock…" John liked the way his name sounded, where the first half was just a breath on John's tongue.
Sherlock scoffed, setting down his phone, "I don't get a happily ever after. None of us do." He leaned forward, both of them on a cement floor of the worn warehouse building, and tugged on the inner tube wrapped around her arm.
John swallowed and nodded again, then followed Sherlock back to the car. Sherlock's guard was up completely. The more John looked at him, the worse he felt. Gone was the desperate Sherlock over the phone, in person he seemed like he didn't care either way.
Sherlock wanted to lean forward and kiss them, but he didn’t know if that was something he could do.
John snorted, "Well, I've got it made in the shade, don't I?""
Then, Sherlock smiled. It was warm and soft, and John had never seen anything like it. Especially on Sherlock’s face. He smiled like finally,
Sherlock's eyes darted to John's before his head turned, "But?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Yes, John. Now, shush.” Sherlock’s hand was still on John’s chest, and he could feel it with every breath.
"I don't count."
John huffed. Sherlock wondered how hard he would try to hold on.
Every time he saw Sherlock in the hallways after that, he could feel the wet heat of his mouth on his skin. He could feel every fading (and not so fading) mark tingle, and flare up like faulty wiring.
Sherlock spun around, all the paths John took across the flat running through his head, So vivid he could reach out and touch them, see a raised eyebrow, small smile. He only ever smiled like that for Sherlock. Like everything had come together.
"Of course, Doll."
His dad nodded and stood, but decided to say one more thing right before he got to the door.
"You barely know what I like to think."
"In the middle of a drive-in?" He leaned in a bit, his hand making his way to John's thigh, "Where we could be doing something much more interesting."
"Sherl-"
Sherlock pressed his fingers to his own lips with feather-light touches.
Sherlock nodded.
“Home.”
Maybe this would all be okay.
"He's missing out."
"Back so soon? Wasn't your brother supposed to keep you on lockdown?"
"That must be a first."
"Sherlock."
Sherlock frowned, but stayed quiet, eventually moving a bit closer, almost testing the waters, and leaned his head onto John's shoulder. John wrapped an arm around him and pulled him a bit closer.
“I know better than Mary.” Sherlock’s breath cut through the cold rain.
Sherlock towered over him, words heavy in the air and intended only for John’s ears. It was too bad everyone else heard them.
"I don't care what people say. None of it is true." He hissed through his teeth.
Sherlock chuckled and his head dropped, his hair falling over his face. John knew he was dangerous, that his whole family would be shocked, ashamed of the thoughts going through John's head, but Holy Mother of God, look at him. His smile could start a fire, and is eyes could burn down a whole forest. Hell, that's probably his goal.
John tangled his hands in Sherlock's hair and pulled him close. The kiss became harder and rougher, and John didn’t feel like Sherlock was holding back anymore. They both had enough of that, anyway.
"Why should I trust people, John? All they end up being are weaknesses or disappointments."
He was still under the covers, so he doubted that he was at all intimidating, but John still took a moment, quiet and blinking.
After a moment a silence John retracted his hand, his head dipping down. He felt awkward.
Sherlock pulled the covers down, "What're you doing?" He asked, his eyes squinted.
It was all
On Monday he didn't even wait for Sherlock to find him. He scanned the crowd for him the moment he was able to, completely overlooking Molly, who made up for it by hitting him on the shoulder with a book.
They were like planets how they gravitated towards each other, not able to leave the other’s gentle orbit. It felt like nothing. It felt so fucking natural that nothing else. Time, place, relationships. None of it was important.
That is, until Sherlock sprung up and pinned John against the alley wall.
"Well, it really isn't a disscusion anymore, Sherlock."
"I—You're not, Sherlock," he shuffled in his seat, "And I—That's not fair."
By the end of the week, John was barely sure what had actually happened, all he knew was that he was glad he would have a whole two days without false conclusions flying over his head.
Sherlock nodded and turned his hand to press his fingers to John’s lips, a kiss in and of itself.
"What're you doing?"
"Really. I don't want you to stop talking to me."
He started with a sigh, “I’m not a charity case, you know.”
this soon. Just needed something to get him along, to stop the tension between his skull and his brain.
Sherlock took a moment before saying, "In a way. Nothing this far."
"I assumed. More or less."
Sherlock friggn' shrugged again.
For the next week, John did his best to ignore Sherlock's attempts at starting a conversation and soft wolf whistles as John walked by. He didn't let his eyes linger, even when Sherlock's burned holes through him. He made his way through the halls with his books tight to his chest, keeping his head down as best he could.
John shuddered.
"Uh…He's it really." The corner of his lip twitched, "I've lived with him since around eleven years old."
"You."
"Sherlock."
Sherlock blinked. Then blinked again, "...Yes. Most likely."
"Mind readers are fairytales. I don't need to read your mind to read you."
"Not on yourself."
He was sitting by me, squatting with his hands relaxed over his knees. He was saying something again, but my head hurt, and I was beginning to think this wasn't a good idea. I was starting to think that I should go home. I pushed him away and went to stand, shaking my head. That's when I saw him. He looked the same. His clothes were a bit wrinkled, but everything was still the same. I thought he was a hallucination at first (I wouldn't have been surprised), but then he smiled, and Lestrade was talking again.
"Well, there's only- the man at the front de- It would just-"
John walked into school next Monday, confident he was done with Sherlock, over it. Until Sherlock decided he wasn't done with him.
Sherlock shrugged.
"Oh yes. See, I think we both want to get out of here. I think we both hate everyone and everything here."
Sherlock sighed. How could John not see it?
John rolled his eyes. They were already in a cab, sun rising on black, faux-leather seats, Sherlock hanging his hand out the window. Cold air was stinging his arm, and he wondered if it would snow any time soon.
"Sherlock—"
"Hm." He looked back up at the ceiling, "Then that one," He pointed up again, "Looks like a building. A wavy building."
Sherlock closed his eyes. He knew he was being difficult. It would be easier if he acted like he normally did with everyone that tried to ask what they were, but he never found himself doing that with John. A big part of him wanted to protect John. He didn't want to be another dick in his life that threw him by the wayside with scars that wouldn't heal.
Or maybe that was a crock of bullshit to keep Sherlock from overthinking.
Sherlock grinned, "You want to?"
John turned his head, "What kind of deal?"
"Then, how 'bout breakfast?" John said.
"No," He set violin pieces on the coffee table, "Lestrade said it was too much." He sucked in a breath, "And I... wanted to come back."
Sherlock huffed, "Because I wanted to forget, John. I wanted to pretend like everything hadn't just gone wrong."
“Sherlock-“
“So, I’m an experiment?”
"I told you I'm not going."
“She’s normal.”
He exhaled.
"Last week was something that shouldn't have happened."
"Don't mock me."
John was shaking his head, “You’re awful.”
John sat next to him, the bed bending to take his weight as he leaned over to kiss Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock didn’t know whether to shiver or melt.
He smiled, “Let’s go.”
, who was more smoke and mirrors than fire.
"Damn." He muttered, shaking Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock bit his lip, "...Don't wanna sound that eager."
There was a moment of water and foggy breath between them where John glared at Sherlock. He couldn’t help but look at his lips that were so close and tilted just ever so slightly down.
John knew nothing about cars, but he knew money when he saw it. He slid into the passenger seat, running his hands along the interior.
John sighed, his head dipping down "One stop. If you take longer than twenty minutes I'm dragging you in by your two front teeth, alright?"
John sighed and lowered himself to the floor, on the other side of Sherlock. Sherlock scooted closer to Finn.
“...I still haven’t said yes to whatever this is.”
She probably should’ve, honestly. He knew John has said it wasn’t because of him, but he couldn’t help but feel like it was anyway. He could’ve ended up in a half-assed marriage with someone half-decent if it wasn’t for Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head, trying to not think about what John just did, "Think I'll stay here. You can get me coffee."
The man cracked a smile, "it all works out then."
"Well, I'm not gonna leave."
(little bit longer than the others…)
something."
He didn’t know when it became so easy to lie to Molly. Sure, it's not like they made a blood pact, but they were each other's only friends. They told each other everything just because they had no one else to tell.
"What if someone sees us?"
A chuckle ran up John's throat, "Yeah."
"You know I've dealt with this before, right?"
John felt how he did when Sherlock left. His fingers were shaking and he felt slightly dizzy.
"Hired. I know. I meant /why/? Why are you still here? Why are you..." His voice lowered, "Here? With me?"
Sherlock sucked in a drag and turned his head to let it out, staying quiet and weighing out the pros and cons.
"Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes." He got out.
"But, still."
John pursed his lips, then sighed, "Fine."
"Yes, John." Sherlock said forcefully.
John pulled away from Sherlock and sat up, "So what am I then? A weakness or a disappointment?"
Sherlock grinned, "Okay." He leaned over the partion and gave the cabbie directions. He'd done this before, from almost every point in the city. He whispered the words quiet enough for John to not be able to eavesdrop, but loud enough for the cabbie to not ask questions.
John shook his head and he could feel Sherlock's arm wrap around his stomach. He had half a mind to slap it away.
"I should... Probably get another room, then."
"Why not?"
The quick shrug from Sherlock, and the confirmation that John was just a plaything in Sherlock's massive play. John thought about the time they first met a lot , and the way he couldn't believe Sherlock approached him first. The way Sherlock took over John's vision, and how John thought he was a wildfire.
Sherlock would never be shot down. He didn’t go out much sure, but he did like to tease. He played the game as much as anyone. Even how he dressed: dark leather jacket, plain shirt a size too big on his tall, thin body, tucked into black jeans. All of it was meant only to attract, and even though he never went steady, he would still be found petting on girls while a movie flickered in the background, found the next day with fading marks on his neck to accompany the broken skin on his lip.
"You were just responding to what I said in the first place."
"Too much?" Sherlock asked.
John thought about pushing him to the ground. He probably could at this point. Run off with what was left of his sanity.
Sherlock was rolling his eyes.Then his lips were on John and everything lit up. Sherlock’s hands had moved to John’s waist and John wasn’t sure where to put his own. John hastily kissed back, trying to burn everything into his memory, trying to burn everything but this memory. How Sherlock moved against his lips and how his hips were slightly sliding. How one hand had moved to cup John’s cheek and John never wanted it to end. How it felt like an eternity, but it still wasn’t enough. How Sherlock slowly pulled back and looked into John’s eyes.
"People say th-"
"I know, but I did." Sherlock said. Their eyes properly met and Sherlock swore everything was is full, saturated color.
I nodded, keeping my eyes on him. I didn't know if I could trust my eyes. They had failed me before. I should've seen it. I wanted so badly to believe he was still alive, and he was, and I didn't know. Betrayed. I laid my head back down, closing my eyes. John squeezed my hand.
John shook his head, “It’s alright. Things can’t get much worse.”
"Okay. Okay." John took a deep breath. Sherlock hoped he was getting tired of him, "Why do you think that?"
John could barely handle Sherlock. He was in a constant state of fatigue when Sherlock wasn't around, and when he was John's head felt like it was gonna explode. Maybe it was just because he wasn't used to using it.
hope you enjoyed <3
John rolled his eyes, turning them to Molly instead of the crowd, "Not the whole weekend. Just Friday."
“Was too.” John said.
“Conversation about Mary, and pulling you into an alley.”
“You see him?” Molly tilted her head up at Sherlock, now taking a drag from his cigarette.
"Stop acting like an idiot, Sherlock. You know what I'm talking about."
"Exactly. They're more of distraction."
John stared at Sherlock. He couldn't have possibly known all that.
Sherlock's long fingers made their way to John's chin, it shot electricity down John's spine all the way to the tips of his fingers. It caught John off guard, but then again, Sherlock always did.
Sherlock stared back at him, just as fiercely, then reached over him and slammed the car door shut.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know, when I was your age I was dealing with some rough things. A girl had just broken up with me, my pa had just gone into the hospital, and I wasn't feeling all that great. So, I just wanna ask, how're you, John?"
"Then who are you? Who're you supposed to be to me?"
"A bit."
"I can just not go."
Sherlock flicked his cigarette again, still not taking a second drag, "Do you think they care that we're up here?"
Finn had attempted rehab again, but left after a week or so. Sherlock still liked taking her to get something to eat, or every now and again letting her stay over. He didn’t like trying to force things on her after years of forcibly being treated. John was as warm to her as anyone else, and sometimes, when everything lined up, Sherlock felt at peace.
"Right, because you're always taking some girl out."
Sherlock shook his head, "I could leave and you could act like you had no idea. I'll do it anyway."
John sighed, "Sherlock. What are you thinking?”
John sat back on the edge of the bed, "You're gonna have to sit up for this."
question if yall care to answer, do you like shorter or longer chapters (Shorter being 300-500 words, longer being like 700-1000) theres some chapters that are like 10000 words, but i would hate writing that.
"Sherlock, you’re not." He placed a hand on his shoulder, "You're completely brilliant. You don't have to be alone."
Sherlock shrugged, "We'll see."
Molly huffed, "You're starting to worry me. You two only knew each other for what? A couple weeks? And it's not like he was your best friend."
“No, would rather not.”
"I'm not gonna bite, ya know."
John grinned, just fast enough to be noticed, "It fits."
John scoffed, "Not like that. I'm tired."
"Simple. I observe, I guess, I wait for something to stick. I'm usually right."
He went a day without Sherlock, then two, then three, then a whole week had passed and John's chest ached every time he got home. Everything melted together without Sherlock to make the days notable. Everything was bland and boring. Just like John himself.
"Sherlock." John snapped.
Sherlock gave him a moment before responding, “What…What happened?”
"I don't need all of it."
They ran into an alley, panting and half-drowned. John’s jumper was hanging off his form, and he wanted to pull it off but had nothing underneath. Not to mention that it was much better to have some barrier against the wind and rain. Even if it was a soggy one.
“No, we’re just pretending to do it, John.”
But, the weekend was as bad, probably worse, as John couldn't even drown out what had actually happened in his head with voices of his teachers, or smother it in his books. His house was quiet, which only made more room for a mind full of leather jackets and warm flesh. When it wasn't silent enough for John to practically hear the neighbors, he could hear the crashing of dishes or the slamming of doors, from either his sister or dad. He couldn't tell which, the smell of booze came with both.
"Why do I even have to talk to you? You can just read it all."
"That wasn't the plan, Sherlock."
He was moving ever so slightly closer, making John's heart speed up more and more the closer Sherlock got.
"So you came here?"
I could picture his face. The way he looked on that roof. His tremor was gone, that’s for sure. He looked like he was ready to take on the world, like he would go through Hell if it meant I was okay. I wasn’t okay, not now, not with him gone. Christ, he was such an idiot— Thinking I would be okay without him. I had gone and made myself attached and then he left. He stepped right off that building and he was gone.
John brushed his fingers against the car, which had a cherry red paint job, shiny rims, and fender. It was in perfect condition, perfect style.
"Actually, I thought we could do something together."
"Am I?" John's eyes went wide. Sherlock had to try not to laugh.
"Technically is. Mycroft told me to find you."
“If anyone is worth it, it’s you.” John said quietly, not quite into Sherlock’s ear, but an attempt was made, “…Is it Mary?”
Sherlock sighed, “The murderer is about to walk past this alley and I need you to be quiet so we don’t attract attention.” He said in a harsh and firm whisper.
"Christ. Leave."
Sherlock was pretty sure he was sweating. His hair was sticking to his forehead and his arms felt weirdly damp in contact with John's jumper. Probably wasn't the best person to hug.
“Sh.” Sherlock said quickly. John could feel his hot breath brush over his face, the only warmth he had felt since he had walked outside.
"I'm gonna slug you."
Well, except the morphine he convinced the nurse to give him, but that hadn't lasted long once Mycroft had found him.
Why hadn’t Sherlock told him before? He didn’t even know that there was a murder involved. Though, now that he thought about it, it made sense. Sherlock only seemed this focused when it was a decent murder case.
Sherlock sat up properly against the headboard and John could feel a lump in his throat, and he knew that right now Sherlock could crush him. He could demolish everything that  happened between them with the right word. John didn't know if he could survive that.
John frowned.
He floated through the room, like a ghost. His fingers couldn't even touch anything. The only evidence that he was there was the stalled breaths, scattering the dust into the rare rays of sun pushing their way between the curtains.
"It's nice. I like it." He grinned at Sherlock.
The smoke just reminded him of Sherlock. He rolled that thought over again and again in his head. He kinda liked being reminded of Sherlock.
Sherlock took John's mind off of everything he could worry about. John felt nothing but Sherlock, heard nothing but Sherlock, wanted nothing but Sherlock. John didn't care about the consequences if this is what he got in return.
John nodded.
"So, you just want to leave?"
"If you really wanna talk to him that bad, call him." She said before tightening said tourniquet with her teeth.
“We’ll be home soon, John. In fact, if you want, you can go home.”
John chuckled, “That’s not fair.”
Good. Hopefully he'd leave.
Sherlock's hands were under John's vest and-
"Do you always dress like that?" Sherlock asked, flicking ash onto his carpet.
Mary wasn't particularly rude, just... Annoying. She undermined everything and John went along with it even when he knew was she was doing. She made jokes that were more sharp than funny, poked at things that would give her information in the long run. She made Sherlock squirm.
"You like me."
I sat on my bed, head in my hands. John would come up in a few moments, knock lightly on the door, and ask if I was alright. I could let him in, let things settle into what they had been, let him have his normalcy, but I could've also completely shut him out. I could picture him moving out within a month, defeated and guilty. I could see the flat without him. I could see quiet mornings spent alone Mrs Hudson bringing in tea with worried lines marking her face.
John huffed, and crossed his arms. Fine. If he was gonna be like that.
Molly looked over her shoulder, "Hear they're going steady. Is that why you two had a falling out?"
Sherlock led John to the center of the clearing and sat, looking up at John.
hope you enjoyed x
Sherlock laughed, something high and careless, nothing like John had heard from him before. Sherlock's laughs had always been low and quiet, like Sherlock himself. They made John feel warm, but this one grabbed onto his heart and tugged. It made him smile back.
Could he kiss him freely now that they had kissed once? Or did you have to kiss a certain amount of times before that happened? Would they kiss again? Would John even want to look at Sherlock anymore?
“What if I broke up with her?” John asked.
"John, I'm not constantly asking about your home life-"
"If there's any calls for Sherlock Holmes, hang up." He added, walking off to his room.
He tapped his fingers on the arm of John's desk chair.
“That’s…” John smiled, “That’s really cute.”
Felt like a second home.
"Why don't I show you?"
"So, what did you two do?" Molly asked, walking towards the front of the school.
John nodded, "Can I say something?"
you."
When Sherlock spotted him, cigarette dangling from his mouth, motorcycle behind him, his eyes watching John like a wolf on hunting grounds, it twisted something inside him. Maybe it was just because he was the biggest contradiction to blonde, glasses wearing, sweater-vest clad John Watson. Little square from nowheresville, who would never be that tall, and never look that cool under any circumstances.
"Sherlock?"
John kept his gaze, "But everyone deserves to feel like they belong. Like they're worth something." He squeezed Sherlock's hand, "Especially you."
"I think I have to."
"Piss off." She laughed, "And, for your information, they made me stay clean for three days."
John rolled his eyes playfully, getting up from the bed, "I'm not your assistant."
"That's good." He whispered after a moment, before pulling himself up. John could see the entirety of his bare chest when he was sitting up like this, and even a few fading bruises. John sucked in a breath through his teeth.
John nodded, “She doesn’t wanna stay there.” He said quietly.
He looked around the room as he thought of the answer, probably looking for evidence that I was broken, "I can't tell you that."
John felt a shiver run up his spine, despite his whole body feeling like fire even after Sherlock pulled away.
Everything was hitting him so fucking hard, enough so that John’s words were garbled, enough so that he couldn’t focus on anything but the pounding in his chest. He wanted to tell his head to shut up, just for the moment, just long enough to think straight.
"I know."
John opened his mouth, but he couldn't get anything out. So Sherlock really did think he was boring. Of course he did, he had since the start. John could feel a lump in his throat.
"I…" John shook his head, "I don't know."
hope you enjoyed <3
"Because you're worrying me!" John shouted, springing into a sitting position, "Because I happen to care about you, and that means I worry about you!"
"And you said you didn't ask me to be."
Sherlock's eyes blinked open just as another crash echoed through the house.
Sherlock just shrugged.
"I don't, and no it hasn't."
"Why did he want you to wait?" I asked, not focusing on all the other details, the tapping hands, the small movements of his hips and back as he got comfortable in the chair as if he had been for two years instead of 24 hours. It felt like a grating waste of time, trying to ask him questions without shouting or demanding answers, but I navigated anyway.
John stayed quiet for a moment. Sherlock sounded the same, except for a slight twinge of…desperation? Fear? It sounded like he didn't want to lose John, but he also didn't want John to know that.
"You're insane."
“Well…?” Sherlock was still looking down at him, ego the size of his messy hair and as dark as his jacket.
He decided to go upstairs. John seeing him wasn't the worst thing.
"It's not my fault there's not much to begin with."
"Here because I was-"
“That’s typical, yeah.”
John opened his eyes, and Sherlock looked up,   "Jealous?"
Sherlock's hands were on John's sweater, pulling him closer, with more urgency than he had ever expressed before, and John's hands were in Sherlock's hair. John was pushed back, his head just missing the door.
“Mycroft will go ape when he sees his car gone.” Sherlock said.
“You can’t just—“
"…How 'bout a date?"
"Thought he was too precious for that."
"I think I'm just picking up on how you act."
He let out a half-laugh, “I’m considering finding an apartment.”
"I still acted like a jerk."
"I doubt that."
“Is it something I can help with?”
Of course Sherlock could tell, he was the only one John had done anything with.
“Exactly. So, you and Mary?”
"I just want to be it for you." John said so softly he wasn't even sure if he had at all.
“It’s a maybe.”
He felt the door slam, but honestly he couldn't remember Sherlock walking out. The lump in his throat got bigger when he realized he was all alone again.
“You don’t know that!” John snapped, his eyes forceful against Sherlock’s, effectively holding him in place.
John scoffed, "Is that what makes it so cool?"
"Do you want to last?"
“I’m taking you in because you have nowhere else to go.”
"There's nothing to let go of, Sherlock." He pushed him off "It was one goddamn day. A week ago, I might add."
"What do you mean?"
Sherlock shrugged, "I think I'd prefer to be vague."
“Is that what attracts you?”
"I know you don't, which is why you put a guard dog on me," He gestured to John who crossed his arms (very intimidating) "Which is why you act like this. You want to care, but you don't care about me."
“Sherlock—”
Sherlock didn't argue.
"This isn't about realism, Sherlock." He turned his neck to face him. Sherlock faced him in return.
“Not really.”
"Why wouldn't I be?"
I don't remember falling asleep that night. I woke up with the sun in my eyes, sun streaming through the living room windows, invading the kitchen. I woke up to a very quiet flat. I've heard countless people say that they had moments where they didn't realize the person was dead. They went to call their name and it died on their tongue as the remembered. I wish I had that moment, that small moment of everything being normal again. I didn't. I woke up with a weight on my chest, a weight that had been there all of yesterday and I would've been surprised if it ever left.
"C'mon, it's not that friggin' hard, John." He held one between his own fingers, before placing it between his teeth. He held out a lighter to John.
"What would you even do if you knew who it was?"
keep going.”
"Anything. Any hobbies?"
Was it even a relationship? Sherlock had taken him out to dinner, it had to be something. John just wished Sherlock was there. Not that he would have the guts to ask him about all this, but Sherlock would find a way to make him feel better about it without John mentioning it.
John took Sherlock by the chin, not pushing his head up. Sherlock felt a bit more grounded having John’s hand there.
They didn’t waste time before packing. Sherlock stuffed a duffle bag full of plain shirts and cigarettes. He packed up records that John didn’t even know he had.
“Hm?”
"…Not like this." He sucked a mark onto John's stomach.
Sherlock frowned, then kissed the smirk right off John's face. John didn't mind.
John shook his head and waved his hand in front of him, "I don't think I should."
"Real lady-killer that one."
we had a deal. You were gonna tell me about him." She crossed her legs and her red poodle skirt fell over them. In a different light, she would be just another girl John was scared to talk to.
Sherlock nodded.
"So, I can fire you?"
John was tired. He felt it in every fiber of his being, every breath he took, every time he moved. When he looked in the mirror he could see it in his skin, in his veins. He considered staying home just to get an extra hour of sleep. He could probably get away with it.
John raised an eyebrow and looked up at Sherlock.
THIS WAS SO RUSHED IM SO SORRY. I FREAKED OUT A BIT CAUSE I WANTED TO PUT IT OUT TODAY BUT HADN'T WORKED ON IT THAT MUCH. I HOPE ITS OKAY.
"Shoot." Sherlock said, reaching over John for his pack of cigarettes on the bedside table, then sitting up and lighting one.
"I would say so."
“Because he has to. My dad won in court, so he has to.” Sherlock swallowed and stared at the ceiling.
John raised an eyebrow, "Then how are you able to keep it together? Are you just better than all of us?"
“How else was I supposed to get you here?”
Sherlock wanted to argue, but he just pushed his face into John's neck, letting himself fall back into whatever state he was in before John woke him up.
Sherlock turned to look at him, "Do you think they would care if it was daytime?"
It was odd, thinking that. Thinking about what he wanted, when he wanted it, and it being something other than his next hit. He wondered if John was the reason for that. He wondered if that should be obvious.
He shook his head instead. He could've said yes, he could've outed Sherlock right then, but Sherlock had just as much evidence against John as John did him.
Sherlock's lips twitched into a frown.
How did all of this fall apart? How could John let himself hurt Sherlock? It felt like a black hole was in place of his heart, and John didn't know if he was breathing or if the world was forcing air down his throat. He felt numb without Sherlock, lost without Sherlock.
"You look at me like you've finally completed the circuit."
“What is happening?” John asked softly.
Sherlock sighed, "Well, It's not like I want to be home that much either."
John pulled him along into his bedroom, where Sherlock pushed him back onto the bed and threw his jacket over a chair.
"I'll protect you instead."
"I didn't take you for the romantic type." He said, Sherlock's head right by his, staring at nothing, the same as John. Sherlock just shrugged.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I like solving puzzles." He took a breath, "Riddles, logic puzzles, thought experiments."
"I'd say you already got to know me."
"I really wouldn't."
John groaned and shook his head.
"How to be friends with someone?"
fuckinf sorry this took so long, it was the end of the school quarter and i’m actually making an effort this year.
John bowed his head, "Right. Sorry."
"If this didn't matter, I wouldn't still be here, Doll." There was just a hint of a smile in his eyes.
"You like being alone." He started slowly, " Well, you like people thinking you like to be alone. You think you deserve it. That you're too much effort, too much time. Oh, Sherlock."
"I do not!" Sherlock gave him a sharp look.
"No. You're a dick, and a liar, and an addict-"
"Have you ever…Have you ever actually been with a guy?"
"Sherlock? Who was that girl you were with?"
"Last week would also politely disagree."
"That makes it worse."
"Don't." He cut in, "Don't try and be sympathetic. Hell, don't even try to pretend like you know what's going on. I don't need pity, I don't need help, and I most certainly don’t need to talk about it."
"Piss... Off." Sherlock whispered, and John pulled him into a hug.
Sherlock grinned just a bit, "Exactly."
"Except you?"
"Do you know why I said yes to you when you asked me to go on a ride?"
“Jesus H. Christ, Sherlock.” John sighed, letting his fingers slide into Sherlock’s hair and pulling him back in.
"I really did want you to call me." John said softly.
"For me?" I asked, and I tried to not make it sound pathetic, I tried to sound cold, uncaring because of course he didn't affect me. I was untouchable. Of course, that wasn't true. All of my walls and protections were shattered the moment I saw him fall. That image, that memory, it stuck in my brain like a piece of glass, even with him sitting right in front of me. My voice shook with just the thought of the thought of the memory.
“I- I don’t know, John.”
The whole reason you looked for me was for Mycroft, as you so gracefully put it."
Molly was already ahead of John, skipping her way to class, when a shadow pulled him under the staircase. John already knew who it was by the stench of smoke in the air, and the feeling of rough hands on his wrist.
Sherlock chuckled, "Shocked?" He asked, removing a pack of cigarettes from his rolled up sleeve and tapping one out.
"I…I wish I hadn't, John. I don't know what else I can say."
“My hand is on you chest.”
"I watched you fall."
John rolled his eyes and felt a small jolt forward as they sped up.
. Everything John had an opinion about and a lot of things he didn't. Sherlock was easily the most curious person John ever met.
"'M not a stalker."
Sherlock grinned and continued his warpath across John's skin.
He let his eyes linger for a moment before nodding, "Yeah…"
"Don't call me that." John hissed, looking around frantically at anyone passing by. No one was there. Everyone was doing the smart thing and avoiding this chaos.
"Not like that. People'll talk."
"You barely know anything about me."
"I think I want to be," Sherlock got out.
"You want me to go?"
Sherlock nodded and looked around, “Are we gonna be alright?”
"Hm…Nothing. I got nothing."
"Why's that?"
Sherlock didn't say anything for a moment, trying to collect his voice, "...I-" He blurted it out before he could convince himself otherwise, "You didn't have to do this. Come look for me." His voice was shaking despite how hard he was trying to steady it.
He leaned in close, clinging to Sherlock’s arm, “Hey, Sherlock?”
There was a thick pause between them, filled with the heartbeat of the city.
"I don't think you do."
"I doubt you will," John said, taking Sherlock's lighter.
All his old spots, hideouts, people, all of them were the same. It's not like he expected England to fall while he was away, but
John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him. He pretended he couldn't. He felt a little nauseous, a little dizzy, and a little giddy, all rolled into one. He still had the cigarette in his hand but didn't plan on taking another drag.
John glared right back, "You're dramatic."
“You will. And that’s when you’ll regret being around me.”
He didn’t. Not surprising, even if the voice in the back of his head was telling him otherwise. John took his hand and tugged him closer, but he definitely did not look off-put, or anything even close.
"Huh, almost like I would run in the same circles as them."
Sherlock bit his lip, "You're not boring." His knuckles were white by this point, "And you're not just a way to keep occupied. I don't know why I said that. Okay, I do know why, I was stressed and worried." He sighed heavily, "I didn't mean to do that."
"Hey, you heard about the Taff's boy?"
He leaned down, right next to John's ear, "Then you have me to gain."
"We don't have to be anything."
"Call me. Okay?"
“And what occasion is that?”
John tugged off his shoes and put them neatly by the bed, carefully taking his coat off as well. Sherlock took his hand, the meaning of the contact slipping his mind, as he pulled John closer and into the bed.
John chuckled a bit, "At first, yeah, but I didn't really notice after a while."
Molly said that some of them swore that they had robbed a bank together.
"Right. He had a bird, didn't he?"
"No." He glared down at John, "I'm not gonna do it. I was tired and I wasn't even sure why I said anything."
It wasn't that Sherlock wanted John, (or that he needed him) but it was nice to know... What? That John wasn’t someone else’s? John was his? Because he wasn't. They'd known each other for maybe a few days, and in that Sherlock had gotten him in trouble, tricked him, gotten high on his watch, and made him stay the night at a cheap hotel. He wasn’t even sure why John kept putting up with him.
He dug around the sheets for his boxers, before taking the shirt Sherlock has most certainly gotten from the ground. John rolled his eyes again, but took it, just a bit glad that it smelled like smoke like the rest of Sherlock.
"Or you get to figure me out, whichever."
"Imagination." He said in a mockingly wispy tone.
“I know.” He paused, “I think I‘ve not talked about him for long enough.”
hope you enjoyed. x
"You're assuming."
dramatic." He sighed and put the cigarette in his mouth.
"No. Listen-"
I closed my eyes tight, pictured John out of my life, and the void in my chest only grew wider. I balled my fists against my thighs, took a long breath, opened my eyes, and stood, moving towards the bedroom door.
“Come here.” Sherlock said, pulling the covers back.
"I would like- friends. We can be friends."
By the time Molly stopped asking questions the bell had rung, leaving them to run off to their class with John looking over his shoulder the whole way there.
. John really was an idiot.
Sherlock just barely opened his eyes, but closed the the moment he saw Mycroft.
"Sherlock," was the first word he said. Everything felt like it was back in full colour. I think I fell over again because I ended up in his arms. He sat me in a chair, and I couldn't feel my legs, and I tried to think of the last time one person had me so fucked, but I couldn't. I couldn't think. I already couldn't think when he was gone, and now he wasn't.
"What was it even like? Living with him?"
“Partly.”
John didn't know whether to smile or look impressed, so he did both, "What else?"
"That's not what I said."
"There's nothing you can do about it anyway, John."
John didn't know if he should feel hurt or responsible.
Her eyes were wide and pleading. John couldn’t find it in his heart to say no, and he couldn't help but think the idea of getting one up on Sherlock was tempting.
"I'm not disagreeing, I just find it funny that
"Will you?" John kicked his feet up on the side of Sherlock's bed, "'S this okay?"
Sherlock tugged on his arm, not to pull him closer, just to remind him how he was close.
"Don't tempt me."
"I kinda did-"
John hummed, “Good?”
Sherlock looked down "Well, you know about my brother."
It was raining and John was stuck with Sherlock. On a case. Why did he agree to this? His shoes were so soaked that he could feel his socks getting damp, and his jumper was forever ruined. Mrs. Hudson would be furious about both of them dripping water onto her carpets.
He dialed Sherlock's number and didn't allow himself to think about anything but the numbers. Not what they meant, not who they were calling, not anything. He held the receiver to his cheek and swallowed his fear and doubt.
John was finding him again.
"I would."
John sighed, "Why do you care?"
last."
"Are you gonna keep asking that?"
"Are you writing a book?" He spat, as his head spun towards John.
He had walked this path a million times before, yet the sidewalk felt odd under his feet. He tested the door.
He wasn’t surprised John was being kind, no, he was more surprised by his own acceptance of the actions. Years spent believing he didn’t deserve it was still there just… quieter. It was all so much quieter around John.
with guys. You don't do anything with guys other than be friendly.
"Made coffee." John said, carefully, like the wrong words could set off a bomb.
"I would rather like an ice lolly. Do you think I could get one?"
Sherlock was saying something in disbelief. Probably about the choices of the main character by the way his emotions were playing out across his face.
(also do not fret, there will be some miscommunication angst later on, bit i wanted the foundation of their relationship to be open.)
He looked down, took a breath, then leaned in. He thought of every moment that had led to this one, every question Sherlock had asked, every time John had tried to push him away, and every time he just wanted him closer, but didn't know how to ask.
"In a way, yes.”
Who knows?
"I assume that's not a good thing?" John asked.
"So are you." John said defensively.
He looked back to Sherlock, whose face was pure stone. His jaw was set and his eyes were closed. He didn't look upset or mad, he just looked neutral. John wanted to ask him why he didn't like talking about it, but he also didn't want to Sherlock to put his guard up any more.
"Shouldn't you buy me dinner first?"
Sherlock shook his head, “You’ll realize it at some point and blame me for not telling you.”
John paused, "Why do you want to know?"
"You seem to do a decent job at distancing yourself anyway. Having guards on me, cameras on me, but never getting your hands dirty. Wouldn't it be easier if you gave up altogether?"
Sherlock stared up at the ceiling, then flicked his eyes to John.
"I don't think you're gonna like it."
John sighed, "…Who are those bruises from?"
"Let's…" He swallowed, "Let's run away."
“Why does he let you see your dad in the first place?”
“I know.”
Sherlock nodded again, tilting his own head up so he could bury his nose in John’s neck. He took a small breath, “Mycroft likes to pin all of my… Demons, on-“ Sherlock shook his head, realizing he didn’t want to say his name.
"You didn't answer my call."
That made Sherlock raise his eyebrows, "Oh? Then, are you attracted to me, John?"
He lifted the receiver and held it tightly in the air letting the first few numbers spin around. He shook his head and slammed it back down.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his head drop back down. Too much energy trying to stay focused.
"Sherlock. C'mon. Get up."
"From what? Public record?"
"Hello?"
It turns out hell is on the back of a motorcycle at 79 miles-per-hour where John could feel the wind on his face and Sherlock’s body beneath him. It turns out hell is black curls and agitated gravel, and it turns out John doesn’t mind. John doesn’t mind having to grip Sherlock’s waist for dear life, or not knowing where he’s going or what he’s leaving behind, and it turns out that John likes more of this than he thought he would.
"Wh-" John stuttered.
?” Sherlock snapped back, “One kiss and you think we’re fucking soulmates?”
John nodded, "As far as I know, but even if someone is here, they won't be for long."
Did Mary know the reason Sherlock was tagging behind John? Did she care either way? Would she blame Sherlock?
Sherlock looked him up and down.
He never would understand this person.
"Isn't. You could've made an excuse."
"What do you want it to be?"
Sherlock huffed, staring forward, "I do not like you."
"You're the one who wanted me to prove this to you."
John paused. He looked tired, bags under his eyes and his twitchy fingers. He looked tired. I wanted to take him into my room and hold him so tight, tight enough to keep all of his pieces together because it looked like he was about to fall apart. At the same time, I wanted to kick him out, tell him to go get a hotel and piss off. I suppose I found balance in doing neither.
." He rolled his eyes.
“You’re always curious.”
These things never worked out.
"Thank you for your input. Can you leave now, so I can get back to my current life of Jell-o and day time television?"
Sherlock was smiling wide, trying to keep up with John, but soon giving up in favor of letting him do what he wanted. John eventually got to Sherlock's neck, trying to mark him the way he did to John, but not really knowing if he was doing it right.
I could've laughed, "I know that. You're too soft for that."
"You're not clever, you know." He straightened his shoulders, taking a long sniff, "I'm placing a guard on you. To prevent any more... Accidents." His lip curled at the last word. He might think of Sherlock as something lesser, but he surely thought highly of himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Anyone home?" John asked, trying to sound casual.
His head spun towards John, then back to the road.
Sherlock shrugged, “Breakfast and more in bed.”
John shook his head, and scooted a bit closer, "Are you able to do that with everyone?"
Sherlock had already closed his eyes, "Are we what?"
"Well, if we might not last, why not break up now?"
John swallowed, "…Stay a bit more."
"So, she wasn't anyone important was she?"
Sherlock told John about the records all the way to John’s house. He had four of them exactly, and honestly, John didn’t even know what they were, he just knew that Sherlock liked talking about them, and he liked listening.
John sighed and looked back to Molly, "Sorry."
He rubbed his hands on his thighs and looked at the ground, "I don't know…"
He tugged on Sherlock's arm again. John pulled him back onto the bed then laid his head on Sherlock's chest.
His footsteps were quiet, soft. He knew John probably wasn't as heavy a sleeper as he appeared, so he made sure to be as silent as possible.
"As long as you didn't get yourself killed I'll live."
“I would call that special. Not everyone could be there.”
i made myself cry twice writing this thanks.
All the facts Sherlock read hit him like bricks. Army, single, unarmed, definitely taking the job for the money, obviously had no clue who Sherlock was.
"Sherlock, I'm not-"
Sherlock took one more drag, then launched into an explanation so fast it made John's head spin, "You're interested in med school, most likely to become an army doctor, or something similar. You don't get along well with your sister, which is why she hasn't been here, or at least, why I haven't seen her. I assume it's because she goes out late at night, and you convince yourself that you're just worried about her, but really, you want to be doing the same thing." The smoke was coming out with his words, almost just as fast, "You want to be in bars, at clubs, you wish you could forget just as easily as that. You're dad certainly isn't around much, and all the pictures of your mother are old, too old. She either left or died.
“But Sh-”
"No." Sherlock said quietly, "You could've given up. You could've forced me to go back right away. You didn't have to do this."
Sherlock got off the motorcycle and held out his hand for John. John could've left right now. He could've said sorry, and asked Sherlock to take him back. Instead he breathed in and took Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock didn’t want to live with them. Maybe he could convince John to live somewhere else with him. Maybe he could convince Mary to leave. Every day he was here he could feel the pit in his stomach growing.
Small pause.
"Well, obviously, since I met you." He grinned.
Sherlock launched towards him and crashed into his lips. John's head hit the door, but his whole existence was singled down to Sherlock.
John closed his eyes, “I still think about it. All the time. I feel like the back of my eyelids are stained red.”
.) to letting John do this (
"What voice?"
"Why would that stop me from doing it?"
"It's not…Not here, not now." He tugged a hand through his hair, "Oh my god, Sherlock."
"Not in your
Sherlock sniffed, tears hot on his face which he had buried into the covers. He slowly looked up at John and shook his head.
"I swear to god, Sherlock. You're not leaving."
“Your clothes are normal.”
John tried not to sputter, "I never said I wasn't attracted to you." He shook his head slightly.
John shook his head, waving his hands, "No, no. It's fine. You sure you're alright with-"
“Hm. That’s not a bad idea.”
Sherlock shook his head, “You can, John."
"You do know I can use force right?"
"No, apparently you're my friend."
John felt like
Sherlock pushes his face into John’s chest. He’d done this before, felt this before. Finn was right, if he didn’t move now he wouldn’t ever get anywhere.
"You know what I mean."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Or text. Alright."
He sighed, "I mean…I like the idea of going somewhere with you, of this-whatever it is-mattering."
"I'm not going to fall apart, Sherlock."
John could see him shrug, "You would think so, but apparently, I'm not worth anyone's time."
"And why's that?"
“I didn’t think it would be like this.”
John laughed, and looked down, "I don't mind it."
“And make me coffee.”
"Perfectly okay being this close."
"Do you want to come inside?" Sherlock asked, out of breath and clinging onto John's shirt.
"Hey, Sherlock?"
"I won't bite. Besides, it's easier to stay here." Sherlock looked at him for a moment, "I could always sleep on the floor-"
John was in front of him, grabbing the sides of his face and looking for life. Sherlock wondered if he had any left.
John placed a firm kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head without hesitation, “I doubt you will.”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
John shook his head, "Barely."
“What, Sherl-” He arm was tugged.
“Are you two… alright?”
Sherlock was over the whole day, even when John's dad came home only to slam his way through the house, despite John insisting that he leave at that point. During Sherlock's time there, two things became crystal clear in John's head:
"That's 'cause you're a party pooper."
"Sometimes?" John asked
He couldn't stop thinking about John all the way there.
Or maybe he just finally knew how to say it.
"I don't. Say okay."
Sure, he felt like he was being pulled from the inside out, but he could deal with that. He could pretend it was something else. School stress, or home life. He could focus on the feeling rather than why it was there.
"A red one, with polka dots."
Sherlock’s face was centimeters away from John’s, their breaths mingling and making stars in the negative space. It was only a matter of time until they crashed together, so why couldn’t it be now?
"Mind if we make a stop?" Sherlock asked, opening and closing his hand, feeling the wind glide through his fingers.
All by a guy. A man. A hard body and flat chest, little curves and
"With the 'light behind my eyes' or something."
Sherlock shook his head.
“I mean… I think so. She’s- I could still…”
Sherlock stared at him for a long moment. What was his motive? What did he want from him?
"You're being dramatic."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "Don't you have to report back to Mycroft or something?"
John kissed his shoulder, "Did you tell anyone?"
. James Dean aftermath. Leather and motorcycles. Whispered breaths of girls in the hallways. On the tip of every tongue, and now on John’s. Actually on John's. Not just a fantasy, but a memory.
"I know."
"I still find it weird to keep them in your sleeves. Do they not fall out?"
They made it through the door and John went to lead Sherlock to his room. When he had stayed here before he had been shown to a guest room, so being shown right to the master bedroom felt like something almost taboo.
"How do you know I won't abuse this?"
It made John furious. He wished he could wipe that goddamn smirk off his face without getting his own bashed in in the process.
John's voice came out small then, "What do you mean?"
Sherlock raised his arm and pointed up, "What's that one?"
John frowned, "So we should just put up with this instead?"
"I think…" He looked up at John's ceiling, "I think I test people's patience-" John snorted. Sherlock glared at him, "I think people would much rather choose something easier." He sat back on the bed.
