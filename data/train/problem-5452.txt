Tony trails off, eyes darting around at the few students that might be in hearing range. Steve grabs his hand and leads him towards his dorm.
Steve hurries as best he can, but his legs are trembling now and all he can think about is the last time he heard Tony pee when he was this desperate, he lost control, and he doesn’t want to do that again. So, he unlocks his door and doesn’t follow Tony inside when he rushes in.
“Hey, let’s take a break, hm?” Tony whispers in his ear. Steve’s definitely buzzed, or high on the affection Tony is giving him, or something, because the feel of Tony’s lips against his ear is driving him crazy. He barely nods, and then Tony is tugging him by his wrist, leading him away from their circle of friends and back to their bedroom.
It’s silent in Steve’s dorm. Tony has a momentary pang of mixed arousal and sympathy for Steve, guessing he’s probably standing in front of the toilet and dying to go but unable to do so. Tony keeps as silent as possible, save for his pulse beating like a drum in his ears, and his labored breathing that he tries like hell to keep silent. He prays that Steve can’t hear him. Not only would that be fucking embarrassing, but then he would be exacerbating Steve’s problem, and that would just make him a terrible boyfriend, kink or no kink.
He knows that Tony can tell he has to pee. He’s not being very covert about it anymore, now that it’s just them. He just wants to get home and to the toilet as quickly as possible. But he’s grateful that Tony doesn’t try to comment on it.
Tony hums around him, and Steve feels the bed shaking with a rhythm, and realizes with a slight jolt that Tony is humping the bed. Tony is... is
Tony’s flushed, mouth red and wet, eyes a little glassy. He looks thoroughly turned on, and Steve didn’t even
“Shit, Tony,” Bucky curses, obviously startled. Tony can’t see Steve’s face directly, but he can tell even from his limited view of the side of his cheek that he’s grinning as wide as he can.
“Really good, huh?” Tony repeats, eyes dark with intent. His fingers drag lightly across Steve’s hips, dancing across the bump of his bladder. But he doesn’t say anything. “Let’s go watch them play the game.”
Tony fumbles a hand towards his bedside table, clumsily opening the top drawer and pulling out a bottle of generic lubricant. Steve takes it with gentle hands and gives what he hopes is a reassuring smile, because Tony is obviously still nervous about asking for this.
“What are you doing?” Tony asks, already half inside the bathroom, shifting his weight desperately. “What’s wrong?”
“Steve, I’m so proud of you!” Bucky tackles him in a bear hug, and Tony glances back at the noise and catches Steve’s eye. He winks, and Steve blushes. “Did you tell your therapist?”
Tony just looks at him. He’s standing in Steve’s tiny bedroom; arms crossed, hair sticking up, and still shirtless from the night before. He’s got a purple hickey on his right collarbone, and a couple of light, finger-shaped bruises on his left hip from where Steve held on just a little too tight. Steve is utterly, irrevocably in love with him.
Steve quickly rushes into the bathroom to clean off his hand before positioning himself in front of the toilet. He’s able to go in record time, maybe because of the lingering tipsiness or the leftover afterglow from his orgasm, he’s not sure. He’s finally empty, though, just as Tony slides back into his room with a pink toothbrush.
And, sometimes, he thinks about himself pissing. He’s not sure he’ll find it particularly hot, as he hasn’t ever found it sexy before, but he decides to try it out anyway since he loves the look on Steve so much. He doesn’t really plan anything, he just happens to have a full bladder at the end of class one day and decides not to stop at the bathroom before heading to the lab. He knows himself, and he knows that he’ll get sucked into the engineering soon enough and forget about his need.
because he definitely wasn’t sharing it with Tony earlier. He’s also biting his lip and furrowing his brow, but that might be from the 15th century art he’s studying, Tony’s not entirely sure. He’d need more data to draw any conclusive evidence.
“Told who, what?” Bucky grumbles, busy looking in his bag for something. He’s working on an assignment that was due a week ago.
“Sorry, not all of us have Daddy’s money to fall back on,” Nat snarks, but she has a teasing grin playing at the corners of her mouth. “Gas money gets expensive, Mr. Stark.”
Steve jumps out of the bed frantically and has to twist his legs over and squeeze to hold his piss in as gravity shoves down on his bloated bladder. As soon as he can move again, he frantically pats the spot he’d been laying in, feeling carefully for any wetness on the bed.
“Ma,” Steve scolds as he breaks away from Tony to jog up the stairs and wrap his mother in a hug. “Put some real shoes on, you’re going to freeze.”
Steve feels a little flutter in his chest at the sight of Tony so soft and pliant in his arms. “C’mon, we can get up and wash our hands and get ready for bed.”
Maybe he’ll just wait for Steve to get desperate enough to ask him to leave. He has to ask eventually, right? Tony can make him wait until then. And, finally, it happens.
Steve regrets his choice as soon as he steps into Tony’s dorm room, with the heaviness in his lower abdomen, but he ignores all that. Instead, he focuses on Tony, who has pounced on him. They haven’t seen each other in a few days, and they’re both healthy, young men. Which means as soon as they’re alone, they jump at the chance for sex. Tony’s all over him the second they’re in the room, and they fall onto the bed together, furiously making out.
The walk there is normally quick, but it feels like forever to Steve this time. Tony keeps up with chatter about his latest project, and Steve hums and nods where appropriate while trying desperately to think of a way he could get a moment alone in his room so he could piss. His bladder keeps making unhelpful nudges that make Steve squeeze his thighs together, unsure when he’ll get the relief it’s begging for.
Only a second later it hits him what an idiot he is, because he can’t spend the entire night with his bladder like this, and there’s absolutely no way he’d be able to get it up right now. Even though his dick valiantly tries with the thought of Tony naked in his bed, because he very much does want to have sex with his boyfriend.
It’s different, knowing Tony is watching and enjoying him being desperate to pee. And while Steve doesn’t exactly get desperate on purpose, he doesn’t exactly restrain himself from guzzling down fluids all day until his bladder is rock hard under his jeans. There’s something exciting about the idea of Tony’s eyes on him, watching his every shift and squirm, waiting for him to-
“Alright,” Tony allows. “But, when you inevitably struggle and need my help, don’t you dare hesitate to ask me, got it?”
“Just, trust me? I know you’re uncomfortable,” Tony murmurs, “But you do like when I’m touching your dick, right?”
“I mean, I’ve always been embarrassed at the thought of anyone seeing me need to pee, seeing me pee at all. But knowing you, uh, you like it...” Steve swallows. “You find it... attractive? Really?”
“No worries,” Steve says. His hard on has wilted by now, even after watching Tony come, because he'd just come a few hours earlier and his body has realized it's three in the morning and he shouldn't be awake. “Babe, I was trying to get you to come as fast as possible. I want to get back to bed, I’m exhausted.”
“Sometimes, I just have bad days. And I can’t... I can’t release,” Steve admits, voice wrecked now. Tony can see why he had the emotionless mask on, earlier, because now emotion is practically pouring out of Steve and it’s all pain and embarrassment and anger. “I have to go so bad, Tony.”
But Steve has never tried to get off while his bladder was full. He’s quickly realizing that he doesn’t know if he’s going to come or pee first, and it feels like both are about to happen. Except he really doesn’t want to wet the bed, because they still have to sleep in it tonight, so he gently pushes Tony off of him.
He trails off, praying Tony just understands as he awkwardly gestures at the bathroom, but even a genius like Tony needs a better explanation than that. He chances a glance at Tony’s face, but he just looks concerned and confused, not disgusted like Steve thought.
Finally, after what seems like an eternity, Tony feels a small spurt of liquid run down his thigh that’s just a touch warmer than the water from the shower. They’re pressed so closely together in the tiny space that there’s no way Tony wouldn’t have felt it. Steve moans lowly after the fact, which pretty much proves Tony’s hypothesis that Steve just peed down his leg. He feels a touch of arousal pass through him at the feeling, which is an interesting thought but he’ll have to explore that later. Because it was only a quick spurt, which means Steve is still holding a lot and is still desperate to let go.
Steve nods, scrambling down to unbutton Tony’s jeans. He takes them all the way off, and then Tony is laying naked on his bed, and Steve thinks he’s never looked better. His hands are shaking, he’s never had anyone’s cock in his mouth before, but he’s much more excited than nervous. He starts slow, taking a little bit of Tony into his mouth. But then Tony makes this desperate noise, and his hands fly to Steve’s hair, so Steve takes as much as Tony’s dick into his mouth as he can. And Tony’s not small or anything, but Steve must have a big mouth, or no gag reflex, or he’s got a natural talent for sucking cock, because he’s got all of Tony in his mouth. Tony keens, thrusting his hips slightly so that the head of his dick bumps Steve’s throat.
“Hey, you back yet?” Steve asks, luckily sounding too distracted to notice the way Tony is practically moaning in relief.
Eventually, they have to wrap it up when the lab closes, and Bucky and Sam head back to their dorm. Tony follows Steve back to his dorm, not saying a word about the fact that Steve clearly needs to pee, and soon.
Steve laughs shakily and nods as Tony continues moving, but it’s quickly choked back when Tony slides a hand between them to palm Steve through his jeans. At Steve’s nod, Tony unbuttons and unzips the jeans, and slides down the underwear to get a hand around Steve’s bare cock. The feeling of Tony’s hand on him is almost too much. Steve has to close his eyes for a moment.
“You’re good at that too, for me,” Steve says. “I’ve never given a blowjob. But I can’t stop thinking about giving you one. I want to drive you crazy.”
“Steve?” Tony asks, and Steve freezes. Tony blinks up at him, mouth stretched wide around a yawn. “What’s goin’ on?”
After a few rounds, Steve is shifting from foot to foot, jostling himself and Tony. He’s long since finished his beer, and he can feel it adding to the strain in his bladder. He’s chewing his lip, debating on going to try to use the bathroom, considering the back of the house is pretty quiet and they’re making plenty of noise out here. But then Tony is there, dragging a hand up his side.
“Oh, because you and Nat aren’t going back to her room to get it on?” Tony snarks right back. “Sure.”
They all walk together the rest of the way; Bucky lives a few houses down from Steve on the same street. Steve’s mom had wanted to meet them at the station, but he’d asked her not to. He had an inkling Tony would be nervous, and he was right.
Their friends try to joking lag behind in order to make Tony wait longer, but Steve and Tony just end up in the front of the group as it splits, each of them heading back to their own dorms. Steve sees Tony biting his lip as he shifts his weight, obviously contemplating following Steve back to his dorm, which is much closer, or going back to his own dorm, which is across campus.
“Steve? Pal?” Bucky’s worried tone brings Steve out of his reverie. They’ve all just finished dinner, and they’re splitting up again now. Natasha and Pepper snuck out to do some shopping, Peter, Bruce, Sam and Rhodey are on the couch setting up a video game, Thor and Loki went back to their room to make out, Tony is across the room talking to Clint, and Steve and Bucky are standing together. “You okay?”
“That must be great,” Tony sighs wistfully, clearly thinking about his own single in a suite with a shared bathroom. “My suite mate has long hair and leaves it on the shower walls.”
Helplessly, Steve laughs a little. He feels like he might be going crazy, so many conflicting emotions going on. He’s uncomfortable, and panicking, and
“Okay. Okay, let’s get you into the shower, then,” Tony says. He doesn’t like the idea of this slow release, but it’s better than nothing. Steve is in pain, and he won’t stand for that.
Tony watches him carefully for a moment, looking hesitant, before he says, “Do you want me to go get breakfast?”
What he doesn’t love so much is the fullness in his bladder, but he’s going to continue ignoring that until tomorrow morning. Or, at least, until he doesn’t have his boyfriend’s cock in his mouth.
“Yeah, I’ve been holding it for, what, 19 hours now?” Steve laughs, but it’s painfully self-deprecating. “I have to go so bad.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony mumbles, blinking sleepily at Steve. “Fuck, that was so good. I think you broke my brain.”
Even through the mask, Steve can see the hurt and pain Tony is feeling. He wants so badly for his father to be proud of him, but Howard will never see past his own jealousy. Steve just wishes Tony could understand that, one day.
“I usually... sit in the shower and try to... y’know. I can’t... I can’t just go. So it releases in small amounts until I’m empty,” Steve says. Tony’s heart breaks more.
They curl up in bed together afterwards, and Steve finds it’s perfect, even with his little interruption. Tony still snuggles into his chest, and Steve still gets to see his expression go soft with sleep. So it all turns out okay in the end.
“God, Tony, fuck,” Steve curses, biting his lower lip as he gets closer and closer to falling over the edge. “I’m gonna - I’m gonna-“
“Oh,” Tony says dumbly. And then he presses forward to kiss Steve, and Steve can’t help hitching his hips against Tony. “I can work with that.”
he has a full bladder, too. Even if he didn’t know that Steve can’t use public bathrooms, Tony can tell by the way Steve is standing: he’s holding his body stiff, not moving or shifting weight at all, thighs tense and pressed together.
Tony wrinkles his nose. “Fuck, I hope not. Look, I see campus! Hurry up guys, or I promise I will be the first case of someone dying from a bursting bladder.”
“Uhhh,” Tony hesitates, and Steve sees a flush come across his cheeks as, for the first time that night, he’s actually embarrassed by his situation. Steve feels sympathetic as his own bladder squeezes in desperation.
dating and Steve isn’t about to ruin that by admitting he’s a freak who can’t pee in public. Or sometimes when anyone else is home. Or occasionally if the neighbors are being especially loud.
He watches as Steve’s pupils dilate, a flush rise over his cheeks, his cock gets harder in his pants. And he takes all that for a yes even before Steve nods enthusiastically. He pulls Steve out without much fanfare and goes to town, taking as much as Steve’s dick into his mouth as he can manage. His boyfriend is big, though, so he uses one hand to stroke the rest and the other to roll his balls between his fingers.
The light shone inches away from a face that belonged to Clint Barton. And from the soft glow of the gauntlet, Tony could see that there was an arrow about four inches in front of his face. The two men stood there only staring at eachother before Clint lowered the bow and arrow.
“Oh god. Steve,” Tony stammered, it was obvious he was drunk. “I didn’t think you would actually come. I mean, I always told myself you would show up one day. I thought maybe I had imagined it or something,” Tony said, pushing his face into Steve’s chest as tears began to stain his shirt.
“You know, I was supposed to keep your from taking the Tesseract...or track you down and bring you back to your original timeline, keep the Tesseract from leaving earth at the moment you disappeared with it.” Steve laughed, thinking how ironic it was that Loki had happened upon him. He always thought he would have to spend months looking form him, yet here he was.
“This is you...isn’t it?” Peter said as he looked between the plush and Steve. “Mr. America, right?” Peter asked, the stress easing from his voice.
“It’s okay Peter. You’re busy. So am I…just promise you’ll be here for New Years, Okay?” He asked, looking over at Peter and smiling.
Tony looked over at Peter who was grinning back at him. His focus then went over to Pepper and then his gaze landed on Steve. There was absolutely no way he was going to let Steve watch Peter. It’s not like he didn’t think Steve was capable. He just had his own issues to work out with the man before-
“He- He tried to kill me,” Tony then blurted out. His head tilted up and he gave the most broken look Steve had ever seen. “He tried to kill me Steve. He was going to. He shoved that god damned shield into my reactor. And if I would have pushed any harder, he would have done it,” Tony cried.
As they walked through the front doors, the first thing that Tony noticed was the quiet voices coming from the room down the hall.  The two approached as as Tony got closer he noticed that it was Bailey’s room. The door was slightly open and the  lights were dimmed. On further inspection, Tony saw that there were four other people in the room, spread out over chairs that were turned into makeshift beds. Tony figured they were Bailey’s family, and he was about to just walk on and leave them alone, but the girl locked eyes with Tony and a wide smile crossed her face.
“Only if you want me to,” Pepper said with a kind smile. -- And that was how the two ended up walking towards the medical wing.
“Alright then. Let’s go get breakfast, huh?” Tony said as he dried his hands and ushered Peter out of the bathroom. He would deal with the diaper in the trash later.
“Because,” Sam suddenly shouted. “Clint and I just got out of that prison. We are not going back, especially when Clint has his family. I’m sorry but if you call Stark, Clint and I will be gone by the time he gets here.” Sam suddenly finished yelling, only to have the sound of a baby crying from the other side of the closed door. Shit, they had woken a kid up. “You can deal with this on your own,” he hissed.
It was a small location in the Olympic Peninsula area of Washington state. Once they arrived the three men spent most of the day navigating through the forest until they came upon a building that was no bigger than a small house.
“You got good form Steve, but your younger self was getting the best of you there. You slowing up in your old age?” Tony asked with a giggle.
The reunion had been emotional as Peggy cried, pulling Steve into her home. They had hugged each other,they cried, they talked and Steve had finally got to have his dance with Peggy. Everything was perfect.
“Who…” Pepper began as she looked at the picture before turning her head to look down at Tony. She paused for a moment, the wheels turning in her head before she spoke again. “Were they in the place? The Lab?”
“N-Nothing,” Peter lied as he wiped some tears away. “I-I’m just sick,” he said…which was true. “And I uh…I just missed you.” Peter admitted. They had seen each other three weeks ago, with some phone calls and texting in-between. But suddenly it seemed like it had been centuries. “I was also in the neighborhood,” Peter said, holding up his sack that contained the ham.  “I was on a quest to get ham,” Peter said, laughing slightly.
“Well, that’s what they say,” Tony said with a shrug. “Guess I won’t find out till I seem him,” Tony said as his eyes wandered over to the staircase. “Is Sam down there with Rogers?” he then asked.
? Peter felt empty, he was sure Pops and Dad felt empty. Wasn’t this a feeling that newly divorced family’s felt? This wasn’t new for Peter. So why did he feel so terrible? Was it because when he was younger his parents felt they had to make things up to him by making Christmas feel special? Didn’t they know that even though Peter was older, he still desperately wanted to feel like a kid again? Or was he just getting older? Was this what Christmas was like for all adults? If it was, Peter never wanted to get older.
“Tony?” the small voice said, and Tony instantly turned his head to see Peter looking up at him from the bed. He hadn’t moved, or even shifted, but his eyes were definitely open.
“Oh, god,” Steve groans. His head falls to Tony’s shoulder; he can’t even hold it up anymore, like the rest of his body. “I’m peeing. I’m peeing on your leg.”
“Oh, right, sorry!” Ma laughs a little. “I’m just excited to have you home, I suppose. The house gets lonely.”
“Steve,” Tony says gently. “These things take time. And you might never feel that level of comfortable around anyone, let alone me, I know that. I’m not expecting you to wake up one day and be fine pissing in front of me, okay?”
Tony gasps, body going tight and taut. But then, a second later, he melts against the shower wall, hips making tiny thrusting movements into Steve’s stream. It’s the hottest thing Steve has ever seen. He has to force the piss out of him, feeling his dick grow hard again in his hand.
Each step jolts Steve’s bladder. He’s really getting desperate now, and he’s worried he’s not going to be able to hold it. Tony and Bucky are chatting as they walk, but Steve is mostly focusing on holding it together long enough to get home.
Tony leans in and starts kissing him, but after awhile seems to sense Steve’s discomfort, and pulls back to talk instead. He rambles about a new machine he’s planning on building, and Steve is trying to follow along because he loves hearing what Tony’s working on, but he
“You’re not going to die,” Bruce says. “Your body would force you to release before your bladder explodes. The worst that could happen is a UTI.”
Steve flushes directly after saying that, thinking about Tony coming over anytime, getting naked in Steve’s tiny bathroom, just a few feet away.
Steve’s chest tightens at the sight; he knows all the signs of Tony going through something. And this means something big. And he has a feeling he knows what it’s about, too, considering the timing.
They get back to Steve’s dorm and they’re already making out before the door closes behind them. They’re a little tipsy from the few beers they’d had at Tony’s friend’s party. Steve backs them up until he feels the bed behind his legs, sitting back onto it and dragging Tony with him. Tony hops right on his lap without hesitation, pushing Steve back until Steve’s laying down with his legs still dangling off the edge of the bed and Tony’s straddling his waist. From there, the make out gets even more heated. Steve breaks away from Tony to latch his mouth on his boyfriend’s neck instead, and Tony lets out a low moan and rocks his hips in response. His ass is positioned deliciously on top of Steve’s crotch, and Steve is straining in his jeans already, desperate for more touch. His hands skitter off of Tony’s shoulders and down towards his hips and finally to his ass, squeezing and delighting in the gasp Tony makes.
“Sorry, I’m sorry, you don’t have to,” Tony says, cheeks red. “I know some people don’t like it, find it disgusting, whatever.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve says faux-innocently. “If you’d let me, I’d go lower with my mouth, too. What about that, Tony? Would you want that? How do you feel about my mouth on your ass?”
“Or, if you can’t say you need to go, I could just leave for a little bit every time I stay over, in the future. If you still want me to stay over. Like, maybe a walk before bed, and I can grab breakfast and coffee in the morning,” Tony suggests. Steve scans him, but he seems earnest, no jokes being played here.
Steve wants to laugh at Tony’s vehemence, but his bladder agrees. It definitely doesn’t want to wait.
“Mmm, that feels good, hm? Now I want you to take one hand and cup yourself through your pants,” Tony instructs, already following his own order, eyes falling shut.
It’s like a bucket of ice water over Steve’s head. He’s enjoying teasing Tony, getting desperate for him, so much so that he forgot other people would be able to tell, too. His anxiety creeps back in, reminding him that he is very full and this is not a place with a bathroom he feels comfortable using.
He trails off, unable to say it out loud, but Tony sits up straight, eyebrows climbing his forehead. He nods frantically, then tilts his head in thought.
“Alright,” Tony says. “Paruresis. Makes sense, I’ve never seen you use the bathroom in public. But then why’d you invite me over?”
As soon as the door is shut behind them, Tony has Steve up against it. Usually it’s the other way around, with Steve holding Tony against the door or the wall or wherever, but Steve is seriously not complaining. He’s been hard in his jeans for at least the past two hours, and he’d really like to do something about it.
Even as he says it, he realizes it’s true. He remembers Tony’s eyes on him earlier, and the way it felt like fire skating across his skin, flames of desire burning within him. And... Steve doesn’t mind. Surprisingly, this may be the one piss-related thing that he’s on board with. The thought of someone knowing he has to pee, or hearing him pee, or seeing him pee makes him freeze up with anxiety, but the thought of Tony watching him, knowing he has to pee, and he’s
“Yeah, okay, big guy. I better get to bed, in case dear old Dad shows up way too early like he did the last time I fucked up enough to warrant a visit,” Tony says, but he’s reluctant to hang up. “I’ll see you tomorrow, if they leave early.”
“Let me mark you back,” Tony suggests, voice rough with want, and Steve can do nothing but nod. He tilts his head back, inviting Tony to lean forward and suck onto his collarbone. Steve whimpers a little at the sting of pain-pleasure that lights up his nerves.
He can’t remember falling asleep, but he must have, because he wakes up hours later when the sun has gone down outside. Tony is asleep against his shoulder, and Bucky is awake and playing a game on his phone. Steve sits up a little straighter, trying his best not to wake Tony as he does, and winces a little at his full bladder. That's the problem with getting up earlier, he sometimes forgets to empty his bladder twice in the morning. He usually pees as soon as he wakes up, and he can last until before bed as long as he doesn’t get up too early. But if he does, he needs to remember to pee before he leaves his dorm as well.
“Sorry, sorry, I'm still mostly asleep,” Tony says, but his eyes flick quickly over Steve’s slightly-tense form. “
sucking cock, and because Tony still looks a little unsure and Steve wants to get back to making him moan. He also slicks his fingers and traces around the tense muscle of Tony’s hole, humming a little when Tony jumps at the contact.
“Yes, please, that would be great,” Steve says, after only a moment of considering denying his need. He has to go to badly to do that, though.
Tony shrugs self-deprecatingly. “Anyway, I can’t stay over. But you could come hang out for a little bit, maybe?“
It’s about a six hour total travel time to take the train from their school in Boston to their homes in Brooklyn. Bucky and Steve had done this several times before and were used to it, but it’s Tony’s first time on the train,
which Tony should think is sad because it stems from years of having to hold it way too long, but instead he just thinks it's incredibly hot. Tony is definitely hard now. Bucky and Sam no longer exist, for all he knows; all he can see is Steve’s heel tapping up and down on the floor, his empty cup sitting next to his textbook, his bottom lip pulling between his teeth.
“Okay,” Tony says, his eyes locked on the trickle of pee as it slides down Steve’s leg. Steve feels mortified. “Well, it’s 3 in the morning, right? So, no one should be in the bathroom.”
“What’s wrong, baby?” Tony asks, rolling out of bed. Steve makes a pained noise when Tony rolls over his wet spot, but Tony doesn’t notice the spot or his noise. He heads straight for the light switch to flick the lights on.
“Not so fast,” Steve murmurs, pressing his ass firmer against Tony’s crotch, resulting in a high moan from Tony. “A little worked up, huh?”
and he’s so desperate that he’s leaking in his pants, but he can’t go. He knows if he tries that he’ll find himself clenching up in front of the toilet, and he’ll just come out of the bathroom even more desperate than before. He can’t get up and go pee but damn if it doesn’t feel like he’s about to lose it in his pants any second now.
“Right, well... well, I’m just going to run down the hall then. Brucie lives a floor below you and he has an extra toothbrush for when he drags me out of the lab too late and can’t be bothered to walk me back to my own dorm. And I don’t really want to go two nights in a row without brushing my teeth,” Tony says quickly, already heading for Steve’s door. Steve wants to tell him to stay, but he can’t, really, so he lets him go. He doesn’t mention the fact that he knows Tony borrowed his toothbrush just this morning.
“Steve,” Tony scolds gently. “Trust me, you didn’t ruin anything. I was so wound up thinking about how beautiful you are that I couldn’t help myself. My fault.”
One more quick kiss and Tony is out the door. Steve doesn’t waste any time rushing into the bathroom, but once he’s in front of the toilet, he struggles to go. He can hear some people moving and talking outside, which always makes him nervous. He has to remind himself over and over again that no one can see him, no one knows he’s desperate, no one knows he’s -
“What?” Tony pulls back, and Steve can feel his pulse throbbing between his legs and through the mark on his collarbone that he’s sure is darker than the one he left on Tony’s neck.
Tony turns bright red, flush spreading from his cheeks down his neck. He looks down a little, for a moment, and then nods quickly.
Luckily, Steve must not hear him, because a second later Tony hears a rush of pee, still so faint behind the door that he can barely hear it. But he grabs onto that sound and almost whines, he’s so beyond horny right now. Steve’s groaning in relief, long and loud, and then he cuts himself off, as if embarrassed. His stream doesn’t cut off, though. No, instead it gets heavier, louder, more powerful, and Tony’s about a second away from coming in his pants.
Tony makes a high keening noise as Steve’s piss hits him, and his hand moves to stroke his cock once, twice, three times. He basks in it, and Steve almost wonders what it feels like, if it’s making Tony feel that good. He has a thought, and as soon as Tony moves his hand away, Steve aims at his dick.
“Hey, it’s fine,” Tony says, a little dazed at the sight. Steve keeps his hand there. “I’ll just...”
The thing is, Tony isn’t shy or quiet about anything. Sure, sometimes he gets self-conscious, especially with his insanely low self-esteem that drives Steve up the wall. But, even then, he gets defensive and sharp, never quiet.
“Oh,” Tony says stupidly, but he still doesn’t get it. Steve’s been alone all morning, so why hasn’t he gone to the bathroom?
They’ve been at dinner for two whole hours, taking up one of the good tables in the dining hall, annoying everyone else there. That’s when Tony finally notices the subtle signs. Steve starts to sit a little stiffer, feel a little more rigid where he’s leaning comfortably against Tony. He starts to move every so often in his seat; tiny, almost unnoticeable shifts. And then he starts tapping his leg, up and down and up and down and up and down again. He removes his arm from Tony’s shoulder and shifts his weight, sitting up straight and resting his elbows on the table. In this new position he can wiggle his hips a little, Tony notices.
Okay, he’s not cruel. He loves Steve, and doesn’t want to see him in pain, ever. There’s was nothing hot about the time he found Steve in wet pants, sobbing in a panic thinking Tony would leave him when he found out about his paruresis. But... seeing Steve so desperate and forced to hold it, and hold it,
Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Rhodey and Pepper have already arrived, which means they’re just waiting on Peter, Thor and Loki. There’s only four bedrooms, but three of the four have two double beds in each room. That’s a total of seven beds, so Bruce and Peter decide to share a room as the only singles in the group. Natasha, Clint, Rhodey and Pepper share a room, each couple getting a bed. And Sam, Bucky, Steve and Tony decide to share too, since no one wants to share with Thor and Loki.
She heads over to give him another hug, before pushing him in the direction of his room. Steve leads Tony down the thin hallway and into his bedroom. His room is quite small and simple, just a full-sized bed against the far wall and a desk in front of the window on the left wall. There’s a dresser against the right wall, leaving barely any room between it and the bed. Steve had taken most of what he had with him to school, so it’s rather empty as well. But the walls have all sorts of paintings on them; his ma had let him do whatever he wanted to the walls. He’d been painting on them since middle school, and just kept painting over old pictures to create new ones. He has a few ones planned for while he’s home for winter break.
And, that morning, of course, he forgot. He was rushing to get his last project in before he, Bucky and Tony left for the train station, and he completely forgot to pee before he left his dorm. His bladder had still pretty empty from when he’d emptied it after waking up at six in the morning to put the finishing touches on the project, so he didn’t even think about it. It’s nearly six in the evening, now, and it’s been close to twelve hours since Steve last took a piss. And he’s definitely feeling it now. He bladder is throbbing demandingly in his abdomen, a light pulse every other second. He checks his watch; there’s only a half-hour left on this train.
“Sure,” Tony says, frantically thinking of the worst possible things imaginable to get his dick to soften. Running through a couple memories of his Dad being disappointed of him manages to get him back to flaccid in record time.
“Here, let me -“ Steve reaches to get Tony off in return, and Tony flushes when Steve’s hand meets his sticky, cold leftovers from before.
So... what? He just wants to see Steve get close to that point, and then... nothing? He’d be down to watch Steve release it all into toilet, too, actually. But he knows that will probably never happen; Steve might not ever feel comfortable enough to pee while Tony’s in the next room, let alone watching him. But that doesn’t mean Tony can’t fantasize.
“Tony, I’m - I’m close,” Steve warns. Tony lets his tongue gently but firmly press against Steve's taint, and Steve goes rigid and comes with a shout of Tony’s name. Tony strokes him through it, and continues to press his tongue against that area, as Steve’s legs quake where they’re pressed against Tony’s shoulders. Finally when he’s too sensitive, Tony pulls away.
Steve starts stroking himself immediately, because he’s been turned on for hours now, and that was maybe the hottest thing he’s ever seen in his life. Tony’s eyes are lidded as he watches, looking completely blissed out and still riding the high from his orgasm. Steve lasts a minute before he’s coming with a grunt, the white spurts coming to land on Tony’s stomach. Tony doesn’t complain; he lifts a lazy hand to scoop some up and lick his fingers clean. Steve falls to his knees with a groan, hiding his face in the join between Tony’s neck and his shoulder.
“I’d love to,” Tony says, but a second later he shakes his head. “My parents are coming tomorrow. I guess dad is donating some obscene amount again because some ‘idiotic, good-for-nothing screw up’ blew up the engineering lab. I’m guessing they’ll show up as early as possible to lecture me.”
Don’t even get him started on the age thing. He’s seventeen, as a senior, which means the majority of his friends are twenty-one, turning twenty-two. Steve’s twenty, though, because he applied a year early. He’ll be twenty-one this July, and Tony will be eighteen (and finally a legal adult) in May, just in time for graduation.
“Ew,” Steve says, wrinkling his nose. And then, “You can shower at mine whenever you want. If you want.”
He thrusts the soup forward, and Steve’s eyes dart toward it and then back up at Tony’s face. He doesn’t reach to take it.
“I-I wet the bed,” Steve says in a whisper, daring to glance up at Tony’s face. Tony’s brow is furrowed in a combination of concern and confusion. He looks over at the bed they both evacuated.
“Fuck, Steve. I’m a little keyed up, sorry,” Tony apologizes, but Steve is staring at him like he’s the center of the universe.
Steve missing class, though, that wasn’t normal. Steve was a stickler for attendance, never missed a class unless he absolutely had to. Last semester, Bucky and Tony had to team up when Steve had a lung infection in order to keep him from going to class.
Steve tries by himself at first, but after a few minutes of nothing, Tony comes in and stands behind him, hands on his waist. He tries to distract Steve, tries to press on his bladder to make him go, but all Steve can focus on is Rhodey’s voice carrying through the walls. All he can think about is how loud it would be if he went, how everyone would be able to hear it, and he can’t bring himself to go.
“Okay, here’s what I want you to do, babe,” Tony says, already imagining Steve doing the things in his mind before saying them. “I want you to start slow, okay? Just start with trailing your fingers over your nipples. I’ll do the same, and you can picture me, if you want to.”
Okay, no. Distract. He has to distract himself. So, instead he thinks about the dumb movie they saw, and the way Tony made fun of the characters, but silently, only for Steve. He’d turn in his seat to Steve and mouth along with the lines like he knew what they were going to say, dramatizing his movement in his face. Steve couldn’t even remember what the plot was, only that it wasn’t very good, and -
“Oh, wow,” Tony says when he sees the walls. “This is beautiful, Steve. Can you do up my dorm room like this?”
So Steve lets himself relax again, and after a minute there’s another spurt. Then another. And, soon, his bladder decides it’s waited too long and he’s releasing in a small trickle that’s steadily building into a full stream. The whole time, Tony’s in his ear repeating how well Steve is doing.
Steve’s been getting better about telling Tony when he needs to go, actually. He’ll never be able to randomly announce it like Tony obviously can, but sometimes he can work up the courage to ask Tony to leave the room for a little bit if he’s getting desperate.
He really should have noticed this sooner; it’s kind of obvious. Steve can’t use public restrooms, and therefore he waits until he gets back to his dorm every night, so of course it would follow that every night he’s nursing a full bladder. But no matter how obvious and simple it is, Tony still gets smacked in the face by it every time Steve wiggles or squirms or
Tony moves them to the bed, pushing Steve to lay back so he can straddle his hips. They’re humping each other like horny teenagers, but Tony technically is still one, and Steve’s not too far off. Tony kisses him like he’s drowning and Steve is fresh air, arching up into every touch. It’s beautiful, and it feels great.
“...well, next time, just let me know and I’ll take a walk or something,” Tony says, like it’s the easiest thing ever, and Steve just blinks at him.
Steve continues going for over a full minute, not that Tony really notices with the way his brain has turned to mush. But eventually he hears the squeak of the springs in Steve’s mattress as he sits back in bed, and it snaps Tony out of his blissful state of euphoria after the best orgasm of his life. He never would have asked for a piss kink, but, he’s not really complaining right now. Not after the orgasm he just had.
is nothing compared to his low groan when he finds his prostate. He definitely can’t hear it, anyway, with the way he’s lost in the fantasy inside his head.
Steve hums around Tony’s dick, feeling it twitch in his mouth. He remembers when Tony gave him a blowjob, and he goes to do the same thing Tony did, press on his taint. But Tony lifts his hips a little so that Steve’s fingers slide a little lower, bumping against the ridged ring of his hole.
Tony turns to him, smirk a mile wide. “I think you said I could shower here whenever I want. You said nothing about sleepovers.”
All Steve can do is blink at Tony in awe. He’s sure he looks dumb, gaping at Tony with all the love he feels in his eyes; he’s never felt... controlled, but in a good way. In a
Steve doesn’t waste a second. He tosses the to-go bag of food from the dining hall on a workbench and slips off his backpack, and then he sits on the ground next to Tony and pulls him close into a hug. Tony shifts slightly to hide his face in Steve’s shoulder instead of his knees, but other than that, he doesn’t move.
“We’ll be there in a couple hours,” Tony says, trying to be comforting, but they both know there’s little comfort in that.
It goes like that for awhile, Steve face-fucking him, finally thrusting his hips along with it when he sees that Tony wants it like that. Tony decides to change it up a little, though, and pulls off. He ignores Steve’s whine, and leans down a little to suck one of his balls into his mouth. Steve groans lowly at that, especially when Tony uses his hand to circle around the head of his dick and stroke short and sharp.
“Mom,” Steve interrupts, smiling a bit at her mother-henning. “Chicken and potatoes sounds great. But I think we should put our stuff down first, and get settled.”
Steve wakes up warm and happy, with Tony snoring away on his chest. He smiles at the sight of his boyfriend, content to just lay there all morning with him.
“Okay,” Tony says, pulling back a little. But he freezes a few inches from Steve and just watches him, takes in Steve’s face and body. Steve doesn’t know exactly what Tony’s seeing, what he’s looking for, but he hopes he likes it. “Can you hold it? For me?”
Well, more accurately, he’s going straight down Tony’s throat. He doesn’t even think of stopping. He probably wouldn’t even be capable of stopping at that point, not with how bad he had to go and the pure, unadulterated relief he’s feeling now. He just moans lowly, and jerks his hips a little as he lets more piss out.
Even Bucky and Sam’s banter isn’t enough to distract Steve from the pounding in his abdomen as they enter their dorm building. Bucky, Sam, Bruce, Tony and Steve all pile into the tiny elevator together, while Clint and Nat head to her first floor dorm room. Bucky and Sam get off at the third floor, Bruce at the fourth, and then it’s just the two of them in the elevator.
Tony nods along, his cheeks still a dull pink. He looks a bit overwhelmed, but he’s still smiling a little, eyes wandering over the pictures of Steve when he was younger and old art projects on the walls.
, which is just wrong on too many damn levels. So it’s not like he’s the worst person out there just because he’s apparently into pants-pissing. Specifically, Steve pissing his pants.
on his laptop at the highest volume to drown out his soft gasps and muffled moans as he strokes his dick. By the time he reaches down and around to slide a finger inside himself, though, everyone in his suite probably knows exactly what he’s doing anyway. He isn’t even trying to quiet the sounds he’s making anymore; the audio from
Tony notices all of it, in fact. He’s watching Steve. Like a goddamn hawk. He sees every sign that Steve is getting uncomfortable, that Steve’s bladder is filling, and he feels a sick sort of pleasure from it. And with that comes guilt, too, because Steve’s not getting desperate on purpose, but Tony finds it so, so...
“Everything,” Peter said almost automatically, though his voice quivered slightly. It was obvious he was nervous.
“You decided to join the facial hair club?” Tony said as he approached, and Steve lifted his head slightly. As soon as he saw Tony, a tired smile spread across his face. It was small, but it was there. And as soon as it appeared on his face, the smile seemed to fade. It seemed Steve as dealing with some mixed emotions as well.
“I love you too Peter,” Tony said as he felt something whell up in his chest. “I love you to the moon and back.”
“Did Tony cook you breakfast?” Pepper asked as she sat down at the table across from Peter and next to Tony. Both boys turned their heads to look at Pepper and Peter opened his full mouth at the sight of her.
“Will do Mr. Stark,” Rita said, taking Peter and walking him back to a waiting bed. Tony watched silently as the woman and her team did their best to calm Peter down. It seemed like forever, but once Peter compliant, the inventor moved towards the exit.
Peter was cold and shaking, and honestly, Tony was a little surprised by that. But as soon as the two touched, Peter was quick to move into Tony’s embrace. The older man pulled Peter close to his chest and layed back down before rolling over so that Peter was closer to the middle of the bed instead of the edge. With that the man took his large hands and pushed back Peter’s hair so that it was out of the little boy’s face. Now the father and son just layed in bed, staring back at each other.
When he opened the door he expected to find another pregnant girl, or an adult, but instead he found a little boy sitting in the corner of the dark room. He was small and definitely a toddler, maybe two or three. His back was towards the door but he was quick to turn around.
“Hey, Hey, Hey!” Tony said in alarm as he took his thumb and gently wiped away the tears that were now falling down Peter’s cheeks. “I’m not mad! You just startled me,” Tony said before humming in the back of his throat. “I could never be mad at you, okay? So don’t tell me you’re sorry.” Tony said, pulling Peter into a soft hug before resting his chin on the top of his head.  “Do you want to sleep here with me tonight?” he then asked.
You should definitely find me on Tumblr (or leave a comment). I love interacting with all of you, it makes me so happy. I love to see what you enjoyed about the fic, what I could work on, and any ideas. (Because let's be real, this fic is constantly evolving. I would love to get readers ideas and input!!!!) -- My tumblr url is the same as my username here, so come find me!!!
“Sorry,” came a small voice as the figure shifted their weight from one foot to the other. “I didn’t mean to scare you,” it called out. “But I can’t sleep.”
“There is no way to know for sure right now but-” Sam began but Steve was up in a flash and stalking towards the door into the other room.
“The others,” she said as she pulled away and walked over to the door. ‘We have to get them out too,” She insisted. Of course Steve couldn’t say no.
“Don’t worry about that right now,” Pepper soothed as she took her hand and ran it through Tony’s damp hair. (He had definitely taken a shower) “I’ll take care of it,” She said and with that Tony was leaning into the woman, pressing his forehead against her midsection.
“Ah, there he is!” Tony said with a smirk on his face as he leaned back into the bench. “I was afraid you might not be Steve Rogers. But those puppy dog eyes are unmistakable,” Tony said, smile still on his face.
“Mr. Stark!” A soft voice suddenly interjected. It was the doctor on call to the medical ward. The man had been in the corner of the room at a desk when the two had entered the room, and he didn’t want to disturb them right when they entered. “It’s good to see you,” The black haired doctor said as he extended a hand to Tony. The inventor shook it once before turning away from Peter, hoping their talking wouldn’t’ wake him.
“See! Look what you did,” Tony grumbled as he dabbed Peter’s finger with a cotton ball a few times before squeezing the finger so that he could get a good blood sample.
“By Odin’s beard, is that Captain America?” A voice called out, making Steve’s blood run cold. No one, absolutely no one, should know that name here. Hell, Steve was even wondering how
“N-No. It-it’s okay P-Peter.” Tony continued. “You’re okay. This i-is all on me,” Tony said as he squeezed his eyes shut, taking in a steady breath. It took it a moment but he was finally able to compose himself and then continued with his task.
recognized that name. It’s not like he should even be recognizable. He had grown his beard out again, and his hair was quite a bit longer, pulled back at the nape of his neck. Lifting his eyes, though, he came face to face with Loki who was taking a seat next to him.
“We’re going to go see Rita now, okay? She’s going to give you a bath and change your clothes and make sure you’re insides are all okay. And when she’s done I’ll see you again. Deal?” Tony said as he walked out of the room with Peter and down the hall.
“I kind of fucked some stuff up at home with Pops,” Peter said with a small shrug and Tony only nodded before leading Peter over to the couch to sit. “And I was getting the ham and noticed the tower was a few blocks away. I wasn’t sure if you were here or not…but I thought I would just stop by and check,” Peter explained with a sheepish smile.
The woman pressed her lips together in a fine line and gave a slight smile as she nodded and moved around Steve. She only looked over her shoulder once as she continued down the hall, but Steve was gone when she did so.
“There is some stuff in here I don’t understand,” Steve began as he handed the file over to Tony. “But there is some medical information, and experiments they ran, things like that. I hope it helps,” Steve said.
“Steve!” a voice suddenly called from down the hall. The super soldier snapped his head up to see both Sam and Clint coming towards him and the other. And in Clint’s arms he held the girl that the scientists had been messing with.
The Captain was suddenly pulled from his thoughts when Sam came into the room holding a stack of folders. They looked liked folders that one would seen in a doctor's office, and each had a picture pinned to the front.
And that wasn’t all. Through Sam's digging, Steve had learned that they were in fact running a breeding operation for enhanced individuals. Some girls had gotten pregnant just so the scientists could test on the children while they were still in the womb, while others had become pregnant with certain men’s children. He had read file after file about these women and wondered how in the world HYDRA had gotten their hands on semen, or any DNA from the other subject.
“Thank you,” Tony said, his voice shaking slightly. Pepper just hummed as she continued to run her hands through Tony’s hair. “I’m a bad father,” Tony suddenly muttered. “I promised Peter I would be back as soon as I woke up from a nap...and I’ve been awake for hours, just hiding out in here,” Tony huffed, his voice wavering even more.
For the last two days Peter had been laid up in bed with a horrific cold. Ever since he had the spider-bite it was rare that Peter would get a sick, but apparently he still could. And this was proof of it. The boy had chills, a high fever, a stuffy nose, and now his throat was starting to feel the effects.  He figured it was due to the cold weather and him staying out almost all night while on patrol as Spider-Man. So when Peter came in from his duties two days ago, he bought a bottle of NyQuil, took a dosage, and went straight to bed. And there he had remained for the past 48 hours. The only times he came out was to use the bathroom, or fulfill the small chores Steve had him do.
“You need a bath and and a change of clothes, and so do I. Once I’m cleaned up I’ll be back to stay with you,” Tony explained as he turned the corner and into the wig with the other children.
“Look…Pops! I-I’m sorry. I didn’t see the ham when I was putting things away I-I’m sorry.” Peter said, trying to remember if there was actually a ham in the bag of food earlier this morning.
Now that she had the chance, she could see that Tony was staring at a picture of a couple. The screen was split and one picture was of both of them, while the other side was zoomed in on the womans face. Pepper eyed the picture as she closed in on the bed. Kicking off her heels, she sat on the edge of the bed next to Tony and laid a hand on the man’s arm.
“Well, eat up all that food. You have to eat a lot to be big and strong,” Peter said, his attention now back on his own plate of food.
As Steve tossed open the door he noticed everyone was sleeping...except for the boy that he was looking for. Peter simply sat on the black couch, next to Bailey who was passed out. His large eyes met Steve’s and it looked like he had been expecting someone to walk through the door. Steven was slightly taken back by this, but pushed it to the back of his mind as he looked the boy over. And the more he looked, the more he could see Tony in the boy. His nose, the color of his hair and- those eyes!
The man scrubbed his face and let out a shaky breath. He was sure he had fallen asleep, but only a glance at the clock would confirm his theory. So with one fluid movement, Tony rolled onto his side to look at the glowing digital clock that was at his bedside. What Tony was not expecting was to come face to face with a small figure that was literally two inches from his face. He could see the dark outline of the figure, but what really stuck out were the big round eyes that stared back at him.
“Don’t be sorry, please.” Tony said, his eyes flickering up to Steve’s. “You’re such a great guy and I’m sorry you’ve been through so much in your life. I’m sure it’s been hard. But you’re still going to do great things. Don’t be sad just because little ol’ me is gone. If anything, I want to you to live because of me,” Tony said as he let go of the door handle and leaned forward so that the two were a few inches away. “Get that life I was telling you about. Be happy. For me, yeah?” Tony said as he reached a hand up, putting it on the back on Steve’s head.
They had arrived back in New York about two hours ago. And while that meant rest for the others, Tony had work to do. The inventor was quick to get the two mothers-to-be settled. He made sure they were comfortable and had sent up appointments with the on-call doctor to get a report on the girls and their children. From there Tony had collected the girls family information. He was going to make the call to the parents, but Steve stopped him.
“Tony.” Pepper hummed as she added pressure to her hands to let Tony know that she meant business. “He is a little boy. I’m sure he is just as scared as you. But he can’t understand what others are feeling and needing right now. And if he can’t do that...there is no way he is going to hold a grudge towards you because you didn’t come when you said you would.”
For now Tony put the blood sample in the system so FRIDAY to process it. He may be tired, but he was eager to see if Peter was actually his son or not. It would be a bit of a wait, and all Tony wanted to do was change out of his clothes and take a nap.
“I think that’s an understatement,” Steve said, shaking his head. “What are you doing here?” He then asked.  Steve was about to ask why he wasn’t dead, but then remembered how Tony and Scott explained that Loki had gotten away with the tesseract back in 2012 New York. This must be that Loki.
“How-?” Steve began but then recalled that Peter had been in a HYDRA base. He knew very little about what they had wanted Peter for, but from the file he had read over, and some questions he had asked FRIDAY about Tony’s findings, he had a fairly good idea. “How much do you know?” Steve finally asked.
This only lasted a moment, though, before Tony took Steve’s hands in his own and placed them on top of his moving hips. “There ya’ go Cap,” Tony slurred as he brushed up against Steve, feeling the bulge against his own every now and then.
“Hey JARVIS,” Peter hummed gently. It felt good to be in the tower. He hadn’t been there in a little less than a month. “Is my dad here?” Peter asked as he moved towards the private elevator towards the back of the room.
Everything hurt and once he had his door closed behind him he began to srtip articles of clothing one by one, leaving a trail to his bedroom. By the time he collapsed in his bed he was down to his boxers and socks. Normally he hated sleeping with socks, but today he would make an exception.
How could it be Christmas already? It didn’t even feel like Christmas. Hell, there wasn’t even any snow on the ground. This was literally the most ill prepared Peter felt for the holiday. When he was younger Peter remembered how excited he always felt around this time of the year. He remembered all the hype that Pops and Dad would add to the holiday, even after they had split.
“Peter, I’m going to need to see your finger for a minute okay? There will be a little poke and then it will be all over. You can handle that, right?” Tony asked as he crouched down so that he and Peter were the same height.
“I wouldn’t call it lame,” Tony hummed. “I think this sits more on the tragic-romantic side of things,” Tony laughed. “Well...maybe sappy romance. But I like the thought,” The inventor said, a smile on his face. “I know you’re living in a dingy apartment. And while there would be two Steves eventually, you are welcome to stay at the tower. Your uh...past self is currently touring America. I’m not sure when he will be getting back. So I’m sure we can-”
It had been one year since Tony and Steve had tied the knot, and everything had been perfect. Of course the two had gotten their fair share of people that had told them it would not work out. Two people with such strong personalities, coexisting together? The idea was far fetched to some, but Tony and Steve knew it would work out. The fact that they had made it to a full year was a testament to that belief.
All the men looked at each other in shock as each one tried to think about what the next step would be after hearing information like that.
“Well,” She said, taking a deep breath. “I have a few things, but the most important one is that Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters will be coming today. I received a call from their office an hour ago so they should be here soon. They would like to meet with you and the girls that were kept...at that place. I think they are also evaluating the other two children,” Pepper said as she watched Peter eat from the corner of her eye.
Christmas just wasn’t the same. It would never be the same. But maybe next year he would spend it with Dad instead. No one deserved to be alone on Christmas.  No. He
What was he going to do? He didn’t want his aunt and uncles getting sick because of him. But now almost every store was going to be closed. It was Christmas Eve and…wait. Peter remembered watching TV and seeing that The Target department store was going to be open till eleven. Peter had never been there in his life. But he was sure that they had food. Surly they would have a ham. Especially if it was on the holidays. Pulling out his phone, Peter looked up the directions. It was going to be about an hour trip from Pop’s apartment. He just had to get his card.
“Hey, we don’t know if that kid is mine until I run a test. Just because a piece of paper says he’s mine, doesn’t make him,” Tony said in a warning tone.
Tony slowly opened the door and peeked his head inside as he looked around the room. It looked like an ordinary station that a park ranger would stay in. It was dark, though, and Tony used the gauntlet as a light as he helt his hand in front of him. As he moved further into the darkness, though, he heard a sound to his left and quickly shifted over, gauntlet ready to fire.
“Oh no Steve. I’m sorry, but with Thanos out of the picture and you holding onto the time stone, you’ve created an alternate timeline. I’m afraid there is no way for you get back to your original time.” The Ancient One explained. “At least, not by yourself,” she said as orange energy began to form around her hands.
