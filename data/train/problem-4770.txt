Dean finished his cigarette, stubbed it out on the wall and dropped it into the waiting ashtray.
“Prayer from a faithless man,” said Castiel, and helped him to his feet.
“I don’t think the town wants us to leave,” said Sam.
And yet, he heard Dean’s voice, clear as a bell, inside his head – even at this distance.
Dean examined some of the items in the store. Interesting shit, the kind of crap he used to look at when it was Christmas at RadioShack and they had all the cool new tech toys before the world had irrevocably changed.
“In here,” he commanded. “Now.”
"Where was I callin' from, anyway?" asked Dean. "I was pretty vague about that."
The answer is:
, as one of your folktales says.
“I want to come,” Dean said, and he could feel his blush rising, coloring his chest and his cheeks and the back of his neck.
“Dean?” he asked, confused, sitting up.
Castiel admonished himself sternly for listening to a man’s private time, though his eyes fluttered closed.
It felt dangerous. Addictive.
"Don't you worry, Castiel. We're all on your side. We understand. Because we're
“All this time,” he agreed. “In fact, I think I knew before either of you did. I’ve been watching my big brother all my life.”
Dean checked briefly on Sam, who had apparently never stirred, and then slid between the covers of his own bed with an eagerness that might have terrified him otherwise.
“Hi, Cas,” he said, and hugged the angel.
"Ah ah ah
It was high time he got out of his own way.
“Because I don’t love you. Apparently.”
“You have permission to want things,” Castiel assured him. “Now
"I have passed a difficult night."
He could not go to Dean, or explain what had happened.
Or as sober a look as a man can give when he’s just been drinking out of a whisky lake.

strong as the dragontree that was his body, bitter as the blood that flowed from its veins.
When he was.
“Yeah, I thought the same,” said Sam, slipping it back into his pocket again. “Okay. I’m gonna go get some sleep. Try to get some rest, huh?”
The message was clear:
A whine escaped Castiel’s throat, startling him. He looked down at the curve of his own hard cock in his jeans and then back up at the scene before him.
Castiel stood on the beach, and he breathed in freedom for the first time in millennia, and willed his stubborn heart to stay away.
"That's just it," said Dean. "I was raised to think that everyone had a place. And to hide things, if they weren't - "
No words not enough words not the right words –
" Heracles was pleading holding a chiton in his hands as he rushed past Dean and Castiel. "Hello, you two - join us at table, we'll be seated over there."
“Oh,” he said –
Castiel was tending to the flowers in the garden when Dean approached, yawning.
“Cas, you gotta listen to me, okay? You gotta break the surface here and kick him out, he’s a real smarmy asshole.”
"Yes," Castiel told him.
it thrummed through him like a bass line.
“I know you’ve been dealing with this shit for a long time, and coming home hasn’t been easy for you,” said Sam. “I still think that how we grew up is worse for you somehow.”
“Of course I do,” said Paul Bunyan. “We are all legends, after all. And now I know you, too!”
However, given what followed, it seemed that Dean had more pressing issues in mind.
“Huh,” said Dean, staring at Sam, not looking at Castiel at all.
They were blackened, now, due to his personal decisions and choices. Angels also had free will, but unlike humans, tended to pay dearly for the things that got them into trouble.
“When a claim is laid on a human soul, it makes a mark,” Castiel intoned. “And there is precedent in the Bible,

to conquer him, damn it.
“Tell me if you want this,” Castiel directed. “I need words, Dean.”
Cas popped the dark metal button on Dean’s jeans, the blue fabric a contrast against the dirt and blood caked on Cas’s hands. Slowly, so slowly, Dean’s mouth softened, his jaw dropped as he watched Cas’s nimble fingers, hands that spun a silver blade as expertly as he was exploring Dean now.
Dean wondered at that, too.
"Meet me in the silver birch wood in a quarter of an hour," said Dean, and then made himself scarce.
“Are you
Like a question.
At this, Castiel went gentle and fond.
“I take it you’re not actually a priest.”
Dean was suddenly aware of the potential that he held in his hands now.
“Unless you somehow end up doing something the writer never intended.”
“You have to ask for it,” Castiel was gasping. “Fucking
He glanced at Castiel with a tight, humorless smile.
“I’m not going to smite you,” said Balthasar. “I’m here because our letters could be intercepted.”
Castiel laughed indulgently and followed Miguel to the first of the little tents, where his glass was filled – and Dean’s, by Castiel’s request, but as it turned out, the villagers already knew him and were more than happy to provide.
“Dean,” muttered Castiel, and still held back; his appendages now swollen to the point of delicious pain, his wings bleeding blue, his cock dripping.

"Yes, that too."
Sam had approached the doorway to greet her, but she shook her head.

As I passed him, I realized he was waving the OK sign, kinda weird but I waved at him as a thanks/acknowledgement of his existence or whatever.

“Hello, fellow vintage car enthusiasts,” he proclaimed.
Luckily, they were swept up in conversation with others soon after that, and Castiel had hoped that the incident was forgotten.
that was
"I can say no anytime. Sorry, I'm just being an asshole. Yeah, I'd like that - help you to unwind before the big dinner or whatever, sounds like a plan."

The heat was still searing, but at least he no longer felt like a garbage brownie in some kid’s E-Z Bake Oven.

now? Ha,” Sam told him.
“What is that?” asked Dean.
“Venom,” he announced.
After the usual cleanup, Dean was in the shower scrubbing at his hair and half-considering a quick jerkoff session to the incredible memories he’d just added to his considerable bank and how these blew anything else right out of the water.
“Okay,
“Or - ?” Sam sighed and looked at his brother. “Face it, Dean. Our lives are really shitty but more frequently just…really, really stupid.”
The headlines read:
“Um, okay, thank you, that’s great,” Sam finally said, hiding a smile. “But don’t you need that?”
“Um,” said Dean. “What do you want for the smorgasbord?”
you know I love you, Mr. Winchester, please – ”
than it had while he was inside his own mind, but he could only tell the difference now that he was here in reality.
“It is not a ‘bullshit answer’,” Castiel said.
In between Dean and his gun stood Castiel.
Dean loved the summer.

Dean didn’t want it.

was fairly popular," Mulder replied.
Dean didn't do this all that often anymore. He was older, had seen too much, had the lines on his face to prove it. Pickings were slim these days, now that he didn't have the prettyboy face that he'd quietly damned in the mirror despite its uses as bait and a bank account.
HERO BODYGUARD SAVES AMERICA’S HEARTTHROB
thought Dean, as he flipped the light on in the room and ushered the man inside.
“Anyway, obviously nobody believed me,” said Dean. “So now I’m stuck here, just like you, until I can get a ship and crew together. But if I’m honest, I don’t know my heart’s in it anymore. Losing Sam…”
They passed through an impressive aviary.
So Castiel watched over Dean, and Castiel yearned, expressing his love via the turndown of the bed, a warm bath drawn before Dean even knew he wanted one, an expertly-folded napkin.
There was a stocked liquor cabinet, a fireplace, and a state-of-the-art entertainment system, complete with a gigantic wide-screen television that emerged from the wall at the press of a button.
“Do you think he’d mind if I went up there and see if he’s okay?” Dean asked.
But it didn't matter
Nothing happened.
"A werewolf? In London?" Castiel put in. "Yes, I think he might have reason to seek a better life for himself, and especially for his new family."
“Figures. If you never left the island.”
“Was,” Dean confirmed with a nod, a pained look on his face. “He’s gone now. But I – I thought about ending things, Cas, I’ll be honest with you. I thought – it was serious, man. And then – you asked me to – anyway.”
“Let’s just say I threw it in,” said the man.
"Man, you weren't kiddin'," he said, staring at his surroundings with awe equal to, if not greater than, he had shown outside.
The dinner with Sam went well.
And put a hand over Castiel’s clothed cock, already half-hard.
“C’mon, Cas, I ain’t gonna break,” said Dean. “An’ if I do, you can fix me.
Castiel froze.
He dropped into a pew like one of his hymn books, put his head in his hands, and sobbed –
those billions of lives, born-lived-died, all in the blink of an angelic eye, all much the same to any angel, until the one remarkable creature that brought this one to rebellion –
“Man, you need to relax,” said Dean. “Nobody should be eating cereal like they’re condemned to it.”
“Please,” he begged. “I can be so good for you – ”
The way he said it - plain, unadorned - made Dean swallow hard.
A man might be heartbroken, but an angel's heart is his entire being.
Castiel sat down across from them, and offered him the loaf of bread.
Dean, still somewhat flushed, was so ethereally beautiful that Castiel almost could not keep his own promise about not touching, claiming, marking this man so everyone knew he belonged to him, in this world and the next.
“And whipped cream.”
Castiel blinked.
“Well ain’t you just a tall drink o’ water,” she said.
“Well how do you know he hasn’t been reborn, or whatever?” asked Dean.
Dean opened his eyes to find himself alone.
"Don't worry about it, Cas," said Dean, nonchalant. "Not like he was worth anything. He wasn't human. You're welcome, by the way."
Certainly, Dean had guessed; of course, Dean had heard Castiel say things like that during sex.
The great and the good.
“That’s really unfair on an overgrown giant, the puppy eyes,” Dean groused.
Dinner was an elaborate, lavish affair.
Dean and Cas were sitting on the same side of the diner booth, grinning at each other.
So no, I did not want to watch a program that buried two drifters deep underground and told me they were happy about it, because I know from lived experience exactly how being forced into that situation drains us completely dry. The addition of a ‘child’ further cemented my disinterest in the program because this was not what the fuck I signed up for. Therefore I have often said I am not a fan of the show. Just of Destiel, and of the on-the-road version of it, which is where I set most of the stories I tell about them.
"That is a very generous offer, sir."
Sam was also trying to make his presence known by a series of completely ineffective throat clearings.
Castiel paused, briefly.
He relented, because he was a total idiot for that kid.
Thank you for reading :)
Castiel saw, with horror, the machinery –
"Yeah, you definitely should be dead," he assured his brother. "But she'd - I don't know,
The immediate startled reaction knocked him off the staircase entirely as Castiel reared back in shock and blurted:
Dean had little choice but to follow.

“Well,
Dean turned to his brother, desperate.
Dean’s jaw dropped.
“You’d rather be here, in a fake world, than come home?”
"Yes, sir, I know it."
Dean was on his knees in front of Castiel again before he’d even thought about it, wrists crossed behind him.
but was avoiding him like a teenage girl embarrassed she’d confessed to her crush –
Dean whined, and wept, and did as he was told.
Dawn arrived again; beautiful, unchanging as the sea.
He put a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean watched him steadily, warily.

” Dean whined, in the low light of the lamp on the side table.
Dean snorted.
“But that’s the truth of them, ain’t it.”
Dean reached into his boxers and started to pull at his cock.
Castiel arched his back and opened his mouth as something between a strangled scream and loud static issued from it.
Suddenly, he was pitched overboard in a lurch from the ship, and he spread his great black wings.
Cas’s mouth was open, a hairsbreadth away from Dean’s, but he made no move to kiss him, tantalizingly close but too far away.
Sam nearly ran into his back.
“She had been very poor as a child, um, obviously, and her mother got her started in it because the family was so hungry,” Dean said.
"There's only one bed!"
“Absolutely not, Sammy. Not on your life. Doesn’t matter anyway, not like it’s gonna affect him.”
“What – how much? How can I pay you?”
“When you called me here from my parish, I thought it was for some religious observance,” he said. “Not…a
“I know!”
He laughed again, and waved a hand, as if dismissing what he had seen as silly.
this?” Dean asked, half-furious and half-impressed.
He had found living with the memories of his most recent life some of the most difficult he had ever known.
But Dean had also long ago learned not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and so he made the best of what he considered a bad situation.
Unsurprisingly, he had also struck out for the evening.
"I'd kind of hoped you'd have figured it out by now."
Pasion's joyous

"Why wouldn't he?" snapped Dean. "'Course he wants to see me, I've been lookin' for the bastard for days - "
Dean walked home to his apartment that night floating on air.
, Dean,” said Sam. “He might kill you, too!”
"You're not a monster to me, Cas," murmured Dean, as he approached the bed. "You're divine."
"Thanks a lot, you cryptic sonofabitch," said Dean.
He crossed his arms.
Well, he was, in a certain light; couldn't really be picky on the road, but of course that wasn't the main attraction.
There was a

She was rotund and cuddly-looking, made of smiles.
And the way he had been doing things so far, in this life, hadn’t netted him much, if anything.
The Impala roared to life beneath his hands.
A stinging arrow of jealousy went through him at the thought. He watched it go with even more confusion.
Now that he was here, he didn’t know what the hell to say.
“Something a little more like guerrilla warfare, but yes. Fights like this depend more on subterfuge than the nuclear option.”
Dean sat staring at Mulder with a dopey expression he caught in the mirror and immediately snapped out of it.
There was something strange and powerful in Castiel's gaze.

Dean had never seen eyes so blue in his life.
Samuel, and a few of the servants in attendance, gasped.
"And what's that about?" asked Dean.
There was a storm rolling in, one that Castiel could not really deny had more to do with the fact he was now alone with Dean than anything to do with the weather.
Dean sighed.
The phone in Castiel’s pocket began to ring.
"The little one at the top," whispered Felipe.
Then he looked at Castiel.
“I don’t do that.”
“What fuckin’ velvet rope nightclub bullshit is this,” muttered Dean.

“C’mon, Dean, it’s
"And the thing is," said Dean, "whether or not you go,
“Hang on tight,” said Gabriel, putting a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “I meant what I said about the fledglings, by the way.”
Castiel's behavior in this story is based entirely on his creaturehood, which is the primary reason I write any of these stories. Cas's monstrous nature is the most interesting thing about him to me, in relation to Dean, and therefore most of the stories I write will not follow regular human cultural mores (because Cas is inhuman). I am fascinated by questions like: what does it mean for a monster to love a human monster-hunter, is an angel a monster, what is a soul, monsters and class prejudice, etc.
All the bravado seemed to suddenly go out of him, and the air out of the room.
"What for?"
“Tina?”
Then he walked inside.
He had a dazed expression on his face. Then, with a wave of his hand, the room was clean.
"Dean," Castiel reprimanded him.
People often hung garlands of flowers around his neck on festival-days, because as small as Castielfabib might have been, the inhabitants still loved a fiesta.
"You stay with him.”
Castiel. Promise me."
Dean watched as Castiel posted himself at the bedroom door, a lone silhouette in the darkness.
“Do you see, there, the land under the water?”
But Castiel lifted him anyway, spinning him around and up against the wall –

Dean was so far on the other side of ashamed now, he was a mess, writhing beneath a man who had barely touched him.

Dean wondered if he could start losing it in the afterlife.

“That’s pretty cool. But no, that’s not it.”
"Please. I am
Waving a little rainbow flag and grinning from ear to ear.
Castiel’s heart sank.
Dean eyed him suspiciously.
"Mostly manual labor," Dean reassured him. "I do stuff like this on the side, from time to time. And it's been a long time, if I'm being honest. Until now."
Another long pause.
Hopefully to a nicer motel than this one, but he never held high hopes when it came to their lodging situations.

After that, Dean stopped trying to tell other people about it.

And Dean came then, on a little arched cry, and Castiel did likewise, slicking Dean’s thighs with his spend.

The birds chirped in the trees, as they had back then, as they did today, as they would many years from now.

“Okay,” said Dean. “Nice to meet you an’ all but, why?”
“Well yeah, that’s because he was my – my – ”
“Where’d you get that idea?” asked Dean. “Did he say something to you?”
"We barely know each other, Cas," he said, tracing the man's jawline with a fingertip. "And you've only paid up for a week."
“Yessir, I have been called that in my time,” said John.
Castiel, likewise, on a stuttered little gasp, came on Dean’s hand and seemed self-satisfied about it, like he had been waiting to mark him up, which made Dean shiver at the thought.
Castiel was humping up against him, once, twice, again, making a strange low growling sound in his throat, cock buried deep inside Dean.
“Do you think he forgives all men?”
Dean had gone to hide in the shower.
And he backed away, upsetting a side table.
"No," whispered Dean, "no, sir, please stop denying yourself, denying

At this, Castiel made a strange, tense sound and stood up, looming over Dean's prone body as he suddenly shoved his pants down and took hold of his cock.
And there it was again –
Dean sighed, content.
“Sounds fucking dumb.”
He threw his elbow over his head and then leaned on it, the flat of his hand against the back of his head as he paused with his pen against the blank square, fighting back tears.
Castiel watched Dean button up his shirt and willed the words to come.
"You're
And he winked.
“Give me power,” Dean said.

Castiel sighed, but said nothing.
Souls could be funny that way.
So this was someone else.
His great wings unfurled along the floor and the eyes opened again, watching Dean, his favourite pastime.
“Cas, open up.”
something for him, or maybe the incubus just wanted a better taste -
Castiel looked askance at the wildly-bright food on the plate and then at Dean, who nodded his encouragement.
Dean made a frankly
Dean was struck silent for a moment.
They stood there and watched the opening sequence, which seemed normal enough.
Benny went in for another desperate kiss.
Castiel followed right behind.
“You finish that sentence, I’m kicking  your ass on principle.”
It closed around him, soft and sinuous and sticky as glue, tight as a glove.
for an angel, even rarer –
This also meant a kind of freedom that did not mind at all, when it came to Castiel and Dean -
“Why would you want to do that?” he asked.
"Sure," he drawled, and let Castiel escort him into the sunlight.
He was surprised that he hadn’t immediately been kicked out of the place, after Cas had his fill.
Dean laughed.
"Starry, starry night...paint your palette blue and grey... look out on a summer's day...Kathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping. I'm empty and aching and I don't know why," Dean continued, lost the lyrics again, and then said, "Take me home - country roads - to the place - I belong - "
"Getting right into it, are we?"
“We all did,” Dean admitted. “Gotta say, I never even thought to question
Castiel held his gaze, that clear green he so loved.
“Okay,” said Dean, wondering just what the hell he was going to find on the other side of the door. “Here goes nothin’.”
His heart, maybe.
"Let's just say that in this, you are still looking at the mechanics, and not the heart," he said. "But this is a key problem for humanity."
Dean glared at him.
Finally, Castiel fled.
He reveled in it, drenched himself in it.
And, Dean supposed, that was actually true at the moment.
He loved looking into those green eyes just as he had so many, many years ago.
Cas made a quiet sound into the kiss that Dean wanted to package and sell, it was that good.
“Wow, this is awesome,” said Dean, sitting down on a pillow.
Dean's eyes immediately registered the low rumble of Castiel's voice, and the angel was once again struck by how the man

“Uh,” said Castiel, glancing up at the board. “I haven’t…I’ve been a little distracted.”
A cloud seemed to pass over Castiel’s eyes.
"Don't you fuckin' dare!" the Dean on the phone said.
Seeing his beauty was only torture.
“No, that won’t be necessary. Water is enough.”
His mind touched, briefly, on Jonah and the whale.
so fucking weak for Cas, how had he never known it, admitted it to himself before?
But Castiel just watched him, placid and cold.

“I’m not a monster.”
He imagined being down on his knees in front of him, begging
And strange to say it, but Castiel suddenly heard laughter in his ears, ringing out – laughter familiar and loved.
Caught, embarrassed, humiliated, unable to hide his obvious erection or what he had just been doing, Dean, cowed, stepped into the room.
“What? Who is it?” he barked over his shoulder.
"You always were good at that sort of stuff," said Dean. "Some of those meals we had at the hunting lodge - "
He remembered the day like it was yesterday - and in the way angels measure time, it was.
“Why did you – why?”
After all, Oscar Wilde had travelled here extensively, and found acceptance.

"I'm yours, Cas.

And Castiel fell for Dean Winchester.
“On your knees.”
"Good," purred Dean, and then lifted himself up, slamming down onto Castiel, using his taut stomach as leverage as his hands slipped in the oil he had spread there.
They all turned to him as a body, startled by his sudden participation.
Castiel grinned and dove into the pool, surfacing again, as he decided to put an end to Dean’s misery.
Any right to the soft, mundane joys he had found there, in the angel’s arms. Or to the words of love kissed into his skin, or Castiel’s time or dedication or loyalty.

as he tipped his head forward again and his green eyes into the light.
Cas dropped this bombshell and then left him there holding it.
It began to rain.
And he was having a difficult time.
To my own 'Daniel', not that you will ever read this - I'm so sorry I let you down. I've been a coward for so long, too damned chicken to do what I promised you all those years ago and tell our story.
Many years ago, when I was in that place I mentioned - one of the bright moments (and there are bright moments, even in the most terrible places, during the most horrible events) was telling stories to the other children. It was always looked forward to, and a lot of fun, even if done in secret in the midst of some of the greatest horror I have ever heard of or known.
Dean laughed.
did not want to let go.
that desire to caretake,
Castiel had absolutely no satisfactory answer for Dean.
Then, he spread his wings.
It was the fearless who made stupid fatal mistakes, the fearless who were idiot enough to go into houses and asylums with a haunted history.
The shadows of the trees fell still and silent, in the long warm evening of the land.
Not that Dean wanted to admit that his legendary status with the ladies was a little more legendary than every monster they’d fought. Easy brag to his brother. No proof needed – or wanted, on Sam’s part.
“The fuck?” Dean demanded loudly, his hand tight on his bottle of beer. “Did he get mind-whammied or some shit?”
(all praise to the angel Castiel, who brings paradise unto him)
The laughter was snide now. The man stepped forward.
!" he shouted.
Still, Dean seemed to get the message, and hooked his hands beneath Sam’s armpits and started hauling him up the stairs into the doorway.
“The Shadow, of course,” he said pleasantly. “Well, at first I thought it was taking your form, but it usually prefers to let the wheels turn on their own, so to speak. Maybe it
He cleared his throat.
“Yeah? You know those guys? Johnny Appleseed and John Henry?” asked Dean.
“Well, you’re going to need to give me time on that one, Dean. I’ve spent quite a few years watching my older brother disappear up his own asshole.”
"You deaf or somethin'? He don't wanna go with you."
" she screamed.
There was water pouring down from somewhere nearby. When he managed to see through his swollen eyes he saw that there was a leak in the roof, water pouring down within a few feet.
It took Dean a long time to fall asleep, as he looked out over the city and wondered when, exactly, this had gone from
"I see that. I've brought you some of your things from the estate. There's more coming but it'll have to wait as it's the week-end."
“Do you think he’d remember those stories?” asked Dean. “They were pretty famous, after all.”
Dean looked at Sam, horrified.
“He says the tree was bleeding. Dying,” Castiel clarified. “And now that its spirit has returned, a new life in the tree and for the village.”
“I said I’ll try. What more do you want from me, damn.”
“I’m not going anymore,” he said. “I went somewhere else tonight.”
The Amalfi Coast is indeed stunning, and you should summer there ;)
"Here, Sam," Dean called back, finally breaking his stare, as Samuel emerged around a corner of the wood, smiling.
“You think it’s ringin’ a bell in there?” asked Dean, allowing himself to feel hope for the first time since they had arrived in the Shining City.
Dean, standing at the top of the staircase, while the maitre-d tried to hold him back.
He still sat stiffly on the lounge chair where Dean had left him.
Cas, for his part, was speechless.
and in this world –
“The tree ok?” asked Sam, mostly making conversation.
"Anyway," Dean said with a sigh, resuming his walk through the forest as Castiel followed, trying to keep his broken heart somewhat intact. "There's Winchester lands there now, Cas, but I don't know how I feel about the fact they were taken from the native people. Not much I can do about it now since the town's been built all around it and we've got what we've got. But it makes me uneasy all the same."
the - " Dean got out of his mouth, before a sort of
Castiel smiled, although of course Dean couldn’t see him.
“Losing your temper now is not going to end well for us,” Sam chided him gently. “But I get it. Believe me, I do. I hate seeing Castiel like this just as much as you do. He’s my friend too, you know.”
This story is partly based on the acceptance I myself found in the lgbtq community many, many years ago. In those days acceptance was offered no matter your sexuality, gender, etc. in which even ostracized straight people found a home. Times have changed but this is an example of the 80s-early 90s experience.
Somewhere, in the distance, Castiel cut through the water.
and he fucked once, hard, against Dean’s ass, making him gasp,
Just fascination and…something more.
Society did not reward those who did not cleave perfectly to its everyday demands, and was likewise ignorant that most of its demands were completely arbitrary.
“Say my name,” Castiel growled in his ear, holding Dean flush against his body. “Fucking say it.”
“Okay, okay, stop flirting,” said Sam, returning to the front. “I’m sorry about my brother, he just can’t seem to turn it off.”
Then he walked up to Castiel and clapped him on the shoulder.
He glanced behind himself now and again, but it seemed that Castiel hadn't stirred from their bed.
“What about Eileen?” he asked.
Sam closed his eyes and sighed angrily.
“Let go, Cas. I want it all. Whatever it is. C’mon. Let go.”
chapter title from a cheesy old song but a good one
Dean looked around himself, at the old familiar Roadhouse and the familiar faces and his inability to have a headache or feel annoyed or have any emotion more negative than vague pleasantness.
Alone.
Dean was taken aback -
Dean put a wide stick between its teeth, and then uncapped his whisky flask. He poured the liquid into the shellycoat's wound as it reared with the pain and Dean held it down.
"Wait, no," said Dean, feeling suddenly contrite. "I - tell me what's gonna happen. I gotta know."
Dean opened the bottle and poured a generous amount into his hand, then began opening himself up on a long, low moan.
Sam sat down in the pillows again and waited, resting his arms on his knees.
“Good afternoon,” said Castiel, hastening to the front of the church. “My apologies, I didn’t realize someone was waiting – here…”
"What?"
And Heracles sighed with another rueful shake of his head.
Which, obviously, is what 24/7 meant, but Dean hadn’t quite gotten it into his head that he’d have to deal with this man all up in his business at all hours of the day or night.
Dean looked up and stood stock-still for a moment when he recognised Castiel, as if he were frozen for some reason.
“I asked Dean if he’d tell me one of his stories,” said Sam, coming through in the clinch.
Then he vaguely became aware that he was wound like an octopus around the slumbering body of Castiel.
is right, asshat,” said Dean. “You don’t get to decide that shit, Cas! We figure it out, like we always do.”
But here, now, all he saw was Castiel, and the ravenous need inside him stoked higher as he stared the angel down.
“Long story,” said Dean. “So…yeah, I guess there’s
“Yeah,” said Sam. “But you’re gonna fill me in at some point. Promise?”
“They made that thing sized to you exactly,” said Dean. “Looks normal-sized in your hands.”
They talked for hours, while the place filled up, and it seemed like no time had passed at all.
“Well, he’s super tall, maybe he’s like an antenna.”
flitted through his mind.
"I was just thinking about Pompeii."
“I’m not sure, it’s just…call it a hunch. I think he believes that he’s still in the Empty.”
"I'm done in ten," he said, clocking the knowing looks of various girls who'd chanced it with him, and overhearing one mutter
Once he felt that he had something of a handle on himself, Castiel walked over to the bed and brushed a hand along Dean's spine, over the curve of his rear, and then took his hand away.
“Thing is, I think it works like prayer,” Dean was saying, via what Castiel could only assume was speaker phone. “A connection. A feedback loop, maybe – because that’s how I heard you, Cas.”
"Please what?" asked Dean. "Ain't that what you want to hear from me?
“Repentance.”
Mac laughed, and the wine was passed around again.
“Fine, fine,” said Castiel, and he went outside to breathe.
As the Lord looks on the sparrow,
” Castiel shouted in – terror? Horror? Awe?
Castiel's eyes darkened.
"I don't know if you've still got your clothing," said the man, rifling through some kind of chest.
He was beautiful, and that was the simple truth of it.
“Whatever. You know what I mean,” said Dean. “New rule, by the way. We don’t keep secrets from each other. This shit that went down in your life is just as bad as the shit that went down in mine.”
“Oh,” said Sam. “Well, I don’t want details – like,
After a while, his breathing slowed. He had fallen asleep.
“Human,” said Sam, a little impressed in spite of the circumstances, and a little fond. “This is the most human-looking structure in the whole place, I’d bet my life on it.”
Dean worked against him, fingers pressing deep where he was clutching Castiel, embarrassing sounds he couldn’t control if he wanted to coming out of his mouth.
"What didn't you do?" Scully returned, opening a pad of paper. "Grand larceny, serial murder - "
Castiel inched along the bed and stood up, landing soft and noiseless like a cat, on the balls of his feet, and walked toe-heel-toe toward the closet.
She turned to Sam.

The house – the mansion, really – was of the traditional island style, based on Moorish architecture. The central courtyard was stunning and draped with green ivy that hung from the upper windows. A fountain burbled in the center, where birds dove to take quick baths or drink. Flowers were evident everywhere, but the lawn around the fountain was trimmed and well-kept.
"What?" Now Dean was starting to get scared. "What is it? You're freakin' me out, man."
“And what are we gonna ask for on our last night of existence?” asked Dean. “Blowjobs and strippers?”
The door swung shut.
Dean and Castiel walked through the crowd to the place Heracles had indicated. They were amazed to see the tables were heaving with lamb, bottles and bottles of retsina wine, various pastries including spanikopita, and multiple other things he couldn't name.
Bright sunlight, green grass, blue skies.
Dean had no idea what hit him, because suddenly Cas was
in Castiel’s tone, like a man whistling as he moved something beneath the bed with his foot.
Castiel was about to respond.
“Well?” he asked. “C’mon. The people want to have a good time.”
on two legs. Its underneath was a hairy belly, like long grass hanging down.
"Don't hide from me, love," soothed Castiel. "Nothing to be embarrassed about, sweet one."
and Dean was head thrown back, willing to sip again at the bittersweet buttercup flavor he had chased within Castiel’s mouth, like that flower cup in the chocolate factory, an imaginary flavor he’d always wanted to taste, Castiel tasted like summertime and childhood and all the best most wonderful things of life and Dean was addicted in a second –
glad I didn't kill him."
"What is your color?" asked Castiel, perhaps sensing Dean's slight discomfort.
(See the end of the chapter for
But the desire made his head swim, being so close to something he had wanted for so long, and he was carried away on the madness of that tide.
And he was an angel who had set stars in the sky.
Dean woke to bright sunlight filtering through his windows.
“Deep fried cheese curd?”
Castiel led Dean out into his gardens, in the cool mist of the afternoon.
Castiel pinned him with those baby blues.
made his claim on Dean.
"We found out that a couple of killers wanted by the FBI, who were presumed dead, were apparently alive and well eating pie at a diner," said Mulder, finally tearing his eyes away from Castiel.
Then Castiel looked at Dean.
“Not that disrespectful nickname,” purred Castiel. “I want to hear you say my
taunted his brain, as Castiel and Sam both watched him expectantly.
“Guess you two saved the world,” said Gabriel. “No afterlife. Better be good while we’re here. However long that lasts.”
Dean had long ceased to pay attention in these things.
All present applauded, as he said:
"Hell," he said in an undertone, giving Castiel a once-over. "Or should I say heaven."
Now whether Castiel believed him
“Uh. Guys?”
Castiel caught him in his arms.
And with Sam complaining that it was against his better judgement, and how dangerous and stupid it was, they climbed out of the park and headed for the town in search of food.
Dean smiled up at him.
I have also noted that much of the road system has been neglected and that is something everyone should be concerned about, drifter or not. I am watching a country that claims to be one of the wealthiest on earth deteriorate before my eyes - I have seen better infrastructure in some third-world countries than what I have seen the roads collapsing into at this point in our history. Prices are up as well - fortunately I am not a part of what I'd call the 'captive American audience' as I can go wherever at will but it does concern me for those who stand still. I am somewhat amused to note that apparently 15/hr *is* possible for all these businesses that insisted it was not pre-pandemic, so perhaps there will be some progress there at least. When people are still making hourly wages like I was back in the 90s while having to pay out the nose for literally everything - there is a desperation in poverty and homelessness that is *not* by choice and I want everyone to remember that fact. Drifters, hobos, tramps, we chose this lifestyle because it suits us best and because it's what we found we wanted after trying the other options too. Others in this situation are not there by choice and it behooves us all to remember that this is the reason wages need to be far higher, rent far lower, etc. Just because I am a drifter does not mean that I cannot recognize these problems - in fact, I see more of them, more often, because I see so much of America. It's a major problem, perhaps one of the most important of our lifetimes, and with the end of the eviction moratorium it is set to get even worse.
“I trust you have drunk your fill by now,” growled Castiel, removing himself from Dean. “Leave me be.”
This was meant to be ridiculous, so I hope you have enjoyed this story and had some fun with it.
"Isn't it dangerous?"
an ancient Grecian figure scored immortalized in pottery,
“That place does not feature in your legend. And in this, all we legends must accept that our stories are what makes us, in the minds of the people.”
Castiel, as Dean could see through his lowered lashes, was caught halfway between something, struggling mightily as his hand had drifted closer, he looked completely insane with his desire, something caught so deep behind his ribs in the skin that Dean could almost
“Are you insinuating that you’re – you’re …”
"Hell yeah," said Dean. "Okay. So what is this one, again?"
“Hey sweetheart,” he said warmly.
Dean looked surprised at having admitted this out loud.
America is unique in that truck stops are a normal part of life, but in other parts of the world, such places either don't really exist or they don't have the proper infrastructure in place for them due to long-haul not usually being all that long - unless there is a major holdup, keeping trucks in one place for days on end. Then there are no bathrooms, no food places or showers, etc. Nobody's gonna sign up for that gig, believe me. There are currently companies that are changing the required rest times for truckers due to the shortage, and I shouldn't need to explain why you don't want exhausted people out there behind the wheel of a big rig. So there is a worldwide trucker shortage ongoing, again because of very stupid political decisions and, once again, the ignorance of both politician and layman of what is required from phytosanitary regulations all the way down to the rest periods of truckers to get items from point A to B.
"Good evening, gentlemen," said a newcomer, tall and lank, with long black hair and who looked led by his blade of a nose.
There was a syringe in it, filled with sickly yellow fluid.
What Dean felt was
“Love potion, perhaps?”
He leaned close.
Castiel stalked toward Dean.

Dean shouted, dropping it like a hot potato.
"Tildy chooses what room she sleeps in, here in the house," he said. "No pitiful cupboard under the stairs for her! The woman practically raised me. What do you think, Tildy? Will you be willing to give up your many rooms for these good people?"

“Fine, fine,” Dean choked out. “Ah – you?”
“Hm. I don’t know,” said Ishim. “Have you?”
Dean stared blankly at the dark windows and sliding-glass door to the yard and wondered if someone had been standing out there, watching them.
Just as he was about to get into his car, another thought struck Dean.
"Yeah?" Dean asked, and then tossed the envelope on the bed. "How d'you like
"We sure these people didn't just drown?" Dean asked. "I mean they wrote
There was another
"Remember how we could relax in the shade of the palm trees at Castiel's, and the weather was just right?" Sam persisted.
But he had also realized something.
"Her?!" asked Dean. "I told her she wasn't good enough for my brother, and using him to get to me was a low blow. I told her to stick it where the sun don't shine."
Dean's entire self fritzed out and went offline for a few seconds.
And suddenly, unexpectedly, the whole world was filled with light.
“You aren’t going to do that, are you?” he asked. “This wasn’t the plan all along, was it?”
"I must apologise," he said haltingly. "Something happened -"

His voice was playful, but with a dark undercurrent that threatened to sweep Castiel away.

Castiel's hands were shaking.
But he stuck his chin out anyway and said:
But that was all right.
Dean suddenly realized he was shouting and calmed the fuck down.
"We wouldn't get home," said Castiel. "Although I suspect that if those feelings weren't there in some fashion, we wouldn't have made our way here in the first place."
Castiel pressed his thumb against Dean’s lip gently.
Sam stuck his fork in his salad, and smiled that secret smile Dean absolutely hated.
Dean had a faded memory like an old photograph of listening to Simon and Garfunkel while clutching the bottle to his chest and weeping at the beauty of the lyrics and music.
The news, when it arrived in the little pueblo, was often harsh and sudden. The
Dean surveyed the area around him and saw that the people were holding back those who would try to come onto the land, even chasing them down the streets. The jubilant cries of the citizens as they held the town reminded Castiel of the great love of
“You know,” he said, “You’re right about that, but there’s something different with you when it comes to him. More intense. I don’t know.”
“My wish is your command, huh.”
“Sorry,” he ground out. “Black coffee. Please.”
over and over again.
Yet I've often found that Spain and Portugal are entirely missing from the usual romanticization of Europe in the American mind.
Castiel sighed.
The sickly-sweet familiarity of hangover, like a sugar overdose direct to the brain, may have faded, but its memory remained there like an afterimage burned into his brain.
“They’ve been cruelly tricked. Something like
Other servants appeared, surrounding them.
Castiel found Dean easily. He was at the back of the tavern, seated at a candlelit table. There was a woman sitting in his lap. She was wearing a dirty dress with her breasts pushed up and nearly falling out of it. Dean had one arm around her waist and was clutching a mug of ale in his other hand as he leaned listlessly against the wall.
“Just don’t, okay?”
On a long, low moan, he pushed inside that impossibly tight heat as Dean yelled, and Castiel healed him, but the angel was relentless now in pursuit of his claim and shoved Dean's face down into the coverlet as he held his hips and drove into him again and again.
He remembered where he’d heard that kind of talk most and was tired of this kind of behavior from other men. Like it was the only and single way to be a man and if you didn’t fit the mold, then you weren’t a man at all.
"Don't want to," he mumbled.
and suddenly Castiel was coming, on a relieved whine as he spread his hands up Dean’s back, caressing him and leaning down to kiss the sweat-damp hair at the nape of his neck, and he shuddered as he milked the last of his orgasm, thrusting slowly into Dean as it overflowed and dripped onto the bed beneath him, sticky-white.
” he bellowed at the empty yard.
– I wanted you to spin me around and fuck me then and there, I didn’t know it then, but –
After a moment, he lowered his eyes.
Castiel gave Sam a questioning look.

"Go to sleep, Dean," Castiel grumbled from behind him. "You think too loud."
only served to make him feel guiltier still.
The blush that Castiel felt creeping up his neck might be excused by the dawning heat of the day.
What else could he do?
"I was

"All souls are housed in vessels," said Castiel. "Not unlike angels. You'd be no less

She looked at the entire crowd standing on the stoop.
Castiel turned his face away.
“How do I get?”
The angel reached out with two fingers and touched his forehead.
"Sir?"
Dean took all this in with something akin to amazement.
Castiel deepened the kiss with a sigh of relief, and freedom.
“Now that you know,” said Dean, through gritted teeth, “c’mon, Cas, be with me now.”
California, not LA," said Sam, petulant, but Dean could see him wavering. "Are you
“First it’s fuckin’ freezing, now I’m melting into the damned seat,” complained Dean.
The Shining City was exactly as advertised.
Take care of yourselves out there, and come back to the campfire when you can.
Dean thought.
Castiel had often found it reassuring.
to go back to that store, Sam!”
“Look,” said Dean. “I’ve been a real tool for years. Let’s call it – I don’t know. There’s been an attempt on my life. Kinda makes you rethink some things.”
"Sam's always worried," Dean said, taking a drink of ale around the girl in his lap.
“Thanks,” he said.
The more and more we give it away.
"I ... don't know how else to be."
“How bad do we need this charger cable?”
“I think that’s quite enough talk out of you,” snapped Castiel.
“Upset?” asked Dean. “Hell no. They just see it as another reason for a party. They’re already making this a new holiday in their calendar. Fireworks and all. Least that’s what Sam told me the people were talking about when they walked by earlier.”
Castiel was hard, and was only vaguely aware of what to do about it.

The cat gave a soft mewl and then hopped into Dean’s lap, turning around once before snuggling up to him. It started to knead its claws into his jeans.

“Ha ha, classic Dean,” he said.
Dean's confusion about where he is on the US map has happened to me frequently - one memorable time I was on the pay phone to a friend who asked where I was, and it was raining heavily. "I think I'm in Mexico," I said, and my friend laughed, because that doubt is relatively common when you live on the road.
Castiel understood, then, why Dean so often spoke of beaches and of holidays – he looked like he belonged here, among the fair and the green.
They called him the

Then he said:

He was so beautiful Castiel could barely look at him.
Garbled though it was, Dean looked up at Castiel, hesitant, hoping the message had gotten through.
Open, sacrificial, absolute submission.
Dean was no longer obstinate.
Dean had never been able to say no to food, so he did as his brother had asked.
Not by anything.
"And now?"

Strange, the mimicry down on Earth for the horrors perpetrated by those above, but of course, they wouldn’t be aware.
"I take it you're familiar with BDSM," he said softly.
I think it's important here to note: remember the past and the unbelievable fights that it took to get us here. And that the fight for rights must continue with vigilance or you will absolutely lose them (note the recent insanity with Texas and abortion). People are *always* looking to snatch our victories away.
“Look,” said Castiel sharply. “Even if you
It would have to be enough.
Rodeo Drive was a new experience for Dean.
He had better things to do.
“What was with all that conversion therapy story, anyway?” asked Dean.
Dean motioned to Sam to cover him as he moved into the room, the wide-open living room that led into the garden and the swimming pool as well as the kitchen.
Right at the Texas border, they saw a tall Black man walking in the heat of the day.
But it is now.
but Dean remained steadfast, ignoring him throughout dinner and the dessert course.
"Well, we kinda are, I guess," he said.
“Let us go. Now,” Castiel growled, his eyes blue with grace for emphasis.
So my life has mostly been going from place to place, getting odd jobs here and there.
It still hummed, a little, but it looked relatively harmless.
"And what of it?" Castiel demanded. "Am I to be forever your servant, your valet, your gentleman's gentleman? Always held at arm's length, a secret, something to take out every so often when you wish to scandalise the local gentry?"
There was a hand in Castiel's crotch.
He watched the angel swim, powerful strokes across the tranquil calm of the bay encircled with palm trees. His arms, his body, everything about him like a taut physical example of perfection.
“You know I – I,” Dean gasped, as his hand found their cocks and he stared down between their bodies as if this act were something holy, “I meant what I said, Cas, every word of it.”
Dean sat in the window and watched the world go by as he held his book on his lap. He knew he’d need to get back to the apartment and Sam later that night. They hadn’t spent much time together recently and he was due for ribbing Sammy mercilessly for having a girlfriend.
“Because I want to take care of you.”
He realized that the man didn’t know that the persianas - the blinds in his own window - were diaphanous. He could see through them to the street but they blocked the sunlight and kept him hidden from view.

And there, Dean saw the crack in his armor.

more singing, and a lot more drinking, but it’s difficult to put down in words because the tale grows in the telling. Storytelling, for us, is an interactive experience, and nobody knows what will happen in the narrative – even the storyteller – apart from the few broad strokes expected. So the teller will embellish it with other things, songs, poetry, etc. while the audience hoots and argues with the storyteller and each other. Sometimes (as is the case in this one) the teller will involve other beloved characters; I am told the ancient Greeks would do the same. I think our method of storytelling is probably one of the oldest around.

They left the restaurant then, supporting each other's weight as they walked out into the chill night air.

He walked the streets unremarked, during fiesta. There were enough visitors to the little town that he was able to slip into the crowd.
Dean looked up at the wing Castiel had draped over him like a canopy and ran a hand along the feathers. The eyes on the wings closed and Castiel sighed in contentment.
“Please, Castiel,” Dean murmured. “Please.”
For every day Castiel deigned not to kill him, Dean would stem the tide. But in doing so, he would only manage to save his own life. It was true that no other humans had died since his arrival, but he wasn’t certain that those humans would consider him a hero.
After the third ring, he answered.
That something like Dean –
Dean smiled, and set down his drink so he could pet her.
“You don’t have to go,” murmured Castiel. “You can spend the night.”
“This is why America is fat.”
"May I ask why? Is it something I've done?"
Unvoiced, he was asking

in more ways than one.
Maybe he was right.
"I have, sir."
"Name it," said Castiel. "Anything you want, it's yours."
He wondered if this was what it felt like to fall in love.
Then, the horrible thought crossed his mind:
“Castiel,” he boomed out.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
Dean took a deep breath, because none of this was easy.
"Anything," said Dean, leaning on the heel of his hand and staring at Castiel with a fond, dopey grin. "Name it. It's yours."
“You mean you – ” he spluttered. “And me? I didn’t think you could, you had, I don’t know, the equipment.”
2. Dean is a real idiot if he's been running around the country having unprotected sex all this time. I know a lot of this stuff is just made-up straight (stationary) male fantasy - I say 'stationary male' because any drifter/hobo/tramp, male, female, or otherwise, would know better. I have serious doubts there are any drifters, current or former, on that writing team. Knowing the real-life aspects, you gotta keep it clean out there if you're gonna do the road-slut thing. And those who do that, do it for pay, and those paying are generally men. It's a lot more difficult to behave the way Dean does and get his results, which is why I tend to write him as faking the ladies-man thing for Sam's benefit. You can be the hottest dude around and chicks will not touch you if you are a drifter, for the usual logical reasons. The kinds that will, readily, most drifters won't touch, and are often all the more reason to keep it clean in the first place. We are a little germaphobic as it already stands - no reason to acquire anything unnecessary just to get your dick wet. There's no universal healthcare in this country and that is just...not something anybody needs to deal with when they live on the road.
Sam stood behind Castiel with a thunderstruck expression.
And, shuddering, Castiel closed his eyes, stepping back from Dean –
Screw it. He was pissed.
"Dean," said Castiel, "that was - "
“Okay,” said Castiel, doubt lacing his voice. “If you think it’s best.”
"Wonderful," said Dean.
“Cas! Do you want the English to get their grubby hands on our island?”

Dean watched Castiel.
“Is it getting cold in here?” he asked.
“Sam – Sam, help me – ”

"Attaboy."

"Good. Because either way, I'd like to take you to bed."
Dean opened his eyes.
"That's true," said Sam. "I haven't seen anything
It was a delicate ache, and a dream he had no desire to fracture.
Castiel laughed a little and said:
“I…” he began, and then trailed off.
Utterly, wholly, by a creature divine
"He is shy," said Castiel.
“That was shitty of me and I’m sorry,” he said. “Can we start again?”
Later, after Castiel had cleaned and tidied the wrecked motel room, they lay together in the warm bed, wrapped in each other, listening to the rain.
“Sucks to be you,” said Dean, as he dropped the body unceremoniously back into the water. “Newsflash, asshat.
Because for whatever reason, Dean couldn't stay away from Castiel.
“I sensed a very intense…longing,” said Castiel, suddenly very interested in the ceiling.
And then he had turned him over, Dean facing downward, and began to open him up, quiet and sweet, but with an intensity building and bordering on madness.
“I do.”
there are still Burma-Shave signs dotting the countryside along highways once homes of Indian tribes leaving marks left marks left heart of the nation, scouring out the insides;
"Yes," Dean confirmed.
Later that night, Dean showed up as Castiel was unlocking his door, and bracketed him with his arms. Wordless, he kissed him, rough and clumsy, and Castiel kissed back. They were pulling at each other then, sudden and frantic, and Castiel dropped his keys on the sidewalk twice before he finally got them inside.
“I will not have you speak to me that way,” he said.
Sam was comforting him on the couch.
"Sorry about that asshole," murmured Dean, and Castiel smiled as he was led away, onto the dance floor, and straight into a dream.
Dean didn’t want to ascribe anything further to his actions outside. Didn’t want to think what it might mean anyway since he’d never looked at dudes like that before and –
“Tell me you want this,” Cas said, soft and sure. “I want to hear you say it out loud, Dean.”
Dean picked up the tiny fork and poked at the plate in front of him.
to find Dean standing in the kitchen, pointing at Garth, whose arm was around Bess.
Castiel stood alone in his quarters, wondering whether he even
Dean frowned.
The 'king cake' is also still practiced in places like New Orleans in the USA with their Spanish history, and of course México celebrates Three Kings' Day too, along with much of the Spanish-speaking world.
But everything seemed to pale and fade away beyond the wild brightness of Dean, whose arms were around him, whose entire world was now Castiel, if only for a brief moment.
I don’t know.”
“Quiet on the set. Sound?"
And he blushed again.
“Yeah, Sam, I just told you that. Try to keep up.”
it's awesome.
"I wanted to tell you," she said, resuming her work as she poured gravy into the little pie-pots, "for two reasons. One, so that you would know - you're not alone here, Castiel."
The door swung shut.
because you are not an angel.
“Sam. Details.”
"They will crown us with laurels, just you wait!" promised Pasion.
and then vanished into thin air, with the faint sound of beating wings.
“Well, you are my employee, right?” Dean asked. “You have to do as I say?”
“You old dog,” he said. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
Sam looked behind himself.
But Dean didn't get to finish his sentence, because something had slithered around his leg and yanked him to the ground as he shouted.
“And he’s gone for good? Not in the Empty?”
We should all take a moment to feel kind of bad for giant squid and the articles people write about them with total glee. A personal favorite was the always-professional National Geographic with 'Indiscriminate Squid Just Implanting Everyone With Sperm'. It's a tough old life for a squid.
“I take it you don’t want details.”
sort of thing, Cas. Besides, taking a monster’s virginity? I mean that’s a hell of a notch on the bedpost.”
“Because I dreamed of it long before I saw it,” he said under his breath. “And I’ve never understood the reason, but – something drew me here.”
now that he understood that this was reality.
He approached Dean, whose explanation he most needed to hear.
"I thought - I thought you'd abandoned me. Because I am so evidently a monster."
But the types who look down on my type are not always the cleverest people I’ve known. I’ve known many a wiser old hobo than anybody in tweed I’ve run into within the hallowed halls of academia.
It's true: they build human castles in this part of Spain, called 'castelles' or 'muixeranga'.
Besides...they had a date.
“Yes, those things and more,” Castiel said, as he opened his eyes again. “Like I told you – I want to take care of you.”
The door was open, so he got out of the winter cold and closed it.
“This isn’t funny, Dean,” he said. “Michael and Lucifer will stop at nothing. They want this outcome, the war, the apocalypse.”
“If I never – like. If I can’t let you touch me like that. Like hugging, or – or cuddling. Then what?”
Cas's face was cracking now, his jaw warping even more strangely.
Castiel was glad it had been Dean.
This time, it was as if Castiel couldn't get enough of him, kissing him, touching him, jacking him off fast and intense as he lay next to the bright water and came all over his stomach with a groan.
I never hit the same rock bottom as other drunks have done. But that doesn't mean I never hit various things that would be rock bottom for other people. This is another lie it tells:
Castiel could feel his soft breath on the skin of his cheek.
that would be the downfall of him one day.
"Hello, Dean," said Castiel like a very old iron gate that needed oil in its hinges.
, if I do say so myself."
“Ah, ye’re jist jealous of my wealth,” said Mac. “Supply and demand economics, my friend.”
He meekly followed Castiel out the door without another word.
“Damn straight,” said Dean, and he laid a kiss on Castiel right there in the diner in front of Sam and (probably) God and everyone.
And he handed Balthasar the weapon he had used, then vanished.
“Like I said, that was for
, his favorite human sacrificing himself with praise for the angel on his lips –
“I’ve commanded armies for centuries, Dean Winchester,” Castiel said drily. “I will take your lack of faith in me under advisement.”
and he realized, vaguely, that all they had done so far was kiss.
“No,” whispered Castiel, flinching when Dean tried to touch him. “No, no, no – ”
Small-town life, maybe the standstill-life in general didn't work for him. He'd spent most of the day at the phone company and all he got for his troubles was a headache and a promise that somebody would be out there to check on it soon.
groans as his entire body seized and he came again, deep inside of Dean.
“I will,” said Castiel. “I do, too. With all of my being. All that I am, or have been, or will be, is in love with you.”
he thought.
“We will be returning to the motel now,” said Castiel.
Not everyone chooses to drift, as I’ve mentioned before. My own story, which I have very dimly outlined here before because I felt it necessary, is one of the most terrible I have ever heard – but only discovered how terrible it was by comparison, once I was old enough to find out. That’s the thing about horror, it isn’t always clear when you’re living through it, or how awful it really is. I didn’t realize it myself until I finally told a telephone counselor about it and they got sick – literally. So I try to be a little circumspect about some of these things, because I honestly think that many people really have no idea what kinds of things happen out there – bad enough that I sure hope you don’t have the mentality to even come up with them.
Dean never saw him much outside the room they had designated for him, but he was vaguely aware of the angel’s presence.
might mean –
"Dean."
Dean looked down into his hand again.
“Cream or sugar?”
Castiel circled once, and then dropped down gently onto the deck of the ship.
"Dean! Sam!
But with Dean –
There was a mountain in the middle of the highway.
“Okay,” said Dean, and kissed him again.
Castiel went bright red.
“Logging camp breakfast,” said Bunyan, by way of explanation.
sure.
Stay safe out there, everybody.
Then, he came forward into the murky half-light of the cave.
“Hi, Dean.”
"And you wouldn't wish it on me otherwise, but -"
All he wanted was his freedom, to enjoy it after so many years kept imprisoned in that town.
“And what can I do for you gentlemen today?” asked the man, kindly and cheerful.
“Oh, and there was this thing I said to Cas, offhand,” Dean said. “He was talking about being a vampire and I told him that it didn’t work to stake ‘em through the heart, they need to be – ”
As a seal upon your arm
Dean, spluttering half-formed words behind him, could do nothing but follow.
They were one, no longer two of them, and it fascinated and terrified Dean in equal measure.
“Yes, little mate,” cooed Castiel. “Present for me.”
All we are is dust in the wind...dude. - Ted (Theodore) Logan
Dean gave him an odd look.
"Hello?" an old woman said, almost simultaneously, in his ear.
Then he slowly winked.
“Yeah. Fuck yeah, Cas,” Dean muttered.
"You're beautiful," Castiel said, soft and worshipful.
He watched the game for a moment.
But he was the only angel not to visit home from time to time.
“I love you, Castiel,” Dean murmured –
"Garth sure doesn't do things by halves," Dean said. "I'm
Sam said he got rid of that thing.
Castiel walked down the small set of stairs leading into the dining area and smiled at him.
” he muttered into his pillow.
“Chocolate chip or M and M?” asked Bernice, in a voice a little more kindly than the ones she had used with Dean before.
Dean, impossibly, fell a little more in love.
Both of them lonely in the world, and found each other.
feel himself soothed, just by listening to the tone and timbre of Castiel's gentle voice.
"Thank you," said Castiel, and Garth nodded, disappearing from the doorway.
“This is some cryptic shit, what the hell’s goin’ on?” asked Dean.
He loved to watch Dean in slumber; in this, he finally understood those paintings and figures so loved by those artists like Rembrandt, like Waterhouse, like the ancient Greek sculptures of sleeping nymphs, like Leighton’s
"I see."
The conversation was stilted and strange, unlike the easy cameraderie they had enjoyed for years while Castiel privately pined away for his charge.
And he gave his brother a despairing look as if that would explain everything.
"I've had a few days to come to grips with the idea that we might not exist," said Mulder. "What are we, if we only exist in the world of television? Is everyone on earth just a part of someone's late-night show?"
Dean stared up at Castiel, moving in him, relentless like waves against the shore.
“Good,” purred Castiel, who was still fully clothed, staring down at him with that laser-focused intensity.
As a creature, he did not have any concept of this aspect of the world, and he wondered if he might have been better off simply cutting the flowers and bringing Dean breakfast, to bask in the glow of his proximity, never to have touched the man at all.
“I told you, I didn’t know it was drugs.”
He took a stroll in the fresh air of the evening, surprised a little at how good it felt getting out of the cigar fug and breathing the night air beneath a past-sunset sky littered with stars.
Castiel gave him a sharp look. Dean caught it and his smile widened.
“Who told you that crap?” Dean asked.
“I miss him so much.”
it, and it was driving Dean wild as well -
He briefly touched his shoulder, where Castiel was well-aware of the brand, burned into his memory likewise.
“Gabriel led me to believe that…when I get my memories back I might not like what I find. I might not – think of Castiel the same way. I can’t even imagine that right now, dude. I can’t imagine a world where I don’t – where I don’t.”
Castiel waited.
"Good night, Dean."
The angel sat on the porch in a wooden rocking chair, looking out over the rolling hills beyond the trees, as the sun began to set and the skies of the Kansas prairies turned to gold.
"Shit," Dean whispered again, before he finally got his shattered brain back together and hauled ass off the bed, out the door and into the hallway, busting into Cas's room where he found the man on the bed against the wall,
Castiel said it flat, as if he had expected it; as if he had already known.
“Lawrence, Kansas.”
Respectful, hopeful. Filled with wonder at this strange creature that did not seem to fear him, but wished to draw him closer.
Castiel didn't need Dean to reciprocate.
“Then send along your schedule and I’ll figure out a good day.”
Dean kicked him under the table.
Dean began to pray.
It was suddenly cold, and dark.
Castiel trailed off as the man stood and grinned at him.
“Dean. How nice of you to join us. Castiel.”
Dean chuckled in the back of his throat.
So...
When he started to push in, the broken
“That’s fine, Dean,” said Castiel softly. “Then may I lay beside you and hold your hand? Would that be all right?”
“Tell him to staaaayyyy, oh my
“Nothing I can think of. You wanna give me a for-instance here?”
“Yeah, but,” Dean said, gearing himself up for the big reveal. “They were about, uh. You.”
He didn't answer it.
And then Castiel knelt on the bed behind him, moving out of him slightly and making Dean gasp; then fucking back into him on a hard thrust that made Dean cry out again.
Dean yawned then and stood, walking bare across the wooden floor and the carpet, as Castiel's eyes followed him.
“We’re alone,” Sam reminded him.
Maybe it was the sudden shock of the cold, maybe it was the fresh air, but Dean had an intense and sudden
"Gotta break something, may as well be this," said Dean. "What time is it?"
“That was – the other night, and all the -
Harsh and unforgiving, the lines of Castiel’s face were hard.
"Somebody besides me."
class, Castiel."
He expressed this by drawing his brows together, but as Dean wasn't facing him, he didn't see it.
"And the other thing," said Dean. "I'm sure - I'm
c'mon, Cas,
Sam was edging around the perimeter of the room, and Dean started talking faster.
"I - I like it when you touch me there," he said.
“Not that,” he said. “Well, that, and also, this other stuff. You know the urban legend of the Vanishing Hitchhiker?”
Vulnerable, open, writhing, ready for him.
yep, had this song in my head since I first got the idea :)
“What
Dean gave his brother a beseeching look.
He waited to see what kind of response this elicited in Castiel, but all he found were those blue eyes watching him with their familiar warmth and serenity.
"Yes, we all know what you were engaged in," said Arachne.
"Pleased to help," said Castiel, stepping forward. "Castiel, of the Winchester Estate. This is Mr. Dean Winchester."
or something like that.
cut hard across his consciousness.
“Excuse me, Sam,” he interrupted. “But I have a question.”
“God, yeah, that’s it, spread yourself for me, give yourself to me,” Castiel chanted softly.
“Always,” he said softly. “It’s such a – a
“What’s with that, by the way?” Dean asked. “When we met, you didn’t speak a word of English.”
And he moved again, and Dean was hard again, sobbing and weeping with the intensity of his need and desire, mindless, held conquered and captive, as Castiel pressed Dean’s hand hard against the place where he could feel the angel making his absolute claim, and shuddered and came again, helpless, as Castiel laughed against his shoulder.
“You kiddin’ me?” said Dean, as they walked together. “In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m kinda
suddenly -
“Really?” he asked, in a tone akin to wonder.
Dean glanced at Castiel as if to confirm this fact.
Suddenly, he doubled over in pain, a shout that turned into a scream as he collapsed.
Sam sighed.
“Try praying to Cas?” asked Sam.
“Yeah,” Dean pressed on. “Yeah. I just. I think it’s time I made a change. Positive change. You know.”
“So you saw – ”
“This is really stupid, Sam – ”
He smiled, a little unsure, and pointed at the wall.
Hiding himself, still, from Castiel.
Or something.
Sam began to fade away like old newsreel.
Things were different.
They kissed again.
Now Castiel understood the truth of his friend's words, but was helpless to understand what he might do about them.
“That is probably the best analogy, yes.”
"I'd like you to join me, if I went. If you would."
“Uh. Well. I bought it at the bakery, if that counts.”
No hesitation, just passion and pent-up fury.
Dean is such a tool.
Dean peered into the room.
In my first year on the road, I learned the following:
"What's that supposed to mean?"
Castiel seemed very invested in the story at this point.
“This is fucking weird!”
“Why did you want a love potion?” asked Castiel. “It seems to me that you have enough interest from others not to need one. Vastly smaller numbers than you pretend to your younger brother, but you never struck me as a man disappointed in love.”
He thought of the creature's hands on his wings, warm and comforting, the way he had responded so beautifully, as if the creature were shameless in his desire to bring Castiel pleasure.
Thoughts of Cas on his mind as he took himself in hand, he moaned a little, the sound echoing off the tiles in what he was very quickly reminded was a
Dean had never wanted this much, felt this intensity of need. And it didn’t seem to stop, or fade, just continued onward, and if he thought it had been intense before, that intensity only deepened.
“Well, hi to you too, Sammy,” said Dean, a little rankled that he apparently hadn’t been missed at all.
I get a lot of
Dean looked down at the ticket, and then up at Castiel.
Then her face switched back, all pleasant smiles.
He had to admit that he thought Sam wouldn’t
He kissed the cross of his rosary and then squared his shoulders, and walked out to meet Dean in the courtyard.
Sam patted him, obviously not seeing the similarity
He had been working as a curate for the little pueblo some years now, and had grown fond of the island and its people, with a particular fondness for the pueblo itself.
“Cas, what if you lead him straight to me? Isn’t that what you were worried about?”
until Castiel's grip tightened and he laid his final claim as he laid his palm in the place where he had laid it once before, red and raised;
“I have a confession to make.”
and they were made of stained glass, like church windows, high and colorful, arching behind him.
“Well yeah, but I don’t do it with airquotes. Call it part of your charm.”
He slowly lowered his gun.
“It was an indiscretion,” he said. “It was infidelity.”
And there, on his knees, where no one could see him, Dean Winchester wept.
It was cold, and the air in the car had turned clammy.
He only hoped that Castiel would hear them.
One of my favorite films, The Haunting (of Hill House, the original), mentions that both the original ghost story and Eleanor's life related to someone caretaking for someone else long-term - and then, at a decisive moment, taking some time for themselves. This comes up as Eleanor saying she was selfish, but Dr Markway tells her she was fed up and tired - and human. Everyone deserves their own life and their own choices, not to disappear into someone else's, no matter what.
"That wasn't my intention. I'm sorry."
“No, you suck at research, I’m doing it. But I don’t think – hey, wait a minute.”
Sam was here, so that was good.
“I will return by and by,” he said. “I don’t understand your eagerness to spend time with me. I will kill you in the morning.”
“Do you know what’s going on here?” he demanded.
He brushed a hand across one of Dean's nipples, and Dean gasped as if he'd undergone electric shock.
What the world would look like, after they’d gone home, after he’d known Cas like that –
and…”
"I wish I could see his wings," said Mulder wistfully.
"Bugger off," said one of the men lolling near the door.
Better not to even try.
"That is the way it is done."
"Rolling."
The Antagonist hopped lightly into his lap from somewhere.
Castiel had shoved into him.
long years,” said Sam, eyes lifted toward heaven. “Pray for Sam.”
"Leave him be," said Castiel.
“You’re more than a weapon, Dean. You’re not just a blunt instrument to be used,” said Castiel.
If he was going to feel Castiel's hands on his skin, he wanted to know they were real.
“Stuffed piquillo peppers.”
“Then this is the perfect start to your vacation,” said Dean. “Best molecules on the planet, trust me.”
"Okay," said Dean, a little unsure, now focused far more on the line of Castiel's body pressing up against his own. "Can we come back here tomorrow, though? I want to take a look around, see if I can figure out what's making that noise."
Castiel gave Dean a reproachful glare.
Which, in Dean’s life, was an absolute first.
Castiel walked forward and Dean followed him, until they were both swallowed up into the night.
“They – the people, they, would take one of us kids and. And. Do stuff, uh. To us. We never did figure out their schedule, although there was one. They – we were fed like how dogs and cats are, bowls. You know. Bathroom, at least – they let us out a couple times a day and you only have so many accidents when you are living in a cage before.”
I hope you are all doing as well as can be expected in these strange times.
“I’m sure you have a wonderful personality,” he said.
Then he cut off a piece and tried it, apparently appreciating the experience, if not the food itself.
Castiel stared at him, caught.
“Whether we can trust Castiel.”
“I think we gotta bring him with us.”
"I am Castiel, and this is Dean," said Castiel.
"Like peacocks."
it all was, how free and easy he felt.
He thought of his dream and the hunger for it, the absolute
“The, uh. Longing way.”
Had he been?
like that book by Bradbury
immortal unknown
The type, Dean had often assured him while they watched action films together, to monologue.
He set the Tang down on the dresser and fell back on his bed with a groan.
But he recognized a prayer meant for him alone.
He stared at his reflection, then splashed water in his face and drew a hand down it.
Then Castiel walked out the door with his prize, and no one dared to intercept him.
beautiful and white and spread all across the floor, shining in the early-morning sunlight.
"We really are a couple of suckers, huh," said Dean.
Sam glanced at them.
He crawled over him, the wings spread wide and draped across the floor of the room, barely containing them.
He was fighting with one of the men on the sandy beach (because sand offers more resistance and helps the warrior in his skill, according to their commander, who Dean learned was called Pelopidas), when something caught his eye.
“Oh my God, you weren’t kidding,” said Dean through a mouthful of food, which he swallowed after remembering himself. “This is
"I have to do some work with my brother, Sam," Dean informed him.
"Dean Winchester," said Castiel, holding his gaze. "My answers to you will forever be these three: Yes. Always. And anywhere."
“Dean, I feel like I’ve been really good about indulging this whole thing, including this
Castiel turned away from him then, because he couldn't keep looking at Dean without knowing his own iron resolve was crumbling faster than he'd ever expected.
It was his leading lady.
“No! I’m an angel,” she said. “Leviticus.”
“Agreed. But we might be of better use to them where we can offer our assistance,” said Castiel, and nodded toward the ships on the water, where the initial firefight was taking place.
Sam could do nothing but nod.
"Do you - " he breathed out, harsh. "No. No, I won't accept that, I watched you walk outta here once already, I'm not gonna -"
"Hippie."
"It’s what hunters do. It's what
Right.
"Name's Dean," Dean said, sticking out a hand.
They paid the bill and made their way outside, back to the motel again.
Dean stared at him for a moment. Then he laughed.
The maybe-incubus guy?
“It’s one of the only things I remember right now,” he said. “Castiel…he confessed. He told me he loved me, Sam. And – and I was so damned…I don’t know, shocked? Scared? I don’t know! And I couldn’t – I didn’t say it back, I didn’t say
"I love you, Dean," he sighed. "So very much. Did you know that?"
His back wept with oil, gleaming in the low light, his wings absolutely sodden with it, as he did as he had long desired, and worshiped at the altar of Dean.
Strange, and also somehow…
“Paul Bunyan!” cried out everyone at the campfire, some of them clapping in delight.
He was dealing with death threats and the new addition of Castiel to his world.
“He is handsome,” said Pasion, and Heracles tucked him into his shoulder.
Castiel's mouth worked, but nothing came out apart from:
There was a knock at the door.
“Castiel,” he said.
him, that love was washed through all the essence of him, in the marrow of his bones now, in the delicate veins of his eyes, and he was breaking, breaking, breaking uncontrollably and helpless, the waves washing through him and through him and through him like the endless relentless water of the sea, drowned and drowning, and yet still drawing breath, and Dean fell to the ground, his forehead touching the earth, or what stood in for it here in the great void.
Sam made a face.
“Father,” he greeted the angel warmly.
Then he turned around and made an offering of himself unto Castiel, on all fours in supplication, head down on the mattress beneath him.
” the angel cried out, deep voice rough and ragged, as his hand scrabbled uselessly against Dean’s back for a moment.
And it
But Dean was kissing Castiel, and they paid him no mind.
“C’mere.”
"Game?" repeated Cas.
And that ain’t much.
Dean wheeled around to see Castiel, lit much as Mulder had been, in the streetlight, shadowed by ebony wings -
And here, words repeated again and again, filled with hate, spat out like tickertape language in a Mobius strip:
Then comes the dread –
"Very funny," said the guy on the other end. "Look. I'm you. From the future."
They were breathing each other’s air, noses close enough to touch, and Dean was completely off-kilter. His cock was dripping wet, absolutely filthy with it, and he just kept moaning and whining into Castiel’s mouth with how fucking
“Uh, and the prostitute, she, she went to – she was – ”
He felt the loss of Dean like a limb had been ripped from him -
“None of your beeswax,” said Dean.
“Dean – ”
The pain in Dean’s right side slowly dissipated, until he could sit up against the Impala.
Then he grabbed the whisky bottle just as Dean was about to pour Whisky 3, also meaning that Dean wasn't given much time to ruminate on that particular facial expression of Castiel's, which was the plan for Whisky 4 and 5.
“Dean,” Castiel said in a warning tone.
“Michael,” Castiel said flatly, looking for all the world like the same man in the trenchcoat.
Samuel smiled, discomfort leaving his expression with a smile. He patted Castiel on the shoulder.
"Thank you for saving mine," he told Garth.
The man’s eyes seemed to sharpen like a knife.
“Then no! No thank you, Dean. I’ll just sit here and wait patiently until another version of you comes along, because the big difference between in here and out there is that all of you
“Whuh,” Castiel said, blearily, as he woke up. “Dean. What are you doing here?”
" said Sam. "But this guy wants you to what, be his escort or something?"
Then Castiel paused on the sand.
“I – I – okay,” said Dean, wondering how the hell he got himself into this situation and why he seemed to be okay with it.
Finally, Castiel released him, and stood, Dean's equal once again, but as ever and always, so much more.
Castiel nodded, and awaited Balthasar’s explanation.
This question absolutely derailed him. What was he supposed to say?
“It’s this or nothing,” Castiel reminded him.
Sky and sea and sand.
Dean found himself avoiding the bookstore after his most recent visit.
“Please, Cas. We gotta keep this on the downlow for now. Sam’s orders.”
Castiel watched him go, as Dean looked over his shoulder at him.
But as years turned on years into centuries into millenia, Castiel had lost his heart somewhere along the way.
"Already? Now?" he asked. "Out of wedlock?"
Dean had closed his eyes.
Cas gave him a doubtful look, but sat down on the edge of the bed.
Castiel had always justified it to himself, interacting with humans this way, as an easier way to identify and heal the sick and wounded. And there was some truth to it.
"There's somethin' else you left behind," said another voice behind Colin and coming up fast.
And Dean thought of the strange, sad, bright blue bird-thing that had scooped him close with its wing and whispered about a loneliness of centuries, and of thousands of years.
His voice escalated and Sam motioned to keep it neutral.
” sang Fisherman.
This story is something of wish fulfillment for me, because my own perpetrators never saw any punishment for the horrific things they did. Like Sam and Dean, I didn't really understand how horrible it was until I was out and encountered other people.
Cas looked torn.
, he thought, with all the love and faith in his angelic heart.
"I guess I thought I'd never - you could never reciprocate, Dean, and I didn't expect - the reaction of your younger self. I didn't know that you were interested in male vessels."
Castiel had made his excuses and disappeared, leaving Dean with an empty ache in his chest where Cas had been and no real understanding of why.
"You all work on commission, right?" she asked.
Castiel shied back into the shadows.
Castiel was flighty, and wouldn’t even look Dean in the eye.
“Now get,” he said, and nodded toward the door.
“This might be a bad time to mention it,” said Sam, watching Dean make a cup of his hand and drink some of the whisky out of the lake, “or as good a time as any, I guess.”
"But?" he prompted.
"Uh, yeah, I need to buy some clothes," said Dean.
Dean stared at him, and then fell back, absolutely conquered.
"Dean?" Castiel ventured, staring up at the man.
"You're supposed to be
Because of course he was, he hadn’t become a different person, as far as he knew.
“Heh. What’s he need that for? We got plenty storytellers here. Me, you, Bobby.”
Dean whacked Castiel lightly on the ass with his sword.
at least.”
“I don’t think I need much introduction,” he said.
Dean knew he could tell Cas.
” said the Dean in his arms.
“Probably has no idea what a phone even is,” Dean said to himself as he wrapped a towel around his hips and ran to the hall phone.
by Daniel Quinn.
"I have lived for hundreds of years, and maybe hundreds more. But she's the only girl for me. An' I treasure the memories, that great gift."
Dean watched her go.
“K,” said Sam, who rolled over. “But if there’s bedbugs and you’re lying to me – ”
Dean looked out the window.
"What?" asked Dean.
Dean started awake on a gasp, to find the motel room muggy and hot in the sun pouring through the window.
He didn’t know if it was because he was no longer stone, or Dean was standing only a few feet from him without the separation of the street between his house and the hotel, but the man was utterly
And that was how Dean found himself sitting next to Sam on one side and Castiel on the other at Wrigley Field watching baseball.
“Cat got your tongue?” asked Dean, a light and gentle tease, as he landed in front of Castiel with all the grace of any angel, wings flapping with little effort as he landed on the balls of his bare feet.
Dean shifted in his seat uncomfortably.
"Does that feel good?" murmured Castiel. "Do you like me touching you, Dean?"
Castiel pushed Dean behind him, hiding him as best he could with his wings, and brandished his silver blade.
“The Shadow told Castiel that it knew who he loved, that there was nothing back there for him,” he said. “After he got back, and saw…well, everything he went through, I think he decided that the Shadow hadn’t been lying. A page from my big brother Lucifer’s book: why lie when the truth hurts more?”
Strange, because he'd have
Castiel stared at him like he was out of his mind.
Dean was gasping and crying out, and everywhere Castiel grappled with his body he pressed bruises there, he bit down and drew blood against Dean's chest and when Dean saw it dripping against the pale white of his skin he made a strange, soft little sound.
“Yes,” said Michael eagerly, eyeing him up and down. “Anything you want.”
Felipe was looking at him with a raised eyebrow as Dean went back to his meal.
Now Dean looked away from him.
“Say my name,” Cas snarled into his ear, as he rocked against Dean’s ass, insistent, needy, strung perfect, and Cas’s cock a hard line against denim.
"Fell?"
Castiel was startled to hear in a whisper.
Everyone turned to look at him, startled by the sudden noise.
His world was small, it was true.
Once upon a time, that had been a point of pride.
He sat down gingerly on the bed, unable to look him in the eye.
"I don't think you deserve to come," said Castiel, thoughtful and quiet.
Dean walked up to him and drew his sword.
“Don’t be,” said Dean, grinning. “It’s badass. Plus, it helped me find you. Some kinda GPS, I think.”
even the feathers feel like machinery.
But that wasn’t it.
The bright blue triangles narrowed in joy, the kind of expression Dean had seen on birds that looked particularly thrilled with themselves.
“I’m just happy for you,” said Sam. “And me. And the world at large. I’d call it a pretty big win.”
the guy, and that apparently wasn’t enough, either.
He would have plenty of time to reflect upon his life and his choices now that he was utterly alone.
Castiel’s voice boomed in the empty parking lot where Sam had told him the electronics store had been.
He knew that now.
“You must’ve been named after this town?” Dean asked.
Dean's mind wandered directly into where he'd heard the word
Then the line went dead.
“And when you got radio silence you got worried,” said Sam.
“There is a poison in him I cannot draw out,” said Castiel, sitting back and wiping the blood off his mouth with the back of his hand.
He was...
Castiel nodded, miserable.
Sam nodded, still holding an ice pack to his head.
He searched his mind for more upbeat, positive stories. Ones he didn’t really have himself, the kind of folklore that made people feel happy and warm.
“I changed my mind,” said Castiel. “Michael is gone, and – ”
Then Castiel leaned forward and touched Dean’s forehead.
Something about it nauseated him, the sun in the cold, like it wasn’t supposed to be there. He was glad for the flat gray sky above them, and the fresh air was clearing his head.
"Name them."
"Wow, Dean, I'm so happy for - "
But Dean was long gone.
It had been so long since he had fought willingly, back when he and his shepherd had fought against the encroaching armies.
Dean, for his part, kept telling himself
Sam's laughter echoed through the room.
Dean smiled to himself. This was sure to get his bodyguard’s attention.
I experienced a pancreatic attack. This is one of those things you don’t hear about much, because cirrhosis gets the attention. But apparently death by pancreatitis is one of the worst and most painful you can experience – the pancreas begins digesting itself and in chronic pancreatitis, it calcifies. They don’t have strong enough painkillers for it so those who die of this, die screaming. And it ain't a quick way to go either, from what I gather.
"I'm glad to hear you say that."
of seeing Dean tan and bare on a white-sand beach in the clear shallows of the water, his bright smile whiter still against the darker skin;
“I would like an explanation, please,” said Castiel.
"And me," said Colin, appearing by her side.
"That's just it, Cas. It's what I came to tell you. It's the one thing I wanted you to know."
"Should you not be in textiles?" he enquired, and she shot him a withering look.
and he backed away from Dean, tucking himself back in and zipping up his pants.
"He's your valet, Dean. But are you certain that's wise?" he asked softly. "After your behaviour at the party? None of the women are willing to consider you now, Dean. They think you were making fun of them."
Castiel, as always, did as he was told.
Dean groaned as he came to, recognizing the plywood paneling of a motel immediately.
"Do you still want me to call you sir?"
“Can angels do that?”
“What the
Mulder sat down beside Dean and smiled at him.
“You’re not kidding,” Dean agreed.
“Kick who out?”
His hands tightened on the back of Dean's chair where he was standing.
He didn't get a chance to touch the wood, because the door swung open of its own volition...
A huge bed stood in the center of the room near the opposite wall. Rich silk hangings adorned it as a canopy. The room was filled with overstuffed pillows, all of jewel tones. Candles were lit just about everywhere, in various pots and in candelabras. There was also a chandelier filled with candles.
Any other questions?”
, it slithered around in his head like –
“God, you’re fuckin’ beautiful,” muttered Dean, now almost certain he was possessed, because the intensity of his desire was huge and terrifying.
Bigger than the world, than the universe, than heaven and hell and Purgatory and all the places in between.
His son was standing there in front of him.
and joy
“And I know I’ve overdone it with you, so could you please do both of us a favor now and leave? I know how I feel about you and that it’s impossible for you to reciprocate. Too much too soon too fast, Castiel. That’s what they usually say. So I thought I’d save you the time and energy. There, have I said it all?”
“Yeah, it’s a fuckin’
Sam's voice in his head, from some long-ago, barely-remembered case.
“Of course.”
Spare space.
“I’m not sick.”
, there in the threadbare blankets.
he reminded himself helpfully.
untouchable, unconquerable lovers
There is no accountability or responsibility for actions these days. If someone is called out, the response is never admitting wrongdoing but making up excuses, often shrieking
“Cas?”
He dreamed of the great blasphemy of Dean calling
“Dean,” said the man, and the way he smiled warmly told Castiel that he liked what he saw. “That’s my brother, Sam. He’s a huge nerd.”
“I’m glad you’re here.”
Castiel looked at him. They were panting on the ground together next to the pool after yet another round, as Castiel seemed insatiable today.
It was the first direct order he had ever disobeyed.
He had never heard them speak of such an all-consuming passion like madness and need, anything just to warm himself in the nearby fire of Dean’s presence.
to him, not until Dean – he stayed in his human and human-angelic form so as to keep the townspeople happy, but he would not really have minded one way or the other if they had seen his true form or not.
"I can stop at anytime, yes, I know."
Dean couldn’t help it.
Dean laughed now, real and throaty, smiling with all his teeth. Castiel laughed, too.
"Yellow,"
and suddenly, Castiel was kissing him, soft and urgent and sweet.
“Great,” said Dean. “So he remembers
about you. Like whisky and the Highlands and -"
Castiel, for his part, had to try and calm his heartbeat.
“The night Castiel – di – got taken by the Empty,” said Dean, “he told me that he’d made a deal with it. That he’d agreed to be taken in a moment of perfect happiness.”
Castiel, of course, simply inclined his head, and let him lead the way.
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s just head out.”
More frighteningly, he was afraid that it might end.
Castiel was holding a tray with bacon, eggs, English muffin toast slathered in butter, a mug of coffee and a tall glass of orange juice.
"Hell, Cas, I thought that was
Soon, he knew he would have to search for gainful employment.
“Just listen. It’s safer if you don’t say anything. Not until we know.”
– but that was, maybe, for another conversation. For another time.
Finally: your abuse experience is *yours* and as Dean says here, not quantifiable/comparative to other suffering. Your suffering is your own and therefore it is a big deal to you. That matters.
"I never got into it. Too many unfinished stories, no answers, bugged me."
"That's when I knew," he said in a low voice, although there was no one else to hear him, "that I had to come back, to - to know. If you felt the same. And if you did, maybe - "
Sam ordered bacon and eggs while Dean ordered pretty much everything on the menu and covered it with both syrup and whipped cream.
Dean did not dignify this with a response, but followed Castiel anyway.
Then he narrowed his eyes.
Dean tipped his head forward, ignoring the little part of him that complained
maybe the wing-oil, maybe something else, because if Dean had been relaxed before, he became desperate, begging, needy, now, demanding and spreading his knees wide, touching his own cock and asking that Castiel mount him.
"Yeah, why's that?" Dean hedged.
They all stared out at the deep blue that led to light green at the shoreline, where boulders and rocks were visible, even from that height.
The people of the seaside town were fighting with all they had – rocks, sticks, anything to hand.
But they would not.
“Dean. Uh. Yeah.”
Suddenly, Dean was
Dean hesitated.
“So the rich woman who had once been poor returned to the little shack where she had grown up,” said Dean. “And she went to her mother’s tombstone. Then she told her mother’s ghost that she had forgiven her mother for what she had done, telling her she understood.”
“Angel handcuffs?” he asked. “What are you doing, Balthasar?”
