With his mouth half open, he takes the tip of Sherlock’s prick between his lips, pressing the flat of his tongue against him, rubbing him shamelessly. He does so for a few brief seconds, trying to gauge a taste. Above him he again hears something drop on the table, feels Sherlock squirm in his chair as John suddenly pulls away with his head spinning slightly.
And John's eyes were dark.
, there they had it then,
“J-John- say it already!”
Right then, he furiously thought as he yanked at his door knob.
“God, give me a hand, John! I can’t stand this any longer!”
"I'm a doctor and your friend, Holmes. There's nothing I haven't seen before, and Mrs. Hudson is not in the house, I assure you there isnt-"
. However: with two broken arms, and the inconvenient fact that he couldn't even undo his trousers like some dimwitted child, meant his plans needed a-
Replying with a noncommittal sound, Sherlock fixed his eyes down his tented pyjamas, suddenly alarmed to see that the flushed glans of his penis were poking out of the buttoned fly gap. Feeling John’s gaze on him, Sherlock quickly bent his leg further up to hide the possibility of John catching sight of it. Wearing navy blue silk bottoms, the bright spot of pink that poked out could easily be seen from yards away, Sherlock stared down at it.
“You’re laughing.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him as if trying to read his mind. John quickly darted his eyes away and cleared his throat as he put his focus on the steam that escaped the hot-but not-too-hot cup. "I'll try to cool it a bit down for you, mind that it's your favourite," John blew against the liquid a few times until deciding that it was drinkable enough.
He decided in the meantime to do some washing up.
After Sherlock had figured out a way to relief his bladder without John’s assistance (
Having wanted to avoid the possibility of people discovering his oversensitivity, Sherlock had established extra precautions around his personal space. Needing to keep people at distance, he had found that it was a simple matter of sneering at anyone that stood too close, he purposely marched into a room to take up all the space he required, methodically and successfully driving people away from him - sometimes adding insults for good measure. Not that Sherlock really had to try, people naturally avoided being too close to him.
Sherlock looked significantly less sour now. In fact, like a cat he followed John’s hand, adamant to get attention from it. And John let him have his way as his hand found itself in a tangle full of curls, careful to keep his touch light and not press down too much on the follicles.
He had said it, there was no going back now.
Jesus Christ.
Or disapproval.
“God, I hope that wasn’t too bad as I see you’re not . . .
Kudos and comments are a writer's bonbons! I LOVE them very very much, they make me grin like a lunatic, so thank you :)
“Ah-h, yes.
They would only annoy him and disturb 221b's domestic, chaotic air. They would constantly remind him that John was too uncomfortable, too repulsed to help Sherlock like that.
Aware of how that sounded like, he quickly added, “Because you’re my friend and I care about you, alright?”
O h   g o d.
“No, no, it’s nice, Sherlock. Lovely. I like it. A lot, actually.” He licked his lips as he looked up, nervous to voice his thoughts. “I’d really… May I, er, hold it?”
"You alright? Thought we'd have a cup of tea, yes?"
The detective had the loveliest prick of all of England, that he was sure of.
And John –
Sherlock felt a sudden wave of heat surge into his face as he frantically held back another spasm of his bladder. He snapped his eyes up to John, gasping as his bladder tensed.  “John! I'm going to have to urinate!”
Eat your cake, fatty.
But Sherlock’s comfort was way more important than any of John’s longings. John couldn’t stand the thought of repeating the scene from a couple days ago: where John had pressed his lips to Sherlock’s bare stomach and Sherlock had jerked away from him as if burned.
He fucked it up. He thought-
John blinked at his white screen, not seeing any of the words that he had just typed. His fingers stilled over the keyboard, and he tilted his head lightly to the side to confirm that Sherlock indeed went to the bathroom.
Sherlock snapped his eyes wide open at the sound of water hitting porcelain, horrified at the noise, he felt his bladder tense up, urinary tract clenching suddenly. And-- oh. Not good,
Sherlock looked self defensively down at himself, his face was flushed a bright red. “What are you implying? Obviously I can’t hold myself, John. The bones in my arms are both fractured, reducing me to a futile cripple, though let me add, you are doing an inimitable job of holding my penis.”
By all means, he never once thought himself as an invert, but when it came to Holmes, everything was turned around, made an exception. And all things considered, the man just was aesthetically pleasing to him, including his delicate member.
Oh, well then.
Not being able to help it, John touched his lips to the back of Sherlock’s neck as he racked his eyes up and down the wet skin.
John heard an intake of breath as he moved his hands down to his zipper, pulling himself out and aiming for the toilet.
But then his smile slipped from his face, heart stuttering as he watched Sherlock stiffen next to him, watched as a sudden mask slammed into place, expression cool and indifferent. He didn’t spare John a single glance.
The genius opened and closed his mouth, trying to find some way out.
The detective shook his head, eyes flickering away as he turned back to his bedroom.
He was most surprised to note that Holmes' length wasn't much bigger in this state, it was still considerably smaller than a cigar. And although Holmes' member was on the short side, Watson thought it was quite lovely and fitting.
Sherlock and John watched suddenly in horror as John's hand started to shake, making the liquid in the steaming cup of tea spill over and land on Sherlock's thin pants.
Frozen behind the table, Sherlock crossed his legs as he appeared to control himself. His sharp eyes darted between John and the bathroom door. "John, I can't...Can't move. You need to-
. John couldn’t help but give him a peck on the lips.
"John!"
“Oh, for God’s sake,” Sherlock bit out, feeling a hot flush rise up his cheekbones as he willed some sense into John’s head. He did not have time for this. “Even for being drunk you’re being unnecessarily obtuse. I must--, just please. It’s a very pressing matter, John.
Biting the inside of his cheek, John started to taste blood.
The soft hissing sound was now a noisy stream, and it made John flush up with the knowledge that he was aroused just because he was listening to- –
He can't quite believe he's holding it. It is- -
Hastily darting his eyes away from Sherlock, John muttered. “Yeah, right. Of course, er…”
Feeling unhelpfully wobbly on his legs, Sherlock clumsily stood up, mind spinning as he moved back to the bed.
Panting, the detective pressed his forehead against John’s, eyes fluttering closed in an overwhelmed manner. “Very. Just…ah, quite a bit much, John. I’m sensitive,” he said, wincing when John trailed the hard length of him with a gentle finger, stroking him through the material of his dress pants.
? John shook his head, feeling stupid for wondering such a thing. Of course he’d mind, it was an invasion of privacy, no one would like that. It’s just that Sherlock constantly invaded John’s, so why can’t John just for once -
Contemplating with himself, Watson bit his lip and took up the risk to either put an awkward halt to their friendship or perhaps take his friendship with Holmes to an unexpected turn. He felt oddly hopeful for the latter.
"Soldier! What is the meaning of this! Stop it this instant!"
- was stroking him with unrestrained enthusiasm.
Blinking, John suddenly shook his head, coming back to reality. He needed to do something. Sherlock definitely needed help in the shower. After all, how was he supposed to put shampoo on his body? It was only reasonable, and aside from that, John could not leave Sherlock unsupervised in the shower; the idea that Sherlock meanwhile relieved his bladder in there was simply out of question.
Well. Sherlock said
Sighing, he heaved himself from the chair, slowly crossing the room and halting a few steps from the couch. Licking his lips, he contemplated for a moment.
The thing was just that John was really pants at it.
“You’re the doctor, John. You know perfectly well what the loss of exercise such as masturbation entails. Having you masturbate me will keep up my brain chemistry, as I’ve factored in all elements of positive outcomes, my transport greatly benefits from your expertise, as I need not concern myself over any malfunctions. The evidence of yesterday inevitably concludes it as reasonable for me to be amenable for another possible repetition.”
And today Sherlock thought John was being particularly stupid,
Cursing, John quickly shed his clothes, leaving his red pants on before turning towards the shower, slightly out of breath in his hurry. He pulled the curtain aside, stepping in whilst taking a peek at what he was seeing.
With that in mind, John determinedly followed down the stairs, already withering a moody air.
John’s lips twitched at the `please´.
Sighing in exasperation, John shook his head, knowing Sherlock won’t shut his mouth until John let him have his way. If it weren’t for the fact that they were in a public loo, John would’ve wilfully ignored him. Besides it was not like this whole thing could get any worse already, seeing as John was already sporting a bulge in his pants.
John was in a good mood too.
Step by step, he reminded himself.
that?” Sherlock asked urgently, tone tense as he struggled to remain unaffected by his transport.
,” John had his thighs parted as he jerked with a final roll of his hips into the palm of his hands.
Not that John was particularly surprised by that.
John’s frowns were always very pronounced and easy to read.
Sherlock rolled his eyes before sending his reply in little less than a hundred seconds.
John left Sherlock behind, entering the bedroom. His hands were fisted so tightly his fingernails cut into his palms. He cursed himself as he felt his weak shoulder start to ache.
F u c k, he was going to touch them, he was going to touch them right this instant-
“Christ, Sh’lock. Look at your piss slit,” John breathed as he moved his hand up again to pump Sherlock’s length between his thumb and forefinger, watching as a fine trail of piss rushed out. “You’re pissing everywhere.”
Having put a bit too much soap on him, John could barely see anything anymore. Feeling almost giddy at the vast amount of soap on Sherlock, John allowed his hand to slip away for a moment just to have a better look.
Again Thank You Kittiehill for looking after this chap!
S  h e r l o c k     c a m e.
Oh god, he needed to get a grip on himself! He didn't know why he liked Sherlock's cock so much, it wasn't even that impressive by any means.
“Jesus, Sherlock! Keep it down, will you? Look, all I’m saying is that as your friend I--,“ John stopped then and licked his lips, frantic in trying to make sense of their conversation as words flittered undecidedly through his head, “You know, I care a good deal about you. But because you’re my friend I can’t just clinically detach myself when you need…”
“That 'right? You good now?”
Right, because of his repressed feelings.
“Mm. Let’s bloody sleep then.”
"Okay, just give me a moment, I'm almost done here," he said, wanting to calm his excited heart. This, he feared, was highly inappropriate. He never felt this perverted in his life. He wouldn't, no, couldn’t possibly last a week of being this unprofessional. Sherlock would sooner or later discover how aroused John was by him. Perhaps it was high time for John to go out with some of the women he recently had met, Natasha was it? He needed to get off with someone, and it had to be soon because masturbation was not going to cut it.
Watson clenched his jaw, when he was shoved off by rough hands, and stumbled backwards. His vision was dense and clouded by anger and confusion; he still hadn’t entirely grasped what had just happened. The policeman had the man's hands tied, making some notes while Watson stared, dully noting a faint ache in his fists.
Sherlock had a full bladder. And he planned to relieve said bladder in the shower, didn't he?
Sherlock suddenly looked as if he had been slapped, staggering slightly backwards as the meaning of John’s words sank in. Looking hurt, he darted his eyes away from John and turned around; shoulders visibly slumping as he moved to leave the room.
Instantly, Sherlock started babbling incoherent sentences, penis jerking in his hand, flushing a bright red. And John was completely undone by his own words and the way it affected the detective.
God, he wanted to kiss him.
“Damnit, John! I –ngh-,” clenching his jaw, Sherlock stifled a yelp, feeling his desperation rise. His penis meanwhile reacted unfavourably to the clear disapproval in John’s voice, stirring and twitching against his thigh impatiently.
Option choosen: 4)
“Oh . . . I see. I believe our discussion was efficient enough to . . . distract me. But why are we talking about my penis, John?”
Sherlock sits unnaturally straight in his seat, gaze drawn on the table, apparently about to engross himself with his 'side experiment', pinpette in hand as he starts to work on his mold.  And John just stands there for a moment, wondering if this is really happening.
It seems like a cruel dream, another idiotic fantasy about how John is somehow allowed to touch his untouchable flatmate, the object of his pining affections. It's just a bit much to take in. John barely can comprehend this.
Taking a deep breath, Watson leaned down, and almost purred, "Well, I can certainly see some serious stirring down there, Holmes. I think it best I examine you again, I ought to be more throughly this time. What do you say, Holmes?"
John barely registered when he had started humping his laptop. The friction was just enough to keep him from pulling out his aching cock, but even if it weren’t enough, John knew exactly what he would have done.
. His cock was
Moments after Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, seemingly and hopefully not noticing anything unusual about John.
John frowned. “Yeah, we could say that as well. Working-partners in crime and the like, whatever you like. But what’s this to do with our previous conversation?” John laughed light-heartedly, unsure what the detective was onto now.
While Sherlock was able to open conventional doors with lever handles, he couldn’t at all do door knobs. The fact that the bathroom door and the entrance door of 221b both had door knobs were starting to aggravate Sherlock to such an extent that his urge to yell at them had become another frequent and normal occurrence at 221b Baker Street.
He was beautiful, absolutely exquisite.
Fine, Sherlock could see his point. It was all fine.
A disgruntled breath escaped the detective. Then, after a pause in which John gave him a hard look, he said, “Fine, if you so insist.”
Nearly three hours went by before John heard the familiar shutting of the door downstairs. He couldn’t believe Sherlock went out for this long just to get his curls back in order, it was ridiculous. The longest John ever took at the hairdresser was perhaps half an hour, but only if he included his facial hair as well. But three hours was really cutting it, he couldn’t even imagine what would take so long.
“Just re-adjust me, John. Seeing as I can’t do it myself, I'm asking for a friend’s hand.”
John clenched his eyes shut as a wave of pleasure washed over him. God,
John also looked down, eagerly watching the stream slow down, heart leaping when he noticed   - o h   g o d -   soft   pink   glans   peeking out of the foreskin. He could see them – finally - Sherlock’s glans – his tiny little piss slit – f u c k – could see how the last bits of droplets seeped out, wetting the rosy head of his lovely lovely cock.
Sherlock’s shy tone instantly makes John’s heart burst in his chest; there is only so much he can do to not throw himself at the detective and kiss him once again breathless.
“Colour?”
“Oh. You don’t mind then?”
The doctor blinked, turning around to find Holmes kneeling on the pavement, his expression was enough to make Watson gasp. The detective had his white fingers clenched to his knees, and was breathing in a loud, ragged way.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I, ah, did like it, yes,” Sherlock said, eyes set on the sheets as he continued, “All of it. That thing you did… said… that was, ah, that was
Shuffling on his feet, John went into the living room to find Sherlock still pacing around with a sour expression on his face. Undoubtedly, the detective was bored and irritated to no end. John had a feeling it wouldn’t take much longer until he finally snapped. He was sure it was only a matter of hours now.
"Please Holmes, let me take your coat, while I suggest you untuck yourself. You really shan't irritate yourself any further."
John stared at him. “You… didn’t mind?”
Gently, slowly, John pressed and rubbed with his palm open. Pressed and rubbed. Pressed and rubbed until Sherlock couldn’t anymore.
“You hardly used any of the soap on yourself, John.”
Just like yesterday, when Sherlock had left the room and John was abruptly snapped out of his thriving daze, blinking at his laptop in confusion and wondering why that kept happening to him. That’s when he realized that this odd on and off focus of his must have something to do with Sherlock.  More accurately, it had something to do with him not being in the same room anylonger.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter open a few times, expression endearingly dazed.
Sherlock grunted distractedly.
had he been doing last night? John, startled by the thought, frowned when he only remembered going out for a drink with Greg. Right, and then–
. Slowly, gently.
He felt a bit guilty that he hadn't even attempted to 'delete' it yet, when Sherlock had asked him to do so. John was very conflicted with what had happened and how it had affected him so...unexpectedly. His mind hadn't been quite clear after the incident, because the first thing he did was wank himself off to the image of his desperate flatmate in mind.
“John.”
“Is it?” he asked, carefully giving the limp member another kiss.
“Nothing, just, your hair looks fine to me,” he said as his flatmate stalked towards the mantelpiece, inspecting himself in the mirror with a critical look. “I mean after three hours of hair trimming, why shouldn’t it, right?”
John fought to keep a straight face. “Well. That’s the reason why I didn’t become a urologist. C’mon, you bloody well know I like your cock, Sherlock. It’s perfect.”
Though much too short winded.
Heart in his throat, John couldn’t help it but kiss the side of Sherlock’s face as he peeled the towel aside to see him again.
Well, it's been a couple of hours since John last had his cold hands around it, he supposed it must be at its normal size again.
Oh, Christ.
“It’s no good. Just like me wanting to see you piss is no good,” John continued, breathlessly rutting into his palm as he groaned, “Sorry for that, Sherlock, I can’t help that. So now y’know how much I enjoy, ah, seeing you piss. Christ,
“Oh. So you really need to…?”
Sensing that Sherlock wasn’t going to add anything else, John fiddled with the shoelaces, continuing more directly.
“All right?” He couldn’t help asking.
Hasting to not waste any more time than necessary, Sherlock flexed his hand and methodically draped his untied dressing gown over his pyjama bottoms, careful to position himself in a way that would not show the obviousness of his action before plunging his hand deep inside the pocket of his dressing gown, feeling himself through the thin layer of his pyjamas.
The last incident was a miscalculation, an error of his transport. What occured was inconvienient, though not entirely suboptimal. The image of John holding his penis was not at all unwelcome, Sherlock had it carefully filed up in his mind palace before he had moved on to delete the more undignified part in which he had displayed a significant lack of control.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. I simply require you to – ngh! God, just get me out of my trousers, John!”
Captain John Watson disapproving of this..
Sherlock huffed as he pushed his head back to his open hand demandingly.
“Spit it out, John.”
As he discarded the plastic bags around the gypsum, John smiled apologetically at Sherlock’s shivering state, hurrying to fetch him his dressing gown.
Sherlock turned away from him and stumbled from the shower, exhausted. His adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly, ignoring the fact that his hair was wet and unwashed. John felt his insides freeze as it hit him what it all meant.
"John? Are you listening to what I'm saying?"
“J-John..”
“Liar.”
Inwardly he let out a sigh.
That’s what John had been waiting for: seeing how the detective made a mess of his thousand pound worth of trousers simply because he couldn’t
John of course disapproved of the yelling part, having sheepishly looked up from his newspaper, he had said, “You know I’m right there if you need the loo. No need to insult its…knob.” Then he had glanced away from Sherlock’s unclothed state in an unmistakably guilty manner that Sherlock had seen through at once.
“God, sorry. Let me just--,” John scrambled to say, face colouring at his hitched voice. He forgot that Sherlock’s
John turned around, staring at him. “Yes?”
“Yes and you ejaculated all over me, Sherlock.”
“So?” Sherlock says at last, shifting in his chair as he blinks up at John, shoulders tense as he waits for a reply.
- it was so soft and small.
"John! John, stop it! I have to piss! I have to piss!" he let out horrified, struggling to control his transport as he tried to hold back his tender bladder. His silky thin underwear felt damp already, and adopted a clinging sensation. Sherlock needed to-- God!
“Sherlock? Talk to me? Did I say something wrong?”
There were certain things Sherlock had been looking toward to happening; John making his bed, John brushing his teeth, John buttoning and unbuttoning his shirts, John checking on him, just, John being there.
“Oi mate, what’s with your arms? Lookin bit bloated there, innit?”
So. Much. Soap.
And John accepted as it was, he could deal with it and almost thought he got over this infatuation for Sherlock.
- good. God knew what – with a not-hungry, moody and cockblocked detective, it wasn’t exactly the best of omens. But he quickly realised that Sherlock was not going to address any of the mishaps, so John shrugged at it and went along with it. Or at least he pretended he did.
John just wished they could pick up their last conversation again and continue where they had left off – or better yet where they had been interrupted. Because he was going to pull his hair out if this silent tension continued on between them. And it definitely didn’t help that Sherlock’s words kept ringing in his mind.
And of course Sherlock had left without having had any kind of breakfast. Knowing him, he probably hadn’t even had a single sip this morning, damn it. Damn it all.
He often wondered what Sherlock was packing, and was not overly surprised to note that his penis was on the small side, flushed pink with a foreskin stretched over the head, Sherlock's cock felt rather dainty in his hand. It was actually quite lovely, John thought.
With an intake of breath, John puts his hand carefully on Sherlock's knee, signalling that he is about to start with his 'procedure'. To being quite so honest, he doesn't believe in the purpose of this ridiculous experiment but how,
John held up a hand at the detective. “Okay wait, let me just-, you’re not making this any easier! It’s really not that cold, Sherlock.”
Holmes appeared reluctant to let go of his crotch, and for a good reason too. Watson was dumbfounded to see that the pin striped trousers appeared to be slightly tented when Holmes quickly stood up and tossed the parcelled snow away with a scarlet face. The detective hurriedly  covered himself with his coat, sighing at the situation.
Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.
Sherlock’s words drowned in a strangled hiss as John tightened his hand around him, carefully allowing the cock in his hand some stimulation. The detective immediately responded by thrusting slightly, letting his hard prick slide in and out of the tight circle that John’s hot hand made.
They stood two meters away from the toilet, when John suddenly felt a steady stream leave Sherlock's desperate prick.
John didn't want someone else to replace him. He wanted to care for Sherlock. Theory: He didn't mind the incident in the bathroom too much. John being professional. Of course, John was a doctor, he cared for transports and their inconvenient urges. Fact: John was terribly, wonderfully caring. Conclusion: No assistants were needed. Just John.
“Hey, wait, let me just,” John stopped the detective halfway through the door as he stood in his way.
Nuzzling into the union jack pillow beneath his head, Sherlock watched John through half-lidded eyes as his skin started prickling into goosebumps from the mere fact that John was in the same room as Sherlock, while unbeknownst to him, Sherlock’s hand was gently fondling his cock.
His breath hitched.
“Why not?”
The unerring picture of Sherlock in his dressing gown sprawled open came to mind, making John swallow.
Following up the stairs, he entered the living room, words flittering through his head as he thought back to what he had said five hours ago.
They simply were not meant to be.
“Will you sit still already?” he finally hissed under his breath, eyes squinting in the dark light, trying to see what the matter was.
Sherlock isn't wearing any pants.
“Nonsense. You used them perfectly not even an hour ago.”
Sensing his discomfort, John held up a hand. “But you don’t have to say it if you don’t want to. It’s just. Look, I want to do this right; I don’t want to hurt you or do anything you don’t enjoy. I really like indulging you, Sherlock. As I’m sure you figured out already, I really enjoy making you feel good. And talking about what you like and don’t like… well, helps.”
Eyebrows shooting up his head, John turned to look blankly at the detective.
Entering the kitchen, John frowned when he came face to face with a fretful Mrs. Hudson.
Really, definitely off.
Sherlock seemed to consider this for a moment before he nodded. “Yes, alright.”
“Fine. If you so insist I can lick it off.”
“I’m just getting you clean. Wait let me just put it right… there.”
Holding up the cream he’s brought with him, John threw a glance at Sherlock's face, “We need to keep a close look at that, but the spot should fade in a week. How does it feel?”
Not that John would ever say that out loud if he wanted to continue living.
. Though he couldn’t help feeling thrilled by the possibility of repeating all of this. Putting soap all over Sherlock’s naked wet pale skin.
. Not only was his penis quite dainty, but it also felt much more vulnerable when flaccid, it made John rather happy (in a non creepy way he hoped). Weighing him in his hand, John tilted Sherlock's cock up to wipe at the scrotum underneath; gently cleaning around the loose skin and strangely liking that this was his mess he was wiping away.
Sherlock, still as boneless and limp as when his orgasm first had hit him, followed John’s eyes down his own body. Half his chest, legs and crotch were still covered in a mass of bubbly soap.
Wordlessly, John pulled himself together, attempting to be as Sherlockian about this as possible. He swallowed down his emotional turmoil as he grabbed a large towel and dried the shivering detective, dabbing at the wet skin and making a quick job of it before throwing the damp towel aside.
“So.” he started. “You don’t mind then?”
Oh no, John thought disapprovingly, he did not give him permission to let go here!
!” Sherlock went limp from pleasure, his cock stiffening further as the little metal bit grazed and rubbed the soft glans.
it. And despite himself, Sherlock was helplessly flattered by it and quite pleased with himself that John seemed to appreciate the entirety of his anatomy, penis included.
F u c k.
As John continued to tease himself, he absent mindedly wondered whatever Sherlock held his lovely little cock with both hands while he pissed. He really needed to catch the detective at a public urinal to find out.
“Careful!” Sherlock hissed.
Letting out a grunt, Sherlock watched as John aimed his stream down the wall of the tub, stroking his shaft with feather light touches as he resumed pulling at Sherlock’s foreskin, teasing it up and down his tip and causing Sherlock to tremble over the sensation. “Careful, I’m pissing, John! But don't stop, I need--
Nevertheless, John happened to go over these thoughts again as his typing started to falter. Coincidentally, Sherlock’s presence shifted. John couldn’t see it but the detective was in fact moving, standing up with annoyance written across his face and whirling around with his dressing gown to abruptly disappear to the bathroom.
John hastily averted his gaze, barely able to stand the sight. Relieved that his own cock had waned somewhat, he was careful to keep it that way.
"John," Sherlock grits, hips shifting restlessly, voice hoarse. "You- you need to slow down."
John blinks hard for a moment, unsure if he has heard quite right. "You-
Sherlock needed to process them.
“John?”
"Stop thinking, John. I need...to...urinate," Sherlock panted as a helpless trail of piss started dripping down one by one onto the floor.
He hesitated, before he said after a moment, “And you’re fine if we get messy? Say I played with you while you... and then I'd put my hand against your weeing cock?”
), John had shown signs of poorly masked disappointment. It was obvious that this had to do with John’s doctor-ly concern over checking Sherlock’s liquid intake. Sherlock had dismissed this all the same as he considered this as particularly tedious. After all, John kept forcing him to drink a minimum of 1.4 liter per day; there was no reason to further investigate the matter.
The detective frowned only.
“You love me?”
John eagerly stays still, letting the detective do the last bit of the work, watching the desperate rocking of the pale hips, and humming once the blunt head of Sherlock’s cock brushes the back of his throat.  With a strangled noise above, Sherlock sobs, frantic for more stimulation.
It was obvious to John that Sherlock tried to frantically hold himself between his thighs, but blatantly failed to do so. He must be so desperate that his cock was either flopping anywhere but around his thighs, or it was just difficult to reach it, John mused. Well, he's never seen much of Sherlock's penis, so he couldn't say for sure. Though he wouldn't mind having just a bit of a glance of it.
Finally he opened his mouth, and Watson found his voice to be uncharacteristically hitched as Holmes muttered, "I'm too...Watson, I cannot possibly....it's too sensitive."
“You berk. And you proposed I should suck your cock for some ludicrous experiment. Why the hell didn’t you ask me this bloody thing sooner?”
A groan went past his lips, and John was aching, achingly close of coming. He stroked his cockhead with his laptop as carefully continued to listen to Sherlock in the bathroom. It was better he never walked in, now that he was aware what he’d like to do, he’d be surprised if he were able to look Sherlock in the eye within the next few weeks.
John squeezed the delicate skin of Sherlock's foreskin even tighter between his fingers, making the detective gasp. "Don't you dare, Sherlock!" He warned, "You will go when I tell you to!" And with that he pulled Sherlock closer to the loo, watching transfixed as a trail of urine struggled to escape between his fingers, dribbling down one by one.
John was surprised by this new revelation, feeling his heart jump as he thought back to when he wondered whatever or not Sherlock played with himself while he urinated. Clearing his throat, John tried to focus on what he wanted to say.
“ Sher- oof! Uh. Sherlock?” John had quickly tightened both his hands around him, steadying him with those strong capable arms that Sherlock admired so. John’s arms were a blessing.
Holmes' penis was as flushed as a pink rose and the shaft was heavily swollen, pointing straight up the ceiling with its cockhead peeking out. It bobbed and twitched at the warm air. As a doctor he knew that there was a theory that at times when the body received pain, the brain comprehended it as pleasure, making a person aroused. But this, he thought, this surely must be something else.
His phone was on the table and Sherlock leaned down, methodically typing a message to his annoying brother.
“Oh for god’s sake, turn it the opposite direction, John. This is the wrong focus,” Sherlock said not the second time this day. At least it was a good thing that the samples actually
He suddenly felt very hot.
A grunt escaped Sherlock. “Really, John. As of usual, you’ve failed to observe the meticulous maintenance my hair type needs. Without that, it will result in frayed disorder which in turn causes breakage, moisture loss, and friction in the cuticles. But of course you wouldn’t know any of this, given that your hair texture is thin and dense enough to tolerate your use of cheap shampoo.”
“But you’re such a prat, Sh’lock,” the hand that was squeezing and rubbing turned an angry shade of red as it pressed down the bulge, John jerked into it, “Can’t even let me have any off time from your demands. It’s constantly ‘bored, bored, bored’ or ‘entertain me, John’, but then I go out of m’way and you’re still being a git.”
"Watson! Watson, I must spend myself," he rasped, desperately moving his long pale fingers down to touch himself. "Let me spend."
He actually was the biggest idiot that walked the earth.
“As usual?” John repeated, gently prompting Sherlock to continue.
And due to the shift in their…
What John had said was-
It was good. It was very-  oh!
“Why don’t we make use of the bloody couch for once.” he suggested.
John is on his hands and knees, carefully keeping his head down as he stares, stares at Sherlock's crotch. He's about to see-
Escaping down the stairs, Sherlock reluctantly followed behind with his gaze burning into the back of his neck. John pinched the bridge of his nose as he tried to ignore the need to scratch at the spot. Decidedly, this whole conversation had been a bad idea after all. He had achieved nothing whatsoever but to make the whole thing worse. And Sherlock wasn’t helping at all.
Seemingly startled at the sudden filthy words, Sherlock appeared a bit taken aback, though a lovely flush tinted the detective’s cheek.
Nevertheless, it was inevitable what was to come. Eventually the detective would descent into one of his dramatic black moods, and John could only do so much. That didn’t mean he wasn’t willing to go to some lengths to put a delay on it. And who knew, the samples at the lab might just save the day.
John leaned back against the bed frame, worrying his lip as he waited for Sherlock to speak. Had John been too enthusiastic with indulging Sherlock these last days? Had he misread something along the lines? Maybe this hadn’t been as welcome as John initially had thought.
However, it appeared that his flatmate was unable to move.
"Obviously, John," Sherlock replied tightly, crossing his legs suddenly, squeezing himself not all too subtly.
150 seconds and the door snapped open.
The detective had the side of his face smashed against the pillow, groaning.
“I think a few? I suppose, er,” steps faltering, John blinked for a moment, eyes set down Sherlock’s waist as his dazed mind seemed to catch on to something. “You--,
John sighed and gestured for Sherlock to sit down so he could feed him. This was, if anything, going to be interesting. It was soup that first came to mind when he thought about dinner, and for good reasons too; he hoped the stubborn prat would eat some of it so there was at least a tinkle of fluid in his body. It was worth a try anyway, John wanted to surpass Sherlock’s ridiculous fuss of not needing to drink much. He sneakily figured, he would make him 'eat' the double liquid portion.
Frankly, John didn’t even think of that, he was sure they had it already figured out. From the moment they started snogging, John thought it was sorted that they were - well. Boyfriends. Partners.
He turned to take the cold towel that he's brought, and wrapped it around Holmes' bollocks, carefully handling the oversensitive parts. Holmes shuddered and muffled a gasp.
“Right then. I’ll just get dressed before putting the telly on. If you change your mind…” John trailed off, struggling to keep the disappointment from showing on his face. “Well, I’ll be on the couch.”
. That’s what it felt like.
He barely heard his own voice, his heartbeat was so loud it seemed to over tune it. Feeling defeated, he slowly sunk down on his chair, expecting Sherlock to walk away.
John almost smiled at him and went to the kitchen, presumingly, making them both tea.
The bed creaked with a long complaint.
John pointed the shower head back at Sherlock’s chest, making it quick work to get the wall of soap off before moving down to the long legs and thighs, feeling how the detective tensed underneath the cold shower stream as John washed him. Pausing in his ministrations, John glanced at Sherlock’s penis.
Holmes grumbled and accusingly stared at himself as he waited for Watson to grab his things from the bathroom. He knew this was bound to be a catastrophe, but he didn't have the energy to fight Watson's caring nature.
If he caught Sherlock, he'd have to discipline him, make him hold it until he couldn't anymore. Until the detective hit the point of helplessly pissing himself in the shower with John watching him.
Christ. John couldn't believe he was actually holding Sherlock’s prick.
. He couldn’t because he, unlike Sherlock, respected privacy. But regardless, knowing that John could just walk up and open the door at this very instance was enough to bring him over the brink. And imagining what would happen, what he’d see definitely wasn’t any less of a turn on.
As predicted, the doctor clenched his jaw and shifted in his seat as he began speaking, “Bunch of pricks they are all. Have you heard that bit from the House of Lords? Tell Mycroft they can all go and fuck themselves. I hate that lot.”
. And John stood there, knowing that if he just went on he’d . . . he’d have--, but that’s what he was doing right now. In fact, his hand was slipping inside Sherlock’s pants –
He nodded, and clapped his hands when he saw that they had finally arrived Baker street.
“What? You need to…piss?” John asked suddenly, surveying him with open interest, eyes widening a fraction.
But he had been mistaken. Overall, John should have known better.
Strangely, as John had recently observed, Sherlock’s presence rendered him into a state of calmness, a world where he could follow up his current task with deep rooted concentration. This, well, he hadn’t given it much thought before, but he felt that he had become hyperaware of Sherlock’s presence - or sudden absence.
Unless it had anything to do with John’s insistence of keeping the bathroom door shut. Sherlock thought it was ridiculous that John made him repeatedly ask him to open the door (with a forced ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, it was hateful). The conclusion was that John wasn’t telling him something.
Staring at Sherlock’s uncovered cock.
“What the- ? Sherlock!”
Looking at him for a moment, John put his hand on his thighs, caressing them with a self satisfied grin.
thrilled by it.
Feeling all too sour, Sherlock sneered. Indulgence forgotten, he turned to his side, away from John.
However, senses quickly took over him, and before he knew it, he had the cruel stranger  pinned down to the ground.
“John,” he tried to warn as he clumsily jerked his hips.
Sherlock quickly pushed the thought away as a shiver ran down his back.
"I'd like you wait approximately 10 more minutes, John, or more conveniently 15 more minutes. I prefer to be left alone at the moment," Sherlock said, not registering John's stare.
“Why should I? Wasn’t my previous admission evidence enough that I already am engaging in it, if only by myself?”
“Sherlock,” John said furiously, taking a step backwards, “Did you not listen to what I’ve just said? I can’t give you a hand!”
Because John
"But-," Sherlock's voice faltered when John forced himself to urinate. A steady stream escaped his urethra, adding to the noise the shower was already making. He didn't trust himself to look at Sherlock, not while he was pissing, but Sherlock's sudden quietness definitely spoke for itself.
He was so close to – oh!
----JW POV-------
Really enjoyed
Apparently having said ‘fuss’ was the final cherry on the cake that brought Sherlock down to his sulk. With his big dress shirt over his gypsum, the detective abruptly turned away, plopping down on the couch without another word.
S h e r l o c k.
“What?” John felt like he’s just missed something. Why were they like this? Why were they so- -so dysfunctional in their communication?
God, this was mad. He usually wasn’t the sort to get off on doing something like that. It was weird and filthy to just even think about it. And doing it was just-
“Yes?”
“I need you, John,” he sighed defeated. “I always need you.”
Sherlock seemed to process this before letting out a scoff. “That’s it?” he said, almost sounding disappointed, “Clearly your judgement is misplaced, John. People in this work field do this because they pity and care. You do this because you do less of the pitying and more of the caring, fine. But you’re not backing out of this because we’re friends, no; there’s something you’re not telling me.”
, y’know,” John said sheepishly, looking down at him as he swept a thumb over his length. “Your lil' wee-wee.”
Sherlock sprang up and went to the radiator next to his bed, checking the temperature.
His long legs fell open, knees spread apart as they started trembling divinely underneath John’s gaze. Bare and vulnerable.
Huffing with a hint of a pout, Sherlock clenched his jaw. “Don’t be obtuse, John. It’s the hairdresser I’m going to. As I've explained to you, I’m a 3b type in the Andre Walker System, obviously my hair requires a precise maintenance that goes beyond cheap shampoo. Now, if you would be so … kind.”
He checked the water again. It wasn’t
“And my penis, John?”
And Sherlock jerks his hips up and down, thrusting, thrusting, thrusting, frantically gripping John’s hand all the while, never letting go of it.
The detective cleared his throat when he saw Watson's intent gaze on him.
John half expects him to start wanking himself off, but it’s quite clear after a moment that the detective isn’t after that at all.
Options: 1) masturbation, 2) radiator, 3) nil
Needing to catch his breath, he pulled away with some difficulty, chest heaving from the effort.
Sherlock; otherwise John would have already abandoned the task of adjusting every little thing of this infuriating microscope. He hadn’t even been aware before that Sherlock was so finicky about its adjustments.
But Sherlock has turned his face away from John as he dismissed him. “Nothing. Unimportant.”
, John thought fondly.
Think, think, think!
His mind had supplied him with this detail before his eyes were even fully set on John: swaying and grinning up at Sherlock as he entered their flat, blue eyes staring up at him.
“Are you saying you enjoy having long wee-wee’s?”
With the sudden snap of the door behind, he jumped, nearly slipping down the step. Horrified at himself, he froze on the spot, shaking his head at what he had been thinking. And in public too. It was a relief Sherlock’s back was still turned towards him for John was all too ready to be swallowed by the pavement now.
John clarified. “Shortly before lunch, we talked about--, you know, and you said you would be amenable for it should I…well, repeat it.”
Procedure.
“Yeah, come on,” John moaned alongside Sherlock as his thumb swiped over the damp head, spreading the fluids all over him with Sherlock crying out and trashing at the hyper-sensitivity.
. Impossible as it seemed, Sherlock couldn’t control this urge for those callous hands and fingertips that all were part of John.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed, finding pleasure at the crude words. His cock twitched in anticapation.
– it was unbelievable how he could have misinterpreted Sherlock’s meaning of ‘procedure’.
But really, sometimes he just wondered what exactly went through that big brain.
“Hmph. Give it a few shakes that should do.”
"Oh. That was brilliant. You know, you can initiate a bit more, right?” John said, realising that Sherlock barely did the initiating at all. “I would like that. I really wouldn’t mind if you…” he trailed off, wondering if Sherlock actually needed more encouragement with these things.
between his legs.
“John,” Sherlock said again, his brows drawn together in a frown, “You’re upset.” It sounded both like a question and a statement.
Or so he told himself when he kept hearing noises from Sherlock's room. He bursted into the room after waiting 8 long minutes.
“Nothing,” Sherlock shrugged, eyes flittering away sheepishly as he twisted his body towards the opened door to his bedroom.
"Jesus, just...sit down, Sherlock. I'll have a look, before I'll put this on you, okay?"
Suddenly a desperate stream hit the white tiles, splashing for just a moment before abruptly coming to a halt again. Sherlock almost mewled with the effort of holding it back.
Shutting his eyes, John drew a hot puff from his chest to let go his frustration.
"Watson," Holmes said anxiously, his face was flushed dark with humiliation at the state of his prick.
193 seconds left.
This was a bit not good.
John washed his hands, feeling somewhat bemused by Sherlock's method of regaining control of his poor bladder. He wondered if the potty dance would make an appearance too.
Sherlock instantly looked alarmed and stared at John with wide eyes, mentally checking what he might have done to put John off already.
Always so extraordinary.
Groaning, his hand sped up, flying over himself as he stroked, stroked, stroked-
John sighed.
Because as strange as it sounded at times the detective seemed almost shy.
“Yeah?” John asked as he slowly rubbed his hand, spreading the soap all over Sherlock, careful to include his balls underneath.
John's commanding voice.
Watson noticed that the word 'small' seemed to put Holmes someplace happy, or at least his cockstand seemed to enjoy it, twitching whenever the word was muttered. Watson suppressed a moan, and ignored his own aching erection.
Against his better judgement, John held his breath as he tugged him out of his trousers, exposing it to the air. Feeling his heart rate spike up at the sight, he pulled Sherlock towards the urinal, carefully aiming his pink cock down the porcelain as he eagerly waited for him to start pissing.
He had to admit that Sherlock was more often than not the center of his attention, so he supposed this was perhaps bound to happen. Maybe John’s sub consciousness simply wanted to let him know that the detective was still safe and sound. But wasn’t this a tad extreme?
Snapping his head toward him, Sherlock’s surprised eyes widened as understanding dawned on him. He struggled for a moment. “John,” he let out, exhaling loudly and sounding both frustrated and pleased, “Must you always be this slow? I prefer the word ‘partner’ over ‘boyfriend’.”
Flickering his eyes around the flat with a barely withstrained hiss, Sherlock bolted up from the couch, squeezing his legs together in an attempt to further ignore his bladder.
He didn’t expect the detective to reply so John went back up to his room and put some fresh clothes on. He yet had to move some of his things to Sherlock’s bedroom. In fact, there were many things he yet had to do.
It was a matter of holding it back, he simply had to turn off the sound of-
“Er, should I continue?” He asks after a moment.
His flatmate needed more fluid, he wasn't drinking enough. The thought suddenly brought up the image of Sherlock pissing uncontrollably, and the way he had leant against John all flustered and exhausted with his pretty cock resting in his hand.
“God, John –
- help me."
“John. I don’t ‘wee-wee’.”
As more things got registered in his head, John realised that his other hand was holding something very warm and soft, something that John seemed to have held on to for the whole night long, if the stiffness in his arm was anything to go by.
John thought he was about to pass out from embarassement.
Shifting on the couch, Sherlock’s foot accidentally bumped John’s shoulder as he moved somewhat ungracefully in his seat. For some reason it took him longer than usual to throw out a reply, making John fleetingly wonder if his question had been simply ignored. Not willing to give up yet, John was about to repeat himself when the detective interrupted him.
Just that John was alone in his upstairs bedroom now because Sherlock didn’t do cuddling and John didn’t feel like sitting on the couch all by himself –
The doctor cleared his throat, and lead the detective to his bedroom.
At his words, a shuddering breath escapes the detective, eyelashes fluttering closed again. “That’s good. I-, you know that…that..”
Gasping, that thought proved to be too much for John as he bucked his hips and came with an intensity that made his eyes roll to the back of his head. Breathless with bliss, John panted with his chest heaving up and down. Bloody hell.
It was now or never. John took a deep breath as he put his hand through the open fly gap, grabbing Sherlock's prick and guiding it out of his damp underwear until John had it safely out of his pants. Quickly adjusting his grip, John held the length carefully between his fingers, eyes quickly darting over it.
Spluttering, John blinked stupidly at the detective. “Can’t you just-, just take a normal piss?”
Four days later, Sherlock was sprawled on the sofa, hands carefully folded over his stomach as he willingly ignored the itch in his arms; his mind was fixated on one particular jumper-dressed Army doctor.
The doctor lingered for a moment longer, before he left the room, washing his hands to make them dinner.
Moving the towel off of Sherlock’s shoulders, John methodically caught all waterdrops he could see - on the back, on the front, on Sherlock’s lush bum –
“The experiment, John,” Sherlock says, sounding distracted as though he is regaining his concentration back on his mould experiment.
But it was true, Sherlock had quite a bit of an adorable little cock.
While heading to grab a flannel, John turned around once more, scratching at his neck. “Well, I hope. Unless you don’t want to –
The lanky git wasn't one bit affected by what had happened, acting as if nothing was out of sorts. He probably had deleted the whole incident or something. Though thinking of it now, he wondered, was that how Sherlock dealt with such things? John gathered that Sherlock must have been somewhat embarrassed, especially when John had caught him …wanking?
Looking down at him, all limp and soft now, foreskin covering the head, John thought he also rather liked Sherlock’s penis in this state. It’s just this
John breathed relieved, and hurried to fetch something cold to soothe the area a bit. He wouldn't forgive himself if there was any serious damage. He opened the fridge and grabbed the packaged peas, quickly turning to the bathroom to get a towel, before returning to Sherlock, who was nervously twitching around with his legs, prick flopping.
Evidently, John
On John’s insistence, Sherlock had drunk two full cups of tea this afternoon before John had dashed out the door to ‘have bit of a catch up’. It was tedious that John had left the flat; Mrs.Hudson certainly would have called their previous interaction a little ‘domestic’. Fact was that John not only was wonderfully caring and kind, John also was an idiot.
Sherlock’s pale face flushed ever so slightly when John looked at him, the brilliant eyes quickly darting away at the question, looking somewhat unsure. John rushed in for reassurance, not certain what the detective was thinking, he continued, “Because this is important to know, Sherlock. I don’t want to do anything that you don’t enjoy and like, yeah? And I’m sorry we’re only talking about this now, we should have done this a bit earlier.” John chuckled nervously, suddenly aware how much they yet had to talk about and figure out in their relationship.
“It’s not… John, I’m not repeating this conversation!” Sherlock hissed out in disdain, visibly upset now.
Drawing a breath, John reached for the zipper, fidgeting with it as he pulled it down; trying to be careful in his ministrations as he recalled that Sherlock wasn’t wearing any pants.
With a dramatic huff, Sherlock plopped down on the couch and heaved his feet up into the air to let John once again struggle with those damned leather shoes. Why were they such a tight fit anyway?
John waited five excruciating minutes before he stopped his fake typing and put the laptop aside, grimacing at his sticky pants. Standing up, he went to the kitchen and shuffled around to boil some water whilst occasionally glancing between the detective and his microscope. Sherlock noticed of course and looked up; his curls were endearingly sticking around his goggles.
Christ.
. Sherlock came beautifully against the wall, sobbing and crying out, and John had held him, aimed his prick against the tiles.
His fingers were getting cold from the wrapped snow in his balled fist.
. His bladder was usually more withstanding than that. This was all John’s fault; if John so insisted for his transport to stay hydrated then it was John’s duty to take care of the resulting outcome of it. God, Sherlock
Sherlock managed to just stifle a shirk, and abruptly sprang out of his chair, while John hastily put the tea and water aside and turned to Sherlock, pulling his pants down to avoid any further burning.
Of course, John had said yes, and he was a bit dumbstruck with how vulnerable Sherlock had looked when John had opened the car door for him and proceeded to put the seat belt around his slim body. John remembered how he had to suppress the urge to kiss his friend right here and then with the promise that it was all fine.
Well, after
YAY, I've got chapter 3, I still can't quite believe it myself!
Under no circumstance would he allow this.
John couldn’t stop his eyes from remaining fixed on Sherlock's length.
But he quickly gives up the attempt and runs a hand through his hair, starting, “Because you know it was rather nice. The holding hands thing, just, it wasn’t part of the experiment, was it?”
After he was finished, of course.
And he is about to do it right here under the damn kitchen table.
"Watson! Kindly spare me your speech! I do require just a moment," Holmes interrupted heatedly. He held onto the wall and moved to the next stair, hissing when his trousers pushed against his throbbing member.
John was starting to get furious, and shook his head, glaring at Sherlock. "Stop it, Sherlock! I've seen how you gulped down that first cup! You need more water, damn it!"
Watson held his breath, scarcely believing what filthy words escaped his horrid mouth. He stared at Holmes, waiting for his reaction. The man shifted on the bed, his neck was delectable pink and his face was clouded with a distressed need to climax, Watson admired seeing his partner so exposed and unguarded.
“It’s good. Very good. Ah, different from what I’d imagined, but . . . good.”
They should have done the talking yesterday, they were idiots. God, who was he kidding? John should have talked to Sherlock right the moment he saw him awake. John shouldn’t have put it off, he should have- -
Blinking at the sight, Sherlock’s breath hitched as John panted through his orgasm, his name on his lips in a half gasp.
John swallowed as he stared at his retreating back.
Which had aggravated him just a bit.
“Oh, Watson.”
Holmes barely had time to rely on his reflexes as he jerked away a second too late, his face was turning white as a sheet, and barely an audible groan past his lips as he suddenly sank down on  the pavement. Wincing, Watson was so shocked by what he'd just witnessed that it felt as if his entire being was frozen on the floor.
“J-John! What are you- ngh, John!”
Everything else forgotten, John straightened his back, and grabbed the bags from the cupboard. Not saying a word, he went to the bathroom with Sherlock striding behind, watching him with a tight expression.
“Colour?”
Sherlock lets out a frustrated breath, glaring at his microscope on the table. “Fine, if you so insist. But do let me elaborate on the fact that I didn’t intend to collect more data on oxytocin and acetylcholine.  I only intended to conduct an empirical experiment with the focus on the nature of your sentiment towards me. And I can verify my hypothesis at last.”
“John,” Sherlock says again, sounding somewhat lost,
And like a wonder it worked. John almost held his breath, waiting for Sherlock's tantrum to emerge, but nothing came.
The doctor watched wordlessly as Holmes put the ice on the crotch of his trousers and intently searched for any signs of relief on his face. But Holmes only made a peculiar noise and Watson was not sure if he should either discern it as pain or easement.
Perfect.
It seemed that mornings such as these were particularly getting to him. With John pattering around the flat, making toast and tea and humming contently to himself, Sherlock scarcely could help it but not
John.
“Clarity, John. You’re upset and I don’t understand. While yesterday without you certainly was...unpleasant, it was alright. Once you returned. Why are you even apologising?”
Well.
Sherlock stuttered, “G-Green.”
“-with the only exception of my coat. Really, John, your insistence to refrain from acquiring an indexed closet is as unreasonable as your insistence to keep on going out with those women.”
The dark wet and not so curly head whipped around, eyes somewhat wide. A moment passed and John narrowed his eyes when Sherlock suddenly angled his front away from John.
The detective shook his head, looking flustered at being put on the spot. His bright eyes darted away from John’s, suddenly appearing tense.
At that point John’s whole world starts to spin, he is sure that he must have misheard, misunderstood Sherlock. Because this sounds like – like –
Sherlock was starting to piss, starting to relieve his bladder,
“Watson, will you stop it already and come up here, please.” Holmes all but demanded in his impatient manner.
Feeling panic rise in his chest, Sherlock angled his front towards the wall, away from John, trying to subtly pinch himself between his thighs. The water streamed down his face, making him sputter.
So very
It made Sherlock's knees go weak. Undoubtedly, he was Sherlock's favourite fragrance.
Another harsh breath leaves Sherlock, and it suddenly dawns on John that he’s nervous. “Hey, you don’t have to say it, Sherlock, you already did say it in your own words, okay?” John says gently, dumbfounded how vulnerable Sherlock really is.
“It’s fine, John. However, I do require breaks. My transport is not used to this successive amount of stimulation.”
"John," he sounded strained.
Sherlock breathed hard as John watched him through his orgasm, quiet and shuddering, he came in quick spurts all over John’s palm, jerking into his hold with flushed cheeks, cock stiffening further against his hand as John kept rubbing him through it, paying extra careful attention to only stroke the hard shaft.
Realising that Sherlock was serious; John quickly adjusted his grip on him. Moving his fingers, he tentatively messaged the foreskin covered head, suppressing the urge to tug on it and have it pinched closed over the head and make the detective piss helplessly through the grip.
He sounded so confused that John almost regretted his joke. “Well, no. I just wondered when that, er,
"Right then. Do you want some more-"
Sherlock seemed startled at best.
“Sherlock, you ‘kay? Wait, let me,” John half carried him, half dragged him from the bathroom to his bedroom, swaying and swearing as he stumbled with Sherlock into the bed. “So bloody hot, Sher-lock. I need, ah god. Need a wank.”
“Yes, I do know. You don’t have to say it, Sherlock. All right?”
Before John could stop himself, the words were already tumbling out of his mouth, “Would you like me to give you a handjob?”
With his other hand he carefully caressed the sensitive sac beneath, cupping it and hiding it in his hand. Holmes' breath hitched, and Watson was aroused to find that none of the man's private parts could be seen anymore, all protected and covered under the doctor's hands.
“That’s too much soap, John. Why are you lathering it up like that?”
with Sherlock. Wanted to
“Not necessary?” John’s mouth fell open -
When John had finished making dinner, he did not expect things to proceed so –
Watson shifted in his seat.
“John!”
“I was recording the touch of your hands, so I could re-visit it in my mind palace later.”
Suppressing a sigh, he tucks himself back into his pants before carefully emerging from under the table; his eyes are immediately drawn to Sherlock’s.
“Well, yes! Hence why it makes me feel like a god-damn pervert! Jesus, how could you not have noticed that, you out of all people?”
John shook his head. He must be imagining things.
himself. John liked to think Sherlock couldn't control himself at all once he was hard, it was an exciting notion that he at least hoped to be somewhat true.
Think, think, think!
Without any further notice, John rounds the table, looks into Sherlock’s wide eyes before leaning down, pressing his lips against the cupid bowed ones and snogs Sherlock stupid on the spot with him responding without a second hesitation. It is exactly what John’s been hoping for this whole while, thinking he is already out of his mind for imagining anything like this could ever happen.
Either they talked about it now, or John would put it off again and again. Truthfully, there never was a good time to talk things through with Sherlock. He needed talk to him now, he decided. John wanted to get it over with already.
“Mm, J’hn?” Sherlock’s deep baritone rumbled next to him, sounding half-asleep and making John jump at once. “J’hn? Mm, where you going?”
Sherlock paced around the kitchen, frantic to find a solution to the given problem.
To being quite so frank, he didn’t feel like watching TV right now. Sherlock’s cuddle rejection stung a bit too much for John to go down again only to wait in vain for Sherlock to join him on the couch.
Maybe it was not as sorted out as he thought.
“Tell me, Sherlock. What do you want me to say?”
And quickly, it appeared to overwhelm Holmes. Mouth agape, he struggled to gasp out the words, breath stuttering. "W-Watson! Too much, too much," he cried, flailing his hands helplessly.
“Majority of workers went home. There being about 39% male employees, it’s unlikely anyone’s to emerge at this hour. Your perceived heterosexuality is therefore in little to no danger of being questioned.”
Sagging against the door frame, John pressed his lips near the dark curls, inhaling. He had been looking forward for Sherlock to do something like this, longing and waiting these last few days for Sherlock to initiate. It felt like he had waited for months and years.
John scrambled away and cleared his throat, feeling more than a bit wrong footed where he stood. "Well then, I'll make dinner, yeah? I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything..."
John felt weak at the sight, hands slowly drifting away as Sherlock finished, cock starting to soften as the spray of water washed the mess one by one away.
He didn’t even manage to add his own socks alongside Sherlock’s carefully build sock index. Actually, he didn’t even manage to add any of his belongings to Sherlock’s room.
And ankles.
. "Okay then, let's get you out of those clothes, yeah?"
Sherlock scoffed, not bothering to look at either of them.
But it was what it was, and John accepted the things as they were.
“Yes.” Sherlock dully said, his reply sounding much like a statement, giving John next to nothing to read into.
Crossing the pavement, John hurried towards it, opening the door of the car and letting Sherlock slide in before he followed him.
“You alright?” John abruptly asks because fuck. He needs a little break.Mainly he needs a break because his own cock throbs in his too tight jeans and desperately needs some relief. He practically has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep quiet while yanking down his zipper, staring at the detective’s stiffening, pretty-pink- -
Unimportant.
It probably crumbled down to the size of a toilet stall, suffering a tremor because there was this distressing need to piss. Must be very hard and overwhelming for that big brain to realize when the transport had enough and, just, took control.
to leave his room and be welcomed by a day filled with John.
His cock.
John was so perplexed by this that he couldn’t even move for a moment.
“Yeah, that’s rubbish. Even before you broke your arms you couldn’t be arsed to do any cleaning up. The whole flat is practically on me, Sherlock.”
It made John lick his lips.
Watson smiled. "Hm, I see what I can do."
“You know, I wondered what you meant when you said ‘would be amenable for it’.” John said, hoping he won’t regret his decision of broaching the topic. Twirling the shoelaces between his fingers, he glanced up at Sherlock, seeing a furrow between his brows.
“What about it?” John let out casually, fighting to keep his eyes up.
“Mm, that too much soap you said? Alright, ah, let me just,” John carefully discarded the foam from Sherlock, instead lathering it up all over his thighs and buttocks.
that left Sherlock all but speechless.
But before John could ask, Sherlock’s hand tentatively squeezes back, thumb almost shyly patting the back of his hand, seemingly trying to convey something. And John at once startles at the strangely affectionate gesture, staring dumbfounded at their interlocked hands.
"Watson," Holmes said, sounding strained. His legs were shaking a little and the doctor steadied them, holding his knees and keeping them spread apart.
Not being able to make sense of this whole thing, John decided to not let go of this conversation.
The detective panted in blissful relief and closed his eyes, barely believing that he was finally, finally urinating. He was so distracted and embarrassed that he didn't notice John playing with his numb and gushing cock.
Sherlock’s chest heaved wildly as he watched John roughly masturbating himself through his trousers and pants. Sprawled over the mattress, sticky and wet in his own mess and much too exhausted to open his mouth about it, Sherlock rather hoped John would clean up eventually.
Watson's heart raced, stomach dropping as regret was starting to daunt him, but then Holmes said something.
, and scruffily he wondered how that came to be. Something in the pit of his stomach told him that he was forgetting something. Blinking, John massaged his temples as he attempted to rid himself from the ache in his head. He never got this type of headache, the sort that also made some people a bit nauseous. Dimly he wondered if it was perhaps caused by Sherlock’s mattress, John wasn’t exactly used to sleeping on such soft surfaces but he normally didn't have too much trouble to getting used to that.
And ‘chew’ he chose for an obvious reason.
last night.
And John thought it was the tenderest kiss of his life.
For Sherlock.
from the hyper-sensitivity. Because he was already so sensitive, it was much too easy to accidentally overstimulate him. And John figured that It probably didn’t take all that much to turn Sherlock into a sobbing mess. But he'll find that out eventually at some point.
“Sherlock.”
what it was all about.
538 seconds left.
Sherlock noticed.
John had half expected to accompany Sherlock because how else would the git get there? He couldn’t even open doors for Christ’s sake. But as it seemed, one of Mycroft’s minions took up the job for him. Feeling a frown on his face, John wondered why Sherlock was willing to go so far as to accept one of his brother’s people; something was definitely out of sorts. Alarmingly so.
“Sorry, but what…what we are by definition? I’m the blogger and you’re the detective, that’s us by definition, I’d say. Or do you mean, ah, the doctor and the genius? I don’t know what else there’d be.” Looking at Sherlock’s openly disappointed face; John scrambled to think of some more words.
Right, he thought, swallowing heavily. He really should’ve gone out and gotten some air before making dinner, might have cleared up his head.
He leaned down and brought the cup to Sherlock's mouth, making sure that the cup was properly placed between his cupid lips, before he continued to heave it up a bit.
“For yesterday. As you’re perfectly aware, my body is merely transport. Nothing sentimental. What you did was,” Sherlock paused, eyes rapidly dancing as if searching for something. “It was . . . acceptable.”
“Sherlock, you can’t be serious. This is about… you know what I’m talking about, right? That bit I did in the bathroom? You know?” John asked insistently, careful to watch Sherlock’s expression.
John approached them, turning to his flatmate with a frown. "What? Sherlock, I thought I told you that I don't mind helping you," his voice was irritated. John wasn't pleased about the assistants.
“Patience, Sherlock.”
And when he did Sherlock almost lost his balance, hips stuttering and legs tripping as John daringly swiped his thumb over the hypersensitive head. The reaction was almost instant. Alarmed, John quickly stopped the detective from falling down his arse, steadying him and laying a hand against his back.
If there was one thing Sherlock detested more than John leaving, it was getting cockblocked because John was leaving -
Mind reeling, a moan passed his lips as the involuntary urge overcame him to just press himself against John, to piss and rut against his jeans where the bulge was and stimulate his cock.
Watson looked down at him and gently curled his hand around his prick, feeling the dainty length pulsate in his grip. It fitted wonderfully in his hand, and like in his fantasies, all of Holmes disappeared in his fist. The realisation made Watson hyper aware of how tight his trousers suddenly felt.
John gently brushed a finger over it, watching Sherlock’s face screw up into a grimace. “Tender. I refuse to wear any pants.”
Sherlock rubbed himself more urgently, not stopping or slowing down a bit.
Thankfully, when the material was tugged down and Sherlock's penis plopped out, there were no signs of a possible burn, but rather a bright spot on the shaft.
“Alright I’ll say it then. And what I’m going to say is that I’m going to take care of this,” he pointedly twisted his hand, giving the shaft a little jerk. “I’m going to take care of your cock, your lovely pretty little cock, and make sure you're good and ready to finish.”
- Sherlock had really needed to   p i s s , he could feel the force behind it, feel and see how it just sprayed everywhere.
This time he seemed to have made up his mind on whether he should say what he wanted to say before. “Don’t be ridiculous, John. That’s not what I meant. I assure your smell is excellent,” he paused, adding, “As usual.”
As if in a trance, John’s keen eyes followed Sherlock’s bum, his mind feeling as clouded as the mirror above the sink. His heart hammered in his chest as the subject of his attention disappeared behind the shower curtain, leaving behind a rather dazed doctor.
, holding his
“Oh don’t you John me! You’ll stop it this instance or need I hold your desperate little cock again, Sherlock?”
It was apparent that Holmes was struggling not to hold himself in such a public setting.
His heart fluttered in his chest.
With the detective's legs nicely spread, Watson carefully touched the sensitive scrotum, gently cradling the delicate flesh in the palm of his hand, looking for any signs of distress. His bollocks were both swollen and red, and Holmes' member jerked when the doctor carefully massaged them.
“I…yes, if there ever was a chance,” he replied, feeling more and more miserable with each passing second.
“Hm?” Sherlock replied distractedly as he moved his head up towards John’s direction as understanding dawned on him.
John sputtered at the thought.
“I’m fine, John,” Sherlock bit out, not liking the sight of John tossing the newspaper aside and standing up. “Where-- Where are you going?”
God, he loved it when Sherlock was
"Right," John said finally, walking out of the room, wondering if Sherlock would notice it if he appeared just a minute or two earlier later.
“F-Fine. Just, don’t stop,” Sherlock exhaled, looking flustered at being so graceless.
Brows knitting, Sherlock stares at him unblinking, his face a mask of bewilderment. It’s not the first time that this happens today. John curses, quickly deciding to cover his slip up with a question.
“Careful, I’m joining in to help you with the shampoo,” he declared, positively startling the detective from behind.
Perhaps Sherlock had overestimated the circumstances.
“Sherlock just-, let’s not talk about this again, alright? And please, will you stand up already? Bit of help here would be appreciated.”
“That’s good. It’s good to know, and talk about this, er-“
It was such a rare sight to find Sherlock like this in the living room that John couldn’t help but smile at the evidence. Secretly, he thought that the mad man looked utterly endearing when fast asleep, and he could barely keep the fact to himself that Sherlock was bit of a drooler. But looking at him now, John could see the plain exhaustion on his face, skin pale with a furrow between his brows. He did look worn out.
The detective shivered, teeth clattering loudly.
Not looking at Sherlock, John quickly searched the table for his phone.
“Hm. Fine.”
Vigorously shaking his head, John darted his eyes away, swallowing with difficulty. “Look, about the clinical detachment, Sherlock, I was serious. I can’t do it. It’s not . . . good. It’s not good nor okay because I cannot treat you like a patient. I just can’t,” he trailed off, frustrated, “So, er, I think it’s best to call Mycroft and ask for his minions. Should I do the call?”
The doctor had some sense to realise that this was a bit not good. Thinking about his best friend like that and pondering over the mental images of the incident over and over wasn't the best idea. He felt almost embarrassed.
“It’s not…John, it’s cold, what were you expecting?” Blinking, John wasn’t sure if he heard right, but Sherlock sounded just the slightest bit defensive.
Further possibilities?
John’s cock eagerly pulsated at the thought and his heart raced with excitement.
“Join me,” he exhaled suddenly, looking down at Watson’s tented trousers.
Cautious, as not to startle him, John guided Sherlock with his other hand down towards the edge of the bathtub, gesturing for him to sit down. That’s the one thing John especially had to keep in mind: to not leave Sherlock standing up when his climax hit him. Because as John has learned quickly, Sherlock became absolutely boneless and limp during his orgasms. So limp and boneless in fact that he couldn’t even manage to remain standing up on his own feet anymore.
This was their day then; he thought as he stole another glance at John reading fully immersed the national politics section.
Needing to catch his breath, John pulls away, gasping with a grin on his lips, “You do mean this kind of sentiment, right?”
Nodding satisfied, John’s eyes flickered over Sherlock’s figure. He was sure the morgue would improve his mood, especially the samples that Molly had put aside for him. Whatever happened, John was determined to drag the detective there whatever he wanted to or not.
He figured dinner was going to be somewhat uncomfortable for the both of them. But seemingly, the only person who simultaneously felt awkward, confused and aroused was John himself. Sherlock being Sherlock was decidedly not.
Feeling hot from arousal, Sherlock clenched down his muscles, hopeful to empty his tender bladder before it became all too much. And as if knowing what was going through his mind, John (wonderful, kind, mindful John) suddenly stilled his hand, asking, “This okay?”
Buttering himself some toast with jam, John finished up his tea and went to the bathroom.
Tracing his hand down, John cupped and fondled Sherlock’s balls through the trousers, enjoying their size. Looking up, Sherlock had his eyes screwed shut, shifting in a way so his sack rubbed more insistently against the palm of John’s hand. God, he was so
not we. As you may have noticed, I currently lack the ability to do so.”
Shaking his head, he gripped the towel around his waist, holding the edge securely in his fist as he met his flatmate in the kitchen. From there it continued to be a silent blur between them, with John putting the shoes on Sherlock and Sherlock dashing off the moment John had finished tying the laces. It was a far cry from a Cinderella scene.
John looked at the oversized dress shirt, trying not to chuckle. Sherlock had ordered several shirts specifically to fit over the gypsum. It was such a ridiculous thing to do and yet the git managed to somehow still look good. It was an endearing if not somewhat frustrating sight really.
“That I was bone fucking hard, Sherlock! You’re not serious, are you?”
“Alright.”
“You sure?” he asked, wanting to ensure himself that Sherlock meant it.
Definitely a sign of desperation then.
He cleared his throat.
Now that he was hidden from the public's eye, Holmes seemed to have dismissed his regard for being discreet. He was now stiffly leaning against the seat, protecting his groin with both hands, his eyes were tightly shut.
The day wasn't even over yet, and his own bladder was starting to ache.
Before Sherlock could repeat his ridiculous 'not my transport' comment, John growled at him, "Don't even bother, Sherlock! Just get it over with!"
To John’s surprise, Sherlock only nodded thoughtfully, unbothered by John’s exclamation. He seemed to be making up his mind about something. Was he…displeased?
With a sigh, he wilfully kept his mind blank all the way through the taxi ride, keeping an eye on Sherlock’s less than subtle shifts in his seat. It was starting to drive him a bit mad.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.”
They were pink and small and delicate. Just like Sherlock's-
“That’s acceptable.”
“Partners?”
Drunk or not, John couldn’t believe what he had done, what he had been thinking, or, decidedly not thinking in the first place.
The zipper of Sherlock's trousers.
Focusing on controlling his pulse and breathing, Sherlock bent up one leg to better disguise his state while his fingers worked around the head of his cock, lightly brushing his glans through his pyjamas and rolling his foreskin while staring at John’s side profile and categorising the many ways he frowned while reading an article.
“What is it? There’s no evidence you’ve been uncomfortable with any of the tasks. It’s been three days. No, it’s something else. And speaking of privacy, I observed you. You’ve been enthusiastic, John. More so than usual, your masturbatory habits have increased the last few days, don’t think I haven’t noticed. Of course my data is not conclusive enough but for as long as I’ve known you, I gather it’s to do with a sexuality crisis.”
Like a bolt, Holmes snapped his gray eyes to Watson. A startled expression formed his face, his mouth was hanging open as if he meant to say something. Instead, a gasp escaped his lips.
Not that John minded –
"Sherlock? What the hell are you --" John turned off the tv and went to the kitchen with his cup in his hand, trying to see what his flatmate was up to.  "Just
“Sherlock, that yesterday was sexual, you do know that right? What we- I did was sexual.”
“John? What’s wrong?”
Not that John was mad about it. He never expected Sherlock to secretly turn out to be a cuddler, but he at least was hoping for some post-sex time on the couch together. That’s what John was normally used to anyway. But with Sherlock it was different.
The evidence of this was even more obvious, John himself had stated so, confirmed – (“God, your cock, Sherlock. It`s just brilliant. God damn
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” John muttered as he left the room to instead go up and get dressed for a date that Sherlock all but ignored was happening today.
John furrowed his eyebrows as he tried to re-edit the case he had typed up last night.
Sherlock gasped with wild eyes, hips starting to jerk. Christ.
"No,” Watson said decidedly, catching the hands and pushing them against the bed sheets. Holding him there, he shifted to kneel between the long legs, peering at the stiff cockstand before leaning down to give the shaft a kiss. "Patience, Holmes."
Watson fixed his gaze on Holmes’ white knuckles. He felt invariably uncertain on how to approach this sensitive subject upon which he had found himself both in as a doctor and friend. From past experiences he knew that Holmes was a patient that was not particularly keen  to have other doctors treat him, he was most insistent for Watson to tend to his wounds and needs. Proper physical examinations of an intimate nature however, was much of a different and unknown matter.
“I’ll take care of this,” he murmured, slowly pumping his hand again, suddenly aware how sensitive Sherlock was.
Instinctively Sherlock was overcome by the need to grip himself, willing to stop any fluid from sullying the material of his pants, but a quick jolt told him that neither of his arms were up for the task.
“Alright. Anything else you’d like to share then? Maybe something I said or did yesterday?”
“You were? And I thought . . . god, we’re some proper idiots, aren’t we? Took us two broken arms so we could get it together finally. C’mere,” he said, wanting to snog the life out of this gorgeous man.
“Alright? That was really nice, thanks. I’ll just. Dry you up some more, okay?”
“Thoughtless,” Sherlock echoed faintly, voice even deeper than normal.
Kudos for KittieHill for doing awesome britpicking :)
Shifting, Sherlock lets his thighs fall wide open, beautifully displaying his balls and small penis, making John’s heartbeat stutter.
Sherlock drew a sharp breath, gritting. “Fine.”
High pitched annoying voice. Tedious.
A moment passed before John realised it was Sherlock that spoke, his voice small and timid.
"Poor little thing", Watson said in playful sympathy when Holmes' member stiffened further, showing and spending its first essence.
“N-Not now, John. Later. I need–
The doctor was pleased that Holmes decided to listen to him for once, and watched with restrained eager as Holmes' nervous fingers opened his trousers, undoing the bulged buttons to reveal his tented drawers underneath. The thin material clung on him and Holmes made it a quick process to free himself, his face a sudden mask of relief as his prick sprang out of its confinement.
“No!” the detective hectically exclaimed. “Don’t stop, John!”
“Better go there, it’s less, ah, less messy,” John murmured as he turned to aim Sherlock down the bathtub, fingers circling his tip as he pulled at his foreskin.
Feeling his face burn, Sherlock shut his eyes, marveling at John’s drunken state. Sherlock doubted John ever would have let out such a thing outloud in a sober state. The tips of his ears were aflame as he repeated it in his mind – ‘
He just bloody hoped he didn't specifically have a Sherlock fetish. John sure had enough dilemmas already - one of them being that he had wanked like a complete nutter today, and still was in a constant state like some teenager. And why was that again?
Holding his breath, he stroked himself in his fist and leaned closer, unabashedly staring at Holmes pleasuring himself.
But Watson paid no mind to Holmes' near crisis, mercilessly holding his rosy cockstand in a tight grip, and giving the tip a loving peck of his lips, over and over, unaware his moustache roughly caressed the glans, stimulating them much too suddenly.
John was so taken aback that he forgot Sherlock stood completely starkers in front of him, though as the detective finally turned around to face the tub; John’s grin faded, mouth parting as he was confronted with the sight of a lush round bum.
ardently John liked sex.
"Of course, John. Why wouldn't I? This is very....good," he said nodding to the soup. John had a feeling he meant something else entirely, but shrugged at it. He wished he only had known sooner how to make Sherlock eat so willingly. If only he had realised the secret lay in spoon feeding him, then surely the detective would have gained a few more pounds already. Really, he never knew what to make out of Sherlock’s unpredictable eating habits. After all, Sherlock just had two damn bowls of soup, and John knew he didn’t even like soup that much, so if this wasn't an achievement then John didn't know what the hell it was.
And god help him, but does he feel eager about it.
. Obviously, the liquid absorption of his clothes wasn't an option. But he needed
Sherlock had his legs crossed, effectively shielding the state of his cock from John's gaze. He cleared his throat, cheeks surprisingly pink, "Your timing is utterly atrocious, John."
Something nagged in the corner of his mind.
Unthinking and desperate, the words spilled out of John. His chest was so heavy with feelings that he thought he was going to burst open any moment. He stared at Sherlock’s back, unsure what to expect.
Well, that wasn’t the least bit surprising, given that his ‘transport’ was now more or less in control of him. Served him right, John thought.
Sherlock's pubic hairs were dark, neatly groomed, his soft penis rested prettily between his thighs, lovely and small, and still so very rosy from the incident.
It was nearly unthinkable that Sherlock had eaten all of his damn noodles. It was the second time in a row that he had finished a whole portion.
John watched Sherlock frown down at himself.
Blinking in his endearingly rapid way, Sherlock frowned at him, eyes dazed. “Is that what people notice when kissing?”
. In fact, the doctor was overly eager to indulge Sherlock at all hours of the day. It was good, mind boggling, for lack of a better word.
Jesus Christ.
John's fingers twitched at the sight. He wanted to hold it again, feel its softness and girth, pull the foreskin back and gaze at its bare tip. He quickly darted his eyes away and swallowed heavily, feeling far too aroused in his pants. Christ, he needed to scold himself.
But maybe the detective just needed time.
He'd be naked then, completely starkers. John felt his cheeks burn at the thought and hastily turned to the sink, hiding his face from Sherlock.
“Yes,” Sherlock sighed again. The detective was barely moving under the gentle spray of warm water, eyes hooded as he watched John’s hand sudsing up his sensitive length, making it all slippery.
Sherlock blinked rapidly at the comforting warmth that John’s hand brought to him. Or to be more specific: To his penis. With his hand cupped over him, Sherlock decided he rather enjoyed the feel of John’s lax hand warming him. It was comforting.
He glanced down at it.
“Can’t. It won’t go down; the zipper is pressing right against my penis.”
"Don't worry, John. It's fine. I've calculated the circumstances, and it's all....fine."
“J-John,“ Sherlock stuttered out, grimacing at the sound of his normally composed voice sounding overly off and not very
“Well, let me get this off of you then,” John offered, leaning on Sherlock’s thigh for support as he got up from his knees and turned to grab the shower head from its holder.
Sherlock needed a cigarette.
And landing on John’s foot.
Another pause passed between them in which the detective stared at John with calculating eyes, scanning him from head to toe. Stiffening, John forced his thoughts to come to a halt, hoping his face wasn’t an open book. He didn’t particularly like it whenever this happened, when he felt so on edge that he worried Sherlock could actually read his mind. Obviously it was rubbish, but it wasn’t like he could just go on and toss away this irrational worries.
He looked up from his pumping hand, up to see Sherlock’s wild expression.
John made an obscene show of filling the cup with water, he poured the liquid, slowly, with an approximately ten inch wide gap, humming to himself carelessly while the cup filled. Sherlock nearly let out a yelp as he felt a spurt of urine escape into his expensive pants.
But John barely heard him as he was too busy staring at the world’s most glorious body. Gorgeous. He will never get used to how breathtaking Sherlock was.
The sight of it made Watson tighten his grip on the coat. He had seen Holmes' member on a few lucky occasions in the turkish baths, Watson couldn't fathom why he was so thrilled whenever he caught sight of it, but he just was.
The half tied shoelaces immediately fell from John’s fingers.
John hastily pushed the picture away before it fully could affect him.
"Get off this man, Sir! This is the police, I repeat."
. Frantic, he instead recrossed his legs, trying to hold himself between his thighs while he jerked his hips, willing for the need to piss to go away.
“Why not?” Sherlock prompted, his furrow deepening between his brows. “You clearly were not appalled touching my penis, your response suggests that you think it un--“
I'm back - yay! I'm rather proud of this chap, hope you all like it!
Sherlock’s nostrils suddenly flared up at the tentative question, whipping his head to the side to stare daggers at John. It was a clear answer to his question. Meanwhile, strands of drenched hair fell over the intense eyes, covering them.
leaving Sherlock behind in exchange for
The press of his lips still tingled on Sherlock’s skin, soft and warm, electrifying his transport with a fiery pleasure he was rapidly becoming more and more familiar with. The feel of John’s hands, touching gently, overly careful, was all memorized and blueprinted behind his lids, and ultimately left a defeated sigh on Sherlock’s lips. John.
With a dry throat, he continued, “I love you, and because of that I can’t stand it. I can’t stand seeing you so dependent on me. It feels like we’ve become something more. You’ve no idea for how long I’ve been wanting to . . .  just, kiss you.”
. Lush and pert – bloody hell.
Four weeks.
He said he liked it for god’s sake.
Teasing him.
"John I really would prefer you hurry up your overly slow motions, I need to conduct an experiment afterwards," Sherlock said, pursing his lips, expression faltering a bit when John raised his eyebrows at him, silently scoffing at him. There were no experiments in the fridge, John had discarded them hours ago, and aside from that fact, Sherlock with both his arms broken like that wasn't in any state to perform one anyways.
It's for an experiment, he says.
Desperate to piss with that pink-pretty cock of his.
John’s unpredictable ways of passive-aggressive communication were yet another part of the mystery Sherlock yet had to solve. As he found, John deceived people by appearing simple, yet evidence suggested anything but. John Watson was a puzzle dressed in unassuming jumpers. The facts rather pointed towards a passive-aggressive and not-at-all-unattractive enigma who used various words such as ‘brilliant’ and ‘amazing’ and ‘lanky git’ to describe Sherlock. There was a complete list in his mind palace that had notes dedicated to John’s qualities:
He started. “Look, about yesterday, Sherlock, I think we should clear some things up. I know it wasn’t in any way professional of me to-,” John stopped then, swallowing hard before he continued, “-to, well. I, er, wondered if you-“
There was a time where he thought there was something between them, but John must have confused it with his own wishful thinking. Ultimately he came to his senses, figuring that it didn't matter anyways. It didn't matter because Sherlock would altogether resent any romantic attempts of his, and sooner or later it'd be over. So what was the point really?
The feel of John's hand on him.
Was the lanky git really sleeping though?
Holding himself in his fist, John started tracing his cock along Sherlock’s frenulum, rubbing it and teasing it, intending to make Sherlock go absolutely stupid with lust. Watching him, the detective threw his head back after a moment, cupid lips parting as a broken noise escaped him.
A moment past.
“I’m...oh! John! John, I need to-“ in a slight panic, he repeated the doctor’s previous words with a ragged breath. “I need you to hold my penis, please.”
Not that it's any of John's concern.
John straightened his shoulders, turning around to watch the fidgeting detective. He swiftly flickered his gaze down at him, but couldn't see anything, the legs artfully covered Sherlock's penis.
“Excuse me?”
- that Sherlock's prick gave a twitch.
“What pray tell, should I do there, John? Surely even you must have noticed by now that my hands are of no use for deploying fine motor skills. Clearly you’re wasting your time trying to make me forget the tediousness of
Watson slowly started stroking him, pulling from root to tip, and lingering on the foreskin to pinch it closed over the head, rubbing it vigorously against the crown.
It was all his transport's fault.
But before Sherlock got the chance to talk any more, least change his mind, John stood up and moved in quick strides towards him, pressing a finger against the cupid lips.
Keeping his touch gentle, he slides the palm of his hand up Sherlock's thigh, until reaching the seam of the trousers, pausing and marveling at the surrealism of it. Above him he imagines to hear a hitch of breath, a bear hint of a small gasp that has John suddenly hyperaware of what his hands are doing - of where they are going to go.
What had happened last night wasn’t supposed to happen. None of it was supposed to happen like this.
A spectacular shade of red coloured Sherlock’s face. It was utterly endearing, and John’s heart raced. But before the detective could answer he was interrupted by the rude ringing of the doorbell.
Putting the plates one by one away, John glanced at the clock, suddenly remembering what he and Molly had planned for Sherlock today.
Sherlock.
Finally, he flickered his eyes to Watson, his expression quickly becoming guarded upon meeting Watson's determined and concerned gaze.
The water kept running down the unmoving form of the detective, spraying down and flattening the curls on top, making some of them cling to his face. John flickered his eyes up and down with what he saw of Sherlock’s side, from his angle it was even more obscene how round and smooth the cheeks of his bum were.
Of course Sherlock doesn't bother with pants. The berk probably doesn't even own any.
“Really, John.”
So beautiful.
John mustn't see him like that.
“I really don’t think you get what--, never mind.” John shook his head, biting the inside of his cheek as he tried to stop imagining his hand wrapped around Sherlock’s perfect
“Sherlock?”
Dragging his eyes up again, John smiled gratefully at Sherlock’s overly watchful face, hoping to communicate his appreciation and love for him.
What a stubborn git, he thought.
The sight made his heart jump.
John’s pace was the exact opposite of Sherlock’s, just like the last couple days, this was how it ended every time after John finished off Sherlock. They hadn’t yet… managed to go further.
John’s face went red as he added, “Why?”
John enjoyed the sight of Sherlock pissing with such urgency, it was wonderful to feel how his urine rushed out of his lovely prick, it was wonderful to hold his length while he let go, it was wonderful to watch how the detective lost control. John just loved it so much that he couldn't help but pet it - pet the sensitive prick in his hand - pet Sherlock's pissing prick.
John gave Sherlock his most loving smile as he straightened his back, turning to the counter to make his detective a generous cup of tea.
Holmes pursed his lips.
Exasperated, John sighed, letting go some of his bottled up frustration. Why had his life to be so damn complicated?
Sherlock stood stock still, frozen, blinking rapidly.
And he most certainly did NOT think about his flatmate's bits.
“John?”
“Really? Well, not in our shower, Sherlock!”
cold.
And John was – oh hell – he didn’t even know. John was hard. He didn’t need to look down at himself to know his cock was hard and stiff against his red pants, tenting them obscenely.
Halting, Sherlock blinked hard, irritated with himself for not having heard the approaching footsteps on the staircase.
Sherlock shook his head while taking off his goggles, looking at John with a curious expression.
Needed to piss.
“But what was this experiment about then?” John says stupidly, “Those damned concentration levels that you wanted to examine while I-, and then-”John suddenly shuts his mouth.
“God, Sherlock,” John let out, voice sounding strangely out of breath to his own ears.
I am SO excited to finally throw this out there - ENJOY!
At once, as if John’s sudden words had struck him, no scandalised him, Sherlock’s breath stuttered and so did his steady stream that rushed out of his flushed penis, surprisingly stopping, coming to a halt.
With a ragged breath, Sherlock buckled his hips frantically, his trail of piss coming in spurts when John slipped his fingers away and trailed them down to his bollocks instead, patting them and feeling their fullness before cupping them tenderly in his palm.
Shrugging himself out of his clothes, John stepped into the shower, turning on the dial with heavy limbs. Standing under the spray of water, it took him a surprisingly long while before his mind started to drift back to the very thing that went on
Ignoring Sherlock’s speech on the system of his closet, he made the detective sit on the edge of his bed, throwing trousers and dress shirt at his face whilst wondering about the room temperature. John shivered like a freezing man as he proceeded to roll a pair of socks on long pale feet. Noticing his own bare feet, that’s when he realised he was still wrapped in his damn towel.
The heck it did!
To see an elegant man such as Holmes in his crisis and listen to his muffled cries was nothing short of how he had imagined it. It was mesmerizing to watch him spill his essence. And Watson quickly followed him, holding a tissue over himself with a short groan.
Watson smiled understandingly and let Holmes catch his breath, thinking he needed a moment. Though he was thoroughly surprised to find long pale fingers twitch against the sheets, watching them travel up to grasp the stiff length that was lying on Holmes’ belly. Fascinated and utterly aroused, he watched as Holmes weakly pulled at his prick, squeezing and stroking himself, watching Watson watch the movements of his hand.
"What in the world are you doing, Sherlock?"
“What? Why are you looking at me like-, oh.” Looking down at himself, John realised his towel had slipped down his legs, doing bugger-all to cover his limp cock.
“Sherlock.” John lowered his voice, not moving his foot as he looked up at him. “Don’t you think there’s something you want to tell me?”
I hope you liked this chapter as well! I promise, I'll do my best to not keep you waiting for too long!
John sputtered as he stared up at Sherlock.
When John finally got his shit together to knock on Sherlock's door and tell him dinner was ready, he at once felt a hot flame travel up his face, reminding him of their last encounter. It wasn’t helpful that he kept thinking about it. Really, it was a bit not good.
“Oh, shut up. Admit you just really wanted a blowjob from your flatmate.”
“Fine,” Sherlock answered stiffly, narrowing his eyes as John stumbled over his way towards Sherlock. “How many drinks have you had, John?”
To his dismay, the doctor suddenly crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows at him as if to say 'really?'.
John crossed his fingers, hoping to hear
"Patience. I'm not finished yet."
And John was quite sure that Sherlock wouldn’t let it come so far as to doing the potty dance. Though the mental picture of his flatmate becoming all desperate while holding himself tightly, strangely quickened John’s pulse.
Turning the shower off, he dried himself off, combing his dripping hair before wrapping a towel around his waist. He needed to talk to Sherlock, sort out this situation before he went completely bonkers. He just hoped their friendship would remain somehow unaffected.
“Blanket,” John repeated as he managed to somehow drop it over their mid-sections with a sigh. “Blanket, Sherlock.”
John wrapped the peas in a towel and without warning, put it against Sherlock's bits.
One thing John was sure about was that he really liked seeing Sherlock get all soft again. Smaller.
Oh god.
It was such an innocent question that it made John all warm inside.
John didn’t know where to start.
“Not what I- alright, never mind. Listen, I want you to urinate so-,” instantly, as though John gave any sort of permission, Sherlock started pissing vigorously, sighing dramatically as his stream rushed out of his swollen length, hitting and spraying the bottom of the tub with more force than he expected.
His Sherlock. So aroused, so hard.

Kneeling down and readjusting his hand into a more comfortable position, John kept up the motion on Sherlock, watching him as he arched into his hold, head tipped back against the wall and eyes fluttering closed with a barely audible pant on his lips.
The doctor in him woke up, full force.
Looking semi satisfied with his answer, Sherlock narrows his eyes, shaking his head. "Really, John. Is your attention span this poor around your girlfriends as well? If the instructions fail to be fulfilled I must draw data from a second conduction. The results are of utmost importance."
covering him below the waist. Blinking at the sight, John watched as the mad man strolled passed him, critically inspecting the food in the kitchen and immediately complaining why John didn't make the thing with the peas.
,” Sherlock breathed suddenly, stressing the last word meaningfully.
Then there was a pause in which despite himself John imagined Sherlock standing in front of the toilet, pajama pants lowered and pulling out his--
"John, I need the plastic bags!" Sherlock stalked right into John's personal space, demanding immediate attention.
John was almost aghast at the notion that Mrs. Hudson might doubt his caring nature. “I- Of course I am, yes. Why? What did he do?” He frowned, not remembering of having heard any noise.
Sherlock pressed his toes further against the couch, letting out a surprised gasp as he flickered his eyes open in a daunting realisation.
Instantly, he halts, not even realising that his hand has adopted a keen pumping motion.
The vitruvian man. The ideal man. John was perfect.
“I...er, well I think we need to talk.”
And John was fond of sex, considerably fond. Sherlock was well aware of this, the data had been plain from the beginning, considering John’s many masturbatory habits and stupid courtings he called ‘dates’, it had been much too obvious from the start.  Now however with Sherlock being the center of John’s sexual interest –
And the fact that Sherlock had to piss. John had a--
Now that Sherlock was dressed, there was no denying that John anything but enjoyed the process of dressing someone up. How was something like Barbie even a thing?
There was a strange look on his face that John couldn’t discern. He hesitated for a moment before he finally said, “Well, I can’t look away.”
With a cautious drift of his hands, he pinched the zipper of Sherlock’s trousers between his fingers, holding the end of it as he moved it right against where the tip of Sherlock’s cock was pressed. Dragging it up. And down. Up. Down. Barely moving it. Just rubbing it a little. Just a tiny little bit. Right there where the head of Sherlock’s cock was pressed. Up. Down.
“And?” Sherlock prompted, eyes narrowing.
Slipping his hands down again, he blindly brushed the button of Sherlock’s trousers, teasing, he fumbled with it only to leave it unbuttoned. Cupping his hand over Sherlock, he felt him twitch under the material of his dress pants.
Sherlock downright looked miserable as his emotions were on full display for John to see. From one minute to the next his emotions seemed to shift quicker than John had even thought possible.
Nothing, absolutely nothing gave John the reason to do this right now, perhaps he was feeling a bit mad and a bit over the edge, but at that point he was so far off to really reconsider his own actions. He was just so annoyed and frustrated with Sherlock and his stupid refusal to drink properly and go to the loo when he clearly needed to, that John felt he needed to change that.
But before he could stop it his cock had already plumped at the idea and John looked down at himself, seeing his hardening cock.
John’s hands were already palming the bulge in his jeans, cupping and squeezing as he arched his back, throwing his head back into the pillow as he gasped for air. “Christ, Sh’lock.”
"What the hell, Sherlock?"
Clearing his throat, John opened his mouth, “Alright then. I think it’s time we’re going to Barts, Molly has some samples for you to--, Sherlock, you listening?”
He surpressed a sigh.
Flustered, John held up his hand, mildly offended. “That’s not…I’m not a sex addict, Sherlock. I don’t plan to wank you after every bathroom visit. That’s not going to happen.”
He didn’t expect Holmes to be so sensitive for touch; it certainly was a great discovery.
John pushed him into the bathroom with one hand on his back and the other on his penis, holding him firmly as he stopped in front of the loo,
What a shame, he thought.
He wasn't sure if it was all fine, after all.
John was the sole exception to this.
