It was shaping up to be quite a sunny Saturday. John's anger had dissipated somewhat after two cups of coffee, three (!) croissants and The Guardian's Weekend supplement. He was thinking about going to a good market, maybe Spitalfields, when he heard his text alert: a bossy and booming "John!" that Sherlock had playfully recorded to annoy John every time he sent a text.
"Well, that's easy." said John and shoved his hands down his trouser pockets. Sherlock stopped to look at him and John continued.
There was a slight pause in which traffic and also a barking dog could be heard from outside.  Sherlock pressed his lips together once and then sighed:
“Really, John? That’s what you came up with?” Sherlock spat.
John tried to act casual while making coffee and toast for himself (none for Sherlock!) and then taking it through to the desk in the front room. He ate very quickly and fairly bounced up to put his plate and cup in the sink.
"Well, not to normal people perhaps, but to me there is only compatibility" he said by way of explanation.
John tried hard to come up with a reply to this.
"You mean we shouldn't mix sex and friendship. You're worried that if we don't suit each other sexually it may be difficult to return to a platonic relationship."
“Well. I’m off to work,” he said briskly.
John’s smile suddenly felt a little strained, but Sherlock continued unperturbed.
"If Moriarty wants to play then so be it!" he exclaimed and looked suddenly cheerful.
“Is it? Already?” John was almost whimpering.
John didn’t feel so inclined to worry about the man’s health after that, but assumed that Moriarty had made it quite clear what the dangers were should David
"Jeez, whatever..." John returned to gazing through the window at nothing in particular.
John, meanwhile, was slowly returning to his old, solid self and his patience with Sherlock constantly snapping and riling was wearing thin. One afternoon, when Sherlock made a snide remark about John’s new, brown corduroy shirt, with a pattern of tiny red horses, he put his foot down.
“That’s true: Because you want to look like a professional. A professional gigolo that is; pretending to be asexual, while flouncing around in expensive suits two sizes too small - and a sheet! A fucking sheet, Sherlock!”
“No one has made it on to it.”
"No! I'm straight!" Still shrieking.
"I...don't indulge very often..." he tried, but John sprang up from his now forgotten breakfast, all mirth wiped from his face and took a few paces toward the door, then stopped.
pull in a club where he felt like the oldest man in the world. She was equally inebriated though, and once they made it to Baker Street and into John’s bed, they fell asleep in the middle of proceedings.
John arrived back at Baker Street early Saturday morning. Dropping his overnight bag just inside the door, he went straight for the kitchen to make himself some strong coffee. While waiting for the kettle he drank an impressive amount of water straight from the tap.
"I have twelve people, who suit me sexually, to choose from."
‘Hmm. Beautiful, really’ thought John. He leaned back, arranging some pillows behind his neck to get comfortable, and continued leafing through the book. Sherlock’s handwriting was beautiful too, with quick, confident strokes. John found himself being drawn in to a longer passage giving a detailed account of an autopsy he must have been present for.
John had never seen anyone looking more like the mad scientist/evil mastermind of any given spy-movie. It did not bode well.
John sighed and looked to the heavens.
John laughed out loud. Fantastic! Even super humans apparently had to get their rocks off every now and then. How marvellous. How very normal! Sherlock stormed back out again:
Another "John!": "
“Yes.”
John had made his mind up now. He was going to build up his very own list! Never mind trying to find a girlfriend – he was going to play fast and loose and he was going to make damn sure Sherlock knew about it. As soon as his shift ended he headed to his local and began ruthlessly flirting his way around the room, making some women slightly pissed off when he so obviously dropped them as soon as they said that they did not in fact want to go to bed with him instantly, and moved on to the next.
He had a flash of five years down the line. Matt resenting the loss of his army career. John a reluctant GP, bored, maybe drinking a little too much. The blazing rows, the stifling silences. Just like his parents. Anything but that.
Half an hour or so of acute boredom later there was the (always unpleasant) rush of sticky moisture as the knot shrank and the alpha finally slipped out of him. He took the opportunity to move, clean up, fetch some water.
‘I didn't quite believe it till I came in here today.’ He laughed nervously. ‘I mean I've seen you round the base before and I thought you were interesting. Plus, I've always liked, preferred being penetrated but until now…you smell -nice.’ McMillan swallowed hard and took a gulp of tea.
'Restless. A bit sore.'
'Dr Watson, this is all Sherlock himself. I think...' The Doctor looked at him awkwardly. 'I think his brother may have requested you as next of kin because he thinks you could help.' She finished.
‘Crampy and hot but not quite…’ Sherlock made a vague gesture with his hand.
'They're cleaning.' Sherlock said, recognising the alpha they'd arrested. The one who was involved with one of the omegas. He was bundling up cardboard while someone else worked with a scrubbing brush and bucket.
'Why would I do that?'
‘You need to persuade them that you're panicking. Both the internal affairs people and Graeme.’ Sherlock said finally. ‘You tell them both that your team is up to something. With Graeme you say you think they suspect you of being corrupt. With the internal affairs people you say you're beginning to wonder if Graeme has someone in your team. You add in the detail that you have information about some patrons of the fancy brothel, the one near my brothers club.’
, John thought with rising irritation.
'What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight? That he is not really trying.' She drawled, looking at Mycroft. 'We wanted to make your brother inquisitive Mr Holmes. We hoped he would find the empress pin for us. Perhaps this will sharpen his mind, taking his brother and his alpha.'
‘Not usually. Scuse me.’ The alpha turned away to look at his phone. ‘It’s my Chairman. The police have been on to him. Apparently they’re telling him it was a suicide.’
‘John, on the luggage, there’s a label. E-mail address.’
John filed the thought away because if the bridesmaids were out of his league this chap was a whole other sport. Croquet or polo-one of those
'No bloody gun.'
'The ones from abroad have it worst of course.' Her alpha chimed in, shooting Sherlock with a look of distaste, John's scent no doubt obvious.
you and I'm..well, we should go.’
'Are you alright?' Sherlock passed his brother a cup of what passed for tea in Molly's office. It had been liberally laced with Scotch from a bottle left over from the Morgue's Christmas drinks at Dimmocks suggestion.
. It was a description of the the taxi driver case. John nervously sipped his wine as Sherlock read. 'You don't like it?' he said finally.
‘Bill I'm a doctor…’
‘He doesn't but what he does have predates his bond, by a good couple of years. In those days he was a street dealer, profitable, ruthless but not exactly big time. Within a year of his bond. You start seeing the the bigger deals, the smart moves.’
‘Not his doctor though.’
Mycroft just smiled.
Sherlock had nothing to say. He knew his brother was right. It had been the terrifying lack of control during heat that had driven him towards drugs in the first place. Forged prescriptions to start with before he'd developed a taste for cocaine. The idea of his first properly clean heat in years scared him.
Greg had a general air of pleased with himself. They all, Sherlock realised, had an air of pleased with themselves. After everything they'd been through recently it made a nice change.
John was obviously fighting his own body's urge to submit, it could be read in the tilt of his face,the softening of his shoulders. Sherlock felt an (unwelcome) stab of pride because Lestrade hadn't had this effect on the omega. He wanted to touch John's hair but his balance was too off with the crutches. The omega arched expectantly.
That, Sherlock realised, was an interesting, appealing thought. He didn't as a rule. Outside his heat physical desire was largely dormant but there was something about the idea of John thinking about him…
There was a moment when the man licked his lips, considered, before speaking with a certain amount of pride. ‘Most people would be.’
'Won't we, have to give a statement or something?'
‘Threats and promises.’ Sherlock said.
.’ He has said, shrugging when John delicately brought it up after Sherlock had mentioned his spare room. ‘
‘Starving.’ John replied. They started to walk.
He hovered round a display of special edition scotch miniatures. The labels elegant little landscape pictures. The glass of cold Sauvignon Blanc was going down a little too easily in the stuffy room.
'Something to do with his blood tests.' Mrs Hudson said, putting shampoo and the pyjamas into an overnight bag.
Sherlock looked up sharply. ‘Do we have a list of places they used to own, have sold on recently?’
John was now sitting on the sofa beside Mrs Hudson who had taken it upon herself to keep them both company. The landlady was absorbed in a jaffa cake and some daytime TV abomination, antiques by the look of it. John was looking at him carefully.
John had thought he was getting away with the gun, not least because harmless little omegas wouldn't be expected to know what to do with them. The element of surprise had got them out of trouble more than once.
‘The graffiti was a threat Sebastian.’ Sherlock said evenly, making sure he was heard by the restaurant generally.
'It will be hell you know.' Sherlock said flatly.
John began, almost unconsciously, to stroke himself. Slow but in earnest as Sherlock took his trousers off and sat down on the blanket, licking his lips as he began to do likewise.
'It won't be here.' Sherlock said softly. I know you’re trying to protect me but this is one of the most secure transport hubs in Europe, it won’t be here. They’re too good for that. They’d consider it a wast of effort.’ John frowned at him.’What?’
'How did it go?'
John was jealous and,Sherlock realised, Molly had caught the subtleties in the conversation before he did. She had turned away to flip through her paperwork.
'You don't feel any urge-at all?'
John was collapsing against him and the alphas arousal was flooding his own body. Making him consider options that were totally out of character, like taking John here, against the wall.
‘ Rachel!’ He looks at everyone triumphantly. They all look back at him blankly.
‘Tea in the pot. There was bread and some eggs left so I did French toast.’ . ‘You'll be hungry.’ He glanced at Sherlock, a faint wicked glint in his eye. It had the feeling of an echo of something long gone and Sherlock felt a little sad for a moment. He arranged himself a mug of tea and took a long fortifying sip of the hot liquid.
‘Work, it’s complicated.’ Sherlock said, this slightest sharpness in his tone as he gingerly set down a tray in the only clear spot on the coffee table. ‘It’s for Scotland Yard. Financial records, I’m looking for irregularities.
“Hey,” he said, “don’t worry. I won’t let you fall.” He squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “Promise.”
“Wait!” Sherlock said, right as they were about to exit. “Molly!”
John’s head, which had been steadily lolling lower and lower towards the desk, shot up as if electrocuted. Mrs. Darcy, unbeknownst to John’s sudden and immediate shock, continued reading off names. Except John wasn’t listening anymore.
Emma canted her head. “Well, it won’t be as genuine if I tell you right now. I’d like to record it while asking, if you don’t mind. But if you change your mind at any time, I’ll delete all the footage right away.”
John took a step forward so that a foot was in the junction of the doorway.
John smiled. “As long as it’s not Cocaine.”
The army was a breath of fresh air, dappled with the spice of gunpowder and sweat. No one talked about their quirks. No one cared about his gloves. John Watson was compacted into the crowds, a man amongst thousands, none different and all alike. He ran with his men, he fought with his men, and he killed with his men.
John forced his mind to come up with something. Anything, goddamnit.
John absentmindedly doodled a few more flowers in the corner of his lab book, which was turning out to be quite the garden. In his defence, it wouldn’t be
“It’s fine, John,” he finally said. “It’s just a crush. It’s stupid.”
better kiss.
ridiculous,” Sherlock scoffed. “My experiments are perfectly controlled.”
Sherlock smiled, his lips tight and his eyes tinted with something bitter. “Anywhere you want.” He took a step back, letting the porch light bathe over him, shrouding him in a shadow-cape of silhouettes.
Sherlock shook his head. “John, I think you’re taking this a bit too seriously.”
“Try again?” Emma suggested. “Maybe they were busy.”
“You’re cleared, mate,” he told the man across the table. “Sorry about all that.”
“And what would you know about quirks,” Sherlock muttered, and the door shut before any of them could say more.
Sherlock nearly dropped his cup. “What the
“You should take those off.”
Sherlock paused, and then relaxed, shoulders dropping as he blew out a deep breath.
“Ah, thank you, Molly,” Sherlock said, stepping forward, a gracious smile already on his lips, turned up to the tens. John bit his tongue.
Sherlock turned a look on Lestrade and sniffed with disdain.
“What the
“Second lesson of skating,” John said, now at a steady speed. “You have to get used to gliding, and the best way to do that is to do it
Sherlock pursed his lips and John kissed him again, just once, chaste before drawing back.
Good god, Chemistry was boring. And simultaneously much too complicated for John's muddled, sleep-deprived brain to understand.
“Aw, thanks, sweetheart,” John said, and skated faster.
No, John wanted to say. It wasn’t all; there were just so many words that they all pushed and shoved and got snagged in his throat so that all that slipped out of the chaos was, ‘OK’.
“Huh,” John said, “what’s that?”
“Tell that to the piss cup,” Lestrade said, and shoved Sherlock into the passenger seat and slammed the door.
“His specialty was an ice storm. He’d make these great, big shards fall from the sky. He sent Mummy to the hospital, once. That’s when he moved out. When Sherlock went to university, we all worried, but he came back with his hands bare, no ice in sight.” Mycroft smoothed a hand down the length of the umbrella, his expression nearly wistful. “Sherlock can control himself. He has made his choices, and this is what has come of them. It’s not ideal, but it is what it is.”
“First of all, that’s literally you,” John said, “second of all, let me rephrase that: I’d definitely be jealous if
like rotten fish and eggs, and Chainsaw, well, he just breezed right by it. Not a care in the world. Peed all over the carpet.”
going to get distracted by a cup of hot chocolate.
"I don't like dances."
Sherlock opened the door—and then stepped back, nearly stumbling, when a splotch of salmon pink streaked out of the laundry room and down the hall.
A car pulled up fifteen minutes later, black and sleek.
“Make me.”
“Oh, she loves you all right,” was John’s response.
By the end of the night, the kitten had recovered to nearly full energy, thanks to John’s constant coddling and pampering and attention. Sherlock was reduced to running back and forth from the kitchen, fetching warm water to mix with the cat milk formula, exactly 38 degrees and steaming.
"Not if he didn't know."
John was flabbergasted. Sherlock had three moods: sarcastic, sulking, and sad. Who was this miracle worker?
"Damn
“Okay, then, John and Sherlock,” Emma said, her voice shifting back into something serious. “The question I want to ask you is: do you have a crush?”
It moved once again. Trailing up and in, over to the side. Petal-soft against the shell of his ear. Painfully hesitant, barely there, as if he were something fragile (something precious).
"Why the hell not?"
He didn’t bring it up again.
Sherlock was silent for so long that when he finally spoke, John had already gotten to the clean-up and evidence removal procedure of his plotting to murder Mycroft.
John whirled around so quickly he lost his footing on the rung. For a second the air whooshed in his ears and the ground rushed up to greet him—and then strong arms wrapped around his waist and hoisted him back into place.
Sherlock scowled and ducked his head back, disappearing into the kitchen where he was probably making some fresh new biohazard on their dining table.
Sherlock placed his palm right on top of John’s hand, five firm lines of heat bleeding through. “Slower,” Sherlock said. “Or you’re going to splash it. Slow, smooth, and steady. Like this.” He guided John’s hand to move in a gentle, wave-like motion. “Now, turn. Remember: slow, smooth, and steady.”
When the movie was over, Sherlock said, “I know this wasn’t part of the plan but I have another gift for you,” and pulled out a box of chocolate croissants. The tag read,
Sherlock hummed.
One of which was standing right next to him. Sherlock Holmes was the first thing people had warned John about when he first entered the university, hushed words accompanied with side-eyes and a twist of the mouth that told Sherlock’s enigmatic and cold-as-ice attitude. Whatever you do, don’t try to make friends with him, they had said.
“But John—”
A hand passed over his arm, hovering for a moment before settling down, a feather-light touch. Sherlock’s fingers were warm and felt hot on his skin.
-+-+-+-
Sherlock paused, surprised.
"Oh, you bastard," John whispered. "Since when?"
John gawped. “You mean you actually did that? Wait, hang on.” He turned on his phone and scrolled through the plethora of messages. “‘If you were an enzyme, I’d be DNA helices so that I could unzip your genes.’” He looked back up to Sherlock and pulled his best
John put an arm around the other, pulling him in close. He tucked his face into Sherlock’s hair and inhaled the sweet, fresh scent, the familiar brisk sharpness one carried after being outside too long on a perpetual winter’s walk. No other word for it than
Sherlock seemed to fight him. Once John had reached his shins, he would trace his way back up to find that the sleet had reformed onto his neck, growing a fractal of shimmering frost. John didn’t stop. The occasional flame skittered up his fingers and scorched Sherlock’s coat. John lost count of his breaths inside his head.
“Oh, did you now?” John said coolly right back, slick as hail on a windshield. “What brought this special occasion on?”
"Why?" Sherlock said. "What is so utterly important that both of you are acting so secretive about it?"
“Oh, come here,” John said, and dragged Sherlock in with their interlocked hands to kiss him, hard and rough and giddy.
“Sherlock,” John said.
Sherlock hummed. “Got it.”
He dragged the ladder over from their closet and propped it up against the stove.
He heard the door to the station open, and then two pairs of footsteps rapidly approaching his office. Shit. He swivelled back to his desk quickly and opened his computer, furiously trying to aim the mouse cursor at the ‘x’ on the top right of his window, where he had been playing Solitaire for the past two hours.
“Hello, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said, picking up the rope where John had dropped it, slack. “Is there something wrong?”
Rosy pink turned to red. “Shut up,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes, the previous expression on his face disappearing in an instant.
(Through the disbelief and awe and shock, there was the bitter tang of irrational hurt. Because John had nursed and soothed his little torch for Sherlock with the comfort that, even if John couldn’t have him, no one else could. Except apparently that wasn’t even true now, and the shred of comfort was replaced with a simmer of
“Do you know why Sherlock’s acting weird?” John said with no preamble.
Molly repeated in awe.
“You distracted me!”
Sherlock inhaled. Looked at the kitten, cradled in John’s arms like something precious. Barely shivering, the tips of its fur darkened and faintly trembling in the grey air. John was bent over it with his head peering down, one hand with fingers splayed out and held over the kitten’s head, protecting it from the weather that kept puttering on—such was London.
drop the ice princess act and just help me already?”
John woke up, got dressed, and blearily began trudging his way out of his room, hopping on one foot as he yanked the ankle of his left sock higher. He opened the door and nearly barrelled straight into a white fluffy dressing gown.
Her name was Abby, and she spun tapestries of silk scarves and woollen hats with a dash of her quirk, weaving in just a trickle of something altogether special. On his tenth birthday, John was presented with a pair of leather gloves, woven in with the finest fibres from an old ebony tree.
Sherlock glanced over John’s shoulder. “You know him,” he said.
When Sherlock was out in the morgue tying up the last of the loose ends, John walked up to a blinking light from a Sony camera on the corner of the street, and said, “I need to speak to Mycroft. Now.”
John laughed. “I did. Quite a while ago, actually. He told me what had happened.” He let lazy, glowing embers dance along his palms in the colour of sunset skies. He grazed them down Sherlock’s spine, absentmindedly. He spoke with hesitation. “Sherlock, did you do it on purpose? I mean… Sebastian. Did you let it happen?”
Sherlock hummed and moved closer. Their shoulders bumped. Sherlock’s breath passed over John’s ear. John turned his head very slightly to the side. Sherlock moved away.
I can only accept the circumstances. You…” His grey eyes shifted into a peculiar scrutiny. “Your quirk is very special. Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, was it? Afghanistan? We would’ve found you otherwise. But it seems as if you’ve come to Sherlock anyway. You’re different from the others—if you’re willing, I can foresee a few fortunate futures. However, heed a warning I’ve learned over the years, from a brother to a friend: you can’t fix frostbite with a third-degree burn.”
"Knew what," Sherlock said, not meeting John's gaze.
Holy shit. What the actual fuck.
“Tea?” Molly said, voice hushed. “Are you sure it wasn’t drugged?”
Okay—maybe a lot.
Sherlock raised his head so that the light glinted off his eyes.
"Yeah," Sherlock said, eyes dancing with amusement.
Miranda tilted her head and rolled her eyes playfully. “You’ll be fine,” she soothed. “John. Take them off.”
“Alright, you two, play nice,” John appeared out of nowhere, grabbing Sherlock by the shoulders and steering him away. “Sherlock, help me sweep up all this litter.”
“You look like a housewife,” Sherlock informed John during a sparse moment of rest, leaning against the kitchen wall and watching John gently tickle the kitten’s stomach with two fingers.
John smiled.
“Happy Christmas,” Sherlock murmured against their parted lips.
impossible chance, one of your ridiculously-dangerous experiments self-combusts in the middle of the night.”
Right when John was going to start borderline-nuzzling him, because he
“Aw, shit,” he muttered, pressing his fingertips into his eyes.
Sherlock’s face paled.
Mycroft stopped pacing. His gaze fixed onto where John’s hands were clenched in his lap. “That’s Abby’s work, isn’t it?” he responded.
“You know what, nevermind,” he muttered. “Let’s just watch the movie.”
“You’re so in love!” John exploded.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Hello,” he said sardonically.
"This is awful," Sherlock declared.
The bedsheets were Egyptian cotton, and it singed under John’s fingertips. He took his time taking Sherlock apart, piece by piece, luxuriously. He ran his hands down the planes of Sherlock’s chest. He traced every feature on his face, coaxing his fingers across his eyebrow and stroking a thumb past plush, parted lips. He let his hands grow red-hot in the way he hadn’t allowed them to in a lifetime of hiding. He sighed at the heady relief of Sherlock’s skin, chilly like the first freshly-fallen snow. Soft noises escaped from Sherlock’s mouth. John swallowed them like he was starved. The air grew hazy, twirling with tendrils of steam, and the room filled with the smell of smoke.
Sherlock made a noise of assent. John scrolled down further, scanned the address and name. “Looks like the place is called… Wilkes Industries,” he read out.
John’s mother nearly earned the title herself, her protectiveness over her son was so fierce and so complete. She took her son’s hands in her own and stroked them gently, caressed them with the softest of touches, murmured that he was perfect and strong and beautiful, her beautiful boy. When he came to her with teary eyes and a runny nose, his collar singed and his hands clenched sharply behind his back, she coaxed them out from hiding. Kissed his palms, and taught him to control his breathing, to let his mind relax, let the anger dissipate into the air, swirling like smoke from a blown-out match. She sang to him on sleepless nights and soothed his frustration with an ocean-deep melody. Their dining table was freckled with blacked-out burns. His mother called them beauty marks.
It lingered, hovering, hesitant. A millimetre, a hair’s width apart, the faintest flutter of butterfly wings against his skin. John shut his eyes tighter, a tugging in his sternum growing in intensity to the point of pain, a flickering sputter of sparks unfolding in his chest.
Sherlock was holding something out to John. A pair of gloves.
“I needed to ensure that you were to be trusted.”
Sherlock did nothing. Then he blinked like a machine gun for a few seconds.
“That’s what I said.”
“Vetoed,” Sherlock said immediately, mind dashing to thoughts of fur in his mouth and claws down his arms.
So obviously John needed to try to make friends with him, and now, nearly two years later, he couldn’t understand where the hell those people were getting their ideas from. Or maybe, alternatively, he fully understood where they were coming from, but there was something about himself specifically that, when others glanced off Sherlock’s personality as if burned, John was drawn like a moth to a flame.
“I’m Sherlock’s partner,” John said.
“Sure,” John said. “I’m John. Watson. Second year med.” He gestured loosely towards Sherlock, who was standing next to him. “This is Sherlock Holmes. Second year, undeclared, though I’m pretty sure he’s just stalling at this point. God knows he could ace any major he chooses. Maybe criminal defence, though, or something in chemistry. His brother went the law route already, and with the way he talks about Mycroft, I’m sure being alike is the last thing Sherlock wants. But then again—”
John stared at it and felt as if it radiated some sort of inexplicably arrogant energy, as if it were sneering at John and daring him to question its authority. He opened his mouth to holler for Sherlock before a second consideration made it snap shut. He’d find out sooner or later. (That’s what you said about the bees, a part of him whispered ominously. John told it to bugger off.)
“Yeah,” John said.
“Enough.” Sherlock’s voice carried a promise that resembled a warning. “Your girlfriend of over a year just left you, and you’ve gained ten pounds in the past month. You are slowly but surely descending into methamphetamine addiction. There was nothing to move on from. We need to know the location of Peter Hochins.”
At that, Sherlock fell quiet.
“There are three vials of chemicals in the drawer next to you that will prove to be highly toxic once exposed to oxygen in even the slightest leak. There are over half a dozen concealed weapons in this room alone. We are currently blazing a trail towards a dangerous criminal who has proven many times their capacity to kill.” John had turned around to look at him at that point. There was a very faint smile tracing his mouth. “I don’t think an open flame is the most of our worries.”
Fire was rarely known as a quirk. So unpopular, there hadn’t been a case of it for over a decade. The controversy was harsh, with scathing opinions upon its ability to wreak danger and havoc to society when gone uncontrolled. An arsonist’s dream come true. The elementals were commonly riddled with such stereotypes.
“Oh, thank God you’re still here,” Lestrade said, sounding utterly relieved. “Listen, I think Sherlock’s using again.”
“Behave,” he mumbled at her. “That is, if you want any of Mrs. Hudson’s tuna treats ever again.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, but whatever he was about to say was interrupted as John leaned in and kissed him: slow, smooth, and steady.
"Nothing more," Sherlock said. "She told me to ask you directly."
“It’s just a bloody cat,” John said. “You said it yourself—she was going to die. I know you wouldn’t have just left her there, either, so will you
“Hey,” John said. “So I got a bunch of texts.”
“You will be in charge of the litter box,” Sherlock said snippily.
John let out a yelp and nearly jolted out of his chair for the second time in five minutes.
“Yeah?” came the reply. “I wasn’t taught too terribly, then, I suppose.”
"It... really is," John had to agree.
“Mmhm,” Sherlock said. “Now, shall we go talk to his fiancee, like I suggested in the first place?”
"No, he doesn't."
"What can I say?" Sherlock shrugged. "I'm a 'hot commodity'."
“You knew about my quirk, the first time we met. You knew about Sebastian. You knew
Jesus, he thought, and thumped his head against the wall, hard enough to sting. He had gone and made a goddamn mess of things, hadn't he.
“Forgo the past tense; you’re driving me insane.”
“See?” he murmured. “Love bites.”
“It was hardly a difficult estimate,” he said.
Oh, fuck, John thought. "Well. Um. You see, I."
'Thanks.' Sherlock said, not really sure how to respond. 'Do you miss her?' Lestrade looked over at him and he immediately wished he'd stayed quiet but Lestrade was replying.
Just then Sally's phone pinged. ‘Dimmock has a warrant signed. Does your brother have a judge chained in his bathroom or something?’
I'm the event the last few days leading up to his heat were exhausting. Helping Lestrade chase a serial killer to ground in one of the city's seedier districts. Sherlock's knowledge of the back lanes and alleys had been what finally caught him but only after a struggle on the bank of the river.
‘Next time.’ John was right there with him anticipating the moment when he would feel Sherlock’s semen hit his belly. ‘Plenty of time for that love.’ He sloppily kissed Sherlock’s open mouth. Reflecting that this felt a hundred times more intimate than the last time he’d had penetrative sex and that it would be over too soon. ‘Are you getting close? I know I am. Thinking about you inside me.’ He had a sense of Sherlock’s muscles tightening a notch and the movement of hips and hands losing rhythm. ‘I want to be able to feel you for days.’ John finished with the cringe worthy porn line but it did the trick. Sherlock began to come.
Sherlock realised that John’s hand had relaxed and he was the one maintaining the connection.
‘Go on, enlighten me. Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world – you’re quite right. How could you tell?
'Bloody hell Sherlock.' John muttered.
‘So, was it all the sex you found so interesting or was it something he did while you were out on a case?’ Molly looked at him pointedly.
John was still looking things over when the omega appeared beside him, silent on bare feet. Wearing only a pair of military issue shorts.
'Oh-well congratulations.' John said, moving to hug him, mindful that Joe was a mass of sensitivity. He found tears springing to his eyes and he hurriedly took his leave. Taking the tube rather than a cab just to give himself the extra minutes to pull himself together.
They’d barely spoken about that night since, due to John’s embarrassment. Now John was bringing it up because he knew that Sherlock loved to talk about how he’d solved a case. That it was likely the best way for the detective to overcome his own bashfulness.
'With good reason.' The omega took a gulp of wine, her voice a little too loud. 'You know what happened after that boy escaped.'.
John let himself in, the scent making itself known in a sudden rush as the door opened. He carefully locked it behind him. ‘Matt?’ He called out softly. Not wanting to startle but knowing on some level that the omega would know he was there anyway. He glanced around. Bill had been thorough.
The entire terrace was being refurbished.The sooty brick spruced up and the tired interiors modernised.
' I spoke to someone yesterday that I used to work with who's in CID there. Made out I was being investigated for something and I was trying to get a feel for the internal affairs people.'
The place, including the bathroom, was spotlessly clean. Lots of bottled water and a large box of various high energy, non-perishable food was stacked on a table.
. Just you look a bit-sit down before you fall down.’ Sherlock swayed, faint. The tone was brisk but gentle and he found himself firmly moved back to the couch.
‘Sorry,’ John broke in. ‘There's no medical angle?’
' It's a good thing, means they're taking you seriously.' John replied. Joe carefully folded the paper and tucked it in his pocket, looking unconvinced. He fished out a business card at the same time, handing it to John.
‘So the erm money is that…’ John started awkwardly, it almost seemed vulgar to bring it up.
John made tea while Sherlock made a mess. He’d pulled out every piece of paper they had on the serial suicides, the jade pin business. He was shuffling them like cards on the floor. ‘What are you looking for?’ John said quietly, not wanting to break his flow and getting no response.
‘He’s bonded into money, a business I think but not happily. The watch is older, cheaper, sentimental perhaps. Probably belonged to a relation who did manual work given the dents. They weren't caused while he was wearing it, his hands are unblemished, soft. Everything else, clothes and so on, is new.’
‘Yes.’
‘Well, for what it’s worth, that night- You came across incredibly sexy and confident with it. Out of interest, how far were you actually prepared to take it?’
‘What do you both mean?’ John said, confused, tired, irritated.
'Yeah I remember but never mind that I took a...What the hell?' John pulled roughly at his scarf, exposing his throat to the night air. Fingers cold and professional against his skin. 'These are new-thats why you were hoarse!' John took a step back, eyes fierce.
John, feeling thoroughly taken care of, let his eyes fall closed as he breathed in the alpha, letting Sherlock's scent envelope him. The first tendrils of climax beginning to curl deliciously in his toes. A discordant noise from the alpha broke his reverie, he opened his eyes.
'I am, but I'm not quite sure how you would come to understand that.' John said, sipping his coffee and settling in for the usual verbal sparring match.
'I'll walk you in Molly.' Sherlock said uncertainly, looking to John who nodded in encouragement.
#########
‘She didn’t think about her daughter. She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt.’ Sherlock said, agitated at the supposedly professional detectives inability to apply logic. Logic that would serve the dead woman better than this sentimental nonsense.
Sherlock looked at him blankly, apart from the water when he got home he had no idea.
‘Digitalis. A crude but effective poison.’ Sherlock glanced at the small audience. ‘Or it would have been. Rather blows a hole in the self defence angle. Don't you think?’
'Care for a little legwork?' Mycroft looked at him and for a moment it was like they were children again, off running through the woods executing some mad scheme.
'Very little, I know he was taking it, told me he developed it himself.'
‘Anyway, what now?’ John said, he’d taken out his own notebook and was flicking back a few pages. ‘You mentioned his house? Gray’s that is?’
‘Do you know you do that out loud? Ready?’ John nodded and followed him back in through the bar and into the main lobby. John, jogging to keep up, realised that endless legs don't just look pretty, they're a bugger to keep up with.
He followed William through the double doors and up an elaborate staircase noticing as they climbed that the back of William was every bit as appealing as the front. The velvet encasing a generous and well shaped arse.
The alpha was a few years older than Sherlock. An insomniac, workaholic, a runner currently swimming for exercise due to a hamstring injury. He shared a tailor as well as a club with Mycroft. That much was all obvious.
'Yeah, so-I'm all over the place. What with me having been on suppressants for so long before I stopped.'
Matt smiled at the ceiling. 'Three more weeks.'
He made a slightly separate grouping of the images Raz had brought today. Staying on the chair as he pulled out his vibrating phone.
starting to relax
'They won't let him in here dear.' She answered the question his dry throat refused to cooperate in asking. He heard the hum of ventilation units on the ceiling and understood.
The doctor approached them, Introducing himself as Dr Murphy and gesturing Sherlock into an empty room.
‘Don’t you? I know they've got to try something but if I were Graeme I’d take him somewhere well off the beaten track. How many half derelict places full of smack heads do you think he knows about?' She chewed her lip.
His thoughts were interrupted by the door.
‘So anything on the shooter?’ Sherlock said casually, aware nothing would be so suspicious as a lack of interest on his part.
They found a quiet corner and made their calls. Sherlock coaching Lestrade through his calls to both Graeme and internal affairs. He didn't have to fake the required edginess. Then he called his brother.
'Certainly, Captain John Hamish Watson of the fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and then my brother practically
He realised with a violent clarity. 'For what it's worth I'd feel the same either way, regardless of who were to... I...' He stopped embarrassed realising the implications of what he was saying, that he didn't want this to be a one off. '...I can't say I have much experience either way.’
John turned to lie on his belly, propped on his elbows to look at Sherlock who was lying on his back, fingers clasped behind his head, staring at the ceiling. The brain was definitely turned back on.
' It's faint but-getting stronger.' John said chewing his lip but relaxing slightly. A hostile alpha would have cornered him by now- well, they would have tried. He'd seen off more than his fair share in the army.
John first thought was that he'd lost his erection, no big deal, he was nervous. John gently slid his hand between them. That wasn't the problem, far from it. At the base of the alphas still very hard cock a knot was beginning to form.
'I really do have to go and get ready though.' The omega quickly moved to peck him on the cheek and then went off to his room.
Sherlock waited outside for Lestrade to settle things with Sally. Mycroft had texted.
Sebastian had been one of the the first alphas he’d used after he decided to start managing his heats this way. Sherlock hadn't yet refined the process and though he had been clear about it being a one time only Sebastian hadn't taken it in. It became obvious that Sebastian had assumed a successful heat spent together would lead to something more and pretty much implied that a junkie like Sherlock should be grateful have him. It didn’t help that their parents knew each other, moved in the same old money circles.
For various reasons he had no interest in a bond but he did very much enjoy what he described as the ‘pure physical release’ of a heat. The effect was, however, greatly reduced by a physical barrier so recent clean results ,on both sides, were essential. Sherlock handed over the crumpled page for inspection like it was late homework, accepting a neat plastic folder in return.
It was only five minutes before John hurried over to get him to come and look at something.
She raised her eyebrows. ‘You know what. Those readings are what you'd expect with an established bond. That paper I showed you…’ She started to flick through a pile of journals on a shelf.

John had always loved to watch him work, especially once he realised, quite early on in their acquaintance, that Sherlock had no idea he was even there, so complete was his focus on what was in front of him.
Besides, he trusted him completely.
a message for someone. Who,would clearly, depend on where it could be seen from.
' I know you probably expected more.' Sherlock said, stirring the remains of his porridge.
Sherlock's phone chimed and he chuckled, showing it to John.
'Well we could look into this. If I'm being forced to visit my parents tomorrow you could indulge me with a little breaking and entering afterwards, hmm?'
Sherlock raised a soapy hand and John didn't complain as he ran it through his hair. Pulling John towards him he kissed the top of his head. They stayed like that for a few seconds, inhaling each other. John was now remembering how, that morning after he'd reluctantly untangled his limbs from aroused alpha, he'd got himself off in the shower and he couldn't help but wonder if Sherlock had done the same.
'Don't you start going all embarrassed on me. I get enough of that at work. Treating me like some delicate flower. I've got time.' John said, opening his medical bag.
‘Molly…’ His tone was warning.
'Come on, we'll have a proper lie down for half an hour, then a quick shower before bed.' Sherlock meekly followed, no danger of that happening at any other time so John enjoyed the sensation of being unchallenged.
Oh, I’ve been too slow, I’m not usually slow after…’ John cleared his throat, red faced, stopping Sherlock dead while Lestrade looked embarrassed and the rest of the police suppressed giggles. ‘She didn’t have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone, so it’s a smartphone, it’s e-mail enabled.So there was a website for her account. The username is her e-mail address and all together now, the password is?’
'Anyway that's why I needed a fiance quick. It was an excuse not to touch the girl. I thought if I said I had a male omega it would be more convincing. I was on the spot, it was the best I could come up with.'
' Yeah but not the way you think. I thought about it, lying beside you but I didn't want to take advantage.'
‘I'm coming too.’ Sherlock turned towards him as if to argue but John looked back at him hard, resolute.
John shook below him with laughter.
Mycroft went very still for a second, staring at him intently before reaching into his breast pocket. He placed an expensive looking business card on the table. A mobile number written in biro.
‘I suppose you may as well eat.’ Sherlock said tossing his own menu on to the table.
'You know how you asked me to keep an eye out for something?' Raz grimaced at the pun.
##########
'This is where John lives?' He said, mouth dry.
John took his time, coaxing pleasure from him, encouraging his grip in greying hair. He could hardly believe this soft affectionate thing was the same act he'd associated with dark corners in dubious clubs and a mind fizzing with coke. More than that John was enjoying it too.
‘You'll do anything to stop being bored. You're not bored now, are you?’ The cabbie grinned as he lifted the capsule to his mouth. Sherlock somehow saw the blood bloom across the cabbie’s chest before he heard the shot.
‘You were going to take that damned pill, weren’t you?’ John stroked his wrists.
‘We’ve found Rachel.’
'You know what he's like. Racing about, no food no sleep. Violin at all hours. I'm going to take his pyjamas and things in at visiting. Better look lively, I'll need to get a cab in half an hour. You'll come won't you?' She said, making for the bathroom.
The alpha’s newly minted promotion to DI gives him an air of superiority though he doesn't want to rock the boat, not with a prestigious city firm. Dimmock is not going to be the one to question the ‘obvious’ suicide. He’ll leave that to the pathologist, ballistics. Even when Sherlock shows him the suspicious space in Van Coon’s still packed case and the perfect origami lotus that has been stuffed down his throat.
‘He's a single man who lives out of his microwave. He doesn't do a
She'd been emailing contacts and seemed confident of getting at least a bit of freelance work before long. They'd spent the rest of their time together leisurely, watching old films and going for long walks. Clara even came to visit, John making himself scarce for a few hours. Love, he knew, had never been the issue.
He went to the door, unsteadily leaning on the frame as he opened it. The sight of the alpha, bearing a weathered khaki rucksack and a Tesco bag, took him aback.
##########
'Well, I think after that it's fair to suggest that your hormones are going back to normal, don't you?' John said smirking. 'Anyway, you never did tell me. What got you so excited in that alley the other day?'
... He reached behind him to where copies of the silent auction list were scattered on a table.
'Probably halfway back to China by now.' John said, resigned, as they climbed the stairs to Baker Street. They'd found a relevant paint tin backstage at the theatre and called Dimmock after a very brief scuffle.
He'd known about her and Anderson for months and now was as good a time as any to use it to his advantage. To try and deflect the attention from him, from John, who he felt inexplicably protective of.
'I don't understand.' John set the picture down and stepped towards him.
'Has he helped then? This detective?'
'Thanks – Bye.'
‘No they don't.’ Sherlock took a sip of his wine and silently regarded John for a moment. Shamelessly checking him out, which John was fine with, but also something deeper. He got the sense Sherlock just
He found himself pouring a scotch, opening up the beautiful brochure again, running his eye down the price list. The language used to describe the services offered elegant but unambiguous. He found himself writing an email.
'No, you're clean. In the military sexual health checks were routine. Like the tidiness and the fitness its a habit you've kept on, especially given your more recent experiences.'
‘Brian Lukis, freelance journalist. Murdered at home doors locked from the inside. Sounds similar.’ John agreed.
He sent the alpha the other instructions for his heat in a series of texts. The explanation of the data he collected and his insistence that this was a one time only
‘So, when-when you say you’re concerned about him, you actually are concerned? John paused behind him but he kept going, slowly.
‘You're too soon.’ He hissed, arms wrapped round himself as his insides twisted.
'You have me Mr Holmes, this is mostly for show.' Shan handed the gun to Zhu Zhi. 'This on the other hand.' She pulled the cover off the ornate crossbow setup from the circus, it pointed at John and Mycroft. 'Will i choose a volunteer Mr Holmes?'
'They know what Sherlock does yes. They don't like it though. They accept it because they know the alternative involves police cells and rehab or worse. They have held onto the romantic notion that one day Sherlock would accept his biology, bond and put all that nonsense behind him. Then you come along.' Mycroft smiles at him, it's a little unsettling. John supposes it's meant to be.
John thought of the omega Sherlock had mentioned last night. 'No.' He said a little too brusquely. 'I mean Mrs Hudson is going to be around and Greg Lestrade will look in. If you try and smother him it'll only make him more likely to do something stupid.'
He'd called Lestrade as soon as he'd collected himself. Police and paramedics were now working the scene. The body bag being carried out on a stretcher as more forensics staff suited up to go into the building.
He'd been covered over with a blanket while he slept and was glad of it. He felt painfully aroused, slick between his thighs. He was also embarrassed, not at his condition so much, that was after all why the alpha was there. It was more that he'd fallen asleep, he would have doubted it was even physically possible, before the first knotting.
'Can I see him?' Sherlock said hopefully.
Sherlock had taken on a still look. Delicately lifting the invoice and scanning it.
‘My phone?’
His CO has agreed you can use one of the spare barracks out the far end of the camp. You'd have everything, bathroom, running water, guard - beta obviously.’
Realisation crawled over John's skin. ‘Should I call Sally?’
The music and lighting changed for the next act. A spotlight following an acrobat high above the stage on a sort of trapeze. A small, strong acrobat.
'That was peculiar, I had no idea Victor was even in the country.'
A lot of dialogue from ASIP had been cut for this, or swapped round. Let me know if it doesn't make sense.
. John suppressed a smile.
'Fine. Say eight, that should give us a chance to get the preliminary results from the lab.' The detective climbed back into the waiting car.
'Why did they have to die then? I mean they're an asset, why kill them?' John said finally, finishing his own food.
' Not now, though you should know I had a ...moment of weakness.' John shifted round to face him.
‘Dull.’ He said as he opened the front door and maneuvered John inside, locking up behind them.
'Have you ever had anyone? A special alpha?' Sherlock's voice dripped sarcasm (among other more appealing things) but defensive sarcasm so John let it go.
'I don't know who you two are but I'm sure your police friend will tell you that you need a warrant to look in there.' She remained unflappable.
, his parents. She was realising just how common he actually was. He'd got so far on being Dr/Captain Watson but now he'd explained his background. Well, breeding will out, that was the expression.
' If it's to be convincing you both need to be wearing as few clothes as possible. Use my room .' He sat back, opening a book at random in a futile attempt to look indifferent. The next five minutes were excruciating as the scenting silently took place out of his sight. When they emerged , looking flustered, he crossed the room to sniff the omega. Trying not to flinch at the strength of Lestrade's scent on him.
'You can't see it now but you get a little bit of a river view during the day and lots of light.'Joe had wandered to the window.
' She'll be gone all day.' Hot breath at his ear was soon joined by hands on his hips. He was breathing in pure aroused alpha, oxygen suddenly seemed overrated.
‘No send him up. Thank you.’ Sherlock felt he could perhaps do with the palate cleanser, so to speak, of an easy case he could deal with from the flat.
The tension just evaporated, it was extraordinary, the chemistry of it. He felt suddenly clear. His need for John, for John to be his mate, the only thing in his mind. As John sensed him calm he rolled away onto his belly. 'This- that is to say arse in the air- is probably the best position for...'John made a gesture with his hand, avoiding Sherlock's eye. He realised then that though John was not the blushing virgin he'd been a few weeks ago this was new for him too, a bite a bond.

It didn't take much deduction to know there was something she was holding back. Something that was
The detective blushed gloriously, as he turned back towards John and handed him a spare napkin to clean up. He frowned as he wiped at a spot on John's thigh.

‘I suppose I’d just assumed…I mean I’m not sure why…’ Sherlock avoided his eye though his hand kept up the delicious friction.
'Oh no, you stay there.' John said, hurriedly taking off his suit jacket and throwing it in the general direction of his own chair as he crossed the room.
'The bath doesn’t come into it. He wanted this view.' Sherlock stared out across to a car dealership. Vintage cars arranged on a square of pink gravel. A chalet style sales office in the middle. The whole thing surrounded by a high fence, several cctv cameras looked on.
He gestured for the detective and they moved the bed as quietly as possible. Easing away the thin layer of plywood clipped to the back of the headboard. It revealed several ledger type books neatly fastened to the inside.
'Harry, we're talking about you because- well you know why.'
He wondered if she had read Dr Watson and assumed he was well off, senior partner in some prosperous practice. Either way it was a fantasy. Even if he did have the balls to do it, go to a brothel and get himself a proper seeing to he couldn’t afford it. So he got on with things.
‘If you decide to go ahead with me we'll go carefully OK? I'll explain things, go at a speed that suits you. You control this. What's your first name by the way?’ John was fighting the urge to move closer.
Another chapter so as not to leave them hanging. This is I suspect on the fluffy side for something tagged prostitute Sherlock but that’s the way it goes sometimes.
. Afghanistan or Iraq by the way?’
He hurried out the flat door to meet them. His sister looked amused.
'Not exactly he, that is to say his minion, told me you needed my help urgently. It was implied it was life and death -the usual. I was kind of relieved they got in touch to be honest. I'm sorry . I shouldn't have left you there, like that. Especially when I knew those bastards were still nearby.' John sighed and looked at his feet. 'I really hope this isn't your idea of a date-this is -
“You don’t scare me Sebastian Wilkes.” Clementine said evenly.
John turned, cocking his head to the side, brow furrowed, lips pressed tightly together.
“Get out! Get out!” She was grabbing at him now, trying to drag him from under her bed.
“It was fine,” he relented after a while. “Dinner was lovely. She was perfectly pleasant.”
I watched TAB on Netflix the other night and got inspired to write Mycroft feels. I wanted to see him at a time when his affections for Sherlock were more unguarded, the moments that led him to conclude caring wasn't an advantage.
He paid the driver and climbed out with Clem. He didn’t want to go in. He didn’t know what he would see, what Clementine would see.
John growled in approval and picked up the pace of his thrusts. Clem was lost in the pleasure as he hit deeper and deeper inside her.
John turned away from him and shoved his hands in his pockets, trying to seem unaffected by their conversation. He looked back out at Sally and Clementine just in time to see the flat of Clem’s hand make solid contact with the side of Sally’s face.
“It’s about damn time too. Now Mycroft can stop driving us around.” Clementine giggled through a mouthful of crumbs.
through the social and pecuniary influence of his father that he was admitted. I did conceded to him that he was probably in fact the most intelligent amongst the band of perfumed miscreants he was currently in the company of, but that hardly warranted bragging rights.”
Clementine straightened herself, flinging her bag back to its traditional place on her back.
“If you don’t rub her clit she isn’t going to cum.”
“How’d you get to be so smart young lady?” The older man chuckled deeply.
That would be the greater pain. He would rather make them angry with him than cause them the pain that comes with losing a loved one.
She lay sprawled out on the duvet, shirtless trousers undone. He grabbed her jeans and yanked them down her legs, tossing them to the other side of the room. He looked down at her now, flushed and panting, naked but for her matching bra and knickers. John could feel his prick get harder. He moaned as he palmed his erection.
As if he hadn’t heard him, the larger man reared his fist back and struck Sherlock in the jaw. Instantly he crumpled to the floor, completely unconscious. Then suddenly Mrs. Powers was on him, pulling him away from the teen.
John gently eased Clementine down on to the bed. Her body had gone limp and pliant. John’s body was in a similar state. He lay next to her for a moment, gathering his strength. He peeked over her body at the man splayed out in the chair. Sherlock was limp and panting, trousers still undone and cock laying flaccid in his lap. He held a hand aloft cupping his release. John scanned the floor quickly for a towel of some sorts. Finding none he resolved to fix the issue in another manner entirely.
“Mummy! Mummy!” She cried out.
Clementine dropped to the floor, covering her ears. Sherlock heard a scream, a crash, a cry of pain.
Clementine didn’t say anything. She just dropped her bag, scooped the folded blanket, wrapped it around her body and sank onto the couch. She didn’t move or say anything for three days.
“In addition to being a prat Sherlock is also quite a genius.” Clementine continued. John had now braced Sherlock against him, bare back to bare chest. He was planting sweet sucking kisses to his shoulder blade as he took in the story.
John’s mind stumbled. Unable to think of anything else to say, he gave the truth.
Sherlock shot Clementine sharp glance. She returned his gaze exhausted, but resolute.
So he hadn’t answered.
“I’m an addict, John. I’ve been an addict since before we ever met.”
“An assignment,” was all he said before grabbing his umbrella and jacket and heading for the door. Before exiting he paused briefly and turned his head.
I think I may just go insane before my tour is up. The nurse that works on my shift at the base hospital is completely bonkers and it is driving me up the wall. He is absolutely obsessed with pottery. He goes on and on about materials, design, history, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I didn’t even know you could say that much about pottery and there isn’t even any pottery in the room! Sometimes, he gets so overcome talking about it that he starts to weep. I sear. No joke. I think his knowledge of pottery may even rival your knowledge of chemistry. Though that is not really a fair comparison.
Sherlock had taken many a nap on that couch, an old fake-leather piece that sat in a small room reserved for graduate chemistry students. Her skirt was hiked around her waist, legs spread wide, her dripping pussy exposed to the air of the room and Sherlock’s hungry gaze.
“Your cunt is gorgeous. I want to see Sherlock burry his face in it and not come up until he is as dripping wet at you.”
“Who said that?” She called out spinning on her feet, looking around the room, seeing no one.
John nodded his agreement.
He thought to himself.
“She was on the floor. He had her by the hair and she was crying. Her face was red and her nose was bleeding.”
“Yes mother,” John snickered at her as he extricated himself from the couch, Sherlock gingerly shifting himself.
With those words John’s eyes shot back open. He looked over at Sherlock, whose expression had gone a bit sheepish. Well that was new information that John fully intended to exploit. Suddenly he flipped Clem onto her back. Lifting her legs to his shoulders he continued fucking her with barely a pause.
“Clementine slapped Sally across the face. That’s what made Anderson grab her.”
“Please.” His voice was nearly a whisper, a desperate plea for her to do the right thing, to spare herself the pain.
He felt her body jerk against him with a sob.
She sipped it, letting the comforting aroma fill her senses. She hadn’t truly smelled anything in about a week. Then she began crying.
The weight of what he was doing, what he had just done, hit Sherlock like a ton of bricks.
The man stalked toward him slowly, puffing on his pipe, wisps of smoke curling around his slick black hair.
It worked pretty well. Thursday and Sunday were the only days that John didn’t have his clerkship. He still had class on Thursday, but would spend all day Sunday at Baker Street.
Sherlock launched himself off the couch.
“Don’t fucking lie to me you whore!” Came the angry response.
Suddenly the heavenly rhythmic suction returned and John’s eyes glazed over with lust once again.
“Sherlock?” She asked tentatively. He didn’t respond, but Clem saw as tears began spilling from his eyes. She was on him in a second, scooping him into her arms. He clung to her as a drowning man clings to a life raft.
“But it was hard. I still had friends on the street and neither Mycroft nor Clem understood. Clem had been through her own personal hell that I couldn’t relate to and I went through things she never understood. By the time you met us we had settled into our lives together. I remember the first night she brought you home.”
“Don’t. Just don’t! Not now! Not after—” John choked on the volume of his voice, unable to finish his thought. He bowed his head, collecting himself.
“Yes. YES!” She was gasping.
Quicker than John’s eyes could take in the spectacle and his brain could process the information Sherlock landed a solid cross the other man’s jaw, while blocking a sloppy jab. An elbow to the face was next followed by a low block to the right and a high block to the left. An uppercut to the solar plexus and a hook to the jaw had The Brick stumbling backward. Sherlock moved swiftly forward executing a jab to the ribs and a cross to the other side of the jaw before mooring a solid kick to the man’s diaphragm.
Clementine moaned with the sheer pleasure of it all.
When he reached the warehouse door, the burly man standing in front gave him a stiff nod and moved aside. This was not John’s first fight and doctors were always appreciated at these events.
“You’ve got me so hard right now.” The deep voice penetrated John.
John just grinned at him.
“I think someone here is a bit jealous of me right now.” John said circling his hips against her wet cunt. Clem threw her head back, hair cascading around her shoulders, and looked over to Sherlock. She gave John a wicked grin before undulating on top of him. He could feel the slick slide of her up and down his cock. John closed his eyes and lost himself in the sensation.
“That is, of course, if it is alright by you Mr. Powers.”
“Slowly slide you cock in and out.”
The fact that Sherlock and Clementine knew where his surgery was and what his working hours were had nothing to do with the decision, he told himself.
At that Sherlock turned his gaze to John.
Tonight, however, John had a date.
Not another word was spoken. The trio relaxed into the warmth of their mingled bodies and fell fast asleep.
He took the last few seconds he had to straighten his hair and jacket and lick his lips, trying to keep his breath steady.
John ran his hands lightly down his lover’s flank. They had managed to find all of their clothes in the dark, but decided to lay in their pants. Sherlock said it would maximize body heat transfer, but John had his doubts. Still, he wasn’t going to complain.
He thought.
Quickly Sherlock grabbed his phone and shot off a text, as John began pecking kissed to his collar bone.
John’s mouth was hanging open as he panted against the duvet.
John didn’t know what to say. All these years all he had wanted to do was talk to Sherlock. Hear his voice. Hear him say wonderful, comforting things. He would have given anything to hear Sherlock come close to saying the beautiful things he is saying now. But all he could think to say was:
“Will do sir!”
“Uh, hi.” He said, waving awkwardly, before remembering himself and his state of half dress. He scrambled to find his shirt on the floor, but Clementine had already risen from the couch and gathered their garments. She hooked her arm into his and led him toward Sherlock.
John finished his mouthful and put down his utensils.
“221B Baker Street and hurry.”
Sherlock looked down at his friend, rocking gently on the floor at his feet. He knew he had to do something. In an instant he was out the door and down the stairs.
“You feel so good John.” Sherlock, was frantic, chasing his own release. John wanted to feel him come apart. Wanted Sherlock to fill him up.
“Pppfffft.” Harry spit out a huff in his general direction. His teeth gritted as he wiped spittle and beer from his face.
“Pish posh!” Admonished his editor, Sarah. “You look smashing. Besides, the event is white tie.”
“Sherlock. Sherlock. I—I—” John was lost in the pure pleasure that washed over his body.
Anderson went pale and began sputtering, “That…that’s not true. You’re just making things up!”
With this last sentence John’s head whipped around to look Sherlock right in the eye. His gorgeous blue eyes shown with honesty and a tint of apprehension.
How dare he? How dare this little shite who knowns
The story his lovers initially told him about their past had been a partial truth. He knew that now. After that night of sorrowful remembrance between the two, Clementine had opened up about the childhood she shared with Sherlock. But she was careful to keep it lighthearted. John heard no more about her father.
'I've gotten myself mixed up in some undercover work. You heard of Jim Graeme?'
'Sort of, it's not so much her I miss it's the bond. That connection to someone. The feeling you're going home at night to another part of yourself. Sorry that's romantic shit.' Lestrade waved his hand dismissively.
'Think so.' Greg replied.
John ran a hand over and peeled away what appeared to be a large sticking plaster.
‘Not long, a few weeks really. We were flat mates before.’ John swirled his glass not wanting to appear rude but not sure how much Sherlock would be comfortable sharing.
Sherlock found himself smiling. 'You came up here for...to...'He stumbled over the words.
'Not what you think, I thought about starting suppressant again, I had the dose drawn but...'
‘The next time, that's already planned isn't it? I mean it must be by now.’
had them,” came Mycroft’s voice from behind him. John spun around, startled to see Mycroft sitting at the kitchen table. John looked back to Sherlock, who still sitting on the couch, speechless.
“My brother?”
John stared up at Sherlock, his expression unreadable. Slowly he placed a hand over one of the hands still gently resting on his face. He gave Sherlock a soft smile.
John did it again, gathering even more of himself and pushing it into Sherlock. He quickly swiped at the drips that began pouring from Sherlock’s hole, thrusting it back inside.
“Fine.” He spat. “But if you see him you tell him we’re looking for him. He can’t hide forever.”
His stiff prick bobbed from a thick nest of dark hair. John’s mouth began to water. Slowly he leaned down and ran his tongue around the head of Sherlock’s throbbing erection. Sherlock moaned deep in his throat.
“Oh I doubt that,” John said with a small chuckle.
He reached over grabbing a small foil packet, tearing it open and sliding the rubber sheath down his aching cock. Positioning himself behind her he lined himself up with her slick opening, pushing just the tip of the head in. He then leaned in to her and with a gruff voice said,
“You think she gets wet when you fuck her deep?” This was the lowest John had heard Sherlock’s voice go and he felt his prick thickening in his hand at the sound. “You haven’t even begun to see her wet.” Sherlock gave a lascivious grin before siting up straight on his knees, leaving Clem’s ankles resting on his shoulders. Emboldened by the thought of showing John just how good he could be, Sherlock continued.
The pair of teens cringed at the reminder.
“We met when we were kids.” John continued unbuttoning his shirt.
“Well yeah, I was hoping you would go deeper.”
Then it hit him. They were in their dirty kitchen, John pressed up against the counter, Sherlock on his knees. His back hurt, pressed against the hard laminate. Sherlock’s knees had to be killing him. This is never how he imagined this. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.
“You did, when you spoke to Doctor Stapelton. That man cannot stand to speak about anything but medicine. The fact that you were able to actively engage him in what appeared to be amicable conversation for an extended period of time suggests medical training. Filed surgeon, most likely.”
“Okay,” Clementine said then turned to Sherlock.
The entire time he was doing this he had set up a steady rhythm of humping her ass. Grinding his hard, trouser-covered cock against her cleft.
It’s over.
You’re probably still angry with me. Probably never want to hear from me again. I just wanted to write this letter and say how sorry I am for everything. You were right. It was all my fault. I was afraid and I ran. I was hurt and I came crawling back. I only ever thought of myself first and for that you and Clementine suffered. I can never forgive myself. Please believe me when I say that I loved her and I miss her every single day. I know what her and I had is nothing compared to the lifetime you two shared. I know that. But I did truly love her.
And with that the three of them left the room.
“He’s a friend.”
John heard these words and lifted his head. Pausing to drip lube on his fingers, John draped his body over Sherlock’s so that he could once again whisper in his ear.
Sherlock had always preferred having John, his conductor of light, along with him on cases since their very first case together. But, he was also used to going it alone when he had to. John, of course had his own job to attend to.
He hopped into the first cab he could find and a short while later was standing outside the door marked 221b. He grabbed the knocker and clanged it a few times. To his surprise an elderly woman answered the door.
John looked to Clementine who shot a look down to Sherlock and back to John. A lascivious smile crossed her face as she slowly took Sherlock’s tea cup off the table. John looked back at her, seeming to catch her implication. He rose from his chair as Clementine stepped back from Sherlock and returned to her space at the counter.
Then Sherlock felt it. John was coming. He gripped onto Clementine hard, riding out the waves of his orgasm.
They definitely didn’t talk about the snogging. Sherlock was too embarrassed to admit how much he enjoyed it. He fancied himself above such unnecessary desires. It was all just transport anyway. He could justify the touches, the brief kisses. Goodnight. Hello. Excuse me. Thank you. These were simply a form of communication with John. Plus, John had always wanted him to be nicer, more polite. He figured after all he put John through, with the fall, the disappearing for two years and then showing up unannounced and very much alive, he owed it to him. Through it all John has stuck by him, always believed in him.
“I know you’re in here.”
“I love you Sherlock Holmes. I have loved you for years and I will love you for the rest of my life. I know that now. I’m not asking you for anything. You don’t have to say it back. You don’t owe me anything. After all these years I just want to be honest with you.”
“I thought about what you said to me—at the hospital—about not caring and only wanting me for a shag.”
John, nor any other male reporter for that matter, wrote for the society pages. He was used to the crime beat, the dregs of society, and the ills of the poor. He felt at home amongst them. Their stories, their plight, were more important than the latest debutant ball or insipid socialite party, according to John.
As Sherlock’s sweet plush lips connected with John’s, the blond man gave a small whimper and grabbed Sherlock’s hip to thrust their cocks together. The two stood in the entry way between the living room and kitchen wrapped in each other. Hands started pushing jackets off shoulders. Lips were sucked into hot hungry mouths. The grind of their pelvises desperate with desire.
“I look like a penguin.”
“I don’t have time for fairytales.” Sherlock said stiffly before crossing his arms and leaning against the front counter where they waited for the hostesses return.
, John thought to himself.
John learned pretty quickly how much Sherlock enjoyed a finger or two in the bum while being sucked. Sherlock loved the feeling of being stretched, loved the brush of John’s fingers against his prostate. When he came with John deep inside him, swallowing him down to the root, it was transcendent. His mind shut off and all he could feel was pleasure and relief and John.
Sherlock gripped John’s hand and pulled it from his mouth to hurriedly speak.
As their breath quickened and bodies fell into a rhythm, John felt large strong hands slide onto his hips.
“Hello Doctor Watson.”
Without saying a word Clementine sprang to her knees, crossed to the end of the bed where he stood, grabbed John by the hips and pulled him closer. Deftly she pulled his pants down pushing them to his ankles. Before John realized what was going on his prick was enveloped in the wet heat of her mouth.
Sherlock jumped back, as if cut by a sharp blade. Clementine sat on the bed, arms around her knees, trying to make herself as small as possible. Slowly Sherlock approached her, reaching his hand out.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open at the sound that ripped from her mouth. The dual stimulus of John’s fingers and the image of Clementine, writhing on her own fingers while she pulled and twisted her dusky-pink nipples had Sherlock’s cock leaking.
Clementine’s heart ached at the sight and sound of her brother in so much pain. He was hunched over in the chair, as if he were mere moments from falling out of it. She leapt from the couch and knelt before him, wrapping her arms around him. He returned the embrace and she could feel his body shaking with sorrow.
“It isn’t her fault that she doesn’t have friends and family who are rich enough and care enough to come find her.”
“Yes. Yes. I forgive you. Always, John. Always.”
“SAY IT!!”
Still not shifting his gaze Sherlock replied, “Girlfriend? No. That’s not really my area.”
“I find it funny you are so worried about who Clem is sleeping with instead of who your boyfriend is sleeping with,” came a low growling voice behind John. Sherlock was there now, standing next to Clementine, takeout bags in hand.
? How dare he make such accusations and then expect Clementine to
John let out a groan at the filthy proposition and resumed fucking Sherlock with interest. It didn’t take long, John was so close. When he felt just about to topple over the edge John pulled out, tore off the condom and stroked himself to completion. Hot ribbons of cum fell onto Sherlock’s back. John could hear the man moaning beneath him as every new spurt landed on his back.
Sherlock looked up from his microscope. His face gave nothing away. He stood slowly, eyes fixed on John as he walked toward him.
Sherlock spun around in his chair and regarded John thoughtfully, almost scrutinizing him.
It had been a week since his erotic encounter with Clementine and her roommate. They had exchanged numbers, but John hadn’t heard a peep from her and he didn’t quite know what he’d say if he had.
Please write back.
As Sherlock approached the bed he loomed over Clem. She looked up into his eyes, they were glazed over with lust and anticipation. He gently reached out to cup her jaw and trace her bottom lip with his thumb. She reveled in the touch. Slowly she moved back onto the bed as Sherlock climbed over her. He hesitated briefly before placing a chased kiss to her lips.
It would only be a few days later, as John let the blissful steam of a hot shower clear the last chemical vestiges of heat from his brain that he would remember. Sherlock. The alpha' s slim body trapped between John and the wall of the deserted lobby in Billy Scott's building. John couldn't remember how they'd got there or what he said, typical heat stuff probably, telling Sherlock how wet he was, begging to be knotted- now. He did remember the look of utter panic on Sherlock's face before he firmly took John's arm and led him to the other alpha' s door.
‘Yes, the trousers were bought for an undercover thing I did a couple of years ago, ballroom dancers moonlighting as heroin dealers. The shirt was…a sort of joke Christmas present from my brother. I was obsessed with pirates as a child.’
############
‘You're being nice.’ He hissed into Sherlock’s ear as the alpha filled the kettle.
The alpha sounded incredulous but he complied. Sherlock had planned to send the text himself really but for some reason he took the opportunity to test John Watson. The doctor, with a little grumbling, typed exactly as Sherlock dictated.
Hotels that were happy to cater for a heat. Usually levying a small extra charge for laundry and an exclusively beta staff. Websites that catered, safely, for casual arrangements, while discouraging those who were really looking for a bond.
‘Succinct.’Sherlock said with a satisfied smile. His face smeared with the eyeliner John was probably now wearing too. Now I know why I let you write the blog.
John wouldn't have it any other way.
When they arrived at Molly's John looked pointedly at the detective. They had agreed that he was to have a few minutes alone with her and 'say something nice'.
. She'd been translating. While he'd been getting shot at, the book had been on her desk. His phone rang rudely.
The alpha grabbed John. 'Oh now i know where the smell was coming from.' He licked a stripe up John's neck. Sherlock felt rage explode uncontrolled behind his eyes and lunged towards them. On some level he knew it was stupid. There was the other alpha behind him and the gun on the floor, both of which would have been better possibilities for action. He was pulled back by an arm at his throat.
‘As a doctor you should know that knotting too early is..’ The alpha cut him off, looking horrified.
'Helmand – I was a surgeon-once. After this though I ended up with a tremor.' He patted his shoulder and shrugged. 'Of course civilan life has it's compensations.' They both looked at Sherlock for a moment. ' He might still be interested in the car by the way, comes from money.'
Was the only, slightly sarcastic, reply he got.
John tried not to imagine Sherlock scenting him, the intimacy of skin on skin, of being claimed. He attempted to think of it in medical terms. The instinctive response to invasion of perceived territory by another alpha. It didn't mean anything real.
turned to look at him as he flopped onto his back, sneaking a glance at his softening cock.
'I think Moriarty.' It was the first time Sherlock had voiced this aloud. 'I think its one individual. They had a hand in the taxi driver business, I think in the jade pin business too. There are hints around other cases.'
'From Graeme's places?'
'He worked on supplying equipment to groups who, in the strictest official sense, shouldn't have it. This will surprise Dr Watson I think not at all.'
Thanks to everyone who's read, kudosed, bookmarked and especially commented on this. Apologies (as ever) for the delay.
'Where's Molly?' He said hoarsely.
‘Is she alone, that's what we really need to know.’ The firearms officer broke in, impatient.
'No, post it. Its fine its... if it helps you. You have rather, well, glossed over , how we met.' Sherlock handed him back the phone.
'Not the same, no time in a heat for anything so relaxed, it gets a bit -frantic.' John saw what he recognised as curiosity flit across the alpha' s face.
'That's how families are meant to be. Consider yourself lucky, I've done my fair share of weddings and funerals with Harry.' John was sliding out of his jacket, he remembered the card from Joe.
‘Yes now.’ John put on his look that entertained no argument and gestured to the kitchen at the end of the room. Sherlock followed reluctantly.
As he ate a surprisingly substantial room service breakfast three days later he found the rooms of his mind palace bathed in light. Details of the unsolved cases Lestrade had given him coming into sudden sharp focus.
had entered the room. Clementine, who was completely preoccupied and had her back to the door, seemed not to have noticed as she continued sucking his cock enthusiastically.
This time, however, he was trying to reassure the girl. He thought that showing her she didn’t need to keep the secret from him, for he already knew it, would have stopped her from so vehemently denying him access to the spot. The look on her face seemed to say otherwise. So, as convention told him was wise, he added a final appeal.
“Mummy says that it is time to go.” Clementine could feel the look of horror cross her face. He couldn’t leave. Not now. She wasn’t safe.
With love,
He began yelling at her. Telling her how cruel she was and how if she didn’t want to be his friend she should just stop pretending. Stop making him come over here just to be rejected.
“Do you want him?” She whispered in John’s ear.
“I’d love you even more than I do now if you made coffee,” Sherlock prodded.
There Sherlock stood by the window seemingly unaffected by the proceedings.
“What are you doing here you complete numpty!?” She chided him. Sherlock just cried and cried. They sat there for a several moments.
John leaned over Sherlock, pushing his fingers deeper into him. Sherlock’s eyes fell closed in pleasure, as John began to focus on the image on the small screen.
“Where is her locket?”
“Why couldn’t you have just stayed away?! I was going into the lab that night you showed up. If you hadn’t nocked on my door like a horny kicked puppy she would still be alive! I would have been there and I could have saved her!”
John jogged up behind them and grabbed Harry’s other arm, hoisting it over his shoulder.
“It’s psychosomatic.”
“By speaking.” Sherlock said plainly.
“Touch yourself,” he would command. Sherlock would run his fingers gently across his chest, grazing his nipples. He would rub across his lips, down his stomach, through his hair. John would groan above him, rubbing the bulge through his uniform. Eventually, Sherlock would take his throbbing cock in hand and begin to stroke.
“Cuba or the Philippines?”
“Look at you naughty boys,” she sighed, gently rubbing herself. “Is this what you two get up to when I’m not around?”
He dripped a few more drops of lube onto the head of his cock. They had taken to hiding bottles of lube around the flat so they would always be prepared.
Tears began flowing, his steel-like visage crumbling before her eyes. She had never seen the man express an emotion on anything other than a completely neutral level. He was the epitome of British grace. The scene was hard to watch.
Mycroft didn’t speak right away. He weighed his response, contemplating what he had to say and what it was Sherlock even wanted to hear.
“Um,” he began slowly, his throat catching, “My mother died shortly after I left for Afghanistan. Cancer.”
On her forearm was a splash of shocking white skin, as if a small child had spilled paint or glue on her. Angry redness and an intricate series of large blisters cascaded from this center point, an explosion of pain and damage.
At first, as a young child, he didn’t understand. He thought he had done something to make her mad. That she didn’t like him anymore. So he would sit quietly in her room and read, while she lay curled on her bed unmoving and quiet.
“Who are you and what have you done with my best friend?”
“I don’t know for sure he is with Seb, but I know that he buys from him.” The men had finally let the boy go, but still stood close, flanking him. “Listen,” Vic continued, running his hands through his hair. “I like Sherlock, yeah. I just, I can’t have him around my place with those kind of drugs.”
“That was when he decided to resort to physical violence.”
When he reached the edge and looked over he saw a body, twisted, bleeding on the ground below.
“Neither have I.” Sherlock supplied.
(See the end of the chapter for
Clementine poured hot water into waiting mugs and handed one to each man, giving them a quick kisses. John took his tea and sat at the table watching a well-practiced morning routine.
“I’m sucking your cock. Or hadn’t you noticed?”
Nothing's changing anyway
“Why don’t you care,” Sherlock asks, genuinely confused.
The event tonight was a fundraiser for these almshouses. Sarah thought that, since John was particularly acquainted with the cause at hand, he would be the perfect candidate to engage the hostess and benefactors of the night. At least that was how she pitched the idea to John.
They smiled at each other across the length of the couch. For a moment they returned to drinking in silence before Clem spoke once again.
“God! Oh GOD!” She whined.
“Shut the fuck up. Who. The. Fuck. Is. Rizz?”
Clementine closed the door behind them as John took in his new surroundings. The room was sparsely furnished with just a neatly made bed, nightstand, chest of drawers, and an armchair. A framed periodic table of the elements was the only decoration on the walls.
“Because the last I checked when you really cared about someone you avoided permanent absenteeism or at the very least at least provided some kind of an explanation—”
John searches for Sherlock after the fight.
John stood up and began kissing at Sherlock’s neck.
John rose from the bed as Sherlock still stood there stammering. In two swift strides he was in front of the taller man, cupping his face. John pulled him down and pressed their lips softly together. Sweetly sucking that gorgeous bottom lip between his, John tasted the other man. Tea and salt and something otherworldly filled his senses. As John pulled away Sherlock found his words.
He swore Sherlock almost looked disappointed.
"Awesome," John said, and that was it.
“What—oh, you’re
“Remind me again why we need these idiotic things?” Sherlock said, dismissing John’s greeting like a pesky insect.
Sherlock gave John a strange look. "Sure," he said.
John snapped his mouth shut. “Yeah. Right. Sorry, I, um. Carry on.”
“I,” John said, and sputtered. “With your—
“Hey, Sherlock?” John said, a long, long while later.
She grew heavier with every day, just an imperceptible bit bigger, ears beginning to fit proportionally with the rest of her body. Her eyes kept that watery, dinner-plate look, but it was only pulled in moments of desperation, when John was cooking and the smell of salmon drifted enticingly through the kitchen. Other times, they were calculating, whip-sharp, trained on a spider or a bloom of dust or a stray, rolling bullet behind the couch from the last time Sherlock cleaned the guns. John nearly had an aneurysm when he entered the living room to see her on her back, happy as a lamb, tossing and pouncing at the piece of metal like a squeaky toy rat.
'It only lasted a few weeks. He got transferred into our team just before we went to this awful training thing in Yorkshire, we ended up messing about a bit when we were there. I knew it was a bad idea, someone I was working with but it was a funny time I felt ...reckless, I'd just broken up with a girl and now I was being sent to Afghanistan, you know? Then discovering I was carrying on with a married man just before he goes off to a war zone. Not my finest moment.' John finished staring into the middle distance.
‘Did you buy this wine? It’s my…’ He shut the fridge door and the question died on his lips. His flatmate was standing at the kitchen doorway.
They walked back through the building to a fire exit just outside the studio. Sherlock inspected it closely, it had been jammed slightly open.
' I didn't mean to wake you.' Sherlock said, staring ahead.
He gulped a glass of water, scrubbed the Thames off his skin in a very hot shower and fell asleep on his bed still wrapped in a towel. When he woke up just before six to grey dawn he thought the dampness he felt was the towel wet beneath him. Only when he made to move did the wave of cramp correct him. He became gradually aware of the other symptoms. Sweat fiery then clammy, sensitivity to even the run of the sheet against his skin. He texted the alpha.
Later he would realise there was no sense of an act of force, only surrender, on his part, as he bit. Flooding his mate with semen as he gave in to his own orgasm. As he came back to awareness he tasted salt as well as the ferrous tang of blood and he realised he was weeping.
