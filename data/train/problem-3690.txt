Dean swallows hard. “Yeah?”
“How is the book?” he signs.
Castiel found it interesting that humanity was able to travel through space better than through Earth’s oceans, that more people had been on the moon than had seen the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
“Well, I’m up now.”
The feathers are a deep brown, the color of Cas’ hair at its darkest, with a fine dusting of grey towards the edges like they had been brushed with volcanic ash. The light from the lamp on the table shines through a group of longer ones, making them glow a muddy golden.
You look back, reassuring and penitent.
The drive back to Cas’ apartment is filled with more singing (this time to Dean’s Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), neither of them wanting the vibe from the karaoke place to die just yet. Too soon, however, they reach their destination and Dean parks the Impala. He turns the music off and looks over to Cas.
This particular kiss is deep, slow, filled with a heat it couldn’t have been with other people around to bear witness. It’s like the ones they save for totally private moments, when Jack is away at Sam and Eileen’s, when there are no wayward hunters taking refuge in the bunker with them, snacking on Dean’s baked goods (he was getting really good - they’d even had people stop by just for his cinnamon rolls).
“Okay.”
Dean grabs the baseball mitts and tosses one to her. “Sam? Jack? Cas?”
Jack asks why the sky changes colors like that. Cas gives an incredibly detailed and scientific explanation, discussing the bending of light at different wavelengths through the atmosphere. Dean watches them fondly. He turns an equally fond look to Sam and Eileen, silently signing to each other. She’s sitting in Sam’s lap on the beach chair.
Charlie sits amidst a pile of clothes on Dean’s bed at the Winchesters’ apartment, looking up at a shirtless Dean. “So, you ARE ready, right?” she asks.
“I think so, too. Thanks.”
Now that he knows for sure what he’s suspected is true, Dean’s confidence rises. He gets even closer to Cas. He can hear him breathing, can just barely feel Cas’ breath on his face. He looks down at their hands for a moment, then back up at this idiot angel in front of him. Dean threads his fingers through Cas’. It feels right. He takes his other hand and turns Cas’ face back towards his. Cas looks surprised, almost confused, at the touch.
He falls asleep on your shoulder.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean had barely seen the angel since he died, which he thought was weird. As soon as Dean learned that Cas was in heaven, he’d fully expected a reunion. The first thing Cas had always done when he was revived was come to see Dean, if he could. When Jack saved him, Cas definitely could have come to say “Hello, Dean” once again. He should have. They’d hardly spoken at all, in fact. Whether Cas really was too busy with Jack or was actively avoiding Dean, he hadn’t said more than a “hello” or two. He’d avoided spending too much time with Dean, making up an excuse about an assignment or something when it was obvious Dean was about to bring up the pre-Empty conversation.
As soon as Cas disappears, Dean pulls out his phone.
You think about shrugging to keep him conscious, but you let him rest; it wasn’t a head injury.
Bobby gives him a thumbs up.
Dean parks the car overlooking the North Rim of this heaven’s Grand Canyon. He sits back in the driver’s seat for a moment, sighing. He looks out over the vast expanse of rock and river. He takes a moment to marvel at the deep reds and oranges of the stone, the river glinting in the distance. The scrub brushes and juniper trees on the lip of the canyon sway in a slight breeze. The chill in the air through the Impala’s open windows gives Dean the impression that the person this section of heaven was crafted for had an affinity for spring. Cas had done that crafting, he realizes. It’s awesome, in the old meaning of the word. Awe-inspiring. He’s still looking out when he begins talking.
“Okay.”
“I thought you liked my trench coat.”
“That too?”
“Does part of you hate me for taking this long?”
Cas quirks one eyebrow up in question. “What could we do?”
All at once, that flood starts pouring out of their mouths. They talk over each other frantically, just trying to get it all out. But in saying it out loud, they quickly realize the ideas are still half-baked and the desires should stay left behind. They cut each other off, shoot ideas down, and are just generally unproductive for a long stretch of road.
Dean feels the tension in the car. He figures Cas thinks he’s mad at him. At the moment, he doesn’t care. Maybe he is a little mad that Cas dumped the most beautiful love confession he’d ever heard onto him just to die immediately afterwards. Dean didn’t have the time to think about let alone
Dean sighs, realizing he was actually pretty tired. And Cas looks very inviting. “All right.”
Dean’s ready this time. “Okay.”
“Is that all?” He tried to keep his tone encouraging, but by the closed-off look on Cas’ face, he knows it sounded more like this was an interrogation. He doesn’t want to scare the words out of Cas. He softens his voice, lets the desperation in the questions dissipate, and tries again. “Just to spend time with me?”
“You gonna tell me about it someday?” Dean asks.
Cas understands. How does he understand?
“Plus,” Dean continues, setting the empty mug down on the side table, “I bet your ‘beyond comprehension’ form is hot, too.” He withdraws his feet and puts his hands on either side of Cas’ legs, leaning into him. “You should show it to me sometime.”
“Absolutely,” Jody continues.
He sometimes thought about the more philosophical reasons why they turned their eyes upward rather than down. When he started to spend more time around humans, he started to develop some hypotheses. Maybe humans want to look to the future, and the past is in the ocean. Life started there. Maybe they didn’t want to face Creation, but wanted to Create.
“On Earth, I wanted to…be with you. Spend time with you. I wanted to go wherever you went. I wanted to be there when you- when you died, but now…”
“Dean, I would never suspect you of that.”
Dean was right about no one checking the beach. They aren’t interrupted.
“I want you to kiss me.”
“Only if you want.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck before shrugging. “I dunno.”
“He’d love to,” Charlie says, mouth full of fries, from the other side of Castiel.
Charlie sends a series of heart emojis and Dean sends a few back before he drives home. Sam’s already asleep when he arrives, so Dean gets ready for bed uninterrupted.
“Hey, hey Cas,” Dean says, elbowing his husband. He frowns at Cas’ reflection, squinting as he lowers his voice. “I’m the one who gripped you tight.”
“I think you’re beautiful.”
“I do,” Cas laughs.
“All right, cool. Could you grab the tape labeled ‘Mothership’ outta the glove compartment for me?”
“Are you sure?”
Dean had spent a lot of time replaying what last happened between them in his head. Thinking about the words, about his feelings. He knew what he should have said, what he couldn’t possibly have said in the moment.
You’re both exhausted, but you don’t need sleep like he does.
Cas considers for a moment. “We could drive until we think of something?”
Dean screws his eyes shut, his ears filled with his own wrecked voice shouting his angel’s name. The one Dean gave him.
“Hey, uh, Cas?” Dean says before Cas gets out.
Of course he loved Castiel. Of course. How could he not? All they’d been through, all they’d done for each other. Their stories simply didn’t make sense otherwise.
Dean scoots a bit closer. He doesn’t want to go in too strong, so he moves his hand until his fingers are touching Cas, just barely. Cas doesn’t pull his hand away. The nervousness stays, but Dean sees the fear melt off Cas’ face and he knows the slight gesture worked. Good. He has to reassure Cas that he’s not going anywhere.
It worked out well - Dean realized early on in the process that it was something he wanted, too. Something he’d been denying himself for a long time.
Lips on his.
Cas glances at the tie still in his hand. "I like this."
“Several. Why?”
“I did! But I have to go now. Goodbye.”
Cas was also helping Dean see himself the way Cas saw him, the way all the people who love him saw him. Dean is a good man. He’d done so much for the world, so much for the people he cared about. And he does deserve nice things.
“Can’t we continue later? We have more than two weeks till Halloween.”
“What?”
You rejoice in the warmth radiating from his body, in the softness of the pillows at your back.
“Stop it,” Dean says, still doing his impression.
Dean worries for a split second if anyone saw Cas heal him, but then Cas’ tongue is in his mouth and he can’t think anymore. Dean loses himself to the feeling of Cas against him for a minute, until some kids shouting nearby reminds him they’re surrounded by people. He pulls back and Cas follows the motion, trying to capture his lips again, but Dean stops him.
“I think you’ll like the singer.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, his own voice breaking. He lays back down.
“Tell me again,” Dean says through his own smile. “What do you want, Cas?”
He shouldn’t be. After all Cas has done for the world, for humanity, for
“Dean.” The desperation in Cas’ voice makes Dean hesitate. But he can’t, he can’t let go. He pulls Cas closer, resting his forehead on the back of Cas’ neck.
“Ready to go home? We could continue ‘the gayness’ there,” Cas says, doing air-quotes.
“Why?” he asks, bringing a spoonful to his mouth.
“So, do you wanna come back here with me later tonight? We could watch the stars, just the two of us.”
Cas laughs at him. “Oh, I know.” He rests his elbows on the desk and puts one hand on Dean’s arm. His face is really close to Dean’s. Dean can feel his blush get worse. “I told you the owner would be grateful. I trust you were gentle with her?”
“Yes?”
There is a meteor shower during their six month anniversary, so Dean decides to drive them out to an open plain not too far from home. He puts on his hot dog pajama pants and packs the most comfortable blanket he can find. He goes back to their room to grab his husband.
Cas stares up at the ceiling for a moment, then starts laughing.
When they leave the restaurant, full and happy, Dean pulls Charlie to the back of the group as they walk back to the bar and their cars. He makes sure Cas is far enough ahead of them before talking to her.
“What do
Despite the time Dean gives Cas, he still hears the hesitation in Cas’ voice when he finally speaks.
Even so, you worry he’ll wake up and jerk away from you.
“Maybe if I had a good enough teacher,” Dean waggles his eyebrows at Cas.
“Yes, you know how to turn me on. You don’t have to look so smug about it,” Dean says, slightly embarrassed under Cas’ gaze.
Eventually, Dean couldn’t take it anymore. He figured Cas wouldn’t just fly away in the middle of a ride (although he could if he wanted to), so he planned this trip for the two of them. They needed some time alone to talk, away from everyone else up here. Dean needed answers if he was going to exist peacefully in heaven. He couldn’t fully appreciate all it had to offer with these questions weighing so heavily on his mind.
“You got a favorite fish?” Dean asks Castiel when they reach the kelp forest tank.
alone. You know the deal, Castiel. It’s time. I’ll spit him back out if you come quietly. And I MEAN quietly, you absoLUTely exASperating thing.”
Sam suggests a restaurant close by. Dean doesn’t catch the name because Cas is staring at him again. In the sharper unfiltered light of the backstage area, Castiel’s eyes reflect a lighter shade. An icy blue rather than a stormy one. It makes his already intense gaze even more so. There’s a little more discussion between the others, so the stare lasts a while. Normally this much eye contact would make anyone look away for a moment out of embarrassment or just plain awkwardness, but Dean feels himself holding the stare again.
Dean jumps, dropping his phone. He turns to see Bobby looking thoroughly amused.
Perfect. They have a lot to discuss.
☼ ☼ ☼
“You love me.”
On the morning of their five month wedding anniversary, Dean finds Cas in their living room, watching the television very intently. It seems to be a nature program of some sort, judging by the sweeping helicopter shot of the ocean.
“I’m not a trophy wife. Don’t just stare, help me with these,” Dean orders as he looks over his shoulder at Cas, flicking his eyes toward the pile of dishes next to him. Cas smiles at Dean’s act of being serious.
“That’s not how I sound, Dean.”
Dean whistles. “...yeah all right, that does somethin’ to me.”
“Yeah.”
“Can I ask you something?”
“Don’t thank me. Show me again,” Dean almost whispers, smiling at his angel.
Cas tips the mic towards Dean’s lips, raising his eyebrows to encourage Dean to join him. Dean doesn’t have to focus too hard to sing along, he knows the song perfectly. Anyway, he doesn’t think he’d be able to focus with his lap full of hot dude.
He had thought briefly about what that meant for who he was, how he saw himself. Well, Dean realized that here, none of that really mattered. He had no one to impress, no one to disappoint. Nothing to worry about, truly. One of the perks of this place, he assumed. None of society’s expectations go to heaven.
“We were supposed to go to dinner! Four hours ago! Remember? You guys were gonna let me and Eileen take you out for your anniversary?”
He winks at Dean, then saunters over to the redheaded woman behind the keyboard, swaying to the long instrumental break. Dean is mesmerized, and he’s totally going to blame it on the languid tones of the song and not the way the singer is moving. The guy sways his hips in time with the plunk of the keyboard notes and the soft drum beat. He walks backwards to the mic and Dean takes the opportunity to sneak a peek at his ass. It’s pretty nice. Dean looks back up at the guy’s face just as he swings around to grab the mic and start singing again. Good thing too, because the guy locks eyes with him immediately. It’s so intense that Dean barely notices the guitarist singing backup.
Jack glows with power for just a moment, the air around him crackling like lightning about to strike, then Cas is standing in front of them. His eyes are closed, face scrunched up and hand blocking the sun like he hasn’t seen light in ages. Dean realizes that’s probably the truth, remembering the vast darkness of the Empty. Then Dean remembers what happened in the Empty, and his throat feels like it’s filled with cotton again.
Dean never came out to John, and was glad he hadn’t. The bastard didn’t deserve to really know who he was. That was something he reserved for the people that really loved him, like Sam, Bobby. Like Charlie.
“All set then!” Charlie says. “Anywhere in mind, Sam?”
You want to prove that he’s safe with you, so in defiance you don’t get up.
At that, Cas stops his laughter. He props himself up on one elbow so he can look down at Dean. The morning sun from the window lights up his thoroughly messy hair, making the strands framing his face glow a soft gold. It really does look like a halo. It reminds Dean, simply and fundamentally, that Cas is celestial.
“You’d absolutely slay at the Gala, love,” Cas says, trying out some fashion lingo. He spins his chair around to face Dean. “You’re beautiful.” He grabs the edges of Dean’s button down and pulls Dean closer.
Cas finally meets his eyes, like they’ve done a thousand times. But Dean sees a new expression on Cas’ face, and feels his heart sink. How nervous Cas is definitely takes center stage, but it’s the faint hint of fear that strikes Dean. After all this time, after hearing Dean say he loves him too, Cas was still afraid of…what?
“I know most, yes.”
Dean’s break is almost over when he gets the reply.
Dean blushes at the sincerity in Cas’ voice. “Yeah, me too.”
“Jack. You did this,” Cas says. The pride in his voice makes Jack smile.
“Oh, so you’re bragging now?” Dean chides, muffled by the food in his mouth and the spoon hanging from his lips.
Dean finds a good place away from any city lights to pull over. They walk a little ways out into the field on the side of the road and spread out the blanket. For the first hour or so, they only see a few streaks of light. They talk about nothing to pass the time. Cas props himself up on his right side facing Dean, resting his left hand on Dean’s chest. Dean holds it, watching the sky and making wishes that their happiness lasts (not that he needs to - he knows it will).
Cas does the same. Now Dean laughs.
“You have to.”
“Yeah,” is all he can say back.
Dean leans back into him. He’s so comfortable in Cas’ arms now, like he belongs there. The physical aspect of their relationship was intimidating for Dean at first, but it was something Castiel wanted so he made the effort. The angel deserved to be shown affection in every way possible, deserved to be as happy as he made Dean.
Dean checks his phone every few seconds while he gets ready for work. No response. Still nothing when he checks again after his commute to Bobby’s workshop, but the drive had calmed his nerves. Cas probably sleeps in after gigs just like Charlie, and they had been up fairly late last night. Dean is used to long nights and little sleep, but he knows most people aren’t. He puts his phone on silent in his pocket and gets to work on the cars.
“About what?”
Cas faces him to smooth out the petals. He squeezes Dean’s cheeks. “You look adorable.”
“Damn,” Dean says as he rounds the couch to sit down next to his husband. Cas lifts an arm and Dean tucks himself into the space. Another shark dramatically breaks through the water as the music swells. “I’ve heard of ‘jumping the shark’ but never of sharks jumping.”
to do. He’ll probably have time to think of something before the date though, right?
“It’s fine,” Cas reassures him, thumb smoothing Dean’s jawline. Dean looks away for a moment, and when he looks back Cas places a kiss on his nose, giving him another freckle. Dean turns to lay him down on the bed. Still not fully believing, but knowing he can’t win, he sighs.
Dean absolutely loves it.
“Why don’t you ask Cas?”
“A HUMAN?” Dean hears a voice shout from behind him. It grates against his brain , but he doesn’t let go of Cas to cover his ears for fear they might get separated. He doubles over in pain, pressing his forehead to Cas’ chest, feels Cas’ arms around his back. The voice reminds him of when Cas first tried to talk to him using his true angelic voice, but this is much, much more terrifying. He feels Cas move in between him and the voice, keeping in contact so Dean knows where he is. Cas’ arms are reaching back, bracketing Dean with his hands holding Dean’s sides. Dean holds onto Cas’ shoulders. The voice continues.
“Now we’re here,” Dean finishes for him.
Well, then.
Cas, eyes still closed, out of breath, repeats, “What else?”
“Yeah.”
“Oh my god, Dean. Hold on.”
“Ah, ah. The more advanced beings are talking.”
They hadn’t really had the time to plan it out, what with how flustered Dean had been after the Sisters teased him. And Cas was already in Gabe’s car when they’d caught up to the group at the bar. He figured Cas thought Charlie would give him his number, which he’d totally forgotten to ask for last night. But he has it now, thanks to her sleepy highness. He stares at the phone for a minute before finally texting Cas.
“Goodnight,” Dean whispers back. Cas goes over to kiss Jack on the top of his head before joining Dean under the covers.
Castiel takes the opportunity to let his eyes travel over Dean’s body, admiring the splattering of freckles across his chest. He lingers over Dean’s middle, which has gotten a bit squishy in their time being retired, which Castiel loves. It showed him that Dean was safe and healthy, eating more than he would if he was stressed or on endless hunts. He almost reaches out to poke Dean in the side, but he resists.
“Lovely.”
“Yeah,” Dean says with fondness, running his hand across her dashboard.
“We’ll have the three least-ordered items on the menu, please.”
When they arrive, Dean is pleased to see the place Sam had suggested is a simple diner. Red seating, a red counter, and old movie posters give it the classic ‘50s America feel. They’re seated quickly near the back at a booth. It’s a big one, but there are a lot of them. Dean is about to sit next to Charlie when Castiel takes the spot, forcing Dean to sit next to him instead. He is made aware of how cramped the booth is when he has to press up against Cas so Sam can get in on his other side. Dean is touching Cas from his ankle to his shoulder, and Dean can feel every inch of it. It makes ordering very difficult.
Cas’ eyes go wide at the last sentence, his hand stills, but he’s still avoiding eye contact. That won’t do. Dean stares hard, directly at the side of the angel’s face.
“I’m your Huckleberry.”
Afraid of saying what he truly wants for once in his existence?
“But what if I didn’t get the chance to tell you how much you mean to me? And not just your vessel or your grace, but everything. The way you are, just…your everything…how you tilt your head, the way you talk, your smile when you mean it, how much you care about me. Whatever angel manifestation leaks out is beautiful, sure, but it’s not you. It’s you right now but maybe one day it won’t be, and I don’t care. You’re so much more than an angel, Cas, you’re my friend, you’re my life, you’re my—”
“Why, thank you,” Dean says, easily following as Cas moves him. He straddles Cas and says, “I think you’d look great...if we got you a different coat.” He moves in to kiss him, but Cas pouts.
Cas gets up as the song ends, standing in front of the table. His hair is even more messed up than usual and his tie is further askew. He bows deeply. Dean stares at him, dazed. His brain isn’t completely booted back up yet, so he can’t find the words. Any words, in fact, so he just starts applauding. Cas bows again.
“Why do people use ‘angel’ as a romantic compliment?” Cas asks.
They never labeled it while it was happening, had never gone out in public together as a couple. Dean considered Benny to be one of his best friends, had even helped the guy get over an addiction. But as much as he loved Benny, Dean wasn’t ready to go there, and thankfully Benny understood. Sam had figured it out, though, just from one look at the two of them. And, obviously, Dean told Charlie.
“Ah, I can strum a guitar a little, but that’s it,” Dean says dismissively. “Didn’t really have the money for music lessons as a kid. You?”
Dean prepares for his first date with Castiel.
English is a finicky language, with so much room for interpretation inherent in certain phrases and words. There aren’t separate words for familial and romantic love like there are in, say, Spanish. Yet, Dean had recognized that what Cas felt was stronger than a family bond. It had to be. Despite that, he was still unsure about how Castiel’s feelings as a celestial being worked. Dean really needs to hear Cas explain it, he’d spent enough time speculating.
The monster (no, you remind yourself: his friend) gives you a look, still apprehensive about you and worried for him.
“How do you…love me?” He still has a hard time saying the word. He focuses hard on the road ahead of them. “How does it work for angels?”

The beach ball rides a wave back to shore where Jack picks it up. He takes it to the blanket and places it next to Cas.
Sam shakes his head, eternally exasperated with his brother. “Ask Cas what he wants to do?”
As the man and woman sway together in the snow, you wonder if that’s what he wants.
might make me uncomfy."
Castiel smiles down at him. “My apologies. Were you asleep?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas pants, and it’s almost sinful how far gone he already sounds. Dean promptly goes along with the business of getting Cas out of his pants.
“Okay let’s try it.”
“Dean!” Bobby yells from somewhere behind him.
Dean ruffles some confetti out of Cas’ hair, then gently trails his hand down to cup Cas’ cheek. “I love you.”
“Oh, yeah?” Dean says over his shoulder as he goes deeper.
before deleting the exclamation point. Can’t seem too eager. Although he is. Very eager.
“So more like cherubs?”
He sat next to you.
Charlie declares she knows the way, so she leads the group, Castiel in tow. The whole walk to the restaurant, Charlie and Cas are in the front, shoulder to shoulder. Talking. Laughing. And, Dean swears, glancing back at him. He can feel how red his face is. It’s the worst.
He shifts to face her and hugs her tight.
common.”
“Oh? Show me,” Cas challenges.
The “feather frenzy” vaults Cas’ body up to meet Dean’s. Their chests slap hotly, faces inches apart, the force of it making them grunt. Cas wobbles on his wings, so he grabs at Dean to steady himself, his right hand automatically going over the scar on Dean’s shoulder, his left wrapping around Dean’s back. Steadied and still panting, Cas looks up at him.
Dean rolls his eyes. He knows she means well, that she is a very good friend who’s just concerned, but he was hesitant to get into a big deep discussion just before a first date. So he tries deflecting.
“I can feel you starin’ at me.”
“Nah, nah, stay comfy,” Dean says.
“Of course, my liege.”
“I knew you were listening, old man! I’m kidding!” Dean yells back. “Here’s the price breakdown. Sorry again about the wait, man. Continentals are
They sneak back into the room as quietly as they can, but Cas insists they at least rinse off in the shower before going to sleep. When they emerge in their pajamas, they see Jack looking up at them from his spot in Sam and Eileen’s bed.
“But it’s -”
“I’m sorry.”
He slowly moves the hand that had been on the angel’s back, tracing Cas’ spine with his open palm, to join the other at the base of the wings. Experimentally, he starts massaging, working his thumbs under the coarse outer feathers to get at the soft down and skin beneath.
When they’d discussed where to go back at the bunker, Dean had insisted on the west coast. He wanted to watch the sunset with his family. To start their week-long vacation, they’d chosen a smaller beach, away from big crowds and attractions (although Eileen did want to try her hand at carnival games at some point during their stay).
To Dean’s delight, there is a small aquarium at the end of the pier. They put their shirts on and step inside.
When the tempo picks up and the cymbals come in, Cas sets the mic on the seat next to them. His hand goes from the mic to the back of Dean’s neck, then he leans in slowly. Dean closes his eyes and closes the distance. Cas’ mouth is soft against his own and he smells like honey. It’s intoxicating.
At some point, Dean remembers that he needs to breathe, and he slows the kiss down and lifts his lower half off of Cas. He ends up with just Cas’ bottom lip between his own again, and they stay like that, Dean unwilling to break contact.
After a while longer, Dean’s flip flop clad feet feel like they’re going to freeze off and Castiel realizes the late hour when he checks the moon’s position in the sky. They head back to the hotel.
an angel. I don’t think any earthly being could have your eyes.”
“We’re ready to go,” Dean says after a moment.
It’s always bothered me just a bit when modern AUs don’t address just how weird the name “Castiel” is. So I seek to rectify that.
, Dean really does shut off his phone.
“Goodnight.”
Dean laughs. “Yeah, with my brother, his girl, and our son in it, so that’s not - nevermind, I’ll explain later.” He kisses Cas once, quick, then maneuvers himself out from in between Cas and the pillar. “C’mon, let’s walk back.”
That’s what Charlie said to him about her opener when she invited Dean and Sam to her gig on Saturday night. Goddammit, she really knew his type.
You don’t get a chance to think about the warmth you felt.
Just then, Donna and Jody fall behind the group to match pace with them.
for those answers, not to just stare at him. It’s time to talk about it, and Dean won’t let Cas make any excuses this time.
“But what if they get all crumpled or something?”
“No,” he says.
“Hello, Dean,” he says when they get in.
Dean exhales in agreement. Benny had been his roommate for a year while he was paying for Sam’s last year of law school. The low price point he’d found on Craigslist should have been an indication of how horrible the place would be. The landlord was a monster, the walls were thin, the water was always cold. Benny and Dean developed a friendship over their struggles, and honestly it was necessary for their mutual survival. Nothing brings two people together quite like living through the same hell. It was a one bedroom so Dean had taken the living room initially, but he found himself spending more and more time in Benny’s room. One night one of them, Dean doesn’t remember who now, had suggested showering together to save money on water, and their relationship went on in that direction.
“’Cas’ is short for Castiel, Dean,” Charlie pipes up, unhelpfully, from Castiel’s side.
choice, which Dean believes makes what they choose from now on even better. He chose Cas. And Cas chose him, too.
When Cas opens the compartment, he makes an approving noise. “This is an impressive collection, especially for cassette tapes,” he says.
“Ah,” Cas says, remembering at that exact moment that they had made plans.
“Yes, Dean?” he says as he turns to look back at Dean.
Before they head back, Dean leads Cas under the pier.
When she hangs up, he immediately goes to enter the number into his contacts. As he edits he realizes he doesn’t know Castiel’s last name, and contemplates calling Charlie again. Or, he could ask the man himself. Yes. He’ll do that.
Cas smiles at him. “I’ll message you again soon, then. I think it will have to wait until my car is out of the shop. I’d hate to impose and I don’t want Gabriel driving me around like we’re in high school. Also, I’d like to know what you think of my car.”
When Cas moves to unbutton Dean’s jeans, he grabs Cas’ wrist.
“Can I go swimming, Dad?” he asks.
Eventually, the movement of their hips is all Dean can focus on and he has to take his tongue out of Cas’ mouth. They’re both panting and Dean keeps moving, grabbing the seat behind Cas with both hands. Dean’s cheek is resting on Cas’ so every noise Cas makes is directly in his ear.
“Good job! Your range is quite impressive, especially for someone who doesn’t do this regularly.”
“He’ll be fine!” Dean shouts over his shoulder.
Cas’ hands land heavily on Dean’s chest, pushing him backwards with angelic strength.
He says it like it’s the simplest truth in the universe. And, really, it is. It still hits Dean like a truck.
“Yes, they’re blue. Very original.” Cas rolls his eyes with a smile.
Well, the idea of it anyway, seeing as this was his first time actually going for a vacation. He’d seen it enough in movies and on television to paint what he thought was a pretty accurate picture, though.
“Yes. Archangel Gabriel you probably know. You also met Zeke and Anna last night. Anna is short for Anael, and Zeke goes by his middle name. His first is actually Gadreel, but he thought that sounded too odd. I like how odd my first name sounds, though.”
Charlie nods thoughtfully. “You’ll figure it out. Personally I found it was the little things that society had never prepared me for that stumped me at first. Like, who pays? But that’s only really a question if you want to keep up stupid patriarchal gender roles, and who wants to do that? Just split the check, who cares?”
You hold his head steady with one hand, his blood-soaked temple warm in your palm, as the car speeds down the highway.
Cas seems to be a natural at surfing, standing up on the board for almost every wave. Dean’s not as lucky, but he doesn’t hurt himself.
“Actually, yeah. Been keepin’ her up and running for a long time. It’s what lead me to become a mechanic.”
“Thanks,” he said over his shoulder. Cas rolled his eyes good-naturedly.
“I don’t know, but warriors of God definitely do,” Cas answers, tugging harder this time.
“That’s not how I sound, Dean.”
Cas leans back so he can look Dean full in the face. "A Pride parade?"
“Cas, why can’t I see anything -”
They found a spot away from most of the other people and set up camp. Once the blankets were laid out and the umbrellas stuck in the sand, Dean surveyed their surroundings. He spotted a small building with the words “Surf Food Stand” painted on a surfboard above a serving window, and realized it was in fact lunchtime.
“YOU’RE charming in your own ways,” he says, quirking an eyebrow.
“Does this mean I can never be on top?”
“The…what?”
Dean just stares for a second longer, then he glances at Cas’ mouth and shrugs. “Eh, they’ll happen again,” he says before leaning in to kiss Cas.
“Yes, the south-moving current off the coast here brings the cold water from Alaska,” Castiel says as he steps in. He shivers and continues. “Plus upwelling brings the deep ocean water towards the surface.”
Eileen raises her hand. “Me!”
“Can I ask you to do one thing?”
Dean comes into their room carrying two full trash bags in each hand. He drops two and flings the other two at Cas.
Dean pouts and Cas giggles at him. “Fine. But only ‘cause you called ‘em gorgeous.”
“Y’know. All the time you were around before humanity.”
From just ahead of them, Sam pipes up too. “Dean, did I hear Cas ask you out back there?”
“Are they laughing at me?” he asks, jutting his chin out at the pair ahead of them.
“No!”
"Nah, only what you want."
“Hey. So,” Dean gestures to Cas’ chest, “the tie thing, that’s on purpose.”
“I never really learned about this kinda stuff. Honestly I don’t know much about the natural world, y’know? Too focused on the supernatural.”
Dean also complains about the car at work. It was making such a distinctive sound that he couldn’t figure out what was wrong for the longest time, but was proud of himself for eventually figuring it out. He’s also waiting on parts for it, worried the owner is getting antsy because of how long it’s taking. Cas is sympathetic, but reassures Dean the customer probably understands.
Dean examines Castiel’s face and is overcome with emotion. Although angels don’t age, Dean feels as if he can see all they’d been through mapped out on this angel’s features. He can see every sacrifice in his worn skin, every shared laugh in the lines near his mouth, every longing look in the slant of his brows. Dean’s smile gets wider and the fluttering in his stomach gets more intense with the anticipation of what he’s about to say. What he should have said many, many times before this.
“I do indeed.” Cas just stares at him for a  second, smiling, before looking through the windshield. “So, may I ask where we’re going?”
“Yeah, I know. I’m fine.”
Unlike Dean, he had been many times. But he wasn’t going to brag about it. Most of that time had been spent in quiet observation rather than in volleyball tournaments anyway, so he doubted Dean wanted to hear about it.
“So, you did it. It’s over.”
Maybe if he says it out loud? He decides to go for a classic.
“Holy shit, that thing’s fuckin’ huge!”
He was looking forward to so many things, like the feel of the sand between his toes, the taste of salt on his lips. He was also very excited to get a piña colada or something similar. With a little umbrella, of course.
“No.”
“Who, Charlie and Cas?” Sam takes a moment to observe them. The whole time Sam’s looking, they don’t look back. Just his luck. “No, dude, I don’t think so?”
“Dean, please.” Cas pushes various pieces of costumes off the bed. “Lay down with me. We’ll finish tomorrow, I promise.” He opens his arms up to beckon Dean over.
“Charlie,” he says in his best accusatory tone.
“Huh,” Dean breathes in response.
Ah, perfect. There’s his opportunity. Dean leans back for a moment to look at his angel. He grabs Cas’ tie and tugs.
Dean’s arms fall to his sides with relief. He’d finally said what he wanted to. What he needed to. Cas takes his hand and laces their fingers together. He squeezes, and Dean squeezes back. They were both happier than they’d ever been, and were quickly getting used to the feeling. It was all going to be okay.
“Ah.”
“You changed me, too. You made me believe I was worth something. That I was worth something alive. Whenever I thought of living, of a future, you were there. I’d think about growin’ old, quitting hunting, settling down in the bunker. Sometimes I’d think about who would be there. Maybe Sam and Eileen would stay, but I wouldn’t be mad if they didn’t. You were always there, though. You’ve always been my future, Cas. And I’m sorry that future’s gonna have to be up here and not down there.”
Dean smiles, relaxing. "As long as I have you, I'll be good. And,” he looks at the pin in his hands, “I do want to go. Thanks."
And there it is. Cas’ future includes Dean, so Dean’s includes Cas. Dean grabs Cas’ hand and laces their fingers together.
“D-did…uh, what?”
“I wouldn’t.”
Suddenly Cas is in Dean’s lap. He moves the mic away from his mouth and asks, “Is this okay?” into Dean’s ear. Even though he knows Cas can feel how very much okay he is with this, Dean grabs Cas’ thighs and nods. Cas smiles and brings the mic back in between them. He starts doing the breathy moans in the song, and Dean thinks choosing this particular entry in Led Zeppelin’s discography was a very, very bad idea. Or…a very, very good one.
“Is that right?” Dean tries for cockiness, but he’s too breathless to pull it off.
Castiel revels in the touch. It had taken Dean a while to be comfortable showing this level of affection, and another while before he was okay showing affection in public. Cas was patient with him, of course. The rewards were well worth it.
“The moon is going to be almost full tonight, we wouldn’t see many stars.”
“Like...so much.”
work on my car.”
“Any of those heavens you built have the Grand Canyon in ‘em?”
They stand there in silence for a moment, looking at the place Jack was just a moment ago. Cas sighs.
He stands at the edge of the water, just far enough so the waves don’t reach his feet. He sees Venus shining in its place low in the sky. His tracks a few airplanes as they start their journey west over the Pacific.
Dean sighs happily. “Love you, too.”
Bobby stoops down to grab the phone and hands it back. “If you say so.” He’s got that twinkle in his eye that tells Dean Bobby knows exactly what kind of text he’s waiting on. He turns to walk back to his office
He watches the sanderlings run back and forth, making it look as though they’re playing tag with the waves. Dean bends to pick up a small shell, no bigger than the fingernail of his thumb. He examines the alternating bands of oranges and white that mark its surface before offering it to Cas.
how he feels than he is at saying it, so he hopes this next subject will let him do that.
“Charlie! Charlie. I forgot to ask for his number. Please tell me you have it.”
Dean is in no way prepared for what Cas says next.
Wait. He brought Cas all the way out here to
Later in the afternoon, Sam and Eileen relax on the beach chairs while Jack digs a hole big enough to stand in. Dean helped Jack dig most of it, but when his knees started to ache from the awkward angle he’d left the rest to the kid.
“Yeah, but I’m gonna.”
“I love you, too.”
He’s not sure if Castiel can hear prayers anymore, being in heaven and all. But he tries anyway. He just thinks it at first, with all the longing he can muster.
“Aw, shucks,” Dean jokes.
After her set, which totally rocked, Charlie finds the Winchesters and brings them backstage. They wave at the rest of the Wayward Sisters as they pass. The brothers had been to enough of Charlie’s shows to be friendly with the whole band. Donna pauses from taking the braid out of her hair to wave back. Jo sticks her tongue out at them and Jody turns from helping the stage team pack up their instruments to say, “Thanks for coming!”
They watch as Jack skips down the sand to join the brothers. He runs into Dean’s arms, and Dean swings him around before throwing him into the water. He pops up a second later, laughing. Sam starts a splash war, and Cas and Eileen return to their literary conversation.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean says, already confused.
He moves closer to you.
“What were you doing?” Sam asks them both.
“Dean. What’s wrong?”
“No, no, I just don’t want some punk teenager yelling at us to get a room, y’know?”
“Then we’ll be fine. So, Dean,” he begins, completely ignoring the baffled look on Dean’s face, “I have another performance this weekend. I’d love for you to attend.”
Further along, they walk through a flock of birds. They’re not seagulls, so Dean doesn’t recognize them. He asks Cas if he knows what they’re called, and yes, he does. The small gray and white ones with black beaks are sanderlings, specifically
“Holy fuck,” Dean says as he rolls off of Cas. “I’m gonna be feelin’
“You expectin’ a call, boy?” Bobby says from directly behind him.
“See you then. The Pimpmoblie and I thank you,” Cas says as he turns to get into his car.
“I don’t think it’s unfortunate to have friends who are aware of your character traits.”
Dean purses his lips in protest, but looks back down at the phone in his hand once more and sees the little [1 New Message(s)] on the phone’s screen. He almost drops it again.
They get more and more dramatic as the song goes on, shooting finger guns at each other on every
“They weren’t there once,” he starts. Cas feels a faint ache in his back at the memory, and his hand falls.
“Hm?” he answers around his straw.
Cas has to jump out of the way of a kid on a purple boogie board. Dean throws a foam football back to a group of players. Cas wonders if he should have brought a bottle of sunscreen so he could reapply it to Dean. Dean enjoys the heat on his back.
“Yeah, yeah, that one.” She points at the maroon button up with the black shirt. “But I am also here as your gay godmother. I know I’m the one who pretty much set this thing up ‘cause you said you were good before, but I don’t want to push you on Cas if you’re not ready to actually date a guy.”
Cas’ blush deepens. Dean’s smile widens.
Just as he speaks, a shark breaches on screen, catching a seal in its huge open mouth.
Cas smirks. “We’ll see, won’t we?”
“Uh, what - ”
Castiel continues his watching today. He sits on a blanket watching Sam and Eileen help Jack make a sand castle, the shape oddly reminiscent of the Tower of Babel. He turns to tell Dean this, but Dean is lying down next to him under the shade of the umbrella, eyes closed under his sunglasses and hands folded behind his head.
“Thank you. That was a quote. And a badly paraphrased one, at that.”
Dean leans in further, taking his hand off Cas’ cheek. “Yes.”
Dean’s hips gradually get faster as the kiss deepens. The grip Cas has on his thighs is, dare he say it, heavenly.
When the sea breeze finally hit his nose, he breathed in delightedly. They were still probably a few minutes away from seeing the sand but he was already itching to stretch his legs.
“Hmm,” Castiel hums in thought. He looks out to the waves and watches them wash over the shore. The water looks beautiful and, Castiel thinks, inviting. “You could start by going into the water with me?”
“And believe me, I’m flattered that you want me right here right now but - mmph!” Dean’s cut off by Cas covering his mouth with his own.
, mixed in as well.
“Yeah?”
Dean tells Cas more about Sam, about how they live together in a nice apartment and how he’s proud of his brother for working so hard to become a lawyer. They talk about how they each met Charlie (Dean at a college LARPing event and Cas at the first venue his band played with the Wayward Sisters) and mutually thank her for bringing them together.
"Happy Pride-a-versary, babe." Dean throws a gift bag at Cas and flops onto the couch next to him.
You fall asleep with his head on your shoulder.
“Abso-fuckin’-lutely,” Dean says, spilling the contents of all the bags onto their bed.
,” he says.
“It’s gorgeous, man.”
Cas pats the striped belly of his fuzzy bee onesie. “This one’s cute,” he says, adjusting the antenna headband.
“Hell yeah.”
A teenage girl in a blue vest greets them, offering to tell them about the cast of a seal skull she has in front of her. Dean listens receptively, glancing at Cas a few times to confirm if her facts are accurate. He nods each time.
This sentence must have been too much for Dean, because he buries his face in Cas’ chest. He murmurs something that Cas can’t make out.
A lot of the song is instrumental, so Cas has time to sway and dance enticingly. Dean never takes his eyes off him. Dean thinks even if Cas wasn’t moving like that, he’d be turned on. He was currently getting serenaded with
Dean does a double take, mischievous smile turning into a fond one when he realizes Cas doesn’t understand what he’s implying.
“Karaoke.”
Cas turns to Eileen for confirmation. She nods.
“No need to apologize, I wholly understand. Thank you.” Cas hands over his card then puts his hands in his pockets, pulling his coat closer around himself while Dean completes the transaction. The gesture makes Cas look smaller, even shy. Dean thinks it’s cute. “Now that I have my car back we can go on that second date. I must confess I’ve been anxiously waiting. That’s the only reason I wish you had been faster about fixing the car. I almost called the shop multiple times a day to ask about the hold up, but I would never want to be that kind of customer.”
“Gay sex is holy, actually,” Cas says plainly, with no room for argument.
Cas kisses him, just once. “I’d love to, but I like your eyes the way they are: gorgeous, green, and not burned out.”
Castiel widens those beautiful blue eyes. Dean takes the blush he sees as his victory trophy.
“Well? Aren’t you mad at me for not saying it back then?” Dean knows he’s projecting, but maybe Cas is as disappointed as he is with himself that it took him this long. He looks over and sees Cas full-on beaming at him.
Dean breathes deeply before asking again, differently and directly. “What do you want?”
Cas leans towards Dean just a bit more.
When the deep timbre of the voiceover fades, you get up.
“They’re really awesome,” Dean says simply after some time.
Dean’s eyes go wide. “Oh, shit.”
A quick look at his watch tells Dean they do have the time to talk, and maybe he does want to. If it would make Charlie feel better, he’ll talk. It might make him feel better, too, because he really was a little lost. He plops down on his bed next to Charlie, making her bounce with his weight. He sighs, laying back to stare at the ceiling.
“Hey,” Dean says to Cas, watching Sam drive away.
“But still. Do you write the songs for the band?”
century, the first submarines.
Dean recognizes Gabe as the trumpeter. He’s about Charlie’s height, and his smile is infectious. Definitely the charisma of the band. Anna, the redheaded keyboardist, smiles at Dean like she knows something he doesn’t. He’s sure she does, but it makes him suspicious nonetheless. Zeke, the guitarist, is much more severe than the rest of them. His face matches the singer’s intensity without the mysterious quality that had pulled Dean in.
The lead singer has messy dark brown hair and a 5 ‘o clock shadow. Sharp nose, defined cheekbones, and a slightly cleft chin. He’s got an intense severity about his expression that Dean finds captivating. It matches his serious-looking white button down and black slacks. Dean thinks the outfit is way too formal-looking for the dingy bar stage the band is on, but it fits the singer well. The only thing not perfectly in place about the ensemble is his backwards blue tie. Dean wonders if that little detail was on purpose.
“No. No, Dean,” Castiel says without skipping a beat. “No part of me could ever hate you. Sometimes I lament the missed opportunities, and yet…even if we weren’t at this stage,” he pats Dean’s arm, “I could tell you loved me, in your own way. Although I thought that ‘way’ was different from mine. But it was enough for me then. I do very much like this, though.”
Cas smiles conspiratorially, taking delight in this little rule breaking. “Okay.”
And, together, they answer, “It’s Shark Week.”
Cas looks down and fiddles with the tie. “Yes. Although I enjoy formal wear,” Cas shakes a raised fist at the sky and scrunches his brows, “I have to stick it to The Man somehow. I am a rock star after all.”
“Whuh…hi.”
“Does this happen every time?” he whispers heatedly into it.
☼ ☼ ☼
Dean throws a leg over Cas and sits in his lap. Cas keeps the intense stare on Dean’s face, but Dean can tell he’s not sure what to do with his hands, still probably a little nervous. Dean lightly grips Cas’ wrists, putting his hands first on his knees then slowly dragging them upwards over his thighs and pushing them back down. When Cas gets the idea, Dean moves his hands to hold each side of Cas’ face. It’s all so gentle but so intense. It’s, to be incredibly cliché, too much and not nearly enough. He kisses Cas again with much more purpose this time.
“Hey, Cas?”
“Mhm. Good ol’ Perseus.”
Cas smirks. “Me, too.” He kisses Dean. “It’s nice seeing you let loose like this.”
“Cas?”
“What? I’ve been driving for hours, I deserve a massage.”
The brothers get out of the Impala and stand together, looking back at the road so far. Sam says he’s going to find Eileen. His car is already packed with supplies so he’ll leave right away, and he’s got a good idea of where she might be. Dean says he wants to stay put, maybe run some sort of safe house for hunters in the area, but he doesn’t sound sure. Sam can tell something (or someone) is missing from the picture, even if Dean doesn’t know what (or who) that is. Dean looks over at the sleeping angel in his car and Sam knows what to say.
“Okay, okay,” Dean says, swatting away her finger.
“Um.”
He hears the
“Yes?”
“Understandably, seeing as birds are not exactly Heaven-sent…” Cas stops himself, realizing he’d just been paid a compliment. “Oh.”
“My eyes?”
“Yeah, it was my dad’s,” Dean says, confused. “How did you know?”
But he stops himself, goes with a safer avenue of conversation. “So, uh, do you just sing?”
“Hmm,” Cas puts his elbows on the table and links his fingers under his chin. He tilts his head and fixes a curious stare on Dean. “Why not?”
love.
But something stops his hand. Something warm and alive and feathery. Dean opens his eyes.
Cas rips open a medium sized package, removing a rainbow sweat headband and matching wristbands. He stretches the headband, looking at Dean with a bemused expression. "Once again, I ask: what's all this?" He continues to open packages, revealing more and more rainbow paraphernalia.
✧🦈✧🦈✧🦈✧
be. Just don’t- don’t ever leave me again.” He takes a shuddering breath, calming himself. “Please.”
Eileen wins a huge unicorn for Sam at one of the shooting games on the Santa Monica Pier. It barely fits in the Impala.
“Nah, I hardly even do karaoke.”
“I was about to ask if you like music, but…” Dean says honestly.
busy,” Jody continues.
Cas gives Dean some directions and the Impala takes off. It’s going to be a long ride.
When they got everything out of the Impala, he rushed down the stairs of the lot, barely containing his excitement. Then someone grabbed the back of his shirt, stopping him from being run over by three bicyclists. He looked down to see a paved two-way bike lane between him and the sand.
Dean tries to clear his throat and finds he can speak again. So he says, quietly, “Cas, no. You’re coming back with me.”
Castiel’s smile grows relaxed. He moves his hand to cover Dean’s. “So, how much do I owe you?”
“They fuckin’ are.”
But on silent means he doesn’t know if Cas texted unless he looks at his phone. So he looks at his phone while he works. Way more than usual. It’s fine, it’s not like Bobby really cares. Anyways, he won’t get caught, he-
“Thanks for giving me a chance.”
Then Cas is on his neck, leaving sloppy open-mouthed kisses from his ear to where the hood of his sweatshirt covers his collarbone. Dean grabs a fistful of Cas’ hair just to have something to hold onto.
His eyes find Dean just as a spotlight illuminates his face. The harsh white light makes them look incredibly blue, like the sky after a thunderstorm. It feels like the stare pierces straight through Dean to his soul. It’s all he can do to hold it.
Dean looks away, composing himself, then glances at Castiel’s wings.
Cas’ hands gain confidence as they move from Dean’s thighs to his sides, his back, his arms. He feels Cas squeeze a bicep and hum appreciatively against his mouth. It’s Dean’s turn to make an appreciative noise when Cas’ hands reach his chest. The brush of Cas’ fingers against his nipples, even through his shirt, is a
In fact, he takes it as his cue to go a little further. He runs his fingers under the hem of Dean’s shirt and hoodie, pushing them up so he can explore Dean’s torso with one hand.
“And this,” Charlie says as she untangles herself from the singer, “is Cas.”
. Dean, I might never fully grasp what it means to be human, I know that. But the more I was around you, the more I began to understand. I could spend all of eternity going over books and poems, watching romantic comedies and listening to love songs, but the purest expression of love I’ll ever find is in you. So, in the most human capacity, I lo-”
Dean probably pulled into the parking lot a little too quickly, judging by the look a surfer sitting in the back of a pickup gave him. He made sure to park far away from the guy.
The question that plagued Dean first and foremost was what kind of “love” Cas had been referring to in his speech.
“I missed you,” Dean says.
“Cas? Cas, you there?”
Dean turns to him, a distressed look on his face.
Dean gapes at him. “Dude.” But Cas keeps laughing, and Dean can’t help it. He cracks a smile and shakes his head. “I dunno, man,” he says, looking down at the finger-shaped bruises on his hips and the love bites forming on his thighs. “Ain’t much holy about what we just did.”
“Stop it,” Cas says half-heartedly.
“The paintings do lack a certain something.”
The next morning over a breakfast of cereal, Dean enthusiastically investigates the eruption of feathers. He asks if it hurt, if Cas can feel what the edge of the feathers touch, can Cas control it? Somewhere in the middle of the questioning, Dean had taken to calling it “a feather frenzy.” Cas doesn’t like that.
Dean parks in front of the address Cas gave him. He gets out of his car, leaning against the hood. He texts
“I can help you do that,” Cas says, running his hands up and down Dean’s sides.
♫ ♫ ♫
“Sometimes I hate myself for it,” Dean says quietly, barely audible over the crash of waves and squawk of seagulls.
He leans in, devastatingly slow. He stops for a moment when their foreheads touch. Dean licks his lips, and he can definitely feel Cas breathing now.
Looking up, Dean can clearly see against the cream-colored ceiling how frayed they are, messy like Cas had been flying for too long, messy like Cas’ hair when he wakes up.
Without breaking eye contact, he feels Cas’ fingers cover his. It’s still far too light of a touch for the gravity of the conversation they’re having. Cas stares at him for a moment longer. It feels like hours before he speaks. Maybe it is, who knows how time works in heaven.
“I’m almost halfway done and I still don’t know if I like the protagonist.”
The tree at your back is rough and unforgiving.
“You said…you said you love me,” Dean starts. He’s still kind of in disbelief, so it comes out almost as a question.
Cas’ lips.
“I do.”
“Really? You like this? I feel kinda silly,” Dean says, pulling at the daisy petals surrounding his face.
They pass the time amicably, everyone talking and in good spirits. The food is the typical fare, and Dean gets a fantastic burger with a chocolate milkshake. Gabe starts to recount a particularly wild night at a venue who had assumed they’d only play gospel music. The subject causes a lot of crosstalk, Gabe’s band members piping up to correct him and the Wayward Sisters interjecting with their own similar stories. Dean has nothing to add so he sits back to enjoy the stories and his milkshake. Cas takes the opportunity to turn his attention to Dean.
The few lights they had left on in the motel room seem to go out behind his eyelids as Dean hears his own name shouted back in a deep gravelly voice.
Cas, still in his pajamas (one of Dean's old shirts and black sweatpants that say “JUICY” across the backside in bright pink), properly knots the tie. "What's the occasion?"
“Heyyy, Bobby. A text, yeah. But uh, it can wait. Sorry, I’ll get back to it.”
and gesturing wildly. By the end of the song, they’re both slightly out of breath. They collapse on the booth, leaning up against each other. Dean downs his water glass and hands the other to Cas. Cas drinks and grabs the song book, scanning through it lazily while they eat chicken wings and carrot sticks.
Dean drops his gaze apologetically. Cas notices some unknown emotion building on what he can see of Dean’s dipped face. When he looks up, though, it’s easy enough to place. Dean looks sad. Cas examines his drooping expression, trying to understand why he’d feel that way. Before he gets the chance to, Dean pulls him into a hug.
Their date that still…needs a
“Sure,” he says as he slides across the tile to run his hands over Dean’s shoulders. They travel down, washing over the taut muscle and coming to rest at the curve of Dean’s hips. As his fingertips slide under the elastic band of the pants, Dean forgets what he’s doing and drops a plate. The clatter brings him out of the trance, and he clears his throat and dips down to get Cas’ fingers out.
“No, that’s why I asked you to come over,” Dean says, holding up two shirts. “Does Cas have a favorite color?”
“What?”
“Dean, you have to let me go.” But Cas makes no move to disentangle himself from Dean’s hold.
The blush darkens as Cas pulls back to look at Dean. Dean expects him to be flustered, but when Cas opens his eyes they focus on Dean with passionate determination. The intensity of the gaze is familiar, but the full extent of the intent behind it is all new. The look stirs something inside Dean.
They walk in comfortable silence, watching the birds and the people.
Out of habit, Dean starts humming along to the lyrics. Cas notices and asks, “Do you have any musical proclivities?”
“Oh! Oh yeah, don’t worry about them,” he says with a wave. “They know.”
Dean lays back on the hood, driver’s side, of the Impala. He has his hands behind his head, left leg bent. He looks up at the sky, idly watching some clouds go by. Thinking.
Dean’s answering smile is softer than the blanket they’re laying on, brighter than any of the shooting stars they’d seen that night.
Castiel knows what he’s implying this time. He sinks down, knees on either side of Dean’s hips. He steadies himself on one elbow next to Dean’s head, the other resting softly on Dean’s chest. Dean reaches up to grab the back of his neck to bring him the rest of the way down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut up.”
“Uh-uh, we’re ALL playing,” Dean says as he grabs Sam’s arm.
There’s a pause in the conversation. Now it
They sit in silence for a while, Dean just enjoying being in the Impala with Cas, being next to him, being in his presence. It’s nice. A pure feeling of comfort covers them like a warm blanket for the rest of the ride. Once they reach their destination, Dean has another question to ask.
They walk along the edge of the water, letting the sea wash away their footprints. Dean lets go of Cas’ hand only to run in front of him and splash him with a kick as a big wave comes around their feet. Cas kicks back, but Dean’s already out of range. He makes a pouty face and Dean returns to his side to plant a kiss on his cheek. The next time it’s Cas who gets the upper hand.
“Ooh, now I KNOW you’re not fine. ‘I’m fine’ is Winchester for ‘I’m not fine.’ That’s what I’m here for, though.”
Sometimes Castiel got the urge to go overboard, to grab Dean’s face in the supermarket and kiss him till they both can’t breathe, to tell everybody and anybody who would listen at the bus stop that the man that he loves loves him back.
“Mhm, mhm,” Dean says distractedly. Cas catches him staring at his ass.
, the angel deserves to be selfish. He deserves happiness, however it looks. Dean searches for answers in Cas’ face while he thinks about all of this.
Castiel turns to kiss Dean’s temple. “You don’t have to,” he says into his hair.
Castiel smiles. “Okay.”
“Cas,” Dean cuts him off, sensing Cas’ incoming deflection. “We have eternity. There’s no point not telling me the whole truth.” He pauses for a moment before adding, “You deserve everything you want.”
Cas makes a thoughtful noise. “Should I be?”
He explains the rules to Jack and Cas as Eileen sets up the bases by making mounds of sand.
“Hey, this is Dean with Bobby’s Auto Shop letting you know your car is done. We appreciate your patience, and call us back if you need a ride. Thanks for choosin’ us.”
“All right. Solo.” Cas pushes Dean to stand.
be in the having. It
“He’ll be all right,” Jack says reassuringly. “Give him time.”
The long drive from Kansas to California had ended late that morning. Dean drove with the windows down once the highway ended, waiting for the telltale smell of salt on the air.
Soon after they have a second round of hot dogs and burgers from the Surf Food Stand, it’s sunset.
“I’m right here,” he says. “We’re spending time together. You must want something else, too.”
Through texting back and forth, Dean learns he finds Cas hilarious. His responses are unexpected but incredibly logical; even over text there’s this dry wit that reminds Dean of the deadpan way Cas had said “stick it to The Man” and it cracks Dean up every time. Dean also learns Cas works at a used book store, and Dean thinks it fits him well. He can perfectly imagine Cas in the store, with his dress shirt sleeves rolled up, reshelving worn out poetry anthologies.
“That’s what you are, no?”
, Dean thinks,
Cas finds it and puts the tape in to the deck. Robert Plant’s voice comes through the speakers.
“Hey, Cas, could you get your feathery ass down here?”
“C’mere,” he says, opening his arms up and making a beckoning motion with his hands towards where Cas stands.
“Yes.”
Jack smiles fondly. With practiced seriousness he says, “What can I do for you?”
“You could have something here, if you trained your voice.”
It’s a fucking miracle that Dean’s entire milkshake doesn’t come spurting out his nose. He prays to every deity he can think of to not completely choke.
“…thank you.”
At his break a few hours later, he thinks of something. He turns his phone back on to text Charlie.
“Would you like to go on a date?”
“Was this passed down to you?”
Cas smirks at Dean’s barely contained enthusiasm. “You want me to do the accent, too?”
Cas half-heartedly does his part, more interested in sneaking a peek at Dean’s yet-to-be-covered chest, lingering on the tattoo above his heart, or watching Dean’s calloused hands work a sponge over dirtied plastic. Suddenly Dean stops scrubbing and looks straight up at the kitchen wall in front of him. Cas glances up at his profile, confusion outweighing worry.
The rest of the week goes as planned. Some highlights:
“Trust me, there are certain places you don’t want sand.”
Castiel’s eyes go impossibly wide. He looks like he’s about to cry.
“Based on the wonderful condition it’s in, I figured it was either passed down or you are a lot richer than you seem.” Damn, he’s quick, and Dean appreciates that Cas recognizes the value of his car.
“Fuckin’ amazing, dude.”
“Dean,” Cas whispers into his ear.
Cas stares at the bag in his lap like he's trying to see through it. Multicolored tissue paper sticks out of the holographic bag. He puts his hands in, pulling out multiple packages of various sizes. "What's all this?"
Dean’s hips jerk up involuntarily, Castiel a solid weight on top of him. He almost whines, almost, when Cas pulls his hoodie back down over his stomach. But Castiel puts his mouth back on Dean’s and he forgives him. Then Cas starts moaning and moving his hips, and Dean isn’t exaggerating anymore.
“I mean it!” Dean yells at the back of Bobby’s head. “I’ll shut the damn thing off!”
“You were getting sunburnt,” Cas says in explanation before kissing him.
Cas can hear Dean's smile when he replies, "Love you, too."
“Looks like I did. Novak, huh?”
“Don’t. Please.”
“I think so. Goodnight.”
Dean’s face lights up when he thinks of a particularly good inquiry.
He looks around Cas’ shoulders at what he can see of the wings, examining them.
“Yeah. I’ll learn as I go, I guess.” He sits up, leans his shoulder against hers. “But honestly, dude. I’m definitely in a good place now. I know after…”
Cas turns to him. “Yes?”
Come talk to me at dunkindestieldonuts on tumblr!
He elbows her in the side playfully. “Yes, shut up, you’re always right. But, ah. Why did he look so…smug?”
“Hey, what can I help you wi - ” Dean gets through before looking up to look at the customer.
“I don’t think so!” Cas says, smiling.
“Castiel, a human has never been here before so I don’t know what I can do to him, but know I CAN do something. I’ll find it. I’ll find something horrible to do to him in no time. You KNOW I’m not patient.”
Dean can’t help but laugh. Cas smiles at him, then pats the seat in between them.
“Good.” He pulls back to meet Castiel’s eyes. “It wouldn’t be my idea of Heaven without you.”
That evening, in the emptying street, Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ neck. Cas steadies him with both hands on his hips.
“Of course. But if you need rescuing at any time for any reason, I will be just a phone call away.” She points a finger in his face in mock seriousness. “I’ll make up any bullshit excuse you need. Because I love you.”
Ah. There it is.
Castiel’s wings fill the room. They are spread lazily wide, covering the ceiling and ghosting the walls on either side of the room. So that’s the reason for the lights.
He could watch the sea for eons. Had done so, in fact. During the beginning, most of the angels watched humanity. Castiel had often turned his eyes to nature, to the flora and fauna of the Earth. That in turn pointed his gaze to the sea, seeing as how more than three quarters of life on the planet was to be found under the waves (the vast majority even now as yet unidentified by human science).
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll be there. I give good massages.”
“I remember. Why are you thinking about this now?”
“Shit, Cas,” is all Dean can say against Cas’ cheek. It’s almost too much. His hips are twitching on their own accord, his body desperately searching for friction. He vaguely thinks how much of a shame it is that they’re both fully clothed.
“Y-yeah?” Dean blushes. Knowing Cas had been as impatient as him made his stomach flutter. Butterflies. Like a teenager. Damn, he was sappy.
“You brought a HUMAN? How is he even HERE? Castiel, of all the - wait. Waaaait, wait, wait, wait.” The being chuckles. It’s an even worse noise than the thing just talking. “No, this is THEE human, isn’t it, Castiel?” Dean feels Cas’ grip on him tighten. “The one you just…oh this is hilarious! Hellooo, Dean,” the voice says. Hearing his name does it. He lets go of Cas with one hand, still afraid of letting go completely, and covers one ear, crying out.
“Yeah, yeah.” Bobby waves him off over his shoulder. “Whatever, just finish up the Continental.”
Cas’ wings flex, mirroring the fluttering of his heart at the words. It isn’t the first time Dean has said this, but each time is special. Unfortunately, this one is particularly strange.
“Agreed,” Cas says, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck.
After midnight, the show really starts to pick up. Dean points to draw Cas’ attention, but he can feel Cas still staring at him. He chuckles. "C'mon Cas, you're supposed to be watchin' the meteor shower."
“Ask him what?”
Dean starts fidgeting again. "Now,
“I love you, too.”
Cas perks up at that. "Am I to wear all these items?"
Cas smiles at him. That’s a good enough reason to get out of bed, and he doesn’t want to sour the excited look on Dean’s face. “Ah, the Perseids?” he asks.
Dean grabs Cas’ hand and wiggles his eyebrows. “Go on that second date with me and we’ll call it even.”
Sam makes a noise of agreement. They pass the rest of the drive in thoughtful silence. Dean looks at the road, checks on Cas in the rearview. Sam stares out the window, checks on Dean when he looks away from the road.
“Yes.”
In his shock, Dean’s fists relax, finally letting go. He regrets it immediately, because Cas pulls back.
Cas had wanted to look through the Met Gala outfits, insisting he should learn something about fashion. Dean didn’t think this was the best way to do it - looking through Old Navy’s website would probably be more practical - but Cas was intrigued when he learned Heavenly Bodies had been a theme.
Cas giggles. “Maybe someday.” He hands Dean the song book. “But for now, I’ll sing something you choose. It’s only fair.”
Castiel loves the ocean.
Dean hadn’t bothered with a shirt, sticking to his favorite grey-blue sweatpants.
“Dean. You know what I mean.”
“Take ‘em off if you don’t like ‘em,” Dean suggests, wiggling his eyebrows.
Then Cas shoves him aside. But Dean’s hunter instincts take over and he steadies himself. He lunges forward, ignoring the horror on Castiel’s face, ignoring the creeping black ooze enveloping Cas. He wraps his arms around the angel and the Empty takes them both.
Chapter title: Gotye (2011) from Making Mirrors
They return to Jack and Sam hitting a beach ball back and forth, Eileen reading under the umbrellas. Dean runs up to steal the ball and sprints away with it, Sam on his heels. Cas joins Eileen.
Cas smiles, content. It’s the softest smile Dean had ever seen on him. It fits his face perfectly.
“Yes, like he said. Give me time. I haven’t seen any light in a while, it’s a little disorienting.”
Dean feels a hand grab the back of his neck, and he is pulled into a much deeper kiss. Cas opens Dean’s mouth with his tongue, licking his lips apart, trying to get Dean to do more. Dean responds with a groan, parting his mouth as per Cas’ demand. Their rhythm picks up, tongues sliding over each other, teeth clashing every so often.
sweatpants, Cas notices as he leans on the doorframe. He sighs appreciatively and stares.
“That’s what we’re doing,” Cas says with determination.
Dean grabs something from his back pocket. He shows Cas a small button with the bi pride flag. "We're goin' to a parade this weekend."
Cas is just a tad bit annoyed. He’d already settled into bed, book in hand, but Dean is being insistent. He rolls his eyes and sticks in his bookmark. When he goes to change out of his pajamas, Dean stops him.
Without turning around, Dean says, “I can feel that, y’know.”
They quickly began critiquing the outfits based on the theme. Where was the plaid? Where was the Midwest Gothic aesthetic? The cowboy boots? The comic books?
in fact know all the lyrics. He finds himself agreeing with the second line.
He doesn’t wake, but you think his face betrays disappointment (maybe “but you hope” is the proper phrase).
“What’s this?” Cas asks as he catches one. Dean opens the ones near him, revealing all the costumes within.
“Have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known, and all that.”
“Dean, you know I could never stay mad at you. And…I wasn’t expecting you to respond. I wasn’t even expecting Jack to save me. I thought that was going to be the end for me. I knew it was a lot to put on you, and I understand how overwhelming it was, but I needed to say it before I died. I didn’t need to hear it then.”
Sam jerks his head, confused. “Do you know how?”
Dean’s brain instantly goes into super domestic territory. Cas bringing him lunch, kissing him on the forehead, making friends with his coworkers. That sounds nice. The thought goes on to imagining living with Cas, going to all his shows, going home with him after the shows,
“That’s good.” He hears the smile in Cas’ voice.
Dean plasters a shit-eating grin on his face and gives Cas a suggestive look. “Baby, you know it.” Cas laughs at him and he knows the confident façade didn’t work, but he doesn’t care much. Cas is smiling at him and that’s good enough.
“Hello, Dean. Sam,” Cas says, shaking each of their hands. Dean’s eyebrows shoot up. Cas’ speaking voice is deep and gravelly, and sounds absolutely nothing like his singing one. “Ah, you’ve got the look. Yes, I know, I sound nothing like how I sing.” Damn. Maybe he
“Now let the queen get her beauty sleep, bitch.”
“Tonight.”
Dean smiles smugly, lifting his chin and shrugging his shoulders to emphasize the bi cape. “Yeah. Really felt the love. And the gay...ness.”
“I’m sorry?”
, about the Continental. “Uh, you were right. It’s interesting.”
Dean chuckles. “I do, I do. I especially like how it looks on our bedroom floor,” he says with a wink. Cas squeezes his thigh, right over a particularly large bruise, and Dean gasps. Cas smirks up at him.
Dean laughs, which jostles Cas’ head. “I
“Yeah, I know.”
“To be honest, I don’t know. Thought I’d come up with something on the drive here but I didn’t. And now I’m here. And you’re here. Uh. Is there anything you’d like to do?”
✧✨✧✨✧✨✧
“I had fun,” Dean says, a little drunk and a lot giddy. He takes a sticker from his forehead and smacks it onto Cas’ cheek, patting it down.
You don’t want to deal with that rejection, with his shoulder turning cold, yet you dutifully watch the screen.
“I’m known to have those sometimes.”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
for a few days.”
“Hmm?” Cas murmurs quietly as he reverts his gaze back to his bowl of cereal.
“Oh, dear, that won’t do.” The being clears its throat. “How’s this?” The voice changes into something Dean’s brain can take. “Better? Good. So, Castiel, are you going to introduce us?” It still makes Dean’s ears ring a bit on certain sounds, like its hitting a frequency just outside of human hearing. The accent is one he’s never heard, completely unidentifiable. Although the being is addressing Cas now, Dean shouts back.
Dean grabs them from her, pouting. “No! I went to Sammy’s graduation in these!”
“Pshh, yeah unfortunately she knows me pretty well.”
Cas twiddles his thumbs. “I’ve been busy.”
After a moment, Cas says, “How does the phrase go? Better late than never?”
I’m right.” He gets one hand under Cas’ chin and lifts his head up to look into his eyes. “You should keep kissing me, though.”
“Do you think they’re beautiful?”
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says, breaking Dean out of his stupor.
Dean keeps his eyes closed, focusing on the sensation of Cas riding him through it. After a while he feels Cas shudder and collapse onto his chest, their stomachs making a wet, sticky sound as they collide. Cas rests his cheek on Dean’s, still breathing heavily, straight into Dean’s ear.
, by the way. Cas is older than the beach they’re sitting on, had seen more in his existence than Dean could ever even begin comprehend…and yet the one thing he wants in all the universe is Dean. Dean couldn’t fully believe it for the longest time. He couldn’t believe it when Cas had first said the words.
Cas climbs up next to him. He shuffles a bit, getting his trench coat in order. When he settles, Dean looks over and breathes out a laugh when he sees how formal Cas looks even laying down. His hands are folded on his stomach in front of him, legs completely straight so his feet dangle over the grill.
He’ll be fine (but will you?).
“Interesting car.”
“Ah, yes of course.” Cas nods, not understanding the reasoning but appreciating Dean’s conviction.
Cas looks up at Dean through his lashes, slightly surprised at the ease Dean had finding the word, then straightens and tilts his head. He thinks for a moment.
“Thank you kindly,” Dean says in an exaggerated Southern drawl as he sits back down.
Of course, the simpler answer was that deep sea vessels were required to be approximately 1100 times stronger than spacecraft in order to withstand the pressure. But humans had almost always been more interested in the sky than the sea. There was more funding for space, more media regarding it.
“Sorry, was that too strong?”
Castiel smirks and ever so slightly nods. It makes Dean love him even more. He throws his arms around Cas’ neck and kisses him, almost knocking them both over with the force of it. The angel catches him and, more importantly, kisses Dean back. Dean pulls away and tucks his face into the crook of Castiel’s neck and tightens his grip. Dean knows no one is coming to take Cas away this time, but he still needs to hold on. They fit in each other’s arms perfectly.
“Oh?” Cas looks like he’s holding back a laugh, and Dean wouldn’t blame him. He’d answered way too quickly. “Okay. Should I pick you up from here or…” Cas reaches out and cradles the side of Dean’s face in his hand. Dean stares back, wide-eyed at the gentleness of the touch, as Cas swipes his thumb across Dean’s cheek. He pulls his hand back to show the dark smudge he’d wiped off Dean’s face. “Would you like to go home first?”
Castiel’s smile is blinding. It’s better than any sunset Dean had ever seen. Or will ever see, he thinks, even here. He cradles Cas’ face in his hands and kisses him just because he can. Cas hums contentedly against him, grabbing the back of his jacket to pull Dean closer. Dean thinks he can feel Cas’ happiness radiating off of him, seeping through their clothes and surrounding them. He breaks the kiss just to hug Cas again. Over the angel’s shoulder, Dean sees Bobby still on the porch. Dean smiles at him.
They decide it’s more fun to sing together, so they pour over the song book for artists they both know. Cas knows way more - music is his job after all - but Dean is pleasantly surprised by how many they have in common. They split the check.
You don’t want him to look bad.
“Now that I know where you work, I might be coming around more often.” Cas glances over his shoulder at the other mechanics. “If that’s okay with you, of course.”
“To watch the meteor shower!”
“Oh. Yeah.” Again, something he wouldn’t usually readily admit. But Cas seems excited about this choice, and he
you’re fine. Are your phones on silent? What the hell are you doing? I was worried!”
“Yeah,” Charlie saves him from saying
“Hello.” He smiles before Dean kisses him. Another wave interrupts them.
It’s a short few blocks from the hotel back to the beach. When they reach the sand, Cas glances at the empty lifeguard tower. “Is this allowed?”
Dean ends with “or whatever” because he still has no idea what they should do. Sure, a dinner date would be the typical go-to, but he feels like that might bore Cas and that’s the last thing he wants to do. Although he’s not sure
He doesn’t look back.
Light in front of his eyelids. Dean opens his eyes. He’s standing in the dungeon, back to the wall. Alone. He reaches up to touch his cheek. It’s stained in tears that aren’t his.
✧🏳️‍🌈✧🏳️‍🌈✧🏳️‍🌈✧
The respect people had for the ocean was well-deserved. The fear, as well. It was one of the most dangerous natural forces. But humans were always trying to push the boundaries of their capabilities. They’d gone to space, after all.
Dean walks to where the sand starts to slope down to the water, so if they sit they won’t be seen from the sidewalk. He lays the blanket down and lies back on it.
It’s unsuccessful. Gabe laughs at him. “It’s his name,” he says, pointing back at Cas.
Cas smiles up at him like he knows he has the best answer. The confidence is hot, but also overwhelmingly endearing.
Some of Earth’s oldest creatures resided still under the rollicking waves of the sea. Most sharks and the lobe-finned coelacanth had hardly changed in the millions of years they’d existed. Castiel knew, because he had watched.
Dean sighs serenely, turning to watch the streaks of orange light dance on the water.
“Huh. I guess you’re right.”
He throws an imaginary key at Dean. Dean can’t help but play along, lifting his hand to “catch” it. The guy smiles at him through the next line, then turns his attention to the rest of the crowd to finish the song. Dean finds he misses his gaze.
“Sorry.”
“I love you, Cas.”
Dean leans down, flush against Cas’ warm and waiting body. He runs his hand through the angel’s hair, staring intently at Cas’ mouth. Dipping his head down, Dean traps Cas’ bottom lip between his own, gently sucking it into his mouth. Cas sighs as if he’d been waiting for a long time. Dean tries to start off slowly, still thinking about the wings, but Cas turns his head, opening his mouth.
believe it, until Cas explained that yes, he meant
Castiel spots a striped shore crab in the tide pools of Abalone Cove. It scuttles under a rock when the shadow of his finger passes over it as he points it out to Jack.
The sand is cooler and the waves are louder, echoing against the concrete above their heads. Dean leans against a pillar and pulls at Cas’ shirt. Dean goes to kiss him but is stopped by Cas bopping him on the nose with two fingers. He scrunches it in confusion, then he feels the heat bleed out of his face.
Dean scoffs at him. “Cas, that’s hardly fair, you’re an actual singer for an actual band.”
“Good choice,” he says when he sits back down. Dean leans against him.
Cas blinks, breaking the connection, and closes his eyes. He arches his neck slightly, and Dean hungrily traces the curving line of it. A languid smile spreads across Cas’ face as he rolls his hips forward in time with the lazy, circular rhythm of Dean’s thumbs. Dean smiles.
“Okay, actually, hold on Cas,” he giggles. “We’re gonna have to slow down because we can
Okay, that was a passable answer. For now.
“Dude.”
“Oh no, he’s not. We had a deal.”
“Sam and Dean,” she says, “this is Gabe, Anna, and Zeke.”
Castiel knows he’s done the same - gone back and played a scene out differently with only the tiniest of changes. Another sigh from his side makes him rest his head against Dean’s.
They figure out how to defeat Chuck, and they do it. The world is saved, and Jack is God.
“So do
“Hey, work,” he says as he shoves a rag into Cas’ chest. Cas poorly suppresses a chuckle.
“Ah?”
“Of course, dear, you’re highly impressive,” Cas says just a little sarcastically. Dean squeezes.
“I dropped her off at home. So I could come yell at you myself.”
Cas continues. “I have for a long time. I knew you never would, so…” He trails off, looking away again.
His cheek bounces hard on your clavicle as the tires go over a rough patch of road.
“Ah, I should have called you to look at my car, then.”
“Maybe next time. Not, uh, that I’m hopin’ you have car troubles again. Just. Yeah. You get it.”
When it’s time for bed, Jack goes to take his usual place in between Dean and Cas, but they persuade him to go for the other bed. They’re going for a night walk and don’t want to disturb him when they return. Jack just as happily settles in between Sam and Eileen, and Dean promises they won’t be long.
“I thought that might be the case. It made me think of the way people have depicted angels in art.” Cas closes the laptop, setting it down on the floor in front of him.
“Dean!” Cas has to shout over the growing distress of the man sitting in front of him. He puts a reassuring smile on his face. “It’s okay. I know.”
“Yeah. I’ll follow you anywhere.”
Dean can feel the anger radiating off the being. It’s primeval fury, and it’s all directed at Cas. Directed at Cas, but because of him. He snakes his arms around Cas in a vain attempt to protect the angel. He puts his palms to Cas’ chest, pressing Cas back against him. Cas grabs hold of one arm and squeezes in wordless thanks.
They shift as Castiel does, mirroring the slight movement of his back and shoulders as he fits himself more snugly against Dean’s chest. Cas’ breathing has almost slowed into the deep sighing of sleep, but Dean isn’t done quite yet.
But right now he’s happy with a solid arm around his shoulders. He hums contentedly.
“I have a certain appreciation for the history of the genre, yes.”
Now, Dean doesn’t know who this “Keegan” person thinks they are, but that sounds like bullshit. Like he’d ever see “cracks” in Cas, let alone after just three months. Well, maybe Cas had started to see cracks in him. That seems possible.
“Other angels have called it a weakness. They used it against me so many times, you know. You were there for some of them. The fact that I cared about humans is what made me different, but it was my love for you that made me unique. Made me
“So you’d call me an ‘angel on earth’?”
A few days go by while they wait for Castiel’s car to be out of the shop. Dean swears he’s being patient, but he catches himself before asking when they can go on a second date at least twice a day.
poetic.”
“We gotta do a couple’s costume, Cas.”
They lay there for a while, catching their breath, happy and tired and intertwined. Dean finds a shoulder and plants a chaste kiss on it, and smiles against the bare skin when he hears Castiel sigh. Eyes still closed, he sprawls one hand on the small of Cas’ back, and lifts the other to twine it through the curling hair on the back of his angel’s neck.
Dean is quiet for a moment. Castiel swears he can hear the montage of memories going through Dean’s brain. Maybe he’s thinking of all the times he could have told Cas how he felt, all the scenes that would have been different had they been together sooner. All the times he could have said “I love you.”
His efforts are rewarded when Cas almost purrs, his whole body reverberating with the small, pleased sound as he let his wings and shoulders relax under Dean’s touch. Dean chuckles happily, deep in his chest.
“Yes. I want you to…come closer,” Cas says as he sits back in the passenger seat. He runs his hands down his thighs and Dean doesn’t need any more invitation than that.
Dean laughs. “I noticed. You helped, huh?”
“I want you to do that again.”
“Yeah?”
“How could you know that if you never asked?”
He makes soft noises in his sleep, shifting slightly - for once it sounds like a good dream.
“C-cas?” Dean almost drops the beer in his hand. “Cas helped? He’s here?”
“Yeah, yeah.”
Cas points at the screen. Dean sees he had Googled “3 month anniversary” which, first off - cute, and second off - yeah. It’s the fourteenth of the month again. Wow, time goes by fast.
Dean looks up at him, his expression lighter as if a small weight had been lifted off his shoulders. Cas grabs Dean’s hands, tightly squeezing them. Dean squeezes back.
Dean sighs. “So, Cas. What do you want to do?”
, he tells himself.
Dean enthusiastically complies. He grinds down again, and the sound Cas makes compels Dean to lean back so he can watch the intricacies of Cas’ response. The pure adoration in Cas’ face takes Dean aback. He doesn’t think anyone has ever looked at him like that. He should be rewarded for it. Dean goes back in to kiss him, hands fisted in the lapels of Cas’ trench coat.
His brother catches your eye in the rearview mirror, apologetic and concerned.
dating,” she continues. “Cas is too cool for you to freak out on.”
Thanks for reading! I wrote this after the finale because I just needed to get out SOMETHING to make myself feel better. It's canon that Dean and Cas are spending eternity in heaven together. It's canon. *screams into the void* I have like 3 other ideas for how this could go down, and I might write them one day. Focusing on some AU stuff for the moment, tho.
“I know.”
He watched as life arose from the simple organic compounds found in the depths. He watched the first fish climb onto land. He watched as God flooded the world, as Moses parted the Red Sea. He watched humanity’s exploration, as well: Polynesian way finders discovering the tiniest of islands in the Pacific, the mad race to the South Pole that spanned the first few years of the 20
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean loves when Cas kisses him. It makes him feel loved, and it reminds him that he’s worth that love, too. And Castiel loves when Dean kisses him, too, of course. It floods him with relief because it shows him Dean feels the same way he does, because for so long he’d thought that wasn’t true. But it is. They love each other.
“I could get used to this.”
He waits. More clouds go by, but no familiar whoosh of Castiel’s wings.
It’s this moment that Cas decides to show up in the doorway beside Dean. “Hello, Sam,” he says, incredibly calm even in the face of his brother-in-law’s rage.
“Lovely. Text me your address. See you at seven again?”
“Cas, wait.”
“Sam,” Dean says when he can’t take it anymore.
Several hours and many snacks later, Dean hears a knock at their door. He’s about to ignore it and go back to lightly ragging on the ridiculousness of
. He gets the hint. “Thank you.”
About an hour later, Dean is manning the desk in the workshop, nose buried in a parts catalog. He’s vaguely aware of a customer walking up to stand in front of him.
He falls asleep on your shoulder.
Dean props himself up on one elbow so he can turn his body to look at the angel. He smiles softly down at Castiel.
“Please take every and any opportunity to do so,” Cas says quietly before leaning in once more.
Just as he’s about to fall asleep, he realizes he forgot to ask for Castiel’s last name.
“I can’t.”
Dean doesn’t pay the stare any mind. His focus is on how blown his angel’s pupils are, giving the normally icy blue a darker tinge. Dean can’t stop thinking of how he had helped make them like that, black with want and desire. The best part is that those eyes are for him. Cas seems to read his mind, smirking down at him suggestively, one corner of the angel’s mouth twitching up as if to say,
☼ ☼ ☼
The way they fit together made Dean sometimes wonder if they were made for each other, if they were always meant to be together. Something unbearably poetic or romantic like that. But then he thinks no, nothing about this is destiny or fate or someone’s grand design. They’d fought against that. Defeated it.
“Tell me about that,” Dean says. Cas smiles at him. Dean moves to sit up against the headboard, settling in to hear a mini-history lesson. He loved listening to Cas talk like this. Cas turns to him, still cross-legged. Dean puts his feet in Cas’ lap and Cas takes the right one, idly massaging it as he starts talking.
Dean narrows his eyes. There’s a mock seriousness to Castiel’s expression that makes Dean think,
Dean shifts next to him. “Cas?”
“Thank you,” Dean says with pride.
“Yeah! Only two weeks!”
, Cas had never actually asked him this simple question.

“You started adding wings very early on, to represent otherworldliness and flight. Angels were messengers, flying back and forth from Heaven and Earth, and since you didn’t know how we did that...wings. Although, they hardly look anything like the bird wings artists used as reference. The Bible doesn’t describe us much, and how could it? We were beyond human comprehension, really.” He switches to Dean’s left foot. “The Renaissance saw the start of angels as beautiful. The iconography quickly became ‘beautiful winged human in robes’ and didn’t change much for a long time. So I can see how being called an ‘angel’ could be a compliment, if you wish to conjure up the image of purity and beauty.”
Dean laughs. “Nah, that sounds like a blast.”
“Ah, yeah. Baby would be way too much if I tried to buy her now.”
us play?” Sam teases. Dean swats his arm.
“Interesting? That’s a new one.”
There’s a pause and out of the corner of his eye Dean sees Cas pull out his phone.
“So, Dean, he’s a looker, ain’t he?” Donna says, pointing right at the back of Castiel’s head.
Cas squeezes him harder. “I won’t.”
“Why not? I thought that was the purpose of being here now.”
Castiel takes them to a new age restaurant downtown. Before Dean gets a chance to really look over the selection of…interesting…foods, the waitress has arrived to take their order. Cas snatches both their menus and hands them to her.
And Castiel did love those stories as well. The stories humans told about space were often filled with hope, while the ocean was filled with monsters (to be fair, the Leviathan had come from the sea, and they were certainly monstrous). Most ocean tales were set on the surface anyway.
“Yeah,” Sam swoops in to save his brother, thank God. “Totally. So, you guys up for some food or do you have some stuff to finish up here?”
When his gaze reaches Dean’s face once again, he’s met with a pleased expression. Dean opens his eyes and smirks, lowering the sunglasses onto his nose.
Dean looks over at Cas and sees him deep in thought, brow furrowed slightly, searching for the words out over the granite and sandstone. Dean allows him to think it over, returning the patience Cas had showed him. He settles back in his seat and into the silence. He wouldn’t call it peaceful, exactly, but it’s calm. No villain is knocking on their door, they’re not about to save the world, they’re just here. In the Impala, at one of the Grand Canyons in heaven. There’s ample time to really choose words carefully.
♫ ♫ ♫
, but he knows Cas knows why. Sam wasn’t there to hold him back this time. He would follow Cas anywhere.
“Hello, Cas,” Dean growls.
Dean smiles lopsidedly, half prideful and half goofy. “Thank you.” He sits back, satisfied.
Dean pulls a pack of cards out of his bag and slaps it down on the coffee table. He drags the chair over to the table for Cas and sits with Sam on the floor in front of the table, Jack and Eileen taking the sofa.
Dean, under the scrutiny of Cas' gaze, shrinks a bit. He starts fidgeting with the pin, tapping his fingernails against the enamel. "Yeah. ‘Cause it’s Pride month, and there’s one not that far. I thought, y'know...you'd want to? I dunno. We don't have to go, honestly, but -"
“Technically, I’m already in ‘em.”
“Dean…”
“Hey, uh, maybe we should keep it PG, yeah?”

“H-hhyeah, yeah. I am,” Dean says when he finally composes himself. When he looks at Cas, the guy’s got the smug look on his face again. He scoots closer to Dean, if that’s even possible in this godforsaken booth.
Dean breathes out a laugh, just a sharp exhale through his nose. He turns to keep walking, using his elbow to nudge Cas along. To anyone else he would seem dismissive, but Cas can tell Dean appreciated what he’d said. He pockets the shell, thinking about where to put it in their room when they get back home.
“Dude, what the hell.” That doesn’t help.
“I meant
Dean finally gets his drink with a tiny umbrella at a very fancy beachside restaurant in Malibu.
“I want to take your fucking clothes off.”
Dean sputters. “I- what? I have never- I am the coolest person you know. At all times.” He points a serious finger at Sam.
No, he can’t have Cas say it again without saying it back. It’s the least he deserves.
“I want to touch you, Dean.”
, Dean thinks as he sits up and stretches. It’s confirmed when he hears the coffee maker beeping through the slightly open door. Dean runs a hand through his hair. It’s gotten longer lately, definitely shaggier than he’s ever let it get before. But Cas likes it. Gives him something to tug on.
It’s Wednesday before he gets the parts he needs to finish the Continental. It’s an old, unpopular car so replacements were hard to come by. He hopes the client understands the delay as he goes to find the number associated with the car. Using the company phone on the front desk, he dials the cell number belonging to a C. Novak. No one answers, so he leaves a message with the automated voicemail.
“That’s fine.”
Dean stares at him, hands still up in front of him where they’d just been holding his menu. The waitress stares for a moment too, before remembering herself. She nods silently and walks away.
“I love you, too. What’s wrong?”
“Yeah. And if I become human—”
“Baby?” Cas says with a laugh.
His brother rolls his eyes but he gets up. “What’s the point of asking ‘who
“Then we could do…something else.”
Cas finally opens his eyes. He smiles, and falls to his knees. Dean’s immediately at his side. Sam rushes over just a moment later.
That makes Dean turn his head. Immediately, he knows what Cas meant. The lights darting across the sky reflect in Cas' eyes, illuminating them for fractions of a second. Dean can't take his eyes off him. He’s beautiful. Celestial, even. Dean thinks Cas would get a laugh out of that, but he can’t bring himself to break the silence of the moment.
He waves to get Cas’ attention, and Cas jogs across the street to the Impala.
Dean is better at
He must have been tired after the long day, but he insisted on watching this movie with you.
“So, uh,” Dean turns to Gabe. “Your band name. Where’s ‘Castiel’ come from?” he asks, trying to make it less awkward.
He knows it’s not. He can feel it. He just needs Cas to say so, to validate what he’s known for a long time. Cas starts fidgeting, one hand grabbing at the seat leather between them, looking anywhere but at Dean.
It dawns on both brothers at the same time. They’re free.
“We could simply tell them we do have a room.” He keeps his hands steady on Dean’s hips.
A few members of the other band are left sitting on what looks to be a very uncomfortable old couch. They get up as Charlie approaches, and she goes to stand next to the singer. He’s probably a foot taller than her, but he slings his arm over her shoulders as she turns back to do a quick round of introductions.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs, despite the tears finally falling down his face.
“Ah. Castiel does sound like an angel name.”
I love you,” she gets up, picking up a pair of jeans from the floor, “I’m not letting you wear these. Your ass looks so flat in them, would you please just let me throw them away already?”
“Ah, we’re pretty much done,” Gabe answers him. “The others already left but we’re all good to stay out, right, Zeke, Anna?” Zeke nods and Anna gives a little salute.
Dean is just about to disagree, to bring up something about the Bible or just ask what gave Cas that idea, when he catches sight of the hickeys on Cas’ neck, and the picture is complete.
“And I’ll keep my eyes open.”
Cas backs away from him, moving his hips suggestively. Dean stutters over the rest of the verse, trying to catch up. Cas is laughing too hard to really be singing, but Dean doesn’t mind. He likes Cas’ laugh. To get him to keep laughing, Dean decides to ham it up. Cas follows his lead.
Sunlight on his face wakes Dean from a wonderful night’s rest. He opens his eyes slowly, still trying to preserve the memories of his dream. It was a good one, of that he’s sure, but the details are gone by the time he opens his eyes all the way. He turns his head, expecting Cas to be next to him in bed. He’s not. Dean puts his hand out to pat the empty space.
He makes a pained noise in the back of his throat, but it doesn’t wake him fully.
“I’ve been wanting to touch you like this all day. When appropriate, of course.”
When they reach the bunker, Sam knows what his future looks like. Dean is still shaky. Cas is still asleep.
“Hm?”
“Do you know all the names for things?” Dean asks.
Dean laughs.
“Hmm,” Cas hums before pinching a little harder.
“What?” Dean side-eyes his husband.
This would be the first time since he got it that his new handprint tattoo would be out in the sun. He swore it was completely healed - this wasn’t his first tattoo after all - but Cas insisted that Dean still moisturize it daily (it was less of a pain than it sounded, since he could usually convince Cas to do it for him which often led to other fun activities).
“I’m told it’s quite a sight to see, the unfurling and all,” Cas replies simply, idly stirring his cereal.
Nice things like someone who loves him unconditionally and without reserve. Nice things like seeing his brother finally escape the life and settle down with an awesome woman. Nice things like having a son to take care of.
Cas is kissing him.
“Don’t say that.”
A matching sparkle catches your eye from where his hand is draped over your stomach.
“Yes. When are you available?”
Cas quickly falls asleep in the backseat, no doubt tired from his sudden rescue. Sam and Dean stay silent for a while, too many thoughts racing through their heads. The possibilities are endless. They never had the chance to even think about this in seriousness before, so all the half-baked ideas and left-behind desires they’d ever had in all their years of hunting rush through their minds like a biblical flood.
Cas chuckles. "Oh? Is this proper attire for us gays?"
“It’s Shark Week,” he says.
“Yeah...yeah,” Dean agrees.
Dean swings around and is face to face with Castiel. Beautiful, wonderful,
It’s abrupt, but not unwelcome. Dean is holding on quite tightly, fistfuls of feathers in each hand. Cas wraps his arms around him, trying to soothe Dean by rubbing his back with one hand, still unsure as to what Dean is thinking about. Cas is immediately worried when he hears Dean let out a shuddering breath, so he pulls back to get a look at the hunter’s face. His cheeks are wet.
when there’s another series of knocks, much more forceful than the first.
They stand over the sink, side by side. Dean washes and Cas dries the pair of bowls and spoons, along with a few other dishes from previous days. Their arms brush often as they work.
“Good.”
“Just in the most adorable of ways.”
Cas laughs. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Busy indeed,” Donna says.
Cas chuckles. “Yes.”
Suddenly, Cas is moving, twisting himself around in Dean’s arms. When Cas stops, Dean renews his grip, holding fistfuls of trench coat as tightly as he can. Cas must be facing Dean now, but he still can’t see anything. He can feel, though. He feels hands on the sides of his face. Palms cradling his jaw. Thumbs rubbing circles into his cheeks. Fingers carding through the hair just behind his ears.
The duty-bound look is replaced with childlike excitement. “Of course!”
“Whoever you are, whatever you are -” Dean starts, but he’s cut off by what feels like cotton in his throat.
. But Cas texts him frequently, and he thinks maybe Cas is as into him as he is into Cas. The second date will definitely make that clear, so Dean enjoys what they’re doing for now.
♫ ♫ ♫
Dean looks irked, his mouth hanging open with the unfinished question. He furrows his brow and lets his hand, which was raised in excitement, fall on the table with a dissatisfied thud. Dean regains his composure to pose yet another question.
Jack waves at the brothers, turning to leave, but Dean grabs his hand. Jack looks at Dean, the picture of benevolence. Dean closes his eyes and sighs deeply before looking at this kid.
“Angelfish,” Cas says immediately.
“A bit, yeah.”
Castiel follows him further. He stops when the water reaches his Enochian tattoo, and Dean wades back towards him.
“Oh, gladly. If you leave
On their…date.
He inhales sharply, steeling himself. No point prolonging this. For confidence, he tightens his grip on the steering wheel.
“Uh.”
Cas nods, taking the shell and holding it up. “I could teach you some of it. Gould beanclam,
You couldn’t heal his wounds on the road, could only tie rough strips of cloth around his thigh, but you’ve got him now.
“Dean, I-”
In the warmth of Castiel’s embrace, Dean breathes out a sigh against the skin of the angel’s neck.
He turns his head to kiss Cas on the cheek before getting up to stand in front of everyone.
You understand.
“Quit worrying,” Cas says as he sits in Dean’s lap, tossing the shirt aside.
“I could show up in...fuckin’...THIS and be more ‘Americana’ or whatever the fuck than these jokers,” Dean says, gesturing at himself then at the computer.
Cas does it for him. He chuckles and says, "Now Dean, you're supposed to be watching the meteors."
But when Dean looks at Cas, the thought is banished from his mind. Cas looks back at him so fucking fondly. And the guy makes him coffee every time he wakes up first. Surely that’s love, right? He takes another sip and Cas just watches him, waiting for an answer. He clearly doesn’t think they’re about to have relationship problems - and screw Dean’s stupid brain for even entertaining that possibility. Cas just wants to know about the “angel on earth” thing.
The light from the forgotten television in the hotel room glints off the new piece of jewelry on your finger.
“Yeah, it’s just me and him. Mom died when I was four and Dad died a few years ago. That’s when I got the car.” Dean surprises himself. He doesn’t usually tell people this on the first date, but something about Cas’ eyes on him made him feel like it was okay to talk about anything. He almost goes on to talk about his dad, how he died while drunk driving, how he was horrible at parenting. He blames it on the song.
