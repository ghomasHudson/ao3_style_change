Mr. Percy Gable knew my name of course, but when I stated that I had met his lawyer, his face darkened.
Except, possibly, for a pair of ethereal white wings hanging behind him and a halo whose light shone down on him. I did not need to be any sort of detective to work that one out.
It was also fortunate as things turned out that my nephew had stopped sulking and come down when he did, because Sherlock was having my birthday present delivered, a Chevrolet Master (I know, a tad late, but the ship bringing the first one over had sunk and then the idiots unloading the second one at Plymouth Docks had managed to drop it from their cranes!). Hearing that throaty roar as it came along the rutted driveway was one of the best sounds of my life – excluding the ones I could still pull out of the blue-eyed genius of course. The car was black and chrome with the essential Charger monogram on the side of course and..... oh God no! No no no no no no no no
“How appropriate!” he beamed. “The first set of people to annoy me of late have been dealt with. I shall not have to have anyone else whipped, or at least not this morning.”
“On Thursday Miss Ockham visits Mr. Leeds at the works and he mentions that they have achieved a technological breakthrough”, Sherlock went on. “She knows that now is the time to strike. Doubtless like too many young bucks Mr. Leeds assumes that the technological spiel that he inflicts on his lady-friend goes clear over her head, but although she may not fully grasp the technical details, his report of the breakthrough is what causes her to set her own plans in motion. He must have previously told her – or rather boasted to her – that a breakthrough was imminent, so she was prepared.”
I reeled in horror at the ghastly taste that was filling my mouth and spluttered a mouthful of whatever the hell it was across the table, although fortunately not at John himself. My love looked up in astonishment as I bolted for our kitchen and a glass of water to rid myself of the foul poison that I had just imbibed.
Lion looked confused but I quickly found a halfpenny in my pocket and jammed it into the door-handle mechanism. No-one could gain access from the next coach now, but that still left our pursuer the option of simply waiting until the next station and stepping out onto the platform to avoid our obstruction.
We fairly bolted out of the train at Great Portland Street and were out onto the street in barely a minute. Our pursuer would be delayed by having to fight his way through the crowds so we had to make our lead tell. I almost shoved Lion into a cab and yelled the address at the driver, who set off at a fast trot.
1939. Sometimes you need a guardian angel to pull the right levers, and ensure the happiest of happy endings.
“That is sort of true”, Sherlock smiled. “I just need to see the manager of this place and explain why he has two strange men wandering around it.”
John had been reading me an article about how I was to be honoured by an electric railway locomotive of all things. The Metropolitan Railway in London had had twenty of the things† rebuilt and were naming them all, with number 8 set to be 'Sherlock Holmes'. I would be joining the likes of Cromwell, Byron, Gladstone, Disraeli, Dick Whittington and Sir Christopher Wren. Some sassy doctor had remarked that this new technology was all very well but they needed a lot of charging to get going.
1936. As Germany pushes its luck in the Rhineland, Dane Watson throws his hands up in despair at his relatives. Someone delivers rather more than a new car and John cannot believe his bad luck. Seriously, another one?
Explaining this whole saga to Lord Harry and his two elder sons was painful, but it had to be done. The nobleman sighed when I was done and looked hard at me.
“But can we not take the District to Mark Lane and then double back?” he asked looking at a map set halfway up the footbridge. “That does not look to be much further and the underground platforms at Liverpool Street are surely on different levels.”
It was one of the downsides of the railway network that the journey from York to Mazarin, though roughly the same distance as that from the northern capital to London, took considerably longer. It did not help that it was four trains rather than one; the North Eastern Railway to Newcastle and then Carlisle (taking us through Hexham which brought back memories of the surprising Mr. Fairdale Hobbs and his terrifying Leviathan), then the Glasgow & South Western Railway first to Dumfries before our final train took us into Galloway and deposited us at Mazarin Halt.
He just pulled me even closer into a.... manly embrace. Yes, that was what it was or some smirking bastard was not getting any for at least...... some time.
“Tantalus has said that he and Trey will come down tomorrow”, Sherlock smiled. “I suppose my almost-nephew sleeping with my grandson is a shade incestuous, but then there is no actual blood connection.”
I had underestimated him, for he staked his claim on me that same evening and carried me around our bedroom roaring his pleasure at his too having fucked a knight of the realm. Even if he had to have a lie down afterwards. And a nap.
“Now that you come to mention it he has”, she said. She looked across at Lady Bradstock who nodded in confirmation.
“I thought that we could drive to Oakdown Hill, and christen the back seat”, he grinned evilly. “That is the second part. If you are up to it now you are in your seventies!”
There was another wedding later in the year when John's niece Mary married another American, one Mr. Buckler Gerrard. As the wedding was being held all the way up in Helensburgh he had decided not to go, especially after his sister-in-law had sent us a warning note that the groom had such a big mouth, we might well hear it anyway!
Maybe not, I thought. Incredibly this case would need even more careful handling than I had first thought.
“The area is under the 'jurisdiction' of the unpleasant Sergeant Whitefeather”, I said, “so I can imagine that that would be a wasted journey as I know his bigotry marches in step with the rest of his unpleasant nature. I shall give this matter my most urgent attention, nephew. I need to send out some telegrams first but once they come back, I shall act. You have my word on that.”
It very nearly did. Had he not had a family to support I think that my nephew may have totally despaired of life. Stevie was just as hard hit having effectively lost his second son with Henry’s ‘Germanification’ barely a month before and now seen his eldest son cuckolded and left a widower. At least young Stephen was growing up well; his school reports were outstanding and Hetty had feared that he was so polite and well-behaved, Sherlock had had to have Swordland's look into him to make sure.
And now, instead of the sultry warmth of the Mediterranean coast, we had just alighted from a cab outside 'Rensselaer', the bed and breakfast establishment of our former landlady and her husband. Bloody Eastbourne of all places, and with a wind blowing in that seemed to have come straight from the icy Arctic! This was not the South of France!
By arranging for my half-nephew’s neighbour in his cottage to obtain a job elsewhere that he wanted, I also enabled Mr. Jukes to move in so he was just a connecting door away from his ‘Jumbo’. Who, he wrote, was Jumbo-sized in every department! It seemed that I had acquired another family member prone to oversharing!
“Then we will drop the doctor at the station here and he will get there by train while we drive”, he said firmly. “Hopefully one or the other of us will reach him in time!”
The same month of my loss saw a general election in which the Conservatives remained the largest party but lost seats to both the Liberals and the then still new Labour Party. Stanley Baldwin was out and for the first time ever there was a Labour government albeit propped up by the Liberals, with Ramsay Macdonald as the prime minister. The new political force had promised much and it remained to be seen if they could deliver.
I decided that I wished to give my grandson the good news myself that evening even if it meant a night in Wiltshire before we could return to our cottage and all that long-delayed sex (I defined it as long-delayed because). It also meant that we could travel back down on the same train as the soon to be ex-Mrs. Hawke and make sure she did keep to her side of the bargain, which luckily for her she did. I was sure that she had all sorts of jewellery and expensive things in her bag which she ordered to be taken out to her carriage, and fortunately she did not check and therefore spot the identical one that I had had the servants substitute for it. If she wanted to carry pieces of an old brick wrapped in dirty sheets all the way to London, let her.
Ye Gods he was not wearing any underwear! That was just unfair! I was going to die before I had my cottage!
“I do not have all the details of the case”, he said. “That is for the lawyers. But I believe it all comes down to the fact that a rival factory produced something identical to what they were working on, and they believe that he leaked some plans to them.”
We had to open a gate to enter the farm buildings themselves and the obscenely loud creak must have drawn the attention of the occupants of that building. Three gentlemen came out and even the worst consulting detective in the world could have worked out who was who. Mr. Drake Hale was a larger, older and broader version of his son Derek who was skulking behind him; the sergeant-major had not understated just how hirsute both men were. Mr. Scott McCall was similar in build to his friend and if anything even more slender, as well as considerably less hairy. He was however rather regrettably possessed of what was presumably meant to have been a moustache, but we all make mistakes when young. Even ones as bad as that!
“Then I suggest that you slowly reduce the dose to zero over that time by mixing in more and more normal mushrooms”, I said, silently thinking that I was somewhat stretching my maxim of 'first do no harm'. Then again, a sudden withdrawal of the 'poisons' could indeed be more dangerous than a clean break, and I was sure that Mrs. Malone and Mr. Malone would thank me for the continued peace and quiet. “That way, her body will be able to more easily adapt to the lack of suppressant and there should still be enough in her system to ensure... er.....”
Before quitting Baker Street we had made sure that only a few trusted friends and family knew of our new cottage's address. So when that September morning I heard the sound of someone knocking at the door and a familiar voice outside calling us I should not perhaps have been surprised – except if that was who I thought it was, he should have been well over a thousand miles away! Staggering to the window and peering out, I saw that it was indeed him.
I sighed as I stared out across the Downs. It was good to get away from the house for a while, and on this warm summer's day there were several families enjoying picnics on the hills overlooking the town below. Down there life went on normally – but for how much longer?
Of course I did, even if Mr. Tantalus Holmes was strictly speaking not even Sherlock's nephew let alone mine. Ostensibly the son of Sherlock's obnoxious eldest brother Mycroft he was in fact one of many offspring of the prodigious – all right, randy as hell Prince (now King) Tane of Strafford Island, whose state visit to Great Britain some decades back had left me exhausted while trying to keep tabs on the dog and many ladies in London society with more than a little explaining to do nine months down the line. The belated realization of how he had been cuckolded had been the last straw in the long overdue collapse of Mr. Mycroft Holmes's marriage, and I had been worried at the time that Sherlock's eldest brother might find some way to try to get back at us over it, since of course we were to blame for all
The look on the actor's face was one of complete confoundment. He squeezed the trigger once again but only succeeded in creating more multicoloured confetti. Seeing policemen advancing from one side of the stage – I recognized our friend Chief-Inspector Baldur at their head – the actor ran quickly over to the trapdoor (the pillar had been removed at this point in the performance so I could see where he was going) and stood on it.
“Lieutenant Anderson may be annoyed at what we have discovered but I hope that I can make him see that it is all for the best”, he said. “I fear however that it will not be easy. He has acted in what he sees as just cause, with some reason in his case, so it may be hard to persuade him otherwise.”
I sniggered. Wait until I showed him around and he saw all the other pairs! After all, what were young relatives for other than to be traumatized by their elders?
“Your brother needs time to heal”, Mr. Holmes said. “I believe that there is a sanatorium close in Chipping Ongar?”
“You interviewed that damn landlady in no underwear and with a plug in you?” I marvelled. “You, Sherlock Holmes, are a pervert!”
“One of the first ladies that I, uh, attended to had a son that she named Khalid”, our visitor explained. “One of over twenty of the things; they do not do originality when it comes to naming boys there! He was born back in 1902; unfortunately for that part of the world he recently decided to marry a Jewess. They chose to leave and to come to England; Cal did say that he would stand by them but they thought it for the best.”
The huge form of Benji shook as he sobbed in my arms. He was seventy years old now but still a fine figure of a man, although he looked a wreck.
“One child exhausted me”, Mrs. Rockland sighed. “Having six of the little blighters here at once…. It makes me really feel my age.”
“Mr. Johannus St. Cloud Invincible Tripolitania Solomon Major, so he clearly had cruel parents!” the sergeant grinned. “Fifty-eight, been with the company since forever and rumour is that they were thinking of moving or forcibly retiring him. Bit of a bully in my opinion; in fact a lot of one if I am being honest. He clearly dislikes Mr. Leeds, but now that the rival place up in Derby has produced a decent vehicle he himself may get the sack or they may even close down the department here. So not that much of a motive. He said that he was at home all Saturday evening and Sunday morning; his wife backed that up but she is scared witless of him so that means little.”
“To be honest sir, I do not quite trust that French plane”, he admitted, “although that may be just because I do not trust the French, full stop!  When the call went round for pilots over fifty men applied, so I knew that with my limited flight time I had no chance. But I enjoy managing this end of things, and my family is involved with our Nation's attempt to design and produce something that will fly the Frogs out of our skies.”
“I did bring a few of our playthings down from London just in case you felt in the mood”, I said casually, “but maybe some quiet time would suit us just now. Besides, if the weather is really good then Day and I can go.....”
I was more than a little suspicious when, only moments after my love had been called out to one of the 'boys' at Mr. Godfreyson's molly-house, John's least favourite Cornish ex-fisherman chanced to call by. Lowen clearly saw my cynicism and nodded as he sat down.
Gwen falling about laughing was no help either. I sighed; even in death those two rapscallions were a total embarrassment!
I was disappointed because this was one of our favourite spots for Sherlock to paint, for me to watch him until he looked at me, smiled that smile and..... well, what else were roadside barns for?
Unfortunately, as with many families it was to be the aftermath that proved almost as devastating to our circle. That summer had seen a particularly virulent global influenza, what would later become known as the Spanish Flu (rather unfairly so called because the war had led to a ban on reporting its effects everywhere except neutral Spain). This terrible disease had struck a weakened population just as victory had seemed in sight, and persisted throughout this year afflicting the young and the young adult populations particularly hard. Sherlock's grandson Trelawney saw both the children from his first marriage, succumb; naturally their mother who we had encountered just before the start of the war had abandoned them once she had realized that there was no money to be made out of them, and he had had them brought up by friends of his.
“I am going to investigate the matter of this photograph, Miss Woodhouse”, he said eventually. “Something about it feels wrong and I would like to know the truth, if only to satisfy my own curiosity. I shall of course keep both you and Miss Radley-Barnham fully informed of any developments, but in all fairness I must warn you as I warned her that it may be that Lieutenant Anderson was indeed speaking the truth when he said his colleague had died.”
1933. In a year of departures and sadness all round, Sherlock helps a prodigious friend come to terms with a loss.
intelligence this landlady quickly puts two and two together, and realizes that one of the properties of the mushrooms that she has picked must be to bring about a calm tranquillity among those who eat them.”
Much as with my lost nephew, sometimes a death in the family has surprisingly little effect on people. Sherlock had warned me that the government was closing in on the treacherous Mr. Bevill Holmes, bastard son of a certain utterly unmissed brother of my friend, and with the tide beginning to turn the lounge-lizard's spawn had made a run for his paymasters only to be caught even before he had made it out of London. He would face a fitting end in the Tower, where he would be missed by very few.
“Not as such”, I smiled. “You will have to yield your comfortable position to see what I think is here, though.”
They were clearly still struggling with this. Particularly poor Mr. Bassett-Evans, who even more than Mr. Jukes looked like he might need John's professional services quite soon.
The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. The 'Great War' was finally over. I sighed as I half-dozed with my man in my arms and thought of all those young lives wasted just because the vile Kaiser Bill, fled into exile in the Netherlands the previous day like the coward that he was, had wanted even more land for Germany. Never again.
There were two happenings in the short period between All Hallow's Day and Guy Fawkes's Night that year, one good and one bad. First the good which involved my dear friend Benji, or as John called him 'that leering fellow who came over far too often'. Benji was certainly prodigious; in the autumn of the previous year his wife Bertha had given birth to twin girls (Sarah and Jane) and now she was pregnant again with what would be their twentieth (and, as it turned out almost certainly to her relief, last) child. I knew that Luke had helped the family financially especially after he had become godson to 'Luke The Second' (number sixteen) three years back. I had helped Benji's eldest son and namesake get onto the teaching course that he had been after and his second boy William was now applying to join the Army. John of course had provided free medical treatment to them all and that particular day he was called round to Bertha who had gone into labour some two weeks before her due day. Fortunately he was able to safely deliver her of a son whom they called Stafford (Bertha's mother's maiden name) although I know that the fight to save both mother and child took a lot out of my love.
“Unhappily we have a connection”, he said. “My Aunt Brunnhilda – and yes, she really is like her name! – married a Welsh corporal called Huwel Jones and they had several children including a son, my cousin Bryn.”
Once at the theatre we were introduced to a Mr. William Benson, the director of this absolute, unmitigated travesty of a play. He was awestruck at our appearance and wanted to introduce us to all the cast but luckily Sherlock dissuaded him. I say luckily because I had brought my gun and
This decade started well enough with my nephew Jack's second marriage yielding a son whom they named Dane after Antonia's father Mr. Dean Belvedere. It was also a time when things were being seen in a new light, although some things stayed stubbornly the same. Including, worse luck, the not-smirk from the blue-eyed genius next to me who was not getting laid any time soon.
“Bad memories”, he said ruefully. “My father did but one thing right in his miserable existence when he married my mother, who was English or at least Scottish. People just think it is that blood resurfacing, and given how terrible he was at the end it is not a subject that many would wish to dwell on, especially as people know that I do not like it. Do you remember meeting Bill and Ben when you came to Rigsby?”
Sherlock said. “Seeing her approaching, Mr. Dallas naturally stood still and waited, and that gave Mr. Heston the time he needed to fix his sights and to deliver the fateful shot. But they were well aware that that alone would have caused suspicion to fall upon Mr. Heston as a skilled shooter, so they propped the dead man up against the scarecrow and Mr. Heston fired a bullet into him at close range. That, they knew, would throw suspicion upon Mr. Creighton Dallas as one of the few people his brother would have let get close to him.”
Don't get me wrong; I don't begrudge the old man his happiness especially at his age. But that he retired and moved into the same house as Tobias Gregson of all people? Worse, the two of them almost in each other's laps as they sat there? It's bad enough without having to put up with Gregson's whelp of the same name who, and Lord alone knows how, also made sergeant this year. They chose me first of course, but then decided to scrape the bottom right off the bloody barrel for the second post that came up. I can only guess the station cat turned them down.
“That has to be one of the most elaborate set-ups in the history of set-ups”, I said later as I sat with Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson. “It is even in the 'Times' as to how the brave English Lion saved his brother's life.”
The reason for my annoyance was that a certain consulting detective, one who was not getting laid (and that included doing any laying) any time soon, had gone and lied to me. Well, not exactly lied but certainly been more than a little economical with the truth. When he had asked me how I had felt about a visit to Marseilles I had pictured a lovely spring break in the south of France, Sherlock in a swimming costume, sandy beaches, Sherlock in a swimming costume, fine wines, Sherlock in a swimming costume, good food, Sherlock out of a swimming costume..... a whole load of things. It was fortunate that I did not have a one-track mind, really.
“What are you doing to do, Sherlock?” my brother scoffed. “You cannot keep this fellow here forever. You yourself will be out in six months.”
“Then, and only then, it becomes highly infectious”, Sherlock said. “In terms of fatalities it is not far behind the terrible Black Death. Fortunately it only tends to spread to others once that period is elapsed.” He looked around the office before adding ominously,
“It is just a possible solution”, Sherlock said. “As is my other one. But I think you will like that rather less. Very well.”
“Coffee with the caffeine taken out”, he said calmly. “A new process; they found it quite by chance. Did you not like it?”
This was the year that old age pensions first started to be paid and if anyone so much as smirks in this vicinity then..... there may well be Pouting! As well as that achievement there was one and nearly two more; explorer Robert Peary conquered the North Pole while Ernest Shackleton was forced to turn back having got to within barely a hundred miles of the other end of the planet. I could have remarked that the temperatures at either extremity were likely as cold as Sherlock's feet of a morning, but I knew full well that such a quip would have had Severe Consequences.
A gentleman of about thirty years of age was announced and I could feel John's horror at his appearance. Some ten years younger than his illustrious brother but unmistakably of the same blood, up to and including the look he gave me that had 'someone' visibly uneasy in seconds. Prince Pale of Strafford Island, younger brother of the King Tane who had given poor John such a runaround back in 1882 and fathered a number of offspring during his brief stay here including my 'nephew' Tantalus.
“Thank you, Ginger”, I said. “I will look into this – once I have helped poor John back to the land of the living.”
Of course I did. The psychic cult-leader, the man who had saved my and Sherlock's lives many a time. Sometimes one could not make my life up; I doubted that even Sherlock's mother could....
“I learned that from Mr. West, Mr. Galahad LeStrade's friend”, I teased, enjoying the fact that even John's scowling evidently took a lot of effort. “With what he gets to deal with on a nightly basis, he has to call on all his Latin inventiveness.”
Sherlock led the way across the corridor and into a large well-lit room where about a dozen people were gathered round a dais which had a large and very solid pole stretching all the way up to the ceiling. They were clearly setting up to draw something or possibly someone as there was some sort of post for someone to lean on, and I watched with interest. None of the gentlemen however looked anything like what I expected Mr. Galahad LeStrade to now look like after eight years.
I stared around in disbelief; the whole thing had an air of unreality about it. It looked as if we had been gone for ten minutes, not ten years. Everything was exactly the way we had left it back in 1904 with not a speck of dust on what were clearly copies of some of our favourite possessions, with even a copy of the famous fireside chair that I knew was safely back in our beloved cottage. Besides me, Sherlock chuckled.
“A passable stick called Jones”, he said. “But he was shilly-shallying around on the frankly pathetic of excuse of getting a cast put on his broken leg, which is a damn poor show if you ask me.”
He looked at me in confusion but rose to his feet, although he elicited another fierce blush from my half-nephew when he kissed him as he pulled him to his feet. I noted that the larger man still stuck close to him as he handed me the keys. Some men were so whipped!
“He is a good man and does not deserve this”, I sighed, thinking that families really had a lot to answer for at times. “Poor Sherlock. He has got used to things as they are and now a whole new set of complications.”
I had been in the middle of enjoying a well-written rant in the local newspaper about the government’s clamping down on those 'automobile' death-traps – officially-sanctioned number-plates and a twenty miles per hour speed limit both of which seemed fair enough to me – when the Reverend Reuben Carroll arrived. He was a small nondescript fellow of about fifty years of age, clearly quite nervous but also very determined.
I sighed unhappily. Three years ago my nephew and Stevie's eldest Jack had married one Miss Emma-Jane Garvett whom Sherlock had immediately categorized as a ‘First-Class With Honours Complete Airhead’, an appellation with which I had soon been forced to agree (even the saintly Hetty had confided to us her opinion that if we stood close enough to her daughter-in-law we could probably hear the sea!). It had soon become clear that Emma-Jane and her husband were ill-matched and that she would and did flirt (and sleep) with just about any available male. She had even succeeded in wrangling an introduction to our lecherous late king which had only been scuppered when that monarch had shuffled off this mortal coil just days before she had been due to meet him. He had been lucky so to do!
“Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson”, he said gruffly. “What brings you to our neck of the woods, may I ask? I do hope you have not found any dead bodies lying around Oxfordshire.”
“Mr. George Berthold Samuelson”, I said. “He has approached our publishers Brett, Burke & Hardwicke, asking if he can buy the rights to one and maybe more of our stories.”
“There is a treatment”, Sherlock said, “but as so often with medicine these days there is also a problem. Like the Black Death this disease has two forms, in this case a severe one and a mild one. The application of the wrong treatment to a person could even kill them. We desperately need to track down this fellow and find out which strain he has.”
“I dropped my washing in at her cottage when we passed on the way here”, he whispered back. “I also told her that we would not need her for at least a week and would let her know when to bring it back. Of course I paid her anyway.”
Even two hundred miles away, someone remained a bad influence on me. An influence I missed more and more each passing day.
There is a lot of nonsense written about Victorians today, and even though we were now technically Edwardians the country had not changed much. Looking back from beyond the Great War (and before what looks like being a second such nightmare 'courtesy' of the vile Herr Hitler) many people today think that we were far too prudish, always sour-faced and prone to moralizing. It is true that society had a higher moral code in those days – and was all the better for it, in my humble opinion – but people were a lot more tolerant that some modern writers like to claim. I have no doubt that the villagers among whom we now lived very quickly came to know exactly what sort of relationship we had, yet there were no cross words or raised eyebrows. Truly most people really did not mind what other people did, provided they did it quietly and did not talk about it. The modern habit for openly flaunting one's private life is I feel quite vulgar.
The play finished with two of the thieves captured and one having escaped, the latter breaking into the room in which our young selves were staying, to try to kill young Sherlock Holmes in revenge. Of course bumbling young John Watson inadvertently helped save the day by completely misreading the situation but allowing Sherlock time to get his pistol from a drawer and hold the attacker at gunpoint until the police arrived a few moments later. The closing lines were Sherlock thanking me for saving his life and me not having a clue what had been going on, which was par for my evening-long humiliation. Not even close to reality.
It was St. David's Day of our last year in London, and the daffodils were in bloom for what would be our last spring in Baker Street. I had for once been alone on my walk, Sherlock having had to go and visit his family (poor fellow!) and had returned expecting to find him in the inevitable foul mood that he so often was after such encounters. I may or may not have been looking forward to him working off his anger on me but that was beside the point.
“It made for a fitting last case”, my friend said as we returned to Baker Street for the last time. “Our final adventure together, and the murderer? Mr. Sherlock Holmes!”
I had hoped that we might have been able to use this trip back to Bernicia to enable John to call in on his brother Stephen, but unfortunately the latter had gone to Amsterdam as part of a major case that he was working on and had taken his family with him. So it was just the two of us on the sea-front at Bamburgh, the town near Belford where we had arranged to meet my half-nephew who as well as working on the North Eastern Railway played for the rugby team here.
At the end of November the House of Lords rejected the controversial People's Budget, paving the way for a general election the following year. Our cottage in Sussex seemed ever more a haven from such political shenanigans.
The experimental air-service was being flown by a number of pilots, some of them quite famous (not that I would have recognized any of them). Luke's notes (his handwriting was terrible and even without the unhelpful illustrations in the margin I could all too well imagine what Benji had been doing to him when he had been writing, the horny bastard!). My cousin suggested that I might look closely at Mr. Henry Battenberg†, a distant cousin of the Royal Family who was quite a good pilot but, Luke thought, a shade too pro-German especially given the current political climate.
“Two actor friends of mine”, I grinned. “Mr. Hebden was particularly obliging in supplying me details of Lord Trelawney's favourite coat which, fortunately, is quite distinctive.”
“Like you I found surviving without the man I love very painful”, he said. “I barely slept at all during the Scottish trip without you there. So I took a bottle of your cologne in this bottle to London with me. I doused the sheets with it at night just so I could get some sleep. It worked a little but I still missed you terribly.”
I was also, rather foolishly, worried about Sherlock being on a train. I knew that he would not go through Grantham (scene of the second of three inexplicable rail crashes around that unfortunate time), his route being out of Euston rather than King's Cross but I could not shake the fear that something would happen while we were apart. I scanned the papers anxiously the next day for any news of such a calamity and I loved him even more for sending me telegrams first from Glasgow and then from Oban to say that he was tired and footsore (and un-caffeinated, God help those around him!) but that he had made the ferry to Lismore.
As it happened St. James's Church was the scene of our next little local adventure. A tiny building that was Saxon in parts, the vicar had long cherished hopes of extending it but it had a graveyard that curved around it on three sides so that left only the land on the north side. Unfortunately said land was owned by the one person that the village could well have done without, Miss Virginia Hastings-Ryland (the only woman in the place not to have simpered at Sherlock, which I suppose proves that miracles do happen!). Her family had once owned the manor house that had lain between the village and neighbouring Alciston, but bad investments and poor judgement had combined to force them to sell up and move elsewhere – except for the one family member that, unfortunately but understandably, they had left behind (sadly not under the ruins of their former home!). Mr. Torrin, the owner of The Majestic Duck and a gentleman of some consequence in the village had tried to buy her field for the church, but the unpleasant Miss Hastings-Ryland had refused to sell.
Just days after Ivan's return my emotions were still frazzled by the whole affair, so I was in little state to receive the news that reached us the day after New Year’s Day. On the little regarded southern front the Central Powers had recently won a great victory at Caporetto†, driving the Italians back some distance. Of course any information from so far away, let alone it being a war zone, was bound to take time to reach us but then bad news always travels fast.
“We shall inform Mr. Delaware that we are fortunately on a return trip to Great Britain”, Sherlock said firmly, “and would welcome the chance to discuss the case with him at his earliest convenience. He can contact us through Baker Street.”
“Dear Mrs. Zeuson wrote to me from Suffolk”, I told him. “Apparently someone has been campaigning covertly against a friend of hers, a Doctor Anderson†, who wishes to become mayor of her home town. That someone, she has found out, is
“I shall definitely make some inquiries”, I covered. “Are you holding any training sessions before the match, may I ask?”
1924. Sherlock and John cope with technology through dance and, ahem, 'other methods' (hint: Sherlock and John). Meanwhile a new arrival needs help to sidestep some bucolic bigotry.
Luckily Ned immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Holmes – that surprised me as I knew he'd retired with Doctor Watson and I was sure I'd read somewhere that they'd gone Abroad – but sure enough, a few days later three men who were even bigger than me called at Bowen's cottage. I couldn't catch what they said but he put in for and was immediately given a transfer down to Newcastle, and the village was better off for his going.
“I do hope that neither you nor anyone in authority is unwise enough to try to circumvent my plans, Randall”, I said. “You may inform your political masters that my displeasure would start with the cabinet minister whose wife makes rather irregular use of his valet....”
Born in 1648 she became a mistress of King Charles the Second in 1667, around the time that she married her third cousin the rich Martin Hawke. As her father had had only daughters she was granted the right to inherit, but held the title for less than a year before dying in childbirth. She had no children from her marriage (unless her husband had somehow gotten her pregnant despite being permanently posted overseas!) so the king ensured that his and her son Stephen inherited the title. The Merry Monarch had two other bastard sons of importance; Charles D'Arcy was the ancestor of Sergeant Baldur D'Arcy in the stories, while Henry Earl of Grafton descends to Lady Diana Spencer, wife of Prince Charles and mother of Prince William. Jane's royal connections meant that Sherlock was actually Queen Victoria's seventh cousin twice removed, although because of the illegitimacy factor he had no claim to the throne.
“I would like to ask you about a certain lady called Mrs. Bollinger”, I said. “I understand that she is visiting your grandfather then
I thought that with what little was left of my mind as he thrust into me, tears running down his handsome face.
“Carl is sixty-two years old so deserves some peace and quiet”, I said. “He cannot have that if you are going to make fun of the fact that he pulled a muscle trying to keep up with a lover still in his thirties.”
“I do not see the point of these beach-houses”, I complained as we walked past the gaily-coloured doors. “There does not seem to be enough room inside to swing a cat.”
“He is taking over from me and my Italian stallions when we head off to Cornubia”, my least favourite Cornish ex-fisherman said with a leer in my direction. “It takes a firm hand to manage all those
I suppose it was my own damn stupid fault. I'd gone round to see Mr. Sherlock Holmes to talk to him about the Quainton Street Robbery – broad daylight, dammit! –  only to find that my own father was calling as well. I'd known he was due in London soon and I should've remembered; today was one of Mrs. Rockland's baking days.
Of course my beloved John, who had little enough reason to like Randall, played the peacemaker and with the help of my dear sister effected at least a temporary reconciliation. I grudgingly agreed that I would stay in London until the twenty-first but not a day longer, and if the case dragged on beyond that date it could become someone else’s problem. I knew that John had wanted to spend at least two weeks before the holy day in the North so I pressed him to go ahead as planned, assuring him that nothing would keep me from leaving on the twenty-second and being with him in York three days before Christmas. We had a sorrowful parting on the twelfth and I returned to a cold and empty Baker Street, knowing that it would be ten long days before I would see him again.
Bless him, Sherlock had even had my personal monogram, the letter 'W' stylized as an electric charge, engraved on both the doors. The back seats were however quite narrow, and it was fortunate that even at sixty-seven my love was as flexible as ever. We christened not only the back seats but the front ones and, in a feat which left me needing a long lie down afterwards, both at the same time!
1904. Sherlock rides to the rescue of yet another family member, this time up in his beloved John's native Northumberland. His new half-nephew, a rugby player, is concerned that some of his opponents have broken the unofficial rules of good sportsmanship - and he already has an idea as to why.
My love had purchased an honest-to-goodness picnic set, complete with a gingham blanket that we were resting on. He had however insisted on buying as much food as possible from the village.
“Why?” the grub asked looking confusedly around the room before I pointedly lifted the tea-cosy and pulled out his precious barley-sugars from the 'perfectly safe place' that he had left them in.
A couple of weeks later we went to London to meet up with an old friend, Chief-inspector Chatton Smith. He had come to London as part of his recent promotion which had been partly brought about by his solving a particularly sensitive case involving several important people in Cumberland, all of whom were now marking the festive season from behind bars. We met him at my favourite restaurant in Trafalgar Square – their chocolate cake was even better than I had remembered – and Sherlock asked after Mr. Smith's lover Mr. Macdonald.
“Lord alone knows”, Mr. Malone said. “Pete Sunderland, the local constable, told me that the man was definitely not drunk – with the people in this place, he would surely have known! – and it was sheer good luck that he went off the land end and into one of those beach-tent thingies. Injured but he is all right; the poor lady who was halfway through changing when he 'dropped in' probably suffered more as she sprained her ankle making a run for it! The strange thing was Pete said that he had most of the symptoms of being drunk except for his breath, which was clear.”
(and likely to Mrs. LeStrade's relief, their last) child, a son who had been named Beaumont. The boy's father was seemingly bent on repopulating eastern Westmorland in person!
“That was so horrible!” he declared. “I do not care what friend or family member calls next time, I am
“You really should mind your manners, especially in your position”, the sheikh said. “My sausages were marginally undercooked at breakfast this morning, so as well as having my cook whipped I might decide to further make up for that annoyance by having you both killed. Or worse.”
“She is still married to Mr. Simpson”, Sherlock said as he passed me one of the new Aero chocolate bars (it was a year for that sort of thing and luckily I had liked both them and the crunchy KitKat bars, although neither seemed to keep particularly well). “Worse, she seems to share the Prince of Wales's political views as regards the insane Herr Hitler. I know from my contacts that the government is very worried about the relationship; I doubt that they would allow her to rule alongside him.”
That was not the sport's only loss; the Alnwick team had also lost their coach after some thugs had beaten him up and he had decided to quit the game as a result. John had looked at me suspiciously (and rightly so) when I had told him, but as our three new friends were just coming into the room which they comprehensively filled, he could not remark on the subject.
“I only came round to tell you both that Anne is expecting again”, he grumbled. “Then I walk in to find this”!”
“Because he wanted to fly the plane into the king's garden-party”, the boy said, as if it were somehow obvious. “He is a German agent, after all.”
“He is adamant that they remained locked in the office”, the lawyer said, “although of course that does not preclude copies having been made. Four days later the rival establishment in Derby produced a test vehicle with the exact same improvement that Mr. Leeds had been working on. I am afraid that there is still more. When the police searched his house they found not only a return railway ticket from Wellingborough to Derby for Sunday morning, clipped, but five hundred pounds† in cash.”
If I had thought the welcome-home sex after our first separation had been good, what followed in the next week was astounding. It was as if Sherlock had been denied sex for an entire decade, not just a few days, and was determined to make up for lost time. Usually at times like this he preferred to take the lead but this time he seemed determine to even things out, happy both when pounding me into the mattress or riding me into a semi-comatose state. I suppose we must have eaten and whatnot but all I can remember for that week was Sherlock wanting (and of course getting) sex every time he was awake. By the end of it I wondered if I might have to order a bath-chair as I could barely walk!
I scowled (it was so not a pout) and took the keys off of him, easing myself behind the wheel and breathing in the gorgeous smell of new leather and Sherlock. God but I was one lucky man at times!
“You are truly a man of the world”, I told my nephew, “so I am going to be honest with you. It is a complex situation overall but when I was much younger I had a brief affair in which the woman involved later had a daughter, and decided not to inform me of that fact. That daughter grew up and married Lord Harry Hawke, so Trey as you call him is indeed my grandson. As you doubtless also know my grandson's wife is of a sufficiently questionable character that we cannot be sure of any of her children are his. I doubt that their marriage is long for this world anyway, but...”
“I think twice is enough for one night, John”, he said, edging backwards. “I had better leave you with that inside you so you can recover....”
Two years before the events I am about to describe took place, there was a milestone in human achievement which, while estimable in itself, shook our Nation greatly. Frenchman Louis Blériot made the first powered flight across the English Channel, and the 'Times' put it well when they remarked that England was no longer an island, and that for Britannia's safety she would in future have to rule the skies as well as the waves. Early aeroplanes were flimsy things and accidents were commonplace, but one only had to look at the contrast between the likes of Stephenson's 'Rocket', bowling along the tracks at a top speed of thirty miles an hour with a few open-topped 'coaches' against the express locomotives of less than a century later which could haul far heavier trains at over three times that speed. Better aeroplanes would surely come and soon – then what?
The actor playing Doctor Watson not only looked nothing like me – his taste in clothes was terrible – but the character was
“So now he is ruined?” I mused. I had always hated Mycroft Holmes for his attitude towards Sherlock and myself, the most hostile in the family after the late and unlamented Torver. “He is reaping what he has sowed.”
“When the diva doctor has finished bowing to the assembled throng”, a voice came from right next to my ear, “we might perchance leave.”
1910. Edwardian frolics give way to Georgian gravity, but the political situation continues to be a mess. There is a flood of perhaps not Biblical although still noteworthy proportions, a murderer flees but gets caught, and John has to 'talk' Sherlock our of a bad idea.
→→1.16.1: Nick (1927-2006), lover of Sherlock Watson, John's great-grandson; they lived in 'Elementary'.
I saw his point at once. That sort of thing was bound to become public knowledge if Miss Hallows actually married Lord Hawke, and it would mean his brother – and worse, the excuse for a female that he was currently married to – the next in line. Of course being a twin the odds on his ever getting the title were at best fifty-fifty, but it had to be considered. John had also explained to me that the disease that the Hawke boys had suffered from some years back and which had exposed my real connection to them would make their having healthy children less likely, although not impossible.
“Of course you must do it, dear”, she said firmly. “He is your brother after all. Besides, you have always enjoyed being a drama queen.”
“This meant of course that virtually the entire estate devolved upon Mr. Troilus.” The lawyer polished his glasses again and frowned. “I do not wish to speak ill of any person but he is.... rather an unsavoury character. He married poorly, a rich lady of what is most politely described as 'questionable character', and they have their own house in Edgeware. They have three daughters which I privately think Mr. Gable considers a disappointment although he has never said as much. Mr. Troilus rarely if ever visited his father – that was until Mrs. Ophelia Bollinger appeared on the scene.”
“A boy but, I am sorry to say, a criminal mastermind in the making”, I said firmly. “It seemed that both his uncle and cousins stood between him and a massive inheritance – but following the tragic loss of your son Aeneas he knew that you would prefer to leave your money to a male heir and a Gable, and also of your interest in the supernatural which he decided to play on.”
I understood now, but I still did not like it and pressed close to the human heater next to me who... manfully embraced me. Thankfully after only a few minutes (although it seemed longer) the process was repeated in reverse, the dawn light shooting overhead to lighten our skies once more.
“We are going to need to call in the services of Randall on this”, Sherlock said once we were in the cab headed back to Baker Street, his not-smirk as annoying as ever. “I need to see that photograph in order to make any progress and I feel sure that Lieutenant Anderson would not co-operate if approached.”
“I cannot of course divulge any details about the Very Important Case that I am undertaking”, Sherlock said loftily. “However a description of a person who was at the scene of a crime matches some seven people, and your employee Mr. Galahad LeStrade is one of them. Naturally as he is an employee of this noble establishment I wished to eliminate him from my enquiries as soon as possible, so all I need are his regular hours of employment and whether those have varied at all of late.”
1920. John is annoyed because 'someone' keeps almost saying That Word That Starts With The Third Letter Of The Alphabet And Rhymes With Huddling – but at least Sherlock makes sure that he will be ready for life on the road.
You wait all day for a 'bus, they say, then two come along at once. Such it was with our last two cases which came almost on top of each other as the Continent finally tumbled over the brink into war, courtesy once more of the Hun. These two cases could hardly have been more different; the first was a family matter although important for those involved (and for me as it was my family), while the second could well have affected the course of the forthcoming war.
, and the boy had come to see us afterwards grousing that his stepfather smirked far, far too much. I agreed; as I told my love, smirking was really an annoying thing.
“I am getting too old for this!” he groaned, sitting down very slowly on the chair across from me. I called a waiter over and ordered him his breakfast, then poured him a coffee as he looked incapable of managing that great task for himself. He yawned far too adorably, and had there not been bacon in the immediate vicinity then that would have had Immediate Consequences.
It had been Miss St. Leger’s ever watchful guard on my various relatives nearly all of whom did not know of their connection to someone so illustrious yet so modest (I said as much to John on the odd occasion, and he always coughed for some strange reason) which had led us back to my love’s native Northumberland. My half-nephew Mr. Brencis Bassett-Evans had been concerned over a team-mate at his rugby club, the scrum-half Mr. Edward 'Ned' Jukes, who he had suspected of lusting after one or other of the team’s handsome props. Except that it had turned out to be the hooker, Mr. Bassett-Evans himself, who had been the target of Mr. Jukes’s affections. I had arranged things such that the truth came out, and had received a very shakily-written letter from my half-nephew thanking me, followed by another a month later when I had been able to arrange for Mr. Jukes to obtain the cottage right next to that of my relative. He had not needed to mention as to how he was unable to sit down most days, though. Few men were
“The only 'casualty' was the carpet outside, victim of rather too much fake blood”, Doctor Watson grinned. “We shall be owing Mrs. Rockland a box of apology chocolates for that.”
It was the day after we had gained yet another family member, with Tantalus's son Carl having had a fourth child, a daughter whom he was going to call Elizabeth after his wife's middle name. Sherlock had said that he had a surprise for me outside, but that it would not be ready for some twenty-four hours. And no amount of pouting would get him to let me have it earlier.
“It seems obvious enough”, he said to the evident surprise of all of us. “I assume that Mrs. Start is a person of small build, as is the suddenly accident-prone Mr. Spencer?”
“There was once a parliament held at Acton Burnell, which is not far from here”, John said. “In the thirteenth century, when parliaments could be held wherever the king was rather than always in London.”
Finally we reached the particular day for which Mr. Holmes had our great adventure planned. I had told Lion the day before that I would be able to spend longer with him today as Sarah's parents were visiting and the chance to miss her mother's braying laugh which sounded like a group of donkeys undergoing a mass castration was too good to pass up (I would be buying my wife a large box of chocolates
Sunday passed painfully slowly but at least there were no developments in the case that I had agreed to wait for. But I found myself growing increasingly impatient; I was packed by mid-day and was restless all the way through to bedtime. Where I slept in my cold, empty bed.
An efficient but pernickety clerk who made a fuss at a time when his employer Mr. Frederick Leighton was racing against the clock to finish an important order. Mr. Leighton placed a pop-up giant spider in one of his ledgers; the young man had a weak heart and the shock killed him. His body was subsequently hidden in a wardrobe that, unluckily for his employers, was being sent to 221A Baker Street.
”, Ivan sighed, “then we can go for a walk and talk over things. Before you both start.... oh my Lord, why are there torn panties on display over there?”
We had to leave the cottage briefly that November as we had had a call for help from an old friend of ours. Inspector Macdonald's ten-year-old grandson Fraser was taken seriously ill, and he and his lover Chatton Smith sent urgently asking for my help as their current local doctor seemed to have pretty much given up on the boy. It turned out to be an extremely rare form of winter flu (in autumn!) and thankfully I was able to cure him. Sherlock did so much good in the world even in his retirement; I enjoyed being able to contribute my bit.
When we went to the White Star Line offices to collect our tickets we were told that the 'Celtic's sailing had indeed been cancelled (although they used the phrase 'suspended'). I was sure that the fact I had Levi towering over me and looking somewhat hungrily at the gentleman sorting the tickets was why he very quickly offered us a free upgrade to their new ship which was making its maiden voyage in two days' time, the mighty 'Titanic'. I expected my love to jump at the chance but to my surprise he seemed unsure, so I said that we would think about it and come back to let them know the next day. There were no other sailings any time soon and I felt sorry for all those poor sailors who would be getting no pay through no fault of their own.
“They turned out to be an old prayer-book, and old chair and a horrible modern painting”, he said. “None of them worth more than five quid!”
Mr. Blackwater was asleep again before we left. Only briefly though, judging from the pleasured moan that we heard through the hotel door!
Born in 1900, the third son of Lord Harry III. When his eldest brother Lord Tobias Hawke III died in 1950, the intermediate brother Trelawney resigned his claim as he was living with Mr. Tantalus Holmes, so it was Harry who inherited. Dour but determined, he did well for the estate and in 1969 his good works both in the county and for the government in the House of Lords were recognized when he was elevated to a barony.
“The maiden voyage was delayed because her sister ship the 'Olympic' was badly damaged when she was rammed by 'H.M.S. Hawke'”, he explained. “I suppose one could say that that had helped cause the sinking, otherwise she would have been crossing at a time of less ice. One Hawke crashing. But what could the second one be unless the old ship is still under that half-blind captain‡.... oh.”
“Listen to this”, I said. “The Metropolitan Police Service are under attack today after it was revealed that three dangerous criminals escaped from gaol in the capital last week, yet the general public was not notified. The three are believed to be all part of the notorious Kensal Street Gang, whose shady leader is said to be an American called Elmer West.”
1923. There are gains and a loss to the families of the dynamic duo as well as a gain to the Royal Family itself, from which Sherlock can see potentially great things. And someone is formally told to shut up!
“I thought that you would both find retirement a lot more difficult”, Mr. Malone observed. “Get yourself dragged back every time there was a suspicious death or a political crisis in the offing.”
The weekend, and on Saturday as on almost every other day we were naked all day – out of courtesy for our host I had made sure we had had dressing-gowns on the day before – and I fetched John a chocolate cake from the local bakery, which was nice of me.
I nodded and helped him remove the plug before easing him down onto me. At fifty-two years of age I was not as fit as I once had been but slotting inside the man I love gave me an energy that I did not know that I had, especially when he began to work himself up and down me making me moan in delight.
I thought on the matter for a time then turned my attentions back to Bren. One thorough blow-job later he was in no fit state to make it out of the bed let alone the room, and having left him a covered plate of food I went to see that friend of Mr. Holmes's that he had recommended to me one time, Mr. Edward Tudor.
“You're not going to tell us Ned's an escaped murderer, are you Mr. Holmes?” Mr. James Forthright said with a smile.
“I asked Mother if she could get me a job on the railway”, he went on, blushing fiercely at his admission. “She got me in at Coldstream where I worked for a couple of years until she was able to get me on the main line and into Bren's row of cottages. He's... you've met him, sirs. He's sure no-one could ever want someone like him. Please, say you won't tell him!”
Twelfth son of the Archduke of Hartland, brunet and irredeemably stupid. In 1899 he believed that his sister had been raped by Flynn Rider while she had been visiting England (she had not) and rather than check the facts poisoned the fellow's shaving-cream so that his face would be badly scarred. Sherlock demanded he abandon his diplomatic immunity and face trial but, when he refused, the prince was stopped on his way to his ship by twelve armed and very angry molly-men. Raped and beaten, he made it back to his Baltic homeland but did not change his ways and the local molly-men there too had to have 'words' with him. Finally he abused one of his own palace guards such that the fellow broke his jaw and killed him. Rather oddly none of the other guards saw this until the killer had fled the country.....
“Not just her”, Mrs. Malone said. “Some of her other guests were a bit off as well. Then last week poor Mr. Spencer went and fell off the pier!”
I gave John my most innocent look, the one I hardly ever use when there is not bacon in the immediate vicinity. But for once he was not buying it.
“I had plenty of time to get it out!” I quipped, looking at him intently. “I still do, come to that!”
I held a variable view of the British Army, especially after the way that they had treated poor young Jimmy Douglas (now happily married and living on the American east coast with a family of his own, I am pleased to say). Like all oversized institutions I expected some degree of corruption and mismanagement – I had always noted that those who claimed larger establishments to be more efficient were somehow never themselves efficient enough to provide any evidence of their claims – and while I admired the individual fighting soldier I was less well disposed towards those further up the food chain.
“On Saturday evening my client along with the other two men left their office having locked it with the plans safely inside, after which they all went their separate ways. Mr. Leeds was attacked by at least three men while walking along the riverside path and left unconscious. He had taken the slightly longer walk to his house through the park, and as he was left in a storage hut there was little likelihood that he would be discovered. Only the fact that he was due to meet a lady friend off the train the following evening and that she had the wit to call the police when he did not appear, initiated the search that found him. He had also been drugged; I can only assume that chloroform was used in the attack and that they opted to keep so young and fit a man under to make him easier to handle.”
1907. The suffragettes continue to drive their cause steadily backwards, while John gets some candy. Sort of.
“She could always read one of their great-grandmother's stories to them?” suggested someone who was even at this late stage in our relationship was still contriving to get worse. I glared at him.
“Carl told me just where they tied the ropes”, I sighed. “I am not speaking to him as a result. I may also have passed on some of your ideas to Danny, so it will serve my brother right if he is unable to walk in the next few days as a result!”
“How can he not be sure that the Americans are not listening in on his conversations with that randy lit.... with his brother?” he scowled.
the Alnwick match. From something that only he had noted. And from something that he had not shared with his friends. Curious.
“He was sent by the government to Athens to help out in their war against the Turks”, he said. “It seems that he interpreted the instruction to 'get into bed with the Greeks' rather too literally. A Macedonian army major found him in bed with his teenage daughter and shot him on the spot.”
The rich owner of Hingston Hall. Rejected by Carantok Poldark who he had lusted after, he raped him, and was in turn murdered by Carantok's lover Mr. Isadora Persano and his godfather Doctor Frinton. This was the famous case in which part of the confusion involved the Portuguese being found sitting in front of a matchbox containing a worm unknown to science, which in reality was one of the toy ones found in Christmas crackers.
“I went to that organization you once told me about in London, Swordland's”, he said. “Mr. Tudor there was very helpful and told me that it most likely referred to the Hawke family who the doctor mentioned in some of his stories. I had a bad feeling about this and I read in the 'Times' that one of the family was in London so I decided to go and see him. That was Trey.”
“Well I must be on my way”, I said, wiping my eyes for some reason. “Thank you for your time today, sir, madam. I shall continue my inquiries elsewhere. Good day.”
off! I was either a bumbling idiot sure that I knew who had committed any crime and invariably being proved wrong, or I sat there cleaning my revolver while pouting in a way that I never did in real life (and if anyone in the vicinity felt compelled to suggest otherwise I would p..... probably not be happy!). I had
Going downstairs I let our visitor in and could see that something was indeed wrong. He sat down on the couch and fidgeted while Sherlock slouched into the kitchen and headed for the new coffee-machine that he had brought recently. I did not like the thick brew that it produced – seriously, one could almost stand a spoon up in it! – but he adored it.
I do not think I have ever loved her more. I kissed her then almost managed to fall over the coat-stand in my eagerness to get through the door, choosing to forgive her chuckle at my clumsiness (all right, I was thinking of her gun collection as well!). The ride to King’s Cross was eerily beautiful, through foggy gas-lit streets almost totally devoid of life. At the station I had just enough wit left to telegraph ahead that I was coming and would be there just after midday.
“It wasn't fair!” he sighed. “He loved me so much and I wanted to have what you and the doctor have, sir, but.... I loved Bertha even more. He was so wonderful when she died, doing everything for me. What am I going to do now I'm all alone?”
This was another of the small number of cases involving family members, and one which I think in the fullness of time may be able to be released to the British public. One can only hope that by the time it is, the bigotry shown by the perpetrators and the malice shown by the 'proper authorities' are things of the past. I can but hope.
“Because in that post you will have Strafford Island citizenship”, I said, “which will be completed when you sign that document on the table over there. You can then leave the country with Prince Pale of that island who is visiting England just now, which means that no-one will be able to touch you as you will be a foreign citizen even when you are on American soil.”
I was saddened at the end of the year when the Irish Free State (later Eire) broke away as arranged, leaving the United Kingdom with only the six counties of Ulster as Northern Ireland. I supposed that partition might have been the lesser of two evils as compared to saddling the new state with several hundreds of thousands of very reluctant citizens, but after the Irish had come close to stabbing us in the back during the Great War my attitudes towards them had hardened, as had Sherlock's despite his having been born there.
“There at least we have been fortunate”, he said. “Sergeant Richards is a good man; he was very firm with Mr. Major when he tried to tell him how to pursue the investigation, asking him if he would be equally prepared for a local constable to start telling him how to design his vehicles! I am sure that he will wait for facts rather than seek out only those that support a certain viewpoint. My poor client needs all the help he can get.”
This whole sorry saga had started three days ago when, at my friend Sir Peter Greenwood's request I had left our cottage and travelled across country to Wiltshire and the home of Sherlock's 'other family' the Hawkes. His half-nephew Lord Harry Hawke's wife Alice had recently passed but that was the least of the fellow's problems. All three of his sons had come down with some unspecified illness which, while not apparently life-threatening (yet) had denied all my clever friend's attempts to drive it back. The fifteen-year-old twins Tobias and Trelawney and their eight-year-old brother Harry might well be the last of the Hawkes if they did not survive to have children. It was all very bad.
Postscriptum: Mr. Creighton Dallas made it to the United States where he became an estate manager in the state of North Dakota. He died in early 1929 and a clause in his will asked his executors to send a note of thanks to Sherlock and myself for our actions that time in Galloway and to request publication of this story. I have fulfilled his last request.
I forbore from commenting on the large number of certain injuries that I regularly treated Mr. Rockland for, which suggested that the lack of children was not through any lack of trying of someone's part. Thank the lord that we and the Rocklands had an unwritten agreement on Not Sharing certain things. One did not want to know...... well, one just did not want to
“Interesting”, Sherlock said as we began walking back to the village. “One might have thought that she would have been keen to catch her father’s killer. But as the police officer on duty you do have the right to insist.”
“No”, he said. “It is Peter; he told me something in confidence but he said that I might tell you in the circumstances.”
“Visiting Tom’s brother George and his lady friend, Miss Barton-Jones”, she said. “She has a house in the village of Cleveley, not far from Stalwarton. Her uncle is one of the county members of parliament.”
She was the wife of Mr. Ceawlin Musgrave whose steward he was; they were also cousins and had been conducting an affair. Sherlock prompted Mr. Sweeney into an attempt at murdering his employer which, when it failed, led to his joining his already absent accomplice and fleeing with her husband's bonds – unfortunately for them across the recently-opened Tay Railway Bridge on the very night that it collapsed!
“You are not”, I told him. “Anne has sold the house in Alresford – it was too close to your father's house what with all that has happened – and we found her this place. Plus the garage can use an extra mechanic with all the vehicles on the roads these days.”
A criminal whose attempted theft of a gemstone led him to cause a 'tired' captain to strand his boat off Futility Island so that the villain could steal it from Mr. Falconbridge. Sherlock had however substituted a fake gem, and Mr. Campbell was arrested. He swore that he would get revenge by targeting John; when he escaped from gaol in 1898 he tracked him down at Brightlingsea in Essex but was prevented from finishing him off by first Sherrinford and then by Sherlock. Sherlock later lured the villain into a trap and shot him dead, having his body dumped off Futility Island.
I was clearly going senile in my old age. He nodded, his handsome face devilishly dark as he watched me put two and two together.
“Not yet”, he said, “but she knows who does. A lady called Miss Eleanor Clerihew, the late Lady Hawke's companion. She is staying on at the Park Lane flat until it it sold; Harry has promised to find a place for her before that happens.”
As it was lunch-time and my stomach chose the steps of the police-station to inform me (and Sherlock, and a startled passer-by!) of that fact, we decided to adjourn to a local restaurant before going to the station. The establishment we chose was pleasant enough although there were three somewhat unsavoury young fellows in the corner who were eyeing us up for some reason. I was glad to leave the place especially as they did not even serve anything with chocolate, the heathens!
I was grateful that Sherlock still had The Voice even if he only ever used it on me. Mr. Irons shook himself, gave one lustful look at my great-nephew and nodded.
I scowled at him. Yes I did, but was his smirk worth it? Fortunately he proved to be a good fellow by bringing one over anyway for which I thanked him.
The village seemed unusually quiet and, rather oddly for that time on a Tuesday, the shop was shut with a rack of newspapers and an honesty box on the wall outside. Puzzled, I deposited my coins and took a newspaper, reading the main headline. Then I froze.
“Of course”, I said with a smile. “I survived your Scottish trip and this is much closer. You should go and pack. I will fine.”
Sherlock smiled and let me do what I wanted until I was ready, then finished undressing me and led me into the bath seating himself behind me and easing me down to rest against him. I was surprised that he was not even hard but then neither was I.
An assassin working for Professor Moriarty. His sister Sally got a job at 221B and he pretended to be her beau; one day David tried to commit murder in the maid's costume only to be stabbed by Mr. Roderick West, the knife-thrower from the Circus Belle case (the villain's gun had already been replaced by one with blanks). Sally was hung for her part.
He was overthrown and my first act was to appoint Bill and Ben as harem guards and bring them with me to England. It was the highest honour that I could legally bestow on them and it only just smoothed things over back home; their people were as you might have guessed not overly pleased and we had several small-scale raids before peace was restored. I mention them because I think that they might be useful to you in this.”
“Yes”, the fellow said. “And I thought that he seemed very nervous. He did not like me standing close to him.”
“The shot from distance must have been fired with considerable accuracy”, Sherlock said. “Without wishing to cast aspersions, who is the best marksman in the area?”
→1.2: William (1884-1957), lover of Carlyon Holmes II (1884-1956), youngest son of Sherlock's half-brother General Carlyon Holmes
“What I wish to know”, he said, “is whether you can tell me who the conductor was on a certain train and if he would have remained on just one route?”
He had time to jump up and down in an attempt to trigger the mechanism before the policemen were on him. At that moment the conductor of the orchestra belatedly came to his senses and led his orchestra into 'La Marseillaise' and followed it up with the National Anthem. Mr. Cumberbatch had by then long been dragged from the stage. And to the astonishment of the audience, Sherlock – the real one; I would never be fooled by any copy – came on wearing the same clothes as Mr. Cumberbatch and joined the cast in singing both songs lustily and loudly.
“I do”, Mr. Malone said. “They only found it because they were building some new houses on the edge of Hailsham. The developer fellow – very fairly in my opinion – gave them six weeks in which he could work round them then they would have to be off. They have two weeks left.”
"His grandfather is from just north of Newcastle", he said. "Can't remember the name of the place, except it started with a 'B'. He got him a post on the railway on the loop line through Wooler and Coldstream but had been looking to get him somewhere on the main line as it runs a few miles from his grandfather's place. The old fellow isn’t in the best of health and Ned wants to keep an eye on him. Luckily his station-master put in a good word for him and he moved in at Belford.”
I sniggered. He was clearly not that annoyed, especially when Mr. Lannister, pulled him upright into a manly embrace and Mr. Dayne crossed to sit with them.
I remember that that summer seemed particularly glorious, especially after Sherlock's nephew Tantalus and his lover Sherlock's grandson Lord Trelawney Hawke (thank the Lord my love's mother was up in Heaven and could not write about this!) arrived with Tantalus in a state. His son Carl's wife was expecting with the child due next January, and nothing could seemingly calm him down – until Sherlock suggested he and I take a drive over to Lewes for the day and leave the young men in the cottage.
The eldest son of Carlyon Holmes. After a life of wasting opportunities he was shocked by his father refusing to help him join the Army simply because he was a complete waste of space. He embarked on a life of crime and was even more shocked when he was disowned by his father. He died of a drugs overdose – 'coincidentally' just before he was due to meet one of the Moriartys.
"His mother's dead", he said, "and his father was a footman at the Duke of Northumberland's place down in Alnwick.”
Our rooms. Except that they were no longer really ours. All our worldly goods were already down in Sussex awaiting out arrival, save what we needed for that night and the next morning – our last morning – in two handbags. Although we seemed to have been here forever I had had just eighteen years here if I included those three terrible years
“I have a problem”, Tantalus said sitting down as John went to make me coffee. “I need your help Uncle Sherlock, Uncle John.”
As we approached Epping there was no sign of the doctor – I had not expected there to be as I had noted the train coming up behind us just as we had entered the town – and we hurried in at the gateway. For a brief moment my heart soared in relief. There, picking early Bramleys off one of the trees in the grounds was Lion looking totally unharmed and.....
“You said that you were on reasonably good terms with your grandfather”, I said eventually. “Do you have a copy of his will?”
sphere of influence, I suppose much as we would resent it if they somehow acquired the Shetland Isles.”
That critical year ended on a happy note as we had a second police visitor to the cottage, this time the recently retired Superintendent Chatton Smith, still living with his lover Mr. Fraser Macdonald on the Cumberland Coast. It was a sobering thought that Sherlock had first met the younger man when he had been but a teenager and now he was nearly fifty. Many  – too many – things seemed to be changing so fast these days.
“Ah, before the gun there was the small matter of the trap-door”, he said. “I would say that he was most probably aiming for the president rather than the king.”
“I am sure that there is a small store-room somewhere”, he growled, and now he was using The Voice, damn him! “By an
“It was partly my fault”, I muttered. Ivan had wanted to see the Holy Land, and I had used my (Sherlock's) influence to get him into a regiment that had been assigned there. Yet it had so nearly got him killed.
Born in 1778, the second son of the excellent Tobias Hawke and alas! another rake. He became heir after his elder brother's death at Waterloo; it was fortunate that Harry married well to one Miss Charlotte Pensford who ruled him with a rod of iron and limited the damage that he might otherwise have done to the estate. Harry's daughter, another Charlotte, married his business acquaintance Mr. George Buckingham thus forging the link between the two families.
“Poor Fray is having mixed emotions”, our visitor said. “On one hand it is the christening of his first great-grandson so he is over the moon especially as it will be another Fraser. On the other hand it is his first great-grandson which means that he is getting old – although as he himself says when he is driving the point home to me, older
The general drove my love to Berwick Station from which they would take the train to London. I waved them goodbye then went slowly back into the house. Only then did I break down in tears. Lord, I was a wreck! Sherlock would be ashamed of me if he had known but a long lonely time without the light of my life stretched ahead of me and I did not know how on earth I was going to get through it.
Meanwhile John and I had a most pleasant journey back to Chuffingden, even if he had to be helped from the train at Newcastle.
“Let us go to the police-station”, he said. “It is bitterly cold here. Once we are safely in the warm, I have some ideas as to who has committed this crime.”
“I would not be where I am today but for five very important people in my life. First of course my dear wife Elizabeth, who is always right about everything” (I caught the blush from 'someone' as I said that). “Then my father and mother, especially my father who deferred his retirement for the good of the Service when he did not need to. And finally my father's friends Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, currently enjoying their retirement somewhere far away. They helped my father on many occasions throughout his long career, and always out of the goodness of their hearts.”
A short 250-yard street running north-west from Great Russell Street to where it meets the south-western corner of Russell Square. Montaigu-les-Bois is the village where the Montagu family, later the Dukes of Bedford who own much land in the area, hailed from in Normandy. This was also the nearest address to Sherlock's parents' house in Guilford Street which could be reached by cutting across the Square; for some strange and inexplicable reason he did not like to be reminded of this! It was ¾-mile away from the Bloomsbury Surgery so the closest of the four addresses to that as well, although not by much. Today the Bedford Estates are on the eastern side of the road (where Sherlock's and John's house was; it was later demolished) while the west is entirely taken up with the British Museum.
1927. Sherlock and John continue to be.... well, themselves, although at least when John is not scared he still gets to be held in a manly embrace. Despite that damn smirk!
“True”, our host said. “However by a stroke of bad luck the French president is coming to England tomorrow for what was originally going to be just an informal visit. In view of the situation in the Balkans, King George wants to do what he can to make him feel welcome in order to strengthen the ties between our nations. The two gentlemen will attend the performance of a play in Shaftesbury Avenue, and your attendance would most certainly be appreciated.”
”, our visitor said ruefully. “Some months ago the Local Working Men's Association, which had been meeting in the back rooms of its various members, applied for a lease of a flat above a shop a few doors down from mine. Several of my fellow shopkeepers were against it but I, foolishly as it turned out, saw no objection and they were allowed to proceed. Since then however two of the men involved have been harassing ladies and gentlemen going to and from my shop.”
In our many adventures together, Sherlock and I had visited every English county but not every Scottish one (although I knew that my love had visited both the Northern Isles during my time in Egypt). Standing here on the windswept southern coast of Orkney's mainland almost at the very top of Scotland, I wished that we had had a case here together. The place was stunningly beautiful.
“I was lucky”, he said. “My time over there was almost up and I was allowed to return early to sort out the estate. I went to Hector and persuaded him to come to England with me.”
“The Orient Express”, he said. “We could travel across the Continent and back again if you really wanted.”
We went briefly upstairs to say a last goodbye to our rooms and it struck me that this was indeed no longer our home. The fake copies of what had once been our treasured possessions were truly symbolic; 221B was but a shadow of what had been and my future lay many miles to the south in the arms of the man that I loved. It was sad in a way but then that was the point of moving to a new life. One had to let go of the old to make room for it.
I frowned. That dratted leering Cornish ex-fisherman again. It was a damn good thing that I was not the jealous sort and that had better damn well not be another smirk!
“I am rather afraid that they were driven by the works manager and Mr. Leeds's superior, a Mr. Major”, the lawyer said, a look of distaste on his face. “One of those upstart fellows who thinks that he has to be a Man of Action to be respected; I am sure that you have often encountered his sort. The actual works owner Mr. Samuel Primrose has been helpfulness itself in what few inquiries that I have been able to make thus far, but Mr. Major is convinced of his employee's guilt.”
There was one more event of note that year and it was what had I both hoped for and yet feared. In December my son Ivan's marriage to Miss Anne Gower produced a son whom he named Luke after his maternal grandfather. I too was now a grandfather, but my offspring would never know me.
That summer we were due to visit the Malones in Eastbourne. We had intended to travel by train from Berwick but a few days before we were to set out there occurred the terrible and inexplicable Salisbury railway accident when some twenty-eight people lost their lives as an express train tried to take a sharp curve at far too high a speed. Sherlock of course knew immediately of my concerns and instead suggested hiring a trap in the village and going by road. It was considerably slower but I enjoyed the journey, especially as we went via the coast and passed a beautiful old tower complete with a belvedere†.
Oddly enough, they were not. As I had expected the prayer-book turned out to be a rare sixteenth century one from Scotland and the only surviving one of its type while the chair, which I had thought incredibly ugly and best suited for firewood, was from a German designer who had created it for a king (presumably one that he had disliked intensely). After all three items had indeed been assessed as having a total value in excess of ten thousand pounds¶, Mr. Jukes's cousins decided to contest the will on the grounds that their grandfather had not been of sound mind. Unfortunately for them he had pre-empted such a move by having four eminent physicians sign sworn documents confirming his sanity, so all his grandsons' efforts came to was a large legal bill. Mr. Jukes and my half-nephew sold their inheritance then purchased a large estate back up near Bamburgh where they made a name for themselves as generous philanthropists – even if one of them still blushed far too much!
“You are asking me to go to the Welsh March and look for someone called Jones?” I said archly. “That is, to coin a phrase, a needle in several shires full of hay-fields.”
“Our guest means that the Americans are undertaking what is known in the trade as sabre-rattling”, I said. “They do not like the British having a base that close to what they regard as
I detected the slightest of reactions from my half-nephew at that and made a mental note to talk with him about it later. Evidently whatever the matter at hand was, it had clearly started
“One of the men asked that and she said that he had put away her brother”, Lion said, twisting his hands around each other (he always did that when he was anxious). “Herry, what can we
1906. A minor misadventure in which a retired doctor makes the mistake of lying to his mind-reader of a lover. The Consequences are... painful!
“I, er..... well, he was maybe more than just a footman”, he admitted, scratching his stubbled beard. “Lady Eleanor, the duke's sister, she comes to matches sometimes which seems odd for a nob. I know the ground is on his land, but even so."
“You had better try”, I said. “Your children have factor C in their blood – that is on record – but neither you nor Lord Trelawney has it; we had his blood tested yesterday. Therefore those children
He had been in charge of a local orphanage in the Forest of Dean where he had abused young boys and girls. Despite his father's assistance in suppressing a report into his vile doings, the local people found out the truth and kidnapped him. He was dragged to a charcoal fire and, unlike Mr. Greenstead, was not rendered unconscious before being incinerated.
I scowled and hurried out of the rest of my clothes, not helped by his working my erection as I did so. He was already up on the small bench that was the only furniture in this place and clearly ready to impale himself on me.
“That means that you are our grandfather, sir”, the elder boy said politely. “May we be greatly honoured, and be permitted to address you as such?”
I had some fears that he may well have been right about the Prince of Wales. There was something of a certain recently departed and totally unmissed lounge-lizard about the fellow, despite his popularity and the newspapers contrasting him favourably with his 'stuffy' parents.
“Miss Ockham goes to Mr. Leeds's house, leaves the money where it can easily be found – something that no normal person would have done – and dresses herself in his clothes”, Sherlock said. “She has already dyed her hair blonde and concealed it under a hat and now she unfurls it – but in so doing she unwittingly makes her first mistake. Mr. Leeds had had his hair cut the day before, but in pretending to be him she assumes that he still has a full lion's mane and heads to the railway station under a fulsome set of locks. If she is spotted and remembered, it will make Mr. Leeds's claims over the attack look suspect to say the least. Unfortunately for her she is not, at least not on the station itself.”
“I have an arrangement with Mr. Crusoe that my telegrams go to his house above the bakery”, I said. “I am sure that he will not mind going downstairs for a particularly clever customer!”
“That definitely rules him out, then”, Sherlock said, looking relieved. “This incident took place at a quarter to four on a Thursday afternoon; seemingly I must focus my attentions on the other people involved. You say that you are happy with the fellow's work?”
“Could they not have been more discreet?” I wondered. “I know they have masks on and all, but do they have to... you know.”
The second Sherlock was already growing into the image of his namesake a quiet, serious boy far from the standard loud three-year-old. I watched as he was stood staring out across the Downs and a girl of a similar age from the family some yards away from us wandered over in his direction....
The fellow at the door was momentarily confused at having two targets, but he turned and levelled his gun at me. Lion, bless the fellow, did not hesitate but fired straight at him. The door slammed in front of 'Mr. Smith' but from the slowly enlarging red patch on his white shirt and the way in which he slumped to the floor, there had been no need. He was dead.
Mr. Edward Jukes was something of a surprise, even given what I had been told about him by my half-nephew. He was blond and strikingly handsome, slender of build but with a commanding presence that stood out; his powerfully muscled thighs were almost the size of those of our three clients. I thought instinctively of a picture John had once shown me of the famous Hotspur who, if this fellow was indeed Lady Eleanor Percy's offspring, was therefore an ancestor of this fellow. I liked the direct way in which he held my gaze; I had in my time had far too many people who could not look me in the eye whilst spouting what were at best half-truths. I could also see that he had made some effort to cover up his recent assault, which I supposed was understandable.
Ye Gods, I had to have been blind not to have seen it. His eyes visibly widened and he actually moved slightly towards me before managing to check himself. Fellow needed his eyes looking at, but whatever.
On reaching eighteen Ivan had with the help of a supporting letter of recommendation from myself (and Sherlock) obtained a place at the Leicester School Of Art And Science studying, of all things, vehicular technology. He had said in his letter of thanks that he hoped the day would come when everyone could afford one of these horseless carriages or auto-mobiles, a thought which had frankly made me shudder. His last letter had been a couple of months ago announcing that he had successfully completed his course – with honours! – and had obtained a job at a factory in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, where they produced not only assorted metal products but also experimental vehicles.
At least Ivan was getting better now; he had not had a nightmare for nearly a whole month according to Anne. When I thought how many young men had returned in such terrible condition, mentally and physically – indeed, how many had not returned at all – I shuddered. Although I had fretted when Ivan had gone to London last weekend; a servant of his late mother had apparently kept some things for him after his father had disinherited him, and she had asked him to come and collect them. Even from the grave, the former Miss Elizabeth Bradley was causing me unease.
“Doctor Watson here will understand this, I'm sure”, he said. “We had a good season last year, 'specially after Ned Jukes moved to the area. He lived up in Cornhill right on the Border and like Bren, he works on the old North Eastern. He's our scrum-half and a real fast runner. Bren's the hooker and we're props.”
I could see Sherlock's surprise when I returned a few days later with Lord Harry and his twins, although he made them all welcome and asked after their health. He must have known from their guarded responses that something was amiss, and I sighed as I prepared to explain that his second family had just got even closer to him. I had contacted Mr. Tudor at Swordland's over the past few days on the off-chance that somehow all this was a horrible mistake, but he had been able to confirm that the worst as ever was true. It really would have been nice to have been proven wrong for once.
1915. John's son Ivan is off to war and the best that the doctor can do for him is to have him sent somewhere slightly less dangerous. Sherlock also has concerns over his other family the Hawkes, which lead to strange men in Wiltshire.
The constable looked pointedly at the vicar. The four of us were sat in the police-station to which we had adjourned. The vicar nodded.
“We have met the young gentlemen”, Sherlock said. “He approached us some eight years ago over the matter at Yoxley Old Place'.”
I frowned and thought back. We had gone to the capital for a short break and the trip had been nothing special except... yes he had shown me one of the new police boxes that they were putting up around the capital, a small blue thing with a lantern on the top and I had remarked that it was just the right size for.....
I was more than a little surprised to see my nephew because I had thought his 'foreign service' still had some time to run. Tantalus had extended his 'activities' beyond Sheikh Khalid's 'away harem' in England and in recent years had travelled to Arbir to, ahem, 'service' his 'home' one. He had I thought only been a few months out there on his most recent trip so I had not expected him back any time soon. Yet now he was here.
“Ireland has no business sticking his nose into what does not concern him”, he said angrily. “He is my lawyer and nothing else.”
1904. People change over time – but when Sherlock and John investigate the fears of a good friend, they find that some people can change an awful lot! And John is hideously embarrassed by a huge weapon.
“That is the area around a small house owned by Mr. Creighton Dallas, the dead man's brother”, Lord Fleet said. “Now the only bit of property around here that we do not own; he can only access it by a road that goes under the railway and then doubles back by the station. I would presume that his brother was on his way to visit him when he was killed.”
her financial assistance. Blaze somehow refrained from tearing him limb from limb – pity! – but as it turned out he did not have to; Sherlock's brother worked himself up into such a state that he suffered an apoplectic shock and was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.
“Very”, Sherlock said. “I shall miss Baker Street although one consolation will be that we shall not be far from here, so we shall doubtless see them when they visit.”
“That was what prompted me to seek out Kitty, which was just as well”, Lady Bradstock said grimly. “It happened at the Hall right in front of Nathaniel. Poor Tom just collapsed in his chair and had to be carried out.”
Sherlock, after five years in Cramer Street, two in Montague Street and those few short weeks in Dorset Street. All had in turn been my home even if rented, and now we were going to a place of our own at last.
“General McCall's boy”, he said. “I was having this plaster put on at the time or as he would doubtless have described it to you, 'shilly-shallying about on the pathetic excuse of a broken leg'.”
“I see that you drove up this morning”, she said. “It is good that you have the car, what with us living in such a rural area.”
“We can always return it if it does not suit”, Sherlock said, “if you would like something better to mark my seventieth birthday. I also have a back-up present that is deep blue and very frilly!”
I took a deep breath. I was seriously in danger of saying something that I would not have regretted in the slightest when I realized that he was staring past us. Following his gaze I turned and saw that Dane had emerged from the cottage, blinking sleepily and looking as ruffled as a certain blue-eyed someone did of a morning.
I winced as I thought back to the terrible Madam Worrea and more recently Mistress Glick, both of whom had paid for their character failings albeit to different degrees. If this was the future of fairer sex, then Mankind was pretty much doomed in my humble opinion. At least this harridan had not got round to simpering at Sherlock.
“Something else young Master Bigglesworth said yesterday was important”, he said, shuddering as I sent him a lustful look, “but 'someone' did not give me time to get it out yesterday.”
“She is studying at a university in London”, Mrs. Malone explained, “and read about it so decided to come and 'help out'. I would wager that the other diggers were
1908. Sherlock and John help out a young friend, and John discovers that vegetables can indeed be bad for some people. And not just in eating them.
“Those who live by the sword die by it”, Sherlock said softly. “Doubtless he was promised a great reward by whichever country employed him. I almost wish that I could have been there to see him get it.”
“A mess of the government's own making”, Sherlock said unsympathetically as he poured our visitor a beer. “At least they finally seem to be getting the war right; I would not give the Germans more than a few months now after they threw everything at us in the spring and failed to break us.”
“Tonight”, I promised. “Besides it is Saturday, so that will give you something to seek forgiveness for when we go to church on Sunday morning.”
Brendon had once remarked of his own father that Duke Malcolm (Duke Edmund's grandfather and predecessor) could have not only provided a football team with his many bastard offspring but could have covered substitutes, the match officials, and have made a fair start on the crowd as well! I remembered that comment in particular because I had heard much the same said about my father’s business partner Sheridan, Lord Hawke; only later did I find out that this was true enough with me being numbered ‘in his team’! Some of the more observant (or at least the less insane!) of Watson’s readers remarked from time to time that it was a pity we never came across any of my other half-siblings and the like during our careers. The truth, as always in these things, was complicated.
His accent was definitely a Scots one, but not the harsher tones of the central and north. Most definitely a Borderer.
“Mrs. Whitlow has not called”, I said kissing him tenderly on the forehead. He nestled closer to me and nibbled at my neck.
“Tom has two older brothers, Daniel and George”, she said. “Daniel is twenty-seven, George twenty-six and my husband twenty-three. Both my brothers-in-law are single although both are courting young ladies. It is recent events which have concerned me, and when I found that they were also occurring during his time with Kitty we decided to come to you at once.”
My vision returned, and I briefly wondered why he had not come as well. Then I realized that the sneaky little bastard was actually wearing the platinum cock-ring that I had bought for him and which he had had engraved that last time he had had to visit London (seriously, where on earth had he found a jeweller to do
“Probably annoyed them that he chose to let it stay there”, the constable observed dryly. “Reminds everyone whose field it is, I suppose.”
Somehow I managed to retain enough sense to quickly open him up, my cock already leaking in anticipation at being inside him where it belonged. I tried to ease in gently but even at fifty-two he was as flexible as ever and he scooted down the bed, impaling himself on me and letting out a satisfied groan as I yelped in surprise. We usually took our time when coupling but this was raw sex and I was blinded with lust, racing towards my climax and coming far sooner than I would have wished. I came violently, yelping in agonized relief before falling onto my hands and trying not to crush him.
The man shrank back before his anger. Sherlock was terrifying when roused, as I (and my backside) knew well full. And the photographer really could have invested in some padded seats.
“When is your next match?” I asked, having a horrible feeling that I knew what would form part of the answer.
1904. Farewell to Baker Street, as the dynamic duo quit London for their cottage on the Downs. And all that sex!
Because of what I presume were police procedures the new Chief-Inspector LeStrade had to attend a short course in London before he could fully take up his position although he was entitled to call himself by his new title straight-away. It was during this time in early August that he paid us a visit, just after the birth of his thirteenth –
“I did call at your cottage yesterday”, he said in a tone of mild reproof. “Unfortunately that must have been you were busy.”
I was surprised however to find just who the pest was sharing his house with, namely the Italian Palazzi brothers who worked alongside him at the molly-houses. Salerio was I knew married, yet he was very obviously living there full-time.
The day before what Sherlock somehow knew would be the next attack – he was bound to be right but he was always quite insufferably smug when I admitted it and surely even at this late stage there had to be a first time for his omniscience to fail – we went to Paddington Station where we met Miss Kelley. The three of us then journeyed up to Oxford from where we took a local train to the little market town of King’s Linton. The Forston, Milton and Wolfstown Railway did continue on to serve Stalwarton but Sherlock did not want to go there just yet. In the Grease Monkey tavern (honestly, modern pub names!) we met with Lady Bradstock.
“Because the doors between carriages on this line are always kept locked”, I said. “We had better make a run for it at the next stop, Great Portland Street. Thankfully that is just the other side of Regent's Park – I remember taking a walk there once – so it is not far.”
After twenty-four hours of not being allowed into our garden he finally relented and I followed him out the back only to baulk at what I saw. Our shed was now dark blue and could probably be seen from the main road over a mile away; thankfully it was partly behind the cottage otherwise the villagers would certainly have had something to say about it!
“May I have a physical description, please?” I asked. “I would not wish to approach the girl without good reason, or indeed upset your household in any way.”
We suffered another loss that September when Sherlock's son-in-law Lord Harry Hawke died and was succeeded to the title by his eldest son Lord Tobias, then forty years of age. The new lord had just managed to get his eldest son Tobias, then aged ten, into the prestigious De Montfort's School in Lewes (yes, with Sherlock's help). Father and son both met us in the town and thanked us both for my love's efforts.
“Not to me!” she said firmly and I bit back a smile. My friend's famous charms would not work on this female, of that I was sure. “My dear friend Elizabeth wants to find a man.”
The obvious next thing to do was to visit Mr. Troilus Gable and see if my hypothesis was correct. His impressively large if rather ugly house was called 'Maryvale', I presumed after his wife who Mr. Ireland had told me had been Miss Mary de Vale before her marriage. I knew that Mr. Gable lived there with their two daughters, one still at school and the other one engaged to be married to a local bank manager. The third was training to be a doctor in London, much to the disapproval of both her father and grandfather.
each other, sinking one trawler. The Royal Navy was scrambled to pursue and the Czar very quickly agreed to set the matter before an independent international tribunal. Sherlock did receive several frantic telegrams from his brother Randall over the matter although fortunately the lounge-lizard did not appear at our door as the man-traps had not yet arrived.
1904. The peaceful and quiet sunset of the dynamic duo's lives on the Downs begins (note: description does not include any doctors with the initials J.H.W. screaming for either mercy or no mercy).
I did like Mr. Galahad LeStrade, but as we journeyed back to Baker Street I could not but think of that handsome virile young body and my own sadly ageing one. I had passed fifty-two that year and Sherlock was very unfairly still in his forties. My friend must have known that I was feeling a little down because he said that he wanted to stop to send a telegram on the way home and that he would do so from Trafalgar Square so we could dine at my favourite restaurant there. I loved him for doing something small yet as considerate as that.
“I want to make love to you”, he said simply. “I want to go to bed every night with the most beautiful man that God ever created, wake up with that man beside me every morning, and go through the day between knowing that he loves me maybe half as much as I love him.”
We looked as two familiar figures got out of the front of the train and hurried away towards the lane that led the short distance to the Low Level Station on the Great Western line to London. Moments later the woman from earlier followed them.
“I am going to take this opportunity to remind you of something”, I pressed. “The doctor and I always follow justice first and the law second. Having met the general I have little doubt that his youngest son was not happy at home, and it is my guess that his father had forced him into a military career. If you trust us with the truth of what really happened, I promise that we shall put the boy's interests first and foremost.”
“I suppose I shall have to sell eventually”, he said. “I've long thought about emigrating to America or Canada.”
“I am so, so sorry”, he said glumly. “You have no idea how much I wanted this to be something – anything! – else. I looked up George Dundas when I had my first suspicions. He and the late Lady Alice had the same birthday –
Born in 1923, the eldest son of Baron Harry I. Served with distinction in World War Two, he only held the title for some six months before following his father to the grave. His daughter Mary married Christian Holmes II (Tantalus Holmes's great-grandson); their son Shere married John Watson's descendant St. John and they became the Watson-Holmeses.
As the minutes ticked by however I began to wonder what was keeping my nephew and grandson. Mr. Hebden came in and kindly said that he would make rooms up for us in the west wing rather than having to go back into the village to the tavern there. Finally when it was nearly half-past nine the two wanderers returned... oh.
“I would draw your attention to two things”, he said. “The unusual pallor on the fourth man's face, and his nose.”
Checking my brother out of the place was not a problem, but I noticed a familiar figure watching us as we completed the inevitable paperwork at the reception desk. I covertly nudged my brother.
hoped that they were just slightly squashed meatballs and not what they looked like which was making John cross his legs again.
I had a son. Yet I had not. I could not ruin his life by charging in and taking more than I had been blessed with. He looked at me and smiled.
to mislead, to throw confusion upon confusion as it were. It is not easy to shoot a man in poor visibility on a cold and foggy morning even if one is an excellent shot – but in this case the shooter had help. Mr. Alan Dallas stopped and turned at that stone and stood there waiting because he saw someone that he knew coming after him. He did not draw his knife because he saw no danger – but he was wrong because that person would help kill him.”
My thoughts were interrupted by the bell announcing the advent of visitors. This was not that surprising; it was Saturday and at weekends we always had a late breakfast after sleeping in and…. and I was thinking of It again! Fortunately Sherlock was distracted by ringing back for a fifteen-minute delay while we finished our meal which allowed me to drag my mind out of the gutter that it seemed so fond of whenever the blue-eyed genius was in the vicinity. Although the knowing smirk on his return suggested that there would definitely be some Very Happy Times in the not too distant future.
“I see your point, constable”, Sherlock said. “Let us see if Miss Dallas can be persuaded to co-operate. But before we approach her we shall establish the facts of what happened, then proceed from there.”
My heart skipped a beat. John was standing there. John, panting furiously, gazing at me with those impassioned hazel eyes. I stared at him for a moment then I broke, hurtling towards him and falling against him as he struggled to slide closed the door. I whimpered piteously but he held me at arms' length for a moment.
“Because if King George dies then his son simply takes over”, Sherlock said. “I know that Guilford has some reservations about that young man, rightly so I fear, but the constitutional disturbance to our country would be minimal, at least at first. If the French president is shot while visiting the capital of a supposed ally however, all hell would break loose. The French have never coped well with change and their response to any German attack would be weakened. Thus Mr. Cumberbatch, who is by the way an excellent shot, would only need one bullet.”
John did not pout at the mention of the fellow's name but followed me as we went into a small quayside office and asked after Mr. Day Penmarrick. We were fortunate; he was undertaking some repairs to the 'Saucy Jane' and we were told it was had a black hull with a thick white stripe along the side. It proved easy to find, as did Mr. Penmarrick.
I do not remember much of that November, except that the fireworks definitely did not end on Guy Fawkes's Night!
At the end of March, Sherlock baked me a batch of his heavenly chocolate nut muffins. I was immediately wary; he only usually did those for either special occasions or bad news. There was no special occasion to hand so it had to be the latter.
I winced. I believed that patriotism was generally a force for good but Mr. Benedict Patterson was an irksome idiot who never missed an opportunity to remind everyone that he was an AMERICAN (capital letters not optional) living in London. He was in an ongoing feud with his local council who were trying to get him to tone down his red, white and blue house with its seventeen –
; the teenager had taken up with a German lady called Angela something-or-other, some six years his senior and a distant relative of King Otto of Bavaria let alone at a time when war with Germany looked more and more certain. Doing something as foolish as that was – poor Stevie had totally flipped! He had rightly disinherited the lad who had appealed to his mother in the certain knowledge that she would side with him, only find that he had been very wrong. The whole affair left a bitter taste in my mouth as I felt that I had all but lost one of my three (official) nephews.
It was a pleasant journey of a little over an hour from Hereford to Craven Arms, followed by a short carriage ride. The countryside in this part of Shropshire was I thought like that poem of John's, quiet and rather charming. Parliament Farm lay at the end of a narrow track a little way west of the village of Clungunford.
“It was because he loved you that he left it all to you”, I said, “save that small amount for the godson that you so generously named after him.”
I was about to reply when the model walked around from behind a screen that I had not even noticed and walked up onto the platform. He must have been at least six foot four, was very muscular and had fair, almost white skin. He was wearing a dressing-gown and carrying a huge broadsword that was almost as tall as he himself was, which he rested against the pole when he reached the dais I was about to ask Sherlock the obvious question when the fellow effortlessly shed the robe. Instinctively I looked down.
Coincidentally our last case from Baker Street arose not long after I saw a most amusing sign outside a tavern in that busy thoroughfare:
It was the day after St. Valentine's Day, still loathed by the both of us and not marked in any way, shape or form. Certainly not by the broken man lying in my bed wearing only a thong with hearts on it and letting out the occasional whimper as he slept. Also no, I did not strut as I left him after helping him to hold his heavy breakfast plate. Indeed, showing great generosity I made things much easier for him by removing all that heavy bacon!
“It is the middle name of Mr. Kuznetsov's son Boris”, he explained. “He was named after some friend of his father, and I asked about it when I tended to him one time. The name Bassett-Evans is unfamiliar which suggests that he is likely a newcomer to Belford; possibly it is an Anglicized version of a foreign name. I likely know the other men whose names he mentions though; the Forthrights have lived in Bamburgh since forever and if they are in the rugby team then they must be nephews or possibly even great-nephews of old Jebediah Forthright. He was one of those miserable old fellows who seemed to actually enjoy being miserable; I can only hope that his kin are very different.”
that I was dead; it is called artistic licence!). John, my beloved John, as young as that fateful first day when he and I had met in Stamford's room at Oxford over six decades ago, a John whose soul shone brighter than the brightest star. My life, my love, my all.
It was a cruel question for I already knew the answer, even before my nephew's fierce blush confirmed it.
“Cake!” Toni almost shouted looking mortified. “I made chocolate especially for you, Uncle John. For heaven's sake please change the subject!”
I smiled. I was beginning to see how this had been done. The late Mr. William Jukes had been a smart man indeed.
. This to me seems to overlook the matter that the nation which caused ten million deaths and the widespread devastation of both Belgium and north-eastern France is still the largest in Europe; indeed I very much I fear that we may come to regret not dismantling it as we did its partner in crime, Austria-Hungary. I also fear that the horrors of the Russian Revolution will have grave consequences further on, both inside and beyond that country's borders. It will be the responsibility of us and the next generation to ensure that all those young lives lost are not in vain, and that we truly can make a land fit for heroes.”
have that in their blood. There is no other way that it could have come about, and as the children are not Lord Trelawney's blood he will not be obliged to pay a penny towards them.”
I shook my head at him. It was a complete coincidence that we had got a hotel which served excellent breakfasts. I owed Luke for that at least so I might not send Benji that extra-large box of 'supplies' after all. Or I might be generous and settle for just the large box.
“Carl and Katy found the perfect place”, his nephew said, “near a town called Sandy in Bedfordshire. They want to start a family in a few years time once they are settled, but unfortunately the current owner is, the estate agent was kind enough to warn them, virulently anti-Semitic so they may well not be able to secure it.”
“This renewal of the Balkan War is bad”, I sighed as I read the paper one fine May Day. “They are saying now that it could drag in the whole Continent if people are not careful.”
“I have only met him the one time, many years ago”, Sherlock said, “although coming to this area today I fully expect that situation to be remedied very soon. To answer your other question, although this is very obviously your room there are signs that another gentleman is a frequent visitor. Also that the couch is a favoured place of you both.”
“I do not wish to see the earth from more than six feet away, thank you very much”, I said not at all frostily. “If God had meant for man to fly then he would have given him wings.”
“Because Sherlock here has enough on both the police and the government to make them think twice”, John said, cynically if accurately. “Otherwise that pest of a brother of his would be round like a shot!”
“It will be difficult but you will need to keep an eye on your husband today”, Sherlock said. “Even though I do not expect anything to be tried until tomorrow.”
Of course I was John Hamish Watson, which meant that I could not catch a break. Even though the red-hot passion of his return had faded to our usual gentle simmer – we were both in our fifties, damnation! – Sherlock spent virtually all his time when he was not looking for that damn jumper close by me and was visibly uneasy when we were apart. I even had to be in the garden when he tended to his bees as he said that he felt 'incomplete' with me out of sight. I of course felt the same but it made it nigh on impossible to get the jumper any further than the small tool-box in the front garden (I had to move it as sometimes certain, ahem, 'playthings' rolled under the bed when we.... you know). Nor did it help when his parents disobligingly wired back far too quickly saying that the dratted thing was indeed not in London. At least his fearsome mother did not send him one of her stories, although rather alarmingly she did indeed ask for more details about the jumper 'for her writings'. Gulp!
In June we were unfortunate enough to have more dealings with my least favourite Cornish ex-fisherman of all time, Mr. Laurence Trevelyan, of whom I was not the least bit jealous whatever anyone smirked... said. He had asked Sherlock if he could arrange for him and his silent brother Blaze to attend the opening of the new cathedral in Truro down in their native Cornwall and, despite the event being all sold out, Sherlock had duly gotten them in. Then some teasing bastard had suggested that he might invite the ogling rogue
Having seen my nephew in all his glory one day I knew that he could rival the great (in every sense!) Mr. Galahad LeStrade in one department. But it would be better not to mention that as it would doubtless make John feel..... John.
A natural son of Sir James Saunders, he learned that his father's will could be interpreted in such a way as to make him the heir, and having secured employment with him under false pretences he set out to attack his father's horse to try to drive him to an early grave so the family might then buy him off. He was preparing to administer the fatal poison to the animal when it stampeded to enjoy its storm, driving his syringe into his own body.
It only slowly dawned on me that Sherlock was holding a telegram which must have come while I was out. He looked up at me almost mournfully.
There was no sign of the ruffians when we returned to the station that evening but I was glad that we dropped in on the police-station on the way there and even gladder when Sergeant Richards said that he would accompany us. At the station we met the station-master again, who told us he had wired ahead for us and that Mr. Cowper would alight from the train to talk with us provided that the conversation was kept brief. In fact Sherlock spoke with the fellow for barely thirty seconds, then thanked him and paid him for his time.
The problem of Mr. Mycroft Holmes was unexpectedly solved by that gentleman himself when he went round to his ex-wife's house and
in the square at half-past four, and went to Mr. Patterson's to establish his alibi. Five hours later it was half-past-four New York time, half-past nine here in London, so Mr. Patterson could say that the sergeant had been with him between four and five – except he left out that he was using American time.”
After breakfast – and more sex-with-Sherlock-wearing-glasses – we took a cab to Liverpool Street Station and a Great Eastern Railway train all the way to King’s Lynn. From there it was on to the Midland & Great Northern Railway, and a positively antiquated train over which I had serious doubts. However the elderly locomotive moved a lot faster than it had looked capable of and it was not long before we were pulling into Biddleston Halt. The Hall could clearly be seen to the south of the nearby village so we walked the short distance in the pleasant autumn sunshine.
“You are right”, the sergeant said. “I would favour the other employee, Mr. Gerald Brown. Twenty-four, a right little know-all and – here's the good part – the previous recipient of Miss Ockham's favours before Mr. Leeds came to town and she upgraded to a better model. Our Mr. Brown thinks a great deal of himself, without much cause; Mr. Major made a point of telling me – twice – that there was no love lost between the two young men. Typically the sod has a pretty much watertight alibi for the time of the attack. He was helping out with a theatre group that he works with in town. He might have been able to slip away for a few minutes perhaps but nothing more. There's no way he can have left town and got back again, though like the others he could have hired someone else to do the attack. Sunday morning he also went to church and the vicar remembers talking to him as he left.”
“Actually it will have to be the week after”, he said. “Now they are both recovered, they are trying it again!”
“He lost two patients”, I explained. “Worse, a mother and her newborn daughter, and he had thought that he was close to saving the girl.”
“That was the Rubens sold at auction a few months back”, he said. “Purchased by a mystery buyer for an unknown amount but rumoured to be worth well into the thousands.”
To cap it all we had our fathers sat at the back of the room, far too close to each other as per usual. Isa had put aside a special cake for them and told them that yes, they could have that and a slice of the wedding-cake afterwards, but if they touched either before our daughter and her new husband – Michael, that was the fellow's name – cut it officially, then there would be Consequences. It had been frankly hilarious to see the two old codgers pouting as she had laid down the law to them like that.
“A military family through and through”, he said, his eyes widening slightly as he accurately (if belatedly) divined my intentions, “including various cousins also in the military. Scottish in origin as the name suggests but that branch has been in the Welsh March for many years now. Owen told me that the general was not best pleased that a daughter of his joined our profession, but as his wife had inherited a large sum as of her own right I suppose that she was able to skirt around that. Thankfully the law these days mean that she kept the money.”
After John had explained to me what my 'other' family, the Hawkes; had suffered from, I had I admit been fearful that the line might still die out. Of my three grandsons Tobias had married a lady who could not have children while Trelawney was still making my nephew Tantalus regret those nine years that he had on his insatiable younger lover (his last letter had been barely legible, but then it had been just after I had introduced my grandson to the delights of a certain Baker Street shop). With their sisters being married to gentlemen of only average calibre ('not half a clue between them!' John had quipped, which had been doubly annoying as the bastard had known that he was right!) that left just young Harry, now twenty-two, to continue the dynasty. Fortunately he had just married one Miss Geraldine Jephson, and my youngest grandson insisted on inviting us to his wedding even if, on our arrival, he for some reason asked us 'not to be
Ah yes, his 'arrangement' with Sheikh Khalid of Arbir, the popular ruler of a small but strategically situated Middle Eastern state. The sheikh had wished to restrict himself to the woman he loved so Sherlock's nephew had, so to speak, stepped up to the plate. Or rather up into the princely bed. At least one hundred and twenty-eight times according to the official records, the dog!
“Salerio's wife divorced him some years back and he took up with Lowen once the divorce was finalized”, he said airily. “As you know I helped Solario come over to join his brother, and they formed a very happy
The bane of Sherlock's existence finally went to Europe to try to stop the Great War. He ended his life in the Greco-Turkish Wars by getting into bed with the Greeks a little too literally, and was shot somewhere low and painful by an irate Macedonian soldier who had returned unexpectedly to find him 'debriefing' his daughter.
shot at a maid just because she had made me jump, nor had I ever accidentally shot myself in the foot! As for my worshipping a slice of chocolate cake, that had never happened, or even if it had it could never be proven. The fact that the few people watching seemed to find the portrayal highly amusing did not help either!
“Wait a minute”, the constable said. “Mr. Creighton left yesterday. I told you, Mr. Parker saw him off.”
That May we had a visit from my brother Stevie since Hetty was visiting her parents with young Mary and Stephen, and he had pointedly not been invited (he admitted that there may or may not have been a small celebration whisky around the time that his wife had told him that). We spent a very pleasant week together, although for some reason he insisted on lodging at The Majestic Duck rather than the cottage, and always shook his head at me when I met him in what may have been perhaps slightly less than perfect order of a morning. The only cloud in those blue Sussex skies was the knowledge of the terrible war that was still raging in the trenches not far to the south across the Channel.
One of the Merriman's Bank Robbery gang, he was captured by fellow member Miss Sharon Sannay and, when he refused to tell her where he had hidden the loot, she left him tied up in the bell-tower of Melton Constable Church just before the Sunday bell-ringing, from which the shock killed him. She later draped his body over the buffer-beams of a locomotive with the same name as one of the bells, Vici, to confuse matters.
An alibi for the time of the attack, I noted. Although whoever did it must have used hired thugs, so that meant little or northing.
My son was still dazed by recent events but he looked round in surprise when we alighted at Berwick and drove down the road through Chuffingden, finally stopping at one of the terraced houses that Sherlock had had built by the ford a few years back.
two, daddy; I can walk on my own!” - and Johnnie was already asleep bless him, so I looked round for our eldest son.
“No, their nephew who goes by the unusual name of Mr. Day Penmarrick”, I said, suppressing a smile at his reaction. “He works as a fisherman in the Cornish port of Mousehole some miles south of Penzance, and people there are concerned that the new Great Western omnibus service linking Newlyn to the town might be extended to them.”
“Large organizations are much the same everywhere”, Sherlock sighed. “I will contact Mr. Crowley and the Reverend Rival for you, and ask as to which of the miscreants they dislike the most and could benefit from some gaol time courtesy of a highly-able constable who 'just happened' to be passing when they were committing some terrible crime.”
“Your wife and children are waiting for you”, he reminded Ivan, “and you can of course call on us any time. Although it may be better if you let us know that you are coming.”
1912. John faces a quandary when he is warned that a family member of his may be about to die. He does nothing – but the means of death shocks the whole world.
I felt sorry for the innocent baby whose father had made such poor decisions in his life, yet I also felt something akin to relief. The thought of a blood relative of mine killing my fellow countrymen – it was horrible!
“We don't know what, though”, Mr. Bassett-Evans said, frowning. “They wouldn't shake hands with us afterwards, or even talk to us. Our coach went to their dressing-room to ask what the hell had been going on but they threw him out.”
“I rather think that you underestimate her”, Sherlock said. “But of course you could always explain things to her friend if you wished? We could even arrange for her to come up here.”
“Although I would much rather not discuss such matters”, I said looking at Mr. McCall, “my investigations into your father uncovered that he is even more of a brute than I had first thought, incredible though that seems. Your mother, alas, is one of those brave ladies who is resigned to her fate so I was compelled to do something rather unorthodox. A burglar friend of mine broke into her home and stole her diary which I then had copied before he returned it, undetected. I believed, and I was correct to believe, that she would use that book as an outlet for her sorrows at her so-called husband's foul treatment.”
“Upon entering the train heading back the way that she has just come, the apparently leonine young gentleman goes to the toilets and changes back into Miss Alexandra Ockham. Her disguise is abandoned somewhere along the line once the train is clear of the station; I do not think that she would have wished to wait for long so it may well be possible to find it.”
“I learned from my inquiries that on some railways – and fortunately the Midland Railway is one of them – each conductor has a personalized set of clippers”, Sherlock said. “Mr. Ethelbert Cowper who was on the train to Derby that Miss Ockham took on Sunday morning had 17A on his clippers, denoting the route that he worked as well as his personal letter. He duly clipped her ticket to Leicester shortly after her train left Wellingborough. She made a point of approaching him hoping that he would recognize her as Mr. Leeds and might later report the sighting to the police. When I asked Mr. Cowper, he did indeed confirm that a long-haired gentleman smelling rather strongly of cologne had insisted on having his ticket punched shortly after boarding the train at Wellingborough. Most annoyingly for Miss Ockham, the police did not fully check her alibi so did not talk to him. However it is but a minor annoyance to her; she proceeds to Leicester where she alights.”
“We shall take the boat out to Fair Isle tomorrow”, Sherlock said. “They make the most marvellous sweaters and I thought that we could buy some, and then celebrate my birthday.”
1903. Shock horror, as Sherlock is separated from John – but thankfully only for a few days. Of course the detective has to go and have a case in that short time, then races against the clock to sort matters out so he can go North to join his beloved.
Somehow I got through it, although when the general's carriage dropped Sherlock off at the door and he declined to come inside, I silently blessed the fellow. I was in the main room when Sherlock burst through the door and within seconds I had a blue-eyed genius all over me, panting as if he had run a race.
Bill snarled and advanced on him, but stopped dead at a look from his employer and scuttled back to his post with amazing speed for a fellow his size. I knew that my nephew Tantalus was enamoured of both young men despite.... well, despite the obvious, and after his long 'sessions' liked to relax in a bath with both of them.
“It came about because of Ruth's brother Drake”, he said. “He has a farm in the Clun Valley near where we were stationed at the time of Scott's disappearance. Their eldest son Derek reached twenty-one recently and came to visit me here just after. He had been having some trouble with some of the local youths who had been teasing him over his hair, so I had some of the boys drop round and put things to rights.”
“I think a visit to the shop owner is called for”, Sherlock said. “I will need your medical expertise to back me up. I may have to stretch the truth just a little.”
“You mentioned that you were held for a long time at one station”, I said carefully. “Was it Darsham, by any chance?”
His voice had that terrible calmness which surely even someone of my brother's complete lack of brains should have spotted. But no.
“Mr. Gable had married twice, both wives having predeceased him. His first died after only a short time – an illness, I am not sure what – but his second provided him with some ten children. They were however a sickly brood and only three made it to adulthood, a girl Helen and the boys Aeneas and Troilus. One can only presume that either he or the second Mrs. Gable considered themselves Greek scholars.”
Born in 1966, the eldest son of Baron Harry II. Was elevated to an earl in 2020 for his good works. His eldest son is Tobias (b. 1986) and the latter's eldest son is Lion (b. 2007).
Mr. Holmes was able to help me with a few pointers to the robbery, though my own damn father pouted when I got a slice of what was obviously his (or his cuddle-bunny's) cake to take back to the station with me. Then just when I was congratulating myself on a successful visit, Doctor Watson quite deliberately dropped into the conversation that that whelp Tobias had been round already and had snaffled a slice for himself.
“The doctor will bring his test results back this evening”, Sherlock said. “Unless they contain something very surprising then the other chemical too will also be relatively harmless. You see, it is the
“Because he had not yet appeared in the obituary pages!” Sherlock grinned. “Mother has decided that she is in favour of women having the vote, which of course means that Father will be too. Shall we start our picnic?”
The old soldier and his lover Mr. Daniel Hunter had moved recently to Godwinsford, the village near to Dibley where Mr. Hunter's friend Mr. De Klerk (whom we had helped out in the Sussex Vampire case) lived. The latter had married his lady since our encounter with him and now had a son named after him, which happy event had been followed by an even happier one when the harridan Mrs. Mabel Willenden had left the village for a retirement cottage somewhere. Hopefully in Outer Mongolia!
I blushed for some reason. So I sometimes graciously allowed Sherlock to hold me in a manly embrace on our own couch because he liked that sort of thing. And?
“We would be delighted to investigate this matter for you”, Sherlock said. “We have your addresses here and in Westmorland and shall telegraph you any news. Whatever that news may be.”
“The doctor has just realized what I found out from Mr. Tudor”, my nephew said gravely. “Trey's foul father-in-law recently purchased a controlling interest in the 'Clarion', that weekly rag that calls itself a newspaper. His daughter will use that connection to make any divorce as unpleasant and costly as possible.”
Mr. Malone and Mrs. Malone had gone out for a drive so we took a walk along the sea-front before returning to Rensselaer and telling them all. I looked north to where the downs began, and sighed. Somewhere out there was a beautiful cottage just for us, and we were so close.
“Perhaps”, Mr. Jukes conceded. “It would have been very like him. The will went on to say that I was entitled to at least ten per cent of the rest of the estate and that each of my cousins now had a choice; they could take one of the items or draw lots if two or more of them went for that option, they could have thirty quid‡ hard cash, or they could take thirty per cent of the estate. I would get any bits of the estate that they did not want, which I thought generous at first until the lawyer gave them a valuation of the estate as it stood at my father's death – pretty much nothing!”
And the bastard set about finishing his bacon leaving me gasping for breath. Though not as much as I was gasping for breath later. Seriously, they made candy-striped panties these days?
On Monday morning what was left of me hobbled very slowly back down to the village. Thank the Lord (and Lowen) that the cottage had been fully stocked for our time there; it had saved us precious time and what would have been some painfully long walks to get food. Judging from the look that someone was giving me as we waited for the 'bus, that first-class compartment was going to be well-used on our return home. As was I!
It was not just our old home that was passing out of our lives never to return, I thought as I looked around the bustling Victoria Station. London, which had been central to so many of our cases and my home for even longer than 221B, also now seemed like another country, one that we might still visit from time to time but to which we did not truly belong.
…. until he flipped me with his inhuman strength and stared down hungrily at me. I was already hard, but the sight of my lover naked except for those glasses and towering over me was wonderful. He felt around my entrance, and raised an eyebrow when he found the plug,
to the Downs where there were some wonderful views across the English Channel. And down over the town of Seaford, but one could not have everything.
Sherlock looked up at me in surprise, his hot chocolate still frothing around his mouth. He really was a grub at times.
“John suspected, but we did not know about you until she asked for our help on the matter of your grandfather Colonel Warburton's poisoning at the start of 1889”, Sherlock said. “She had married the man that you knew as your father very soon after the relationship, and when John saw the four-year-old you, he knew. The anonymous relative who put money into that lump sum you received on your twenty-first birthday was of course him.”
“For her part in an attempt to extort money from you, sir”, I said. “She was one half of a highly professional scheme which, had it succeeded, would have greatly benefited her partner in crime.”
Yes, that was cynical of me – and as it turned out, absolutely correct as per usual. At the end of August Mrs. Leeds wrote to tell me that his grandfather the colonel had fallen gravely ill and as the outlook was seemingly terminal she asked to wait until he had passed. She did reiterate her promise that she would tell Ivan the truth, and although I did not like the delay I had had little choice but to accept it. Although I still feared the worst.
