“Yes, Dean?” Dean took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves. “How come some boys like other boys?” John didn’t answer at first. “Well, Dean, some boys are born what they call gay. In my opinion they are born wrong. A man is supposed to be with a woman, no acceptions. It is freaking disgusting what they do, and you should stay away from it.” Dean didn’t understand what was so wrong about liking a boy.
“Cas, promise me you’ll never leave me again?”
“No,” Dean noticed Cas’s cheeks were heating up. “I haven't either. I’m too little. But when I’m old enough can...can I kiss you?” Cas tried to hide his smile. “I would like that, Dean.” Dean felt the butterflies tingling in his stomach. “If we get married, it won’t be weird right? Since, you’re an angel and I’m a human?”
“Cas, I’m not an angel. I’m human, I need to sleep.” Dean realized he had made Cas upset. “Hey, I’m sorry, it’s been a bad day. I’m really glad you’re okay. You look a lot better.”
“Of course, Dean.”
“Yes. You are my best friend, Dean.” Dean had never been this happy in his life. A best friend is something he had wanted for years. And now he finally had one. “You’re mine too, Cas.”
“Promise.”
“Oh, Cas. Where are you?”
“Cas please,” he would say, “I need you here. I don’t even know if you’re alive, but if you are I know you can hear me. I don’t know what I did to scare you away, but I’m sorry. I miss you so much. Nothing is the same without you. I’m scared, Cas. I can’t do this alone. Please come back feathers.” Of course, there was never an answer.
“Are you kidding? Cas, you have wings! Those are way cooler than stupid freckles.” Cas smiled, shyly. “Can...can I see them?” Dean had not seen Cas’s wings since the day that they met, now almost two years ago. Suddenly with a bright flash of light, Cas’s big fluffy wings appeared before him. “Wow!” Dean was mesmerized by the millions of feathers that grew out of his friends back. “They’re amazing, Cas.”
“You could hear that?” Cas nodded. “I am an angel, Dean. If you ever need me, just pray, and I’ll be there.” Dean wished he would’ve known that sooner. “Well, just be careful next time. So, what are you gonna do? You can’t come to class with me.”
The man stepped closer to Dean, reaching his hand out to touch his face. Dean felt sparks of electricity fly through his body, feeling this touch that he craved for so many years. Finally, the man spoke. “There are those freckles I missed so much.” Hearing those words overflowed Dean with emotions, causing him to fall into the man’s arms and cry. “C-Cas, I m-missed you so m-much.” Cas wrapped his arms around the crying man, resting his chin on Dean’s head. “I missed you too, freckles.”
“I know, I just thought there might be something good out there.”
“Cas! I’m so glad you’re here!” Dean’s smile stretched from ear to ear. Cas squinted his eyes, looking at Dean’s shirt. “What is that giant circle on your shirt?”
Dean crawled out of the Earth, gasping for air. He looked around, unsure where he was. Just moments ago, he was suffering in Hell, and now he seemed to be back on Earth. “What the hell?” he mumbled to himself. He went to the nearest payphone he could find, immediately calling Sammy. After a painfully long phone call, the brother finally reunited.
“Trust me I’d love to know.” He felt a strange burning on his arm. He peeled back his shirt to reveal a large red handprint, covering his bicep. “What the hell is that?”
“It’s The Death Star!” Cas clearly did not understand Dean’s reference. “Star Wars? Don’t tell me you’ve never seen Star Wars?” Cas shook his head. “Dude, I was gonna watch it for my birthday, you have to join me! It’s the best movie ever!”
“Well, dude, back up. Personal space.” Cas squinted his eyes and slowly took a step back. He still had much to learn about humanity. “Well, Cas, I’ve gotta be getting back to Sam so you better go. He doesn’t know about the supernatural and I don’t need an angel walking around our motel room.” Without saying a word, Cas was gone.
“Well, technically I’m an angel, so I’m not really a boy or a girl. All I know is I like you. And I like you a lot, Dean.” This made Dean very happy. How could it be so wrong if he like Cas. Cas was awesome. He slowly leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. “I thought you said we couldn’t kiss till we’re older?” Dean giggled.
A few painful days later, Cas appeared in the middle of the night, startling Dean. “Cas! You need to stop doing that!”
Eleven Years Later
“I don’t have a choice, Dean.” Dean hung his head low, understanding what Cas was going through. If he was being honest, he didn’t want to be a hunter. He wanted a normal life, with real friends, and a family. But he didn’t have a choice. “I’m sorry, Cas. Hey, I’ve gotta go pick up my brother. Please come by later.” Cas faintly nodded, avoiding eye contact. And like that, he was gone.
“Cool. What’s his name?”
“I like you too much.”
“Two days from now. But don’t make a big deal about it. No one really does.”
“When’s your birthday, Dean?”
“Cas?” Dean croaked through the tears, “I’m so happy you’re here. We’ll always be best friends forever, right?”
“I told you. Kids are mean. Don’t worry about it.”
“That’s...that’s how I feel about your freckles, Dean.”
“You do?”
“Oh, you’re not getting away that easy. Where’s your best friend, Castiel now?” The three boys surrounded him, causing Dean to shield his face in fear. He shut his eyes, as a single tear rolled down his cheek. He was surprised to hear a familiar voice. “Leave him alone.” It was Cas.
Dean held his breath as he entered the school, praying he would go unnoticed. He could hear his heart beating in his ears, as he walked quickly down the hallway. “Hey, Dean!” Please, not today, he thought to himself. He kept walking, not looking back. He felt two hands push his back, causing him to fall to the ground. “Oh sorry, didn’t see you there, Winchester.” Dean looked down at his leg, and saw blood spilling onto the concrete. “Why can’t you just leave me alone?”
“Thank you, Dean. I’m really sorry I wasn’t there for you. What happened?” Dean’s stomach twisted in knots as the memories flooded his mind. “People are just mean. It’s hard moving around a lot. People always think it’s funny to be mean to the new kid. I don’t have any friends.” Cas perked up. “I’m your friend, Dean.”
Dean buried his hands in his face, while tears dripped through his hands and onto the floor. “Dean, I’m so sorry.” Cas slowly wrapped his arm around Dean, pulling him close. Dean laid his head on his shoulder and continued to cry. They laid there for a minute, just holding each other.
Five Years Later
“Castiel. But I call him Cas. He’s super cool, he’s an angel. He has these really big, fluffy wings and stuff.” Little Sammy’s eyes widened at Dean’s story. He wanted an imaginary friend just like Cas. “Hey, Sammy, can you watch some TV or something real quick? I’ve gotta go do something.” Sam nodded and plopped himself down in front of the TV.
Sometimes it would get so bad, he thought about taking his own life. He figured he’d go straight to Heaven and would finally get to see Cas again. But it was Sammy who always stopped him. He knew he couldn’t leave him alone with John like that.
“I’m an angel of the Lord. And I’ve been sent here to speak with you, Dean.” Dean didn’t believe what he was hearing. This had to be a trick. “Angel? There’s no such thing. My daddy told me so.” Castiel tilted his head slightly in confusion. Suddenly, bright white lights flashed like lightning, and large, feathery wings appeared behind the small boy. “Do you believe me now?” Dean could hardly speak. “W-why are you here?”
“Hey, Dean! What did you draw?” Sammy asked, noticing the drawing Dean had left on the table. “Oh, that’s just a drawing for school. It’s my, um, imaginary friend.”
“I heard you.” Dean’s tone rose, “You heard me? You fucking heard me? I thought you were dead, Cas! I thought...I thought you hated me! You don’t understand the pain you’ve caused me.” Dean couldn’t contain all of these feelings he had built up over the years and punched Cas right in the nose, knocking him off his feet. “How could you?”
A few hours into the night Dean was awakened by a dark presence in the room. When he opened his eyes he saw Cas sitting there on the bed. “Cas! What are you doing here? You almost gave me a heart attack! Never do that again.” Dean looked over at Sammy to make sure he was still asleep. “My apologies, Dean. I waited until Sam was asleep so I could talk to you.”
“I’m an angel, Dean. I can heal people.”
Pamela arranged a ritual so she could speak with this powerful creature. “I think I found him.” Dean leaned in closer, anxiety coursing through his veins. “Castiel?” she uttered. Dean froze in his seat, unable to speak. His heart began racing and the blood rushed from his face, leaving him looking like he’d seen a ghost. “Hey, Dean. Didn’t you used to have an imaginary friend named Castiel?” Dean looked at Sam with tears in his eyes, then turned to Pamela. “Is it him? Is it really Cas?”
“I didn’t think you were gonna come back.” Dean was surprised to hear himself say this. Why did he care if Cas showed up or not? “I’ve been busy up in Heaven. How are you?”
“Fraid not.” Dean bit his tongue, forcing himself to not speak a word of Cas. But boy did he want to.
The next day was worse than the first. Dean was continuously bullied throughout the day, with still no sign of Cas. He tried his best to hide himself in the back of the classroom, and when the teacher announced they were going to be presenting their best friend projects he nearly puked. “Dean, it’s your turn.” He slowly stood up and stumbled to the front of the class.
Cas wiped the blood away and slowly got back on his feet. “Dean, listen to me. I didn’t have a choice, okay? Of course I wanted to come back and see you. I wanted it more than anything. But my brothers said I was getting too close to you and they feared I was beginning to express human emotions. So they forced me to stay up in Heaven.”
When they rolled into the new town, John dropped Dean off at a nearby elementary school. “Bye, Dean. The daycare is just around the block, don’t forget pick up Sam there after school.” He nodded and John drove away. Dean was used to new schools every few weeks, but he always felt a little anxious walking in on the first day. I wish Cas were here right now, he thought to himself. Suddenly, Cas appeared right next to him in the middle of the school hallway. “Hello, Dean.” Dean grabbed Cas’s arm and dragged him into the nearest bathroom.
Dean and Cas began hanging out every night after Sammy went to bed. Dean was tired from the lack of sleep, but Cas made it all worth it. Dean couldn’t deny that he was developing a small crush on the angel. “Have you ever liked anyone, Cas?”
If he was being honest, Dean barley watched the movie. He was so focused on Cas, making sure he was reacting in the right way. He’d say, “did you see that?” or “wasn’t that awesome?” every once in a while. He never noticed how blue Cas’s eyes were until that night. Dean really liked the color blue. Cas simply nodded and smiled. Cas didn’t like the movie as much as spending time with Dean. That’s what made him truly happy.
“Of course.” Dean pulled his angel into a hug, never wanting to let go. He didn’t understand what he did to deserve someone so wonderful. I’m the luckiest kid in the world, he thought. “Dean, I’m sorry but I’ve got to go. I’ll see you later, freckles.” Dean liked this new nickname.
“I can just wait here for you.”
“It’s ok. I’m really glad you’re here now. There’s something I need to talk to you about.” Dean grabbed Cas’s hand and took him outside. “Cas, there...there is something wrong with me. I’m, um…” Cas could see Dean was struggling, and grabbed onto his hands, attempting to comfort him. “You can tell me, Dean.”
A few weeks went by and still no sign of Castiel. Dean was convinced he had dreamt it all up. Angels, he thought to himself. Yea right. He was out getting food for him and Sam when the angel suddenly appeared. “Cas?” Dean said, unintentionally giving the boy a nickname. “Hello, Dean.”
“Well, I heard your prayer.” Dean didn’t understand. “Prayer? What prayer?”
“You’d wait here that long? For me?”
Dean smiled. “Yes you are, Cas. And that makes me very happy.” Dean stood up and pulled Cas into a hug. “What is this?” Cas asked, not hugging back. “It’s called a hug, you idiot. You’re supposed to hug back.” Cas slowly wrapped his arms around Dean, nuzzling his head into his neck. They stayed there for a minute, swaying in each other’s arms. “I like hugs,” Cas mumbled, auditing a small laugh from Dean.
“Dean, I don’t understand. I mean I’m beyond thrilled, don’t get me wrong, but how?”
“Of course.” Dean felt a strange feeling in his stomach, like butterflies. Why would Cas do that for him? No one has ever waited for him before. Especially not his dad. “Thanks, Cas. Hey, you can come play on the playground with me at recess! You’ll blend right in, it will be fun!” Cas agreed and Dean headed off to class, feeling a lot less anxious than he had before.
He hated the long car drives, especially lately. When he was bored at the motel he could just pray to Cas, and he would show up. But he couldn’t do that here. Not with Sam and Dad. Maybe someday he could introduce him to them. “Dad? Are angels real?” Dean asked, curious of what he might say.
“Wake up, Sammy. Time to get up.” He didn’t expect Sam to remember, since he was only four years old. I guess I’ll be celebrating alone this year. Dean sat Sam down in front of the TV while he went to go get breakfast. “You stay right there, I’ll be back.” He was surprised to see Cas standing outside when he opened the door. “Happy birthday, Dean!” He handed Dean a large bag. “Open it.” Dean pulled out a beautiful leather jacket, that look just like his fathers. “Cas! How did you know?”
Dean couldn’t believe Castiel, his best friend, was sitting there right in front of him after all these years. “You have some goddamn explaining to do.” Cas could barely look him in the eye. He didn’t speak, causing Dean to become more upset. “I prayed to you, Cas, every night.” Tears began to well in his eyes.
“They say if I want to be big and strong like them someday, I have to learn how to fight. But it’s s-scary, Dean.” Cas was crying now. “Can’t you tell them you don’t want to?”
“Class, this is our new student, Dean Winchester.” Dean awkwardly smiled and made his way to the back of the class. He watched the clock, anxiously waiting to meet Cas out on the playground. Time couldn’t go fast enough.
“No, I’m not okay, Cas. Why did it have to be today? I know he’s a mean drunk, and he doesn’t mean what he says, but why did it have to be today?” Dean had experienced drunk John far too many times before. Sometimes when it got really bad, he had to protect Sammy.
A man came walking forward, dressed in a long brown trench coat. Neither of them said a word.
He couldn’t take it anymore. These thoughts, and memories. He rummaged through his things in the back of the impala. He pulled out the old crumpled up drawing he had made of him and Cas long ago. He pulled out his lighter, and watched the paper burn. Cas was never coming back, and he knew that now. A single tear trickled down his cheek. He vowed that day to never pray to Cas again.
“Nonsense. If even half the rumours I’ve heard about the Winchester boys are true, you’ve done your share of saving. But you know, you don’t have to go it alone. I’m not the only one who would lend a hand if the call came.”
“We’re better at it now,” said Cas. “Though Dean keeps warning me he’s bound to fuck up one day.”
Jack stopped himself from saying anything further, swallowing back his words.
“You did?” said Sam.
He ventured out the next morning. Found a small sack that contained a silky shiftiness—the sands of time. And a long feather, white at the base, but shifting into the black of an oil slick, catching the sun in a darkened rainbow. He traced his thumb carefully against the edge of the feather, surprised at the holy flutter in his own chest.
“You’re looking at Stanford,” said Young Dean, like he couldn’t hold it back. Despite his private oath not to say too much, this was past keeping in. “I didn’t mention it to you or anything, and maybe you’ll pick somewhere else since… since your options are different.”
Past-Cas turned his head to Young Dean, a smile touching his mouth. For his part, Young Dean felt giddy, nearly hysterical. Two years—five if you counted Tír na nÓg—and here was the realization of all his searching. He wouldn’t know what to do with himself, from here.
“And you’re Dean, I take it,” said Holden, reaching his hand out to shake.
“She’s not your type, though, right?” said Dean.
“Well, I don’t know what it is, but it doesn’t look like nothing,” said Holden. “Come on, now, take a seat.” He beckoned them with an arm back into the shaded picnic area.
They finished their breakfast, bid Jody and Claire farewell, then went back to research. It was different this time, making rapid progress now that they had a focus. Now that they had some traction, Young Dean was as interested as anybody. In the space of a few hours they had the right books open on the table, pages pulled up on computer screens, and notes taken down in Essie’s quick hand.
Cas studied the stars again, but it was a way of not answering. Dean waited it out. Cas’ lashes dipped lower over his eyes and he wasn’t looking at the sky anymore, but his eyes moved with a look of reading, of recollection. Drafting and discarding replies until finally he said, “You mean that.”
Beyond the flash of light in his eyes—nothing more than smoke and mirrors, a parlour trick for someone as powerful as Chuck—there’d been no sign of Amara’s character in Chuck. He’d only been more himself than before, more powerful and unrestricted by any equal.
“I’m not sure which of us you’re trying to get through to right now,” said Dean. “Cas, can’t you just leave this? Go power-down to power-up again, would you?”
“Get off,” Sam said, pushing Young Dean back. “I can
Young Dean stepped out of the bunker and into the warm air of a Kansas night. He took in a breath, the scent of early summer filling his lungs. Cas was a step behind him, but Young Dean paused so that Cas could lead the way on their walk. Cas automatically veered for a small footpath that cut across a fallow field, well-worn and familiar.
“Who?” asked Dean. Sure, that word ‘hunter’ acted like a secret code. It gained a person some measure of credibility. It kept Dean from cutting this guy loose right now. But it wasn’t enough on its own. “If I were to call him up and ask him if he knows you, what exactly would he tell me?”
“Hey, Cas,” said Holden. He placed a hand over his chest beseechingly. “Not to be a total rube or anything, but is a trip to the top of one of these hills out of the question?”
“Stop it,” said Cas. And if Dean thought his expression was intense before, it was nothing to now. The blue eyes lost nothing of their power even as they narrowed in assessment. “Stop being scared.”
There was a calm stillness to him that made Young Dean’s chest ache. Cas was used to long nights on his own, living amongst humans but never one of them. Gifted at going into his thoughts, at purposefully taking himself out of the way until someone decided he was needed for something. Perhaps life on Earth wasn’t solely responsible. He’d had millions of years as an angel: time that could not always have been spent in heavenly wars or fulfilling divine commands. It must have made him used to standing by, to waiting on someone to require him and give him purpose.
“Am I shuttle service, now?” Cas asked.
- “A Memory of Europe,”
“They want the Arimaspoi removed,” said Young Dean. “They’ve encroached on their land. It says we cannot trust the Arimaspoi.”
“Close,” said Cas. “2020.” Not close, thought Dean, but he rolled with it.
“We got the sword, man,” said Dean. He smiled wide, lit with the thrill of success after months of searching. He twisted the front of his shirt in his hands to wring out water. “You did it. Hell if I know how.”
Lawry answered: “Sorry, your name doesn’t ring a bell. Have we met somewhere?”
That’s when he did it. When he went from lazily parrying blows to a full-on affront. It was like he’d flipped a switch, became a machine. Young Dean barely had time to react, couldn’t strike out because he was so busy trying to prevent blows from landing. The moves were familiar, all his own, but harder and smarter and quicker than he’d ever delivered them before. Dean clipped him more than once, kept throwing him off balance so that Young Dean was stumbling just to stay on his feet, let alone find a stance with any power to it. When he tried to get a good punch in, Dean caught him harder than before. In a flash he had Young Dean’s arm twisted up behind his back, his whole body turned, and Dean stood just behind him, his condescending snarl in Young Dean’s ear.
“Share what?” said Dean from his place on the couch.
“Most angelic attention is on the recent business at the Gates of Heaven,” said Castiel. “There is some considerable tension on account of it. However, the temporary closure also requires fathomless amounts of paperwork, which has improved everybody’s dispositions.”
Sam’s face clouded over at the mention of her name. He bowed his head, mouth going tight, and he gave a heavy sort of nod. “Mm,” he said. “She’s, um. She’s gone to the other side.”
“I know what you’re thinking right now,” said Dean, circling Young Dean, blocking his hits as they came, not breaking the rhythm of his speech for a moment. “You think you’re young and can bounce back from a hit. You think you can just wear me out. You think you’ve got speed on your side. That when I try to throw a punch, I’ll be slower, just slow enough to leave an opening, like the old guys you’re used to fighting in the back alleys of bars. But here’s the thing…”
“You here for a visit or something?” Sam asked. He looked at Young Dean. “Did everything go okay with the sword?”
that if Dean thought about it for too long, if he thought beyond the corporeal vessel Cas inhabited, any reciprocated connection with him seemed an impossibility.
Dean approached one of the saplings. It stirred as he neared. The same wind that eased through the forest to brush through Dean’s hair rippled the leaves and branches. “There are souls in here?” he asked.
“And you can’t return me till you're juiced up again? That’s what it sounded like, from what they said.”
“Yeah, man,” said Dean. “We’ll do that. Of course we will.”
When they met, they encamped together. He was, they told him, in the land of Tír na nÓg, an Irish Otherworld. Some of the party lived there many hundreds of years and hadn’t aged a day. Lady Josephine no longer knew how long she’d been here, and sometimes believed that the world she left behind was a dream or a strange bedtime story. They said there were other humans who had appeared or disappeared over the years. Many arrived by accident, but some had come on purpose in search of the Land of Youth. All were subject to the tricks of the capricious Immortals.
Dean tried for a dirty look, but when Cas saw it, briefly turning his head to take it in, he answered with a laugh. Loose and easy, smile lingering on his face even as he looked thoughtfully back up at the ceiling. “How is that antiserum?” he asked.
“That smart mouth is gonna land you in trouble,” Dean said.
“I’m not going to invoke Nana’s wrath by being a bad hostess, on the off-chance she’s still around,” said Wallis.
The morning set in sunny, warm, and dry; perfect driving weather. Young Dean led them from the apartment to where his station wagon was parked on a side street. Dean slowed when he realised which vehicle Young Dean was making for.
“I mean I fucking time-travelled, man,” said Dean.
“Alright,” said Dean. “That’s alright Sammy. We’re just gonna hold tight here, out of the way. Okay?”
“Lawry Novak,” said Cas. “He— He died in 1998.”
“I dispute that,” Castiel said. “All I know is that I’m playing cards with Dean Winchester and no one will tell me the name, the rules, or the purpose of the game. I know there are cards, but not what any of them mean. Is anyone winning? I’m making it up as I go along.”
Dean combed his fingers through his hair. Below the table, his foot bobbed restlessly. “See, I thought about this angel, Cas. How some version of him oughtta be around here, in the present. So I called him in, got him in on my half-cocked plan. I made him bring me to the future again. See, Future You was missing after the griffin hunt and I thought it was my job to find you since Future Dean and Future Cas hadn’t yet.”
“We’ll take it under advisement,” said Sam.
Eli slowed to a stop. “What does he look like?”
Dean took the lead easily, coming down the front steps to be at her level. “Sure,” he said with a game smile. “We’re new hereabouts. We just bought some land nearby to start a vineyard, thought we’d get to know the place. Meet our neighbours.” Her body language remained guarded, but Dean always talked until he found an opening. “Want to make sure we get a solid start in this town. Know where to find a good cup of joe, find the right church, that kind of thing.”
Breathing was something Dean had to remind himself to do. “I don’t want to be miserable,” he murmured. His thumb brushed at Cas’ cheek.
“Cas,” said Dean. “I’d like to meet you in my world. If I called you, would you come visit?”
It was only a few minutes later that the sound of angel wings announced Past-Cas once more, this time with a very dusty Sam in tow.
The girl entered the restaurant in high dudgeon, but notably had the courtesy not to take it out on Bonnie, the efficient waitress on the other side of the counter.

“You should. He’s you. He’s… Dean, he’s so young. Are you sure about this?”
“We’re gonna stay out here.”
The plan was to get as far as Kentucky today, splitting the twelve-plus hours of driving between them. An early start with a few healthy breaks and they’d be able to check into a motel in decent time. In the kitchen, Cas made coffee. He’d taken over this task in the past few weeks after telling Sam, not gently, that his coffee was ‘untenable’ and ‘an offense to nature.’
“Hey!” Dean closed the small remaining distance, reaching down desperately to pull Young Dean back to the surface. The water soaking his clothes made him heavy, as did the burden of the sword. Dean wrapped both arms around him, pulling him upright. Young Dean clutched the sword tight to his chest, spluttered water, and shivered. He needed all of Dean’s help in staggering out of the waves again, back to the sand with Sam and Cas.
“I want to spare him the suffering.” Cas’ eyes turned up towards Dean, plaintive and sincere. “I’d try to spare you from suffering, too. If I thought it would get me anywhere.”
“Building off the Bobby-model, I see,” said Cas.
“I was just thinking about him,” Young Dean said with an unconvincing wince. “I wasn’t doing it on purpose.”
“I don’t see anything,” said Past-Cas, craning past Young Dean and lowering his head to squint out his window. Meanwhile, Castiel inelegantly pulled away from Young Dean’s hands.
“Why’d we never do this before?” he asked. “Go out to a lake or a beach and just take a dip?”
“Dean?” This voice came from one of the two bedrooms just off the short hallway. Teenaged Sam leaned out his door, then came out fully. His eyes widened at the sight of the older Dean, looking between the matching pair of them.
“And whether it’s both guys and girls in general or whether it’s just… just Cas, that’s all… I just want you to be happy, Dean.”
“So after nineteen. Alright. When’s the worst time?”
“Autocorrect keeps turning ‘fucking’ into ‘ducking’ on my phone,” said Dean. “Don’t know if that’s your best example.”
“Not a teenager,” said Young Dean. “Catch up with you later.” He hung up the call and Sam sat back again with his phone, clearing the screen.
“Betty, I know it down to my bones,” said Dean. “Now he didn’t look like what I thought. Fluffy wings. Golden harp. Matter of fact, he looked like a normal man.”
“We also visited a bookstore,” Cas said, eyes flicking to Dean as he closed the trunk of the Impala. “He finds the car confining and strange, which it is. I told him he’d one day find the creative endeavours of humans quite inspiring.
Dean shot him an annoyed look. He knew himself, and he knew there was an implicit criticism in the comment. “Yeah, I’m aware.”
“Hey,” said Dean, hitherto ignored by the angels. “You let him go. I don’t know who you are but he hasn’t done anything.” He made for Cas, careless of the hard expressions of his jailers, only to be frozen in place by a raised hand from Zachariah. It hit him like a blow to the chest: not just his feet sticking in place, but a pressure surrounding his torso that turned his breath shallow. Like another twitch of Zachariah’s fingers and the force would cave in Dean’s chest. He turned his panicked eyes to Cas. His face looked grey, a forelock of hair sweeping lank across his forehead. He tried weakly to twist in his cuffs, in the grasp of the angels.
“What was it about?” Cas asked.
“I should’ve asked you two for help,” said Jack. “I should’ve told you what I was going to do. And you could’ve stepped in before I messed everything up and shown me where I was wrong.”
“Which room?” said Cas.
“Nobody’s said they love me in a long time,” said Young Dean. He swallowed hard, the words too thick in his throat.
Cas’ eyes remained narrowed for a moment, then he gave a nod of his head.
“You won’t remember it,” said Cas. “I’m sure of that.”
“Waylon, please,” said Jack. And when Jack said it like that, no one could really deny him. “We know something happened. We don’t want anyone else to get hurt.”
Dean had put a lot of trust in her not to double-cross them. He didn’t let go of Jack even as he sought to make a study of her inscrutable eyes. She had twice the power of a god. More, she’d said, than she could hold for long. He’d had no choice but to take her at her word.
Lanie’s posture shifted dramatically from suspicion to irritation, rolling her eyes and taking a step back. “Did she send you after me?” she asked. She pinched the bridge of her nose, bowing her head. “This is a step too far. I told her I’ve got this case covered.”
. Seeing his past self was one thing, more eerie than anything, but the young version of his little brother? Sam had never quite grown older in Dean’s eyes, or so Dean thought till now.
“Dry out, more like,” Young Dean said with a laugh. “Food first, guys, I’m serious.” He stumbled a few steps forward, slapping a palm against Dean’s chest a little harder than intended as he passed him by. “That moonshine oughtta be chased with food. It’s gonna burn through my stomach lining if I don’t eat something.”
He wouldn’t waste time cataloguing his surroundings. What about the people? Mary was real. He just knew Mary was real. The fact of his certainty on that matter, and that matter alone, was what troubled him. Because if he looked at her and felt the assurance settle in his bones that she was real, it was because he didn’t find it in anybody else.
That Friday, Cas was invited to dinner at the Winchesters’. They still went to the diner after practice, and he convinced Dean to have a heaping slice of pie between his second and third shake, saying that he could just go easier than usual on dinner. Dean had to undo his belt again, let his stomach expand as needed, and when he re-buckled, it was on a notch looser. The last one. Castiel gave him a secret belly rub under the table and whispered praises in his ear.
Sam fell silent, face red as Dean hefted up his gigantic gut with his arms. Groaning at the weight of his stomach, Dean shuffled around as he slowly pivoted to sit the right way in the booth. His chins wobbled as his breath came faster; his belly was fucking
“Excuse me, Dean?”
"I like cooking, and I like eating, and I'm almost forty, you dick, so sorry if I don't have rock hard abs! And I also happen to like my body, thank you very fuckin' much, so if you don't-"
Dean was startled out of his thoughts by an obnoxious voice. Prepared to give another college kid a piece of his mind - or at least let him down easy, if he apologized real fast - Dean spun around to face the bluest eyes he'd ever seen in his life.
He was right, more or less. Dean’s belly barely squeezed out over his belt and his love handles crushed the waistband. Cas unbuckled his belt and the snap buttons popped open immediately, Dean’s belly dropping and taking up the space it needed, and Dean sighed as he rubbed the red marks where the waistband had been constricting him.
"Sit up," Cas said, swirling patterns on Dean's gut with his pointer finger. "I want to try something."
did he have a dirty mouth on him. He shook Dean's gut and Dean whined again, wondering what he’d gotten himself into, though he wasn't complaining.
"Oh crap," Cas heard from the doorway, and he turned to see Dean standing there with pink cheeks. "Sorry, man, I didn't know you were changing."
From then on, the bakery became the destination of Dean's daily walks. He'd haul his fat ass down four blocks at a snail's pace, give himself a short rest to make sure his breathing was even and face no longer red, and then push through the door into heaven on earth, despite the name. He'd flirt with the hot cashier, place his order, and settle into a booth by the window. The cashier would bring him his food - something he only did for Dean, he couldn't help but notice - and Dean would thank him, and then he'd tuck into his feast.
The first thing Dean did when he got home was strip off his pants. He had to practically peel himself out of them, wincing as he rubbed at the angry red marks left under his belly and around his hips. He changed into his ‘me day’ attire to cheer himself up — his set of silk pajamas that he was was not ashamed to own in the least — and flushed when he had to leave the bottoms untied to fit around his chubby middle. And when said middle made teeny gaps between his shirt buttons. Ugh, these were supposed to be his sexy clothes.
Ignoring the obvious joke in there, Dean gave the adult response. "Bailey's, Kahlúa, and Amaretto with whipped cream."
Dean had always been an enthusiastic eater, but in the past few months his appetite had increased exponentially. He ate multiple servings of dinner, ordered two meals (at the very least) at diners and rest stops, and never left a crumb on his plate. He'd taken to leaning back in his chair when he ate, unintentionally showing off the fullness of his gut, all in an effort to cram more food into his stomach.
Sam's face heated up with a slight flush. He'd always loved to keep in shape, running every morning since his freshman year of high school and going to the gym whenever possible. Both of their parents were pretty fit too, and Dean's ex-girlfriend had been a yoga instructor. You'd think that at least
Dean just blushed in response.
"Perfect," Cas said, his legs bracketing Dean's, one foot on the floor and one squeezed tightly against the seat. He scooted closer until he was sitting right in Dean's lap - the part of his lap not taken up by belly, at least, which wasn’t much - and his thighs pressed into his stomach. Cas flexed his legs and Dean sighed, the slight pressure nothing but a pleasure.
Dean snorted. "Of course I knew you were replacing my clothes," he said, as if it was the most ridiculous question in the world. "I've had most of these clothes since my twenties. You really think I wouldn't notice that my entire goddamn wardrobe changed?"
Cas sighed and leaned down to give Dean's double chin a quick kiss. "I'll go, Dean. Should probably pick up some new pants while I'm at it. I don't think those will survive much more abuse."
"Dean, I don't think the full might of heaven could make those pants button," he said. Cas reached out and grabbed a handful of Dean's supple stomach, relishing in how warm and soft it was. He squeezed a bit harder, and Dean made an annoyed sound. "There is no way on earth that this will work."
He quickly threw his head back and downed the shot, setting the glass back down on the counter, all with his hands behind his back. When Dean looked up, Cas's pupils were blown wide and he was staring at Dean.
He continued to stuff himself with Chinese takeout, foregoing chopsticks in favor of a fork. It was faster to eat this way, and these days, Castiel was all about eating as much as possible in the shortest amount of time. His stomach didn’t like to be kept waiting. Cas shoveled fried rice in his mouth at a truly amazing rate, and although he knew he didn’t look particularly sexy while doing so, Dean gazed at him with longing eyes from across the table.
- Dean put his hands behind him and pushed. Every bit of him jiggled as he stood up. The whole ordeal was a little tiring, if he was being honest, but he was a man on a mission.
They jerked each other off in the diner’s single stall bathroom, overwhelmed and turned on by Cas’s words and Dean’s appetite. Someone banged on the door and Dean laughed, still panting, his forehead against Cas’s.
“So good, Dean,” Cas said, working nimble fingers into Dean’s many layers of fat. “Just tell me what you need.”
Castiel started asking himself.
Now to get comfortable. After weighing the pros and cons of struggling to unclasp his bra himself, Dean shrugged and stepped into the hot tub still partially clothed. If the water stretched stuff out it was really just doing him a favor.
Devilish Delights was the highlight of Dean's day, to say the least.
"Don't do that," he said, squeezing Dean's belly slowly. "I like it."
Dean grinned. “I love surprises,” he said, practically bouncing on his feet. Or well, he would be, if he wasn’t so full. And maybe a few pounds lighter.
"Mm."
"Hey Dean, what did you do with- Oh my god!" Sam yelled as he rounded the corner, hand slapping over his eyes. "Guys, that's my door! Ew!"
Castiel kept up this attitude for the next few weeks, but when his pants began to tighten again, he started to worry. Filling out to a healthy weight was one thing, but his belt was on the last hole, and it was
Sam gave him a once-over and Dean really, really wished that he could cease to exist. He’d been doing such a good job of hiding his weight gain from people, of hiding his belly, and one little slip up was apparently all it took for one of his best friends to get an eyeful.
His gigantic, cellulite-lined thighs were spread wide to accommodate his growing belly, and said belly sagged low between them and spread across his lap. The biggest part of Cas was definitely his gut, although his hips and ass were a close second. All of his fat was soft and pliable and heavy in the form of thick rolls that lined him from knee to neck. Cas was currently holding onto one of these rolls at his sides and he squeezed deliberately, relishing in the way his fat molded to his fingers.
“Ouch,” Sam said, and he reached towards Dean’s stomach, making him jump.
Dean was gaining weight.
"Get them yourself!"
"And whose fault is that?" Sam retorted. "No, Dean, I'm not getting you more food."
I’m really loving the prompts so far, keep ‘em up guys!! Even if it’s as simple as a pairing, lemme know what you want!
“Shh, it’s okay.” Cain trailed his fingers higher, ran them in loose circles around Dean’s chest. “You must be cold after strutting around in that getup all day. How about a soak in the hot tub? Then we can do something about dinner.”
: Set several years after an alternate s13, established Dean/Cas, chubby!Dean, (really) fat!Cas
He still had ten left when the end of school bell rang, and he'd never been more grateful for it in his life. Cas was thirsty, tired, sweaty, sore, and a little nauseous, and he really just wanted to cry, take a nap, or both. Probably both. Thankfully, Mr. Walker had football practice immediately after classes, or else Cas had the feeling he would've been held back and forced to do more jumping jacks. The look in Walker's eye certainly suggested that.
Maybe he growled at one particularly interested passerby, but Dean didn’t notice, so it was fine.
This is really becoming an even mix of chubby!Dean and chubby!Cas, isn’t it? I’ve got another fic ready to post in a few days, and one more I’m working on, but leave me some more prompts!!
Realizing that he was making Dean uncomfortable, Castiel backtracked quickly. Eight plus years as a human and he still didn’t get the intricacies of their speech. “No, Dean, I didn’t mean it like that. I think you look more beautiful than ever.”
I’ve had this in my drafts for a while. It’s not based on a prompt, but who doesn’t love chubby!Dean in a baseball jersey?? And I’m sorry, I just couldn’t resist the title pun.
cake was even better than pie. Cas managed to say as much between bites, and Dean scrunched up his nose.
Sam swore he heard a faint popping noise as Dean was yanked from the driver's seat, his belly jiggling like it was made of jello. There were red marks in the shape of a steering wheel on Dean's gut. Sam pulled Dean's shirt down as quickly as he could, but it was very tight and still didn't cover his brother's entire stomach. A bit of his underbelly popped out below the shirt and it actually looked like Dean wasn't wearing a shirt at
Dean hummed in agreement, his belly stuffed so full he felt like he was floating. He moved his hands under the table to rub the very underside of his belly, and his hand accidentally brushed his cock. Dean had to take a huge breath - deeper than any previously - to keep himself from visibly reacting in any other way, and as he let it out, he felt the seam on his obscenely tight shirt tear.
Pushing aside those thoughts, Cas stuffed another Oreo in his mouth and rubbed at where his love handle pushed over his too-tight pants. His pants were suffocatingly small, even when buttoned under his gut, and he was at the very end of his belt, including the holes he'd made himself. He sighed, ashamed that he'd have to ask Dean to let out his pants again - or maybe he should just get new ones at this point - and heard a snap, followed by instant relief.
"Thanks, babe," Dean said, a hint of a blush on his cheeks. He pulled Cas down for a longer kiss, both of them humming contentedly. "You're amazing," he said after they broke apart, words muffled into the side of Cas's neck.
Cain chuckled and started on the other stocking. “Only you could be thinking about food so soon after stuffing yourself with ice cream.”
After several minutes of searching, Cas finally found the correct size at the bottom of a dusty bin. The jersey buttoned over Dean’s belly nicely, hugging it softly, and although Dean would certainly be more comfortable now, Cas was a little disappointed that he’d lose the opportunity to ogle Dean’s snug jersey. When Dean sat down to take off his too-small pants, his belly filled the fabric out a bit better, but Cas still found himself missing the busted shirt.
Dean sighed. He was being a crappy friend, and he knew it. “Date with Cole was shitty,” he said. “Nothing really there anymore.” It wasn’t a lie, per se, but Dean wasn’t about to tell Sam that he was grumpy because he was up thirty-five pounds, barely fit into his silk PJs, and had resorted to buying men’s shape wear.
: High School/Boarding School AU, eventual Dean/Cas, chubby!Cas, chubby!Dean
As he finally got sideways, Dean spread his legs to let his gut drop again and let out a long breath. He looked around the restaurant for the buffet, but his eyes found their waiter first. He was partially hidden behind a partition, but Dean could clearly see his dropped jaw and the tent in his pants. Dean winked at him, and the man's eyes widened as he ducked completely behind the barrier.
Dean squirmed anxiously, and Sam eased up a bit. “I, uh. Thanks.”
Mother's voice whispered). "Look at me. I'm not exactly svelte, but is there anything particularly satanic about me?" He slapped his stomach for emphasis, and Cas gulped.
Nevertheless, Dean found his mouth forming the words, "My car's out back."
Dean nodded and Sam sighed. He sounded more sad than disgusted or disappointed, surprisingly enough, but that didn’t keep Dean from feeling embarrassed.
Well, it wasn’t happening to Sam, but he was different. Fuckin’ rabbit food, man. No one was meant to live on kale alone.
"That's what happens when you eat non-stop for over three hours," Cas said with an eye roll, but Dean just whimpered and slumped back further in his chair. "Did you really not realize how much you were eating?"
“Was I?” Dean asked innocently, though he was sure his smirk gave him away. He stretched and reached for his boyfriend, pulled him down for a kiss.
He eyed the gigantic cup on the table and prayed to whoever was listening that it was Sam’s, that the teeny little drink next to it was his. “Of course, man. Thanks.”
"Love you too, Dean."
He spread his legs wide and let his gut settle between them. It brushed the seat between his thighs and Dean gave it a fond pat. That was new. Usually, Dean had to lean forward for his belly to rest against his seat like that. Right now he was leaning back, and not by a small amount.
This time, Cain’s response was a little more satisfying. ‘Eat the whole box. Send proof.’ Dean moaned and cupped his cock through his panties. Now they were getting somewhere.
Cas set Dean’s share on the side table close to the loveseat and shrugged. “It’s okay, my treat.”
It turned out that Cas needn’t have worried. Only a small handful of players on the other team could even come close to hitting Dean’s pitches, and between that and their own stellar hits, the game ended 5-1 without much nail-biting.
Castiel thought to himself, slowly reaching over to his belly, lifting up the soft overhang to feel around for his belt. His fingers found the ripped leather where his belt had torn through the sloppily-made hole, the frayed fabric where his button was supposed to be, and the way his growing belly had pushed the zipper down, and he felt his face flush. How was he supposed to get a new belt? New pants? What would happen when Mother and Father saw what he'd done to himself? What
“Dean,” he began, licking a bit of duck sauce off his wrist, “I’m tired. Could you please feed me?”
Cas prayed for some way out of this, and it seemed like someone was actually listening, because in the middle of his second lap, Cas landed on his foot wrong and fell and cried out in pain, clutching his ankle. Walker blew his whistle again and everyone stopped running.
Dean pretended to act offended for exactly two seconds before Cain reached over for the first strawberry and held it up to his lips. Then he took a bite and oh, yeah, Dean would totally put out for food like this, Cain was right. He moaned and sat up a little straighter, automatically trying to get closer to the strawberry. His belly nestled even deeper between his thighs and pressed more firmly against his seat when he did so.
much too tight. Not to mention the fact that he'd started doing his pants up under his not-so-insignificant stomach, letting what should be a flat stomach push out over his waistband and tug at the buttons on his shirt.
Dean huffed out a laugh. "Smart ass," he muttered, and Cas gave a small smile.
Dean hauled him to his feet and he stumbled, vaguely registering some comment about needing to help Cas back to their room and the resulting teasing from the others. Cas just belched loudly and clutched his distended stomach, fingers squeezing at the taut skin, indifferent to the resounding laughter from the group, not caring that they could see his busted belt and pants clear as day.
, Dean thought as he ran his fingers along the angry-looking marks creased into his stomach. He tried to take a deep breath, but anything beyond breathy little pants was painful, required too much of his stomach. Frustrated, Dean sat down on the toilet lid with his big, bloated belly between his thighs.
“No way,” Sam said immediately. Dean raised an eyebrow, and Sam averted his eyes. “I mean, uh, I think you actually look better. Than you did a month ago, y’know.”
“That’s ten pounds in the last month,” Cas pointed out. “You’re getting pretty big, Dean - you usually gain that much in a year.”
“Dean,” Sam said, cutting him off, “you’re really not fat. Your body’s just adjusting to eating like a normal person again, it’ll figure itself out eventually.”
“I’m a total fatass,” Dean complained as he shoved a cheese-laden chip in his mouth. “I’m pretty sure I heard people gossiping about me in the break room, and I need new pants, cause I’m so fucking fat, and-“
The next day was even worse. His back was still sore, so the workout was even more painful, and Cas felt a twinge of pain every time his hefty belly bounced back into place over his shorts. He didn't have to do extra jumping jacks this time, but he
Unconsciously glancing down at the mention of Dean's pants, Cas's eyes locked onto Dean's soft belly that lapped over the waistband of his underwear. It was truly a magnificent belly, round and supple, littered with little pink stretch marks and brown freckles and golden hairs. Dean chuckled, and his middle bounced enticingly.
#2: Fair warning, it gets pretty smutty towards the end, which is kinda rare for me lately. Hopefully y’all don’t mind ;)
Then he went back to work and Dean choked again, on the verge of getting whiplash from how fast his night was moving. There was probably irony somewhere in the fact that Dean seemed to have picked up a slightly older, more polite version of the kids who hit on him every night, but he was too strung out to care right now. Hell, he understood liking a bit of cushion for the pushin' - in fact, he was pretty hot for the little belly Cas was sporting - but Cas was really getting into it. Teeth nipped at Dean's stomach and he buried his face in it like it was a big, squishy pillow, and Dean could hear Cas's low, muffled moans from up here.
Cas tried his hardest to focus on all his potential teammates that day, but his eyes kept getting drawn back to Dean. At first it was because he couldn’t stop staring at his ass (and face, and belly), but then it was because Dean demonstrated that he had the best throwing arm their school had seen in decades.
He’d heard that safety pins could help in a pinch, but a quick scan of his room revealed exactly what he suspected - he didn’t own safety pins. And he doubted that Cas or Sam had any either. So Dean prayed to a god he knew wasn’t home and tugged the waistband a little lower, let his little belly push over it, and managed to button his jeans without much of a struggle. It was uncomfortable as hell, but he could deal.
“Yeah, they were-” Head spinning, Dean turned around and faced Castiel, and their eyes locked. “Wait.
Dean worked at his belly with his hand, hoping it would speed up the process. As a general rule, Dean tried to keep himself from touching this part of his body unnecessarily, but
Dean hadn't sat at a booth since he was 400 pounds, and even then it hadn't been comfortable.
make it a lot easier to keep his belly out of the way...
Dean and Cas fell into a routine over the course of the next couple weeks. They'd wake up, get breakfast with Dean's brother, go to class, get lunch with Charlie and Dean's other friends, finish their classes, and then go to their various after school activities. Cas had joined the book club, much to Sam's - Dean's brother's - delight, while Dean was captain of the robotics team. But while classes were educational and book club fun, Cas's favorite part of his routine was getting dinner. With Dean.
“Hey, Dean? You okay?” Sam asked from the other side of the door.
Cas and Dean both grew quiet after that, Dean’s mouth too full for conversation, Castiel focused on a form he was filling out for a customer. Dean ate slowly and took tiny sips of coke between bites, and fifteen minutes later he was in the middle of his fourth piece when he gave up. His temples hurt from chewing, his ass was sore because of the old couch, and his belly staunchly refused to accept any more food.
"Buddy, I don't know if you need any more," Dean laughed, but he sat next to Cas anyway, leaning against the headboard. He squeaked when Castiel flung a leg over him and hauled himself into his lap, their bellies squashing together (was Cas's actually bigger than Dean's?), Cas clutching Dean's sides like handlebars. "Um, Cas?" Dean ventured, sounding nervous, though Cas noticed that his hands went straight to his love handles.
As Dean flipped the menu to the back, he noticed the "Specials" section. In big block letters, the menu exclaimed, "THURSDAY NIGHT - $15 ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET!"
. He shoved another truffle in his mouth with one hand and picked at the waistband of his panties with the other. They were a little too small for him, but they were just so perfect, so decadent. Pink silk faded into sheer lace in the front and back, put his naughty bits on display. The material always caught on his dick in just the right way, right below the small bow, leaving him perpetually half hard. Dean teased himself with a finger and it took a monumental effort not to go any further.
“Few weeks or so,” Dean admitted. In for a penny, in for a pound, or whatever.
Dean's metabolism had been slowing down lately - he was almost forty, it happened - and he'd noticed his pudge getting pudgier for several months now, even before his broken leg. It was usually easy to hide, not that Dean really cared, but when he had to get dressed the following week for another grocery run, he noticed that his stomach tugged at his henley a bit. He lifted his shirt to study himself in the mirror and- huh. That was indeed a belly. His doughy, slightly rounded middle had transformed into a proper little belly, one that poked out over his waistband and apparently tugged at his clingier shirts. And Dean wasn't even full.
Dean stopped walking and let out an obnoxious moan, startling Castiel out of his thoughts. “Oh yeah, right there,” he said, leaning back into the touch. A passing woman gave them a disgusted look, but they were used to it by this point. Omegas were supposedly meant to be smaller than their alphas, quiet, unobtrusive, and while the world was getting more accepting every day, some people’s delicate sensibilities got offended when a pregnant, obese omega practically shouted out his ecstasy at having his back rubbed in the middle of the Kansas State Fair. To be fair, Dean was very loud.
Sam’s morose face gave away the answer before he even nodded. “Yeah. He is.”
“I’m… sorry?” said Cas.
“What blonde lady?”
“Can’t you do something for him, Cas?” Young Dean asked.
Cas placed a hand on her arm. Light came from the edges of her wounds and she choked in a sound as her posture shifted. She stood taller and straighter, no longer tense with pain.
“I wasn’t raised believing in anything,” Dean said. “My father wasn’t a religious man. I grew up thinking Heaven couldn’t possibly exist, but Hell might. I was late in my twenties when all that changed.” He couldn’t help his gaze sweeping across to Castiel. Cas, who should’ve known better than to look at Dean this whole time. Dean was afraid he’d give something away to Betty. Betty with her hateful pamphlets at the ready, hundreds of them, to be handed out at parades and services and on street corners. To weigh down the people passing by with the yoke of self-loathing, to teach and enforce behaviour through shame.
Young Dean met his eye, and Dean smiled drowsily.
Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name wasn’t all good. He was tough and self-serving and as lawless as any great anti-hero out of stories. The world didn’t divide neatly like that. One role apiece, one character trait for any given situation. When three men in a room watched a good movie, that didn’t leave them as cut-and-dried types. Shoehorned into whatever role was available just because someone else called dibs on the favourite. Cas wasn’t Angel Eyes just because the name fit, and Sam—though Dean would likely never say it to his face—wasn’t all that ugly.
“Never, Cas,” said Dean, letting the smile ease onto his face. “You don’t know it yet, but I want to look after you.”
Cas’ face was one of stark displeasure, an expression that Young Dean had not yet seen him wear. He thought he’d seen Cas’ disappointment and disapproval before. Thought he’d seen the angel full of holy vengeance when fighting demons in Wyoming. Those had all the power of a moody pout compared to this. Now, Cas looked coldly murderous.
does, maybe. Future me. He’s a mess. I’m the balanced one.”
“Better,” said Past-Cas, the bass in his voice a touch deeper. He pushed himself to sit up carefully. “I see we work with witches now.”
“Not the worst thing waitstaff in Nevada have overheard, you figure?” Young Dean asked after a tense moment.
“Hey!” said Dean, hand going to a gun at his hip. “Get away from him.”
to. Or shave. Dean doesn’t seem to mind.”
“Eileen?” said Young Sam, looking around at the others. “Is that my girlfriend? Her name’s Eileen? Dean wouldn’t tell me anything about the future.”
“Actually, we’ve met,” said Essie.
Young Dean shoved the sword back into the scabbard, examined the leather carrying strap, then pulled it over his head so the strap ran diagonally across his chest, the sword on his back. “I need to eat,” he announced.
“It’s not broken,” said Lanie.
Cas gave a faint nod of his head, not pushing, never assuming he knew what Dean might say or ask.
“You’re supposed to ask him why he’s sick, and then, hey presto, you deserve the Grail,” said Young Dean. “These stories are all about being humble, earning shit. I been walking on my fucking knees, here, and I thought I was close. Those sea hags… they said I could be a hero.”
what,” said Young Dean, smiling a little, leaning in conspiratorially. He was determined to get back in Dean’s good graces, and surely he couldn’t stay mad on this topic. “Was it good or was it
Dean recognised him too. “Peter? Peter Sousa?”
“What the hell?” He looked at Cas, who echoed his puzzled expression back down at the phone. “What is this? Did you make it back to the future?”
“We’ll try the strawberries later,” Dean told Cas. “We’re just grabbing some beers. Teen-Dean’s got a lead on that sword, thinks we might be able to help Eileen. You want a beer?”
He took another beer from the fridge, the door swinging closed again as Cas came in.
“Very funny. How many times can you make that crack?” Dean asked.
say it, too.”
“Mm.”
Dean remembered the book. He usually tried not to. He’d avoided libraries for a solid year after that incident.
“You just tried to kill us all,” said Young Dean.
Cas paused, shook his head. “No,” he said. He angled his head to one side. “They’re… scared of me.”
Young Dean came around the island and stopped. His eyes narrowed. “You’re
one.”
Dean had barely shifted, but Cas stirred beside him, waking up in the way people do, following one another. He took in a deep breath, pushing himself up a little on one arm, looking around himself in the dark room as if to find his bearings. The motel. The muted sound of a TV in the room next door. The mountain wind pushing against the outside walls, stealing away the heat. But Dean was warm enough, now, as long as he didn’t leave these blankets.
The tape in the cassette deck reached the end of Side A and auto-ejected. Young Dean reached for it, flipping it over and jamming it back in the player without wavering from his place on the road. He squinted against the bright sun. While there weren’t consequences for Dean, the same couldn’t be said for his younger self. Every moment counted, every moment was a part of his present. He couldn’t wait around for his life to start: he had to search and to strive. To seize every opportunity he could. It wasn’t fair, how long he’d waited already.
“Croatoan flashbacks. It’s fine,” said Dean. At Young Dean’s questioning look Dean gave a shake of his head. “Maybe we’ll explain one day.”
“No,” said Dean. “You got digs sorted out, then it’s all good. Take about two days to get there?”
Dean looked at him, a careful and studious gaze. “If you’re hungry, have more food,” he said.
“We ever spend any time at Bobby’s?” Sam asked.
“Their world?” said Sam.
“It smells like witchcraft to me,” said Bobby. “This is a spell, plain and simple.”
“A phone call,” Cas said once more, turning over the prospect. “I don’t see why a phone call should hurt. They already know about you, and you’ll address the issue at hand. The memory issue.”
“Is there something to worry about?” Cas asked, frowning.
“I know,” said Dean.
“That isn’t…” Cas tipped his head to the side. “That isn’t Jimmy Novak.”
“Don’t brush me off with, ‘it’s complicated,’” said Young Dean. “Goddammit, Dean, I know what goes through
“He wouldn’t,” said Young Dean. “You’re handsome with it. Not that you weren’t handsome without.”
“There’s nothing to sense,” said Young Dean. “The Dark Watchers are absence. Angels have not even known what they have not known. That’s their words, again.”
“Well if you’re done with your routine,” said Dean, “we need to talk about this contract.”
“Cas,” said Dean. His mouth parted, vexed as he searched out the words, a frown in his brow. He looked pissed-off. “You been thinking that way all this time?” He turned his head towards the sky, giving a scoff that his heart wasn’t fully in. “And you say I’m messed up.”
Young Dean rubbed a hand at his forehead, elbow leaning against the window ledge. “So maybe I can’t quit hunting. But… if I had Cas with me,” he said quietly.
Dean nodded. “I’m sorry,” he said. The muted woods swallowed up his words, leaving a wake of thick silence. The oppressive stillness of the atmosphere, the absence of sense, struck Dean all at once.
They oughtta be more worried about other things. Things they couldn’t see.
“Well right now we want the same thing,” said Dean. “To burn those Arimasp-holes to the ground. We’re doing this.”
“It would’ve grown up with a taste for mountain-hikers,” said Past-Cas. “If that gives you any reassurance.”
When he visited John and Mary again, John said, “What, you playing dress-up now?”
Dean looked confused. “Oh,” he said. “Well. Not clearly enough. That’s not how I heard it.”
“Dean and you really are fated to be, huh?”
Sam leapt on it too, turning wide eyes to Cas. “Please?” he said.
What is straight? A line can be straight, or a street, but the human heart, oh, no, it’s curved like a road through mountains.
“So Abrasax is a god,” said Dean. “The kind of god we have to kill?”
“I don’t think there was anybody within a hundred miles of me,” said Sam. “It was my best option.”
“Easy for you to say. You don’t have to deal with the consequences.”
Young Dean groaned, pinching his nose and pressing his eyes tightly shut. “Cas, come on,” he said.
They were both on laptops, trawling through archived newspapers and local stories of any ilk. Dean sat at a small table near the window, while Jack was up on his bed, cross-legged, leaned forward to type his searches and scroll through pages.
Castiel made his apologies to the group as well and joined Dean over by the punch table. Dean stood close as they filled their cups, and murmured, “Are you well?”
The nurse opens her mouth, another frown on her face that clearly says
Castiel spreads his hands, at a loss. "Nothing! It seems we…evened each other out, I guess."
“I’m sure there are many women who, if society allowed, would prefer to just be rich old maids than to be thrust out on the marriage-mart among the wolves,” Castiel observed.
Cas can feel the charge building, running up his spine, and he wills it away with a deep breath in. He’s just about to reply, when his phone beeps with a message. He picks it up—it’s Benny.
“Dean?” Castiel’s fingers touch Dean cheeks, and Dean forces a thin smile.
Dean can’t seem to resist the command of that eyebrow, so he scrambles onto the bed on all fours, feeling oddly exposed with his ass in the air. A wet swipe of a finger up his crack brings a gasp out of him, and it isn’t long before Cas is circling his hole, dipping inside gently.
“Oh yes, plenty of fine young ladies. Not that I was looking, eh?” He nudged the man next to him, laughing. “That Miss Lisa Braeden, she’s a looker. Winchester, you’re the bachelor around here! Take note, man.”
for you!"
Dean starts to sound exasperated again. "Actually no, you
The halo around Dean flares brighter, startling Cas out of the moment. It's not Dean that's glowing. He tilts his head to the side to look over Dean's shoulder and gasps.
“That so?” Rosco turns his gaze on the kid—Sam—and watches him shift awkwardly.
Castiel turns the page, but the chapter ends there, and the following chapter deals with the uprisings of lay magicians during the Great Depression. He sits back on the couch, letting the news soak in. That explains how the book was restricted so quickly. “It was meant to be temporary?” he murmurs, mostly to himself. “But why put it there in the first place?”
Castiel shakes his head, though a small smile escapes his lips. “My point is that I love you, but I’m not ‘game.’ Not right now. Maybe later?”
Ruby flinches away from him, but shrugs a little. "Oh, guaranteed passes for my subjects, overlooking other stuff I might get up to…futureproofing." She takes in his disgusted expression. "And I’ve done my part perfectly—nobody knew, not even Sam. Yeah, I'm sure you're a little angry right now, but, I mean, come on, Rosco. Even you have to admit—I'm awesome!”
But there's a fair chance Azazel would know what the virus was, maybe even where it had originated from. And if he was able to control the infected somehow… Castiel feels a chill in his bones as an awful idea occurs to him. No, surely not…
Dean gave out a small grin, pulling off his hat and settling it into his lap politely. Bobby knew him better than anyone beyond Sam, and Dean trusted him more than his own self. So, if Bobby said to calm, he’d calm. “Very well, old man. Tell me why you summoned me from my bedsheets while I can still taste last night’s whiskey, in that case.”
Dean's sure he hears Castiel mutter, "Gotta be fucking kidding…" as he gets back to his feet. Louder, he says, "Dean? Get up, quickly." Castiel grabs him under one shoulder and helps him up.
As he’s about to walk to the door after the others, Castiel remembers the other reason he wanted to come here tonight. He puts his hands back in his pockets, and lets Dean’s magic give him the courage. “Actually, I wonder if I could ask a favor. There’s a book that I’m hoping to reference as part of some research I’m doing. It’s out of print now, and even the Stanford library doesn’t seem to have a copy available. I wondered if you have a collection here that I might be able to check?”
When Dean’s gaze followed to Castiel, he found him gazing back with a frown. The expression cut him to his core, making him look away again immediately. He muttered to Miss Masters, “Please excuse me,” before stepping away and making a beeline for the punch.
Claire frowns, levelling such a thundercloud look at her father that Dean has to choke back a laugh. She takes the pizza in her fist and throws it over the side of her highchair onto the floor.
Castiel looks affronted for a moment. “I’m a respected business owner and landholder, actually. And you...you’re just a lowly servant. You should be calling me sir.”
Castiel jumps to his feet and Dean follows, his bag of books tumbling to the floor. Their shoes are touching and Dr. Novak is standing so close to him, he can feel the erratic rhythm of his breathing, can see the glint of fury in his gorgeous blue eyes as he stares at Dean decisively.
“You’ll work it out,” she says lightly, once Dean explains he doesn’t want to get into the particulars, not right now. “You and Cas are basically married, in a magical sense at least.”
Castiel and Dean stood in the entrance to a large space with a high, beamed ceiling. Gas lamps hung above them and candle sconces on the walls around the room cast light on the crowds below.
Pausing as he swam past, Castiel smiled as he leaned on the doorway of the crèche, listening in as Joshua continued, his voice reverent as his time-worn fins rippled gently.
"Shut up," Dean mutters, covering his face with one hand.
When Castiel dares to look again, the dragon has collapsed into a matrix of glowing red lines and geometric shapes, and vanishes into the air. Castiel bends over, gasping for air, and nearly lashes out with his fists when a hand claps on his shoulder and sends a thrill of energy through him. He looks up into Dean’s relieved face.
Dean nudges his shoulder a little, just a playful gesture, but Castiel’s shoe gets caught in the sand and he stumbles slightly. Dean lunges for him, hand on Cas’ elbow, and they both chuckle at the collision.
He carefully takes the pen away from her, but she’s not impressed with that either, letting out a cry that has everyone, including Dr. Winchester, turning to look in Claire’s direction. “Sorry,” Cas mutters, wincing, and Dr. Winchester continues his lecture with only a little smile.
Being in a relationship is weird, that’s for damn sure.
“Wish my mouth was on you,” Castiel says in a rush.
Rowena speaks up impatiently. “Would you and your people please trace the teleport of the men who just left here? They’re the ones you should be after.”
“Sam?” Dean breathes, as his brother collapses to his knees on the driveway. Castiel stumbles after Dean, back to the driveway and up the hill.
“No offense, Sam, but you trusted a double-crossing demon skank, so…” Jo’s voice trails off and Sam’s mouth sets into a hard line.
“Don’t you mean, ‘sloshed.’ ‘Pissed.’ ‘Off your trolley?’” Dean squints at him in confusion, so Castiel clarifies, “That’s what Meg would call it, being drunk. She’s adapted very well to British slang.”
“...and then fucking Adler pokes his head in the door. Thank god I’d already zipped up—”
"You okay, Cas? You must be freezing!"
Internally, he heaved a sigh of relief.
"Ow!" He rubs at it, frowning at her.
He was just about to turn and leave again as quietly as he could, when he heard it. A gasp. A groan. He stopped in his tracks.
For now, at least, the feeling of Dean’s magic close to his heart brings him reassurance. No reason to worry about the camera footage. Charlie had seemed confident.
“Thank you,” Dean murmured. And then, because there was so little point in
Dean wasn't so sure taking his livelihood out to sea for a drunken party was the greatest idea, but it had been a while since they’d had any kind of celebration like that. Plus, he owed Sam a bit of light-hearted fun. His dad was right—they’d been working way too hard lately.
Dean leaves her to it, getting up and heading back to the counter to start heating milk in Claire’s small mug. This year has been a tricky time for the kid (and Dean, if he's honest), but her pediatrician had suggested drawing as a method to express her feelings, and it seems to be helping.
He took note of the paper on the wall above the fireplace—stained and peeling in places. He’d have to arrange for that to be fixed or even replaced, which meant the front room would also need doing, and the fireplaces swept.
At Dean’s stormcloud look, Benny said, “Don’t worry brother, I won’t say a word.”
Castiel’s eyes gleam in the candle light. “You sure it wasn’t just
Sam gives him the sort of look Dean has always thought of as a bitchface, and turns to scan the hillside in the direction the Croat had come from. “Don't get snarky with me. I know how you feel about leaving. We could have stayed—"
Joshua had told them, as two young sprats, that humans walked around with their genitals outside their bodies, but he’d never believed it. But now, he guessed it must be true. The thing between his legs looked so different to the smooth organ that slept inside merfolk’s bodies until it was needed. He poked at the loose skin, questions fighting for space in the front of his mind.
Castiel watches him go. He should follow him, make sure he's okay, but when his eyes return to Meg, the anger wins out.
Castiel blinks. “Um, no, I didn’t get that one.”
“We both do,” Crowley says cheerily. “Sam, the moose that Ruby recruited using her womanly wiles. She had no idea how useful it might prove to be.”
Cas jerks awake, looking around in a half-asleep panic. His bedroom. He's lying under the covers, in only his underwear.
Throughout his life, Dean had been pushed and shoved at people who wanted things from him; his wealth, his property, the security he could offer with those things.
He blinks at the sheriff, until she continues, “We thought some kind of maintenance platform or long ladder, but to carry body weight as well as climbing a ladder? That’s quite a feat.”
Several long minutes passed, frozen, as Dean clung to Castiel and Castiel clung right back.
Perhaps suppressing his thoughts about Dean Winchester would not be so difficult. It seemed he was merely another of the brash country gentlemen, albeit somewhat softened by his time in the city.
“But only a little,” Dean said, taking the fork from the tray and spearing some fruit. “It would please me to see you eat more.”
Dean threw down his hand. “I must apologize,” he said, “my attention is not all here. Perhaps the Duke’s friend, there, can pick up my cards.”
The professor interrupts, a hand on Cas’ elbow. “No, wait, it’s fine. Give her to me, I can walk and talk.”
He lifted a corner of his own undershirt and wiped at his face, then he pulled it back down as neatly as he could manage and stepped towards the boxing ring. He was in control. He could do this.
“A number of people over in the Houndsditch area have reported strange happenings, gas lights flickering, chills, odd banging sounds, apparitions, even. Are you interested?”
He's about to suggest as much when Dean speaks up instead.
So, yeah, with Dean’s luck he would turn his hand into an umbrella or some shit. He plays it safe and enters the lobby shivering and wet, slinging his messenger bag on a nearby bench. He might not be great at manifesting, but drying is an entry level spell he could do in his sleep. He makes his left hand the shape of a C, while the thumb and forefinger of his right hand reaches into the center, and he drags it through the opened space. Instantly his clothes, his skin, even his hair, are intensely dry. He wonders if he might’ve overshot it, even, reaching a hand up to wade through his hair—full of frizz and static.
The look on Castiel's face, the betrayal, the sadness. Had it...had it meant something to Castiel after all?
date? Cas, tell me you kissed him. Or
Castiel ducks back under the low branch after Dean, thinking that he really should get out the shears and do a bit of pruning, but when he hardly ever comes here, what would be the point?
Phillip was an extremely tall man for his age—he hadn’t fallen prey to any kind of stoop to match his gray top, and he was almost the same height as Sam. He made quick work of collecting Dean’s jacket and was working on taking Dean’s cravat when Dean began to notice a smell in his room. Soft, flowery, a little sweet smelling—gardenias, he was sure.
Cas nods, but smiles, sadly. “What’s this ‘we’ you’re talking about?” he asks. “You’re leaving again, aren’t you?”
Lady Holmes gestured at a few people around the circle as she spoke. “My dear friend Mrs Naomi Tapping you would already know,” she began, and continued at his nod. “My daughter sits beside her there: Rachel. And my sister’s daughter, Hannah Carroll, sits beside
“Mom and Pop aren’t what you would call…well, ‘parents,’” Gabriel says bluntly. “Think their paternal and maternal instincts got lost in the mail.”
Castiel draws his hand back quickly, suddenly embarrassed, and a little shocked by the strength of the compulsion to touch that soft skin again, but with his own lips. He shifts back, as Dean lifts a hand to touch his mouth, his eyes wide again.
Dean glances over his shoulder at the door of his and Cas’ room, making sure it’s closed. He unbuckles his belt and pops the button on his jeans, unzipping and shimmying down so he can pull his dick free. He strokes gently a few times. He’s just taking the pressure off, that’s all. He can’t really be expected to find all this porn and be completely unaffected, can he?
Castiel wiped a hand across his sticky forehead, frowning at the grime coating it before he sat back, looking up at the empty shelves along the walls. “This is thankless work,” he remarked bitterly.
Dean heads back into the living room, saying over his shoulder, “Bobby can teach you some, but we’re protectors, Cas. Best to leave healing to doctors.”
Alfie opened his mouth, but said nothing. Instead, a black smoke started to curl out of his throat into the chilled air. Sinclair stumbled back in horror as it moved towards him, but before he could get away, the smoke had come for him—pouring into his own open mouth, stifling the scream he tried to make as it filled his senses.
Hannah's eyebrows raise as she sips at her own drink, something involving mint and lime in a tall glass. “Not a lot. He's Rowena’s son, but he didn't come to Stanford.” When Castiel didn't say anything in reply, she continued, “You were just speaking with him, weren't you? Have you met before? He's a lawyer, isn't he?”
After presents, it takes no time for Charlie to seek out Castiel’s stack of board games, and they spend the rest of the afternoon engaged in a surprisingly cutthroat round of Monopoly. Three hours in, during a quick game-time intermission, Dean is closing the bathroom door behind him when he spots Castiel and Meg alone in the hallway, bodies tense as they trade angry whispers. Dean’s tempted to eavesdrop or interrupt, but he heads in the opposite direction instead, willing himself to trust Cas even when it’s difficult.
As amazing as this whole thing is, none of it makes sense. There’s no known spell for manifesting magic…as a Mechanical Engineering major with a concentration in Spell Deconstruction, Dean would’ve heard about it by now, no matter how complicated it is to cast. What Castiel just did was inventive and creative, powerful and new, and everything begins sliding into place in Dean’s mind. Castiel’s defense of lay magicians because they’re different, misunderstood, judged. The argument they’d had, when Dean had said something about Thaumatechs being reckless, though he hadn’t meant a word of it. Castiel had seemed to take it personally, because…because…
Dean looked up to see him grinning as he approached, his girl, Andrea, on his arm. Dean stood up to shake hands with him, and kiss Andrea's cheek before they all sat down again. Dean could see other members of his crew over by the bar, and he gave Garth a two-finger salute as he looked their way.
Sam got his arm underneath Castiel’s shoulder, helping him to get back to his feet, then supported Castiel as he turned both of them back towards Well Walk.
Castiel’s face was all love, and awe, and longing; perhaps even an unshed tear or two, as his reddened eyes blinked quickly in Dean’s direction, once then twice, as he sucked in a visible, shaky breath to calm himself. His smile widened as Reverend Shurley drew to a close.
Castiel's pace increases until his rhythm falters, and Castiel pulls back a little as he says, “I’m...I’m gonna…”
Castiel wasn’t sure how to reply to that. It was true, he was sometimes undone by memories of horrors he’d seen, but he could hardly own up to it. That sort of behaviour wasn’t considered seemly for an officer. He took a breath to reply but was interrupted by a hand clapping him on the shoulder.
Castiel also nodded, Lady Donn’s comments from the ball at Sands House making more sense now. As welcome as it was to know the cause of Michael’s death, he couldn’t exactly go back to his family and tell them he had died hunting a sorceress who summoned demons from another plane of existence. No, he would have to keep that information to himself.
A voice called from the back of the room and Castiel saw another human walking towards them. This one seemed older, with a tangle of hair on his chin like Dean’s, but grey rather than brown, as well as sticking out from under a cap on his head.
Dean 6:13 PM >>
“Cas…” They stare at each other for a moment more before Dean closes the space between them, sighing as their lips brush. He can feel love radiating off of Castiel’s skin, the bond putting their emotions in a nonstop loop of affection and adoration. “I love you too.”
But Dean continued, albeit in a quieter tone. “All I know is, I’ve wanted you from the moment you walked into my life.”
As Castiel watches, the young man carefully passes the flame between his hands, the swell of his magic radiating out of him. Castiel admires the illusion it as he watches the man turn his hand over, the flame now dancing across his knuckles—how is he able to hold it so steady?
“Yes,” Dean mused, his thoughts already far away, on the blue-eyed man who had fumbled through serving Lady Holmes her tea. “I hope it doesn’t affect his business.”
The day started normally enough. He may have only been open a few days, but he’d found there were certain customers who came in each morning to read the papers, like Captain Henriksen, or swapped gossip, like Lady Rowena and her friend, Mrs Olivette di Albioni. He’d just cleared away Henriksen’s teacup when the door jingled, heralding a group of younger ladies.
With only five minutes remaining in the period, Dean’s slightly disappointed that none of his students have successfully moved their marble yet. He wonders if it’s a lack of concentration while casting, if they haven’t developed a strong enough bond with their classmates yet, or if they’re simply too inexperienced to attempt such a complicated concept.
He stilled as the idea washed over him. Campbell was Dean’s cousin, was he not? Could
Going back to sleep is out of the question now. He gets up, padding downstairs to fetch water, and opens the door to the porch as quickly and quietly as he can. He crosses to the far side of the porch, passing the rumpled pile of blankets still on the daybed from the previous nights’ sleep, looking out across the darkened valley. Clouds still obscure the sky to the east and away down the valley, but above him is clear, the Milky Way stretching across the open expanse. Cas has always loved to see the stars from here—even before Croatoan, they were brilliant this far away from the cities on the coast. He shivers as a cool breeze blows up from the west, the rain earlier having chased the heat of the day away.
"Thanks, Inias. I'll just take your house pale ale." Castiel sits on a stool, scanning the room again while Inias fetches his drink. Where's Crowley?
Cas laughs. Deadpan, he replies, “Thanks a lot.”
Castiel nods to the group, still unsure what he just witnessed. "Hello."
"Sleeping. Whatever you gave him knocked him right out, so thanks."
“I’d rather make things work with you,” Dean says instead, hoping he sounds less like a kiss-up and more like someone who’s trying to avoid a professor he freaking hates. Though, if Castiel likes kiss-ups, Dean can think of a few better ways to approach that option…
Castiel had taken the tiny cameras to the faculty office on Wednesday morning of the second week back, and had waited with bated breath for the rest of the day and into Thursday. By the middle of Friday, he still hadn’t heard anything, and allowed himself to relax just a fraction. No news was good news, after all.
Cas pushed Dean's belly back and licked a line up the bottom of his dick. Dean cried out, uncaring that his coworkers could probably hear him, and couldn't keep himself from thrusting his hips. Cas clucked his tongue and gripped Dean's belly tighter, fingers digging into the fat, as he took his mouth off his cock to say, "Behave, Dean."
The first time Castiel met Dean Winchester, he tripped over a baseball bat. Well, not quite in that order, but. Still.
Dean laughed. “Of course,” he said. “It’s not every day that you hit seven hundred and thirty-two pounds, baby. We can do whatever you want.”
- and headbutted Dean in his eagerness to kiss him again. With a little more tongue this time around.
Sam just shook his head. Huh. What the hell was it, then?
Later that day, he stared moodily at the light beer he’d ordered while Sam talked about some tech department drama at work, something involving a guy named Andy. Dean had limited himself to his fair share of the cheese fries tonight, but his stomach was growling, used to a much bigger meal by this point, and he was determined to ignore it. He only noticed Sam calling his name after a bottle cap was thrown at his forehead.
Armed with the knowledge that Dean liked him back, Cas... did absolutely nothing. He didn’t want to start something and then screw it up; he liked Dean too much. So the tension built and built, and the team got more and more annoyed, and Dean got cuter and cuter.
Sam sighed and passed the check over. "You just wanna leave the hot waiter a huge tip."
Then again, most omegas didn’t start out their pregnancy at over four hundred pounds.
“Oh. That’s a shame,” Sam said, and was Dean mistaken or did he sound a little jealous?
"W-wow, you're awfully pushy when you're drunk," Dean stuttered, pushing his fingers into Cas's bulging gut nonetheless. Cas hummed and leaned forward, rested his head on Dean's shoulder, burped directly in his ear, and promptly fell asleep.
. He'd been sneakily replacing Dean's normal clothes, but he'd completely forgotten about his FBI suits.
Sam stared at him, and yeah, he was literally on his knees in front of another man. Dean was definitely an idiot. “I’ve mentioned Andy like fifty times. You know, my ex? I was pretty sure you were picking up on my hints.”
Cain started to rub Dean’s belly again as soon as he began to drink, this time with both hands. Dean kind of missed the tongue action, but the positioning was awkward, and to be honest he probably would have started choking if Cain tried to play with his nipples while he was drinking.
“That was a mistake,” Dean groaned as he set the slice back in the box. A deep belch escaped his mouth and he flushed, embarrassed. “God, excuse me. My break’s up, I gotta go back to the front desk.”
“Got something for your fat ass, Winchester,” Victor said as he dropped a plate on the front desk.
Speaking of. Dean grunted and leaned back against the side of the tub, one hand automatically going to his belly. God, he was getting fat. He’d always been on the chubby side, but in the year and a half he’d spent with Cain he’d absolutely ballooned, the combination of not needing to work, lazing around all day, and having access to any food he wanted doing wonders for his waistline.
"Dean, stop ogling the waiter," Sam mumbled with no real heat this time.
A Dean/Benny one! Baker!Benny, fat!Dean. I don't think the word 'chubby' entirely covers it in this case.
College AU!
weight. He'd weighed in at 513 a few weeks ago - though he'd probably packed on a good 20 pounds since then - and could still get around on his own. Well, mostly, as he evidently needed some help getting out of his Baby, but he could still walk just fine. His gut only covered about half of his thighs, just enough to make walking a little harder, not impossible. It was the biggest part of him by a long shot, but it stuck out in front way more than it hung down.
With one piece of pie left, Dean moaned like a porn star as his left hand trailed down to massage his mountainous belly. It had progressed across the table during the course of his feast and was now encroaching into Sam's space. Sam, disgruntled, tried to ignore it as he played some game on his phone. Dean wasn't mad at Sam for ignoring him, as they
"Shoot," Dean said with a smile. He loved when Benny gave him his undivided attention like this, and he especially loved when it came with a slice of pie.
Tucking his cell in his pocket, Dean shimmied forward in his chair and groaned as he stood up, belly spilling out of his lap and settling low in his overalls, heavy and round, the sudden lack of support a little jarring. It growled and Dean patted it consolingly, began the short walk to the break room with a hand still resting on his gut.
"Second," Cas sighed. "I still have several years of study ahead of me."
“It’s okay, you look pretty stuffed right about now. Whatever makes you feel better.” Another light kiss landed on Dean’s belly, shyer than the last. “Um, I didn’t even ask, is this okay?”
“But I thought you were a growing boy,” Cas challenged, eyebrow raised, and Dean took the bait easily enough. He eagerly sucked down his third milkshake and sighed afterwards, leaning back in their booth. He unbuckled his pants with a dumb smile on his face and hummed when Cas, feeling bold, placed a hand on his gut.
pouting) and Doctor Sexy didn't come on until eight. Fuck his life.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said with a smile.
"Can you let out my pants again?" Cas blurted out as Dean started to change his shorts. When Dean lifted his head and raised an eyebrow, Castiel mumbled, "They're getting tight."
It was probably their dietary differences, Cas reasoned. While Dean leaned towards hearty food and the occasional slice of pie, Cas' day was filled with sugar, fat, sugar, and more sugar. Castiel probably consumed between half and an entire cake over the course of his average day, plus whole milk to wash it down, plus whatever else the cafeteria was offering. Plus the M&Ms he'd taken to keeping in their room. Ever since Dean had introduced him to the world of sweets, Cas couldn't get enough.
Okay, this didn't follow the prompt exactly, but I think you'll like it! Made it a HS AU instead. It also went a little long... like REALLY long... Whoops.
Soon enough, Dean was in the middle of his third slice. He’d meant the cake to last him awhile, but at this rate it wouldn’t last the weekend. He reached down and popped the button on his slacks, the pants constricting even when pulled low — they didn’t button around his stomach anymore, at least not without the shape wear, but so what — and sighed when his belly settled into the space.
Even when he was this full, Cas’s belly was pliant and liquid-like, wobbling atop his lap with every little movement. Dean’s eyes locked onto Cas’s naked gut automatically and he licked his lips, shifted forward in his chair until he was close enough to touch. Cas couldn’t help but notice how Dean needed to spread his legs, let his plump belly slot between them, to do so.
Not one, not two, but
Once Dean finally managed to lever himself upright, he hobbled to the bathroom with one hand on the wall, one hovering protectively over his bloated stomach. The takeout sat in his gut like a brick and Dean felt sweat forming at his temples, and it looked like he was getting his workout after all. Being this full of greasy food was more taxing than a trip to the gym could ever be.
Dean swallowed and took in a deep breath, his cheeks puffed out, belly creeping further across his thighs. "Just lemme finish what I've got."
“I’ll get him some more,” Cas announced, ignoring the pleading look Dean shot him. He took Dean’s nearly empty plate and stood up, filled it with an overflowing sandwich and huge pile of potatoes. Mary looked satisfied, Sam looked bored, and Dean looked desperate when Castiel returned. If Dean didn’t finish his plate, his mother would just worry even more.
: Mechanic AU, eventual Dean/Cas, fat!Dean
They ended up cutting the date a bit short because Dean was too full to continue skating. He didn’t tell Cole that was the reason, of course, pretended he’d forgotten about an important meeting that he needed to get to ASAP. On a Saturday afternoon. Right. They both promised to text, but Dean had the niggling feeling that neither of them would.
Cas dragged his feet over to the water fountain and drank greedily, water running down his chin in his haste. He still had to complete his warmup, but Cas had seen other kids getting a drink of water in between running and their chosen exercise, and he probably needed it more than anybody. Leaning against the fountain when he'd finally finished, Cas moaned at the feeling of cool metal against his overheated skin.
“Fuck,” he wheezed. For crying out loud, he was supposed to be at the gym right now. Instead he was sitting in his house in his underwear and robe, belly distended to the point of looking pregnant, unable to move due to how obscenely full he was. At least he didn’t have anything to do today now that his gym plans had been cancelled. Except get drinks with Sam, but that was hours away. He could afford to be a pig, didn’t have to see anyone until then.
They continued like this until only a few pieces were left in the bag. Noticing that the candy was almost gone, Cas sighed sadly and heard two quick
He was lucky that his job let him fund his purchases; the bakery wasn't exactly cheap, but Dean's two favorite parts about his job had always been the money and the sedentary lifestyle it allowed. Being a (rather successful, if he did say so himself) writer was
"What the hell, Cas," he said, gesturing at the skin-tight slacks as he angrily shuffle-stepped over to the doorway. "I thought you'd bought a new suit already!"
“Boring,” Dean said as he slid into a chair, masterfully hiding a wince. He forced memories of the cheesecake incident down. “Your parents here yet?”
When Castiel went up to bat, he could swear he saw Dean doing to same to him. Dean’s eyes would flick to Cas’s thighs, or face, or arms, and then he’d turn a bit pink in the cheeks and finally pitch. It happened consistently, and one day, Cas decided to ask his friend and teammate Balthazar what he thought.
Dean complied, grunting when his belly got in the way. There wasn't much room sitting sideways on the seat like this, and as a result Dean's gut sat high in his lap, his legs not having enough room to spread and give his stomach more space.
“You’ve gained weight,” Cas said as Dean rubbed his stomach.
Now, a month or two past their two year anniversary, Dean was somewhere in the mid-300s. It was pretty heavy for a guy who'd just turned twenty-one, but so what? Dean loved food, Cas loved when Dean ate, and they both loved the consequences, so screw everyone else.
The phone rang, startling Dean out of his thoughts, and he brushed his hands off on his overalls and picked it up. Dean mourned the loss of the two dozen cookies as he put on his customer service voice and said, “Singer Auto, this is Dean speaking. How can we help you today?”
Dean was so screwed.
"Cas," Dean moaned, not even bothering to open his eyes. "Hurts. Need... need your hands." His own hands rested uselessly on his belly, the eating evidently having tired him out.
“Do you want me to just tell you?” Dean asked, and Cas let out a weak affirmative noise. “Seven thirty-two.”
Dean whimpered and managed to stutter out an apology, but it had been a while since his dick had had anything on it besides his own right hand.
that you're hungry-" Dean's belly growled in response - "so sit your fat ass down."
“Like you don’t love it,” Cas retorted, because he knew Dean did. His boyfriend got this light in his eyes whenever Cas pushed his limits, and Cas had noticed Dean admiring himself in the diner window the other day, running his hand over his belly reverently. Cas wasn’t the only one who was enjoying this, not by a long shot.
Shit, he thought as Sam slid the huge cup across the table. He felt a little queasy just looking at the thing. Dean loved a good latte, and he was kind of touched that Sam knew his drink order, but right now he’d rather chew glass than put anything else into his stomach.
The weight of the plates had kept his shirt from riding up too much, and while that had made Sam happy - he got what he called "second-hand embarrassment" when Dean's clothes didn't fit, and he was pissy enough as it was - it meant that Dean's shirt had been suffocating him for the past hour or so. Apparently, his deep breath had stretched his abused shirt past its limits.
That was because Dean bartended at Purgatory, the premier gay club of Austin.
He focused mostly on the hardest parts of his gut, trying to break up the food faster, trying to make more room in the monster. A few seconds in, he hit a pocket of air instead of a bit of food, surprising himself with a deep, resounding belch that gave him a surprising amount of room. While Sam (and some of the other patrons) looked mortified, the whole burping thing freed up a lot of space, so Dean started to focus on that instead. Every time he hit a pocket of air in his belly, it forced out a loud burp. Regardless of how it made him look like a total pig, it felt
Castiel got through them much more easily, his belly actually helping him, as it kept him from sitting up too far and sped up the process. It was still tiring, though, and Cas lay prone on the ground afterwards, looking up at the ceiling and wheezing. Suddenly, his view was blocked by a scowling Coach Walker.
"Haf I evah told you that yer mah favurite brotha?" Dean said through a mouthful of bread, spraying crumbs everywhere.
Aware of how long he’d been staring now, Cas cleared his throat awkwardly as his cheeks burned and stuck his hand out forcefully. “I’m Cas Novak,” he said.
"Work truck. Seat goes back farther than Baby's," he grunted as he patted he car's dashboard affectionately. "Haven't driven her in a month or so."
"Look at you," Dean whispered, chin hooked over Castiel's shoulder. "Beautiful. And this belly," he said, hefting it up with both hands, still not nearly enough to cover the whole thing. "So big, so fuckin' heavy. You're gorgeous, Cas. Perfect just the way you are."
And then Dean's stomach ruined the moment by growling loudly. Shit, Dean hadn't eaten since the beginning of his shift, which was... eight hours ago now? Probably? His belly gurgled again and Dean cupped it, trying to keep it at bay until he made it home to that leftover pizza.
"Your check, sirs," he said. Dean found the energy to open his eyes just enough to give his now-customary wink to his waiter but said nothing, his panting getting in the way of anything he might have wanted to say. He closed his eyes again, and the waiter gave Sam an awkward smile as he walked away.
He finally dragged himself out of bed a little before ten thirty and marched out into the kitchen with his pajama bottoms slung under his middle and the matching shirt unbuttoned. Dean scarfed down two energy bars, ignored his growling stomach, and went through the rest of his morning routine (minus the shower, he’d have to do that after he worked out anyway) with a heavy lump of anxiety sitting in his chest. Just before eleven, he stood with his hands on his hips in front of his closet, trying to remember where his gym shorts were. Assuming he hadn’t thrown them out. God, when was the last time he’d worn gym shorts?
After giving them Cas’ order as well, Dean hung up and lumbered towards the couch, readying himself for the unbearable wait. His unofficial spot was the battered love seat, the cushions sunken in from years of supporting his hefty weight, and Dean sighed wearily when he sat down, took the strain off his back and knees. He spread his thighs and his gut filled the space. These days, keeping his belly high up in his lap left Dean with cramps and overtaxed lungs, so Dean tended to sprawl across his seat to make himself more comfortable. It wasn’t like anyone had a chance of squeezing on the couch with him anyway, so Dean didn’t feel bad about taking up more space than strictly necessary.
Screw being an angel, Cas thought - being a human was
Mind reeling at the realization that Dean was probably correct, that he'd probably caught up to Dean's weight - something which had taken
“Six fifty?” Cas’s mind was reeling. He knew he was big, but these numbers were unbelievable, representative of a size he never thought he’d reach.
Dean blushed furiously, muttered, "'Miss you, too," and ended the call. He rubbed his stomach as he contemplated his situation, the cupcake guy having a breakdown in the background. On one hand, he wasn't gonna see Cas (or have sex) for another week or two, and this whole eating whatever he wanted thing was making him surprisingly horny, but on the other... he got another two weeks of lazing around in his underwear and stuffing his face. Fair trade, really.
The rest of the conference passed, Dean determined to forget the cheesecake incident. He managed to limit himself to reasonable portions for all of Saturday and Sunday. He threw away the rest of the cake. He pulled up the online registration for his local gym, gave them his personal and credit card information, and got a confirmation email saying his membership card would arrive within the week. He did sit-ups on his hotel bed until he wanted to puke and refused the snacks offered to him on the plane ride back to Illinois.
of these healthy habits would have rubbed off on Dean.
Dean squatted down with a grunt to start up the scale. “Thousand pounds,” he responded, “so don’t worry. Now get your hot little bod over here.”
“What?” Dean snapped.
“For you, maybe,” Cas complained, trying to rub his lower back, though he wasn’t even close to reaching. “My back hurts, I’m tired, and I’m sweaty. Why’d we have to do this in July?”
Dean blushed. “Yeah. Weighed myself yesterday. Two seventy-three.”
Dean’s eyes lit up and he quickly moved his chair around to Cas’s side of the table. “Of course,” he said, already reaching for the carton.
“Just say you’ll give me a call one day when you need the help,” said Essie. “That’s all I’m asking.”
He hadn’t wanted to leave. He remembered that feeling. That Sam and Dean and Cas treated him like a brother or a son, but in the way one should be treated. Dean didn’t remember the last time John hugged him. But Sam and Cas and even Dean, they did it like they knew he needed it, even though it would never occur to him to ask. He would’ve stayed just a little longer if he could.
Bobby made Dean stop researching after a couple of hours. Dean was so tired the pages blurred, but he would’ve kept at it uselessly anyways if it hadn’t been for Bobby turning out the lights and declaring they were done. Dean slept poorly, mind spinning with ideas of time travel.
The six of them researched, though it was different, with having Past-Cas around. Anytime there was the suggestion of a lead, a place to check out, he zapped there with Dean to investigate. Most were cold trails, but at one spot they came across a dead Arimaspian and traces of sulphur, and another location showed signs of being rapidly abandoned. It didn’t bring them closer to Sam, but as Jody helpfully pointed out, the fact that they hadn’t found a trace of him pointed increasingly towards him being alive and unharmed. Whether he was out-strategizing his enemies or being held captive, though, they had no way of knowing yet.
“Jack’s visiting Jody and the girls,” said Cas. “I wish you could meet him. You’re close in age.”
“You prayed? You used to reach him that way, didn’t you?”
“You looking up obits?” Dean asked.
“What did you see?”
Castiel raised a hand. “Just me and you, then, Essie.”
Young Dean shook his head quickly. He risked looking over at Past-Cas again. It was a mistake. He couldn’t look away. “No,” he said. “I was just really worried about you. That’s all. It’s been a long day.”
“The what?” Young Dean’s heart did something funny at the mere
“I’ve known him long enough not to have that hope,” long-suffering Castiel answered.
“How long have you been back here?” Sam asked, looking at Young Dean.
“Aw, Cas, don’t be like that,” said Dean, looking down at the ground between them and plucking at some of the rough grass that grew out of the sand. “I like you now a lot better than I thought I would. It makes sense that we’re friends.”
They patted his shoulder, touched his cheek, his hair. “Too long since we last met a hero,” said one.
Ahead again, a darkness grew between the trees, between the mist. It made his eyes feel old, the way he couldn’t see a shape at first, though he knew it
“Wallis,” Lanie said with a note of warning.
They’d moved to Keokuk, Iowa just before the school year started. Dean said it was because John was closing in on them, but that was only because he couldn’t tell Sam the real reason. The guy he’d been working for back in Muskogee, the one who did car repair from his home and who offered Dean extra money to stay late in the shop and not tell his wife what for, had started asking the wrong sorts of questions about Sam. Al could be good-humoured as anything when he wanted to be, but he could also turn pushy and intense at nothing. Dean wasn’t a stranger to mercurial natures like those and he could deal with it for himself, but when Al showed up at the restaurant where Dean cooked and Sam bussed tables twice a week, talked to Sam with an interest too keen to be friendly, Dean couldn’t take any more chances. They had to cut and run.
“Cas is a bit… fallen,” said Sam. “But he’s an angel, yeah.”
They stopped outside of Reno, booking one motel room with two beds since the angels wouldn’t sleep. A tall, neon sign right outside their window blinked in an irritatingly slow pattern, and a buzzing baseboard heater clicked into action. Young Dean suspected he wouldn’t sleep much either.
“But I liked the way I was, too,” said Cas. “I like that when I wear your clothes, they smell like me and you. I

“Do I— Yes,” said Dean. It was something to witness: the quipping-instinct being overtaken by the drive to have pie as quickly as possible. There weren't many things that could so rapidly short-circuit Dean.
Young Dean wore a stiff, faintly awkward smile, raising his brows and shaking his head. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, it is. It’s good to see you two.”
“He’s just a kid,” said Dean. “And he… He deserves better.”
“Yes,” said Cas. “I’m not from this world. I expect I know things they don’t want the rest of angelkind to know. We can explain everything.”
Young Dean nodded his head weakly. They’d set him free. He looked upwards, and the closed darkness of the barn rafters made it possible to believe he looked all the way up to Heaven. He just had to hope Cas would answer when he called.
“You are you.” Cas didn’t bother hiding his annoyance. It permeated his voice. “I suppose it makes sense that you’re at odds. No one hates you more than you do, Dean.”
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
Dean stopped again at that, but he kept himself restrained this time. “He died a while ago,” he said. “Helping us in yet another of the stupid fucking disasters we half-brought on ourselves. You don’t know it yet. To you he’s dad’s buddy, when they’re talking at least. A good hunter, someone you can trust when everything else has gone to hell. But you don’t know yet that… that Bobby’s family.” Dean kept the hard, thoughtful look on his face, because he was already too close to sentimentality. Too close to breaking apart. “Dad tells you how important family is. That’s why it’s your job to take care of Sammy, that’s why he needs you as his second, and why you got no choice but to stay and follow orders. He doesn’t tell you that family don’t end in blood.” His jaw twitched as he swallowed hard. “But you’ll learn that. And it’ll make all the difference.”
“You’re a mess, Teen-Dean,” said Dean, looking at the blood on Young Dean’s face and clothes rather than the scar across his stomach.
“He’s not even the weirdest guy we’ve met,” said Dean. “Which, now that I say it, is making me question a lot of things about my life.”
“They gave me a library card,” said Dean, fishing the blue paper out of his pocket to show Sam the proof. “You can take out some books and bring them back to the motel, if you want.”
“I don’t know,” said Waylon. “I just… Has anyone else said anything about him? About Elijah? I keep… I keep checking the news. Thinking they’ll find a… find a body. But there’s nothing.”
He reported it in so flat a tone that both Sam and Cas dropped the coffee talk, tension ratcheting up immediately.
“Lucky for you, I can be a pedantic motherfucker myself,” said Holden. He pulled a small, spiral-bound notebook from his pocket, flipping through the lined yellow pages. “She must have heard him deliver a sermon because she starts by asking, ‘Do you truly believe angels walk among us?’”
Dean saw it, though. Dean threw himself in the way of it. Talons scraped through his clothes. Across his raised arm, across his belly. Catching in his winter coat and half-dragging, half-tossing him across the floor of the cave.
“That means Cas takes me away and leaves you two with a deadly animal you can’t kill. One that’s likely pretty pissed off,” said Young Dean, and already he was winding up into that self-sacrificing, headfirst-into-danger attitude that Sam and Cas knew all too well. “I get that you want to ‘preserve the timeline’ and all that, but I don’t want you treating me with kid gloves. You’re gonna call it too soon, I can already tell. If I do this, you’ve gotta treat me as an equal. You gotta let me risk my neck and trust that I can handle myself. I don’t want Castiel pulling me out of the fight just cause the griffin looked at me wrong.”
Dean’s eyebrows rose at once. As much as he meant the offer, and wanted to know the moment Jack was ready to ask, he thought he was just setting it down on the table for the far,
“So you didn’t come here under false pretences?” said Dean.
“It wouldn’t have to be a long visit,” said Dean. Long enough for them to get through to Cas. To let him see the truth and make his own choice about whether to stay.
Dean’s gaze only drifted further, looking out the window above the sink, as if the reflected image of the kitchen in the black windowpane was now very interesting to him.
Cas. It felt of Cas. He’d have known it anywhere.
of vanilla aren’t to my taste.”
“I remember everything,” said Dean.
Cas shrugged a shoulder, despite the consequential magnitude Dean saw in what he asked. “There was no way of knowing for sure how that affected our link to one another. Maybe if you met me some other way, on a hunt or on the street or in a bar like Schaffer’s, you’d have hated me. Or just… never cared.”
“Probably,” said Cas.
“That’s not your fault,” said Young Dean. He rubbed a hand against the gooseflesh on his forearm. “I didn’t know enough when I asked you to come. I didn’t know that Sam would be hidden from you.” He shivered and pulled one knee up against his chest to contain his warmth.
“You’ve got a lot of graves to dig up yet,” said Dean. “Don’t worry about that.”
Lagging behind with Cas, a little drunker despite having matched Dean drink-for-drink, Young Dean tilted his head back to look at the array of stars in the dark mountain sky. His breath misted out above him. Heat came off him in waves as the night air cooled away the scent of bar and beer.
“That bunker could use some decoration,” said Young Dean.
“Friend’s place,” said Dean. “He thought he’d give you two some time alone.”
Young Dean came away from the whitewashed wall, looking curious now. “That’s something we wanted to ask you about, actually,” he said. Meanwhile Dean moved down to work on the third lock on the cell. “Did you find a way to come here as yourself? I mean… without taking someone as a vessel?”
“I should’ve known that it would want to hurt somebody in my place,” said Scott. “I accepted its offer, but that was never gonna be enough.”
“Well, tell him he’s only going out because we need groceries. So it feels a little like a chore, at least.”
“She’s a hunter, right? And she knows our weak spots. I don’t exactly like the idea of her skills combined with his orders once he realises he’s under attack.”
“The kids thing is complicated,” Sam cut in. “Claire… Cas lives in the body of her dead dad, so that’s a whole thing, but her and Dean really get along. And Jack’s all of ours. Cas and Dean and me. It’s not the suburban-values, Tuesday-soccer-practice, PTA-fundraiser, apple-pie sort of set-up, but it’s family. And, actually, there’s no shortage of pie.”
“Yeah. That’d be the antivenom,” said Sam.
“I hadn’t gone back in those woods since I was a teenager, but they’re never out of view entirely. After that, I could see him. Between the trees. Waiting for me. Waiting to deliver on that promise. And when Moira lost the pregnancy, it was still early days… I was relieved. And it was awful, and we broke up, and I couldn’t do it again. I couldn’t risk it. A family, having kids, even if I adopted them there would always be a chance. This thing’s haunted me, ruined me. And it could take another kid in this town at any time, and they keep on going and having their parties in the woods and I don’t know what to do to stop it.”
“Does Cas know about this plan?”
“Come back to me.” Dean’s voice creaked one final time from his lungs.
He woke briefly, was pulled under again. This time walking through the moonlit mountain town, looking at the stars through his breath misting in the cold. He walked beside a man, his sleeve brushing against a tan trench coat. Blue eyes that looked at Dean, looked into Dean. Saw everything and loved everything. In the dream he understood it with such impossible clarity. It had always been love.
“I should have known, somehow,” said Past-Cas, looking across the room with that disciplined, soldierly expression. “I should have broken free on my own.”
“So even the thought,” Young Dean said, filling in the gaps he knew his mind would make. “Even the thought of being with him reminds you of that. That’s… that’s just awesome. Great. Real healthy. I’m so glad we managed to fuck up the one good thing that might happen to us, all because we… yeah.” He swallowed hard. “Yeah. Good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dude, I like the movie,” Sam said. “I don’t get why you keep saying I don’t.”
“Many things,” said Cas, voice heavy.
“No way,” said Holden. “Dean, we’re
“Or if it’s a rite of passage,” Cas took over. “Quite a few of the stories end in marriages, or becoming head of the household in some way, taking up their parents’ mantle.”
“I’m not actually cold, you know,” said Cas, coming to the counter. He’d only worn Dean’s winter things to blend in and not draw attention.
“And you have those? What are we waiting for?”
She pulled out the subject drawer under ‘G’, flipping through the cards expertly. “Griffins are Greek, I believe?” she said. “You might look under ‘chimera’ as well, or even ‘manticore.’ Here’s one that might do…” She stopped at one of the index cards, then took a scrap of paper from the top of the catalogue and jotted down a call number and the brief title of a book in very tidy writing. She followed this with some additional numbers set to neat bullet points. “Greek fiction and epics are under 883, but look around that section. Some of it might be under Greek Mythology in the 290s, too.”
Young Dean sauntered over to Dean, surveying the orchard. “Most of my hunts end in a cemetery at night,” he said. “Frozen through and covered in graveyard dirt. This isn’t the worst send-off.”
“I have a very strong attachment to Teen-Dean, as Castiel has to you,” said Past-Cas.
“I told him when we were done with this, maybe Cas and I could help him figure something out,” said Dean.
Eli turned his head away. “I don’t remember dying,” he said. “I remember running. Running away from something. I tried to get out of the woods. It was dark. Something was hunting me. I remember thinking if the sun just came up, I’d be saved. I thought of everything in my life up until I came into the woods and how much I wanted to go back and wished I’d never come. And then the sun did come up. But it didn’t save me. It was the last thing I saw. After that, I don’t know how long after, I remember realising I was dead and would never go home. But I don’t remember how I died.”
“You said ‘fuck.’ I don’t think I’ve heard you do that. Is this another fading-grace thing?”
“I knew your grandma a long time ago,” said Young Dean, looking to Wallis again. “She knew she might not be alive when I came back here, but she hoped the house would still be in the family. She gave me this.” He reached into the pocket of his jeans and took out a Celtic cross on a cord, meant to be worn as a necklace.
“She is smart. So whatever the circumstances, they must have been very persuasive.”
Cas drew his face back, though Young Dean tried to follow. He wanted to steamroll past the gentle rejection with another kiss.
Cas had a more furrowed brow, gaze distant, hands loosely wrapped around his mug of coffee on the counter. “He said he had a tough start in the new world.” He looked across at Dean. “But that he didn’t want us to worry. I should’ve pressed him on that. I think I tried, even. But he… he redirected very smoothly.”
“You two stay around the party?” Dean asked.
“Eliza?” said Cas.
“Approximately,” said Cas.
He didn’t, actually. He wanted to be in the thick of it. But this was far, far outside of his weight class. He stepped backwards in the sand, till the water of the beach lapped at the heels of his boots.
“How is the new world?” Cas asked.
“Can you know that for sure?” Sam asked. “That’s what prayer is about. Having faith. Even if you don’t get an answer.”
“I wondered what happened to that coat,” said Young Dean.
“Dean,” said Sam, stopping him ahead of the door. “You and me have a different relationship to Dad. And that is what it is. I’ve tried to follow your guidance on him before. I accepted certain things I couldn’t when he was alive. And if you forgive him, fine, that’s your prerogative. But I don’t know if I can anymore.”
“It’s the Santa Ana winds south of us. It’s not good for the supernatural,” she said, emptying the scorched contents of her pan into the trash. “People who
“I’ve met some of the people you hang around with,” said Dean. “I don’t think you were ever lacking ‘interesting.’”
Young Dean wanted to touch it, that secret laugh. That mouth in general. He wouldn’t normally have thought it. He would have stopped himself before allowing his brain to consider that he found a man genuinely attractive. Maybe it was the alcohol, or maybe it was knowing what future feelings were, but Young Dean didn’t make himself stop thinking it this time.
“Tone it down, Narcissus,” said Sam.
“I think you just earned a BA, for that,” said Sam.
“Said he’d let me go if one day I brought him my firstborn.”
“She’s getting a good tip, yeah.”
“Anything to do with the one-eyed monster’s gotta be serious,” said Dean.
He spent most of the bus ride staring out the window, bored and ponderous. He forgot the library book he borrowed back at the motel, not having read more than a few of the short stories within. Meanwhile the Men of Letters books would attract too much attention for him to pull out here. Not, he mused, that they would be the strangest thing the interior of a Greyhound had seen.
The idea was so radically implausible that there could be no promise it would actually work. Not three weeks ago, Dean hadn’t known a thing about griffins or angels or dualistic godheads. He’d never practiced a spell in his life, and John would have torn a strip off him if he suspected Dean of dabbling in anything that looked like witchcraft. Of course, that wasn’t the only thing his dad would crucify him for.
“Good as anywhere,” said Dean.
“Well I don’t think you parted friends,” said Sam, rubbing at where his wrists had been tied. “I don’t like knowing he’s still out there.”
“There’s a what now?”
“Oh there it is,” said Dean, thwarting another hit. “Gloves just came off.”
). Dejemos de hablar hasta que hagamos la palabra luminosa y activa (
He crossed to Young Dean as Jody left the room, patting a hand against his shoulder. “It’s your lucky break, kid,” he said. “Jody wants you for a grocery run.”
The sea hags took the form of naked old women. Their skin had a bioluminescent sheen, their eyes overlarge and pale for seeing through dark water. One looked to have netting wrapped carelessly around her middle, another had been crusted over with barnacles along one hip and thigh. The foremost hag had the longest hair, a starfish caught in the tangles. She crawled forward to the bottle of moonshine, wrapping one webbed hand around it.
And another difference, Dean didn’t doubt who he was and knew certain truths about himself that couldn’t be shaken. Future Dean regretted how he let his father’s words sink into him and shape him. He made himself believe that John was acting out of care, acting for the best. That clearly wasn’t how he saw it two decades on.
“This really is little-you?” Eileen said, a spark of amusement rising in her expression. Seeing it, Dean realised he’d genuinely missed the ever-present mischievous glimmer she had in her eyes. Of course it was good to have Eileen back, that went without saying. But this was one of those particular, specific things that drove home how easy and fun it was to have her around.
“I thought you wanted me for a decoy,” said Bobby. “Thought maybe you had some girl you wanted to see.”
Crowley eyed Dean hard, but a clever mind like his had to know there were no other fast options. He raised a hand. Young Dean took in a sharp breath, lifting his forearm as the words of the contract glowed out of his skin, then fell apart like the crumbling embers of a fire.
“We were trying to reach me and Cas,” said Dean. “I mean in the future. The present, I guess. We’ll get out of your hair, alright?”
“No, of course you haven’t,” said Sam. “You’re smart enough. You could if you wanted. But Dad says ‘hunt’ and you just ask where to aim.”
Dean studied Lanie a moment longer, then followed the direction of her gaze. Young Dean settled on the motorbike and started the engine. He looked over his shoulder once and waved at them before taking off.
“They’re never gonna let you be free,” Dean said, focusing still on Peter. “There’ll always be one more deal. One more job.”
“Shit,” said Dean.
“Never stayed over,” Young Dean said. “The upstairs is new to me.”
“He has been acting without orders,” said the angel at Cas’ right again.
“Figured out what?”
It had always been Dean’s job to look out for others and save lives without expecting the same in return. His duty alone, because he was the one who had to compensate, somehow, for all his faults and failures and sins. He’d rarely been looked after in turn, and seldom understood it when someone like Bobby treated him well with no motive or agenda. That didn’t mean he never wanted it. The chasm between what he felt he deserved and what he wanted had been so wide he could barely see across it. But these days, ever since he started talking with his younger self, the other side was coming into sight. To dream that the two sides would fully meet seemed too much to ask, but perhaps in places they’d come close. Perhaps one day a bridge wouldn’t be out of the question.
Young Dean went silent over the line. “Okay,” he said at last. “Alright.”
Before Dean could interject with a dubious response, Jack said, “Start at the beginning. It helps if we know as much as we can.”
“Well. Someone’s been in my head,” said Dean.
“We are here by divine command,” Past-Cas said. He nodded at his counterpart. “Castiel received revelation that we were to come.” Turning more to Cas he added, “I enacted the blood spell as requested, though it brought us somewhat unexpectedly to Claire Novak.”
“You would. And you did,” said Young Dean.
“Let’s show him what we’ve worked out so far,” Jody said. “It’s a starting point, at least.”
“Every damn day,” said Dean. “Either he hasn’t got his ears on, or he doesn’t want to hear it. Or…” He grimaced, looking around. It felt like blasphemy. “Maybe praying doesn’t work up here.”
“Does he actually think we can promise that?” Past-Cas asked Castiel.
“He’s murdered countless humans,” said Cas. “Including going out of his way to kill those you’d saved.”
“Holy shit.” A different voice, approaching Young Dean, who hadn’t looked away from the face of his older counterpart. The older Dean had only just redirected his attention from Cas to Young Dean. Looked him over with a passively critical glance. Young Dean made a scornful face in return, then turned his head over his shoulder towards the other voice he heard.
“You should come here,” said Dean. Not his smoothest line.
“You brought me here in a dream,” said Past-Cas, coming to stand by Young Dean’s elbow.
“You told Past-Cas about it though,” said Young Dean. “So he knows more than me too.”
“Looks like we’ll have to hit the road,” said Dean, not that he seemed to mind. He felt in control behind the wheel of his car, and would rather be out doing things than stuck inside researching.
“You didn’t ask for anything,” Cas pointed out.
“It’s the point of the thing,” said Dean. “Quit arguing with me. You get your GED because you get your GED. Nothing I say to you now changes that.”
“I take it there’s a spell involved?” said Wallis.
“What would you want to keep?” Cas asked.
“I’d worked out that much,” said Dean. “I would, too.”
Amara was the first to raise both hands, palm out, one arm extended towards Jack, the other towards Chuck. In a heartbeat Jack had mirrored this, with Chuck on his heels, fast on the draw.
“Cas and I will go scrounge up some supper,” said Sam, taking the keys to the Expedition. “The clerk mentioned a decent family restaurant. Should be back in half an hour. Don’t kill your double.”
“Did she? I must’ve missed that.”
“But the… the ‘calibration’ of the universe,” said Young Dean, voice low and quiet. “Everything that happened to you, to us, it’s all part of the timeline. Even the terrible parts.” He didn’t sound much like he believed himself.
“But then again, you’re not talking about fighting and hunting,” said Cas.
“Oh shit,” said Sam.
Cas’ gaze dropped. “It has been a long time since someone has prayed to me directly,” he said. “I thought mankind had forgotten.”
“You thought the Fisher King had the Grail?” said Eileen.
“Heaven could use some shaking up,” said Cas. He paused a moment, thinking out his words before speaking. “Sometimes I wonder…” he said. He lifted one hand, the one he used to heal and smite, twisting it and looking at it curiously. “My grace is fading. Is it the waning of Heaven’s power, or is it only me? What will I be once it’s gone? Human, like you?” He looked across at Dean again. “Maybe even the Tree of Life has to die one day. And maybe it wouldn’t mind.”
. He sighed deeply. “I’m starting to appreciate that having a whole-ass library doesn’t actually make things easier.”
“Oh honey,” said Essie. “Not all hunting has to be hard. Most witches are just girls—often girls—with no power and no means who get pulled in. First, it’s just a spell to make rent or to get their baby over that terrible cough. They don’t go in to hurt anyone. Then the power gets addictive, the spells get bigger, the threefold consequences to others are just collateral. I try to get them out before they get too deep, before it becomes a fight. They’re just people, you know. Just humans.”
it, asshole,” he said.
“What’s that for?” Dean asked. He didn’t remember a candle in the spell, and he didn’t trust the look of it.
At least twice a year, the Immortals would get it in their head to hold a Wild Hunt. Easy to guess what the prey was. Each Hunt lasted for three harrowing days, and when Dean met his fellow mortals again, they were always fewer in number. He learned better than to grow attached to the lost and wandering souls. You offered assistance and aid, you crowded around a fire at night and took turns telling stories, trying to make your past feel real again, but you didn’t hope to see them again when the Immortals devised a fresh game.
“Isn’t it? I wouldn’t have invited you to the future if I knew the consequences it would have. For you. And, potentially, everything.”
They had a simple breakfast of cereal, fruit, toast, and then scattered through the house with Essie’s library books to continue their research. They had an early breakthrough, an email from one of Essie’s contacts passing on intel about some credible rumours that the Arimaspoi had some sort of compound in the Santa Lucia Mountains.
“You ready to tell me what’s going on here?” Claire asked. She stepped down from her bed. She still looked wary, but at least she wasn’t pointing the gun anywhere. “Why are you all… young?”
“And Cas?” asked Dean.
Sam caught his breath, looking down at himself with surprise. Cas tossed the beam out of the way as if it weighed no more than a pool cue. “Dean, are you—?”
Waylon looked away, licking his dry lips. “Yeah, that tracks,” he said, hollow. He cleared his throat and found his voice again. “Can’t have one good thing.”
to do,” she said. “Jack may not have full control, but he’s keeping us tethered here. He had so much faith you’d figure something out eventually.”
“Dean thinks I look like an accountant,” said Cas.
It was a bit of a mindfuck.
“Cas, that you?” he called out.
“I’m your huckleberry.”
“I saw it,” Cas said, turning to look at Dean with that perfectly earnest, steady gaze. A dozen years later, but in some moments Dean still saw those shades of angelic innocence from their very first meeting and swore Cas’ face hadn’t changed a day. Cas tipped his head faintly in concession and added, “As one-sided.”
“Your
Dean kept looking upwards, but now it was as much to search the sky as to keep the water in his eyes from spilling over. Zachariah’s words began to sink in. Dean’s first and natural response had been resistance and denial, but now, thoughts moving with the same pace as the slow morning dawn, he became aware of his powerlessness. The angels had taken Cas to a place Dean could not go except by death, and suicide forfeited the destination. They were going to make Cas forget everything. They were going to hurt him. Perhaps had already started and Dean could do nothing but kneel here and beg. Pleading and bargaining with Heaven to spare Castiel.
“I was,” said Mary. She didn’t look at him much, her eyes focused somewhere between the porch railings. Her hand circled her glass of lemonade, leaving broad empty swathes in the condensation.
Dean paused, wallet flipped open in his hand. He started to thumb through the different credit cards. “About Cas?” he said, not looking at Young Dean. He took a card out of its pocket and tapped it idly against the inside of the wallet.
“It’s hard to say.” Cas flicked his gaze over Dean again.
No answer. That wasn’t good. He went back down the three front steps, angling around the side of the house. Voices rose in easy dialogue, and when he recognised one as Jody’s he reached around the iron gate (good choice, he thought) to easily lift the latch and let himself in. He followed a sandy, flagstone path winding its way under lush tree branches.
Jack looked up at him with that clear search for approval, questioning whether he dared to believe Dean meant what he said. God, this was his
“No,” said Waylon. “And I tried asking people if they knew, but…”
Dean scowled.
“So… So angels can’t fall in love?” he asked. He had to be sure.
“What kind of signal?” Dean asked. He was already gesturing for Past-Cas to come closer, to be at the ready.
“And?” said Amara.
“We’re supposed to have everything we need,” said Mary. “What’s left to pray for?”
Eliza shook her head. “There are no prophets,” she insisted.
? Or even,
“I’ve been reset many times,” said Cas.
“I’ll keep poking around,” said Ms. Odobo, and Dean had the distinct impression that researching a dead teenager from the 90s might actually win out over home greenhouse daydreams.
“So this is where you’ve been,” said Chuck. “You know I hate to miss the action. Remind me when this is over to sort out Heaven-DVR.”
“Where he’s supposed to be meeting the Arimaspoi is pretty remote. He warned us he might run out of signal.”
“Old, old marrieds,” Wallis said against the rim of her lemonade glass just before taking a sip.
“I’d wait longer than that, if I had to. If it meant I have this,” said Cas. “Oh. Hold on. I did.”
“Oh good. It can see us but we can’t see it,” said Castiel. “Dean, we are not going with these… these Dark Watchers that only you and Teen-Dean can see.”
“I missed everything!” said Eileen. “How? When? Did one of them die again?”
Dean ducked his head a shade, the smile on his face belying any attempt at contrition. “Sorry,” he said, although too pleased to sound it. “Guess I just wanted it bad enough.”
Cas kissed
“Dean…” A sudden displacement, the sound of flapping wings cutting through any intended words, and Dean stood with Past-Cas before them.
Around eleven, when they were an hour beyond Kansas City, a call came through on Sam’s phone. The blocked number was almost certainly the burner phone they loaned to Young Dean.
Cas nodded, and then he was gone. Young Dean looked up at the dark rafters, searching for his way up. A brief flash of light—a slice, not a fatal blow—still left him seeing spots. He had only a shaky idea of a path up the half-collapsed barn to where they fought on the highest level above the granary. He’d faced narrower odds and tighter escapes than this. He caught the first non-broken rung of a built-in ladder and started up.
How many days would he come home to Cas asleep in a chair just like this? With his blue chin, his rumpled clothes. Perhaps with his thumb marking the page of an unfinished book. Perhaps with kids running around causing chaos while their dad slept. The ache he felt wasn’t worry, but longing.
“Believe me, he’s got nothing on my dad,” she said.
“Yeah,” said Dean. “That’s me.”
“They took us by surprise,” said Holden. “And outnumbered us three-to-one.”
“Cas,” he said, and the word didn’t break the spell, but Dean saw a flash of black from the corner of his eye beyond the diner window that did.
» agh, I could easily have made that entire song the epigraph to this chapter. I just… “
“Right,” said Dean. “But y’know, there’s three of you…” He was thinking too much of his Spaghetti Westerns again. It probably wasn’t the time for it. And yet... “But two of you want the same thing— We do want the same thing, right? Even though he’s your brother?”
“Whoa, hey,” Dean said as he complied, walking slowly to let the others go first, lamely attempting a smile. “No need for all that. Just some farmhands looking for work. No offense, but you look like you could use the help around here.”
“Food’s not about punishment, no matter how mad I am,” said Dean. “You need to eat, then you eat.”
“So we’re really leaving Dad?” said Sam. “Like, is this for good?”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” said Eli. “I don’t want to hurt anyone.”
“Is he serious?” Holden asked Young Dean, playfully throwing an arm around his shoulders, jostling him on purpose. “I’ve always wanted brothers.”
“When I say ‘it’s complicated’ I mean ‘it’s
“So he’s been here,” said Dean. “Cas has been here.”
“Future Cas would know,” said Dean.
everywhere is so cumbersome. I want to be able to swoop in and pull you out of danger when you and Sam inevitably do something reckless, and there have been so many close calls. I’m made to fight with all my powers and it feels right to do so.”
“You’re building me up too much,” said Dean. “There were things you were right about, earlier. Being miserable. Being a coward.”
They drove back down towards the coast in the early afternoon to have a late lunch. Everything was overpriced and self-consciously rustic, but the setting couldn’t have been better. Mountains directly behind them, sea directly ahead. As they waited for their order, Young Dean wandered to the edge of the gravel parking lot for a better view out.
“You changed your look, Cas,” said Eileen.
Dean and Eli both looked over. Eli looked back at Dean with a question in his eyes.
“No,” said Mary with a faint shake of her head. She still looked unseeingly ahead. “One moment I was in a room in the house with John, and next time I thought of trying the door it opened out and there was more. I didn’t use to think of trying the door.”
Sam took off his backpack, rooting to the bottom for the first aid stock.
“I need you to call me in on a job.”
“Course I’m human,” said Dean. “What else would I be?”
Young Dean caught some rest, despite feeling aware even in unconsciousness of the flashing light outside that cut through the blinds. In the morning the four of them met at the Impala. While Dean reordered some of the things in the trunk, Young Dean asked Cas, “Where were you two last night?”
Dean leaned back a little in the seat, looking out at the road and letting it be his only focus for a long moment.
Dean tossed away another fallen branch. “You really thought this through? I mean, you sure about this?”
“It’s all the cardio,” said Dean with a meaningful wink. Both Deans, thinking this in excellent good humour and taste, mirrored one another with an unflattering snicker. They high-fived. Cas gave a long-suffering sigh, less for the topic than the self-mindedness.
“You know something, Cas?” said Dean. Cas looked over and raised a brow. “I think I do too.”
Despite all her enthusiasm for research, Essie was the one to close up her journals and call it a night. “Library’s closing,” she said. “You don’t get anywhere by breaking your brain over old books. We could all do with some time to enjoy ourselves.”
“I started remembering,” said Young Dean. “I was supposed to forget everything that happened, but it came back. So I introduced myself to Cas from my time—”
They walked up a narrow macadam farm road and crossed over a set of old train tracks. Rows of young grapevines, recently harvested, covered the farmland on one side, field and forest on the other. Parked on the side of the highway were a couple of tractors with wooden trailers, one labelled with the name of a winery established only a few years before. A quiet, rural place at this time, but one that modernity would encroach on quickly in the span of twenty years.
He cut off, spotting Castiel caught in the morning sun just outside the door. He entered the restaurant with the jangle of the bell.
It made Mary laugh genuinely for the first time since he’d got here.
“Your go, pal,” said someone at Young Dean’s elbow.
“I haven’t even been able to really let her loose,” said Dean with a pang of envy. “Damn.”
There likely was a news article. It was likely from ten or twenty or thirty years ago.
“It’s not about that, not at all,” said Lanie with an ease that Dean envied. “It’s about boundaries. My mom will never let it go if she knows I’m seeing someone. She’ll get on me about settling down, and I just… I don’t like people pushing me. Having expectations for me. If there’s something I want, I’ll go about it my own time.”
“It is fitting,” said Past-Cas. In a natural movement lacking his usual angelic restraint, his fingers threaded through Young Dean’s hair. “Neither would I.”
“No, stay,” said Dean, putting out a hand, fingertips brushing Cas’ bare forearm. “Stay. I do have a question for you.”

Young Dean snorted. “Who’s ogling now?” he said to Dean.
“Sometimes you gotta,” said Dean with a shrug.
Dean couldn’t help but smirk. Okay, he could buy that. But god, it was strange to think that at age nineteen his brain was just so cocky and elastic at once that he could identify that kind of thing with ease instead of creating an elaborate story as to why it wasn’t the case.
me.” He looked at Mary directly, their eyes meeting properly for the first time in he didn’t know how long. “It was the very last thing he said.”
But still. Scary. Unsettling. He wanted to push past this.
“Alright,” said Young Dean, backing down like the fight bored him more than anything. “So, what else we got? Never had a bar mitzvah or rumspringa or debutante ball.”
“How’d you get away?” Dean asked, setting a glass of water in front of Sam, who accepted it gratefully.
Dean drew in a breath and pulled back from the table, gaze shifty. “Come on, we don’t have to do this.”
“You’re such a little shit,” Dean hissed.
“Right,” said Dean. “He’s me.”
“Why don’t you two grab a seat?” Dean said to Sam and Cas. “Me and the kid will chat.” He didn’t know what Young Dean might have to say, but there was always a chance he didn’t want others to hear it. Sam especially. There was more that Cas knew, sure, but even then, Dean hated to hear it dredged up in front of him. Having these conversations with his younger self, while still brutal, at least stayed relatively private.
Theoretically.

“And what do you want out of this anyways, Dean?” said Bobby. “Because it seems to me that you’ve gotten attached to that glimpse of the future you had. What, you want to abandon the here and now for what you think is some better year?”
Young Dean bore the admonishment because in some ways having failed was nothing new to him. He didn’t know what he hated more, though. Knowing he deserved Dean’s reproval, or seeing his father’s face in his own.
“No, Cas,” said Young Dean, out of loyalty rather than logic. “It’s not on you.”
But here is the truth of nostalgia. We don’t feel it for who we were, but who we weren’t. We feel it for all the possibilities that were open to us, but that we didn’t take.
“Really?” said Dean, eyes flicking over Cas.
“Yeah, you’re more fluent than I am,” said Sam, who at least did his best with signing whenever he spoke.
They left Eliza to her clay, night falling around them here on the Eastern side of the States.
Dean should find that a relief. And it was, to some extent. He didn’t need to worry that Jack’s heart was getting tied up in this case, and he didn’t have to figure out whether or not Jack was too young for a relationship when he didn’t properly know what age Jack could be considered. But the response answered fewer questions than Dean had hoped it would. He didn’t know if Jack had romantic feelings at all, if Jack had any specific orientation, or if this was something he’d need to worry about in the future.
“Stow it,” said Dean. “You have no idea the shit Cas and I have put each other through. The things we’ve forgiven. You think you need to be forgiven because you did what you had to in the name of getting back to him?”
“It told us where to find them,” said Dean. “They’ll leave us to finish our task tonight.”
“There,” said Crowley. “I knew we could be civilized.”
Dean expected the hags to leave the way they came, dipping below the water to swim away with a diminishing glow and descend to the bottom of the ocean once more. Instead, the three sisters vanished at once by way of bursting into sea foam, dissolving into the water and becoming part of a rising wave that washed over Young Dean. Slack and half-senseless with liquor, it knocked Young Dean backwards into the water.
Young Dean spoke again, seamlessly following where Past-Cas left off, and now light radiated from the lines of the mandala. Not just blinding white, but rich coloured bands as well, as if it had already refracted then purified itself into something more. Creation of light. Creation of colour. Creation of worlds.
“Uh-huh,” said Lanie, arms folded over her stomach. She eyed Dean for a moment, then looked away. “Mom keeps saying she has a lot to tell me.” She scuffed the heel of her foot against the tile of the kitchen floor. “I sorta figured it was the same-old same-old.”
“I just don’t know why you’re so scared,” said Young Dean. “When it’s so clear he’s got something for you.”
They were silent for the first fifteen minutes of their drive, chewing up the open highway with no real destination beyond.
“It’s not too late,” he told Scott. He lifted his gaze from the ground, the look in his eyes harder than he intended it to be. “I know a bit about what it is to forfeit. You get dealt a shitty hand in life and you cut yourself off from wanting things. Having things.” He felt Jack’s eyes on him and spared a brief glance in his direction. “Family’s something worth going after,” he said. “I don’t want to save your ass here and find out you spend the next forty years sitting around and moping. You got that?”
“Yeah,” said Dean. “That sounds about right.” He closed his eyes. A stranger. He was just a stranger to Cas and it was more than he could stand. He felt himself helplessly unravelling. “Everything— Everything’s been so messed up, Cas. Feels like I’ve been at the end of my rope for years now. I don’t know how I haven’t folded before this, only there’s something too important— You’ve gotta know just how important…”
“I’m not as strong as you,” said Cas. “But I know as much and more.”
“Yeah,” Dean said uncertainly. “Griffins.”
“A night and a day,” said Young Dean. “Yeah.”
“I said, can you make yourself younger,” Dean repeated. “Could you make yourself my age? What this guy looked like at my age?”
“Cas?” he said. “I know you may need time to come around to me. And I know I’m not him yet, the one you’ll eventually want. The one you’ll live and fight and die for. But I just, uh… I just want you to know that if this was really how we met, I mean if this was what either of us got to remember, I wouldn’t need to wait twelve years.”

“That’s what caught me about this,” said Holden. “She brings up the Creation of Adam, who was made from dirt or clay. She was upset at the idea of ‘imitating Creation.’ Maybe Castiel isn’t the first angel to think of bypassing a living human vessel.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered. Amara was still there.
“No,” said Dean. He glanced at Sam and took over for him. “She’s working with the thing she was supposed to be fighting.”

“Probably he thought the spell would take you straight to him,” said Dean. “But you know what I just realised? We left Baby back at a car rental place in Casper, he’ll have to go there first.”

Past-Cas pressed his lips briefly, eyes narrowing as he tipped his head up towards the sky. “I am a soldier,” he said. “I am accustomed to being useful and following directions. Being part of a larger plan. This… this feels like chaos to me. My orders were lies and have now evaporated. The purpose for which I was brought I cannot execute. And it seems such a paltry quest: I have fought in heavenly battles with cosmic consequences, and yet I cannot find one man in one relatively contained landmass.”
“Fuck you, who you calling profane?” Young Dean asked, looking up from his work at the centre of the mandala with a grin.
Dean gave a quick, simple shake of his head. “I’m not,” he said. This wasn’t something that was going to disappear tomorrow. Not on either side.
Eileen made eye contact with Young Dean, then tossed him the glowing sword. He caught it by the hilt.
“I think I may know where to get it,” said Essie.
“Then we have to believe that they must be after the sword as well. And they might not be the only ones who know it exists.”
Dean followed them to the bottom of the stairs, but stopped just short. “You go on ahead,” he said to Young Dean. He caught Cas’ sleeve; a request for him to stay. “We’ll be right there.”

“Hell, I could eat,” said Young Dean. “What d’you got in this joint?”
“I just told you,” said Dean. “I remember it all. You don’t have to play. It’s not your fault it didn’t take, man. Actually, it’s a gift to remember.”
“Wouldn’t be so sure of that,” said Young Dean, hands touching his ribs. “Felt like I got tumbled through the drier. But I must have got the edge of it. When it stopped, my one arm was above the snow and I dug myself out of it.”
“I’m gonna marry him,” Dean said to Sam. “Proper.”
“I guess we’ll see,” said Cas.
“What? No. It’s not— You know him?”
“What?” said Dean.
“Maybe,” said Waylon. “Why?”
“Like you’re doing right now?” asked Sam. “Risking your own daughter?”
“Could you do it for another angel?” said Young Dean. “Could you make a body and invite him into it?”
They caught up to Sam and Cas on the walkway up to the hayloft’s tall sliding doors.
“Cas,” he said. “I can’t wait to meet you.” He stepped forward, wrapped his arms around Cas in a hug. After a moment Cas’ arms raised up, returning the embrace. Dean didn’t stop himself short, didn’t make himself pull away early. This was his last and only chance, and he wouldn’t give it up for the sake of pride, for the sake of appearances. He let himself feel the rise and fall of his own chest against Castiel’s. He let his chin bury against the snow-damp fabric of Cas’ trench coat.
“She said he’s much more impressive than his older self,” Cas filled in dutifully.
“Who’s the President?” said Sam.
, Bobby, I’m not an idiot.”
“What do we need this Reid Jenkins for?” Jody asked.
“What’d she say?” Dean asked.
“I said it’s nothing,” said Dean. “This is a good night. I don’t want to ruin it.”
we find Jody.” She looked down at her phone, typing in a text. “You have a phone? What am I saying, of course you don’t have a phone. You’re prehistoric. I’ll keep looking for Jody. Tell Dean to call me if he learns
“That’s the thing,” said Dean. “We’ve already been.”
“You’re being sneaky,” said Dean. “Which is something liars do.”
He could see Young Dean did, though. Something different, something unique to them. Something Dean had never had the chance to experience.
Dean pulled his attention quickly back to Betty, flashing a smile. At least the contents of the room gave him an easy segue for steering the conversation towards the purpose of their visit. “Well we don’t intend to impose, ma’am,” he said. “Gotta say, it’s great to see another person so committed to the faith in these parts. There are so many nonbelievers in the world.”
“Not yet. Don’t know if he’d hate me or not if I made breakfast.”
They left the restaurant behind, but Young Dean noticed the thoughtful look Cas directed back toward it. He heaved a sigh. He felt like an idiot for being so corny and soft with the girl back there, but he knew where she was coming from. He knew how many times just one stranger being nice to him would’ve made all the difference. “Whatever it is you want to say,” he said. “Just go ahead and get it over with.”
“I can’t.” Eli tipped his chin a little higher, face angling up. Ghostly tears caught in the scattered moonlight. “I can’t ever go back, can I?”
“He’s supposed to be resting,” Dean said, pointing a fierce finger at Cas. “You have something you gotta say, you come to me about it.”
Young Dean had slumped forward, listening to it all, picturing it all. Picturing what happened in between, in the parts that Dean left out. They had a shorthand with each other. There were things that didn’t need to be said.
Young Dean nodded. He turned his glance down to the garden below the window, where he’d looked at the stars with Past-Cas just the night before. “Good to know,” he said. “I really did corrupt the angel.”
“Funny man,” said the Fisher King. “I don’t like you.”
“So I need the special sword to kill the griffin?”
Jack looked up at him. “Me too,” he said. “And I would. I can feel… I know he was here. Just like in Ohio and Atlantic City. But he hasn’t been back since the night of the party. He was in the woods. I’m sure of it.” Jack looked across as if he could see through the motel walls, to where a rise of thick forest wrapped around the edge of the town.

, it said.
“Yeah, but I didn’t have an angel on my shoulder telling me to clean up my act, then,” said Dean.
“If he’s smart, he’ll keep his mouth shut about most things,” said Dean. “Which is what I would do.”
“Just break the contract,” said Dean.
. A pair of cowboy boots, a horse to ride, some crumpled old bandanas. You wouldn’t ask for more than that.”
“We need to liberate my past self from Heaven,” Cas said to Jack. He reached out a hand to Jack’s shoulder. “I know we just got back.”
Crowley’s head tipped, a loathing scoff crossing his face. “It doesn’t mean much if I can get there first,” he said.
“You’re pulling too far back ahead of that swing,” said Dean. “And you’re striking too high. You should aim here.” He lowered Young Dean’s wrist so that his fist hovered at the correct spot. Young Dean took the chance for a sudden jab with his left fist while Dean was having this teaching moment, but that was caught too. So Young Dean went for the legs with his own in order to trip Dean up, but next thing he was face-down on the floor of the gym.
,” said Sam. “You know, most of those probably are still very real foreskins, though.”
“No, I don’t—” Sam didn’t bother finishing the protestation. “I just mean, the whole premise of it. Their lives are being controlled by coders and storytellers. They think they have free will, but it turns out all their choices were predetermined by some asshole creator who made this park for his own entertainment. Does that… remind you of anything?”
