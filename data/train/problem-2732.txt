“Gabriel go.” Castiel ordered. He had watched Gabriel die. He would never forget how all the warmth had left Gabriel’s body leaving him colder than stone. Castiel would go to his grave remembering the ghostly pallor of his brother’s face as he’d died in his arms. Gabriel could not be made to bare that trauma. Castiel would not let it happen. “Gabriel I mean it you need to
“Jesus Christ, Jessica! Not so loud. Dad cannot find out about this. No one can. I’m not even supposed to tell you but I did because I thought he had asked you to the prom.” Cas explained.
“Claire…did your dad say anything else? Does he seem annoyed?” Cas asked before Gabriel could make a PB&J comment.
“It’s like a fucking flower explosion went off.” Cas muttered back. “I’m glad our wedding wasn’t this tacky.”
“I won’t be too long.” Cas said as he pulled away. He gave Dean one last smile as he jogged back towards the mansion.
“Yes, you definitely have to dazzle at the gala benefit. They hold it at the start of every term. Once the cast list goes up they expect us to be their little ‘angels’ and ‘grace’ the benefactors with our talent. Being the lead means you’ll have to schmooze with them," Cas explained. Dean looked like his world was about to implode. “Yes, that means a suit and tie and talking to people,"
“Who is she talking to?” Michael asked nodding over at Meg. Inias shrugged. “Very insightful Inias.”
.” Dean said grabbing onto Castiel’s wrist and bringing him closer to him. “You’re tired ok? Clearly you didn’t get any sleep last night and you’re clutching at your coffee like it’s a lifesaver. Can you please tell me what is wrong?” Dean asked frowning with concern. Castiel sighed at the concern in Dean’s eyes because if he told Dean what was wrong then that would mean admitting that Castiel was thinking about breaking up with Dean.
“Bela, you really did nothing wrong, we all should have said something, especially after Christmas but...well, we’ve all been busy.”
"Oh hey, it's good to finally meet you. You couldn't make the party last night?" Dean asked as he shook Jessica’s hand. She was tall, blonde and pretty. Too wholesome looking for Dean.
“Oh thank you, Cas. That’s very kind of you to say.” Mary said blushing. Cas realised that when Dean blushed he looked a lot like Mary. “Milton, did you say? You’re not Amy and Richard’s son are you?”
“See you later, bye mom," Cas said quickly, hanging up as he failed yet again to do his tie. “Fucking piece of shit," He muttered.
“How are you even alive this morning? Or did you stay away from Jo’s cocktails?” Sarah asked with sinking shoulders.
He let himself into the building and hurried up the stairs to Sam’s apartment. Sure it was late but hopefully, Sam would be happy to see Dean in the flesh so he wouldn’t bitch too much. Dean unlocked the door, quietly entering the darkened apartment. He crept through the small hallway looking for a light switch when he heard footsteps behind him.
“Of course! You’re friends with Jo and you know Bela so, of course, we would ask you!” Charlie said.
At Dean’s words, Cas surged forward and captured Dean’s lips in his own, biting down on the lower lip as the slow pace he’d worked up on Dean’s dick quickened until Dean was gasping out a strangled gabble of Cas’ name and obscenities. Hands were everywhere as clothing was removed and thrown across the room without care. Cas’ grip on Dean was threatening to make Dean come right there and Dean was close to telling Cas so until, as if he knew, Cas slowed his pace down and captured Dean’s lips yet again. Cas slid off Dean’s boxers until he was completely naked, Cas’ own boxers being the only item of clothing between them.
“Well in Jo’s case it turns her even smugger than she already is and it turns you into a giant bruise,” Dean said nodding at the purple mark on Adam’s arm.
“Jo doesn’t know what she is talking about and I prefer it if you didn’t talk about me behind my back or drag my friends into your gossiping session.” Castiel said as his heartbeat began to quicken. Jo didn’t know much about Castiel, certainly not the stuff Anna knew, but she knew enough. She knew enough to make Dean see just how shitty of a person Castiel’s was.
"Dean, don’t worry about it. Bela told me you seemed busy at the hospital." Michael said. Dean heard a light click on and the rustling of blankets. Damn Michael must not have long gone to bed. Now Dean felt even more guilty for calling so late. "How's it going? Have you scrubbed in on any good surgeries? I was allowed to watch a craniotomy the other day, it was amazing."
Anna gave him a roll of her eyes before saying, with a slight smile “How do you know it’s the art student? I could just really like the syrup.”
"So does that mean that you want me to meet your brothers? Officially this time and not just as someone who ushered me upstairs so I could yell at you or as the random guy in the office on the day you punched Alistair?" Dean asked lightly but the implications behind his words were there. There was no way Dean was ever meeting Michael, if it were possible Castiel wished he'd never met Michael even if they were related. Meeting Gabriel would be easier as long as Gabriel didn’t turn into an overly protective big brother and meeting Luke would be tricky depending on his mood though Castiel would have to remind him several times that Dean wasn’t remotely involved in the fight between Alistair.
“Does it have to be the same way Novak distracts you? ‘Cause I’ve heard Jo’s stories about you two and I don’t-”
She was tall, almost as tall as Castiel was and Dean recognised her from the hospital. She was one of the regular scrub nurses in Castiel procedures but as far as Dean knew they never spoke to one another. The woman smiled as Cas leant closer in order to be heard over the thumping music.
nice to be dancing with you." She said in a sickly sweet tone. "Maybe now I can bring you back to the fold."
Of all the souls he’d witnessed Dean never tired of his brothers. The deep golden hue that shone under Sam’s skin like dappled sunlight always burnt with such strength but such humility. While Dean would shy away from looking at other’s souls he would never stop watching his brother’s. As long as it stayed that pure gold Dean thought his brother was completely safe.
“They love their Friday night dinners so they’re always happy to have people there. Balthazar and Gabriel will probably be there as well.” Cas said.
“You’re so hard working darling. It’s really impressing everyone.” Amy said. Cas gave her a quick smile before wolfing down his breakfast.
“Those fucking tenth graders can suck my fucking dick.” Cas called out loudly. Dean could practically hear Jimmy roll his eyes on the other end.
“Shut up, it’s just some administration crap.” He said grinding his hips down against Dean’s. “It can wait, this can’t,” he said pulling Dean’s scrub pants completely off.
“You’re quitting.” Dean said. Josie’s nostrils flared. "Fine, someone get her a box of Marlboros! Menthol!” Yet more assistants and interns went scurrying. “I’ll find him. I promise.” Dean said back to Josie. She gave him a rare smile, which still looked kind of scary, and let out a sigh.
“I’ll see you later for dinner.” He said though Castiel highly doubted his father would be back from work in time to witness the bloodbath that was the Novak family dinner.
“Good, now get on the bus and call me when you get there.” Dean pressed. Cas nodded and swiftly climbed aboard the bus. Dean waved him goodbye and it wasn’t until the bus had left the parking lot that he realised Dr Josie Sands was stood next to him.
“No, of course, I don’t mind. Is everything alright?” Castiel asked lacing his hand through Dean’s. It was small touches like these that Dean had missed when he was single even if they were good at distracting Dean from his thought process.
“Is everything alright Castiel?” his father asked giving him a concerned look. It actually took Castiel a moment to place the look as that of concern because his father hadn’t looked at him like that in a long time.
"You're still in love with him?" Jimmy asked. Dean didn't say a word. He wasn't sure how Jimmy would react to all this. "You never got your tattoo removed." Dean looked down at his left hand, the black inking of 'D&C' looking back at him. No, he had never gotten the inking removed. It never felt right to erase Cas from his life.
He was scared, he was completely blind as to what was going to happen but he knew that he wouldn’t be alone. His family would be ok, the company his family worked so hard to build would be in safe hands. Yes, he was scared but he wouldn’t be alone and that was all he cared about.
“It’s fine, don’t worry. Jo is still passed out but I think your brother is cleaning at the moment. Your disappearance didn’t go unnoticed by the way. Did you sleep here to try and get to the good surgeries or something like that?” Sarah asked.
“I don’t know about you, but I need caffeine, nicotine and a nap,” Bela said dramatically as she wrapped herself up in a huge cashmere cardigan.
Dean smirked at the impressive hickey he had left on Cas' collarbone. It was just in the right position to be hidden by Cas' scrubs but Dean got a kick out of knowing it was there.
“He was in the library earlier on but I haven’t heard from him since.” Jimmy said. “You could try his room but I don’t think he’s there.” He added.
“Who knows?” Gabriel asked shrugging his shoulders. “Does anyone in this family actually talk about anything without fighting or awkwardly ignoring someone for weeks on end?” Gabriel had a point there seeing as Castiel had done the exact same thing with Dean and would probably end doing it again after all his drunken memories returned to him. “Dad wants us all to sit down and have a family dinner tonight though. We’re having Italian and before you ask, no you cannot skip it and go to Anna’s. She’s probably sick of you if you passed out at her house last night.”
"Bout time he found someone," Benny said. Dean's eyebrows shot up in surprise and Benny chuckled gruffly. "I ain't here to judge you brother,” Benny added holding up his hands in defence. “You two would work together."
"He started it." Dean pointed out before letting out a sigh of relief. "Fuck…I was convinced I was going to be fired." He said breathily.
Cas watched as Dean threw an oversized hoodie on over his dancing clothes. The fabric looked buttery soft from constant wear. Cas had the insane urge to run his fingers across it.
They had been thrown together by the most impossible of circumstances and now Castiel was putting his life in Dean’s hands. It felt as if the bond that had begun ten years before was swiftly returning. Even though Castiel held a lot of resentment towards Dean for putting him in this position he couldn’t stop the rush of conflicting emotions he felt whenever he was around Dean.
“Yeah…can you be a good brother and not tell Jo that I’m here just yet? I think I just need some space.” Dean said. Shit, he’d forgotten that Jo might have had the biggest fit when he didn’t show up at the hospital.
“Watch your tone here boy” An angel commanded from the far end of the field. Dean fought against the shudder that rippled through his body as the angel marched towards him. Raphael carried on walking until he was mere inches away from Dean’s face, a deep frown cemented into his face.
“I’m going back into the house.” Castiel said quickly trying to pull himself up from the step. The alcohol in Meg’s hipflask must have been stronger than he thought or he must have drunk more than he initially guessed he had because not only was it difficult standing up but his head was beginning to swim with a familiar sensation. His arms and legs were heavy like lead and his head felt like it wasn’t his own. Castiel knew this feeling and gladly welcomed it though he wished he could remind standing for longer than a second as it would make walking back into the house a lot easier than it was at that moment. Slowly a different sensation reached his brain, a sense of pressure on his arm that he never felt when drunk. Looking down at his arm Castiel was surprised to see a hand gripping onto his wrist. A leather sleeve covered the wrist of the owner of the hand. Of course it would be Dean, who else would it be?
“Thank you,” Cas said, making sure he didn’t falter even a fraction of an inch. As Balthazar walked away Jo snorted.
“Excuse me?” a woman asked tapping Castiel on the arm. He looked up to see a tired looking woman. Her dark hair was pulled away from her face with an elastic band and it seemed as though her mind was elsewhere. “Sorry but I couldn’t help but overhear you just.” She said, her cheeks pinking.
He picked up the Styrofoam cup full of coffee and leant against the nearest wall. This was the first break he’d gotten in hours and his body was craving caffeine. Well if he was being perfectly honest his body was craving sleeping for about a week and a half but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon so the coffee would have to suffice.
The office was elaborately decorated for a surgeon's office and looked more like an antique store than a workspace. It was just as Dean was wondering if the deer head that mounted the wall was real that he saw Cas sitting in a low backed chair opposite Crowley. Fuck. "
Dean didn’t have a freaking clue what the hell Snapchat was, Sam probably would though knowing him, but the knowledge that both Jo and Charlie were discussing him and Cas was not something that filled him with joy.
“Well yeah…it’s kind of dumb though.” Dean said, scratching his neck like he always did when he was nervous. “I don’t know if you remember the Carver Edlund books I was talking about on the first night.”
“Holy crap! Is that Jack? Wow kid, you grew up! Wait, don’t the twins have to be identical for the parent trap to work?”
“I’m so sorry Castiel, I tried to stop him from coming in but you know what he’s like.” Hannah said shifting her weight nervously from one foot to another. “He barges in like a bull and doesn’t care about anyone who stands in his way.”
“Ok…oh! Sam told me that Adam is coming to visit next week!” Charlie said excitedly. “Are you looking forward to it?”
“It's a pleasure to meet you too Sam,” Cas said warmly. “Dean has told me a lot about you. How are your studies going?”
“Dude you look…weird. What’s going on? You ok?” Sam asked as they watched over the scenes unfolding on the patio. One of Charlie’s girls was pulling at her dress to make her boobs more noticeable. She was one more pull away from showing nipple.
To be honest, Dean had been ignoring her over the past few days. He’d been spending nearly all his time either in ORs scrubbing in on Cas’ surgeries or in the research library at the hospital. It was easier than having Jo or Charlie make jokes about him and Cas. All of this reminded him too much of those few months after his friends found out about his bisexuality when he was at Yale. They had either made jokes or treated him like he was a different person. One of the only people who hadn’t treated him any differently had been Michael. Whatever was going on between him and Cas made him the support Michael had given him when he was figuring out who he was.
“As always I thank you for your guidance Becky, I’ll let you get back to Samuel’s blazing loins.” Castiel said with a sigh as he rose out of his seat.
“I have nothing on today, I had the whole weekend free to spend time with Jack after he came back from camp.” Cas said.
"Are you fucking joking me? There is no 'us' Cas, you saw to that when you signed those divorce papers. What are you expecting? For us to become friends after this?"
“Wow, you’ve clearly spent this whole time maturing and forgiving your ex-husband.” Jo said sarcastically. Dean shot her a death-like glare he’d learned from his younger brother.
Dean would have rolled his eyes at Sam’s comment but his brother really did know him too well. A second text buzzed through moments later before Dean could even reply to the first.
“Winner!” Claire cried, racing over to Dean and Cas with a wide grin. Jack was seconds behind her, panting like crazy. “You owe me ice cream now.” Claire said joyfully to Jack.
“Come on Cas, please just be honest with me.” Jimmy implored. “Just tell me what is going on with you.”
"Meg do take care before you break the chair or yourself," Amy commented as she set about getting everyone a drink.
“Yeah, genius. I really mean that. I love you and I’m sorry that I fucked up so badly, especially ruining Lazarus Rising for you.”
“Winchester, sit your ass back down!” Vic called after him as Dean tore out the room, hot on Cas heels. “Cas! Cas, please just wait!” Dean called at the rapidly retreating figure of Cas.
, that book is gonna be like a five car pile up on the freeway. A mess that you just can't look away from." Dean said with an easy, lopsided grin. "What were you in for?"
“It’s ok…you might want to apologise to Adam before you drive the poor guy to an early grave though.” Dean said and when the room filled with Castiel’s laughter Dean felt lighter and he didn’t realise how much pressure had been in his chest since he’d walked away from Castiel.
“Yeah well I’m going out and I really didn’t feel like getting detention today.” Castiel said with a slight sigh. “Besides, I didn’t put my meds into my bag this morning so I need to take them.” Castiel added with another shrug of his shoulders as he began walking towards the kitchen. Gabriel quickly followed him.
“No, no because no one, not even you, is stupid enough to fall for their resident,” Ruby said fixing Dean with a cold look before she turned on her heels and marched away down the corridor leaving Dean completely alone. It wasn’t until Ruby had left that Dean realised he was shaking with rage.
“I don’t want anyone to die, I just want to watch a good surgery.” Adam shot back and Sarah just rolled her eyes as she pulled on her pink OBGYN scrubs.
“Mom, this is Anna Milton. She’s Cas’ younger sister and a student at the academy as well.” Dean said with a knowing look to Cas. He was taking all this in his stride.
“Yeah so…” Dean said trying, and failing, to defuse the situation. I guess you guys will want to pack up and get the hell out of here right now.” Zachariah could easily come back or, if luck really wasn't on their side, Raphael could send some of his lackeys down. Anna gave Dean a less than pleasant look before turning on her heels and getting into the driver’s side of the car.
“My birthday is May 18th. We have the same birthday. You have an Uncle Gabriel and I have an Uncle Sam. Claire, do you have a picture of your dad?” Jack asked.
Cas watched as Dean turned around and spotted Rachel and Hael, both of them practically floating down the hallway.
"What if he leaves me again?" Dean asked. Jimmy stopped. He didn't have an answer for that. "Exactly." Dean said.
“I wasn’t thinking of doing anything of the sort,” Cas said even though he was itching to send the video to Dean.
"The Vagina Patrol? She is gonna be pissed, man." Dean said once again smirking because Jo's face was going to be priceless when she found out.
They got into the elevator and as the door closed she flipped them both off. If Jo, or Charlie, had bothered to look closely they would have seen Dean take Cas’ hand as the doors to the elevator closed.
"Just go to sleep Dean. You'll need your strength for when Jo gets hold of you. Her greeting won't be half as friendly as mine." Cas said. It should have sounded like a joke but there was no humour in Cas’ voice at all.
“That’s Balthazar, he was my best friend at Harvard. He lives in England now, he’s a surgeon in London.” Castiel said.
"I'm just saying, Amelia said you two were close and you're staying at her house. You're the only one staying at her house." Cas said.
as he walked back into the control. Dean just stood there in shock. Ok, Cas was a guy with a lot of layers and Dean was pretty damn determined to discover those layers. Josie was going to kill him.
“I think it was the shit loads of alcohol and your tattoos that got me.” Dean said and Cas just rolled his eyes. “Still love you though.”
“Do…do you want to delete it?” Sam asked warily. Dean shook his head and hit the ‘Save’ button instead. He’d listen to the message again when Sam wasn’t there and try to work up the courage to ring Michael. “So…Michael’s been texting you?”
“Winchester, you’re with Bradbury in the ER with Lafitte.” He said. The monotone of his deep, resonating voice did nothing to give away his surprise but Dean had clearly stumped him with knowing what ARVC was. To be honest, Dean was even more stumped that he wasn’t being put on scut duty. “And Milligan is on charting seeing as he never actually finished yesterday during patient work up and rounds.” Novak added with a slight snap as he handed Adam a stack of folders much to Adam’s dismay. Without saying another word Novak motioned for Jo and Sarah to follow him as he took off down the hallway.
“These are mine…obviously you can’t sleep in your jeans and, well these are kind of tatty but they’re clean and…well I mean they’ll fit you and they’re clean so here.” Dean said handing over the cotton pyjamas which turned out to be a pair of soft sweatpants and a very old looking Smiths t-shirts.
"So let me get this right...” Charlie said the next afternoon as she, Dean and Sarah sat in the cafeteria.
"Cas!" A voice called from across the room causing Castiel to turn around and forget that he was talking to Luke. Both Dean and Sam were striding across the room until they were right in front of Castiel. Dean looked furious, really furious. "What the fuck happened? I got yanked out of auto shop by someone saying that Charlie had been in a fight or something like that and you were involved. Is she ok, what the fuck happened to her?” Dean asked as his voice rapidly raised until he was nearly shouting.
“Group date today. I’ll need to get moving soon as they’re sending the card and I’ll need to get some interviews done before you all go.” Dean said. “You’re going to a winery to do some wine tasting and grape crushing.”
and locks can easily be picked.” Dean shot back with a sharp look. Gabriel went to say something, no doubt dripping in ridicule, but Dean pointed a finger threateningly at him. “If you don't shut up I won't give you the password and you can the one to find out what happens to those who don't know it.” Dean added warningly. That shut Gabriel up instantly. “Anyone else have any comments they wanna get out the way? No? Then move your asses and get in the house.” Dean said commandingly.
"Hey, I've spent enough money on this wedding, it better not be a disaster Winchester." Amelia said pointing a finger at him threateningly. "You and Cas should just talk, and I mean really talk. Not yell at each other. Talk."
Several cups of coffee later and Castiel found himself sat in a board meeting he wasn’t really paying any attention to. If anything he was more interested in the view outside the window. Through the duration of the meeting, the sky outside had changed from one barely littered with clouds to one full of black rainclouds. The rain started only minutes later. Castiel watched as the rain steadily came down, soaking the streets down below.
“Yeah, something like that,” Dean said distractedly as he quickly got changed. He thought he was in the clear until-
“This is fucking bullshit.” Dean snapped. For the first time ever Dean saw actual concern on Tessa’s face. There was so much pity etched onto her skin that it made Dean feel sick.
"Oh, I was just looking around and I guess I took a wrong turn." Dean said glancing around the hallway. Jimmy's eyes followed him as he looked around and once again Dean found it strange how much Jimmy looked like Castiel and yet there were clear differences between them. Jimmy carried himself with more light, the pressure of running the Novak-Reeves empire not on weighing down his shoulders. “Hey, I’m sorry if I shouldn’t be up here.”
"Which part are you on?" Dean asked on a chilly night near the end of March. He was resting his head on Cas’ shoulder so he could read the page Cas was on. After much convincing, namely, because Cas really didn’t have a lot of downtime to read, Dean had convinced him to start the fantasy series he and Charlie were both obsessed with.
“A very nice remark towards the attendings about how capable you are in surgery which will come in very useful when they’re choosing the intern to solo assist on a surgery.”
“You make it sound like I shouldn't trust you.” Castiel said. “I probably shouldn't. I said that everything is telling me not to trust you but I do.”
“I watched you do an arch dissection so I was definitely questioning your ‘lack of compassion’.” Dean said with a grin.
"A mix of classic and Russian. Mainly Russian though thanks to Moscow. All my teachers in London were Russian trained as well," Dean said while Gabriel gave him an impressed look.
It was then that he realised the powers that had saved him would also be his uncontrollable downfall.
Google was a useful tool and it told him everything about the Novak-Reeves family that Sam hadn't mentioned. There was family history, history of the company and even an engagement announcement for James Nathaniel Novak-Reeves and Amelia Katherine Parker with a photo of the two of them smiling happily. There was countless articles on Castiel's father and his recent death and even articles about Naomi's humanitarian work. Castiel, on the other hand, was still a mystery. The only article about him was small, it was more of an announcement for him taking over the company after his father's death.
Dean gave him a brilliantly dazzling smile and moved closer to him. They were barely a hair’s breadth away from each other.
For a second Dean stiffened, like a soldier being reprimanded by his superior officer. Cas could tell that both Dean and John were uncomfortable. Especially John in his suit and about being in the David H. Koch hall. His eyes darted around the room as if he was searching for the exit.
“And what of your love life? Handsome boy like you must be batting those girls away with a stick.” Hester’s father said.
“Eat the last slice of pizza again and it’ll be a whole different story, Milligan,” Jo said warningly.
Michael’s mother changed the subject, slightly, to the talk of companies and universities. Everyone tried to get Balthazar to talk but he was staying quiet. Rachel’s mother talked non-stop about Rachel hoping to dance with Miami. Hester was holding out all her hope for American Ballet Theatre. Inias was trying to decide between going for a company or going to college. He had applied at NYU and a few other schools in case he didn’t get any offers from dance companies.
Next chapter will cover New Year's Eve, a bit of smut to warrant the new rating and scenes that will either have people cheering or have you guys wanting to throw stuff at me. Just a heads up!
“Ok stop, Cas you’ve proved your point.” Dean called. “Did you ever think that’s there is a reason why I keep saying ‘no’ when you ask me to marry you?”
Without even thinking Dean moved so he could take Castiel's hand in his own, holding onto it tightly. Castiel looked at him with surprise but didn't pull his hand away. He took another deep breath before speaking again.
This man, this irritating and stubborn man had been the love of his life, his husband and the man he wanted to spend this rest of his life with. Twelve years hadn’t changed a damn thing.
“Hey I was a political prisoner just like Castiel.” Dean said giving his mother a bright smile different from the smirk Castiel had seen him give others.
“Yeah sure” Castiel muttered under his breath before hurrying out the house and towards Anna’s car. Thankfully she was holding out a large paper cup of coffee which Castiel took without a second thought and took a very liberal gulp of its contents despite the scalding heat. He could feel his tongue begin to blister but he did not care; if anything the pain helped him feel human and alive for just a few fleeting seconds until the inevitable numbness would consume him again.
. Killing the thing that tortured me for months on end would not have messed up my conscience.” Castiel shot back. “You should have let me kill him.”
"Sorry pumpkin, it's true. If it makes you feel any better, Sam is pissed about it. He planning on making Ryan's life hell." Charlie said.
“Yeah, I mean they’re kinda cheesy but I still like them. Me and Sam have had this idea for a show where we just drive around the country and visit all the places featured in the books. Kind of like a documentary. The books are about two brothers you see, Sam and I would just drive around the country and try to find creepy stuff. I doubt anyone would want to watch two brothers sat in a classic car and listening to rock music. Still, it's want I want to do. Even if we do get canceled after a season. After filming finished last season we actually filmed a five minute fake promo for it. I've done some vision boards and shit for it. Hopefully one day Sam and I can get it off the ground."
“Dean I can’t do this right now.” Castiel snapped pulling away from Dean’s hold and beginning to walk down the hallway. He could hear his heartbeat pounding in his head as he sped up because he knew that he was wreaking his relationship by walking away but he couldn’t stop. Further down the line Dean might thank him for this even if it did hurt him.
“I’ve had two beers at the most.” Sam shot back almost smugly as he veered Dean towards the passenger side. He hated riding in the passenger seat; it reminded him too much of being dropped off at high school before his Dad had given him the impala as a sixteenth birthday present. “Plus this way I get to play my music for once.”
"Changed my mind, there is something really hot about you reading." Dean shot back as he placed the book on their shared bedside table and settled into Cas’ lap. “Hey.”
“Oh yeah, we’re old family friends," An open smile spread across Dean’s face. “Ellen and Bobby know my dad and we used to dance together when we were little," Dean said. “Man, I haven’t seen Jo for
“Nothing mother, nothing at all. I just wanted you to know how grateful I was for everything.” Castiel said.
“Oh…no, she had to head back to the school last night.” Anna lied smoothly. “I said Ruby could stay though.”
“I didn’t think you came up here. Jimmy told me you never did any of this anymore.” Dean said and Castiel actually scoffed. “What changed things?”
“Good, his plan would have been awful.” Sam said. “Look kids, I know damn well that Dean still loves Cas and judging from what you’ve told us, Cas probably still loves Dean. Just let them fight it out, turn whatever movie you’re watching way up and see how things are in the morning. I know these two idiots pretty well, you can’t force them into anything.”
"Yeah. I got your message, I'm sorry I haven't been in touch." Dean said once again wincing at his voice.
"Um...do you want breakfast or coffee?" Castiel asked as he couldn't tell Dean of the insane desire to draw him as that would have seemed strange. He also didn't want to mention that he was beginning to feel very aware that Dean was lying next to him and that he had spent the night with Castiel.
! He’s not going to die! He’s going to take the crown and become king!” Charlie said loudly, beer bottle in hand. “He’s the only decent character in the whole series!”
“Listen to Hannah, she’s smart.” Dean said. Hannah shot Dean a thankful smile as she walked back to her desk. “She’s right, you’ll be home soon and we’ve got the whole weekend together.” Dean added.
“I think he's starting to twig.” Charlie said. At first, Dean thought she was talking about Cas and the crush Dean was developing. That was until he saw that Charlie was looking at Ryan. “I think he's guessed that Sam is giving him all the shitty jobs. I heard he went to Crowley to complain last night.”
“Like…’together’ together?” Meg asked. Cas nodded. “Fucking hell Milton, you work fast. I fucking knew it. I knew that you would get into his tights.”
They made it to the main part of the mansion with time to spare. Josie raised an eyebrow at the fact that both Dean and Cas’ hair was wet but she didn't say anything. Frankly, Dean was amazed by her restraint. While Cas was being even a rundown of the plans for the day, Dean took several contestants aside for interviews. That took nearly an hour and by the time they were heading to the winery, Dean was dying for a coffee. He actually kissed Charlie on the head when she threw herself not the seat next to him with two large travel mugs of coffee.
“Why are you here?” Dean snapped. It felt wrong for Tessa to be on the Novak-Reeves property, she didn’t belong here and her presence just reminded Dean that maybe he didn’t belong either.
“Yeah that’s me.” Jo said proudly. Dean smirked slightly before he glanced over at Castiel. Castiel couldn’t help but smirk right back and he was oddly proud when he saw Dean’s face redden. Dean broke the eye contact first and started staring out the window to the playing field where the football team were beginning to practice. Castiel remembered sitting in the cold every Friday night during game season with his brothers watching his eldest brother Michael run up and down that field doing whatever the hell it was that football players actually did. Castiel had been highly relieved that neither Lucifer or Gabriel had been remotely interested in competitive sports so once Michael graduated Castiel wasn’t obligated to sit on a hard bench watching a sport he couldn’t care less about.
“I swear there is nothing in your cupboards apart from alcohol, bags of coffee and peanut M&M’s. I honestly wonder how you and Jo survive sometimes.” Cas said shaking his head.
Moments later Balthazar came walking over, Cas walking ever so slightly behind him. Dean’s stomach lurched when he saw Cas. He couldn’t even bother to fight the smile that spread across his face, though he tried to hide it with a beer bottle. When Cas saw Dean his own face broke out into a smile. Cas sat down next to Dean. Dean handed him a drink, hoping that he seemed casual. He saw Charlie’s eyes linger on them but she didn’t say anything.
"Joanna Beth!” a firm voice called making Jo jolt in her seat. “I don't pay you to sit around on your backside talking to customers and not doing any work." Ellen, Jo's mother called when she came waking into the coffee house.
Dean found Jo in the locker room with Charlie and Sarah. Once Dean had gotten over the amusing sight of Jo dressed in something that wasn’t scrubs or jeans he pulled her aside, rooting her to the spot with a serious look while Charlie and Sarah were given the ‘important’ task of finding the right shoes for Jo to wear.
"I would have killed you if it was just fucking but it isn't so I don't know what to do." Jimmy said. "Break his heart and I'll break your neck though."
“I like your apartment, I find it very cosy when it’s not full of drunken interns.” Cas said. “I don't have a spare bed to offer you, this is only a one bedroom apartment but my couch is far more comfortable than yours.”
"I'm here for Castiel Novak" someone said from the reception area. Castiel looked up in surprise because it wasn't his father, Gabriel or Michael; it was Luke of all people.
I knew how to do. My house is warded against every creature we know of and I didn’t even give him a chance to speak before I threw holy water in his face. It is him Gabriel, it
“I mean, he’s right. Uncle Sam talks about you all the time when I’m there. Not so much in front of dad ‘cause he gets real weird about it.” Claire said. “Jack said something about dad not wanting to see you so he wouldn’t do something stupid. He’s probably right, dad does stupid things all the time.”
"I guess that we could never be just friends Dean. We're... we're Dean and Cas. Two people who were meant to never be. Never meant to be just friends but clearly never meant to be more."
“Please never say that again.” Dean said while both Jimmy and Cas screwed up their faces in disgust.
“So just go ahead and tell me Sam.” Dean shot back with just as much anger. Yes he probably was taking his grief out on Sam but he was sick of messages from Raphael, he was sick of the whole damn war.
Several hours and even more coffees later Dean caught up with Jo and Sarah by one of the nurses' stations. It was the one by the good coffee machine so there was also a group of nurses or doctors taking their breaks there.
“Let’s just have a quiet night in. We only got back from Paris yesterday morning and jet lag is kicking my ass. Plus you know they’re going to actually kick our asses tomorrow. First day and all,” Cas said.
"She was found in a motel room," Cas said, hating how it felt as if history were repeating itself. "You've seen my mom's mother hen complex. She took Meg and Ruby in. The apartment that Meg stays in during the summer was her grandmother's, my parents bought it for her as a sixteenth birthday present,"
“GET OUT OF HERE CASTIEL!” Dean roared. His voice reverberated against every possible surface, his grace echoing through the words making them louder than could ever be possible for a human. Sharp and defiant blue eyes stared back at him for a moment before he saw a flicker dash through the irises. With a softening look Castiel lowered the gun he had never stopped aiming at Zachariah and backed out the room. Relief flooded Dean’s body for mere seconds before Zachariah chuckled sardonically.
“Nope. I mean it about the cheesy tattoos. You guys are better than that.” Jimmy said giving Dean one last hug before Dean got into the car. “Oh and make sure that Cas actually eats. Coffee and cigarettes are not a food group.”
“Dean I’m not worried about anything; it’s just going to take some getting used to. Moving away and not being here.”
“Pretty much everything, she didn’t want to but I pushed her to. She told me about what happened over the past few years...with the depression and stuff.” Dean said. Castiel could feel his breathing becoming shallower with every word Dean spoke until he was breathing in and out heavily trying desperately to not scream or punch Dean square in the jaw as hard as he could. “Don't get angry at Anna, I made her tell me."
"He’s at a conference in Florida, he's there for the next few days," Mary said while she set about making a pot of coffee. "What's wrong honey? I can tell that something isn't right with you." She said seriously.
“And how much time did you give him Dean?” Tessa asked narrowing her eyes with menace. In all the years he’d dealt with Tessa, Dean had never seen her this enrage. “How much time did you give him?”
“You see anyone else standing on the side of the road hoping for a ride?” Dean quipped with an easy grin. “Where are you heading to?” Dean asked as the guy’s face broke out into a smile full of gratitude.
“Yeah, everything’s fine. I just came in so I could finish off some charts I didn’t get round to yesterday.” Dean said.
"I didn't need you there!" Castiel retorted. "I didn't need you there but you pushed your way in anyway."
“Which is what I’ve been saying for years. Minus the nipple thing, no one needs to know that.” Cas said. “Can we stop talking about this now? You’ve gotten what you want, you’re going to the prom.”
“Hey Cas, once you’re done with the hugging, put Tweedledum on the phone.” Dean said loudly over the phone. Cas sighed and switched his phone over to loudspeaker.
“Sure Cas…it’s the only way I know you’re not going to run” Dean said kissing Castiel lightly on the lips before he closed his eyes.
“Are you offering your services there?” Adriel, said scoffing loudly. Dean whipped round to glare her harshly.
“God bless Amy Milton. Here’s hoping that next year is just as eventful.” Michael said. “Were you back home in Kansas with your family?” He then asked Dean. Dean nodded.
"I loved him two years ago and look where it got me. I can't have my heart shit all over by the same person."
“Castiel those dark circles under your eyes are getting worse.” Naomi said as soon as she walked into the large dining room later that morning. She stopped to place a kiss on Castiel’s head before doing the same to Jimmy. Many people might have thought that Naomi Novak-Reeves was a cold woman but that wasn’t true. Yes, she was sharp and brash at times but she still loved people with a fierce intensity and would do anything for her family.
“Yeah…well, I have a spare room that’s not being used ‘cause Sam is busy out in California so it’s going free…and well…I was wondering if you wanted to be my roommate,” Dean said. “I’m not asking you to ‘move in’ move in with me, I mean the spare room would be yours if you did move in but I’m a pretty private guy about stuff and I’d hate having some stranger in the spare room-”
"I...don't know what ya mean Sammy." Dean retorted, he and Cas swiftly walked out of the studio as his cheeks flamed crimson.
Castiel could barely breathe as Dean drove them back towards the estate. Dean had kissed him, Dean had closed the space between them and kissed him. Castiel never thought it would happen but now…now it changed things. It changed their relationship and their current situation.
“Fucking hell drop the bat it’s me, it’s Dean!” Dean said ducking out the way of the baseball ball currently swinging at his head. In the dim light, Dean could see the outline of a blonde woman only a few inches shorter than him, her curly hair pulled up into a bedraggled, loose knot.
“Mom had to work late and we’re just going to order pizza ‘cause Charlie doesn’t feel like pulling out the hazmat suits, you guys want any pizza?” Sam asked leaning on the doorframe as he glanced down at his cell phone.
“Sweet.” Tessa commented in a tone that made it clear she didn’t care. “I have a name for you.” She added.
Castiel fought against the urge to lash out, to yell that it wasn't his time or to even hit Dean. Instead, he sunk into the nearest chair and rested his head in his hands. This couldn't be happening, it just couldn't. He had so much to live for when he really thought about it. There was the company and the CEO position that would be his, his mother who would crash and burn without his presence and then there was his brother. Jimmy had been his best friend all his life and Castiel wanted nothing more than to see his brother happy. He would be married to Amelia by the end of the year and Castiel had dreamed of being there.
“Bring on the bad news Dr Model, I can take it like a pro,” Krissy said. Dean rolled his eyes and Krissy snorted despite her pain. “Ok, what’s the good news?”
It was the early hours of the morning when they got back to the academy. Ruby looked like an empty shell of a girl. Cas’ heart went out to her. She had no family now apart from Meg. If anything happened to her elder sister then Ruby would be alone. She tried to act so tough, but Cas knew that she was just scared that she would never live up to the dreams in her head.
” he muttered when he figured out what the scan telling them. “The heart muscle is weakened. She has cardiomyopathy and by the looks of it her heart is severely weakened to the point of complete failure.” Dean said as he looked over the scan with a sinking feeling in his stomach.
"Friends? Sort of, she's pretty cool." Dean said with a casual shrug. “You can’t help but becoming friends with the other interns in the end.”
"That’s bullshit Cas and you know it,” Dean said furiously. “You said it yourself that people want you for their surgeries. You're a fucking genius."
“You, whoever you are, don’t know shit.” Dean retorted. Tessa visibly bristled at his words. “Sorry but it’s true. I’m…I’m nineteen years old for fuck sake! I haven’t even lived yet…I’m not even old enough to drink! I can’t be…I can’t be dead.” Dean babbled. True he’d been using a fake ID since he was sixteen but that wasn’t the point. He was
He hadn’t come to the decision remotely lightly, especially after the other night at Dean’s and his conversation with Mary, but this was what Castiel did, when things got rough Castiel cut and ran. Sometimes he hated himself for it because he knew just how much he was hurting the people around him but he just couldn’t stop.
“It’s nice to finally meet you. I’m Jess.” She said while Sam went red. “You’re friends with Brady right?” She asked.
He had long since stopped praying to God, his time as a hunter had proven that there wasn’t anyone up there listening to the prayers of those on Earth. His faith in God had long since disappeared but praying had been such a constant in his life he found himself still doing so. He did not even know whom it was that he was praying to anymore but the familiar action gave him some of the only confront that was possible to find within the freezing wasteland ripping his soul apart.
her win? Dude, she pretty much kicked my ass without breaking a sweat and I was trying my damn hardest.”
“Yeah, it was really late by the time we finished watching stuff so I just offered Castiel the couch to sleep on.” Dean said casually.
a bastard and no one will miss him apart from maybe his assistant. You and that delectable but grumpy looking surgeon did the world a favour.”
not going back to that utter madness.” He said quickly. “Who are you?” Castiel asked when finally looked at Dean’s face. His photos really hadn’t done him justice. The guy was a handsome motherfucker with dark hair, tanned skin and the bluest eyes that Dean had ever seen. Even if he turned out to be the world’s biggest asshole the viewers would still love him.
“I know mom but I’ve gotta go, if I leave it any longer then it’s going to be so much worse,” Dean said pulling himself up off the couch. Mary quickly followed him as he hurried out of the living room. “I’m sorry for turning up and unloading all this baggage on you.”
“I found this photo of my dad’s together, scanned it, and put it on my phone so I’d always have it with me.” Jack explained as Claire looked down at the screen. There was her dad, smiling back at her with his arm slung around the shoulder of another man. The man Claire knew was her other father.
people do, inhuman cardio Gods are a different class of student altogether.” He said smirking as he nudged Cas playfully.
Despite his best efforts, Dean couldn’t stop himself from glancing over his shoulder and look over to where Cas was stood. A small smile crept across Dean’s face as he saw Cas’ completely oblivious expression when the barmaid started flirting with him.
“I don’t want to hear it Castiel, just go to the office.” Ms Mills pointing in the direction of the office with a furious look on her face.
“That’s for me to know and for you to not find out.” She said smugly before planting a kiss on Cas’ cheek. “Tell Amy and Richard that the food was fantastic and tell Hester she’s a fucking bitch. I’ll see you back at school.” She gave Ruby a smile then hurried out of the room. Cas watched warily as Meg left the room. A cold feeling of worry settled in his stomach but he tried to push it away.
He was awoken in the morning by the sound of a ward going off. Someone had stepped onto the property and that someone wasn’t human. Dean leapt from the chair he’d been sleeping in, thanking God in the process for making it impossible for angels to get cricks in their necks, and rush outside before anyone else could. He stopped suddenly when he saw who it was that had trespassed onto the property. “Zophiel?” he asked warily as he looked down at the angel there in the clearing in front of the cabin.
“I’m not leaving Sammy.” Dean said firmly. No matter what his father did he wouldn’t leave Sam. He wasn’t going to leave his brother with just his father who wouldn’t always be there. “I mean it Dad, I’m not leaving Sammy.” Dean said more firmly this time. John’s eyebrows knitted together as he took in Dean’s determined stance.
"Holy shit! They got back to you? What did they say?" Anna cried dragging Castiel into the house. “Please tell me it’s good news, what did they say?”
“Dean I mean it.” Bela said decisively. “We hugged once, that doesn’t mean we’re going to be besties and skip gayly through a meadow together. You’re still the prick who broke up with my friend.” Dean chewed his cheeks to stop himself from saying something incredibly mean.
"Would you?" Sarah asked with concern. Sure she and Dean had a friendship mainly based on their love for
, of course, I didn’t. You mean to tell me that Adam has liked me since we started here?” She asked. Dean, Sarah and Charlie all nodded their heads while Jo stared back in shock. “Fucking hell…and none of you thought to tell me this?”
“Fuck…Novak must be in a real shitty mood if you’d rather deal with exploding diarrhoea than him.” Dean muttered.
“I’ve seen you around campus and Brady’s mentioned you a few times. It’s crazy that it’s taken a wedding for us to final meet.” Jess said. She twirled her carefully curled blonde hair and gave Sam a dazzling smile. Dean had to hand it to her, the girl knew how to flirt and get what she wanted. Anna gave Dean a smirk as if to say that she had played a hand in whatever Jess was about to say. “When we’re back on campus… maybe we could go for a drink or something.” Sam looked thrown by that but nodded all the same. Come on Sammy, say something. Nodding just looks like you’re not really into it.
“Fine, as long as you go and get some proper sleep so I can give a glowing report to mom,” Sam said.
Sam gave him a classic bitch face and nodded for Dean to follow him out the room. Dean put his coffee down onto the table, earning a smack and a hissed ‘Coaster!’ from Jessica in the process, and followed his brother. Sam showed him to the spare room, not inhabited by a towel hoarding blonde like Dean’s had been until recently, and gave Dean a stern look.
Jimmy and Jo saw him off the next morning. Both stood in the driveway while Dean finished loading up his car. “You better look after my brother.” Jimmy said.
Dean snorted loudly while from the spare room they could hear Jo stomping around and occasionally complaining loudly about bread.
"I'll tell my baby that you think she's gorgeous." Dean said as they made their way back towards Dean's trailer. Cas stopped. Now it was Dean's turn to ask "What?"
“You wouldn’t dare break my heart like that,” Dean said giving Cas a smile before he even realised just how flirtatious the smile probably looked.
“No it’s just pure laziness. You find that the more money someone has the less work they put into the everyday things.” Castiel said as Dean started up the engine. The car purred into life and just being behind the wheel of a car again was soothing to Dean. It made him miss his baby that was back with Sam in South Dakota but he pushed that to the back of his mind, he was here in New York with Castiel and he had to remember that.
“No offence but you’re talking to a guy who can see and hear people’s souls, you don’t know complicated.” Dean said bluntly.
“Do you think he would…would he mind if I had a look?” Dean asked. “I remember Cas’ art from when I was in Boston and it was always good.” He elaborated.
“Well, then it’s a good thing you’re not on the ‘Vagina Squad’ anymore,” Cas said making Jo jump nearly a foot in the air. “Harvelle you’re in orthopaedic, Milligan you’re still in the ER on trauma and Blake you’re going to be taking Harvelle’s spot in OBGYN. Bradbury’s with paediatrics and Winchester you’re with me for the mechanical valve case. Does anyone have any complaints?”
“And you said yes? Wow…I’m amazed.” Anna laughed starting up the car and beginning to back out of the parking lot. “You’re developing people skills; it’s about time to be honest. Does this mean you’re going to stop hanging around with the likes of Meg Masters and her band of moronic minions?”
The apartment Cas owned was a twenty minute walk away from Dean’s own apartment. Despite the cold wind, neither of them noticed as they kept up a steady conversation as they walked. Charlie and Sarah’s karaoke prowess under the influence of Jo’s lethal cocktails was something of an amazement to both Dean and Castiel. Dean was in the middle of telling Cas the story of the time Sam got spectacularly drunk at a karaoke bar and rapped ‘Baby Got Back’ word perfectly when Castiel opened the door to his apartment and switched on the light. Dean stopped and his eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“Mary, I can promise you that I will always look after Dean,” Cas said, the truth in his words sparkling in his eyes. The two of them looked over at Dean, at the beautiful boy saying his goodbyes to his younger brother.
starts at nine.” Dean said, just hoping and praying that Cas would say yes. That he hadn’t ruined everything by going along with Michael Donner’s stupid plan.
“I should never have taken the money because I would have asked you out anyway. Cas, I’m so bad at saying the right thing but I’ve liked you from the moment I first walked into English class and you called Michael a dick for calling Sylvia Plath a boring bitch.” Dean babbled, knowing that he needed to get these words out before he screwed up again. “I like the way you say whatever is on your mind without caring what other people think. I like that not only have you
“Dean, I-” Castiel started to say before Dean was ripped out of his arms by a furious looking Michael.
Once they were both dressed Cas and Dean met up with Charlie and the others on the steps outside the academy. Charlie handed Dean his coffee. The noise that came out of his mouth was almost pornographic.
“Yeah, I am!” Dean snapped whirling around to face Cas. “I fucking pissed off but there’s nothing I can do about it because it’s exactly what I thought would happen!” Dean yelled, his voice filling up the apartment. “I
At lunch time they would eat in the art rooms as it was always less crowded than the cafeteria and didn’t smell like week old pizza; Dean would sometimes join them and seemed to form a friendship with Jo that was mainly based around friendly insults and eye rolling. After the night he’d spent sleeping on the Winchester’s couch Castiel started to see them as people he could possibly get close to if he ever allowed that to happen. Maybe that was part of the problem.
“Thank you for being so accepting mother and…” Castiel coughed as he felt a lump rise in his throat. “And thank you for everything.”
The touches alone were enough for Dean to slowly come undone, everything Cas seemed to do made him hypersensitive and alert. Deft hands roamed over his body, ghosting over his ribs, hips and digging into the strong muscles in his back. The knots of tension in Dean’s back were kneaded out by Cas’ skilled hands, the difference between the pressure against his lips in the pressure that Cas was applying to his muscles made Dean’s head reel. His breath was becoming more and more shallow as a loud blaring noise ripped through his small apartment.
“Chai what?” Charlie asked wrinkling her nose. “That just sounds weird, give me bitter as hell coffee any day of the week.” She added with a nod towards Dean’s own cup of coffee.
Dean had been always been so conscious to not look at the colour of his father’s soul but now he couldn’t focus on anything but the deep red thrumming under is father’s skin. He knew that John would have been sickened if he knew what Dean could see. That was the problem though, John no longer saw Dean as his son and Dean knew that. John probably only saw him as something to dear or push away.
As in the ballet world, Mary and Cas’ parents knew each other well enough to make small talk while John Winchester looked on, still looking bored and uncomfortable. At one point he reached for a glass of champagne. That was until Dean shot him down with a glare. John sighed loudly and asked the waiter to bring him a club soda.
“My sister will hang out with him, he’ll be fine,” Meg said. Dean did not look convinced. He had a reason to, Ruby was just as bad as Meg. “Dude, she’s
If Dean was being honest, he was reluctant to send Claire away for half the summer. The house would be far too quiet without her but, in the end, Sam was right. Sending her to summer camp would be good for her.
were inked against the tanned skin. Dean’s brain searched through his limited Latin and slowly smiled when the translation came to him.
“We better head to the hotel and let you go to sleep or you won’t get up in the morning for rounds!” she said. “Do you want us to give you a lift back to your apartment Castiel? It’s really no trouble for us,” she asked innocently.
“Honestly Castiel! To the party tonight!” Amelia laughed. Castiel grimaced. He wasn’t aware that he even needed to bring someone but now that he thought about it he should have known that Amelia, and probably his mother, would expect him to have a date. “You haven’t got a date, have you?” Amelia asked. Castiel shook his head. “What are we going to do with you Castiel?” Amelia added with another laugh.
Sam’s eye roll was definitely on the heavy side as he helped Dean plate up their food and grab two beers from the refrigerator. While Dean quickly cleared away some of the trash Sam carried their food and drinks into the living room.
“I’ve known a lot of suitors over the years. Editing can make an asshole look like an angel.” Dean said. That was the magic of TV. Most of the suitors on the show came across as the perfect gentleman to the American public. Behind the scenes was a different matter. Several had been roaring alcoholics, narcissists or utter man-whores. It seemed that Castiel was a rare find. “So, we ready to go?” Dean asked.
“That’s debatable Castiel, that’s very debatable.” Anna said while the made their way up to the house and pushed open the door.
"If only…” Gabriel said wistfully. “But no, Kali is back from New York for a week on a study break but she’s already done most of her work so we get to spend the whole week together." Gabriel said with a shrug of his shoulders. Well that would explain a lot. “Please go and see to the disgruntled teen though so I can get back to not being involved in your ultra-angst ridden soap opera of a life.” Gabriel said sighing dramatically.
“If I say ‘yes’ right now and even agree to staying for dinner if Charlie and your mom badger me enough about will you stop babbling?” Castiel asked and he really couldn’t believe that he was agreeing to this. Anna was going to have a fucking field day. Dean just nodded his damn head and gave Castiel such a smile it was actually ridiculous. Instantly Castiel wanted to back out but something stopped him, he really wasn’t sure what it was and it made him more nervous than the thought of being back at Dean’s house, maybe even in Dean’s room.
“Oh fucking hell, you have fucking so.” Josie said turning back to Dean with a very knowing look. “Ryan gave you a blowjob and then you had sex on the sound mixer. I know because I found the evidence and Ryan told half the camera crew.”
“He came into the coffee shop all the time.” Castiel elaborated. “He’s in the area for a few days so I invited him to spend some time here in the house. The party completely slipped my mind.” He was amazed he was even able to speak let alone come up with a, hopefully convincing, story as to why Dean was here.
"Yes but I want to do this first," Cas said, moving with grace so he could straddle Dean’s hip, Cas’ strong, naked thighs caging him in. “Hello Dean,” he said, his smile bright and beautiful.
Rehearsals had somehow become even more demanding in the weeks that followed. Cas and the others were spending nearly every hour of the day in studios and nearly everyone seemed to be at breaking point. When they weren’t dancing, Dean and Bela could be heard screaming at each other. Bela would call him an uncoordinated moron in French while Dean’s chosen insults in Russian were much more colourful. During one particularly bad fight, Bela had to be held back by Michael and Cas while Charlie and Jo had to practically drag Dean away before he throttled Bela. Meg, meanwhile, just sat on the floor watching the whole fight while drinking a cup of green tea without a care in the world.
He stretched out his legs, ending up with them perfectly parallel to one another. Dean smirked at him as he too began to stretch, the two turned it into a competition to see who could stretch the furthest. Dean finally collapsed with a laugh when Cas' whole upper body was pressed against the floor, his legs still spread outwards in perfect parallel.
“Yeah save that you Jo stud muffin.” He retorted while they finished scrubbing in. All jokes aside Adam had helped in distracting him but he was still about to go into his first surgery and it was safe to say he was scared out of his damn mind.
“Having known her since she was little, I have to agree with your brother here.” Castiel said. Dean groaned and prayed that if Anna did shoot then it wouldn't be anywhere important like his heart or crotch. Sam, the traitor, gave Castiel an approving smirk which Dean would get back him for later. Sam looked between Castiel and Dean with a shrug then disappeared with a ripple of grace through the air. The look made Dean glanced over to Castiel and he realised the man had shot Sam a friendly but dismissive look. Dean’s eyebrow cocked questioningly. “Why didn’t you let me kill Zachariah back then? Why did you want me to leave?” Castiel asked.
"God you're up early!" A voice called out, causing Dean to jump nearly a foot in the air. He spun around and saw Charlie hurrying up to them. "What are you doing out here?"
Dean was grateful for Cas’ composure, it helped ground him and remind him he was here because he was a surgeon. He was a surgeon and he needed to do his job. Charlie, who was on paediatric rotation for the week, looked away from the crash team towards Castiel with a fearful look on her face.
“Where the hell have you been? You should have been here thirty minutes ago!” Anna yelled. Dean rolled his eyes at Cas. “Don’t you roll your eyes Dean Winchester! You need to be in your suit because Amelia will be here in an hour!” Anna added with a snap.
. He was ringing Benny, Adam and me nonstop as soon as you left and when none of us could tell him where you were I thought he was going to go insane. He was all but set on just driving all over the state until he found you and dragged you home once you’d gotten over whatever the fuck was the matter with you.”
Both Cas and Dean weren’t too surprised to find Meg and the others waiting for them in the common room when they got back to the academy. Meg was lounging in a nearby chair and scrolling on her phone while Ruby lay at her feet, her fingers flying across her phone as she texted. Anna, who was sitting next to Ruby, was the first one to notice them walking into the room. She hastily nudged Bela, who quickly fished out her phone and texted someone as she rose out of her seat. Moments later Charlie and Jo hurried into the room, Charlie flying at Dean and hugging him tightly.
The evening started as a surreal blur when Dean arrived at the Milton household. Opening the door, Cas stood there in complete shock as he took in the sight of Dean wearing a tux. Cas had never seen Dean wearing anything but his trademark flannel shirts, battered boots and worn leather jacket. To see him wearing a goddamn tux was a surreal experience.
"I would say that I never knew you smoked but then again I don't know much about you." Castiel lamented sadly because, truly, he was sad that he didn't know Dean better.
Slowly Cas began to undress him, one item of clothing at a time and Dean did the same. Once again all the urgency from that morning had disappeared. Maybe Cas was just as scared as Dean. With careful steps, Cas slowly backed Dean up against the bed. All the while his eyes constantly asking questions. Is this ok? Is this what you want? Are you scared I'll leave again? Do you still love me?
“Yeah but I need to finish off some charting and paperwork, it won’t take me very long. I’ll be back soon and then you’re gonna tell me all about this girl you’ve got a big ol’ crush on.” Dean said as he grabbed his jacket and car keys.
“No Cas, that’s the one thing I really don’t give a shit about. My brother and my parents have known that I’m bisexual since I was in medical school. Jo and that lot know as well and I really don’t give a shit what other people think.” Dean said firmly because it was true, he didn’t care what people thought about him dating a guy. “Cas I mean it, I’m not ashamed of us and I never will be.” He said resting his forehead against Cas’. “I just don’t want everyone to think we’re something we’re not. I just want us to be us. That’s if you want there to be an ‘us’.”
"Dean bedroom." Cas gasped out while Dean kissed a firm line up the other man's jaw. "I'm not having sex with you on the couch like some horny teenager." He added making it clear there was no other way this night could continue and that they'd been building up to this for a long time.
“Can’t handle two nights running?” Dean joked. Once again Cas rolled his eyes and this seemed to be becoming a regular thing between them now.
That was until the room filled with the sound of Cas' phone buzzing on their bedside table, the screen lighting up as it vibrated across the surface. Cas tried to ignore it, turning his full attention back to Dean's skilled mouth, but as soon as the call ended the phone started to buzz again. Dean let out a frustrated groan as the phone began to buzz for the third time.
“Awesome.” Dean said acerbically looking down at the glass in his hand. “What did the winged dictator have to say for himself? Was it a rousing sermon in order to rally the troops?” The acid tone of his voice cut through the room and judging by Sam’s disgruntled frown he did not appreciate it.
“I smelt pancakes.” Dean said between a loud yawn. He stretched out his arms as he walked over to Claire, giving her a high five before ruffling Jack’s hair.
“Of course! It’s not a Milton family meal without the freeloaders,” Meg quipped. Amy rolled her eyes but still smiled at Meg.
“Yeah…he’ll probably scrub out in a minute,” Dean said. There was a large chance that Benny was going to take this as hard as Cas had taken Mr Talbot’s death. “I’ll…I’ll go and find him.”
Just like every single morning at Lawrence, Meg was waiting for Cas after his run. She was waiting outside for him as he hurried down the steps. His hair was still wet from his shower and he swiftly regretted it when the wind picked up. He was glad for the hoodie he had thrown back on after his shower.
“Ok, I’m pissed because it just feels like you two are going a million miles per hour but… but… you clearly care about him.”
“Yeah, according to Sam you guys do not possess that ability,” Meg said. "Oh, and you owe me by the way."
“We spoke to Balthazar earlier on," Richard said. “Obviously we’ll have to talk to Meg about it once she’s well enough but she has a few options. She can either drop out of the academy-”
"Yeah well, Amelia is staying at my mom's with Jess and the other bridesmaids. Jimmy is here so it made sense."
“I’m guessing that was your brother. He’s the reason you’re doing all this right?” Tessa questioned.
“No, when I went to the train station to pick up Jack I didn’t expect to see my twelve year old daughter.” Cas said. “You don’t have to apologise, I’ve enjoyed having Claire here.”
"Oh they are loving Amelia." Charlie said as she scrolled through Twitter. "They're already calling her for Final Two."
“What did you study?” Dean asked intrigued. Honestly there was something incredibly intriguing about Castiel and Dean found himself wanting to know more about the guy.
“Having a TV with better reception,” Krissy said with a grin. Damn this kid was gonna be the end of Dean if he wasn’t careful.
“Please Daphne. You’ve sent me home to my family so I want to help you in any way I can.” Castiel said. Daphne sighed but reached behind her to pull a handbag onto her lap. She pulled out a small notebook and pen to write down her mother’s address.
“Honestly it’s fine. I need to drive through Essex anyway and you said you were desperate to get home. And…well you know, good deeds and all. Maybe this will make up for all the music I’ve downloaded illegally over the years and I’ll end up going to Heaven.” The woman said with a chuckle. Castiel could feel himself flinch but the woman seemed too attentive towards her coffee to notice. “I’m Daphne by the way.” The woman said looking over at Castiel again.
"Can't wait to see you." Dean said, even though he knew that it was cheesy. He really did miss Cas when he wasn't around.
“And by speaking I mean having an actual conversation, not just shouting at him and probably swearing.” Mary said in a very knowing way. Mary knew her son far too well.
“You can say it Adam.” Sam said from his seat. He reached out for the steaming mug Anna had just placed in front of him. “Thank you Anna.” He said. He took a sip of the hot liquid before speaking again. “Now that Haniel and Zaphkiel are dead the remaining members of The Seven are Camael, Raphael, Michael and me.” Sam’s voice sounded laboured, as if the truth about Haniel and Zaphkiel was finally sinking in. Maybe tea didn’t make the world a better place. “I might not have any say or power up there anymore but I am still part of The Seven.” He added almost bitterly.
“Hey come here, it’s gonna be ok.” Dean said walking over to Bela and hugging her tightly. When they were back at Yale the notion of hugging Bela would have made Dean laugh until his sides split but he knew when someone needed comfort.
"Shut up Winchester, you're the golden boy around here," Cas said as he slowly stood up. "You set the track up and I'll grab the swords."
"Castiel?" Anna's concerned voice filtered down to Castiel's brain. Looking upwards he saw worry etched onto Anna's face. "Christ, are you ok? How much have you had to drink?" Anna asked. Castiel tried to shake his head to show her he was fine but Anna held up her hand to stop him before he could do anything. "Don't even try that with me Novak. Come on, I'm taking you back to my house. You can sleep this off until Gabriel and your dad have come back home." Anna said pulling Castiel up into a standing position despite the fact that Castiel was easily several inches taller than her and had several pounds on her. Anna was a scrappy fighter when younger though and she spent some of her spare time with Jo when she wasn't with Castiel so it was a given that she was stronger than she look.
“First of all, fuck you, Winchester. Second of all, it’s the super-secret club inside the band of misfits. Welcome to Dead Parent Club. We have cool jackets and prescription pills if you need them.” Meg said casually. For what felt like the millionth time in his life, Cas winced at Meg’s bluntness.
“Thanks, Dean, thanks for that,” Sam said completely deadpan. “There’s this party at one of my friend’s places next week…I was thinking of asking her to go with me.”
“Oh, of course, Dean, you can use my shower. Thank you for asking me before you take your clothes off.” Cas said sarcastically.
"You really think of everything don't you?" Cas said. For a moment Dean thought he was being sarcastic until he saw the somewhat impressed look on Cas' face.
I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has read this! It started out as a small idea and I honestly didn't think anyone would read it, let alone enjoy it.
“Yeah, try and get Cas to help us as well. He asks the really obscure questions you just know are going to be on the test to fuck with our brains.” Jo said as she pulled herself out of Adam’s hold for long enough to give Dean a quick hug. The others made their goodbyes and all agreed on the lunchtime study session before Dean hurried out of Jo and Charlie’s apartment.
“Andy Gallagher, an eighteen-year-old freshman at the University of Chicago. He was out with his friends when he was shot by an unknown passer-by.” One of the paramedics called out. Dean felt his stomach roll as he looked down at the sedated form of Andy Gallagher.
“Yeah and the till will be down like fifty bucks compared to every other night. Face it, Jo and I keep this place running.” Dean said giving the bartender a cocky grin. “So can I get two Coronas?” he added. The bartender rolled his eyes but handed over two bottles of beer. Dean handed over a couple of notes, grabbed the beers and walked back to the booth were Castiel was was sat.
“What?” Dean breathed out heavily as he whipped his head around to stare at Castiel, hysteria darkening his green eyes. “What did you say?” he asked with a demanding tone to his voice.
“I want us to be friends but not if that means that I have to put up with shit like you being a decent guy one second then an asshole the next.”
Clearly, Cas’ distraction method was to ask Dean as many questions as he could. It would probably work but Dean would have preferred Cas flirting with him even if that would never happen.
Dean had walked in on plenty weird sights in his life; roommates in college having kinky sex, his mom waxing her eyebrows and even Sam doing sunrise yoga to Celine Dion but none of those compared to walking in on Jo Harvelle crying her eyes out in the middle of the intern’s locker room before rounds. Sure Dean had only known her for the best part of a month and a half but he’d never seen her cry in that time. She always seemed so…well she always seemed too much of a badass to weep over something. Seeing her sat in the intern’s locker room wailing loudly while Sarah and Charlie pressed cookies and cups of hot chocolate into her hands was certainly a real sight.
," Sam said matter of factly. Dean spluttered, his red blushing a deep red while Cas felt his own cheeks flaming.
"That's why I'm asking you isn't it? What’s wrong?" Dean pointed out. Castiel sighed and contemplated lying to Dean but he was tired and he needed to let out his anger before it twisted itself into something nasty. Besides he couldn't talk to Anna, it was too late, and Dean was right there.
"Um yeah...I have two other brothers. Luke is permanently single and I think Michael is secretly in love with my friend Anna's eldest sister Naomi." Castiel explained to Charlie. Charlie let out a small smile and Castiel caught Dean’s expression change from that of confusion to a bemused look.
"He could have been on a date with Lisa Braden but instead he wanted to spend the evening with you despite your less than sunny personality so what does that say?"
“We’re not doing anything.” Cas lied as he grinned wickedly at Dean. Damn, Cas really was going to be the death of him.
“Well, the whole gang and I will be picking you up from the airport before you know it.” Dean said, his whole face lighting up when he smiled at Cas. “I better go and make sure Claire isn’t doing something like setting the kitchen on fire out of boredom. I love you Cas, can’t wait to see you.”
Dean was set with a cover story, one he had perfected with John while they travelled into Cambridge, but that was until he came face to face with a pair of inquisitive blue eyes partially hidden by thick-framed glasses. The man, who looked no older than twenty, stared unabashedly up at Dean with the smallest of frowns on his face.
“I get to say goodbye to Gabriel.” Castiel said sternly. “He will never forgive me for this if I don’t talk to him before.”
“No choreography, just...dancing?” Cas questioned. When Dean danced it was as if the world melted away. Maybe all the thoughts running through Dean's head would melt away too.
“I honestly don’t know whether to be proud of them or question our parenting skills.” Dean said as Cas led him not to the guest where they had slept the night before but to Cas’ room. He smiled to himself as he walked into the room. It was just so
“It's not my garrison. Not really. I was Michael's general and when he left he gave me control of the garrison.”
"Shit...did I do something wrong?" Dean asked as his brow furrowed. "Cas I'm sorry, I knew I shouldn't have done that.” Dean muttered shaking his head furiously. “I'd been thinking about it but I should have never done it. It's not-" Dean started to babble and Castiel could see in Dean’s eyes that he was rapidly becoming nervous of the situation and that was all because he thought that he’d been wrong to do the one thing Castiel had been desperate to do since Meg’s party.
Castiel sat for a long while sipping on his tea and pulling bits of his sandwich off to pop into his mouth. Once he was halfway through his first sandwich Castiel heard someone coming into the kitchen. He glanced over his shoulder, hoping that it wasn’t his mother, and felt relieved when he saw his twin brother Jimmy settling down in a seat opposite him.
"She never wanted to be her mother. You have to understand that. Her injury last year drove her to this. Her painkillers weren't strong enough to numb the pain. She needed the pain to be numbed so she could dance," Cas said frantically because he needed Dean to understand. "She wouldn't have done this if she hadn't been injured,"
“What?” Charlie snapped defensively. “The last time someone told me they were proud of me, I was like twelve years old!” she explained as she wiped her eyes furiously. Jo snorted and pulled Charlie into a one-armed hug as they trudged into the conference room where the exam would be taking place.
“They’re with the doctors, when they know something they’ll come and tell us," Cas said with a tired sigh.
With a gentleness Dean wasn’t expecting Cas ran his fingers down Dean’s side and gripped onto his hips, locking Dean in an intense gaze that sent jolts of electricity through Dean’s whole body.
"Hey." A small blonde said with a smile as Dean settled next to her to get the last remaining locker. "You’re Dean right?" She asked as she tied her long hair up into a ponytail.
. He was my partner, we worked well together. Having a good pas partner is like having a good tennis partner. You can’t win Wimbledon with a shit partner.”
and not just you.” Charlie retorted. Dean pushed a bit of muffin towards her with a pleading look. “Oh fine! But you didn’t hear it from me.” Charlie said rolling her eyes as she grabbed the piece of muffin. “You know they went out again after that disastrous first date. After your surgery, Adam came back to mine and Jo’s for drinks. They’ve gotten closer over the past few days, especially with Jo freaking out over you vanishing. Don’t give either of them shit over it though, it’s surprisingly cute even if you can tell Adam’s terrified she will kill him if he hurts her.” Charlie explained between mouthfuls of muffin.
“Well, after the summer I’m going to be so busy with grad school and you and Jimmy are just getting off the ground with work. We’ll be so bogged down by work that we’ll end up being engaged for about five years and neither of us wants that.” Amelia explained.
…yeah probably.” Dean groaned. “Shit…I’ve got to go…tell Krissy…just reassure her will you?” he asked Charlie. “She’s probably gonna be pretty freaked out by all this plus she’s not gonna get her pudding.”
He glanced over to where Cas was leant against the coffee table, that small crease that appeared between his eyebrows when he was concentrating was incredibly noticeable and Dean couldn’t help the fond smile that spread across his face.
"No it wasn’t anything like that, we were both at med school together so we were both under the same amount of exam stress and shit like that." Dean said.
“See you soon, I’ll try to answer my phone more often,” Dean promised as they stopped near the main doorway.
They knew of several company members who had tried to seduce Balthazar in order to get into the company. Only a few had succeeded.
“Sorry to come over like this but I kind of need to talk to you. I wasn't sure if-" Sam stopped when he spotted Cas on the couch, the two half-empty glasses on the coffee table and the paused film on the TV. "Did I interrupt something?"
“You’re going back to Chicago now? Dean you’ll have to drive through the night and you’ve hardly slept at all.” Mary said.
"If you're planning on sneaking out then you should know that the third step from the bottom creaks really loudly and next door’s dog is a barker." A voice muttered sending waves of shock through Castiel's body. He whirled round in the dark and sighed with slight relief when he saw that it was only Charlie standing in her doorway, the faint glow from a laptop inside her room being the only source of light until, with a tut, Charlie turned on a nearby lamp filling the hallway with a soft orangey red light. Charlie folded her arms across what looked like Harry Potter themed pyjamas and gave Castiel a raised eyebrow.
"My relationship to him?" Dean asked. There was no way around this but Dean couldn't just blurt out that he'd been sleeping with Cas and was quite possibly in love with him if he didn't know what Cas had said. "What exactly did Dr Novak say?" Dean then asked. Crowley's jaw clenched at Dean's question.
who are cursed with being tagged in so much of my writing. I also owe this fic for letting me get to know Abby, Naimh and Caitlin who are all amazing and Caitlin is now also cursed with having me send her random photos of animals and videos of me talking about insane crap but she loves it really.
“Good morning angel,” Meg said, her face hidden by a large pair of sunglasses. “I come with caffeine and gossip from the office,” She said, her grin wide and devilish. “The
week Dean would no longer have to hear about the fucking wedding. If he heard the word ‘wedding’ anymore he was sure he would break out in hives. Jimmy had basically turned into a woman over the past few weeks. Dean barely recognised his best friend anymore. Part of him wondered if he was anything like that after his wedding. No, he couldn’t think about that. That was dangerous territory. He couldn’t allow himself to think about anything to do with Castiel.
“Well thank you, it’s nice to know that you like my company more than a bunch of hipsters.” Charlie said smirking. “While I can’t tell you who is ‘in’ and ‘hip’ I could easily tell everything you’ve never wanted to know about Harry Potter.”
"I might take you up on that offer," she said. Inais, Anna and Ruby just stared at the two of them, all wearing confused expressions.
"I wasn't joking earlier. I thought about you all day. All throughout today, I kept replaying the moments between us." Cas said, between words he peppered Dean's jaw with kisses.
"Calling it an early night or just off to see lover boy?" Ryan asked. "If you think you're being subtle you're not."
"I'm an angel. You know; wings, celestial powers…we’re sometimes seen a pieces of toast...an angel."
“What the hell Red?” Dean snapped rubbing his neck as if he were in pain. “I know this is a shitty car but even a monkey could drive it.”
Dean was hot on his heels as their waiter yelled out after them. Laughter spilled from Dean’s mouth as he raced after Cas, his feet pounding against the sidewalk as they both ran down the street. Finally when they were a fair distance away from the restaurant Cas slowed down and rested his hands on his knees, as Dean caught up with him Cas grabbed his arm and pulled him in for a hot, wet kiss. Dean opened his mouth to let Cas’ tongue in and he was completely lost. God, he fucking loved this man.
"Good otherwise I would seriously have to reconsider our friendship. There’s nothing remotely good about tofu sausages. Even if you attempt to deep fry the fuck out of them." Dean said and it was too early for Castiel to correct Dean by telling him that they weren’t really friends. “Did you sleep ok? The couch isn’t the comfiest but Charlie’s fallen asleep on it enough times after Doctor Who marathons and she’s still got full use of her neck and back so it’s not too bad.”
All the while Dean could see that Castiel was nervous and really didn’t want to be there. Once all the girls had made their introductions Gabriel swooped in to announce that the cocktail party would start straight away.
“That depends on who you are.” The man said returning to look at Dean. “You’re not a reporter are you?” the word ‘reporter’ was said with so much disdain it was as if the word was poison.
“I’m guessing you can’t sleep.” Dean said. Castiel shrugged his shoulders with a tired smile on his face.
"Oh nut up Winchester and sit down. Khan is about to launch into his maniacal and evil plan." Charlie said. Dean sighed but sat down on the couch but not before grabbing the bowl of popcorn from out of Charlie’s hands. Charlie gave a sound of disbelief before pouting until Dean threw a handful of popcorn at her head. Several piece of popcorn ended up falling onto Castiel. Dean shot Castiel an apologetic look but instead of saying anything Castiel threw one of the pieces of popcorn into his mouth. “If you cry try to keep it quiet.” Charlie shot at Dean with a smirk and once again Dean threw several handfuls of popcorn at Charlie. “Mom! Dean’s throwing popcorn!” Charlie yelled in the direction of the kitchen.
A sinking feeling settled in Castiel’s stomach as he looked around the room. Amelia caught his eye and Castiel watched as her face broke out into a huge smile. Jimmy must have told her about the news. Castiel slowly made his way over and wasn’t surprised when Amelia pulled him into a hug.
"No...ok maybe I did but the dick had it coming Sammy." Dean said. Cue bitchy look number two. "He was being an asshole! He spent the whole shift calling me Budweiser." Dean said trying to justify himself. Sam snorted loudly because he was that much of a little shit. "Oh shut up bitch."
“Trust her to go completely overboard.” Castiel intoned as he looked around the room. The ballroom of the Novak-Reeves was one of those rooms that Castiel always viewed as completely unnecessary despite what both his parents told him when he was growing up. The room mainly housed memories of parties thrown by his parents that Castiel had reluctantly gone to. When they were younger he and Jimmy would steal a tray of desserts and escape as quickly as they could without their parents noticing.
“What does the ass hat want?” he asked. Ok yeah, it was unprofessional calling his boss an ass hat in front of a patient but from Ben’s smirk, it seemed to cheer the kid up. Jo motioned for him to follow her so that Ben couldn’t hear. Shit, if it was bad news about Ben’s mom then this was going to be a real bitch. Dean followed Jo until Ben was out of hearing range. “What’s wrong?”
“So…you knew the girl who died?” Dean asked figuring that it was best to get to the point. He wanted to prove to his father that he could do this job and do it well.
Anna’s backyard was full of people and Dean was sure he was in hell. Everyone was milling around chatting to one another or picking small canapes off the trays various waiters kept offering. Dean had only been there for thirty minutes and he was already totally done. As if by magic Anna appeared at his side with a glass of something in her hand. She handed Dean the drink.
“You have a bedroom upstairs that’s empty and no one will notice if we disappear for an hour.” Cas said. Dean’s stomach flipped. He hadn’t been with Cas for two years. The thought of being with him again made him both nervous and excited.
“Dude I’m a fan of dick, I don’t really look at girls like that anymore.” Dean said bluntly. He didn’t miss Cas’ smug expression at that comment. “But yeah, I think it is that Jess Moore. I’m guessing that you know her.”
"Turns out you taught her the Russian word for 'whore' and I only found that out after I called her one," Dean grinned over at Cas.
"I don't know what you said to Collins today but it worked Dean. That kiss between him and Ruby was kind of hot." Balthazar said giving Dean a clap on the back.
“What has been known to happen every now and then?” Cas asked as he placed the drinks on the table and slid back into the booth.
He took Cas’ own face in his hands and brought their lips together, feeling a complex rush as their lips moulded together. “Look, I care about what people say and think but I also really like you and at the end of the day liking you is more important than what people think.” He said once they had broken apart.
Cas scrolled through one of his dance playlists and finally settled on a song. The slow melody began as he and Dean walked into the centre of the room, gently warming up their muscles. As the lyrics began, the two moved around the space with no real plan of movements, they just let their bodies take over. It was dancing at its most pure form. Cas always adored watching Dean dance and how his face took on a look of serenity with every move or position. He watched in awe as Dean just moved, no plan or restrictions holding him back.
"Read it and weep my dancing minions," Balthazar said while his assistant pinned the paper up to the notice board.
“I have to Cas and I’m so sorry.” Dean said moving out of Castiel’s reach. “I…I wanted you to know that I feel the same way…in your letter…I feel the same. I needed you to know that.” Dean stammered out.
“The younger Winchester?” Bela asked. “I remember seeing him a few times in London. Has he grown into his hair yet?”
?” Bela asked, appearing at Dean’s side with a bottle of wine in her hand. One eyebrow was perfectly cocked upwards.
“Have you brushed your teeth?” Anna asked without even looking up from her phone. She was frantically tapping away and it was no doubt about wedding business. “Expect a text from-” Anna started to say before Dean’s phone buzzed loudly. Jo.
“Just because you cried like a child for an hour and forty minutes after watching this doesn’t mean that Castiel will. He’s probably a lot more emotionally stable than you when it comes to this stuff.” Charlie said smiling widely when she saw Dean’s face redden. “So…were you out with Benny and Victor?” Charlie asked mentioning two of the football players who Castiel had spoken to maybe three times in his life and those times were only ever after track events.
“Because I don’t hate you," Cas replied. “And I know for a fact that Jo would have kicked your ass already if you were a bad person," He added, just in case Dean was getting any ideas about feelings Cas might have for him.
“Yes, why is that so surprising? I think you’re the most wonderful person I’ve ever met.” Cas said sincerely.
"I said I wouldn't come without caffeine." Dean said with a shrug of his shoulders. He knew he would have to see Cas multiple times this week so he was going to act civil. Even if it killed him.
“All I’m saying…” Amelia said when they were a few minutes away from the Novak-Reeves building. “Is that you’re turning thirty next year and, as far as I can see, you haven’t really lived since you came back from Boston.”
Her cheeks were stained with tears and her nose was bright red from crying. Dean pulled her into a hug and let Charlie rest her head on his shoulder.
Luke’s door was open as Castiel walked past and loud music, Led Zeppelin, poured out into the hallway. Castiel stopped and knocked on the door loudly so Luke could hear him. The grunt from inside didn’t sound like ‘Fuck off’ so Castiel walked into the room to find Luke sat on his bed staring up at the ceiling. Luke didn’t look over to where Castiel was standing until he let out a small cough.
Dean shot back a congratulatory text message before shoving his phone back into his pocket as he walked into the cafeteria. He grabbed a pudding cup, stole a handful of Charlie’s fries and was about to take his ass back to Krissy’s room when he heard someone yell his name. Dean whirled around and spotted Cas almost barrelling through the door.
“Oh Dean it’s you!” Amelia said as she clutched at her chest dramatically. “I hate being in the house by myself, it’s too big and my brain always goes overboard. Cas isn’t here, he’s gone into the city for a few hours.”
Dean.” Hester piped up. “Especially Castiel.” Several people, namely Cas, Bela, Michael and Meg, glared at Hester over that comment.
"They've just left the castle,” Cas replied in a distracted tone, most of his focus being on the book in his hands. If he didn't react properly at the right parts he knew that Dean and Charlie would never let him live it down.
Claire could stick her tongue out all she wanted but there were still scorch marks in their kitchen.
"He was the one who gave you those nicknames, no prompting from me at all," Krissy said feigning innocence.
“Thanks Amy.” Castiel said. Amy Milton, unlike her husband, actually adored Castiel so maybe Charlie had a point when she said that mothers seemed to like Castiel. Amy had always been nothing but lovely towards Castiel so he was actually pretty pleased that she seemed so happy for him. "Yeah...Anna do you care to tell me how they came to think I applied to their school?” Castiel asked looking from Amy back to Anna who went bright red. Rachel snorted loudly and shook her head.
Gabriel shrugged as someone called out his name. Both Gabriel and Sam spun around, Sam instantly feeling his face grow hot when he saw Jessica Milton gracefully walking over.
“Have you got any idea what this is about?” Jo asked as she surveyed the room, glancing at the nervous look on nearly every intern’s face. Dean shook his head by way of reply and Jo snorted. “You’d think Novak would tell you.” She said.
“It’s fine, I understand perfectly,” Michael said, his accent only slightly clipped from the months spent in London. London, it seemed, was clearly working in Michael’s favour Dean assessed as he looked over his friend and ex-partner. His hair was longer than was at Yale, giving him a more European look that probably made the nurses back in London weak at the knees. “It’s really good to see you, Dean, I’ve missed you,” Michael added.
“Hey, Winchester! Milton! Hold up a moment” Gabriel called for across the studio. Within moments he was at their side. “You two did good today, I’m really impressed. I’ll let Balthazar know how you’re getting on. He’s keen to know everything about the senior class this year,"
“Did Jo get drunk and call him a ‘fucktruck’?” Dean asked, a smile spreading across his face from the memory of the last time Jo drank too much and went on a long rant about her ex-boyfriend. The words ‘fucktruck’, ‘fuckwit’ and ‘useless paperclip’ were used several times that night.
"You didn't do anything wrong Dean. It's me, it's all me” Castiel said. “It’s always me." He added bitterly. "I shouldn't...I shouldn't have responded when you kissed me...I shouldn't...it wasn't right because I can't do this, I can't be
“I just cannot understand why you’re acting like such a dick especially when I thought that we were friends but clearly you’re just some asshole who-”
“You caught me. I like knowing shit ‘bout people, you can’t blame a girl for that.” Jo said shrugging. “Plus we’re friends you listened to me rant away about my shitty ex without complaining.” Jo calling them friends threw Dean for a loop. They were friends, heck they worked together for about a hundred hours a week and that would make anyone friends with someone in the end. Dean could probably do with talking to a friend about this sort of shit seeing as he never really spoke to Sam or his friends at Yale about it.
The morning before Dean’s intern exam found him waiting with Cas for the bus that would take his boyfriend to the hotel where the board exams were taking place the next day. The hospital parking bay was littered with doctors waiting around for their bus. In the middle of all the commotion stood Dr Josie Sands who wore a calm and bemused smile. In stark contrast, Cas stood next to Dean almost shaking with nerves. Not giving a shit what others thought Dean laced his fingers through Cas' and held onto his hand tightly. The shaking stopped but Dean could tell that Cas still wasn't breathing properly.
The new apartment had been part of ‘the fresh start’. When Cas first moved back to Kansas City they spent a lot of time in his new apartment. That was mainly because Cas said numerous times that even walking into the old place they used to share would be ‘freaky as fuck’. Finally, after months of going back and forth between two apartments, Dean caved in, found a new place and Cas would be moving in as soon as the lease on his was up.
“Gossiping?” Dean snapped. “I wasn’t gossiping Cas! I was just worried about you after Meg’s party…well before Meg’s party actually and I wanted to know-”
"You have a terrace?" Dean asked. "Damn, all I have in my room is tiny bottles of shampoo and a smart mouth brother." Cas let out a warm chuckle as he took Dean's hand and lead him outside. The terrace was a gorgeous space filled with plants and sumptuous looking sofas. The Manhattan skyline served as a backdrop and Dean noticed, with a smile, that Cas had dotted candles in strategic places. Invisible speakers were playing music, a slow and moody jazz number. It screamed romance.
By the time Dean got back to the apartment, Cas was just coming in from his shift at the hospital. Cas wasn’t the best person early in the morning or very late at night so he looked more like a zombie than a cardiothoracic surgeon at that point. With a chuckle, Dean helped him out his coat and guided him towards the bathroom to shower.
“I know, I know Castiel.” Samandriel said ducking his head. The room fell silent for several moments before Anna looked back towards Castiel with a confused look.
“Yeah…I mean you’re an asshole with piss poor people skills but, like you said all those months ago, you and I would have fun together this year. I think the next year in Maryland could even more fun.” Dean said remembering back to that first shift at the hospital.
“Fuck off Winchester, you love me and you know it.” Cas said grinning over at Dean. Dean couldn’t even be bothered to fight the smile that spread across his face as he looked at Cas. He leaned over gently and captured Cas’ lips in a kiss. “You know what will cure this hangover?”
“That’s what I said,” Dean said as he sat down next to Cas. “Were you there to see Gabriel’s routine?”
"Oh yeah it’s always a real joy to be there.” Jo said derisively. “If my mama asks then I've been here since school finished working." Jo said glancing around the coffee shop as if looking for her formidable mother.
By the time Dean got home after his shift the next day Cas was already home and sat on the couch busy working. His laptop was open and surrounded by files and notes. Cas barely glanced up when Dean walked through the door and that felt like a punch to the gut.
I am determined to finish this fic if there's anyone out still reading. This chapter is short but the drama will ramp up from here.
“It could be him, ok it’s probably him, but who the hell is the Abercrombie model who just poofed in here?” Gabriel said waving his arms in Dean’s general direction. Dean looked highly offended by that comment.
“They’re completely harmless.” Charlie had said later on that day when they sat in the cafeteria with Jo, Sarah and Adam.
"I'm sorry about your mother Dean." Cas said as he reached out to take Dean’s hand, squeezing it tightly. Dean could feel a lump forming in his throat but he fought it back, there was no way he was going to cry right now.
The Winchesters lived in a relatively large turn of the century house only three blocks away from Castiel. The house was a lot like Castiel’s own house apart from the fact that the Winchester house didn’t fill him with a sense of foreboding like his own home. Dean parked up on the driveway behind a nondescript silver hatchback which Castiel presumed belong to Dean and Sam’s mother.
"No, because you were shirtless. It’s quite impossible to look away." Cas admitted. Dean laughed softly. "Shut up Winchester," Cas said.
“Don’t even bother trying to finish that sentence Cas.” Dean said marching over to his car. "Get in" he then snapped pointing at the passenger’s seat. Castiel stared him down, almost challenging him to give up on whatever plan was going through his head. "Cas I swear to God that if you don't get in this car right now I will fucking make you." Dean added. With a sigh Castiel climbed into the passenger seat. The Impala roared into life but as soon as the stereo started up Dean shut it off filling the car with a heavy silence.
“Because you only ever call me when something is wrong or you’re inviting me someplace that ends up in disaster.”
“I liked the anonymity.” Castiel said bluntly. “It was easier being a ‘Reeves’ than a ‘Novak’.” Castiel added.
Castiel was rapidly falling for Dean Winchester. There was no other way around it. He’d tried as hard as he could to not even find it in him to care for Dean but it had been impossible in the end. There were moments when he was around Dean and he had to physically restrain himself from closing the space between them and telling Dean everything, showing Dean just how much he needed him and that he didn’t want to ever leave. That way of thinking was dangerous though, Castiel knew as much because he didn’t have it in him to have that stability. He wasn’t a calm pond, a light summer’s breeze or a blank piece of paper; no he was a cataclysmic wave, a hurricane force wind and covered in flaws. He didn’t deserve anything that Dean could possibly give him despite that fact that as the days went on Castiel was finding it harder to spend time away from Dean.
"Don't push it Joanna Beth." Inias called as he went. As soon as Inias was out of view Jo skipped round the counter and sat down by Castiel and Anna. Anna gave Jo a quick smile as Jo reached over to take a sip of Anna’s coffee.
“Dean got accepted to the University of Wisconsin” Castiel blurted out. “He told me last night. He hasn’t told his mom or Sam or Charlie yet. He wanted me to be the first person he told because…well he told me that he loves me. He wanted me to be the first to know because I helped him put together his portfolio and because he loves me.” Anna didn’t a word; she just carried on looking at Castiel with concern. “He loves me, and I’m pretty damn sure I love him as well but he’s going to be four hours away…he’s not going to be there and it scares me ok? What if I need him and he’s not there?”
Sam held Dean’s determined look for as long as he could before he looked away, his cheeks slowly going red. They finished breakfast in silence and Dean cleared away the kitchen while Sam, supposedly, went off to take his medication.
“If you yell at him I think his brain will explode.” Dean said while Cas continued to groan. “How’s the head babe?” Dean asked Cas. Cas groaned yet again. “Yeah, his brain will definitely explode if you yell.” Dean said.
"Cas...I'm not going to let that happen." Dean said removing the space between them by resting his forehead against Castiel's.
“Yeah, I just went over it just this morning,” Dean said abandoning the pudding cup even though Krissy would be pissed as hell. “Should we tell Krissy and her parents?”
“You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.” He added because Cas was probably trying to think of about fifty different reasons as to why he shouldn’t go.
Cas’ smiling face, half hidden by sunglasses. Windows rolled right down and the burning hot sunlight drowning his face with glorious sunlight. The radio turned up high. Cas pretending to not be singing along to Dean’s music but blushing whenever Dean caught his eye. Those months spent on the road were the happiness months of Dean’s life. Just him and Cas exploring the country and growing more and more in love.
“Are either of you going to help-holy fucking shit!” Jimmy yelled as he came into the room. He quickly covered his eyes and bashed into the doorframe in his haste to get out the room. “What the fuck is going on?” They heard Jimmy yelling as he hurried down the hallway. “What the fuck?”
"No...not at you." Cas said. "Come on, you said we need to get going." He added, opening the door and exiting the trailer.
The spare room was mainly full of the stuff Dean hadn’t gotten round to unpacking when he’d first moved into the apartment during the summer. A lot of the boxes were full of photos and stuff from Yale, college and photos from back home. There were countless textbooks and journals from both college and medical school, with the spare bed serving as a makeshift bookshelf. Both Dean and Castiel surveyed the room as they ate their breakfast muffins (and Dean could really get used to those damn muffins because they were fucking amazing).
While Cas got on the phone to UNOS about a viable heart for Krissy, Dean was asked to stay and keep watch over the teenager. She looked pale and weak, Dean’s heart really went out to her because from the way her parents had talked about her Krissy probably wanted to be anywhere but in the hospital.
“Anyway, enough yammering about serious shit. We’re here. Sammy, welcome to Garrison High” Dean proclaimed loudly as they drove into the student parking lot.
"Danyael, well this is a surprise. It’s so lovely to have you drop by like this." A drawling voice sneered as Dean approached the door. Despite his hesitation to use the demon blade Dean grabbed the hilt ready to defend himself from an attack. He had promised Sam that he would return to Heaven and he planned on doing just that “It has been quite some time hasn’t it?” The drawling voice added as the owner stepped out of an alcove. Bile burned Dean’s stomach and he took the cold face of Zachariah the chief torturer in Hell. He was once an angel until he betrayed half of Heaven and had his grace removed. Dean had not been surprised when he heard Zachariah had taken up the knives in Hell and began cutting.
just to be there for me and all the while...I just hate my dad. He’s dead and I hate him. Like, fuck…I feel like Meg of all people got it. She didn’t say sappy shit, she just joked about me being in the Dead Parent Club.”
Dean waited for the engine to turn over but nothing happened. “No baby, just start please.” Dean pleaded, sending out a silent prayer.
Gabriel’s breathing was becoming laboured as Castiel looked up towards the sky. His mother had told him as a child that he was blessed, that angels watched over him and his siblings but nothing looked back but the inky black sky littered with barely visible stars.
“No, I think I saw five minutes of one of them about ten years ago but that was it.” Castiel said nonchalantly.
and they all just stared blankly at me.” Cas grumbled as he pulled a beer out the fridge. “I think this is karma, I’ve done so much shit in my life that now I’m stuck with awful students. Should never have had sex with my RA first year of college…he had a good ass though.” Cas added with a mutter.
“Because I’m happy. Because this is all I want. You and me.” Cas said, pulling Dean into his arms. Dean was so content in Cas' arms that he fell into a peaceful sleep after a few minutes.
“Well you’re quite to the point aren’t you?” Castiel Reeves asked with a cocked eyebrow. “Yes I knew Rachel, we worked together and I was walking her back to her dorm that night,” Castiel said. Bingo. This had to be the good friend. “When I told the cops what I saw they assumed I was drunk or high…probably both.” He added bitterly. “They took my statement but I don’t think they believed me at all.”
"I want you, Dean. I've wanted you ever since that first day. Every time you called me out for being an ass made me want you even more." Cas whispered hungrily and that was enough to nearly send Dean over the edge but he wasn't some horny teenager, he wasn't going to come purely from hot kisses and words whispered in his ear.
"He's been asking Sam about you all weekend, you know? He's sorry. He wanted to call but…" she pressed because as mad as she was at Dean, she knew deep down that he really did care about her brother.
"This isn't a conversation on who needs to see a therapist, Dean," Sam said with a sigh. "Ruby shouldn't have said that to you."
“You really mean that?” Cas asked and it was impossible for Dean not to chuckle with a small shake of his head.
He managed to make it to his trailer without anyone else stopping him, which felt like a miracle. Dean raced inside the trailer, grabbing the nearest duffel bag he could find and shoving clothes in haphazardly. He was really doing this, he was getting out of here and finally having something in his life that wasn’t based around the damn show. It felt incredible. His duffel bag was completely packed when he heard a knock on his trailer door.
“You…you don’t have to worry that what happened in London is going to happen here,” Cas said and his heart hurt when he saw the relieved look on Dean’s face. “I want this to be something…if that’s what you want.”
“I don’t care that it hurt me. I care about Jo and Ellen…they’re some of the only family I have left after Sam and Bobby. I can’t deal if they get hurt.” Dean said, ripping off a piece of sandwich and throwing it into his mouth.
“Dad! Come on in, we’re making chilli for dinner.” Claire said, looking far too happy for her own good. “Jack, grab some chips and gauc out the fridge."
Dean found Novak on the cardio ward, in the small room he used as his office by the looks of it. He must have hear Dean’s footsteps approaching because he sighed with exasperation as Dean entered the office. “Milligan I asked for those scans an hour- you’re not Milligan.” He said frowning when he spotted Dean standing in the doorway. Talk about warm welcome. Dean was tempted to tell Adam to forget about this whole thing but the thought of free coffee for a week, let alone a month without having to go gross stuff like help with ‘Lumps and Bumps’ day, was enough to sway him. Dean sucked in a deep breath and tried to think of positive thoughts, mainly Dr Castiel Novak being shipped off somewhere far away.
she gets this stubbornness from you Cas.” Dean said. What surprised Cas the most was that despite how exasperated Dean sounded there was still some affection in his tone “Whereabouts are you guys? I’ll bring Tweedledee back to you and drag Tweedledum back to Kansas with me.”
The temptation to make a quipping remark was lost on Dean’s lips when his eyes met Castiel’s. Maybe that sense of comradeship he’d felt since offering Castiel a ride to New York had been something more. Over the past few days their conversation had flowed more easily than conversations Dean had with some of his closest friends. Still he barely knew Castiel and to act on whatever thrumming sensation was running through his body would be stupid and reckless.
“The girls from this morning?” Dean asked. He didn’t look impressed by the idea of Hester and her friends. In fact, he looked like he would rather break his own feet than spend time with Hester.
"Evening everyone. Castiel, Gabriel was just telling about the choreography for your fight scene." Richard said as everyone greeted each other.
Cas looked Dean up and down, shooting back his own challenging look. Even in ratty dance clothes, Dean was still one of the most attractive young men that Cas had seen. Yet He didn’t scream ‘perfect’ and maybe, just maybe, that was why Cas was so drawn to him. Outside of the dancing world, Dean could have been just another guy. Just another attractive guy that Cas felt drawn to. That was why he liked Dean, he wasn’t just another dancer with no personality.
“Ok, you’re telling the story completely wrong, Dean. You didn’t even have your license yet so you couldn’t legally drive it. Plus my friend and I needed it for a personal errand," Bela said flippantly.
In the first week after Jo moved out, it really hit Dean just how much he'd come to rely on the money that Jo had put into the apartment. True most of it had been on food or the TiVo but it made Dean realise just how much he'd eaten into his savings when he'd first moved to Chicago. He didn't earn a lot, if anything, as an intern and he still had some student loans to pay off. He didn't want to find a smaller place, he'd grown incredibly fond of his apartment, but it was obvious that he couldn't afford to stay living in the apartment by himself. With Sam away in California there was only one other person Dean felt like he could live with even if it was fast. Then again he'd spent so long tiptoeing around his feelings and maybe the gesture would say the things Dean wasn't sure he could say yet.
“Want a coffee to go?” Dean then asked pulling out two travel mugs. Castiel nodded his head appreciatively. Dean poured coffee into the travel mugs and placed them on the kitchen countertop. “I’m gonna grab my jacket then we can get outta here.”
“What’s the matter? The surgery went without a single problem and all of the attendings are talking about it. Josie Sands said that your technique was good and your patient is going to be fine, what’s the matter?” Cas asked frowning with concern.
“I can’t take off my pants if you keep kissing me.” Dean said as he pulled away and Cas just groaned because this man drove him so insane but all Cas wanted to do was kiss every inch of his body. “This is the worst idea ever.”
“But using me as a weapon wasn’t right at all! I’m not just some object that can be thrown at Dad whenever Michael or Luke feels like it! I’m a goddamn person!” Castiel snapped loudly before cursing himself inwardly because no doubt Charlie and Sam had heard him from the kitchen.
“Answer your phone man. I have a lecture on coronary aortic aneurysms first thing tomorrow and if I fall asleep I'm going to get a book thrown at me.” A grumpy voice said from across the room. The voice belonged to his roommate Kevin who was the biggest grouch unless he had coffee in his hand or was asleep.
Dean thought as the moan went straight through Dean, his dick twitching with interest and Dean knew the fucker probably did it on purpose.
“By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.” Jimmy gently cupped Amelia’s face as he brought her in for a tender kiss.
was I ever friends with that girl?” He wondered out loud. Dean let out a light chuckle and held Cas even closer. “What time is our flight back to New York?”
“Why do you worry so much about this place? I know it’s what your father wanted but why do you put this much into it? Most people who get given these things to them on a plate waltz through life, you actually care though. Why?” Dean asked.
“Huh?” Castiel said as he tried to think why on earth Gabriel would be calling him in the middle of the day unless he’d decided to go on a random ‘adventure’ and had ended up halfway to Vegas…again. Then again Castiel had seen him that morning and Gabriel was under house arrest until next week because of his last spur of the moment adventure. Maybe he’d attempted to do his own laundry and flooded the washroom…again. Though Castiel could hardly say anything because he couldn’t remember the last time he’d even washed a single sock, he just threw his clothes into the laundry hamper and hoped that Michael wouldn’t rummage through his pockets on his quest to prove Castiel was a delinquent. The time Michael had found several condoms in Castiel’s back pocket had been amusing for everyone but Michael. Luke had even given Castiel a clap on the back and made several manhood jokes.
"With good fucking reason Jo!” Dean yelled. He wasn’t going to be bitched out by Jo of all people. “That fucking thing
“Yeah but I get the feeling you don’t want to hear it.” Dean said walking over it sit down next to Bela. “We did though…well Novak did everything he could but the aneurysm burst and after that there was nothing else we could do to the repair the damage. I’m really sorry.”
“I still can’t understand what you're saying, dude.” He said with a grin. Cas groaned and rubbed his eyes before looking up at Dean.
"I'll set the table mom, don't worry," Cas said standing up and making his way over to the dining room.
"Fine, talk." Castiel said turning to look at Dean and when saw Dean's face swimming in pain and upset he hated himself because he'd caused that. He had made Dean feel dejected.
“Well I saw his brother Sam in the office. He was telling the office that Dean wouldn’t be in today and Charlie was with him. She looked really weird and gave me such a strange look. Did Dean say anything to you about the fight or something? You two haven’t fallen out again have you?”
Cas could see the determination in everyone's eyes as they learned the steps. Balthazar and Gabriel's choreography was complex, harder than any routines they had ever been taught before. At night the entire senior class took up the physical therapy department, all sitting in ice baths or having minor injuries looked over. Jo and Charlie were involved in a fierce competition of who had the bigger blood blister.
"Leave it; everyone will be at work or wherever Gabriel goes in the middle of the day so we have the house to ourselves." Castiel said with a shrug as he barely looked around the mess that was his room.
He didn’t want to think about what was going on at all. He just wanted to feel close to Cas again. It didn’t matter that he was still mad at him, even after the kiss at the airport, he just wanted to feel his skin against Cas’. Sweatpants and boxer were soon on the floor as they both crashed against Dean’s bed. It didn’t matter that they were supposed to be at a wedding in an hour. Right now it was just about them.
“How did you…who are you? Where are you?” Castiel called out. He looked around the room once again for a source of the voice, jolting when he saw his own reflection in the ornate mirror hanging above the fireplace. He noticed how pale he’d become since walking into the room, dark circles under his eyes stood out. Maybe this was all down to a lack of sleep.
"Have fun with all the gay sex in New York." Josie called out before walking off down the driveway. Dean shook his head as he watched her go. Sure, Josie was scary as hell and swore like a sailor but he was going to miss working for her. Though his blood pressure was probably going to go back to normal now.
“He might be in law school but you’re way too good for him, you’d chew him and spit him out in a matter of seconds. It would be total carnage.”
“It’s gonna take me at least seven hours to get home unless I break the speed limit for the entire drive,” Dean said trying to quash the guilt he was feeling over putting Cas through all of this.
“Yeah but, fuck, I hate that word.” Dean said as he looked away from Castiel and focused on the water in front of him. “God I never thought my life would turn out this way. I always thought I’d still be driving around with my Dad hunting down shit that went bump in the night. Fuck…I’m being a complete asshole talking about this shit when I’ve given you the worse news anyone could hear yesterday. If I were you I’d be throwing punches.”
“Yeah, called my mom.” Dean said shortly trying not to look at Cas. “I’m going for a shower.” He added taking off down the hallway. Light footsteps followed him.
"Nah." Cas said with a snort. "We fucking shatter them. We're gonna outlive those fucking stars." He said, his face cracking into a brilliant and beautiful smile. Fuck, Dean didn’t even think it was possible to love someone so much but, man, did he love Cas. Star shattering love.
“I haven’t…hadn’t lost a patient in over a year you see. It hit me hard that one died during a procedure I’ve been involved in countless times.” Castiel explained sitting down on Dean’s couch. Whoa, now Dean was beginning to understand by Cas had taken it so hard. Not losing a single patient in a year was a good streak.
"I'll miss you too, I’ll call you when I get back to New York, ok?” Dean said, smiling sadly at his mother.
After a few hours of driving, Dean gave in to his hunger and stopped off in a small nondescript dinner for food and coffee. The burger was too greasy even for his liking and the coffee bitter, nothing like the rich Italian brand Cas kept in the cupboards back home. There would always be a fresh, hot mug waiting for Dean as soon as he woke up or when he got back from the hospital because Cas knew how much Dean loved that stupidly strong coffee. Shit, he wasn’t supposed to be thinking about Cas at all right now and yet there he was, sat in some crappy dinner eating questionable meat and finding it impossible to not think about the man he’d all but walked out on. Part of him just wanted to turn back but he knew he needed time to think. He needed to hear Sam’s advice. Dean was barely in the dinner for fifteen minute before he threw down his tip for the waitress who looked like she wanted to be anywhere but in the diner. Dean really couldn’t blame her either. He gave her a small smile before he left the diner, got back into the Impala and carried on driving towards California.
“Oh Dad is upstairs unpacking and Michael and Luke actually did die when the smelt the alcohol vapours seeping from your pours.” Gabriel said smirking. “What exactly did you do last night? Are you even supposed to be drinking?” Gabriel asked looking Castiel up and down.
“There you go, you’ve got four whole hours to get a grip.” Gabriel said. “Hey Claire, you gonna eat the rest of that sandwich?”
know was that they both needed to be naked. Right this very moment. From the look in Cas’ eyes, he agreed.
"Yes," Cas said until the bus came round the corner. "No, I'm going to be sick. Dean I’m honestly going to be sick." He countered quickly.
He lay like that for hours until finally, Dean gave up. He changed out of his clothes and into a simple pair of jeans and a dark Henley. Even though it was the early hours of the morning Dean slipped out of his room and slowly made his way to Castiel’s room.
“Yeah…yeah…I have to get to Long Island. Take the car back to South Dakota and I’ll see you in a few days.” Dean explained.
“Hey, it’s gonna be fine.” Jo said as she sat down next to Dean. “So… how are you doing?” she asked.
“When I first heard that Castiel was dating an intern I was very disappointed in him.” Dr Sands said sounding very blunt. “It’s a cliché that riddles lesser hospitals and lesser residents. When I found out that it was you I was even more disappointed because the pair of you are destined for greatness. Castiel has shown impeccable promise since his very first day and you, well you Dean Winchester came out top of your class at Yale and scored one of the highest MCAT scores this hospital has seen in a long time.”
time.” Charlie said, shrugging like this was no big deal. “We...we figured that you’d want to just chill, away from everyone else. Is this...this ok?” She added with a worried look in Dean’s direction.
“Because they’ll be food.” Anna said rolling her eyes. She turned to Jessica. “Looks like it’s just you and me at the florist.”
"No, he said that while I was a skilled surgeon there were others that were better," Cas said, his eyes dropping as he looked down at the floor with a broken expression.
Mom and Dad want to send flowers to Rachel’s parents. Send the address. Try and get some sleep. Answer your phone once in a while.
"You'd be surprised. We've won a fair few awards over the past few years." Dean said with a laugh as Cas took his jacket and lay it across a nearby chair. "God, we won big the first year I was a producer. Sam had finished up with film school and I'd brought him on as part of the camera crew. We swept the board in our categories. Josie was so drunk out of mind that she dragged me to her hotel room and said 'Winchester, if you weren't my gay son I'd marry your twink ass.'" Dean recounted, his laughter filling the room. "Before I could even reply to that she passed out on the bed. I stayed in her room all night to make sure she didn’t throw up on herself or her dress. I had to carry her to the bathroom at four in the morning so she could throw up in the bathtub."
“Bigger things to worry about than Mom killing me because I got boned by her priest. What do you mean your marriage is over?”
"You don't know shit anymore. Especially about me. Now if you're done being the world's biggest asshole, I'm going to do my job." Dean said. "I'd say it was nice talking to you but you're a dick." He added before pushing his way past Ryan and out into the lobby. He called down an elevator and pressed the button for the penthouse suite, his heart hammering with both annoyance and excitement.
“You’re not going anywhere.” Dean said quickly and Castiel’s stomach jolted almost violently as Dean’s words sunk in. “I did it, I did what I set out to do.”
can go home.” He said pointing at Gabriel. “And you two can go upstairs to think about what you’ve done. Without your phones as well.” Cas said, holding out his hand for Claire and Jack’s phones. “Upstairs.
The hallway was busy with people standing around and talking to one another, drinks or phones in hand. The den, just like the hallway, was packed with people and swamped in a haze of smoke as Castiel and Anna made their way through. Anna wrinkled her nose at the smell but didn't say anything though she did shoot Castiel a look of annoyance when he pulled his crumpled packet of cigarettes out his pocket. She, like Gabriel, had been trying to get him to quit for several months but she hadn’t pushed him too hard on the matter as she knew that would get make him more stubborn.
"Fuck it, we'll just skip today, I haven't done my essay for English anyway." Castiel shrugged. Anna would be pissed but there was nothing he could do about that, besides he would explain everything to her after.
“I want to go to the hospital," Cas said to Balthazar while the EMTs started to move Meg. Her skin was a ghostly grey colour and Cas could barely look at it. “My parents are Meg and Ruby’s sponsors and we’re basically all the family they have. Anna and I will want to be there...we...we need to be there, please," Cas explained.
He knew that during the summer Charlie took part in several role-playing events in her hometown. They had something to do with a fantasy medieval realm but that was as far as his knowledge went.
." Dean explained. "Things nearly changed when…fuck…you see my dad died a few years back. It was a routine hunt that went wrong and I couldn’t save him. Others thought my brother would join me but I refused. Sam…well he deserved a life away from all of it and he's got that now. He lives with his girlfriend in South Dakota, not far away from family friends. He went to Stanford on a scholarship and now he’s working in this tiny family law firm."
…I haven’t been called Megaera since I set fire to my Nana’s kitchen when I was ten," Meg said with a sniff. “Full names are just shit, I mean who the hell is Charlotte?”
“My…my brother rang me and I need to go.” Samandriel said. He could tell his room-mates that his brother had died but then he would need to explain what he family did for a living.
“You’re walking away from what you father wanted of you?” Naomi asked. “You can’t honestly tell me that you’re thinking of doing this. This is ridiculous Castiel! Jimmy wasn’t prepared for this like you were.”
when I see it.” Mary said rolling her eyes as Dean motioned for Castiel to follow him out the kitchen. “Now don’t forget about Charlie” Mary called after Dean as they walked out the kitchen towards a spacious living room with several cardboard boxes still pushed up the far wall.
“Hopefully sooner rather than later,” Cas muttered stretching his arms over his head. “Which way is your shower?”
“I did go back. I have a house in Chelsea with a few friends of mine but my father’s assistant called me last week. She told me that my father had fallen ill and that I needed to be here. Once she used his debit card to pay for my First Class ticket I reluctantly came here to keep a silent vigil by his bedside.” Bela said. The acerbity over her presence at her father’s bedside was not lost on Dean.
“Yeah, of course, wouldn’t miss it for the world. Are Sam and Jess coming as well?” Jimmy asked. Dean snorted once again.
“Cas and I got into a fight. Well more like I started the fight then walked out because I’m too emotionally stunted to deal with all this bullshit. I just want to be with Cas, I don’t want all the shit that people are giving me over it.” Dean said running his hands through his hair. “I mean, sure I had to go through this sort of shit with Michael but that was because people were getting used to me dating a guy. This is different because it’s my career that’s in jeopardy. The freaking Chief of Surgery gave us shit over it for fuck sake.”
"At me" Castiel said without any question to it because Dean probably had a right to be angry at him after what he did.
“He’s a kickass surgeon and he doesn’t scare the shit outta Adam, unlike some people.” Dean said with a mock accusatory tone.
“You should take the morning off tomorrow,” Cas said when he and Dean were getting into bed half an hour after Mary and John left. “You can catch up with your parents before they go to visit Sam in California,” Cas added while he shuck off his shirt, throwing it onto the chair where Dean’s own clothing had been flung only moments before.
“Oh! Right…um…Jo and I went on our date last night and as you can see I’m still alive so it went pretty well.” Adam said grinning from ear to ear as he began to scrub in. “Laser Tag was definitely a good choice. I just told her about scrubbing in with you and if all goes well then we’re going out for drinks tonight. I mean Charlie and Sarah are gonna be there, you and Novak can come as well, but she still asked me, not me asking her so that’s a good sign right?”
“Yeah. What's going on with you and my brother anyway? I thought you two were friends but he doesn’t hang out with you at school."
“I…I don’t know Anna.” Castiel said shaking his head. The name Danyael flashed through his mind once again but that was all there was; a name with no face. “I don’t have any memory of leaving The Pit…I saw a light and that…there was nothing but light.” He tried to explain but he couldn’t. “We need to find Gabriel. I tried ringing him-”
“Yeah well… Cas is here.” Dean said. Mary was silent on the other end of the phone. Mary had been heartbroken when the marriage between Dean and Cas ended, she had really loved Cas and she had loved her weekly phone calls. The pair of them would talk about the most random shit for hours on end. It had never failed to amuse Dean. It was the only time Cas never swore with every other word.
"Can we just talk? I don't understand what's going on because really you're like a completely different person half the time and I really don't get it." Dean said. "You're round our house and acting like you don't have a care in the world then the next moment you're blanking me, acting like a total dick and trying to be more badass than you are."
“He’s not all bad. He’s mooning over some girl back at Stanford by the sounds of it. If he’s telling me about her then he’s probably smitten even if he won’t admit it anyone.”
“Trying out some new hospitality techniques?” Castiel asked as Jo usually told them to stand and wait for their damn drinks because she wasn’t a damn waitress.
“You were down there a long time. Zachariah has ways of making deals with people down there. We didn't know how much you'd been twisted by him. You could have been beyond saving.” Dean explained.
"I've spent two years traveling all over, trying to forget you but it's been so hard." Cas admitted as he chewed on his lip. He didn't look like the confident, cocky guy Dean had met all those years ago. He looked small, worn down and broken.
As his picked up his pace the song playing on his iPod changed. Without even getting to the second line of the first verse Castiel changed the song, he wasn't about to run to one of Dean's favourite songs. Dean. Dean who had kissed him. Dean who cared about him and worried about him. Dean who Castiel had thrown out of his room because he was too much of a coward to let Dean know his feelings. Castiel laughed bitterly at that thought; he would always be a coward in that aspect because he had been perfectly content with hiding what he felt for the other boys for as long as possible because they actually scared him. Feelings were for people who weren't strung out on anti-depressants most days. That sounded harsh, cruel almost, but Castiel knew it was true. Feelings were for people who actually planned their lives and cared about themselves. Feelings weren't for hopeless fuck ups like himself.
“You have a weird look on your face.” Josie said as she stared at him. “You didn’t run into Ryan did you?” She asked. Dean shook his head. “You sure? You look tweaked.”
“You could do that but then I could also say that I won’t make burritos for dinner tonight,” Cas said smugly. Dean stopped and cursed. Damn Cas and his damn burritos. Ok and damn Dean for his total lack of willpower. “That’s what I thought.” Cas jested smugly.
"Not with us you haven't," Charlie said. “You’ve only seen the lame New York. Not the misfit toys New York.”
“Yes but you know you like knowing all the sordid little details of this school and don’t lie by saying that you don’t.” Anna shot back and Castiel had to agree with her on that point. He did enjoy hearing about which member of faculty was nearing a full scale breakdown or about how one member of the JV football team hadn’t left school last year because he was moving to North Dakota with his grandmother; he’d actually been sent to some hard-core religious school in Utah because his father had found him in a compromising position with a fellow member of the football team. “I think his name is Dan…or was it Dean…I can’t remember. Apparently his family has just moved here and that’s all I heard before I had to leave.” Anna added nodding over at ‘Dan or was it Dean?’.
“Hey there ginger” Dean said walking into the den and stopping with a surprised look on his face when he spotted Castiel sat there next to Charlie. “Oh, hey there Castiel” He said coughing slightly “I didn’t know you were gonna be here man…um what are you guys watching?”
“It can’t be any worse than the things that Anna and Gabriel have done to me in the past,” Cas said. “Gabriel once sent a singing stripper to my dorm room when I was at college. Then there was the time Anna rang me and told me she was in Peru when I thought she was supposed to be at law school.”
“Right, follow me.” Novak said as he started walking down the hallway. Dean grabbed a pager, call list and protocol book before hurrying after Novak, Jo and the others hot on his heels. For the first hour, Novak showed them the most important parts of the hospital and gave them his list of rules. Basically, if they missed any of their pages, acted like idiots or pissed off Castiel in any way then they would be on scut for the rest of their lives. Ok, he had survived college and medical school but Dean was pretty convinced that the following year was going to kill or manage to be the worst year of his if he managed to survive it. After their tour, Castiel Novak took them back to the station where they had started their tour and doled out assignments.
but something, maybe it was fear, inside of him stopped him. There was a chance that Dean had just been humouring him that night and there wasn’t any connection between them.
"Yes, I'm ok. I think I'm slowly getting the hang of this whole thing." Cas said. “I still don’t think I belong here.” He added, his voice small and near a whisper. Dean understood that. He never thought he belonged in this world of reality TV. Even with Josie’s support or having Sam with him. Even after he met and fell in love with Ryan, Dean never felt like he really belonged.
Cas now had a great job within the government. When they’d first met Dean had made endless jokes about how Cas would be president one day. Cas had always rolled his eyes but smiled whenever Dean jokingly called him Mr President.
"You are such an idiot." Dean said. "You are such a fucking idiot Castiel Novak." It was the first time Dean had refered to Cas as 'Novak' for a long time. He'd been a Winchester. Not for long but he had been a Winchester.
“Ok…ok, go.” Jimmy said waving him away. Castiel knew that five minutes would pass with Jimmy still sat there thinking about their conversation. He would then mutter something to himself about Castiel being an idiot before he’d go back to the room he shared with Amelia and enter a restful sleep. Castiel on the other hand would be turning in his sleep all night as both conversations with Jimmy and Dean played over and over in his. Jimmy’s accusations about Castiel’s happiness, Dean’s conviction that Castiel wasn’t living his life to the fullest and that moment when Dean was explaining all about souls. That moment when their skin touched and Castiel felt electricity shooting through his veins.
“Double cheeseburger please,” Cas said moving a few files out of the way to make room for the food. “Did you get enough food?” he added almost sarcastically.
“Oh I know where he is, I’ve spent enough years researching for you all and watching you to know your patterns. While your father was teaching you to shoot a gun by the time you were eight years old mine was always teaching me about patterns. He was always teaching me how to be able to find anyone or anything. I’ve been following Gabriel, from afar, since he left. He’s here in Illinois at the moment; he’s in the south hunting some witch that killed a ton of high school seniors.” Anna explained.
Trying to think of anything clever to say completely went out the window as soon as Dean said “You’re still dreaming.”
He focused on breathing and out, all the while keeping an eye on the arrivals board. Cas’ plane had landed ten minutes prior. He’d be here any-
“Come on, stop being such a sour puss and dance with me. I hired the band for a reason.” Anna said letting Dean drain his drink before she grabbed his arm and lead him towards the makeshift dance floor. The music was some sort of light, airy jazz song which seems fairly easy for Dean to follow. He held onto Anna and just let his mind wander while they danced together.
"A lot. It's been two years." Cas said. Dean snorted. Yeah, it had been two years since Cas walked away from him without a word. Just divorce papers. "We have a lot of catching up to do."
"Sat out on my balcony with the others, it's just started to snow again." On the other end of the line, he heard Dean let out a wistful sigh.
“Well, then I’m fucked and not in a good way,” Dean said. “He’s my boss…he’s my friend and I just got out of a pretty serious relationship. It really sucks.”
“How did you even manage to fill the kitchen with booze?” Dean asked picking up a bottle of vodka. “I was at the hospital for an hour tops.”
They were back in the kitchen. This time it was without gin but Cas was back in those damn bumblebee print pyjama pants. Thankfully, he’d forgone a shirt.
"Now, now Danyael I would very much like to know where you got that little trinket. We’ve been missing one of those for quite some time and would very much like it back." Zachariah said trying to sound casual but Dean could feel the fear radiating from Zachariah’s skin.
“I’m sort of used to the cold by now.” Dean said with a shrug. Kanas winters could be a pain in the ass and it pretty much dumped snow in Connecticut as soon as winter came. “And I’m not a princess.” He added.
As he glanced over to his resident Dean knew he should have said ‘no’ because it would be easier in the end to not form a friendship with his superior; it would only end in more people assuming he was getting perks, whether they be professional or personal, and he didn’t want that at all. However, once he saw the open expression on Cas’ face he found it impossible to reject the offer. Cas was after all a good person, even if he had his moments of sharpness, and Dean was growing used to the tentative friendship they were establishing.
“You can’t drop an atomic bomb like that and expect me to not have questions Cas! Come on, tell me!”
“Dean Winchester, of course I want to marry you, you idiot.” Cas said, sighing with exasperation. “That’s why I was going to propose...tonight...at dinner.”
“Well you both look fantastic.” Mary said. “I’d join you but this wine is far too good. That’s not a sin, is it Father?”
“Hey. Did you stay here last night?” Charlie asked Castiel as she nearly threw herself at the coffee pot. And Castiel thought he was addicted to coffee. The look on Charlie’s face as she poured coffee into a large mug was that of complete bliss.
“Yeah well like I said, it’s a long story,” Dean said running a hand down his face and yawning. “I’m sorry I freaked you out, I didn’t really expect to find Sam’s girlfriend swinging a bat at me though.”
“You’re just giving up?” Anna asked, she sank in the couch and continued to stare at Dean with watery eyes. As if she were on the brink of tears. “I can’t believe you’re just giving up so easily.”
It was a month after Jimmy had found out about him and Cas. They were sat outside on the deck while Cas smoked and Dean drank from a bottle of beer. Cas looked over at Dean with a lazy smile and nodded his head. Dean smiled back at the idea of spending the whole summer driving around the US with his best friend and boyfriend. It was a good thought.
"Stealing my number off Charlie's phone, very ingenious." Dean said. "How did you get a phone? We normally take them off contestants, even the suitor."
“No, you’re safe as far away from the hunting life as possible!” Castiel yelled turning on his heels and storming past Anna.
“Cause you’re mine.” Dean said. He thought that Cas would rip the shit out of him for saying something so fucking cheesy but instead, Cas just looked at him with such adoration Dean started to blush. Without warning, Cas pulled Dean into a heat filled kiss.
"Um yeah...I can tell." Dean said nodding at the running shoes, shorts and large hoodie Castiel was wearing. "So do you always run in the rain?" Dean asked cocking his eyebrow.
“I wanted you to know that I’m never going to leave you…I know you worry about people running out on you but I’m not going to even if I go away for college. You have me, you’ll always have me.” Anna said lacing her fingers through Castiel’s and holding on tightly. Her bright eyes, bright even in the dark and full to the brim with purpose, found Castiel’s and locked onto them. “You’re my best friend and you’ll always have me.”
Castiel sighed with frustration as he asked “Because I told him that he had no right to worry about me?”
“They better include getting naked in that sexy ass car of yours.” Cas said boldly. Dean promised him that those plans certainly did. “I can’t wait, Farm Boy. This is certainly going to be an interesting summer.” Cas replied. "I'll see you in the morning."
“Idiot over here tried to overdo it on the ‘light’ exercise and now her chest really hurts. Please tell me she hasn’t crapped out this new heart already.” Claire said with a brittle tone while Krissy winced in her bed.
“Probably, once I was clear across the country in New York and knew that Michael had no power over me anymore.”
“Don’t act like it isn’t true Winchester, everyone knows that you’ve been screwing Novak and now it’s clear to us all why you got this surgery. Actually, it’s clear why you got to scrub in on so many of Novak’s surgeries before this. The two of you bump uglies then he rewards you with a gold star and a nice gory cardio surgery. It’s cute really…well if ‘cute’ meant ‘sickening to the core’. At first, I thought you were buddying up to Lafitte to get ahead but you went even further than that, had to keep all your bases covered, just in case Lafitte saw through it?” Ruby said sounding so sanctimonious Dean was tempted to smack her across the face. And he never thought about hitting a woman.
When I started writing it back in January I never thought it would a) be this damn long or b) be read by anyone at all. I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has read it, especially
“Clearly I’m on your side, I’m pissed that he’s here and I’m pissed that he’s hurt you.” Jo said with a hurt look on her face. “But... but it’s
“We.” Dean said, climbing out the Impala and striding over to Cas. “I made the mistake of not coming chasing after you all those years ago. I didn’t want you to have to chase me this time.” Dean said, shrugging like his words were far more casual than they were. Cas let out a chuckle and just shook his head.
