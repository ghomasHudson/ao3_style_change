Finally, after several ill-met quips, Tony had requested a serious, yet quiet, favor of Steve. His head hung down and he wouldn’t raise it to meet Steve’s eyes as he asked.
“I told you that you could ride it… feel the thrum of it beneath you..” if he hadn’t been so ticked at his shortcoming, the breathiness of Steve’s deepening voice would have stirred something in his pants. As it was, it was still stirring, but bitterly. He felt himself harden and shifted his hands in his pockets to hide his excitement.
Steve woke with a start, gasping for air. He sat upright but immediately regretted his decision to do so as pain split up the side of his head. He groaned and tried to raise his left hand towards his temple but found that his fingers were stuck under something heavy. He groaned and tried to get his bearings, not knowing where he was or what was going on.
It was a nice shelter. One that Steve prayed would be temporary until they were rescued. Surely the team would come for them. Come find them. He just hoped it was before Tony either died or went into a coma from the infection coursing through his body.
“No, you don’t understand,” Tony’s face wrinkled up as his eyebrows nestled closely to the bridge of his nose. “He’s the only thing securing this place. Without him anything-anyone can access the house and I can’t… I can’t be without that sense of security.” Tony rambled on, clearly disturbed, and started making grand gestures with his hands as if the movement would suddenly bring his automated butler back to life.
Frustration was filling Justin’s voice as he spoke, “What does this guy have? A sphincter of steel? What the absolute fuck?” He tried a slower speed, angling himself properly with his right hand, but could not penetrate. Angrily he slapped Steve’s ass cheeks. “What the fuck!?”
When they were alone, it would be talking and then silence and then for some reason Steve could feel himself opening up the Tony. Tony rarely opened up in return, but sometimes he would. Only to realize what he was doing, clam up, and then give Steve a slight punch on the deltoid and state that they both needed to ‘buck up buttercup’.
“Why Steve… why the fuck did you do that….” Tony cried, eyes wide and staring straight into Steve’s crystal blue ones. It was silent after the comment, both men just staring at each other with disappointment, anger, but mostly love.
“Nope.” Steve strode from the bathroom, wringing his hands to warm them from the ice-cold water that had streamed over them moments before. “Look, we can cook something up here. You can survive one night without JARVIS. You need a
Tony awoke to the feeling of pain. Pain in his throat, arms, legs, chest…. Everywhere. His head throbbed, and he felt light headed even though he could tell he was lying down. His eyes felt like they were glued shut, but slowly he opened them with what felt like was lash by lash. His forehead burned with fever and despite the fact that he was freezing, he could feel the stickiness on his skin from sweat.
“Bring him back onto the balcony or I swear to God and the Holy Spirits…” Steve didn’t feel that his threat needed finishing.
…. Don’t-hurt-him.” There was a sudden strength behind his last three words that Steve hadn’t heard since the first time Justin had fucked Tony.
Steve sighed in agreement and locked his arm in the crook of the mechanic’s elbow as they strolled along. The walk was uneventful until a lady ran backward, knocking into Tony and thus Steve, and spilt drinks all over the two men. A moment passed until Tony hissed and bit his upper lip, bitter but not angry about the incident.
What had happened to the other Avengers? Were they here too? Or was it just Tony? If they were here, he needed to find a way out
It was night. There were sand and rocks and more sand and more rocks. Some driftwood. He couldn’t make out the shoreline in the dark, but he could hear the water lapping against the sand. His pants were torn in multiple places and his shirt was still gone. There was a light red mark on his chest where the knife had been embedded, however it was scarred over.
Panic attacks were common as were random bouts of anger and tears. The outbursts were more common when the Avengers would get close to finally catching Hammer but would fail to nab him at the last minute. Fear would settle into the lines on his face and he would instinctively wrap his arms around his lower abdomen. He would set his mouth in a thin line and shout at the messenger, shout at them out of fear rather than anger.
“Every time is the perfect time for a pasty man like me to sunbathe… also the staff is pretty under-clothed and we can see which ones have tattoos.”
“-route going clear over 120 miles per hour ON a cliff side, and you are telling me that someone didn’t take a stealth-craft and drop your ass off up here. BULL
The Audi e-tron’s sleek black body zoomed around the bend, coming dangerously close to the metal railing that blocked off the road from the sheer Malibu cliff leading into the ocean. Rock and debris ricocheted off the asphalt as the tires spun endlessly, propelling the car and it’s rider forward at an alarming speed.
He was naked. Exposed. He was facing the concrete wall in the back of the cell with his hands still chained above his head and his legs spread more than shoulder’s width apart and shackled to the floor.
The doctor changed instruments multiple times. Each time Steve saw her surgical mask bob down closer to Tony’s gut, he would scream again. Medical jargon would fly from her mouth to the nurses, little of which Steve could make heads or tails. However, he understood pieces of the doctor’s latest comments.
That was never a good word. No matter who was saying it. Steve had learned from the internet that ‘yep’ and ‘k’ were death sentences. Irritation was universal.
The concrete walls were still there. The barred door was still there. The drain in the middle of the floor was still there. Everything was how it had been before he lost consciousness, except for Tony.
Hammer knelt in front of Tony, settling to his lowered level, and looked him in the eyes, tilting the genius’s chin up gingerly. Tony’s large blue eyes stared defiantly back into Hammer’s and he pulled his upper lip up in a snarl.
Steve fell on the floor when the piping broke and gasped, trying to bring as much air into his lungs as possible. He mentally prepared himself for whatever was coming before sidling up to Tony and putting his arm around the smaller man.
Hammer brought the gun out and shot, the bullet seeking and finding Steve’s thigh. Steve cried out in surprise and squeezed his eyes shut as fresh blood began pouring from the wound.
“Sir, you have not been out of the house for two weeks, nor socialized with anyone. I do think it would be benefic-“
“Okay…” Steve didn’t and pulled his mouth from Tony’s, moving along his bearded cheek and down to the crook where his collarbone met his neck. He sucked and licked the tender skin as Tony’s breath quickened. The mechanic’s good hand wound its fingers across Steve’s newly grown blonde hair, and pulled his face closer into his flesh, whimpering as Steve let a little nip of skin scathe between his teeth.
JARVIS rang loud and clear over the speakers to their room, ensuring that his volume was reverberating at the appropriate level for Steve’s serum-intensified eardrums. Steve gave a slight nod in hello.
One by one, the Hulk took each of them in his firm hands, squeezing slightly too tightly, and set them on the ground. Medics rushed around them. Steve laid still but was close enough that he reached out to grasp Tony’s hand. It was cold. Incognizant. But the fingers squeezed back.
Tony angrily bit Hammer’s bottom lip as his wits came about him. No gun to his or Steve’s head this time… so no rules against biting. The attack earned him a slap to the face.
Steve’s face flew downwards, and their lips connected. The tension and anger had built up until all that was left were tongues flying into each other’s mouths with passion. Steve braced himself in a push-up to decrease the pressure on Tony’s chest while never breaking their intimacy.
“I’m here, I’m here,” Steve said in a rushed, yet soothing voice. Tony was having a panic attack, gasping for air. Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes as he shoved the table and yanked against the chains binding him.
The patrons around them glared as they sloshed water out of the pool and onto the pool loungers next to it, but neither man cared; they were having fun. It was rare that any of the Avengers got to relax and enjoy themselves, much less the two leaders, and they weren’t about to sacrifice their temporary joy just to please some rich bastards.
He felt cold and hot at the same time and the wind only exacerbated the feeling. Knowing he was feverish as his vision was blurred around the peripherals, Tony shivered and moved his good arm across his belly in a weak attempt to cover himself.
Alarmed, Tony shot around to face the person speaking to him; sweat flung off the tendrils of hair that hung from his forehead. He raised his good fist defensively, before noting that the other person was only Steve. And that Steve was…. Spooning him?
Once Steve navigated his way through the underground tunnels beneath the missile silo and found Hammer’s helicopter, he had immediately grabbed the onboard first aid kit and flushed Tony’s wound with the only sterilizing agent that had been in the kit: 90% isopropyl alcohol and the same harsh fluid that Justin’s doctor had scourged Tony’s wounds with. Tony, unconscious and sprawled out on the backseat helicopter seats, had screamed and struggled against Steve, begging him to stop.
The fever had died down slowly. Steve took cloths of cool seawater to Tony’s head to cool him when he moaned of being too warm and he would sidle next to him when he was too cold. Steve got used to sleeping with the small man in the crook of his body. The man’s scent and pheromones, although odorous at times, seemed wild and feral to Steve; many a night he found his groin hardened by Tony’s body movement as he shifted, brushing against him. Many a night he had to leave the encampment to relieve himself, often crying in shame after his cum had spilled over his palm.
Tony had taken some of the rocks and sticks beside him and fashioned some sort of sundial. It didn’t work very well since it was shrouded by the forest line and wasn’t directly in the sun, but it made Tony feel useful to do something. He estimated that it could be an hour or two off, so it was either 3 pm or 1 pm or 5 pm... or 2 pm or 4 pm, he had no fucking idea. He guessed around 3 pm, just by looking at the sun lowering into the sky.
“We should get going buddy! The dance floor isn’t going to be near as hopping without Tony Stark taking down the floor.”
Natasha stood on the other side of the bed, looking back and forth between the two men. Her red hair was pulled back on one side in a pretty clip and she wore a shimmery red cocktail dress. She patted Tony’s good hand and leaned over to kiss him on the forehead. She turned her attention to Steve.
Tony didn’t cry often, but he felt like crying now. Howling even, as pain pounded every fiber of his body. Finally, he managed to sit fully, trying to get his eyes to open, even though they felt glued shut. The agonizing pain in his arm came to fruition as blood rushed from his upper body to the appendage, lighting the nerves even further on fire.
“I’m bored Rogers. He’s not really giving me the reaction I want anymore.” Hammer paced in front of Steve, hands behind his back casually and the same smug smile that he always wore plastered on his face.
“You guys can keep fighting. I am going into the tunnel and will take out a few of the beret-wearing suckers early-on.”
Steve, noticing Tony shooting him a glance questioning his sanity, blinked and sobered his expression. “How are you feeling?”
Hammer decided to create a distraction for Captain America and use the weapon to his advantage. He turned the muzzle of the gun towards Tony, closed one eye, and fired.
“He should wake up soon. The drugs have been mostly out of his system for a few hours now…just light sedatives for a few weeks to keep him compliant…. Which is saying something considering he is Tony Stark.” She smiled lopsidedly and looked deeper into Steve’s face after a beat.
The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. Steve reached out a hand, Tony taking it and helping to pull himself up. A cold look had settled onto Tony’s face as he sauntered out of the elevator, still stumbling. In a minute, Steve was there by his side, arm sliding around the man's waist again. This time, Tony’s shirt had slid up a bit and Steve was touching the bare, warm flesh of Tony’s hip.
The words were all he needed. Tony came again, dick aching as it splashed, this time weaker, hot streams of cum in puddles between them.
The untrained eye wouldn’t have noticed, but Steve, master tactician that he was, noticed that Tony was pointing to the only corner of the room that wasn’t adjacent to the ocean-view glass panels.
Steve, frozen and uncomfortable, limped over to where he suspected the door used to be. That tunnel was long; there would be no way to get through all the rock if the whole thing had collapsed. But, rather than go through the ceiling and further risking collapse of thousands of pounds of concrete on them, he decided that the main doorway was their best shot.
The corner was empty save for what appeared to be a small child, crying. It was a girl, bleach blonde hair falling over her face and bony shoulders. She rocked herself back and forth slowly, face hidden from view.
Tony sniffled and then nodded, sort of intimidated by the firmness of the soldier in front of him. The mechanic went into an adrenaline-based daze afterwards but stayed awake. His arm throbbed, but he felt numb. He didn’t care what Steve was saying, this man could hurt them both and it was up to Tony to save them.
Justin turned and looked him dead in the eyes as he continued walking. He stood still in front of Steve and traced the knife along the stomach of the body bag. Justin licked his lips and jerked the knife across the top of the bag, splitting the carbon fiber enforced seams with ease.
“If that’s the case then I am hellaciously optimistic right now…” Tony’s hand rose dismissively after his final comment, shushing Steve to allow him to think. Steve pursued his lips in acceptance and tried to form thoughts that may contribute towards their escape.
Tony found he couldn’t stop the panic attack from spreading over him and zapping any ounce of energy he had remaining in his body.
His shoulders and head stung. The serum was healing the sunburn that spread itself across his bare scalp and traps, but it was a slow process as he had not eaten or drank anything for two days. He walked to the pot where there was very little water, and cupped his hand into it, pulling out some of the liquid and touching it to his lips. He drank slowly, just enough to keep his body functioning.
Steve had to rest. His bloodied feet needed to be wrapped and he needed water. He sat on a rock by the seaside and tore off strips from his pants, turning them into a pair of shorts; he wrapped the cloth around his ankles and soles for protection.
“STEVE! STEVE WAIT IT’S ME!” He stumbled and fell face first into the sand, teeth clashing hard against his lips and tongue. He tasted blood. “Steve… please.” He outstretched his hand and found his mind slowly slipping away into darkness as he closed his eyes.
“I… the one that you said reminded you of me?” The lyrics played into Steve’s head and he felt his heart rise and eyes light up as he looked down into Tony’s soft blue ones.
Thank you for all the kudos! Please keep em coming; they really help me continue writing this. For a while I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it... or if it was even worth finishing. But your encouragement helps. :) <3 Tonee
“What was that Cap? Remind me to fix your comm when we get home. See you inside!” Tony continued walking into the hallway, remaining alert as his scanners processed the long stretch of lights before him.
He leaned his head into his hands and massaged his temples slowly, a dull ache settling in behind his eyes. He was sitting on a crumbled piece of concrete right next to Tony. The genius was crying in his sleep, pain written on his features.
Steve dodged the dancing cruisegoers and tried to chase after him, but three large men moved to stand in front of him. They were larger than Steve, and he pulled his head back, glaring at them.
“I’m so sorry…” Steve muttered, pressing his soft lips to Tony’s forehead. Fortunately, the fever had gone down over the course of the week, so his skin was finally a normal temperature. “I will never let anyone hurt you again…”
“No melodrama, Tony. We are both getting out of here. Alive.” The last word was said with hope and determination.
Steve heard the metal hitting the flesh before he smelled it. He could hear it sizzling, even from his distance, and he couldn’t help but squeeze his eyes shut and hold his breath.
“I vote Wing-face and Shell-brain.” Natasha sat casually on Steve’s desk, thumbing through some of his most recent artwork and turning her head slightly at the more abstract images. Her black, silk robe was tied tightly around her waist but didn’t fail showing off the unnatural curves from the knives hidden beneath it.
Irritated, the soldier looked up from where he was working and glared at Tony before pettily throwing sand at Tony in warning.
The fingers intertwined with Steve’s tightened and Tony’s eyes flickered open slowly, long lashes brushing briefly against the freckles that lined his cheeks. Steve was so close he could see every line and pore marking Tony’s face.
He coughed uncontrollably, ribs aching as he did so. He spat blood onto the floor and swallowed down the metallic taste.
He had barely made it to 9 AM before the day went to complete and utter shit. Of course, this happens when you are a superhero, 90% of your friends are superheroes, and all of you are battling multiple giant robots wreaking havoc on New York City at 5 in the morning. Good times.
!” Steve, normally calm and in control of the situation, was clearly flustered. His teammates disregarded the super soldier and continued about their ways, stopped short by the exit door sliding open. Groomed goatee, coiffed hair, and the pressed suit of Tony Stark came into view. Despite the time, his sunglasses covered the bottom half of his eyes, sapphire irises peeking out and staring at each of the people before him before settling on Steve.
DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH HIM!” Tony’s eyes blazed furiously, and he pulled against his restraints, torn shoulder ligaments straining and causing him to pant as he struggled.
“Tony…. God…” Steve took his pointer finger and caressed the corner of Tony’s lips, pulling back in fearful awe and glancing at the red that stained his fingertip.
Steve woke with a start and groaned as a sear of pain flashed along his temples and around to the back of his skull. He could feel liquid crusted on his forehead as he furrowed his brow, squinting so he could make out some of his environment through the white blaring into his eyes.
Tony calculated that his level of fucked was moderate to severe and that it was going to be a painful next few hours… or days… maybe weeks. His breathing quickened and his lips felt cold as ice as he sucked air in between them. The genius closed his eyes and worked through the mindfulness techniques that the therapist Pepper set him up with had talked him through. He liked to give the guy a hard way to go, but really the techniques
The mechanic had been drugged ever since their rescue. It had been two weeks and today was the day. Today was the day Tony would wake up.
Eventually the beach lit up bright enough that he was able to make out shadows of bodies littering the shore. They had started to give off a smell, so Steve began breathing through his mouth. The bodies were bloated and pale. There were men and women. Steve spotted a pair of thin white legs sticking out from beneath a poodle skirt and felt a pain in his heart- as soon as he found Tony and made sure he was safe, he would lay the bodies to rest.
Steve kept a passive and uncritical face the whole time, nodding and tilting his head when required. When Tony finally finished, he was out of breath and his whole body was shaking.
“I found a first aid kid... it was full of water, so I am not sure how sterile it is. But we can try. There are butterfly sutures in it, some triple antibiotic ointment and some pain killers. Here, take them.” He handed Tony a small packet of Tylenol.
The bartender dropped the glass in his hand with a clatter and quickly pulled up both shirt cuffs to reveal bare skin. He was shaking uncontrollably.
The disguise for Antoine was simple. Tony had asked his biochemist friend to loan him some of his hair growth serum and then applied it onto the jawline of his face. Initially his whole beard, goatee and all, had grown at the same rate and he had looked ridiculous: black, grey and brown hairs all different lengths along his chin. Once it was trimmed up to the same length all over, Tony thought he looked good.
Again, and again he called out, voice barely above a hoarse whisper. He couldn’t generate any more force, despite squeezing his eyes in determination. His breathing quickened at the lack of response, chest moving up and down rapidly and eyes shooting open wide in fear.
“I know it only happens once in a blue moon, but when you undermine my plans in front of the rest of the crew, I look like a fat-head.” Steve said flatly, glaring at his two friends. He noticed some hidden emotion in Nat’s face and lingered on her eyes for a second longer than normal, trying to analyze her inner thoughts and failing.
Frustrated, Steve walked to Tony, slipped an arm around his waist and began guiding him to the elevator so they could retire to their suite.
“I’m not really sure… but it probably wouldn’t hurt and may even ease your nerves! I’ll stay the night on the couch to keep you company with J gone and then in the morning we’ll pretend to be Catholic and enlist some help. For now, let’s make some food.”
“Let’s use my shirt to cover both of us…you need it more than I do. This sweat is going to put you straight into hypothermia. C’mere.” He pulled Tony’s form in close to him and pulled the large garment over their chests.
The sun was setting again and were it not for the large fire burning before him, Tony would’ve felt the cold settling into his bones. Instead he felt unease and anxiety worming its way through his skeleton.
“Oh no worries! I’ve thought that since the day I met you!” Steve slapped Tony firmly in between his shoulder blades and guided him through the glass doors and up the stairs.
His head swirled with images of home. Pepper. Rhodey. Steve. He knew they were just dreams within a feverish mind, but they sparked horror in him nevertheless. Images of all of them on a small boat, washing overboard, and then drowning flooded his mind. He was the only survivor and as he waded in a never-ending ocean, he called out to each of them. Trying to find them. Trying to save them. Failing.
“Friday, to ease Captain Roger’s nerves, please scan the bunker and send him the results.” Tony felt a pang of guilt for not listening to Steve, but it ceased as soon as he walked far enough into the fortification to not be able to see the doorway behind him.
Tony couldn’t help it anymore. Tears sprang to his eyes and rolled along his cheeks and onto the back of his head. He tried to hide them, tried to think of something funny to quell them… anything to not show weakness, but Hammer saw. Hammer saw and he looked even more maliciously into Tony’s bright blue eyes, rubbing himself faster, head hitting the low of Tony’s back against the two dimples above his ass.
The bandages on Tony’s stomach would become soaked with blood quickly and a nurse would pull them off and reapply. One of them set up a blood transfusion next to his cot and Tony whimpered about poison in his blood. The whole scene tore Steve apart at the seams.
After a few minutes, he remembered that he shouldn’t be alone. Steve should be here. But, Steve was nowhere to be seen and Tony felt fear spike into his chest as his heart began thrumming faster with anxiety.
“It’s nothing tangible that I am after Cap…Just good old-fashioned revenge and potentially murder if it gets to that.” He struck Tony again, causing Tony to jerk his mouth open in a silent scream. “Kidney bruises hurt, huh pal?”
Steve dove forward towards Tony protectively, raising his shield to block any falling debris, but he was struck by a large metal post swinging from the rafters. Steve rolled to his side with a muffled cry. He remained still.
“There are three breaks… one on the radius and two on the ulna. Fortunately it seems like they are clean breaks, Tony. This isn’t going to feel good though…”
Steve pushed himself up, grabbed the piece of cloth, and turned it back into his bag, angrily shoving the coconuts into the satchel.
Steve and Tony had been missing from the scene, disappearing as soon as the gas had dissipated, but SHIELD had barely noticed as countless citizens had also been affected with the neuro-gas. Several nearby educational establishments and some of the skyscrapers not destroyed by the giant robots had become make-shift hospitals that were dismal, under staffed, and providing nothing but cots for the coma patients to lay and fluid sacks to keep them hydrated and fed.
His arm was stretched out beside him, splinted. Beneath the splints, his skin was visible, red and inflamed and angry. Tony moved his head to face forward, grimacing at the sight of his arm. If he had any, he would have shed tears at the pain that he now noticed was coursing through his numb forearm and shoulder.
“I’m okay… I’m just worried is all.” Steve knew it was hard for Tony to admit any feelings that might affect his pride, so he squeezed at the shorter man’s bicep gingerly.
Steve, by this point in time, was stifling laughter at JARVIS’s attempt at classical conditioning. He looked at Tony’s weathered, tinkerer’s hand before sinking his larger warm one into it, fingers clasping as he pulled himself up from his couch. He felt tingles along his fingertips as their palms connected.
Tony’s whole body was shaking uncontrollably. This was half due to the adrenaline that flowed through his body and half due to the dropping temperature in the bunker. Steve estimated that is was below 30 Fahrenheit and was only to get colder as night arrived. He gently lifted the mechanic’s head and pulled his shirt from its makeshift pillow form, billowing it out to cover Tony’s legs and torso.
Kang had a diverse set of people working for him. Some were aliens. Some humanoid. Some aliens but appearing humanoid. They were masters of disguises and with Kang himself as an intellectual mastermind, his minions often had genius level intellect as well, an attribute that most of the earth’s villains did not possess. It may be a challenge to find the group of Kang’s cohorts, but if there were any good place to start, it would be the place with a conglomeration of alcohol, smoking, and gambling.
Tony smiled contentedly and looked down at his hands a moment, thankful for the super soldier. He glanced up, wanting to look into Steve’s comforting blue eyes but instead his gaze was drawn over the man’s left shoulder.
He was vaguely aware of people shifting rocks carefully around them, trying to ensure their survival, but Steve stared at Tony continually, worry etched on his cold features. If Steve could cry, he would have. But the dehydration had gotten to him and he had no fluid left to give.
At that moment a shrill scream echoed into the room.  It sounded several rooms away and Steve recognized it instantly. His blood turned to ice and he swallowed deeply.
Steve’s eyes and mouth widened in surprise at the physical contact. He barely stumbled backwards from Tony’s push. Tony pushing him was like a child pushing a full-sized SUV; it didn’t produce very much movement.
He had thought about sharing the fabric and clothing with Steve, but couldn’t make Steve’s size for multiple articles of clothing in a matter of hours.
The minions, suddenly unconcerned about what they were supposed to be doing and more about what was going on with the boat, looked at Steve momentarily, nodded to each other, and then ran out of the room, slamming shut the door behind them. Fortunately, Steve didn’t hear the snap of it being locked.
He had fish stored, wrapped in fronds and salt, in a hole in the ground, the deeper sand keeping the flesh cool and fresh. There were coconuts stacked in piles randomly throughout the encampment for water and nourishment, although Steve often had a hard time opening them, despite the strength with which he bashed them against Billie.
The body was suffering from a severe case of water bloat that was worsened by the extreme temperature. Tony just noticed the sun beating down on him as sweat beaded and slipped along his forehead. He was no doctor, but he knew enough to estimate the time for absorption of water through the tissues of the skin. The body had been in the water at least 3 hours and who knows how long since it had washed up on shore.
“Should I go help him?” Tony felt a little guilty for his laziness the last few weeks but was also secretly enjoying watching the super soldier work.
“Now, now, now Captain… Don’t take it the wrong way… I just… I-uhm,” Justin sputtered and then stood angrily, fear making him try to intimidate Steve instead of pleading with him. Steve was between him and the door, blocking the quick exit he tried to make after his ascension from the floor.
He felt himself floating before realizing that Steve was carrying him to another spot where the log wasn’t shattered behind him.
Throughout the whole medical process, they had remained clasping hands and no one would remove one for the other. Steve was warmed up slowly and his wounds were stitched up or butterfly bandaged. Tony… was another story altogether. Steve had tried his best to set his arm, but it was set incorrectly, so they had to re-break and then re-set. Fortunately, Tony had been unconscious the whole time… nothing like it was when Steve had to fix his arm in the bunker.
Steve stared at the smaller man for a moment while planning his next course of action. He needed paper and a pen to develop a plan, but all his stuff was lost in the shipwreck and probably at the bottom of the ocean. So, he decided upon the next best thing.
“Alright.” Simply put and followed by quick movements that Steve couldn’t quite make out, but it looked as if Justin took a mallet and blunt-edged tool and used it almost like a chisel into Tony’s jaw. Tony groaned and Steve saw his eyes snap open as soon as his jaw muscle was struck.
The bartender, Alphonse, came by to grab the empty glasses and offer another drink to Steve. Alphonse was tanned from his time by the pool and had dark, shoulder length hair and a shadowy beard. His red shorts were bound by a black belt that was attached to a fanny pack. He looked mildly irritated at the two men before him, but Tony attributed it to the number of dishes they were racking up.
“I also found these sticks that should function as a splint, and I made some straps out of clothing.”
The man cheated and brought out a gun with electrified tips, slamming the gun into Steve’s ribs and holding it there as the soldier spasmed with the currents that shot through his muscles and nerves.
He yelled over the roar of the water for Tony to swim. They began kicking, rising with the water, towards the window. 8 feet away. 7 feet. 3 feet.
Steve thought for a second and it made sense. He flattened his mouth, obviously embarrassed, and pressed the fourth button again, the bookshelf sliding back into place over the sex toy shelving units.
Cracks shot up through the walls, black, jagged lines breaking through the concrete and sending metal bars and rock falling towards them.
“Tony,” a voice said calmly. Tony felt a stirring in his brain but was too tired, too relaxed, to respond.
Steve shifted Tony into his arms and began to carry him bridal style. He looked at the dirtied motorcycle and at his boyfriend, sweaty, covered in cum, and whimpering in pleasure as Steve picked him up.
Gradually the ocean waves began to pull at the sand mounds covering the deteriorating bodies in the ground and the whole island began to stink of rotting flesh as shredded limbs poked out from the soil. Tony stared from his spot by Billie, through the doorway of their make-shift residence, and at Steve, who, in attempt to rid the smell, began to re-bury the pieces.
“Pull ‘em out, Steve.” Tony hacked out and thought he felt Steve chuckle a little before setting him down.
Steve looked at Tony shivering and blinked steadily, deciding how he wanted to proceed. He stood up, walking over to another area and rummaging around through a luggage bag. He pulled out a large blue blanket and laid it gently over Tony’s wracking form. He carefully, settled the blanket around the wounded arm and then began tucking in the side under Tony’s body. The blanket was still a little damp, but Tony’s feverish body heat would radiate, keeping the man warm.
Tony took Steve’s outstretched hand and nervously glanced at the ground, “alright, but you are going to think I am insane.”
The super soldier inspected his throbbing palms and found them to be bloody, slits of skin on each former callus. He turned towards Tony to commiserate and his worry spiked drastically.
Clint, silent and bleary eyed during this whole conversation, perked up at Steve’s latest comment. “I volunteer as tribute.” He offered, raising his steaming coffee mug to further cement his eagerness.
“Son of a bitch is right, you stupid fuck.” Another slap across the other side of his face. “Just because the gun isn’t to your fucking temple, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.”
Steve, drawn in the moment, forgot to speak. Forgot everything except that moment on the boat where he missed out on kissing Tony and subsequently almost lost him forever. He licked his lips and as he moved his face slowly, testing the limits, towards Tony’s, he closed his eyes. His lips connected with Tony’s cheek.
Steve’s gaze followed her out and then resettled on Tony’s facial features. Startlingly, one eye popped open, followed by the other.
real. Fat chance with the way he felt, unless he was in hell. After a few seconds his vision focused, and he was able to discern the outline of his gauntlet as well as a pair of concerned blue eyes.
“It-it’s-ve-very-c-c-cold.” Steve’s teeth chattered, and he removed his hands from laying limply at Tony’s sides to wrap around his chest awkwardly.
“Why do you think Steve had us air-lift him and his motorcycle to Meadows Point?” Her head was quirked to the side.
“Yeah, well, we aren’t out of it yet, now are we?” The latter was said with mild irritation as the brain behind the comment was trying to formulate a plan.
Steve glanced at Tony beside him, the other man smiling as people jumped up to announce their winnings. There was an air of wonder and childlike happiness in him that was endearing. Pulling Tony along, they made it to the bar at the end of the casino. Steve decided that this was the best place to investigate their fellow cruise members and maybe get information from them if they were inebriated.
While he pulled up the soft linen to cover the still clothed form, Steve removed Tony’s sunglasses delicately, only to find open blue eyes staring at him, crow’s feet crinkling in a slight smile.
“Old man hipster,” was his initial thought after he saw himself in the mirror. “Eh… I can pull it off better than any hipster I know.” Fair, since Tony didn’t really associate with many hipsters.
leave my side…” The man seethed at her, oblivious to Tony and Steve standing there, fists clenching.
Finally, when he threw open the last door before the lighting ended, he found Tony. The man was underneath a heavy table, struggling to push it off of himself with one arm. The other arm was slung against Tony’s chest. He was bloody and sweat was matted to him. He still donned the same black pants and buttery leather shoes that Steve had admired mere hours before.
Groggy or not, Tony’s eyes shot open as something wormed its way to his entrance and, like a piston, thrust into him causing splitting pain to course through his core. Tony couldn’t breathe. His cavern tightened as he grimaced, unable to speak or think.
“Tony… you are in pretty bad shape. I can’t move you… but we need to do something about these wounds.”
Something began stirring in the bushes to his left, and Tony found his head stiffly turning to see what it was, but not really caring.
The Iron Man propulsers zoomed over Steve’s head. He raised his shield against the bullets that began peppering him as he pushed his way forward through the battlefield. Trying to match Tony’s wit with his own was a lost cause and frustration began seeping through the Captain’s voice.
“Tony, I am going to have to set your arm… god… I am so sorry.” Steve prayed for Tony to remain unconscious as he began his work. No such luck.
Steve had bitterly shaved his head this morning after their team gathering. With his golden blonde locks shaved down to his scalp, he felt very unlike himself and kept rubbing his hand along the smoothness that was the crown of his head.
It was soon after that he had felt his body drop to the black tar, metal screeching against the rough surface; Iron Man would definitely need a buffing and paint job after this. The last thing he saw was Cap trying to push himself up but failing and subsequently falling into a blue and red mass among a sea of black.
Steve got him home as promised, but the latter was yet to be seen. He had rushed into the SHIELD headquarters carrying Tony’s blanket-wrapped, limp body in his arms, vial of anti-toxin in Tony’s lap, and demanded a doctor. Several of the SHIELD techs had tried to calm him, but Steve, unknowing of the current toxin situation, had argued and begun to yell, stress and worry evident in his temperament.
At that, Tony’s eyes widened a little, sparkling. A smile twitched at his lips and he began looking boyish. At least he was before Steve suddenly wrenched back, dragging his arm with him. The mechanic’s arm stretched and, there it was again, the blinding pain that made him double over in stupor.
” Steve cried out again as the gun rammed back into him, this time lasting for a solid 30 seconds before releasing. Tony could see Steve’s muscles spasming.
As soon as they were out of the room, Steve put his escape plan into effect. As the next lurch was impending towards his right, Steve positioned himself on the left. He hissed with the pain in his chest. When the boat rocked right, he threw himself with it, the force of his throw and the boat’s changing velocity snapping the pipes that his chains were attached to overhead.
Tony stumbled and stared defiantly before responding “Uhm. Duh. I’m pretty fucking fantastic.” He marched over to the mini-bar, grabbing a shot-sized bottle of whiskey before Steve rushed over and yanked it from his hand.
There was an ear-splitting crack that emanated into his room and vibrated the metal floor viciously. The ceiling was now the floor and the floor was now the ceiling and Steve was pretty sure that something had just broken off of the ship. Most likely the other half of the ship.
“I told you Stark. Nothing will beat this bike. No fancy new-fangled car is going to beat the finesse and speed of a motorcycle.” Steve’s blonde hair glistened with his hair gel, the scent of which wafted to Tony’s nose. Would’ve smelled good, maybe even been a turn on, had Tony not been utterly pissed right now.
Once Steve had pulled the restraint free, Tony’s body collapsed lopsidedly causing him to scream; this was the first time his shoulder had been released from an upwards position in almost a week. Steve tried to ignore the tears seeping from the corners of Tony’s eyes as he grabbed the chain binding the left side and released it from its hold as easily as the first one.
Before dinner even arrived, Tony and Steve were snickering to one another, almost mad-libbing the stories as they went along. For a moment as they stared at one another, crow’s feet wrinkled in happiness, it felt to Steve like they were actually more than friends. Like the stories were real and they were reminiscing about their crazy lives together.
Says the man who has full capabilities in both of his arm-“ There was a snap and crack before blinding pain exploded up Tony’s bicep, radiating through his ribcage and into his core. It took him a moment, but as soon as it hit, he turned his head in a silent scream. Soon enough, yellow bile flooded into his mouth. The pain was too much for his body to comprehend.
“No, no…” Steve raised up and spit into his other hand before trailing his moist fingers along Tony’s chest, abdomen, and pubic bone. Softly he caressed the head of Tony’s penis, running his index finger along the slit. Tony, void of touch for so long, arched his back and moaned into his mouth.
Steve ignored him, placed his feet against the rock, and extended his legs slowly, raising it off of the mangled arm beneath it.
The men soon settled back into their reminiscing and enjoying themselves, several hours passing. The serum kept Steve from burning (or tanning) and Tony’s Italian heritage kept him mostly sunburn free, although his freckled cheek bones and tops of his shoulders were painted a light pink.
Steve sat on Tony’s left shoulder, mechanic’s arm between his crouched legs. He looked over his shoulder at the man. Tony was very obviously already in pain but was handling it. He had a large stick in between his teeth and gnawed down on it.
Steve glanced back at Tony and his face softened. He had just confessed his feelings to this man. This vulnerable, wounded man in front of him. Tony’s eyes were clenched shut and he moaned out Steve’s name. His black body suit was torn in several places, revealing soft, tanned skin and bloody gashes that lightly poured blood due to some sort of failed clotting factor or re-tearing of the skin. His black hair had lost its typical gel-induced shine and style, and was now in ringlets along his forehead, lightly dusted with debris, blood, and frost.
He stiffened his back, aligning his head perfectly to see if he could tell if Tony was still conscious. He was and Steve felt even guiltier. Tony’s face was pale and the soldier could tell that he was rushing into a state of shock.
“Look hammer, if it is tech you are wanting, we can arrange something for you, just stop!” Steve was restless again, feeling helpless as he watched. “The Avengers can bring you something… money… tech… whatever!”
“Oh god..” Steve could hear the thrum of Tony’s voice as his prostate was stimulated by the vibrating dildo inside of it. “Please… please Steve. Let me cum.”
Once he made it, he slowed down, walking briskly until his hand met the door handle and his key card was pressed to the locking device. He slowed down and glanced over his shoulder to see if anyone was following him. The coast was clear, so Steve swiped his card quickly and pushed the door open, face falling at the sight before him.
Steve stared blankly at Tony for a moment before tears flooded his crystalline eyes. Silently, he pressed his forehead against his lover’s and closed his eyes, breathing softly. His fingers wormed their way behind Tony’s neck and grasped firmly, but gently. Tears leaked from both of their eyes, staining the covers pulled up to Tony’s clavicle.
Tony grumbled in response, throwing his head backwards, accidentally slamming it on the rock behind him.
The gauze bandage was then removed to reveal flaming red skin with capillaries spidering from the bullet entry point. The nurses shook their heads (to Steve’s embarrassment and worry), cleaned the wound with a saline solution, and reapplied bandaging until further medical attention could be allocated to him.
to- why would you ever want to hurt them?” He was quiet, but Tony spoke clearly as if he was debating whether or not to bring it up and how exactly to broach the subject with Steve.
I am SO SORRY that this took so long. I will be updating regularly from here on out. Warning: this chapter is pretty uneventful, but has some humorous parts to it. Next chapter will have some surprises in store for our boys and more whump, ie. Steve trying to fix Tony.
were) left him, he blinked open his swollen eyes and was able to take in his surroundings and determine what level of fucked he was in.
Steve shot up, eyes flying open and sand spraying around him as he panicked and flung his hands and legs around.
Steve set the gauntlet down and gripped the bar tight, planting both of his feet firmly into the ground before using all of his strength to slowly lift the metal that pinned Tony. He lifted and heard Tony gasp out as the pressure released from on top of his throat. Steve’s ankle burned with the stress.
They used the coconut oil for everything. Tony had the idea for producing it and Steve had been the person executing the task of harvesting it. The coconut would be cracked open, flesh dried out, and then pounded with a rock to express the oil. It took quite a few coconuts but eventually they had a whole seashell full. They ate it, used it for flavoring, as soap and lotion, and as a salve for their sunburns.
Currently, Tony was in one of his fitful rests, head lolling from side to side and tears sliding down his cheeks.
“Must…get….out.” Tony ground out, throwing another rock over his shoulder. His eyes were half lidded, and Steve could tell it pained him with every movement. His arm was bright red, swollen, and covered in a thick layer of scarlet from the three wounds that the bone had punctured.
Tony furrowed his brow at the interruptions and then frowned as it dawned on him what was occurring.
The super soldier snapped his focus back to the bar. “First things first, shellhead. Do what you can and I’ll lift as long as I can.”
JARVIS tried again, British accent echoing in the halls. “Sir, maybe Captain Rogers can dissolve any mystery behind your latest obsession…”
Whereas Steve was dressed in mostly light colors, Tony decided to wear darker colors made of his newest sweat-slick technology; light-weight fabrics that caused the person wearing the articles to not sweat, even while wearing radiation-absorbent black.
Please comment or kudos if you liked it! Really helps with the whole motivation thing for the next chapter.
The two had planned to go to the dance studio on the top floor of the ship. It was apparently themed after a speakeasy but played oldies, modern music, and classic rock. Tony had warned Steve that he would probably be disappointed in the prohibition era bar, but Steve had claimed he had never had the chance to go to one before, and he wasn’t missing his opportunity now. Tony consented to going, but had been his normal grumpy, sarcastic self about it.
Steve could smell the liquor on Tony’s sweet, warm breath. He could feel Tony’s chest heave as he breathed.
He let out a happy sigh and couldn’t help but smile as he strolled up to a winding ramp that went to the main deck of the boat. Tony was following his footsteps, a soft expression on his face, as he watched Steve stop and admire the ship. He smiled right along with the larger man.
He realized that not only was the man’s arm metal, but also the leg that just laid into Steve’s cheekbone. Steve threw punches, but his knuckles met metal and crunched painfully when they struck. Between his rage and grief, Steve was outmatched for one of the first times since he had been enhanced.
Tony knew he probably sounded like an angry soccer mom, but he couldn’t help his yelling. It was still silent, and the silence was driving Tony even madder. He quieted, still banging his head back in an attempt to drown his anxiety.
Blinking, Steve looked the bed up and down, settling back into Tony’s ocean blue eyes and the soft lines on his face. He thought about their recent moment in the doorway and all of those times that they had argued, closing in on each other as the tension grew greater and Steve’s animosity turned into a subtle passion. He thought about sleeping next to Tony and immediately felt the palpitations in his gut again.
Over time, people began filtering onto the pool deck donned in bathing suits and carrying towels as the sun set lower in the sky. By this point in time, Steve was slap-happy and Tony was borderline intoxicated as glasses littered the area around them. They were locking pinkies between their pool chairs to ‘keep up the façade of their relationship’, or so Steve convinced himself.
“Thank you, hubby…” Steve smiled at Tony’s appreciation and hidden apology, patting the other man’s brown hair before turning to leave.
Tony audibly sighed and landed, metal clad feet thumping in the snow. Friday came over his speaker system, “Boss, your lasers should be strong enough to cut through that metal door, but I would wait-“
He felt a little hopeless, going back empty handed, but knew he could try to make something to catch evaporated water from, or wait until it rained again. At least he himself could wait, he thought… he wasn’t sure that Tony could make it much longer without water in his feverish state.
Ultimately, all three men were lying on the ground after Steve was through with them, his cover blown as one lady screamed out his superhero alter ego during the altercation.
The padding and ship materials prevented sounds from penetrating into the upper decks where cruise-goers could hear them. Thus, the bottom mechanical deck was a perfect spot for torture.
Red welts showed up on Tony’s back, stinging as they were exposed to the air. Justin pressed himself into Tony’s crack, shaft rubbing along the genius’s perineum as he folded his chest against Tony’s back. The villain bit at his shoulders, leaving wet spots as he sucked down Tony’s back.
Next, he grabbed another shirt off of a body and tore it so that it was square-shaped. He tied the corners and made a sort of knapsack that he could carry things in. He also inspected the shoes of several of the bodies and was able to find two, un-matching pairs of leather loafers in his size. He slid them on, checked on Tony one more time, and set off towards the middle of the forest.
drawing… nor how good he was at it. They had played a quick game of Tony spouting out items to draw and Steve quickly sketching them. The super soldier excelled at everything Tony threw at him, so as his final prompt, he asked Steve to draw him.
Eventually they bid each other adieu and went their separate ways, the husband and wife going one way and the fraudulent husbands going the other.
The waiter smiled awkwardly, congratulated them, and then proceeded to take their orders. Steve ordered enough food for six grown men while Tony ordered a glass of red wine (“
They needed to get out of here. Steve was sure that oxygen was at least flowing into the space, but without rescue and with only the gauntlet’s dim lighting, they could be trapped in here indefinitely. This was all not to mention the ever-present threat of the rock finally collapsing on top of them from weak support structure.
The fever made him tired and he lowered his head back against the tree trunk. He at least could stay awake though; obviously the coconut water helped.
“JARVIS??” Steve walked over to the windows and pulled back the sheers. His breath caught in his throat as he looked at the vast expanse of ocean before him. The water was comprised of dark blues and greens, some white foam, and a sparkling reflection of the sun’s rays sprawling over the horizon. The ocean was beautiful, even though he had seen it many times. Even though he had slept in one for 70 years.
” Steve smirked. While Tony tried to educate JARVIS about how the A.I. could bypass the security system (with JARVIS already knowing what he needed to do and already having tried all of Tony’s suggestions before Tony even thought of them), Steve made his way to the sliding doors.
A man stood in the doorway of the balcony exit, a large grin plastered on his face. He had a pig-like nose and scars that ran down the left side of his face and neck as if a large cat had gotten a hold of him. He wore a dark grey bodysuit with red lines running along the seams. His sneer turned his eyebrows downwards evilly.
Steve opened his eyes slowly and slid his body off of the man under him. He blinked the dust from his eyes.
“Justin is a god damn freak.” Tony blurted it out, breaking his silence. “He’s trying to fuck with me but he isn’t going to go through with this. He… he can’t.”
“Yeah yeah…” Steve sighed woefully. “I don’t know… let’s head to customer service and find out what’s going on. It could just be a coincidence. Both of our cards did it, so maybe there is just a problem with the ID’s attachment to our room or something. Or the financial account.”
Steve coughed and pulled his hand from the heavy thing firmly until it released. He heard a hiss of air as he did so and, confused, patted beside him to feel something soft and squishy. He blinked and rolled to his side until he was able to make out what was adjacent to him.
Tony had risen from his seated position, sliding the chair back noisily, and nodded, pressing his lips together.
The casino was smaller because it was on a ship, but still had the flash and pizzazz that one would in Vegas. Multicolored lights dashed and temporarily imprinted themselves on the Captain’s retinas. This room and the cigar lounge were the only two places that smoking was allowed, so there was a slight haze in the air along with people hacking, shouting, and laughing.
“Better take care of yourself Cap…I might not be making it out of this one.” With that Tony coughed and blood spattered the stone beneath him. “…. Correction…” he gurgled, “I am probably not making it out of this one.”
Hammer rubbed himself along Tony’s crack roughly, skin against skin friction causing Tony to cringe uncomfortably. Not that this whole situation was anywhere near his comfort level.
Afterward, Steve stood breathing heavily. Normally he wouldn’t break a sweat with this kind of activity, but without food and much water over the past two weeks, he was drained.
Hammer smiled sadistically as Tony’s cries sounded out in the background. Blood was pooling underneath him in the water and Steve could see several skin tears along his torso from the pressure of the jet stream.
Hammer began to shout, causing Tony’s dehydration headache to worsen. “GET IN HERE AND CLEAN HIM UP FOR ME!”
Tony lay face first on the ground, broken arm twisted under him and legs splayed out unceremoniously.
“You always told me it wasn’t so hard to be a genius like you…. To make tech like you…But now you are speechless… strange.”
A warm hand slid into Steve’s as he walked through the casino. Subconsciously, Steve gently squeezed the hand and put his other in his pants pocket.
Michael smiled and clapped a hand on Tony’s back, much to Tony’s disgust. As the abusive grease-monkey guided them back to the bar, the sleeve of his short sleeve shirt pulled up and revealed a similar, sword-shaped tattoo imprinted on his bicep.
The nurse came running back to the doctor’s side while wheeling in what Steve deduced from staff commentary, an electrocautery machine. The machine’s whirrs echoed throughout the room as it powered up.
He wasn’t really sure what to think. Steve felt a large sense of confusion relating to Tony and his pursuits. Surely Tony Stark was just playing the role of husband or just trying to be a good teammate (but making it awkward) and that the genius’s silence was due to stress or deep thought. Steve continued to discredit any feelings of hope that kept rising in the back of his throat.
The mechanic coughed and swiveled his chair around to face Steve. “I’ve got nothing to say, Rogers. JARVIS, power on. Please escort Captain Rogers out.” It was short, succinct, and to the point. JARVIS remained quiet.
“Calm down! It’s quicker if I just carry you all the way- CALM – TONY- MY GOD- BIG BABY-IT’S NOTHING I HAVEN’T SEEN BEFORE!!!” Steve’s words were broken as Tony flung around calling the super soldier a pervert.
him...and you will watch.” The man let go of his throat, throwing him to his side and into a hill of dirt. The pig-faced man took a wrinkled and soggy foot, placing it on Tony’s cheek before letting his weight fall to it. Tony could feel his skull cracking under the pressure and began to scream.
“Now that you are a little more subdued, let’s get this ball on the roll.” Justin snuck in between Tony and the wall so that the men were facing each other, Tony slightly lower as he was still on his knees. “Bite and you and Cap eat bullets.”
“Enjoying every second Bub.” Tony spat out and then jerked his rear into Hammer’s groin, causing the other man to jerk downwards and grab onto himself in pain.
The hospital room window was frosted over as a snow storm brewed outside, white dust collecting on the window pane and glass shaking with the force of the wind outside.
Steve was still staring at the back of Tony’s head, taking a second to admire the man’s dark brown coif. “It’s been weeks since I have seen you. You canceled our hang out last week with like, five minutes notice, and none of the others have seen you either… I think what I want, is to know what the hell is up with you man?” Steve reached out to put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but the other man shrugged him off in response.
The man let go and Tony’s form shot downwards, gravity pulling him towards his death. At the last minute, pig-face grabbed a hold of Tony’s pants leg, laughing haughtily at Steve’s distress as he yelled out.
The engine thrummed with life, methodical booming ringing out from the frame of the motorcycle. Tony cried out in immediate pleasure as the vibrations railed his core. As if he wasn’t overstimulated enough, Steve grabbed Tony’s cock and began to stroke it up and down, dry except for Tony’s pre cum which was leaking out of his slit in hoards.
Finally, once it was done, Tony spoke apathetically, “Most people will leave the ship to go explore the Nassau port. We should too to blend in… and I think we should try to follow that couple we met at the casino last night.”
“We can try to access the on-board internet in the computer center. It will irritate the shit out of me, due to how slow it will be, but it’s probably our best shot to at least let them know what is going on-“
The doctor nodded her head slowly and motioned for the nurses to begin preparing the comatose man for diagnostics. “We don’t have too much anesthetic leftover from the wounded… it will be rough.”
Steve set to work. He first examined the wounds, noting signs of a beginning infection. Next, he moved his fingers around them gently, palpating to see where the bones were broken. Tony groaned beside him, voice running through several different pitches before settling on a guttural moan.
I hope you all get a chance to see IW tonight or tomorrow; hopefully we all come out of it without too much emotional trauma.
“Ow…” Steve didn’t think he’d every be so excited to hear a small little ‘ow’ before in his life. His hand shot out behind the man’s head as he crouched beside him, cradling his neck.
“…yes, Tony…” he moved closer, eyes closing naturally. He felt his lips pucker and right as he moved to finally meet the man in front of him…
“Tony, I order you to stay back, you need to-“ Tony cut his comm off and rolled his eyes. Steve was always trying to get him to stay back when there was no need. The rest of the gang had the cronies outside and he could take on the inside villains with ease. The witnesses that had laid eyes on the base before had stated that there were only soldiers, light armor, and few weapons. So far, the battle had been easy and Tony had no doubts that the rest was just clean up.
Cautiously, Steve bent down and picked up a solid piece of driftwood, holding it in his hands as a weapon, and moved forward. He stepped over ship debris and bodies, walking closer.
“GOD DAMN IT BLESS FUCK DAMN!!” Tony shook his head, blinking his eyes rapidly until the tears cleared the granules out of his ducts.
“Should we lock arms or hold hands?” He questioned, and Tony silently slid his hand into Steve’s as they walked side by side. Steve, quickly feeling a blush spread across his cheeks, whispered softly, “Alrighty then…”
“Stop that right now Steven Rogers. Stop turning everything I say into slutty slurs.” Tony stomped a foot as Steve raised up to look Tony in the eyes.
“Look, we come up with a plan and then we go back to bed. Easy as that. It’s a simple reconnaissance mission and we need a team of two, for a couple of days, to take in as much intel as possible from the small Kang gang that we are targeting.” Cap smiled at himself, proud of his terminology for The Conqueror’s minions. “This is the only lead we have, so it is important that this be taken seriously, even if it is on a cruise ship…”
Steve planted a kiss on Tony’s forehead and held him close, trying to increase the warmth between them.
“Hello sirs, I am William and I will be your server for the remainder of the trip. With it being the first night, please allow me to thank you both for traveling with us. Is there a special occasion that you are celebrating with us?” The waiter was of middle eastern descent and was dressed the same as the other wait staff: black pants, white shirt, black tie, and a black napkin folded delicately over his right arm. He poured them ice waters from a crystal pitcher as he spoke.
Cold metal pressed against his forehead as he heard the click of Justin pulling back a pistol hammer to hold to his earlier threat about biting. Tony gagged, deprived of oxygen as Hammer left his member down his throat for several seconds. Spit drizzled down the corners of his mouth mixed with the blood from what he was sure was intestinal bleeding. His eyes began to burn as uncontrolled tears washed down the fronts of his cheeks. He wanted to bite down, but heard Cap’s muffled cries and held strong, taking the dick like his life depending on it… it did, really. His
Steve cut that thought off immediately and walked through the threshold of the circle. Behind him, as a makeshift door, he set down a large hunk of metal, digging it into the sand to keep it stationary.
Navigating through the levels of the ship to ultimately reach the pool deck was relatively easy for the two tacticians. It was in the center of the second to the top deck, enclosed and surrounded by balconies above. The pool was silent, save for a few people sitting on reclining pool chairs and the few staff that remained tending to them. There was a palm tree fountain, two wading pools, one large pool, and two hot tubs cattycorner to the wading pools. A bar sat on the starboard side of the bow and a lone bartender managed it.
He continued, “Know you two were friends. He always talked about you. I admired Dad, wanted to be like him and so when he talked about how much he liked you, I liked you too. It wasn’t until high school that I grew jealous of his love for you- I started resented you.” Steve let his head fall down, not knowing how to respond.
Tony looked a little concerned, but in true Captain America and Iron Man manner, he didn’t question Steve about his sudden change in demeanor. There was now an awkward silence, but thankfully William showed up with a tray of their food soon after the change.
