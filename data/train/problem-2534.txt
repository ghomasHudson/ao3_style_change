Dean’s mouth fell open in shock, giving Castiel the opportunity to lean in and kiss him deeply, possessively plundering Dean’s mouth with his tongue. The angel’s lips, his breath, seemed to crackle with electricity, some kind of holy energy that emanated from his very being. Dean was too shocked to do anything but kiss back. He let out an involuntary moan and his eyes fluttered closed as the angel made all the fight in him fly away.
, Cas. I’ve wanted to say it for so long but I was too...I didn’t think you could feel...I mean, if you’re saying you love me like how I
Castiel tossed Dean’s boots over his shoulder without a care, and his sock quickly followed suit. Then he unbuckled Dean’s belt with ease, and peeled the jeans and underwear down his legs. Castiel smirked at Dean’s cock. “What have we here?” he said.
“I have lived for an eternity, have watched the first sunrise, the first butterfly unfurl its new wings for the first time, every nebula and galaxy in the cosmos, and they all pale in comparison to you, Dean. Your soul permeates your mortal flesh and reflects the beauty within. You truly are God’s greatest masterpiece.”
“Peppermint, yeah,” said Dean, actually smiling. He had a lovely smile. “Instead of using a spoon to mix the hot chocolate mix in, I use a candy cane so the candy melts and mixes in with it.”
The dishes were quickly abandoned in favor of making out, Dean hoisting Cas up to sit on the counter as they kissed. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, pulling their bodies as close as possible.
Castiel screamed, and without even thinking about it, darting into the street to shove Dean out of the vehicle’s path. Dean went skidding away from the danger. Castiel threw his arms up in front of his face just as the bus plowed into him. He went flying backward, landing flat on his back on the blacktop, and just before everything went black...
Dean bit his lip. Then he looked at Chuck. “What song did my mom sing to me when I was young?” he asked quietly. “Before she died.”
But the impetuous duo were already off. Sam groaned in frustration as he and Jack hurried after them.
“Oh, yes sir, absolutely,” said Naomi in that tone of voice that every middle manager takes on when they don’t really agree with their boss but they’re hoping their troubles will get them a boost on the corporate ladder.
Dean returned with a glass of water. “Here, drink this. Sorry, not really sure what to do. Never had someone faint on me before.”
“Gabriel is the man who raised me,” Castiel replied. “He took me in when my parents died and my twin brother was adopted. I’ve lived with him my whole life.”
Castiel worked in two, then three, scissoring inside him and get him all slick and ready for him. Finally Dean begged Cas, “come on, man, I’m ready, get in me already.”
He didn’t know it, but leaving his hair fluffed up and slightly sleep-tousled as it was now was much more flattering on him than his usual corporate comb over.
Sam cleared his throat and looked over a large compendium of potions, elixirs, and brews open in front of him. “Okay, what about Essence of Venus? Described as ‘translucent, white with pink overtones-’”
After Sam was gone, Cas rolled the pebble around in the palm of his hand. He held it up to the light to inspect. It was quite beautiful for such a small, simple object.
“My mother died giving birth to me and my father abandoned me with my aunt when I was a baby, so no.”
. “Dean, please!” he cried desperately, not even sure what he was begging for. Dean was giving him everything he’d ever dreamed of and more.
“I file my report with the IRS office. Then they decide what action to take next. They may ask me to perform a follow-up audit, if they think I’ve missed anything, but beyond that, I really can’t say.” Castiel smiled weakly. “For the record, I doubt you’ll have to serve jail time. If it comes to a court case, I’d have a good lawyer in my pocket if I were you.”
Dean instinctively drew his robe closed, despite being perfectly decent underneath. “Um...thanks for breakfast. I feel like I should cook something for you, but you don’t eat.”
After dessert, Claire and Jack headed off to their rooms, big smiles on their faces. Dean helped Cas clear the table and wash the dishes.
”Damn, they’re really good for teenagers!” Dean shouted over the music and the cheering audience, which was small yet vocal, and nodded his head along. “How’d you discover these guys?”
“No, my last class just ended. Are you crying? Are you okay? Did you find your dad? What did he say-?”
“After Sammy went to Hell, you and me tried the domestic thing for a few months, before we got pulled back into the game. Me with Sam coming back, you with the angel civil war. Things got scary. The whole you-trying-to-be-God thing...I was so scared I’d lost you for good. You looked straight at me and...it was like I was just some little bug to you, instead of your husband. Oh, but the things you promised me, Cas.” Dean closed his eyes. “You said I could rule the Earth if I wanted. You’d make me immortal, you’d bring back anyone I asked...you said you would give me everything. I told you all I wanted was to have my husband back.
Happy Pride Month, everyone! Oh FYI, pretty much the first three fourths of this chapter is porn lol.
Castiel eased Dean open with careful, teasing fingers, edging his sweet spot but never rubbing quite where Dean wanted him to. Dean whined, trying to grind back on the three digits buried to the knuckle inside. “Please,” he groaned.
ready,” Dean said softly. “‘Cause I’m not planning on lettin’ you go anytime soon. You better live a long and happy life with me or I’ll kick
”Yeah. I usually hate it when people try to give me nicknames. You have no idea how many times people have called me ‘Cassie.’” Cas made a face. “But I don’t mind when you do it.”
“The narrator said plenty.” Castiel then went onto describe his Saturday and the dismal goings-on both during his stint at the garage and afterward.
Dean couldn’t deny, he and Cas looked damn good together. But instead of admitting it, he said, “When this wears off, you’re gonna be embarrassed when you see that. And
“Actually...I had the weirdest dream. I can’t quite remember it. I remember...Italian food...and soap bubbles?”
how he was embarrassing himself in front of the first person he’d been attracted to in ages. He began to wonder if he was a failure in life, if there was something he should be doing instead besides bureaucratic grunt work for the rest of his life. Maybe he was letting what precious time he had in this life pass him by-
“No, I actually prefer the shower. I find the water relaxing.” Cas looked at Dean enticingly. “Care to join me?” he murmured as Sam wandered across the room to put the book away.
Cas felt his heart sinking, but smiled back nevertheless. “Tell me about...us. Our life,” he entreated quietly.
“Yeah.” Dean squeezed Cas’s shoulder. “Stop Chuck. Save the world. And then...you and me are going on a long vacation,
Dean then gave Cas another one of those mind-alternating kisses, this time gently coaxing Cas to part his lips for his tongue. They made out hard and sloppy, and Castiel suddenly felt Dean cup his bulge and he squeaked.
“It was worth it, Castiel. But nevertheless, I should’ve told you years ago about your origins. You have human family, a twin brother named James Novak, who’s a tax accountant, and he has a wife named Amelia and a daughter named Claire. And also...you have a soulmate.”
Inias looked them over. “This one’s a mechanic with his own independently owned shop...and this one is an investment banker...” Inias looked at the very thick file on the banker, then the ridiculously thin file by comparison on the mechanic. He sighed and handed over the easier case to Castiel. “I think you should take this one,” he said kindly.
He pulled a dumbfounded Dean into a tight embrace and used his newly returned wings to fly them both out of there, disappearing just as the Empty reached out its inky black tendril, just as Billie swung her scythe, leaving them to deal with each other.
Cas was hungry as a horse, having slept through breakfast and well into lunch, and ate the whole stack, and asked for seconds. Dean laughed and joked about Cas having a hollow leg.
Winchester sighed, nodding. “I get it, man. Gotta pay the landlord. Hey, from one working class grunt to another, I’ll make it as easy on you as possible, okay? Lucky for you, I keep excellent records.”
Sam thought for a second, then said, “I suppose...maybe I would bring Jess back. Or Eileen. I still miss them. And I wonder if they’d lived...if they’d be happy. If they’d gotten to have their own lives. Not even necessarily with me, but just...alive, and free.”
“Well, you’ll stay with us. There’s a pair of twin beds upstairs in the loft for guests; Dean sleeps in one, you can take the other.”
...” And suddenly Castiel felt strong arms wrapping around him, as Winchester gave him a warm, gentle embrace. “Sorry, I know I shoulda asked first, but you looked like you seriously needed a hug,” the mechanic murmured in his ear.
“Here,” said Becky, coming forward with a legal pad, full of unintelligible scribbles. She handed them to Charlie, who scrutinized them. As she read down the page, her eyes changed from hard and focused, to wide and somber. “Oh,” she said softly.
Dean coughed out a nervous laugh, even though the pretty words made him feel even more aroused. “Bet you say that to all the boys,” he joked.
Cas stepped away, panting. “No. Don’t...wanna finish yet,” he said breathily, and Dean saw that when he was close to coming, there was a blush on his chest as well as his face and ears. Huh.
“Don’t tell anyone you heard it from me,” Michael was saying, “but Santa is getting ready to retire after this Christmas, and I am
“Trust me, you shouldn’t be. You kinda made my night. It’s not all the time a really cute tax accountant tells you he thinks you hung the moon.”
Chuck was strewn out in his well worn armchair that Dean and Cas had carried him to at Becky’s behest, limp legs spread apart, wearing nothing but a t-shirt and boxers under his robe. Dean made a face. “Aw, dude, I can see his bait n’ tackle.”
of Castiel’s bedside alarm stirred the dark-haired man from his sleep. He reached over and pressed the off button, then sat up, swinging his legs over his bed to slide his feet into his slippers. This was Castiel’s routine, every weekday morning, without variance in the slightest. Everything went like clockwork.
Uh oh I better go, Dean says he’s going to kill Sam for sending everyone the picture. I have to claim responsibility.
“Oh, Castiel.” Joshua shook his head. “You aren’t the first person to catch a case of the old ‘cubicle fever.’ It’s nothing to be ashamed of, even if it’s making you hear voices.”
Castiel sighed, happy butterflies dancing in his stomach. He looked around the room, drinking in all the wonderfully little Dean-esque touches, when he spotted something hidden partially behind a chair.
“Nah, all that was in there was some ratchets and socket wrenches, and maybe a few loose lugnuts. It’s all good.”
Finally, Dean begged in a broken voice,  “T-too...much,” causing Cas to gasp and pull his hand away. Dean slumped against the bed, panting. “Holy...
The thing looked down casually at the knife handle now protruding from his chest, then back up at Dean, almost in amusement. He wrapped his fingers around the handle and slowly pulled it from his chest, never breaking eye contact, and dropped the knife on the ground, the clattering sound echoing around the barn’s metal walls.
Cas shrugged with his arms crossed like it was the most natural thing in the world. “I kissed Dean. I love him—why hide it? He certainly didn’t complain about it.” The angel smirked at Dean, who spluttered in mortification.
“Gabriel, what in the Christmas have you done?!” exclaimed Santa when he arrived with that gurgling mass of blankets in his arms. She looked mad enough to have kittens.
Castiel smiled, knowing that he wouldn’t live to meet Dean’s loved ones. “Sure,” he said. “I’d love to meet them.”
“We were adopted into separate homes, it’s unlikely he knows I exist. I didn’t know myself until a short time ago.” Castiel dug out his wallet with his new ID inside of it and showed it to her.
Dean flipped on the lights and led Cas over to the bed, sitting them both down. He seemed...tense. Dean took a deep breath and pulled his shirt off. There were those gorgeous muscles Cas had so admired the first time they met. He was practically salivating.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Dude. What kind of mentor would I be if I let you just throw away true love? Besides, you owe Dean the full story.”
“But you are welcome here anytime, Castiel,” Amelia said. “You’re the only family James has besides Claire and me, now that his adoptive parents are gone. Please say you’ll come back.”
“A potential bard. Interesting.” Charlie made a note on her legal pad. “Okay...do your parents have a room they’ve never let you enter, like an attic or a storm cellar?”
Lunch time rolled around and Castiel ate his peanut butter and jelly sandwich he’d brought from home. He idly looked through the office window and saw Dean eating a large meatball sub and chatting with a very tall, handsome man with long brown hair. Dean punched him on the arm in a friendly fashion and said something that made the man laugh. They seemed close.
Dean could still feel the sensations against his own skin, but his bones and muscles moved of their own accord, or rather, by Cas’s will, as the angel took control. Cas ran Dean’s thumb over his lips, rubbing gently.
Dean did in fact, keep very organized records. It was a relief, really. Most audits went about like swimming through peanut butter. Assessing Dean’s finances was more or less like swimming through...well, not water. No audit could be that easy. Cooking oil, maybe. Or strawberry yogurt.
“Oh, that’s nothing compared to Gabriel,” Castiel said as he helped set the table. “He knows every language that’s ever been spoken or written.” Angels, of course, knew every language, due to their having been around since the dawn of creation, but Castiel had been a very apt pupil as a young human.
“I will,” said Charlie, taking the envelope and smiling. “Thanks, Chuck. I, uh...I was totally addicted to your other books in high school, by the way. Even though I always hated the endings.”
There was another beat of silence. “W-why not?” Dean asked a small voice. “Did I...do something wrong?”
Dean chuckled, blushing slightly. “You better not go dyin’ on me anytime soon, dork,” he murmured affectionately, as he leaned forward and
Charlie squeezed Castiel’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry, dude. I had it all wrong. You’re not in control of your fate at all.”
Dean stared breathlessly at the brick wall where the chasm had disappeared. The room was deathly quiet.
“No, no, not at all! I’m still very attracted to you. Although...I’m inexperienced in having...vaginal sex. Truth be told...I haven’t had sex with a lot of partners at all. I don’t let myself get that close to too many people. I may not be very good,” Castiel said, curling in on himself.
“What, didn’t Billie fill you up enough when you ate her? Now you gotta come after Cas for dessert? Well, too bad.
Rowena sighed, looking up from the eyepiece. “Well, the good news is, I know exactly what this is. And its effects are temporary.”
“15 years ago, my late wife, God rest her soul, was expecting a baby. We were so happy. We even had a name picked out: Castiel. We thought since our son was a gift from God, we should him give a Biblical name. We chose one of the more obscure angel names, Cassiel, but modified it a little. We liked the sound of Castiel.
Charlie Bradbury was currently ringing the doorbell of the small rundown residence of Charles Shurley. After a minute, the door was opened not by the plucky young Becky but by the man himself, looking significantly better than he had before—he was wearing actual clothes, for a start, and his face didn’t have that gaunt pallor to it, and the rings under his eyes were less severe.
Jack leaned across the table to show Cas a bandage on his arm. There were also some minor cuts and scrapes on his faces that had already begun to scab over. “The werewolf tossed me through a window, Dad. It was like flying!”
“But you didn’t write it down yet, did you?” Charlie said, looking at Chuck’s typewriter. “I mean, that’s the rule, right? It’s not a part of the story yet if you don’t write it down.”
After several minutes of embarrassingly loud slurping and sucking noises, Castiel tugged Dean off of him. “I don’t wish to orgasm yet,” the angel said, stroking Dean’s cheekbone with his thumbnail, scraping him just a little. “However tempted I am to spill down your throat or find my release on your lovely face, I intend to claim you properly.”
Still basking in the afterglow, they crawled onto the bed and got under the covers, clinging to each other’s (well, their own) sweaty bodies desperately. Dean kissed Cas on the forehead. “Damn kinky angel,” he mumbled, drawing a giggle from Cas. It was definitely a Cas giggle. Dean
“Rowena sent that to me too. Apparently she was recording your conversation in here yesterday. She said she thought we should have a record of Unfiltered Cas for posterity and definitely not for humiliating Dean. Her words, not mine.”
“Ah, no, sweetheart. Under my roof you let me hear all those pretty sounds.” Dean pulled Cas’s underwear down and licked the sensitive underside of his cock.
Now babies often get adopted so quickly, so it was strange when only one, James, was taken immediately and the other wasn’t. As the days to Christmas Eve grew nearer and nearer, the angel Gabriel became more and more worried for the leftover baby, knowing he’d have to report back to the North Pole soon to get assigned to his new family. But he still felt obligated to his current charge.
all day long, but then a big construction machine came crashing through my wall and totally destroyed my place and now I have nowhere to
“What you’re describing is known as Dissociative Identity Disorder,” said Dr. Harvelle. It was Friday. “It’s not uncommon, and the effects can be stymied with a prescribed medication.”
“I’m...sorry,” Castiel said despondently. “I wish...we had met under other circumstances. I think I had better just go.”
Cas’s stomach clenched as Dean came into the kitchen in his grey robe. “Mornin’,” Dean grunted, helping himself to a cup of coffee.
And suddenly he knew: it was true. He tried to picture his seventh grade teacher’s face, tried to recall what color his graduation robe had been, his first car, his first kiss: it was all just blank. The harder he tried to think back on all his “memories”, the more he realized it was all just a black void, just information he’d been given to “remember.” Facts about his character’s backstory Chuck had made up, or figures his desperate brain had conceived to compensate for his lack of a past, like Amara.
“The doc said it was your wristwatch,” Dean said with a shrug. “Apparently it shattered in the accident—it took the brunt of the impact. A little piece of it embedded itself in your wrist and tore a vein, but it also stifled the bleeding so you were able to survive long enough for them to operate on you. She said they couldn’t take out the piece of metal out with damaging the vein irreparably or something, so you’ll just have to live with a little piece of watch in your arm.”
Sure enough, Dean spied Cas in the nature section with a book on his lap, curled up on a couch with his chin propped on his elbow. But as Dean quietly approached him from behind, he saw that Cas wasn’t reading at all. He was staring gloomily at his phone—at the picture Sam had taken of them kissing.
Cas giggled warmly, coaxing Dean to kiss him. “I can’t believe roleplaying as ourselves when we first met is the scenario you chose for our first time together as a married couple.”
Castiel reached over and touched Sam’s forearm. “I’m so sorry. My own parents died in a car accident, but I was only a baby when it happened so I never really knew them. I can’t imagine how hard it must have been for you.”
“I’ve been hearing your voice. You’ve been narrating my life. The way I count brushstrokes when I brush my teeth, the way I style my hair, the way I tie my tie...falling in love with Dean, you narrated all of that!”
“What? Who?” Claire said, but Amelia returned with a tray of cookies and warm peppermint tea before Castiel had to answer her (fortunately).
Was he...dreaming somehow? Castiel didn’t need to sleep except he was extremely over-exerted, but he certainly didn’t remember going to bed. Had a djinn overpowered him without him realizing it? Put him into some sort of construct where he and Dean were together?
Unfortunately, this story starts out sad. See, there was one fateful December night when there was a horrible car accident. The newly proud parents of identical twin baby boys were out for a drive when their car slipped and skid on the icy road. They died so fast, the angel who’d been assigned to their family didn’t even have time to save them. So those twin boys went to an orphanage.
Crowley’s visage dissolved into black goo and melted into the ground. Cas let out a shuddering breath, back slamming against the side of the building for support. He remained that way for a good, long while as he fought back tears.
“You and I and our two wonderful children,” Cas whispered. “And Sam and Mary...it really is perfect, isn’t it?”
After that exchange, Cas drifted back to sleep, feeling as though he’d been hit by a bus...and he had. When he awoke a few hours later, his gaze was met with tired green eyes staring at him.
Dean walked Cas to the bus stop to catch his bus downtown to the office. As it turned out, Dean needed to pick up a part from a supplier in the same area and he wanted to ride with Castiel rather than drive his car.
Dean sneezed as a puff of dust tickled his nose. “I dunno, man, I don’t think anyone’s touched anything in here in a long time,” he sighed, looking over his shoulder to see if Cas had had any luck.
Sam frowned. “Of course he did. Jerk just can’t take a good thing at face value. Hold on, I’ll get him for you.”
Dean moaned in response, letting himself drown in the sensations of his own body wrapped around him.
Dentist? What was a dentist? What were fillings? They sounded delicious. But instead of asking, Castiel wisely decided to just nod.
“Exactly.” Sam frowned at the doorway thoughtfully. “Dean doesn’t exactly have the best track record with marks,” he added, quieter.
“I know what it means,” Dean chuckled, leaning in to kiss him. “I’m a simp when it comes to you; I am not ashamed of that.”
“And I’ve got your front.” Dean grabbed Cas by the tie and dragged him into an enthusiastic, adrenaline-fueled kiss. Cas moaned, eagerly kissing him back.
Dean gasped, sitting bolt upright in his bed. There was cold sweat beading at his hairline. His own arms wrapped around his frame in an attempt to hold him, calm him down.
He wanted to say something smooth or romantic but he was totally tongue-tied. “But you left the oven on,” he blurted out.
As they were washing the dishes together, Dean suddenly said, “Hey, uh...what would you say to meeting my family?”
“Well, they’re a bit well done, but I think with enough ketchup, they’ll be edible,” Dean said, returning carrying three plates with big juicy burgers on them. “And don’t worry, princess, yours is a
”Sorry it took so damn long for us to get our shit together,” Dean said. “Guess we coulda used that courage a lot sooner, huh?”
Tears were streaming down Cas’s cheeks, moved by the words that had so poignantly spelled out his own death. He pressed the pages to his heart, letting the prose sink in. Then he turned to look at Dean, stared at his freckles, his long eyelashes, his slightly crooked nose that had been broken several times whilst getting into fistfights for various reasons throughout his life, his firm full lips, and smiled. He brought his hand to Dean’s cheek, waking the man immediately, then tenderly pressed their lips together in a slow, lingering kiss.
“Dean, while we were in the alcohol store, a child snuck into the vehicle and tried to abscond with it. Clearly we retrieved it safely,” Cas calmly explained.
“Tell you what, I preheated the oven when I was in the kitchen. I was gonna pop a lasagna in for dinner—you want in?”
In the morning, Claire was gone, and Jack was no longer calling Castiel “Dad”. There was no more ring on Cas’s finger. Everything was as it should be.
as the angel strode inside, his trenchcoat waving in the slight cross breeze coming through the door. He spotted Sam’s tall head poking up over the tops of the aisle of the small bodega immediately and edged his way through the narrow walkways.
Castiel looked down to see what Dean was gesturing to. He realized, now that he was looking closer, that there were two faint pink scars settled beneath his pectoral muscles. “You wouldn’t be the first person who’s stared at me like I’m some freak of nature,” Dean growled. “I ain’t ashamed of my body, I’m proud of who I am. Still, don’t need people gawking at me like I’m in the damn zoo.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but gestured to the bed that was still made up and didn’t have dirty clothes scattered around it. Dean cleared his throat, going over to his own bed and shoving the clothes out of sight. “Sorry, don’t typically get guests,” he said sardonically.
The overwhelming smell of oil hit Castiel’s nostrils as soon as he let himself into the modest garage space. He’d never really understood cars or their appeal. For one thing, he didn’t really think they were worth all the damage they were doing to the atmosphere; another...automobiles scared Castiel. Just thought of getting behind the wheel of one made his hands shake, almost dropping his briefcase on the ground.
Soon Dean felt a lubed up finger push against his hole and he instinctively tensed up. “Open up for me, Dean,” said the angel, voice smooth as butter, and some part of Dean wanted to obey him. “You don’t have to fight anymore, not here. You can surrender, Dean. The fight is over.”
“No, he’s mad at me. But I’m worried I may have just made things weird for you two.” Sam frowned apologetically at Castiel.
Finally the angel slid his fingers out of Dean’s hole. “I daresay that was the hardest you’ve ever come in your life,” Castiel murmured, soothingly stroking Dean’s back. “Do you understand now, my love? You’re mine, aren’t you.” It wasn’t a question.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “Yes. I think I’ll do just that. You don’t seem to know your place, Dean, but I assure you, once this night is through, you’ll understand
“Aw, come on!” Dean groaned as Castiel sliced his way up the front of Dean’s shirt to reveal his chest.
Charlie looked up at him, eyes tearing up. “Castiel...” she said, the conviction in her voice gut-wrenching to Castiel’s ears. “I’m so sorry.”
“Technically, you do—mine.” Dean groaned softly as he palmed the front of his flannel pajamas. It had been
“Don’t quote Disney to me, you mega dork,” Dean said, laughing through his tears as he cupped Cas’s face and firmly kissed him again.
was Castiel ringing my doorbell,” said Chuck. “But...” He wrung the sash of his bathrobe in his fists. “I made...notes.”
Dean cleared his throat, sitting down at the table. “You, uh...you make all this? Not that I’m trashing your skills in the kitchen, Cas, but...”
Dean could tell that Cas was teasing him, but that he was also being completely serious. “No, no, it’s okay. Self hatred’s kinda...hard to get over, ya know.”
“I...” Suddenly Castiel remembered his original purpose for being there. He cleared his throat. “Mr. Winchester, I’m Castiel Novak, I’m from the IRS-”
“It’s a special marking that means that someday,” Gabriel explained, “you’re gonna meet someone very special. Someone who’s gonna be like a best friend to you, and even more.”
Cas looked up at the sound of Dean’s voice, squeezing the pearl in his hand. Sam quickly explained the Baozhu to his brother, who blinked in surprise. “You’re kiddin’ me. Michael outta my friggin’ head?”
as he had legally changed his name, in the IRS records. It wasn’t like anyone would find out about it.
“Narrators almost never interact with their characters. It’s the law of diegesis. Unless we were talking about some kind of meta fiction, which so far doesn’t seem to be the case. So, you know you’re gonna die, but not when or how.” Dr. Bradbury sighed. “Dramatic irony. It’ll fuck you every time. And you said you don’t know the narrator’s voice?”
(Of course, it wouldn’t matter if Dean did come at this moment; Castiel’s body could go as many rounds as he wanted, technically, since angel grace shortened the refractory period to basically nothing. But it was a matter of pride. He didn’t want to erupt in under two minutes like a goddamn fifteen year old, right?)
Well that was impossible. It had to be 3 in the afternoon at least. That strange glitching in Joshua’s office—it must’ve reset his watch or something. “Does anyone have the time?” he asked the group he was standing with as they waited to cross. He would’ve checked his phone, but it had run out of battery somewhere between his meltdown outside of Winchester’s Garage and his uncomfortable HR meeting.
And as they settled under the covers, in each other’s arms, Cas’s head pillowed on Dean’s chest, Cas felt overwhelmingly happy. Because he knew Dean Winchester had fallen in love with him.
“He’s not alone, look at the mark on his wrist. He’s got a soulmate out there. In a few decades’ time he’ll want to be with them and he can’t meet his soulmate if he’s up here with us. He doesn’t belong here, Gabe.”
An air-piercing screech filled their ears as Sam and Castiel watched helplessly through the storefront window as the Impala, Dean’s pride and joy, took off down the street.
you,” he choked out, staring at the gloomy concrete floor. “I’ve loved you for as long as I can freaking
Chuck looked up at Cas with haunted eyes. Cas could tell he hadn’t slept since they last met. “Did...did you read it?”
“Dean, I...” Castiel closed his eyes, leaning his forehead against the other man’s. “Take me to bed, please.”
“How the hell did that happen?! What, you leave the keys in the ignition?” Dean again glared accusingly at Sam.
you’re saying it then...yes, I love you too. I’ve always loved you, Cas,” Dean whispered, finally looking up at him..
, bootlicker? How about all the fat cats in Washington taking honest taxpayer dollars and slipping them into their own fur-lined pockets? Or to fund organizations that are working to take away rights from women, people of color, the disabled, and people in the LGBT community? Do you know how much all of Trump’s little trips to Mar-a-fucking-Lago in the last four years cost blue collar guys like me?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean replied cheekily, flipping over. Cas kneeled over him, drinking in his naked body. He really was so beautiful. Cas leaned down to kiss his mouth, then started nibbling his neck. He worked his way down, stroking and kissing and worshiping Dean’s torso and stomach and thighs, till he finally got in between Dean’s legs. He was delighted to see that he was already quite wet. Cas kissed a slow, teasing trail up the inside of Dean’s thighs, and Dean shivered. “Dammit, Cas, you’re such a tease,” he groaned.
“Hey. Writing is writing,” Charlie chastised. “So...why’d you let Becky change it? Why did you go for the happy ending?”
Cas watched him go longingly, swallowing the huge pit that formed in his throat. Then he reached into the pocket of his trenchcoat, which he’d taken off to do the dishes and folded over a stool, and pulled out the pearl.
Silver white vapor—Cas’s grace—flowed from the angel’s lips and into Dean’s...almost like an indirect kiss. Then Dean leapt out of the way as the life in those blue eyes faded. Two black tendrils shot past Dean as the Empty grabbed Billie, then Cas’s former vessel, engulfed them, and then disappeared.
Normally Castiel avoided heavy physical contact, but with the mechanic...he didn’t seem to mind so much. “I’m...I’m sorry, I don’t know why I broke down like that,” Castiel said, cringing his voice coming out all squeaky. “People I audit don’t usually get to me like this, and they’ve called me way worse things than you. It’s...been kind of a bad day for me.”
“Hey, Castiel.” It was Inias, one of Castiel’s friendlier coworkers—Castiel would even be so bold as to call him a friend if they’d ever associated outside of the office. “Is something wrong? You’re...just standing there, staring at the Ls.”
” he said, despising how whiny and wavery his voice sounded to his own ears. “I’m just a guy who works in a cubicle who gets assigned cases! And for the record, I don’t like the way the government spends the tax budget either, but I’m not a member of Congress, so I can’t do a lot to change it! I don’t know who you think I am but I’m not just some bureaucratic...establishment-loving...
They reappeared somewhere in a field, several miles from Lebanon and the bunker, and Cas loosened his grip on Dean, though not letting him go entirely. Dean looked around in confusion. “What? How did-...did you
“Hey, I don’t care if you’ve had zero partners or a million. I just wanna be with you,” Dean said soothingly, pulling him close and tenderly kissing him. “I think you’re really special, Cas.”
“I know it’s hard, but one day, Castiel, you’ll have a friend.” Gabriel patted Cas’s arm where his soulmate mark was. “You just have to be patient.”
professor. My class is a blowoff for most of these chucklefucks anyway. Okay, my man, sit down. Let’s talk. Let’s determine
“Well...my writing seems to coincide with what happens to you...so if I start on the ending today...I should finish it by...tomorrow morning,” Chuck said softly.
“That’s become grossly obvious,” Castiel said, slapping his hand against his thigh in frustration. “I told you, Charlie...I’m in a tragedy.”
Dean looked thoughtfully at Cas’s hair, still slightly sticky from the potion (yet somehow still cute—unfair). Not
“Dean, I...” Castiel could feel a lump welling up in his throat again. “Of course I want to be with you, but...it’s not that simple.”
She pulled out another, with a bunch of graphic stickers from heavy death metal bands Castiel had never heard of. “This one says, ‘my middle class white Episcopalian parents asked me not to get a nose ring; they just don’t
Dean stripped Cas out of his clothes completely and gazed at him, laid out on his bed beneath him. “So goddamn beautiful, Cas,” he sighed, kissing his collarbone. “And you’re all mine.”
The next thing he knew, his knees were buckled and strong muscled arms were holding Castiel up. “Whoa, buddy, stay with me,” Dean’s voice rumbled in his ear.
Cas smiled. “I love how protective you are of me. I mean it’s adorable since I’m 100 times more powerful than you, but still...it’s very sweet.”
“Because I don’t eat and getting you and Claire to sit still longer than two minutes is impossible?” Cas teased.
The last thing he gave Castiel was a model car, of a 1967 Chevy Impala. “This is what Dean’s car looks like. It’s his pride and joy.”
Dean’s lips crashed into Cas’s and the angel kissed the hunter back desperately, hands clinging to the front of Dean’s shirt, damp with dishwater. Dean’s lips were salty with the taste of their mingling tears. Cas drew out the kiss as long as he could, knowing it would be their last.
The Caller ID said that it was Dean, calming Cas a finite bit. He accepted the call and raised the phone to his ear. “Hello, Dean,” he said, unable to keep from smiling.
Dean suddenly laughed, a genuine laugh, not skeptical or derisive. “I mean you don’t have any jammies or anything?”
Castiel turned to see Dean climbing out of a vintage Chevy Impala parked by the curb. “Dean?” Cas said breathlessly. “Wha-...how did you know I’d be here? What are you even doing here?”
“That’s it, baby, fuck me,” Dean sighed, reaching down between his legs to rub his clit. Cas could feel that Dean was soaking wet again. “You’re amazing.”
“I...I noticed it was tattooed on your arm,” Cas said, daring to let his index finger touch the delicately inked words on Dean’s forearm. “Does it...have special significance to you?”
gentle, and he seemed to encourage Cas to be a little rougher and faster as he got closer and closer. “Oh!” Dean gasped. “D-do that, that thing you just did!”
find himself playing with the cube’s little buttons inside his pocket as he stood on the corner by the crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. With a growl he jerked his hand out of his pocket. He brought his wrist up to his face to check the time...to see that his watch said 11:17.
As Castiel worked, people came in and out of the shop. One man, a burly older gentleman with a gruff voice, barged in to, as he put it, “take a leak” in the small bathroom connected to Dean’s office. He turned out to be Dean’s honorary uncle, Bobby Singer, the previous owner of the garage. He gave Castiel the stink-eye when he found out he was “the taxman”, but Dean quellingly pulled him out of the office so Castiel could work in peace. So Dean’s surrogate father hated him. Wonderful. Another point against Castiel.
They sat up all night, Castiel’s eyes glued to the pages while Dean stubbornly refused to so much as peek, face buried in Cas’s shoulder and his arms clinging to his waist. By the time the sun had risen and Castiel’s eyes were scanning over the final line, Dean had fallen fast asleep against Cas’s shoulder.
“Yes. To be completely honest...” Castiel took a step forward. “I have wanted you from the moment you stepped out of your office, half-naked and stunning. And that’s why I’ve made a complete idiot of myself in front of you ever since. Because you...you take my breath away. You shut down all my higher brain functions. I’ve never been so...
” Suddenly Dean squeezed down hard on Cas’s hand and he writhed with pleasure. Cas didn’t let up, even when Dean’s thighs threatened to crush his hand so hard he thought the bones would break. It was like Dean was in a whole other universe, crying and moaning as his whole body convulsed, his face twisted with anguished pleasure. Cas was transfixed. Watching Dean Winchester orgasm was like seeing the birth of the universe itself.
Castiel nodded. “That’s all I need.” He took a deep breath, climbed the worn out concrete steps to the author’s house...and rang the doorbell.
Sam took it gingerly. “This might work. I’ll put this on a slide and call Rowena in the morning. For now we humans might as well get to bed. It’s been a long night.”
Dean tried to shake him off, but suddenly Castiel was pushing him backwards and pinning him to the wall. Dean felt as though the breath had been knocked out of him, even though he wasn’t in any pain. “You should show me some respect,” Castiel growled, his intense blue eyes seeming to radiate with danger. “I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in.”
Chuck thought about her question for a second. “I guess...I thought about all the people I’ve killed in my stories. All the stories I’ve ended before their time. All the pain. And I asked myself...but why? A tragic ending can be moving, poetic, maybe even fitting. But I’ve come to realize that a sad ending isn’t always the same as a good one. There can be just as much beauty in living as there is in death. As much meaning in happiness as there is in tears. As much value in hope than there is in bleakness. Maybe I owed the world a little hope after putting so much pain into it. At the very least...I owed it to Cas and Dean.” Chuck smiled. “They deserve their happy ending.”
Suddenly, Castiel’s watch began to beep, its digital face glowing blue. Castiel stared at the watch face, which instead of displaying numbers, was showing strange symbols and swirls. Castiel slapped his watch and fiddled with the buttons frantically as the beeping grated at his ears. “Um...sorry,” he stammered nervously. “It’s not supposed to do this...come on, shut up!” he groaned.
Once Sam and Cas had gotten the Impala back (and vanquished a ghost clown—Sam had been less than thrilled), they picked up Dean at the grocery store. “Don’t tell Dean about the pearl yet,” Sam said to Cas as Dean approached the car. “I want to find it first—don’t want to get his hopes up if it turns out to be lost or something.”
Uriel/The Empty laughed. “Isn’t that sweet. Your little guard dog thinks it can take me on. If you like, I can always just go and find the boy and take him instead. He won’t be hard to find on a planet this barren.”
“I can tell. One tastes like food, the other tastes like depression in a bun.” Dean handed Cas a plate. “Here ya go.”
Sam’s head popped up. “Really?” He looked in Cas’s hand. “That must be it. I’ll get Dean.” He hurried off toward the kitchen.
“I-I-...i-it’s not that I don’t want to, I just...I’m protecting you here,” Castiel said, following the mechanic out of the office. “You’re in enough trouble with the IRS as it is and I wouldn’t want you to-”
Castiel was dressing a lot more relaxed these days. Tonight he was wearing a nice, light blue button up under a dark blue cardigan, with tan colored chinos. “I’m on stay-cation,” Castiel explained.
“Dean, I know you must be disappointed about the pearl. You don’t have to hide it from me,” Cas said, trying to ignore the cold, clammy fingers of guilt grasping at him.
Castiel Novak realized that his life was remarkable, and he wasn’t going to waste another moment of it counting brushstrokes in the bathroom mirror ever again. He had been given a second chance. He wasn’t going to waste it.
“Uh huh,” said Patty, clearly bored and wishing the odd chatty man beside her would just let her sleep.
A cold pit was forming in Dean’s stomach, the sharp cut snapping him back to reality. He looked at the remains of the broken bottle lying behind Cas on the floor, remembering how the mystery liquid inside it had been soaked up by Cas’s skin, like a sponge. Dean stared into Cas’s dilated blue eyes and groaned, this time in distress.
Dean bit his lip as Castiel pulled his asscheeks apart and started expertly eating him out. This was
“You don’t know Metallica?” Dean said in disbelief. “What, there’s no rock music in Jonestown either?”
The demon was back. Why? Cas hadn’t particularly missed him. Why would the pearl bring him back too?
“Cas, we ain’t lettin’ you die if we can help it. We’re not losing you,” Dean said firmly, with no room in his voice for argument.
Castiel grasped Dean’s dick, stroked a couple of times slowly, moaning, then held it out to Dean invitingly.
Then Castiel was pulling him forward with a hand to the back of his own neck, and Dean found himself kissing his own mouth. He could taste his own cinnamon-flavored toothpaste and a faint hint of the finger of bourbon he’d tossed back earlier. It made his head spin.
“You can’t write Cas’s ending,” Charlie said, stepping forward. “Maybe he’s not really your son—maybe he didn’t exist before you started writing—but he’s real now, you can’t just kill him!”
Dean was wide-eyed by the end of his mad tale. “I believe you,” he finally said. “And this is why you gave me the brush off, huh. You didn’t want to hurt me.”
Had he set it for the correct time, he and Dean would’ve left the house too late that morning to catch the 7:21 municipal bus, and therefore would’ve missed their collision with fate entirely.
Dean obediently rubbed his prostate and Cas gasped, seeing stars. “Fuck! I’m ready, I’m ready for you, Dean...”
One final tap of Castiel’s fingers to Dean’s forehead, and Dean was back to the first position, on his back on the bed with his wrists bound above his head. Castiel was now completely naked, between his legs, oily fingers pressing against Dean’s hole. “You’re going to feel so good around me, my love. Your brand new body opening for its maker, my perfect receptacle, the sheath to my sword.”
“I’m tempted to,” Dean said, his hands and mouth exploring Cas’s newly revealed skin. “Wanna take you apart till you’re beggin’ me for it.”
The angels nearest him, Hannah and Samandriel, visibly cringed. Castiel knew either of them could make 10 stuffed animals in the same amount of time it took him to make just one.
Early the next morning, Castiel and Dean showered together, admittedly groping each other more than actually getting clean, and Dean made delicious scrambled eggs and perfectly crispy bacon for breakfast. Then Castiel kissed Dean goodbye in front of the garage before Dean had to open up shop, and caught the bus downtown to the college.
After lunch, Castiel was putting away his finished paperwork in the file room. P for Pemberly. D for Dawson. L for-
“I know,” Dean murmured, soothingly kissing his neck. “Pretty amazing, isn’t it? Love the way you split me open, baby.”
“Hello?” he called out. He was met with only the sound of blaring rock music. He slowly paced around, looking everywhere for a sign of life, till finally he saw a pair of bow legs clad in grease-stained jeans sticking out from underneath a bright orange car. “Mr. Winchester?” Castiel said.
“And your bluer than blue eyes,” Dean finished, pulling back so he could stare into them. His green gaze was so intense, Cas thought Dean was going to suck him right in. “
Dean laughed. “That’s one of my favorites. It’s about Charlie, my illustrator buddy. She LARPs in her spare time. She was fucking
“Don’t know what would happen to me if I did,” Castiel said, offering a weak smile. “I might disappear altogether.”
“So, Cas, I noticed you didn’t drive here. Can I give you a lift to where you’re staying?” Sam asked as Castiel helped him with the dishes. Sam had said he was a guest and that he didn’t have to, but Castiel wanted to help.
“If one were to...accidentally make a wish, one they knew it was wrong to make, and they wanted to fix their mistake, could one possibly reverse the wish?”
Cas groaned involuntarily against Dean, which encouraged Dean to coax Cas’s lips open so he lick his way inside his mouth. “Mmm, how ‘bout we skip the movie tonight?” Dean purred into the kiss.
Dean shook his head slightly, lips pressed firmly together, swallowing hard, but it was too late. The words were already out. Cas smiled proudly, feeling more at peace than he ever had in the whole of his existence. His love had set him free. It was over.
In all the hundreds of years of angels serving humanity on Christmas, no human being has ever set foot in Santa’s workshop. Until, that is, about 30 or so years ago. And that’s where our story really begins...
The angel already took up so much of Dean’s heart, he might as damn well take up residence officially.
knows there’s more than just friendship there. Dean, you have feelings for Cas. Why won’t you just admit it?”
Sam nodded, and Cas handed over the pearl. Dean gave him a weak smile and then looked at the pearl. “...okay,” he said after a tense moment. “So, what do I—?”
“Wait, really?” Castiel studied himself in his closet mirror. He supposed the tousled look did have a certain appeal...
“My wife. She’s a teacher, she’ll be home around 4 or 5. Come on, let’s all go sit down in the living room and get acquainted.”
Castiel had gotten blown a couple of times in college, but holy Toledo, Dean made fellatio into an artform. Those guys in college were fingerpainting while Dean was creating
“What a filthy mouth. You clearly need something to occupy it.” Castiel, now dressed down to his shirtsleeves, which he had rolled up to his elbows, stroked his thumb over Dean’s lips. “Open up,” he commanded.
Charlie stood up straight as she read the address, like she’d been zapped with electricity. “Holy shit, then what are we doing here stuffing our faces with ice cream?! Let’s go get this son of a bitch to change his story!”
about the sound of his first name on Dean’s breath that made Cas go weak. “Why of all songs to learn on guitar...did you pick that one?” He smiled, green eyes sparkling as if he already knew.
“Well...he’s been right about things. The other day someone asked me the solution to a math problem, I gave the wrong answer—which I’ve never done before—and the voice corrected me. And...the other day, I met this...” Castiel sighed, stomach going in knots just thinking of Dean Winchester. “This absolutely beautiful man. The most stunning individual I’ve ever seen. I rarely feel attraction to people, but
“Is it time? Can we go now?” Dean said impatiently. He was just itching to open up a can of whoopass.
This time it wasn’t a family-friendly gentle peck. It was slow and sweet and deep. Cas could feel it: Dean was kissing him with all the love and passion he contained—and Cas had seen Dean’s bare soul firsthand and knew how deep love ran in the hunter. It was like being drunk. It was like being run over by a semi-truck. It was like flying with his long lost wings.
“Yeah...a mechanic,” sighed Castiel. “With the greenest eyes you’ve ever seen. I’m seeing him tomorrow to audit his finances.”
“Truce.” Castiel shook, smiling shyly. “Technically I’m not supposed to get friendly with my cases.”
Cas stared down at the top of Dean’s ash blonde head in bewilderment. Husband? Cas looked at Sam to see if he was at all concerned about Dean’s strange behavior, but Sam was nonchalantly eating his meat-free burger, watching Dean clean up.
The door pounded threateningly, but Cas only had eyes for Dean, his greener than green eyes filling up with realization, dread, despair.
Suddenly Dean hissed, jerking his hand back, breaking the kiss. Blood dribbled from a small wound on his middle finger—the culprit was a small shard of glass hidden in Cas’s hair.
“Cas, whatever it is, I wanna help,” Dean said, touching his shoulder. “Even if you don’t wanna...be with me...I still want to be your friend.”
“The law says you can’t give me anything. There’s nothing that says I can’t give you something,” Castiel teased back.
to draw herself kicking ass and saving the fairy princess. The assholes at Sandover didn’t like the queer themes, they wanted me to make Charlie a king instead of a queen, but I put my foot down.”
Sam and Cas watched and waited for a full, tense minute. Finally Dean opened one green eye at them. “Nothing,” he said, his voice dropping.
the lucky one here,” Dean replied warmly. “Now...you ready? Me and Charlie are right here with you.”
“I’d like that.” Castiel had recently lost his front tooth, so there was a gap in his smile. “There’s never anyone for me to play with. Except the reindeer, but Uriel won’t let me go in the stables.”
“And I brought you a gift.” Castiel held out a brand new toolbox with a red bow on the handle. “To replace the one tripped over. It’s even blue, since you seem to be partial to that color.”
Finally he reached the apex of Dean’s thighs and pressed a gentle kiss against his lips. Dean’s breath hitched, and Cas found himself smirking as his tongue darted out and he started to lick.
to save him. Now if you’ll excuse me...” The Empty smoothed down its suit jacket. “I’ve other business to attend to.”
“Oh yes. He once tried to teach me some of it, but I didn’t retain any. I think the phrase he tried to teach me was...‘you breed with the mouth of a goat.’”
“Oh really? Well sorry, shortcake, but I’m not for hire. So stay out of my business.” Dean tried to push past the angel and leave, but Castiel grabbed his wrist with alarming strength.
Dean swallowed hard, just barely managing to keep his hands from shaking and splattering coffee everywhere. “Sammy, it’s gotta be a mistake. Cas doesn’t-...he can’t-...what the fuck do I have to offer an
“I’m just...gonna go now,” Castiel mumbled, grabbing his briefcase and scurrying out before he could make even more of an idiot of himself.
Cas couldn’t respond, couldn’t even move. All he wanted to do was sink into Dean until the world faded around them and he forgot all of this, like it was just a bad dream...wait. He looked up at Dean, this unbelievably perfect man who from the moment he’d met him, seemed too good to be true. “Are you...did he make you too?” Cas whispered. “Did he make you up just to fall in love with me?”
Dean shrugged. “Asked Bobby to cover for the day. He doesn’t mind. I think he hates being retired, to be honest. Misses the smell of engine grease.”
And like that, Castiel was inducted into the life of the Christmas angels. He grew up at the normal human rate, which felt like both a blip and an eternity to his angel guardian. See, time feels different to an angel since they’re immortal, but angels are never really born, they’re just created, fully formed, so they never grow up. So it was pretty hard for little Castiel, having no kids to play with as a kid. Then again, there were no snot-nose kid angels around to mock him about his lack of wings, so maybe it was for the best. Castiel never questioned why he had no wings, assuming they would grow in when he reached adulthood.
Castiel thanked her for all her help and left the store feeling more determined than he had in his whole life.
“Look, first thing’s first: I know you’re planning on killing me,” Castiel said quickly. “And now that you know that I exist...I’m asking you
Dean stopped short. “What am I supposed to say to him, Sam? Huh? ‘Gee, Cas, I think you’re keen! Wanna go steady? We can share a malt at the soda shop and you can wear my pin!’”
“Dude, if it was just for a night or two I’d say yes, but my apartment is a one bathroom closet. My roomie Dorothy sleeps in the bedroom and I sleep on the pullout couch in the living room. The salary for a community college media studies professor doesn’t exactly buy the life of Riley.”
Cas reached Dean’s other hand down to cradle his balls, rolling and squeezing them gently, only heightening Dean’s pleasure.
“There are a lot of interesting artifacts in here. I wish we had time to look everything over with more scrutiny,” Cas commented, studying a yellowed envelope. “This is correspondence from THE Arthur Conan Doyle about a sighting of fairies in the English countryside. Apparently he was a British Man of Letters.”
Castiel knew his singing voice left much to be desired, but he hoped his playing was decent enough to make up for it, or at least distract from it. Dean sat beside him, reverently silent. Finally, as Cas had finished the last “
”And then you finally came to your senses, but the Leviathan took over and, and...” Pain flashed across Dean’s face. “Jesus Christ, watching you walk into the river was like going to Hell all over again.”
Cas smiled shyly, gesturing to the table. “Dinner. I thought it might be nice to eat together. As a family.”
“I guess not,” Dean said, shrugging. “All I know was the stuff inside it was clear and white-purple and shiny. And goopy, like shampoo.”
Castiel touched Dean’s forehead with two fingers, and suddenly Dean was lying on his back on a bed, hands bound above his head. “Hey!” he shouted. “Let me go, or I’ll-”
“Yeah, Sammy. Deal with it.” Dean didn’t see the big deal. Why had he stopped himself from flirting with Cas before? It just made sense.
The next morning, Cas was waiting in the kitchen when Sam came in, sweaty and breathing hard from his run. “Hey, Cas,” he said, grabbing a water bottle from the fridge. “You look like you’re thinking about something.”
It was easier to convince James (“please, call me Jimmy”) of Castiel’s identity than Amelia and Claire. Jimmy seemed to trust Castiel immediately, and was thrilled with the idea of having a brother. “We may have separated at infancy, but the Lord brought us back together,” said Jimmy tearfully, after hugging Castiel tightly. “Please, say you’ll spend the holidays with us.”
Cas didn’t respond. Okay. Enough stalling. Time for the truth. Dean tried to summon some of that magic courage he’d felt the day before during the vamp fight. “Uh. So Rowena told Sam something funny about the love potion. Turns out it wasn’t a love potion at all. It was a courage potion.”
Dean genuinely laughed at that. Being a part of his brain had definitely improved the angel’s sense of humor. He remembered some of the times Dean would make a joke or a reference and Cas would just stare in confusion.
Cas rolled his eyes again. “Relax. I drove to the International House of Pancakes this morning and ordered this to go.”
Dean wasn’t much of a talker, at least around new people, Castiel noted. He and Sam held most of the conversation while Dean just brooded, occasionally throwing in a sarcastic comment. At one point Dean did get up and go to the kitchen, returning 10 minutes later with a plate of Christmas cookies and three steaming mugs of hot chocolate, much to Castiel’s delight. He sipped his drink, which was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and sighed fondly. “I appreciate knowing another human with my affinity for hot chocolate culture,” he said to Dean.
“So if it wasn’t you, then how did Castiel live?” Charlie asked, perching against the back of the couch.
Dean walked around the couch to take a seat next to Cas. “I don’t want you to feel embarrassed. It was the potion, it made us both act like dopey teenagers.”
“Not...technically, no, it’s...a grey area,” Castiel said meekly. “It’s not inappropriate to call me by my first name.”
The door behind Cas swung open as Billie stalked inside, gripping her scythe menacingly. Cas closed his eyes, and everything seemed to happen in slow motion.
Cas found that the sleep clothes Dean had given him were very comfortable indeed. After he was dressed, he re-emerged from the bathroom to find Dean absorbed in his computer. He looked around awkwardly, trying to think of something to say (or maybe he shouldn’t say anything at all?) when his eyes landed on a stack of brightly colored books. Castiel squinted and saw that all of the spines had “Dean Winchester” stamped on them. “These are the books you've written?” Cas said curiously, picking up the top one.
Castiel cleared his throat, again finding himself wishing to sink through the concrete floor. “Hopefully it shouldn’t take me all day to assess your accounts, if your records are as good as you say.” The stiffness in his voice echoed in Castiel’s voice, and he cringed. He knew he was supposed to stay professional, but why couldn’t he at least muster a
Dean harrumphed softly, then licked the pad of his thumb, glaring at Castiel. He took a hold of his wrist and ran his spit-moistened thumb down his arm, sweeping over the mark.
Cas looked back at Chuck. “Look, I’m not just one of your characters, I’m a real person, I exist. You can’t kill me, please!”
“Yeah. You from Sandover Publishing? Look, I told those dicks on the phone I’d have the stupid book finished by New Year’s-”
Dean blindly felt around for the lube as he and Cas kissed again. Then his trembling hands popped the cap and got his fingers slicked up. As he eased the first digits inside of his own tight hole, he thought to himself,
Then he slid his tongue over the shaft, licking over that vein on the underside, and listened to Cas’s breath quicken. He reached between his legs to cup his own sack and-
Dean cackled, still dazed from his orgasm. “Baby, you are more than welcome to eat my pussy till your little heart’s content.”
The sight of Dean touching himself, biting his lip and his half-lidded green eyes black with arousal had Cas’s balls drawing tight to his body. “Oh God, Dean, I’m so close...you’re so beautiful...”
Chuck turned out to live in the city. Castiel’s heart pounded as he read the street address. His father was just a Lyft ride away.
“C-can I?” He asked, reaching out for his own cock. “Lemme...I wanna suck you, Cas,” he admitted, blushing deeply. He wanted to suck his own dick. Just to be able to say he had done it.
Cas couldn’t believe what was happening as he watched Dean unbuckle his belt and open the fly of his chinos. He let out a low moan as Dean began to mouth over his cock through his underwear. His head fell back on the arm of the couch, body going limp underneath Dean’s magical touch. “This big cock all for me, baby?” Dean growled, kissing the head. “You gonna fuck me with this big cock, make me come around you? Bet you’ve touched yourself thinkin’ about it, huh.”
“You know what you’re giving up, don’t you?” Santa said warningly. “Many angels would do anything to be where you are. Are you absolutely sure about this?”
Dean was tempted to roll his eyes at the cliched analogy, but he was about to get good and fucked and he’d much rather do that than risk another spanking or worse, being left with this raging hard-on without coming. Castiel would probably do that, the authoritative bastard.
“It’s a ledger, actually. Dean and I raided this guy’s store after he killed our hunter friend and took all his stuff. You wouldn’t believe all the stuff in here. He had
Joshua was an older man, definitely “Summer of Love” stock given his penchant for long, colorful, hippie clothes and dreamcatchers. For an HR consultant, he was unnervingly unconventional. He was the type who very obviously wanted you to think of him as a father figure, and given Castiel’s complicated feelings about his own father, who’d disappeared when Castiel was basically a newborn and left him in the hands of his emotionally distant Aunt Amara, he was loathe to report to Joshua’s office to submit himself to his patronizing counsel.
Sam’s polite cough brought Dean back to reality. “Dean? Going to bed or you planning on camping out here beside the bathroom?”
“Dean, you said I can have anything I want. Right now what I want is to make you feel as incredible as you’ve made me feel. Please,” he begged.
Castiel Novak was a man of infinite numbers, endless calculations, and remarkably few words. And his wristwatch said even less.
that.” Suddenly Cas’s eyes widened. “Look out!” He pushed Dean out of the way and staked another vampire that had been zeroing in on Dean’s neck. “The only one who gets to bite Dean is me,” Cas growled.
Dean laughed shyly. “Yeah. Was trying to avoid popping a boner that we’d both have to deal with. It’s not like I can just turn you off while I touch myself.”
“And the bad news?” Sam prompted. “Cas isn’t gonna die or grow a bunch of boils or something, is he?”
“Oh, I’m real hip to the local queer indie music scene,” Cas said casually, trying to sound cool. Dean laughed, knowing he was full of shit, and pulled him into a kiss.
“But when Jack exploded inside you, it roused all the angels and demons you’ve swallowed, hasn’t it?” Cas said. “Right now it’s chaos inside you. But all those spirits are weak, confused. It’s possible you can send them back to sleep. But I’ve regained all my power and then some. I won’t be so easy to subdue this time. If you swallow me, I will organize all those spirits against you so that you’ll never know peace or quiet again. And that along with the Winchesters trying to penetrate you from the outside to rescue me, that’s a lot of lost sleep for you. So ask yourself...do you
since he’d taken care of himself. “And it’s so hard for you, baby. Just listening to your sexy voice in my head’s got me dying to touch myself.”
,” Dean snarled, sliding protectively in front of the angel. “You’re gonna have to go through me first!”
getting passed up for promotion again. Don’t I deserve to be Santa? To wear the red coat, sit in the sleigh, only have to work one night out of the year, instead of micromanaging these toy-making imbeciles?”
,” Dean muttered, to which Sam responded with a sharp kick under the table. They didn’t talk about it for the rest of the meal.
“Angels don’t have to worry about the cold. And as for me, Gabriel kept me warm with his grace until I was of a certain age, then he kept me dressed in thermal clothing. I suppose I built up a certain tolerance to the cold, growing up in the arctic. But Santa’s facilities are also very well insulated.”
It turned out the little place situated right next to the garage was Dean’s house. It was a small yet warm environment, with a big bookcase and well-loved yet comfortable furniture. There were vintage posters on the walls too, like in the garage, of rock bands and old movies and classic cars. Felt very...homey. Like Dean.
“And me!” Dean piped up, feeling...strangely pumped. Maybe it was because he’d been cooped up in the bunker worrying about Cas and the potion and now he was finally getting some action. Speaking of action...
...you could learn guitar, like you said you’ve always wanted to! Do you want to spend your last days on this bitch of an earth fearing your impending demise, or do you want to enjoy what time you have left?”
Chuck sniffed hard. “I think about all the people I’ve killed in my stories...the werewolf girl who had to be put down by her boyfriend, she didn’t deserve that, she didn’t ask to be a monster. And the vampire hunter who was turned into a vampire...at the time I thought it was such cruel irony, but it was just
Dean gave him an inscrutable look. Castiel’s face flushed and he shyly cleared his throat. “That was...an attempt at a joke,” he said weakly.
Castiel remembered what Gabriel had told him about Dean’s father and put that book aside too, picking up another. “What about this one?” he asked, holding up
With nothing left to say, Castiel walked out of the small dwelling, to live out the rest of his life.
Little did Castiel know, that one little act of rebellion had sent the tax auditor in the trenchcoat down the path of fate...to his own end.
aware of his hand on Cas’s lower back and pulled away as if he’d been burned. “Uh...sorry, Cas,” he muttered, blushing. His awkwardness was definitely back.
Dean took a few deep breaths and climbed back into his seat. “Y’know what I think, Cas? I think you were raised by some sort of fringe religious cult in Canada that worships Santa Claus and somehow they let you escape the commune.”
Cas’s vision went white as he exploded with pleasure. He gasped for breath as it flooded through him, and he collapsed against the mattress. “Fuck,” he sighed.
“No way, the Sherlock Holmes guy?! Lemme see!” In his excitement, Dean bumped the angel, knocking Cas’s shoulder into the bookcase. The hunter’s ears were alerted to the sound of glass rattling against wood just before a small bottle toppled from the tippy top shelf and crashed down on Cas’s head, shards of glass and pearlescent ooze trailing down his face and shoulders. A surprised Cas cried out and dropped to his knees, hands flying to his face to instinctively wipe the mystery goo from his eyes.
Suddenly Dean found himself shoved back against the bookcase by enthusiastic angel strength and hot angel lips pressed up against his.
” Claire, the girl who’d helped Cas at the guitar store, yelled into the microphone before the young women onstage launched into “Black Betty.”
Claire wailed on her electric guitar for the iconic “Faithfully” solo. “I wish I could play like that,” Cas said, listening admiringly.
, Castiel. Time to make your life worth something. Climb Everest, write a novel, watch every episode of Classic
Cas pulled off and looked up at Dean. “Do you see it?” he asked huskily, and Dean shuddered at the sound of his own rough voice. There was something about this whole thing that was so
Castiel groaned, covering his face. “God, can you please just forget I said that? I don’t know what I was thinking.”
writing an explicit sex scene about him. “But he did say that you had fallen in love with me,” Cas added with a shy smile. “I liked that part.”
” Cas cried as he came, deep down Dean’s throat. Dean groaned around him, swallowing every last drop. He worked him until Cas was shivering and pulling Dean off. “That was...oh my God,” Cas panted.
Castiel pled with the voice. “Uh, Mr. Winchester, according to my records, you failed to pay the full amount of your taxes this past year.”
“I never told Castiel my mom’s name. If you created him, then you know everything he knows. But if you created me too, then you know my mother’s name. So what is it?”
“Just looking for your...ah.” Castiel pulled Dean’s trusty pocket knife from his back pocket. “I hope you’re not overly fond of this shirt...”
“I’m not an elf. I’m human. But I was raised by angels. Christmas angels. Everyone gets that part wrong. It’s angels that work for Santa.”
But as his vision cleared, he realized he was staring into a fluorescent light, embedded in a polystyrene tiled ceiling. He blinked. He was breathing.
Sam flipped through some pages in frustration, looking for another viable option. At the same time, Dean felt the toe of a sensible shoe slowly sliding up the inside of his thigh. Dean looked sharply at Cas, who smiled back, innocent as a lamb as he continued to tease Dean under the table.
Cas.” Cas pulled out of Dean so he could flip over. Cas slid a pillow underneath Dean’s hips and slowly slid back inside. The angle was different now but still good, especially since he look into Dean’s eyes. He resumed thrusting into him but slowed down a bit, wanting to really feel Dean enveloping each inch of him.
At that moment, a child on a bicycle flew past, and Dean jumped out of the way, his ankle twisting as his foot slipped on the curb. Dean tumbled to the pavement.
A woman in a cardigan with a cross around her neck appeared behind her. “Sweetie, what are you doing home from work so early?” Amelia Novak asked.
Traffic rushed by, beeping and honking, people strolled past chatting with each other or on their cell phones, but there was no answer for Castiel in the din surrounding him.
“But...” Dean looked at Cas’s shoulders as if trying to make out his wings. “Your grace. I thought it was kaput-sky?”
“Yo. Take a picture, trenchcoat, it’ll last longer,” Winchester said, glaring as he pulled the clean t-shirt over his head, breaking the spell that befallen Castiel suddenly.
“Damn Gabriel and his soft heart,” Michael swore, sipping his cocoa angrily. “Doesn’t he realize his little
meant to be with. Some people only put value on a relationship if it’s a soulmate relationship. Dean was crushed. The irony is, Lisa and Neal’s marriage only lasted a year and a half. They were miserable with each other. Serves her right.”
“Alright, let’s kill these chuckleheads!” Dean cheered, as he and Cas took off for the hideout’s entrance.
”Only make these on special occasions,” Dean explained as he served Cas a large plate full. “Figure...this is about as special as it gets.”
I’d be climbing the walls with sexual arousal,” Cas said. “As you can see, I’m in perfect control of myself.”
”Ugh, never mind, I hate it again,” Cas groaned, playfully pushing Dean away. Dean snickered, keeping his arm around his waist as he softly sang the lyrics into Cas’s ear. “
Castiel spit into the sink. “Excuse me! I can hear you narrating everything I’m doing!” he called. “If this is someone’s idea of a joke, it’s not amusing!”
Dean slowly smiled. “I don’t deserve you,” he mumbled, leaning forward and pressing his lips to Cas’s for the second time.
“Aww, you didn’t have to do that,” Dean said, taking it and gazing it at fondly. Then he looked up. “Wait. I thought gifts were
For the rest of the afternoon, Castiel sat in the living room with Amelia and Claire, getting to know his new family, then helped Amelia make dinner. By the time Castiel’s brother returned home, it was like Castiel had been a part of the family for years.
“How do I do that?” Castiel asked. “Death could be waiting for me around every corner no matter what I do!”
“To be fair, I pushed him back,” Cas said, looking at Dean with a mischievous gleam in his eye that brought a blush to Dean’s cheeks.
“If I’d been dominating and possessive and made you sexually submit to me when we first met face to face? Yes, I’d say things certainly would’ve been different.”
“Michael outta my head. Got it,” Dean mumbled. He squeezed the pearl in his hand and closed his eyes.
Amelia had disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Castiel alone with the sullen teenager. Castiel looked at her and said, “So...what did you ask Santa for?”
Castiel ran his hands over the old patchwork quilt draped over the couch. It felt nice, like it was made out of old t-shirts. The feeling of the fabric rubbing against his palms grounded Castiel a bit.
“Come on, man, you’ll wrinkle up your nice clothes. Here...” Dean dug around in the duffel bag by the foot of his bed. “You can wear these,” he said, giving him a pair of flannel pajama pants and a worn tee shirt.
exploded inside him, expanding till it was bigger and more powerful than it ever had been before. His angelic strength returned to him tenfold, and he felt something large and familiar uncurl from his shoulder blades. His
Sam crouched on the floor and gingerly picked up the unshattered neck of the potion bottle. “It didn’t have a label?”
Dean grit his teeth and tugged at his bonds. They felt as strong as steel cables, yet they were soft and smooth against his wrists, like silk. “Once I get out of here, I’m gonna kick your ass, angel or not.”
”Gotta admit,” Dean said softly, resting his chin on his folded arms on the back of the couch to look over Cas’s shoulder at the phone, “we do kinda make a cute couple.”
Charlie opened the door to her office and looked at him. “Well, judging by your face, I’m guessing it’s bad news.”
“Babe, you don’t need to worry about me,” Dean said, gently silencing Cas by putting his finger on his lips. “Yeah, Michael’s got an all access pass to my backstage—okay, didn’t mean for that to sound sexual, my bad—but I fought him before. I’m stronger than I seem.”
know he’s going to die, and dies anyway...dies willingly, knowing he could stop it...” Dean shrugged. “You tell me: isn’t that the type of man you want to keep alive?”
The door swung open, opened by a girl with blonde hair and heavy eyeliner. “What’s the matter, Dad, you lost your key?” she snorted.
Oh, hey there. Let me guess, you’re here to hear the story. Well, alright then, grab a plate of Christmas cookies and a glass of milk, ‘cause this is gonna take a while.
“At this point, I wouldn’t discount that theory,” Castiel groaned, rubbing his eyes. “Is this what you would call plot, or just a horrible coincidence?”
After sharing a hot morning shower, Castiel tore himself away from Dean’s grabby arms and persistent kisses, to make a trip uptown—to Chuck’s house. Manuscript in hand, he knocked on the door. His knuckles just barely brushed the wood when Becky opened the door.
Cas lubed up his fingers, then coaxed Dean to turn over on his hands and knees. Dean had a gorgeous ass. Cas pressed a kiss to each cheek before pulling them apart and massaging Dean’s hole. Then he slowly slid one inside past that tight ring of muscle up to the knuckle and curled his finger.
Sam got a funny look on his face, like he was trying to stifle a laugh. “Yeah, uh. About that. Here’s the thing...that potion? The reason we couldn’t find it in the book is because we were looking in the wrong chapter. It wasn’t a love potion.”
The next day was Sunday, the Sunday before Cas was officially supposed to return to work. He found that he really didn’t want to. What had once been his entire life was now the bane of his existence. He’d had a taste of what life could really be about, about playing your guitar (however badly) and going to rock concerts with your incredible boyfriend and walking up in his arms the next morning and eating pancakes together. He wanted more of that.
about to give you a handjob.” Dean smirked. “Lay back, baby, I’m about to blow your mind—among other things.”
Suddenly behind Dean, the wall erupted in a geyser of black goo. At the same time, Billie burst through the door, scythe clenched in her hands.
Nothing remotely interesting. Don’t go outside, don’t answer the phone, don’t read your mail—don’t brush your teeth.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Jimmy said, clutching his wife’s hand. “I remember the first time I met Amelia and saw that our marks matched. I knew I was going to have companionship for the rest of my life. We wish you and your soulmate every happiness.”
Cool air brushed against his face as he stood up and carefully strode through the wreckage to peer down below. He spotted a small construction crew beside the excavator, gathered on the ground two stories below. “Hey!” Castiel yelled, cupping his hands around his mouth. “
Cas just laid the pages aside so he could comfort Dean properly. He only wished he could spare Dean this pain.
Dean snorted, nudging Cas’s thigh with his knee. “I was into you, even back then. I didn’t want to admit it, being as you were such a prick back then and all, but man I also kinda wanted you to just bend me over a table and go to town.”
Dean pulled him close as Cas rubbed him to completion, kissing him fervently and running his hands through his hair. Soon he was crying out and his spine was arching in that way that was now familiar to Cas. As Dean twitched through the aftershocks, Cas watched, bewitched by the look of sheer pleasure on his lover’s face, his ears drinking in the soft gasps of his name on Dean’s lips.
“Okay.” Winchester let him go, still keeping a hand on his shoulder, squeezing affectionately. “You want some water or something?”
“My husband...doesn’t have a twin brother,” Amelia said, looking him up and down, unable to deny Castiel’s exact resemblance to her husband.
Jack set down a large stack of books on the library table. Man, sometimes Dean forgot that kid had archangel strength. “Here’s everything I could find on potions.”
“Jerk,” Sam replied, almost automatically, as if they bickered like this everyday. He hung up Castiel’s trenchcoat and ushered them both into the living room.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” said Castiel in a small, dejected tone. “I didn’t mean to ambush you with all of this, I assure you. I only wished to meet you. But I will leave, if you like.”
“Fine by me,” squeaked Cas, worrying briefly about making a mess on Dean’s couch, but if Dean didn’t care, then...
“I didn’t get hit with anything, I’m just not being a coward anymore!” Dean said. “Man, did you see me with those vamps? I was on
“Hello?” Castiel said aloud, pausing his brushing. He squinted suspiciously, looking around his bathroom as if expecting to see another person in there with him.
“But this isn’t like that,” Castiel said. “I’m not dissociating. I’m fully present in the moment, it’s just that there’s a voice that only I can hear. And he seems to know things that I don’t. He’s not telling me to do anything, he’s just...narrating my life as it happens.”
Dean laughed as they approached the bus stop. “Don’t threaten me with a good time. Oh hey, your shoelace.” He pointed.
Luckily, Sam had said, since the sphere was now broken, the effects would reverse themselves naturally...in 24 hours.
The sleeping vampires stirred and looked around groggily, hissing at the offending sunlight. The vamp nearest the door jumped to his feet and bared his fangs at Dean and Cas.
Charlie muted the program she was watching on the TV in her office. “Damn, dude, you don’t have to tell me what you did last night, you’re practically glowing! Well, congratulations. I’m happy for you. Guess you’ve successfully cheated death.” Charlie looked at a legal pad on her desk. “Guess I can throw this out.”
“Close your mouth when you’re eating, dear, especially when a lady’s present; didn’t your mother ever teach you any-oh. I suppose she didn’t.” Dean glared as Rowena glided over to Castiel. “And you, loverboy. Tell me how you feel about Dean, in excruciating detail.”
The artifact Dean and Cas had stumbled upon in the backlogs of the Bunker had seemed innocuous enough, just a pinkish glass sphere. But the second their hands had touched it, Dean suddenly felt a rush, like he was being picked up by a strong gust of wind and thrown across the room. Then everything went white, and he woke up on the floor with the artifact in shards around him, and his own face was hovering over him, looking down at him in an uncharacteristically bewildered and concerned way. Like the way
Dean jumped as Sam slammed the tome shut. “I can’t find any other possible option in here. It must be somebody’s personal concoction. If I had a sample, I’d call Rowena to come and analyze it.”
Castiel remembered getting caught staring like an idiot at Dean Winchester’s naked torso, almost breaking down into tears in front of him, and making a complete ass of himself when he tripped over the toolbox. He cringed. “It was...pretty disastrous.”
Dean whirled around, cheeks stuffed with pancakes to see Rowena in one of her usual outlandish and extravagant outfits leaning against the doorframe. “Wuhweewuh,” Dean gargled around his mouthful.
Dean kissed him gently, pressing their foreheads together. “Yes, baby. I’m 100% completely in love with you. What we have is
Castiel Novak had never been particularly religious. He did, of course, ponder over what happened after humans shuffled off their mortal coil, like everyone did. He obviously had heard the old adage about seeing a white light at the end of a long tunnel...and as he slowly opened his eyes, that’s exactly what he saw.
“He wasn’t even on my list,” Charlie mumbled to himself. “It doesn’t make sense. He hasn’t written anything in 15 years. He’s been living off the royalties from his horror series for years. Castiel...” Charlie’s eyes were large with worry. “This isn’t good. He...he kills people.”
Dean found that not only had Cas whipped up a pile of bacon and a pot of coffee, but also a huge stack of chocolate chip pancakes. Dean’s mouth was practically watering. “I’m gonna need a bigger mouth,” he mumbled.
Sam smiled sadly, shaking his head. “It was several years ago, when I was in college, getting ready for law school. I fell for Jessica right away, and we were happy...until one night, when she was driving back from a late night at the library, and a drunk driver plowed into her car. It was...really hard. I thought I’d never find love again, that Jess was it. Then I met Eileen.” Sam shrugged, smiling brightening again. “Happy ending.”
“So...you would manifest someone you were in love with,” Cas concluded. So it wasn’t just him, then. That was comforting to know.
“...had to recruit five other angels just to pick up his slack-!” Naomi cut herself off as Michael walked straight into Castiel without looking, and the hot chocolate tumped over, right all over Castiel’s work smock.
Suddenly he felt a thumb run down the crack of his ass and stroke over his hole. “This is where I will take you, Dean,” Castiel said, almost like a promise. “I will open you up, then claim my spoils as is my right.”
Dean reluctantly pulled away from Cas’s lips. “I’m kissing the love of my life, what’s it look like I’m doing?”
After “Black Betty”, the band launched into “Faithfully” by Journey. Dean began to sway with Cas in his arms to the slower, steadier song. “Glad you asked me to come here with you,” Dean murmured. “Wanna spend as much time with you as I can.”
Dean and Cas mowed through the nest like a hot knife through butter, no holds barred and not so much as a whiff of apprehension or fear between them. Sam and Jack got a few licks in, but they might as well have been cheerleaders on the sidelines. It was clear Dean and Cas were the forces to be reckoned with here.
“You’re...exactly what I...pictured...” Chuck slumped to the floor. Apparently fainting ran in the family.
Castiel flushed, realizing he was pestering her. “Never mind.” He took a sidestep away from her and remained mindful of any involuntary shoe-rocking until the bus finally rolled to a halt in front of his patch of concrete.
Cas stared at Sam curiously as the younger Winchester brother carefully returned the pearl to its drawstring bag. “Well...yes. Dean has said I’m like a brother to him.”
Dean chuckled, ruffling his hair. “S’okay. You’re cute.” Then his face grew serious. “I, uh...I haven’t had bottom surgery. Not even sure I ever will. Does that...change anything for you?”
“Excuse me!” The two men pulled apart to see a pucker-faced librarian in a brown knit cardigan who looked to be about 3 zillion years old standing over them, hands on her hips. “This is a library, not Purgatory! I’m going to have to ask you to leave!”
Cas realized it was Saturday. He pulled out his phone and checked something on his calendar...then smiled. “Would you like to go on a date with me? To a rock concert?”
He still couldn’t say it. Not out loud, anyway. But he didn’t need to. Cas was in his head. He could hear everything Dean thought and felt.
“Whose fault is that,” Dean teased gently, sighing as Cas’s questing fingers caressed him. He was trying to find Dean’s clit—he was pretty sure that was the magic key that would make Dean come. “Kiss me,” Dean gently demanded and Cas was more than happy to oblige as he continued to stroke. When Dean gasped into his mouth, Cas guessed he’d done something right.
Cas looked down and spotted a simple gold band on his ring finger that certainly hadn’t been there before. Jimmy Novak had worn a wedding ring when Cas first possessed him, but it hadn’t felt right wearing it, so Cas had removed it long ago, before the first time he was discorporated. This new ring, Cas realized, matched the one on Dean’s hand, which caught the light as Dean gathered up the broken pieces of ceramic. Cas twisted the cool metal around his finger to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.
“I...” Castiel’s face burned. “It was true. I think you’re beautiful. You’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever met. Like if I wasn’t gay before, I definitely am now. But it’s not just your looks, you understand, it’s-it’s...it’s everything about you. It’s like...it’s like your soul is so bright that it just shines through your skin. I haven’t even known you for that long but I can see it. You’re so good and passionate and brave and caring and I wish I was more like you. I’m trying to be braver. I’m trying to actually
an assbutt,” Castiel pouted. “And don’t bring up children’s programming when you’re about to give me a handjob.”
“Somehow...my writing my son’s story...brought you to life. I don’t know how. If I’d known I had that power, I’d have done it long ago, and written my wife’s story too.” Chuck sniffled. “Please forgive me.”
“And if you apologize one more time, I’m gonna smack you.” Dean’s little smirk told Castiel he wasn’t serious.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “No, Dean, I’m not gross.” He pulled something out of his back pocket. “I also have my toothbrush.”
“Hey, if I’d left it up to you we probably would’ve had boring, cutesy, vanilla sex with like...rose petals on the bed and candles and shit.”
“I see ‘im,” said the foreman, in a Cajun drawl. He called up to Castiel. “Ay, you up there! Can’t you see we’re tearin’ this place down, brother?”
Castiel wondered. Gabriel didn’t keep any animals in the igloo they lived in together. What was Michael talking about?
“Oh, baby,” Dean said softly, pulling him into a tight embrace. Cas clung to him, burying his nose in his motor oil stained shirt and breathing in his soap and his sweat. “I love you too,” Dean muttered, rubbing his back.
“Then you know what you have to do. Undo this wish. Or I come for the boy. And hell, I might just take you too, as interest. Don’t keep me waiting.”
“Well, how are we supposed to know if your story is a tragedy or a comedy?” Charlie replied. “If your story is a tragedy, there’s not much hope for you: tragedies always end with the hero’s death. Or in Oedipus’s case, incest and eye gouging.”
And with that, Castiel waved goodbye over his shoulder to the only home he’d ever had as he headed off to the human world, to find his soulmate, and hopefully, along the way, he would find who he was.
?” Castiel turned around to see Dean coming into the dining room, dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt over a black tee and shaved. Dean snorted. “Lemme guess, you work for Santa making toys?”
Dean smiled in defeat. “You really are so sweet.” There was a soft click as he removed the strap and tossed it on the end of the bed. “Here...like this.”
you. I thought you were a stuck up dick with a stick up his ass. But now here we are, all...married and shit. It’s...it’s crazy, isn’t it? How far we’ve come.”
Dean laughed breathlessly. “You’re unbelievable. You’re over here going through hell and you wanna tell me how to fix my finances. If I wasn’t crazy about you before, I would definitely be falling for you now.”
Dean opened the door to his room and went inside. “Well, I guess we’ll see who’s right when this nightmare is over and we get the old Cas back. Good
“I’m sorry, but I’m not,” Chuck said. “That baby couldn’t possibly be you. For one thing, my son would only be 15 now, and you’re, what, 30? I stopped writing 15 years ago because I was too depressed after my wife and son died. I only got the inspiration for
Dean shrugged noncommittally. “Sure. At least I’ll have someone to complain to about the vegan chili, since Eileen always takes your side.”
“Grocery store a coupla blocks over,” Sam answered absently. “Said he didn’t trust me not to bring home my ‘hippie freegan vegan crap.’”
Dean shook his head violently, trying to swallow, but Cas was off like a shot, calmly listing every single one of Dean’s positive traits, everything to “his bravery” to “the shape and fullness of his taut buttocks”. Dean wanted to sink into the floor.
“I miss you,” Dean said. “Is that weird to say? ‘Cause you’re with me all the time, in my head. But I still miss you. Miss your dorky hair and your sexy voice and the way you used to tilt your head and squint your eyes at me.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Good riddance to that damn watch. I’m sick of running my life on that thing’s schedule.”
While Dean was cooking lunch in the kitchen, Sam and Cas were going through the artifacts from the pawn shop. They’d been at it for almost half an hour when Cas happened upon a small, black satin, drawstring bag. He gingerly opened it and a small white stone fell into the palm of his hand. “Sam. I think I’ve found it.”
