“You need to be nice to Sarah okay?” Steve tells his son. The pup ignores this and continues to push his car along the wooden floor of the living room, adding his idea of car sounds every now and then. Steve sighs. Maybe Sarah did need a sister.
Somewhere deep inside he felt guilty about Steve’s death. No matter how hard he tries to convince himself that it was an accident due to miscommunication, Tony refuses to believe that he was innocent.
Happy frowns. “I hate you.”
Steve eventually comes over and Tony smiles at him. “Morning, beautiful,” he greets, patting the spot beside him for Steve to take.
“And marriage.”
“We’re getting there. He’s not a bad guy; I like him a lot.”
Tony nods. “Glad we don’t know how.”
Steve smiles and glances down at his son. “Yeah.”
Nick didn’t kill him, but the look he gives Steve when the Captain enters the room with his son holding his hand could kill. Steve doesn’t even bother trying to apologize, knowing it wouldn’t do any good.
“Then why would you say that?”
Steve sighs heavily and gives in. He makes sure to give Peter another kiss before passing him over to Tony. Peter whimpers from being moved and Tony freezes, afraid that he had disturbed his son. He waits for the wailing to come, but then Peter is falling back asleep.
“I uh almost got it...I think.” Tony knows for a fact that he's failing miserably. Peter is growing more irritable, his face turning red from how uncomfortable he is. Tony sighs. “Okay. I need some help.”
Tony comes closer and the pups quickly get out of the way to make room. They stand off to the side, smiling and giggling excitingly. Peter gets too into it, his giggles rising in volume, and it’s not until Sarah shushes him does he quiet down.
He’s still crying and Morgan has to block out the noise with music and her headphones. She spends the rest of the afternoon in her room, hopeful that her dad will be home soon.
“He’s a kid, Cap. You think letting a teenager run the team is a good idea?”
He glances back at the screen, wishing that the little fluttering in the center would stop. It sounds bad, he knows this, but it would be saving the kid a whole lot of heartache in the future.
I decided to make this have three chapters instead of the two. This one was a little short, but I wanted to get this one updated. I hope you all enjoy it!
A knock on the door interrupts and Peter glances up, muttering a curse to himself. His plan was to pack quickly and sneak out before they would notice. But his parents weren’t idiots. If they were his secret would probably still be considered a secret.
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Bruce assures and quickly comes over to assist. “This is good. I need to check your dilation, okay?”
“Yes…”
“What about it?”
“I don’t care about me.” Tony’s hand comes up to rest on Steve’s wrist. “It’s just you and Pete, remember? That’s all that matters.”
Pain erupts in Tony’s hand and he glances down, finding fingernails digging deep into the skin on his hand. Steve’s eyes are blown wide, his body writhing as he struggles to breathe.
“How’d she do?” Steve asks, turning to Peter.
Steve nods. “Yeah. How are you feeling? Any pain?”
“What?”
Tony curses loudly and takes a step back to calm himself before he loses his cool. Steve takes this opportunity to intervene and calm their distressed son.
“He hurt you. He hurt the pups. He hurt me.”
“Not helping, Buck.”
He wants to prove to his son that he could be a good father. He’d never come close to what Steve was, and the relationship he had with Peter would never compare, but he could still be good enough for his son.
“Steve, push!” The doctor orders.
Steve turns on the faucet and gathers some water into his cupped hands, splashing himself in the face and along his neck. His stomach churns again and he gathers more water, this time to drink.
“Hey,” Steve greets and sits down beside his mate, leaning in close to bury his nose in Tony’s neck and inhale the familiar scent. “I missed you today.”
Tony huffs and sits back down on the sofa. He’s not sure what they’re supposed to do now. It also didn’t help that Jarvis had abandoned him. He thought for sure the AI would’ve continued to speak and try to get to know Peter more. But of course that wasn’t Jarvis’ job. It was Tony who needed to get to know his son.
“-but now you’re going to do it! I’ve been waiting my whole life to train with you guys!”
“He’s awake?” Steve asks.
But he’s not that lucky and his papa comes out of the kitchen.
It hurt. The pain was worse than anything Tony’s ever felt before. He knows JARVIS means well, but the videos are torture. He can’t take it anymore.
“Don’t worry about it.” Steve rises to his feet, swaying slightly. Tony is quick to catch him, and tries to help him back into the chair, only for Steve to protest. “I’m fine. I just got up too quickly.”
“Shh, it’s okay. Pete will be here soon and then it will all be over. We’ll get to meet him and hold him,” Tony whispers soothingly.
“Yeah,” Tony agrees. “Though I wouldn’t mind us trying again.”
“Is she still asleep?” Tony asks when he enters the room, the sound of his voice snapping Steve out of whatever thought he’s having.
Steve huffs and throws his head back against the pillows. Bruce steps out again to give them more privacy.
“I haven’t,” Steve shakes his head and takes the pictures. “Thank you.”
He’s only able to pull up the designs for Sam’s suit when Peter stirs and whimpers. Tony glances in his direction, waiting to see if his son would fall back asleep on his own or require assistance. Peter decides he needs help and he begins to cry.
“I’m fine,” Steve argues. It’s a lie. He’s exhausted, his body drained from the labor and delivery. He doesn’t feel anymore pain, though that could be from the shock he’s still in. “I need to be here for him. I promised.”
Steve chuckles and gestures toward the exit of the kitchen. “Be my guest.”
“No. I saw how you were with him. You’re wonderful, Tony. I wish you could see that you’re not like your father.”
“Don’t talk about him.”
“It’s not your fault,” Sam says softly. “I blamed myself too, but it’s no one’s fault. Look, I wish I knew why it happened and why it had to be Steve, but to be honest I don’t know. I’m so sorry.”
“That’s it?” Steve questions, “we’re pregnant and all you can say is ‘wow’?”
Rollins is on him in seconds, slamming him into the wall. The rest of the agents are crowding around him, preventing him from escaping their grasp. Brock is speaking into his comm. Then the alarm is blaring overhead.
“Have I known?” Tony guesses and Bruce nods. “A few weeks.”
Steve lifts his head to glare at his friend, then with an annoyed huff, he throws his head back against the pillow. “Not even close.”
Steve fastens the shield across his back, then walks over to his dresser where his compass lays and picks it up, flipping it open to reveal the picture inside. His son’s smiling face looks back at him. Steve shuts the compass and puts it in his belt.
“It is. I made myself lose the baby.”
“Do you want me to stay again?” Tony asks. He’s hoping Steve would allow him to stay over one more night, but he doesn’t want to overstay his welcome.
Peter beams proudly. “Do you think he would’ve liked it?”
“It’s not so bad,” Tony admits. He gestures for Steve to bring him the overnight bag he somehow managed to finish while having contractions. His water had yet to break and he was already informed by the staff that he would most likely be in for a long day. It could be worse.
“How did this happen again?” Pepper asks, brows furrowing. She continues to clean up the cut on Tony’s temple, sighing when he refuses to answer. “Tony-”
Tony’s never ran so fast in his life. The moment he pulled up to the compound, he hadn’t stopped running. All he could think about was getting to Steve. All that mattered was making sure he was okay.
Steve shakes his head and groans. “Tony, it hurts. Something’s not right. I think I need to go to-” he gasps suddenly and his eyes shoot down. Then that’s when Tony sees the red stain covering the sheets. “Tony!” Steve cries out in panic.
“I love that kid more than anything. You know that. Which is why I didn’t want him to be like me.”
Steve’s hand trails down to his swollen belly, the fluttering from inside reminding him of why he did what he did. The pup in his belly didn’t deserve this life. He had to run away, get somewhere safe. But he had failed.
“Don’t. Don’t do that.”
“Am I gonna benefit from this too or…” Tony peeks into the bag, frowning when he pulls out a set of outfits and socks. “Pep, you know red is my color. None of these are red.”
“Oh my God.” Bruce cups his mouth.
“How did you do that?” Steve asks. “He wouldn’t calm down for me.”
“You better go. Steve is probably wondering where you are.”
Tony doesn’t go in for the prize right away, he leans back and takes a moment to admire the omega before him. He runs both hands along the inside of Steve’s thighs, eyes scanning over the perfect body.
“I’m okay,” Steve assures with a small smile. “I can walk this off.”
“How is giving birth boring?”
Tony smiles and rests his head back. “I’m gonna get more sleep. Wake me when it’s time to push.”
“Night,” Peter says and the door shuts. He collapses back in his bed with a huff.
“You can come in. I won’t bite,” Sam teases with a small chuckle. His back is turned as he tidies and prepares the room for the next session.
“I like Benjamin,” Tony states. “Ben for short. It’s cute. End of story.”
“He’s beautiful.” Bruce smiles.
It takes another minute for Peter to decide, then he’s taking a deep breath and opening the door he vowed would stay shut forever.
“Yeah,” Peter agrees with a smile of his own.
“It’s good. Just sensitive,” Steve explains, smiling down at the alpha, encouraging him to keep going. Tony complies and sucks the pink nub, a little harsher than before. Steve moans and tips his head back, his eyes falling shut. His body responds from the arousal; he’s already growing wet.
“How are you guys? Good?” Tony asks. When James nods, Tony smiles. “Good! You know what always helps when I can’t sleep?”
Tony grunts loudly when Steve clenches tightly around him. He increases the movement of his hips, chasing after his own release. He’s so close.
“I got this when I was pregnant. It helped me a lot with things I didn’t understand. I was saving it for you one day,” Steve says.
Bucky frowns and shrugs his husband off. “Asshole.”
The door to the room is opening and Doctor Patterson is stepping inside. “How are you feeling, Tony?” She asks as she crosses the room to wash her hands at the sink and grab a pair of gloves.
“Sir,” Jarvis speaks up. “Would you like to keep the reminder?”
Getting out wasn’t going to be easy. But he had to try. If not for himself, then for his pup.
“Come on. Come back inside. You’re not…planning on jumping right?”
The pups all gather around when daddy comes home with a special present. They know it’s for mommy, but they can’t help but grow curious.
If Tony could then he’d just hide in his lab until the baby was born. Actually, he’d prefer to stay longer. He could hide away until the kid was all grown up and off to college. Leaving the baby in Steve’s care would result in a happy childhood for the kid. They’d never be miserable.
The deathly glare Natasha sends his way is enough to change Sam’s mind in seconds.
“Yeah. Don’t let me get this bad with our kids.”
Peter nods and makes his way over to the bed, running a hand over the duvet. He peers up at his dad and smiles. “Thanks.”
Peter perks up at those words and he sits up. “What guy? Is his name Flash?”
Tony opens the door and gestures for Peter to enter first, then he shuts the door behind them. Peter makes himself comfortable in one of the chairs in front of the desk, and his dad takes his own seat.
Steve hears him come in and their eyes meet. Tony doesn’t miss how shiny and red they appear.
“Morning sickness kicking your butt?”
Steve opens his mouth to respond, only to shut it when a loud crash followed by another round of giggles reaches his ears.
“That could work,” Bucky decides to add and he joins them at the table with a cup of coffee for himself and a glass of orange juice for Steve. Steve mutters a ‘thanks’ and accepts the beverage. “And if the letter doesn’t work then fuck him. You have us.”
Tony turns toward the omega for a moment and then back toward the window.
The words are like a painful punch to the gut. Tony tries again to reach out for his son, but Peter turns and runs, disappearing from the lab.
The sweet smell of an omega fills his nose. He’s used to the scent; he smells it every single day, but now it was like the aroma Steve naturally gave off was dialed up. Tony slams his fist against the door and leans forward until his forehead is resting against it.
Steve laughs. “I’ll consider it. Though I don’t know how well Tony will react.”
The guilt he has still weighs heavy on his shoulders. His son would be home if he had taken better care of him. He wishes he could go back somehow and do things the right way, care for his son the way he was supposed to have. It was a miracle that Peter was even alive. Steve would never forgive himself if his son didn’t make it.
“To the compound?”
But a baby. A baby that was his. It was life altering that was for sure, but he’d get a family. For the longest time he had been afraid to have that. He didn’t want to end up like his father or worse.
Natasha rushes to his side to comfort him, wrapping him in her arms and hugging him close. “I know. He’s all I think about too.”
“Hey.” Tony squeezes Steve’s hand reassuringly. “You’re wonderful with Dodger and I know you’ll be even more wonderful with Peter.”
There’s another moment of silence between them. Tony can’t for the life of him think of something to say to make the poor kid feel better. He knew this kind of pain and comforting words didn’t make it better. Nothing could fully erase it.
Peter smiles back, but it falters quickly now that he’s up close and able to see the kind of state his father was in. He’s seen his father come home battered and bruised before, but he’s never seen him like this. His father was broken.
“When did you-”
“No. Can you come get me? I can’t drive.”
Peter clings to his dad tighter, the tears in his eyes rolling down his face. “I don’t want you to go. You’ll stay, right?”
He’s not as fast as he’d like to be, but soon he has Peter changed and swaddled again. Steve doesn’t go back to bed and instead lowers himself in the rocking chair to feed his son. Peter’s learned quickly and latches on without hesitation, greedily taking his fill.
“I swear I can cook.” Tony tries to defend himself. “I thought pasta sounded good and J had stuff delivered. I'm rambling aren’t I? Tell me to shut up any time.”
“I’d never do tha-”
Tony sighs. “God you know me so well. I can’t, Pep. I had Bruce come by and he’s running a paternity test for me and I don’t know. What if...the pup’s mine? I’d be a father!”
Morgan agrees, “It was. But I still want you to be Spider-Man and I still want Harley to get attention. I guess I just wanted some for myself.”
“Really? You’re sending me on a shopping spree?”
“Don’t,” Steve warns and he gets out of bed, ignoring Tony’s pleas for him to stay. “I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes. He can’t hold back the rest of his tears. “I’m sorry I can’t do this part for you. I’m sorry that you’re miserable and I can’t do anything about it. I’m sorry that we did this in the first place.”
“I-I’m fine…” Steve sniffs again and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. “I’m okay. I guess it’s just hitting me. I have a son...two sons.”
Tony groans loudly, tipping his head back and shutting his eyes. His fingers grip the sheets beneath him tightly, toes curling from the intense feeling. He forgot how good it feels to have his feet rubbed.
“Yeah…”
The moment the bottle is pressed to her lips, Morgan accepts it and eagerly begins nursing, filling the room with her suckling. Steve keeps his eyes locked on her face and their eyes meet again. He smiles down at her, but it’s not as bright as it was before. There’s sadness behind it.
“I love you,” Steve says softly.
“It’s still good. Hey, maybe...if you want...we can...the baby is going to need some stuff and…”
Peter huffs. “Not yet. I still have my spidey sense though.”
Fuck.
Steve continues to ignore the questions and gathers what he needs, then he’s pushing past Tony to get to the bedroom. He stuffs the bag and zips it up.
“Don’t. I’m fine, J. You know I always get like this,” Tony replies and continues with his current task. He reaches for the glass again, only to pause and roll his eyes when he hears Jarvis sigh.
“I’m not feeling good,” Peter winces and rubs at his belly.
“Isn’t he always? Wait, why is he still here? You can’t keep him forever, Tony. He’s not some stray you adopted off the street!” Happy hisses.
“Yeah. I’m good. I hate that guy,” Tony grumbles and rubs at his arm where another bruise is beginning to form.
Peter shrugs slightly and they begin to make their way through the crowd. “I don’t know yet.”
But the sleep he desperately craves isn’t granted to him and he’s forced awake when he’s roughly kicked in the side. He grunts from the pain and his eyes squeeze shut. He’s kicked again and this time Tony forces his eyes open.
“Of course not. But I do feel that you should stop wallowing away in self pity.”
“Wait,” Tony says when Steve tries to get up. “Don’t. You can’t drop a bomb like that on me and not expect me to react the way I did. You’re accusing me of-of fucking raping you! I’d never do that to anyone.”
“It’s amazing. Wow.” Tony lowers himself until he’s at eye level with Steve’s belly. He carefully lifts up Steve's shirt until smooth skin is revealed. His hands roam over the bump, his smile growing when the pup moves around. “Hey, kiddo. Guess you’re awake too, huh? I’m uh...I’m not really good at this, but...I’m trying. I want to be a good dad.”
“You will.” Tony smiles and leans over their daughter’s sleeping form to peck Steve on the lips. “Get some sleep, honey. Pete will probably be up soon.”
Two more alpha’s are rushing over and pinning him roughly against the wall. Rollins retrieves the rope and comes closer, an evil grin on his face. Steve struggles to break free from the two alpha’s holding him in place. He manages to slip one arm free and throw the alpha off of him.
“Then good luck. Wait till dad gets home.”
“I love you,” Tony whispers.
“Daddy’s going to be home soon and you’re a mess, and this place is a mess. I don’t think daddy will mind but I do. You are a stinker, huh?”
“And your father?” Steve asks. He immediately senses the hesitation from Tony the moment he asks the question. He’s ready to backtrack and change the subject, but then Tony answers.
“It looks like you’re yelling at a computer monitor and throwing a cup of coffee at the wall.”
“Yep.”
“Hmm,” Alexander frowns and he leans back in his seat and crosses his arms over his chest. “I can only recall one incident. I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, but I wasn’t watching you all night. I did have other guests.”
“Keep me posted.”
Tony appears offended. “Hey! I’m getting better at this cooking thing. I swear I worked really hard to get the french toast golden brown. Now quit judging and dig in.”
The secret he was keeping was too big for just one person and he needed someone to share it with. That person was Ned.
“Guess I wasn’t sure. The last time we really said anything to each other was the day you accused me of being a whack job and using Tony.”
“Goodnight.”
“Thank you. I’m sorry, too. I can be difficult and-”
“Steve, you didn’t mean it. You were upset and didn’t realize you were holding her too tight.”
Tony lets out a sigh of defeat. There was no point trying to deny it. “I don’t know. Sometimes they seem like they do and then you’re irritable and lashing out at me.”
“Wait? I don’t like-”
Tony shrugs nonchalantly and leans back in his seat. He sighs and rubs at his forehead. “Honestly, I don’t even know if it’s mine.”
“I’m all ears.”
“Wait. I didn’t say I’m afraid of you-”
Happy releases his grip on the teeenager and Flash moves quickly toward Peter.
“That party?”
The men don’t appear to be leaving any time soon and Peter quietly and carefully crawls away, holding his breath until he’s sure he’s out of earshot. He drops down to the floor and scurries away from the room and deeper into the base.
But then the nurse is bringing the baby over. Steve is instructed to open his hospital gown enough to expose his chest, and then the baby is gently being placed over him. It’s familiar, holding him this way, the only difference is the wires connecting the baby to a nearby monitor.
That wasn’t to say that Steve didn’t trust his friends with his son. They had been nothing but good to him since the day Peter came home. The little boy was spoiled and loved by everyone.
“He’s a kid,” Tony says softly and Steve nods. “He’s...how did this even happen?”
“Do it,” Tony urges, the anger taking full control now. “Come on! Do it!!”
Steve is up and at Tony’s side the second Tony freaks out. He tries to keep the amusement hidden, but he can’t help but crack a smile at his boyfriend’s reaction to their new dog licking him.
Steve frowns. “What am I looking at here?”
“Not yet.”
“Maybe you’re the perfect one.”
Steve sighs. “Yeah.”
But he wasn’t going to give up. He wanted Steve to be himself again, he wanted him to be happy and enjoy life again. That Steve was still in there. It was just going to take some time to get him back.
“Steve, wait. Don’t-” Tony tries again, only for Steve to ignore him and storm out of the room.
Steve unbuckles the belt and lets it hang loose in the loops of charcoal colored slacks. Tony’s breath picks up when Steve’s hand gets close to his aching cock. Steve peers up at the alpha, watching his face as he lowers the article of clothing down Tony’s legs. Tony takes over from there, removing the rest of his clothing and tossing them to the side.
Steve looks up. “It is? You don’t think it’s...bad?”
“Sorry, Petey.”
Peter runs into the hall, only to stop when he hears someone call out to him. He ignores the familiar voice and dashes into the bathroom. Before he can hide in one of the stalls, someone is running after him and gripping him tightly by the shoulder, forcefully turning him around.
“You okay?” Steve asks.
So sorry for not updating this one in awhile! I’m trying to plan out how I want to end it and all that stuff. This has been the longest story I’ve ever written 😬
“And your dad?”
The hug catches Tony off guard, but the second he rids himself of the shock, he embraces his son tightly, his own eyes filling with tears.
“Is that…'' Ned starts to say and Peter nods. “Cool! Can I meet him?”
“If it helps I see now why Tony can’t get enough of you. I’ve never seen him so happy. I don’t know what you did but he’s changed and in a good way.”
I’ll update soon! 😊
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve been asleep, Cap,” Are the first words Nick says. A scene like this has played out before, back when Steve had first woken up from his 65 year slumber.
The movie starts up again and this time Steve holds back the tears. When he does get weepy again, Natasha is there to hand him more tissues and hold him.
“Damn. He hasn’t come out at all?”
“I don’t recommend it.”
Tony frowns at the defensive tone his son was using. Peter was usually calm and collected; he didn’t have outbursts. Or maybe he did and Tony was starting to learn about it. There was still more he needed to learn about his son.
“Is she awake?” Natasha asks, coming over to join Tony on the sofa. She smiles at her niece when she finds her stirring. “Aww, baby girl what’s wrong?” Natasha coos, stretching out one finger to stroke along Morgan’s face.
“He’ll be fine.” It’s Tony who answers. He honestly has no idea what kind of issues they’re looking at when it comes to their son, but he wasn't about to worry Steve. They needed to stay calm.
“Dammit.” Steve runs a hand through his hair. “I made a promise.”
It was odd.
“Pete, we have something to tell you.”
Tony scoffs. “I had my moments. My mother loved me. I guess she was like yours. They did the best they could.”
Steve can’t help but shift when his stomach churns. He glances down quickly, hoping he didn’t wake his sleeping husband. Tony is still fast asleep. The nausea persists, making it difficult to lie still. Steve shuts his eyes and breathes through it, praying it goes away.
Tony’s feelings for the dog never shift to anything more. He keeps his space, as much as he physically can anyway. Wherever Steve goes, Dodger was sure to follow. They practically did everything together, and the only time Tony was free from the dirty mutt was when he was down in his lab.
“I know, I know.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and offers him a smile, hoping to shift his husband’s attitude. “I’m proud of you, honey. This was the first step and you did it.”
“He’s just like you remember.”
“We’re going to be brothers, Dodger!” Peter exclaims and hugs his best friend.
“First of all it was more than a minute. And second-” Flash pauses when he looks at the photo Peter holds up for him. He catches himself reaching out for it, only to retract his hand. “What the hell is that?”
“Let’s just say I've seen this before.” Sam grins and sits down beside his friend. He gets a glimpse of the sketch Steve is working on. “So you’re designing suits now? In that case I need an upgrade.”
“It’s...amazing. We get this,” Steve says and he places his hand over the spot where their son was currently kicking.
Ned is quick to mirror Peter’s expression, not even aware of the reason behind the excitement.
Pepper smiles. “He’s almost here. Pretty exciting.”
Harley breaks away from his brother’s grasp and crawls on the bed toward Steve, his nostrils flaring as he scents the stranger.
Bucky rips his hand away so that he and Natasha can lift Steve, but the Captain cries out and they’re forced to set him back down. There’s a pool of red around him now, the air filling with a mix of smoke and the strong stench of blood.
“Tony, you need to help me with him.” Her papa sounds irritated. The way he harshly scrambles the eggs is another indication that he was getting upset. Morgan sulks in the barstool, knowing a fight was going to break out.
Tony gets out of the car.
Tony shakes his head and grins. “Welcome home.”
Steve glances up when the door opens and Bucky steps into the room. “Hey,” Bucky smiles and comes closer. “How you feeling?”
“What’s going on here?” Steve asks, his gaze falling on the pile of jeans and then back up to his son’s huffing and puffing form. “Uh-oh. I know what’s going on.”
Bucky gives him another look over, clearly not convinced. “Okay. But if something changes you’ll actually tell me, right? Lord knows how many times you’ve kept things from me.”
The way Tony lives is exactly how Steve pictured a man with wealth could live. Each room was furnished with high quality products and designed with an elaborate taste. Steve can’t help but find it overwhelming. But then again, this was something he wasn’t used to. He grew up in a small one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, barely scraping by and counting on every penny. Tony was clearly born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
Peter nods his head and jumps up from the stairs. He moves shyly toward his brother. “Sorry, Harley. I won’t scare you no more.”
The image of their son appears on the screen and Tony leans closer in his seat to get a good look. The baby is curled up around itself. There’s no fluttering in the center or movement of any kind. Tony hadn’t felt the baby move yet like Steve had. He’s glad.
“Wow,” Tony breathes out, completely in awe. Holding his son for the first time is different and a part of him is scared of dropping him. “You’re so tiny. You’ll get bigger, though,” he tells his son. “Have you seen your papa? The guy’s massive.”
A fit of giggles from the other side of the room breaks out and James pulls away, curious as to what made his brother laugh so hard. Harley is running around the alpha sitting crossed legged in the middle of the room, giggling every time the stranger reaches out to tickle him whenever he’d pass by.
Tony has Jarvis perform more scans to check the baby’s health. He’s relieved to learn that no issues had been detected. Steve is just, if not more, relieved. He had been worried about his past health complications affecting his pup. He’s already lost one because of it.
“We need to be prepared for when this baby comes.” Steve places his hand over the bump, smiling at the thought of meeting his son for the first time. “He’ll be here soon.”
Tony doesn’t push for more. Instead, he holds Steve close until he’s drifting back to sleep.
“You're an amazing friend, too. Steve, are you sure you’re okay?” Natasha questions.
“Okay.” Steve nods. “It looks good by the way. Very festive.”
“I know. I’m just...scared.” The last word is said so quietly Steve wouldn’ve missed it if not for his enhanced hearing.
“Was my fault!” Tony yells.
“It didn’t seem like nothing. What got you so worked up? Hormones?”
“Do you think we should have waited to tell the team?” Steve asks from the adjoining bathroom.
“You taste like chocolate,” Steve murmurs against Tony’s lips.
“I don’t know.” That was definitely not the right answer because Tony is reaching for Steve’s shirt and throwing it at him. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
Steve ignores the order and tightens his grip around the beta’s neck, cutting off all air supply. He holds the syringe tightly and aims it for the beta’s neck.
“Why?”
“I won’t hurt him. Alpha will be mad if I do. But I can hurt you. You and I both know the punishment waiting for you.” Brock grips Steve roughly by the shoulder and forces him around. The gun is pressed into his lower back now. “Move. You’re gonna come with me out of here, quietly. One peep out of you and your friend down the hall gets his brains blown out.”
Peter doesn’t immediately go home after his first encounter with his dad. It would be too suspicious to come home early when his aunt and uncles believed he had gone to school. There was always telling them that he left school early because he couldn’t deal with being back, but that would just be another lie.
“It’s a little hard not to.”
I’m so sorry for my lack of updates! Life has been...a pain to be honest. My car was vandalized so that’s in the shop while I await for the expensive part to come in. I did get a dog to cheer myself and my son up. It’s helped. I swear I’m trying to update more but my schedule is a mess right now.
The door is opening and Tony jumps up from his seat. Steve steps out of the room, shooting Tony a small smile when their eyes meet.
Peter smiles. “Auntie Nat said the same thing.”
Peter wraps his arms around Tony’s neck and rests his head over his shoulder. Tony takes Peter to his room and tucks him into bed.
Tony is up before Steve, which usually isn’t normal, but Steve’s been through a lot the past few days and super soldier or not, his body needed rest. It’s tempting to stay in bed when Steve is so close and content against him, but they had plans for the day. Tony’s careful when he climbs out of bed, making sure not to disturb Steve from his much needed sleep.
“Did you have a good night?” Tony asks once they break apart.
“I wasn’t there when it happened. The explosion came out of nowhere; caught everyone off guard. Sam found Tony first-”
Peter smiles. “Yeah. And I’m gonna love him forever and ever and ever and ever!”
Maybe group therapy wouldn’t be so bad.
“No.”
“Thank you.” A small smile forms in the corners of Steve’s mouth.
Tony pays and it’s not long until they’re leaving the restaurant. Steve is just as quiet on the way home. He listens as Tony talks about work and his plans for the company. Steve was fine with the idea of Tony stepping down and letting Pepper running Stark Industries. Less time at the office meant more time at home. They wouldn’t be joining the team again any time soon, at least not until Peter was a little older and one of them could go off to help save the world.
“Oh um...yeah. I…I don’t know…”
“So…” Tony trails off, unsure what the hell he’s supposed to say next. He mentally kicks himself for not knowing how to act. He was better than this.
“I hope you’re right. Not a lot of them do.”
“What are you apologizing for?” The doctor asks, one brow quirking.
“Good morning, sir!” Jarvis sounds way too happy this early. “Happy birthday!”
It was Tony’s fears of screwing up something good that made him talk Steve into being the one to get pregnant. The last thing Tony wanted was for his body to reject their baby. He couldn’t imagine if that had happened. But luck was on their side and Tony was getting closer to his due date.
The rims of his eyes were inflamed, his cheeks were blotchy and wet, and his nose was red and dripping snot. Peter grabs more tissue to wipe away all of the evidence of his tears.
Dodger is there for all of Peter’s high and low moments. He’s there to offer warmth and comfort when Peter is sick or scared. He’s there to make Peter laugh, and he’s there to run around and play.
Happy huffs and glances down at the speedometer; he was already going fast, and any faster would be too dangerous.  “I would go faster but-” Happy pauses when Steve lets out another cry of pain. “-I’m going as fast as I can. We’ll be there soon okay?”
“Don’t ever blame yourself. The pain was too much and...that’s not your fault. I’m just glad you’re okay. I was so scared.”
Peter quickly gobbles down a piece of toast and grabs a banana on his wait out, shouting his goodbyes to his papa before shutting the door behind him. Happy is already waiting for him outside.
Steve nods his head. “Yes.”
Tony nods and gives Bucky one last look before moving toward the exit.
“Oh my God.” Tony groans and rises to his feet, moving toward the front of the long table and resting both hands against it. “I’m not taking anything up with him. At least not yet. I wanted to tell you first.”
Peter finds himself jumping between staying with his aunt and Uncle Sam and Bucky. The decision to pick just one household hasn’t been made yet, not when it was too difficult to make. Peter loved his aunt and uncles, and no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t replace what he lost. He appreciated their effort to try and fill the empty space. They were doing their best to make sure he was happy, but it was evident they were struggling to wear a brave face.
“Yeah!” Steve gets just as excited for his little girl. Seeing his mother and sister happy piques James’ interest and he crawls off the bed. Steve notices him and gestures for his son to come over. “It’s okay, James. Do you want to meet him?”
“Not really. I don’t know. I’m not waking up screaming like you and James, so I must be okay.”
“He’s a small grownup. Trust me he’s mature enough. If I can trust him with my life then I trust him with Morgan’s. It’s just for a couple of hours, remember?”
“Steve, look at me,” Tony says and Steve does. “You’re beautiful. You’re perfect. Let me see you. Let me see you enjoy this.”
“What is-”
“Let’s just go to bed. You’re obviously tired.”
Tony sighs. “There’s more. I swear I’ll tell you everything. Just don’t tell anyone where I’m at. If they ask, I’m on business okay? No one can know. Not Pierce-”
Steve winces at the memory. “The car. Oh God, Tony. I’m sorry.”
“I’m still scared.”
Tony scoffs. “Stop trying to save yourself. You’re still an idiot.”
Harley nods his head. “Kay!”
Tony smiles. “Yeah she is. And I’m still Harley’s favorite.”
His fingers begin to tighten and squeeze around Steve’s windpipe. The baby would lose oxygen. It would die and Tony wouldn’t have to worry anymore. He just needed to apply a little bit more pressure and-
“Steve, he was not this big, was he?” Tony asks his husband. Steve chuckles from the kitchen as he finishes up the last preparations for dinner. “I remember Peter having a face.”
“Daddy?” Peter mumbles into the crook of Tony’s neck.
It doesn’t happen right away, not that Steve was expecting it to, but he couldn’t help but wonder if their chance had finally come. He doesn’t want to get his hopes up, though. He’s done that way more times than he can count. But he can’t help but get those hopes up when Tony starts acting differently.
But it was ruined. Maybe his family couldn’t be mended. Maybe they were broken forever.
Steve groans and twists his fingers into the cotton sheets again. He’s not expecting the beta to touch him and when he feels Happy take his hand, he jumps.
James peers up at him, blue eyes full of tears. He sniffs. “Really?”
“Good.”
“I love you, too.” Tony turns back around and takes Steve’s hands, bringing his mate closer. “I love you so much. I mean it. I’m crazy about you, Steve. You think someone like me never existed, but it’s you I thought didn’t exist.”
Peter is in a good mood, which Tony is beyond grateful for. Last night had been a different story for the two-month-old; he had grown fussy after bath time and it took three rounds of
Steve makes himself comfortable in the chair beside his husband and takes his hand, rubbing it soothingly and encouraging Tony when the pain is at its worst. His stomach tightens again, this time more intense than before, and it pulls a pained gasp from him. Tony lifts his head from the pillows, a frown appearing over his face.
He’s at Steve’s side in seconds, taking his hand and intertwining their fingers. “I’m here. It’s okay,” Tony soothes.
“But…” Steve pauses and worries his bottom lip with his teeth. Tears spill from his eyes again. “I’m sorry. I turned your whole world upside down.”
“What do you think?” Tony asks.
“We can’t. It only happened once and we weren’t even sober. Unless you suggest we do this job while drunk then maybe I’ll consider.”
“I can still take you to school,” Tony has returned back to his tinkering. The boot was near completion, but there was no telling if he’d ever put them on it again. Right now it was just a distraction.
It shouldn’t be starting. If anything he was sure his ruts were over and a thing of the past. He blamed his age and the amount of stress his body was constantly under. He can’t even remember the last time he had one.
“Hey, where did this come from? We’re bringing him home, Steve. The doctor said-”
“Fuck,” Tony breathes out and gently runs his fingers through Steve’s hair. “Honey, that was amazing. I might need a minute.”
The beginning of the day started off with a big breakfast prepared by his uncle Sam. Peter had devoured the waffles the second the plate stacked with them was placed in front of him. He might have enjoyed them a little too much because his obnoxious eating didn’t sit well with his uncle Bucky. The morning sickness was kicking his butt hard.
Tony has to fight back the urge to protest. He stays silent instead as they stroll through the courtyard. There are others outside enjoying the fresh air and warm sun just like they were. Pretty soon it would just be Steve doing this. He’d be alone, or maybe, he’d make some friends during his stay. It would be good for him.
“I’ll live. You?”
Steve bites down on his bottom lip and his brows pinch together. He was used to scenes like this playing out differently. It was usually the alphas forcing him to do what they wanted.
“What stopped you?”
“It’s not. You’re upset. I guess I’m just tired from the nursery and-”
“Come here, kiddos. Daddy can you hug you too.”
“At least pretend to be happy. I know you’re good at that.”
Steve sighs harshly. “This is the last one. After this I’m hanging up the shield-”
“Not exactly,” Tony winces. “I haven’t told him yet okay! I don’t think I even want to. I just have my doubts and I want to make sure he’s really having my kid. Pepper already told me to kick him out and...and I can’t. I know I should but I can’t.”
“Are you okay?”
I hope you all enjoy this chapter! 😊
“Okay. I really want him to stay forever and ever and ever and ever-”
“Yep. And Harley is still asleep.”
“Is he okay?” Tony asks as soon as they’re outside and away from Steve’s sensitive hearing.
“So listen,” Steve begins and this time Peter turns toward him. “I know you haven’t decided about what you wanted to do, but I think it would be a good idea if you saw a doctor.”
“And crying,” Natasha rounds the sofa to take the empty spot beside him. She glances in the direction of the tv and a frown appears over her face. “Why are you watching
“I got Stark,” Clint says and Nat nods in approval.
Sam reaches out for the shield, holding it with both hands and staring down at the star in the center. He peers up at Peter again and tries the shield on.
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes. He ducks his head down to place soft kisses along Tony’s back. “Just relax. It’ll feel good.”
“Why?” Steve frowns. “Is something wrong?”
Aww they’re gonna get married. The three of them make such a cute family!!! I think this story probably has one more chapter and then it will be complete. It’s been a fun ride 😊
Becoming a dad was the last thing Tony ever expected. Sure he thought about it a few times, but that idea of starting a family was squashed the day he and Steve broke up. He never told Steve that he had pictured one day having children with him. It was too big of an idea to throw at Steve, especially when it was just a fantasy.
“You keep making that promise.”
Peter smiles. “Yeah.”
Maybe one day he could show his dad his new discovery, but for now Peter keeps this spot a secret. It would be his place to escape when life became too much. It would be his hiding place.
Steve whines and his hands grip Tony’s head, trying to bring him closer. “Don’t tease me, Stark.”
No more missions; Steve kept his word and hung up the shield. It was a temporary hiatus. He’d probably continue saving the world once the baby was born, but for now he was home and preparing for their little one.
“You’re good, Steve. You’re a good person, a good mother, a good omega.”
They’re left panting and curled up in each other’s arms by the end. Steve lets a contented sigh and buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent only Tony can bring.
He was having a baby.
Tony nods and turns to walk away, only to stop when Steve calls out to him.
Tony wishes he could pull Steve into his arms and comfort him. “I know. Honey, I know. It’s not your fault.”
“He won’t find you or the baby. I promise.”
“Be better than me. I’m not perfect, kiddo.”
Steve smiles sadly at his husband and gently runs his fingers through his soft, dark hair. “I guess it’s getting bad now, huh?”
“How’s Tony Junior?” Tony’s hands find their way to the spot where their son was growing and currently stretching. Tony smiles from the movement and rubs his hand over the bump. “He’s gonna be a stinker.”
“Draw,” Steve finally supplies an answer.
“He’s fine,” Tony assures. He immediately senses his omega’s distress and he comes over to console him. “Honey, he’s okay. This is his room, remember?”
It’s an adjustment when they bring him to the compound for the first time, but it’s also relieving. Peter was stronger now and showing no signs of any complications. He was absolutely perfect.
Steve winces again and places a hand over his belly. “Maybe I pushed myself a little too hard today.”
“He’s nice,” Peter says once they’re alone. “He’s just...the opposite of his name.”
They are my favorite characters and I will always go down with this ship! I just wanted to write something different.
“He’s fine,” Tony assures. “All he does is sleep and poop.”
Steve sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “Maybe it’s not him. Maybe I’m too hard on him.”
“Sort of...I’m working it out.”
“Me, too. Bye, Cap.”
It’s comforting to be back home, but that ache for his son is still present and only worsens when Steve is greeted with a large order of baby items. He had forgotten that Tony asked FRIDAY to place one for essentials.
This time Steve does whine and his eyes clench shut. His body protests but he ignores his discomfort and keeps going.
“Daddy’s home!” Tony exclaims, finding delight in the way his son reacts to his presence. It was always going to make his heart burst with joy.
“It won’t be easy.”
Happy sighs harshly. “Not very convincing, kid.”
“Now I know you’re not kidding.”
“I’m gonna head upstairs. Goodnight.”
“Yeah.” Steve can’t help but smile. “It’s crazy.”
“Y-yes! Tony, it feels...good!”
Peter was going to have to do everything, and judging by the looks of it, he would be doing it alone.
Steve clings to him tightly. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have left.”
“No but you-”
“I should’ve done more. I did this. Tony, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Uncle Bucky is the best :)
Steve sighs harshly. “I did yeah but...but I still went to my mother when something was wrong. Peter is avoiding us. Last night he didn’t even want to watch tv with us.”
Sam finally looks Steve’s way and shoots the omega a smile. Steve stops in his tracks, nostrils flaring as he scents the alpha.
“Well I am plastered on billboards and magazine covers.”
“I wasn’t that much older. I was in college and happened to meet your dad at a party. Your Auntie Nat threw it and-”
“You will. Sit down.”
“Steve?” Happy’s voice tears through his thoughts. Steve peers up at him with glistening eyes. “Just hold on.”
His attention is stolen when the sound of feet padding against the floor reaches his ears. Tony shuffles into the kitchen, a look of discomfort written on his face. Steve’s question is answered when Tony rubs at the small of his back, wincing from what Steve can only assume is another back ache.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky apologizes, his voice soft and laced with hurt, the words Peter had said still stinging.
Steve hums in agreement. “Yeah. I guess taking in a dirty mutt from off the streets was a good idea, huh?”
Tony shakes his head, then he turns and leaves. The door slams shut.
“Anyway,” Tony begins and rises to his feet, making sure Harley is still secure in his arms, “mama has somewhere important to be and you kiddos are staying with Uncle Happy.”
Steve clings to Tony tightly and sobs. “I-I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.”
“I can’t.” Steve shakes his head. More tears are beginning to form and stream down his face. “It hurts.”
“Fuck,” he says in a breathy tone. Steve takes him in his hand, stroking the heated flesh and smearing the precum at the tip. Tony moans and kisses Steve again, this time with more urgency. “Steve, honey, you’re gonna make me-oh fuck-”
Steve blushes again.
Peter chuckles. “Name it what? I don’t even know if I’m keeping it.”
After the party had ended and everyone had left-Steve had tried to get Bruce to stay, but the doctor assured him he was fine and they’d see him again for his next appointment-all that was left to do was take their son’s new items and place them in the nursery. The room was slightly bare except for the bassinet, a changing table, and a rocking chair Tony had set up. Steve didn’t like the idea of their son sleeping so far away and the bassinet would later be moved to the master bedroom once Peter was born.
“It’s not the stuff, Tony,” Steve sighs and moves toward the rocking chair, deciding he needed a break from the trip up the stairs. “It’s me.”
After a long, excruciating twenty hours, Peter Benjamin Stark is born. He weighs a little over seven pounds and all ten fingers and ten toes are accounted for. He’s beautiful in every sense of the word.
Morgan is placed in Tony’s arms and is greeted with kisses and hugs. Steve makes sure to give her a kiss on the head before stepping away to finish the packing.
Tony drops the topic and continues to follow his son until they’re stepping into the common room. It’s decorated in Independence Day colors, but all Tony can see is Steve. He wonders if Steve really did stick around to check on his family. Maybe he’d be lucky to feel Steve’s presence the way Peter can.
Steve sniffs and uses one hand to wipe away the tears. His hand finds its way to his stomach. It’s a terrifying thought to know that just beneath his fingertips a tiny life is beginning to grow. It was unplanned and terrifying, but at the same time, he can’t help the spark of joy that courses through him.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Not really. But yeah...you were right. I don’t know why I ignored the signs. They were right there this whole time.”
“I’m sorry. I never should’ve-I don’t know why I thought-”
They go to all the doctor appointments and continue to shop and act like they would be keeping this baby. Or at least Steve acts that way. It was only a matter of time before Steve’s body failed for the third time.
“No no, Pete,” Steve scolds. Peter’s eyes shine bright with tears and he reaches for the block. “Don’t put this in your mouth. You do this,” Steve says, placing the wet block on top of another to create a small tower. “See? Like that.”
Morgan is fussy, her face pink and scrunched up. Tears are streaming down her face and her cries rise in volume. Tony does everything he can to get his daughter to calm down, but all of his attempts fail. She refuses a bottle when it’s offered and the soft rocking that usually calms her only makes her feel worse.
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “You’re still mad, huh?”
“He’s trying for another,” Natasha butts in with a wink.
Then an idea comes to mind. He ponders it for a moment, a part of him torn but the other half urging him to make another phone call.
Tony frowns and takes his hand off Steve’s shoulder. “Let me know if you do. I can follow directions.”
Steve nods, but it’s difficult to believe those words. He had gotten used to trying to figure out how to take care of one baby, and now he was adding another to the mix and throwing everything off. It was terrifying. He couldn’t imagine doing something wrong and hurting his children.
Steve frowns. He honestly hates the idea of bouncing their son back and forth like that, but that was their situation. It wasn’t going to change.
“Why did you really let me in your car, Tony?”
Peter huffs again and slants in his seat, arms folding over his chest. His eyes drift in the direction of his other uncle, watching as he struggles again and again to get a response. Eventually he gives up.
“Only a little.” Bucky winks.
“I blame you.” Tony jabs a finger in Steve’s chest.
Tony doesn’t bother stopping him again when Steve makes another attempt to leave. He can feel Tony’s gaze following him, but he forces his own to remain forward. He can’t bring himself to look at him again.
“I know.” Sam nods. “Not having Steve around has been-”
“It’s no problem. If you want I can just carry this little guy upstairs.”
Peter immediately props himself up on one of his elbows and turns to face his father. “Are we both giving up the superhero stuff?”
Having Bruce around is comforting and Steve finds himself relaxing and enjoying the party. He spends most of his time chatting with Bruce, and eventually joining a conversation that Happy has started. The other beta still came off as unsure when he was around Steve, but the omega didn’t take offense to his attitude. He understood that he was new to Tony’s group and it was going to take time until he was welcomed.
That urge wasn’t going to go away any time soon, probably not ever. The alpha in him wants nothing more than to protect the omega and his pup. And that’s exactly what he’s going to do.
Peter gulps and peers down at his lap.
“Pete-” Tony takes a step forward, then freezes when Peter shakes his head and steps back.
“And you will be. But you need care too.”
Sam follows after his husband, knowing Bucky was probably heading to their apartment to distract himself with Alpine. He finds Bucky in the kitchen, hunched over the sink and on the verge of vomiting. Sam rushes to his side, laying a comforting hand over Bucky’s back as he dry heaves.
Poor Steve. I swear he loves Morgan and doesn't hate her. He's just dealing with a lot right now. I will be showing some of his perspective in the next few chapters.
Bruce and Thor are occupying the chairs underneath the window, both holding gifts. Thor this time has chosen a more appropriate gift and he has a stuffed bear dressed to resemble him. Bruce has a bundle of balloons. There’s no sign of Clint, or Bucky and Sam. Steve’s heart sinks.
“Hey, kiddo, talk to me. I know you hate those dreams, but it’s good to talk about them.”
“You didn’t-”
“Forget it,” he huffs with a shake of his head. “It’s not like we’re having sex tonight anyway.”
Steve trembles, eyes going wide in fear. “I-I-”
The kiss never comes.
Tony stirs in his sleep, eyes fluttering open and an annoyed sigh leaving him. “I was having a good dream. You both ruined it.”
There’s not an immediate response from the AI. Tony frowns.
Tony glances at Peter, getting a small nod. “Okay, fine. I wasn’t there because...honestly, I didn’t even know he had passed. I found out days later.”
“Y-yeah.” Steve hates how shaky he sounds and he gestures for Tony to come in. He tries to wrap his arms around himself to hide the hump, but the days of hiding his belly were over. It was very obvious what kind of situation Steve was in.
“You gonna come?” Tony asks, snapping his hips forward and emitting a loud moan from the omega.
Tony was wishing he had created that suit of armor.
Their moment is cut short when the sound of feet on the stairs can be heard. Harley rushes into the living room first, followed by Sarah and then James. The oldest is quiet when he comes down, not even muttering a greeting. He sits down on the sofa and distantly watches the tv show.
He doesn’t let Steve take full control. Tony liked to be the one to take the lead and give his partners an unforgettable experience. Maybe that was just his ego talking but he didn’t have a reputation for nothing.
“I’m not doing that. I’m not forcing him to like a color because society says it’s meant for one gender only. And there is blue...with some white and red. It’s your birthday too so maybe I should add-”
“Pete,” Steve calls out softly to grab his son’s attention. He doesn’t get a response at first. Peter’s eyes are glued to the wall straight ahead and his right leg hasn’t stopped shaking since he sat down on the exam bed. “Petey,” Steve tries again and this time he gets attention.
Pierce is gasping, his eyes wide and lips tainted red. He crawls toward Steve, reaching out for him. “P-please?”
Steve sniffs. “You’re not just saying that?”
“Yeah?” Tony replies.
“Hey,” Tony says and he cups Steve’s face with both hands. “I’m not him. I’m not going to hurt you.”
“What’s your most traumatic memory?” Peter asks.
“You won’t.”
“Or call you.”
The alpha snarls. Of course Jarvis would betray him.
Steve whines when Tony hits that spot inside him again. He’s so close to his release. He tries to hold back, reminding himself that only the alpha can reach orgasm first. He needs permission.
“No.”
“Not really. Usually it’s just a huge celebration and I end up drunk at the end. Honestly it can be skipped. I’m too busy to be throwing parties.”
I’ll probably show a little bit of Steve’s life with Peter and then do a time skip. Just gonna be honest but some of those tags are coming into play soon....sorry 😞
Tony sighs. “I don’t know,” he says with a shrug and takes a drink from his cup. He directs his gaze out the window, taking in the heavy but usual traffic. “I guess I feel off about it. I should remember something, right?”
Steve stares at the alpha. He has questions, but his inability to speak has been lost. Tony can read his mind and he comes closer until he’s standing beside the omega. He lays a hand over Steve’s shoulder and rubs the spot gently.
“Nah. When did you get a chance to do this anyway?”
“Relax,” Tony soothes. “It’s just JARVIS.”
He wishes Pepper could be on his arm right about now, but she was caught up with work that couldn’t be delayed. He should've given her the night off so that she could tag along and be bored with him.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” he says as calmly as he can, “I just want my son. That’s it.”
His confession is heartbreaking. Tony never did learn how many pups there had been in total. He’s almost afraid to know. But his curiosity gets the best of him.
“Why are you acting so childish? He needs a middle name! You have one don’t you!”
“No! No, Tony it’s not like that.”
“He’ll be perfect.” Steve smiles proudly. He had faith that his son would be a great addition to the team. It was more than just his unique abilities that made Steve believe this. Peter was a smart, caring, selfless kid. He had all the right characteristics a hero should have.
Tony smiles down at him. “Aw, kiddo you’re working yourself up. Why are you being a stinker, huh? I thought we made a deal?”
Steve wishes it could be that simple. He had no idea what they were up against. He’s practically seen it all over the years, but that didn’t give him the confidence he desperately needed. Something this time around didn’t feel right.
Tony claimed that he didn’t care what Steve looked like. He even went as far as to say that Steve had never looked more beautiful. It’s all a lie. It had to be. There was no way Tony truly believed that.
Tony gets in first and makes sure to take a deep breath to calm himself before Peter joins him. Peter is just as excited about being inside the car than he was just looking at it. A bright smile appears on his face.
“Fuck you,” Peter shoves past Flash, hot tears running down his face.
Sam sighs and leans forward in his seat, clasping his hands together. “He’s right. This isn’t the time to discuss replacements. If Peter wants to eventually take Cap’s place then great. And if he wants to meet Tony...I guess that’s okay too.”
Steve shrugs and sits down in the chair opposite of Tony. He takes his napkin and lays it neatly over his lap. “I said I can cook but nothing fancy. This-” he waves his hand over the food they’ve prepared. “-isn’t fancy, Mr. Stark.”
Tony silences Steve with another kiss. “I want to,” he says once they break apart. He cups Steve’s face in his hands, smoothing his thumb over the soft skin of Steve’s cheek. “I want to make you happy. I love you so much and if a baby is what you want, then we’ll do it.”
“Not a good enough reason to invite him into your car!”
Tony frowns. “You mean like a stalker? I’ve had tons.”
“He wouldn’t hurt her-”
“I’ll work on the nursery tomorrow,” Tony says as they enter the master bedroom.
“Yeah.” Steve smiles and adjusts the blanket around Harley’s sleeping form. “I can’t believe I have...a baby. Me. It hasn’t hit yet. Not really.”
“Not even Nat?”
As a kid he often dreamed of following in his father’s footsteps. The shield was a symbol to everyone, but it was the person behind the shield that Peter looked up to the most. He didn’t want to be Captain America, he wanted to be like Steve.
Tony drops down in front of his son and retracts his helmet. “Pete, I’m sorry. I never meant-”
“What do you want me to say?”
Tony reaches his office and immediately shuts Happy out. He wants to be alone, but he knows it won’t be for long. He had received numerous missed calls and messages from Pepper within the last few days, and that's what finally got his ass back into the city and away from the quiet life he had been living.
“You’ll like Happy too. I promise he’s not a bad guy. Listen-” Tony takes Steve’s hands again. “-if I have to go back then Happy will stay here and keep an eye on you. I’ll make sure I won’t be gone long.”
The omega carefully steps into the room, eyes glued to the man just a few feet away. The alpha’s presence doesn’t have Steve cowering and wanting to run in the opposite direction. Steve still keeps his guard up. Learning to trust alphas was going to take time.
Steve sighs harshly. “What about the team? We’re supposed to be doing this job together and now you’re just going to walk away?”
She kisses the top of his head before leaving the room and closing the door behind her.
Steve snaps his head up. “Yeah. Yeah I did. It fits him, right? He looks like a Harley.”
Steve smiles. “Thanks, kid. We really appreciated this.”
Tony huffs loudly and slants back in his seat. He doesn’t bother signing the contracts, nor does he call Steve’s number.
He wonders if his apology has even been heard. The omega has grown silent.
Happy just rolls his eyes and promises he’ll be nearby if he was needed. Tony thanks him and closes the door.
“Yeah. But not too crazy, right? I told Natasha that it was and...I don’t know...I feel bad about it. I’m terrified, but at the same time I...I love him so much and...sorry, I’m not making any sense.”
“He’s good. How are they?”
“You wouldn’t have left then. You wouldn’t have taken her away.”
He doesn’t give up and instead focuses on the good he still had left in his life.
Peter frowns. “That sounds exhausting. I guess I just want...something normal.”
“I’ll keep you safe,” Steve says, his voice soft as he begins rocking his son soothingly. “James, I love you so much. I’m sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m here now and I’m never leaving you again.”
They make their way toward the master bedroom where Tony takes over and lays Peter down in his bassinet. Steve excuses himself to say goodnight to the rest of their children.
“I’m not scared of him,” Flash says, then he adds, “Well, a little. But I’m scared of the baby more.”
Sam chuckles and wraps his arms around Bucky again. “You’re a little overbearing. He needs space to...process this. But he also needs to be a kid. Let him have fun. He needs it.”
“Steve was a good father. He did everything he could to make sure his son was happy, safe, and loved. He did all those things until the very end.”
But Steve isn’t in any harm. In fact, he’s never looked so at peace. He smiles tiredly when he enters the penthouse and shuffles over to where Tony is feeding their youngest on the sofa.
But even though he had the suit and he placed some of his daddy’s gel in his hair, he still didn’t like the reflection staring back at him. Something was missing.
“You’re a dork, kid.”
“It is, isn’t it?” Alexander cuts through their moment. He steps closer and stretches out a hand, his fingers wrapping around the back of Steve’s shirt and pulling him back. Tony growls and lurches forward, only to be held back from the chains. “This is his fault. He ran away, disobeyed orders, went against his alpha.”
The progress was slow and had a few bumps along the way, but it was worth the wait. Steve was laughing and smiling again, but most importantly, he was a father again. He never failed to show their daughter just how much she meant to him. She was his everything. She was his whole world.
“But tv sounds nice. I’m a little-” Steve stops himself. He can’t say he’s from a different time period. Even if he wanted to he wasn’t sure how. It had been difficult to tell Tony, and he can’t imagine trying to inform Happy, someone he barely knows. “-behind I guess,” he finishes.
“Steve,” The doctor is coming over now, laying a hand over his shoulder and trying to coax him away. “I know you want to be here but I still need to examine you.”
“I think he’s capable of being a nice kid. But really take the time to get to know him. I just don’t want you to get hurt.”
Steve shakes his head again and pulls Tony in for another kiss. “It has to be tonight,” he says, breaking the kiss for a moment, then he kisses Tony again.
“Isn’t it a little late for ice cream?” Steve raises one questioning brow at her. She only smirks and peels off the lid.
He reaches out, only to catch himself and retract his hand. Steve takes his hand and leads it to the bump, smiling softly.
Now, though, he was going to have to figure out how to fit a child into their already chaotic life.
Steve hums into the kiss. “Why do you?” he retorts, breaking the kiss for a second before connecting their lips again.
“Me too. I’ll take it slow. No rushing. You call all the shots okay? I dont...I can’t hurt you again. But...I feel something for you. I don’t know if it’s because of the baby or just these past few days…I don’t know. But I like you. A lot.”
“That’s right,” Steve nods, “you’re so smart, sweetheart.”
Peter winces just at the thought of having to tell both the father and his parents. He already knows his parents would be upset and disappointed. And Flash...well, he wouldn’t step up. He would probably treat Peter worse than he already does. It was better not to say anything.
“You did.”
He didn’t know what to do. He was scared.
Captain America was a legend; a hero. He was a symbol. He stood up against the bullies. He fought hard for his country and the people that needed someone to look up to. He was a soldier, an Avenger. But to others he was more than that.
“Shit!” Tony gasps and both hands cradle Steve’s belly. “You’re-wow. How did this happen? I mean I know how but I didn’t think it would...sorry, I’ll shut up.”
“If that kid knew half the shit about Stark then he’d probably side with us,” Bucky says angrily.
Tony is content with that response. He knew how stubborn his husband could be. Getting Steve to admit that something was wrong and to get checked out by a medical professional was usually difficult.
“Oh shit! The Tony Stark? How’d that happen?”
Natasha smiles sympathetically. “I know. Don’t worry. It gets easier.”
His doctor appointments were once a month, preferably in the morning after he’s gone on a run. He doesn’t push himself like he used to; he’s careful with everything he does. The life he was given to carry and nurture was too delicate for him to put at risk. Steve promised to be the best parent he could possibly be, and that’s exactly what he was going to do.
Tony’s confused as to why he was dragged away to meet with Alexander, but the nicely decorated room is the perfect escape from the party. For once Tony was getting tired of mingling and talking about himself.
“You’re not gonna do anything stupid. You have a kid now...by the way you need to catch me up to speed on that.”
“Yeah. Don’t know what came over me.”
I just want to say thank you to everyone who’s enjoyed this story and left wonderful comments and kudos. To the ones that didn’t enjoy it...I’m sorry. I tagged everything correctly and this was intended to be a dark!Tony fic. I have nothing against him. He’s one of my favorite characters. I just wanted to try writing something different, and if that upset you then I’m sorry. But I’m not sorry for writing this piece.
“He’s still tiny,” Bruce adds.
Yay Peter is on the way! Dodger is going to love and protect him forever :)
“Okay,” Sam tries to defuse the situation. He comes closer until the teenager allows him to pull him into a tender embrace. “We won’t mess anything up.”
“Yeah. I’ll see you later, Da-Mr. Stark.”
He’s terrified.
“I don’t have a favorite. I appreciate the help. Peter would probably try to help and end up playing with the toys.”
“I’m sorry. I tried to go but I just couldn’t-all I could think about was him and...I’m sorry. I’m sorry for lying and seeing my dad. I just felt so alone and I just wanted to know what he was like. He’s not a bad guy.”
“My water broke.”
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “You know me so well.”
“Rough day?” Sam asks when he notices the frown on Peter’s face. He notices something else and his brows furrow at the logo on Peter’s sweatshirt. “MIT?”
Peter leaves out the fact that he hasn’t seen his dad in a few days. He also leaves out the part about skipping school and rushing to Stark Industries, hoping to bump into his dad again. It was pathetic but how else was he supposed to keep in contact? It wasn’t like they swapped numbers.
“You really want to know?” Steve asks, grunting softly as he pushes himself up into a sitting position. Tony steps in to assist. “Thanks,” Steve tells him, wincing again when he shifts.
Pepper sobs loudly and this time Bruce comforts her with more than just a tissue. He wraps his arms around her and she holds him tight, sobbing into his chest.
“Even when you both knew she needed help,” Steve says, his tone full of irritation.
Maybe it’s time Tony came back...
“What? I’m just wondering-”
“It’s not pathetic! We really were-”
“Are you keeping the...you know?” Ned whispers the last part just in case someone could hear them. Peter knows his parents wouldn’t just barge in without knocking first.
“It sounds amazing. Maybe next time I can experience all of those things.”
Bucky lays a comforting hand over his shoulder and it’s enough to calm his nerves. It isn’t until Peter starts crying does Steve switch back into panic mode.
Bucky answers instead. “Obviously not. He’s been going behind our backs and then lying to us. Did you think we wouldn’t find out? Did you think we were stupid?”
“My turn,” Tony says, pushing his way through and pecks Steve on the lips. “Sorry we’re late for lunch. Someone wasn’t fast enough.”
Steve straightens up and wipes at his nose. Natasha is still watching him warily. He doesn’t have the heart to tell her that he’s leaving. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone anymore.
Tony lies back and spreads his legs, breath hitching when Steve pops the lid of the lube open and coats his fingers generously. He traces a wet finger around Tony’s presented hole, teasing the area for a moment before slipping it inside. Tony groans and his head tips back against the pillow. Steve keeps going, adding another finger and stretching the tight hole until he deems it ready.
Hi! So I guess this chapter is a bit of a filler. I hope you don’t mind and enjoy it anyway! 😊
“He needs his father,” Bucky states. No one disagrees.
“You won’t. Go be with your family. They need you.”
There’s a moment of silence between them before Steve continues. “Do you think...do you think we have him for a reason?”
Bucky frowns. “Last night you said differently.”
“He’s so wet,” The alpha groans and rolls his hips, the sound echoing loudly in the room.
“The press,” is all Tony has to say. Steve whines softly and hugs his oldest child close. The change of his scent only worsens, the sour smell wafting through the space around them. “It’s okay,” Tony assures and takes his mate’s hand. “We'll be okay.”
Peter yawns and his eyes flutter open, immediately settling on Steve’s smiling face. He probably can’t see the other two figures crowding around him, but he can scent them. He isn't fussy around them, probably due to the fact that they smell like mama too. They weren’t a threat.
“Sort of. It’s okay.”
“I had no control,” Steve is quick to remind. The tone he’s using is dangerous in front of an alpha. A part of him is ready to apologize and beg for forgiveness like he’s been taught, but the other half urges him against it. He didn’t apologize to anyone anymore.
“I guess I don’t see how. I’m-” He doesn’t dare finish that thought. She probably wouldn’t be able to handle the truth, even if he tried to tweak it. “I don’t really fit in,” he eventually says, and it’s true. He doesn’t fit in this new world. He doesn’t know how to be an omega here. He doesn’t know how to be himself.
“Yeah. Bucky and I would always go to this one place when we were younger. God, I bet it doesn’t even exist anymore.”
“Steve, it’s a week away. You don’t have to-”
“Not really. That’s your job.”
Bucky places a hand over his belly, his daughter pressing back gently against his palm. “Good. She’s wide awake now.”
Dodger huffs and whines, wanting Tony to move so he can take his favorite spot near Steve. Tony understands, and with a roll of his eyes he moves out of the way. “It’s my baby, too,” Tony huffs, chuckling when he gets a bark in response.
He can’t help but hope that one day he’d have his family back together again. He wonders if his papa would’ve wanted the same thing.
“Sometimes. I had one now, and it was pretty scary.”
Tony sighs. “I’m sorry, kid. That project was supposed to be for me but I thought maybe you’d benefit from it.”
Tears are streaming down his face, making it impossible to see clearly. He pauses his packing to take a deep breath and wipe at the tears, then with his vision clear, he resumes shoving clothes into the backpack.
“I do?”
“Of course.”
The invitation that he received had gone in the trash, but his assistant, Pepper, informed him that his presence was expected at the event. Tony had scoffed and rolled his eyes. He knew why he was their guest of honor. They just wanted his money.
“But what are you gonna be?” Tony frowns.
“Shh.” Bucky shushes and holds Peter perfectly in his arms. “I can hold a kid, Steve. I had four of them I had to take care of.”
“Only by a little.” Tony smirks.
“Yeah, well, that was before I just had a baby.”
“Tony, please? Just don’t.”
“Are you sure?” Bruce still sounds concerned. Steve nods and Bruce lets it go. “All right. Let me know if anything changes. I don’t mind hopping on a fight back here if I need to.”
The dirty thoughts that enter his mind quickly become something he can’t ignore. He wonders if it’s from the sounds Tony’s making or the fact that his husband is partially naked. Tony had decided he didn’t want to wear pants. They were home so it didn’t matter if he chose to wear pants or be completely naked. Steve would've honestly hoped for the latter.
Peter’s face heats up at those words. Ned was always going to be the person Peter was most excited to see, but lately he had been wanting to be near Flash more than usual.
“Shit. He’s not answering and I really need him to get home.”
His idea of something else ends up being a pair of sweatpants. It’s not cool enough for him to get away with wearing them, but it was better than going around school with his pants open.
“The baby looks good. Can Jarvis-”
Steve chuckles and makes his way toward the door. “I’ll see what I can find. We’ll go shopping this weekend.”
Steve offers a smile, hoping it would bring some sort of reassurance to his friend. It seems to relax Sam a bit, at least enough for him to drop the conversation and allow Steve to walk away.
Natasha shrugs and gestures with her chin the glass meant for Sam. He grumbles and accepts it.
The baby appears too small and it’s skin is a pale gray. Blood and other fluids cover it from head to toe, it’s light hair matted down against its head. The baby doesn’t move. It doesn’t cry.
“Is he okay?” Bruce appears the most concerned.
Morgan’s cries have gotten louder, more urgent. Tony’s not sure if it’s because she can sense that she’s so close to getting her fill, or she’s picking up on Steve’s irritation. Maybe it’s both.
Steve chokes back a sob and that’s when Tony wraps him in a hug. Steve buries his face into Tony’s chest, muffling his sobs and staining the front of Tony’s shirt. He apologizes over and over. Tony just holds him.
The recovery room is huge, but that was to be expected when Tony was behind the designs. He had wanted to give birth and recover from said birth comfortably. Perhaps he had gone overboard with the room, but Tony lived a luxurious lifestyle and it made sense that he’d choose to give birth the same way.
“Sorry about that,” Tony quickly apologizes for his absence. He takes his original seat across from Steve. “Just had to meet with someone.”
“I don’t care. I just want to go.”
He must have picked up Steve’s scent. The omega sighs in response.
“Yeah. Sorry I forgot. You can’t cancel?”
“What thing?” Steve asks. He’s stopped trying to fight with Harley over the vegetables.
“Good.” Tony smiles and presses a kiss to the top of his daughter’s head. “Did papa make coffee?”
“It’s good for you and the baby,” Steve says. “Just eat what you can.”
Sam smiles and waves at the pups. “What’s up, little dudes?”
“I’ll try. Maybe daddy would be better suited for this job.”
Steve nods and he finds himself drifting back to sleep now that Peter has stopped crying. It’s not until he hears the sound of Tony’s feet against the floor and small whimpers does his eyes shoot open. The bedside lamp is turned on, its once dim glow now too bright.
“Hey, Happy,” Peter greets after he’s climbed in the backseat.
He finds Steve still asleep and curled up in a ball. He looks so small and vulnerable. It’s heartbreaking to see him this way. There was more that still needed to be revealed about Steve and his past, but it was a delicate topic and Tony wasn’t about to push him. He’d patiently wait for Steve to get more comfortable.
But it’s not the odd contraption that piques Tony’s interest. The figure strapped to it is difficult to ignore.
Natasha had only smirked.
He squeezes Bucky’s metal hand as hard as he can, and bears down when he’s instructed by the doctor. The moment had finally come and he’d be welcoming his son into the world. The hours had been long and difficult, but it was called labor for a reason. But like Bucky had said, it would be worth it.
Nick chuckles lightly. “I doubt it. Considering the way you’ve been living these past years.”
“Yeah.”
“Please!” Tony cries and the video pauses, right on Steve’s smiling face. Tony stares at the image, into Steve’s eyes, wishing he could be staring into the real thing. Tony releases a choked sob and glances down, unable to watch the video. “Please, J. I can’t. It....it hurts. Please…”
“You’ll never feel it.” Tears are streaming down Steve’s face. He keeps his fingers wrapped tight around the front of his husband’s suit jacket. His husband. That word didn’t feel right anymore. Tony wasn’t his husband. He was a- “You’re a monster. A killer.”
Peter takes the book, noticing the worn out cover.
“It's a shame.” Pierce mocks sympathy. “Stark would’ve done wonders for us. I’ll just have to mate you with another alpha.”
“Whoa hang on. Disown you? I’m not disowning you, kiddo. I’m just…” Tony trails off with a sigh. “I’m scared. And yeah I know this is happening to you and not me but...but it still scares me that you have to deal with this.”
“Hey, sleepyhead.” She smiles down at him. Peter yawns and sits up to stretch, his hair is even messier than before.
Peter gnaws away on his bottom lip for a second before huffing, “No.”
“Yeah,” Tony sighs. “I guess. This isn’t a stupid idea, right?”
His phone chirps in his pocket and he reaches into his jeans to get it. There’s a message from his papa.
“No,” Peter shakes his head. He grows nervous all of sudden, and his stomach grows queasy again. He glances at the small trash can in the corner of the room, contemplating if he’ll need it. He decides he doesn’t and takes long, slow breaths to calm himself. “I’m gonna get an abortion.”
Natasha nods and intervenes. “Steve, you okay?” she asks.
“You did good by the way,” Sam compliments. “I know it’s scary talking in front of everyone, but you did good.”
They needed to talk. They need to sit down and be honest with each other, lay everything out instead of keeping it bottled in. That was the root of the problem. It would be easy to blame Steve’s depression or the stress brought on from having a new baby, but the reality of it all was the lack of communication between them. Talking had never been one of their strong suits. It took awhile for them to get where they were now, and Tony wasn’t about to let them take any steps back.
Tony waggles his eyebrows at Steve. “Oh I will.”
“Okay. Night. I love you.”
“Like who? Him? I told you I wasn’t. I could’ve left you on the street, I could’ve taken you back to Pierce when he came sniffing around. But I didn’t! I fucking cared about you and that pup! Look what I did!” Tony gestures angrily around the large property surrounding them. “Was it not enough? If I didn’t care then I wouldn’t have brought you here. I wouldn’t have made sure you felt safe.”
They still need a name for their baby...of course you guys already know what it’s going to be haha. And they need to figure out how to be parents and the feelings they obviously still have for each other. But the team gets to meet the baby soon!
Being bonded was still an experience Steve struggled to describe. Sometimes he wondered if it was even reality. For so long he believed that he would never find a mate and he’d be under Hydra’s control forever. But then Tony rescued him and promised him happiness and freedom, he promised him a life worth living.
“Steve, you probably did the same thing.”
“Wait.” Tony reaches out to take Steve’s hands. He holds them tightly, forcing Steve to stop wringing them so anxiously. “Wait. I know we’ve been good right now, but that’s now. What about later? What if I-what if we can’t keep this up? I don’t want to hurt you or Pete. I don’t.”
“You can. We can start over.”
Nick holds onto hope as he makes his way to greet the Avenger. For years Captain Rogers has been under strict observation. The last thing the Director needed was another error in his project.
Tony doesn’t move. He blinks a few times. “Would it-would it matter? Of course it would matter. Why would you say that?”
, that voice likes to taunt. And it’s right. Tony does deserve to be left alone. He lost everything.
For the most part it does the trick. Peter’s eyes bright up, and not just from the tears. His eyes are a little red and puffy, but at least he had stopped crying. Maybe he was getting stronger.
Tony takes Steve by the hand and smiles softly. “Let’s go to bed. For once I don’t want to think about them. I just want to be with my fiancé.”
James still doesn’t appear convinced. He doesn’t move away when Steve comes closer and this time allows Steve to reach out and touch him.
“I’m not, honest.” Tony holds his hands up. “But coffee sounds good.”
“Sleep well?” Tony questions.
His body was supposed to change to accommodate the life that took nearly nine months to grow. He knew that the pregnancy was going to bring forth a lot of new changes and adjustments. He wasn’t even upset about the fact that he’s been running on little sleep. No, he was upset about his appearance.
Steve slides the rest of his finger inside and thrusts gently. Tony’s jaw slacks and his head falls between his shoulders. He grunts from the intrusion, and takes a second to remind himself that eventually the pain transitions to pleasure.
He stays a little longer, talking to his papa about the rest of the family and how they’re all coping. He finds comfort at the grave, and he swears he can feel his father with him. It doesn’t compare to having the real thing, but Peter would take what he could get.
“I’m sorry,” Peter says softly and that’s when Tony looks at him. His brown eyes are full of tears and a few have already escaped and are running down his face.
At those words, Steve can’t help but wrap an arm around his belly. It doesn’t go unnoticed.
Tony sighs heavily. “I don’t know. I don’t want to say there isn’t one because obviously we have him for something. Maybe it’s all for you. This is what you wanted, and now you have it.”
“Okay. And uh put in an order for stuff this kid’s gonna need.”
“You’re not showing it, Tony. Every time he looks at you I can see the fear and hurt.”
Peter is in a better mood once he’s eaten. After that, the rest of the day is spent playing any game Peter could think of. They run around the apartment, playing their own version of the Avengers-Bucky isn’t even mad when he’s asked to be the villain, but he does make sure to punish his nephew with a round of tickling-then, they’re winding down and watching a movie inside their blanket fort.
He pulls off and takes the other nipple into mouth to give it the same treatment. His own cock hardens in response to the noises Steve makes and he keeps sucking to provoke more of those sounds. Steve is writhing underneath him, fighting against the cuffs that Tony knows won’t crack.
Steve cuddles him and kisses his head. He doesn’t put Peter back to bed, and instead he carries the pup out of the room and toward his own. Tony is already dressed in lounge pants and finishing up changing the sheets.
“I know. You still want to do this?”
Tony wasn’t worried. He was going to keep his word.
“To help. To remind you of all the reasons why you shouldn’t accept defeat. You’ve already abandoned the only family you’ve ever known. Please don’t do it a second time.”
“Sorry,” Steve grins. “I can’t help it. I love this little guy.”
His prayers are answered when a man steps out of the car, dressed in a nice suit and designer sunglasses over his eyes. Peter knows what Tony Stark looks like and this man fits the description.
Steve chuckles and shakes his head. “Relax. You’re so nervous today.”
“Shh!” Peter hisses and quickly lowers his shirt down to hide the bump. “Ned, no one can know about this.”
Sam would be leading the next mission. He was perfect to fill in as Steve’s replacement until the Captain was ready to pick up the shield again. Steve often found himself wondering if he should pass the torch to Sam and let him be the hero America needs. Bucky might seem like the obvious choice, but Sam was special and Bucky wasn’t ready for something like that. Perhaps one day.
Tony learns about Peter’s love for science, his best friend Ned, and even a little bit about the girl he’s been crushing on.
Steve flinches at the harsh tone and scrubs his body quickly, but it’s not good enough. The alpha growls and grabs the wash cloth from Steve’s hand, then forces him around and into the wall again. Steve grits his teeth when the alpha washes him.
“Tony.” Steve frowns and sits up. He doesn’t understand where the shift in Tony’s attitude was coming from. All day Tony had been smiling and laughing, clearly enjoying himself at the shower. “That was never my intention. Natasha wanted to throw you a shower, that’s it. It was a celebration for our son. I know you’re happy.”
His intentions weren’t like that at all. Sure the omega was extremely good looking once he saw past the dirtied face and disheveled the hair. It was his eyes that Tony couldn’t stop staring at. They were so familiar.
Tony finds the omega fast asleep and curled up around his favorite pillows. Tony is able to recognize a few of the pillows from the couch. He almost doesn’t want to wake him, but Bruce would be arriving soon for the next appointment.
Tony doesn’t tear his eyes away from Flash. “Door stays open. And if I hear anything inappropriate-”
He had been waiting for this moment. Holding his son for the first time had constantly been on his mind. Steve had envisioned it differently. Tony would be here, sitting beside him and cradling their son in his arms. Tony probably would’ve been nervous too. He never said it out loud, but the idea of kids and a family probably terrified him.
It made Steve feel sick.
“That’s what you’ve been saying. You can be mom.”
The abundance of diapers made sense, though at the same time it made Steve uneasy. How many was he going to need? What he received so far appeared like enough but he knew babies required more than this. This would probably only last him a week or more.
Steve sniffs and quiet sobs escape him when their son is placed in his arms for the first time. The doctor and nurses leave the room to give the new parents privacy and time to say their goodbyes. Tony remains by Steve’s side, his heart aching because of the pain his husband is in.
“Never,” Steve says and hugs her a little bit tighter until she’s demanding he stop. “Sorry,” he apologizes with a sheepish grin. “Go put your suitcase away. I think you’re needed down in the lab.”
At least Tony is trying. Still needs to try harder though. I'll include more scenes of him and Peter. They still have a lot to learn about each other.
When he opens his eyes, he’s met with soft dark ones. Peter is staring at him, his eyes bright and smile even brighter. He giggles and places both hands on Steve’s face, cupping his cheeks and playfully slapping them. It doesn’t hurt, but it does the trick at waking Steve up fully.
“Do you think he’ll have powers?” Clint asks. He means it as a joke, but Steve can’t help but take him literally. It was a thought that has crossed his mind. “It’s not a bad thing, Cap. Maybe this kid will be invisible or something cool like that.”
“You’re still the best. Even if you can be a little embarrassing.”
“You left me. I had no idea if you were coming back or not. You took Morgan and left.”
“Steve, are you alright?” She comes closer, the smile on her face faltering and replaced with frown. “What’s going on?”
“Friend?” Steve pulls away from Tony, brows furrowed with confusion. “How could someone like him be your friend?”
“I’m fine,” Steve assures with a smile. “Although...I’m kinda hungry.”
Finally got around to this one. I promised to work on all my WIPS and it's harder than I thought it was going to be. Anyway, here is the next chapter! Thank you so much for being so patient with me!
Steve smiles. “Just like that. And then if that still doesn’t help, Daddy gives me plenty of hugs and kisses.”
Thank you for reading and I’ll update soon!
“Just enjoy right now.”
“Next time I’m going to beat you!” Peter says, playfully poking their papa in the chest.
Tony is hesitant to leave Steve’s side, but meeting the new interns wasn’t something he could delay any longer. Pepper had already gotten on his case about the schedule, and being nagged was the last thing the alpha needed. He had enough on his plate.
Tony nods and crawls closer to be near his boyfriend, happy to be able to hold him. Steve welcomes the embrace and curls up against him.
There is some smut in this chapter so hopefully no one minds 😏
“You smell different,” Steve frowns and he leans closer, nose wrinkling from the scent he picks up. His face pales and his eyes go wide. “T-Tony…”
“I can get her when she wakes up again. Now come back to bed, honey.”
“That’s the head. It’s almost out okay? Just a little more.”
But then he’s reminded that he didn’t need to run this morning or have his running buddy with him. Peter sighs sadly and rolls over onto his side, hoping he’d fall back asleep. But he never does and he’s left to stare at the walls.
Tony reads the letter over and over again, struggling to comprehend the words. He did have a son. He wants to be angry at Steve for keeping something huge like this from him, but truth be told, Steve hadn’t kept anything a secret. He tried reaching out to explain the situation and Tony blew him off every single time. It all made sense now; the phone calls and letters had been to tell Tony that he was a father.
“Tony-”
“Wait, wait,” Tony pants, forcing Steve to stop. “I need you to fuck me.”
“Nah. I’m good.”
“Surprise! Happy Valentine’s Day.”
“I can! Watch.”
Anyway...this chapter is pretty rough and unfortunately it only gets worse from here 😞
“Steve-”
“Don’t say stuff like that,” Pepper scolds. “You know he isn’t that person anymore, just like you aren’t the guy they think you are. You’re definitely not perfect-”
“I can’t do this. I can’t.”
Peter chuckles and shakes his head. “No. He did love hot cocoa though. He always wanted extra whip cream.”
Steve smiles. “I love you, too.”
“It’s okay. I’m sorry for saying anything. I didn’t want to talk about the death of my parents either.”
Tony wrinkles his nose. “No. It probably smells worse.”
“Yeah. Opposites attract, right?”
“I know. I don’t either. But I’m here to keep you safe okay? I promise no one will ever hurt you.”
“Isn’t this technically you’re third?”
He’s practically leaning on Tony for support while they make their way upstairs. They move slowly and cautiously, careful not to disturb any of the injuries Steve had. Tony honestly wasn’t sure what kind of damage Steve has sustained. The super solider was too damn stubborn.
“Terrible. Oh wait. You wouldn’t know. You didn’t have to deal with that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The three words hit Tony like a punch to the gut. His brain malfunctions, unable to process the words and form the proper response. It was simple: just say them back. And Tony wanted nothing more than to repeat those same words.
“I’m sorry, Morgan. I’m so sorry. I can’t do this. I’m not enough. I’m...nothing. I’m sorry.”
“Thank you.” Steve smiles softly and leans down to kiss each of his pups again. He glances up when a small whimper can be heard. “How’s Pete?”
But forgetting about Tony was easier said than done. He was always going to be on Steve’s mind, no matter how hard the soldier tried to forget.
“Thank you!” Peter calls out after his papa leaves. With a huff he pulls out a plain white t-shirt and slips it on, frowning from how the article of clothing clings to his belly. He finds his favorite hoodie to hide the bump.
“Do you mean the funeral or…” Peter trails off.
Tony doesn’t leave his side while Bruce performs the exam. Jarvis runs a few scans to aid the doctor, but the results haven't been revealed yet. It was nerve wracking.
“You really want this, huh?” Steve asks and Peter turns his head to face him, nodding his head. “It’s gonna be dangerous. Being an Avenger is more than just a cool outfit.”
But it was Steve’s choice and Tony was going to support him no matter what. Even if it was going to kill him inside.
“I’m glad to be home, I really am. But I’m scared. What if I can’t do it? What if I can’t be good enough and I screw up again? I don’t want to hurt her or you. I’d never live with myself.”
“Yeah. We got a little distracted-”
“Honey?” A knock on the door follows and Steve jumps at the sound.
He gasps when something pops and his pants grow wet. He can’t look at his lap, but he was sure if he could, he’d find an embarrassingly large stain along the front.
“Nine months to be exact, and now he’s finally here. You’re finally here, huh? Hello, sweetheart,” Natasha coos, smiling brightly when Peter wakes up and yawns.
Or maybe he was drugged. Steve hadn’t said for sure, but it made sense. Tony wouldn’t have done what he did willingly. Someone forced him to do it. But who?
Steve carefully removes his fingers and adds more lube to his cock, then he’s leading it to Tony’s stretched and prepared hole. He presses in slowly, eyes flickering up when Tony grunts in response.
“You’re needed down in the medbay.”
Happy listens and speaks up when given the chance. He praises her for the good grade on her history paper and asks about her plans for the weekend. Morgan didn’t have any, but she was sure she’d want to spend it with her parents.
“I won’t,” Tony promises. “I won’t do that to you again.”
“Honey, don’t do that.”
“It’s okay,” Bruce assures with a soft smile. “I just need to make sure he’s all right.”
Tony keeps up with his usual schedule of getting up early and preparing Steve his tea and vitamins. Steve eventually wakes up and emerges from the bathroom after a grueling round of morning sickness.
“Hey,” Tony greets when he enters the room, shooting his husband a smile. “She’s ready to go.”
Tony had decided to step down as CEO. His busy schedule was getting in the way of his family life. His family was his main priority now.
That gets a laugh out of Natasha and Steve’s face heats up.
“I will. I’m just...nervous. Plus I don’t want to interrupt them. Steve hasn’t-this is important to him and I don’t want to steal this moment away.”
“What happened!” Tony raises his voice, his sudden outburst causing both Steve and Peter to flinch.
“Does it look good?” Tony asks his son.
Sam sighs sadly. “He was a pararescueman working alongside me. Long story short, an RPG knocked him out of the sky. Nothing I could do.”
“Let him in. Tell him we’re in here,” Tony says.
“No, he’s staying with me. And don’t tell Pepper! I’ll deal with her.”
“His name is Peter.”
Steve’s body tenses when something cold pressed into his temple. The scent is stronger now.
Steve chuckles and gives her another kiss before moving toward the fridge for a bottle of water.
And he was here to stay, safe and sound in Steve’s arms.
Not all alphas are bad.
“Steve?”
God he loved him so much it hurt. He loved the way Steve carried himself; his confidence was admirable and envious at the same time. Tony loved how smart the Captain was. Steve may be from a different time, but he was clever and his way of thinking was underestimated. His laugh and smile was another thing Tony loved about him. Steve had been reserved at first, but he came out of his shell more and more, revealing the smile Tony couldn’t get out of his head.
There was no point in keeping himself locked in the bathroom. His absence was only going to worry his husband, and the last thing Steve wanted to do was worry and disappoint him at the same time.
Tony nods.
“Me too.”
The tears in his eyes burn and he squeezes them shut. His efforts at holding them back fail and they roll down his face. He didn’t want to talk about the years of torment Hydra put him through; it was difficult. But Tony made him feel safe. He could trust him.
“What’s up with you?” Bucky asks, frowning down at his nephew. Peter only hugs him tighter.
Everything else around Peter stops. He doesn’t acknowledge the other people surrounding him. All that matters is the person he’s desperately holding onto. The fingers feel nice in his hair and Peter’s eyes fall shut, succumbing to the comfort. He can still hear the beating; it’s getting softer and softer.
Seeing his space invaded with Steve’s belongings never gets old. Back when they had been dating, Steve left a toothbrush in case he stayed overnight, but that was the only item that proved he had been there at all. Now, the penthouse wasn’t just Tony’s home. It was theirs.
“Then pizza it is,” Bucky grins and helps his husband off the floor. “You’re paying since you decided to be an ass.”
“I was, kid. I should’ve called your papa back but I decided to deal with the issue myself. He sounded...scared. I didn’t want him to go so I took care of it.”
“‘M fine,” Tony directs his attention toward the window, scowling at the scene he finds. Being seen by the press when he was clearly sporting a baby bump was the last thing he wanted. He was dealing with enough as it was. “Can we just go? I knew this was a bad idea.”
Steve leans forward and with a yell, pushes one last time. He slumps back, his chest rising and falling rapidly. He musters up enough strength to lift his head, and that’s when he’s met with the most beautiful sight he’s ever seen. His daughter is held securely in Happy’s hands.
Steve nods and bites down on his bottom lip as he contemplates his next move. He leans closer and kisses Tony again, and then again and again until the kiss grows heated.
“Let me have my fun,” Pierce says and he pushes himself all the way in. He sighs in pleasure when he’s engulfed in a tight heat. He doesn’t even give the omega a chance to adjust before he’s thrusting his hips. “You feel just like I remember. Still tight after all those alphas, after all those pups.”
“Shh, it’s okay,” Tony soothes. “It’s okay.”
It’s not long before Steve has both of his children close and drifting off to sleep. He glances down at both of their sleeping faces, a smile forming at the sight. He loved his family. They were perfect.
“Yeah,” Peter agrees. “I’m sorry Uncle Bucky almost hit you.”
“I know.”
“The serum brought you back.”
From the beginning he had promised Steve protection and security. He was going to be there no matter what to make sure Steve and their son were safe. It was a promise he repeated multiple times a day until Steve finally believed it. That promise was sealed in stone the moment he placed his mark on Steve. He was Steve’s mate, his alpha, his protector. And he failed him.
“Yep.” Steve nods and leans down to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “I just want you to be happy.”
“No please! I just...I want to get to know you and watch these videos and...please?” Peter begs. He uses his best puppy dog eyes on his dad, just like he used to do with his papa.
The nightmares were something he still struggled with and every night he was waking up screaming or drenched in a cold sweat. His mate was there to pull Steve close and comfort him, soothing him back to sleep with his calm voice and scent.
He hates that mindset. The pills are what’s helping Steve cope with his depression. At least, that’s what they’re supposed to be doing. From day one Steve has never missed a dosage, and yet some days it seems like he’s never been prescribed them at all.
Steve only nods in response.
Steve makes his way over and Tony turns in his seat, smiling brightly at him. “Morning, sleepyhead. How’d you sleep?”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” Tony replies.
He finds the strength to lift himself up and turn his body around. He stumbles for a moment before catching himself and leaning back against the edge of the bed. His gaze drops, eyes landing on the doctor kneeling between his legs. But it’s the infant in her arms that steals away all of his attention.
“They won’t...do anything bad.”
“Yeah.”
“Be good for Papa okay? Can you do that?”
Bruce eventually finishes looking over both Steve and the baby, and announces that their son wasn’t on the way. Steve is able to breathe a sigh of relief. It was too soon for his son to be born. But he wasn’t ready to celebrate yet. Something about Bruce was off.
