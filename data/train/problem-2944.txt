Castiel nods, “Emma thank you for your efforts, but we already planned on speaking with the guidance counselor about online options and Claire’s probably going to test out of a few things to graduate early.”
“Yeah sorry, I’d love to come. But what about Adam?”
Castiel nods, “Thank you, I take it you have some news?”
Castiel tears his eyes away back to to Anna. The look on his face is enough to tell her what she needs to know. This type of behavior, for anyone, would be unacceptable. But for Castiel especially, it was unforgivable.
“Home? Which one Cas? Your
Dean Winchester was already stoked to start his senior year at the University of Kansas. Class of ‘96! It was going to be awesome.
Adam continues to struggle with school, his teacher calls Dean to set up meetings but between the garage and Becky he is rarely able to make them. He exchanges emails instead, gritting his teeth through every “Not meeting expectations”, “Disruption to the class”, and “Frequently Tardy”.
“Henderson and Kowalski need some time in the batting cages this week.”
Glancing back at the stage, Dean is waving people back to their seats. He looked cool and confident up in front of the crowd. Maybe he was a performer in his own way, Cas didn’t see any instruments or band, so he probably wasn’t going to sing for them.
“What about the memory loss?”
Not when his hands still feel warm on his shoulders.
“Orgasms are a bodies physical response to stimulant, that’s just biology. I’m interested to know how you felt, did you like everything I did? Would you have liked anything different?”
Castiel lets out a winded breath as he runs up the concrete steps for the dozenth time. That Buddy guy really had his number today! It seemed like everywhere he turned he was there. On the field, in the stands, it was like being followed by the Devil himself!
You bruise my face
“So I’m sitting at the counter, waiting for my burger and in walks the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. There are several empty booths, but she sits right down next to me. At first, I tried to ignore her, but she was staring at me. Then when my food comes out, she starts stealing fries off my plate!”
He takes a deep breath, “She got sick, we weren’t even married a whole year before she...” Castiel trails off, his eyes shimmering with tears.
Dean taps a knuckled wrap on the door and Cas startles but doesn’t look over.
“Hey isn't the birthday girl supposed to be partying, not bossing people around?” He gestures to the feisty redhead in front of fireplace.
The suggestive question ripples low in his belly, his skin prickles at the thought.
“So should I tell him how I feel? Let him know it wasn’t me being stupid.”
“Don’t... If you say you’re sorry... If you apologize, I will break your nose.” Cas glares over at Dean’s hurt face. His eyes sting and he has to close them.
“Okay, okay. I’m sorry. Please don’t cry Charlie.” He wraps his arms around her and she sniffs into his chest.
“That sounds perfect Dean.” Giving him his best smile and in return Dean hits him with one to shame all the lights on Broadway.
“You’re incredibly responsive Dean.”
His sister offered to accompany them to Florida for the team’s spring training. In addition to being a very doting aunt she was also here as Jack’s tutor. Castiel felt bad about pulling Jack out of school for four weeks, but his boss had given him no choice. It was that or not see his son for almost a month.
Dean is loving every minute of this. Hopefully he can sneak a few more public displays before they go home. It doesn’t look good though when Sam parks his butt right on the couch between Cas and Dean.
“Your pride; hurt by my honesty about you and your family. Did you really expect me to be happy I was falling for someone like you? He leans in closer, Dean falters.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
His Dom chuckles, “I assumed so. Did you touch yourself here?” Moving his right hand lower, it barely brushes over the crown of Dean’s growing erection.
“Toasted butternut squash ravioli with a sage and apple glaze. Crispy brussels sprouts with cranberries.”
He welcomed in them both with open arms after Ameila’s funeral; fed them, cried with them, read to them till they fell asleep. But somehow Jimmy decided seeing his daughter’s face (it’s like looking right at her Cas, I don’t know how I can keep looking at my daughter and missing my wife) was too much to bear. He booked job after job, pulling himself farther away from the one person who needed him most. Till one day he texted to say Castiel should probably think about enrolling her in school there in Lawrence since he didn’t know when he’d be back.
“You’ve already made your opinion of Sam pretty clear.” Dean grits through his teeth.
To be fair, he found most people boring. It was only rare circumstances that he was friends with Eileen in the first place. He pulls on a grey sweater over a white dress shirt, it’s what amounted to casual wear for Castiel, never mind the fact it was cashmere.
When he finishes drying off, he pulls out his phone to see if Adam even tried to get a hold of him. Nothing, what a punk... Dean, still a little ticked off, fires off a message to his younger brother.
“Why do I have a feeling I'm not the only competitive one?” Cas inquires.
“Well... if not Sam, I suppose I could settle for you.” She stands up now and comes around behind his chair, her voice right in his ear. “But you’d really need to make it worth my while.”
“So, we’re going?” Ellen looks to the two of them for confirmation.
“Hey Lydia, everything okay?” he hastily dials back the concern in his voice, but truth be told he and Lydia almost never spoke on the phone. If she was calling it, was probably bad news.
“Seriously, you wanna share? There’s a whole empty bed right there.” But Dean’s already scooting and grinning from ear to ear.
“I’m your only friend.” She counters.
“Last I check Sam was unattached. I’m not his direct supervisor, it’s not completely unethical.” She sounds a little defensive now. Dean peers through the crack in the door and he can see her frowning at Castiel.
She tucks her tray and their menus under her arm and is off again.
Castiel leans against the locker, cool metal brushing against his bare skin. He sighs, “Exhausting, I uh, had to go into the office today.”
“Fucking tease,” Dean growls into his mouth.
The door opens at that moment, both men look up to see Becky Collins standing in the doorway. Her head is held high but Castiel can see her chin quiver under their gaze. Now that could be because her boss and the man he reported to were staring at her, but Castiel can almost feel the tension vibrating off of her.
“It’s going to be a good one brother.” Benny claps a hand on his shoulder. They had been friends since college, the three of them. Bonding over a love of 80’s movies and bad diner food. And when Dean had been in the hospital, and shortly after physical rehabilitation, both Charlie and Benny were there with a mini-DVD player and take out at least once a week. He owed them his sanity those first few months, without them he didn’t know where he’d be. He didn’t want to know.
Twelve+ hours late, but I made it!!
The two grownups exchange a look over the top of their sunglasses, impressed and a little intimidated by the aptitude of a six-year-old.
She’s still holding something back; Claire wasn’t overly spontaneous. If she wanted to go riding today, she would have checked the weather report and called ahead to the boarder. They didn’t exactly need an appointment, but it was courteous to give them notice. There must have been some reason.
“Dean, I’m not walking away from anything. This is not real. This place, this house. It's not our life.”
“Well let's see,” he says, “perhaps you were arguing over the same boy, hmm?”
“Oh come on! You guys looked ready to tear each other’s throats out. There’s gotta be a story!” Adam is practically bouncing out of his chair.
“You want me to call Mom and fill her in or wait until we get home?” Sam asked, already pulling out his phone. Dean checked the time on the dash.
“Dean,” Jack was surprised he was even able to speak.
“I did. I am glad that they are already comfortable with each other. I was worried Claire wouldn’t be able to connect with Jack,” Cas admitted.
“Nobody calls me that. You can call me Sam.”
“Alright, go on and get it over with,” she said, looking between Cas and Dean. “Yell at me for doing something I know I shouldn’t have and for dragging Jack with me.”
“It certainly looks that way,” Gabriel replied, an uncharacteristically somber look on his face.
“I’m sorry kiddo, I’m gonna have to cut your jeans off,” Dean said apologetically. “You didn’t bandage far enough up your leg.” Claire just nodded and watched as Dean used his switchblade to carefully cut the rest of the denim off her leg. She gasped as he began unraveling the bandage, tossing it on the counter once it was all off. “Fuck, Claire.”
“What’s taking so damn long?”
Mary quoted, “That’s another clue, too.”
“I am unsure of who gives the orders, I am too low of rank to speak with them directly,” Cas explained.
“I wouldn’t get close now now, Sammy, he’s very contagious,” Pestilence said. “Wouldn’t want you to get anything.”
They had only been flipping through for about half an hour when the bunker door opened and Cas, Dean, and Miracle came tumbling through. “What are two crazy kids up to?” Dean asked when he saw what they were doing.
He looked over at his mother, who had been through so much, lost her parents, then her husband, and then nearly both of her children. He grabbed her hand, squeezing it while he thought.
“It’s in Sioux Falls,” Kaia explained, “I thought maybe we could stay with Mrs. Winchester or something, I don’t know. I think it would be good for us to be somewhere close to people we know, you know? And it’s not far from here, we could get a car, maybe, come visit Sam, Dean Jack …”
“This should go quickly,” John said, “They’re probably still sleeping because it’s not quite night time yet.”
“No,” Sam said, cocking the gun and aiming it at John’s head, “Dean’s right. Something is off with you. I’ve seen him beat Dean bloody for spilling a glass of milk. He would’ve taken it out on us.”
“I always wanted to help kids,” Claire said with a smile, “I’m going to give her a call.”
“Claire, baby, look at me,” Dean tilted her face up gently. “It’s okay, I promise. I’m not mad, I’m not. It’s okay.”
“Girlfriend? As in…” John trailed off, lip curling in disgust as he looked between the two of them. Claire reached over and took Kaia’s hand.
“What are you doing?” Claire asked, looking at him with her eyes narrowed in confusion.
“We’re not sure why it happened, only that demons are behind it,” he said.
His father just laughs.  “You’re kidding, right?  You’re not half enough man to use that thing.  You leave the adults to sort this out, and I will deal with you later.”  He pulls his mother up by her hair, and Bobby doesn’t think, just points.  What is he doing?
Sam’s eyes flicked down to the man’s hand, noticing his ring, “Dean,” when Dean’s attention turned to him, Sam spoke quietly, “It’s Death.”

She was sprung from her thoughts as the microwave beeped at her. She poured the contents into a bowl, grabbed the package of nougat and then two beers from the fridge before joining Jack on the couch. He already had the first movie ready to go, so as soon as the snacks were situated on the coffee table, he was pressing play on the remote.
And then Cas’ face flashed in his head, and suddenly that nurse wasn’t any more important than Sammy’s too-many step hair care routine.
“Real bad, kiddo, you’re gonna need stitches,” Dean said. “We can’t do those here, though. I don’t have the stuff and we’ll need the privacy. I’m gonna clean this and bandage it back up, okay?”
At Cas’ comment, Dean tasted it himself, eyes widening, “Jesus,” he said, suppressing a cough, “Can you get some heavy cream out of the fridge for me?”
“I’m leaving for a hunt tomorrow morning, gotta pack,” Claire answered, and she could already feel the disapproval.
They crowded into one motel room with Bobby and Mary as Sam explained his theory, which Cas corroborated, “I am certain that the Cupid is not responsible for this, especially after the displays we saw in the bar. I’ve never seen anything like that.”
“Kaia?” Cas spoke quietly, looking over at her. “Are you alright? Do you need anything?”
“No, Cas got to me before I ever drank a single drop,” Sam said. “But…she’s still down there. She doesn’t deserve to be stuck there. I promised I would get her out and I will. After all this apocalypse shit is done, I’m saving Bela.”
The man narrowed his eyes, turning his head to the side in a way that made Sam think, offhandedly, of a dog. “Samuel Winchester…” the man said, “Whether or not you pay for those items is none of my concern.”
As Claire and Kaia sat at the table across from him, Cas gestured towards the hallway, “I’m going to go see where Dean went. I will be back in a few minutes.”
“I am inclined to extend a bit of kindness toward you for sparing my reapers when Alastair tried to kill them. I can always make more, but it’s a burden. I also believe that you two are, unfortunately, our best hope to avoid the apocalypse.”
Dean nods, “Yes, sir.”
“The last time I saw her, I promised I would save her. It was just before Cas pulled me out, I...told Alastair I would start drinking demon blood,” he ignored Mary’s gasp. “My plan was to eventually overpower him.”
“It’s so nice to finally meet
“C’mon, I think it’s time for bed,” Cas said when he saw how tired the girls were. “Did you need help getting her to your room?” he asked Kaia.
“In fuzzy socks,” Jack supplied. “Claire said that I missed out on a lot of kid stuff.” Claire saw Dean’s resolve break at that and he sighed.
Nothing happened, really.  He heard Dad’s voice rumbling downstairs and he could not get up to put this book in his bag.  He doesn’t know when his heart started racing, but it sends him back three weeks ago when Bobby looked at the bruises on his arms and saw right through his lies, he should’ve been better at lying.  He looks at his wrists and there’s nothing there, those bruises faded weeks ago and he.  He doesn’t want to count the days and weeks it’s been since there were bruises, oh
“Alright, thanks Jo,” Dean sighed. “Keep us updated.” He ended the call and pocketed his phone. “Sam and I are gonna go after this one, Mom.”
“What do you two talk about?” Mary asked, doing her best to sound as innocent as possible. She wanted to know how Dean felt about this angel because it was clearly more than battlefield loyalty.
Also: no one make this w*ncest. It's not and I will kill anyone who thinks it is.
“That angel, huh?” asked Ellen, “He’s still hanging around after pulling Sam from the pit?”
“Uh, thanks, I guess,” Sam said, not sure what to say to someone complimenting his
The first week the boys are there, Dean wears long sleeves every day.  And Bobby wouldn’t think much of it, except for last time they stayed it was June.  They’d stayed for four days, and on the third day he and Dean had been out in the yard working on a car.  Bobby was teaching as he went, and the kid picked it all up quick.  Dean had stood to stretch and wipe his sleeve across his sweaty forehead, his sleeve rode up, and Bobby saw them.
Castiel nodded, unaccustomed to human traditions and rituals, but content to do as he was told when he was unsure of how to proceed. Sam turned and gave him an awkward pat on the shoulder before heading down the hall to the room Dean was in. He was surprised to see his mother and Jo staring at him as if in tense anticipation.
Claire gritted her teeth as she twisted the tourniquet around her leg and tied it off. She used whatever she was leaning on to pull herself to her feet, putting all the weight she could on her uninjured leg as she hobbled out of the building and back to her car.
“There’s not much, unfortunately. I have spoken with Dean about how he feels about his father and despite….the suffering that John has caused, Dean still cares for his father.”
Jack started to explain, as Kaia ran over to check on Claire’s wrist, but Dean interrupted, “Go heal Claire’s wrist, then we’ll talk.”
After a bit, Kaia turned the water off and wrapped Claire in a towel, helping her to dry off and then get dressed. “Come on, let’s get you in bed,” she whispered, walking with Claire down the hall and into their bedroom. She tucked Claire up in their bed and kissed her head. She sat with Claire until she fell asleep - Kaia guessed from emotional exhaustion - and then hurried to the kitchen to help Jack with cleaning.
“Let’s have some cake,” Dean said, smiling down at the plate in front of him. “Are you guys gonna sing to me?” Claire just smirked and pulled a lighter from her pocket to light all the candles. Once they were all flickering, the three of them began singing ‘Happy Birthday’, all loudly and off-key. Claire filmed Dean as they sang, and while this could be incredible blackmail material with the way he was blushing and smiling, she figured she might just keep this one as a happy memory.
“Popcorn and nougat it is. Do you know how to work the TV and everything to pull the movie up?” Jack nodded and quickly left the room, presumably going to the rec room. Claire shoved the popcorn into the microwave and leaned against the counter. Everything that Jack told her...she wasn’t sure how to take it. She knew that Cas and Dean cared about her, but she always thought it was more because they had an obligation to, but the way Jack spoke, how he said they acted, it sounded like they genuinely loved her.
“You’re not my dad,” Dean said, turning at the sound of Sam’s footsteps in the doorway, “Sammy, I think he’s possessed.”
Being God came with a lot of responsibilities that Jack hadn’t originally thought of when he took on the title, and those responsibilities took up a lot of his time. So much time that he barely even registered that it had been forty years when he felt Dean Winchester return to Heaven for the final time.
she told herself. Claire grabbed the keys to one of the cars - not the Impala, because she knew Dean would meticulously check the mileage and would know they had borrowed it without permission.
They all froze when they heard a door open down the hall, Kaia peeking her head out the door. “It’s Bela, she’s heading to the bathroom, we’re good, let’s go!” she whispered, and they all filed out quickly to rush to Jack’s bedroom. Once they were safe inside with the door closed, he made them all visible again.
. “I shall see you soon Dean.”
Rage flashed across Dean’s face for a brief moment before he schooled his features, “I’m fine, Bobby, drop it.”
“No, wait, wait I - no!”  Bobby just watches as he hits her.  His hands are shaking, his heart is pounding.  He just watches.
“That’s not surprising. It is the language of angels,” he said with a small smile. “I could show you some of the letters, if you want.” Claire thought for a moment before she nodded and moved so that she was sitting next to Castiel, far easier for them to both see it that way.
“I had paint everywhere. It was in my hair, I had to get it out. Or did you want to watch me have a breakdown while I shaved my head?” Claire raised her eyebrows, grinning smugly when Dean didn’t reply. “That’s what I thought.”
“Yes, though angels must receive consent before using a human as a vessel. Jimmy was a very devout man and prayed for this,” Castiel said, looking down at himself - at Jimmy.
“Bobby!” his mother calls and Bobby runs down the stairs, “Bobby Singer you had better be washed up when you come down.”  She sees him and tuts, “You’re filthy - god, what is wrong with you?  It’s like you want him to get mad.”  She says it like they can control when his daddy gets mad, like he’s not mad all the time just waiting for an excuse to boil over.  Still, he goes to wash up like she wants.
As the tense near-silence of the war room got to be too much, Sam ran into the room, “Bela got ahold of Sister Jo! She’ll be here in a second.” As if on cue, the front door of the bunker slammed shut, and Bela walked down the main stairway, followed by the angel.
“I have something I need to admit,” Jack eventually said. “After we met, last week, when I returned to Heaven...I found your parents.”
Back then Dean hadn’t started school yet, though Bobby was pretty sure he was old enough.  He’d brought it up once or twice, wondering aloud if John shouldn’t settle down somewhere soon so Dean could go to school.
Sam typed up a text to Mary, cursing when the message refused to deliver. “I guess even in a nice place like this, the midwest still has shitty cell service,” Dean said.
Cas heaved a sigh once he had gotten off the phone with Dean. He had returned to the warehouse from earlier - figured if the lone vampire that had turned John came back, he’d kill that one too.  Cas never would’ve had a problem murdering John Winchester - vampire or not - for the physical and emotional abuse that he had put both Sam and Dean through as children. In fact, Cas considered it nearly every time he had encountered his boyfriend’s father. But, the knowledge that Dean would be upset, would need to grieve and that he would be the cause of it, caused his stomach to churn uncomfortably.
Dean looked at Claire, “Is that something you and Kaia would be interested in?”
“He was a drunk, a real mean one. He’d get a few in him and he’d start screaming at my mom and me. Well, one day he started beating on my mom and he just wouldn’t stop. I’d finally had enough of his shit, and I… I took his shotgun, and I shot him. We buried him in the backyard, never really spoke of him again. My mom told the neighbors that he ran off to Florida with a younger woman.”
Mary, Sam and Dean stood up to pack their bags for an indefinite trip to Nebraska. “Dean,” Cas said, stopping him on his way out of the kitchen, “Could I speak with you for a moment?”
“Where is the butter?” Jack asked and Claire pointed to the fridge as she pulled down their brand new cake pans. “So when the recipe says to butter the pan?”
“Samuel-” Castiel started to ask, before he was cut off.
“Possess my dad.”
“You and me need to have a talk.  Outside.”  John doesn’t move, just looks at Dean.  “Now,” Bobby snaps.
“Kids!” Dean called down the hallway. “Come and eat!” They all scrambled up, Kaia just barely managing to pause the movie as they ran toward the kitchen. Cas and Sam were already seated at the table, a basket of garlic bread between them as Dean carried the lasagne over from the oven.
“You can’t be serious,” Dean walked further into the room, holding himself steady on one of the chairs. “You...Mom has been dead for thirty years. There’s nothing to bring back.”
“Claire, this is non-negotiable,” Dean said sharply. “And you know Jody will say the same thing. Or do you want me to call her and tell her you’re trying to go hunt on a bum leg?
“Mildred Huntington,” Cas said easily. “She moved in recently.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Sam said a bit desperately. He knew why he was seeing Bela, and he knew he needed to get back to Dean but...he couldn’t bear to look away from her. “We tried everything we could think of.”
The dog, now Paperclip, tilted his head and perked his ears up. “It’s perfect,” Jack said with a smile. The two spent the rest of the day together, Jack sitting with Paperclip while she ate and then taking her outside when Cas suggested that she might need to urinate. They walked around the perimeter of the bunker and even without a leash, Paperclip never strayed more than a few feet from Jack’s side. Jack showed her around the bunker once they were inside again, explaining each room and what it was for. Paperclip followed him around diligently the entire time, seemingly smiling at him as she sat and listened.
After a few minutes of gathering up supplies and waiting for Dean to package up breakfast leftovers for Claire and Kaia, the group headed up the stairs, save for Cas who stayed back in case the girls ended up needing help with anything.
“Four weeks,” Dean corrected. “And there’s plenty you can help us do. Cas has his garden that you can help with, Miracle needs a walk every day. We get hunters calling in all the time for some help with lore.”
The weeks that followed the revelation about what Sam had done in Hell were filled with long stretches of tense silence and shared glances between Dean and Mary as Sam began taking daily walks with Cas.
“You know, Dean,” Sam said, looking up, meeting his brother’s eyes, “Kaia getting ready to go to college has me thinking about how I want to go and finish my own degree.”
“What do you want for breakfast, kid?” Dean asked, getting up to make something for him.
At Cas’ request, the mixtape Dean had made him was playing through the speakers, which only made Dean’s heart beat faster, his and Cas’s hands lightly held together on the seat between them.
Dean plastered a fake smile onto his face, “Just peachy.”
“Angel,” Dean reached over and took Cas’ hand in his. “I know how you feel about what you did to the Novaks and Claire, but she understands the circumstances, we all do. Things were different then, you were different. And what her mom did was awful, but you had no control over that. What matters is that you’re here now.”
Cas drew in a shaky breath, “She hugged me and told me she was sorry, that she knew how close Kelly and I were. Even after I …” he hesitated a moment, trying to get the words out, “I don’t deserve it. She has every right to hate me.”
Sam shook his head, “You never should’ve had to handle that. I know how young you were when he started hitting you. I couldn’t have been older than five the first time I saw it happen.”
,” John sneered the title at Sam, stopping his movements.
Anael said with a gasp, “He’s magnificent.” She continued, describing the battle between the two factions of angels, how Jack was faring against the opposing angels. “He’s very...clever, with how he attacks.”
“Did you know that he and Cas were a thing?” Sam asked indignantly.
complex - although that seemed like too simple a word, ironically. He stood and took a deep breath. “Dean, I want to apologize for my oversight in placing John so close to you. I want to rectify my mistake. I’ll return after.” He ignored everyone’s protests and flew away.
“And how are you going to protect yourself out here?” Dean asked. Castiel smirked.
“2471,” Sam said, reading the time, date, and location stamp in the bottom corner. “Are we just gonna ambush him then?”
“Oh,” Castiel said, seemingly satisfied with that answer, “okay.”
“War’s ‘red horse’ was a ‘65 Mustang so I’m willing to bet Famine’s steed will be similar,” said Sam.
“Wait,” he said, remembering how Castiel had been able to patch him up after he had crawled out of the grave, “I think maybe…”
“You wouldn’t dare.”
“No, that is not an activity I have ever participated in,” Jack shook his head.
To everyone’s dismay, the entryway lights were on when they went inside, and Cas and Dean were seated at the library table, staring at them expectantly. After a beat of silence Dean spoke gruffly, “Y’all know we have cameras, right?”
“Hell with grace, pass me the biscuits.”  It’s like they’re reciting from a script. It's so typical, like they’re all in a choreographed dance.  His father will grab a biscuit and reach for a knife, he’ll ask his mother
“Well, what do we do about it?” Dean asked hurriedly, glancing around to make sure no one was watching them.
“You’re pretty too,” Kaia whispered, giggling a little when Claire leaned up and kissed her, taking the book from her hands. “Don’t lose my place!” she insisted, tugging herself away from Claire to try and reach for the book.
“Babe!” Claire pouted, easily letting Kaia take the book and dog ear the page before closing it.
“So what do we do?” she asked.
“Fuck man,” he said, looking up to see Castiel standing in front of him. “What the fuck, can’t you knock?”
“What would be the purpose of knocking?” Castiel asked with a slight frown.
Bobby stood by the door, a silver knife still raised in the air. His brows furrowed, “Is it really you, son?”
“I cannot say for sure, but my best assumption would be because you are a compassionate man and the people you could not save saw that. They do not believe it is your fault because you did everything you possibly could to save them. Sometimes it’s simply not enough,” Cas said, meeting Dean’s eyes. “And they are correct, Dean. You are not at fault for any death.”
Ellen and Jo made eye contact for a moment and then turned to him with a nod, “That sounds great, thank you, Castiel” replied Ellen with a smile.
Dean shook his head, “He ran off. Cas found him… he found him feeding on a woman. He has him restrained in the trunk, pumped full of Dead Man’s Blood but…”
“Not particularly,” Castiel said with a shake of his head. “There’s a few entries that mention potential weapons that would work against an archangel but they are either locked up tight in Heaven with no chance of retrieving them - even with Gabriel’s help - or they were destroyed long ago.” Claire nodded and took a deep breath.
“Do you know why this happened in the first place? It’s a sign of the apocalypse, right?” Castiel hesitated for a moment.
“Okay,” Jack said, though he still looked unsure. Claire just dragged him the rest of the way, waiting to get buzzed into the building. They both got their visitors badges and were led to the class that Jack would be speaking to, and just before they could enter, Claire asked where the bathroom was.
“I know,” Claire rolled her eyes and pushed Dean away lightly. “Now go, you guys have to get on the road if you want to make it in time.” She waved to the three of them as they drove out of the bunker’s garage, shutting the door behind them. She sighed and descended the stairs, hoping she could make it back to her room where Kaia and Jack were sequestered before John spotted her, but no such luck - he was sitting at the map table.
“No,” Dean replied, voice strained, “He got himself into this. It’s not your fault.”
“Even worse. I can’t wait for him to be gone,” Claire sat on the floor with Jack, who was playing a video game on her laptop. “Don’t know why he’s even still here. It’s obvious none of us want him here.”
“He’s alright,” Cas replied as he sat down on the bed, “Claire and Kaia are sitting with him now. What are you up to?”
“Anael,” Cas said gruffly, “Where is he?”
As he approached the door, he realized that the store was deserted, but given the lack of options he entered anyway, in the hopes that he would find water and something edible. He sighed in relief, seeing a mostly-stocked refrigerator with water bottles and assorted sodas inside. He opened one of the water bottles, draining it immediately. He shoved several more water bottles into the plastic grocery bag he had grabbed from the checkout counter.
Cas led the way to the spacious gym in the bunker, “We weren’t sure exactly what you’d need, but we figured that you could use this space. If you need something else, you can let us know.”
“Dean,” he said. “And it’s because Michael, your father - your biological father, wants to use you to kill Gabriel and take over Heaven.” Jack frowned and tilted his head - somehow looking exactly like Cas.
“Blech, I don’t get why anybody would make a chip out of the grossest vegetable,” Sam said, and they devolved into debating chip types.
“This weather is fucking awful,” Sam replied, “I think we should stop somewhere for the night and wait it out.”
“Glad you had fun. I’m starving, you guys started anything for dinner?”
“I’ll be right back,” Kaia said and helped Claire into the bathroom and into the shower, clothes still plastered to her body. “You get clean. I’ll come back, okay? Just get undressed and get clean. I’ll get you some clothes.” Claire didn’t say anything as Kaia left, going to Jack.
“Don’t do that,” Dean said, cutting him off. “Where you were, what you had to do and go through...there’s no telling what me and Mom would have done, okay? If we would have held out longer or said yes earlier, there’s no way of knowing. So don’t do that to yourself.” Sam nodded, though didn’t look convinced by Dean’s words.
“The room is currently empty of any occupants,” Castiel said. Dean grinned and opened the door, he and Sam heading to the monitors. They began methodically scanning each screen, looking for anything out of place. While they didn’t spot Pestilence at first, something all three of them did notice was just how...sick everyone was - residents and staff. Every person they saw was coughing or sneezing.
“I-It’s fine, it’ll just take a second.”
Knowing only the address to the hospital, but not Dean’s room number, Sam and Castiel were forced to speak to the reception desk to inquire about where Dean was. Once they had the information, Sam turned to Castiel, “My family is already going to be … seeing me is already going to be a lot, and they’re probably going to come at me with salt, holy water, and silver as it is. You should… wait here. I think seeing you would be too much for them right now.”
“Yeah, I’ve never really been here long enough for the opportunity,” she pushed herself to her feet and gestured for Jack to follow. They walked down the hallway until they reached the stretch with all the storage rooms. “Which one?”
Ellen got up, gathering the dirty pint glasses in front of everyone, “So it’s settled, then. Y’all can stay at our house and we’ll leave in the morning.”
“Whatever,” Dean muttered, shifting uncomfortably. “So, you got angel business you have to jet off to?”
Claire swallowed heavily as Dean just stared at the box, quickly reaching back to grab Jack’s hand, squeezing it. “Dean?” Jack’s voice was soft and unsure.
“You have to admit that was funny as hell, man,” he said between gasps of air. “You went on about how intimidating prime numbers were for five minutes before Sam finally took pity.”
A flicker of light caught his eye as he passed one of the hotel’s conference rooms. With little regard for his own personal safety, he flung open the door, totally unprepared for the situation he was getting himself into.
“I found someone on my walk,” Claire said, Dean finally backing off so Cas could see Jack, and as soon as he did, Jack was enveloped in another bone-crushing hug. Dean turned to Claire, and kissed her head.
“Know what?”
Before long, Sam and Bela returned with a stack of pizza boxes, and everyone gathered around the long tables in the library. They shared pizza as they chatted and laughed, the relief in the room was palpable without the looming threat of Michael coming to kidnap or harm Jack. Eventually, people broke off from the group and headed to bed, exhausted not only from the events of the day, but from the weeks prior.
“You boys have kept me waiting!” He called, pushing himself to his feet. “And I made it so easy to find me. You could almost say...you walked right into a trap.” The man smirked as the doors on either side of the room burst open and demons came rushing in.
“That’s what you disappeared for?” Dean asked. “Cigarettes?”
“Where’s your friend,” the woman asked, just on the wrong side of chipper for Claire’s taste.
Cas squinted in confusion, but before he could respond, Sam spoke, “Anyway, we need to look into tracking down the next horseman and trying to plot Lilith’s next move.”
“We’re good and we’re all packed. You checked last night,” Claire said and grabbed a couple of granola bars from the pantry. “One of us will text when we get to Salina, okay? And when we kill the son of a bitch, and when we leave, and when we’re almost home? Sound good?”
“Yeah.  Are you gonna make pancakes?” Sam asked.
“So that’s our best bet then?” Dean said. “Let’s get going. We have got to get this town back to normal.” With that, the three of them headed downstairs to the Impala, Castiel directing Dean to the church from the backseat. Dean parked in front of it, frowning a bit. “Doesn’t look special.”
“I can’t visit my own sons?” John asked haughtily, walking further into the bunker and looking around.
“Well,” Claire said teasingly, dragging her hands down Kaia’s ribs to the hem of her shirt. “You’re even prettier without clothes on.”
“C’mon then, I’ll make you a PB and J,” Dean agreed, leading the two of them to the kitchen. Luckily, no one else was in there, leaving the space empty save for the three of them. Cas had Jack sit down at the table as Dean prepared the sandwich, asking him easy questions about what he remembered and what he knew about his own conception and birth.
“Why hasn’t Dean gone to see John and Mary? Is he still mad at me for what happened with Mary? I apologized to her, and to Dean -”
“It’s people that they couldn’t save,” Dean said without pause. “That’s who’s been killing the hunters, at least that’s what it seems like. Mom and Bobby have both seen ghosts of people they didn’t save.”
Cas nodded, “You and your brother spent years around him as children, I’m sure I can handle anything he could conceivably throw at me.”
“That sounds perfect, then. I’m sure she can point you in the direction of what you’d need to do to get started. Just know that we’re proud of you, and that no matter what you do. Cas and I will be there to support you. Just come home every once in a while, okay?”
“We should clean this, right?” Jack said, looking around the kitchen.
“Bela?” Dean sounded surprised. “Fuck, okay, just sit tight, make sure you’re safe. We’re gonna do this spell and fix everything, okay?”
“Uh-huh,” Dean replied sarcastically, “See, when some creep dressed like a Mormon who dabbles in serial murder walks up to me and addresses me by name, respect isn’t my first response. Start talking before I shoot you.”
old, god, Dean. Don’t you have anything that was released
“Dean, we need to distract him somehow,” Sam tried to reason.
“Anything, Jack.”
Dean rolled his eyes and walked over to the coffee pot silently. Mary smiled sheepishly at Castiel, knowing that he had no idea what Dean’s problem was. By the time Dean was seated at the table, Sam had entered the kitchen too.
“There’s your nice supper.”  Bobby doesn’t know where to look, if he should look at him, doesn’t know what else is gonna set him off.  “I get no respect in this house.”
“Castiel said that we should be looking out for things like bodies of water that have recently become polluted, and mass, unexplained destruction of infrastructure.” Mary supplied, taking a sip of her beer.
“I’m very old, one would hope I’d be at least a little bit wise at this point,” Cas said, squeezing Dean’s hand. Dean leaned over and kissed Cas, letting himself relax
“Yeah.”
“Both,” Dean said. “Start drinking, it’ll help numb the pain a bit.” Claire wasn’t going to say no, twisting the cap off and taking a drink. It was awful but she refused to let Dean see her gag. As Dean got everything ready, she continually took small sips, and by the time he was finished, Claire was feeling the effects of the alcohol.
He was looking for an answer that wasn’t demons.  Didn’t believe in them, he said.  Bobby laughed.
“No, no that was fine. I just wasn’t expecting all that,” Claire handed over the last bowl, pulling the plug to drain the sink. “Do you want any snacks for the movie?”
“Absolutely no hunting by yourself,” Dean said sternly. “Why don’t you see if Jody or Donna know of somewhere that you could work? My mom might be able to help you out too, but she runs a small business out of her house, so I don’t know that she’d have much to offer in that department.”
Sam smiled softly and reached across the table to grab her hand reassuringly, “When I was in Hell, I met up with Bela. At first, I didn’t know what to say to her, and it wasn’t like we had much time anyway. Before I saw her, they’d string us up and torture us, and just when we couldn’t take it anymore, we’d be healed and the day would start again. And then, after I...after I said yes, talking to Bela was the only thing that got me through it -” he was cut off by the sob that escaped him.
“See, there’s always something good. Sammy dying was the worst part of my life but I got you out of it,” Dean smiled down at him. Cas returned it and tugged Dean down to meet his lips in a kiss.
Cas smiled softly at him, “I know why you did it. When I pulled you out, I had to put you back together. I was able to read your mind and see your memories.  It’s not your fault.” Sam nodded weakly and glanced up as Castiel offered his hand. He took it, the angel seemingly using no strength to help Sam back to his feet despite about half a foot shorter with a smaller build. “Are you ready to go inside and see your family?”
That night, after Kaia and Jack had fallen asleep, Claire snuck out to the kitchen to grab a bottle of water. She figured John would be passed out by now and it would be safe to make it the short distance but she was once again proven wrong - perhaps when Cas pissed Fate off, it extended to her as his vessel’s biological child.
“No, we’re not flying. We’re driving. Get in the car,” he said and gestured behind him. Cas stared at him for a long minute before he silently made his way to the passenger side and slid into the front. Dean smirked, glancing at Sam inside the store. He wasn’t gonna tell the angel to move.
“You mean since this morning?” Bobby said gruffly. “Not too much. There have been some more strange, biblical occurrences, but we still don’t know who or why besides demons.”
“What’s with all of the shouting?” he asked, Dean entirely blocking his view of Jack.
?” Jack frowned as he looked between the two men. Despite having visited Mary several times, John had never been present, and thus, Jack had yet to meet him.
By the end of the second movie, Claire was tired, eyes drooping as she fought to stay awake, Jack rambling beside her about some obscure detail of the scene on the screen.
The gas pump jolted to a stop and Dean pulled it out, setting it back in its holster before sliding into the driver's seat. “So what have you been up to?”
“I mean... “ Dean shrugged. “Alright, so it’s a little suspicious but that’s just what he’s like.”
Jack was still sitting in the kitchen when Claire and Kaia returned to the bunker with Cas.
“We can take care of ourselves, tell Bobby he’s got nothing to worry about,” Sam said. “Besides, Bobby’s the one that’s getting old.”
“Think there’s anything interesting in them?’ She asked, pursing her lips.
“Sounds a little bit unrealistic, Sammy, we don’t even know if that’s how these things work,” Dean said and dropped onto his bed. “We’re so fucking screwed. How do we save people that don’t actually need saving?”
While Jack was still naive in many ways, he knew better than to listen to a stranger promising him anything, especially when he noted the way that his friends reacted to her. Grateful that he and Rowena had been working on his teleportation abilities lately, he grabbed Claire and Kaia’s hands, teleporting them back to the outside of the bunker without any warning.
So it was a good thing when two demons knocked on their motel room door.
“I have to go get ready!” Claire said and kissed Cas’ cheek before continuing down the hall to her bedroom. So maybe she liked teasing her dads, there was nothing wrong with that. They deserved it anyway.
This time when someone appears in the doorway, Dean can hear it.
“It’s okay,” Dean confirmed. “I love you, I love you more than anything, Claire. Nothing you do will ever change that. You are...you and Jack, and Cas and Sam...you all mean the world to me.” Claire’s lip wobbled as she stared up at Dean.
“Dean,” Cas said urgently, when his boyfriend picked up the phone, “Something went wrong.”
“He just ran off?” Dean asked, incredulous and frustrated.
Kaia knelt beside her, ignoring the brief flare of annoyance she felt at the wet grass on her knees, “It’s not stupid. You’ve lost so much of your life in such a short time. It makes sense that it would hit you at some point.”
Dean and Mary exchanged a look, and then Mary turned to Jo, “You’re absolutely positive?”
“It doesn’t say anything about that,” Jack said with a frown. Claire sighed and closed the book in front of her. “At least now we know. Now all I have to do is figure out what my deepest truth is and speak it.”
It took almost forty minutes but eventually, the bunker door was opening, Claire and Jack jumping up from their seats to yell “Happy Birthday!” in unison.
“I’m not quite sure,” Castiel admitted. “That is information that has not been given to my rank, if it is available at all.”
“Cas?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrows.
“He’s so mad at me,” Claire groaned and dropped her head to the table. “Now I’m gonna get the silent treatment for like a week.”
Turns out, it takes a really fucking long time to
“Thank you,” she whispered, biting her lip to hold back the tears. As fucked up as her and Cas’ relationship was, she knew that her dad - that Jimmy - never would have accepted her for who she truly was.
“Just be careful,” Jack insisted. When Claire agreed, he turned and knocked on the door, entering with a bright smile and happy greeting. Claire waited for just a moment before hurrying down the hallway. The building wasn’t too big, only one floor, so it didn’t take her long to find the janitors’ closet, knocking with a deep breath.
“Bela,” Sam tried again, but she interrupted him again.
“Nah, Lawrence, actually,” Dean smirked as the man laughed loudly.
Dean clapped Jack on the shoulder, “We know, kid, Sister Jo told us. We’re just sorry we couldn’t have been there to help you. Nobody should have to kill their own father. If you have some weird feelings or you wanna talk about it, or anything, that’s okay.”
. “What time do you want to leave in the morning?”
I regret more in my entire existence. I would give up everything I have to make things right for you.” Claire just watched him for a very long moment, eyes watering a little.
“I love you too, angel,” Dean pulled back, adjusting his position so Cas could lay his head in Dean’s lap. “Jack is doing well with his training. His control is miles better than it was when he was born.”
When they finally drove back to the festival area, Dean was actually happy that they couldn’t talk to each other for a while. They had both shared so many stories and secrets that night, talked about their future together and about all the ways they are going to try to keep in touch. They had fallen asleep in each other’s arms for short periods of time, made some short and absolutely ridiculous videos with Castiel’s camera, and also simply sat together in silence. It broke Dean’s heart to know that the festival is going to end very soon now and that after that they would have to part ways again.
When they had to stop at the outer gates of the festival area, Dean revved the engine, which only intensified the vibrations of the balls. Castiel moaned and hoped their motorcycle tour wouldn’t take too long.
“Turn around.” Dean told Castiel in a tone that left no room for protest, not that Castiel even thought about trying to protest. And so he turned around, enjoying the wonderfully warm waterfall running down his back, while Dean pressed himself against him once again and dragged his tongue along Castiel’s most sensitive part of his neck, making any word Castiel wanted to utter die out in a muffled whimper. Castiel threw his head back and braced himself against the wall as he felt Dean’s fingers circling his entrance before he pressed one in.
As Dean thought to himself that this might be their last shower together during their vacation, he continued pampering Castiel. Once they were both completely wet, Dean reached for the shampoo and started slowly massaging it into Castiel’s hair, taking special care when rinsing it out again, before he turned the water off. He reached for the shower gel, and slowly and thoroughly soaped Castiel’s entire body, making sure to cover him from head to toe with it.
Dean’s grip got tighter, his movements a bit faster. “See his wonderful big cock? It’s nice, but I’d much rather have you enjoy his very talented mouth. First, I want you to go over and wear out his jaw on your cock. Once you’ve come, I’m going to join you two. And while you are free to bite, lick, and suck on his neck as well as kiss him as much as you like, I’d like you to prepare him for me.
“Gabriel, you winged dick! You come down here, this very instant or I swear I will hunt you down and kill you!” Dean said, fuming with rage.
“Come on, don’t be a prude. There’s no better jerk-off-material than having a video of how you and I are having a good time! And as for the ‘ending up in wrong hands,’ you just have to make sure none of your brothers and sisters find the tape. You’ve got to hide it away in a place you can be sure they’ll never ever be looking for something naughty by you.”
Dean sighed. “You know, as much as I like you being the rational one, sometimes I truly hate you for being so matter-of-fact and practical about everything.” Dean said, frustrated, and moved slightly in the shower to turn on the water. Once the temperature was right, he stood right beneath the warm spray and just enjoyed it. Only seconds later, hands were wrapped around his hip, starting to caress his upper body, before one of them moved lower and over his again half-hardened cock, giving it some gentle strokes.
Dean was relieved when he saw that Cas has apparently given up his "I’m so powerful and just as strong as you are Dean“-mannerism and finally gave in to staying in bed and taking all the medicine he needed to get well again. Over the next couple of days he brought Castiel all his meals directly to his bed, always accompanied by a pot of freshly-brewed tea and a small plate with his meds.
When Dean and Donnie finally got out of the castle, they passed the registration line, and Dean felt happy that, although he and Cas had arrived a bit late, they hadn’t arrived at this hour because the actual registration line was now thrice the length it had been when they had arrived.
“I don’t care! I can bring it to you once it’s done!” Dean replied in an angry tone.
to be any other way.”
Dean didn’t really care so he just left it on and instead coated his dick, aligned it to Castiel’s still very well stretched hole, and gently rocked into him. And when Castiel moaned and slowly threw his head back, Dean buried his face in the hollow of his throat, kissing and biting it.
Dean made Castiel wear the backpack, and while holding on to one of his hands he dragged him out the door. As they walked down the stairs and towards the castle’s gate, Castiel could constantly feel the balls moving, stimulating his inside, driving him wild already. When they were out of the castle, Dean led him straight to some guys with motorcycles.
Then Dean suddenly pulled off and blew a stream of air against the head of Castiel’s dick, and the sensory overload Castiel felt made him almost lose his mind, “Fuck, Dean! S-sooo good. M-moooore,” was all Castiel could stutter.
A couple of minutes later Dean walked in again. “Stubborn little fallen angel-butt!” Dean murmured. Ever since he had fallen, Cas had trouble coping with the fact that he was no longer an angel, but a full-on human now, which included all the ups and unfortunate downs that come with it, meaning Cas had been sick for the past several weeks now. First he had a rather nasty stomach bug and then, as soon as he got a little bit better, he caught a very persistent cold.
“Yes, why?”
But all the touching and kissing made Castiel oversensitive and he longed for nothing more than finally feel Dean reclaim him in the only way left, by fucking him into the mattress and thereby confirm that he truly was the one and only man that was ever allowed to fuck him.
Castiel was about to say something but then kept his mouth shut instead. He wondered if Dean had brought his own little video camera with which he continuously recorded and documented his and Dean’s whole vacation.
“Well if you want to know, you have to open it.” Dean said, a wide smile on his face.
“Yes, yes, you are right. I’ve been very naughty, please you need to punish me. Please just don’t stop. Use me! Use my whole body if you want to, just… fuck! Just… don’t stop.” Castiel begged.
When they finally broke apart, Castiel only whispered three words, “Thank you, Dean,” before he kissed him once more. And when their touches and kisses became more heated again, the two of them got out of the Jacuzzi, switched it off along with the music, blew out all the candles, and walked towards their bathroom and into the shower.
Luckily, Dean currently didn’t have to decide anything because, while he was still thinking, Castiel took matters into his own hands, literally.
When Castiel finally opened his eyes, he could see a smirk curving Dean’s lips. “So how was that for punishment, my dear Castiela? You still think I was unfair?”
“Dean, don’t be mad at Gabriel! You know his ways and that he has probably been a trickster for far too long to now behave any different! Let’s simply focus on the positive and nice things: Thanks to you I’m fully recovered again, the two of us are going on a beautiful vacation for two weeks, and not only are we going to be completely alone on our trip, but I also know a lot of places where we can have as much sex as we both can possibly stand. You’ll be able to scream your lungs out all day long while I take you in every way imaginable and for miles and miles there won’t be any other human being who can hear you scream my name when I make you come over and over again.”
what I’m saying!” Dean said, tightening the grip on Castiel’s hands. “I’m just overwhelmed by the effort and care you put into this. Castiel, you know I like you very much and although it was probably THE best reunion I’ve ever experienced, I’m just baffled by the cute considerate way you planned all this. I might have expected to see you dressed in some skimpy drag someday, but THIS,” Dean pointed to the skirt in Castiel’s hands, “this is truly something special! Not least because the skirt in combination with the same-colored lilac shirt emphasizes the beautiful and deep ocean you claim are your eyes.”
And so Dean didn’t stop; he didn’t stop looking into Castiel’s blown out eyes in which the fire of the candles was reflected beautifully, he didn’t stop trying to memorize how each and every single part of Castiel’s body felt and tasted like, and he didn’t stop pleasuring himself, but most of all Castiel, until both of them climaxed and he saw Castiel’s beautiful pre-, mid-, and post-coital face, again.
“Yeah, I feel the same way. But hey, at least you filmed a lot with that camera of yours so you won’t forget this awesome trip we took. And you know, come to think about it - you said you still got plenty of tape left, right?”
“Just hold on for a second,” Dean said, and reached for the camera. “Now, where were we?” Dean asked with a wide lusty grin on his face while holding the camera focused on Castiel.
When they arrived at the motel, they both got out of the car and Castiel held his small purse right in front of him the whole time, hoping the new shirt and the purse would cover the remaining cum stains on it. Dean just grabbed his duffle bag from the back seat and followed Castiel up the stairs, all the while pinching Castiel in the ass. “Stop it, Dean.”
“You were saying?” Dean asked, before he returned to kissing Castiel’s neck, slowly sliding downwards Castiel’s body again, all the while putting gentle kisses through Castiel’s ridden up shirt.
But before Castiel could either say or do anything about the utter pleasure he now felt renewing the heat of lust within his body, Dean had already put Castiel’s arms around his waist and was driving them away from the parking lot.
After a while the boxes of tissue Dean brought to Cas got less, the trash was emptied on a less frequent basis, and sleeping pills were exchanged for books –fun books, NOT RESEARCH books!- and DVD’s, as they helped Cas just as much while having the advantage of enjoyment while falling asleep. It appeared that nothing could stop them from putting all their plans into action now. Their vacation was saved!
Castiel’s eyes immediately flew open and he leaned in for a kiss. “Thank you, my brave, big hunter of sexual adventures. Now please… Make me come, I’m tired and tomorrow’s going to be a long day. Please, haven’t I’ve been a very good and submissive servant today? Don’t I deserve a reward for that?” Castiel asked pleadingly.
Surprised, Dean pulled away, only to see that Castiel had taken a picture of the two of them, kissing and in front of what certainly has to be the most beautiful sunset Dean had ever seen in his entire life. He smiled, and after he took another look at the sunset, he faced Castiel again, and said with a smirk, “I love you too, my little, sometimes waaaaay too romantic, Castiel. It seems like you just can’t shake off that angelic innocence and lovey-dovey stuff that is incorporated into your surname.”
He still couldn’t believe that Dean actually chose to be with him and to spend more than just one night with him. Before he met Dean he only had one relationship, which had lasted for four years. He and April had been very happy together and they had even already had made plans to get married, but then one fateful night he had caught her cheating on him with one of his best friends. He had been heartbroken and had immediately taken the chance to accompany his sister Anna and her friend for a vacation at their mum’s in America. Castiel had felt like he could never love again and the last thing on his mind was falling in love with anybody for a very long time – and least of all someone like Dean.
“And I know many ways to make it even better,” Castiel muttered, switching on some music on his cellphone that was docked into a music speaker system, and holding two glasses of champagne in front of his face. Dean opened his eyes, smiled, and took one of the glasses.
It took a while but then he heard Gabriel on the other side of the line,
Dean had been turned on from the second he had started to prepare Castiel for his little surprise, and once they were on the road it was almost unbearable for him to restrain himself from coming on the bike, too. But now, as soon as he turned on the engine, he just couldn’t and didn’t want to wait any longer and so when Castiel came underneath him, he just let go too and came with a long and happy cry of Castiel’s name on his lips, emptying himself inside his boyfriend until even the last bit of his release was squeezed out of him by the convulsions of Castiel’s ass.
Castiel swallowed hard, but instantly obeyed. He put his shoes back on and got out of the car, bend over the hood, and spread his arms and legs, looking at Dean through the windshield, pleadingly.
“So, did you like it?” Dean asked after both of them had taken off their helmets and Dean had turned around and was now sitting backwards on the motorcycle, facing Castiel.
“I started putting kisses all over her body and every time some clothing got in the way, I removed it and replaced that area with soft touches and kisses, right up until she was completely naked.”
“Ok, that’s it!” Dean took Cas’ notebook and threw it on the table before he grabbed Castiel and threw him over his shoulder. “He that will not hear must feel!” And with these words in mind he started walking, while Castiel’s complaints about Dean carrying him and still having way to many unfinished things on his to-do-list for their vacation started to ebb away the closer they got to the bedroom. By the time they walked through the bedroom door, Castiel had fallen quiet and Dean, assuming Cas had actually fallen asleep, put him cautiously down on the bed.
“Are there any post-coital words you’d like to share with the camera, Cas?” Dean asked, now focusing the camera on Castiel.
After only a few seconds post coital bliss he felt Castiel’s hand roving over his upper body and neck until it rested under Dean’s head. Slowly Castiel pressed their heads together and whispered into Dean’s ear, “Are you aware that you just said ‘I love you’ for the very first time to me?” Dean’s eyes immediately snapped open in terror, but he relaxed once he heard Castiel continue, “and I just wanted to say ‘Thank you!’ I know these words aren’t something that cross your lips very easily or often and I feel proud and honored that you finally said them.”
“Oh please don’t stop on my behalf, Cas. Feel free to continue.” Dean said with a smirk.
Castiel groaned steadily and in perfect rhythm with each and every of Dean’s movements, relishing the joyful slap of flesh against flesh and the obscene noises Dean made while lecturing him about his naughty behavior.
“You like that?”
“That sounds great, I wonder if someone saw you.” Dean said, as he concentrated his oral caresses on Castiel’s balls now, licking and sucking on them.
And unlike so many times during their vacation, Dean once again, like in their first night together some days ago, didn’t rush the act but took his time, enjoying the admittedly nice lightning, the constant almost wave-like thrusting into his lover, and the continual soft moaning of Castiel. It almost felt like a lulling of Castiel to sleep, and Dean enjoyed every single second of it, thinking to himself that this indeed was just the perfect way to end their mutual nights together.
“You mean…“
Dean looked into Castiel’s blown-out eyes and the tousled hair and he thought that he honestly hadn’t seen anything more beautiful for a long time. The way Castiel’s eyes and lips pleaded, the desperation that was written all over his face, made Dean happy to know that his refractory period was still unbelievably short and they probably won’t encounter many other cars on the rest of the road towards their final destination.
Dean kissed Castiel and moved with him towards the bed before he pushed him down onto it. “Not so fast my little angel.” Dean said as he took off his shirt and jacket and let both fall down to the floor. “I promised I’d reclaim your whole body with a thousand million kisses and I intend to make good on my promise.” Dean said with a smirk and started to slowly strip down to just his boxers.
“Cas, I… I…” Dean had completely lost the ability to speak any coherent sentences. THIS was absolutely NOTHING like the things he had imagined; or rather, it actually was but in a kind of twisted –yet very pleasurable- way. Of course he had fantasized about becoming more intimate with Castiel in the car, but ever since they had reunited, he was overwhelmed by Castiel’s self-confidence and the initiative he had shown repeatedly.
“I mean, not that your blowjobs aren’t already a masterpiece in themselves, but the cold sensation I felt while you were doing it? Jesus Christ, THAT was truly something I’ve never felt before! How did you do that?”
“Castiel, hurry up. I can’t wait any longer to once again bury my cock inside his tight wet hole. I want to fuck him. And I want to fuck him right now!” Dean said, his voice thick with lust and desire.
“Dean? Dean what-“
Castiel and Dean had been on the road for quite a while when curiosity got the better of Castiel and he finally asked, “Ok, Dean. I didn’t ask, because I didn’t want to prolong our stay even further, but seeing that we are now even ahead of our schedule, tell me, what did you buy? What is in the shopping bag?”
Castiel became more desperate, his hips bucked up and all he wanted was to feel Dean make him come while he was inside him. “Deeeean, pleeease. Please, I need you in me. Pleeeease… please!”
Castiel went into the bathroom, tossed the clothes on the floor with his panties on top of the pile and was just about to step into the shower when he took a final look into the mirror right above the sink. He smiled when he realized how absolutely ridiculous he looked with his messy hair. After he removed the light make-up he was wearing and washed away the dried cum around his dick, he looked into the mirror again and his mind began to wander.
“Oh, it’s a real pity that
“And seeing you enjoying it is worth every penny!” Dean said, clinking their classes, and raised the glass to his lips.
Or maybe… Castiel’s fantasies were abruptly interrupted when Dean suddenly reached behind himself and turned on the engine. Once again, Castiel felt the vibrations of the engine being transferred directly through his whole body, but this time it didn’t intensify the vibration of the balls within him, but instead made Dean’s pecker, which was buried deep inside his ass, hum with unnatural power.
The next day was filled with all kinds of excitement and new experiences. The festival had begun and both, Castiel and Dean, just indulged in the moment. They met a lot of new people, listened to some great bands, and just ate and drank without any restrictions. From time to time one of them disappeared, only to come back shortly afterwards with a completely blissed out look, or when the other one got curious, to be found in some dark corner, being sucked off or fucking some random person, enjoying the fact that the other one came to watch him getting off.
“Fuck, Cas! Yes, just like that.”
But before Cas had the opportunity to tell Sam that he had meant having a whole bunch of completely sex-unrelated ideas to distract Dean, Dean was already standing by his side… with his sexy sunglasses put on. “Oh boy,” Cas thought and swallowed hard. This sight alone made him wish he could make Sam magically disappear and jump Dean this very instant and ravish him right here on the spot; and considering the fact that the last few weeks have been completely free of any form of sex due to him being sick, really didn’t make it any easier for him. Cas immediately had a visual flashback of the numerous times Dean rubbed in a cooling mentholated ointment on his chest, during which he just couldn’t help but moan lustfully under Dean’s soft touches. He admired Dean’s ability to keep an absolutely stern and concentrated look on his face during all these times, and he especially admired Dean's ability to resist the urge of fucking him in those situations when it evidently turned him on...a lot!
Looking straight into the emerald green eyes that were observing and studying him, Castiel answered, “You cou-uuuh-uld say that,” his voice spiked with a moan, relishing in the feeling of being stretched and filled up by a number of ever growing rubber balls.
“Do I like it? Are you kidding? From the moment I saw you leaning against my car, I already imagined to bend you over the hood and take you nice and hard; but now that I know it’s you, I’m even more impatient to finally fuck you completely senseless.” Dean said as he let his hands wander down Castiel’s sides and over his ass, massaging his cheeks in a circular manner.
“Ok, how about we spice things up a bit? We play one match, and whoever wins gets to fuck the other one or suck him off or whatever you prefer, interested now?” Donnie asked, as he remembered the appraising look Dean had given him when they’d met.
“Missed you too, Dean. I… aaah…” Castiel groaned as Dean’s thrusts became harder. “Dean… Dean, I want you. I want all of you. Please… please, don’t stop.”
Castiel moaned, enjoying the sudden pleasurable intrusion and the way that although Dean had made a cut into the panties and was now in him it had only been a small cut and he therefore still felt the tight fabric all around his dick and balls.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel answered, Dean now gazing on Castiel’s soft, parted lips.
had had his reasons for booking specifically this room, although he hadn’t pictured it quite like this. Dean had thought more along the lines of sipping one or two beers and then make out on the balcony in all ways imaginable, making use of the fact that no one was able to see them.
Donnie just smirked, got down from the table, prepared all the balls, and indicated for Dean to do the break-off shot.
Dean smirked, “Touché. Ok, then no underwear but at least let me get you your pants. I don’t want you to freeze your balls off.”
When they arrived at the hotel, Castiel, even though it was still the middle of the day, was fast asleep. Dean looked over to him and smiled, enjoying the sight of Castiel’s relaxed features for second, before he pulled out his phone and took a picture. Quietly he opened and closed his door, and went to the reception area. After he was given the key, he went back to the car and tried to open the passenger’s side as quietly as possible. Slowly he leaned inside the car, unbuckled Castiel, and took him into his arms.
Dean had a very voluptuous mouth, one that was far too sensual for anybody to resist looking at it. Castiel immediately imagined it pressed against his lips, all over his skin, and of course wrapped around his dick. He had missed those beautiful soft lips so much and he just couldn’t wait to feel them all over his body once again. Dean raised an eyebrow, “Now, what are you looking at?” he asked.
“Yes, Dean! Yes! I want to feel you in me! I want to feel your giant cock fill me up like no one else can. I’ve missed it so much. I want it. I want it so bad.” Castiel pleaded.
Castiel made a pitiful noise at the loss, which was quickly replaced by a moan, as he felt something pressed against and inside his entrance again, something other than Dean’s fingers.
Castiel, not asleep at all, instantly tried to stand up again, but getting dizzy by doing so, he quickly regretted his decision and slowly sat back down onto the bed. But sitting was not enough; therefore Dean pushed him all the way down on the bed until he was lying on it comfortably, all the while scolding Cas for behaving worse than a sick little child. Knowing any further actions or words would be futile, Castiel lets Dean tuck him into bed and cover him up with an additional overly comfortable duvet. And when Dean told him not to move and that he would be back in a second, he obeyed willingly and didn't move an inch from where Dean had tucked him in.
Although Castiel was in a very unstable position and just tried to hold on to something, anything, on the motorcycle to not fall off it, he couldn’t help but enjoy the situation. He could hear the street nearby and began thinking about the fact that maybe someone else could come and see them. He was always one for fantasies about getting caught, and right now he couldn’t stop imagining just that.
“No, Cas, there are no buts! Do as I say and don’t even think about talking back! You’re not an angel anymore and when you get sick you can’t just ignore it and hope it will get away on its own!” Cas snuffled and tried to speak, but before he was able to reply to Dean in any given way, he sneezed again and had to use his last tissue to wipe his nose. Annoyed, Dean shook his head, stepped one step closer to Cas, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and said, “are you going back to your bed on your own or do I have to shove you back into it?” His angry glare was met with tired and red swollen eyes looking up at him.
Castiel’s breathing became faster. He swallowed hard. “Later, Dean. We need to get to our room first. I don’t want us to get arrested for indecent exposure.” Dean looked afflicted, but forced himself to move away from Castiel. “Well then, please lead the way.” Dean said, his eyes filled with lust.
“Please, don’t. Just leave it. I think the light illuminates this room beautifully.” Castiel whispered pleadingly.
Cas couldn’t help but wonder.
“Only if you promise to keep looking into the mirror, Cas. Can you do that for me?” Dean asked as he continued moving his fingers in and out Castiel, brushing repeatedly over his prostate.
Dean smiled, this just had to be the most cliché romantic picture ever, but just for once he didn’t mind. After all, he knew that Castiel was a hopeless romantic and probably put a lot of effort into it, and come to think about it, he
Castiel felt overwhelmed by the sensation of having Dean fill him up with these ever-growing balls and the fireworks of pleasure they ignited within him each and every time they brushed over his most sensitive spot. He felt like he couldn’t take this pleasurable torture any more, couldn’t take in any more of these balls, couldn’t endure to withhold his orgasm any longer.
But luckily, this didn’t mean they couldn’t fuck again this very weekend. He had fucked that guy on the pool table, just as he had wished to do, and although he knew Donnie is certainly going to insist on a rematch, it’s probably going to be much more difficult for them to have that much privacy again. So instead of starting to walk back to the castle, he looked around the empty and very dark parking lot.
Dean didn’t need time to think about Castiel’s offer but followed him immediately. The both of them didn’t say a word during their whole shower, but simply enjoyed washing each other’s bodies thoroughly. Afterwards, they went back into their room, put on new boxer shorts and shirts, and crawled back into bed.
“Shh, Castiel. Go back to sleep! Yes, we’ve arrived but don’t worry, everything’s fine,” Dean said. He carried Castiel into the hotel, and up to their room, thankful that instead of having to carry him up the stairs, he could use the elevator to get them to their hotel room on the fifth floor. Once he laid Castiel on the massive California-King-size-bed, he went back downstairs to take their luggage out of the trunk and lock the car.
Castiel just smirked and shook his head while coating his fingers generously with lube, before he started circling Dean’s entrance. Slowly and very gently, Castiel pressed his middle finger in, moving it in and out of Dean, before he began to wiggle it inside the surrounding tight ring of muscle, “Fuck, Cas! That feels… aaah… that feels amazing. Please don’t stop.” Dean panted.
Castiel giggled internally, remembering the first time they had kissed and enjoying that although Dean had accused him of being too romantic, he still did just the same thing right now, making them both nostalgic. Castiel groaned, spurring Dean on; their kiss now became harder, hotter, and more intensive and Castiel pressed their bodies even tighter together as he got swept away in the passion of the moment.
“Shhh! Just enjoy, sexy!“ Castiel said as he closed the small distance that was still left between them and kissed Dean, his heart beating so fast he was afraid it would explode any minute now. When he pulled away again, he explained, “I took an earlier flight and booked us a nice room in a nearby motel.”
“Cas, I think it’s better if we get into the car and drive to your motel room now. At least then we won’t have to worry about scarring some kids for life.” Dean said with a wink, walked towards the driver’s side of the car, and got in.
“Yeah, it definitely is a surprise. And what a nice one, too!” Dean whistled appreciatively as he looked up and down Castiel’s body. “But Cas… I really don’t think I can wait,” Dean said as he leaned closer and breathed aroused into Cas’ ear, “it has been far too long. I just have to have you. And I have to have you
Castiel didn’t know where it suddenly came from but Dean was now holding a pocketknife in his hand, lowering it towards his panties. “Dean? Dean what are you doing?” Castiel asked, panic in his voice.
“Yes, Dean. I like that. But I’d much rather like you in me.” Castiel said, his voice filled with desire and already somewhat croaky.
“Thank you for this wonderful and eventful vacation, and for all the wonderful surprises you have thought of. Thank you for your infectious enthusiasm that got me all aflutter just to get you a ticket for this event so I could see that wonderful sparkle in your eyes whenever you heard one of your favorite bands playing. Thank you for showing me once again that you not only have a wild and animalistic sexual side, but also a very gentle and caring one, too. But most of all, thank you for being such an amazing boyfriend with whom I can have so much fun and with whose help I can grow and become more self-confident and open for all kinds of new experiences.”
And while Dean was once again the one to get their bags, accompanied by one of the guys, Donnie, who offered to help him bring up their stuff, Castiel kept chatting with Amelia, happy to know that before they left the car he had taken some condoms out of Dean’s duffle and stuffed them in his pockets.
Dean started kissing Castiel while simultaneously opening Castiel’s jeans. “So, now tell me what exactly did you do all alone with Amelia up here?” Dean asked, moving away from Castiel’s mouth and roving over Castiel’s neck and ears, while sliding one of his hands under Castiel’s shirt, caressing the warm body beneath it.
In the evening, Dean declared he had to take care of something in town and would have to leave Castiel alone for a while. Castiel just smiled, happy that he now had the perfect opportunity to prepare something nice for the both of them. Dean came back about 45 minutes later, and was immediately confused that the room was dark. But then he saw that the balcony was filled with tea candles, and that a few of them even extended into the hotel room.
Finally all of them were out and Castiel suddenly felt the emptiness inside him glaringly obvious. He longed for the feeling of being filled again, but this time with something much more human. “Dean. Please. I… I want you inside me.”
Frustrated he fell back on the bed. “Well, that’s just fan-freakin-tastic!” Dean said unnerved.
Quickly Dean took hold of Castiel’s cock and began sucking on it, while Castiel did the same with Dean’s cock. They both enjoyed sucking each other off right until Dean at some point let go of Castiel’s cock, and moaned, “Cas, please if you want to fuck me, just do it. Do it now or I can’t guarantee I won’t come before the main event.”
“Well, it was supposed to be a surprise and I didn’t want to spoil it. I wanted to make something special for you and also hurry up the process of us getting a room where we can celebrate our reunion.”
“Well, I wore it, washed it accordingly, and everything’s fine. Now I just have to put it back in my suitcase and take care that nothing happens to it until I can sneak it back in between her other skirts”
“Dean, I…” Castiel began to protest but couldn’t finish as Dean pulled him in for another kiss and by holding on to Cas’ ass slowly shoved him backwards until Castiel was pressed against the car.
done.” Dean said dominantly, panting desperately as he was chasing his orgasm. One last hard thrust and Dean came long and hard inside Castiel.
Of course they were going to return to Skype-sessions once they were separated again, but it just wasn’t the same. Although he would be able to see Castiel and talk to him during these sessions and also via phone, it was different. That precious sparkle Dean adored was too subtle and well hidden inside the oceans Castiel called his eyes to ever get transmitted via webcam.
Normally Dean would just tease and laugh at anyone with similar symptoms, tell them to just walk it off, but this was Cas… his oh so lovely and very fragile Cas… the man whose whole body he absolutely enjoyed to cover with a thousand tender kisses… the only person he ever allowed to watch him sleep – although it still freaked him out sometimes. Cas, the only man he ever truly cared about as his lover. Sure he had tons and tons of one-night stands with both, guys and girls, but apart from Lisa and Castiel, he had never given much thought to his endless number of booty calls and what happened to them once he left them after sex. All he ever cared about -especially when fucking guys- was that he, Dean, had a good time.
“No problem.” Dean said as he wrapped his hands around Castiel’s right leg and gently let his hands wander downwards until he could lift the foot up to remove the other sandal. Once he was done he threw the shoe on the floor and kept Castiel’s leg in its position with his thighs clasped around it. He let his hands wander up and down Castiel’s legs and over his sides. Then he began to kiss Castiel’s thigh and moved towards his navel, putting soft light kisses on the skin.
After the shower, they lay down in bed again, kissing and caressing each other until both were lying on their sides and Dean was cuddled up against Castiel’s back, one arm under Castiel’s head, the other one loosely around Castiel’s waist, and only the moonlight that shone through the balcony door illuminated their features.
“I said, when I realized she was about to come, I just couldn’t resist any longer. I just had to be inside her.”
“Cas, I…” Dean closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath, trying to regain a little bit of control. When he reopened them, he looked directly into Castiel eyes and uttered in a gravelly deep voice, “Cas, get out of the car and bend over the hood. I already had to dismiss the opportunity to fuck you on the hood while you are wearing a skirt once, I’m not willing to dismiss it a second time!”
“No but really, tell me, did you like them?” Dean asked, purring the question into Castiel’s ear, before Castiel’s body happily swallowed up the next ball.
“Aaaah… Dean.” Castiel moaned as he felt the soft suck on his neck and Dean’s fingers trailing softly over his arms and sides. Once he was done, Dean leaned up again, admiring the big hickey he made. He smiled and whispered into Castiel’s ear, “Now everyone will know you are mine. Mine alone.” Castiel moaned again, the thought of Dean being so possessive over him made him shudder with lust and pride. Pride over the fact that Dean had chosen him, and him alone, to be his… and not just for the moment but hopefully also for a very long time in the future.
“I hope you liked the appetizer because I just can’t wait to show you the main course.” Dean said while grabbing Castiel’s ass, pressing their lower bodies closer together, and while still bearing a mischievous smile on his face, he said, “I guess you’ve already realized that my little present aren’t just normal anal beads,” Dean said, now swaying their hips back and forth.
This was about the fact that he was finally reunited with his boyfriend again, the one person that truly accepted him the way he was, with all his flaws. This was about the fact that he had actually found someone who was able to look beside his facade and see the real Dean, the one that literally did everything for the people he loved. The real Dean, who was compassionate and sensitive and who cared for the other sexual partner’s satisfaction just as much as for his own.
“We didn’t even know… we found out you were in Hell the night that we killed Azazel,” Mary started, already fighting back tears, “We had no idea.”
“Ain’t no thing, Cas,” Dean shrugged. “I needed to check under here anyway, she’s a classic, she requires some delicate attention.”
“We’ll meet you halfway,” Cas insisted. “Which way are you going to drive?”
“You didn’t raise them to be anything,” Claire said instead. She still didn’t know the full story but Dean had divulged a bit more since John’s return. “You are nothing but a sperm donor to them. You took two innocent little boys and you made them into your weapons. You’re no better than the demon that killed your wife.”
Dean woke up first as usual and he left Cas in bed, clinging to his pillow. He glanced into Claire’s room, frowning when she wasn’t asleep on her bed; Claire never woke up early if she could help it. Dean walked a bit faster down the hall, intent on checking the kitchen, but he walked past the open doorway of the rec room, he froze because there, on the couch, were Jack and Claire.
“The one in Salina, it sounds like a rugaru,” Dean said. “You should take it. But you should bring someone with you, they can be a bitch to take down.”
They claimed one of the tables in the corner of the room, choosing a spot where they could survey everyone in the room. They placed orders for appetizers, and waited for something to happen. It became obvious fairly quickly that something was wrong. The people around them behaved as if they had never been in public before, some were shoving food down their throats as if they’d been starved for weeks, while others pulled from bottles of hard alcohol with a total lack of restraint. Worse still, were the couples groping and grinding helplessly as if nobody could see them.
“What did you just say?” Dean asked once he had finished coughing, looking at Jack intently.
“I don’t think I’ve actually seen them,” Claire admitted. Jack’s eyes went wide.
“Oh, nothing really,” Jack said, hoping it sounded as nonchalant as he meant it to. “Just hung out.”
Dean swallowed heavily, not at all expecting Cas’ heartfelt response. No one outside his family had ever talked about him like that, and he wasn’t entirely sure how to respond. “Well, Cas, that’s...that’s good to hear. And I am glad that you’re helping Sam out, I really am, especially when Mom and I can’t.”
“It’s not looking great for Gabriel’s side,” she commented, “They definitely weren’t prepared enough to deal with a threat of this size, and it looks like Gabriel is keeping your nephilim as far away from it as possible.”
“Nothing really, just that he’s probably more likely to respond to your prayer,” Sam said with a shrug. “I mean, me and him, we’re close but it’s different than you guys.” Dean grumbled at that.
The two men, or rather man and angel, continued walking around the block, their conversation staying more lighthearted rather than focus on Sam’s trauma. Once they reached the house again, Sam stopped Cas with a hand on his shoulder.
Cas nodded, though Dean couldn’t see him, “Do you want me to… I think I could get him back to Lebanon if you…”
The next time Claire woke up, she was in a bed in a dark room. She grumbled, sitting up slowly. As her eyes adjusted she realized she was in her room at the bunker. She saw the bottle of water sitting on her bedside table and grabbed it, gulping it down without pause. After a few minutes of psyching herself up, she stood, taking a deep breath at the pain shooting through her leg, though it wasn’t as bad as she remembered. She made her way out of her room and down the hallway. She eventually found Dean and Cas in what everyone but Dean called the rec room - he still insisted it was the Dean cave.
“Forget it,” Sam ran a hand through his hair as he searched for the words. “We’ve grieved, Dad. We have mourned and we have moved on. It’s time for you to do the same.”
“Really good! Dean let me help him on a hunt!” Jack said proudly, puffing up his chest just a bit in the exact way Dean did.
“Dean does the same when he’s working on his car,” Castiel said, abandoning his book without a second thought.
. They had to wait almost three hours before Pestilence had finally retreated to his office where only his secretary was nearby. They agreed that Sam and Dean would get closer to make sure he didn’t slip out during the alarm with everybody else and Cas would actually be the one to pull the trigger. They all got into positions and on Dean’s visual command, Cas set off the fire alarm. Sam and Dean waited until they saw the secretary hurry down the hall before rushing the office door, throwing it open with their guns aimed at Pestilence as soon as they saw the demon.
“You are Castiel. You are an angel of the Lord, or you were,” Jack said, looking at Dean again, eyes dropping to his chest where Cas’ grace lay. “You are my father.”
“Well, this big thing is the engine,” Dean started and began explaining what every part was and its purpose. Castiel listened diligently, asking questions at random intervals, and every so often repeating something back to Dean to make sure he understood it correctly. Dean was more than happy to talk about his car, eventually looking over at Cas to see the angel was watching him with a soft smile and crinkled eyes. Dean felt himself blush as he looked down at his hands, stumbling over what he was saying. “T-That’s about it.”
“What the fuck was that?” He yelled at Dean, mouth slack and breathing heavy.
“Purgatory. Where he belongs,” Jack said simply. “And now, you’ll be able to live here in Heaven, without having to fear anything or anyone.”
“I can’t believe this,” John shook his head in disbelief. “Does no one know what a proper greeting looks like?”
“Nothing out of the ordinary,” Mary called back. “Just some extremely clean floors.” Dean choked back a laugh.
“You’ll have one badass scar from this,” Dean said with a grin, Claire returning it with a brighter one.
Sam rubbed the back of his neck, “I was thinking… since, for once the world isn’t ending… maybe I’d move out. Maybe Bela and I would move to Manhattan so that I could finish my degree up there.”
“It means that uh…” Sam huffed a laugh, “It means he thinks you’re attractive.”
A week in, John calls and tells Bobby the case is gonna take longer than he thought and that he’ll see him when he sees him.  Asks him if he’d taken Dean out shooting like he’d asked.
his eldest was, but she knew that wasn’t her place.
“What are you two doing up?” Claire asked, pouring herself a to-go mug of coffee.
Jo was wiping down the bar, humming along to whatever was playing from the jukebox when Sam, Dean and Mary walked through the door into the nearly-deserted bar. “Mom,” she called as she set down the rag she’d been using, “The Winchesters are here.”
She only sat on the edge of her bed, but she did clasp her hands together. “Hey Jack,” she started. “It’s uh...it’s been a while since I’ve done this but I figure you’re much more likely to listen then the last guy. I know you’re busy, so like, I don’t wanna keep you, but I needed to tell you.” Claire took a deep breath. She wasn’t even sure why she was doing this except she really was - Cas and Dean deserved this. “Your dads...our dads, they miss you. A lot more than they’re letting on. But Dean has been in the garage working on the Impala every day since you left, and Cas has been going crazy in his garden. I know you obviously can’t stay here or anything, but maybe you could come down more often? Something like a weekly family dinner night, I bet they’d like that.” Claire was silent for a moment, though she didn’t really expect an answer instantly. “Just figured you should know.” She sat up, dropping her hands to her legs. Hopefully the prayer got through.
Jack blinked in surprise, not having thought that far ahead, “I... I’m not sure.”
The hunt for Famine followed a similar trajectory to that of War and Pestilence. Jo and Ash worked tirelessly to build new algorithms to track signs of excessive famine, but the prevalence of world hunger made that feat incredibly difficult. In the lull between new drops of information from the news the Winchesters were tracking, or the output of Jo and Ash’s algorithms, Cas still dropped by to spend time with Sam in the morning, even as he grew to need it less, and Dean in the evenings.
“I just don’t know why Sam can’t talk to us,” Dean said to Mary over breakfast one day, before Sam was awake, “We’re his family.”
“What are you doing?” Jack asked, following Claire up the steps to the school building.
“Hello, Jack, did you need something?” Cas asked once he picked up. The kids were all fairly independent and wouldn’t call unless it was something serious.
“Claire? It’s late, are you alright?” she could tell he was concerned and if it was any other time, she might be irritated but considering she might bleed out, she figured he deserved a pass just this once.
“I guess.  I like it here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack waited until later that night, when Dean had retired to sit on the dock by himself and give Castiel and Jack some time alone, to bring up the subject again.
I ain’t their dad.”  He hung up and threw the phone.  It bounced on his ugly old couch and he wiped his hands over his face.  He heard a creak from the stairs, but as soon as he got around the corner to look there was nobody there.
It was Dean’s turn to laugh, “You’re one stupid son of a bitch if you think Yellow-Eyes is going to keep you around a second longer than necessary.”
“Well, it’s about a six-hour drive to the bunker, so if we leave at eight, we’ll get there at about three or four depending on how long our breaks are,” Claire mused. “Sound good?”
Sam looked around the room, noting that the gods seemed to be arguing over a wide range of topics, “I think we run,” replied Sam.
“There are over 600 possible seals that Lilith could break,” Cas started. “But to free Lucifer, she only needs to break 66.”
“It’s okay, it’ll be hard to avoid,” Claire said nonchalantly. “And obviously it’s true anyway. You two...you’re like my dads. And I haven’t one of those in ten years so it’s nice.” She noticed how guilty Cas looked at her statement.
Sam just nodded, unsure of whether Dean was referring to the demon or to his father. His body sagged as he allowed Dean to pull him into an awkward approximation of a hug. They sat there, staring at his lifeless body for what felt like hours, but was probably no more than a few minutes, before Dean stood up.
Sam and Dean agreed, jogging up the steps to the church, tugging their guns from their waistbands. “Ready?” Sam asked quietly and at Dean’s nod, pulled open the door and stepped in slowly. Dean followed cautiously, Castiel bringing up the rear until he got stopped right at the door.
Famine appeared much different than his brothers. While War and Pestilence were both strong, healthy, able-bodied men, Famine was old and frail, confined to an electric wheelchair with an oxygen tank strapped to the back.
“The spell that raised the spirits dealt with guilt, fear, and blame. The spirits your family saw blame them for their death, and in turn your family feels guilty. And while you feel guilty for the deaths of those you could not save, they do not blame you.” Cas explained.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel bowed his head briefly. “I look forward to seeing you again.” Cas was gone before Dean could process his words and when he finally did, they left his mouth gaping stupidly like a fish.
Bobby looked at his skinny arms and thought about Dean's response that first day.
“Shit,” Dean muttered. “Cas, I could really fucking use your help.”
“And Castiel,” Claire added with a smile, “That sounds so good. When do you start? I’ll have to get a job or something.”
“You were shouting Bela’s name, dude,” Dean explained, falling to sit on his own bed across from Sam. “And you sounded...you sounded pretty fucked up about it. About her.” Sam didn’t say anything at first, just rubbed his hands over his face.
Dean, whose face had softened as Sam explained the situation further, got up and pulled his brother into a hug, “It’s okay, Sammy.”
“It’s really him, Bobby,” said Dean, stepping forward to take the knife from Bobby’s hand, “He has been thoroughly tested.”
“Somehow you always know what to say,” he said, closing his eyes as he kept Cas’ hand pressed to his lips. Cas smiled a little.
Sam smiled slightly, still a bit wary of his new acquaintance. He walked over to the checkout desk, grateful when he found a functional landline. His call to Dean’s first cell phone didn’t go through so he checked the second, and then the third, all of which failed. He tried his mom, he tried Bobby, and then kicked himself for not having more phone numbers memorized.
Sam debated internally for a moment, “For some people, yeah. My dad made mixtapes for every mood for my mom when they were dating.”
“Hello again,” he said, smiling softly at her. “I was wondering if we could speak?”
“It starts in the beginning of September, so, we can spend the next four months doing whatever you want, and then we can go get settled in.”
Sam snored in the back seat, oblivious to the conversation going on in front of him. “Yes,” Cas said, “I understand that, but why can’t
“I should really bring tuberculosis back. That was a fun couple of decades,” Pestilence sighed wistfully.
Jack gestured toward the other chairs at the table, “I would love to get to know you better.”
“You’re hopeless without me, of course I’m gonna stick around. Gotta watch out for your sorry ass,” Dean felt hope blooming in his chest - for the first time that he could remember, he was going to have a
“Didn’t think angels would have a sense of humor,” he said. “So, you gonna tell me what Alastair was doing or am I gonna have to play Clue to figure out what he was doing in the attic with the reapers and the rope?”
After he hung up the phone, Sam grabbed the Bible that he had open near him on the library table and began searching for a specific passage. Before he could find it, however, he felt a gust of wind and when he looked up Bela was standing in front of him. She looked like she did the last time he saw her alive - before the Hellhounds had drug her down.
Cas nodded, “She responded really well, actually. I tried to cut him off but she actually agreed with him. I know that she’s aware that I didn’t actually father Jack, but, I think she understood what he meant.”
Sam nodded, “Uh, yeah, I was at Kansas State for three and a half years before I had to take some time off. Eventually I’ll finish up the last semester…”
“You got a kid?” John asked, ignoring Claire to look at Dean instead.
That night, Jack allowed Paperclip to sleep in his bed and he cuddled the dog, petting her gently until the early hours of the morning when he finally dozed off himself.
“Alright then, we’re gonna race. Starting and finish line is right outside my doorway, we go down toward the library, circle the tables once, and then continue around the hallway. Three laps total,” Claire said. “No magic allowed, but otherwise all forms of sabotage are encouraged. Any questions?”
In the end, Bobby drove one car, with their friends Jody and Donna, while Mary drove the car containing Dean and Jo. They all hid in the cemetery, matching looks of grim determination across their faces. They planned to come out in waves, so that they could maintain an edge with the element of surprise.
“I’m Agent Sims and this is my partner Agent Brookes,” Mary introduced themselves to the teacher, both holding their badges out to let him see. He was handcuffed and shackled to the table, wearing only his orange jumpsuit and white slip on shoes, but the real story was in his face and hands. His skin was pale and gaunt, as if he hadn’t been sleeping for days, his nails were bloodied and he had scratches all over his wrists and neck. “We just wanted to ask a few questions about the incident on Friday.” Dean took the chance to cough, saying
When he was finally able to pull himself away, Eileen had shown up as well. The five of them were all sitting out on the back porch of the cottage, overlooking the lake, as they drank and reminisced over their happy memories.
“I’ll do it when we get closer,” he said and pressed down on the pedal. True to his word, when they were about half an hour out of Davenport, they pulled over to fill up the tank. While the gas was pumping, Dean leaned against the trunk and closed his eyes. “Alright Cas, it’s show time. We tracked down Pestilence and we could use your help. We need your help actually.”
“Jack and I were going through one of the storage rooms when I found this bracelet and put it on,” Claire said before she could stop herself. “And now I have to tell the truth.”
“No,” Claire huffed and dug her spoon into her cereal. “I can’t just sit around her for another two weeks, though! I have to have something to do!”
Without Dean beside her, Claire collapsed into a chair and Kaia rushed over, cupping her face, “I’m so sorry I wasn’t there. I can’t believe this.”
Dean’s manifested in a small cottage on a lake with a pier, the Impala parked out front. The cottage looked as if it had been pulled straight from a fairytale, with vines and flowers creeping up toward the roof, with a small covered porch in front. Jack glanced around, knowing Dean had to be somewhere nearby, startling a bit when the front door swung open to reveal the man himself.
After they iced the cake and decorated it, Claire covered it in sprinkles and wrote ‘Happy Birthday Old Man’ across the top. The final touch was the candles, only using nine, three of each color, and then Claire carried it into the library, setting it right in front of the seat at the head of the table.
“Love you too!” Dean grabbed his already packed bag from his room and threw it in the backseat of the Impala as he waited for Sam. It was only moments later when Sam joined him, dropping his bag through the open window.
“I said we’re taking her to the shelter,” with that, Dean left the kitchen, Cas shooting Jack a sympathetic look as he followed Dean, hopefully to try and convince him otherwise.
“So how do we fix it?” Dean asked, though Sam could hear pages flipping in the background.
“You’re more useful than that, disposing bodies,” Dean scoffed. “Speaking of, I’ve got your angel blade or whatever you call it in my bag.”
“Maybe, but it’s as close as we can get for now, and that’s what matters,” Claire said and wrapped her arms around Cas’ chest. “Thank you, for...what you said.”
The man let out a laugh, “Oh and what, I’ll die?”
Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, hesitating for a moment, “Well… actually, yeah. I was thinking that maybe Rowena could help him.”
“And Michael is working with Naomi, so excuse me if I’m worried about what could happen to him.” Cas said icily, narrowing his eyes.
“What do we need to do?” he asked.
“I transported his body down the infirmary,” Jack said. “I wasn’t sure what else to do with it.”
“You did?” Dean seemed genuinely surprised that Claire and Jack had gone through the effort to celebrate his birthday which made Claire want to punch John Winchester in the face more than ever.
Noticing the panic in her eyes, Dean set out to distract the demon, “Hey asshole! You already got my brother, don’t you want the matching set?”
“Dad,” Dean said incredulously, “Sam and I need to be in Sioux Falls by tonight. No way we can swing that.”
“John?” Jack stepped into the backyard, the man in question sitting in a deck chair, drinking a beer.
“I think it’s best that Dean finds out what happened from someone that’s not Claire, so that he has time to process everything,” Jack said decisively. “You go, Claire is going to need you.” Kaia nodded gratefully and hurried to her and Claire’s room to get some clothes, picking a pair of sweats and one of Dean’s old band shirts. She brought them back to the bathroom, and fortunately Claire had gotten undressed and was scrubbing her body under the water, perhaps a bit too viciously, but Kaia understood the feeling.
It progressed like that, when they had free time, Dean and Kaia listened to the music of Dean’s choosing
“Why do you think he’s crying?”
“Now what is that supposed to-” John stood from his chair angrily but Jack interrupted him before he could continue his tirade.
Sam shook his head, “Not really. He just said that it wasn’t the will of Heaven for me to be in Hell, and that I was needed on Earth.”
Mary looked around at the rubble surrounding them and laughed, “A horse should be pretty easy to spot around here.”
Sam shook his head, “I don’t want it. I want you to have it.”
“Oh hey Cas,” Sam said with a smile, “You’re early today.”
Jo and Mary stared at him as he stood there silently, startled when they heard a fluttering sound behind them. “You prayed to me?” said a gruff voice, causing them all to turn, “Why? I was just down the hall.”
“I don’t really know how but...it was Claire,” Jack’s voice was barely a whisper. Cas took a deep breath and closed his eyes to think. “She didn’t mean to! I don’t know what happened but I know it was an accident. She’s...she’s really scared. She’s not talking.”
“Your birthday party!” Jack said with a grin. “We made you a cake!”
And so they sat there for a few hours, compiling all of the necessary information to send off various college applications. If Sam forged some recommendation letters, nobody but the two of them had to know.
“I’m sorry. I am aware that you knew nothing of your husband’s actions after your first death and this was not the best way to find out,” Jack apologized, sure that there was a better way for Mary to have been informed.
“I wish I could make it up to her,” Cas said, finally succumbing to the weight of the day and letting himself cry, “You know what she did when I went outside earlier?”
John spat at him, but remained silent. Cas leaned closer, spoke a little quieter, “I know what you did to them. I know you abandoned them in motels when Dean was no more than 6, expected him to be a fucking parent because you couldn’t figure it out. I know you neglected them, I know Dean fed them out of vending machines with change he found on the fucking sidewalk, I know he went days on end without food, just so Sam could have something to eat. He was a
“Thanks man,” Dean said with a smile, reaching over to squeeze Cas’ knee.
Claire continued until she was in the library, and only Castiel was sitting at one of the tables, book open in front of him. “Where is everyone?” she asked, smiling a little when Cas jumped.
The remodel went about as well as expected, for two teenage girls, a former angel, a nephilim who didn’t even know how to hammer a nail, and Dean, whose only building experience was from fixing his car. They tried, they watched as many YouTube videos as they could get their hands on, they spent more time at the hardware store than anywhere else in town, but even Jack’s moderate mastery of magic couldn’t help them when it came to certain aspects of construction.
Sam turned quickly, wishing he could erase the last few seconds from his memory.
“You know there might be someone who could give us answers,” Mary suggested, nudging Dean lightly.
“400, it’ll be the fastest,” Claire took a deep, shaky breath. “Alright, I’m gonna start driving. I’ll keep you updated on where I am.”
“Jack, it’s nothing to do with that,” Cas stopped him in his tracks. “It...I cannot say too much as it is Dean’s story to tell, but just know that Dean and his father have an extremely...complex relationship and it was never resolved. He is just trying to figure out how to approach him.”
“Not currently,” Castiel said. “It has been some time since I was on Earth, things have changed, quite drastically in some cases. Though something that never wanes is the human spirit.”
“Yeah, me too,” Claire took a deep breath and stepped forward, giving Jack a brief hug that he returned. She didn’t know if it was because he was God or if he was just really good at hugs, but it left Claire feeling warm and safe. “Don’t be a stranger.” Jack nodded and stepped back, giving them a small wave before leaving the bunker.
“Cas, think you can figure out the name of a resident?” Sam asked.
“Add her to the list. If that’s all you’ve got, I’m just gonna,” Dean began making his way around the building but before he could get anywhere, one of the demons had him shoved against the wall, ears ringing from the impact.
“Don’t you think this is a little weird?” asked Sam, “Why would there be a hotel this nice in the middle of nowhere? How the hell do they stay in business?”
“Yes! Han Solo is my favorite character,” Jack nodded. Claire snorted into her coffee.
They were speeding out of Sioux Falls less than half an hour later.
Cas grumbled, but accepted the spoon of soup being presented to him instead of commenting further.
“I should be asking you the same thing,” he said gruffly, descending the stairs as if he owned the place. Claire kept the gun aimed at his chest, but he didn’t seem disturbed by it at all. “You’re far too young for either of my boys.”
Sam pulled the car back onto the highway, letting Dean explain the entire situation to Cas. He pointedly ignored them and turned up the radio when he couldn’t make out the sound of their voices anymore. About an hour into the drive back to Sioux Falls, Cas told the brothers that he was needed back in Heaven, and disappeared in a flutter of wings.
“You kissed him before? How long have you been kissing him?” Sam’s voice was strained and stressed.
At least Sam and Dean hoped they were actual demons.
“I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation,” Castiel said. “And while the body that I am occupying is male, as an angel, I have no gender.” Dean blushed lightly at the implication of Castiel’s words before something clicked.
It was Dean’s turn to look shocked as he turned to Cas, “You… are you sure?” he asked, knowing how much his boyfriend hated his father.
She and Jack were gonna bake Dean a birthday cake. She already found a recipe online, a chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream, simple, but that meant it would be easy.
Cas stiffened and walked towards them, grabbing Jack by the arms and looking into his eyes, “Can you hear them?” he asked, “Any of the angels? Can you hear what they’re saying?”
Cas’ heart clenched, and any drunkenness left in him was gone as he paled, “No, of course not,” he stood up, walking over to Dean, “I just thought that maybe you wouldn’t want to see me, after…” he trailed off.
“Yes, I was aware that she was the perpetrator,” Cas confirmed with a nod.
“She is at peace. Her soul is in Heaven now,” Jack said decisively and trained his eyes back on Cas. “Why am I unsafe?”
“Have you talked to Jo, then?” Sam asked, setting his fork on his plate.
“It was very enjoyable,” Jack agreed, smile stretched wide across his face. “I wouldn’t be opposed to doing something like that again.”
Claire’s eyes widened and then she smirked, “Your dads have kept you on a pretty tight leash lately, huh?”
“I just want-”
Sam raised his eyebrows, but nodded anyway, and the two of them entered the building, an old community center, silently. They had their shotguns poised and ready, Sam had Ruby’s knife tucked in his waistband and Dean had Cas’ angel blade. “It seem quiet to you?” Sam asked as they rounded a corner.
“I’m glad you’re finally here. I’ve missed you,” he said softly, really taking in how beautiful the setting sun was on the lake.
“N-no I suppose you would not,” Cas said weakly, unable to stop himself from leaning into the touch.
“Thank you. So, we’ve read in your statement that you don’t remember anything at all. What is the last thing you do remember?” Mary asked, setting down a tape recorder on the table in between them.
Cas was in the process of rendering medical aid to the humans he had freed when he heard the unmistakable sound of John yelling from somewhere across the building.
“Security room?” Sam suggested. “We’ll be able to check all of them out.”
Claire met Jack’s gaze and smiled, wrapping her arms around Dean and hugging back just as tight.
“Only what you have told me thus far.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile at his angel as he sat down on the bed, “We gotta talk…”
“You can’t avoid them forever,” Sam tried to reason but was cut off before he could finish his sentence.
Several of the deities nodded at that and began murmuring among themselves. “What do we do?” Dean hissed to Sam.
“I really thought it would be easier than this,” Dean replied, exhausted, “We did so much research.”
“Cas, do I really have to stay here for four weeks?” Claire asked, turning to face him as he poured himself a cup of coffee.
“What? I hate when I lose my page,” Kaia said, setting the book down on the nightstand next to her. “I’m good now.” Claire rolled her eyes fondly and pulled Kaia down into another kiss, humming softly against her lips.
“What the fuck are you talking ab-” before Dean could finish his sentence, Sam was able to break free from Alastair’s and tackled the demon to the ground, Ruby’s knife in his hand. In moments, he had Alastair pinned to the ground with the knife to his neck. “Sam wait!” Dean pushed himself up onto his feet. “We need to know why he’s doing this!”
“You okay there, kiddo?” Donna asked, voice filled with concern.
“I’m in!” replied Jo, eyes darting to her mother.
“Neither could I, babe. I’m 29, and I’ve somehow got three teenage kids now,” Dean said with a laugh. “Didn’t know if I would ever even have any and now I’ve got a fucking pack. We have a pack.”
Despite Michael’s defeat, the hunters weren’t confident that that meant the angel complications were entirely over. Mary, Bobby, Karen, Donna and Jody planned to go back to Sioux Falls in the next few days, but vowed to stay prepared to come back and help at the first hint of angelic interference.
Cas patted Dean’s thigh sympathetically, but smirked at the kids’ thought process. Dean let out an exaggerated sigh, “Fine, we’ll do it your way.”
, John.”
“Just let me do all the talking and then show your badge when I do,” Dean muttered to Cas as they walked into the hospital. Cas nodded, still unsure of why they needed to lie. Once they got into the morgue, Cas began examining the bodies without even stopping to put on gloves.
“You’re really going to shoot your own father, Sam? After everything I’ve done for you? I gave up my life to raise you two. I fed you, put a roof over your heads. Doesn’t family mean anything to you, boy?” Not-John scoffed. “Fine. If you’re so sure, shoot me.”
“You doing alright back there, kiddo?” Dean asked a few minutes after they were back on the highway.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean shouts, jumping up from the bench.
“You’re sure?” He whispers back?
“No, I’m good for now, but Garth was asking after you last time. You should stop by later.” She bats her eyes at him, and he groans.
Chuckling to himself, he takes a drink of the beer he brought out.
Sam smiles back down at her and offers his arm.
Tears threaten to fall from Dean’s eyes and drip on the paper, he wipes them away with the heel of his hand. That poor girl, and her family. Dean couldn’t fathom that kind of loss, the pain that they must feel.
Castiel curses to himself; his uncles really outdid themselves. Of all the people they could find for Castiel to live with, they go out and find a walking Ken doll! Cas knows he’s staring but he can’t seem to look away. He realizes faintly Mick is speaking when a hand is clapped on his shoulder.
Dean shakes his head at them, “I warned you they were going to be bad. Okay, here’s another one. What do tofu and a dildo have in common?”
Castiel huffs and fists his hands on his hips, “because I don’t know what to do! The last person I went out with was Kelly and she asked me! I don’t even know what I’m doing!”
>>>>>>>>>
“Am I interrupting?” he asks smoothly, looking between the two of them.
Castiel pushes of the mattress and simultaneously scoops Dean’s very pliant body up to his knees. With Dean’s back flush against his chest once more Castiel resumes massaging down the length of Dean’s arms. Marveled by how soft and strong Dean’s body could feel all at once. His body was amazing, hard muscle, freckles peppered all over his skin. Castiel would be remiss if he didn’t plan a future date to discover each and every one of them.
Castiel frowns, “No, I'll be back in ten minutes. Don’t go anywhere.”
“Hello Novak, enjoying the game?” Zachariah asks nonchalantly.
He fires up the engine, the rumble calms him like it always did. Even when Dean had nothing, he had this car. And he had his family. That had to be enough.
“I should get back to the hospital, Sam’s got to be going out of his mind.” But Dean just leans further into Castiel’s touch.
“Adam, I won't say anything. Cas is right, it's your job to get better. It’s my job to figure out what’s going on. I’m just going to talk to Uncle Bobby about it.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say, for the first time since they met he’s feel like Castiel is being brutally honest with him about something. Maybe it was time for him to be honest in return.
“You good?”
“That would explain my surly disposition.”
There’s a tightness in his chest that already threatens to steal his voice, he takes a deep breath and turns around to Sam. Adam passed the ring up to him and Dean takes the dark wedding band from his large hand, he holds the ring up for Cas to see. Preparing to slip it on his finger.
Castiel’s head shouts with joy, let’s do it! Let’s go right now!
Dean backs up a little and starts to unbuckle his belt, Cas’s eyes follow the movement like a moth to a flame.
“Um, can I help you?” Dean asks much more rudely than he intended.
Gabe smiles at him fondly and Castiel turns to look at each of their faces, settling finally on Dean. He breaks into a wide smile as well.
His erection doesn’t quit but his cadence falters despite her flushed and writhing on top of him. Her hands come up and she grips the headboard above his head. The wood creaks under the strain of her fingers.
Sick? Why would he call for that? Dean doesn’t understand. But something in the back of his mind starts buzzing. And Cas’s voice gets farther and farther away.
“We’re good, water under the bridge.”
His boyfriend’s face looks so open and vulnerable, as Castiel had only ever seen when he’d given himself over to submission. Silently pleading with Castiel to do something in this situation, but really what more can he do? He had no idea why Claire and Emma fought, whatever the reasons neither girl was willing to divulge the information. Even though something about the whole situation seemed off, he hated to admit it, the likelihood Claire started the fight was high. She'd been picking fights and causing trouble ever since coming to Lawrence. He knew she was still hurting, over the loss of her mother, the abandonment of her father; but he had no idea how to help her heal.
Far behind, Candlebox
“I said we were in love,” Dean replies with a shrug of his shoulders, “you gonna go and make me a liar Cas?”
“Well I still own it today, you need to get out of my house.” Deans voice doesn’t waiver but inside he’s shaking with fury.
He resigns Dean is probably correct there too. It was hard to remember as climate never affected his vessel before he fell. But Castiel had acutely become aware how warm the library was now that Dean mentioned it. Not that he should be surprised, the average temperature for Cleveland in July was eighty-three degrees and they had been out in the sun for most of the day. Shrugging off the jacket, the public library’s overworked A/C unit is like a breath of fresh air to the back of his neck and shoulders.
Dean however looks calm and collected. He navigates the rest of the trip one hand resting on Cas’s knee. Slowly tracing circles with his fingers over the denim. Every so often moving his hand a little higher. By the time they were within the city limits Cas was so turned on he thought he might explode.
His paralegal passed him some intel and he had a suspicion she bribed one of sellers. He just didn’t know if he could prove it.
“Would you care to dance Castiel?” He smiles, pulling Cas closer, leading him onto the dance floor.
He leaves Cas standing in his wake, with blood in his eyes and an ache in his heart he races out the door to the street. It’s a perfect spring day and Dean wants to jump off the nearest building.
“Hi.” Dean waves.
He can't do it; Cas is looking right into his soul and he can't just hurt him like this. It wasn’t right. He curses Becky’s existence for the thousandth time. He rubs his hands over his face, this just wasn’t fair.
The stress of the day, coupled with seeing Alastair for the first time in almost a year ignited a rage he didn’t know still burned within him.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Dean’s heart pounding from the mind blowing orgasm he just had. He braces himself against the wall as he listens to Cas’s side of the conversation.
Dean was able to avoid seeing Becky all the way up till Friday. Shamelessly telling her via text that it would be even more special if they waited to see each other till then. She sent a bunch of heart emojis in return and he had to sit down on the floor of his bedroom before his legs gave out.
“I talked to Eileen, she said you blew it out of proportion.”
“All done, Sorry!” Dean hollers and waves a hand as he jogs off the field. He absolutely took advantage of Sam’s time today. He’d probably get an earful about that later.
“It can still be the same amount of time; I just meant see you differently.” She’s being uncharacteristically coy and while its might be the loss of blood to his brain, he cannot think for the life of him what she’s talking about.
He thinks of a long hallway with doors, a basement with chains on the floor, a wall with a symbol painted in blood.
They had not... not a single one.
You’ve got a beautiful taste
“Something you want to share brother?”
Dean looks between the Novak's in surprise, “You had a plan already?”
Dean blushes from his ears down to his toes, “Cas tell me you did not say that?”
Dean waggles his eyebrows, “You know what that means right?”
He chuckles into the kiss, they were going to need to explore that further, but right now Castiel’s own cock is achingly hard between his legs. He moves his hand lower down the soft abdominal muscles of Dean’s belly, the other hand coming around Dean’s chest holding him tight against him. Continuing to lick into mouth, his hand finally reaches its intended destination and brushes over the flushed head of Dean’s dick. The tip already leaking, Cas smears it with his palm, rubbing it over the delicate skin there. Dean’s hips lunge forward against Castiel’s hand, searching out a deeper touch. He curls a loose fist around Dean and strokes him from root to tip, reveling in the hardness under his hands. It was breathtaking.
“I will absolutely do it,” he smirks wickedly, “when does Sam plan on coming to town?”
“We’re not making any deals.”
Thank you for reading, see you next week!
Pulling his focus away from Dean, Castiel turns to his brother, “I’m sorry what?”
“It’s in the kitchen,” Jack jumps out of his chair and bolts to get his stool from under the sink. Dean stands to follow.
Dean stands on the field with his hand over his heart, black ball cap in hand. Looking over the crowd before him, his chest swells with pride. As the young girl on the pitcher’s mound lets out that last note, high and clear as a bell on a Sunday morning, the crowd cheers and applauds. On his left, standing at what can only be called parade rest, Benny looks serious. And it could be the sun, but Dean thinks he sees a sheen in his friend’s eyes. On his right, Charlie grins at him. Her fiery red hair spilling out from the matching cap she tugs back down on her head.
She sits and folds her hands on the linoleum table. They stare at each other, two gunslingers just waiting on the clock to strike noon so they can take the first shot.
Not bothering to wait for Dean’s come down, Castiel pulls out the toy and powers it off, leaving Dean gaping open and waiting to be filled once more. His own dick, already aching, hardens further at the sight and he wastes no time slicking himself up and sliding between Dean’s cheeks.
No real new information to be found, Dean shoves his phone in his coat pocket and picks up his food. Chewing slowly, he closes his eyes and tips his head back in the bright June sunshine. Summer was just around the corner; he could feel the heat already starting to seep into his bones through the leather. That was until a shadow passes over his eyelids, blotting out the sun.
White flashes before his eyes and Castiel comes into his hand, gasping Dean’s name on his lips.
“Hi, wow you look amazing.” As he looks her up and down, she says a silent thank you to the Goddess at Saks. The scarlet dress with its thin straps and slit halfway up her thigh set her back a pretty penny. But it was totally worth the look on Sam’s face right now.
Snorting, Dean steps further into the room and pulls up the same chair from yesterday, “No that’s just you. I've been offering to remove that stick from your ass going on 15 years now.”
Cas pulls his mouth off his cock and moves back to remove the rest of their clothes, tossing everything in the floor in a heap. Dean hears the thump of shoes, and phones, and belt buckles on the carpet. A smirk tugs at his lips.
Original note:
“Charlie’s hiding something.” Dean tattles like a 7 year old. He doesn’t care how it sounds, she is hiding something from him. He can feel it.
“Room 216, that’s ours.” Castiel said as they reached a door almost at the end of the balcony hall. Unfortunately the cleaning lady, who was busy with the room next door, had left her trolley in front of their room so they couldn’t get in. But luckily it was just a matter of minutes till she came out of the room and moved to the next one, taking her trolley with her.
He gently tugged and lightly squeezed his balls while licking Dean’s cock from base to tip, before he wrapped one hand around the shaft and with a flick of his tongue cleared away the pre-cum that had started to dribble out. And each time more and more pre-cum was seeping out, Castiel flicked it away with his tongue, making Dean moan every single time.
Dean leaned on Castiel for a moment, not doing anything else, just enjoying the afterglow before letting go of Castiel’s –still hard- cock and easing out of him. Dean quickly wiped away all evidence of his release, both on Castiel and himself, before he zipped up his pants and began walking towards the driver’s side of the car.
“Yeah, sure thing. Just don’t forget to give me the exact address and maybe I’ll come around.” Dean said, halfheartedly, thinking that although Donnie was a great fuck, he’s definitely not going to see this guy again. Maybe if he didn’t live that far away they could have a regular thing whenever Dean got bored, but being as it is, he much more preferred a one-off, giving this bartender a lasting best-fuck-of-my-life-memory.
“Trust me, baby. You’ll like this.” Dean said as he let his backpack fall to the floor, skirt and panties on top, and gently shoved Castiel towards the bed until they both lay on it, Dean on top of Castiel, whose feet were still placed firmly on the ground.
Admittedly, he loved a good quick fuck just like the next guy and there sure was nothing wrong with that. It’s nice and serves its purpose, but this was different. He didn’t just want to fuck Castiel so he could get off, like he did in the shower. He wanted to show Castiel how much he loved and appreciated him; he wanted to –as cliché as it might sounded- make love to him. He wanted to feel the wonderful heat of Castiel’s body around his dick and at the same time be able to look into his lover’s eyes.
When Castiel started to get up and move closer to Dean, so he could touch and kiss him, Dean pushed him back down on the bed again. “No, no, no, Cas.” Dean scolded and wiggled a finger at him. “You have to have patience. Lie down and just enjoy. Or do I have to tie you to the bedposts first so you can’t move? I’d rather not, not yet anyway, but if you can’t behave I’d probably have to.”
After a few hazy moments of afterglow, Dean grabbed a small towel to wipe them both clean. But when Castiel attempted to stand up, Dean pressed his hands on Castiel’s thighs, keeping him in place. “Please, Castiel, stay. Just for another minute. It feels so nice feeling you so close to me.”
“Oh nothing, sweetie! Just a little something for later when we are traveling.” Dean grinned and got in the car.
“Yeah, I realized that.” Castiel said, before Dean let go of his hips.
“Yes, Dean? Something you want there?” Castiel asked, still putting kisses on Dean’s neck and behind his ear while increasing the intensity of his strokes over Dean’s dick.
“Did I like it? Cas, I’m probably never going to be able to wake up without having THAT specific memory in my head and afterwards having to call you even more frequently just to get rid of my boner and out of sheer frustration that you are not with me. Damn! I… Not that I don’t think of you every time I masturbate anyway, but within these one and half days you’ve already given me more than enough dirty memories and incentives for my thoughts that I could probably survive on a lonely island for at least a couple of years!”
There were plenty of rooms where huge groups of people had more than enough space to put their sleeping bags and find some rest during the nights and days. And for those who wanted to take a breather while bands they didn’t like played, there was a wide range of activities offered inside and outside the castle, all around the festival area.
“Yes, baby. I wanna see you come,” Castiel spurred him on.
Castiel quickly opened his eyes again, and when he looked into the mirror he was immediately greeted by the sight of Dean’s face, his emerald green eyes, filled with desire and clouded over with a fervent lust.
The combination of sensations Castiel felt now, the balls stuffed inside his ass and Dean pleasuring his cock, and the memory of yesterday’s fuck was just too much to bear for him; only moments later, he was spurting his release into Dean’s hungry mouth, feeling the fullness with every orgasm induced convulsion.
“Oh you are all so unthankful and no fun at all!” Gabriel said sulky. “You know, Dean, knowing you are afraid of plane rides, and me being the most awesome big brother one can have, I wanted to offer you and Castiel a free ride with the angel-express and simply zap you to Europe, but now seeing how ungrateful you are, I will not.” And with these words he simply disappeared again.
Dean squeezed more lube into his palm and stroked himself a few times before he aligned his cock with Castiel’s ass, “Cas, you ready?” Dean asked, but instead of an answer Castiel just looked over his shoulder, and pushed back, impaling himself perfectly on Dean’s cock. Dean let out a groan, overwhelmed by the wonderful feeling of being buried deep down in Castiel’s tight little ass.
“That’s right, just let go.”
Dean put on the condom, pressed the head of his cock against Donnie’s opening, and after Donnie braced himself against the wall, Dean pushed himself all in.
Dean opened his mouth to say something when Castiel put his fingers on Dean’s lips. “Shh… You don’t have to say anything. If it was just a slip, just forget it. Same if you think it was a mistake, just pretend it never happened. Then I will simply enjoy the memory of you saying it and keep this memory like a treasure no one can take away from me. And in case you really did mean it, well… then you’ll have plenty of time to repeat it.” Castiel said with a smile before he put a kiss on Dean’s lips.
Dean smiled and grabbed the lube and a pack of tissues, before he also got out of the car and positioned himself behind Castiel. “Oh you look so pretty like this, baby.” Dean said as he let his hands wander over the skirt, then under it, before finally gliding over the silky material of the panties, enjoying the feeling for a few seconds before slipping them down to Castiel’s knees.
He dreamt of light kisses being put along the shaft of his penis and of licks that felt ice cold but at the same time were oh so arousing. Dean’s mind slowly began to shut out his dream as the arousing cold licks began to become much more intense and real than they should be.
“Oh, uhm,” Cas began to answer while quickly joining Dean in the bathroom, “well, I ‘borrowed’ it from Anna and as she has no idea that I have it, I intend to return it without a single stain on it.”
Dean shot Castiel a quick meaningful glance, and Castiel immediately removed his fingers, which got him a complaining whine from Donnie; he handed Dean another condom, turned Donnie around, gave him a quick kiss, and then walked over to the next shower.
“That. Was. Amazing. Thank you!” Castiel said, kissing Dean.
“Oh come on! You are overstating his condition, Dean-o! He didn’t need me. He had some minor illnesses and was nowhere near dying! Just some viruses having a little fiesta in his body, there’s nothing wrong with that. And if he were actually dying, I would have come! Come on, Dean-o! Don’t be such a drama queen! Cas was doing absolutely fine! So give me a break, or you…” and with a snap of his fingers Dean and Cas suddenly both had flower garlands around their necks and each of them held a cocktail in their hand, “and just relax and go on vacation while me and Sasquatch are going to-“
you are ready. Care to join me?”
“Shh… trust me, I won’t hurt you. I’m just making this a bit more thrilling.”
Dean smiled and slowly turned around as the other man dropped both his hands and crossed them behind his back, mirroring Dean’s previous pose. Dean had a million stupid comeback sentences on his lips, but instead of uttering either of them, he just leaned forward and gave Castiel a deep-felt kiss, feeling happy that he had found someone so wonderful in his life.
A smile crept up on Dean’s face. “That’s a great idea. I’ll be back in a sec! Don’t you dare start without me!” Dean said as he jumped up from the bed and ran out of the door.
“Instead you took advantage of my arousal and started blowing me while I was still driving. That was very naughty. And you deserve punishment.” Dean gasped in-between words, while small grunts tore away from his chest from time to time.
When Castiel reentered the bedroom Dean was already back on the bed. Castiel positioned himself between Dean’s thighs again, and now slowly moved up Dean’s body, licking and kissing every inch of it. And the further he came up, the more Dean touched and caressed every part of Castiel’s body he could reach.
Unfortunately this probably would have led to a rather quick ending, more precisely he probably would have been done by now, not that he is going to last long now, but at least he wouldn’t be finished within mere seconds.
And so, while clinging to Dean and constantly having the balls vibrate against his prostate, at some point Castiel just couldn’t take it any longer. He closed his eyes and ultimately gave in to all the sensations he felt, simply enjoying the wonderful experience of having an orgasm on a rushing motorcycle while his dick remained completely untouched.
“Son of a bi-,” Dean’s cursing was interrupted by Castiel’s soft and warm lips being pressed on his mouth. And when he drew away a little bit with a confused look on his face, he was met with the most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen in Castiel’s eyes.
He glanced at the camera on the table and for a moment he wished he could have filmed last night, not necessarily the fucking, even though that probably would have been nice too, but more so Castiel sleeping beside him. Of course he and Castiel had sometimes done Skype-sessions where they ‘kinda’ fell asleep together, but it wasn’t the same, the time-difference always made it awkward, not to mention that usually at some point one of their communication devices either tilted over, or fell of the bed or something else happened that terminated their communication way too early.
Castiel hollowed his cheeks and began moving his head up and down Dean’s erect penis, his lips carefully wrapped over his teeth, his tongue lizardlike swirling along Dean’s shaft, turning Dean’s moans more and more into an endless sequence of encouragements.
The next morning Dean and Castiel woke up very early, or rather, Castiel woke up very early. Due to jetlag and his excitement to be reunited with Dean again, Castiel was wide-awake and enjoyed the feeling of currently being hugged by his beloved in his sleep. He felt like the happiest person in the world and wished that moment would never end. And when Dean involuntarily rolled on his back and therefore gave Castiel’s body free, Castiel leaned on his elbow to watch Dean sleep.
“Oh baby… Cas, I just fucking love seeing you like this! And I just can’t get enough of it. Not ever. Fuck! You are just so beautiful, my angel. I need you… I…” Dean groaned as he felt he was getting close.
Instead of staying in bed and letting Dean take care of him, he used any given opportunity to make himself “useful” and thereby prolonged his healing, trying to make up for the already “lost” time due to his stomach bug. It didn’t matter whether Sam needed help with some Enochian translation or someone had to do the grocery shopping (which Castiel did by using an old bike he also happened to repair while being sick… outside… in the cold), Castiel just couldn’t stay in bed long enough to actually give his body some sorely needed rest in order to get well again.
Dean just smirked, moved Castiel under the water spray to rinse the shower gel from his body, before he pressed Castiel against his own one in a manner that enabled both of them to look at Donnie now. And after having poured some more shower gel onto his hand, he began stroking Castiel’s dick anew while continuing to whisper into his ear. “I’m going to tell you all about my little adventure later, but for now I want to tell you what I’m going to do with the two of you in the next couple of minutes.”
Castiel unbuckled his seat belt, leaned over to Dean, dropped his right hand to Dean’s right thigh, and whispered into his ear, “Thank you for the skirt. That was really very considerate of you. But tell me,” Castiel began to fondle Dean’s thigh over the jeans, “what on earth ever made you think I was little,” a slight brush over Dean’s locked-in cock, “or cute,” a brief nibble on Dean’s earlobe, “or in any given sort of way easy to intimidate?” Castiel said, while beginning to kiss and suck on Dean’s neck while simultaneously stroking Dean’s dick through the jeans fabric.
Castiel knew of course that Europe was just as spooked and dangerous as any other part of the world, but for now his mind has blissfully decided to ignore this knowledge and allowed him to dream of a whole continent with several countries on it without any known supernatural creature in existence residing there. In his feverish dream he was happy… happy with the man he saved from perdition and with whose soul he had instantly fallen in love with… with the man he had spend so much time together and whom he knew inside out, literally, as he had put him together after hell – piece by piece… with, and for whom, he had fought so many fights, not only on earth but also in purgatory… the man who introduced him to the carnal pleasures not only women were able to provide to him… yes, he was happy and completely carefree, at least in his dreams.
“Of course I like it. I love it! There’s nothing I’d rather have in my mouth than your wonderful big cock.” Castiel said, before he resumed to lick and suck on Dean’s balls again. “But there’s something else that I like to taste,” Castiel said with a telling grin, and Dean immediately grabbed one of the pillows, and slid it under his pelvis, raising his lower body up a bit.
“Her breasts are very beautiful, voluptuous, but still a perfect fit for my hands, and… aaaah…” Castiel gasped as Dean’s tongue was sliding down his neck and over his weak spot and his teeth were gnawing all over his upper body through the fabric of his shirt.
As Castiel was already worked open nicely by the balls, Dean didn’t give Castiel much time to adjust but instead immediately began thrusting in an out of Castiel in a rapid manner, the edges around the cut in the panties stroking along his length each time he moved.
But not wanting to be cruel either, Castiel kept the camera rolling for just a few more minutes, enjoying the sight that was now not only burned as memory into his brain, but more so captured on tape for hopefully a very long time, before he finally complied.
Dean gave Castiel a small peck on the lips, took the camera out of Castiel’s hand, and dragged him back into their hotel room. He placed the camera on the nightstand, choosing an angle that would capture everything happening on the bed perfectly.
Dean gazed at Castiel lovingly, and as his right arm was still trapped underneath Castiel’s body, he lifted his left hand to slowly stroke over Castiel’s hair, which was warm and soft under his fingers. He stroked over the soft skin at the back of Castiel’s neck, and behind his ear, smiling when a little moan left Castiel’s lips. He gently stroked over Castiel’s lips, trying to make his fingers memorize the soft pattern of it.
Dean even forced him out of their shared room, and therefore also bed, into his own former bedroom, just to give him some more privacy to rest completely undisturbed, but nothing helped. This is also why Dean when he walked into Castiel’s bedroom again with a tray full with fresh-brewed tea, a whole plate of chocolate-chip pancakes and a whole collection of meds on it, took special care to include some sleeping pills to Castiel’s usual pile of pills he took at the moment. Because Cas was not only unwilling to stay in bed, no, he had also –despite being in separate rooms now- taken over Dean’s unfortunate sleeping pattern and was therefore constantly tired because of a lack of sleep, which of course was just another thing that supported his not getting any better.
Dean was still asleep, dreaming about a certain pair of beautiful blue eyes and the skimpy outfit Castiel wore the previous day, when he suddenly felt some movement beside him and light touches on his body. Half asleep he realized that somebody was removing his shorts and kissing the skin around his navel. But it didn’t him wake up; instead his mind began to combine his dream with it.
Castiel opened his eyes again and looked at his boyfriend with a bright smile. He was just so unbelievably happy to have Dean with him right now and was more than eager and overjoyed that their limited time together had only just started.
“That’s the second part of my surprise,” Dean said before giving Castiel a small peck on the lips, leaving Castiel flabbergasted and completely stunned for a moment. Meanwhile, Dean took the keys and two helmets from the owner. When Castiel came around again, he saw that Dean was already sitting on the bike, wearing one of the helmets while holding the other one out to him, only waiting for Castiel to join him on the motorcycle.
Dean’s up and out of the cab before it even comes to a stop. He pushes past a couple exiting the building with a rude shove and marches right up to the reception desk. He was really racking them up this year, maybe they had a freaking punch card for him.
“Hi Jack,” he whispers, “do you want to help me make breakfast?”
Wishes he had been there when Bobby took his final breaths, no doubt cursing them all for making a fuss.
“Now, you’re my last appointment of the day. What do you say we get a drink? To celebrate our partnership. My treat!” He stands and they all scramble up to join him.
The warmth of Castiel’s body seeping through the shared contact of their thighs, his soft palms caressing Dean’s rougher hands, the faint whiff of coffee on his breath just before Castiel’s mouth closes over his own. His pillow soft lips pressed firmly against Dean’s. The teasing lick at the seam as Castiel works Dean’s mouth open with his tongue. The strong grip of a hand on the back of his neck.
Instantly he starts to move; his hands wrap around Dean’s chest holding him tightly. Setting a breakneck pace, he grants them no quarter, no reprieve from each punishing roll of his hips. Dean gasps and writhes around him, giving back as much as he gets. With every thrust he pushes back against Castiel, drawing moan after moan from the Dom in the process.
He closes his eyes, praise washing over him. It was a small thing but he held onto every word for dear life.
“At least he tried to hide it!” Clair interjects, pointing a finger at her uncle, “this one practically told me when and where it was going down!”
“He has two brothers.”
Cas grips for his hand like a lifeline, “It’s stupid, I just thought maybe if I saw the apartment some things might come back, and I wouldn’t...”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about my family.” He whispers. “You were right, I have so much love in my life. I was worried how it would make you feel.”
That sound again; a foot caught in a snare, a noose pulling tightly. Just barely audible over the rush of the shower. He climbs out of bed, light peaking from under the bathroom door. He leans closer; if it stops, he’ll turn around. If it stops, he’ll go back to sleep.
“A party? I didn’t think his friends we’re into this kind of thing.”
Cas looks down at the floor and then back up at Dean, he does meet his eyes this time and they’re filled with shame and regret.
“We don’t have to talk about it anymore, I got the gist from your call.” she picks up his glass and presses it into his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cas paid for Adam’s rehab.”
“You’re drunk and your eyes are closed, how do you know I've been sighing?” Castiel retorts.
He frowns at her attempts at flirting. That had been happening more often; instead of insulting him she complimented his appearance, his performance, she even laughed at a joke he made by mistake. Something was up with her, and the smile on her face sent little ripples of fear under his skin. He never should have let her lock him up like this. But she had been edging him for close to an hour and he was too aroused to fight her any longer.
“Are you sure he’s not the main course?” Inias jeers.
Turning away with another eye roll, Claire whispers something to Emma and they both miss the way Dean’s eyebrow waggle as he mouths an exaggerated ‘Yes Sir’ in Castiel’s direction. Steeling a breath, mentally he’s already packing a duffle bag with a number of toys for him and his good boy to play with, Castiel lines up his green ball and swings his club. The ball rolls past each obstacle and he sinks the shot in one. Turning back to the trio that had cemented their place firmly in his heart, Castiel smiles wide as Dean winks suggestively over the top of Emma’s head. All and all it had been a great evening with their girls; Castiel knew even if all nights weren't like this, he could hold on to the memory of it and feel happy.
He dreamt of those blue eyes kissing his lower body, circling the navel, and pushing his shirt upwards. He dreamt of gentle hands that caressed his skin and played with his nipples. He dreamt of soft touches, kisses, and gentle bites along his inner thighs.
“Ok, enough is enough! I’m not going to have any more of this! Cas, you are human now and you are sick! And I’m not going to let you spread your germs all over the place - especially not in the kitchen! We all have to be fit for our trip to Europe, so leave your notebook on the kitchen table and go back to your bed!”
“I’ve slept beside you that’s always my favorite place to sleep, and I never sleep as well as when I’m cuddled up to you, Dean.” Castiel said, and wrapped his arm with ostentation around Dean’s chest, his head resting in the hollow of Dean’s throat.
Dean’s eyes were wide open with surprise for a second before he raised an eyebrow, licked his slightly parted lips, and by exhaling hot breath against Castiel’s lips, he asked, “Oh yeah? You sure about that?” keeping their eyes still interlocked.
come instead.” The words breathed into Dean’s ear.
Abruptly Dean and Cas ended their kiss and now both looked very angry at Gabriel, who not only had the nerve to magically pop in this very instant right beside them but was also wearing a huge sombrero on his head, holding a pink drink in his hand, including a cocktail umbrella and several fruits stuck into the glass, and was furthermore dressed up in very weird and colorful clothing indicating he had probably been on a wild party somewhere on a beach just a couple of seconds ago.
“You son of a -,” Dean started to say as he rushed forward towards Gabriel.
“Damn, this feels just so good,” Dean said breathlessly. “I’ve missed it. I’ve missed you. But most of all, I’ve missed seeing your face, seeing what it looks like when I fuck you.” Dean said as he was biting and kissing Castiel’s neck while still keeping an eye on the mirror and the reflection of Castiel’s face.
“I know, I love you too, Babe.” Castiel moaned as he felt that he was near the edge to blissfulness. “Please…. ah… please, don’t stop. I’m almost there!”
“Aaaah..” Castiel moaned.
The first thing Castiel did as soon as he was in the room was to remove the wig; it itched and it had also gotten rather hot under it. Then he wiggled out of his skirt, letting it slide to the floor while simultaneously taking his clean shirt off and leaving it on the table nearby. Then he removed the bra and the silicon pads he had used to stuff it accordingly. All he wanted was to get rid of all these things, take a shower, and then devour Dean’s body in all its beauty.
Dean immediately looked up and at the person who was calling him. It was Tara Benchley, a former classmate of Dean’s who was now a more or less successful actress. After they waited together until Castiel’s plane left, meanwhile talking about Tara’s amateur career and Dean describing elaborately his and Castiel’s vacation until then, they both went to Tara’s home where Tara tried to cheer Dean up with a little round of pity sex, which Dean of course enjoyed wholeheartedly.
Dean reached for the soap and began soaping himself before he did the same with Castiel, enjoying the thought of getting them both washed up just so they could devour each other’s bodies again as soon as they were able to.
In the meantime,” Castiel moaned as Dean’s strokes and words have not only made him fully hard, but he now also felt Dean’s own hardened member pressed against his back. “I’m going to take care of his wonderful woody, before I fuck him against the wall.”
Dean just smiled and said, “Thought so.” He let go of Castiel and swam over to the edge, got out of the Jacuzzi, and grabbed the two towels lying nearby. Then he reached for Castiel, helped him get out of the Jacuzzi, before he started rubbing Castiel and himself dry with the towels.
“Sounds like the perfect plan, my angel.” Dean said. He let go of Castiel’s hands and took the skirt from them, putting it on a small cabinet beside the door. Gently, he lifted Castiel’s head up with one hand so he could look into his eyes and murmured, “I guess what I want to say is, thank you, Castiel. You’ve made me very happy with this surprise and I still feel like I’m dreaming that you are actually here, and…” Dean didn’t finish his sentence, but instead leaned over and gave Castiel a soft French kiss.
They both smiled and after Castiel left the camera on the motorcycle, they held each other in a tight embrace, forgetting everything around them. Castiel dug his hands into Dean’s shirt, while Dean dug his fingers into Castiel’s already tousled hair and held him still while his tongue slowly and deliberately explored the shorter man’s mouth, kissing him just like he had the very first time they had met; being slow and gentle, making sure the other man had the opportunity to draw away anytime he liked.
Castiel let out a loud moan and said, “Yeees that’s what I think.”
“No, I think… Fuck!” Castiel swore as Dean’s calloused hand began moving faster again. “I think, I didn’t deserve this and you should have finished what you started.” Castiel said, his voice more desperate than firm and confident.
Just a few more and he would- “Fuck, Cas. I’m gonna-“
“Shhhh! Don’t worry, Cas-y, I’ve got a little surprise planned for you.” Dean said, his grin becoming wider.
“Mhm...” Dean mumbled, and while Castiel continued to tell Dean all about it, Dean took a second to stand up from the bed, and pull Castiel’s jeans and boxers down, leaving them on the floor beside him. He took the anal vibro balls and the lube out of Castiel’s hand and into his own left one, pulled Castiel a little more towards the edge of the bed, before he leaned on the bed again, hovering over Castiel for a minute, before giving him a long, hungry kiss.
“Come for me, Dean.”
Castiel slowly started rocking his hips back and forth, moving in and out of Dean, giving Dean the opportunity to get used to the intrusion, while he himself enjoyed the power he now had over his lover. And when he realized that Dean was far too gone for being able to operate the camera properly, he took it out of Dean’s hand and into his own one.
Dean, desperate because having waited for too long for his release and overjoyed to finally fuck his angel-like boyfriend again, just let go. He started to move faster, plunge himself deeper, all the while looking into the mirror, observing Castiel’s face that was ecstatically twisted with lust. He felt his orgasm rushing up on him and once he made eye contact with Castiel, it just overwhelmed him and he came with a long desperate scream.
But that was the past. Ever since he had met Dean, he too hooked up with all kinds of people when he felt like it. But in contrast to some of his brothers, he never deluded anybody just so he could fuck them; this was the part that was still completely in accordance with his old personality. He only slept with people who were looking for the same thing he did, meet fleetingly, have a good time, and then never see each other again.
Dean, always enjoying the feeling of being watched by his pretty blue-eyed angel, didn’t go easy on Donnie. And while repeatedly brushing over his prostate with hard thrusts, Dean simultaneously jerked him off, but not without shooting some glances at his beloved Castiel from time to time, turned on not only by the knowledge of being watched by him, but even more by knowing that Castiel was no less turned on by the sight in front of him.
Dean still couldn’t believe that Castiel actually got them tickets for it, even though it was through sheer luck. After they took a rather long tour through the castle, they finally settled for sleeping in a gigantic room that probably used to be the dancing hall.
“More thrilling?” Castiel thought, still panicked. How could THIS situation even become more thrilling? He had been wearing a very short skirt for quite some time now, and until a couple of minutes ago he’d also had vibrating anal balls inside his body, and on top of all that they had been driving on one hell of a big and powerful motorcycle, whose strong engines only intensified the vibrations Castiel felt due to Dean’s present, what in the world could ever top
“Of course we can.” Dean said, “Just keep your hands wrapped around my neck and your legs around my waist, alright?” Dean asked, and Castiel nodded. Dean moved a bit forward on the sofa so Castiel could wrap his legs around his waist, and then he walked back to the Jacuzzi, carrying Castiel with him.
“No! You didn’t allow me to cut you off, then you aren’t allowed to do that either.”
“Ah, bingo. I knew I remembered your weak spot correctly, even after all this time.” Dean said as he wrapped his right hand around Castiel’s dick and began stroking it. His body was shaking with lust and he already felt his orgasm starting to rush up on him when they both suddenly heard noises coming from the other room.
“Cas, what the hell?” Dean asked confused.
It just needed a few more thrusts over his prostate.
“No wait! I’m not done, yet!” Castiel said, as he reached out, stopping Dean’s hand midway.
“I’d never dare to do that, especially as this time,” Castiel now held the camera beside them on eye level while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on Dean’s, “I want to fuck you.” Castiel said seductively.
They had booked a nice all-inclusive two weeks vacation, leading them all over Europe; somewhere where they wouldn’t have to fight ghosts and vampires and all the other supernatural crap they had to face here on a daily basis. Dammit! After all the shit they’ve been through, they deserved a little break and nothing, NOTHING is going to come between them and their well-deserved vacation – and least of all a simple cold! This is also why Dean had pampered, or least tried to pamper, Castiel for the last couple of weeks, just to make sure he got better very soon. But despite his best efforts, Castiel was seriously doing his very best to show him just how much like a toddler he could behave.
