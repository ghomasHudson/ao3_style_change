Overhead, a gull lets out a high screech, and they tilt their heads upward to watch as it swoops down low and skims the lake’s surface.
“I’m sorry, Mr Singer, I know you were—”
Dean groans.
He doesn’t want to be that kind of parent to Jack. He doesn’t want to be a drill sergeant.
The truck’s tires
“Just a couple of security guards. I thought they were gonna call the cops on me at first, but I noticed pretty quick that there was something wrong with them.”
“Shit,” Dean says, and backs up, hitting the wall. “Holy shit.”
The cassette in the tape deck has been switched out three times—now, they’re listening to Zeppelin IV—and Dean is idly drumming the fingers of one hand on the seat between them as he sings along, a little louder than before.
“Big Bill Broonzy,” Castiel says as he rises, anticipating the question on the tip of Dean’s tongue.
about it. Thinks in endless circles.
Castiel has existed for longer than time has been measured, but the seconds he spends waiting for Dean’s response seem to stretch out into infinity in a way that no other moment ever has. The atmosphere in the room is close and crackling, like the air itself is waiting for an answer.
“Okay,” he breathes out, and steels himself to move forward. One foot after another. One step at a time.
Castiel imagines that he can actually see Dean’s brain stalling out as he stops walking, and even as he inwardly berates himself for saying something so vulgar and patently untrue—he’s kissed
“I’m not
of the satisfied sounds he makes while he eats it (that would be ridiculous, after all) but he does find himself wishing Dean would have agreed to stop for the night so that he might be granted the pleasure of hearing something similar from a closer vantage point than the other side of a diner booth.
“That’s awesome, Sam. Thanks.”
“It’s bad,” Turner says again. “I don’t know if I can--”
Together, they cross the street, heading for the park that acts as a shortcut between downtown Wichita and their neighborhood in North Central. Though the route isn’t
“Your eyebrows keep twitching,” he tells Dean placidly, ignoring the part of him that wants to drop the act and give in, time sensitivity of the case be damned. “Are you low on potassium?”
of all people, is putting up a roadblock?”
“Would another orgasm help you sleep?”
“Please,” Dean says again, and his mouth falls open as Cas eases inside, sliding torturously slow until his pelvis is pressed tightly to Dean’s sweat-damp thighs. He stays there, unmoving, gazing down at Dean with a look in his eyes like he’s not sure how they got here.
The ritual Hannah described seems simple enough--a few herbs bundled together into a smudge stick and waved over the jacket while Castiel repeats a string of Polish that Dean couldn’t remember if his life depended on it--but a few of the herbs were things Dean’s never heard of before, and though Hannah assured them that they’d find most at the supermarket, one was going to take a special supplier.
“Okay.”
“Tell that to your aorta.”
, to do what Chuck wanted him to do. As though his hand wanted to reach out and hold the grip, his finger itching for the trigger, the gun that was made for him, molded to fit his palm.
Staring at him now, Castiel knows exactly what Dean’s struggling to verbalize, and his stomach flips wildly. For a brief moment, he’s overcome with almost giddy anticipation; if Dean is finally trying to tell him what he
Dean waves a dismissive hand.
. He’d spent days planning it to make sure it was perfect. Hours putting it together. Weeks waiting for the right time, psyching himself up and making absolutely certain that he was ready to lay it all on the line.
The warm, metallic scent of motor oil lingers over everything here, and it’s soothing in a way that Castiel is uncertain how to quantify until he identifies the common thread between countless memories attached to it. Days spent on the road with the Winchesters, or hours in the scrapyard outside Bobby Singer’s house, or anywhere at all with Dean’s hand on his shoulder. He can imagine all of them at once as soon as the scent reaches his senses.
“Last resort,” Sam says diplomatically.
Chuck wanting to make them all suffer, though? That makes sense. That makes all the sense in the world.
“C’mere,” Dean says, pushing himself half-up on one elbow, and when Castiel does, Dean draws him into a slow, lazy kiss. When he pulls away, his expression is loose and happy. It warms Castiel to see, and he kisses him once more before settling beside him.
“I’m not gonna say I’m not pissed at you, or that we aren’t gonna have any issues… but yeah. That’d be okay with me,” Sam pauses and looks back at the closed bunker door. “He might tell you to get lost, though.”
“Gonna try.”
There’s a few hollow clicks as Sam pulls up his inbox, and then a low, “That’s so cool.”
are.”
The air is thick with the musty smell of rising damp and animal droppings, and cobwebs span the entire space. It doesn’t even look like squatters have been here recently—it’s too far out, too far from anything—and it seems that whoever last occupied the building took almost everything with them when they left.
Castiel has to reverse engineer Dean’s stilted speech to parse his meaning.
like, apocalypse bad?
Standing with one hand on the hood of his truck and his eyes on the glossy black paint of the Impala, he breathes deeply and lets himself sink into the feeling. He wants to stay here. He wants it so badly that his chest begins to ache all over again at the sound of Dean’s rapidly approaching footfalls in the hallway outside.
“Did the doctors say how long you have to stay in here?”
The moon is a waning crescent, barely giving off any light at all, and outside the tent, the sound of a water bird splashing on the surface of the lake is the only thing to disturb the quiet.
“I’m certain that I’ve seen you access traffic cameras multiple times.”
I see. Do you like a different kind of dinosaur now?
Dean makes an indignant noise, and the waitress grins. She points toward the two glasses she’d apparently left for them when they first sat down.
!” Dean throws his arms out to the side and teeters back and forth a few times before managing to right himself on the slippery wood. He feels his cheeks burning. “Shut up.”
“All lies, I’m sure,” she laughs.
“For lack of a better description, yes.” They’re silent for a moment. Cas sighs. “I miss my wings.”
“Not until this thing is less of a deathtrap,” Dean says. He lets out a grunt as they settle the compressor near the truck, and stands to wipe his dusty hands on his jeans. Castiel rolls his eyes.
He’ll make Dean think about the absurdity of it, and he’ll make him realize that not only
“Come to bed,” he hears himself saying, and Dean does as he asks, following him without once breaking contact.
“I’m--” Dean gasps, dizzy, and the hand on his cheek taps a couple of times to get his attention.
“Do you think he’ll actually speak with me?”
Sam lifts his eyebrows at the dated reference, but doesn’t comment on it. Just says, “You do realize Cas is going to help, right? I wouldn’t actually be lifting much of anything.”
,” Dean wheezes a laugh that turns into a moan as Castiel takes him into his mouth, sliding down as far as he can before pulling back to tongue at the tip. “Yeah. Okay.
“I mean… my chances of getting into college aren’t great, Cas. So I’ve been thinking that it’s better if we— if I prepare myself for that now.”
“I kissed Balthazar.”
At some point, years ago, his duty to help Dean and his desire to be close to him got all tangled up. He can no longer recall when he’d started healing him through unnecessary touch, but it’s the singular selfish thing that he does, and he’s not planning on stopping unless Dean tells him to.
They rattle against the wall; Dean glances up at them with the sudden worry that something might fall off and kill the mood.
“Yeah. But we’re still shit outta luck on the ideas front. Say we do catch up with Kelly… what then? ‘Cause I don’t know about you, but I’m not exactly thrilled about holding a pregnant woman captive while we figure out whether or not we have to kill her freakin’ baby.”
So, out of sight, his back to the wall in the alcove with the telescope they never use, Dean holds his breath and waits for his brother to walk away. He waits, and he waits, and finally hears his footsteps retreating. The high-pitched squeak of the fridge door follows shortly after, and then, a minute or two after that, the hush-
“Yes.”
“About what?”
“Don’t worry, Mom. You won’t find out.”
“You gonna start scrapbooking?” he asks, but leans against the railing all the same, his hips cocked forward with one thumb resting suggestively on the waistband of his jeans. There’s a heated look in his eyes, and Castiel can tell he’s trying to look as enticing as possible—as if he truly needs to make an effort. The picture he makes is not remotely appropriate to send to Claire.
“Only on the outside,” he says, and scrunches up his face when she looks at him like he’s crazy. “That made more sense before I said it. What’s all this?”
” Dean huffs. “He won’t think we’re crazy at all.”
Dean just stares, and Castiel wonders if he feels as dizzy as he does; if he can hear his blood rushing in his ears, feel his skin prickling with heat, his pulse thrumming in his throat like a bass note.
, he mumbles low, lifting his hand to grasp and tug at Dean’s wrist. Dean huffs and jostles him more firmly in response.
“That was a vastly different situation, Dean. You asked because you believed it would be better for
, Castiel thinks.
there.”
“Dean tells me you’re aware of the... strange circumstances of our meeting,” Castiel says, and Charlie nods vigorously.
next, and when they left town, it had ended up mixed in with his things, bundled up with the too-big Carhartt jacket he’d found at a garage sale in Idaho and shoved into the bottom of his duffel bag. That’s when it got the crease in the cover. The dog-eared pages came later, when he read it for the second time. Third time. Eighth.
“Let me guess—they had black eyes?” Dean says.
For the better part of twenty-three years, as he’s travelled in a seemingly endless and uneven loop around the lower forty-eight, there’s been a dog-eared, pilfered copy of Vonnegut’s
“Hey, Dean.”
“Perhaps some other time,” Castiel had offered, and Jianhong nodded, holding the book close to his chest before telling Castiel that he’d find something interesting for him to read on his next visit. Castiel had no intention to ever return, but he’d thanked him anyway before he finally latched on to what felt like it might be the right location and flew.
“Distance didn’t matter when I could fly.”
He tells himself he’s looking for Sam when he heads out into the school grounds shortly after. It’s a lie, of course. It’s barely after five in the morning, and he never even checked the classroom where his brother had been sleeping last night.
Sam makes a low sound, a concerned little hum, but Dean doesn’t elaborate. Just returns his gaze to the book.
Looking down at himself, Castiel sees no sign of injury, but when he glances up at the man he finds him gesturing toward his cheek. A touch brings away a bright smear of blood. He’d forgotten. Now, having had attention drawn to it, the torn skin stings and burns.
, is all Castiel can think.
“Why do you eat these things?” Castiel asks, even as he takes one. “They taste like the base molecular components of something that isn’t even food.”
or what he intends to do once they manage it—remains a mystery.
There’s still some trepidation in Jack’s eyes, but it’s lessened. Softer. Like maybe some of what Dean said might stick. He hopes it will. Hopes that if it doesn’t, he’ll be able to work at it until it does. More than anything, he hopes they’ll have time for it to come naturally.
“Okay, that might be enough,” Charlie says, heading for her computer. She glances back over her shoulder, gesturing for them to follow. “Any idea on how to spell the guy’s name?”
“Cas,” he forces out.
“My name is Castiel,” he says.
Dean snorts.
“I wasn’t doing anything.”
Dean’s voice is so small that Castiel can hardly hear him, but even so, all the oxygen seems to rush back into the room at the sound. Castiel feels full, suddenly. Alive where before he’d felt like the walking dead. God, he’d been an idiot to run. Dean’s here. Dean’s
“Well, we’re gonna need another angle for that,” Dean goes on as they both climb into the car. “Zoo security probably doesn’t even realize that anything happened, so telling them we need access to their tapes probably won’t work, even if we do make convincing agents. Too much risk it’ll draw attention.”
To Castiel’s relief, Dean jabs at the screen roughly with his thumb, ending the call before he can get any more furious. He drops back against the pillow with a heavy sigh, tossing the phone toward the foot of the bed. It bounces, just shy of falling off, and lands on top of a dark shape that might be Castiel’s suit jacket.
“We should set up camp first,” Castiel tells him before he can get too far. Dean just groans.
Nodding, Jack makes his way over and takes the seat furthest from the door. Back to the wall. Dean’s usual seat.
“There’s seventeen of them,” Sam says. It takes Dean a moment to catch on.
“It’s alright,” Castiel tells him. “Did you…”
The child and woman reunite, and the man walks away to join his waiting friends. Cas steps away from the window, letting the curtain fall back into place.
Coming to stand at Dean’s bedside, Sam’s hands raise and lower helplessly as he’s faced with the same dilemma Castiel struggled with—finding a way to comfort someone when they’re so extensively bandaged that you can’t find a safe place to rest your palm is not something either of them are equipped for.
yeah when i was like ten
Cas doesn’t answer, not aloud, but his face says
“It’s probably too soon for the joke I was just gonna make.”
Nodding, Charlie digs her phone from her pocket and starts searching, and Dean wracks his brain for something. Anything that might tell him where Castiel could have gone.
He wonders if perhaps this was a blessing. If being sent here thanks to his own lack of forethought when presented with the possibility of being closer to Dean was actually the gift, the blessing that Agata had promised him all those years ago.
reason.”
But when he pulls back, he’s still lost.
“Go on,” he tells Sam quietly. His voice is enough to alert Dean to their presence.
But still—
It’s exhausting, and painfully unfair.
“That’s one way to put it.”
“It’s fine,” Castiel tells him.
Dean can relate.
He winks at Castiel as he says it, though they both know full well that Dean is intending on eating the whole lot himself.
Castiel doesn’t have a good answer to Sam’s question, so instead he asks his own.
At this point, Dean’s things consist of a Power Rangers backpack snatched from the back seat of a stolen car in Arizona, two ill-fitting changes of clothes acquired in the same way, a plastic Diet Coke bottle filled with what John assures him is Holy Water, a stale granola bar, and half a bag of Funyuns he’s been hoarding just in case they can’t scrounge up anything more substantial to eat for a few days. His stomach aches as the salty scent of them wafts out of the bag, but he ate yesterday, and he can put it off a little longer.
“Is that Sam?” Castiel asks.
been on the road for a week,” he says.
He’s certain that the moment he steps out onto the pavement he’s going to fall to his knees and remain there until some outside force makes him stand. His limbs are loose and gangly, too long for his body and detached somehow, like he’s a puppet directed by some inexperienced hand.
“Well, that simply isn’t true.”
“Alright. Motel first—if we’re gonna be acting like civilians, we’re gonna need to change. These are the wrong kind of monkey suits for the zoo.”
Returning to the living room, Castiel takes a seat and considers every possible angle, noting them down on a scrap of paper as he goes.
from Dean’s cluttered bedside table and flipping through it. “This any good?”
When Dean meets his eyes, Castiel is certain that he’s understood.
“You should write me a list,” Dean says. “For next time. Stuff you can’t get your hands on. I’ll bring it back.”
“Okay?” Dean asks, and Castiel nods. Swallows until he can speak again.
“Good,” Sam says, and his voice has an airy quality that Dean remembers from when they were kids and Sam had spent the afternoon next door, jumping on Amy’s trampoline. “Really good.”
. The hooks in my skin. The way they made me— made me watch, while they pulled me apart. The things they made me do. The things I
“So where did he go?”
“I’ll walk back. I think the fresh air…” he trails off. The fresh air isn’t going to do him any more good than it already has, and they all know it. Nothing will. He feels as though gravity has been switched off. Any moment now, he’s going to be flung free of the spinning Earth.
“Dean.”
this before, but I’ve had a lot of time to think about it.”
Though, that’s not entirely correct, he thinks. He would have been certain within himself—he just would have been uncomfortably direct, and possibly made the clerk suspicious that he was engaging in something nefarious.
“It’s okay,” he says. “It’s okay, Dean. You’re home.”
real possibility that I’d lost my mind,” Castiel admits. “I also considered toxic gas, but that was ruled out early.”
For a long moment, Castiel is thoughtful, spreading his fingers against Dean’s before dragging them to the center of his palm and back again. Dean waits, patient.
“Thought I made that pretty clear last night.”
“Fuck-- Cas. No.”
, he thinks, and takes a deep breath. It’s a no-brainer, in the end.
Chuckling, Dean adjusts his laptop screen, angling it to avoid prying eyes and sun glare, and when Sam finally calls a couple of minutes later, he immediately sets to work, typing rapidly.
Though his hands are steady, Castiel feels as though they should be shaking as he lifts his hips to slide his pants free. He feels jittery. Every facet of him is buzzing with tension, or anticipation, or joy, or some borderless amalgamation of all three.
It’s been several hours since the rebels split off into groups—half retiring to their sleeping quarters while the others walked with purpose to keep sentry around the camp’s perimeter—and Castiel has made a point to visit every one, speaking with each of them until he understands as much of this place as he possibly can. Just in case.
To his surprise, Dean not only meets his gaze head on, but actually gives him a somewhat straight answer.
It’s tempting to just do it. A year ago—even a week ago—he might have. But he’s done with making decisions on Dean’s behalf. They’re in this together. If Dean truly wants to call things off, if he wants last night to be the end, if he’s considered the cost and determined it greater than he’s willing to part with, then Castiel will respect that and walk away. But he won’t decide alone.
up to. He just sinks lower into his seat and shuts his eyes, listening to the steady thrum of tires over asphalt.
If I put it back on, maybe it’ll happen again. His heart rate picks up.
It’s been three days since Castiel woke up alone, and though he’s been trying to focus on other things, he’s been all but useless. It’s only when he goes to make something for a late lunch that he realizes the pantry is empty, and he drags himself downstairs and across to the general store. The proprietor, a woman named Nora, looks up at him with a smile when he walks inside.
“Getting used to a different car is easier in the daylight,” Dean says lightly, then catches hold of Castiel’s tie, pulling him down for a brief kiss. “Plus, it occurred to me that seeing you behind the wheel of my baby might actually be kinda hot.”
“You felt guilty for noticing,” Dean guesses.
Dean rolls his eyes and lets out a low
“The jacket was bringing you to me,” Castiel says, finally finding his voice. “It was bringing you to me, and I’m already here, so there’s nowhere for it to go.”
, and for the first time in all time, he knows precisely what it is that he’s craving.
Sucking a barely-there smudge of frosting from his thumb in a move that Castiel suspects is not nearly as unconscious as Dean wants him to believe, Dean smiles. The effect is alarmingly similar to the sensation of being thrown free of his body. It must show on his face, because Dean just smiles wider.
“Now,” he says, briefly forgetting that Dean has not been privy to any of his thoughts, and when Dean doesn’t immediately respond Castiel pulls at his still frustratingly present jacket, at his brown plaid overshirt, his t-shirt, his jeans, his underwear. Low, impatient sounds rumble in his chest when every item of clothing removed seems only to reveal
“I— remember— you," Castiel tells him, each word stuttered out on a gasp, his voice higher than he knew he could make it. Dean makes a wounded sound, and fucks into him harder. Harder. His pace is relentless now. Brutal. As if he’s trying to fuck the nightmare that has been this last few weeks, months, years out of existence.
“Who are you, Dean?” Castiel asks him warily. “Why are you here?”
It’s almost enough to make Dean hysterical when he thinks about it, because he gave Cas blanket permission to control him, to command him, to have Dean completely at his mercy, and the first thing Cas decided to do with that power was turn it around and demand that Dean ask for what he wants.
“Thanks for getting us in,” Dean says once they’re close enough, and Benny grins, eyes flicking over to Castiel before returning to Dean.
He feels pinned in place, like a moth in a museum display, spread open for all the world to study. His mouth is bone dry. Tremors run through his limbs.
Sam and Jack glance at one another, and something in their expressions pulls Dean right back off the track that he’s barely managed to climb onto. What tiny speck of hope he still had that they might be able to get through this gutters and dies like a flame in a snowstorm.
He smiles again, letting out a quiet laugh.
“Yours,” Dean tells him. “Well, you can share the steak with me tonight. And I wouldn’t mind a slice of that pie after. Been looking forward to that. But the rest is all yours.”
, he’d said.
Dean sighs.
“Assuming she doesn’t line up another hunt by then,” Dean says. He sounds resigned, as though he’s moved beyond disappointment and into acceptance that he’ll never get the relationship with Mary that he needs so deeply, and it breaks Castiel’s heart to hear. “I’m thinking pancakes. You want?”
“I thought you said that thing was a telephone.”
“Your grandfather?”
“Just… don’t go far. I’ll come find you as soon as I get this shit with Sam squared away.”
, his whole body trembling with the force of it, of trying not to scream. Spots appear in his vision. His hands are numb and tingling. Cas is gone, he’s gone, he’s—
“You betcha. And hey, come visit when you can. It’d be nice to put a face to the name, and Dean—don’t forget you promised to make me one of your world-famous burgers sometime.”
“Show me how. Show me what you want.”
When he’s finally done, he clambers onto the kitchen counter and pulls down the manhole cover. It’s too high for him to pull himself up with only one good hand, but waiting for John to come back isn’t an option, so he heads outside in search of anything that might give him enough of a boost.
“Belphegor was lying.”
“Dean, it’s—”
“It’s a mangosteen,” he says, and Ruqayya hums.
Bobby and Ellen look up at him, then, and Ellen’s forehead creases as she takes in the way he’s fidgeting in the doorway. She spreads an arm out toward him, lip quivering even as she tries to smile, and it’s enough to stop him questioning his welcome.
“I thought I’d bring you some stuff from, um... from 2008,” Dean says. “Prove that I’m not trying to dupe you.” He gives Castiel a nervous smile. “You don’t think I’m trying to dupe you, right?”
“Seriously? Dude, you and Cas are a mess just as friends. But together? God, that would be a trainwreck. I can’t think of a worse couple, and I dated Ruby.”
“I am. And I’ll try to keep a lid on my dumbass thoughts while you’re gone,” Dean adds, before looking at Castiel hopefully. “There’s no way you can, y’know… turn it off?”
He thinks back to that day, remembers dropping a single-serving worth of broad beans into the saucepan, and wondering if he would ever find someone to share his life with. He’d have been happy enough with Daphne, even if their marriage would have been only for show. Just having someone to share his evening meals with would have been enough.
“Physically? Probably,” Castiel says, and Dean adds; “But there’s no way this isn’t a nightmare for her. How did she seem?”
“What?” Dean asks, too caught off guard to come up with a convincing enough lie. There’s barely even a pause before Sam responds.
“I love him, Sam. And if our conversation tomorrow goes the way I’m hoping it will, I’m sure we’d both appreciate your support.”
If there are words he should be saying, he can’t find them. They all seem to catch in his trachea, forming a big, hot lump that makes it difficult to breathe. Absurdly, it makes him want a cigarette. He ignores the impulse.
“What did he say?”
Castiel takes a photo of himself smiling and giving the camera a thumbs up, and sends it back.
Since Cas left, Dean has opened his text message thread more times than he can count just to stare at the conversation there.
They weren't supposed to sleep together until much later in this fic, and when they did I'd planned on it being fade-to-black kind of stuff. But no matter what I did, they kept trying to bang in explicit detail, way ahead of schedule. When I finally gave up and just let them, they refused to make it a quickie. Hence the 10k word chapter and the rating change. I hope y'all enjoyed it :) Sorry for the long wait!
The man in the picture, the man he suspects Castiel ran away with--he’s not here now, and it’s likely that Castiel hasn’t seen him since the war. All this time, Castiel has had the means to find him in an instant, and Dean’s wasted it.
“I know it doesn’t make sense,” Dean goes on. “He’s— I mean, he wasn’t actually— But, you really look like him.”
“Anytime.”
“Me too, sweetheart.”
Inside, the main room is cluttered and overfull with folding tables.
“I guess. But, man… still didn’t think you’d be so chill,” Sam snorts quietly, the low laugh jarring when his next words make Dean’s soul shrink in on itself in shame. “Anyway, it’s a good thing you don’t swing that way.”
Smoke and freezing air billow in the cargo hold, and Daniel pats Castiel twice on the cheek, wild-eyed, before he leaps out into open air.
“It was an hour and forty minutes,” Castiel corrects him, and pulls out a third dish--a salad with olives and tomatoes.
She narrows her eyes.
“Why don’t you go make yourself comfortable?” he says, before gesturing down at himself. “I need to get dressed.”
“Do you think you could wait for like... half an hour?”
Bobby gives a gruff nod, and together he and Ellen make their way into the elevator. Castiel watches the doors close before he continues down the hall.
“What the fuck else was I gonna do? Say
“Wow,” he breathes.
is Cas reclining casually on Dean’s bed and tapping the rhythm on his own chest while Dean finished the last few questions of his math homework, making him take twice as long just by being so damn distracting.
“Dean?” he calls out, and Dean stops walking without turning around. Knowing that it’s a risky move, Castiel rounds him, trying to catch his eye. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Dean practically dives for his keys. Charlie, through some sneaky maneuver that she probably learned from the Moondoor Magician’s Guild, somehow manages to slip them out of his hand and put them in her pocket in one dizzyingly fast movement.
“He asked for you,” Bobby says, and even under these circumstances, some part of Castiel thrills at the knowledge that Dean wants him there. The giddy feeling comes and goes swiftly, leaving something closer to guilt in its wake. This really isn’t the time. His throat clicks as he swallows. “Sergeant Ballard said he wanted to know about you, and Sam, and—” Bobby’s lips purse momentarily. “And Mary.”
“Dean?” Sam prompts, and Dean shakes his head.
Frowning, Castiel taps his thumbs on the steering wheel. The plan, as far as he knew, had been for them to both apply to MIT—a lofty dream, but one that he truly believed they could both achieve—along with several other schools. Dean had been talking about studying mechanical engineering since he learned that it existed, while Castiel had his sights firmly set on aeronautics, and there was enough overlap between the two that they’d always talked about going to the same college.
“I thought you were doing okay?”
“Eh, it didn’t suck. It’s no
“I guess,” he says, and Castiel is glad that he’s at least managed to retain some of what Castiel had told him the last time he became convinced that he wasn’t smart enough. He’s never been one to hold back from an argument.
The world is too colorful, he thinks. That’s what’s really throwing him off. Logically, he knows that the only reason the past looks the way it does in old newspaper photographs is because of fading ink, but at this point logic isn’t ranking all that high in his head.
Bobby snorts, his mouth twitching into a barely-there smirk as he lifts the receiver.
The ink-dark lines on her skin shift, coiling around her fingers and wrists and disappearing under the long sleeves of her robe. Her eyes are shrewd. Calculating.
“Andy, Theo, keep your--”
“Three words, Dean: Moondoor. Royal. Wedding. It’s gonna be amazing.”
John took the rosary with him, not that he considers Dean capable of blessing the water himself anyway, and his insistence that anything but holy water is nothing but a conduit for a demon to enter the body seems entirely reasonable to Dean in this moment.
“So,” Dean says, clicking his teeth. “I guess I’ll, uh... I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Sorry?”
Tightening his fingers in Cas’ coat, Dean nods, just barely. He’s not panicking, he reminds himself. He’s not panicking.
“Every hour in your time is roughly sixty in mine.”
“Hello, Dean,” he says, and Dean’s tense shoulders lower, just a little. He smiles back just as the waitress arrives with his coffee.
“Oh, will I?”
-- please--”
“Along with two other guys--uh, a flight officer, Rufus Turner, and a turret gunner, Gabriel Sugarman. Turner got picked up pretty quick, but he had a shattered hip from the impact, so he was discharged pretty much right away. He was still around until about a year ago. Lived in Omaha. Sugarman was captured, but somehow convinced the enemy that he was one of their spies, and fed them all bullshit while collecting intel for our guys before he eventually got away. His book is one of the files I sent you.”
She’s just sat down when an embarrassed look passes over her face, and she moves to stand again.
“Are you
When Dean emerges from the bathroom in a cloud of steam a few minutes later, Castiel is dressed and sitting on the end of the unmade bed, holding a paper cup of substandard instant coffee from the vending machine outside their room. Dean’s eyes zeroes in on it like there’s a spotlight on Castiel’s hands.
“—you always answered. Even if you didn’t realize you were doing it. Even if your answer wasn’t always what I wanted to hear. In a lot of ways, putting my faith in you is the single most important thing I’ve ever done, because it was the first time in my existence that it was an expression of my own will. Faith became an act of love where before it had always been an act of forced deference. It changed me.
It’s fitting, he thinks. God hasn’t been here in years.
On the bed beside him, turned inward with his hand splayed over Castiel’s bare stomach, Dean has been floating in a state of sated oblivion for a little over an hour. Though his lips still betray a hint of the smile he’d had before he drifted off, his features are relaxed. He looks calm. Serene. Beautiful.
“Thanks for the warning,” she says.
“What do you think?” Dean asks now, and Castiel blinks, raising his gaze from Dean’s neck to meet his eyes.
“Yes. I haven’t replied yet. I wasn’t sure what to say.”
it is. How much he likes the thought of Dean taking pleasure in the anticipation of his touch. In Dean’s hand, against his lip, Castiel’s cock twitches. It doesn’t go unnoticed.
“Your,
towel yet.
One is Claire, of course. One is Jody Mills, who he’s yet to speak with directly, and another is the landline for the house where they live. The fourth is Sam. The last three are all Dean. His regular cell, his other cell, and his other, other cell.
“Not exactly, but I uh. It was a medical facility, and I’m not a hundred percent sure, but I think it was at the zoo?”
Dean’s clothes don’t quite fit Castiel. The jeans are too wide, and the shirt is snug on his shoulders, but they smell of Dean, and wearing them makes Castiel feel a little better. He pulls his feet up onto the couch and hugs his knees to his chest as he stares at the television.
In his head, Dean sings
Between Dean, Cas, Jules, and her three hunting buddies, they manage to transport all of the bodies out of the town and into a disused warehouse on the same highway as the school with minimal injury, though Jules’ friend Hank ends up with a broken thumb that Cas heals with a little more effort than Dean’s used to seeing him need to expend. Something else to worry about later, Dean thinks.
He’s crouched down beside a scraggly little terrier whose stubby tail is wagging frantically as she sniffs and licks at Cas’s knuckles. With his heart aching, Dean watches Cas smiling at her for a few moments before he finally clears his throat, and Cas looks up, startled. Dean wonders how he managed to sneak up on a guy with angelic super hearing.
“C’mon, someone’s gotta have something.”
“You sure this is a good idea?”
“Good idea,” Castiel tells him. “I’ll organize our lunch while you’re gone.”
Rowena is waiting when they reach the edge of Belphegor’s barrier forty minutes later, her hands perched on her hips as she stares down a rapidly growing number of ghosts on the other side. As usual, she’s wildly overdressed for the occasion. As usual, she has an expression on her face that suggests that, in fact, it’s everybody else who’s failed to live up to her sartorial expectations.
“Yeah, I know, Cas,” he laughs, catching hold of one of Castiel’s wrists and holding him steady. “I pointed them out to you.”
“Hm. I could slow down,” Castiel suggests, grinding his hips almost to a complete stop, pressed deep. Dean all but whimpers. “Or I could—”
Pushing to his feet, Castiel heads toward his bedroom and pauses in the doorway.
“I’ll write him back,” Dean says, and pulls his phone from its place in the console. Castiel doesn’t ask what he’s typing; just starts up the car and carefully pulls out of the gas station, following the signs to get back onto US-110.
“Time away from
“That’s a computer?” Castiel says flatly.
“Okay,” Castiel nods, raising his arms to cross them tight across his chest.
“I really don’t want to ask you to leave.”
he’d grinned that afternoon when Dean had taught him how to drive. Dean still remembers the rush of warmth he’d felt, knowing that Jack was happy to be spending time with him.
It’s quiet at the bar this time, and they take a booth near the stage. A man in an ill-fitting suit is sitting at the piano, picking out a slow tune on the keys, and Dean can’t help but wonder if he’s an official musician or just a drunk who noticed the piano stool was unclaimed.
“Happy?” he asks, and Castiel smiles at him.
Without breaking their kiss, he loosens Cas’ tie and unbuttons his shirt. Untucks the hem and works his hands underneath, skipping fingertips over Cas’ taut stomach and catching the fine hairs under his navel before sweeping lower.
, Sam. Not right now. If I… if I go there, I’m gonna lose it.”
. But that doesn’t help anyone, he realizes, so he settles on honesty at the last moment.
“Hey, it’s okay. You don’t have to apologize.”
“We— I— we looked for you, all over. You know that? I— I prayed to you. I interrogated every last angel I could get my hands on, and—
“Did it work?” he whispers, and feels his panic return anew when Dean pulls him into a tight embrace. “Dean, did it work?”
Castiel lets out a low snort.
“Yeah,” Dean nods, hating that he can feel himself blushing. “I mean, we kissed, and it seemed like he wanted to do it again, so... yeah. I think so.”
“You two done flirting? Movie’s about to start.”
I hope you enjoyed this flashback to a simpler time for the boys!
“Thank you,” he says.
“Nothin’,” he says, but then he shrugs. “Is it weird that I’m glad you still piss me off?”
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice. He digs in, scooping a generous helping of the lasagne and a polite helping of the salad onto his plate before taking the chunk of bread Castiel offers him. His eyes roll back with the first bite, and he can’t suppress a moan when he tastes the rest.
He’s guilty that he’s starting to wish that John had never had the surgery in the first place. That he’s starting to wish that they’d never even found the tumor; that the cancer had just taken him without warning.
“No, I’ve got it,” he says automatically, but deflates as soon as he looks up and catches the dubious expression on Dean’s face. He sighs. “The instructions are gone, and last time I set this up, Daniel was yelling at me the entire time.”
He grins, and it’s a wild, feral thing that makes Castiel want him all the more. His hand is still in Dean’s hair, and he uses his grip to pull him up.
Jo—though she’s half his size—is just as bad.
“Sorry,” he says, sliding his arms out of the sleeves. “Do you want me to put it back in the trunk, or--”
“Dean?”
The man is holding a spatula in his hand in a way that is probably intended to be far more threatening than it actually is. Dean leans down through the opening, holding out a hand.
, even though it hurt you.”
“Man after my own heart,” he says.
“Would you like to engage in fellatio, Dean?”
“Just… something stupid I said. I can’t even remember it now,” he lies, and picks up a stick from the ground just to do something with his hands. He spins it around between his fingers a few times. Prods at the dry earth and draws a circle. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. If I’m being honest, it was all kind of boring.”
In the space of a second, Castiel’s heart soars and plummets.
He’s certain Dean only meant for him to call when he needed help and Crowley was no longer available, but the quiet of the room is unbearable, and there are only seven phone numbers in his contacts list.
That pressure in his throat is back. The part of him that exists on a hair trigger, poised and ready to defend him from an enemy that doesn’t exist.
“Wanted to do this for years,” he says, delivering a nip to his heated skin.
Worse, that something has happened to the jacket, and he can’t come back.
“Nothing. It doesn’t matter.”
Sam just raises his brow. Castiel’s hands are damp with sweat.
Cas would want him to get through this. Cas would believe he could.
“I don’t want to,” he hedges.
Castiel vigorously shakes his head.
The house’s back door sticks when they try to open it, the wood swollen and jammed in its frame. When they finally get inside, stumbling into a kitchen with a peeling linoleum floor and a sink full of leaves and broken glass, Dean hears something skittering away from them in the next room. Birds or mice or squirrels, kicking up dust.
“I’m awake,” he says.
“I’m beginning to think you might have an unhealthy attachment to this car.”
“What makes you so sure I’m gonna help?”
His soul is in his fingertips, and Castiel feels it shifting beneath his skin. It’s overwhelming. Castiel wonders if Dean feels it, too.
She hums in agreement.
So by now, Dean is used to his own callused fingers. He’s more than accustomed to his own meagre reach that he’s never quite managed to get deep enough to really satisfy. But Cas’ fingers are softer than Dean’s. Long and clever; gentle until they’re not.
“Your Highness,” he says.
“Do you think you could do me a favor?” Dean asks, drawing his attention back. Castiel leans his chin on his free hand as he gives a small nod.
“I suppose I could start that research.”
“Still a bright kid, then,” she smiles, and waits for Ellen and Castiel to sit before she and Henriksen do the same. Folding her hands atop some files on the table, she looks around at the three of them. “So. Good news at last.”
Dean can see him up ahead, pulling into the last gas station before they reach Lebanon. His left brake light is dim.
Dean’s brow furrows, but after a moment he just gestures at himself with a smirk as if to say,
“He seemed a bit glum, but he was never a particularly cheerful fellow, so I’m afraid I didn’t think on it too much,” Winchester reported.
“I’ve never seen one,” Castiel admits. “But they’re supposedly the size of a small house.”
One after another, again and again and again.
Castiel is lost after that. It comes over him like a wildfire, impossible to outrun, and when he drags Dean against him it’s with a broken moan. He tastes like cheap beer and smoke. Like Hell’s claws are still grasping at him, trying to drag him back even as Castiel kisses him.
“So. Last night,” Sam starts a few minutes later, as Dean starts mixing. The whisk sings against the sides of the metal bowl. “That was a lot.”
There’s a haunted look in Castiel’s eyes, and it only grows worse the more he speaks, the more he tells Dean about what happened—Belphegor’s scheme to take over, how he’d tried to pull all the power of every twisted soul into himself. How he’d tried to manipulate Cas into sparing him by impersonating Jack.
if you’re not paying close enough attention.
“Get dressed,” Dean says as he heads for the bathroom, scooping his jeans and t-shirt up as he goes. “I’m not calling Donna back while you’re lying there doing your best Kate Winslet impression. No matter how much I like it.”
“I need to find my Royal understudy.”
It has to be.
“Are you embarrassed?”
With the airport in Damascus indefinitely closed, he arrives via boat from Cyprus, standing uncomfortably beside the captain as they approach the shore by cover of night. He swims the last mile alongside a handful of rebels, and helps them remain unseen as they scurry onto land. As difficult as his own journey is going to be, he knows that theirs will likely be worse.
“With Mom and Jack. Sleeping. Don’t think he wanted to be alone while he’s in the camp.”
Dean stops playing when he sees Castiel walking back to camp, and he puts his guitar away and wanders over to help.
He looks up when Dean walks in, and snatches his hand away from the desk as though he thinks Dean will tell him he shouldn’t be touching anything. His eyes are puffy. His cheeks are wet. The sight makes Dean’s chest ache, but he doesn’t let himself look away.
Dean closes his eyes.
Involuntarily, Dean whines low in his throat, and squeezes Cas in his hand, and Cas just
“You think this guy flew a B-17?”
Dean knows he’s right, but his ears are ringing, and his vision is clouded, and he’s so damn angry that he can’t think straight.
So, on the mile-long list of things that Chuck has thoroughly ruined, Dean’s appreciation for Vonnegut novels has to be somewhere near the bottom in terms of importance, but… man.
“I don’t know. I just… that note he left never made any sense to me.”
Once Dean is done, the tent poles click together easily, the guy ropes stay in place without any trouble, and they get the tent upright and fit for sleeping in within half an hour.
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”
WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE STILL STANDS
For all he knows, John is going to drive the two of them clear off a bridge.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean replies, heading toward the workbench where he keeps an assortment of car maintenance tools. “Just give me a minute.”
“You never told me what it said…”
Sam’s face pales a little, but he nods.
“Go for it,” the clerk says. “Card scanner’s been acting up, so this might take a minute.”
Looking back now, Dean realizes that he never really understood his father.
Dean lowers the stylus, and Charlie Parker crackles through the attic as he makes his way over.
“This any good?” he asks. It’s a fairly obvious attempt to change the subject, and Castiel appreciates it, even if his own response is lacking.
More footsteps. Another clatter. Another thud. Dean watches as a mote of dust descends from the ceiling, slow, slow, slow, and thinks of pink fibres that burned against his skin, a lifetime ago. An attic that felt too cramped and dry.
As though he’s thinking the same thing, Dean’s eyes drop down to his lips as he nears, visibly distracted even as he lifts his chin, defiant in his attempt to play offended.
“—gonna die if we get pizza.”
Fighting against the lump in his throat, Castiel keeps grinning and pushes down on Dean’s shoulders, dunking him under the lake so he has a chance to get away. Put some distance between them.
Distantly, he’s aware of her palm settling against his back. It should be comforting. She intends it that way. Instead, all he can think about is that for five years, nobody has touched Dean unless it was to cut him open.
“Can we stop soon?” he asks, the car bouncing horribly over the cracked asphalt.
He wonders if it’s worth getting someone to come check the building’s foundations. The attic, too. He’s pretty sure there’s a hole by the window up there. He rubs at his eyes with a sigh. He’s been putting off going into the attic since he moved in, but there are dozens of storage boxes up there, and it needs to be done.
It seems to take forever to reach the right floor. Castiel is certain it didn’t take this long the first time, but his memory of the day is a complete jumble. A glance at the clock on the elevator tells him it’s barely been three hours since the phone rang in the garage and tilted his world on its axis, but it feels like a week.
“I know you, Dean. You know how to disappear if you don’t want to be found. But you keep setting up these little…”
Three dots appear at the bottom of the screen.
“Yes.”
“I’m not! I just— I don’t know anything. I swear.”
“Not really,” Dean says, then glances away. Shakes his head and huffs. “Actually, yeah. Pretty much since we got off the phone.”
“What’s your-- dude, you don’t even have a passcode on this thing.”
With his hands spread across the table between them, Dean catches Jack’s downcast gaze and tries to do better.
A fatal combination of reflex and utter exhaustion makes him ask, “What’s the news, Jack?” without thinking. The moment the name leaves his mouth he feels a sick, slithering lurch in his gut, skin prickling hot and cold. The taste of bitter bile floods his mouth.
“You sound pretty sure of yourself there, Cas.”
With a sigh, he lifts the flight jacket onto his lap and looks it over again. It’s unlikely that he’ll ever track down someone related to Castiel, and though he’s sure the jacket would fetch an obscene amount of money were he to take it to an antiques dealer or an auction house, he can’t bear the thought of it ending up on display somewhere in a cold glass case. It’s stupid, but after spending his entire night reading about this man, he feels like selling the jacket would be a betrayal. He might not know Castiel, but he feels like he could have. Like if they were to have met, they would have been friends.
“Already did. Check your email.”
“No.”
“For the anxiety,” Dean says, and now he looks a little uncomfortable. A little on edge. Castiel suspects he didn’t quite mean to mention it. “Doesn’t do much for the nightmares, though. Truth be told it doesn’t do a hell of a lot for the anxiety a lot of the time, either. You saw my freakout a few days ago. Though I guess that’s not exactly a shocker, considering.”
Cas frowned in confusion, and searched for the corresponding emoji when he typed out his response.
He holds on to Ellen and hopes that she knows it.
Without another word, the man steps forward to pass half the wood over for him to carry, and heads toward the house Castiel had been watching.
It’s pointless to entertain these thoughts at all, he knows. He’d be far better off trying to get past this damn crush before it drives him mad. With a sigh, Castiel closes his eyes for a moment and flexes his fingers, once, twice, against the pillow before pulling his hand back.
He pretends not to notice that way Cas stares after him like he thinks he’s leaving for good.
Castiel doesn’t answer. Instead, he asks “Does he still want to see me?”
Never mind.
“Just tell me what you need.”
The dark pillowcase. The soft blanket.
It’s as though Cas can see where he needs to be touched; like he’s following a map laid out on Dean’s skin, every nerve ending a pinpoint of need that Cas hones in on, easy as anything. He licks and bites and sucks and strokes every single place that Dean needs to be touched. Gives him what he wants before Dean even knows he wants it. Gives it to him like he
Dean says it like it’s nothing, like it’s a joke. Castiel thinks, not for the first time, that if he were ever to meet John Winchester, he’d rather like to punch him in the throat. For now, he’ll settle for righting this specific wrong.
“Well, I didn’t say that.”
Castiel’s still relieved enough that Dean reacted well to him coming out a few months ago that he doesn’t bother reminding him that of the two of them,
, he realizes. He can’t touch Dean’s soul without digging through the smoke and sulfur choking it, and as much as he loathes the thought, that’s a part of him now.
“Dean, I’m sorry.”
His pants go the same way, lost between one breathless moment and the next, and Dean touches every stretch of skin he can get his hands on.
“Where’s Sam?”
“Are you just gonna stand here poking holes in everything I say, or was there a point to your visit?”
, Cas.”
“See? Cas doesn’t mind,” Dean says, and puts the mug back down before he squeezes Castiel’s shoulder. “What’re you reading?”
In the last few moments before waking, he’d been dreaming of something, but it fades from his memory as soon as he opens his eyes. Only the ephemeral sense memory of it remains — a feeling of deep contentment, the echo of someone murmuring something hushed and sweet, whisper-soft against the skin of his neck. He wants the dream back, and turns his face against the pillow, willing himself back to sleep.
He stares at the faucet.
Dean perks up.
Parker Thompson’s house is a two-story brick colonial in Palisades, not far from the hospital where he works.
“You have a scar.”
“Fireworks already?” Dean asks.
“I knew you’d never be able to resist me.”
“Cas, Charlie, Charlie, Cas,” he says, then looks at her pointedly. “Told you I wasn’t making it up.”
Rubbing at his mouth, Dean lets out a quiet, helpless sound and conks the back of his head against the passenger side window.
Jack seems surprised that Dean has asked, and it’s just proof that Dean needs to work harder. To try. To spend whatever time they still have being the kind of person that Cas would want to take care of their kid.
Carefully, he presses his palm against the half-healed wound. He grits his teeth at the sharp pain that follows, blinking away the spots that dance in his vision, then sucks in an icy breath and resumes walking.
They run.
When that last message had come through, Dean had stared at the heart emoji for so long that his phone had gone to sleep. He'd wondered, briefly, if it was Cas finally giving up on waiting for Dean to make the first move. If it had been an act of bravery; a tiny, hopeful offering to make Dean brave, too. But Dean had still chickened out.
“Oh, uh... I don’t know if you will. He lives pretty far away, so. I guess it all depends on what happens tomorrow.” Dean sighs before offering a smile. “But we’re not thinking about that right now, right?”
“I’m not there. I’m in Washington.”
“So… alright. I maybe met someone.”
“You’ll get a stiff neck,” he says when he feels Dean’s questioning gaze lands on him. “And seeing as you presumably won’t let me fix it for you in the morning—“
A vein twitches in Sam’s forehead; his lips purse.
Dean doesn’t know how he’s going to get past this.
“You have me now.”
“You don’t have to tell me, but if you’re worried about telling me… look, just… I might get it more than you’re expecting me to get it.”
,” Dean says, crowding forward and shoving him in the chest. It’s not hard enough to hurt, but it’s hard enough that he staggers backward into the wall. That he feels the air knocked out of him. “You— you thought I’d feel
“Dean.”
“That article... I thought Cas had run off with some soldier from his crew, but Charlie, it was
He wriggles his eyebrows, inordinately pleased with himself for his joke, but Castiel just rolls his eyes and leans out of reach when Dean tries to prod him again.
“Well, we’ll figure it out when I get back. Who all showed up, anyway?”
It might be okay. It might work. It might—
Inside the crypt, breathing is a little easier. It's musty with old leaves and dust, but the thick stone walls have kept it relatively free of the miasma that permeates the air outside. They set up the spell quickly. For a moment, it seems as though it’s working.
“I’m serious.”
Their cargo hold is stacked high with rations and medical supplies, and the plan is to sweep in, make the drop, and be well on their way back to the Allied base in London before the occupying forces have a chance to do a damned thing about it. The general consensus for the likelihood of things actually going that way seems to be
After what happened this afternoon, Sam’s absence from Dean’s side is noteworthy enough to make Castiel apprehensive about joining him, but he pushes past his reservations and powers ahead. He’d rather sit with Dean in silence than go anywhere else, and though Dean has never said so, he knows that he’s not alone in his preference for spending what little downtime they have together.
He finishes the letter, and rubs at his stinging eyes. It’s nearing half-past twelve, and the remaining two files are a five page account of the actions that resulted in Castiel being awarded his Medal of Honor and Distinguished Flying Cross, and the book written by the gunner on Castiel’s first B-17.
“Eileen’s Deaf,” Sam explains. “But, I’ll, um... I’ll pass it on.”
“So, I had an idea. To help make my resolution work.”
Sam’s eyes widen, as though he’d still half-expected otherwise.
“Magic jacket?” Castiel asks, and Dean’s mouth lifts at the edges, his eyes warm.
A dozen or so feet from him stands a thin man with watery gray eyes. He must be in his fifties, and is not dressed in military uniform, but he carries a rifle over his shoulder, and he eyes Castiel’s coat. Castiel stands a little straighter. Grips his knife, just in case.
They’re already here. They’ve found him. The wards haven’t worked, and—
The next has a weapon of his own—a short, curved blade—and it nicks the skin of Castiel’s neck, drawing blood but not grace. Castiel rewards him for his effort with a well-place strike through the throat, and pushes the djinn free of the blade with a grunt.
Castiel huffs, a humorless laugh that makes him feel more human than he has in years. “I won’t debate that.”
Dean’s heart sinks.
, Castiel had said.
“Okay,” Sam says finally, carefully. “It’s okay.”
“It’s alright,” he assures her, and heads back home.
“Yeah? Dashing good looks, winning all the carnival prizes, swarmed by beautiful women?”
Castiel doesn’t think he’s wrong in that fear.
Castiel does, sending it further this time. Pressing his love, his desire, his need into Dean’s skin until he can feel it the way Castiel does; soul-deep and soaring.
Dean thinks, glancing over at Castiel in the dark car as he parks.
Dean thinks. Then;
“Wait,” Castiel says, pulling him back, and Dean goes willingly, clutching his arm as Castiel kisses him deeply, one hand curled into the hair at his nape. He pulls back, just slightly, to speak. “Just... can you wait a moment?”
“Have you met them yet?”
day? I’d been thinking about you as a soldier, so I can’t work out why it didn’t drop me into a warzone.”
Chapter warnings: hallucinations brought on by severe dehydration/starvation/isolation, John inflicting physical violence on Dean, Dean has some thoughts which border on suicidal, Dean is sick several times in this chapter.
“Of course, Dean. Anything.”
At the next town they pass, John insists that they ditch the car. It’s still daylight, and as John hot-wires a navy blue Chevy Lumina in a parking lot opposite a realtor’s office and a library, Dean can’t tell if he’s more afraid that they’ll be seen, or that they won’t.
But Dean looks at him—forces himself to really look at him—and understands why Cas did it. Why he took on that burden. Jack was Cas’ son. He was
“Two queens or a king?” the clerk asks after he’s made his requests, and Castiel pulls his wallet from his back pocket.
Its energy signature sings in holy space, thrumming against his grace in a way that makes him feel as though he’s stuck his head under the lip of a church bell at midnight. It’s almost unbearable, the vibrations making his skull feel too tight, but he ignores it as best he can even as he follows the energy back to its source.
Thanks again to Maria for her invaluable feedback during the editing process <3
“I guess,” Dean shrugs. “But it means I can find out what kind of things were rationed. So if you don’t tell me which things you’re missing, you’re just gonna end up with everything.”
, he thinks.
Castiel hates this. He hates that this has become another problem for them to solve. That he’s driving to the only place he’s ever come close to thinking of as home, and instead of being happy to be headed there, happy to be on his way to see Sam, whose friendship he values deeply, he’s dealing with
“Did something happ—”
“No,” she says after a moment. “You have no need for it, do you?”
“Let’s say,” he says, spinning his lighter between his fingers. “Let’s say I’m beginning to entertain the notion that perhaps I haven’t lost my mind.”
Dean doesn’t answer for a moment. As Castiel watches him, he looks down at their joined hands and runs his thumb over Castiel’s knuckles. Castiel barely suppresses a pleased shiver at the sensation.
There’s a clear, deliberate weight to Dean’s words, and although Castiel recognizes it for what it is almost immediately, he hasn’t got the slightest clue how he’s expected to address it. How could he? They’ve kept such a delicate balance for so long that even this one sentence feels monumental. It’s as though Dean has casually dropped an anchor onto a scale that would have been thrown off kilter by a feather, and now he’s just sitting here, acting as though he hasn’t just thrown out the entire rule book of their relationship.
“He won’t mean it,” Sam cuts in. He steps forward, ducking his head a little and forcing Castiel to meet his eyes. “You hurt him, Cas. A lot. But he wants you here. I don’t know if he even realizes how much.”
“I don’t understand why you’re suddenly acting so reticent,” Castiel says.
“Yeah.”
you dick.”
“Good morning,” he says instead.
“So, what--he’s Castiel’s grandson?”
“So... you’re not--” Charlie cuts herself off this time, catching Dean’s downturned mouth, and shakes her head. “Okay. Cool. So who are you looking for?”
do, not on what they can’t.
They hike through the trees, following a vague path worn down by other visitors until they come to the river. It’s wider than Dean expected, rocks and fallen branches sticking up out of the water. On the opposite bank, a wide, flat rock sits in a patch of dappled shade, making a perfect spot to stop for lunch. Side by side, they walk upstream, looking for a place to cross. Stones clatter and roll underfoot as they follow the ascending riverbank. A fallen tree comes into view just around the bend, and Dean points toward it.
Cas fixes him with that look. The one Dean had been thinking of. Brow raised, jaw set, eyes dark. For a moment, Dean forgets to breathe.
“No. I can’t.”
All he can do now is wait.
All in all, it’s really nothing new for someone like him. He’s well versed in fear and phantom visions, and the anger thing… well, that’s not something he’s ever been short on. And definitely not now.
“Dean, wait--”
“Nah,” Dean says, and opens his eyes. “Watch the road.”
“Will do,” Dean says.
“I’ve known Bobby for almost as long as you have, and he doesn’t strike me as the sort of person who would put his business on the line for someone out of some sense of obligation. If he’s offered to take you on, it’s because he thinks you’ll be able to do the job and do it well. Don’t turn him down just because you’re worried that you don’t deserve it.”
Henriksen’s lips twitch, his eyes dropping away for a moment, and Castiel gets the distinct impression that he wishes he didn’t have to be the bearer of this particular piece of news.
“I was about to make a pot,” she insists, and as if to confirm it, a kettle begins to whistle in the kitchen.
“Good.”
Still, he hasn’t gone this long without sleep since Purgatory, and that’s not something he wants to think about. The last thing he needs is for his internal organs to give out halfway through saving the world because he didn’t bother to catch four hours of shut eye when he had the chance.
“D’you want to head to the arcade?” he asks after a few minutes, and Castiel looks over to see him with his hands in his pockets.
“Don’t worry,” he says, turning to head down the path. “I kept the best one to myself.”
“Sorry I took so long,” Dean says.
The leather is warm and soft, and it fits Dean better than he expected. Standing, he moves to look in the mirror, only to find it isn’t where he thought it was. The corner where it stood beside the small window is completely empty, and he glances around to find the mirror standing on the other side of the attic.
He slipped his phone from his pocket and thumbed the screen.
. Cas has been gone for—
It’s pointless to argue, or to ask for any kind of logical reason as to why these people should even pose a threat in the first place without feeding into his dad’s delusions, so Dean does as he’s told.
As far as law enforcement is concerned, he’s probably no more entitled to be included in the debrief than any other old school friend of Dean’s. Part of him is almost glad of it. The less detail he’s forced to hear in detached, clinical terms, the better.
“You wanted time away. I forgot. I shouldn’t have called.”
“Dean?” Castiel finally asks. “What year did you think it was?”
“Eight hours. I’m not
Castiel stares out the window at the squat brick building that hasn’t been updated since the mid-seventies, and he feels
“Are you saying I’m too weak to carry you?” Castiel asks with a raised brow, but there’s an amused tilt to his mouth. “I’ll have you know I’m in excellent shape.”
“He was deceiving us, Dean. If I hadn’t killed him—”
As Dean takes a trembling breath, opening his mouth to speak, Castiel flexes his body around him. Clenches down to hold him inside as his hands skip reverently up Dean's sides, over his sweat damp skin.
“Traffic cameras are easy. They’re almost never password protected, so once you’ve done one, you can do ‘em all. Private security, though? In a place full of lions and monkeys and boa constrictors? No way am I breaking into that without setting off some alarms.”
If Dean argues with him about it, he’ll just point out that staying in a nicer motel will mean he doesn’t have to “waste” his grace healing the back pain inevitably caused by sleeping on an ancient box spring.
“It’s hard to say,” Castiel hedges.
It’s unusual for Castiel to spend an extended amount of time alone with Sam.
“I will, Mary.”
Hannah’s house looks a little tidier this time. The overgrown front yard has been wrangled into something more closely resembling a garden, and the bird bath is filled with water. A blue jay is splashing around in it as Dean approaches.
“Give me a word.”
There are a few things scattered around. A coffee mug on the desk—the one with the chipped lip that Cas has always favored for some unknowable reason. The keys to Cas’ truck. A heavy, wildly inaccurate book of angel lore that he’d taken to editing in the margins whenever they found themselves with a rare day of downtime. A stack of other lore books, ones he’d been using to try and find a solution to the mess that was currently falling down around them. A couple of the pens he liked to use—not ballpoints, but some with soft tips and gel ink that he insisted were less damaging to the paper. His spare angel blade. A small, sand-colored rock.
“Do I even want to know?”
“Dean, I couldn’t--”
Sam takes a half step toward him, bewildered but still desperate to help, and Dean makes a sound of abject terror. Castiel catches hold of Sam’s arm to keep him from getting any closer.
“You should get some rest, too,” he says.
The scars left by wounds that Dean hadn’t allowed him to heal; his bruised knuckles; the delicate skin of his wrists and his inner thighs; his muscled arms and soft stomach; the freckles on his chest, still visible through the flush that’s spread there. Every inch of him is a masterpiece, and for the first time since he pulled him from Hell, Castiel doesn’t feel the need to disguise his captivation.
. The spell will wear off naturally after twenty-four hours. They won’t even need to lock the door to keep them here.
“You want me to grab you a bag for all that?” he gestures at the books.
“This kind of trauma is… difficult to map. Being held hostage for that long by someone you’ve trusted from birth makes the brain do funny things. He’s rationalized a lot of irrational behaviour because it makes more sense that way, makes it easier to bear. He seems frustrated with himself, though, for giving John’s delusions any kind of weight. That’s a good sign.”
“Flying more frequently?”
Castiel knows that Dean wants to be chased. He keeps leaving clues behind. Little messages that mean nothing to anyone else, but everything to Castiel. Like he’s trying to make sure that no matter what, no matter how far he’s strayed from who he once was, that Castiel hasn’t lost faith in him. He knows that Dean wants Castiel to catch him, at least for long enough to get a few barbs in. He’s seen it in the way Dean grins whenever they’ve found themselves in the same place. Whenever they’ve spoken. He comes to life when Castiel confronts him; something in him lights up and flashes like fireworks under all that smoke.
“The police who found Dean were responding to reports of an assault on a group of teenagers who’d broken into the abandoned farmhouse. When they arrived, they found John pinning one of them in the living room and threatening him at knifepoint. They were left with no choice but to shoot, and he passed shortly after.”
Over the years they’ve known one another, on the occasions that he’s allowed himself to think of Dean in this way, when he’s imagined some scenario in which they might finally come together, he’s always expected that their first time together would be fast and frantic and messy; that they’d fall together without thinking. That it would happen in the heat of some life-or-death moment.
He’s so transfixed by his rapidly spiralling thoughts that he almost misses what Cas is telling him. Almost.
Sucking in a breath, Dean sits up straighter and stares, waits, feels the lump in his throat growing sharper, hotter, more suffocating, until finally, the dots disappear. No message comes.
“Love you too, sweetheart,” Dean says, and while the words are delivered with humor, the truth of them is clear in the way Dean’s soul opens up, reaching out to brush against him like a wordless prayer. It’s warm and sweet and grateful. Castiel smiles, and Dean smiles back.
and pictures Cas trying and failing to glare at him over a book in the library while Dean had ignored his own study in favor of listening to his Walkman and prodding Cas’ knee under the table with the toe of his boot. He loses himself in the memory until a sudden burst of laughter from the people downstairs has John tensing and shifting his grip on the shotgun, finger hovering far too close to the trigger for Dean’s sanity to remain intact. The throbbing vein in his temple is visible even from two yards away.
John cries as he does it, like it’s hurting him as much as it’s hurting Dean. He cries, and he apologizes, but he doesn’t stop.
“Today,” Dean nods, and his voice is razor sharp. “He told me today.”
Dean slips his hand over Castiel’s wrist and down to his fingers, squeezing them, encouraging Castiel to grip his hair the way he wants to. It’s only a moment before he does, and Dean ducks back down to trace kisses across his hips, to tease at his waistband. When he sinks lower still to mouth at Castiel through thin cotton, Castiel gasps and tugs at Dean’s hair.
“I know I hurt him. His reaction to seeing me made that perfectly clear. But, Sam… I think you’re overestimating how much he wants me around.”
“Hello, Dean,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I thought it might be easier to track Kelly if we were a little more spread out,” he lies, hoping that it will be enough to stop him asking for more details.

Dean’s initial plan had been to loan some of his own clothes to Castiel—an endeavor which he’d approached with a level of giddy excitement that Castiel has yet to fully unravel the reasons behind.
Dean snorts.
see the way his soul is pulled in tight, like an animal trying to hide. It’s not wonder Castiel hasn’t felt him reaching out since that one brief instance earlier in the evening—Dean’s tamping down on feeling anything at all, deliberately repressing every emotion in what Castiel can only assume is an attempt to keep him from being hurt.

“They seem good together.”
is an endless Spring day, painting at his mother’s side as a little kid; swirling rainbows of poster paint over enormous sheets of paper while she worked with acrylics on canvas and sang along to the crackling record.
“I mean, it’s not a lot to go on,” Sam admits. “But if I can find a plane with nose art that matches the back, I should be able to pull up crew records to track down a Novak.”
Of course.
With a satisfied quirk to his lips, Castiel opens the bag he’d been carrying and hands Dean an army-green canteen while he unpacks the food. A glass dish of lasagne, and something wrapped in a kitchen towel that Dean’s nose tells him is garlic bread.
“Sure you’re gonna be okay?” Bobby asks.
It’s the first time he’s actually said it in so many words, and Castiel knows it doesn’t come easily. He chooses not to draw attention to it.
“I, uh…”
Jack’s chin quivers as he tries to hold back tears, but though he looks devastated, the overriding emotion on his face is fear. It only takes a few seconds for Dean to figure out why.
“What other bit?”
“No,” Dean says quickly.
For some reason, Cas seems to think that Dean is worth the trouble. Worth the wait. Cas loves him. He’s everything Dean never thought he deserved, but Dean’s starting to realize that maybe that’s not something he gets to decide for himself.
He holds out his hand, expectant, and now that he’s close and actually looking Castiel in the eye, it’s impossible to miss the emotion in them. He looks scared but intent, as though he’s reached the same breaking point as Castiel and is determined to talk about what happened before either of them lose their nerve.
“Thank you.”
“But now you’re tired.”
Castiel wants to tell Dean about the pride he feels in this moment, but he holds back. They’ve barely even started. There’ll be time.
It seems to take a lot of effort for Dean to force his eyes to focus, and when he finally does, he looks from Castiel to his groin and back again, as if he’s insane for asking the question. At his sides, his fingers grip the bedroll like it’s the only thing keeping him from lifting off the floor.
It doesn’t take long for them to realize that Sam isn’t home. The bunker is silent, and as they make their way through room after empty room, Castiel finds that he is equal parts relieved and disappointed. This only means that their current predicament is getting drawn out.
_______
“What did you do?”
“Try me.”
All but Johnson, Devereux and Turner have been together since they left US soil. For a year, these men have been Castiel’s only companions. He thinks of them as brothers.
Lying back down beside him, Castiel waits for some signal, for some hint as to what he should do. Dean’s tendency to push people away when he’s hurting is one that Castiel is all too familiar with, and the thought that he might do it now is one that Castiel can’t stand. He’s relieved when Dean lowers his hands to look at him. The relief only lasts until he sees the expression on his face; his tense jaw, tilted brow, the unmistakable brightness of unshed tears.
Sam’s voice is distant, muffled, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s somehow answered a call without meaning to. But his phone is dark when he manages to focus on it, and when he taps the screen it only tells him he has dozens of missed calls spanning over the past several hours. Hours.
It’s not until they’ve stepped into the apartment and locked the door that he does.
He stops walking, and Dean does too.
He zones out a little as he’s watching the family take their seats, and after a moment the father notices him staring. He frowns, not-so-subtly lifting his shoulders, and Castiel looks sharply away to focus on his cup of what is, at this point, basically syrup. He knows he shouldn’t stare. Dean has told him countless times, as has Claire. Even Sam has mentioned it once or twice.
“I waited six centuries to tell Ophaniel the truth, and I’ve regretted all that wasted time since the day he left. It’s far better to know. Don’t be as foolish as I was.”
“Cas!” Dean wheezes, spitting lake water as he scrambles for the branch to haul himself back up. “What are you—”
Dean doesn’t answer right away; just reaches over, pushing at Castiel’s chin with two fingers until he’s facing the road again. Castiel knocks his hand away and waits.
Carefully, Dean dabs the ointment onto the worst areas of Castiel’s stomach, his fingers gentle as he uses tape to fix a square bandage over it. He doesn’t get up right away when he’s done, taking a moment to trail his fingers over Castiel’s skin. The touch is undemanding, and Castiel is certain that Dean is merely aiming for comfort—his own, and Castiel’s, in equal measure. Proving to himself that Castiel is alive and warm beneath his hands; proving to Castiel that Dean is here for him.
“Bullshit. You flinched.”
Dean snorts and glances over at him.
“Do you?”
“Well, it gave me time to prepare all this, so don’t feel too bad about it.” From the bottom of the bag, Castiel produces a couple of plates and some silverware. “Let’s eat.”
Chuck may have tried to convince them all that he was doing the best he could, that he just wanted them to try, to strive for their own happiness, to make it on their own, but—
But now—
Castiel smiles. “Well put.”
“Sorry,” he says.

“Already got one that’ll work.” Looking down at him, Dean pushes Castiel’s hair back from his forehead, fingernails lightly scratching at his scalp. Castiel’s eyes sink shut of their own accord. “You’re too messy to look like an agent right now, anyway.”
“You could have told me you did,” Castiel points out. “I wouldn’t have any way of knowing.”
Just Dean. We’re on a hunt. 🗡 I changed my clothes because we are trying to “blend in”.
Castiel has been dreading this part, if he’s being honest.
Dean starts hoarding receipts whenever he finds them.
“Are you suggesting that I’m a bad driver?”
“Yeah,” Castiel agrees, and clears his throat. “Anyway, Balthazar’s not
Charlie gives him a doubtful look, humming something that sounds suspiciously like Kenny Loggins
The next two files are both black and white photos of Angel Eyes, one from each side. The first just shows curling script like that on the back of the flight jacket Dean’s still holding on his lap, and the second shows a dark-haired pin-up girl, angelic wings sprouting from her shoulders as she raises her fists and glares as if to say, bring it, you bastards.
until it takes him somewhere else. Until he’s only registering John’s sobs as a sort of distant white noise, until he feels the liquid fire of the blade slicing through his skin as something terrible that’s happening to someone else, something that hurts in a way that’s separate from himself. He lets the spots in his vision take over. Lets them shift in front of his eyes like dappled sunlight through the oak tree in his backyard, when he and Cas would flop onto the grass in the summer to talk and read and listen to the radio while Sam ran through the sprinkler like an overexcited labrador.
“I’m not sure why, but healing even the most minor injuries has been becoming more and more difficult lately,” Castiel’s voice is hesitant,  like he’s sorry to be the bearer of more bad news, and it only makes Dean angrier. “Even fixing Hank’s thumb last night was almost too much. It’s as though my grace is—”
Castiel sighs, smoke flowing out of his mouth and curling up toward the sky. He pulls the cigarette out of his mouth, eyes it morosely for a moment, and presses it out against the fire escape. Dean raises his brow.

Peeking his head into Sam’s room, Dean confirms that his sneakers are missing, along with his headphones.
“Alright.”
They have to be.
Abruptly, John’s lips stop moving, and he turns his head to look at Dean. There’s blood splattered on his jaw, on the collar of his gray work shirt, and Dean doesn’t know whose it is. His eyes are frantic. This man may be John Winchester, but he’s not Dean’s dad. Not anymore.
He also sees that in the eyes of the djinn, by entering this union, he will replace Ophaniel as her consort—it seems that the union is more like a marriage than anything else—but though Ruqayya did not mention this fact to him, he suspects that this omission has more to do with her own lingering grief over the loss than anything nefarious.
“Y’know, when I asked what you were grinning at, I figured you’d drop some weird fact about rabbits, or… I dunno. What was that old joke you found? The one about Caesar?”
Even a few years ago, the idea that he should have an opinion on something as human as the intangible truth of knowing you’re home would have struck him as utterly absurd. Now, he finds he doesn’t care, so long as he can feel it.  So long as he can let it wrap around him and settle the restless feeling in his chest at moments like this one, when he’s anticipating a difficult conversation with someone he loves.
“What if she doesn’t know anything?” Castiel asks, staring at the ground. “What if she can’t--”
“But?”
But he misses driving his own truck.
,” he insists.
might be the police.
, he wants to be good.
If he tries, really tries, he can almost convince himself that the man he saw was Castiel’s grandson. But there’s not a trace of another ladder in the attic, and the mirror is back where he’d thought it was. Dean’s leg is still dripping wet from the vase that spilled all over it. A pale purple rose petal is clinging to the water on his boot. The chances of this being an elaborate set up diminish to almost nothing, but he’s got to rule it out completely before he really lets himself panic.
“Not last time I checked.”
He feels sick. Like there’s something toxic rolling in his chest, clawing in the pit of his gut, slowly killing him.
“I’m not gonna give up. That’s what I’m doing,” he says, checking over his work to make sure that not a single shell is loose. “I’m not gonna just sit here and wait for the walls to come down.”
When Dean rushes into the garage a few seconds later, Castiel meets his panicked eyes and reminds himself that home is not confined to this place, even if he’d like it to be.
The bell over the door tinkles again, merry and bright where before it had seemed shrill and piercing. Castiel doesn’t hate it anymore.
It’s Stevie, according to the caller ID. Dean stares at the screen until it stops flashing at him, then keeps staring until it pings with a voicemail alert.
- I’m in the process of posting The Coda Project, in which I write a coda or missing scene for every single episode of Supernatural from the pilot to the finale. I’ve only posted the first two so far, so it’s going to be a while before it starts showing up in the Dean/Cas tag, but it’s here if you’re interested: https://archiveofourown.org/series/2378884
“Dean,” he says, looking up him where he still leans against the counter. “This is...”
Sam glances over his shoulder at the door, then back at Castiel. There’s only pity in his gaze, now.
More than that, he has to help him. If going back is what Castiel truly wants, even if that means never seeing Dean again, Dean has to respect that. He can’t try to talk him out of it. Can’t try to convince him to stay.
,” he’d told Dean as he dragged him out of the house, smearing blood along his arm as Dean twisted in his grip, desperate to get back inside, to get Sam out before the fire could spread, to make sure Cas didn’t get hurt trying to help him, to try to wake his mom up, somehow, somehow, because
, asshole. You just spend so much time acting like a human that I get used to treating you like one. And it’s not like I’ve ever seen what’s hiding under the trenchcoat.”
He’s not sure why the lie fell so easily from his tongue, but the thought of Dean rushing back out of pity makes him crumple inward. He’d rather spend the next few months as he has spent the last than feel like an obligation. He gives Dean what he hopes seems like an easy smile, and Dean looks away, embarrassed.
“What?”

Castiel blinks, slightly dazed. Dean just looks down at him and winks.
“Idiot,” he says.
“Yeah okay, reign it in, Casanova.”
Nobody has
“Well, did he have any money?”
Once they’re out of sight, he opens his senses to the ether, and feels Tree of Life almost immediately.
“This position is not worthy of a Knight!” Garth exclaims, scandalized, and Dean groans.
“Yes.”
“I could… distr
The slow roll of their hips against one another, the helpless gasps that Dean steals from Cas’ mouth as he wrestles his trench coat free—none of it feels like the first time they’ve been together like this. It’s as though these are all things that belong to them, that have always belonged to them. The fact that they have them now is nothing more than a long-awaited return to their natural state of being.
Pressing against him, Dean maneuvers Castiel until his back is to the wall and breaks away to press his lips against his throat, his jaw, the shell of his ear.
“Is he alright?”
“You could stay. Don’t have to worry about getting back to me--to us, I mean. Don’t have to worry about getting back if you don’t leave in the first place.”
He doesn’t speak much during the call. Just makes the occasional sound of understanding as Sam instructs him.
He hesitates, then nods stiffly, stepping aside and pulling the door open for them.
“These little what?”
“Yes.”

Daniel had reminded him of that when he’d asked to borrow it—
It’s getting close to closing time when Dean puts the finishing touches on the last prospective design for Charlie to take to her late night LARP planning session, and lets out another explosive yawn.
theme echoing down the hall from Sam’s room.
Picking up a handful of loose limestone fragments from the lakeside, he takes his time tossing them out over the water, one by one.
They’ve been talking for hours, listening to record after record, when Castiel’s stomach rumbles. He glances up at the clock on the wall. It’s a little after ten o’clock.
“Am I?”
“Yes.”
Castiel didn’t stay long after that. The purpose of his silent visits was purely to ensure that they were safe, after all, and once he’d determined that they were, and that the subtle protective warding he’d placed around their home was still working, there was no need for him to remain.
Turning in his hold, Castiel drapes his arms around Dean’s shoulders and kisses him how he should have before. Deeply. Hungrily. He nips at his lower lip, tugging it between his teeth, and Dean groans under his breath. The sound makes Castiel feel powerful. More confident, suddenly, than he ever thought he’d be in this situation.
“The bodies,” Dean repeats, slow, still a little off-kilter, and then his brain kicks back into drive. Right. Ghost-Gacy’s victims. The teenage girls Cas mentioned finding in a blood-splattered bedroom. The Sheriff, whose heart Belphegor had ripped right out of his chest while Dean watched in muted horror from six feet away. He’s still not sure how the hell they’re going to make
Dean gives him a helpless shrug.
It’s not until he has it in his hands that he pauses for a breath and comes to a decision.
“Okay?” he says.
Dean stares at him. Castiel stares back.
“I don’t yet.”
It takes almost a whole minute before the door cracks open, and the man who greets them through the narrow gap is visibly exhausted. His one visible eye is bloodshot from a lack of sleep; his skin oily at his hairline and his stubble unkempt.
“What did Jody want?” Dean asks before Sam can say anything, and Castiel moves to help him with the compressor. “Thanks, Cas.”
“I walked normally,” Castiel replies with a frown.
Sam’s got his concerned face on when he sits down beside Dean, and Dean can’t bring himself to face him for more than a glance. He keeps loading shells. Directs his response to the crypt, to the dark, to the cosmic peeping Tom whose entire existence seems focused on screwing with them.
“That,” Castiel says, “is a bluebird.”
“I want to kiss you until it stops being novel,” he says with a shaky grin, “and then I want to kiss you again.”
“No! I mean, yes, I’d definitely like for you to come back. Just... perhaps you should try to limit your travels to the attic. Less chance of embarrassing either one of us that way.”
He’s so scared he’s sweating, clearly paranoid that whoever was here earlier is coming back. They’re not going to get anywhere with him like this.
“What now?” he asks when they separate. Dean rubs the back of his neck, chewing his lip as he thinks it over.
“Thank you,” he says instead, enthralled by the way that even the smallest measure of approval makes Dean’s soul hum under his skin like music as Castiel moves to kneel between his parted knees. Once he’s there, he waits. Keeps his hands to himself and holds Dean’s gaze until he squirms and reaches for him. “Stay still, Dean. Be patient.”
And Dean nearly killed him for it.
Lifting her brow, Charlie grabs him by the collar and drags him to the bathroom. She positions him in front of the mirror and prods at his cheek.
“Hate this jacket,” he gasps, and Dean laughs, breathless and beautiful against his lips.
“So, I was right about him flying a B-17. His name was Lieutenant Castiel Novak, and Angel Eyes was one of the B-17’s involved in the Warsaw Airlift. It was one of three that went down.”
“It’s gone. It was destroyed.”
hey, do me a favor?
“I dunno,” Dean says, pushing himself off the ground fully and swinging back out of Castiel’s line of sight. He appears again a moment later, skidding his boots over the the sand below. “I mean, I know he’d be a good boss, and he’s already taught me a ton, but isn’t it, like… I dunno. Cheating?”
From here, he can see two-thirds of its corrugated iron door beyond the yard’s scattered handful of trees. Beside it, the chain they’d cut through to get inside is coiled on the muddy ground like an iron snake.
“We could, uh… get a room?” He asks, voice hesitant as though there’s any chance at all that Castiel would refuse. It’s only a split second before he seems to play back the phrase in his head, and he burns red to the tips of his ears. “Not that we— I just figured, it’s late. We could just hang out, or talk, or—“
The fast subject change is a little too evasive for Dean’s liking, but he’s too focused on the jacket to latch on right now. He saves the topic for later.
Sam’s snoring in the first room he glances into, his long legs contorted awkwardly to fit onto the folding cot he’s set up beside the window. The handle of his demon knife is just visible under the thin pillow, Sam’s hand wrapped tightly around it even in sleep. Closer to the door, Belphegor is sitting cross-legged on another cot. His head is tilted back against the wall, and though it’s impossible to tell  for certain given the state of his eyes, Dean’s pretty sure that he hasn’t been seen. On the floor beneath the cot, Dean can make out the distinct shape of a devil’s trap.
It doesn’t take long to find it. It’s coiled like a spring at one end, with a plug designed to fit into the cigarette lighter. Dean could cry when it fits easily into the base of the phone. Finding a moment to charge it without John seeing him might not be easy, but if he can manage to keep it hidden for long enough, he might be able to—
He’s still wearing his pincushion wristband, and he works a needle free, pulling out the thin strand of black cotton still threaded through the eye and exchanging it for the red thread that hangs free.
John lets out a desperate sob of a sound that makes Dean’s skin prickle all over.
,” he sighs after a moment. “You’re right. It’s our best option, and as much as I don’t wanna ask him, I bet Sam could walk me through it.”
, of all people, really going to make fun of me for appreciating my car?”
It only takes a few minutes for them to emerge onto the main road, and when they do, when Dean sees the mess of empty cars with their engines still running, the delivery van with its hood buried in the side of the white house on the corner, the bicycle overturned on the gravel on the shoulder, the enormity of everything hits him anew.
“What’s wrong?”
Dean stares down at it and feels his whole body ache.
“And cambion.”
But the vacation was over too soon. Dean and Sam went home to Kansas with their parents, and before he knew it, Dean was fifteen and working after school at his father’s auto shop.
“Oh… well, uh…”
Castiel’s head fills with buzzing white noise, and he misses whatever Bobby says next. For an interminable amount of time, he barely even registers Bobby’s voice. He comes back to himself as Bobby takes off his hat to rub at his short hair.
“A king, thank you.”
Dean’s head bobs slightly in a nod, and though he’s still staring at Castiel, his eyes sink closed a few times.
“Why?”
“No.”
“So you only came back to say goodbye,” Castiel says, his eyes stinging, a lump in his throat, and Dean stares back at him, stricken.
“Well, yeah, sometimes, but so’s everyone. What did you just work out?”
“You are what you eat.”
“One night,” he confirms.
“You’ve wanted to ditch your folks for years, Cas.”
If Dean knows anything about Charlie’s use of a pointed eyebrow-arch, it’s not a request. Wearily, he trudges after her into the royal tent. She’s got her arms crossed when he steps inside.
“Perfect,” Castiel gasps out, hips lifting involuntarily as if chasing Dean’s hand. “Nobody ever... I haven’t...”
“Then I’ll come get you first thing tomorrow morning,” Castiel says after a moment.
, Cas. What are you--”
“Your lips, your hands, your eyes,” Castiel says, and Dean’s cheeks grow pink.
“Okay, so maybe crossing on the log was a terrible idea,” Dean admits.
“A little less than a year.”
“You wanna answer on speaker?”
Castiel leaves Dean to take care of the cooking—
Castiel knows the second he spots something. Dean has never been good at hiding his excitement, and the way his whole body perks up is almost comical.
“It matters.”
“What?”
“Just checking in,” Sam says, watching them with a frown. “You going somewhere, Cas?”
“I was planning to make something to eat after I showered, but I completely forgot.”
,” Dean says, but there’s a strange tremor in his voice that makes Cas worry that he’s not as amused by the thought as he’s pretending to be. That he heard the truth in the statement, and is disturbed by it. Cas gulps.
Dean starts giggling at that, breathless little gasps as his eyes water.
“This pastry is from Georgio’s,” she says after a moment, and narrows her eyes. “You
“Something you’ll like.”
“Anyway, I figure we should go first thing, maybe try and catch something for lunch,” Dean says, stretching his arms up over his head before looking over at Castiel. “Speaking of food…”
If, by some miracle, John never starts to see demons crawling underneath Dean’s skin, and Dean survives, and makes it back to Wichita… he can’t imagine ever sleeping soundly at night. Can’t imagine ever trusting anybody.
The clerk laughs, expression clearing.
Not with his head so messed up, not with more booze than blood in his system. He needs to plan, needs to figure this out, to make sure that he doesn’t leave anything up to chance. Not again.
He borrowed the tent from his older brother Daniel, and it’s an ancient thing from the Army surplus store. The green canvas is patched in multiple places with thick strips of brown tape, and the one time Castiel had gone camping with his brother about two years ago, getting it to stand upright had resulted in one of the worst arguments they’d ever had.
“Get out of here before I change my mind,” she says, stepping back from the car. “Castiel, I’m sure I don’t have to tell you to drive safe, but—”
“That’s a lovely thought,” he says instead, and she beams.
How many times has Chuck made him act out a more dramatic plot line? Which losses were truly his own? Which victories? Which mistakes can he wholly take the blame for?
. He’s still here. Or, y’know. Not here, but
“It was— Billie was—”
“Seriously. If anyone asks what we’re up to back here, we’ll just tell them we’re trying to score some weed.”
Closer, he can see lines around her eyes. Fine wisps of silvery hair emerge from beneath her hijab. She’s ancient, he realizes. An alpha. A queen.
He can’t wear this.
“That was the whole reason you went back, you jackass,” he mutters to himself, typing a brief
“The—” his throat seizes again, and he swallows hard, forces the words out past the sour taste still lingering in his mouth. “It was the Empty.”
Across the street, the football field is bustling with activity. A fair, presumably celebrating the approaching New Year, has attracted what Cas assumes is most of the town’s population. He watches them for a while; the families, the groups of friends. All laughing and joking, children shrieking as they chase one another around and get under their parents feet as the sun slowly sinks.
Where his hand had been, the notches he’d carved into the wood stand out, and he blinks at them in a daze when he realizes that he’s carved more lines than he thought. Seventeen days. Not fourteen. He doesn’t remember carving them. The water jug he’d been so careful to monitor is lying empty on its side at the base of the stairs, and the wrappers of his last protein bars are scrunched up beside it.
“I guess?” Dean bites at the inside of his cheek. “I’m kinda used to people just… assuming. Bossing me around without asking. Shoulda known that you’d want to check in first.”
?” Hannah asks, finally finding her voice as she touches a fingertip to a pin on the collar of Castiel’s jacket.
Because he hates what he does and what it does to him. Wishes he could
“No,” Dean says quickly, his expression panic-stricken as his grip tightens around Castiel’s hand. “Just— don’t—”
“It’s fine, Cas. I’ll just… I’ll put the jacket back on, make sure we’re touching, and that should--”
They might have power for light, but the only heater in the house is a disconnected gas furnace in the living room upstairs.
Dean doesn’t really need to answer. It’s been a month--longer now since Cas left than Dean actually knew the guy--but he still feels his absence at every turn. He sinks down onto the plush velvet footstool by the tent door.
With a small smile, he adds another packet of sugar to his mug, and looks up as the bell over the door chimes again. Another stranger. This time, it’s a harried-looking young father, two small children hanging onto his legs as he shuffles across the diner’s checkerboard floor.
“That’s some Disney princess shit, Cas.”
Castiel widens his eyes.
Dean seems unconvinced, and Castiel kneels on the bed behind him, unsure whether or not it would be wise to touch him or leave him alone. In the end, he stops trying to guess.
Silently, Sam and Jack follow.
Along with Jerry, Hank volunteers to stand guard at the warehouse until they can figure out what to do about the dead civilians.
Another part wonders if they’re even real, or just background players in Chuck’s elaborate pulp fiction saga, no more consequential than the obliviously cheerful birds singing in the trees that line the football field.
“Ohh, that’s good,” he says.
When Dean sighs his name into the scant space between them, once, twice, three times in a row, Castiel pulls back a little to meet his eye.
In tiny increments, Dean fell in love with the place. The smell of warm cotton, the feeling of soft velvet, the rhythmic hum of the sewing machine; all fast became synonymous with happiness in his young mind.
“The woman who did this,” Castiel tells her, gesturing to the red circle stitched onto his jacket. “It’s the key to all of this.”
“Are those the eyebags of someone who should be operating a vehicle?”
“The missing World War Two pilot who’d be, like... ninety if he even turned up alive right now?
Dean grins, spreading his fingers against Castiel’s chest and pushing lightly as he takes the chips and water. He seems happy and carefree. Castiel hates to bring his mood down, but he knows he can’t avoid it. By the time he rounds the car and pulls open the driver’s side door, he’s decided that he simply needs to get it over with.
“Tie,” she says, and gestures until Castiel dutifully takes it from her, tying a knot in one end. She takes it back and sits down opposite him, carefully threading the thread through the eye of her needle.
Ben had been trying to convince Lisa to let him get a dog, and while Lisa had already been in the process of adopting one from a local shelter—Castiel had overheard a phone conversation about a Staffordshire bull terrier named Beanbag shortly before Ben had entered the room—she’d seemed set on pretending that it wasn’t going to happen. Preparing for a surprise, he’d assumed.
Castiel is tired and aching, and in this moment, he finds that he fervently misses the use of his wings. He wonders if lying about this is worth the effort when he knows it’s all going to come out tomorrow anyway. He decides against it. It’s not as though he’s betraying Dean’s confidence by simply confirming his own feelings, and he’d rather not lie to Sam more than he absolutely has to.
“I’m not.”
”Nice jacket, Novak,” he says.
Dean blinks, clearing his eyes, and looks at him properly.
But Cas leaves, and Dean is a coward. He doesn’t fight. Doesn’t follow. His throat twitches, and his heart thuds, and the bunker door closes softly, like Cas doesn’t even have the energy left to slam it.
They’ll talk, at last, and Dean will either tell him that he does not want to pursue the feelings that Castiel knows he has, or he’ll decide to take a chance. Castiel dearly hopes for the latter. He’s prepared for the former.
“He’s out of town,” Ellen explains. “Academic Decathlon regionals.”
“This was a
“It’s—Cas, it’s not that easy.”
It only took a few minutes in the garage for Dean’s mouth to run dry at the visceral memory of an IED ripping through his convoy on his last deployment before he came home. His head started spinning, and it wasn’t until he felt Bobby’s hands on his face that he realized he was sitting on the ground.
“Mm. Well, hopefully the next person I kiss will be a bit more exciting.”
“Okay. Cards on the table?”
"No," he says, and though his mouth is twisted into a smile his eyes are pained and helpless. "Not a fucking bit.”
“Hey, Cas.”
With a snort, Castiel glances at him again, and Dean points emphatically at the road ahead.
Dean huffs and shakes his head.
“What kind of injuries?” Bobby asks.
“Well, he always was just like our father. But even with the arguments, I always loved being out here. The trees, the river, the flowers… I used to think about this place when I first shipped out. When I had occasion to close my eyes, I’d think about coming back here and sitting in the sunshine. Watching the bees in spring.”
But deep in his chest, he can feel his anger bubbling up, waiting for an excuse to burst out in a toxic wave, and knows he’s too tired to fight it. Better to just keep quiet and hope Cas walks away without saying anything else.
Flopping back down onto his pillow, Castiel yawns widely and throws one arm out to the side in a stretch, the other scratching idly at his chest. The motion leaves his right hand on Dean’s sleep-warm pillow. Blearily, he gazes over it, and wishes for a version of reality where he might be able to feel that warmth first hand.
Coming to a stop beside the car, Dean looks down the road, thoughtful before he turns back to Castiel and unlocks the door.
“Shit, really? I’ll have to keep that in mind,” Dean glances down. “Uh, if you even want me to come back again, I mean.”
Castiel stares at him, expression carefully blank, and Dean realizes that it’s the first time he’s actually mentioned the year he’s from. The silence drags out for an uncomfortably long moment before Castiel looks away and nods.
Under his hands, he feels the muscles of Cas’ back flexing, and it’s not until he slides his palms around to rest on the slight curve of his pecs that he realizes he’s moved without asking. Cas doesn’t seem to have noticed, or if he has, he’s not complaining. Still, Dean doesn’t want to push his luck. He pulls his hands back over his head and grasps his own wrists.
“What do you mean?”
“I knew there wasn’t a lot of hope for someone like me,” he goes on. “But I was longing for a chance anyway. So I might not have been thinking of you, but I was thinking of someone. I suppose that was enough to act as a... a beacon for you.”
Sam looks warily at him, then glances back at Castiel in question.
“Right,” Dean says, taken aback. “Of course.”
“You want to sit?” Castiel asks, and Dean nods, pushing away from the bar and following him toward a booth on the wall. Castiel’s eyes look bright as he sips at his drink.
As they spear marshmallows on sticks and roast them over the flames, Castiel thinks he could quite happily spend the rest of his days here, just like this. Sitting with Dean in peaceful quiet, listening to the crackling fire and the distant chittering of nighttime birds.
“Guess,” he says, and Castiel’s chest aches.
“No, I don’t think I will.”
“Oh, um. She’s a World War II historian at the museum,” Sam says. “So what are you gonna do with the jacket?”
“Did they mention who was bringing her?”
He counts down as he falls, gropes around his chest with awkward fingers for his ripcord and yanks at it as soon as he gets to zero. His whole body jerks painfully when the chute opens, his teeth clicking hard together with the abrupt change in speed. The taste of blood fills his mouth, hot and tinny and vile how it mixes with the sour taste of fear that hasn’t faded.
“It’s recent,” Castiel nods, “but I don’t think they’re still here. We should stick to the original plan for now.”
“You know what. You keep saying shit like that. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it.”
It’s not what Dean expected. After the stress of the past two days, and the relief Castiel must be feeling after seeing Hannah, he’d anticipated something more like desperation. He'd thought Castiel would be demanding and loud, that he'd bite and scratch and chase his release until he caught it.
Dean swallows.
Castiel takes mercy on him, slowly withdrawing his grace again until it’s back to a dull hum. Dean lifts his hips off the ground with a groan, chasing the feeling even as he begs for it to stop.
“I came for fruit from the Tree of Life,” he says, loud enough that she will hear him.
“If it will help you,” Ruqayya cuts in, “I consent to you looking into my thoughts.”
The button of Dean’s jeans pops open easily, and Castiel works his hand inside, ignoring the way the fly digs into the back of his wrist so he can focus on the feeling of Dean’s heated skin beneath his fingers. He grazes over the head, wet with Dean’s arousal, and Dean’s whole body shudders at the sensation.
Even if Castiel couldn’t hear Sam’s side of the conversation, he’d be able to tell how tense it is. There’s none of the brothers usual ribbing, nothing friendly, nothing familiar. Just the dry exchange of
, he thinks to himself as he waits for Sam to get behind the wheel. If he’s being honest with himself, he needs it, to find the right words, the right approach.
And the thing is--it’s fair. Cas shouldn't have to be the one to reach out. Dean’s the one who screwed everything up. Dean’s the one who has to fix it. Dean's the one who has to try.
Castiel doesn’t know what to say, so he just adjusts his hands on the wheel and nods.
he was interested. And he knew he could tell me because…” Castiel trails off, remembering the party, how utterly oblivious he’d been to everything else going on because he was so transfixed on Dean. How easily Balthazar had clocked him. “Well. Because I slipped up, to be honest.”
“Yes, I thought I’d made that clear by now.”
“Is that not what it’s called?”
“Using the resources and connections available to you isn’t cheating unless you’d be wildly under qualified without them.”
Dean stops laughing.
Dean mouths back.
“What can I say?” Dean wriggles his brows. “You’d look real nice bent over the hood, getting your hands dirty.”
“Nice digs,” he says, heading for the bathroom. “Remind me to let you pick the motel more often.”
“I don’t know yet. But it’s not going to be safe here for long. They’ll find us.”
He stumbles over his words in a way that Castiel has never seen him do. It makes him unbearably nervous, and he talks around the point in the hope that it will be enough.
Castiel is relieved that his blush will have faded before Dean gets back.
he thinks, again and again, but the thought is getting dimmer. Quieter. Less plausible.
“Tired,” Ellen says as Bobby frowns and scratches at his beard. “He was just starting to drift off… you should head in before he falls asleep.”
Hannah tilts her head to get a closer look.
There’s a note weighed down by Dean’s spare key on the kitchen table, reminding him that Dean has a couple of clients today since he had to move them from yesterday, and sitting underneath it is a weathered local map and a fifty dollar bill.
“Can I get you anything else?” she asks.
“How many other people named Balthazar do you know?”
Dean’s not sure if Castiel is saying it to insult the song, or if he’s just genuinely confused, so he nods.
“Okay. I’ll aim to get there by nine,” he says. “Tell them for me?”
is Cas singing along with him from inside their tent at Tuttle Creek Lake, while Dean tried to balance keeping his own voice quiet enough to listen, but still loud enough that Cas wouldn’t realize he could be heard.
“Oh.”
“Thanks for letting them leave early,” Castiel tells him.
—and he’s given up on trying. He figures it doesn’t matter anymore, anyway.
, he doesn’t say, but he’s sure they hear it. He suspects they feel the same way.
“I, uh— I’m—”
“God,” Ellen murmurs under her breath. “Is he— he didn’t hurt anyone, did he?”
“Thinkin’ about sunflowers again?” Dean asks quietly, covering his cellphone as he speaks. Castiel laughs and lifts one shoulder.
Sam stops in the doorway, and Castiel nudges him gently, encouraging him to step forward and hoping he won’t have the same reaction that Castiel had himself yesterday. The guilt still lingers. He suspects it will linger for some time.
It was all a manipulation, in the end.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
“About telling me.”
“Well met, Sir Dean,” the guard says, bowing as he approaches.
Dean’s mouth is bone dry, and his head pounds, and he itches all over. His hands are flaking, the skin of his scarred arms tight and sore. He spares a look at the sink in the corner. At the drain and the bucket he hasn’t had to use in days.
“Something like that,” Sam replies, and he sounds so excited that Dean can’t even bring himself to make fun of him.
Dean eyes the books with more than a hint of bewilderment.
It's not the antichrist, that's something quite different.
“If this is supposed to be a joke, I’m failing to see the humor.”
By the time he locates and saves copies of all the folders they need—eight containing footage from inside the animal hospital, and half a dozen more from the zoo’s parking lots—it’s twenty minutes to closing time, and the zoo has started to clear out.
“So I’ll bet you’ll appreciate the bath that’s waiting for you. Go relax, okay? I’ll bring you some coffee.”
Sighing, he resigns himself to doing what has to be done and looks back at Rowena.
“You are American?” the man asks, his Polish accent distinct and thick. When Castiel nods the man’s posture relaxes a little. Castiel finds himself doing the same. “You are hurt.”
The hope he’d felt before, the certainty that they’d both survived, has all but evaporated.
“Well?”
“Still too long,” Castiel argues, and Dean makes a small sound of agreement, or need, or something else, and Castiel can’t stop himself from answering it. He kisses him, hard, as though their lips pressed together now will be enough to rid them of the hours, the years of longing that they’ve endured.
, but his muscles stay tense all the same. He knows better, but some days, the demons feel a whole lot more real than they should.
It’s insulting, is what it is, but Dean doesn’t rise to the bait. He puts his hand out, palm up.
Pulling into his usual space in the bunker’s garage a little while later, Castiel feels coiled tight as a spring.
Cas sighs his name, and Dean’s heart feels full to bursting.
“Demons. They’re in the water. That’s how they took—“ John’s voice cracks, and he shifts his hands on the wheel. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the blood that stains his cuffs. There’s dirt under his fingernails that Dean didn’t notice before, and he doesn’t know where it’s from. “You don’t let any water touch you, okay? Promise me.”
Henriksen frowns.
“Steak,” Dean says.
“You prayed to me. Just now, I—” Cas pauses, lets his gaze drop down Dean’s body before sliding back up. His fingers flex against Dean’s chest. “I felt it. I saw what you’re longing for.”
He shipped out to Iraq, and two tours of hell later he arrived back on his mother’s doorstep, freshly discharged and completely at a loss for what to do next.
“Of course,” Cas says.
“Dean?”
Looking up, watery-eyed, Sam smiles. It’s a small thing, full of gratitude, and Dean sends one back before tilting his head toward the hallway. He doesn’t need to give voice to the idea that they’ll reconvene later; Sam understands with a glance, and he nods in agreement. Dean squeezes his shoulder before he leaves him to his messages and his photos and his grief.
No, he tells himself firmly. That first letter Castiel wrote is proof enough that he wanted to be with Dean. The way Castiel looked at him when they kissed, when they slept together the night before he left. There’s no way that Castiel left because he didn’t want to stay.
“I don’t want to wait for midnight, either,” Cas tells him, and he only waits a moment before giving in, lifting his free hand to Dean’s side and pulling him close.
“No, no, I remember the way. We’ll be there soon. Thanks, Sergeant.”
“Mm.”
How he came to be stripped bare while Dean has not lost a stitch of clothing is both a mystery and a grave injustice, and he’s about to say as much when Dean’s fingers wrap back around him completely, and he loses his grasp of every conscious thought he’s ever had. He bucks forward on instinct, slipping through the circle of Dean’s fingers.
he? Who are any of them?
“Alright,” Castiel tells him, and lets Sam steer him into the passenger seat of his own truck.
SEARCH FOR MISSING LIEUTENANT CALLED OFF
“Honestly,” Dean starts, and stops, and takes another breath. “Honestly, I don’t think I can stand to work a case with him yet. He said some really messed up shit to me last night.
“Right. And even if they were,
“It doesn’t have to be over,” Castiel tells him. “We could get a drink?”
“Is that what we’re calling it these days?”
. Dean grins, and crowds into his space, and kisses him. Just like that.
“What are you waiting for?”
Maybe if some of their other friends were going be here, he’d have made a different choice. But he’s seen how Dean looks at Benny, and he doesn’t want to leave the two of them unattended.
Charlie lets out a heavy breath.
Sitting on a broken pillar, he looks at Ruqayya and considers what she’s told him.
“I told you, man. I read about you. Seemed like someone I would’ve been friends with.”
Castiel’s jaw shuts with a clack when they’re grazed by another shell, and ahead, three B-17’s are hit, one after the other in rapid succession. Two of them drop right out of the sky, and the other lists slowly to the side, trailing smoke.
’?” Dean asks, barely disguising the unease in his voice. Castiel slides the rest of his cake across the table toward him.
, and Dean’s eyes snap open, head jerking back to look toward the stairs so fast that his neck twinges with the movement, shooting pain down his spine and up into the base of his skull.
“Finding a molecules workaround. I bet I can track something down. I’ll make it my post-nephilim project.”
The sound he makes is embarrassing enough, but then Dean really
there?”
For the next twenty minutes, he describes in excruciating detail a series of events that never happened, and Sam--thankfully--has to meet someone before Dean is forced to think of another topic.
Right now, standing in an empty classroom at John C. Harlan High School and staring at some unknown English teacher’s list of extra credit reading assignments scrawled across the chalkboard, Dean thinks about
Narrowing his eyes, Castiel looks back at Dean and finds him beaming from ear-to-ear, clearly amused by his own smart-ass comments. It’s unfair, is what it is. Finding Dean endearing even when he’s being the biggest pain in the ass imaginable.
Jack’s hand settles on his back, between his shoulder blades. He’s hesitant about it, like he’s not sure what he’s supposed to do when someone is sick but knows he wants to help, and Dean can’t help but think of Cas. Of his compassion. His tenderness. His cluelessness in the early days, before he knew how to relate to humanity. Before Dean really knew him at all.
“Oh, okay,” Dean lifts his brow, and wonders if that’s why Sam’s suddenly such a huge Skype fan. “Well, there’s this other guy from the same flight crew as Castiel. I’m not sure about his name, other than that it starts with D, but I found a picture of them together. I’m pretty sure he’s the guy mentioned in the newspaper articles.”
“You sure dad doesn’t mind us borrowing his fishing stuff?” he asks.
Cas flips through the seven numbers, though he already knows who he’s going to call.
“Awesome,” Dean repeats, and gets to his feet. “But, uh… You mind giving me forty minutes? An hour? It’s already pretty warm in here, and I think I’ll melt in this get up if we’re outside for more than five minutes.”
“I dreamed of the last time you were here,” Castiel tells him over his glass, lifting it to his lips before he speaks again. “Over and over, a different ending each time. I thought it would stop after a few weeks, but… even tonight, I was dreaming of you.”
Days disappear in a never-ending cycle of shifting light and two-lane blacktop.
He can't hold it, though. Not for long. Sam is barely looking at him, but Dean knows that once he does, he'll see where the cracks are forming. So he leaves him alone, and heads for the library to fight the rising fear with the first bottle he can find.
Garage. Need to talk.
It’s only when Dean pulls his boots off and starts unbuttoning his jeans that Castiel is spurred back into action. He makes quick work of his own clothing and leaves it in an inelegant heap on the floor.
“I’d better go get some sleep,” he says.
Dean clears his throat, and when Castiel chances a look at him he’s rubbing the back of his neck.
“Your mother sewed this into jacket when she fixed it.”
He feels it, then—Dean is longing for him again, aching for him as though they’re miles apart instead of touching in half a dozen places—but this time Dean doesn’t cut it off. Instead, he seems to focus on it. His soul catches hold of the feeling and lets it grow, build, swell like a wall of sound and sensation before he pulls on it like a leash.
“Donna did make a good point about your recent imprisonment. It’s only been a couple of months since you and Sam escaped—shouldn’t we be worried about potentially drawing the attention of the people who captured you?”
“I have vegetables. But all these spices--Dean, you don’t know how much I’ve missed spices. And chocolate. And
“I’m fine,” he lies. The sense of loss he feels at the knowledge that it was nothing but fantasy is greater than he could have prepared for. Ruqayya rubs her palm over his back, comforting, and he wonders how he ever thought she was cold. “Did it work?”
“Fine,” Castiel says, and slides his hand up to Dean’s face, cupping his cheek and stroking his lips with his thumb. His heart swells when Dean presses a light kiss to it, then flops back against his pillow.
Every Zeppelin song is
“Not filling me with confidence, there, Dean.”
“I’m sure. Unless you’ve changed your mind about stopping somewhere.”
“I hate you,” he says sweetly.
Dean’s hand lands on his shoulder and squeezes, firm, before it falls away. Looking at him, Castiel sees him hesitating, some question tugging at the edge of his mouth. He doesn’t push—just waits, both of them treading water.
Fighting the tide of his anger is more than Dean can manage. He ignores Cas and unlocks the car.
“I missed you, too.”
“It’s Wednesday.”
“Can you send me a photo?”
The hallucinations started small. Little auditory things that nobody realized were happening until John snapped at Sam to stop talking through an episode of Magnum P.I. when Sam wasn’t even in the room. It shifted into something more difficult to deal with a few days later.
“What tests did they want you to do?” Dean asks, turning back to Parker.
Castiel doesn’t think it’s a stretch for him to assume that their room will be as well maintained as the exterior.
“Backup from the home office,” Dean tells her before they have to come up with anything else, and the Deputy’s face falls in what he assumes is disappointment that the crisis isn’t getting sorted out any time soon.
“Do you really want to listen to me complain about Lucifer for the next hour and a half? I could do it, but I think you’re going to get bored.”
“You’re welcome.”
Jack stops abruptly, like he’s unsure if he should say whatever else is on his mind, and Dean nudges him gently with his elbow. Gestures toward the table in the corner.
“You tiptoe in here?”
The most stubborn part of Dean wants to try and wait him out. To just lie here and take it until Cas can’t hold himself back any longer. To wait for Cas to lose his cool and start really going for it; for Cas to press his legs down harder, make his muscles burn with the stretch, and fuck him until he can’t see straight.
“Oh, Boże!” she breathes.
“I don’t know. What would you call them?”
Sam’s teacher is waiting to greet him in the lobby, and it’s nothing short of bizarre to see him in this context. Mr Wyatt’s AP English class was the last that Dean had been present in before he was taken, and Castiel still remembers the stricken look on the teacher’s face when he’d had to skip over Dean’s name during roll call in the weeks that followed.
His mouth is hot, and it tastes different than before. Bitter and slightly salty.
“So long as I can come to the hospital after,” he says, and she gives him a watery smile.
They spend another hour with Parker, making note of the few other details he’s able to recall—he spent almost three hours with Kelly, the yellow-eyed demon who brought her there was the same dark-haired woman they’d seen in the CCTV footage, all three of the demons he saw seemed to be hoping to win the favor of the baby’s father—and showing him how to protect himself should the demons come back.
Dean can’t help but snort.
“I don’t know. I can’t exactly taste it.”
“Yeah, well. No big. I probably could have been clearer. Figured you were busy, anyway.”
in your life,” Dean grins, and Castiel glares at him. He could say cock if he wanted to. “So. Can I?”
Sam steps forward, hesitant at first, and Dean exhales sharply, his breath coming out in a rush.
But Cas basically turned him down before he could even hand the tape over. Gently, of course. Carefully. And with his hands in his pockets, fingers curled tight around the cassette, Dean had fought off the tears that wanted to spill, and swallowed around the lump in his throat, and said, “Let’s just go home.”
“Castiel?” Agent Henriksen is heading for the door with his cell phone in hand, but he stops and flips it shut as Castiel turns to face him. “We wondered where you got to. You doing okay?”
“I noticed maple-bacon waffles on the menu yesterday,” he says, and Dean’s eyes light up at the concept.
