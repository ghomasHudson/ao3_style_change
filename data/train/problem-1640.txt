“Quite the contrary.” The figure looks down at the little book clutched in its long, pale hand. “If I wished to sever your ties with your corporeal form, I would not warn you of the danger of straying too far,” It says briskly, glancing towards the operating table and the blond surgeon. It closes its book and tucks it away in the inner folds of its heavy trench coat. It takes a step towards the table.
Instead he says, “Why are you still here?”
Sherlock freezes and holds himself perfectly still, waiting for the dance to begin; for John to lead. John's lips are warm and wet and taste of the sour, sweet of liquor. As John's lips start to move, soft and subtle, Sherlock desperately wonders if it is possible to get drunk by proxy; if his lips can absorb enough of the alcohol John consumed to warrant the way his head is spinning and his thoughts are blurring.
No, he must indulge in something

won’t be able to miss that it is more than a slow blink.
“Right.” Wilkes drops his hold on Sherlock's arm and takes my hand to shake it. I force myself to smile like a normal bloke that isn't visualising how easily I can break at least five of his bones in under twenty seconds.
As it turned out, Mary wasn't a
______________
John places his hands over top of Sherlock’s which are clutching the remains of his shirt. It's trembling and every muscle within Sherlock must be tensed, because he feels brittle - breakable.
Sherlock is becoming quietly addicted to John, and fighting hard to control stray thoughts that all revolve around his doctor.
"Just
My palms itch to reach out and grab him - as I had then - to put him between the wall and my body - pin him in and make him confess whatever is behind all this. But, remembering the surveillance cameras watching us, I shift my eyes to just over his shoulder, clench my hands into fists and wait for him to reveal what he plans to do. He draws right up to me with an invasive stare studying me.
The case had sounded interesting, initially, but it had taken Sherlock all of ten minutes looking around the room and at the body to deduce that the sister’s husband had done it. He'd made the incompetent detectives wait another twenty before he'd shared it just for the enjoyment of giving John the opportunity to discover the culprit as well. John's gotten quite good at applying Sherlock's methods, and he feels a special kind of warmth surge through him each time John lights up with revelation. However, now, with the case solved and the murderer caught, the consulting detective and his colleague.

Before Sherlock can snap back with a pointed comment, she sets off in a fiercely confident and sensual walk; like a lioness on the prowl. Sherlock glares at her. Then he jumps to his feet, nearly bolting after her when he realises she's heading straight for John and Mary. He freezes after only a few steps, realising he's incapable of stopping her without risking being seen by John.
That'd do me.
A good tangle is always fun but John hardly has to try to make this bloke's task more difficult. He obviously has more weight on him than the young man. However, it seems as though the tall frame of the other boy is leanly packed with muscle from what John can feel pressed against him.
note again. His hands shake as he shoves in his pocket.
“You're so - and I really shouldn't-” John's hands are in his hair and his eyes are wide in panic. “I'm drunk and you're
It occurs to Sherlock that perhaps being intimate with John is like taking poison. Not quite deadly in small doses, though you certainly feel as if you might die when it takes hold. Perhaps if he builds up his immunity to situations like this with small, persistent doses, there will come a day when he can drink fully and not perish.
Then confusion overtakes him as he realises John's error.
Sherlock has forgotten the question.
Which, honestly, is no less than what I deserve.
“Yes, of course... But, you know, he hasn't had much experience with this sort of thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take the lead there."
The stage is set. The curtain lifts. Sherlock's odyssey begins.
This time Sherlock lets himself consider the feeling of John’s unfaltering, nimble fingers running through his hair. It is not difficult to imagine since the doctor has sometimes run an assessing hand over his scalp, seeking out and determining the severity of head trauma following various encounters with criminals.
he hisses.
At a gentle touch on his shoulder, Sherlock jumps and his eyes snap open.
She's a succubus, Sherlock.”
sex... and certainly not love….
He switches off the overhead light and turns on the dim lamp on his bedside table. He moves to the window and draws the thinner, inner curtains. Diffused light from the street lamps spills through and lends a soft and soothing glow to the room. He opens his bedside drawer and arranges the supplies with the precision of a surgical tray. He leaves it just slightly ajar.
A vessel, transport; nothing more.
Memories of that day in the interrogation room flood back to Sherlock as something else occurs to him. He had purposely misled her into thinking John was dead. John would be the most likely suspect, no matter how much Sherlock asserted that they’d gone their separate ways. Hopkins had known that the person that came to Sherlock’s rescue that day had done their own hands significant damage. She is smart and observant. When she met John, saw he was alive, and saw his bandaged hands, she would have known instantly who had protected Sherlock and, in turn, who Sherlock had been protecting with his confession. He feels a little lightheaded and looks down to get his bearings.
“Maybe we had met in passing. At the baths or some celebration. I don’t know… I was not a
“What kind of websites?” John persists with a lazy, knowing smile.

“Suppose I deserved that,” he says around a bubbly laugh that shakes Sherlock. His face turns into Sherlock's neck and his lips are smiling against the sensitive skin right below Sherlock's ear. “You're just too bloody delicious.” He growls playfully and feigns an attack on Sherlock's neck; all wet lips, hot breath, and the faint scrape of hard teeth. It sets off an odd explosion of sensation that starts at Sherlock's neck then ricochetes through his chest, into his stomach and pelvis.

John is equally stunned and confused. This certainly isn't who he'd expected to find knocking on Sherlock's door on a Thursday evening.
"Sorry, almost done," John says gently as he moves down the back of Sherlock's skull. The silky curls twine around his fingers as he feels the shape beneath.
loved. You were brilliant…
he hears John mutter to himself. Sherlock is vaguely aware that he is watching him warily but he's too caught up in finding the perfect keys to unlock the puzzle of John Watson to be concerned with it. John shakes out his paper and clears his throat; the soft sigh and dubious expression on his face making it clear that he suspects he is going to regret this.

Sherlock's vision narrows.
"Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade." He pauses on the landing crowded with chatting police to twist and shake gloved hands with John. "In case it has not been made clear to you, this is an active investigation, John, which means that everything you see and hear is to be kept strictly confidential-"
"Sorry, what?"
“For Christ’s sake Sherlock - don’t - don’t..." He wants to say
He’s irritatingly perfect standing there all soft and adorably sleep mussed in a loose t-shirt and pajama bottoms. Sherlock is even more aware of his own state, sodden, sallow, and stinking a bit like the skip of rubbish he'd been knee deep in less than an hour ago. He’s suddenly much colder without the coat and he tries to hide his shivering with a brisk gesture. "The - um - case."
. "I really don't think-" I freeze in mid sentence as I process the last bit of her sentence and the full weight of what she is suggesting at last hits me. "No, no. I’m afraid you've got it all wrong, Mrs Hudson," I say waving a hand in the universal gesture of
Alarm bells scream.
"Steady now."
“Of course.” The entity blinks, considering Henry for a moment. It looks over to the surgeon and the way it worries its bottom lip with its teeth makes it seem young and unsure - such an odd contrast to the cool confidence it had radiated seconds ago. At last, it lifts its chin. “Sherlock.”
It is, in larger part,
“I was simply observing. You quite forcefully dragged me across that bed with clear intent - seeking relief from an obvious state of arousal-”

, it is almost as if the Captain can see.
Additionally, Sherlock is (finally) looking at me as well. His gaze is hard; his brow is furrowed, his lips are parted and his expression, like in the car park of Roland Kerr College when he realised I'd shot the cabbie, is oscillating between astonishment, confusion and interest. It's almost like he is seeing the

He turns towards the door and starts to drift. He feels the pull of her; her sadness like a black string tugging at him.

feels like victory when he manages to stave off Death and send them back out into that merciless world.
You're hesitant to leave Sherlock alone with the cooling embers of the fire you had going earlier, but since he barely acknowledges your existence these days, it's a guilt-ridden relief to be alone in your bedroom every night.
"You okay to do that case tomorrow? Just say the word, and I'll negotiate it with Greg, tell him you can't be expected to take over without enough time to prepare."
"Yeah, we are," John admits, running a hand through his hair. "But my car's here and I don't want to get ticketed," he says, then realises the police could probably do something about that in these circumstances. He gives Sherlock's hand a squeeze. "We just… it was a bit…"
that mistake. Nobody wants you to get chewed out in court or at some tribunal, but now that it's all out in the open thanks to that incident management team Lestrade was forced to summon, I have to give a statement regarding my recommendation."
To Sherlock's knowledge, John hasn't attended a single Sandhurst reunion before, but now, he appears excited. John is speaking as though Sherlock should already be aware of this event; maybe he has mentioned it and Sherlock hadn’t been listening.
"So that's why you're suddenly sleeping with so many pillows."
"Lestrade texted me earlier," Sherlock remarks apropos of nothing.
"I know. Not how I would have handled it."
John chuckles.
"Still like to hear it from you."
"And where were you?" Sherlock demands. It's hard to make out some of his words from behind the oxygen mask.
," Fiona starts pointedly, "just told me they don't read pointless emails. Such as those containing instructions that all surgeons go through their lists and report these exceptions. It's a meningioma, has been monitored for several years, and it doesn't yet interfere with the patient's ability to work."
Angus shrugs and steps back from the door, muttering something. Maybe it's about the house; Sherlock doesn't care enough to decipher the words.
it, John has abstained from pleasuring himself.
"It's not for you."
[221b ficlet]
It takes eight days of John's recovery for Sherlock to reach a stage of teetering on the edge of stark staring bonkers. He knows — he's a surgeon, for heaven's sake — that recovery takes time and saps cognitive resources, but it's his own patience that's wearing thin. John's immune system has taken a hammering, and his pain management regime is a struggle that requires understanding and support. Sherlock
John tries to keep in mind what Joanna had told him: "
A Friday morning round at the ward ends up adding insult to injury. A cardiology consultant who is not Mike and Sherlock's surgeon come see how he's getting on. Since the surgeon's visits are no longer daily, he has decided to make use of today's joint bedside conference with the cardiologist as an opportunity to gang up on their recalcitrant patient to lecture him about lifestyle choices.
"We all have constructive traits and destructive traits, benign defences and ones that only end up hurting ourselves when we employ them. I’ve read that even Mother Teresa could be quite a temperamental woman with a hurtful tongue. Emotional space and the right to it, Sherlock — that's all. I apologise if I failed to explain myself well the last time we spoke. All I wish for you and John is that you feel as equal as possible in your marriage, and that there's room for both of you in it."
Asperger’s syndrome is no longer a separate diagnostic entity in the neuropsychiatric diagnostic classifications. Sociopathy is a feature associsted most often with antisocial personality disorder, not a separate personality disorder.
. He's going back to King's tomorrow, which is why he's doing this today. He needs to clean the slate. Instead of a crushing, fatal blow, Drakan Zezelj will be a lesson.
"I can practically feel you thinking so damned hard over there," John grumbles, "we're home. Stop plotting whatever it is you're plotting and have a nap with me."

"I wouldn't be surprised if he blamed me for even that," Violet prompts.

That doesn't help.
"Yes, Mister Holmes."
', whatever it was. When you shook his shoulder he jolted awake, clearly on the verge of a panic attack, trapped between a flimsy grasp on reality and whatever horrors had gripped him in his dreamscape.
"What are they operating on?" Anderson asks. He must be the one who will take over Sherlock's duties once this is over.
You'd tried to keep your tone neutral, to pick the right words, but with Sherlock there
"You came here tonight. You seem to be upset, and you still came home to us. That means a lot to me. To us," Violet says quietly, "even if you just followed John's advice. I want you to feel like this is a place where you are welcome, but I have come to understand it's not been like that for you."
“Doing a proper survey of your vitals. You’ll need an IV if this is low.”
Violet sets three places by the kitchen table, and Sherlock flops down into one of the chairs, tempted to dig out his phone and lose himself in his emails. He refrains but only barely, aware that John would probably consider that impolite.
Angus chuckles, and a blast of his stale breath hits Sherlock square in the face.
John's chuckle is as bitter as a preserved lemon. "Yeah, no. There were… others. This one guy in Afghanistan. Got a bit serious. He got me transferred. I was really pissed off at him for that, even though I knew it was the right thing to do for the both of us. It's not that bad in the service these days if you like men, but it's still not…"
"Only you," John says with a grin, and it takes me a moment to realise he's referring to the visual similarity between the piece of somewhat burnt toast I have placed on the table next to the photos, and the blackened murder victims in them.
"Is that where you were injured?"
"What else?"
"There's no reason to torture yourself like that. Greg made a good call in relieving you of the case."
"Things, what
"He still ended up in a situation that made him angry at himself for not being able to do more. To fulfil his own expectations."
“He’s an entrepreneur.”
Relieved that he can cross King's off his list, Sherlock decides against calling his parents for now. Mummy would overreact and fuss terribly, and her stupid questions and assumptions of his inability to cope would only rile Sherlock up. He's already on edge; he doesn't need or want her attention right now.
"Mister Holmes?" Halloran asks, possibly not for the first time; Sherlock had managed to distance himself from the conversation.
[angst, serial killers, undefined relationship, casefic]
me to know. Maybe you're expecting me to work it out myself, but I can't, Sherlock. And you can believe that it's not for lack of trying." This is mostly guesswork — just the kind of emotional conjecture he ridicules you about, but could Mrs Hudson truly be so wrong?
Of course even John understands that normal NHS waiting times are simply too much for footie, rugby and ice hockey stars; a single season can be a career-breaking moment for them, and even a short absence a disaster. Getting treated at their clubs' expense in the private sector means that they won't be clogging up public healthcare resources. Still, John can't always push away thoughts of all those grannies at NHS hospitals waiting days for surgery for a busted hip. He's only one man; he can't fix a broken system single-handedly, but he can make sure that his patients — who are as worthy as all the public sector ones, of course, just with very specific and high-maintenance needs — get the best he can offer.
"Sherlock?" you ask.
Finally, Sherlock pulls back a bit, and speaks. "I can't go to work."
"Because…" John frowns, "because they're interested?"
"Café, second floor."
"Sorry," John says. "Needed a distraction. You're being very beastly today, young lady," he chides fondly and fluffs her sparse hair with his hand.
All this is explained by Isabelle Halloran, a BMA solicitor whose advice Sherlock has sought for the trial. Since he is not the defendant, Halloran had not been appointed on behalf of the Association to assist Sherlock; he had hired her services privately after discussing the situation with John and Lestrade. Sherlock had been adamant, at first, that he didn't need such advice just for taking the witness stand, but John had seemed so worried about how things would go and how Sherlock's performance would go down in the press that he'd relented.
. The outer wall is low enough that when Sherlock stands inside the structure, he can still see John.
, Sherlock thinks. How had he not realised he's never been in bed with the man like this? He knows John is a great many things, but he never quite expected such an exquisite and distinct, yet subtle transformation.
Wiggins turns, looking sceptical. “Not selling no more single cigs. Get a pack with your batteries.”
They slip into the cab. Sherlock is silent for some time, looking out the window. Then, he regards John tiredly. "My part in the trial is done, at least." His tone is inquisitive but careful, as though he wants feedback on how he'd done on the stand but dreads what John might say.
John had been right in one thing: the change in surroundings provides enough distraction that Sherlock can almost pretend something in the back of his mind isn't dragging things down like a trawler scouring the darker layers of his psyche. If he busies himself with being a house guest, his brain finds it harder to scare up things which he'd then have to waste energy trying to expel.
Words from your friendly neighbourhood fandom anaesthetist: I don't care where that nicotine comes from — addiction is bad for you. Best never to even start smoking.
Sherlock lets go of his sleeve. "Malosa."
In a few minutes, grey dots are dancing, and Sherlock breathes easier. John shouldn’t be typing, he should be sleeping, but Sherlock can’t deny that he’s terribly grateful to the universe for even this brief reminder that he’s not alone.
John then mentioned the media.
don’t see trustworthy. Surgeons deal with surgeons because the likes of you could never understand what it's like, the work we do. And I have no reason to trust someone who cares more about avoiding a scandal than they do about my patient."
"I promise that what I tell the family will be accurate," Lestrade assures him. "You know as well as I do that there are many ways of phrasing things — ways that sound encouraging and ways that emphasize the bad."
It's not just himself he fears losing. It's you, and it's a reflection of the horror of what you barely kept at bay when he underwent the operation. You don't want to lose him — any version, form, or part of him.
Sherlock clearly disapproves. "That sounds sentimental."
John has never asked about his private life. He's not asked about Sherlock's family, his friends, or a potential romantic interest. He's not asked because he's Sherlock's surgeon, and the things they do together are not personal.
There's John's criminal record, showing only a drunk and disorderly from his university days. No DUI charges or convictions.
John brakes gently to allow the last of a flock of sheep to cross the road. The interior is farmland — small patches which used to feed a family each, now mostly for sheep. Ahead of them, down a low hill, Sherlock can see the road getting wider and houses huddled closer together.
You couldn't agree more.
"Sherlock, don't be like that."
John lifts his gaze upwards, feigning thinking hard. "Let's see… I believe I'm owed at least four blowjobs, two––"
"Electricity?"
"No need to hide it. I'd find it anyway if I was… inclined. But I won't be, since I'm clean, remember? It's yours. You'll need it. It would be the lowliest thing to do to deprive you of it."
John wonders, though he agrees that the point should be made that it stinks to high heaven of a governing body caving in under media pressure.
"Not really," Doctor Pichler says bluntly. "Worst-case scenario is this: it would signal that he now carries the responsibility for fulfilling your plans for not just himself but the unrealised potential of his sister, too."
And someone is sitting on the steps.
he is?" John counters. He doesn't know how hard Greg had fought against this process, or whether he'd even been given a say. "He's doing his job. Isn't that all you should care about?"
'Have you ever had to attend to a family member who's poorly in a way that would require weeks to recover to full health?' Sherlock asks.
He trusts her to ask the questions others won't. They are questions Sherlock would prefer to avoid but knows he must answer if he's to decide what to do about neurosurgery.
is one of them. It saves lives every day. As one of many examples I have experienced personally, it prevented a patient from losing an abdominal organ when it was a lower limb operation they came in for.
The doors slide open again, revealing the unsurprising sight of Sherlock since John is perfectly aware his husband is on call, too, as backup for a neurosurgical registrar. When a relatively inexperienced, still-in-training neurosurgeon is taking call, the senior needs to stay in house to attend to complex A&E cases since he'll have to accompany the reg into theatre or take over managing the case. It appears he's left the registrar behind somewhere.
"I didn't choose medicine under some delusion that it would be easy, Mummy," Sherlock comments. "I knew the theory would not be the challenging part, of course, but I believed I was willing to do whatever it took to conquer the challenges. In fact, I have come to the conclusion lately that a part of me may have wanted to choose medicine instead of a theoretical field because it was more... human. Because the rewards included making a difference for real people's real, living brains. You may call it bloody-mindedness, but the very thing that made it such a formidable challenge made me want it more, made me want to prove to you, above all, that I could do it. John and Dr Pichler tell me that those things, having a good bedside manner and reading people, are not easy for any physician. John says that sometimes the work might even be easier for me than average because I can compartmentalise so well. You foresaw how hard the social part of medicine would be for me, and I begrudged you for it because I didn’t want to face that truth. But you said it just now: when you are in very deep and have committed years to what you want to do, it's hard to choose differently. And shouldn't that make you want to fight for it?"
"Take a bloody guess," he snaps. "I don't like it when you make me say obvious things for some obscure pseudo-therapeutic purpose. It doesn't work."
“You should at least drink as much as you can.”
"There's a first time for everything," Sherlock mutters, making sure that his coat is pulled all the way into the sidecar.
"Some of it, yeah, but I didn't tell him that I wasn't the one injured. Well, I did have a cracked rib and bruised shins and such, but nothing that warranted thinking my career was caput. I meant not injured badly. But my mate was. Coded during transport. And I spent a lot of time blaming myself for that, thinking I'd missed some pretty obvious shit, thinking that since I'd just done my trauma and ortho periods, I should have been able to save him. That I made mistakes. That I was rubbish. That I should probably swap careers to something harmless like derm."
John looks that way, though, and it's wondrous. "Come in, come in." He pats a bit of flour off his jeans. "I've baked a bit of something," he says apologetically.
"Everything alright?" the DI asks when the forensic hubbub begins to die down.
He wakes with John's fingers coiled right around his neck. Struggling to breathe, he flails with his arms, his fingers clawing through thin air as he tries to escape from the grip.
"John's surgery has still put you in a carer's role again, a role you have told me you find extraordinarily difficult. As a child, you were told you were the object of assistance and support and in constant need of them, incapable of providing such things for others. It's logical that a reversal of that belief would be difficult for you to negotiate."
"I would have just… watched from…" Sherlock tries, wanting still to grab the nearest MI6 minion and push them down the stairwell.
Those who are dead, are not dead
"Sinus rhythm," you confirm with a grin. "It worked. Did you feel it?"
"Yeah, lots going on with work and with his Mum, but now things are slowing down. We're okay, though, the two of us, I think?" John hadn't meant it as a question, but that's how it had sounded. It grates a bit, suspecting that there might be a problem, but Sherlock just can't or won't tell him about it. He tries to remind himself that this
He is relieved to spot Kingsley Loveridge, the Executive Director of the Trust, pushing open the command tent flap door. John knows he's the official police command liaison — if they're telling anyone anything, it's this guy. John blocks his path; Loveridge might not remember his name, but he should be familiar with John's face after sitting in many of the same meetings.
"Do you want me to keep Mycroft out of this?" you ask. "I will," you declare and mean it.
"Who are you talking about?"
He knows that most of what's making things problematic right now is his fault because it's his brain that keeps seeing demons where there are none. His insecurity in being able to manage relationships is resurfacing with a vengeance; he is so terrible at knowing instinctively what needs to be done to help his husband. Everything he tries seems to be ineffective until he's at his wits' end and retreated too deeply into his own head to be able to read what John tries to communicate. When he is at work but not operating, he prowls the hospital, texts John and frets because he feels the pull of home. But, as soon as he gets home, he paces about aimlessly while John watches TV or sleeps those fifteen-minute micro-naps, neither of them able to make the time go any faster.
Moreover, what could possibly go wrong? Yes, Sherlock would be devastated and John would try to uphold his pride and character, eventually things would get settled. He loved his brother but he loved his political position and power too. He had to put a stop to the bombings before the plans took shape. Perhaps Eurus would lose interest in John after a while? Maybe Eurus and her intellectual challenges would keep Sherlock's mental faculties occupied enough that he would back out, stop pining and let Eurus live with John? Voila! And, this wasn't the first time Mycroft would be using John to keep one of his siblings in check. Sure, Sherlock had his obsession with John too, but Eurus had another extremity and currently, John was more of an asset with Eurus than Sherlock. Maybe later he could place John with Sherlock again.
So it was Rosie and Sally both captured and it was all his fault. He knew, bloody well knew the plan was doomed and his life was doomed, but no. He had to fuck everything up and now two lives in danger. What was he thinking? He shouldn't have escaped. He should've waited enough to gain their trust and then fled with Rosie. But didn't they already abduct Rosie whilst they were under the impression that John was under drug induced sleep? Maybe they had planned on getting rid of her anyway. Christ. Panic was not helping him right then but what was he to do? He would never risk another life now- already knowing its vain.
"John, we know that my sister here is a manipulative
“Alright..and what is the proof that you will not, I don’t know, try to kidnap me in the middle of all this?”
"Truth"
The woman shifts from her bed and starts straddling John, clearly the area where Sherlock last left John. "John, you really are so naive. It is one of the reasons I love you so much sweetheart." Eurus starts grinding her hips between John's legs, and her bodycon dress bunches up revealing her pale sculpted thighs. Both of them let out a sweet moan. "John, I said you are mine, and hence it is not a one night stand, it means I own you and I would control you, forever. You are not supposed to leave my side ever again. I would make love to you and take care of you but if you ever try to run away from me, there will be consequences John, do you understand?"
"Yes, I do understand you want to pass some valuable time with Sherlock. Why John though? You have never mentioned him specifically and e has nothing to do with you, does he?"
"She wishes to move into your flat with you two."
"Ah yes, Mycroft. You told me you would take care of the sleeping arrangements?"
"Aah! Sherlock! It's hurting. I might bleed if you continue." John doubts Sherlock cares but it's worth trying.
Once he is stretched enough, Sherlock removes his fingers and kneels to position his ignored cock in line with John's entrance. He rims the perineum with his precum and thrusts forward into John's warmth, expecting a sharp yelp in response. But he says nothing, just takes it in and his face becomes unreadable which intrigues the taller man .
"NO!", the Holmes brothers reply in unison.
"Most assuredly. Anthea, be a dear and explain it to them." The blackberry can have a mini vacation now that she has finally put it in her pocket.
"Tell me, have you ever been sexually interested in anyone? Who is it Sherlock?"
"What does that mean?"
"Then what do we do John? Sit back here till the freak does something terrible?"
much to the Holmes duo to hurt a sergeant, was he?
"Aahh, that's doable.", Mycroft seconds. Funny how the Holmes siblings tend to understand each other without even speaking and yet cannot stand each other for too long.
"No! no, just provide me some protection Sally. I think whatever this new obsession Sherlock has developed with me will fade away and things might go back...go back to normal."
“Mmmm...
He is sweating and shuffling against the bed. Three fingers. Hard and fast as he can.
(See the end of the chapter for
John staggers back a few steps, feeling like he has just been run over by a lorry. As Sherlock moves past him towards his own bedroom, John can now see that he is moving just the slightest bit gingerly and... Oh, god...
There is only breathing in the quiet room as John’s hands move up to rest just under the hem of Sherlock's housecoat at the juncture of the top of Sherlock’s leg and buttox. They caress the sensitive flesh along that seam and Sherlock is acutely aware that no other human being has touched him
” He gives Sherlock a rough shake as if expecting some sign of agreement. “I ask so little in return.

“Oh?” John seems genuinely surprised and dismayed to hear this. “Sorry,” he scrubs a hand over his face. “There was a party and drinking… Didn't mean to drink
"Ta, for that." I gesture at him to take in his entire form as I turn away. "You obviously were out all night."
He turns back to the bed and begins sorting the items he'd gathered into the numerous pockets of his coat. It's almost meditative. Lockpick set, magnifying glass, handheld blacklight, cotton swabs, plastic evidence bags, phone, and test strips; a place for everything, and everything in its place.
Sherlock flushes, stands up quickly, and walks to his violin. His heart is thundering in his chest, his head, his fingertips. It bursts out of him in the wild, erratic snaps of quick-paced music he plays.
“I hope you know what you are doing, John,” Sherlock says on a sigh as John turns him. His expression is naked as he looks into John's eyes. John blinks at him, fighting back the burning.
"You gave him the Hong Kong accounts," I add, trying to hasten the conversation along. Sherlock is being strangely silent.
Sherlock’s fingers fly across the keyboard of the laptop as he begins researching, cataloging and ranking questions to form his list of 11. He practically vibrates with excitement.

“What happened? Did someone hurt you?” John slowly pivots around again, scanning the room for an intruder. Finding no one, he turns back towards Sherlock, looking him over. His whole body is trembling and it likely appears to John that Sherlock is in the throes of another panic attack. John relaxes his muscles as his mind clears a little of the fog of sleep and the adrenaline of a violent awakening. Sherlock can almost see it all coming back to him as he recalls the events of the day and that he'd been lying on top of Sherlock as a
But something stops me.
Janine watches him quietly for a few moments then sighs and gently curls her fingers around the lapels of his coat. “I could just shake you, you know. Don’t you get it? This is a big risk he’s takin’ here, for all the world to see. He told me that right here, he’d all but admitted to Irene that he loved you, but he thought you loved
Sherlock slips away from Hopkins and the nurses easily enough while waiting for head scans and locates Victor’s room with the help of a quick search on the computer at a nursing station. He watches it for a moment from the hall, ensuring that no one is currently attending him, then quietly slips inside.
“Um… Sherlock?” I jog to catch up with Sherlock who is briskly striding back the way we’d just come. “Should I -” I glance back at Sebastian. “Where do you want me?” I only plan to take what I need from the advance but I am also determined to earn it by being of some help on this case.
It felt so natural now for his body to mould to his companion beneath him. Though he was the
"What?" John looks up sharply. She is gazing out the window, seemingly lost within her own thoughts as her finger traces condensation on her glass.
He stops and stares, finger hovering over one name;
Sherlock is growing more and more irritated as he scrolls and clicks through article after article. After several moments, his skin is prickling and his hands are beginning to shake ever so slightly. He can't quite put his finger on why until he looks up to the window and catches John's reflection.
Sherlock contemplates asking about the other fragments of his tangled memory, but doesn't know how.
John drops Sherlock on the bed. Sherlock falls flat on his back then pulls himself up to lean back on his elbows. He looks up at John with a strangely inviting look that John promptly tells himself he is
he reminds himself forcing his body to still and stay rooted to the floor.
However, his sharp look only lasts a moment, then he's turning away, waving a hand as if dismissing the possibility that the hired killer did his job and skipped town.
He doesn't flinch. It takes a lot to make John Watson flinch, but there is an expression of surprise mixed with curiosity and a hint of concern that flickers over his face as his eyes snap around the room in an assessing manner, then come to rest on Sherlock regally perched on the sitting room couch, wrapped in nothing but a sheet. The late afternoon light is warmly slinking in through the windows, making his smooth, porcelain skin glow in sharp contrast to the dark purple cotton sheet wrapped around him like a royal robe.
And if it so happens that my cleaning up of the mess comes as an inconvenience or irritation to Sherlock, all the better. Serves the prick right for being unable to muster anything more than indifference to my existence and only responding in vaguely disinterested hums or blunt, monosyllabic retorts to any of my efforts to engage him.

That will
“I was merely in proximity-”
“Are you going to say it then?” Andy asks quietly. Sherlock suddenly feels his heartbeat in his sternum, his fingertips, his lips and his ears. “Keep it under glass too long and it goes to dust,” Andy says lifting his hand to the glass. Sherlock shakes his head back and forth minutely.
"John," she warns in the same vaguely annoyed and patronising tone she had during my first abduction. She seems so utterly bored by it all that I have to wonder how often her job entails this sort of thing.

The thing that is
"About bloody time. Don't you ever-" He freezes with a look of stunned confusion taking over his face as he blinks at John. "Oh! Uh…?"
John clears his throat and looks away. “Indian?” His voice is deeper than usual and frayed on the edges.
After 60 minutes John is looking more sober, with clearer eyes and less slurred words. It only makes sense that his body has had time to process the alcohol. However, he still seems giddy, often grinning like the Cheshire cat whenever they break apart to catch their breath. He also often mumbles little exclamations of praise that don't seem altogether voluntary, yet, they melt Sherlock's anxiety and stoke a heat deep within Sherlock.
, as you say. It is a
Sherlock likes dancing... but
The room has been filling with a thickening tension over the last two hours as Sherlock’s glances at John over his laptop have steadily increased in frequency and length. John doesn't look up every time Sherlock looks at him but he clearly feels the eyes watching him, his posture shifting minutely to attentiveness in a way he probably is not even aware he is doing.
"Damn it, Sherlock," I mutter bitterly. I think of the small smile and the soft look he gave me, even as he tried to hide from me whatever fight he had just endured because of me. It's all so confusing. It shouldn't be possible for a man that seems so harsh and uncaring to make a violin weep and sigh like that. For him to be so cold one moment and so vulnerable and human the next.
"Well… it is just... you're not even in that field. You're a chemistry major and you've two years to go."
Sherlock had been fighting the guard whilst I had been off fighting the Chip and Pin.
Sherlock blinks and blinks, as if this simply doesn't compute. After a moment, his features harden, transforming from shock into suspicion.
I hesitate. My head is naturally tilted to the side, my eyes are narrowed, and my lips pursed, as watch him move away from me and feel that pull. There is a very familiar, dark hunger stirring in my gut.
. Right to the heart of it, easy as breathing.” Her eyes hold a little heat as she stares at Sherlock. “And not just that... you stepped all over everybody while doing it. Especially Lestrade... I really respect ‘im - he looked out for me comin’ up… considered him a friend. Before John came along to teach you how to be human, you treated him like
Sherlock becomes more rigid; relief and anticipation warring within his body. He continues to stare at the computer, only stealing a glance at John once he is certain his back is turned.
“Indeed,” Sherlock says tightening his lips as his eyes flash with mirth.
There's no response. John steps forward, then stops himself from following after him. He'd assume he wants privacy in there, but the door doesn't close.
“That's a good boy.” The dark haired man murmured against Sherlock's neck. Sherlock’s face contorted in pain as the man bit down on his shoulder, drawing blood. “You remember.”
The chamber was empty.
over that contact.
"Favourite type of food, then?"
Turning back with a sentence forming on lips.
Sherlock wants more.

"They've left one this time… Will you come?"
“Yes, well… can’t be
"Go ahead, Lestrade. I'll follow behind."

John tips his chin just slightly to the side and it says everything while he is saying nothing at all. He is wearing that hard, thin smile that is not a smile at all. Sherlock has just proven his point for him with that dramatic (over)reaction.
The truth hits me once again, like a stray bit if rubbish whipped away only to be smacked back into my face and cling there. As furious as I want to be at him, I've no one but myself to blame. I brought this upon us. He'd said they'd attack if they thought we were getting close enough to each other for them to effectively use me as leverage and now they are attacking.
John fumbles across the room, headed for the door. Sherlock has now managed to sit up but can't say anything. He can only watch in stunned horror as John comes to his senses and rejects all that happened between them.
Attacking me financially.
.” He articulates each word as if speaking to a particularly slow child, which he knows she hates. However, she doesn’t take the bait or appear at all deterred. She waits, lifting a perfectly groomed eyebrow in demand. There is a reason she is so good at her night job. “You're wrong," Sherlock repeats and then lets out a slow breath and rolls his eyes heavenward before leveling them on her. "There was no
“I think he wants me to take a look.” He clips the ‘k' sharply, his temper being tested by this senseless stalling.
“But she looked it? I mean, she - she actually feels for me?”
." Sherlock glances over at John, his eyes sweeping head to toe, as if re-evaluating him. His expression settles into one of distaste. "One would think that an aspiring doctor would be more familiar with Latin," he comments archly.
He hasn't been here in years. The steel beneath his fingers is cool and he leans against it a moment, considering what he might find, before he at last cautiously pushes open the lab door. He startles, taking a small step back, when the door reveals Stamford leaning against the same side of the worktop he was standing at for the majority of that first meeting with John. He turns and grins broadly as Sherlock glances around and moves inside the room.
Yet… Precious. Unique. Remarkable…

John watches Sherlock for as long as he can but at last rolls to his back, sprawling out on the cement slab floor, and lets his eyes slide closed. The pain is overwhelming. He lets out a shaky breath, relieved that the danger is over and Sherlock is ok. Then he presses his eyes closed harder and grimaces.
“No,” Sherlock interjects. His muffled growl is clear and sharp. He twists his hands a little in the fabric of the coat. John sighs and starts again
John nestles his face into the cushion above Sherlock's shoulder and Sherlock feels the tremble in the body above him. There is such unspoken need in the way John wraps around him; more like a desperate hug than a simple passive blanket. He clings to Sherlock as if he is the only mooring in the world against a riptide that threatens to drag him away and pummel him to death against the sharp, rock cliffs of memory.
Watson and Sherlock will still be
The effluvium of death; the copper-penny tang of blood and thick stench of charred flesh, mixes with sand and nearly chokes Captain Watson's lungs but he continues to bark orders. "Double time. Across the clearing."
Sherlock stares down at his own hands, feeling oddly disoriented. He is so tired, so weak and now his head is pounding in a stuttering beat synchronized with every throbbing injury to his broken body. It is an enormous drum; thudding louder and louder, crowding out everything else as it works towards crescendo. There is no relief in between the beats; he can hear the buzz of the florescent lights, smell the sweat from previous occupants of this room; reeking of fear and stale coffee. He just wants to close his eyes and sink into the silence of that final rest. He pulls his hands back and curls them around the paper cup of tea to keep them from shaking. His thoughts skip randomly over the information she has provided, squeezing in between the pulse of his body.
John stops in mid-motion.

as impeccably done as usual.
that has been eluding him. At the heart of it is a memory from their intimate night together. He remembers now - the shock and pain of John fleeing and, as he stood near the door the way he gestured, with hands that were shaking, at Sherlock's (repulsively masculine) naked chest and said
“They send their drivers and such, innit.”
John lifts up the cod he's holding. "A decent size for one meal. This is the only spot in Orkney where they go this dark brown," John says.
Sherlock draws a deep breath.
“Believe me, for
"Nor does it describe you, but as someone with a history of PTSD, surely you recognise that the neural and endocrine responses of a fight-or-flight response stem from physiology that developed very early, even before the dawn of man as we know it."

"Those records are perfectly in line with the account you wrote down for John."
Is it what Doctor Pichler would call an olive branch? He's discussed with her how annoyed he gets when people don’t just say what they mean. John should know by now that Sherlock needs him to be clear, not vague and abstract.
"I hear a punitive aspect in your thinking again, Sherlock. Do you really think that the kind of behaviours John was exhibiting towards you, behaviours he has explicitly stated he deeply regrets and wants to learn how to avoid, were deserved?"
"I'm sorry," John offers. What else could he do but demonstrate that he's listening?
Some more clicking around. "He's listed for an operation as the non-perfusion anaesthetist."
When reality finally begins creeping in, judging by what he can feel at his left buttock, John's is now working at his own cock. He comes with a thigh-shaking groan and rests his forehead against Sherlock's shoulder before pulling back. The separation of their bodies feels like a cold front.
"You sea! I resign myself to you also,
John pats the exam table again. "Take your jacket and shirt off, and hop on here."
"Have memories of other past events besides Afghanistan resurfaced?"
Mycroft briefly closes his eyes, a weariness setting into his posture. "Better to be feared than pitied. Curious that he should choose a disguise which is, in many ways, the very opposite of what he is like. I am glad to have observed that you've never made the mistake of assuming he lacks emotion or caring. And you certainly do not lack those things towards him."
“You know that article I’ve been trying to write?” John asks.
He's leaving that part to you.
It hits — the full-on realisation that this is it. John will wake up alone in the Drever house, scrape together a meagre breakfast from what’s left in the kitchen, then go to work at the clinic. He’ll continue his barebones existence. Maybe he’ll think about Sherlock when he puts on the album that they had danced to two nights ago.
"Have you talked to neuro?"
"I don't think anyone gets it, really," another female voice, one Sherlock does not recognise, points out, "they say love's blind but in Holmes' case that's not the issue — deaf is what it should be."
The case is distractingly promising. In fact, it's
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
"But you don't. From army surgeon to family physician on a remote island. Quite a transition," Sherlock confirms and grips the hand supports of his chair. "Then again, after Afghanistan, why wouldn't you want a bit of peace and quiet? Must've seen enough pain and suffering and gruesome injuries and violent deaths for a lifetime."
"I don't know how to function without you. And I know how to function even less when you're right there but when we're not… communicating very well. When I don't know what to do to make things better for you. I feel more alone, then, than I did before we met because you're right there, but not really present, and you behave as though I'm the last thing you want to even look at."
. Patients don't even know what to look for in terms of evaluating doctors, and even other physicians' rankings would be subjective, at best." Sherlock has adopted his most snidely superior tone, one he rarely uses with John.
Mycroft put it well in his usual holier-than-thou manner: "She's passed beyond our reach."
Sherlock expects to be taken to the opposite end of the island, somewhere far enough not to be visible from his house. Maybe there is a village, perhaps even a GP surgery. Sherlock knows at least that Westray is one of the bigger Orkney islands, big enough to have some local services.
You spend an agonising minute of worrying that Sherlock will fight the tube again, that he's uncomfortable, that he's in pain,

John is still dozing when he finally decides that seven in the morning on a Saturday simply

"I know it is." When he'd been in a halo vest, John had been… John had helped him. John had looked after him, hadn't he, even when he had been going through so many difficult things himself? Sherlock was in no state to support him because he was struggling, too. What excuse does he have now?
"I don't know what that means. You should message him."
“Zero?” John repeats in a tight voice. He cocks his head to the side and squints at Sherlock. His takes in the subtle signs of nervousness in the way Sherlock holds himself; the rare, anxious mannerisms that means he is working hard to stave off a growing panic. John blinks three times and swallows down his own discomfort roughly before straightening his spine and narrowing his eyes on a place just above Sherlock’s right shoulder. He forces his hands to relax their vice-like grip around the edge of the tub that is making his knuckles white and his fingers ache. Then he wills the rest of his body to follow suit, relaxing into a calm attentiveness.
a game to me - that I'm emotionally compromised.
John shifts in his chair and sighs under the silent scrutiny.
There is only a brief pause to process this upending of the world before everything is moving again. John can't help the fit of giggles that overtakes him as he sprawls on top of this bony stranger, who is struggling to wrangle with his sheet and John. Long, smooth limbs flail wildly like some angry, albino giraffe.
“You were what?!” They both look at Molly again, who has gone pale and wide-eyed. Her stare is snapping between the two of them as if she is desperately trying to work it all out. "With Sherlock?"
How is this wonder-of-a-man always designed to be his greatest weakness?
The only positive thing that has come of the whole mess is that now John has a clearer understanding of how Sherlock views their romantic encounter - how much he values it. Buried within that rejection of John's apology, was the fact that Sherlock wants to hold onto the memory of that experience - so much so, that he was furious when he thought John wanted to erase it. That's
"No, it's not -" John says quickly, certain that the older man has  the wrong impression about what's going on here. Whatever his relationship to Sherlock, finding him in what looks to be a compromising position is by no means good. Just as the man looks ready to turn and bolt, Sherlock secures his robe and storms forward.
love... I don’t doubt that you love him too, but you can’t keep going like you have done. Either love him right or let him go, sweetie.” Sherlock looks down at her hands gripping his lapels in that way that is somehow like the stern affection of an older sister and his chest hurts at the thought. They probably could have been friends if he hadn’t been so cold towards her in his effort to kill his own feelings for John. He looks into her eyes.
"Right," I snarl out through my clamped down teeth, not at all impressed by his posturing only to dole out (frankly, insulting) medical advice. He's just toying with me now. "I am a
He gets up, pulls on his coat and leaves that dark, empty flat. If he has to be miserable at least he can have company.
“Blanket,” John mutters lowering himself down onto Sherlock's boneless frame. His tone, full of authority and control, is so contrary to the language his body is speaking of raw, unguarded abdication of his power. Every muscle is wrought with tension, anguish, sadness and emotional pain. It sets the inside of Sherlock’s head whirling fruitlessly like the gears just can’t catch.
"Would you like me to-" John takes a hold of the bottom hem of his t-shirt, lifts it slightly, and tips his head to the side in question with a bit of a challenge.

“This wasn’t even a problem until
John isn't Sherlock's friend. It's not just that Sherlock
Sherlock lifts his chin, looking up and around at our extravagant surroundings in that completely absorbed way he has of observing everything; somewhere between a scientist picking apart all the variables and a predator planning the best means of attack.
‘Amazing,’ John’s lips are forming soundlessly.
When it was over and you ripped the jacket off me it felt like you ripped me open. There it was, my heart, right out there for you to see. I
“The name’s

"How can you be sure?"
Watson shudders as that

Need to
John’s gaze lingers on Sherlock. A small flicker of something, difficult to discern from Sherlock’s peripheral vision, crosses his expression. He licks his lips and clears his throat. He angles his body towards the door, apparently reconsidering his original intention to leave early to do some errands prior to his date. Then, he strides into the sitting room and settles into his arm chair. He picks up his newspaper and casually begins to look through it.
Speaking of which, she turns to look at Sherlock and gets the answer she had undoubtedly anticipated. She moves to glare and John again. "John, you're under a huge misconception. Look at him, John. Is he really disgusted? I think he is delighted by how pretty you look when debauched, if one goes by the bulge in his trousers." Eurus cocks up an eyebrow and wriggles it in direction of Sherlock clearly suggesting John to have a look himself.
Eurus just laughs. "Okay. Okay. So now the game is between you and me Sherlock?"
John couldn’t help but notice that Eurus’ articulation of words had strong undertones from none other than Jim Moriarty. So much that it seemed like she was Eurus
John gave him a suspicious nod and sat down on the sofa after lifting Rosie in his arms, rocking her from side to side to make her sleep. Mycroft did not request tea today which was -
Mycroft enters first. Behind him are two muscular giant men, each wearing a black suit and carrying weaponry. As if this was a secret base of some kind. Then enters the lady of the hour-
"This wouldn't have happened if you had taken care of the pill dosage and the pick locks but I do not have time to waste bickering with you. John is of prime importance. So, he does not have a wallet and would not risk asking another person for a phone. He can't take a taxi and would not be too far."
John finishes packing his things, apologizes to Sarah, picks Rosie up and enters the flat.
and not Eurus Holmes. He wondered just how much time they must have spent together for her to imbibe his speaking style and thought process.
"Uhm, it's clear Mycroft hasn't done anything. I'll sleep on the couch with Rosie. Eurus you can take my room." John says.
, was where the rhyme, or rather the clue was hinting at. Clearly, he was to find someone or something there. Or perhaps not? Because, who knew what went on in the minds of those Holmes brothers? Brothers
"Try me, brother."
"Hmm, goodnight."
"Hush, John. It's okay take all the anger out. Let me help you relax." Sherlock moves to place a pillow beneath John, and then starts stroking his cheeks before placing a peck on his forehead. He then, moves to spot gentle kisses everywhere accessible on his face and moves his other hand to take John's now limp cock into his hand, pressing it tenderly.
“John I…” He started but then the cold unrelenting voice was back. “Quite right. You see, there are going to be three levels to this game. At the end of each one, you get to save one life.”
Sherlock thinks,
Just then, the British government's very own Iceman entered the scene. He didn't even have the courtesy to knock the door this time.
"What is that you want Eurus? You don't want to kill me, or Sherlock hopefully, then what? Wait a minute. Rosie! ROSIE! Oh my God, please tell me she's still in her cot, safe and sound. I swear I'll slash your throat if anything happens to her!" John's face could probably be substituted by a tomato head at that moment.
"Time to get worked up, love."
The message read:
Eurus chuckles darkly as she starts stroking his cock. His length is not a size queen, but above average and it is huge, wide at the girth and has a pinkish hue. It's rather young, considering his age. His manhood is tantalizing, turning her on almost immediately as she licks her lips. She moves her hands back at the cock again, her thumb caressing the slit of the head ever so slightly. John involuntarily bucks up but is trying to control himself. Watching him struggle against his will and need is so beautiful.
as well.
“That's fortunate,” John says casually, blinking slowly and smiling warmly at the younger man in a way that he hopes is convincingly appeasing. Sherlock cuts his eyes away and sniffs.
the ability to press lips to him, but his brain is not fooled. His fingers don’t feel like John’s lips would, they can’t; they aren’t moist and they don’t yield. They can’t smile or whisper or pucker. That familiar agony swells in Sherlock's chest.
“It is sufficient to say that the affair the doctor
Sherlock doesn't meet my gaze. He still seems withdrawn and not interested in leading the questioning.
“Yes. Come on. I don't bite." She pauses and seems to consider her own words for a second as a mischievous smirk curls the corners of her lips. "Well, not unless you ask me to."
“Sherlock you bloody berk, this isn’t how it works,” John growls, twisting and squirming as they tangle around each other like some complex puzzle. “Just stop-” The muscles of John's arms and torso flex and Sherlock's mouth is watering with a need to taste. He is trying hard to maintain his efforts but he can smell John's skin; overtones of aftershave, deodorant and shampoo doing little to disguise that fiercer and elemental aroma of adrenaline and arousal. A chemical cocktail that stirs primal things from their dark hiding places inside Sherlock.
"So... you are... in fact... saying..."
