“Oh.” He muttered, still frozen in place. John shuffled, looking bashful.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well I don't know, now do I John? Otherwise I would have been doing said thing, which may or may not have included you. I loath repeating myself John. If this companionship is to continue, then I would highly recommend trying to keep up." He was sarcastic as all get out, which made John relax.
“Enough of that. Come over here, leave the robe on the chair.” John commanded, and Sherlock was more than eager to comply. He pulled his fingers out of his dripping hole and stood up, letting his open dressing gown fall to the floor. John turned his chair so that he was facing away from the table and Sherlock had enough space to get on his knees in front of him. Sherlock practically crawled across the floor towards him, crouching nude between John’s spread thighs. He peeked up at him shyly through his curls. For all his eagerness, he was still dreadfully inexperienced. It made him anxious to think about all of the other people who must have been better at it than him. John watched the anxiety flit across his face and leaned forward and cupped his jaw.
“Don’ stop..” he breathed quietly. John smiled at him.
“Right then, should I be calling you a ride home then?” He pulled his phone out of his pocket, going to dial the chauffeur, but John reached out and grabbed his wrist.
“Well,” He looked to his lap. “This isn’t really my area. Friendship, and all.” He fidgeted with his hands. John looked to his lap as well.
"Why are you taking me to a restaurant though?" John didn't quite know how to process this. It was borderline flirtatious, wasn't it? Taking him to this restaurant, paying, and he also bought his coffee yesterday. They only just met, and this boy was about to spend more money on him than his parents even for the monthly food trip for the entire family.
John slipped his cock back into Sherlock’s mouth and took a minute to work it back down. The water had cooled down Sherlock’s mouth a little, creating a delicious temperature change against his heated flesh. John pressed his cock further down Sherlock’s throat than he had gone, and held him there. Sherlock struggled in the hold, his breath blocked from half of John’s cock being shoved into his mouth. He started gagging and John let him up for a brief moment, only pulling out enough for Sherlock to draw a breath before shoving himself back in. Sherlock retched and dry heaved against John’s thrusts, his hands flailing desperately on his thighs.
“Oh come off it, I said I was sorry.” He giggled a tiny bit before sobering up. “No, he’s just an arse is all. Mum doesn’t care about piercings and tattoos and what not, just, you know, gay stuff. My dad is pretty conservative about everything. Kind of sexist too. He doesn’t think I should be friends with boys because he thinks that's why I’m trans.” Sherlock grimaced.
“Of course it's true. Do you think I would make that up?” He looked away pointedly.
After the two had scarfed down their not-quite-hot but not-quite-cold hot dogs and sipped at their room temperature sodas, Sherlock decided it was time to leave the museum.
“No, that my plan is working.” The old woman shook her head and waved them off.
“Not at all, just proving an idiot on the internet wrong about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.” He smirked at John over his shoulder.
He bit his lip and shook his head.
“We met on the train.” Was all he said. John let out a laugh.
And his heart was most definitely not supposed to be doing that.
“I dunno if half of that is true, but it's still damn amazing.” He laughed. Sherlock sniffed at him.
“There's someone here for you.” His sister yelled. John muttered out a weak ‘okay’ and sat up slowly, trying to minimize the pain in his ribs.
“Sherlock?” John knocked on his door. Sherlock yanked his hand out of his pants, slamming his head against the door in surprise, then cursing. John cracked open the door, peeking around to give Sherlock a curious glance. “You feeling alright?” He asked. Sherlock nodded, maybe too quickly.
“Yes please.” He whimpered, leaning into the other man’s touch and resting his hands dutifully on his thighs. John hummed and dragged his cock head across his cheek to the man’s plump lips.
“Yes, I can be good for you John.” Sherlock nearly whispered, his own smaller clit cock standing out and proud from his curls. He watched John’s hand stroke over his shaft, almost mezmorized. John brought the cock head close enough to Sherlock’s lips so that he could feel the heat, smell the precum oozing out of it, but not taste it.
He presses the phone back against his ear and waits for Bill to continue.
The hospital staff apparently doesn't trust him with glass or anything sharp or sturdy yet.
Holmes shakes his head.
It had made him feel even worse.
The smile is still on his face but the hint of sadness Sherlock saw earlier is also still there and so he finds that he still can't say no.
“I'm always alright.”
'A friend, John.' Another sigh.
Once again: I'd like to thank everyone who's read this story up to this point. Your comments and kudos mean the world to me.
His face was even paler up close.
He looks down at the cup of tea in his hands. He knows he should be drinking it but somehow he cannot bring himself to do so. By now the sun has completely set. The small room is lit by nothing but a couple of candles.
It's still so new....and fragile. He's afraid that if he holds it too tightly his clumsy fingers will drop it and it will break.
Brown paper bags containing sandwiches with cheese and a bottle of some kind of fruit-drink.
He rather likes being in close contact with Holmes.
“Where would you like to begin”, he says.
She doesn't ask about the party again.
I have spent an entire night thinking over.....whatever this mess of a situation I seem to have gotten myself in is.
Silently he prayed he would find him.
Just imagine what kissing John would be like.
John only talks to his usual friends. Which are all male. And he does nothing out of the ordinary.
Apparently they won.
How could he not have known.
Her own Death looks an awful lot like the soldier's Death.
And once again, since he has put this new experiment in motion, Sherlock wishes he knew how to flirt. He's so bad at this. Even if John did like him before, his utter lack of knowing how to handle relationships and the process of....what would you even call it.......courtship?.....will most likely soon turn him off of Sherlock.
The next coherent thought he has is of John laying naked next to him on the bed.
But this, tonight, this is premeditated. This took planning and giving it a name. Somehow it makes it a lot more real and real things have rules and rights and wrongs and I am  a lot more afraid of losing it......of messing it up.
John gives another chuckle but there's no light in it this time. The sound as dark as the sky around them.
Sherlock wishes they'd serve him some alcohol. Anything to numb the pain and make the afternoon slightly more bearable.
Mary did not seem to be taking the hint as she stopped right by the table where John and Sherlock were sitting.
Sherlock was just starting to contemplate whether he should try climbing inside through Johns bedroom window in order to get a closer look when the door opened again.
“You don't like....my face?”
My Soldier is tangled up in the sheets of the bed but his shoulder is still visible.
'Deal.'
I wish I hadn't left him there believing this was maybe not what I wanted.
Because, once the lights come back on, John's arm leaves my shoulder and I feel cold and alone even-though he is still basically sitting next to me.
John feels himself panicking as his worries from the previous night come flooding back.
They have history.....John and him.
This chapter gave me such a hard time. This is why the update took so long.
Just as well, John thinks.
'Oh, come on, Johnny. It'll be fun! I'll be there',  Mary's hand was on his arm now as she leaned over the table and as John looked up at her her chest was right in front of his face. She was wearing an extremely low cut top. Bent over the table like this not a whole lot was left to the imagination. John swallowed.
“I think you’d make a great surgeon. You’re kind, and you’re determined, and you’re smart. All that's left is an education.” He joked, looking at the display. John didn’t respond. Sherlock looked over his face and his heart dropped to his stomach.
He shut and locked the door behind him, barely making it to his bed before his face twisted up and he started sobbing.
“What else am I supposed to say? We met on a train, did we not?” John laughed again, then looked at Myrial who had a content smile on her face.
quiet, ‘of course,’ in response. As soon as they entered the room, John was bouncing around to every display. He chattered on incessantly about different practices and items and how things were used.
John woke to his alarm at 9 am and fumbled underneath his pillow for it. It had been a long night. He eventually fell asleep around 4 am, texting with Sherlock the last hour or so. The boy seemed to never sleep. They discussed their plans for the museum, John thought it would be best to wait until the house was empty before he left, so they agreed to meet at the museum around 11. John rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. His head hurt from crying all night and he was sure he looked like hell. His dinner plate was untouched and cold on his night stand. Sighing quietly he glanced over to his guitar, it was still broken, so there was no hope in playing it any time soon. He thought quickly to where the hot glue gun was kept in his house, but he wasn’t sure of he’d even have any glue to use. He got out of bed and walked over to his guitar. Opening the case and wincing.
“I love you.” Sherlock blinked up at him lazily. John grinned from the doorway.
. The thought sent another wave of arousal coursing through his body and his hips bucked slightly.
“C’mere.” John said, patting his thigh. Sherlock complied easily, shifting his hips to that he was leaning to the other side, his head soon in John’s lap. He stared up at John blearily, dissociated from the cough syrup.
, but you know how I love to be the center of attention.” He steepled his fingers under his chin and bat his eyelashes at her. Mycroft kicked him in the shin from under the table and Sherlock let out a hiss and glared at him.
“Children, that's enough.” Siegfried commanded sternly. Myrial decided this meant it was time for her to continue her interrogation.
“John’s still in his secondaries.” Sherlock spoke for him. John gave him a look of thanks but his mother spoke up, not even looking from the ham she was cutting on her plate.
, and looked about the science equipment and various experiments lying about the tables. He sniffed the air and wrinkled his nose. “Is that sulfur?”
“Yes?”
“Sherlock the first time you saw my room I was practically naked, even if it's terrible, it's an eye for an eye.” The taller boy gave him a sardonic smile and pushed open the door. John’s first thought was, yes it smelled slightly of sulfur, but the room was huge! There were clothes piled in the right corner, but everywhere else was filled with scientific equipment and long tables.
John pulls his cock out of his pants and Sherlock can see the leaking tip peeking over the top of the table. Sherlock in turn spreads his legs a bit, even though John can’t see him over the table. But spreading his legs for John makes the scene just that more erotic.
“Caring is not an advantage, dear brother.” Mycroft called over his shoulder, making his way to the door. “So make the most of this.” He was out the door before Sherlock could respond. But really, he had no response, so he just sneered at the door for a few minutes before looking at his phone.
“I asked if you wanted anything specific from tescos, I’m going after my shift on Wednesday .” He asked, drying his plate and bowl along with a few other things that had been left in the sink. Sherlock put another finger inside himself, and it gave him an idea.
“I guess it's time for you to go now.” Sherlock nodded and stood from the swing.
“It’s not a bad word, Sherl’. Not like you’re chaste anyways, if last night was anything to go by.” He looked back to his plate with a smirk, cutting up the sausage on his plate into small bites. Sherlock blushed and kicked John softly under the table. They eat quietly for a few moments before it dawned on John what Sherlock had inadvertently admitted to.
“John?” The boy looked up, startled.
“Ready, Mr. William?” He asked, putting out his butt in a can at his feet.
He’d fallen asleep with the binding on,
“Have a good night.” He replied, walking down the steps, glancing back at John who was still standing in the doorway watching him go. They waved at each other, then John forced himself to go inside. He was so glad he’d made a friend.
Dinner wasn’t… tense, perse. There was mild chatter from Mycroft and his father, Siegfried, about the current political climate. Sherlocks mother, Lydia, talked excitedly with the important staff that were invited to the dinner. But you could feel the tension at the table. No one wanted to address either boy, and for a while it seemed no one would talk to them for the entirety of it, but the chief maid, who also happened to be Lydia’s right hand lady, addressed John after the main course was almost finished.
I think 24(ish) hours is enough time to make you guys wait for this <3
"Walk in the park?" He suggested. Sherlock 'tsked'.
“I missed you”, he pants into the non-existent space between us.
It always made Sherlock feel better.
“Be right back”, he says, “with coffee!”
They are not who they used to be anymore.
'On one condition', a sly smirk spread over his mothers face as she said this and John felt his blood run cold again. Sherlock however seemed completely unfazed. John wasn't buying any of it, 'from now on your study sessions will no longer take place on school property, but at my house so I can keep a close eye on you and watch your every move.' Her gaze was solely fixed on Sherlock as she said this last part. No doubt trying to melt him where he stood with the pure acidity of her tone. Sherlock however just smiled. Mad bastard.
He heaved a sigh of relief when he found it firm and unyielding and the sound that drifted back to his ears told him he was standing on some kind of paved stone.
“Nah, mate”, he says, “I'm just humouring you in coming here.....honestly....this must be the absolute
But still.....
“I don't know....” he says.
“Piss off.”
It does nothing to lighten the growing unease that is building up inside of him.
“I thought you wanted to talk.”
It's not an actual dance but Watson doesn't need to know that.
He firmly closes both the compartment holding his belongings and his current thought-process.
A smile forms on her face as she runs her fingers across the jagged walls.
John sat down beside him.
John doesn't know what it means and yet......maybe he does......in his dream he does....but now.....not anymore.
Sherlock tries to smile at him again.
“He has a very strange birthmark”, he said and immediately bit his tongue at the inappropriateness of the comment.
“I work at a local coffee place”, he says, “that's where Detective Lestrade found me.....I  need that job so I can afford med-school.”
Not only to him but to Holmes as well.
Part of him thinks Holmes might be mad at him.
The crowd cheers and applauds.
“What are you smiling about?”
Rushing.
His brother had looked old that day. Far older than he had been. His shoulders had been hunched up high as he rested his elbows on the oaken desk he sat at. Sherlock had just been able to make out the tense frown on his face as he sat there, unmoving, in front of the only window in the room through which the gray outside world could just barely be seen.
Another bolt of lightning flashes through the darkened sky and makes the rain still streaming down behind his tall and slim silhouette seem like a curtain made out of silver and diamonds.
And so he pulls down Holmes' hands once again as he continues to pull him back. Back to the horses. Back to safety.
John doesn't know what to say and so he just doesn't say anything at all. Mrs. Hudson is a clever woman. She usually always knows everything that goes on in the household. He is just not sure how much she knows about his.....'friendship'..... with Holmes.
Someone.
“This.”
he thinks.
“You've come a long way”, Molly says, “you've gotten pretty good at acting.”
Another log breaks and falls to ashes in the fire-place.
activate it.....this puts him in an immense amount of danger.
Greg, seated next to him seems to have picked up on his unease.....and how could he not.
He can still feel John.
“You don't have one.”
I don't do well with endings.
She had a plan for him. A purpose.
If I am just hoping for something that's never going to happen I'd rather he just told me now before he sucks me in any further. Before I'm in so deep that I might not be able to get out again.
Sherlock feels awkward. Extremely self conscious. Out of place.....maybe....even though they are in his own dorm room.
So instead he just smiles and nods.
It's only a small fraction of the words he thinks of when it comes to his relationship with Sherlock but somehow they're enough.
“This?” John asks. His voice soft, a whisper that is felt more than heard above the sound of the rain.
Watson doesn't seem to notice.
He's waited so long for John. He doesn't want to rush a single thing about this.
They've talked a little bit, here and there, but on the whole they've been mostly quiet. Just enjoying each other's company.
Sound off in the comments!! I have plans for future chapters when it comes to the smexy stuff, and I would like some input from y'all. (most of this is already written, I just suck at posting schedules)
Breakfast.” Sherlock whined, shifting his hips subtly.
"If you two stain the sofa I will not be taking the blame for it." She sneered. John blushed to the tips of his ears and cast his gaze to the dirty shag carpet.
"Cocaine." Sherlock said. He had been wanting to answer John's question ever since he's asked it earlier in the day.
“I mean, you basically know my life story from just looking at me, and we’ve only known each other for , what, an hour or so? That’s bloody amazing, if you ask me.” John was being sincere. It struck Sherlock silent for a few moments.
“Yeah, well, we’ll just be going upstairs, mum.” John tried to shoo Sherlock to the stairs, but he was grabbed roughly on the arm.
“We have a microwave.” John counterd, arching a brow. Sherlock sighed in defeat, swallowing against the lump of anxiety in his throat.
“Should I head home?” Sherlock asked. John pushed himself up and shook his head.
“Yes, well what do you do for work?” Myrial asked. It seemed like she had made it her personal mission to make John talk at this dinner. The conversation between the father and son has come to a halt and all eyes were fixed on John, awaiting his answer. He swallowed the knot in his throat.
Hope you all enjoy!

So I tried to keep you out of my explicit thoughts, but I never quite managed to reign in my dreams. But even those weren’t very sexual, per se, just very intimate.”
"Um, I'll have a coke." His voice had gone to its natural high register in his nervousness. He swallowed, and looked down at the table cloth. The waiter nodded, jotting the drinks down and walking away.
“You misunderstand, I empathize with you, not pity you.” John snorted.
“For ruining Christmas, you twat!” John giggled underneath him, red faced. Pretty soon they were both in a laughing fit, wiping tears from their eyes. Sherlock sat back on his toes and let John sit up. They maneuvered so that they were leaning against the bed, feet stretched out. Sherlock’s almost touched the wall but John's legs were short and they only went to the middle of Sherlock's shins.
Sherlock chewed over the new information and had the decency to be slightly ashamed.
“Sherlock.” He called quietly. Sherlock woke momentarily with a sharp breath, his eyes not fully opened.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open at the conclusion his mind made.
“I dunno. At first I wanted to be a nurse. Well,” He grimaced. “My dad told me I would make a good nurse, that was after I told him I wanted to be a doctor for the first time. So for a while I kind of thought that I couldn’t be a doctor. Because I was a girl, and girls weren’t doctors. But, you know, recently, since I figured it out and everything, I think I’ve been leaning more towards surgeon. There’s just something so intimate about being able to fix people from the inside. And I don’t mean like, brain surgery and stuff. Just…” He trailed off. Sherlock hummed.
It was nearly 10:30, he was going to be late. He grabbed his long coat with the pockets and the chains and his heavy leather boots, dashing out of his room/lab and down to the garage where Chuck was having a smoke.
“I don't get it”, Sherlock says. Because there are a lot of things he doesn't understand. Things he doesn't know. For instance, how he'll be able to sleep knowing that when he wakes up in the morning he will not be able to go and see John. That the next time he might have a chance of running his fingers through course, short, blond strands of hair is months away and uncertain. He doesn't understand how John can still be smiling at him while the feeling of dread that has formed in his own lower abdomen has transformed from a soft, barely noticeable flutter into a lead weight that makes it hard to breathe.
Just a small flick of the reins is enough to make them go.
And of course, there's Molly.
Sherlock only shares one class with John and in that class John is seated next to Greg.
The arm around him pulled him just a bit tighter and a gentle kiss was placed on the top of his head. And from the back of his room he could hear the crocodile growl one more time before it slithered down the hallway and left.
He opens his eyes to look down and see what it is.
He knows exactly how to hide just so, so that John can't see him from where he's at work behind the bar inside.
I silently curse myself for still being as attracted to him as I am.
The crowd cheers and small groups of onlookers start pouring onto the field. Several members of the rugby team are being hoisted up on shoulders.
“And this will help us how?” for some reason all this talk of a wealthy young lady seems to rub John the wrong way.
Being out here, with John, it reminds him too much of the one other time he and John had been together like this in the morning.
We get to the schoolyard about ten minutes before school starts and there are groups of people scattered everywhere around the area.
'On All Hallows' Eve the queen and her consort will ride on horseback on a set route to the fairy-lands', Sherlock continued, 'once the horses start riding they will not stop so you will have to be vigilant and act quick.'
But if Sherlock doesn't care then....neither does he.
Be a boyfriend.
Enveloping Holmes' head as it streams out of his eyes, ears, nose and mouth.
Sherlock gives a needy moan.
Nothing good ever comes of them.
Holmes is still lying on his back on the bed. His chest rising and falling in a steady pattern. The flickering candles casting dancing shadows over his form.
Usually. But not today.
“I called Greg.......he laughed and then hung up on me.”
The afternoon sun shone down on his golden hair and it made him seem as if he was made out of sunlight itself.
Sherlock finds this particularly difficult because, not looking at John means looking at his bed....where he sleeps....or at his bedroom floor.....where pieces of underwear are strewn around haphazardly.......
it says.
It doesn't for me.
John giggled.
Because, after all, that is what love is all about. The total destruction of the object of your affection until there is nothing left. Love is final. Love is all consuming.
But back then, finding himself only at the first chapter of their joined story, he had felt more alive than he had ever been.
So, if that's the case, he figures he'll just choose a spot where John will most likely notice him right away. This way he'll be able to tell pretty quickly if John actually wants him there or not.....and if he doesn't.....he won't have to stay for the entire game if John doesn't want him there. He'll just go home before he embarrasses himself even further.
Because he's never had anything like this before.
John seems relieved. He's looking at Sherlock again now. The smile on his face a little bit wider. But just barely.
It is then that Holmes looks his way and spots him too.
I've left him over and over again.
Every sound was too loud. Even the rustling of the leaves overhead sounded to him as if hundreds of people were clapping their hands together violently making his ears hurt and his head pound.
He doesn't seem to care either.
He can't think straight.
He ends up falling asleep before he is able to decipher what it means.
my best friend.”
At anyone and everything. At the universe. At the unfairness of it all. At himself.
Sherlock doesn't quite know what to say. He's starting to realize that he had kind of forgotten what being this close to John was like. How blinding and all consuming it can be.
If they looked at his file they'd know he's not suicidal.
He feels like a total fraud.
He's only met with 'The All' once before. When he had just come into his magic. On his very first trip to The Order.
Today Sherlock had not been so lucky.
Pretty much like they used to do when they were still young boys.
Sherlock Holmes.
The pile of books that are still left unread has grown frighteningly small.
Mary is livid. She demands to know where he has been all  night.
'And because he interests you.'
I don't know and I'm too tired to try and make heads or tails out of it all.
No matter how painful, he will never be able to bring himself to forget about John.
But Sherlock's brother is still giving him that creepy vampiric smile. And he's also quite a bit taller than John....and older....and he's probably John's only way of actually getting to Sherlock at the moment. So, in the end, he just nods.
'I highly doubt the answer to question 18 is a horse with what I hope to god is just a very large fifth leg', the sound of Sherlocks voice startled John from his musings. As he looked down at his drawing and saw the ambiguous nature of what it looked like he quickly scratched it out in embarrassment, turning a nice shade of dark red that was actually pretty complementary to Sherlocks shirt. So much for art school.
So much that he wants to tell me but maybe can't. Or maybe hopes I'll guess....or just....
Finn Just nodded but did not reply so John continued speaking. Glad to  have finally touched on familiar territory for once.
'I do believe that's that matter sorted, I'll leave you be for the night. No doubt we'll meet again sometime.'
I pretend that the slightest touch of him doesn't heat me up more than any form of scalding liquid ever could.
There is no mist, like there had been the last time, no visions......nothing.
“I'm afraid not, Sir.....”
John snorted out a laugh as Sherlock grinned at him. Slightly stretching out that soft cupids bow as soft laughter lines formed at the corners of his mouth. It was a good look on him, John thought.
Unfinished, uncomfortable.....
“Ah, man”, Patrick says, “long distance is the worst. I feel for you man.”
It's intoxicating.
John had his legs stretched out in front of him as he leaned back on his hands. It was not an easy position to get out of quickly should the need arise, but he was not afraid.
That he hadn't gotten clean.
She looks so much older than she had seemed when my eyes were still closed.
“I know”, he says, “but....I just thought.....I don't know.....I miss spending time with you......how close we used to be......I miss you.”
He dared not think of what he would do if he came to their meadow and found it deserted except for the twittering of birds and the rushing of a gentle breeze.
, he thinks,
“See you tomorrow evening, yeah?” he asks as Sherlock walks by him.
And so I let my stars fall into dust and my ethereal light drift away on the draft that seeps in through the cracks in the walls, leaving them in darkness.
I have no idea if she knows that's what they call her and I'm starting to wonder if I, perhaps, should have told her before I dragged her into this whole mess.
She runs her fingers over them and imagines impaling Holmes' soft flesh on every last one of them.
Holmes rolls his eyes.
Once again: I would like to thank all of my lovely readers.
Stolen moments during a summer holiday in Bournemouth.
Miss Hooper bends herself even further over the table. Her voice no more than a soft whisper barely audible over the sound of happy music and pleasant conversation that surrounds them.
If only I had his number so I could call him and ask him.
There's also the risk of getting caught if they lounge around here naked while the rest of the household comes alive.
“Did I upset you?” He looked confused and scared for a brief moment until John shook his head.
No matter how fast he ran, how much weight he lifted, he always kept the pudge of hips and breasts underneath his clothing. But the bandages helped with that. He knew they were dangerous. His left shoulder always ached when he took them off, but the pain kept him in the moment. The flatter image of his chest kept him sane. And just to get back at his mother for cooing over his hair, he chopped it off and dyed it black, the pink stripe a jibe to his father, but it backfired immediately and he wasn’t able to wash it out completely. He tried to act like a boy, and dress like one, he really did. But his body fit weird under the boy clothes he tried on. They were too tight around the fat that haunted him, blatantly showing his curves and bust more so than girls clothes. He’d even been doing some voice exercises he found on the internet, to make his voice deeper. But it didn't work that well. So he just opted for staying silent most days. He didn't speak if there were more than 10 people in a classroom, in fear that they would misgender him behind his back. His teachers pitied him, thought he was shy or had a stutter, even though they hardly ever called him by his male name, let alone the right pronouns.
Oh my god y'all, it only took me three god damn years. I have been through a shit ton since I started writing this, and I am happy to report that my depression is on the decline, and I have a newfound passion for writing. Fucking finally.
“We can talk about stuff, you know. If anything is bothering you.” John replied earnestly. Sherlock nodded, bringing his fingertips up to his lips to nibble on them, tasting the residual cum on them. John’s eyes followed the movement, licking the bottom of his lip in response. Sherlock suddenly remembered his note about John’s visual stimuli, and kept a finger on his bottom lip as he spoke.
“To pity someone is to feel sorry for them, to empathize with someone is to feel the same way they do.” Sherlock stated. “Really, John. You’ve just earned A’s in all of your classes this term. You’re well on your way to sixth form, and earning a grant for university. I would think you would know the difference.” Sherlock took a long sip out of his lukewarm drink. John thought for a second, then looked up confused.
“It’s more of a courtesy, for her.” He mumbled, clearing his throat and flushing, adjusting the paper he was reading to cover his face from Sherlock’s view.
“John it's okay. I deduced this morning.” Sherlock inturupted. The smaller boy nodded and took a breath before unlocking the door with shaky hands. The door opened with a creak and instantly the smell of cigarettes and stale wine filled the air. John sighed and set his shoulders, leading the way into the house. His mother was on the couch with a cig pinched dainty between two fingers, and a glass of red wine clasped in the other. His mother looked up with a tired, drunk smile.
“Since when do you have a car?” John asked. Even from behind him, John could tell he was rolling his eyes.
It was at that moment that Sherlock realized two things:
“What about the museum? The one on fourth. They’re having an exhibit on modernised medicine that looks interesting. Theres also a free planetarium show at 2.” Sherlock gave him a look.
“Wait- Did you- Have you- Have you fantasized about me before?” John asked. Sherlock dropped his fork and wrapped his arms around his knees, planting his forehead into them and groaning, ears pink. John grinned widely at him. “You so have. Sherlock, you dirty bird.” He nudged Sherlock’s foot under the table with his own. Sherlock just groaned again.
“The beard, it didn’t, it didn’t make sense.” Sherlock muttered weakly, shaking his head, moving past John to the hallway. John stood aside, scratching his stubble absentmindedly, watching Sherlock wobble down the hall to his room, locking himself inside. John sighed, staring at the door for a while longer, frowning. Sherlock had been distant recently, extremely distant. John could at least always get some sort of annoyance out of him, but now he was lucky if Sherlock even made eye contact with him. John shook his head, walking into the bathroom, rubbing at the stubble on his jaw. He stared into the mirror and decided it was time for a shave. He ran the faucet, gathering his cream and his razor.
“It makes me feel good.” Sherlock admitted. “My body feels weightless, I’m not hungry or uncomfortable, I’m allowed to just exist in my mind without my transport getting in the way.” John nodded.
“How chaste.” He teased, biting his lip. John snorted and took a bite of toast.
“Yeah, me too.” He replied. Sherlock extended an arm, but it didn’t look like he was asking for a hand shake, so John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and gave him a hug.
John scooched up the bed until he was sitting in the middle of the bed and Sherlock crawled onto the bed after him. He reminded John of a panther, dressed head to toe in black, slinking towards him.
His constant masturbating was really throwing a wrench in the primary function of his transport, which was there to let his brain be capable of sustaining itself, and not much else. But if he tried to ignore the urge, eventually he’d end up squirming in his seat. A few times, he even left a wet spot on his chair after ignoring his needy cunt for several hours. John would call him on his squirming if it became too noticeable, and Sherlock would brush him off with lies of stomach related issues. So now, when John saw him shifting even slightly, he would escape to the kitchen, coming back with a tray of tea and toast. Sherlock would use this time to escape to his bedroom for a quick orgasm, but they were coming less and less quick lately. He used to be on a hair trigger, but because of the constant use, it now took him ages to achieve orgasm with just his fingers. And that wasn’t very good when he only had approximately 7 minutes from start to finish, excluding clean up time, to be back in the living room before John was done with tea. Sometimes, like right now, John would make them fried sandwiches. Sherlock liked ham and cheese, which would lengthen his time to 13 minutes, but even that mark was becoming more difficult to reach. Sherlock had just escaped the living room to do just that, not even bothering to move to his bed. Most of the time, like what he was doing right now, he would just lean against the door and slip his hand down his pants, for the sake of saving time.
The train was mostly vacant at this time of day, so Sherlock got lucky with a seat caddy corner to him. Perfect to observe without being seen, he let his curls drop over his face and pretended to be absorbed in his phone. The boy’s clothes were generically tailored to fit curves, show off a bust and a butt. Maybe they were purchased by mistake or handed down, but the wear of them insisted that they were at least a year old, and the way he was holding himself said he and his older sister had completely different body shapes, and that she would have been too vain to see him wearing her old clothes. Even before he transitioned.
Inside, John’s mother was snoring away on the couch so she wouldn’t be a bother. John almost didn't want him to go. Having a friend who wasn't judgmental was a relief. He didn’t have to walk on eggshells around the eccentric youth. He could just be himself, and that was refreshing. They paused at the front door, John's hand on the knob. Sherlock’s hand went on his shoulder.
“Well-” John is quick to defend. “I mean, I never thought you would be into anything like…
He took his neatly wrapped toast back to the sofa, sitting down with a creak in his hips. He set the package down on the coffee table, smoothing out the wrinkles in the paper with his fingers, frowning slightly at the white spots on his nails.
“Still could have gone longer.” Sherlock replied. John looked up at him with a small smile on his face.
.” he scratched the back of his head. Sherlock nodded.
“Um, right… Listen, Sherlock, do you think you could, I don’t know, go wait in the living room or something? I need to get changed and, well…” John scratched at the back of his head. Sherlock looked at him incomprehensibly, then promptly nodded and walked out of the room. Most certainly not wobbling from spinning in the chair.
“But i'm not a government official, or anyone important at all.” John stated.
His fingers teased his cock, dipping down into the slick of his hole and coming back up wet and slippery against his hard flesh. He was feeling an itch on the inside, he tried to reach it with his fingers, but despite how long they were, the angle was impossible for him to get to. He whined and clenched his teeth, fucking himself a little harder onto his fingers. Even though he couldn’t reach the itch inside, he was still so damn close to cumming
“You could have gone longer, if you wanted.” He mumbled back. John’s eyebrows shot up.
Sherlock obliged and kept his lips over his teeth and John thrust in deeper, nudging his soft palate. John slowly eased himself into Sherlock’s throat, spending long minutes slowly fucking his mouth before pushing deeper. John was so gentle with him, but the grip in his hair told him that John’s restraint was waning. He couldn’t wait for it to snap. Sherlock was comfortably taking him just as deep as he was the night before. He figured out how to time his breath with John’s thrusts, which were picking up pace as he pressed deeper. Sherlock gagged slightly and John pressed him down into it, cock leaking fluid down his throat and making him gag harder. But Sherlock wouldn't let himself be easily deterred. He let John gag him until he was dizzy, his eyes rolled back into his head and tears beginning to brim, before he tapped for a break. John let him pull off and catch his breath.
“I came up with it a year or two after I came out. I knew she was going to be the hardest one, considering how much she hates that I’m trans. So I asked Myrial and all the other staff to start calling me Willam, instead of Sherlock, around her. The idea was that the word association would change her view of Will from Willow to William, that’s another reason I chose that name, and she would start calling my William just by default. I didn’t think to calculate how stubborn she was, I mean I have to get it from somewhere, but I think it's finally working. This is the third time she’s slipped up and called me William just this year, I think maybe by the time I’m 30 she’ll at least be calling me that.” Sherlock looked so proud of his little scheme that it made John laugh a little. Even though it was sad that his mother was so adamant against her own child’s gender identity, it didn’t seem to bother Sherlock all that much. It just provided him with a challenge and a reason to complain from time to time, which was really all he wanted.
“Speak when you’re spoken to, Janey.” His father growled.
“Well, of course. If that's alright, I mean. If that’s what you want?” John turned and leaned against the cupboards.
“Look, I don’t need your pity, I threw the first punch, I can handle my own. This isn't the first time they’ve messed with me, and it won't be the last. I could have handled them.” John silently raged across the table. Sherlock shook his head.
“Oh.” Was all Sherlock could manage. John’s eye’s hardened slightly.
“You fucking cock slut.” John grunted, setting a brutal pace and forcing himself a few more centimeters in. Sherlock was openly sobbing, his hands staying clenched on his thighs. He coughed up throat slime whenever John would let him up for a breath, which was becoming less and less often. John was getting impatient, he was getting close and he hadn’t triggered the man’s gag reflex as hard as he wanted to. John wanted a mess to clean up afterwards. A big mess.
:”You’re important to me.” The statement hung there for a few moments, John’s face was slightly pink and Sherlock kept his gaze glued to the outside.
"Then why did you tell me?" John demanded. His voice got high and squeaky when he was upset, and Sherlock watched his body language completely change. He recognized the flash of dysphoria that tore through him. He'd felt that way about his own voice before. Sherlock took a deep breath, fighting the urge to just give up. It was bound to end up badly anyway.
“I can pay for it.” He offered, moving to grab his wallet out of his trench coat, but John stopped him.
"Nothing good." He said. But before John could ask him to clarify, he sat up on his sofa cushion, then leaped to his feet, grabbing John's hand on the way.
a sex drive?” he asked. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
It looked the same, none of the strings were broken but the bridge was snapped clean off. He wasn’t even sure if this was fixable and it filled him with despair. He pulled the mess out of the case and mourned it for a few moments. He’d never really been much of a musician, but something about the sounds he could pull from the strings was calming to him. He wasn’t too fond of singing, and couldn’t read music, but he enjoyed making up his own pieces. They were never the same, but the tones, keys, and tempos all reflected on how he was feeling. It was a coping mechanism. It was better than self harm.
“Hey, I’m kind of hungry, you game for the food court?” He asked. Sherlock nodded softly and the boys made their way to the cafeteria.
“I want to know what filthy thoughts run through that brilliant brain of yours. Right now that’s more appetizing that toast.” John challenged gruffly, giving his cock another squeeze. Sherlock noticed the movement of his arm and let out a small moan.
“That's all you’ve got to say?” Sherlock raised his hands.
So.. that was pretty intense. Idk if I should tag any trigger warnings? Let me know if one is needed. Like I said, I'm home sick. So tbh there's probably going to be some smut published by the end of the day. May or may not be our cute little trans boys here :3
“No sorry, do you want to go out to the patio?” He asked. Sherlock nodded, following John ad he got off the bed and made his way downstairs. Harry walked in the door as they entered the living room. She gave them a glance over and scoffed.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, handsome.” He said with a wink. Sherlock went scarlet and stood from the bed.
At the same time, Sherlock was fussing over which belt went best with his wallet chain. Really, it was ridiculous, John didn’t care which belt he wore. He probably won’t even notice.
“Yes.” Sherlock cut. Mycroft raised his brows at them one last time before leaving them be.
"Buying you lunch, of course. Can't have my new companion starving to death on my watch."
John combed his fingers through his hair and pulled back one side of Sherlock’s messily made bed. He snuggled down into the blankets and nuzzled his face into one of Sherlock’s pillows, inhaling the scent and relaxing against the mattress. It wasn’t long before he drifted off to sleep, surrounded by Sherlock’s scent and warm blankets.
“Gentlemen? I believe dinner is about to be served.” Came a light, slightly snooty voice from the main room. Sherlock tched and crawled towards the ladder.
The hair was dyed black with a pink streak at the bangs, but the streak was faded, obviously a regretted decision. Too feminine, he’d gotten teased. Considerably clear skin for a teenager, but bags under the eyes communicated a recent stressful event, but not school, judging by the way he was interacting with the man who just sat next to him on the bench. His behavior insisted that he was having a poor time with his family, specifically the men in his life. Sherlock was just getting to deducing lint patterns on his plaid shirt when the train came and the boy stood to get on it. Not thinking of anything except to examine this fascinatingly plain boy in front of him, he followed.
“Jo~hnn..” Sherlock moaned softly, causing the man in question to bite his lip.
“You’re so good for me, Sherlock. Look at you, choking so pretty on me, keeping your hands to yourself. I don’t think I’d ever need to restrain you, you’re such an eager slut. You’ll stay where ever I put you, even if you can’t breathe.” John enunciated this by forcing his cock another centimeter down Sherlock’s gullet and pinching his nose shut. Sherlock stared at him in aroused shock for a few moments before he started panicking. He slapped his legs and dug his nails into his skin, but never reached for John or tried to pull away. John counted to thirty and yanked out of Sherlock’s throat with a harsh tug of his hair. A small stream of bile followed and dripped down John’s cock. He grinned at the sight Sherlock made, naked and kneeling at his feet, willingly being choked out, and practically begging to be forced to puke on his cock.
“Hi there, did I interrupt something?” John raised a brow. The older boy shook his head and motioned for them to go inside.
“Oh my, I mean, yes. That's perfectly fine. Such a respectable young man.” Sherlock had worked his charm to the best of his abilities, and seeing that it was a success, he dragged John into the patio before his mother could yell again.
(See the end of the chapter for
They meandered the park for the good part of three hours, just talking about nonsense. Sherlock deduced the lives of several strangers, and John saw no flaws in the deductions and facts. Eventually John’s chest started getting sore, so they made their way back to his house. When they arrived, his mother's car was parked on the kerb, making John anxious.
“You sure? There isn’t some sleeping disorder making a come back from your childhood?” John pressed. Sherlock looked away, flushing slightly.
“William, where did you meet this fine young lad?” John smirked and looked over to the boy in question.
“And a laundry bin.” John added.
“Go on.” He commanded, leaning back in his chair and palming himself through his briefs.
“I apologize, I spoke without thinking. I did not intend to  offend you in any way.” He said quietly. John shrugged slightly.
Mental health is strange. Here is a very long chapter of smut.
“Let me go.” John said steadily.
“Sherlock?” John looked up at him through half lidded eyes and bit his kiss swollen lip.
“What do you mean you don’t like holidays. You changed your jewelry and you’re wearing a Christmas shirt. I mean it's quite ghastly, but it still qualifies as Christmas.” Sherlock rubbed his face with his hands dramatically.
This is the final chapter in my Glitter of Broken Bottles series. FYI I also wrote a Christmas side story for this AU, if you want to go read that 0.0 Theres a descriptor of Sherlock's room, no spoilers for this fic.
“Jane, you lazy shite.” Harry screeched through the door. John just groaned louder and rolled onto his stomach, before gasping at the sharp pain in his chest.
“Ngh, wha~?” he muttered unintelligently, rubbing clumsily at his eyes.
“Breakfast?” He asked. Sherlock nodded, still staring at John with a wide eyed expression, a small blush dusting his cheeks. “What do you want?” John asked softly. Sherlock swallowed and shrugged slightly, ducking his head under John’s chin. John chuckled at him and continued stroking his tender flesh. Sherlock threw a long leg over John’s and gave a lazy thrust at the thigh in between his legs before yawning. John couldn’t reach the bud of flesh from their new position so he settled for stroking up and down Sherlock’s back. They were still and quiet for so long, John thought Sherlock might have fallen back asleep.
“I like you, John.” He blurted out. “More than a friend, I mean. I mean I-”
“I think about how you would touch me. Sometimes soft and inquisitive, explorative, with quiet words and slow strokes of your fingers. But most of the time its rougher. I think about you punishing me for following you to the park toilets, watching you, not being able to stop myself from mastubaring in broad daylight to the scene.”
"Honestly John, why would I make the walk all the way from my house to yours to watch telly?" John leaned back against the sofa cushions and looked at the ceiling.
"There is no way I'm older than you. That's... just not right." Sherlock looked almost surprised now. Apparently he had thought he was older than John as well.
“What’s up?” he asked. Sherlock traced his bottom lip with the tip of his finger, watching John try and fail not to stare at his mouth. He bit his lip, John mirrored his action slightly, eyes flicking back to Sherlock’s to check if he’d been caught, but Sherlock looked away, sighing.
"Well what on earth do you want me to do about it?" He asked, smiling lightly.
“I’m surprised you let me go on for as long as I did last night.” John mused as he set the table with forks and knives. He loaded sausage and toast onto a plate for Sherlock, piling the eggs on his own. Sherlock nibbled his lip and looked down to his feet, knees pulled to his chest.
Sherlock woke up in his bed several hours later, the mid afternoon sun filtering through his curtains, warming the duvet that was tucked over his body to a pleasant temperature. He was curled around a pillow, legs wrapped around it and all. He realized John must have removed his shoes and belt before putting him to bed, the thought made heat creep up his neck and a small smile grace his lips. The door was left cracked open, and beyond it, he could hear John tapping away at his laptop in the living room. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed, reveling in the comfort of his feathery bed and the reassuring domestic sounds of his flatmate. He must have dozed a bit more, because when he opened his eyes again, the sun was lower in the sky, casting the room in a soft gold. John was setting a glass of water and an aspirin on his night stand, he turned to look at Sherlock, hands on his hips, expression un-readable. Sherlock’s half open eyes were hidden behind his hair, he used this to his advantage, observing John. He stood next to Sherlock’s bed for a few minutes before biting his lip, cautiously reaching towards his face. Sherlock quickly shut his eyes just in time for John to smooth his hair out of his face. John’s fingers didn’t stop there, lightly tracing over his cheek bones, running a finger down his nose and back, and then he was tucking a fallen strand of hair behind his ear. Sherlock couldn’t fein sleep any longer, not with John petting him like that. Sherlock opened his eyes, taking in John who was leaned over the edge of the bed, almost hovering over him, cupping his jaw tenderly.
“None of your business.” He walked over the the half wall that led up to his bed and grabbed at the belts he was pondering. Mycroft scoffed at him.
"I'll pay." He said casually. John tried to sway him but after just one attempt he realized there was no refusing, and then when he tried to suggest the cheapest place he could, Sherlock scoffed and pulled on his jumper sleeve, leading him into a semi fancy restaurant. The hostess gave them an odd look as they walked in. Massively tall Sherlock with his trench coat and piercings, followed by the devastatingly short John in his plain looking jumper and pyjama bottoms. He was sure they made quite the sight. But she quickly schooled her features into a smile, leading them towards a table buried all the way in the back by the kitchens. Sherlock didn't seem put off by the obvious feeling of unwelcomeness, he seemed to bask in the privacy.
But far from dull and boring. It smelled like John, it looked like John. This was where John was created. Sherlock inhaled and pulled the desk chair out of its nook, managing to sit cross-legged on it, despite his lanky limbs. Today he sported a dark purple beanie(or maroon, it was too dark for John to tell from a distance) along with several facial piercings he hadn’t noticed the day prior. A small ring in his left brow, two balls on either side of the bridge of his nose, a simple silver ring on his right nostril, two similar rings on the left side of his bottom lip, and his ears had more than John could count. His left ear had silver rings all the way up to a bar through the top, whereas the right only had a chain connecting from a second hole to a cartilage piercing. Small gauges were in both, one had the image of a bee, and the other a magnifying glass. He was breathtaking. Sherlock must have noticed him staring.
“Oh bollocks, are you sick? Why didn't you tell me?! Let me go grab some medication from the cupboard.” John trotted off to the bathroom before Sherlock could dispute. He shook his head, standing from his chair and stretching, several bones cracking. He let John pour a shot of cold medicine down his throat and swallow a fever reducer, it would only help him sleep, later. John turned on the telly to some sci-fi show that he liked, sitting at the far end of the sofa. Sherlock wanted the blanket that was draped over the back, so he curled up in the other corner, pulling the afghani over him. Though he was eating regularly, he was still severely underweight for his age and height, which meant he was always so bloody cold. John was right, he can’t just survive on toast, but it was just so hard to eat anything else. John had dragged him to Angelos the other night, and he barely managed to clear a quarter of his spaghetti. John smiled at him in understanding, getting the rest to go and feeding it to Sherlock for lunch over the week. Sherlock was eternally grateful for John. Despite the recent development of his libido, and his thoughts about John being none to platonic, the man was still his best friend. They’d been through so much together. Years of cases and inside jokes, sharing the rush of the game, what they had was something they couldn’t get from anyone else. And after Sherlock dying and getting tortured for three years, and John’s failed marriage and the miscarriage of his daughter, their bond was unbreakable.
“Well, that’s going to take some practice. I don’t think anyone has ever taken me all the way to the base.” John admitted sheepishly. He’d always felt bad about the size of his dick. He didn’t like hurting people. But then he found people who actually wanted to be hurt, and his sex life improved stupendously. But Sherlock was damn near a virgin, and he
“Why do you do it?” His voice was soft, Sherlock almost didn’t catch the words. He shifted his stance, folding his arms.
After they finished their drinks, Sherlock asked for his phone. They exchanged numbers and Sherlock disappeared down the street with a flourish of his coat and a jingle of the silver chains. John just stood and watched after him for a few moments, mesmerized. He was so bizarre, and at first glance, he looked like a murderous psychopath, but his eyes were so beautiful and pained. His hands were cautious and gentle, but rough from wear. And damn it all, John needed a friend. He needed someone who understood his pain without prejudice, someone who didn’t think he was being petty, who knew his self loathing lied further than typical teenaged vanity. And Sherlock was right. About everything.
“I want to.” He stated. John chuckled at him.
“That's my actual room technically. This was the nursery when Mycroft and I were younger. By the time I was grown enough to not have a Nanny, Mycroft was already at boarding school and I had well developed my… Talents, as they call it. So Mummy had a loft built so I couldn't use the majority of the space for a lab.”
"But I wasn't high when I met you." He was quick to reassure. John bit his lip and nodded. They both looked down to their laps. It was beyond awkward, Sherlock was regretting his decision of telling John, because what was he trying to gain? It's not like he was wanting to be stopped, it wasn't a cry for help. He wasn't that mediocre and pathetically predictable. He just felt like John should know. After all, they'd become fast friends. And friends deserved to know the worst about each other.
“How are we?” John asked, letting Sherlock up after a few more minutes of retching on half of John’s length.
“I hate bullies.” Sherlock replied simply. John furrowed.
“You underestimate my sex drive, John.” He replied, very proud of how strong his voice came out, despite the fluttering in his stomach from being so bold. John put down his cutlery.
Sherlock gave another pleased hum and sank deeper into the water. John mopped up the kitchen and got changed into some pyjamas, pulling out a pair of soft plaid pants and a big t-shirt for Sherlock. He walked back down to the bathroom after a half an hour had passed, Sherlock was dozing in the tub. He gently roused him and got him dried off before dressing him in the comfy clothes he’d gotten out. The two of them curled up on the sofa and watched a movie. John gathered them several things to snack on and a pitcher of water for them. They spent the rest of the day lounging and watching films, cuddling and sharing long intimate kisses, hands never still.
“Well, I haven't any dolls to play with. Don’t blame me, blame my awful caregivers.” Even though the statement was meant to be charming and playful, the truth behind it left a bitter look on Sherlock's face. John still laughed good heartedly. They sat for a minute in silence.
"And what if I wanted the lasagna?" He asked.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock. You know, I am working on your mother. She slipped up the other day and called you William. Your plan seems to be working.” She gave him a wink and he beamed.
“I do want that.” Sherlock nodded. John gave him an award winning smile and crossed the small space between them, cupping Sherlock’s jaw and pulling him up for a kiss. Sherlock thread his fingers into John’s short hair as they pulled away, foreheads resting together. Their breakfast started to burn and John only just managed to save it before it became completely inedible.
“Well of course, silly. I like spending time with you. You’re like minded and actually want to be my friend. Not to mention you’re pretty intimidating so people don't try to pick on me.” He stated sheepishly. Sherlock hummed and took a drag. The sun was starting to set and John let out a sigh.
alone, and take you and your gaggle of morons elsewhere. It would benefit you profoundly if you kept your mouth shut during your departure, and never speak down on anyone who is going through something your tiny nitwit brain can’t accept, ever again.” He shoved the boy against the window one last time, making his head smack with a velocity that would have knocked him out cold if he weren’t running so high on adrenaline, before backing away, letting the boy drop into a terrified slump. He stared up at Sherlock with tears running down his face for five seconds before he scrambled to get up and leave the train.
“Except normally you just call me a twat.”
“Well what do they normally say?” He asked, smirking.
"But... You said I was right about your schooling..." John laughed.
“I have for a while. I just, I thought that you wouldn’t return my sentiments, so I kept them to myself. I didn’t think you were interested. And- and Sherlock, I’m so happy just being here, and having you, being around you. It didn’t matter that we weren’t snogging, it was enough just to be next to you. You’re enough.” John stopped himself at that. Sherlock pulled back enough to look up at John’s face, eyes red. John couldn’t help kissing him. Sherlock’s hands threaded into his hair, and soon enough Sherlock was on his back with John between his legs, looming over him. They kissed for several long minutes, trying to convey anything and everything without words. John pulled back when the stirrings of an erection became prominent. If he got hard now, they wouldn't be leaving bed for quite a while, and he was hungry. Sherlock seemed to have other ideas, wrapping his impossibly long legs around John’s waist and bringing their hips together and pulling his head down for another kiss.
“Annoy my brother. It’s his only day off, I like to keep him working, ‘least he go soft.” Sherlock smirked as John shook his head.
, Sherlock thinks. The bandage would harm his ribs if he wore it for too long. Sherlock scowls as he gives the Brulidine tube to John, who has been gently brushing rocks out of his palms in the lukewarm water of the sink. Sherlock watches John's hands as he works, they are gentle but firm, small but useful. Just like the boy himself. After a few minutes of coating and plastering, John turns the water off with the tips of his fingers, handing the box back to Sherlock wordlessly. He took out two pills and handed them to John, then put everything back in its compartment and closed the case, discretely slipping a hundred pound note into the middle of the binding bandage. He carried the case back to their table, despite John’s grumble that he was perfectly capable of doing it himself. On the way back, Angela sent Sherlock a secretive wink and brought out refills for their half empty drinks. The booth was silent again.
“I knew you wouldn’t, and I‘m not asking you to.” John nodded. Eventually Sherlock sat down on the bench again, this time less hunched. They sat for a few minutes just thinking, then John stood up and reached for his hand.
“I guess, there's something.” he responded. John looked back up to his eyes, brows furrowing.
The next day, after several amazing deductions and another fabulous chase through the city, they caught the 55 year old canibal. He had tried to skip town, but had stupidly used his credit card to buy a train ticket, they arrested him at the station. But neither John, nor Sherlock, had any information on the man with the neck tattoo. Sherlock would never tell John, let alone Lestrade, where he knew the man from, and it wasn’t like he even spoke to the man, outside of being invited to join their sexual activity. Sherlock had ran through the scene several times, but it was difficult to focus on specific details of the man, when he was constantly distracted by John. Not to mention, his main focus had been on John at the time, and while he’s normally able to record things to analyze later, the arousal during the moment had tinged the memory. It was like someone had burned away at the edges of a photograph, just enough to distort the images anywhere but the focal point, which was of course, John. And almost every single time he would try to analyze the memory, he would end up becoming aroused, and he would have to take care of it before it became a problem, which it would, if left unattended to.
And I know I should ask him.
A couple of boys in the back of the class snicker. It's the usual reaction I get at the mention of my slightly unorthodox name. I've had it for over 16 years now so I probably should be used to it by now. But I'm not. The sound of their laughter like tiny pinpricks to my already tense nerves.
John ponders over what his friend has just said and all of a sudden he has a completely new revelation.
'Oh, just delightful', he'd said with mock enthusiasm, 'two weeks forced to spend quality time with my family. It'll be heaven I'm sure.'
John.
“Sorry”, John says again, to no one in particular, and picks up the phone.
And, indeed, after another sip of his tea Holmes does continue talking.
John glances over at our table and he gives me this shy half-smile as our eyes meet and now there's an entirely new sensation forming in my stomach and I'm suddenly glad I haven't eaten yet.
We were three in those hotel-rooms.
“Are you attracted to me?” is what he asks.
Stealing the rest of his unspoken words from him.
Things aren't complicated at all.
“I'd never ask you to be that. All I'm asking for is time.......time to....figure myself out.....figure us out.”
Mary gives him another tight smile.
Full of regret.
Sherlock had no clue what it all meant. He didn't like not knowing. So he had gone back to the mist to find information.
Finally they reach Sherlock. Molly and the soldier.
'I needed you.'
He smiles at her as she fidgets with his fringe. Tucking a lock of his hair behind his ear.
He crushes his lips to Sherlock's in a fevered kiss fueled by fire and lust and wanting and.....
His name is Victor and his lips are soft and his hair is dark and short. His hands are on Sherlock's hips as they sit on his bed.
'If they kill every single soldier then who is left to pass the stories on', he had said.
What if Sherlock wasn't there.....
Gods, how Finn loved those freckles.
His hips thrust forward again.
I try to smile back at her but my mouth has gone dry and my tongue has become this heavy thing I can't quite seem to control.
“How do I look?”, he finally asks.
He does not want to think about Sherlock right now.
John let out a small startled yelp and he felt shame rise up inside him once again as the sight of his master made his heart beat slightly faster and a warm feeling spread through his chest.
Ever since that day when Mycroft had found him amidst the trees, shivering, wet and exhausted he had not been able to get truly warm ever again.
He takes the picture in his hand.
This time it actually is Mycroft.
Far away from the ballroom and the nobles who do deserve to be there.
And: if most of you just decide you hate all of this I will gladly delete it again and pretend it never happened.
Together they weave a spell. Sitting on the floor, side by side, Sherlock's small hands following along in the pattern that his brother's long fingers weave in the air.
John also has the strangest feeling that he's seen this man before but he just can't quite put his finger on where that would have been.
Some people do say things about John but never really to his face.
This isn't the end of the world.
He just smiles that polite smile he gives her every time she talks to him and my mother practically melts at the sight of it.
Maybe I'm the oil-slick of John's life.
(See the end of the chapter for
He is very good at ending things.
The new customer is a man in his late twenties or early thirties with a surprisingly silver shade of hair.
He doesn't tell Kitty any of this.
John knew he should get up, but somehow he couldn't quite bring himself to do it. He convinced himself it was because of Sherlock's hands holding him down in the small of his back although there was barely any strength to the grip at all. If he wanted to he could break the loop of the alpha's arms quite easily. If he wanted to....
Yes! Another update!
Morgana scuttles closer. Careful to keep her body hidden in the shadows and dark corners of Holmes' mind.
I plan to make a hasty retreat as soon as I can but it appears that Andrew is not done with me yet.
His mind playing tricks on him probably.
Halfway between the warm golden light of the two lovers and the cold unfeeling darkness that creeps up on them.
Morgana watches Holmes from a dark corner of his mind. She will creep back to her spiderweb soon but for now she has grown tired of that vantage point.
And after a couple of moments of silence he adds:
Another, properly lit, cigarette is held loosely between Sherlock's long and elegant fingers.
At the moment the teacher, Mr. Sanderson, has his back turned towards the class. He is writing down some sort of equation on the blackboard.
It is well after midnight.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tries not to look at John's house before quickly getting into the car.
He coughs again.
He never thought there would come a day where he'd miss the Indiana summers.
The man's tone of voice is loud and cheerful and Sherlock knows he does it just to annoy him.
In his mind and heart he felt doors closing he had probably kept open for far too long.
When the evening drew near once again John could not prolong his stay any longer. Not if he didn't want to risk being forced to stay inside for another month. He did not think he could bear another 30 days away from the sun, the wind, riding his horse in full gallop.....from Sherlock.
Memories.
Nobody.
His eyes.
Why can't he keep his fingers still.
“Thank you very much for the cookies and tea”, he says and then leaves.
And so John just nodded and started leading the way across the driveway to the front door.
“Again?”
“God knows you need it. The test is on Monday and Sebastian left with the answers”, Sherlock says with a mischievous smile on his face. John would like to kiss it until it's gone. It might take some time, but he's a patient man.
He had not been allowed to talk to anyone.
“I'm sorry, who are you calling for?”
He said he would.
John wasn't sure if Sherlock meant then.....or now.
With shaking fingers he first traces his own face and then John's.
“I love your nail-polish”, he says, “but that's not the point.”
She just looks.
Just great.
Sherlock wants to say something else. Something biting. Something with icy cold teeth. Something that will shock John and convince him to stop this charade and let Sherlock out.
****************************************************
Sherlock kept his eyes closed. He needed to get her out of here. And fast.
It was a strange feeling. Something he had never really felt before and he would rather die than tell Finn anything about this.
None of this is real.
Relearn his best friend in a new and exciting way.
“Not yet”, Finn says, “you have to see the openings in The Veil as openings in a sieve. Water or small particles may pass through but stones will stay inside. She is a stone. Too powerful to pass. Too rooted to where she resides now....but give it time.....she might be able to  make a hole big enough....we'll all be in trouble then.”
John briefly contemplates just turning around and walking away but then the stranger finally does say something.
". Up to this point he had not been in any fights outside of the rugby field. But sitting at the table in the small coffee-shop, looking up at Sebastian's fake smile he felt his reserve crumble.
He had not listened and now it might cost him dearly.
“All done, sir”, she says. A radiant smile on her face. In another life he might have kissed her like he had kissed Mary. But not in this one. He realizes that now. No matter what you would like to prove. You cannot change who you are.
With every new song that starts he moves slightly closer to me.
John hands me one of the mugs and I take it from him carefully.
Still....wants me.
he thinks. Sherlock bites his lip and John swallows.
In his mind he gathered every single spell he knew that would produce some form of light or flame and as he grabbed Morgana's hand he pressed it against his face and released them all.
Even though it hurts he can't help but smile now too as the memories come back to him.
His eyes two pinpricks amidst the sickly white complexion of his face.
If I give a reply at all it's some kind of unintelligible mumble because he seems to have stolen all of my words.
(See the end of the chapter for
If he had had his wits about him he would have never have said yes.
For a moment I think it's Andrew and a sense of panic rises from my abdomen to my throat and temporarily steals my breath.
When he had finally been able to open his eyes after what had seemed like an eternity of fragmented darkness the unfamiliar room had just added to his confusion.
If he's driven her around in his car.
He shivers as the cold tingling at the back of his neck makes its way down his spine. Suddenly the feeling that they're being watched overwhelms him but when he turns himself around in the saddle there is no one there. Just the empty road bathed in the light of the summer sun.
“I.....”, John says, ready to say no....say he shouldn't....but then he realizes that maybe a drink is just what he needs. Maybe that will calm his nerves. Help him get rid of this strange feeling he gets whenever Holmes leans over to talk to him. So instead of finishing his sentence he just nods.
“It's probably how Finn introduced himself to her”, Holmes replies.
Not what I was expecting at all.
I quickly turn it off.
“I was looking at your face”, I reply.
A small space they have carved out and claimed only for themselves.
“How do you know?”
“You need this more than me”, the soldier says, “if that man comes back I want you to be protected.”
John sighs and Sherlock closes his eyes.
At the thought of Sherlock with someone else....some strange unknown face.....touching him....kissing him......making him moan in that special way he does when John gets it just right......someone else seeing him like this.....loose.....relaxed.......
Sherlock decides to give her the warmest smile he is able to conjure up considering the circumstances.
He sighs a heavy sigh as he looks sideways at John where he is seated next to him.
“I....”, he says, as Holmes sways them softly from side to side, but then stops himself again. Maybe words are not what they need right now.
But at the time I did not see another way.
And as time went on the most extraordinary thing happened. Slowly, but surely the walls Sherlock had built up so carefully around himself were coming down.
“John! Put me down!” he whined as John stood from the bed. John swatted his ass cheek and carried him out the door and into the kitchen, making Sherlock yelp again but stop fussing. He didn’t even want to complain after noticing his view of John’s backside. John set him down in the kitchen chair, shivering at the chill in the air of the flat. He walked back to Sherlock’s room and grabbed his dressing gown and pulled on his own pants. He tossed the article of clothing at Sherlock before gathering what he wanted to make breakfast.
“I was never raised to be a very emotional person, John. I don’t think I’m capable of understanding a lot of how you think and feel. That’s mostly because you think and feel differently than any average person I’ve met. I don’t know how to calculate your reactions to things because they are unique to you, and not the average person. But at the same time, you’re normal and predictable. You’re a complexity John. I look forward to figuring you out.” John was speechless. He didn’t talk for a long time and Sherlock was starting to get worried.
“It's okay, I know how you feel about Christmas.” John took a step forward and held the box out further until it was right under Sherlock’s nose.
"Sherlock what are you doing?" John asked.
"Gardening, cooking, shopping, arts and crafts?"
"Why wouldn't I take you to a restaurant? It has better quality food than any of the other health code violations on this street, based on our appearances and this establishment's clientele, I knew we would get a semi private booth so that we could talk in peace. Because I imagine the topic of our gender will eventually come up today, and just in case it happens while we're eating, I thought you would be more willing to talk while out of earshot of the general public." John took a moment to chew on the information, and just as he was about to respond the waiter came to their table to ask for their drinks.
“Of course I do, how else would I have figured it out?” He asked, taking another bite out of his sausage.
“Why are you doing this?” John asked. Sherlock looked up from his drink and stared into John’s eyes, they were a weird color of blue, almost grey. And the blackness of his dyed hair only enunciated them more.
“John please can I suck your cock?” Sherlock asked breathlessly, practically drooling over the sight of his leaking cock head. John grinned darkly at him, pushing his chair back and letting his legs fall open so that Sherlock got an eyeful.
"Sherlock, honestly, it's fine. He's just a waiter."
"Oh I am so sorry about that, sir!" He exclaimed, looking extremely guilty. "Um, I'll get your food out as soon as possible... Again I'm so so sorry." John smiled to put the poor man at rest.
“I know it’s big love, I don’t expect you to go down all the way.” He murmured, thumbing his jaw. Sherlock glowered at him.
“Oh Will, this is the friend you’ve been telling us about?” She stuck out a dainty hand with bright red polished nails. John didn't know whether to kiss it or shake it. Luckily Sherlock blew right past her, grabbing John’s arm and dragging him along with.
