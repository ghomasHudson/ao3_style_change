"Hey, hey, hey. Shh. Steve, look at me. Okay? Look at me. I want you to listen very carefully. It's okay. I don't blame you. And you shouldn't blame yourself either, alright? I want you to answer something for me," Tony said and Steve nodded quickly.
When Sam leaves, Natasha wastes no time in beating about the bush and goes in straight for the kill.
There was simply no winning this one. He couldn't break down the doors; he knew how difficult they were to break (they didn't) because he built them. And he knew that JARVIS couldn't be overridden because he was fulfilling the reason for which he was built: looking our for his creator.
meant to use Steve like that, and it wasn't supposed to last all that long, really, not when he and Pepper were still sorting out things between them, but then he had fallen for Steve as time went on, and Steve was unaware of that little bit of information, if the fact that he went out to dinner with Sharon was anything to go by.
what she was doing when she let it slip) they're not at all surprised when Steve takes the pregnancy test and it's positive.
"Of course I know that, I'm Tony Stark. I'm freaking awesome. I'll make coffee every day if it means a pre-breakfast makeout session," Tony said with a slight scoff to which Steve rolled his eyes.
He's stunned that Steve had the audacity to speak to him like that and behind him, he can hear Rhodey snickering. He totally forgot that Rhodey was with.
When Tony looked up at him with a glare, he knew he was gone for, because frankly, Tony wasn't exactly that threatening in the state that he was in. If anything, Tony was like a small, angry little kitten. An adorable kitten that wasn't his right now.
They chose a table near the window and sat down, Steve on one side and Barnes, surprisingly, sat down next to him.
"Listen, I'm sorry. My friends tell me I can come off as a bit of an ass. But I'm trying to be nice, well,
He's sure that if he had to spend time in the tower doing absolutely nothing while he waited for the next self-made villain until they decided that they wanted to attack the city, then he'll go completely crazy.
He feels himself panic, and his heart feels heavy all of a sudden. Because he didn't tell Tony that tonight, it was something that he'd whispered to Tony after, when they were laying in bed all sweaty and glowing. Tony had gone still and then scoffed. But he had seen the happy look that Tony's face had made. His promise hadn't been fulfilled then, because not even two days later Tony catches him having dinner with Sharon.
"Fine, whatever. Wanna hear what Clint had to say?" Tony asked, giving up on getting Steve to react the way he wanted. It was hard to get a rise out of Steve when the blond wasn't fully paying attention. Or when he knew what you were trying to do. And Steve was oddly good at reading whenever Tony was messing with him.
And who will only continue to suffer, seeing as they weren't together anymore and now had to parent a daughter that they had together.
Tiberius Stone stands behind him, hands pocketed in his slacks, body language nonchalant but he's betrayed by the smug look on his face.
And so, as with everything, Steve loves the fact that he is the only one who gets to see Tony first thing in the morning. He loves seeing Tony wake up next to him, all sleepy soft and hair product-free, curls mussed and hanging over his eyes. He makes sure to have a pot of coffee already made and a mug waiting on the marble kitchen counter after his run for whenever Tony decides to stumble out of bed.
He got into the elevator and the doors closed behind him, JARVIS immediately knowing where he was headed to. He closed his eyes and sighed, suddenly feeling exhausted.
"No - I - no. I miss you, Steve. So much," Tony said, "I don't want them. I need you, Steve," Tony choked on a sob.
Tony moves further into the room, moving closer to the bed until he's less than a foot away. And then he decides 'fuck it' and sits on the edge closest to Steve.
She left and returned with their coffees, leaving them with another smile and a request to call her if they wanted anything else.
"I call bullshit. Alright? Listen, I know that things aren't the best right now, that this is less than ideal and was totally something we didn't plan, but I'd like to think that after spending some time together -" he refused to say dating. That was part of the 'no territory' section in the talking department. "-that you aren't
And Steve feels that he's depended on Tony too much in the last two days. He needed a break. He needed to learn to do things by himself.
"It's all part of the recovery process. Depression is a pretty annoying thing to have, not fun, Steve, trust me. Neither is PTSD, my shrink told me I had that too, but if you ask me, it wasn't that hard to self-diagnose after the whole Chitauri attack. From now on, if you have a bad day all you have to do is tell me. For better or for worse, right? I made a promise, and I intend to stick with it. So don't make me seem like a bad husband," Tony joked.
Tony glared at him. "Don't call him that. He has a name. And of course I got his number, what do you take me for, an amateur?"
He was extremely annoyed and more than a little frustrated that Tony was messing around and calling him, more so because he'd just sat down and was currently busy painting, something which he rarely had time to do, and when he did, there was a distinct lack of inspiration. He'd told Tony so, ready to slam the phone down in Tony's face because he was sick of the way Tony was going on, except he'd heard the desperation in Tony's voice when he asked him to pick him up. And something obviously wasn't right, because Tony Stark didn't beg. And he also didn't ask for help.
And for Tony, it seemed too loud. He just needed... he didn't know what he needed anymore. He wanted Steve back. But needing and wanting are two different things.
His hands stopped moving on its own accord, and he looked down to see what he had drawn, perhaps seeing it properly for the first time. And maybe it was, because he certainly couldn't remember drawing Peggy's youthful face, her red lips quirked into a mischievous smile. In the background was the rest of the Howlies sitting around a campfire.
And one second Steve's sitting there in the hospital bed that in all honesty should probably be a tight fit for his frame, but at the moment seems to make him smaller than he really is, more vulnerable, and the next he can see Steve's facade crack and his face crumble.
"Yeah, baby, I did," Tony said, his voice coming out shaky and choked up. He felt a stinging behind his eyes and he blinked rapidly. "What's wrong?" Steve asked and Tony just couldn't do it anymore.
He’s happy when he’s got something to do, and this mission is a blessing in disguise, really. He didn’t even think twice before accepting the mission briefing from Tony.
Tony couldn't help but flinch, humiliation burning and spreading through his veins like hot lava. He felt guilty at the mention of Pepper, and the fact that he had used Steve as a rebound fling. At first (and yes, he knew that it was disgusting, but he needed a distraction and if Steve was willing to provide one, then he'll take it) he
"It was. But you know what wouldn't leave my mind after that? Who decides to have a bachelorette party the night of Valentine's Day?" Tony sounded downright exasperated.
Tony doesn't ask what he means, nor does he call Steve out, allowing him to think about what he wants - needs to say. Besides, he already knows that Steve's referring to the situation that they currently find themselves in. Really, he should've expected something like this to happen a long time ago. Pepper was always warning him about his preference for one night stands instead of taking the normal route and just dating someone like everybody else did.
I made it! Okay, so because it's my birthday today, I've decided to post it as a sort've gift. I originally planned to post it when I was halfway through writing chapter 6, but a few people asked when I would be updating and I just couldn't resist. I know, I know, everyone already knows that their daughter's name is Morgan, but these two obviously don't. At least, Steve doesn't. Also, I apologize for any remaining mistakes that I might've missed. The next chapter will be shorter, but only so that I can focus on chapter 7, which will be longer. We will be seeing a nursery soon, and the team will get to meet the newest member. Eventually.
So the fact that Steve and Tony were close with each other and seemed content to kiss each other whenever they wanted to, well, that was their own doing.
When he snickers again at the sheer ridiculousness of his own insane thoughts, he realizes that he can make out whirring noises coming from the corner of his workshop where DUM-E was stationed.
"Actually, Steve and I were goin' to head out to this little café I found a couple 'a days ago. We were gonna leave afta the movie but why don't you come with us? They have great coffee," Barnes said, looking to Steve for confirmation.
He leaves the room, shutting the door behind him, and only checks the time on his phone when he's safely out of the room where the blue light of the screen can't disturb Steve's sleep.
He gets the bill and drives back to the tower, feeling frustrated and disappointed and all out of sorts.
"Steve, I love you and I love the little Blob as well. Nothing and no one will ever be able to stop me. You know how stubborn I can be, right?"
So he went to his own apartment, taking the elevator to his own floor and wandered around. He wasn't sulking, thank you very much, he was just extremely bored, and his usual confidant didn't want anything to do with him. And then he just so happened to walk past his art studio.
He and Pepper really were over by now. She had been staying in Malibu, and the fact that she hadn't called him back or made any effort to move back to the city was any indication, she wasn't looking to further their relationship, not now that he was in some sort of relationship with Steve.
From the tinny voice on the other end of the line, he can distinguish Bruce's confusion and slight worry. He thanks the supersoldier serum for his enhanced hearing and motions for Tony to hand him the phone, which Tony does with a pout.
It might've been an evil ploy on her behalf, making sure that he'd actually attend the meeting this time if it happened to be at a place he liked to go to, and he was noticeably upset that she had even thought of something so cruel. But, he had to give her kudos for originality, and the fact that she made the meeting a little bit more bearable than usual by making sure he had amazing coffee and snacks.
Steve squeezed Tony's hand in his, then directed his attention to their waiter one more time. "You have our thanks. Thank you for the blessing," he said. It was kind of her to give them a blessing.
"Tony, I'm going to help you stand, and then we're going to medical so that we can sort out your ankle."
"I did promise, didn't I? Okay, hiw about you sleep here tonight, no, I will not be sleeping here in the medbay with you -" he didn't think he could stand to be in such close proximity with Tony any longer. He'd reached his daily quota two and a half hours ago. "Tomorrow when you wake up, I'll be waiting right here for you. How does that sound?"
"Tony, I promised Pepper and Rhodey that I'll stay by your side through both your bad days and your good days. I'll admit that I might've gotten a talk from Rhodey and Pepper had a whole speech prepared when she realized we were dating. We've gone through stupid arguments and given each other the silent treatment and for not one moment after each of those were done did I ever doubt that you were still mine. And if I did happen to push you too much and you wanted to walk away, I promised myself that I'd find a way to make you stay. I love what we have right now, but I'd like it to last forever. So will you marry me and be mine?" Steve asked, heart beating a mile a minute as he waited for Tony to respond to his question.
wrong, seeing as the little waif of a thing that he knocked over was simply gorgeous. Petite frame, tiny birdlike hands, full, plump lips, sparkling blue eyes, and blond.
"Yeah, yeah. I'm still telling Pepper. God, I can already picture her face." Wonder coloured Tony's voice, displaying just how happy he was.
And then the meeting was over and he had to watch Steve leave with Barnes and Wilson, laughing with them at something stupid Barnes seemed to be showing them on his cellphone.
"So, since it's both yours and Barnes' best buddies in there, you two should go sort it out," Clint said tactlessly, breaking the silence that had now spread through the common room as the rest of the team listened to the argument that flowed through the vents from Tony's lab down below.
Steve instantly agrees. It's safer to go with Tony and leave the nursery behind them, that and all the words left unspoken. He just doesn't have the energy to deal with whatever Tony seems to have going on inside his head. Not this morning.
"I should've known about her. I should've guessed that something was wrong, that my body changed. Who doesn't notice that, Tony? And now… God, I'm so, so sorry. All I can do is apologize, but sorry isn't going to fix anything, is it? It's not going to fix the fact that our - that our daughter isn't - I'm sorry. Tony, I'm so
Am I the only one that thinks Tony's love language is providing for people??? Like, he makes them gear, pays for things and buys food? It's the way he shows his love, people!
"For fucks sake, Rhodey! You two are supposed to be my friends. You're supposed to support me, not question my every move. Steve would never in a million years even think about doing something like that," Tony snapped.
His main priority right now was to get Tony out of the bathroom and to Bruce at the Tower. He knows that Tony hates medical, but he would feel so much better if he knew what was really wrong with Tony.
There was also the little voice In the back of Tony's mind that reminded him that the position they were currently in was one they've been in multiple times; they used to cuddle a lot when they were dating, either in bed while one was reading or watching tv or on one of the many luxury sofas scattered about the penthouse floor.
He knows that it's wrong, and he knows that if Tony wasn't high or whatever was wrong with him, then Tony would be betrayed by what he was thinking of doing, but he was desperate, and it was for Tony's own good.
"Tony, you don't need to - " Steve murmurs, sounding put out. He lays back on the bed, shoving his hands into his eyes.
This is why he was considering retiring. Because people - and maybe this was punishment for putting his ma and Bucky through all the trouble when he was younger and getting into fights that he had no way of getting out of - or whatever higher power was in existence loved testing his limits. And it wasn't just any thing that tested his limits, no, it was aliens and robots and genetically enhanced humans that were grown in a test tube in the dark of a supposedly unknown Hydra cell and one gorgeous man by the name of Tony Stark. And not all in that order, but of course it would come down to this. Tony was always testing his ability to remain sane.
Steve stood, a wide smile breaking across his face. He slid the ring onto Tony's finger, watching as the silver band glinted in the light of the restaurant.
Which, yeah, the entire team could agree with. To be woken up by an A.I. that, for all intents and purposes, was never supposed to do more than help people and greet them calmly and politely, it
He hates the way he seems to croon the words even as he's singing about his Christmas heartache. Who the hell croons when singing about their heartache?
He's getting ready to leave and although Steve tells himself that he shouldn't focus so much on Tony, that he shouldn't be disappointed that Tony's leaving to go back to his workshop, he is.
This argument that Tony and Steve were now involved in was the worst one that they had ever overheard.
The longer the silence stretches, the more he feels as if he should be doing something about it. Steve seems unsure, insecure. It's so far removed from the Steve that he usually sees; sassy and sarcastic. Confidant.
Steve couldn't help laugh at Tony's dramatic antics. He threaded his hands through Tony's tousled curls, reveling in its softness; Tony had let his hair grow slightly longer than usual and now it just reached the nape of his neck, curling slightly at the ends. He loved how Tony's hair looked without all the products he insisted on using.
"Yes, really. Unless… you weren't serious about an apology dinner. In that case, you can go to hell, " Steve said.
There was complete radio silence from Tony's end of the line after their rather spectacular blow up in his lab a few days ago. In the days that followed, Steve himself didn't make a point to say anything or go out of his way to see Tony, not that he wanted to, of course. He was still upset, and he had every right to be. Who did Tony think he was? He had no right to tell him that he wasn't allowed to go out with Sharon. Of all things Tony decided to get mad at him over he gets mad at that. And he was the one accused of being the hypocrite! Yet, when Tony decided it was okay to kiss him and sleep with him while claiming to still be interested in Pepper, and that things between them would never go any further than they were at the moment, it was somehow still his fault.
"What did you do to Tony?" he asks. And okay, yes, maybe he shouldn't have accused the man outright, especially since there was no evidence pointing to the man, but he trusted Tony's word. Besides, the man standing in front of him just had a whole feeling about him that screamed 'untrustworthy'.
As predicted, at the mention of a date, Tony perked up tremendously, the beginnings of a small smile tugging at his lips and hope shining in his eyes.
"You're crazy, you know that? But something tells me you're used to people telling you that. As for Steve, I was just about to head to his room. I'm sure it would be alright for him to visit the baby. I'm sure he'd feel better when he gets to hold her. Well, longer than he did last night. I'd like to do a quick check-up to see if everything's healing up as it should be, but hopefully, Steve will be discharged tomorrow."
When Tony wakes in the morning, Steve is already up, nose red and sniffling. He looks absolutely miserable and doesn't even try to turn away when Tony puts a hand on his forehead to feel for a temperature.
He sees it when Steve's face goes eerily blank before he turns away. But he notices how Steve's youthful face suddenly looks drawn and even more tired, his blue eyes dim. Steve is trying not to let his obvious hurt show, and Tony wonders — if not for the third time this night, if he's finally done it, he's become the biggest asshole ever.
Steve sent him a smile. "Good morning, Tony," he greeted, "I slept well. And you? You aren't stiff from sleeping in that chair? I know it couldn't have been all too comfortable for you. You could've gone back to the penthouse to sleep, you know, I would've been fine."
By now, he's literally had enough of everything and is so frustrated that he doesn't even think before grabbing Tony's hand and heading towards the bathroom door.
"Do you make it a habit of bumping into people, Steve, or is it only when the person you're bumping into is me?" he asks and is positively delighted when Steve's face flushes.
"I thought you said that you never 'pegged me as one of the people who sucked up to their boss' type people. I'm just proving your theory correct," she sniffed.
Last night and today were the most he's ever seen Steve cry, and both times they were for things that were out of Steve's control, yet things that he held himself accountable for.
It's like a dam had suddenly broken and all of Steve's worry and sadness and pain was too strong and Tony's words had been his breaking point because Steve just… lets go.
It made his blood boil whenever he thought of Tony's past relationships. Especially because he knew that Tony was young and vulnerable and more than a little insecure enough to believe and fall under whatever coercion his past lovers had to have told him. They made him believe that they loved him, when in reality they only really loved the riches and fame that came with bedding a Stark.
And who knew that signing himself up for therapy and dealing with stupid shrinks who told him to write letters that he wouldn't send - who even writes letters anymore? - was a step towards healing? But the thing that really helped? The thing that really helped was picking up the phone and calling Steve.
His abrupt change in attitude does little to ease the wariness that lingers, but because he’s a good boyfriend and he doesn’t want to push Tony too far - and sometimes being a good boyfriend means making sure that vultures like Clint can’t get to the other’s food - he moves to leave.
Tony's eyes trail back to his daughter, watching the way Steve handles her with the ease and gentleness of an experienced parent.
In which Steve and Tony have an awkward meeting to discuss the recent mission, ignore the elephant in the room, and Steve finally gives birth.
And when he finally got off the phone with Tony, he spared a minute to think about the conversation that he had had with Pepper not even three days after his fight with Tony, when he was extremely furious and annoyed to even think straight.
Pepper always did whatever she wanted, and had no time for anyone who told her that she couldn't do something.
Suddenly, the waiter reappeared, this time with their proper desserts on hand. "Your dessert, Sirs. And congratulations on the engagement," the waiter said with a broad smile, placing their desserts in front of them.
The pile of sandbags had grown significantly since he'd come down to the gym and he felt a surge of guilt at the fact that the money to replace them was coming out of Tony's pocket.
Bruce congratulated them quietly and Natasha practically squealed. Rhodey and Pepper had huge smiles on their faces, each of them happy for the couple.
It’s not fast enough because just as he’s stepping over the threshold of the lab and the glass doors are sliding shut behind him, he hears Tony curse up a blue streak and a loud clattering as whatever tools were around Tony is knocked to the floor.
"So? Are there wedding bells in the near future?" Natasha all but yelled into the phone. Steve could see in Pepper's square that she was nodding furiously along to Natasha's question.
"Give me a break, Tony! Why are you suddenly so obsessed with what Sharon has to do with me? Yes, I went out to dinner with her tonight. Does it concern you? No. Is it my business? Yes. Back. Off."
Judging by the bare concern shining in Steve's blue eyes, he probably did a really bad job of it, but he can see that Steve is trying just as hard not to let on that he knows something's up with him. He sees Steve relax and exhales at the sight, his own relief more than palpable.
"Definitely is a good morning now that you're up. And yeah, I'm up early. Not by choice, though. My space heater up and left me to freeze," Tony said with a slight pout, adding to his overall look of adorable-ness. His hair was disheveled and he looked as if he were still in the process of waking up.
When he realizes that Steve's watching him with a mixture of wariness and exhaustion clear on his face, he packs his phone away.
Outside the night is cooler, and Steve feels as though he can breathe easier. He ignores the parking valet and takes his car keys, heading towards his car. Tony follows along obediently, not questioning anything or even where Steve was leading him. It's strange to think that Tony was willing to trust him so fully, but he's not looking to change that. He hopes that Tony realises that he's one more person that he has in his corner.
It's only after they've finished the main course and are delving into dessert that the other shoe drops.
It's always been something that Steve's done whenever he was troubled or feeling overwhelmed and the sound of Tony's heartbeat beneath his ears was a way to calm him down from whatever state he was currently in.
Tony went quiet after that, and he could almost feel the way that Tony's eyes bored holes into him from how hard he was staring at him.
Tony heaved a great sigh but put his phone away, turning it off and turning it face down so that he could eat his breakfast.
"Sometimes, they just want to be close to you. Skin-to-skin contact is good for both you and the baby. It helps strengthen the bond between the two of you," she explains.
And although he can understand Tony's confusion at his eagerness to accept the mission, it's completely misplaced. He's not eager to go on the mission, not
"This place looks amazing. How did you even get a booking for it?" Tony asked as soon as the mâitre d' was out of earshot, glancing at the interior with a critical eye.
"I'm in love with you, you idiot. I was trying to sort through everything in my head before I decided to do anything, but I guess you picked up on it. I'm sorry that I made you worry, Tony."
He didn't want his daughter to feel like she wasn't wanted or that she was different simply because she had two parents who weren't together. And yeah, he knows that kids go through it all the time when their parents get divorced - or when they break up.
So he sees the way more tears spill from Steve's eyes and roll down his face before Steve wipes them away quickly.
Oh, not to mention that 'the blond'  - as Tony took to calling him in his head - was so fucking sassy and sarcastic, hardly giving him the time to apologize and explain himself.
He winces and Tony catches him, eyes going soft and he adjusts his grip on his hands, but Tony's misunderstood; he couldn't help but feel a stab of pain at the way Tony didn't call him Steve and chose to call him by his last name instead.
He couldn't look at their confused faces, focused solely on getting out of the café that seemed as if it was closing in on him.
Tony picked up the phone and dialed the only number that was on the phone, waiting with bated breath.
"Bruce made hot chocolate for everyone. He said that we needed a change of scene and that he was tired of everyone sipping on coffee and soda when we watched a movie. You missed out."
There's a moment of silence between them, and Tony debates on whether or not to tentatively approach the topic of Steve and their daughter staying with him in the penthouse, or to simply come out and say it.
"Well, well, well. If it isn't the knight in shining armour. Wait, that's Tony. You're the knight in red, white and blue spandex." she says with an amused smile playing on her lips. She stands up from the sofa that she had been lying on and walks towards the pair, eyeing Tony with critical eyes.
He worked up the courage to smile back at Tony. "Morning, Tony. And no, you didn't wake me. I usually wake up this time for my run with Sam," he said.
He got up and dumped the rest of the disgusting coffee down the sink and stumbled over to his workbench, slumping into his chair and reached blindly for his phone.
Although, that could just be Natasha. She sounds normal whenever she's sparring against Clint, or whenever she's shooting at the enemy. So maybe she was still annoyed at him, but was extremely good at hiding it. He doesn't dwell on those thoughts and gets straight to the point.
"Take him to Bruce, Cap. I'm sure the good doctor is tired of waiting by now. I know I am," she says and he nods, walking down the hallway that leads to the medbay, Natasha following.
Okay, so this was out of his comfort zone, and he was doing that thing where he spoke too fast and rambled, but he'd like to think that he'd made his intentions - and his
Steve's pallor was pale, far too pale for his liking, really, but Tony didn't think anything was wrong with him.
It mostly worked, but only because he kept on looking out the window to avoid looking at Steve whenever the blond smiled or laughed at the ridiculous antics of his two teammates.
"I'm coming, I'm coming, Tony! You need to go easy, okay? How's your head? Are you still feeling sick?" he asked, tugging Tony back until he was facing him so that he could scan him over once more.
He had to be, seeing as he had contributed to the problem. Not that it was a problem, more of an… unplanned adventure that started last night and will last for the next eighteen years.
Tony had promised himself that he would be the best father he could possibly be to his daughter. And yes, she was unplanned, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be loved or cared for. In fact, he loved her the moment he first laid eyes on her.
He pulls Steve impossibly closer to him, squeezing the blond's shoulder in a show of support, rubbing gently.
Steve grins at the cute dress in his hand; it's pink and so, so tiny. He's sure that Morgan will look adorable in it. He allows himself to wonder how she'll look in it when he gets her from the med floor.
"Okay, to be fair, Rhodey and Pepper are extremely protective, you know how they can be. And I explained to Pepper that you weren't after my money! She even apologized. Come on, I've never seen Pepper look that mortified in all the time she's worked for me."
"I'm great, doc. Although, something tells me the only thing that won't be great is my sleep schedule for the next couple of years. Good thing I don't sleep much. Means I don't miss out on much sleep. Huh, everyone always told me I needed to sleep more. They never wanted to believe me when I said I don't need it. Guess I was right," he murmurs the last part to himself, almost thoughtfully.
As in, he'd bumped into Steve so hard that Steve fell to the floor and all his belongings scattered everywhere.
When he's done explaining the situation to Pepper, and after her face has finally gone back to normal, she notices what he was trying to do and a smile grows on her face.
Tony who wore track pants that were so well-loved and worn that they were practically threadbare, who liked to wear oversized shirts and cardigans that didn't belong to him, rather items that were stolen from the other team members, sometimes Natasha if he was feeling brave and she wasn't feeling to murderous.
Was he there so long already? It didn't even feel like half an hour since he'd joined Steve again, and yet it was already six hours later.
He knows it's a remnant of all the things Steve has had to go through and face; years of bullying and snide comments from strangers and co-workers finally getting to him and wearing him thin.
He still thinks he could have done better, but there’s nothing he can do about it until the next Championship Tour.
Why would Tony Stark even bat an eyelash in sympathy? Steve had quite literally vandalized Stark’s property—twice.
He chokes again, startled as she examines him, her camera strap thick around her neck. Even in the dark, the dimmed streetlights outside the alley allow him to get a good look at it—a Nikon, with larger lens attached.
. Sometimes he’ll be gone before 8 in the morning, or he’ll disappear before Tony gets home, and won’t get back until it’s nearly 5AM. By then Tony’s either asleep, or just waking up to get ready, and make himself some breakfast before he leaves for work.
The feeling of the waves crashing against his skin is surreal. Just thinking about polishing his favorite surfboard gets him all tingly inside. Cool sand between his toes as he jogs out to catch the early morning waves just as the sun starts to rise. It’s the ultimate thrill. There’s absolutely no way anyone could convince him that anything else is better than the true freedom of the soul that comes with riding that perfect wave.
The man shifts in his direction, and Tony feels a pang of satisfaction that he’s finally got his attention. “So here we are.” He says, and it makes Tony scoffs a little.
His mantra of distraction becoming impossibly more vital as he consciously begins to jerk his hips forward, fucking into Steve’s blood-slicked hand with little thrusts and gasps.
“N-No.” Tony rasps. Of course he doesn’t want to be anywhere near a godforsaken dead body, but the smell of blood has become so nauseating.
His thighs burn like hell, but he refuses to stop. He loves the feeling of Bucky inside him, filling him up deep and bare, he loves fucking himself on Bucky’s length, loves how only when he’s panting and sweaty and out of it that Bucky wraps a hand around his cock and squeezes hard until Tony’s hips are stuttering and he’s spilling out onto Bucky’s stomach.
is an anonymous New York-based street artist, vandal, and political activist. Typically recognized by his unique stenciling style, and his distinct portrayal of satire through street art and inflammatory epigrams, Nomad has become quite the living urban legend.
Her hair is visibly black, even in the dark—she’s got a leather jacket on, fingerless gloves, and an expensive-looking hanging from her neck. Steve doesn’t know what to make of her, or better yet what she’s doing in the same alley asking him just that.
Ok yes I came up with this ridiculous AU out of literally nowhere. My mind supplied masquerade ball au and while I was talking to a friend about Banksy this just… happened.
When he picked up Nomad’s blazer—the same one he’d been itching to run his hands over not long ago, Tony hadn’t expected the man to retreat so suddenly. He can’t even choose what words to say before the fabric is snatched from his grasp.
As soon as Bucky’s fingers are off of his nose, Tony takes a deep breath, his eyes rolling back as he slides his hands up his body to rest on his chest. He knows he looks like a mess by now, with his unruly combination of bedhead, a freshly fucked throat, and his reddened, spit covered face.
Such well-known figures are usually easily recognized when most of them wear skimpy, custom made masks.
“Everyone in here is an idealist. A cynical idealist. Apparently not you though.” The man is teasing him, Tony knows, but knowing just makes it worse. He clears his throat before he lets himself stumble on his words again.
“Make him look at it.” Steve grunts from across the room, and within seconds Tony’s jaw is being squeezed, his head jutted out uncomfortably towards the screen.
Steve opens his mouth to speak, but nothing manages to leave his mouth but a small choke of air when she strides over to him and grabs to strings of his hoodie to literally yank his attention in her direction.
With no walls or doors blocking his ear’s from the music playing in the room, Tony wouldn’t be able to tell that Steve sounds out of breath if not for how close he is behind him.
Tony whines at the wet, sticky, stinging feeling as he reaches for his cock, and he knows how this goes, how Bucky gets when his thoughts are nothing but lewd and demanding, so it’s no surprise to him that he doesn’t get much stroking in before his arms are pulled above his head and Bucky is gesturing for him to lay back.
It’s not like Tony was upset that Steve, at least, had found a job that he liked. He’s more upset that Steve’s schedule is so
Hydra. They’re infamous among the infamous. A group of taggers that are solely known for their uninhibited violence. Their graffiti is mediocre, at best, but that’s never what they’d made do from, usually just painting their wretched symbol anywhere they leave a half-to-death beaten body or befuddled armed-robbery victim.
The three of them notice a figure leaping onto a mini jet ski and zooming out towards the drowning child, who evidently thought she could swim so far without the use of floaties. The presumed lifeguard reaches the girl in seconds, dives into the water with a clean swoosh, and quickly helps her onto his jet ski. The three of them watch in fascination as the lifeguard reaches the shore and helps the still crying child onto her feet. He bends down and seems to whisper something to the girl, whose loud wails cease just as her mother reaches her and picks her up, thanking the guy before carrying her child away.
Bruce snorts out a laugh and runs a hand through his damp hair. “Yeah right. A babe like that wouldn’t be interested in you two muscly idiots.”
Natasha gives him a blank stare, and Steve regrets sitting on the ottoman, having no cushion against his back to recoil against. It’s a nasty look directed at him that he doesn’t want to see.
Tony’s is a bit decorative. It covers most of his face, his curly hair styled to flop over the gold that covers his forehead. It stops at the tip of his nose, and the pointed, cat-eye shaped eye slits kind of fuck up his peripheral vision, but other than that he still thinks he’s recognizable. He’d been at his father’s side for most of the night anyway, and Howard has a mask with a handle attached to it instead of having it ribbon tied.
When Bucky gets back, it’s late, and Steve’s paranoid expectation that the police are somehow going to come bursting into his common room has died down. He’d still jumped a bit when Bucky had let himself in. He has to remind himself that he’d given Bucky and Nat each a spare key.
Bruce Banner, when he’s decked out in his usual surf gear, is entirely a new person. There’s something about when he pulls on his preferred green wetsuits that de-aligns him completely from himself. No more tea, to hell with yoga, and what’s the point of being one with nature? The contradictory feelings are even more intensified when he braces himself in the water.
He makes his way across the pedestrian crossing on Brooklyn Bridge to return to Manhattan for a second time.
When Tony doesn’t look back, Steve practically bolts—a calm, yet rushed stride to the hallway leading to the stairwell. He slips out the exit, unnoticed, and makes his way down the stairs. Using the pickpocketed keycard, he accesses the nearest elevator and lowers himself down one floor. The top floor before the penthouse—where Howard’s office is.
Bucky, of the three of them, seems the most excited when he returns, despite being the one who actually worked the longest. The fact that he was the only one getting paid of the three of them probably factors into the grin he has on his face when he plops down on Steve’s chenille couch with such a blissful sigh.
“But I thought they’d disbanded. Thought they weren’t a thing anymore.” He finishes, his words clipped.
“I doubt he thought he was unrecognizable. But I knew he didn’t recognize me. It’s probably why he approached me in the first place.” Steve starts, pressing his hands against his knees to refrain from fiddling with them.
Ew can you imagine jeff bezass, mark suckerfuck and elon muskrat at the same party—being hosted by howard stark???? It sounds absolutely terrifying. If they breathe too long around each other millions more workers will be subjected to unfair treatment while theyre forced to package bought and paid for teslas that are being shipped to mars (for free in 2 days). On top of that if you complain online mark zuckerberg will crawl through your screen and just…stare at u. and howard just started ww3.
“Tony, ah, I’m going in now.” He’s snapped out of his thoughts by Steve’s voice. Tony gives a lazy smile and hums for him to go ahead.
He’s far too embarrassed of how selfishly self-indulgent he’d let himself be. It’d put their whole operation in jeopardy. If he gets caught, or Bucky, or to whatever extent Natasha as well, they’re all in for a less than pleasant experience, court, fines, and jailtime. All of them have skin in the game, and they aren’t prepared to just let it get snipped.
Of course, there’s no guilt. He can’t afford to feel guilty, he’s too angry to feel guilty. People like Howard Stark don’t deserve his guilt, and he knows that.
He doesn’t even know when he’d looked down, but when he peaks up at his friends, Bucky and Natasha share a mixed expression of confusion and disbelief.
He doesn’t hear Steve sigh, but he can hear him continue pulling down his slacks, and his underwear, until he can feel the fabric bunched up above his knees.
“This one is just for you. I know you’re going to enjoy it, Tony.” Steve whispers into his ear, but Tony isn’t listening.
he can’t host a balcony pavilion party and have the satirical work of Nomad denouncing his life’s work hanging above all his guests. What’s sweet about it—his critical timing had been guaranteed to
It’s all quite miserable. In fact, the only things Tony has looked forward to each day in the last 6 months is the time he gets to spend with his boyfriend Steve—which had been difficult even before he got this job.
As expected, it ends relatively fast—Steve empties into his condom within a few short minutes, and Tony is left hard and hot and bothered without anyone to fix it but himself.
He doesn’t have a clue what the woman with the camera is up to, why she’s snooping around looking for information on Hydra, or what in God’s name she thinks of him, but it’d probably be in his best interest to get out of her direct suspicions and away from this alleyway as soon as possible.
Steve makes a face, a mix between offense and acceptance, and sighs. “Just don’t ask where I got it. And I’ll need it back tomorrow morning.” She hands him two dollars for the chocolate and is gone before Steve even tries to print out her receipt.
Tony’s coughs are slightly louder than the underlying noise of the porn on the television and the steady slapping sound of Steve masturbating from the other side of the room.
Being brought up in Brooklyn for most of his life had always been a bit of a hindrance for him, as being from a city up north with notoriously cold winter weather isn’t usually how most surfers get ahead of the game, but Steve, from a young age and due to frequent family visits down to Miami, had always held a natural inclination towards the sport.
“We’ll talk when James gets back.” She looks at her phone for the time. “Which is in about an hour or two. So just tell me, you did actually get it done, right?” She looks expectant, but equally as ready for bad news. Steve feels a pang of insult pulse in his chest.
She scoffs, and Steve holds his breath as he quickly pulls his phone out of his back pocket, points it at the wall, and turns on the flashlight.
Tony blinks a few times slowly, and his cock begins to harden simultaneously alongside his processing of the situation.
The man chuckles, laughing at him and Tony doesn’t know where his confidence is going as his cheeks flush in embarrassment. He’s never been more grateful for this stupid mask.
Bucky is already dressed for his job—his hair once again styled in a tightly pulled bun, stray hair slicked back with spray. His friend is wearing a basic black tux, but it fits him well, defines enough muscle to clearly let people know not to fuck with him.
Thor looks at Bruce with a deadpan expression, and Steve’s already walking away—presumably to get another drink.
“Come on, let me show you.” He pulls back from the hug, and suddenly Tony’s wrists are being gripped very tightly, and Steve is dragging him towards the soggy newspaper.
Tony gasps quietly, rolling his tied wrists as he climbs onto Bucky’s lap instead, holding himself right above the dick below him. “I let—I let Steve fuck me.”
“Steve.” He whines, looking to where his husband had rolled off of him to catch his breath. “Steve, drive me to Bucky’s.”
Tony cocks his head to the side. He’s already confused. “Oh please.” Tony can’t stop himself, and continues even when his voice cracks. “Don’t even get me started. I’d be crucified if I wasn’t here.”
Steve has pushed him down to the floor, so they’re both on their knees, now inches away from the soon to be rotting corpse.
Even if he loves his New York roots, and finds the concept of owning a car ridiculous when subways and busses exist, as soon as he’d caught sight of the beaches, his move to California after gaining traction as a surfer was easiest thing in the world for him.
He wonders who had the balls to unnoticeably breach Stark security, mount the peak of the tower, and stencil graffiti onto the front wall extending above the balcony floor. Tony thinks it’s absolutely brilliant. Quite bold, but nevertheless brilliant. And well,
His heart is pounding in his chest, and he’s clutching onto Tony Stark’s SI keycard like it’s a lifeline as he removes his mask and walks across the street. Natasha is waiting for him in the café, sipping whatever drink she’s ordered in a booth near the back wall. When Steve approaches her, she simply stands, throws her cup away, and pushes a bag into his hands. A change of clothes, presumably. It wouldn’t make sense for him to let more than who he needed seeing him in this get up.
Stark Tower is huge and flashy, and it seems to leech onto his attention span until he’s once again standing across the street from the huge building. He doesn’t go any closer—returning to the scene of his own crime isn’t wise in the first place. He just wants a moment to…collect himself
Besides his good looks and lovely Australian heritage, Thor prides himself in being the Beyoncé of the surf world. He’s just known as Thor—first name only—to most.
And sitting like this, touching skin to skin and being able to feel and share each other's body heat is the closest they've been since they've broken up beyond brief touches when handing over mission briefings or brushing up against each other in passing.
He phones Steve after an hour of waiting at their coffee shop and when Steve fails to answer his calls and texts Tony can't help but feel as if he'd been stood up.
His nonchalant attitude just serves to worry him even more and he pushes for more information, anything that will tell him what is going on with Tony. His effort, however, is futile when Tony waves him away, and, almost as if feeling guilty (he should feel some guilt because it really hurt when Tony ignored him without even speaking to him), he blows him a kiss and shoots him a tiny grin over his shoulder.
"Morning," Tony said with a smile before sitting down. His therapist sat opposite him, pen in hand and last week's notes laying in her lap. "So Tony, you've said you had trouble getting over Steve. I found a way for you to get over him," the therapist said and Tony leaned forward in his seat. She had his full attention. She slid a piece of paper and pen in Tony's direction.
He debates going back to sleep but decides that he's too keyed up to simply lie there and wait for sleep to come. So when he finds himself outside Morgan's nursery it's not a surprise.
"Ugh, that's so unfair. The flight back was way too long even with the new plane. Although I'm pretty sure we broke flight regulations with the plane's added speed. Not that they can say anything, of course. If they do, I'll just remind them of all the things that Stark Industries helps fund," Tony said with a self-satisfied smirk.
His heart aches seeing Steve like this, especially when his efforts at reassuring Steve that this wasn't his fault was failing drastically.
Steve nods surely and Tony grins, bending down until his body was nearly flush with Steve's. "I know, sorry. If it were Bucky or Sam… Well, I know exactly what they'd do if the roles were reversed," Steve says.
Her voice is gentle, and the question wasn't interrogatory or probing, but sounded rather curious. And she sounded genuinely concerned.
He doesn't say that it's all a lie and he didn't only help because it was the right thing to do, but because he was in love with Tony that he did it.
Tony pocketed his card and grabbed Steve's hand and they left the coffee shop together, both of them wearing infectious smiles.
Because in a perfect world, Steve would be getting to take their daughter home with them instead of watching her being put in the incubator for the night.
"Now, what did you say to your former friend?" she asked and Tony glared at her. Steve wasn't his former anything. They were still married. They were just... taking a break, that's all. Well, he hoped they were only taking a break. He still loved Steve. "Sorry. What did you say to your husband?" she quickly corrected.
He raises an eyebrow at Tony who's gone back to pouting at him now. And no, it wasn't fair. Why did Tony always have to make his life so difficult? He just wanted to get Tony out of this godforsaken bathroom and away from the ritzy gala filled to the brim with peroxide blond men and women and glittering jewels that costs more than the clothing he was currently wearing and back to the safety of the tower where he could be examined properly by Bruce.
"Hey! Look at me, Stark. No one is coming through that door, okay? I won't let them. Do you trust me?" he asked, gripping Tony's chin until Tony was looking at him.
The last thing that he pulls out of the gift bag is a gold box. He's slightly confused but he spies the bright blue Post-It stuck on what he supposes is the lid. He takes a moment to read it and immediately feels a swell of gratitude for Pepper. She really was a godsend in all of this.
When he got back to the tower, his mind was pleasantly quiet, which, to him, made for a good day. He took a quick shower then started on the team's breakfast, greeting each of them with a smile as they walked in.
Tony raises an eyebrow, smirking. "Is that so, Cap? Well, maybe you should remove the stick from your ass and you'll see just how much you push everyone away with your own goddamn righteous attitude. Why don't you just tell me the real reason why you brought me back to the tower so that I can leave and get back into my lab, okay?" Tony questioned, sounding sickly sweet.
The little flight he took around the city really helped. He felt a lot better after it, and if the wind roaring around his closed helmet was all that he needed to feel better about this whole crappy situation, then he knew that he'll be taking a whole lot more flights in the near future.
"Christ, Tony," he says as he takes hold of Tony's ankle, trying to be as gentle as possible. It looks bad, and, judging by how Tony keeps on shying away, it probably hurts just as much.
And really, Tony was dumbstruck. Steve looked so happy and content. It was almost as if Steve was meant to have this.
Tony's eyes grew concerned and his face got more than a little upset at the information that JARVIS gave.
"She forgot the lid thing," Tony said, sounding confused. Steve shrugged his shoulders, sipping at his wine as he watched Tony lift the lid off his plate. The brunet frowned for a second and then his features evened out, confusion leading to a tiny grin.
Anyway, KUDOS AND COMMENTS mean *LOVE*.  And I love you all so please leave some behind on this chapter! 🙈❤️
hidden; he hadn't touched this particular blend in a while (since he and Steve broke up) and the last time he'd had it was precisely seven months ago, back when he and Steve were still dating and blissfully unaware of the near future. Tony still remembers the exact thing they were doing that night; they were settled on the sofa in front of the penthouse television with the lights turned down low, cuddling together and holding steaming mugs of coffee. He can't remember what movie was playing, just that it was some mindless series on Netflix that didn't require much effort to catch up on if a few scenes or episodes were missed, and that he and Steve were far more interested in the other than the actual show.
Bucky let out a loud whoop and Sam immediately stepped in to hit the back of his head, reminding him to be quiet. Steve forgot that they were in different timezones, so maybe the rest of the house was asleep.
Bruce preps the needle and three vials and in less than a second the needle had pierced Tony's skin, and Tony watches with childlike fascination how the blood flows through the tube and into the vials.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Great. Have I ever told you that out of all of your friends, Barnes is my least favorite?"
"You know, I never thought I'd get to have this," Steve said quietly. He's pointedly not looking at Tony, instead looking out at the view of the New York City skyline from the penthouse.
"Tony," he finds himself sighing, "They aren't going to come back, you're safe here in the tower. Bruce and JARVIS are watching over you, okay? You'll be fine. Just go to sleep."
In less than five minutes he was dressed, and he kissed Tony goodbye, wishing him good luck for his business trip.
Tony nods reluctantly, and despite telling himself to gain distance away from Tony, he reaches out a hand and smooths a loose curl away from Tony's eye, rubbing his finger along his face.
“No,” Steve says, shaking his head a little. His cock pulses, just once, as he shifts his hips and rubs his prostate against the dildo inside him. “Burns a little but, but good,” he gasps out.
that Tony probably wasn’t prepped enough, that the little bit of rimming and lube wouldn’t have been enough to stretch him out properly to take Steve’s cock, but Tony looks like he’s in heaven, bouncing and rocking over Steve’s body.
There’s the night with the bullet vibrator he straps to Steve’s balls, then rides him for all he’s worth. There’s the night where Tony slicks up the inside of his thighs and crosses his ankles to make everything as tight and sweet as it can be, and tells Steve to fuck the space between his legs until he can’t anymore.
his hole already stretched around the toy, and then Tony starts to push. Steve’s hole is clenching, even though Tony can see he’s trying to relax, trying to breathe deeply and carefully, trying to let Tony in. Steve is hissing, “Yes, Tony, yes,” between his teeth, fingers clawing into the bedding. It takes an effort, and watching Steve
"That's right, honey," Tony croons, standing behind Steve and placing a hand between his shoulder blades. He pushes gently, guiding Steve toward the bed. "Now, take off your clothes and lie down. And don't keep me waiting any longer than I already have, hm?"
“We can stop,” Steve says, his voice mild. “I’ll understand if you’d rather have someone else. Natasha can be brutal, but she can be very gentle, as well. If you’d rather have her – or Thor, he could be very good for you.”
Steve pulls his pants up, covering himself, then takes a couple of steps back to put some distance between him and Tony. “I’m a horrible person,” he moans, wiping his oil slick hands on his shirt. “I can’t believe I – oh, god.”
anymore, and Rhodey helps Tony save the President. Tony asks for Banner’s help to solve Extremis – he could do it himself, but it’s Pepper’s life on the line so he’s not fucking with that. Then Tony has the arc reactor removed and his heart surgically repaired. His beautiful Malibu house is destroyed, so he heads back to New York.
Tony stares. “I understand where I went wrong. I asked you that question in a way that made it sound like I was looking for a specific ‘what’ that you’re doing, but in reality I was looking for a more general ‘what,’” Tony says. “I’ll be clearer; what, in general terms, are you
Tony grins down at him, nipping at Steve’s bottom lip. “You don’t need to spread your legs, honey. I’ve been wanting to get that great big cock of yours inside me since the moment I saw it.”
He hits the 'ignore' button and slips the phone back in his pocket. After a moment he thinks better of it and pulls it back out, powering the phone down and putting it away.
. Steve thrusts in again, deep as he can go, then pulls out and watches Tony’s asshole flutter, empty and wanting without a cock in it.
, gasping and shaking and loud. Steve shudders under him, his whole body tensing as he spills over the towel again, and Tony’s fingers grip around the dildo, gritting his teeth and stopping his forward push, to let Steve have his orgasm.
He slides his hand up the inside of Stark’s thigh, to his groin, and the weight of Stark’s heavy balls against his fingers makes him shiver. His slick fingers move straight to the cleft between Stark’s cheeks, to the hot, soft skin and the wrinkled furl of his hole. Stark cries out, and his hips tilt up, and that’s all the invitation Steve needs. He lets his oil-slick middle finger dip into the furled hole of Stark’s entrance, and he groans at the heat at the same time that Stark groans at the breach.
He’s buckled down over the padded bench, forearms and calves strapped down to the padded arm and leg rests, his chest resting over the larger torso section. Tony had designed and built the bench himself, so it’s strong enough to hold Steve down unless he really fights. It still has quick-release buckles in case Steve uses his safeword, but it’s sturdier and stronger than what a baseline human would need.
Steve shivers, then shifts his knees apart a little. “If… if you – I don’t know how you’ll fit, I don’t, but if you think you can…”
Because Steve is taking him down so gently, so slowly. It’s not rough or painful or harsh. It’s soothing in a way subspace has never been for him. In a way
Steve moans, kissing and licking his way back up to the head. He’s not taking Tony’s cock into his mouth – in this position, really, Tony could probably fuck into his throat, but he was serious about not wanting to come yet.
He's dimly aware of the hot rush of come inside him, of Tony's own shouts. He can feel Tony pulsing and twitching inside him, and each sensation is just the right side of too much. He can't stop jerking, his whole body still thrumming from it.
Tony pulls his thumb free, lets go of his grip on Steve’s chin. Steve keeps his mouth open for a moment, so Tony decides to use it.
Steve strokes him through the orgasm, and Tony is dimly aware, after a few moments, of his whispered praise. “That’s beautiful, Tony, just beautiful. You’re stunning, spread out for me like this. I want to watch you come forever, sweetheart, just like this, under my hands, unable to stop yourself.”
And that was how Steve had learned he had a praise kink. It was also how Tony had learned he could say all the sappy, ridiculous things that Steve usually – when he wasn’t strapped down over a bench – kissed him to stop him from saying.
Tony chuckles, sneaking a quick kiss to Steve’s nose. Steve scowls, but there’s no heat in it, so Tony reaches for the warming unit, which has some soft, damp towels in it, and opens it up. He pulls one of the towels out and uses it to carefully wipe the come off Steve’s back and ass, and the lube, thrilling a little at Steve’s hiss of sensitivity. He’ll bruise in an hour or so, from the flogger and the crop, but he’ll be barely pink by morning. Tony is utilitarian in the way he wipes his cock off, then drops the towel on the floor and crawls into the bed. Steve shifts back, hissing a little in pain, until there’s room for Tony, then wraps Tony up in his arms, throwing a heavy leg over Tony’s waist in an uncanny impression of a koala.
“Why not?” Tony asks, words clearer now. He shifts a little, managing to sit himself up a few more centimeters all on his own.
Tony moans, but he opens his mouth obediently, too far gone to feel any embarrassment at the way his lips are wet; his mouth waters and a line of drool drips from the side of his mouth.
“Tony, the way I feel about you… I don’t have the words yet. I can’t… but it’s something real. It’s something real, and it means a lot, and I feel like you’re either not in this with me, or you don’t understand how in it I am. So I’m rectifying that part. If you didn’t know how I feel about you, you do now. You’re amazing, and I love spending time with you, I love being with you, I – well, shit, Tony, I love you. You have to know that.”
“We, uh, we can move on,” he says. He ignores a surge of arousal as Bruce cries out again, as a little dribble of come forces its way out of his cock to drip on the floor between his spread legs, despite the cock cage. It’s not the fisting that is making Tony hot under the collar so much as Bruce’s obvious enjoyment of it. It’s more in line with what Tony likes in submitting, and it reinforces his decision to have come to this place.
Steve rolls out the dough, presses it gently into a pie plate. He works on the filling next, letting Tony watch him. Pumpkin pie; Tony hasn’t had homemade pumpkin pie since his mother had died. He’d watched her, when he was small; the chef staff did most of the cooking, but Mom made her own pie, and no one else’s had tasted quite like hers since.
Steve leans forward, closing his lips around the head and giving in to the urge to suck. He slides forward, forward, taking what he can of Tony into his mouth. He sucks and licks as he moves, starting a slow, bobbing rhythm.
“Want what?” Tony asks, but his tongue darts out to lick his bottom lip and Steve chases it, tilting his head down and slotting his lips against Tony’s and finally, finally kissing him.
Steve is laughing around the panties stuffed in his mouth, not even trying to push them out with his tongue. He probably could, easily, but where would be the fun in that?
“Because, to me,” Steve says, holding Tony’s gaze steady, “this is a relationship. This is you and me, together, in a relationship.”
Tony’s not going to look a gift horse in the mouth, so he winds his arms around Steve’s neck and locks him there, kissing back with all he’s got, feeling the hum of electricity in his lips as he kisses and kisses and kisses. Steve’s tongue is in his mouth, licking across his own, up along the roof of Tony’s mouth, and then Steve’s teeth are nipping at Tony’s bottom lip and it’s so good Tony could cry.
"Quiet, you," Tony says, fingers dancing up Steve's ribs, managing to find every ticklish spot there.
But Steve doesn’t have any visible enhancements. So his situation is most likely criminal in nature. He’d heard of that – men and women getting in trouble with law enforcement, or with powerful corporations, and the only way to pay their debt to society was to work in the facilities.
“I thought you were, I don’t know… lonely. You needed to connect to someone, and I’m the only person around you can talk to, and –”
Steve’s other hand is holding Tony’s legs wide, keeping him exposed and on display while his fingers fuck into him. Tony moans, his cock getting impossibly hard even as he sinks down further into subspace, breath catching in his throat every time Steve slides his fingers in.
Steve is beautiful. His lips are pink and soft, his cheeks are flushed with exertion and satisfaction. His dark eyelashes sweep across his cheeks when he blinks. “Tony,” he says, taking another deep breath. “I don’t know if this is the right time. I don’t know if this is the right thing to say. All I know is that when I’m with you, I feel like everything is
Tony sighs, head falling back and hands stilling on Steve’s shoulders. “You know what, Steve, it’s fine, you can just top tonight, okay?”
“Tony,” Steve moans, and he sounds completely wrecked, completely immersed in pleasure and pain and too much all at once.
For Tony, subspace is quiet. After the initial head rush in his ears, everything around him goes soft and quiet. The lights aren’t any brighter than they were a moment ago, but when Tony blinks his eyes open, everything looks like it’s overexposed, bright and warm and contrasting. Like a lens filter covering everything.
Dinner is awkward at first, but they go on three more dates before they manage to get out of their own way and find their rhythm. They’re strolling back to the tower one night while Steve licks sinfully at an ice cream cone and Tony sucks on the straw of a sweetened iced coffee. He definitely isn’t putting on a show as he wraps his lips around the straw and hollows out his cheeks.
What he really doesn’t understand, though, is how Nomad had managed to actually get inside without security being alerted of the extra attendee. There had been no extra invitations sent, no plus ones or mishaps on the guest list. They’d never had this problem before.
He manages an art store in Brooklyn and when the chances become available, displays his own small exhibits. Other than that, his life as Steve Rogers is extensively normal. He makes good money, is in good health, and is content with himself.
Near the grand piano on the other side of the room, is a fairly built man, from what Tony can see. He’s alone, a drink in his hand as he seemingly admires the instrument, away from the commotion of socialization. Tony moves to break away from the circle, and Howard pauses to eye him, as if telling him
It’s why he’d accepted the invitation from Bruce, who he’d only beaten by a small margin. If he’s not careful, he knows he can easily be shown up in the upcoming year.
He then whips off his sunglasses and shakes out of his hair, water flinging off his sun-kissed body as if in slow motion.
Staring at the screen, Tony lets his eyes glaze over until only moving blurry silhouettes are visible. He knows Steve’s eyes are on him, but with the way Bucky is squeezing his jaw, he can’t stop an embarrassing string of drool from sliding down his chin. The spit hits Bucky’s arm and Tony flinches slightly before the slap comes—a quick one to his cheek that spreads his saliva across his chin.
Asking would be undoubtedly rude. Everyone here is somewhere on the Forbes list of this year’s billionaires of the world—hell, Tony had been talking to George Lucas earlier.
. He’d done what he’d had to do, like always. Maybe he just doesn’t want to admit, not even to himself, that he’s terrified of being caught by Howard Stark.
Tony himself wasn’t very large, but he still stands inches above Steve, and he can still wrap his thumb and index fingers around Steve’s wrist. With the way Steve’s body looks, it’d been a good thing Tony hadn’t let outward appearances stand in the way of their courtship. He’d fallen for with his husband regardless; for his big heart and sea blue eyes, for his loving personality and overly kind demeanor, for his ideals and the way he loved Tony with all of his being.
It’d been Steve who introduced them, after the wedding. Bucky was his husband’s childhood friend. Steve had been standing right there when they’d met, yet the presence of his husband didn’t make the mutual attraction any less undeniable to Tony.
If Nomad thinks that little of him, thinks he can play him like a fiddle, flirt with, dance with, and steal from him so easily, Tony is going to prove him so, utterly wrong.
He lets the words become his gospel, repeating them over and over as he feels Steve’s hand begin to move on his cock.
It’s an invitation, a forged one, made in the exact style and with the exact paper as the one Bucky had been formally provided with.
He raises an eyebrow, slightly confused but nonetheless deterred, and pulls the door open. Steve is indeed standing directly in front of the door, facing him.
Tony is too busy being thoroughly rawed to wipe it from his face. He stares at Steve’s thigh when his spouse sits down and begins to stroke his hair.
His PR team easily had picked up the nickname, and he now sports Pepsi as his biggest sponsor—the red, white, and blue logo printed fashionably onto his standard competition wetsuit.
He’s looking for one now, now that he’s somewhat cleansed his mind of earlier in the night and is really trying to clear his head this time around. Since he hadn’t brought any supplies with him, he can only wander around looking for bare walls or leftover space in between what is already taken.
Steve is still watching, Tony knows, so he takes a moment to lick the salty substance that’s smeared nearest to his mouth. Like any good husband would, he knows Steve likes it when he swallows, and he’s a good husband.
Natasha ignores his complaint. “I know you suck so I got you something to wear.” She says and takes a bite.
as much as possible before he scrambles out of Steve’s grip and towards the corner of the room that is farthest away from the bleeding corpse in the center.
A deep, wine red circle covers the wall opposite the side he’d been eyeing. Inside it, in the same color, is a skull and six tentacles protruding around it. The paint must have dripped before drying—free hand—and makes the picture look infinitely more ominous while visible with only the light of his flashlight. It’s been painted on top of whatever had been on the wall before.
“It’s beautiful.” He says. Tony feels the odd urge to tell him that he plays. He stares at the blue eyes behind the mask. There’s something mischievous dancing in them, teasing Tony, daring him to get lost in them. His heart hammers in his chest and suddenly Tony’s throat is a lot drier than it was only moments ago. He’s supposed to
“I—It was fine at first.” He starts simply, the stutter making him clear his throat. “I was going to take the emergency exit stairs down to the next floor, but then Tony Stark—and he…and I-I danced with him, alright? I teased him and talked crap about his dad right to his face and he—he agreed with me! So I asked him to dance and we did and I just sort of…stole his keycard instead of one of the attendants. It was right there! I didn’t think he’d follow me. I swear he didn’t even know I’d taken it—” Steve takes a deep breath, not even realizing how red his face has turned between his flushed stutters and poor, rambled out explanation.
Tony acknowledges the warning, but he’s been to enough of these to know proper etiquette. He knows—he was forced to learn the names and work of everyone attending.
“Why don’t you get us some drinks.” He prompts quietly, his voice dismissive and purposefully cold, and watches as Tony actively frowns this time, but concedes.
Bucky wastes no time with shoving himself down Tony’s throat, and Tony immediately gags and moves his hands to hold onto Bucky’s waist. Having something to hold makes it easier when Bucky begins his relentless pounding.
“Strip. I’ll be right back.” And by the time Tony is pulling off his last article of clothing, Bucky has returned, a silky red ribbon in hand that’s promptly used to tie his wrists together behind his back.
Nomad obviously had obtained an invitation, and Tony only has a semblance of an idea of how—either he’d had a real guest give him theirs, or he’d possibly forged one. Tony thinks the former, but if the latter, that would mean the exact format and wording of the invitations had been leaked to him somehow.
There’s a general agreement between them that the lifeguard is smoking hot. He’s got dark-brown hair, looks to be lean with muscle, and the devilish grin he has on his face when he sits back down in his chair is brighter than the sun.
At least that’s what he’s been telling himself since it’d been printed on the cover of the latest Sport’s Illustrated magazine.
He supposes taking his pseudonym for signing his work to the extent of having it become a well-known political figure
He’d messed up big time, and from the way he’d entered the café—all flustered from sprinting out of Stark Tower—Natasha probably has that figured out already. However, when they get into the cab together, the ride back to his apartment is similar to the one only hours ago, silent.
Now that he’s out of school, he’s often being forced to shadow his father. It’s tiring and dull and Howard spits when he yells.
A switch has flipped inside him that he hasn’t so clearly felt since he’d entered his first robotics competition.
He's escorted into elevator as soon as he’s inside, and it takes him a second to realize that it’s Bucky holding his back and leading him into the empty space. The doors slide shut before anyone else can join them, and they ride up to the balcony in silence.
“Anthony. Do you know what you learned in that fifteen minutes?” Howard asks him when Tony wordlessly follows his father out into the hallway. Rhetorical, Tony knows, but he wants to tell his father that firing people who he’d been patting on the back only twelve hours ago isn’t much of a lesson.
All three of them surf well into the morning, and don’t seem to mind when more and more people—couples, families, fellow surfers—begin to share the public space with them.
Tony feels obligated to give credit when it’s due, though, for pointing out that Howard needs to possibly not give out hard copies of tickets
He squints at where he knows he’d just set down his blazer. It's time to haul ass and get the hell out of here.
It would be odd for him to question Steve about his fidelity—it would imply that he doesn’t trust Steve, and reveal one insecurity too may.
“He followed me down because I basically told him to go away after dancing with him. I didn’t realize… He watched me paint Stark’s office. I panicked so I ran off and left everything behind. I had the mask on the whole time but, Howard probably knows what’s happened by now. There’s probably footage of us going up the elevator together. Tony’s going to tell him.” Steve finishes, his mouth dry.
At the same time, Tony’s own mask had been boldy decorated, but he was still very much recognizable as the one and only. The way Nomad had spoken to him about his father was…confusing to say the least. Maybe the man had been looking for a negative reaction, poking the bear with a stick. Anyone that knows of him knows he’s Howard’s media-painted poster child.
“What are you doing? You’re getting paint on me, Steve. These are my work clothes, y’know.” He’s still got an amused smile on his face when Steve moves to stand behind him, both paint-covered hands are placed on his now equally as messy face.
With the job essentially done, the rush of adrenaline is fading, and now he just feels uncomfortably anxious about the last component of all of this—not getting identified.
It’s his favorite place to freelance—sometimes abandon his usual style or forget about stencils and deviate from his normal subject matter. Not to mention there are a convenient number of little, clean, abandoned spots for him to mark up that don’t seem to ever get tagged, despite just how small Hell’s Kitchen may be.
Either way, the two had been a little close for comfort in the Championship Tour, and if not for his ability to pull multiple top scores in the overall number of events, he would have been eating someone’s bubbles.
They wax their boards, and test out the water, swimming a decent distance out to catch the first rises in the tide.
In between them, Steve is fitting himself with a condom—both Tony and Bucky have expressed their approval of him using one. His face is beat red, and Tony supposes it’s because he hadn’t really let Steve fuck him in some time now. Having sex with Steve, it’s uneventful, for him at least. Missionary for a few minutes and Steve is spent and definitely not about to embark on an impossible round two. It can
Bruce goes first, claiming he’ll be able to end the competition early as soon as he has his surfboard under his arm. He catches the first wave he gets to, expertly standing to his feet as his board lifts up with the 5 foot beauty. As he’s carried forward by the wave, he holds his arms out with confidence.
Tony looks the man over. Long-ish brown hair tied into a neat bun, trimmed facial hair. Tall, built, what Tony would definitely call handsome. He momentarily thinks of how Howard had just fired two good people, and decides not to let himself be an asshole just because his head hurts. “Security briefing… Try floor five, first hall you see. Should be one of those rooms.” He waves a hand to acknowledge the man’s thanks, and continues his way into the elevator. As soon as he’s out, Tony beelines to his car, popping three Advil tablets into his mouth seconds after getting in.
The figure, clad in black, hooks both sides of his harness to the bolted capstan’s rope lock. He puts his bag on backwards so it’s open at his chest and takes a moment to stare at the sky. It’s cold out—winter in New York is cold and he easily convinces himself that the cold is what’s making him shake. He takes a deep breath, counts to three, and harshly pulls at the rope to confirm it’s secure. And then he descends. He lowers himself down, down, down until he’s at his starting point. He removes the first half of the stencil from his bag, a can of paint, and grins a bit as he thoroughly begins to
He instead watches his father, watches him fire two hardworking men like they were worth nothing, and then begin to walk out the door once they’ve gone.
Tony turns his head to the side to get a glimpse of Steve, who is unsurprisingly staring right back at him. His spouse’s face is red, and his lithe, pale body looks impossibly smaller in the cushioned chair he’s sitting in. Tony momentarily lets his eyes drop from Steve’s eyes to his slow moving hand, but he doesn’t get much staring in before he can feel the pressure of Bucky’s cock slowly sliding into his ass, and Bucky is suddenly yanking his head back by tugging on his hair, which breaks his eye contact with Steve.
It’s a man—unidentifiable with the way Steve has cut off his ears and nose and eyelids. The body has been stripped bare. There’s dried blood on the man’s face, and it looks like—it looks like Steve had been smoothing paintbrushes across the man’s skin. There are creative strokes of red painted across nearly every inch of skin.
Nomad had left in such a hurry. He most likely expected him to tell his father, but really, what was there to say to Howard? The man’s best moods surface when he’s faking a smile and mingling in shark tanks full of his peers. As if Tony would even think about waltzing up to his father and telling him that Nomad had somehow broken in and done fucking graffiti in his office.
Besides Brooklyn, Steve supposes he owes Hell’s Kitchen a good bit for the development of his graffiti career. The first hit of his that he’d actually tagged as Nomad had been in the district, and that definitely wasn’t the last that he’d done around the area.
“How ‘bout you make some noise for me.” Bucky tugs a bit harder at his hair, and Tony obliges, his breathy panting turning into whorish whines and wet moans in turn as Bucky lets go of his hair to instead swipe a hand down on his ass, harsh and fast. A stinging handprint leaves its mark and sets a plump red spot for each slap that follows.
He doesn’t know why he allows himself to entertain Tony Stark for much longer than he needed to. They stand there dancing for the next few songs, until Steve pulls away and he almost wants to apologize, watching Tony’s eyes flutter open and the shadow of a frown on his lips. It almost hurts to send him away.
, and to the head of security, Pascal. The same Pascal who’d helped Tony dodge Howard’s hand multiple times in the case of…lab mishaps. “You two are fired. On your way out, send in people who aren’t useless at their jobs.”
Watching him work took Tony’s breath away. He drinks him in. The man was fluid with his medium, his movements well-practiced, clearly exhibiting skill. His focus so unbreakable that he evidently didn’t even notice Tony just standing there, taking in Nomad as if he was performing for him, and him alone. It’s a selfish thought, and Tony supposes he’s always been a little selfish as his mind warps this into something intimate, even though it remains as something he shouldn’t even be seeing in the first place.
Bucky only allows him a brief moment of serenity, not long enough to stop breathing heavily, before his arms are yanked away from his chest and used to pull him up and then turn him around. He has even less time to gather coherent thoughts before his face is shoved into Steve’s pillow and Bucky is on his knees between Tony’s legs, spreading them apart until Tony feels an ache from the sudden stretch.
“Who else in this room can say they were five seconds from punching Danny Rand in the face?” He asks smugly, only to groan in exasperation when Natasha raises one hand and lifts up the other to cover a growing smirk. Bucky’s face scrunches up when his girlfriend sits next to him, but wraps an arm around her nonetheless.
come off as going too far, but Steve’s life as Steve and his spurts of action as Nomad are two separate things. Steve is Steve. Nomad is Nomad.
Once Steve is out of the shower, dry and considerably ready to be dressed, he cracks the door open and pulls in the hanger holding up the garment bag Natasha had gotten for him. It takes him a moment to get dressed—everything fits him and he doesn’t give it much of a second thought. Steve can’t help it looks a just a little gaudy—the blazer especially, with it’s patch of white embroidery, sharp and sleek. He stares at himself. He looks like he belongs at Stark Tower. On the end of his blazer’s left sleeve, a patch of fabric is sewed onto the side.
Although he had extended a bit of an informal invite to his top two rivals after the award ceremony…to scope out what he needs to beat next year.
“Maybe so. Idealists don’t get far.” He counters easily, waiting for the mystery man to agree with him, except, that isn’t what he gets.
Tony hits send after typing the message and slumps lower into his spot on the plastic subway bench. It had been an especially tiresome day at work. As an intern 6 months out of grad school, he knows that by now, he should probably be accustomed to overworking and underpayment, but it’s hard to forget that when he leaves work with blurry vision everyday.
Staring at computer screens for several hours daily might not be worth it in the long run. And he’s not extremely satisfied that crouching over in the shitty chair at his desk has got him taking prescribed back pain medication at 23.
Tony tries to get Steve to agree to go back to bed but the blond is stubborn, refusing to go back to bed and just holds onto Tony's arm tighter, shuffling into the kitchen slowly.
However, his favourite thing about loving Tony is the fact that Tony feels as if he can come to him and tell him about his day, or the annoying intern who didn't get his coffee right, even though it wasn't his job to get Tony his coffee fix for that day. He loves that Tony feels as if he could vent to him whenever he was feeling frustrated with the board members after a meeting.
And the next morning, when he's down in the kitchen and grabbing two mugs of coffee for the two of them and Pepper walks in, face already forming that familiar frown of hers that she got whenever she realizes he's got someone over, he's quick to stop her from walking into his bedroom and waking Steve up only to throw him out of the tower. He remembers the Christine Everheart situation from a few years ago and
"I'm only teasing, Tony." Steve looked up from where he was making their breakfast, sounding slightly put out.
He catches the worried look that Tony directs to him and he's quick to wave away Tony's concerned questions, assuring the brunet that he's okay.
So instead he nods. He turns to leave and is more than surprised when Tony calls after him, iron man sticker now forgotten.
So why the hell was he feeling this way? If anything, the one who should be as upset about this whole clusterfuck should be Steve, since he was the one who had his heart rejected and then stomped on.
He knew that something was bothering Steve, had a very good feeling that he knew what it was too, but receiving confirmation from the man would make him feel better.
And then there was the deal with the burner phone. God, that old piece of tech was a sight for sore eyes. But it made some part of his heart warm again at the thought that it was from Steve. That Steve still wanted to talk to him.
It's only after Steve has completely disappeared out of his line of sight that he realizes he never even got to ask the man for his number, much less had time to slip his number between Steve's belongings.
"Fine. You're entitled to your secrets." Tony said, "I've never been here before. It has a nice feel to it. Not like one of those stiff restaurants where I feel like I have to watch myself. I like it."
It was only as they passed through the long, winding hallway that from the ballroom to the men's bathroom that they slowed down. He could sense the growing fear emanating from Tony, and he squeezed Tony's hand gently, giving him what he hopes is a supportive smile. He's got Tony's back, no matter how mad he was at Tony - he's not ready to admit that his lingering anger at Tony from their argument the other day was slowly dissipating the longer he spent time with him - and it's about time Tony realised that.
"Yeah, Tony was slurring a bit, much like he did just now. Uh, he said that his head hurt and that he was feeling dizzy. And he also seemed to be hallucinating. He thought that there was someone else with us in the bathroom." He glances over to Tony who's shut his eyes again.
"Whenever I have a bad day, I can be triggered into having a panic attack really easily, and I can drop at any time. It's not fun, believe me, but I found ways to cope," Tony explained, and he sounded a little bitter, but seemed as if he had accepted it as the way things would be from now on.
"Really? Lying doesn't suit you, Cap, you're not exactly good at it. Why don't you save it from the professionals and tell me why you really bothered driving to the gala just to pick me up," Tony sneered, crossing his arms.
When Steve did talk to him in that boardroom that day, it was in his 'Cap voice', discussing strategies and plans.
He grabs his sunglasses from out of his blazer pocket, slipping it back into place over his eyes and gathers what little belongings he'd brought with him.
Which didn't always work because every now and again, one of them would say something without realizing it and the other would flinch.
Tony thought that he had a hard time watching Steve. Just… in general. It was a problem for him right after they'd broken up. Half the time he found himself staring at Steve whenever the blond wasn't looking at him and then he'd catch himself, internally having to remind himself that he and Steve weren't together anymore and that Steve didn't belong to him. It got easier over time, after he started to spend more time at the company and attend more meetings that required him to fly to another country.
Also, he just really liked when Tony spoke. It never ceased to amaze him how Tony's eyes lit up and his hands made vivid gestures in the air whenever he spoke. Tony was like an excitable child whenever he spoke about things he was passionate about, and it often showed when he asked Tony to tell him about his day or what latest project he was working on.
He'd fallen asleep against his will, and was still lying on top of the bedcovers, hands covered by the long sleeves of one of his sleep shirts.
He knows that Steve's tough and doesn't let anything get to him, but maybe, just maybe, he needed to hear something nice from someone. Maybe he needed to hear that he was valued and cared for and that someone loved -
He smirked, capturing Steve's mouth in a searing kiss, and Steve didn't hesitate to meet him halfway. He was careful not to lean his entire body on Steve, mindful of the precious life that was nestled between them.
Tony chuckled. On screen, everyone was still arguing about whether or not Tony said yes. Although it was pretty obvious judging by the huge smile on the brunet's face. And by the ring sitting innocently on his finger.
"Tony, nothing will happen, okay? JARVIS won't let anything happen to you. You remember JARVIS, don't you?" he asked, making his voice all soft and suggestive. He really needed Tony to grab the bait.
"I know that you're not mad at me. I also know that something else is on your mind. Judging by the fact that you never even made it to bed, I'm assuming that it's something to do with the time of year. Which tells me that you're thinking of your parents," Steve says carefully, hitting the nail right on the head.
"Steve, what did you do?" Natasha doesn't sound accusatory, whereas if the question came from someone else it would, and he'd have bristled. If anything, he feels like he should do something to Stone just for even thinking of drugging Tony.
Despite his earlier exhaustion and the horrible thoughts that had flicked through his mind, he managed to smile back. He was really glad that Tony was home.
Apparently, Tony had never introduced anybody to her. Not the way he did Steve at least. And she'd felt a bit like a proud mother when he did that. She told him that while she loved Tony, she also found it difficult to connect with him the way a partner would. Not that there was anything wrong with him, or their relationship, just that Tony had had a lot of things happen to him in his life, many of them to blame for the way he acted and was today. She told him that every single time that she and Tony took a break, she found it more difficult to come back to things the way they were before, and that he was harder to handle. Which is why she feels as though they are better off as friends.
It felt a lot like regret and jealousy when he watched them leave because that was something he wanted. He wanted Steve to joke around with him, talk to him, be around him, laugh with him, and yet, Steve couldn't even stand to be around him.
And then he was going to make sure that that piece of scum was going to be locked up for a very, very long time.
Not that his little act was working. Barnes seemed to catch on earlier at the tower and kept on giving him and Steve weird looks when he thought Steve wasn't looking.
Tony frowned at how quiet Steve had gotten, sensing that something was wrong; Steve was too quiet, too still. He was slumped over, almost as if he were defeated, and he wouldn't look in Tony's direction, his head was tilted in the direction of the window overlooking the city.
"I think I'm going to get some sleep. Don't forget to rest, Bruce. You need sleep as well," he says, even though his words are hollow and empty. He doesn't need to sleep. He's not tired. But he knows that it's a lost cause and he should just leave it at that.
"What if I was some - some madman? What if I decided to kidnap you? It's not a joke, Tony! This is your life that we're talking about!" Steve is still scolding him and he's getting a tad bit uncomfortable.
Despite all the things they've just said, all the dark thoughts and insecurities being put out for the other to see, he finds it in himself to laugh, and soon Tony is laughing too, shoukders shaking and tears running down his face.
I know, I know. Y'all can yell at me all you want about how frustrating it is that Steve is so oblivious to what's going on with his body. I promise you, I will yell along with you. Steve is clearly in denial.
Tony watched Steve leave until the blond disappeared into the crowd. He grinned at the number in his phone, pocketing the device and putting his sunglasses back into place. He turned around and walked into the bank.
When Steve opens his eyes again, they immediately fall onto the pink gift bag from Pepper. He still hadn't opened it yet.
"I woke up the day you were getting ready to leave and nothing felt right. And everyday while you were away it never felt right, everything just felt off. No matter who I spoke to or who I was with, everything felt different. And I - there's no way to explain it, maybe I'm paranoid or overthinking but I can't shake this feeling. I can't sleep because I dream about things that I have no right dreaming about. Not anymore. I'm happy here, I am. But how do I explain the thoughts that I keep on having?" he asked, taking a hand through his hair in agitation and frustration.
Something was amiss. And he was definitely not that much of a prick to let something like the argument that he and Tony were involved in stop him from thinking rationally. He needed to forget about their explosive argument if he wanted to help Tony, whether he was just messing around or if he was really in need. Not that he was willing to take the chance and put the phone down on the off chance that Tony really needed his help.
Hi everyone! I apologize for the five month long wait but school and exams are hectic at the moment. Thankfully, I only have two and a half months left until I am FINISHED! I thank each and every one of you for your patience while I sort my life out and try and work on writing this fic in what little free time I have❤️
"It's because I love you, dammit! Why can't you see that?" he bursts out and immediately regrets it. He made a grave mistake.
He can only watch as Natasha cuts her bagel in half and spreads cream cheese on one side, and strawberry jam on the other.
For the sake of the nausea that has suddenly reared its head and his churning stomach, he hopes that she doesn't eat the two together.
Well, he knew why, the reason was currently trying to persuade him to let them fall asleep on his shoulder (which he wasn't going to fall for, dammit, he wasn't a pushover) but wasn't very successful.
"Alright, Tony. Thank you for not bothering my patient. He needs his rest, and with you added in the mix that's highly impossible. I doubt you had a… What was it that you called it? Oh, right. A civil conversation. Maybe a slightly stilted one, of course, but I'll take what I can get. So long as my patient is calm and he isn't in a state, I can tolerate your presence."
He hands Steve his things and the blond stands, brushing himself off. "Fuck, I'm going to be late, " he mutters and Tony grins. So Blondie had no qualms with swearing.
The position isn't one that's comfortable, for either of them, and since he's no longer young and can sit all tangled up and at awkward angles, and Steve was still healing, it wasn't really ideal, but Steve wasn't crying anymore, and he seemed much better.
Seeing Steve like this is strange, rare. But he knows that beyond Steve's confident persona and the way he holds himself, he's the type of person to hold his heart on his sleeve. He's shy and insecure. And this situation seemed to bring all of the qualities that Steve tried to hide out into the light.
He's right and he hates himself. Bruce had informed him that Tony had woken up over and escaped from medbay to his lab in the interim that he had gone to get himself some tea from the communal kitchen.
The fact that she was painting her toenails crimson was definitely an obvious show of the state of mind she was in, which was the one where she was extremely close to either strangling someone, or killing them and hiding the body so that nobody could find the remains. Also, she had just
And as he said, it was a less than ideal situation. But Steve also knew that one could never truly be prepared for having a child. You could prepare for a long time and still be wholly unprepared when they came along, or you could be someone who never prepared, and when they came along everything kind of just slipped into place. You could never know with these sorts of things.
He can't help but chuckle bitterly, taking another swig of coffee from the pot. It was cold but he was too lazy to get up and fix another pot.
However, she inherited Steve's pouty lips. Which is something that will make it all the more harder for Tony to say no to in the future whenever she asks for something.
"Sir, what project can I assist you with today?" FRIDAY's calm voice came from the speakers hidden in all corners of the lab. He felt a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
He rushes through the motions of cleaning himself, then he towels himself dry and grabs any clothing from his closet that looks comfortable.
From the common room, they could hear what was being said. And the words that came flying out of their leaders' mouths like bullets, each one more poisonous and hurtful than the last, were borderline
When he waves the waiter over, Steve finally tears his eyes away from the window and glances at him in confusion.
"JARVIS, shut that off, now. And fire up the suit. Daddy needs some time to think," he said, getting out of his chair.
"I'll be here the entire time. I'll be awake if anything changes, promise. Sleep, Steve," Tony says. He brushes a couple of stray strands of hair out of Steve's face and smiles at him.
The nurse steps forward once more, an amused smile playing on her lips when she notices the baby seeking out something with her eyes tightly shut, mouth opening and closing quickly.
isn't completely better. In both mental and physical aspects, but I have yet to hear how you yourself are coping. I understand that this is new territory and it can be difficult to navigate, so how are you feeling?" she asks.
God, Tony missed Steve's laugh. Tony bit his lip to stop the whimper escaping but Steve still heard. Damn super-soldier with his super hearing. "Doll?" Steve asked worriedly.
It's as he's drinking from the cup and trying not to burn his tongue as he takes big gulps in his haste to get back down to the medical floor that he realizes that the brew was one that Steve introduced him to.
It's not highly unusual that he's hidden himself away in the lab under the guise of needing to finish up a few pressing designs for the new StarkPhone. He snickers when he realizes that he's lying to himself again. Who is he kidding? He finished those designs a month ago, and was already working on the upgrades for the 'new' StarkPhone.
The nurse hovers in the background, and when Steve looks up he can see her watching with a smile on her face.
Immediately his ears were assaulted with noise. Beside him, Tony laughed, then moved closer to him so that he could see everyone.
He had known that his life was messed up and tried to reach out to Bruce for help after the whole thing with the Mandarin but not even Bruce could help him. So he tried to help himself. He cleaned up his 'playboy' act and got married to Steve. They even adopted Peter, also famously known as Spiderman. And then Steve decided to throw everything away. He left Tony, his husband, and his own son. He threw it all away for his best friend who couldn't even remember him properly, but rather small figments of their friendship, fleeting memories of his former life before becoming the Winter Soldier.
They go out a few more times, spending as little as half an hour to as much as two hours together. They aren't dates, just… gatherings. Outings. Two people getting to know each other.
He can feel the beginnings of a smile coming on, and can tell that Steve sees it too because he smiles somewhat shyly, pulling him closer until they were in each others' space.
It's weird to think that a stranger that he's never spent more than five minutes with really cares about his well-being. And hearing Steve scold him about joking about his life and the possibility of someone stalking him makes him uncomfortable. He doesn't know what to do with himself.
Tony seems to be on board with discontinuing the disaster they were heading towards in conversation and steers it in the opposite direction.
His run with Sam was good, not like it usually was. And no matter how much Sam spoke, he couldn't really concentrate on anything that Sam had to say. He made sure to smile and to laugh and to make the right sounds whenever Sam looked his way for some sort of response, and it seemed to please Sam.
When they finally pull away from each other, they're both smiling. Steve looks significantly less stressed and he gives himself a mental pat on the back.
Which Tony wasn't supposed to know about but he did. Tony's therapist had helped him a lot, but not everything was fixed. He still felt torn in between running after Steve and dragging him back home to live with him and Peter to staring into space, thinking of how Steve hurt him. And it hurt because he loved Steve and getting hurt by the ones you love was the worst way to get hurt.
When he reaches the medical floor, it's busier than it was earlier, but not overly so; there is more medical staff walking around, and he could see a few men and women dressed in business attire, which made him put them into the 'employee of Stark Industries' category, and not 'family who were visiting patients' category.
Despite his previous fears, Steve couldn't be any more lucky than what he currently was; he had a boyfriend who loved him for who he was (no matter how short he was!) and they had a baby on the way.
, think of it as being roommates. I won't bother you, and I'll stick to my half of the penthouse. You won't even know I'm there. You won't see or hear anything from me. Promise," Tony said.
