"Ha, well sorry to disappoint but you won't find anything kinky in there." Castiel paused and nuzzled at Dean's ear and purred "that's all in my mind." Dean felt a chill run up his spine at Castiel's words.
"I'm Castiel Novak," the man walks over and lifts his strong, smooth hand but Dean just looks from his hand to his blue eyes and then shakes his head and looks away.
“Work? Really? Because now, not only does half the campus know I’m an omega now those assholes are going to tell the goddamn world about us!”
“Dean, are you sure not telling them you were mated was a good idea?” Cas asked anxiously from the passenger side, bouncing his foot.
“Yes, he has a nice ass, couldn’t help myself.” Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and pulled him to their seats to wait for the class to start. After a few moments of silence Dean pulled out the contract and a pen. Trying to ignore the odd looks from behind them.
Dean had other plans for Cas so he pulled his mouth off and sat back on his knees. His own cock was at full attention again, pressed against his silk panties.
"I can give orders just fine, and I'm not just some omega. I am your son's mate and sadly that makes me part of your pack but if you can't accept that I can play the omega, beta, and
“And who is that?” The oldest man in the room asked, wisps of gray speckled his hair and his voice was gritty. He had deep set frown lines and bags, he seemed like a very unpleasant man and Dean was guessing that was Castiel’s father, Azazul.
"Are you saying someone is going to walk in on this?” He motioned at their bodies that were tied together.
“Do we really need this? I mean we both obviously know how sex works.” Dean whispered over to Cas, a little while later, sitting very low in his theater style chair, hiding his face from the teacher, standing in front of the class and giving the lesson.
"So I don't have long, why not get your self-lubricating ass dressed and meet me in the lobby because we are gonna grab some grub." Jo gave a smile and nod at Cas and accusing look at Dean.
"Just how do you think you can do that" Dean recollected himself, he had to make sure no emotions came through.
"Yeah I guess, maybe he's acts like that because I'm an omega." Lies. "Guess he just wants to be friends." Lie? Yeah, totally just friends. "Thanks, Jo." What a pointless call, at least he got to keep in touch with her. He did miss her a lot but this was one confusing ass situation and Jo was not the one to confide in.
“Look who is home and he brought a guest!” Jo announced to the family in the room. All eyes averted to the door and Castiel felt like he was put in the spotlight. The mix of smells was overwhelming, each one similar to the next. One smelt of whiskey and old books. Another was light and clean, fresh-cut grass and running water. That one was like Dean.
"I- don't know. Didn't really feel it that much." Castiel looked over Dean's irritated back. His knees were nothing but a little red compared to this.
"Remember Beckett you only say that around daddy and papa." Gabriel dried his hands off and ruffled his daughters soft curls.
Castiel still had the sinking feeling Dean was taking steps backward, building up his wall and locking him out. It was something Castiel wasn't going to let happen.
"No matter, I didn't come here to judge you on perspiration." Dean commented eagerly sipping his too hot coffee and burnt his tongue.
"Looking for this?" Dean turned around at the sound of an English accent and saw a beta behind him, offering up the book he needed.
It didn’t escalate to more than long relaxed kisses, the give, and take of mouths and moans. The touch of skin and winding of legs was what filled their mornings. It was amazing to touch Cas like this, to forget about everything that caused him stress over the past few weeks.
“Come here puppy,” A raspy voice called trying to antagonize Castiel and knew his cover was blown. “Don’t wanna hurt ya now.” The man sneered and made his way towards Castiel who although cloaked in darkness was probably giving off his scent like mad. With the element of surprise torn from him, he was sent into attack mode. From that shadows, Castiel charged the rugged blonde alpha who stood in the dim glow of an aged porch light. His lips curled into a smile and held his arms open as an invitation for Castiel.
"This mating deal, you know put in what we will and won't do. You know so you don't abuse my heats." Castiel scoffed and sat up.
“Any that I can make you scream.” It was a deep growl and his breath prickled his skin. Dean didn’t want another emotional night, he learned a lot about Castiel today and the thing in the car was in the past. Castiel was loyal, and just like last night he always came through.
"God Dean, I'm coming now I’ll be there in a few minutes. Just stay put please."  Castiel ended the call and Dean pocketed his phone. Letting out a large breath he leaned his head back into the cool metal of the car. Closing his eyes he tried to block out the pain and cold.
“Fuck, Cas, yes.” Even after all this time “going at it like rabbits” the feeling of Cas entering was still so good it sent a jolt of electricity all the way up to Dean’s belly button and down to his toes. They both began to move, and the feeling was just right, they knew each other so well, they could take their time, please each other in just the right way without having to ask what the other wanted.
They continued on the road for another two hours until they could find a kids store that was open. They were about twenty minutes from Castiel’s house so they decided to pull into the next shop they saw. Dean pulled into a rather upscale strip mall. It has designer stores and nice restaurants but they had their eyes on the childrens boutique.
Castiel lowered his hand and grabbed Deans cock. He pumped him at the speed of his thrusts, Dean was breathless with cries.
"Shh, I haven't seen you in a long ass time and I want to meet this new mate of yours. Don't fight with me Castiel. I will win." Cas sighed and rested his head in his hands.
“Dean!” They shouted in unison as a flood of them stood up to pass the omega around for a hug. He hadn’t been home in a terribly long time and missed every holiday get together there was. Castiel hung back with Jo who placed a hand on his lower back. He seemed to of gone unnoticed so far and he was grateful, that was except for a large brown-haired man who was making a beeline straight for him. He was intimidating in his walk and sharp features, his hazel eyes caught Castiel’s and he didn’t break contact but only puffed up. He had a rather large height advantage over him.
“No, none of this is really screaming Beckett.” He let out a defeated sigh but walked toward the back of the store knowing he had to find something here. His eyes skimmed over soft teddy bears and pink and yellow stitched kittens.  Glass picture frames with names printed on them and onesies that read “Future Alpha”. Castiel especially disliked that one.
“No, that is all in the past. I lived with them for some time, when my dad would get really pissed at me. Sammy, Adam, and I were like the damn three musketeers. I’m four years older so I would always get us into the craziest shit.” Dean didn’t realize how much he had been rambling, Castiel was clearly enjoying himself but Dean cut himself off. “But yeah, that’s it.”
Dean walked into his class and took his normal seat in the back. As usual he pulled out a piece of scrap paper and started doodling lines, shapes and sketches of cars. His friend Pamela, if you could call her that, took her seat beside him and leaned over a little too close. Sound like you're scratching away like a mad man.” She took in Dean smell quickly, it was how she could easily communicate. “and you smell odd, obviously like sex." She sniffed the air again. "Casual sex? Aren't you mated?" She whispered so the professor was not distracted and continued on oblivious the them in the back.
“Oh my god, Cas I can’t take you anywhere!” Dean said, voice slightly raised, but in the quiet of the coffee shop, his voice boomed. Cas’ face sobered again, he opened his mouth to speak and Dean cut him off again “Nope! Nope, that’s it, we’re going home. Now.” Dean began pulling on his arm and leading him to the door. Cas tried to sputter out an apology.
“My dad’s got your back, so’s my mom. No need to get your feathers ruffled. Plus since Sam and I already know...and Adam we got you.”
Castiel didn't want to give all the details and frankly, Dean didn't want to know. It was a tender topic and Dean was determined to work him past it. But it explained a lot of why Cas was so scared of bottoming, even if it was with Dean. That didn’t change his past so they would play by Cas’ rules, Dean could live with that.
They registered as mated at the main campus building and Dean had to come out and complain that he was wrongly put down as a beta and would like to be registered as an omega. Since he had been registered as a beta from the beginning a few strings had to be pulled by Castiel but they managed to come out with no problem. They did had to attend a mandatory Sex ED class. All register mates in college must attend it since normal people start their pack within a few months of mating.  Dean’s odd pull towards Cas went away with his heat and he was finally starting to feel like himself again. He was still somewhat mad over the dilemma but he didn’t blame Castiel much anymore, Dean wasn’t in his right mind that night either. It wasn’t like Castiel cornered him like Alistair tried to do.
“Oh, Clarence.” Dean spoke in his most over-exaggerated moan he could manage. He felt Castiel go completely stone still under him, Dean could barely hold back a laugh. He felt Castiel’s hands move out from under his shirt and wrap around to press onto his chest.
“Your new brother.” Dean decided he might as well go all out with the family that Cas actually liked. Anna pulled away from Dean to look him over, her eyes landed on the ever present bite mark Castiel gave him.
Dean wanted a pup like her, he craved one, for he and Cas to raise and love and nurture. Dean knew exactly why Castiel loved this little girl so much and why he was so protective of her. He stood up for her life against his family and if those alpha had won Dean wouldn't have this moment right now. This moment of realization that he wanted a family and soon. He has never wanted to get out of college faster.
“No reason, thanks for the coffee.” Castiel smiled and ruffled his brothers hair from over the counter. Grabbing his coffee he bid his goodbye and took one last look around. This shop strived on its regulars. There are only two rush hours and the rest of the day Cas could sit and talk with his brother.
“We goin’?” Dean asked, reaching out a hand to Cas. Castiel bit his lip and took it as they walked out to Dean’s car. Cas thought the car ride would be dead silent, but it wasn’t. “Ramble On” played as they drove around looking for a good burger place. They talked amiably about classes, made fun of teachers and peers, and sang some of the lyrics as well.
"My, uh my brother just called. I've told you about him. Gabriel, he's the omega. Well it's Beckett's birthday this weekend and I have to go and he, he wants me to bring you." Dean's smile left his lips and his eyes widened.
“Dean, you don’t have to hide yourself anymore, you’re a twenty-two year old man and I know deep down you like being an omega, like deep down in the dark corners of your soul, so deep people stopped looking. Go find an alpha who doesn’t stop looking and have some pups because you may deny it but I know how you feel. Screw your dad and out yourself, I’m sure you will feel so much better.” Dean paused taking in everything she said.
I had surgery so I have been a little out of it... and by that I mean sleeping and watching so much Xena Warrior Princess it should be illegal!
Dean’s mind slowly wandered from the growing rhythm back to their previous endeavor. Dean thought about everything they would have needed, supplies, food, clothes for himself, and the pups. Formula; most definitely formula, Dean was totally pro-natural except for himself. There were few things he refused to welcome with being a male omega and that would be nursing.
"Oh shit, Cas, you never told me you were a closet hipster." Dean teased bumping their shoulders. Cas smacked his arm.
"You look so good in my clothes. You should wear them more often." Castiel arched his neck to give Dean better access. It was such a submissive move but neither of them cared. Dean loved touching and smelling Cas and Cas loved the soft tickle of Dean's stubble.
Dean had come up with a steady routine of waking up, classes, and if it's not too late they go grab lunch with Rachel or Alfie and shortly after that, sex. Yeah, Dean was making up for every lost night of contact ten-fold and every night was something different.
“This could be life-threatening, I must take care of you, I made an oath,” Castiel spoke so dramatically it sounded like he stumbled out of soap opera. “Now relax, this is a very touchy matter.” At that, they both lost it and it took a few seconds for them to collect themselves.
“Oh Clarence, just relax. No need to bother mommy dearest.” Cas looked like he might vomit. He refused to look at her. His body tensed visibly, and with a stony-face he stared at the wall behind Dean.
He knew Castiel would have questions but that wasn't the problem at the moment. He knew almost everyone knew he was an omega, but he couldn't think clearly when it felt like every move he made was being monitored. Soaping himself down was the next step, especially in between his legs and his tight hole that hadn't been stretched in a few days. That thought alone made him sick, his own paranoia was effecting his and Cas' sex life. It had to change and soon before Castiel got the wrong idea.
"Yeah, I totally agree we have plenty of time. So much we don't even have to think of that for a long time." Cas nodded as if approving his words. Not realizing how stupid he sounded.
Stripping down he jumps in the shower. He sits under the water as it warms to a burning temperature. Water trickled down every curve of his body he took in the steam in deep breaths. Squeezing a generous amount of soap into his hand he rubs down his body. Over slender muscles and freaked shoulders he rolled the knots out of his body. This was a daily routine for Dean, but lately he has been extremely cautious around Castiel.
With one last tug, Dean felt the incredible relife of freedom as the rope slid free of his aching wrists. Rolling them a few times he stood up and tried to gather himself, his head still throbbed and he had a gash that was still bleeding on his forehead. He took quick stock of the room that was almost completely barren save the chair and rope. Pocketing the rope for future use he quietly made his way into the small room and only found an empty bottle of booze.
Dean heartbeat was blasting in his ears he was so close he could smell him through the open window to the left of him. Stopping completely he closed his eyes and tried to listen in on the voices to see if Dean was in the room above him. He heard slight mumbling between two men.
Drugged that was it, the last thing he remembered was the library. Dean studied the room, his hands were tied in a decent knot, but he could probably get out of it. The real problem was who took him and why. As far as omegas go he is no prize. He is too big, tall, and muscular. Even his cock is intimidating to some alphas. He wasn’t small not physically or mentally so they must want something else. As if some absent god answered his question the door at the top of the rotting wooden stairs opened. The slow creaking footsteps reminded him of every damn horror movie he had ever seen. The worst part was he was playing the trite role of the omega in distress. But the man proceeded to come closer.
Castiel’s face immediately lit up once he saw what it was, Dean’s bedroom. Complete with ACDC, Metallica, Aerosmith, and Zeppelin posters. It was nearly spotless, Castiel was guessing Mary did a quick once over before Dean arrived. He had a twin bed with very familiar blue sheets and a single nightstand that held a lamp and clock. Dean’s room didn’t have a theme or color scheme. More an accordant of necessities that somewhat matched. A light wooden desk with half-peeled off stickers and some marker stains with a rolling chair that had a few rips in it. His rug was a very dark green and his floor had scuffs near his bed. The armoire was a washed-out white and leaned somewhat crooked and it was all so Dean. Castiel loved it.
"Nope but I'm sure it's what makes shit taste good." Dean shoved another handful in his mouth. Castiel chucked and took a few chips too.
A low growl formed in Castiel chest and he lunged for Dean's lips capturing them in a tangle of tongue and teeth clanking. With rain sliding between their lips. Dean melted in instantly he wanted answers but in his gut he could feel Castiel, his emotion and his longing for the comfort of Dean.
"Well, yeah just...not my thing I guess." Cas mumbled. There are things Dean never had to know, he was leaving eventually anyway.
“Why the fuck” Cas paused, thrusting up twice “are we” *one more thrust* “talking about” *thrust* “groceries!” and with that Castiel came so hard inside of Dean that he saw stars. Pushing Dean forward onto his face, his arms flattened out in front of his. He looked like a cat stretching out in the sun. Wrapping his hands around blood thick cock he pumped in time with his thrusts as he rode out his own orgasm, playfully tugging knot against Dean’s rim. Dean came with a shiver and a small whimper. It was a stain they would have to clean off the carpet. Joining Dean, Castiel pushed them both to the scratchy carpet and spooning up to him. Dean started laughing as Cas nuzzled into his neck
Dean must have fallen asleep or dazed out because the next thing he realizes Castiel's warm hands are moving across his body.
Slowly closing his eyes Dean felt as if he fell asleep instantly. The blaring sound of “Heat Of The Moment” seemed to wake him up just seconds after he closed his eyes but it was early morning.
“No, mom everything's just peachy but I have to cut this short because GAH-” Dean shouted as Castiel nuzzled him off the bed and pinned him to the ground, licking strips up Dean’s neck he was defeated. With Castiel straddling his hips he placed a hand lightly on the alphas back and breathed in a deep breath before talking to him mom once more.
“Umm, well did you see anyone online who you liked?” Castiel asked twirling his thumbs on his bed. He was slightly hesitant to go to someone. What if Dean hates him after all of this? What if he hurts Dean in the process? No, Castiel just needed a little more time.
With that Dean dove into the bottom drawer and opened the door looking over all the shampoos and soaps they had bought on impulse. He scanned over all the bottles until he spotted the ones he needed. Pulling them out he didn't even bother to close the door as he jumped into the steaming water.
"No that's the weird part, he gave me a book but it was like being in his damn bubble coated me." Dean took a few more fries and dipped them in ketchup. "Apparently he is in one of my classes. I've never seen him before but he had the book I needed so I guess he is."
“Yes, we kept him pretty for you.” Crowley leaned up against the wall with his phone in hand. The room had three other men in it who were sitting around a table full of cards. “Yes, but I told you before he was lightly used…” Crowley listened to the man on the other line talk. “Yes he has a mark and it’s visible but how often will he even see sunlight for others to notice it.” The man over the phone’s voice grew louder and Crowley’s facade cracked a little. Thankfully it was over the phone and not in person. “So you’re asking me to shave a few thousand off because he’s no knot virgin? Come on we all know the good ones are always second hand. I could have found you a crisp one, but you were so specific in what you wanted he is a one and a million omega. I don’t think you could find another like him.” Crowley waited and listened to the man and nodded. “I’ll see you soon, yes sir.”
"It's instinct, Dean your mind and body know what you want. It knows what it needs for a pack. I mean think of our ancestors you think they had conversations about what they wanted. It just clicks in your mind and once you know there's no going back. What, did you find someone?" Sam asked like he was finally catching up to the punch line.
“Good.” Dean glanced over his shoulder at Cas who was looking at him. There was a still moment between them, then as if the two of them were struck by lightning their mouths came together in the middle. Dean slowly twisted in his seat, having not put his seatbelt on yet, and stroking Cas’ cheek. He could feel himself getting hot, his body tingled like being licked with fire, he was so turned on. Was this how sex was going to be now? Damn, he may never get the hang of his heats.
Dean started pacing and walked into the bathroom, he always had to be alone for important phone calls so Castiel let him be.
"Castiel is one funny wolf, he can spend hours a day looking around the forest at our house without a care in the world but growing up he always had such a serious demeanor. It was really funny sometimes, you could tell a joke and he would just squint at you and in his little voice say "I don't understand that reference." Man it would crack Gabriel and I up. That's what I find so strange about you two." Dean raised an eyebrow and cut it.
Pushing Dean back he launched into the dominant position and started unbuttoning the shirt he gave to Dean. Once he saw his bare chest Castiel dove in. Sucking and nipping at every inch of hot skin he could get his teeth on. Dean panted under him and bucked up desperate for friction. Trailing Castiel’s nails down Dean’s chest he rolled his nipple between his fingers. Sliding his tongue over the other one Castiel sucked the hardening nub until small cries filled the room. His arousal mixed with Dean’s and created a sweet smell of honey and sweets. Castiel’s teeth sharpened slightly and he started placing small bite marks across Dean’s chest, making sure none of them broke skin.
"Hon?" John stepped in and was greeted by the soft smile of his wife and his son who she was attempting to feed.
They told Kevin their shoe sizes and received the boots. Cas paid the rental fee, even though Dean said he'd pick up the tab.
“Are you telling me you two have been faking this crap since last night?” Gabriel started laughing as it started to click in. “Why the hell would you be fake mates? Just unmark him and be buddies if that’s what you want.”
"If this is your first heat then it will be back in about half an hour or sooner, don't let anyone in and if you have to take a cold shower, it should help. I'll be back." Castiel always takes things like this seriously, yes the marking may of got out of hand but Dean got himself off and Cas is still hard and pent up with the smell of sweet omega coming off his new shirt. He runs into the bathroom and sprays down their room and put a towel at the crack under the door.
"Don't be a punk okay." Dean walked between Adam and Sam and tried to help them for their first day. Dean was four years older but he had to be held back one year in kindergarten and another in the first grade, because of that he was a senior and his little brothers were freshmen.
They didn’t speak about the events that transpired in the bedroom after that. Castiel Was able to stay unwaveringly chipper throughout Beckett’s party. Dean must have reeked of worry because Balthazar came over to him. He was leaning against one of the walls in the tiny living space watching Castiel play amiably with Beckett. He was holding a paper party cup with Pascal, Rapunzel’s pet chameleon in the Disney movie Tangled on it.
"Oh fuck, do you know how pissed he is going to be when he find out I blew it and now I'm a public omega." Dean started pacing, Castiel could smell the worry on Dean. “I mean do you know what he’ll do to me?” Dean’s face was burning up and his throat tightened. This, this is what hell was like.
“The green of your eyes.” Dean froze for a second until he fell back into kissing Castiel. Pushing on the alphas shoulder he laid him flat on the bed as Dean crawled up to straddle his hips.
"I uh- oh god I forgot to get her something!" Castiel jumped up and ran into the bathroom to comb his hair and brush his teeth then scurried to get dressed. "We need to leave right now and stop along the way to get her something!" Castiel's was in a frenzy and was moving like a tornado through their dorm.
It was almost three in the morning when they woke up tangled together in Dean’s bed. Dark red sheets caught in their legs.
"No problem, Dean." The soft jazz was just loud enough to hear over the chatter of students. Dean rarely stayed at the shop, he enjoyed the coffee and it was a short walk from his dorm.
“No, those are seducing words.” With a sly smile Castiel grabbed the tube of body soap and poured some onto his hand. Stepping over to stand chest to chest with Dean he smiled and wrapped his soap covered hand over Dean’s half hard cock. Gaining a yelp from Dean.
Dean let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding, he had never been so close to being found out. He can’t remember waking up so hard since he was young. Maybe he had something really wrong with him, it’s not like he can go to the doctor and say he’s an omega registered as a beta.
Dean slowed and made a left to go behind his dorm and towards the parking lot. Slowing down to the designated speed Dean caught a figure out of the corner of his eye. Crowley.
“Why so glum?” Dean asked as he made his way over to Cas, running his hand through Cas’ already wind blown and messy hair. Pushing away all memories from before.
"I'm leaving for my parents' today, smartass." Then Cas stopped he dropped his bag and he and Dean looked at each other for a few seconds.
Dean dresses himself in jeans and a band shirt and headed off towards the library to get a head start on everything. He can already tell this week is going to be hell.
“Ain't nothin’ wrong with how I speak my English!” Castiel only laughed in reply and Dean joined in soon after.
“Well, you’re the first person I’ve, really, slept with.” Castiel said, choosing his words carefully.
“Not that I know of... do you see something?”  Castiel joined Dean and looked over the many choices. Then he saw the gold locket that hung all the way to the right.  Castiel reached out and grabbed it carefully the chain was cold in his hand and the heart shaped locket popped open. There was a section for a picture on one side and on the other it said ‘Dream Big, Little One’, once Castiel saw the light reflect off the small locket he knew this was it.
The car ride was filled with chatter even after his brothers left, his father kept talking about what it was like to be an alpha, and Mary kept trying to keep it neutral to show that no matter what he brings his great personality with him.
John disappeared once again. Even though it seemed nice it put a strain on the pack and Castiel couldn't help think it was his fault. One of the key leaders was missing and there was a looming sense of emptiness.
“Over here!” He yelled out as the car headlights illuminated him. “Please help my mate is hurt!” He ran to the driverside as a large black haired alpha stepped out. Hand holstered on his gun he looked at Dean with concerned eyes.
"Fuck Dean, fuck!" He sped up as a response and Cas started to swell. Pumping a few times he started to gag on Castiel’s knot. Water splashed his face and Dean squeezed his eyes shut and took Cas deeper.
"What is all this healthy stuff, salt free popcorn? What kind of a house doesn't have salt? Low sodium freaks!" Castiel held back a snicker as Dean went on about the horrible selection of food he had to choose from and how they were worse than his brother.
Castiel lead the way and opened the door, small bell announced their arrival and a heavy eyed old man sat behind the counter. Many of the things in the store were hand crafted and it ranged from handmade baby clothes to hand painted toys and cribs. Castiel was at a loss, nothing in here made him think of Beckett.  Dean stepped next to Cas and pressed his hand into Castiel’s lower back.
"Just wanted to say, the second I met you I know you were an omega." For the second time in an hour Dean was left speechless.
He didn't have to step into the light for Dean to know who he was. The odd sulfur scent gave him away, for a beta he could sure stink up the place and it made the man impossible to forget in Dean's memory. "Crowley." Dean is highly unamused and refused to panic in the betas present, why should he? Years of training and they have finally come in handy.
"Cas, stop." He meant to say it louder but once the words left his lips Castiel froze and almost lost balance. Just like that the sharp nails in his thighs smoother out and the thick smell of over dominant alpha lessened in the air. He was one hundred percent Castiel.
"Well because Rachel and I are sitting here and your bed seems to be empty." Dean paused. Mother fucker. Wait, who the fuck is Rachel?
“I know,” Dean winked. “But we should probably leave.” Castiel nodded and tried to get out of the car without brushing his cock on his jeans too much. He hoped it would go down on the way home, but he was never that lucky. Well he did stumble upon Dean so maybe he was.
“Dean?” Cas knocked on the door, Dean didn’t answer him. “Come on Dean, please?” Just hearing the apologetic low rumble of the alpha’s voice made his body tremble. He needed Cas, more than he did last night. Way more. He was determined to stay angry.
"You're alone, I offered my services when you were wet and needy. Now I need you to help me, it’s only fair." A growl was forming deep in Alistair's chest his nasally lisp gave Dean chills and he knew he was going to have to fight himself out of this one.
“I’m not, just kinda thinking.” Cas stood and placed a kiss on Dean’s temple. Since the attack they shared more affectionate moments and soft kisses, it was comforting for the both of them.
“Winchester and Novak.” Dean made sure not to let himself break from his hard-set mask of anger, even though he hated the idea of Crowley looking into his family.
Water collected in the corner of Dean’s eyes he was begging for release, his cock rubbing between his and Castiel’s stomach. Gasping, the only words falling from his lips were ‘Cas” and ‘fuck’. Castiel fucked Dean back down into the carpet once
"Shut the fuck up before I rip your throat out" blood leaked around Castiel nails as he cut off the mans air supply.
"We've been like this for a while now, your alpha hormones are probably just getting stronger. I think it’s normal, well for normal mates. For us it’s just well...more sex? If I bit you we'd be able to have that mind reading type sixth sense." Dean hadn’t mentioned the mental breakdown since Castiel seemed fine and Dean still couldn’t find anything on separating.
"You lucky bastard, you may find me hiding in there." His parents are very wealthy but only agree to give you a kick start allowance for an apartment if you are mated. That leaves many of his brothers at home.
“High-class bitch. I see his mark is still intact, even looks freshly bitten.” The man leaned farther in and extended his hand to touch Dean’s neck. A feral growl ripped from his chest and he lunged for the man's hand. His actions were quickly met by a backhand to the face. He was almost surprised by it but refused to react to the pain, Dean would not back down, he was falling to no one's feet.
It could in fact be that hard. Dean looked down at his place setting, there were three plates stacked on top of one another and more utensils than they had back at home in the silverware drawer. They all matched too, Dean marveled down at them, before looking helplessly over at Cas. He looked like a lost puppy dog. Cas snorted into his glass of water, dribbling it down his front.
"You're not the only one with good taste in music.” He teased sipping from his water. By the time the waitress returned with their milkshakes both of them were throwing their heads back and belting out "I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOUR LOVE, TONI-IGHT." The place was nearly empty so it's not like they were bothering anyone.
Just as he was prodding around at the knot a wash of energy flowed through him. It felt like a cold wave washing over his body and electrifying his muscles. Something so soothing and yet exciting came over him.
"I needed someone to talk to, not you - no offense or anything. I don't mean not you like I don't like talking to you but I couldn't because I had to talk about you. Calling Jo was a mistake and the only other person I could think of was Alfie so I went and we talked." Dean started pacing back and forth in front of Castiel. "I'm kinda confused about last night." Castiel cocked his head slightly.
"Oh god, Dean." Anna seemed worried and looked between him and the new woman. She smelt like whiskey and ash. Her dark curls framed her pale face. Dark red lipstick and charcoal eye shadow. She looked like someone who could put up one hell of a fight.
"Bloody toothbrush trick? Are you guys like twelve?" Jo asked from the corner of the room. Sitting backward on the desk chair.
“Not exactly, you may but your cycle is so irregular and new that your body may register that as a heat and go back on its regular, or as close to regular, to your other cycle.” Castiel scrolled a little and found that he got all he could out of the article so he decided to close out.
Wow, I've put way too much work into this to let it die on me. This story started in my junior year in high school and now I'm in college. The funny part is a while ago I planned a second story for this but I don't know how that could possibly work out...
Collecting himself in record time he shove the alpha off of him and pulled himself to his feet, slowly he started to limp away pausing for a second to see if Alistair was breathing. Once he confirmed it he continued towards the direction of his dorm. He would call in an anonymous tip to get Alistair out of the woods. Murder wasn’t on Dean’s list of things to do before he died, even if Alistar deserved it.
Castiel was gnawing on his lip, omegas rarely carry one pup, usually two or three. For god's sake some have four. But maybe it's genetic, Dean didn’t have a twin- he was a lone pup. But Mary was a beta and the chances of carrying twins are about forty-sixty, so it isn’t a surprise he was a single.
"Oh that's great, and yeah tell mom I'll be home soon. Probably for spring break." Damnit just spit it out! "Sam I have to tell you something." Fuck, he sounded like a babbling idiot.
“It’s fine baby, but we better go home before you kill someone for complimenting my shoelaces or something.” Cas and Alfie both laughed.
"No, no! It's my mess, I will clean it." he was crying all over one of Dean's shirts now. Dean lowered himself to Castiel’s face and looked at his red rimmed eyes.
“We’re going to fix this together.” He promised. Castiel scooted close, their foreheads were pressed together, they both snaked their arms around each other, tangling their legs in a full-body hug.
"I'm going to dislodge your jaw, Dean!" But he didn't listen and took Castiel's knot like a champ. It stretched his mouth to maximum capacity and he tried to keep up with the come sliding down his throat. Castiel’s nails dug into the tile and he leaned his head back, soaking in the pure bliss of his release. After a few moments Cas looked down with shock and amazement.
Dean brought his arms up to wrap around Castiel's neck and guide him up to his lips. It was a lazy effortless kiss. It wasn't hot and heavy, just their lips moving into the perfect rhythm and arms and legs winding around each other. They created a safe cocoon and continued to kiss until the haze of alcohol knocked Dean out.
Castiel snakes out of his jeans and pulled the comforter over their bare skin. Nuzzling close to his mate he traced shapes on Dean's arm. Castiel definitely got the better end of the deal.
16 year old me had a lot more planned for this ending. With everything that has happened in the years since I started posting this story I really never imagined I would be posting the ending and although it isn't anything like what I pictured I have to say I am so proud of myself for doing it. I make a habit of starting things and never following through and this story has sat in the back of my mind for YEARS taunting me. I will forever be grateful for every comment I received on this wild story. Writing is something I love doing but have a very hard time with.
"You're late." Dean's body felt heavy like weights were hanging from his arms and legs. It was a struggle turning his head and soon the pressure grew. Pressing on his chest and ribs he tried to identify the voice.
College wasn't really what Dean had expected. He was always terrified someone would sniff him out. Terrified an alpha would claim him without his approval. Terrified of so many things and he didn't have a room to hide in. But it was all so much better than being John's emotional punching bag. He could sleep in now, and exercise at his leisure.
“Mmm, I like it hard.” Castiel only chuckled and leaned to capture Dean’s eggar lips. Slipping his tongue in past Dean’s mouth he started an intense makeout session with an equally intense finger fucking.
“Yes, a movie this shit is crazy! And you don’t even tell your pack.” That was what Jo was really upset about.
“Oh, well have you met Dean’s alpha guardian? Where are his papers?” Castiel’s fork clattered to his plate.
"Fuck, Cas you're back!" Dean launched off his bed and grabbed Castiel. Running his hands over his chest and scenting his neck. Lightly rubbing their groins together. It’s a side of Dean Cas had never seen, he wasn’t a macho rigid shelled man. He was oddly affectionate, then again that was directly linked to the heat.
“Dean Ethan Winchester...DEW. You are damp grass.” Dean looked at Cas dead in the eyes for a few seconds until they both burst into a laughing fit.
"Of course I have, the game is pure luck, though." He replied, then hastily added, "It's fun though."
It was like an earthquake, their bodies slamming together one last time before an explosion of pleasure nearly knocked them out. Castiel was securely locked into Dean and they both were gasping for air. The energy was drained from every muscle in their body and they couldn't keep their eyes open. Castiel collapsed onto Dean and they both fell into an orgasm induced slumber.
I am not going to lie I really did not expect anyone to read that last chapter and within an hour of it being up, familiar faces started popping up. I can't tell you how amazing it is seeing you all! Thank you for giving this story a second chance and I hope I do justice by it! To tell you the truth I had the entire story planned out before writing it...everything but the end! I went over this chapter so many times changing it around trying to work it. I think I am happy with it. Again no editor I'm sorry I find It hard to catch my own mistakes!
“Mmm, good.” Cas sighed. Dean chuckled, running his wrist over Cas’ torso, scenting him. Cas did the same, scenting Dean’s neck and shoulders. They fell asleep like that Dean’s arms wrapped around Cas’ waist, and Cas’ encircling Dean’s neck. It wasn’t until a loud horn blared through the hallway that they both started awake, Castiel instinctively pulling Dean as close as possible. He earned himself a playful slap on the ass.
“Comeon baby, knot me, I’m begging you please!” Dean did his best to say it with a straight face. He reached between Castiel’s legs to start to rub his straining cock. “Come on, breed me up.” Dean purred closer to Castiel’s ear, he watched as the police officers face went red and eyes widened.
The next day Dean and Castiel awoke to the smell of bacon, eggs, and cinnamon. Dean's mouth was watering before his eyes even opened and his stomach clenched in hungry anticipation.
"How badly does it hurt?" Castiel came in, concerned voice and all with the same soothing gel he put on his rut burn in hand.
“Oh,  I’ll give you what you want. Just sit back and let me do the work.” Dean crawled on top of Cas and straddled his hips. “I recall you wanting to fuck me in panties, am I right?” A sly smile slid across Dean’s lip and he lowered himself to capture Castiel’s lips. Holding himself up with his knees Dean  reached behind himself and slid his hands into his underwear to work himself open. Castiel lifted his arm to replace Dean’s hand but he was slapped away. “Ah ah ah, keep your hands to yourself.” Castiel frowned but listened and pulled his arm back to his side and watched Dean. His underwear were pulled to the side and his cock was in full view. The smell of slick filled the room as Dean fingered himself. Adding a third he felt he was stretched enough.
"I am so sick of you shit, John! You think since I'm an omega I'm nothing without an alpha? Like I'm some lost fuck toy searching for a knot? Well, I am a person and I am done listening to you bash me for something I had no control over! So I swear to god the next omega bashing word that comes out of your mouth will get shoved down your throat so fast. I don't deserve all the crap you put on me!" John tightened his fist like he was going to hit Dean and the entire room was silent. "I wasn't born for you to brainwash me! So if you aren't going to be a grown-ass man about any of this then kindly fuck off!" Dean was panting and refused to break eye contact with his father. His eyes had small swirls of red around the pupil but he didn't speak.
"I don't go upstairs much. I have my own exit and all. I mean don't get me wrong I've been looking for a house for over a year now but since my parents don't count me as part of their pack anymore I have to come up with the money." Dean couldn't believe all of this was real, that he had mated into this psychotic family of knotheads.
“Sever the bond, breed you up. You may think you’re strong but after a while of being chained up, I’ll have you by your second heat, begging for me. Because you’re still a damn bitch with no self-control.” Dean went to snap at him but missed by barely an inch. “I’m sure any omega that comes from you will sell for a pretty penny, maybe even a beta. I can kill off any alphas, don’t need the competition in my home.” Alton was talking to Crowley. “May contact you to sell them off if they are any good.” Crowley nodded, this was obviously a big trade Dean had fallen into and this man was not only a collector but a supplier. Crowley was just the fucking middle man. It went far deeper than him and maybe even Alton. This man was by far the most disgusting person he had ever met, far worse than Alistair who was at the top of his list.
"Dean?" Castiel questioned looking at the omega over his book. "Did I forget something?" Castiel leaned back a little trying to keep some distance between them.
Dean's heat was a day, the shortest he had experienced in his few months of having it. Especially since it had been so long since his last, it was shocking to find that Castiel's knot had satisfied his cravings so quickly. Dean was thankful for such a short heat but it seemed to worry Cas. His father was a doctor but rarely (if ever) saw omegas so he wasn't fully informed on these things.
It was so still at this time of night and even the spring bugs seemed to be quieter near this side of town. There was a dump and a chop shop in this area but not much else. No street lights or signs of life anywhere. The buildings seemed neglected and worn down. Unkept brick showed years of wear and some were falling apart. This part of town had not been inhabited for years. The farther down he ran the stronger Dean’s smell got. Castiel could feel his skin crawling, he knew he couldn’t transform but if he could he was sure this is what it would feel like.
Dean had fully intended this to be a fun night with sex at the end but as they say; the best-laid plans. It actually turned out better. With their competitive spirits clashing they had played every game from bullshit to go-fish and it left them exhausted and brains fried.
Standing up Dean moved himself in front of Castiel, pushing him back on the bed closer to the headboard. Once he felt he had enough room Dean crawled after Cas who still hasn’t spoken.
"What religion are you? Last I checked this week isn't anything special." Castiel started to open his eyes and stretch.
Suddenly Castiel had the urge to get up and walk to Dean and scent him, claim him again and again until it was as if he had a bright neon sign that screamed ‘taken’ for all to see. Castiel got out of bed and walked over to the bathroom but just before he could grab the knob it opened and Dean was slightly startled at Castiel proximity Dean couldn’t even manage a word before Castiel pressed into him lovingly, rubbing his wrists across Dean’s bare chest and stomach to mark him, nuzzling and licking up his pulse point. Dean gave a soft moan of approval and he tilted his head back to give Castiel more access. Castiel’s lips moved to his clavicle as he continued to mark him with the smell of rut.
“How is he at taking orders.” A deep voice asked, finally making their way down the steps Dean finally saw who he assumed to be his buyer. He was much older than Crowley and very heavy set with a gray receding hairline and a widow's peak that seemed to be clinging onto his forehead by only a few strands. Dean was disgusted by the man, he had the scent of many other omegas on himself and guessed Dean was not his first purchase.
“Dean?” Castiel turned and looked at him shocked. Dean’s face went from slightly irritated to entirely pale in 0.2 seconds flat.
Dean turned the knob and opened the door to find Castiel and a chipper blonde woman with tight jeans and a pink blouse on.
“Just accept defeat you know you’re excited for the pair I have in mind.” Castiel twitched slightly, hoping Dean’s imagination wouldn’t go too far.
They both felt confused as hell and their bodies natural instance and chemical changes only made it harder to keep their actions anywhere near platonic.
“Oh, well you sound like Gabriel, Alfie, and I. We would sneak out into the back woods and play hunt. Who ever could sneak up and tackle the other first. We played to ten and Ann would always come out and yell at us, she was like a mom back then.” Castiel smiled at the nostalgia of his childhood, back when everyone was an ‘alpha’ before Gabriel was exiled and Cas saw the true faces of his parents.
“Don’t add it if you aren’t, comfortable with it. I’ve gone many years dealing with rut, it’s no problem.”
Dean was pacing back and forth, it was dark now and the trees and cool fresh air cleared his mind. He was so pissed, infuriated with his father. The man who was so ashamed of his son he drugged him up and threw him on suppressants. Not even bothering to tell him the consequences. The health problems, anything about it. Yeah he could have researched it on his own and he should have. How could he have thought to trust him with anything?
"Yes, much. Thanks Cas." Dean watched their reflection in the mirror. Odd how well they slotted together like puzzle pieces. Castiel placed a kiss on Dean’s shoulder he patted his ass.
"Dean, I don't expect you to go. I am going because Beckett means the world to me. It will only be a few days. Yeah, my family can be intimidating. Alfie will be there and I think you'd like Gabe. I just ask that while I'm gone you stay away from the woods." Dean still didn't seemed satisfied. They stayed quiet until Castiel's knot went down. They got back into their pajamas and went to bed, Dean opting to sleep in his for the first time in over two weeks. Castiel didn't say anything.
"Swear to god if you keep calling me that I'm calling you Big Daddy." Castiel's face twisted into a sour expression.
It seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough. He would still be drugged, raped, and sold. It seemed that no matter what he did that was his future.
"Fuck your dad three ways from Sunday. Come on Dean, would he rather you be a lone omega or a mated one?" Dean pauses and looked Cas over. Nodding his head.
Dean woke up with the sun heating hs face and the deep breathing of his alpha. The view of the barren trees was amazing and the sky was bright, the only downside was the sickening smell of alpha seeping from under the door. Dean could already hear people moving around outside the door. Castiel was still fast asleep and Dean's stomach was growling. Dean decided to slip around Castiel and picking up his clothes from the floor. Dressing himself he made his exit in search of Anna. Looking around upstairs there was no sign of Castiel's sister.
"I-just nothing, just normal class shit." Dean gave a weak smile and sat down on the edge of the bed running his hands through his short hair.
“There is a man downstairs, I don’t know if he is alive, and, him,” Dean said quietly lifting a hand to point at Crowley who was still unconscious. The female beta nodded her head and drew her weapon as she entered the back of the house.
Dean thinks back to his research from the beginning of the year. One way to break it was to kill one of the two. But the other one wouldn't go off to find another mate, mating was lifelong even if they killed off Cas. Dean growled slightly knowing he would still be connected to him and he would fall to no new feet
"Oh god Cas, knot me please please knot me!" It became a chant for Dean his fucked out voice made Castiel dizzy.
“Damn I was supposed to study today.” He announced, realizing at once what time it was. Cas laughed in reply,
"Not everyone in my family is an alpha. My, my brother Gabriel is an omega. My parents exclude him from all family affairs. No one outside our family really knows about him. He can only leave the house with two or more alphas. And my fuckup of brothers got wasted and ditched him in this seedy city one night. He- he was raped, he conceived. My parents wanted him to abort it but my sister Anna, Samandriel, and I stood by him. She's five now and I love her so much. But that doesn't mean what was done to him is acceptable. It's sick and you would know that about me if you didn't judge the second you met me."
“Dean-” Cas sighed burying himself inside his omega, biting down on his side, right below his shoulder blade.
He was excited, his father said he already knew Dean was an alpha based on his personality and athletic traits.
“Yeah, for the most part, now I just want to stay cocooned in bed with you.” Cas nuzzled Dean’s stomach once more.
Dean was wearing a very nice pair of dark wash jeans and a light blue plaid shirt buttoned all the way up. He was lacing on his well-worn combat boots when Cas returned. Cas blinked. He hadn’t seen him in anything but band shirts and his ripped weathered jeans. Dean was practically wearing a suit right now in Cas’ eyes.
Castiel had already embarrassingly popped his knot at the sight of Dean's shivers and wanton moans. For almost the entire time Dean’s eyes were shut and he hadn't known why he was the one who woke him up with pleading calls of Castiel's name and rutting hips. His heat had finally come and it was a relief not only to pick up their stalled sex life but that Dean's body was picking back up to its normal routine and that eased the fears within him.
Dean didn’t realize where he was walking until he reached the black shine of his smooth car, instantly some anger lifted from him as he climbed inside the back. The cool drag of leather across his bare arm was so soothing. It was too cold in his car to be comfortable but it would do for the night. Trying to block out any thought he pulled out his MP3 out and played his favorite songs and thought of the sound of the impala driving down the highway with the music blaring and windows sown, he found sleep. Cold, lonely sleep.
The walls were still barren despite the fact they had been living here for a few months. Castiel didn't bring much to college and Dean always talked about hanging something up but never bothered to do it. Dean was much neater than Castiel had anticipated. He wouldn't go as far to call him a germaphobe...well not out loud anyway.
"It's like, roommates with benefits. We have sex, and get the perks of mates without being mates." Castiel moved under the spray to wash and cum off of himself.
Sorry guys!!! I wanted to let Emilie get settled in college but we are back and I hope you enjoy this chapter because damn I loved writing it!!!
"Yeah well, I should really be going." Dean was getting extremely uncomfortable and he was trying not to gag at Crowley's smell.
“You made the bed now lay in it, little alpha.” Dean chuckled and flattened out the paper on his side table.
“I told you to slow down.” Dean let out a snarl and threw open his door and stumbled into the downpour outside. He walked around the front of the car to inspect the damage done to the tire. He was out of the car for less than a minute and was already drenched. He kneeled down next to the tire, blown out. He had to get the jack out of his car and thankfully it doesn't look like any other damage was done. He must have hit a pothole at a bad angle.
"Can you come here, I have something we need to talk about." Castiel felt his throat tighten and eyes burn. This was it, his little fantasy was over and he was going to have to let Dean Winchester go. Trying to keep himself collected Castiel nodded and walked over to sit by Dean.
The parking lot was silent, Dean had walked though here but not towards his car, he was still headed to the dorm but it was a different route than normal. Another smell caused Cas to pause for a moment and his heart to catch in his throat the second it registered.
“Yeah, and it’s okay.” He gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze “I’m sorry I’ve made things weird between us.”
Doctor Reynolds came in after a few minutes with Dean's medical folder thick with papers since when he was a pup.
"It is, people who drink vanilla are vanilla in bed, it's proven." He shot back, stealing Cas' cherry.
"Whatever, so what are you writing in this contract of yours?" Castiel asked moving over to look at the paper.
"Fuck, Castiel stop gawking and get on with this!" Dean snapped and bucked up to catch his attention. Castiel fought to rid himself of his pants and fell right into the glorious smell of Dean. Nuzzling and nipping his inner thigh he let out possessive growls as he claimed every patch of skin. Dragging his wet tongue over soft sensitive spots. He felt Dean's muscles spaz and twitch under his teeth and lips. Dean may want a quick fuck but Castiel is drawing this out as much as he can. Throwing the omegas legs over his shoulders he pulled Dean's panties over and revealed a sight that had Cas drooling. He was warm and soft and covered in slick that made his hole shine. Castiel went straight to the source and snaked his tongue into every sweet spot he could find. Dean yelped and pushed back into Castiel's mouth that was licking and sucking at the sweet ring of muscle that called to him.
“What mate?” the other asked with such venom that Dean shivered “I don’t see any mate.” He leered at Dean, moving purposefully closer.
“Hold on, I’m going to fix this for you, get into something comfy.” He bent over picking up the clothes, folding the first few, and then gave up just dropping them in as they fall. Castiel pulled on  pair of boxer shorts and a thin white tshirt. He smiled at Dean a little.
Dean get out of bed and takes over the bathroom to skip Castiel's strip show. His thoughts lingered a second on the alpha at his back. He even considered turning around, staying a while in the doorway. He smacked the side of his head,  he needs to calm down. They have been in school for just a few months now and he can't let his stress get in the way of getting the hell out of here. He has three big test coming up so a trip to the library is a must. He is determined not to fall behind this year, and if that means studying all night then dammit he’ll do it.
Once Castiel was fully in he took no time to pick up the pace and create a quick and brutal rhythm. Dean felt like he was folded in half and the strength and power behind each thrust was smacking Dean's head into the door. Castiel gave him a glance as if asking for approval. Dean nodded, he wanted this, the closeness, contact, he wanted to help Cas through whatever was going on. So Castiel started and shivered from pleasure and pushing deep into the safety of Dean.
1) The sex in the car was completely consensual, just wanted to clear that up. I tried to make that clear in the chapter.
“Who’s your guest?” Her voice is exactly what Castiel pictured it to be, warm like the pie she makes and the hugs she gives. His mother never had a voice like that, he wanted to just take it all in.
Dean was right, that game was exciting, it made your stomach turn with anxiety and energy shoot through your veins as you try to be the faster one.
“No way, this is Sex ED class, not ‘what happens when you get knocked up class.’” Dean whispers were rapid fire, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh.
Dean was able to fix the tire quickly and efficiently Castiel gave a hand a few times. They finished just in time as the sky's began to flood the ground again. When they got back in the car Cas opened his phone to look something up.
“Jo?” Dean’s voice slightly broke as he saw the fire in her eyes and she shoves past him. Everyone but her was naked but that didn’t seem to bother her.
"Oh just spit it out man really, why do I always have to beat this stuff out of you!" Caution to the wind.
"A little game never hurt anyone," Castiel responded, already feeling too hot and confined by the shower.
Castiel truly did love the new brother’s he gained from mating with Dean, it was a whole new world for him now.
"Probably still tearing your family a new one." Dean didn't want to go on a whole angry swearing fest, not when he was holding Beckett. Dean slid the pup off his lap and stood back up, picking Becket back up into his arms.
Castiel look from Dean to Alistair and then his eyes darkened and a snarled ripped out of his chest.
“I called her over.” Castiel’s eyes darted to his mother and judging from the smells coming from Dean this was not a good conversation.
"That will be 5.36." A small blond beta chirped her hair twisted into a braid. A smile too wide to be genuine.
“Now look what you made me do? I don’t want to break your skin, but you will receive the punishment you deserve.”
"He freaking tackled Cas to the ground." Dean placed Castiel down onto the couch. "They were on the same team, too."
"My mate just went into heat a little...unexpectedly." The beta nodded and lightened up a bit. That obviously explained Castiel's odd behavior.
"Yo, Cas we should get this shit in writing." Dean swerved around to look at the alpha. Castiel's glare turned to confusion and he placed his book on his bedside table.
“Cas, I’m not pregnant.” He said with a  soft laugh as he stroked a hand through Castiel’s bedridden hair. It took a few minutes of Castiel just resting on Dean’s stomach to fully wake up. Not that it was possible for either of them to know so soon if he was pregnant but he was on birth control and wasn’t in heat so it was technically impossible.
"Yeah last week. I feel like I have to sneeze every time I kiss you." Castiel laughed at Dean's remark and pulled himself out of bed.
"Oh, thank god yes." They both let out a breath of relief. That thought never crossed either of their minds that night, it was scary how truly out of it they both were.
Waking up tangled in Dean was an amazing thing, the sweet smell of lavender, leather, and honeysuckle tickled his nose. He slid his hand over Dean’s chest, the bruising was still very prominent but they were turning from black and blue to purple and yellow. It was still hard for Castiel to look at, the thought of Alistairs hands around Dean's throat made him sick. Dean was still lightly snoring next to Cas, a small patch of drool wet his pillow. It was one of Castiel’s favorite times of day, when Dean was at his most innocent. At this time Castiel could see every part of the omega, he had no walls to hide behind. He could map out each freckle on his face and memorize the shape of his lips and the cut of his jaw. The rhythmic rise and fall of his chest and small noises he made were the soundtrack of his mornings. Castiel would never admit to Dean how much he loved to watch him sleep, it would be his perfect secret. Something he did every morning to imprint it into his mind so that when the year was over and Dean left him he could still conjure the image of Dean in his perfect state of peace. He had a few minutes until his alarm would go off. Winding his arm around Dean he grabbed his phone and fumbled dropping it onto the carpet.
“You can’t just leave me like this!” Dean smacked Castiel’s ass in protest, but again he got nothing.
“So, what can I help with you today, where does it hurt?” Castiel held back a laugh as he played doctor.
"Yes, well you should be good for thirty minutes. But I may take you before that." Castiel purred and leaned in to kiss his mate. He had missed him so much, those days of so little contact had really affected him. It wasn't normal for wolves to do that, mates relied on such a thing.
His father looked like someone had shot his dog, or totaled his car. Dean felt like he was about to be sick and before he could do anything he kneeled over and threw up. His father immediately got up and left even after Mary's protest. She was at Dean's side in a second and rubbed his back.
"Speaking of family, am I telling Alfie the truth?" Dean thought to himself for a moment twirling the pen between his fingers.
He didn't want to be having this conversation and Cas' had a sick feeling in his stomach that could only be soothed by Dean's calming scent. Maybe it was a coincidence or Dean had sensed Castiel's distress but his mate showed up within minutes of the silence.
Approaching the library Castiel knew Dean wasn’t here, he could feel it in his soul. Seeing a note posted he quickly read it.
“Ah, nice.” He took one last sniff of the air and leaned back, obviously buying his story. He looked back at the clock, few more minutes and he was out of here. He clearly remembered taking his suppressants today and he hadn’t missed any days lately. It was probably just stress that was eating away at him. Just to be cautious he looked around him to see if Benny wasn’t the only one to sniff him out. So far he was being ignored and he faded nicely into the background. Others probably just assumed he was with someone and didn’t shower off the scent. Once Kali dismissed them he shot for the door and ignored all the dirty looks he received. He bolted for his dorm and prayed that Cas wasn’t home.
"No, Dean it's okay this doesn't mean you're pregnant. You're still new to having a heat; you might not have a cycle yet." Castiel tried comforting, but he was panicking too. Their mixed smell of distress curled together in the air.
"No, I like my room and I don't think Dean would like to move." They walked up another flight and Castiel pointed to the door. "This is my floor." This time Rachel held the door open for Cas and they made their way down the hall to his room where a whiteboard hung and Dean seemed to change what it said.
“Just asking, I don’t want to get off on the wrong foot with your pack.” Castiel was playing with one of the buttons on his shirt- god that man needed a new style.
“Nice tr-” but before the man finished his statement and directed his eyes back on Castiel the alpha was upon him. Tackling the blond-haired man to the ground Castiel pinned his knee into the man’s stomach to keep him from moving. Letting out a feral growl and landed a hard right hook onto the man’s face. A satisfying crunch came from his nose and he let out a yowl. The smell of metallic joined the scents in the air and it only fed into Castiel’s ravenous anger. Landing another hit on the alphas jaw Castiel could have sworn he heard a tooth crack and the man wailed and swung up with a returning blow but it only grazed Castiels cheek. The man under his was disoriented and started trying to tear at Castiel’s eyes. Pressing his knee deeper into the alphas stomach Castiel grabbed onto the man's frantic arms and pinned them above his head. He took the opening and lunged down to bite the man’s neck with his razor-sharp canines and pull. Hot liquid hit his face and the man slowly deflated under his grip. Castiel could feel himself completely giving in to his instincts. The only thing that prevented him from finishing off the man under him was the smell of pepper and sulfur that sat in the air.
be safe." Dean tried to stop himself from turning radish red and Castiel lifted his hand to scan over Dean's face.
"Yeah, I had a feeling it wouldn't go well. Did they pressure you on pups?" Gabriel offered Dean a hand and pulled him off the floor.
“I don’t think not wanting to run into a fire is emasculating, I mean who really does that? Crazy people.”
"Oh, well at least let me take you there." He purred and Dean felt his heart start to race, suddenly the panic that has been plaguing him returned and he started fumbling his words.
"Now that you have that I should probably go, so you can ummm use it." Dean's head snapped up and dropped the purple knot he was holding.
“Gonna ride me, baby.” Pulling straight back into his B grade acting he nodded and moved so Castiel could pull out his fingers. Castiel missed the wet warmth and Dean missed the fullness but they would soon get it back.
Castiel didn’t know how long he had been hiding in the public bathroom downstairs, drawing the shower curtain to hide himself his breathing never settled. Over and over he could just imagine the words that would come out of Dean’s mouth “You’re taking this too far. I don’t want you Cas, it’s over you need to leave.”   Castiel bit his lip to keep a cry back, his chin was shaking and his throat burned to keep whimpers from escaping. Digging his nails into the tile as he sank to his knees, he heard people enter and exit, this bathroom was rarely used to shower and it was the first place he thought of. His eyes slowly closed and time was lapsing, he could hear people walking in and out, small conversations but nothing Castiel couldn’t block it out. His body starts to ache from the way he was sitting on the floor, he nodded off for some time and when he wakes up he groggily wonders where he is, until that dawning moment of remembrance. He feels lost, his home is gone, Dean was his home here. He can’t go back...Can he? He could just picture the contact torn up, the way Dean called him before he ran probably about to tell him not to come back.
"Don't tell my you don't want to talk about it Castiel! You are my mate now spit it out!" Something triggered in the alpha and he grabbed Dean's shoulders shoving him into the side of the car.
Dean nodded and crawled back into his bed, burying himself under his red comforter. Castiel watched as Dean closed his eyes, his Dean, his omega, his mate. It was one of the most amazing thoughts Castiel had ever had and he couldn’t wipe off the huge smile on his face.
Dean was absolutely pissed. It was finals week and there was a sign scribbled in chicken scratch that read. "Sorry for the inconvenience but the library will be closing early due to renovations." He could have screamed, woken up half the dorms around him. He needed one damn book and that's it! Who in fucks name renovates a library during finals week! running a hand through his hair, he tugged on it and let out a deep breath. Dean had one option and that was to pirate the book, not his first choice but when else could he do?
He only got an annoyed groan in response so Dean left his mate to sleep, but not after placing a soft kiss on his temple.
"I won't promise I'll behave." Dean swung his legs around and hopped off the bed and walked towards the door.
The run back to the dorm felt much longer, but once he saw the tall white building he picked up his pace. He could only imagine what Dean was doing left to his own devices like this.
"I love you, too." Dean sighed as Castiel left. He remembers the first time Cas said that to him. During his breakdown on the side of the road, he was so broken. It wasn't a sad or happy memory, just intense. Their feelings were multiplied by twenty in the car back then and Dean had never felt so close to Cas before. So raw and emotional.
Dean was knotted in possibly the most uncomfortable position but he didn't care. Castiel softly scented him, Dean felt how relieved he was. No longer was the alpha wound up like a cork, whatever had bothered him for the past two days seeped out of his system and resulted in an extremely affectionate Cas.
But before she could gather herself she felt a tug on her dress. Looking down she saw Dean look up at her with his large green eyes he smiled.
"Yes, you couldn't be their patriarch forever, you wouldn't do this to Adam and Sam! So just let Dean grow up, he's an adult and he found a great mate. Isn't that all we could ask for." Mary sighed, she finally got everything she needed out. John was still processing her words and he nodded his head.
"Oh god, fuck, okay, Dean stop!" Dean froze and looked at Cas dead in the eyes. "If we're going to do this I need to hear it out loud and clear of your consent. I- I really don't want you to regret this once your heat is over." Dean smiled and nodded. Leaning over his whispered into Castiel's ear.
“Ow FUCK Dean!” Castiel shouted grabbing his dick. Dean scrambled across the floor to grab Cas’ phone. He gaped down at it.
“Nah, you’re pretty good in bed.” Dean chuckled and looked back down at his shoes. It was quiet for a few seconds as Cas mustered up the courage to speak.
“Come lay with me.” The omega whispered as he clung to consciousness. Castiel smiled and nodded as he maneuvered himself over Dean and put himself between him and the wall to avoid his bad shoulder. He moved Dean’s hand and nuzzled into the omegas soft neck and and gently scented him to rid the smell of Alistair. Pulling the covers over he snuggled tight against Dean’s side.
"Mary, what's wrong?" John rubbed his eyes and say up, he was wearing his clothes from yesterday after coming back a little after the boys left.
“It’s mandatory, Dean. It’s not even that bad I mean, come on, it’s diagrams of your cervix. It could be worse.” Dean switched his focus back to the beta in the front of the room. She had short curly brown hair that bounced with every step. She was a little too excited over her job and loved to hear herself talk. She had a long ass powerpoint describing every inch of Dean’s reproductive organs and a few on an alphas knot. Dean just wanted to ditch, he had test to makeup due to his heat and one hell of a headache. “Just watch the presentation.”
“Cas?” Dean sat up trying to push down his emotions once again, but seeing Castiel in front of him he had no control over what he said. “Cas- god you’re back…”
Explaining their life up until now didn't take long but with Jo cutting in every few breaths, it caused it to take up much of the afternoon.
"Okay, we’ll go get a test or something.” Omegas can be tested very early on because of their hormones. But Dean didn’t know if it was too early, he almost didn’t want to know at all.
Glass should do the trick in both departments. Besides the bottle, he was left with nothing else to work with. He was left with two options, run up their guns blazing and take down as many people as he could or stay put and try and surprise them. Both had unfavorable outcomes as he counted at least three people above him by the voices.
“It’s fine just relax.” Dean turned back to his work but could still feel Castiel’s eyes on him. It wasn’t the possessive stare he had before, out of the corner of his eye Dean saw Castiel’s face fall. His eyes softened and he turned back to his book.
"Mmmm, baby fuck me so good." Driving faster Castiel frantically pushed himself deeper craving the feeling of Dean's hot body wrapped around him.
"Shit." Castiel whispered. One arms was caught under Dean's smooth back and Cas was now practically on top of Dean trying to grab his phone. Ignoring the half of an erection that was rubbing into Dean's thigh. With one last try Castiel reached down for the phone. Mistakenly pushing too far and pulled himself and Dean onto the floor. Dean woke with a startled yelp as he landed on top of Castiel. His leg still pressed into his morning erection that was normally dealt with in the shower.
After he conditioned his hair and rinsed and dried off and put on his special scent blocking deodorant. Throwing it all back under the sink he rushed out to dress and leave.
"Is your roommate getting like possessive over you or something? He might be going into rut if he acts like he's marking you. Watch your ass Dean. Literally." Dean let out a huff of laughter, he wasn't worried about that.
Putting himself in his mate’s mind he figured Dean would have turned back to the dorm. His trail branched off towards the parking lot and he followed it, wondering if maybe Dean had taken a drive.
“Okay, now tell me.” Castiel pressed for Dean to talk. “Start with what set you off in class.” With a deep sigh he started.
It was fast and heated, they practically ripped each others clothes off. Castiel gave Dean little preparation, stretching him out with two fingers before Dean demanded he fuck him. Once Castiel slid in they both felt a strike of lightning shoot through their bodies that struck their core, igniting it. With every thrust the energy grew, building up in their stomachs ready to explode and swallow the two. They couldn't talk, only moan, whine, and cry as Cas pounded into Dean.
"So now that you're done lying to me, and good thing because, hell Dean, no asshole in this school knows you like me and they don't deserve you." Dean's smile faltered a little as he thought about Cas' words.
"What is that smell?" Castiel went back in and cautiously sniffed over his mate. "It smells, god what does that smell like?" Cas asked slightly frustrated as he tried to pinpoint the scent.
-->Hey, so I normally don't butt in on the notes/chapter posting but I want to point out that sassypants is at the beach and I am not and that really sucks, man.
"How are you?" Dean asked excited to hear her voice, he really was getting homesick. Even with Castiel here he was still missing his pack back home in Lawrence. "I'm, I'm really great mom, how about you?" Dean didn't want to spill the beans over Castiel just yet. In all seriousness, he wasn't sure when or how he would do it. They had been technically mated since school started and it was unlike him to stay away for so long. He was just worried on how his father would take to him being someone's bitch. Dean's scent went slightly sour at the thought and that was quickly noticed by Castiel who nuzzled his neck and tickled him slightly with his stubble. Dean tried not to laugh but a small sound escaped his mouth.
"What, Sammy no I didn't find a mate. I was just wondering." Dean looked down at his watch he had about ten minutes until class.
Dean placed on hand on the shower wall and the other knotted into Castiel’s hair who purred with satisfaction. Dean was already heating up and he knew this was not going to last as long as he had expected it to. And once that thought left his mind he had one hand gripping the tile and the other matted in Castiel’s hair. Castiel slid his fingers behind Dean's balls and lightly pressed at his entrance. "Yes, now!" Castiel gave a satisfied chuckle with Dean's dick still completely shoved into his mouth. In a swift movement, Castiel was knuckle deep in his omega who purred like a cat.
"Well Castiel will need someone to give orders with, and many packs keep an omega on the side to breed with." Dean's jaw hung open and he almost laughed at what was happening.
The animation was pretty amazing, the most eye catching was the ice that covered most the world. He wasn't really following the story, all he knew was a girl who was hiding her whole life only to come out and run away.
“Now how about you step off before we have a problem.” Castiel gave them one terrifying smile. There was a tense moment, none of them moved. The men looked between Castiel and Dean before walking off with a huff. Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
"C-Cas what ‘r ya doin’." His voice was muffled by sleep and the pillow under him. "Are we still tied together." Dean didn't even make an effort at moving. Wiggling his ass a little he could feel the knot still buried into him filling him up and he felt Castiel’s weight move farther up his ass, readjusting himself..” Jesus if our cycles ever match up I'll be pregnant before the night if over." Cas chuckled and ran his hand down the now of Dean's spine.
"I know something is going on that neither of them are telling me, I've always known. Even since Dean was young they always seemed to be trying to keep things under the radar." She gripped the wheel tighter. "I am his mother and John has no right to keep anything pertaining to my boy from me!" Her head shot up and the tip of her nose and corners of her eyes were bright red.
"C-Cas what are you talking about, what did she do to you?" Dean searched Castiel's face for answers as a sick twist formed in his gut.
"Mm, fuck Cas!" Dean pushed back, persuading Cas to give him more. Cas obliged and took one hand back to slide two fingers into Deans wet heat. Sliding his tongue in next to them he pushed into Dean trying to pull out every ounce if slick his body had. He could taste himself mixed with slick spilling onto Castiel’s tongue. He was so receptive and egger.
"It's about our mishap, Ha! The Mating Mishap.’" Dean said excitedly as he scribbled it across the paper as the heading.
“I-I don’t know. I should know, I always know what to get her but my mind is just not working.” Castiel sighed, an odd feeling of failure seeped into his stomach and turned the cheap breakfast in his stomach.
"I'm going out." John turned around and went out the back door, the smell of alpha was thick in the air.
Castiel let out a small purr and wound his loose fist around Dean's dripping cock and started pumping softly. In response, Dean snarled to have him speed up his hand. Castiel happily obliged his mate and turned his soft downward pulls into tight upward tugs. He watched his mate's cock twitch and spill over his fist when he pulled away from Dean's heat. Dean came with a loud and drawn out “Oohhh, Cas!"
“Well so nice of you to join us.” He smiled and patted Castiel’s arm. He smelt like christmas morning and baked cookies.
“Winchester, you talk through my class I sure hope you aren’t staying after to ask a questions.” Dean was snapped out of his thought and his cheeks heated. He really hoped Professor Casey hadn’t noticed him. Wide eyed Dean stuttered for a few seconds.
Castiel could laugh, or dance, or hell, even sing. He wanted to hurry and finish packing so he could warm up to Dean and get a few more hours of sleep. Sleeping in a bed with Dean was always amazing but there was a new element added to this, he always had a pull towards Dean but since the mating was completed his body was running off a crazy high and all he wanted was Dean.
“Oh if you’re so sure of yourself why don’t we go prove how wrong you really are Winchester.” Castiel gave a crooked smile and challenging eyes. It was an offer Dean couldn’t say no to.
Castiel fumbled trying to press all of him into the omega scratching for purchase. Dean's hands fumbled as he searched for the door handle. Castiel was still relentlessly tangling himself into Dean. He could sense it within Castiel, it was pure fear he couldn't pinpoint if it rooted from his past or the thought of losing Dean but it was very real and it scared Dean.
"I've been thinking for the past few days, since your conversation with your brother." Dean paused trying to pull together enough courage to continue. Castiel notices how tight his throat was as he talked, like each word hurt.  "We've made a lot of changes to this thing, ya know. Took a few weeks for us to make the changes but once we did I feel like we were crossing them off left and right. Except one. The family affairs." Castiel opened his mouth to talk but Dean stopped him. "No, Cas let me finish. The only rule we haven't taken off this damn piece of paper has been the no family rule. We have sex, we go out for coffee and burgers, we share a bed, a shower, and we just-” He sighs” I don't want this contract anymore, Cas." There it was, the blow Castiel had been fearing. He felt like he was going to vomit or cry. His body started shaking violently and he felt physical pain in his gut. ‘you failed your mate, trash, no good, just a stupid bottom bitch.’  His throat was constricting and his eyes prickled, he was right. Dean Winchester would destroy him. Why didn't he just keep it to the contract? Why did they have to change? Maybe he would still have Dean. The smell in the room curdled and it looked like the words Dean was about to say what he meant by all this, but it just wouldn’t leave his tongue. Dean was looking at the contract and didn’t notice Castiel stumbling backwards towards the door, not until his hand was on the knob and he was gone.
“Chin up, Dean. He loves you, and we love you,” he gestured to himself Beckett and Gabe “You have a family with us. That is, if you want it.” Dean couldn’t help the sneaking suspicion that Balthazar knew more about Dean’s home life than he let on. Then again, how different is Dean from any other omega? Dean would like to think he’s unique in his treatment from his father, but he’s really not.
"Well, yeah I guess I was kinda worried how dad would take it." Dean knew it was true. He never knew how to approach his father on any topic involving his presentation.
Dean exited the bathroom and saw Castiel pull his dark wash jeans over his runners thighs and the swell of his ass. He admired the bow of his back and the muscles that tensed and relaxed as he pulled on his dark gray button up. Dean walked over to his closet and pulled out a back and grey speckled sweatshirt and worn ripped jeans he would wear in the scrap yard.
"Thanks." He said hardly paying attention to her as he stuck his straw in the glass taking a large sip. She walked off pouting slightly. Cas smiled satisfied with her annoyance, he toyed with the wrapper on his straw.
“Oh shit, that’s really soon you know. Any idea how you’re gonna tell alpha J?” She asked referring to his father.
Yesterday's encounter was anything but pleasant. Castiel wasn't expecting such a blatant show of aggression and rejection from John. It wasn't enough to scare him away, nothing was stopping him from being with Dean, even if he was so disliked by his mate's pack leader.
The library was a routine walk for Dean, it was a quiet place for him to work and he could also get out a little. Dean would be a liar if he denied being a creature of habit and he was pleased to see his normal table in the science fiction section was empty. Tossing his Letterman bag onto the desk he threw his jacket on the back of his chair.
“Cas, holy fuck, Cas.” Dean whimpers, writhing around on the bed, fisting the sheets so passionately that they become entirely untucked. “Cas!” His entire body was shaking. He could feel the vibrations of the fake knot all the way up to his sensitive nipples, which were taut, due to arousal. A single tear fell from Dean’s eyes, he felt like his insides were alive, burning with fire. Castiel nearly growled tugging a few times a Dean’s cock. Garbled gibberish followed as Dean desperately tried to warn Cas he was going to cum. He exploded, screaming loud enough to severely concern the students two floors below them. Dean swears he dies cumming right there. He pants and pants until he can finally open his eyes, it feel like days go by. Cas gently - because even though he’s in rut, Cas is the kindest, gentlest alpha Dean’s ever met - he gently pulls the vibrator out, making Dean shiver and roll on to his side. Dean can still hear the fake knot shake violently in Cas’ slick-drenched hand, and just hearing it makes him feel the ghost of the knot buried deep inside him. Cas clicks the vibrator off tossing it to the other side of the room and returning his attention to his omega.
Castiel had one hand on the soul of Dean's back as he lightly pushed him through the dorm. Castiel was just about cocooning Dean in his possessive stance as they walked. Dean had seen very few people in Rut before so he assumed this was how it went, well other than is brother but that was completely different he was family and not his mate. He saw many people in passing but didn’t acknowledge any of them to prevent Castiel from gripping him tighter. Dean was getting ticked off. He couldn’t help Castiel’s mother’s words from creeping into his mind once again “He would be a  bitch.” He sure felt like a bitch being escorted out the door to buy a fucking cup of coffee. He sped up his pace forcing there to be a little space between them. Cas got the hint, but stayed a mere three feet behind him as they walked, never allowing Dean out of his sight. If this is how Cas was going to act during Rut Dean’s going to have to lock him in the bathroom for a few days to avoid the horrifying embarrassment.
His mother said no matter what he was Dean was perfect, she said all presentations are equal so he should never feel disappointed.
His shoulder blades and lower spine were rubbed red. Small beads of blood pooled under and around the raw, broken skin. It was most definitely going to leave a mark.
"Would you believe me if I said I was trying to not wake you up?" Castiel was looking up at Dean's sleep dazed eyes.
"We're going to the same place, how about I walk you? Your alpha normally walks you, right?" His tone was offputting.
"It went that badly?" Alfie asked biting into his ham and cheese sandwich. Internally he was obviously happy work kept him from going. His brothers tended to treat him like trash.
Dean rubbed his irritated eyes and picked up his phone to look at the time. Almost eleven, time for class. He closed his books and stretched, rolling his neck and shoulders. He felt off, his muscles ached and lower stomach started to hurt. He played it off as nerves for his upcoming test and threw his books in his bag. Slinging the bag over his shoulder, he weaved through the bookshelves towards the glass doors. It was just starting to cool down but not enough to stop wearing his short sleeves. His wardrobe consisted mostly of old band tshirt and worn jeans. The wind picked up and cooled him down, he didn't realize he was so warm. He took the library steps two at a time and headed off toward the center of campus.
“Caught you.” Dean let out a small laugh and turned his neck out to Castiel slightly so the alpha had more to worship and kiss, a mix of purrs and possessive growls vibrated in Castiel’s chest and Dean was laughing slightly.
"We are in such a weird ass situation but it's only right to return the favor. Show you a few of my tricks." Dean waggled his eyebrows and he lowered to his knees.
Castiel didn't talk much about Meg in the weeks after but Dean didn't push, he knew enough. He was stuck, no way he could come out to his parents and tell them what happened. He was an alpha and in their eyes, he should always be in power. From what Castiel has told him it was more of him forced into sex with Meg and him being punished for not knotting her. It was victim-blaming at its finest, and it killed Dean to know his mate and thousands like him suffered from it.
"Yeah what about you? You expect me to believe you gave that mighty show for free? That you didn't drag me in here to knot me up you fucking Novak?" Dean spat, he had no idea how he was still standing and the smell of Cas nearly brought him to his knees.
"Hello, darling" he smiled and it was like his voice deepened in the past few hours because now he sounded almost intimidating
Dean was no longer being pounded with relentless force but with slow teasing strokes and he moaned into Castiel's mouth.
Castiel buried his head in his pillow groaning loudly. He has his eyes closed for about five minutes when he heard Dean call for him.
"I will go out and get you a test. Stay here and well...I don't know, don't leave. It shouldn't take long, the campus store is like ten minutes away." Dean didn't lift his head-he just grumbled in response.
"Now that we got that cleared up I could totally go for a coffee." Dean rubbed his hands together and hopped up.
Dean didn't see Gabriel anywhere but his blood was boiling. How could these people be real? Evolution has taken them from slobbering wolves in the woods to functioning people and yet they still have the mindset of a feral beast!
Castiel slid one hand up Dean’s neck and tangled in his hair pushing him forward. Dean’s back was bowed, and Castiel traced the tips of his fingers down the path of his spine to his tailbone. Smelling Dean’s arousal in the air Cas pushed his finger’s down Dean’s crack and into his quickly wettening heat. He gained a deep moan from his mate whose tongue was snaking into his mouth. Sliding his middle finger inside Dean he started slow, wanted to draw out every second he could.
"Yes, Dean." Castiel had moved his hands down to Dean's lower back and rested his chin on Dean's shoulder.
“It’s just-” Dean paused, he couldn’t tell him. “I’m so damn stressed over school and I guess I’ve been having trouble sleeping.” God, Dean hated lying to Cas, he was the one person he shouldn’t lie to. Dean was just so good at it, unless it came to his mother, God, if she was questioning him he wouldn’t have lasted five minutes before she drilled it out of him. She looks like a sweet old apple pie mother but she has a strong head on her shoulders and a stubborn attitude. Something she passed on to all three of her kids.
Castiel really drew it out, even adding a fourth finger to the mix knowing it still wasn’t his size. Even as an alpha he was larger than most Dean was huge for an omega who usually has petite cocks.
He found the car pretty easily, It honestly should have been the first place he looked. Dean was shaking, the car wasn’t on and it was far too cold out. Cas opened the door. Dean’s head popped up, his headphones were in, and he didn’t say a word. His eyes were red and puffy, pouring over his pink MP3, playing the same song over and over again on loop “When the Tigers Broke Free” by Pink Floyd. Cas slipped into the car pulling Dean into his lap, who offered little protest. He was too damn cold, and so done being angry at Cas. He pulled the headphones out, tossing the MP3 aside. Cas rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
Slightly impressed with his accuracy when it came to peeing on sticks, Dean placed each used test on the edge of the counter. Now to wait. He couldn’t help but look at himself in the mirror- how big he would get, how much harder school would be. They would need a home right out of college. Kiss his dreams of being a mechanic goodbye because he won't be able to fit under a car when he's the size of one.
"Good, because there is a line Cas. And walking into the alpha Novak pack is crossing it. I mean I know we've been playing jumprope with the line lately. With the out of heat sex and showers and sleeping together. It's just your family sounds terrible."
"Yeah, fucking an omega in heat is such hard work!" Dean called after him "Don't go far I'll need you in another thirty minutes!"
"Watch your mouth, omega." Naomi's snapped." This is Meg, you should get to know each other because we are going to have Castiel accept her as the beta of your pack." Dean's eyes widened and he clenched his teeth.
"Rise and shine Cas we have an exciting day ahead of us!" Dean called from the bathroom to his rugged mate who was two days past his 'for the love of god please shave' day.
“So I hear you passed Jo’s test, that means you’re in!” The larger man clapped him on the back and pulled him further into the room to meet up with Dean who was being showered in kisses by a blonde woman. She had a few gray wisps in her hair but she had Dean's eyes and smelt like his mate. This must be Mary.
"Cas," Dean whispered and stood up, he was taller than Cas but the way he slumped his shoulders he looked so small. "I'm sorry, I- fuck." Dean leaned into Castiel and closed his eyes from pure exhaustion. He hadn't even brought up the scent blocking soap.
Fuck, he hasn't even told his parents he had a mate! Wow, Dean needed to get his priorities straight. He had a plan to just show up with Cas, he was never good at delivering news over the phone.
Castiel let out a deep snarl and tried to restrain himself from pinning Dean down and fucking him into the mattress. Slick helped Dean ride Castiel, he growled down at the alpha as he set his own pace. Castiel’s back arched with every thrust until both of them were nearly snarling at each other between kisses. It only lasted a few minutes as they each slammed their bodies together. Until the last choked back growl and they both collapsed, knotted together in the most intimate way possible. It was exhausting as they tangled their legs together and fell back to sleep.
“Oh, yeah, I mean he just started crying out of nowhere I don’t-” Balth looked at him, a defined crease on his brow. Dean realized they weren’t talking about the same thing. “-You meant Gabe was in a state.” Balthazar nodded slowly.
“Great, can’t wait to beat you because I have a great pair in mind.” Dean gave a sly smile and for some reason that turned Castiel on, he liked the powerful side of Dean.
"Uh, yeah I shut my phone off to get some alone time." Dean coughed and leaned against someone's silver accord to stay on his feat.
"Hey, Alfie haven’t seen you in weeks.." Dean threw his bag over the side of his chair and sat down going straight for Castiel's fries. The second he leaned over Castiel moved in slightly to smell him but quickly leaned back and let out a chain of sneezes. Alfie looked quizzically between the two. Dean was really hoping the smell would dissipate over the course of the walk but sadly that wasn‘t the answer. Even in Castiel’s presents he felt eyes on him so he wanted to avoid all conversations of the man.
“I see,” Balthazar said thoughtfully. “Well, from what I know from Gabe, they ended rather badly. Really messy, lots of fighting. It’s probably just bad memories, not to mention the fact that his parents are trying to force her on him because they - and I’m sorry to say this - don’t approve of you.” Dean nodded at the thought, “He just needs some time to get over it. Gabe was so upset when he first took me home, they were far worse on him. Far, far worse.” Dean could imagine how awful it must have been. A beta marrying an omega from a crazy knothead alpha pack. He suddenly felt a swell of respect for Balthazar.
“Cas?” Dean asked rubbing his eyes and sitting up against the headboard, he still had his nightshirt and boxers on since he was too tired for sex last night. His work was piling up now that he was more reluctant to leave the dorm. Dean wasn’t an easy person to shake, he had faced off alphas in bar brawls but the feeling he got every time he left the dorm alone had him panicking. It had him thinking of the private self-defense lessons his father put him through, Scenarios of being attacked kept flashing in front of his eyes, and the proper reaction he was taught became a mantra that played on repeat. Even when it was daylight out and he was walking to class there was a terrible vibe creeping just out of his view and it chilled him down to his bones.
"That's all? Dean you lie when you are trying to hide something, not when going to talk with someone." Dean felt a ping of guilt in his gut 'I went to talk about you. '
"We have been friends for a very long time, John and Bobby even longer, so it has been like this long before the kids were around." Mary’s smile only grew, “really we all knew each other from growing up but it was John and Bobby who officially brought us together.”
The game ended an hour and a half later and the day was like any other. Sam and Adam took it upon themselves to take John out to who knows where and Jo was harassing Ash and her father. Ellen and Mary made commentary on the whole thing.
“How did Alistair find you?” Castiel moved onto Dean’s hand, it wasn’t broken but would hurt like hell.
Dean had never felt so vulnerable in his life. He was laid out and open for the taking and Castiel took. He took every inch and cry. Castiel was building himself back together as he was Dean. Both of them shattered just minutes ago and they felt the pieces sliding into place.
“Uh, n-no I’m sorry I’ll just-” Before he even finished Dean backed out towards the exit and bolted. Holding his sweatshirt and books close to his chest as he started for the door. Pushing out te cool air was refreshing on his clamy skin, he was really over thinking what Pamela said. It wasn’t even worth sharing, that’s how unimportant it was. He would just keep it to himself.
The first shot rang out and surprisingly Castiel didn't budge, then four more after it followed. Lowering his weapon he pulled the ear covers off and turned around. A huge smile was plastered on his face and all three clapped for him.
"Well, I'll go under one condition. We take my car and I'm driving." Castiel only rolled his eyes and agreed. He grabbed a few jeans and his button ups. "Hey, Cas what's up with the fancy shirts? I mean don't you have t-shirts?" Castiel chuckled.
"I  wanna go home." His voice was so broken. Mary brought him to the car and sat in the back with him. The ride home was silent. He didn't see his father for two days after that. Dean barely left his room. He will never forget how his father looked at him, he failed him. He always failed him.
“Castiel, who is this stunning man you have?” Anna asked extending her hand offering her scent to Dean. Dean looked between the two for a second before he stepped forward and gave her a hug. She smelt so sweet, fresh rain in spring with honeysuckle and daisies. Nothing like the strong smell of alpha leaking from the doorway, but she was in fact an alpha. She had a soothing smell, like Cas. That made Dean relax a little, and he pressed in a little harder to take in another breath of her scent. Dean relied on scent to tell the personality or the overall emotion of a person, it was much harder to scent out beta’s unless they were part of your pack. It was an extremely important skill, especially when meeting a new pack.
“Hey, they suck alright but let’s just relax until it’s time to go and see Beckett.” Dean walked over and gently rubbed Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel relaxed slightly under his grip and leaned back into him. This trip was hard on Dean but it was even worse on Cas, Dean had grown up learning you needed thick skin to be an omega. This was just the last straw to let Castiel know he didn’t fit in this pack.
"Whatever you say...Alfie." They both gave a lighthearted laugh and Dean headed off to his next class.
Waking up wasn't as bad as Castiel thought it would be, his back still hurt, but overall he felt okay. Looking to his left in hopes of finding Dean's sleeping figure but was faced with an empty pillow and cool sheets. Frowning Castiel rolled out of bed and scanned the room for his pants. Giving in he walked over to Dean's armoire and was pleased to find he had a nice selection to pick from. Settling with gray form-fitting sweatpants and a too big navy T-shirt Castiel went off to find Dean.
"Yeah, yeah." Dean dug through his wallet and change pile pulling out the exact change and placing it in the woman's small hand.
“Alright I know I’m new but you guys have shit ideas, I vote coffee,” Castiel spoke up again after Adam had three other ideas shot down from Sam and Dean. Dean laughed, “I vote coffee.” He said raising a hand.” Yeah, I could use a pick me up.” Sam agreed. They didn’t even wait for Adam’s response.
Castiel was on edge and he couldn't keep his legs still. He was so happy to hear class dismissed because he needed to move. He wanted Dean, he wanted to touch him, kiss him, knot him. He felt like picking a fight with any alpha within ten feet of him but focused on getting home. Once he made it to his dorm he shot up the stairs and let out subtle growls to any wolves near his door. He took his key out with a shaky hand and pushed open the door stopping dead in his tracks.
“Yeah, oh.” Dean hesitantly reached out a hand and stroked his arm. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-” Fuck, Dean’s heart was dancing all around in his chest and making him feel ill, what if he triggered Cas? Is Cas going to be touch-shy from now on? He never was before. Oh god, what if he was, and Dean pushed him. He didn’t know, it wasn’t his fault. Or was it? Shouldn’t he have known? Shouldn’t he have asked? Was this nonconsensual? Can you have nonconsensual casual touching? Well, duh, of course, you can. Oh god. Oh god.
It was bitter sweet packing up that morning. Dean only knew had to get Cas out of here, something was very wrong and he had to fix him. Since their mating was completed they have a much better feel for each other, almost like an emotional electromagnetic field between them, that connection only grows with time. Soon it will be felt over long distances and increase to a mind reading type feeling associated with the smallest change of mood. Right now Dean just felt sick from the uncomfortable fear rolling off Castiel.
“So if I take you to court for breaking it I can formally introduce it,” Dean smiled to himself "You are just pissed I named it first." Castiel rolled his eyes and walked back to his bed. He watched as Dean scribbled down words in his scratchy handwriting. Castiel had nothing to contribute to the list, he had no problem with anything. He wanted to get up and see what Dean refused to do with him but he thought against it and found something to entertain himself with. For a few minutes the only sound in the room was the scratch of Dean’s pen and the flipping of pages.
"He got a headshot." Everyone stood in awe for a second and then went back and congratulated Castiel even louder that time. The alpha couldn't hide his blush.
"Um, I-I don't know I'm not here to take advantage on you and I don't expect you to act like my omega." Castiel really didn't know what to do, the other night the plan seemed so logical but once daylight came and sleep helped get their minds straightened and after Dean's crazed second night of heat. It just seemed like such a hard task.
. Bolting down the stairs he shoved passed two men walking up the stairwell. Ignoring the swears that followed and making his way towards the exit. Once outside he took a deep inhale feeling his lungs expanding to capacity. He could almost taste Dean’s smell and he worked on searched for the strongest trail. Castiel followed the scent to the library, it was Dean’s original destination and his strongest trait. The feelings he was experiencing were overwhelming and he had so many voices in his mind shouting all at once.
"You get just as clingy during your heat so I don't even want to hear it, and what makes you think the sex part of my rut is over?" Castiel growled in Dean's ear.
As a last-ditch effort Dean pulled his pants down around his mid-thigh and pulled himself free from his boxers. He started off slow, rubbing his callused thumb over the his head, dipping back to drag across the sensitive crown. Dean bit down on his lip as he worked himself faster, panting and mumbling for Castiel.
"Ngahh!" Dean yelped his eyes shooting open and hands gripping the sheets for the life of him. The feeling from his dream followed back into reality as he saw a black mop of hair between his thighs and an expertly trained tongue fucking into him.
"Hold your tongue, Anna. This is for the good of his pack! Castiel obviously won't be moving back and with Meg, he will be able to expand his pack at a much faster rate." Dean clenched his fists, that bitch was talking about Cas and who the hell was Meg.
“And really what could you call me, little alpha? totally unoriginal and that just sounds odd” Castiel chuckled but the second he saw the smile on Dean’s face he regretted opening his mouth.
"I'm not sure it really did." Cas said looking back at the building. Turning they decided to walk back to the dorm, Dean decided he would call Jo.
“Sorry,” Was the first thing that came out of Cas’ mouth. “This is the first rut I’ve gone through with someone.” Dean silently thanked the absent gods Castiel didn’t have to be around Meg for them.
Dean was woken up by Castiel’s alarm, he felt remarkably better than yesterday except for his aching cock. He was still thankful it was his day off. Dean shoved all his classes into a three day span so he could have the rest of the week to himself. He watched the alpha walk around the room to gather clothes and change with one eye open. He was definitely going back to sleep, maybe go back to the library. But he definitely had something to tend to before he went back to bed. He just had to wait for Cas to leave. Suddenly he felt wet, warm slick dampen his underwear. He remained completely frozen and kept one eye cracked open to watch Castiel’s reaction.
Wow this is one late update! I'm sorry for the sporadic updates and all, my life is a ball of confusion! I forget t take my meds and eat sometimes, so I really hope to get back on track.
“So, ya like um?” Dean asked once the made it upstairs and out of earshot of the very chatty group of people.
He never told his mother or brothers. As far as they knew it was father-son bonding to live a healthy lifestyle.
By the way Dean was breathing Castiel knew he was asleep and probably would be for a while. Castiel took that time to rub down every part of Dean he could touch, kissing him and scenting him. Bitting soft marks into his back as a claim. The sound and smell of alphas walking around the hallways set Castiel on edge. Dean was his, he was knotted in him and no alpha out there should look at him. Even though there was a locked door between them Castiel still felt the urge to frantically mark Dean, rubbing his wrist across his back as a warning. It was all he did until another wave of cum dumped out and caused Castiel to shiver. Multiple orgasms were a gift and a curse during rut.
Squeezing out some gel Castiel gingerly rubbed it into the hot patches of rug burn. Dean winced a few times but took to deep breathing instead. Once he was finished putting on the ointment Castiel searched through his kit once more. Pulling out three medium sized gauze patched and some medical tape.
“Woah, hey, hey!” Dean jumped up and walked over to him “I was kidding, chill.” Dean chuckled running his fingers over Cas’ stubble. Cas blushed a little.
Dean was pacing around the room, nerves gnawing at his stomach. His phone was clutched in his hand, Sam's phone number was light up on his screen. He knew it was time to tell his family. Really every step of what they had done was unethical. The fact they had been mated for this long and haven't told his family, well, in short, it was pretty messed up.
“I think so, it is still rather early in the year.” Castiel knew what a horrible idea this was, the longer the wait the stronger the bond.
“Everything alright with you, Dean?” Balthazar asked standing next to him sipping neon blue “fruit punch” from his cup which featured Eugene Fitzherbert, or Flynn Rider, Dean liked the latter better, the name suited him more. Not that he was actually paying attention when they watched the film earlier on in the party, nope, nope, that would have been weird. Dean shrugged.
He checked his watch, thirty more seconds. He didn’t dare look at the half dozen tests on the counter. Instead, he sat down on the toilet and started to hum “Hey Jude”. He could hear Castiel pacing and even smell his distress from outside but Dean couldn’t seem to find his voice to call him in. He waited, and waited, looking at the timer on his phone click down the seconds until finally, it was time.
“Your middle name is Alexander?” Dean paused and tried to hold back a laugh. “like in CAN?” They both started laughing again and in all truth nothing that either of them said was truly funny.
"Alright  maybe later right now Dean is meeting everyone so come here, angel." Gabriel stepped forward and plucked his daughter from Dean's hands.
“Why would you do that? We haven’t spoken in years.” Dean almost smiled at how clueless his mate could be.
"Yes, Dean." Dean had wanted to wrap himself around Castiel but opted to sit cross legged behind him and give him a back rub, Dean thought it would be better for Cas to feel like he had an escape rather than to be tangled up in Dean.
"Well you did a terrible job at it." Dean chuckled and ran his thumb over Castiel's cheek. Dean's touch sent a chill over Castiel's body and that only made his dick twitch.
Sorry for the late update I am at the beach and it took us over a day to find the wifi sign in and all that!
"Cas! God you're going to kill him!" Dean pulled Castiel back and Alistair scrambled to his feet but Cas got one good kick to the man’s gut before he ran into the shadows.
“Well, friendly reminder to stick a knot up your ass you fuckwad.” Just as he finished a slender blond woman with curled blonde hair appeared behind the alpha.
“Dean, you joining me?” Castiel called from the bathroom Dean could hear the shower running and made quick work of his clothes. It had been several weeks since Alistairs attack and Dean was healing up nicely. A scar was left on his shoulder but other than that he was great. Mentally Dean was better, after their episode in the impala he and Castiel slowly started exchanging small facts between them. How they like their coffee, their favorite TV show- of course Castiel was Doctor Who- and if Batman could beat Superman, they came to a mutual agreement that he totally could.
Making it back to the dorm they barely had time to put down their coffee before Dean’s phone was ringing. Castiel nearly jumped at Dean's side, moving slightly closer.
"Hey Cas?" Dean called from the floor. Castiel poked his head out of the bathroom. Mouth full of toothpaste that dripped onto his chin. He hummed at Dean.
"Shut up Sam, and forget this ever happened." Dean quickly ended the call and stopped in his tracks. You just know, instinct that's what it is. For the first time Dean had to completely become in sync with his body. To just listen. Deep down Dean did know the answer, he has just been ignoring it.
"You don't have to explain it if you don't want to. But you are my perfect omega. I don't know why you would want to cover your scent. You are an omega with an alpha spirit and you keep me on my toes in the most amazing way. So don't hide that smell from me, please." Dean didn't speak, he didn't know what to say. Yeah Crowley was the reason behind it but all he did was nod, that's all Castiel needed. "I love you, Dean Winchester."
Pissed and impressed, Dean started pushing himself to figure out how to do this on his own. Soon, he had gotten the hang of it. Cas whipped by him, halting with professional talent.
"Meg was there." Castiel's eyes never left the stone under his feet, he could feel the blood drain from his face and saw Alfie stiffen slightly. Talking about it was still hard, especially to his family even if they didn’t know the whole story.
"Come on." He said walking over to the diner. It had that distinctly diner-feel. Booths with salt and pepper shakers, tiny jukeboxes on each table, pretty waiters and waitresses with white lace-trimmed aprons and order-booklets. The sound of metal utensils on glass plates, and soft intimate conversations of table mates. It seemed so loud but there must have only been four or five occupied tables. There was an eclectic mix of smells. Dean sniffed the air pancakes, grilled cheese, coffee and ketchup came to his nose all at once.
"Um, everyone older than Anna is an ass. They will probably have their mates there with them. Except Michael he is getting married and they won't mark each other until after the ceremony. More out of the wives family's wishes. Uriel, Raphael, Alfie, and Hester don't have mates. Lucifer has Lilith, Anna has Tessa , Gabriel has Balthazar and then of course my parents. Naomi and Azazul. So I guess avoid the unmated ones as much as you can. Except obviously Alfie." Dean unlocked the door and Castiel threw their bag into the back and slid in the passenger side. The cold leather chilled his skin but the car smelt exactly like Dean, it was a place he could easily melt into. Even if it was ungodly cold in there.
“Tell me what’s wrong and I will.” Dean knew he should just slow the stupid car down but he was desperate to know what happened.
In no way am I trying to portray Dean as a scared little omega. Remember back to the episode when Sam and Dean checked into a mental health hospital in season 5 and Dean was getting really paranoid....yeah he is more like that.
Explaining the past few months to Jo was a challenge with her constant commentary but they managed, thankfully she and Cas really hit it off and their alpha drives didn’t clash, they both had Dean as a priority in their minds.
Castiel was on the edge in seconds of Dean’s torment, his legs were shaking and his nails dug into the worn leather of the impala. Glancing down he caught brilliant green eyes looking at him through thick lashes. At that Castiel let out a broken cry and dumped down Dean’s throat and knotted his mouth.
“Bless you for coming out in public.” Dean flashed him the middle finger, to which Alfie laughed. “Usual?” He asked glancing at the pair of them. Cas nodded. They watched Alfie make their coffee, and add an extra pump of caramel to Dean’s while his supervisor wasn’t looking he put a finger to his lips winking at Dean making him grin and wink back.
"What? What do you mean, why can't I call just to talk. Maybe I wanted to know how Adam and mom were. Jo and Ash? How's the gang?" Dean was totally procrastinating and it was so obvious. He was a great liar, but this was so nerve-wracking he was surprised his voice wasn’t cracking. What if they didn’t accept him because he was part of the Novaks. What would his dad say they achieved what he dreamed of, an all-alpha pack.
"Don’t get me wrong, that was the best wake up ever." Dean chuckled and took a deep breath once the confusion was resolved and he paused. "What is that smell?" Dean asked and sniffed again and it hit him.
It was never the same scenario, tied to a chair, chained to a wall, stuck in a box. It lead to nightmares, ones that woke him up screaming in a cold sweat.
"Oh, little alpha who said I was done with you?" Dean rolled over to straddle Castiel's hips, they were both stark naked and Dean was still stretched out and slicked from last night's events.
"I'm gonna ride you nice and good, ." Dean purred and slid down fully sheathing himself down on Castiel's cock. Castiel's instincts kicked in and he grabbed hold of Dean's hips and fucked up into him with a growl. Dean bit his lip and placed his hands on Castiel's knees that bent at Dean's side. It gave him great leverage to pull himself up off of Cas and slam back down. Dean's panties were still pulled to the side and getting wet from the slick on Castiel's cock.
“I’ll keep you safe, little alpha.” Dean gave him a wink and Castiel only rolled his eyes trying to focus on the cosmetic side of Dean and not about meeting his family. But they were driving deeper into the heart of town and avoiding that thought was getting considerably harder.
"Great, just upped my hours so I'm that much closer!" Alfie smiled and jumped a little, he had been saving up to move out since he presented as a rather omega like alpha. Castiel sees nothing wrong with his brother but his family is another story.
With a huff, he continued his struggle in the empty warehouse room. No one would find him. He relied on John to actually remember him and not get too drunk. This silent time gave Dean some time to think. And he wondered when he started calling his father John.
The walk to the omega side of campus was much more difficult that it should be. Castiel still had a hard-on from his marking session with Dean and his scent still clung to his shirt. He got weird looks from passing omegas and security. He was an alpha walking through at a rather late hour and he smelt like rut and musk. The omega mart was just a few blocks away and he hoped his parents wouldn't look at his bank statement because he was about to buy some very non-alpha products.
“What kind of green there’s like three hundred different kinds. Is it barf green; army?” Castiel reached out and pulled Dean towards him guiding his lips to Dean’s.
“Well at least he got an omega, how are the heats Castiel? Awesome perk right?” Dean’s grip tightened on Castiel’s wrist and he glared at the tall blonde man Anna ha nudged a few minutes ago.
Trading off of hugs and kisses it finally led to the two men getting in the car. Dean let out a deep breath and was ready to leave he revved the engine to life and he already felt better but the leather touched on his skin it was nice it was his car, it was home, and with Castiel by his side he backed out of the driveway and they headed back to school.
“Castiel is the angel of Thursday. Everyone in my family has biblical names.” Dean gave him a funny look, but kept going.
Dean was bare foot stomping around campus in cotton thin night clothes. Clenching and unclenching his fits he was taking deep breaths. The campus was dead, even the alphas roughhousing in his dorm settled down. The ground was so damn cold on his feet and he had no idea what to do, he had no other place to go other than his dorm. He wasn’t sure why he snapped at Cas, he wasn’t mad at Cas...was he?
"I can't believe you dorks still have that damn thing." Jo laughed to herself as she waved her hand at the beat-up notebook that was wrinkled and covered in postet notes.
“I’m sorry to bother you, but I missed the notes from the other day, do you mind me borrowing them? Finals and all” Dean looked over the man. He always got an odd feeling that Crowley was completely lying about nearly everything that came out of his mouth. The man looks like his hair was receding for god's sake. Or the poor bastard had terrible genes.
“I wouldn’t allow it, my shaft is free. I mean my shift is-” Castiel chuckled. “over.” Dean had to press his lips together to keep it in but his green eyes light up with joy.
Tangling his hands in Castiel’s dark hair he ravished his neck and sucked dark bruises across his shoulder. As Castiel picked up speed he felt pressure build in his stomach, he couldn’t remember the last time they took it this slow.
Castiel sped up the pace, pulling out just to his head and then slamming back in. Each time eliciting a hiccup of pleasure from Deans lips.
Still in his boxers, Dean pulled him over and nuzzled his neck and ran soft hands up Cas' sides and over his ribs.
The old mint green bathroom is empty and he shoots for the stall. Clutching the bowl he feels like his whole stomach is going to come up. All he manages is a few dry heaves and he falls back against the stall doors. Hands shaking as his skin is devoured in flames from the inside out. He is panting and unlocks the door lifting himself up and fumbling towards the sink to splash cold water on his face. He white knuckles the rim of the sink and looks at his reflection. His cheeks are flushed and pupils blown out. He felt like he was dying and there was nothing he could do about it. Not until he leans his hips into the cool porcelain sink and a moan escapes his lips. His cock is throbbing and for the second time today he can feel the slick wetting his underwear. His mind is running a thousand miles but he can't manage a single thought. His breathing is picking up as panic sets in, he's caught out in public with this horrible sickness or whatever is making him like this. Almost like heat, but that can be possible he's on suppressants and has never experienced it himself. He's just sick that's all. The bathroom door opens and the two men who were talking freeze and sniff the air. A guttural growl slips from there chest and it sends Dean into fight or flight. And he chooses flight.
"Well, he seems so different. Does he ever just randomly ignore you and get sucked into his own world?" Dean thought about it.
"No, we just got," he paused and looked at the clock "home.." Wrinkling his brow he locked his gaze with Dean who still had dark circles under his eyes that looked dull. "Wow, I don't know how that happened."
“Really, A mate? Wow, Castiel and I thought we sent you to school to learn.” The older woman sat at the island combing her fork through a half eaten bowl of fruit, she had dark brown hair that was pulled up and a stern expression.
“Jo, I’m sorry I just didn’t want everyone to know without me there to moderate it all.” Jo slumped her shoulders and tilted her head a little.
Looking around the sink it dawned on Cas that he had forgotten his toothbrush even though he swore he brought his.
"Hello, Dean." Castiel voice sounded broken and he stood by the door for a few beats and then started moving for his bed.
“Settle down there, girl.” The dirty blond alpha said with a smile, It took Dean a few seconds to process what just happened.
Castiel is running at full speed out of the omega side of campus and the thought of other alphas beating on his door drives him to go faster. A vibration in his pocket draws him out of thought. He looks at the ID; Dean.
"Yeah sure he's just looking out for me. Totally because all my life the son of a bitch has had my fucking back!" Dean snarled throwing the covers off of him and taking a few steps until he spun back around.
A small trail of red mixed with bubbles toothpaste trailed down the side of his mouth. With a low growl, Dean grabbed the cup next to the sink and filled it. Handing it to Cas he urged him to rinse and spit.
Dean took a deep shaky breath and thought for a second, research it find an easy way out. Fake mates? That was just outright taboo, like an omega mating an omega, you get shunned and spit on for defying the most sacred connection to our ancestors.
The motel was rather nice. The building outside was sparklingly white and well-kept. A sweet little beta sat sleepily at the counter. She helped them quickly to a room and went back to nodding off.
"I'll take that as a yes." Laughing Rachel added some bounce to her step. She was such an unlikely friend to Castiel but they had met in English 101 and Rachel had show a lot of interest in Castiel. He politely turned her down and then Castiel accidentally introduced her to Ashley and they fell for each other. Rachel always says she is in Cas' debt for finding her mate.
"I couldn’t tell anyone.”  He said helplessly “I wouldn’t have gotten any sympathy from my parents anyway, they'd have kicked me out for letting her do it.”
“Mom, did you bring Meg here to be my beta?” Castiel asked in a low voice, finally understanding the situation, Dean almost detected a note of unease in his voice, even shaking fear. His scent was off and it curdled in Dean’s nose.
Dean gladly accepted the offer and nuzzled into the bed as if it was a nest and wrapped himself in his mate's warm body. Dean can only remember ever having one panic attack in his life but he knew if he didn't do some serious breathing and try and sleep he would be headed towards a second.
“Bobby and Ellen, Jo and Ash are my friends and we aren’t related. She was like my childhood friend and it just kinda happened, a few times.” Dean chuckled, they hadn’t slept together since freshman year and Dean can’t imagine it ever happening again. She was his best friend but that was all they would ever be.
“I will devour you.” Another chill ran down Dean’s spine and before he knew it he flung Castiel around and had him pinned to the wall. Catching Cas’ lips Dean dove into a full-on make-out session in less than a minute. Castiel was more than happy to respond and took a fistful of hair and tugged genitally.
“Lalalala!” Gabriel covered his daughters ears and shouted to Cas. everyone exchanged laughter and Beckett looked up at her father like he hung the moon, her eyes would light up when he would smile. She was everything you could want in a pup. Dean crouched down in front of Beckett
"At the moment you are." Mary was normally very soft-spoken but she had been preparing for this day for a long time and would not let her husband get in the way of Dean's happiness.
"Fucker was in rut." Castiel knew Dean’s words intended to have a sting but he was exhausted. Castiel paused and without a word he started to pull down Dean's pants. He could feel his teeth sharpen. If that fucker even dared to touch Dean. The smell of alpha musk was strong on Dean. Especially coming from his jeans.
“Am I going to have to come down and kick you ass? You are a damn good omega, Dean and don’t you dare go self hating because your dad has some shitty traditional values.” It always bothered Jo when Dean went and started taking about himself like his dad did.
"You stumbled onto me omega. I see you as a gift. Now let me unwrap." He was drunk on his own rut and Dean debated calling Cas. What would that do, he wouldn’t be able to hit three numbers before Alistair was on him. He just had to puff himself up. No fear.
"Well, we have Tuesdays off, how about an R&R day?” Cas leaned in closer, adding a kiss to each suggestion “Nice long shower,” kiss, “massage,” kiss “lazy sex." kiss, Dean hummed in agreement.
"No, don't ‘Dean-’ me , tell me what is wrong. I can't stand to see you like this. What did I do to you?" Dean's voice faltered by the end. His hair shagged down droplets of water sliding down his face.
"So um, any pointers for your family? Like how to not get ganged up on by one of the most well know packs of this century?" Dean lead the way into the parking lot Castiel found him in after Alistair attacked. His baby was parked in the middle of the lot and she was slightly neglected over this past week.
“Mmm, you smell so good.” Dean smiled and maneuvered himself so Castiel was under him. He inched up his shirt and started kissing Cas’ chest, worshiping  every inch of his alpha. Castiel leaned back into his pillow and closed his eyes, focusing on the feel of Dean’s mouth on his body. The soft press of his tongue across his nipple and the chilling feeling of teeth biting at his skin. With every kiss and lick on Castiel’s sweet spots Dean pulled a moan from the alpha. Dean moved lower nuzzling into the sensitive crease between his groin and thigh.  Breathing in the smell of soap and arousal. It was a strong smell, like a bold cup of coffee hitting your nose for the first time. Dean enjoyed having it close, breathing in deeply as he sucked bruises into Castiel inner thigh.
The awful pin-prick feeling of total heartbreak washed over him. Dean started to cry. This was why Dean didn’t grow attached to people outside of his pack, they left. He was just an omega and now that his use to Castiel was over he was just the dirt the alpha walked over. God, he thought Castiel was different, caring, loving, a proper alpha with morals. But he was just like the rest. Dean’s face twisted as he thought of all he and Cas did to either, the sex, the date, all of it and it was just for his entertainment. Dean felt oddly violated, Cas was the one who protected him even if he didn’t really need it, he was his rock through this and now he’s crumbled. Dean felt like sideshow entertainment and it only pushed more tears into his eyes as they threatened to spill over his red rims.
"Okay breathe, baby you're okay I have you and she is far away. Look at me." Dean took hold of Castiel's chin and turned his face up towards him. "I love you, Castiel and she is gone. So utterly gone from your life, because I will snap her damn neck if she comes around." Once Dean finished Castiel's head dropped slightly and his eyes averted to Dean's shirt. It was a blank stare, one that many people wore when having flashbacks. "Cas, do you want to talk about it?" Dean placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, reaffirming his scent.
Castiel took a deep breath. Dean was not his mate. Dean was not his mate. Dean was an omega who could make his own choices and if he didn't want to ever see Castiel again he couldn't do a thing about it. Cas knew deep down the mated part of him yearned for Dean and he knew parts of Dean yearned for Cas. It was confusing and messy but it wasn't real. It was a deal, they had a contract and everything. Taking another breath Castiel looked back towards the front and tried to catch back up with the lecture.
Pushing the toy in all the way Castiel readjusted the and and pulled out of Dean slowly. He moved his hand to match the pace. Moving his mouth down to Dean's balls. Licking and kissing, memorizing every inch of Dean. Pushing back in he heard a wonderful hiccup of cries and yelps of pleasure escape Dean’s lips, his thigh muscles tightened as Castiel worked him faster.
“Are you ready?” Castiel asked quietly, his hand hovering over the gold knocker. Dean could only nod and pray this was the right choice. Never in a million years would he think he would be walking into the Novak house as a guest. Castiel gave three good knocks and pulled his hand back. Dean could hear voices from the inside and he clenched his teeth as the door opened.
Walking up to his room he smelt something new, sappy and sweet. But nothing compared to the honey lilac that accompanied it.
“Great, we have a deal then.” Crowley reached out his hand for a handshake and froze catching a scent from the draft of the open window. “On second thought, how much would I get if I supplied you with his mate?” Alton raised an eyebrow and a nasty smile crept onto his lips.
The alpha completely froze and sniffed the air, he quickly turned and looked at Dean with a puzzled expression. Then looked at the window that was open above the omega. Shaking his head he grabbed his bag and left.
"It's a long story, we aren't mated, well were half, he didn't mark me. So as far as you know we're mated. Even with mom and dad. To everyone out there we are mates." Samandriel is still wide eyes and at a loss for words. “but don’t go talking about it, it’s a need to know really. We’re going to fix it...eventually.”
"Let me fucking finish." Every ounce of the Dean who was cuddling with him just minutes ago was gone.
"I better see your ass over break, mom is pissed she hasn't seen you and so is Bobby." Dean gave a chuckle and pulled Jo close to place a kiss on her forehead.
He warily got up and walked over to the counter, his throat was tight and his stomach turned like he had downed six espressos.
"And his presentation?" John asked. Smiling he looked down at the paper even though he clearly already knew the answer beforehand. Dean waited for the magic words.
So now it was one of their days off and Dean was in the mood for sex, and who was Castiel to deny him such a thing.
“Cas, you just told a group of people I bit your ass, that is like twelve times worse than that right sided bite and the infinity tattoo!” Dean’s eyes were wide as he looked Castiel dead in the eyes.
Acting like mates but trying to go unnoticed as them. Only people who should know are the college advisors in charge of the records. Other than that it should be kept to a need to know basis.
“Gotcha.” Cas whispered before he tried to pull himself up. It was a friendly game, no harsh tackling mainly tagging or grabbing them. Grabbing Castiel hand he was hoisted up and handed the alpha the ball.
"I think it's," Castiel looked over to his alarm at the blurred red numbers, "Two-forty" Dean groaned and Cas froze. His knot went down so he lifted off Dean and looked around.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, I mean this is blasphemy when it comes to mating! The one real thing we have connecting us centuries back and we are just going to walk all over it?” Dean paused looking over Castiel’s face as he debated in his mind. It was only a half mating, and he would have to move and alphas would generally leave him alone. Dean scrunched his nose and sighed “Oh fuck it, yes. Lets just be fake mates until school is over. But then we are done you go your way and I go mine." Castiel smiled and Dean cracked half a smirk. “Don’t smile at me I am still pissed at you, like really you couldn’t control yourself?” Castiel’s smile falter, he felt semi queasy like he had taken advantage of Dean, a chill ran down his spine and for a second his blood felt like ice.
“My ass, he bit my ass.” It was spur of the moment and the second Castel said it he regretted it. Dean gave him the biggest “what the fuck?” face he has ever seen and the group around them went silent.
John was gruff and by the way, he looked at Castiel he clearly knew the news. He hadn't shaved in a few days and wore an old faded flannel and ripped jeans. He looked intimidating but Castiel wasn't planning on confronting him.
"I'm fine, just got a headache is all." Dean turned his head to look at Castiel. Stubble was growing back and his black hair looked especially wind blown. Dean gave him a half smile. “Go on, little alpha.” The use of Castiel pet name gave him a rush of relief, Dean wasn’t mad at him.
“Well this is Castiel Novak and he is my mate.” It is as if everyone had heard him because the room fell silent save the three who already knew the announcement.
Dean followed suit and took his stance as Castiel tried to get in his alpha mind set. It was relatively easy to do since the image of Dean bruised and bleeding was tattooed into his mind. He had to remain fully aware so he didn’t actually hurt Dean in the process. He could feel his teeth sharpen by the graze of his tongue and his nails prick at his palms, his eyesight heightened as each freckle on Dean’s skin became more visible. The green in his eye highlighted with widening pupils and wrinkled brow, he was ready to fight.
Dean woke with a start. He sat up blearily turning on the light next to him. Cas was naked, still wet from his shower crouched on the ground picking up the clothes he dropped. The suitcase was spilled everywhere.
"Yes, that was just lucky really perfect way to break an Omega and sever the connection you will be at your masters feet in just a few days" Deans mask faltered slightly and he let out a growl. "But you are marked, shows you've been used before. Not fresh and innocent. But he doesn't mind since you are so hard to come by."
"Dean, you don't sound well. What happened? Where are you?" Panic was rising in Castiel's voice and he could hear him get up from his bed and leave their room with a slam of a door.
Dean didn't respond, he wouldn't dare promise that to Castiel because he would always do as he saw fit. If he felt he didn't need to drag someone into a situation then he would do anything to keep them away. This just happened to not be one of those times.
"Yeah, they can be intimidating. Anna likes you so that's good and so do Gabriel and Beckett." Dean smiled at Beckett's name. She was a sweet pup, he knew why Castiel loved her so much.
“Hello, officer.” Cas greeted. Dean moved it up a notch now making it his goal to embarrass Castiel as much as he could. Letting out needy moans he started biting at the back of Castiel’s neck and grinding his groin across Castiel’s ass that was in a perfect position since Cas was on his hands and knees talking to the officer.
“You know a big house full of alphas, sweet omega like you shouldn’t be trotting around without his alpha.” The man Dean placed as Lucifer grinned.
The muffled words of Crowley were lost on Castiel’s ears and as he slipped into darkness he could have sworn he smelt Dean. He basked in the smell of warm honey and lilac flowers blooming in the spring.
"Oh shit, Cas" Dean shook the man on him. His knot had gone down so he could push him to the other side of the twin bed. Castiel stirred and groaned. Dean already felt wet again and Castiel came to attention at the smell.
“Slow the damn car d-” A loud pop and a hard pull to the right startled them both, Dean quickly lifted his foot off the gas and planted it firmly on the ground trying to gain control of his car on the slick road. Dean let the car roll to a stop and tapped the brake slightly to pull off to the side. Once they steadied to a stop both men took in a deep breath, and looked straight ahead.
“Oh yeah, any other hotshot words you got floating in your head?” With a smile Castiel pushed Dean against the wall and placed an arm on either side of his head. Leaning in so his lips nearly pressed against his ear he whispered.
The car was silent for more than a half hour they confided in each other by scenting and nipping. Marking each other as their own.
"I mean, a degree is always handy I guess. At least he wanted that for you." And the second the words left his lips he regretted it. The smell changed from leather and earth to a thick sour smell that was a dead giveaway.
“My family?” Dean paused a second as if he was conjuring up the right words. “Well we are a really wonky pack, It is mainly me my mom, dad and my two brothers. But my mom, Mary, well she has a friend Ellen whose parents died when she was just a pup so my grandparents kinda looked after her for some time but then she was taken in by some other family. My dad and Bobby are childhood friends and well I guess they all met at the right time because Bobby and Ellen have two kids, Jo and Ash. And well then my family, we’re really close I guess. I mean we were all friends back them, and I may or may not of slept with Jo.”
