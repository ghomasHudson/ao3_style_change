“How so?” Jack pressed, feeling like he was sitting on the edge of his seat. He already was aware about everything Castiel said about him and Sam. Dean was the one he really wanted to hear him explain.
There was another long silence that followed. Every second that past made Jack’s anxiety double as he dreaded Dean’s response.
“And this one is important so you better tell the truth,” Alex added smiling back at her partner.
“No. We will.” Of course, leave it to Sammy to disagree with reality. Dean expected nothing less, after all, if the roles were reversed he would say the same thing. But, instead of indulging in his kid brother’s fantasies, he’d rather drop the subject for now.
“Okay,” Jack said quietly, his face looked like a mix between guilty and scared. “What’s your plan?”
“B-but, like Dean said, his mother was half human and she was an amazing person and Jack has shown no signs of being anything like Lucifer. He is good. I swear, we wouldn’t have taken him in unless we were absolutely certain.”
Claire took the moment to look around, since this was the first time she’d seen Jack’s bedroom. It had the same standard layout as every room in the Bunker down to the gray and brick walls. Similar to Claire’s own room, it lacked a personalized touch probably due to lack of possessions. As far as Claire could see, there was only a framed picture of a woman on the bedside table and brown stuffed bear next to it. The biggest difference between Jack and Claire’s rooms was that his looked more used. He had piles of dirty clothes on the floor, empty candy bar wrappers strewn across his desk, and his bed was left umade with the blankets crumpled at the foot.
Jack continued because he felt the need to clarify that he wasn’t looking for Claire’s pity or guilt. He was just trying to reach a level of understanding. “What I’m really trying to say is, I don’t think Dean paired us up because he thinks I need a babysitter. Or because we’re both young. I think he paired us up because he thinks we can learn from each other.
Jack smiled back at her, happy that he’d finally made a friend.
Jack went to check his phone, knowing that this argument could last for hours. He saw a text from Claire telling him to call her when it was done. Wanting nothing more than to be anywhere else he realized that calling Claire was the perfect excuse for him to leave.
The boys met Jody and Claire in front of the Harp’s residence. Jack looked out the window and noted the nice appearance of the white suburban house. It was well maintenanced and it looked better than any house in Lebanon or Jody’s neighborhood. Jack noticed that seemed to be a common thread in most cases the Winchester’s worked.
“There’s Patience, she’s a psychic; there’s Alex, she was raised by vampires; and there’s Claire, she -“ Dean interrupted his brother.
“Actually I wasn’t going to say anything,” Sam shrugged looking down at his lap.
“Look, I’m guessing you’re a hunter right? You have that vibe, with your flannel and ‘I’m not scared of anything’ act,” Dean chuckled, giving him a once over. “And that’s all it is. An act. Cause if you knew who we really were, then you would be too scared to even walk into this bar.”
“How did you get him to agree?” Jack asked, genuinely curious. In his experience, hunters usually weren’t so generous unless they got something out of it.
: Being nice is hard :(
“Yes really. It was a miniature version, but it was still you.”
“But why a truth spell? Wouldn’t it have been easier for her to kill us?” Cas spoke up, moving closer to where Dean was holding the phone.
“What the hell?” Dean muttered. He had no idea where he was or how he got there. He wasn’t restrained, which he took as the first good sign. He jumped up and walked out of the door feeling relieved to find it unlocked. That crossed ‘captured by a supernatural villian’ off his list, at least for now. He quickly walked down a flight of stairs leading to a living room still feeling confused. He heard the sounds of someone cooking in another room and moved to follow it when a picture on top of the fireplace caught his eye. He slowly walked towards it with an uneasy feeling building in his stomach.
“Oh.” Jack mentally slapped himself for not understanding the joke sooner.
When he felt well practiced he suddenly stopped and took a quick glance at Claire, double checking that she was still distracted by her phone. Once he was sure he turned his attention back to the rock, only this time he lifted his finger slightly upward. He compelled the rock to levitate about an inch off the ground. It took Jack a lot of focus to ensure the rock was high enough to not touch the ground, but low enough to not draw any attention. He held the rock in the air for a moment until he felt comfortable enough to move it. He started off with a similar pattern as before, making the rock fly back and forth, almost as if he was playing catch with himself. Once he felt confident with movement, he tried creating bolder patterns. With only moving his pointer finger, he created circles, figure eights, zig-zags, and star shapes. His shapes were all drawn out carefully in the grass by his floating pebble.
“Didn’t you say that Jack is only three years old? Obviously he doesn’t know what he’s doing. You’re the adult, which kind of makes you responsible,” Alex talked as if it were obvious.
She called him back only two days later, after sending him a picture of a man in his later thirties. “His name is Sean, he’s a hunter, and he’s bisexual,” Claire listed off. “He’s worked with Jody on a few cases in the past and I’ve already met him more than once. He seems nice enough, as far as hunters go. He was in theater in high school, so his acting skills should be decent. He’s heard of the Winchesters before, but he has never met them. Which is good because it means they won’t recognize him and he’s just scared of them enough to not want to get on their bad side.”
“I promise.” Jack said with determination in his eyes that it reminded Dean his Jack. Both looked wise above their years.
“Oh honey,” Mary said with watery eyes. “That’s wonderful.” She got up and gave him a hug.
“Well it’s been a long day, so if that’s all you wanted to talk to me about, I think I’m going to call it a night.”
“Don’t talk to him like that.” Sam snapped, taking Dean by surprised.
“At one time I could, but now I’m not sure,” Castiel told him with a wistful look in his eye.
When he got to the end Dean closed the book and tossed it aside. He shouldn’t be learning about a life that wasn’t his own. It was a stupid idea and it could get him killed. He needed to get out of here and fast. Before it tempted him any further and before dream-Cas comes back.
“Sorry. I-I just,” he quickly retracted his hand. “I was wondering why he looked so angry?”
“I’m not lying.”
“Alright, I guess I can do that. Lie down.” Jack scooted down to his pillow, then stuck his hands under the blanket as Dean tightly tucked in his sides.
“You made me look like a fool back there,” he growled, pressing Jack further into the wall. “Now I’m on Dean Winchester’s black list for the rest of my life.”
“Fine. Then I’ll walk back over there, tell the Winchesters that you hired me, then they can pay me the money themselves.” The idea that Sean would sell him out and ruin their plan made Jack’s stomach feel uneasy, but he refused to show his nerves.
“We’re not dumb Patience,” Claire pushed. “We know you had a vision when you touched that kid’s hand.”
Castiel thought about it for a moment, obviously thinking about what he was going to say. “I suppose the way I feel about Dean is akin to a best friend. He is my most trusted confidant and he certainly knows the real me better than anyone else in the universe. But labeling that relationship with a term as simple as ‘best friend’ doesn’t feel right. Dean and I share a profound bond. Our destinies linked together the moment I raised him from hell. His soul was so pure and bright, yet so damaged. It was beautiful.
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Jack winced. “I’ve been feeling kind of sad lately, but I’m better now. I talked to Claire about it and I think I feel okay.”
Then she thought back on all of the interactions she saw between Jack and the Winchesters. They didn’t treat him like the powerful son of an archangel, they treated him more like a normal kid. Jack could have easily killed the hellhound by himself, but instead they gave him a knife and told him to be careful. He could be used as a great asset on the field, but instead they gave him a notebook and told him to stay back with Claire. And Jack just sat back and accepted it with a smile on his face. Too afraid to lie to his family when he could probably erase their memory of finding out. When the sight of Jody’s car came into view she reached out and gently tapped his arm prompting him to turn around.
“I got Cas to admit that he loves Dean, but Dean doesn’t love him back. He turned him down and now they won’t talk to each other,” he summarized, not really in the mood to retell everything. “This is all my fault,” Jack’s voice cracked.
“I wanted to get a head start on traffic. It’s not my fault you didn’t say anything.”
“Did he have a rebellious stage?” Cas asked with a smirked.
“No. Um, I mean Cas has been gone for a couple of days - angel stuff, I guess - but Dean and Jack are here.”
“Anyways, my point is that shit stays with you. Besides, you already have enough crap to work through, you don’t need to pile our dumbass fight on top of it. I just didn’t want you thinking that it was because of something you did. Capiche?”
“Mom and Dad were divorced?” He asked shocked. John and Mary were supposed to be the perfect couple. A match made from heaven, literally. Without being hunters their lives should have been perfect. From the last djinn dream, he remembered that there was always a catch. One flaw in a seemingly perfect universe, because the truth of the matter was that nothing can be perfect.
She’s been through a lot and doesn’t let her guard down easily. Just try to “kill her with kindness” and she’ll give in eventually.
“Actually there is something else I wanted to talk to you girls about,” Jody said, eyeing Claire nervously.
“Then there’s Castiel, always looking over your shoulder with those sad puppy dog eyes, making you feel guilty anytime you even think about going on a hunt.” Jack stayed silent realizing that he didn’t have a response to that one. He hated the way that Claire smirked at his sign of defeat.
“Alright,” Castiel stood up. “That worked. I miss him.” Dean and Cas were then on their way to pick up Jack from his mom’s house. Dean had to admit he found himself missing the four year old. It was a weird feeling. He felt like he was already assimilating into this world. For moment he felt like this life was really his. It left him an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. How quickly he was beginning to forget his real family and his real home.
“Thanks, but I’m fine. I ate before I came here,” she told him.
Unfazed, Jack continued to grin excitedly. “Not just any candy. It’s nougat and chocolate, the best candy in the entire world!” The boy giddley took out a bar for himself.
“Nah. We’re just here to pick up Jack” Dean tried saying it nicely.
“But there’s one problem —“
“You tuck me in, tell me a story, and then give me a goodnight kiss on the head.”
Similar to his father, Jack stared into the distance, trying to remain attentive, looking around for the demonic dog. He gazed where the dark sky touched the top of the trees from the forest ahead. He admired how the sky had a hue of light blue indicating the direction where the sun had set hours ago. Jack’s eyes lazily drifted downwards to the green grass under his feet. There were no signs of movement in the dirt besides a rogue ant every now and then. His eyes followed the wayward ant until it crawled underneath a smooth gray rock. The rock caught his attention as he stared at its flat surface and rugged edges.
“Is the Castiel from your world not?” He asked rather bluntly, as if it was normal for people to call him a genius.
“And that’s it? That story doesn’t sound completely insane to you?”
“He asked me too,” he said with a hint of sadness. “He said it was an invasion of his privacy. I didn’t understand what he meant at the time, but now that I’ve experienced dreaming myself, I get it. I know that dreams are uncontrollable, unpredictable, they can expose the deepest parts of your inner psyche. They’re personal and not meant to be seen by others.”
The next morning, Jack found Dean in the Bunker’s garage working underneath the hood of the Impala. Jack slowly walked over to him. “Hello!” He said cheerfully, he needed to make sure the hunter was in a good mood.
Before Jack could come up with a plan, he felt Sean being pulled off of him. He relaxed a little when he saw it was Dean, with Sam and Castiel not too far behind him. Dean looked beyond pissed and didn’t hesitate to punch Sean square in the face. Sean weakly swung his fist in a lame attempt at retaliation that the Winchester swiftly dodged. Dean then threw another punch that hit its mark across Sean’s left cheek knocking him to the floor.
“Technically, Sam and Jody discovered it,” Cas corrected.
“Dean, I mean put the knife all the way down, as in back inside the drawer.” He said giving him the same doe-eyed look that his Cas loved to used against him. He put both hands up in surrender and placed the knife back in the drawer.
Jack nodded before asking his next question, “And, who are ‘the girls’?”
“But, you don’t love Dean the same way you love me. Right?”
“You do realize that you need a silver knife dipped in lamb’s blood to kill a djinn and not a kitchen knife we bought at Ikea?”
“And even though we have no control, were kinda hoping that it will be a boy.” Sam added.
“Is that how you would prefer me to be? A little kid?”
“Don’t do this Cas,” Dean pleaded. “It’s the spell that’s making you say it, this isn’t you.There’s no way you…”
“You want to lie?” he asked with wide eyes. “I can’t… I-I don’t like to lie.”
Cas looked annoyed, “He’s not my fr-”
“What?” Dean asked feeling confused. The way Cas asked about the djinn didn’t sound like he thought Dean was crazy. It sounded like he knew what djinn was.
“Oh no, I find it very annoying,” Claire snorted with laughter from the honesty in his voice. “But Mary Winchester told me that it’s a parent thing and that I just have to get used to it. She said that one day they will lighten up, but it will always exist in some capacity. Just like how Dean gets overprotective of Sam even though Sam is one of the best hunters in the world.”
“It didn’t work,” Jack croaked out. He couldn’t tell if his voice sounded that way from emotion or lack of use.
“I was going to sit here quietly,” Castiel shrugged. He further explained after noticing Jack’s puzzled look, “Sitting quietly is actually a common activity among angels. They call it seeking revelation, it’s a meditation of sorts. Some angels do it to listen to angel radio, others will sit for hours hoping that God would speak to them. Of course I do neither of those things. I do it because it gives me time to think.”
“Buddy, getting a kid is a lot of work, not to mention the process you have to go through.” Dean told him gently.
With a sleeping Jack as an excuse, Dean and Cas’ managed to leave the house without being interrogated. Although, Sam did look a little disappointed.
Dean shrugged. “I swore there was no one there. Look, it’s going to take a lot more than getting hit by a car, to keep your old man down.”
“Does your head feeling any better?” Jack pulled back, but continued to sit on Dean’s lap.
“I knew it! He totally does!” Alex fell on her side laughing.
“Anyway, something in you snapped and you stood up to him. I think you released years of pent up anger on him. After that incident, you stopped talking to him. It only lasted until six months later, when your Dad had a heart attack and was put in the hospital. The doctors knew that he didn’t have much time left. You visited him in the hospital everyday until he died. Jack and I joined you a few times. That’s when your father finally turned around. He apologized for the incident with Jack, everything he put me through, your childhood, all of it. Thankfully, I think the John Winchester in the hospital will be there one Jack remembers when he’s older.”
Unless this one knew who he was and wanted to finish him off straight away.
“Really?” Dean sounded surprised.
“I told you that lying always ends badly, but you wouldn’t listen,” the nephilim whispered, his vision blurring.
“What were you arguing about?” Jack asked innocently, despite having heard their whole conversation.
Is that what this is? He doesn’t like it.
, he thinks to himself, as he swings open the door to his room. He makes his way into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee, but it looks like somebody’s already gotten around to it. It’s still hot enough that when he grabs a mug and pours himself a cup, his hands burn a little, even through the ceramic. He lets the sting deep into his skin, and he thinks,
Time creeps by until Cas hears Rowena muttering some sort of incantation. There’s a flash of purple light, and Dean slumps over where he’d been seated. Sam and Cas both rush over to him, and Cas’ heart is in his throat.
Maybe things in the real world won’t be so awful after all.
Cas’ eyes widen, “Witches? Like, plural?”
he had to have been the one to teach that to Cas. He picks up a piece of his bacon and reaches across the table to dip it in the syrup, and he shoots Cas a wink when he’s sure they aren’t being looked at.
Dean grabs a bottle of something without really looking at it, but it’s clear. He takes a drink that’s probably a little too big for his first shot of the night, and he coughs a little when he swallows. Fucking vodka. And cheap vodka, too, Jesus. He hands the bottle to Cas, who takes it like a champ, only dribbles a little of it which he wipes away with the sleeve of his hoodie.
This time, as he sits in the large tub, he only becomes more anxious with every passing second.
“Yes,
Cas laughs at him, not maliciously, just happy. He finally kicks his own pants and boxers away, sitting up in Dean’s lap. He straddles his thighs and trails his fingers down Dean’s chest, tweaking a nipple along the way. Dean gasps at the contact, but just keeps staring. “Angels don’t have souls,” he says. “We just have our grace.”
In the five minutes it takes Dean to wash two plates, Cas is drifting off. He's lulled to sleep by the soft noise of whatever's happening on the TV, and he only stirs when Dean sits back down on the bed. He blinks his heavy eyelids at Dean in a silent question.
Still, Dean’s never quite forgotten about it. He wonders if Sam has. He wonders what Sam remembers about their childhood.
Dean wakes up the next morning extremely abruptly, his breathing heavy. He had been dreaming. He couldn't tell where reality stopped and his dream began. Had Cas really come back? Or had he just hallucinated all of that in an attempt to feel better? Well, only one way to find out.

Dean shakes his head. It’s now or never. These things have always felt easier in Purgatory. Hell, everything’s easier here. He’s
Dean makes eye contact and gives the most minuscule of nods, and Jack’s face breaks into a smile. Dean’s eyes widen. Why is that a good thing? “That’s great!” Jack says. He’s beaming. He puts the pile of shards next to him and dusts off his hands. “Why do you look like that? Dean, it’s
Of course, just like every time Dean has touched him for the last week and a half, Cas jerks away from him.
It’s funny, really. It’s cute. Cas has seen him much more naked than he is at the present moment. He thinks back to the halloween party, how the shorts had barely covered his ass at all. The boxers he’s wearing now show less skin than that white velvet number had, and Cas is somehow more flustered seeing him like this. “It’s fine, Cas. Just get ready for bed,” he says, pulling on a pair of sweatpants to sleep in. “I’ll turn my back,” he says. He crawls into Cas’ bed and under the covers, facing the wall. He can hear every move Cas makes. He hears him unbuckle his belt, hears him pull it out of the loops of his pants. He hears the zipper, and then he hears them hit the floor. He hears what he

Dean reaches up to lay his own hand over Cas’ where it remains on his shoulder, “Cas?” he asks softly, like he’s not sure if he’s got that quite right. Like maybe he didn’t guess correctly.
"Beautiful."
“If you get uncomfortable or if it hurts at all, you gotta let me know, alright?” Dean breathes.
"Because it wasn’t like you were
Only a little under half an hour.
It’s an apartment on the other side of town, about twenty or so minutes from Dean’s place. When he gets there, he has to wipe his sweaty palms on his jeans because apparently his anxiety has decided to start seeping out of his skin by way of sweat. Fucking great.
Dean asks, without actually asking.
Cas' hand is running through his hair, something he hasn't done for months. Dean is sure that he's fucked this time. He's missed this. He doesn't want it to stop. Eventually, though, he has to stop torturing Cas with the alcohol. He stands up straight again, but Cas' hand doesn't leave the back of his head. Dean feels dizzy with everything he's feeling for Cas right now. He wants to lean up and kiss him and never stop. Cas is just staring at him. Dean could get lost in those eyes. They're a little softer now, since he's become human. Dean still wants to drown himself in them.
to stop acting like such a sour-puss. You’re twenty-one, not fourty. Just come to the fuckin’ party, Dean, or we’ll just take Cas instead of you.”
Cas shifts in his seat, looking more than a little uncomfortable. He moves his hand from Dean’s knee to stretch his arms out, offering himself up for a hug.
Dean nods his head. “It’s enough,” he says. “It’s enough.” He means it. He even feels a little bit better, knowing that someday, he might get this back. He’s going to lose it, maybe soon, but — he’ll get it back. He’ll get it back, and maybe whatever sort of sad sack of shit he’s turned into will pull his head out of his ass and give Cas what he deserves.
every time he turns around.
It reads:
at him. He shoves it down, down, down, deeper and deeper until he can tolerate being in Cas' proximity.
It takes a lot of struggling on both of their parts to get a very drunk Dean into Cas’ hoodie. Once it’s been accomplished though, Dean leans back over into Cas. Reluctantly, Cas wraps an arm around him. It just urges Dean to move closer. Cas needs to keep warm too, after giving up his hoodie for Dean’s sake. “Don’ be mad at me for kissin’ Cassie,” he says softly. “Didn’t mean nothin’.”
Well, it’s not the worst thing. So far, it’s easier than his junior year had been, but he’s itching to be done with all of it. He’s just so
enough, and now he’ll never get the chance to try.
"I dunno, Cas. You never see how I get when you're gone," Dean sighs. "You're gone, so you can't see it. But when you come back, I just go right back to being okay. Or, I have to act like I go right back to being okay. I still feel the weight of all the times I've ever lost you. I don't think I'll ever
and if there’s anybody in his life who deserves an apology, well. It’s easy enough for him to admit — if only to himself — that it’s Cas.
“You’re not going to start growing your hair out, are you?”
“I would love nothing more, Dean. Truly.” Cas’ voice is reverent as he speaks, and he means it. For Dean to trust him with something like this is the greatest honor Cas has ever received. He’s led Heaven’s armies, but this sits at the top of the list. Nothing will ever take its place.
Cas shrugs his shoulders, “I don’t mind, whichever you prefer is fine. Dean, it’s been lovely studying with you. I’ll see you in class,” he says, standing up and putting his crossbody bag on. He flips it open to tuck his things away so quickly that Dean feels the air tickle his face, and he frowns.
eat, now.
Dean melts into it, resting his hands at Cas’ waist. He doesn’t let it last long, though. Surely everyone inside heard the Impala, and he hasn’t exactly told anyone about him and Cas and what they are just yet. He doesn’t want anyone getting nosy and peeking through a window to see what’s taking them so long. “C’mon, let’s get this over with so I can take you home and keep you in my bed all day,” he says, with one last peck to Cas’ lips.
another short-ish chapter, and only four more to go after this, i think! i’ve had to tweak my outline a little but ultimately i think (hope) i made it better <3
Dean thinks,

painted on it in cheesy white cursive. He rubs his thumb over Anna in the picture, looking up at Garth with wet eyes. He gets up and throws his arms around the scrawny little fucker and holds on tighter than he thinks he ever has. Garth hugs him back just as hard, whispering happy birthday in his ear and telling him he loves him. Dean says it back, and even smacks a kiss to his forehead when the hug ends.
It doesn't take either one of them very long from there, and at a certain point, Dean can’t tell where he ends and Cas begins. If he didn’t know it was impossible, he’d be convinced that they’d somehow fused into one body. When Cas gets a hand around his dick, he’s done for. He comes on the first stroke with a cry of his lover’s name, hooking his ankles together behind Cas’ back to hold him in place.
About a week after they plant the flowers, Dean walks past Jack’s room and the door is ajar. He can see Jack kneeling by his bed, and he stops to listen, just for a second.
Cas sighs. “You’re upset.”
Cas lets him stay like that for a few moments, and then he’s kissing Dean’s cheek and pulling him off the couch. “Come on,” he says. “It’s getting dark. Don’t wanna miss our chance.”
With nothing left to do, Dean takes one last look around the safehouse he’s stayed in for the last few weeks. He’s going to miss it here, just a little. He hopes that someday, when all this blows over, he might be able to come back. Maybe someday he could even fix it up and make an honest home out of it.
Dean, however, seems to be taking his usual route of deflection. “Seems like I’m a lot more stupid in 2014, if you ask me,” he says. That’s fine, Cas will let him get away with it. After all, this Dean has already given him more in the last two days than his Dean has in the last two years.
and how he can
i’m over on tumblr @mishaswitchtits for halloween, but if you’re reading this after october i’d be willing to bet you can find me back at plain ol mishastits. love you guys <3
Before Cas can pull the door open, Dean stops him. He curls his fingers around Cas’ wrist, spinning him around to face him. “Hey,” he says. He feels his own features soften, and then he watches as Cas’ face softens too. “I love you,” he whispers brokenly. “I’m not scared of you. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m scared shitless. But not of you,” he assures. He steps in close and releases his hold on Cas’ hand so he can cup his face. “I still love you. I meant it when I said it. That doesn’t stop just because you’re an angel.”
He's breathing heavily now, and he can feel his release creeping up on him. He pictures himself yanking Cas up from his knees and bending him over the hood of the Impala and- yep. That does it.
“We already know she’s a kickass hunter, but sometimes we get… worried,” Dean agreed.
Claire’s phone buzzed again as another message appeared.
“Yeah kid, your social skills kinda suck and I entirely blame that on Cas,” Dean quipped, ignoring the glare Castiel was giving him. Jack moved to follow Claire, but Dean stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. He leaned down and spoke in a low voice so only Jack could hear. “Look, I know everyone here is a hunter and all, but try not to mention the whole son of Lucifer/nephilim thing. It doesn’t go well in most circles.”
Dean sits up in the seat, adjusting his coat.
"I know people like that," Jody says softly with an underlying encouragement. "It's not cheesy at all. They're the best kind of people."
Castiel stares at him for a long moment and then sighs, feeling dejected. He begins to speak carefully, making sure every word if exactly what he wants to say.
"He was just a kid," Dean continues, trying to provoke any negative response from him. "I beat the crap out of him. Why aren't you chewing me out?"
Dean swallows. He shakes his head. "I don't know. I don't freakin' know, Cas. I just know that I don't want to freak you out. I just—I feel like I'm going crazy, trying to figure out whatever... this is."
"I'd have to say Sammy," Dean smiles back. "It's a hard choice though."
Bobby raises his eyebrows with surprise. "Alright, I'll be honest. That's not what I expected. Dean, this is a huge goal. How much is it?"
"I am what you would call a homosexual," Castiel tries again.
"What are you gonna do about it?" The kid scoffs. "The guy is a fai—"
“Of course I’m okay, Sam. That note—It doesn’t mean anything to you. Just throw it out.”
"I'll be fine," John insisted tightly. "Trust me, Mary. I'm always fine, right? Nothing to worry about."
Dean looks back at Castiel’s hand. “Alright. Dude. Personal space.”
Not enough money for the hospital, Dean's mind supplies. Don't have health care. "I'm not dead because..."
Dean watches as Castiel sets his shoes on the log and steps into the low water, which sits at his ankles. He continues to wade forward into the middle, and then, peculiarly, he sits down. The water is covering most of his pants now, but he doesn't seem to mind in the slightest.
"Promise me you won't drink too much?" Mary had asked, because she never asked for John to not drink at all. She backpedaled then, easily she put her logic and reasoning into the request. "You'll be on the road a lot, that's all."
"Yeah," Dean nods. "They are."
Dean furrows his eyebrows tightly. That incident seemed like it was months ago, when in reality it was only a few weeks. It was just yesterday when he broke the mason jar, and even that seemed like forever ago.

"You should leave."
I love you, they whisper.
"...No," Sam shakes his head. "No. Are you kidding? I can't— I can't take that money. I won't."
Castiel shakes his head. “No, it isn’t important. Nothing worth a penny.”
"Yeah," Dean waves him off easily. "I'm—"
"The one from that movie?" Dean's smile widens and he shakes his head. "Cas, that's so messed up, dude. Why that one? I hate that one. Came out two years ago and it still plays on the radio all the damn time."
Sam hesitates before stepping inside the room and closing the door. “Right. I’m sorry. It was behind the trash can. I shouldn’t have gone translating it, but... Are you okay?”
"We don't need to—"
Sam drops the grocery bags and walks over to him quickly. “Dean?”
Guilt greets him like a familiar friend, and Dean frowns tightly. "You're right. I didn't want you to go."
Castiel reaches for the phone and puts it to his ear. "Castiel Shurley speaking."
Cas instantly lights up, and he gets one of the softest yet exciting smiles that Dean has ever seen plastered on his face. "Yes."
"Just go your room!" He had shouted. "Go the fuck to your room!"
"It's a plant," Castiel explains. "It might help for when the sun is especially grueling."
Castiel gives him another unimpressed look, and Dean is starting to suspect that it's the only expression that can fit on his face. "I'm sure you have. We aren't a different species."
Sam slowly opens the door and smiles awkwardly. “Nope. Sorry.”
"Not much. People are just setting up." Sam gestures to Dean's hand. "Who's the pop for?"
“Dean?”
Sam starts picking up the dirty dishes on the table and brings them to the kitchen. "It would be okay if you were, though. I've got gay friends, they're really nice. Dad is just an asshole, you know that."
Sam has already gone to sleep, as it's a school night. It gives them the privacy to talk alone in the living room. They sit close to each other on the couch, and Dean swears he isn't trying to lean into Castiel, but his body does so on instinct, like he knows that Cas is safe and warm and a good person to be next to.
Dean immediately backtracks and walks into the alleyway, just in time to see Charlie throw a fist at Eli's already-bruised nose. Dean smirks and shakes his head, the sinister anger showing in flames in his eyes. "You just can't stay out of trouble, can you?"
Jody nods. "Yeah. How 'bout I take you to go scope over the beach? We'll take the ATV."
The intensity of which he must protect the man, for example. It feels like it’s clawing at his throat sometimes, making it hard to breathe, but he would do anything for Dean’s safety and he knows it better than he knows the back of his hand.
"Had?"
"Our love will just have to be ephemeral," Castiel says, softening his expression into something much more lovely. His blue eyes are full of bittersweet promise; and Dean is caught between thinking he never wants to see it again and wanting to look at Cas for years.
"Sam was going to take me home," Jess explains. "I have a quiz I need to study for first thing tomorrow. Tonight I just wanted to get out of the house and have fun, but duty calls, you know?"
The last time that he saw Eli, it was not his head, but his fists that were doing the talking. Dean has been working a lot since the past few weeks to think about the flames, because lately he's learning that they were never his to begin with, and that he doesn't want to be known for John's anger. He is not limited to what John has trained him to be.
Castiel huffs quietly. Dean's curiosity gets the best of him and he starts rifling through the bag like a little kid going through their Christmas stocking. After going through layers of the same dress shirts and pants, he finally finds items at the bottom that are worth his time.
And so, Castiel leaves.
Dean pushes past him and turns the faucet back on with cold water, watching the blood circle down the drain in swirls of red. He shuts the faucet off. "Nothing."
Dean is quiet for a moment and then huffs. "I'll think about it."
"I've been alright. You?"
He must remember kisses that taste sweet of soft sodas. Strawberry milkshakes and coffee shops. He must remember bonfires that spark and glow against the sand. The honey halo that sits over Castiel's head when the light frames his figure just right. The Ferris wheel; the fair.
Monroe's mouth quirks into a smirk that matches his son's. "Oh, but I do. Somebody ought to teach you a lesson."
With the lack of reply, Dean shrugs and sits back on the chair, observing the rest of the beach. The door opens and Dean turns around, expecting Castiel. Instead, Jody walks in, setting her bag down. "Morning, Dean."
"Dean," Castiel says with an even worse expression of guilt. "Don't leave yet. I can still call Gabriel. I'm sure they can figure something out without me."
Dean doesn't like becoming this, this dragon that will burn and leave people and things into splintered and scorched pieces. But it was all piling up. His dad wasn't home still. The jar sits barren on his desk. He sees blue eyes in his thoughts. His mom was dead, she was never coming back, he missed how things used to be.
"Yes."
"You really like bees, huh?" Dean asks, holding up one of the books as he remembers the bumblebee Hawaiian shirt Castiel wore on July 4th. 'The Honeycomb of Beekeeping'. Cute. Sort of fruity, not that it mattered, because he was kissing the man on a regular basis. Very much Castiel.
Dean bites his tongue to keep from crying. He was too tired for this. Too damn tired. He's cried enough today, really.
He was drunk, Dean decided with bitter finality. Normally he would fight back on John's points—but this summer made him realize that he didn't need to waste his breath trying to remedy a statement John would forget he made an hour later.
If Castiel knew any less, he would say that Dean simply didn’t mean to fall asleep. This was just simply not true, though.
Dean frowns and stands up with the intention of going over talking to him, but a hand on his arm drags his attention away.
Judging by how long Castiel can sit silently, observing the way people spoke and smiled, seeing the good and bad and choosing to comment on the good, it makes it far easier to understand how he was so ethereal in his ways. Cas has taught peace to run on the track of his veins.
"Oh," Charlie blinks with surprise. "Sorry. I guess I shouldn't have made assumptions. Are you bi, maybe?"
•Left Handed Kisses, Andrew Bird
He looks away from the screen once Sam walks into the kitchen, already dressed for the day. "Morning."
This was going to be the same beach experience—Except that he wasn't going to be the people on the beach, but rather the people watching over it.
Dean smiles nervously. "I doubt it. He's a heavy sleeper."
Sam stares at him for a long few seconds and then shakes his head. "I didn't know you were okay with me going, with all Dad said the night I first told you guys."
"Thanks, Cas," Dean says quietly. "I don't know how true that is anymore. But, for what it's worth, I'll start trying to believe you."
Castiel only smirks, just for a second, before his face goes back to being neutral. "What did you come to say?"
But there were feelings much deeper than that woven into the quilt. Feelings that couldn’t be given an understandable word, but rather a description in many words that didn’t match up like they were supposed to.
He turns to the old books and stares for a long moment, letting emotions roll over him until it seems like he’s drowning in his own head. Love seems to be at the center of it all; an emotion Cas knows enough about to understand that this what he’s going through.
The fire screams louder in his chest. It's desperate to reach out to Cas. Since when has Dean been so afraid all the time? Surely it hasn't always been like this. It isn't fair to be angry at Castiel. He knows this. He feels trapped in the flames— he just wants out. He wants those ocean blue eyes to drown him and save him all over again, to save him from the hell he built around himself, but that isn't fair to Cas either.
And, most truthfully, because Dean knows that he could live without John— but he doesn't know what he would do without his baby brother.
"I didn't know Castiel was over," Sam says as he walks into the kitchen. He goes for a glass of water, stepping around the other two in the middle of the floor easily. "It's been nice seeing you around more often."
"I'll get some bandages. Dean, go wash your hands," Bobby says firmly. He gets up and Dean watches him walk away.
"I've got you," Castiel says gruffly, just low enough for Dean to hear and sounding sweet enough that Dean digs his forehead more into his shoulder.
Dean nudges him away and stands up. "It's fine. They're all drunk by now."
POV you're me trying to figure out an ending to Ephemera that isn't as ridiculous and illogical as the s*pernat_ural season 15 ending
And then he's fifteen. Black eye, tucked fists, protecting everything while John slams his arms on the door and yelling to be let in. But this time, Dean isn't huddled in a corner, or gasping for breath that isn't there.
Castiel gently grabs Dean's wrist. Dean watches his eyebrows furrow in sincerity, and he speaks every word slow and deliberate.
"This is for that incident in the alley." Eli drags him to the shore, keeps him as upright as he can, and gives him a strong punch to the face for good measure.
He doesn't mention Sam has been going to summer school for extra credit. He doesn't mention how Sam got a new girlfriend. He doesn't mention how well Sam is doing with his grades.
The kiss is sweet, and clean, and lovely, and instead of saying any of this, or a gazillion other things now racing through his head now that the silence has surpassed, Dean only leans in and kisses him again.
So, yes. Dean was asleep with a jacket. He meant to be asleep this way.
Dean swirls around in the chair, and sobs even more. “Sammy, y’u got’ help’m.”
"That's alright," Jody says, putting the casserole on the nearest clear surface. She makes her way over and gives Dean a hug immediately.
"Jerk," Sam smiles. "Anyways. You should bring him to the fair. I'm bringing Jess, maybe it could be like a double date or something."
"...Mom."
In the 1980s there were commercials consistently about what to do if you run away as a kid, who to call, why it's a bad idea, what to do if you truly cannot go back home. Add a scene where Dean is distantly watching as it plays on the television and then maybe add a passing flashback where he tried to run away as a kid and it didn't go so well because his dad found him too quick
Sam's eyes are misty. He's trying not to cry just as much as Dean, he can see it. Sam hasn't said anything yet, so Dean takes the opportunity to change the conversation, so he sits down at the dinner table and opens the bags of food.
The asshole from a few nights ago, now being renamed the asshole of today, pushes the man back forcefully. (The man doesn't seem to mind, stepping back and giving him an unimpressed look.)
"Y'know," Sam speaks up quietly. "I had no idea about that. You saving money, I mean. I'm... Thank you. It means a lot to me that you were even going to save a penny."
The sun was glittering off of the waves, and Dean was just so, so in love. This section of the beach was hidden from many people, for many people who visited the beach did not wander. It was their secret hideaway, free from judgement and their cruel words and hard punches.
Down the hall, the note is picked up by curious hands. It was unusual for any of them to bother Cas unless for movie nights, dinners, or other family activities, and something like a simple note slipped under his doorway was unorthodox.
Castiel, calm as always, turns his head and looks at Dean with the softest of looks, as if his hard expressions were melted over time by the California sun.
"I'm not going far," John had shrugged her off. Dean heard him laugh quietly under his breath. "I'll be back in a couple days. It's just to the next town over."
Before what?
He gasps again, air struggling to reach his lungs. He can see white in his vision, with black speckled dots all around the edges of his sight. He thinks he can hear a knock at the door. He ignores it, and the knocking gets louder, more frantic.
Dean tilts his head up and presses a rough kiss against his cheek. "Shuddup."
"It's not weird, Dean." Sam continues to smile, and he pours himself a mug of coffee and takes a long sip from it. "It's Cas, then?"
"Yes, actually," Castiel says, looking at Dean with a glint of humour. "We certainly get more white Christmases."
Dean wonders if Castiel is panicking like he is, or if he is even sparing him a thought. He must be, Dean reasons, if he decided to compliment Dean out of the blue. Maybe this is why Dean swallows the rest of his pride with another gulp of tangy Coca Cola and says something he wonders if he'll regret in a moment.
Dean doesn't laugh. His brain is officially burnt out from the events of the day. "I'm going to head home. Will you be alright?"
"I'm proud of you, son. Really, I am. You're really coming into your own, lately."
Dean thinks maybe there's a reason why it hasn't sunk in yet. His mind is still waiting for the morning. His mind is still staring at the ceiling in the dark. His mind is still waiting for John to show up.
Dean sighs tightly, thinking of that damn mason jar. He can tell Cas, though. Cas seems like the type of guy to keep a secret safe. "Yeah. I'm saving up for my smartass brother to go to college. He wants to be a lawyer, or something. My dad refused to pay and then took off; haven't seen him since."
But silence is telling, especially coming from somebody who runs their mouth under stress, and Dean can see how Sam's eyes twitch into a squint for only half a second before returning to his normal expression. Sam knows something is up.
Dean frowns and leans his forehead on the other man's. He couldn't explain anything being said in his head. It was like all of his thoughts were stuck in time and mix matched and upside down and backwards, and all of the other contradictory phrases that make a brain hurt.
"Are you coming out to me right now?" Sam grins now, and he almost looks proud.
"Shut up, both of you. This is disgusting," Dean says lightly, but he's hiding his own smile. "You two in the same room are dangerous."
"You told me about the thing. You know." Bisexual, Dean's mind supplies. "And I wouldn't have... Well, I probably wouldn't have--"
Dean stares at him, his mind stopping its race around a singular 1-lap track. (He is responsible for Sam. He needs to keep Sam safe. He is responsible for Sam. Look out for your little brother, Dean. I love you. Blue eyes. He is responsible for Sam.)
Dean grimaces. His ribs still hurt like hell lived in the marrow of his bones, and his face felt like he had been run over by a cement truck. He had taken pain medicine before coming over here. "Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm fine. It's healing."
Sam could see it now; and he didn’t like it one bit. Further more, he knows for a fact that if he doesn’t like it, Dean would hate to see him like this. Whatever the reason Cas had for hiding this, it couldn’t have been worth it.
Maybe it's a sign, he thinks. Maybe Castiel won't be temporary. Maybe this could become something special, something that he'll remember and hold on to years later. Dean has never been with a guy before, but maybe for Cas he could make an exception. (Not that any smart person like Cas, man or not, would like him. They'd see right past his bullshit. They would know him for who he is. A mess.)
"Sam's birthday was the beginning of May," Dean explains. "Right before summer let out. I baked him a vegan cake, 'cuz that's what he asked for, and I put eighteen candles on it. Last year I put seventeen. The year before that I put sixteen, because I was there for every single birthday. You weren't."
The message sinks in. Money, floating to the bottom of the barrel that is Dean's mind. John's death left them enough money—which means Sam would be able to go to Stanford.
Charlie is one of them, sitting in front of him with her red-banged hair and a sweet smile and bright eyes. The little sister he never asked for, and one of his new closest friends.
"You're so disgusting," Charlie fires back, but Dean hears the twinge of fear bending her words. "And tiny. Geez, how old are you, twelve?"
Kissing Castiel has proven itself to be one of his favourite things to do. Every time their lips met, it solidified against a tiny little doubt in Dean's head that he wasn't actually attracted to men, and since Dean has a lot of doubt, he must need to kiss Cas a whole lot.
"The night is young," Dean shrugs as he stops in front of a motel. "You may as well tell somebody. Maybe I've got some bullshit advice for you to follow."
"Because of some tourist, okay?" Dean continues, flustered. "He pulled me out of the water and gave me CPR."
"Anyways." Dean clears his throat. "So... Where did you need directions to?"
"Jess is different."
June 28th, 1986
-non descriptive drowning scene (dean is implied to have been forced into the ocean while unconscious to be "drowned" but he blacks out before anything is detailed or explained. He wakes up with Castiel giving him mouth to mouth resuscitation)
"That sounds fun," Dean nods. He grins. "Anyone special going?"
He lets a dream run itself over in his mind. Mornings every day with waking up beside Castiel, helping him begin to keep bees, make dinner in the evenings, and go to the Sunday market. The simple domesticity of sitting on the kitchen floor to fold laundry wouldn't be a rare occurrence.
"Most likely. Sam seemed very concentrated on getting the largest bear they had," Castiel answers the question as if it's with utmost thought and delicacy, his eyebrows creased with sincerity. "Why?"
"That's perfectly reasonable," Castiel says quietly.
Sam stands up and they walk back over to the stall. Sam glances back at the bench they were sitting on and grins. "Beautiful, right?"
"I miss you," he mumbles into his pillow. "I love you, Mom."
Dean also thinks his dad must have been wrong. If these two girls were sinners, then maybe everyone should have a bit of sin in them. What was so sinful about the way people wanted to be in love with their special person anyways?
"What happened?" Dean asks, waking up quickly. "Did he call the cops?"
Perhaps it was this feeling that Dean craves whenever he feels the need to lean in. The calm after a storm. The careful beating of drums. The ringing of ears. The adrenaline; beautifully disguised as peace.
Sam barks out a confused laugh. “Dean, what the hell were you doing?”
They order their frozen treats, Sam and Jess splitting a chocolate ice-cream cone while Dean gets rocky road. Castiel spends a good minute or so looking at all of the flavors while also watching them scoop cones for people in the back of the stall, but finally decides to get vanilla.
"You know who."
(Sam was not around. They had endured another one their “boy band breakups” as Cas’s new friend Bobby had put it, and had not been speaking to each other for the past two days, so far. Castiel chose to follow Dean around instead, because he can’t seem to find the heart to leave him alone. This was another thing that Castiel did not understand. But that is not the current point of discussion.)
July 12th, 1986
Dean was surprisingly calm, too. Despite the terror pumping through his veins mixed with something richly sweet, he was calm, settled with a neutral expression as he stared at Castiel across the fire.
"Are you planning on drinking light tonight?" Charlie questions, gesturing to the singular bottle. "I've seen you down three of those with no problem."
"Yeah, sure," Dean nods. "You two be safe on the way there. Night, Sammy, I'll see you back home."
•?, dodie
"C'mon, Sammy." Dean grins. His lip splits open again from where it had just started to heal, and he grimaces in pain, the grin falling from his face. He shivers, feeling the urge to throw up from the increasing pain. "Let's just eat, right? When did you two meet?"
Dean can't remember the last time someone told him he was proud of him. The swell of appreciation grows with every moment for the people who care about him. This is the meaning of what family should be, and it never mattered whose blood was whose. He stares gratefully at Bobby, letting the tenseness in his expression falter to something much more vulnerable. He's allowed to be young with Bobby, because Bobby has always been there to support him. He realizes that now.
Dean is not against punching senior kids in the face. That might put him on a one-way first-class train to perdition, but at this particular moment he couldn't give a shit. His right fist burns all over again, the bruises on his knuckles coming back more painful than before.
-economical struggle (dean struggles to get money for Sam to go to college and to keep them afloat whilst John is in a different city)
Dean stares at him blankly. He thought this was a good idea, yesterday. Castiel had agreed with him, bless his soul, always being so damn supportive and loving all the time. But it seemed daunting now, to tell Sam that he was... that he liked boys, too. Why did it matter to tell him anyways? He could keep this secret, covered under his ribs and held close to his heart, where nobody could see it but him and Cas.
"I heard," Sam says with an expression Dean's never seen before. He then smiles. "I'll pay. Don't get into another fight."
"Shit, really? Not you again. I thought I took care of you last week. Didn't you like swimming with the mermaids?" Eli grins with the blood dripping down his lip. "Or do you only like fairies?"
"I'll be okay, but..."
FIRST CONCEPT (Aka the first ever thing written for the story):
Sam slides back into the booth, and Castiel sits next to him, so that he's right across from Dean. "Hello, Dean."
It’s the symbols that catch his eye. They weren’t delicate in the slightest, scratched on the paper in what must have been a sprint of the hand. He reaches for the note and unfolds it, finding the neat translation Sam had written underneath all of it.
Castiel does show up later, after the contents of the mason jar is moved to a large plastic bag and after the glass is swept and thrown away. The sky has gotten dark. Cas is wearing his trenchcoat, because it's gotten chilly outside and the wind is causing even the plants and flowers outside to shiver. Dean invites him in, and frowns guiltily when he sees Castiel's eyes are red-rimmed just like his.
Dean stares at her until she finally turns and gives him a pointed look. Dean clears his throat. "Airway, breathing, circulation."
"Is that it?"
As soon as he snaps, Castiel's expression falters from being guilty to nearly heartbroken. It kills Dean. He's finally done it. He's hurt the one person who never deserved it. He feels his silver heart crack in the hands of the man in front of him.
Dean opens his mouth, and bites it back when he realizes his first instinct is to lie. He glances over at his bedroom door, still open. He imagines the shattered glass and coins scattered on the floor. It's a good thing he was wearing shoes when he walked in and out, otherwise his feet would be scratched up beyond belief. He feels the impending failure pressing on his shoulders.
"Alright. Get out of here, you've got work today," Bobby reminds, his voice going back into its normal grumpy lilt rather than his serious concern.
"Well, I heard this song on the radio yesterday. It reminded me of you," Castiel says with a casual smile.
“I can’t have you,” Cas mutters with a dark painting of pity and self-annoyance. “Damn it. I can’t. I wish I could get that through my numb skull.”
This particular thought causes Cas to let out a frustrated groan, because of course the one thing he wants more than life itself is the one thing he shouldn’t dream to have.
"Cas?" Castiel questions, squinting his eyes.
At some point during the evening, they had gotten up from the couch.
Everything was no longer sunshine. It was not bright. Dean sat here, feeling more in shambles than he ever has been, and he was finally exhausted. Life had burnt his heart out like it was the last match, and burnt it to a stub. It felt nice to be held, was the only half-coherent thought he could think. It felt nice to be held.
A quick look outside tells Dean that sure enough it had gotten dark, and they must have been talking for a lot longer than originally thought or had been noticed. A returned glimpse at Castiel and he suddenly remembers that the guy had asked for instructions earlier.
The walk to City Hall is slow, and there's not a word between the two of them. It's hard to think that just this morning they were asleep under the glow of sunlight coming from Dean's bedroom window. It's hard to think that this morning was this morning, and not centuries ago, minutes ago, or even yesterday. Time is skewed and all Dean can remember is a fuzzy haze patched with details that are too clear.
"I never said thanks," Dean blurts before he can even think about it. "For saving me."
"Nothing, I'm just-- I don't know, I'm proud of you, I guess."
He can't feel his face or his lips, he realizes out of thin air. It's just like then. Then is now, and now is then, and time is blurring faster than his vision through the heavy smoke of tears that he's trying to swallow back. John screams at him to stop hyperventilating, to take a hit like a man would. Does he, though? The scream sounds distant. His ears feel like they're bleeding, but when Dean checks, his hands come back wet with only his saltine tears.
"Dean," Castiel says shakily. "You aren't a fire."
Dean looks as though he hasn’t a clue how to respond to such a heartfelt declaration, so he stares with wide eyes for a few seconds too long and then pats Cas on the back. “Don’t worry about it. You had other duties, didn’t you? Hell, you still do.”
Bobby shakes his head. "No, not the kid. The older guy."
“A nightmare?” Castiel asks. “What was yours about, that it could cause such terror?”
•Visions of Gideon, Sufjan Stevens
Dean looks at Bobby carefully and then finally sighs. "I need help, Bobby."
He sleeps.
When Dean opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was blue. Intensely worried eyes with colours put together like a crystal patchwork puzzle of the most intense and softest degrees of baby blue.
"And what exactly have you done for me? My entire life, Dean has been the one to make the meals, help me on my homework—Hell, he drove me to my first date. You've never been there for me. Not when I needed it."
"We just gotta stick together like we always have," Sam assures him.
Sam lets out a victorious laugh. "I knew it! I knew something was up."
Castiel nods quickly and rushes over to the window, unlocking it and pushing it upwards. "You go first."
“Penny for your thoughts?” Dean raises an eyebrow.
How easily our fingers would entwine, Dean suggests in his head. How your stubble would feel scratched against mine.
Since then, Dean practically raised him, and he hopes now, watching Sam dance around happily, that he did somewhat of a good job honouring his promise. Between the long nights he stayed up making school sandwiches or waking up early to make breakfast and walk Sam to class, between halting drinking, between working hours in the sun and sea, between a mason jar full of dimes and checks. Between all of it.
"I'm not gay."
"No, no, I didn't mean anyone. Nothing like that." Dean wasn't exactly lying. The only thing was that, telling Sam he had a job working at the beach was tricky. If he told him he was taking up a lifeguard job, then he would have to say why. The Why was something Dean couldn't share; and he didn't want to keep a secret if Sam knew of the secret's existence to begin with.
"No." Cas begins to smile. "Do you?"
Nonetheless, Dean realizes with every word that he loves Castiel's gruff voice and would listen to him talk about anything for many hours if he had so much as the opportunity. Despite the fading sunlight behind him, Dean can only concentrate on the way Cas speaks through a bated breath.
"Oh yeah?" Dean gives him a cheery smile right back. Cas deserves all the smiles in the world. "Which one?"
scenes that either didn't fit in or were written randomly and added later in some form or another, or just me playing around with ideas
He spoke like his throat was trying to balance gravel between each syllable. Not to mention how he sounded right out of a prayer hotline commercial. Dean turns to look at the man.
And while Dean waits for something, anything, any kind of cue from Castiel that he hadn't completely screwed up, Castiel simply squints his eyes as if he'd never been apologized to either.
the poem Nothing Gold Can Stay—Robert Frost
Sam doesn't ask why, but he nods as if urging Dean to continue.
"Yeah," Dean says lamely, watching her leave.
•Moonlight Swim, Elvis Presley
It's a two story house, but it's small. Pale blue exterior, white accents, and a fancy porch with the most clean front steps Dean has ever seen. Red rose bushes paved around the perimeter, along with an assortment of neatly trimmed hedges. It was always the nicest houses that held the most ghosts inside.
"Cas. I love you."
Dean leans forward and presses his lips against Castiel's. They've done this a few times now, and Castiel resorts to what Dean assumes is his most natural kissing position, which consists of a loosely wrapped arm around Dean's neck. It drives Dean crazy.
He stares down at the paper and crumples it in his fists without a second’s hesitation, listening to the material crackle as it’s sharply and forcibly collapsed. He tosses the note behind him, not bothering to look if it even made it in the trash can.
Dean and Jody watch the last person leave as the sky turns purple. It was a slower day today, most of it was spent with conversation.
“C’you r—rrrr—re-read this?” Dean holds a paper out.
"It's over thirty-thousand," Dean admits quietly. "And I know it's the most I've ever asked of you, but Bobby, I need your help with this."
"Does it have to do with Dad?" Sam frowns.
Charlie is happy for him though, and Dean can see that. There haven't been many people in his life that ever show him the time to care. Dean sighs and looks up. "I technically owe it to you, I guess."
I love you.
When they left the diner, it was getting late. The sun was changing from yellow to an orangey-glow, burning into the side view of their eyes.
"Any plans for today?" Dean asks.
And all at once, there was the most surreal feeling dwelling in Dean's head, burning and searing like all the fire in the world. He needed to hear Castiel talk, to hear him be less of an enigma, to hear him share stories and laugh.
•My Own Worst Enemy, Lit
All the while, Castiel nods quietly and looks genuinely as though he was listening. This is the reason why Dean clears his throat and continues.
With a creak, the door opens, revealing Bobby with a concerned face. "What the hell happened?"
Before he leaves, he buys a glass bottle of Coca Cola—for Castiel, of course. Then he's on his way back to the beach. He's starting to see the sun slowly lowering in the sky, with shades of purple clouding the top furthest from the star.
Castiel looks down. "Thank you all for having me, this was enjoyable. However, I should probably leave now."
Dean looks down from Bobby's gaze, which ultimately gives the answer that he didn't want to vocalize.
chapter 7, when John came home with Sam for the first time when Mary died in childbirth except it's a more in-depth coda to it... John passes out from being drunk and Dean is woken up by Sam's crying... he sneaks out of his room and goes to sit with Sammy, who instantly stops crying and tugs on Dean's finger. Dean is all wide eyes and although the knows deep down something is wrong, and is wondering why mom isn't home with Sam, he very quietly whispers to Mary that he'll protect Sam like he promised when Mary was pregnant with Sam. That he'll be a good big brother. Possibly fits it with Mary's pov chapter if that's still?? On the table?👀
"What are you talking about?" Dean scoffs, dragging him lightly by his arm. "It's a party! They're rad. The beer, the music, the babes—Well, for you I guess it would be the dudes, but the point still stands."
Dean nods, clenching his teeth and trying to ignore the forming lump in his throat. "Right. I mean it, though. Thank you."
"Did you let a boy in here?" John sneers, low and venomous. "I didn't raise my ladies man of a son to be—"
"Hey, Sam," Dean speaks up. "Does Jess know about the time that you peed your pants on picture day? What was it, like, fifth grade?"
"Bitch," Eli laughs. "You just haven't met the right man yet. I can show you something you'll really like."
(Castiel's hand had been on his shoulder. There's broken glass in the trash can beside the fridge. John had a glazed look in his eyes, it happens when he's drunk. There was a sway in his step, there always is. There are heavy footsteps. Castiel's eyes are so blue when he looks at him, incandescence swirling in oceans. He's climbing out the window. He couldn't feel his hands but they were dripping blood. John's car pulls up to the driveway. The sunflowers wilt in his presence. In steps the heavy boots. Cas's hand is on his shoulder.)
"Yeah, I guess you're not wrong," Dean says, laughing at the lack of subtlety, which helps the way his chest momentarily stops over the word boyfriend. "What's your brother's name, Cas?"
"Can we?" Castiel looks at him with wide eyes, sounding hopeful.
"Hey!" Charlie smiles at him. "It's the super cool guy who kept me from drowning."
Castiel has experienced many emotions over the years, but none of them have quite fit the mold of whatever was blossoming in his chest at this very moment.
"Nothin'. Get some sleep, Cas."
They walk into the line for the ride together, and it doesn't take long until they're seated alone in a small cart that is steadily traveling up to the sky. As soon as they reach the top, Castiel sucks in a quiet gasp as he stares at the view of the town. Dean understands the feeling, but sometimes he forgets how truly beautiful the place is.
Castiel visibly relaxes at this. "Of course. But the offer will stand as long as you need it to."
He pulls Castiel away and down the pier before he can hear Sam's quip. "Can I ask you something, Cas?"
Dean shakes his head again, cutting the sentence off. His voice breaks. "I'm just so sorry, Sam. Mom wouldn't have wanted this for you."
"I don't want to go," Castiel admits quietly. "I want more than anything to stay. I like it here... But I think we both know that I have to."
“I understand,” Sam interrupts before Cas can choke on his own tongue. “Don’t worry about it, Cas.”
“Okay.” Sam nods back. “Okay, that’s great. So why was this thrown out?”
"Uh," Dean gives him a shrug. "It was just a jar that I accidentally dropped. It was in my room, so you won't step on any glass in here. I swept it up."
-self-internalized homophobia (internal struggle, mostly resolved)
Bobby gives him a firm nod. Dean knows that he understands.
Sam scoffs and shakes his head. "Call it what it was, Bobby. He ditched us so many times for gamblingl that he barely would even be considered family, much less a dad."
"Don't give him any credit. You put in the hard work and effort when he didn't, all he did was die." Bobby shakes him off. "How about Castiel? Where'd he go?"
There are chapped lips pressed against his own, breathing oxygen into his lungs for when he apparently wasn't able to.
"There's a beach party tonight. I was going to bring drinks," Dean looks over at a firework that explodes in the air. The light dims the bright colours, making it more like a burst of smoke in the blue sky. "Some friends, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend are gonna be there."
"My son would never lie," Monroe steps forward, uncrossing his arms and squaring his shoulders.
An image of an empty mason jar flashes in his mind. Sammy's determined face when he told John he wanted to be a lawyer that night. The late bills sitting on the kitchen counter.
Castiel was unlike anybody he's ever met. He would show up in the oddest of places, often acting and speaking in the most peculiar and unorthodox of ways. Why was Castiel here? Why did Castiel seem like he always had a greater purpose of simply existing? He was like a puzzle that he couldn't solve; a great big jigsaw puzzle with hundreds of pieces, many of them upside down. Dean imagines that each piece is a different shade of blue, just like the man's eyes.
"Mills," Bobby says, stepping aside to let her in. "Thanks for coming. I don't think I told the boys I invited you over."
Castiel's eyes meet his and his lips quirk upwards in a pleased sort of smile. He was radiant. A sunbeam. No— a moonbeam, like the iridescent pale glow over water, through fogged glass, or through tired eyes. Mysterious, not through kept secrets anda repetitive shifting of eyes, but more so like he was a great painting that had only been sketched out yet, not fully formed in the portrait of his beauty.
Living a hard life will do that to you, Dean figures. You can't focus on how beautiful the water is when you're trying to put out fires, or you'll shrivel into dust yourself.
"You may regret not keeping him around as much as you can," Sam points out.
Castiel reluctantly looks back, narrowing his eyes at the nickname but stopping for Dean nonetheless.
This is the moment where thoughts clear into view, where fear begins to burn where adrenaline once ruled. The storm has passed, the dust settles, and the villagers of the fated town now have to see the casualties the lightning has brought to their lovers. They are among them, because Castiel is leaving in mere moments, and Dean is saying goodbye. There's a dreadful sort of hotness that comes when his eyes well up with tears, so he presses his nose into Castiel's shoulder and holds him there, breathing in steadily and trying to remember.
"No, thank you. Dean brought me a soda," Castiel says pleasantly. He looks up to see a larger firework explode in a dazzle of green and blue.
He opens the door with pale, shivering hands and walks in. Immediately, his eyes fall on Sam and some girl that—
Perhaps it was the sense of dread. There was temporary euphoria, washed over with a tsunami of confusion, when it suddenly clicked that night about being—Bisexual, is what Charlie had called it. After that golden moment of realization, he was washed away in crappy beer, and now that he was sober, the twisting feeling of fear set in.
"Go to hell, Dad."
Dean silences him with a gentle kiss to the lips. He may as well have hotwired Castiel’s brain.
Dean questions whether or not Mary would accept him, if she had known. If he had grown up normal, if he had a mom to tell these sorts of things to. If, if, if. Had, had, had. 'If' and "had" pounds in his head until his stomach twists and he feels nauseous.
Castiel just keeps sitting there, perfectly still and calm in the water, on Earth, like he deserves to be there and be human and real and HERE, and yet looking so incredibly ethereal that Dean couldn't begin to put words to describe it.
“Yes, um...” Cas nods slowly. “Good morning. Is there a reason you’re sleeping in the hall?”
"Fuck." The words choke their way out of Dean's throat; a strangled and desperate sound that he can no longer help. He buries his forehead into Castiel's shoulder. "Cas. You can't just— Fuck."
Sam walks into the kitchen and takes leftovers out of the fridge. "I'm reheating casserole for dinner. How many plates?"
With that, Dean trudges, alone, back to the house. His clothes are sopping wet, each step he takes squelches and leaves a trail of footprints behind him. His hair drips water onto his nose. Every bone in his body aches.
People have always been there for Dean, he was just too focused to see it.
Eli grabs one arm and yanks Dean closer to the water. "Don't worry, pretty princess, this will wash that red right off. Just think of it as a day at the spa," he snickers.
"It would be enough, that's all I'm saying." Bobby glances back at Sam.
“I know I can't,” Castiel explains after a beat. “I know I can’t, because Dean Winchester has never given me a second glance.  And that’s okay. I love him more than anything, even if the way he’s comfortable with me expressing it is just with our friendship.”
"Huh," Dean murmurs, following along with intrigue. "You got a favourite sibling?"
"A bit shaken." Charlie looks at him carefully. "Better than the other guy," she teases.
"I'll be okay," Dean promises, his voice soft but firm. He turns his head to the right and kisses into Castiel's dark hair. "You've got things waiting for you in Pontiac. When all this is done, there'll be time for us. We'll try again, maybe. If you want."
Dean feels a hand on his knee and his head jerks up, feeling a shiver go through his entire body. Castiel was looking at him with so much concern it was almost tangible, just like the cloth he holds between his fingers. He has a frown and tightly knit eyebrows, and quietly mouths to Dean, asking if he is okay. Or maybe he had spoken the words aloud, but the buzzing in Dean's ears prevented him from hearing Castiel clearly.
"Yeah, yeah," he nods. "I'm fine. It's all healing, it'll be fine. I've had worse," he grins crookedly.
"Our love will just have to be ephemeral," Castiel says quietly, softening his expression into something much more lovely. It's fucking tragic. His blue eyes are full of bittersweet promise; and Dean is caught between thinking he never wants to see it again and wanting to look at Cas for years.
The rumbling of the explosion began then.
"Shut it, I'm not finished." Bobby sighs. "I'll take out about seven grand. That ain't covering much of it, but it should do a hell lot of a bigger dent then what that lifeguard wage will do. Now, you can't be complaining about any of this, okay? I'm glad you asked for help. I'm real glad."
But damn it, Dean feels like a hero, and he hasn't had to kill anybody in order to do it. He thinks distantly that he should get over his bitterness about John and remember that he wasn't going to come back from whatever casino he went to any sooner by Dean bitching about him in his head.
-saving from drowning scene, not serious and nobody is hurt. (dean works as a lifeguard trainee and saves Charlie's life, but she isn't in serious danger and is okay)
He realizes then, watching the last coin fall to its side, that despite his constant need to keep people close, he's always been so lonely.
Dean blows the whistle around his neck and as he sprints forward, picking up a rescue surfboard. Confused swimmers start to wade out of the water. He's able to see the person now, her fingertips reaching out to the sky weakly before disappearing under the waves.
Dean looks back up at him, looking almost guilty before he takes the note from his hand. He raises an eyebrow at the writing. “I don’t write in—This is Enochian, right?”
"Can you tell me about her?" Sam speaks up quietly.
The door behind Dean cracks open, both of them going silent. Please, Dean prays; please go back to sleep, baby. Don't let him see this monster, this vulnerability of a boy standing in front of the tall shadow of everything he hates about himself.
As always, the reply is cool and sweet. "Of course, Dean."
"Right," Dean says, looking at Castiel with an additional understanding. He clearly didn't get his personality and way of life from his dad, or his brother Gabriel. Of course, it could be that Cas got it from a different sibling, but something told Dean that Castiel was just fully himself. (He doesn't ask about his mom. His lifetime pays enough answers and experiences to know not to ask.)
Before Castiel can stutter out a half-baked lie to explain why he needs to switch hotels, a woman is running over to Dean with a panicked expression on her young face.
There's a droplet of sweat running down the base of his neck from his hair, disappearing into the white dress shirt that he's wearing. The blue tie is still wrapped around his neck, albeit loose and untidy.
Jody gives him a firm nod. She has pride in her eyes. "Good job, Dean."
Dean's gaze follows Sam's, but somewhere along the way gets lost, because he's looking at Castiel. He's making friendly conversation with Jess now, both of them smiling politely. The sun is doing that halo thing again, like it was made just to shine on Cas.
He feels himself falling further with every word Cas spoke. But it's too early for that, isn't it?
Beside him, Castiel is completely silent. It's unnerving, really. He doesn't say a word, yet Dean can almost feel that the man is always thinking, thoughts overturning in his head like an axe to a grind. While it was curious, Dean didn't feel like he was at any discretion to ask for what the words swirling in his head were.
"No, no, it's totally cool, like I said," Charlie says quickly. "It was only one date. Plus, look at all the other cute girls out there," she grins.
There are a lot of human things that Castiel has grown to understand.
"I'm not attracted to females," Castiel says, still looking completely puzzled by Dean's blabber. "I don't understand how that would work."
"Bisexual?" Charlie reiterates. "It means you like both. Like, you'd kiss a girl, but you also wouldn't mind fooling around with guys too."
"Did I drown again?" Dean croaks out immediately, just woken up and yet a quip is already on his tongue.
"You can come with me," Castiel says firmly. "Come back with me to Pontiac. The church can support you and Sam, you can stay with us. With me."
"So. You stay here a few nights," Bobby speaks up. "Few weeks. Months. Whatever you need, long as you pitch in around here. Sam goes off to college. I can help you get your own place."
Dean's smile, weak as it was, fades in an instant. "What the hell are you talking about?"
Dean raises an eyebrow. "Right. Well—Whatever, okay?"
Dean huffs a nervous laugh and sits down at the kitchen table. He props his feet up and faces Sam with his arms crossed. "Uh..."
"It was that kid again. Eli. The punk who nearly drowned me with his dad." Dean sits his tongue on the top of his mouth and looks down, the guilt growing worse. "I may have thrown a punch one too many, Cas. I feel like shit about it."
The frown drops. Castiel is completely caught up in his own world, and looks beyond annoyed with this inevitable result. His eyebrows furrow and his mouth pulls into a deep frown, he mumbles to himself about how messy food is unsettling, or something of the like. He pulls a napkin from his pocket and starts wiping his hands.
As for Cas himself, well, the man was interesting enough. He had a strange way of talking and interacting, but that made him all the more entertaining and Dean wouldn't mind spending more time with him. Dean glanced over at him as he thought.
Dean's head quickly lifts to stare back at him. "The hell do you mean?"
Jody drives around in the driver's seat of the ATV, observing the people swimming in the water. Every few minutes there's a distant boom coming from people setting off fireworks in the bright light of the day. "I'm going to be dragging Claire and Alex to a block party. Donna is hosting, it's sort of like a July 4th Potluck."
"Castiel. It's nice to meet you too," Castiel says gruffly. "Although I wish it was in better circumstances."
Dean almost hates him for it. For staying in the house, next to the beach, where it reminds him of everything he's lost. Everything that they all have lost. Sam having to grow up without a mother and father, because John stopped being around, Dean having to lose his childhood the moment the hospital rang out the final beat of her heart. But then he sees the waves of the ocean roll over the sand, and he hears the faint whisper of his Mom.
Castiel raises both eyebrows at him and walks over to the bag. "I'm not hiding anything, Dean."
"I can show it to you after the fair, tomorrow?" Castiel suggests. "I found it while on a walk. It's beautiful; I assumed you knew."
"Like hell I can't," John bit. "I raised you, Samuel. You're mine. I'm not paying for that pretentious stuck up little law school just so you can walk into a fancy building and pretend that you're a hero."
With all of these words, all of these feelings, bubbling and stretching and twisting around like a messily knitted jumper, Castiel does the first thing he can think of. He grabs a nearby pen and starts scribbling madly on the first blank paper he finds.
"I did not know that."
"Hey," Dean greets him.
"Sometimes the light shined over him in a way that gave him a halo," Dean mumbles. "Every other time, he didn't even need one. He just breathed, and that was it. I didn't just—I didn't just love him. He was love itself."
He'll hate you, Dean's thoughts scream. Doesn't that make you angry? He'll hate you, just like Dad. Can you feel the fire rage? Aren't you afraid? Sam will leave, just like Dad. You won't be able to handle it. You can live without John, but Sam? What if Sam hates you? Doesn't that make your blood boil? Don't you deserve to be alone yet?
"I certainly hope so," Castiel leans closer nonchalantly. "You look even more beautiful when you blush."
"The Stynes beat me up. Turns out they didn't like me defending some of the smaller guys roaming around town. They think I'm a homo," Dean scoffs. "I got beat up bad, and by Monroe of all people."
Charlie is pushing her way past people and finally jogs up to Dean. "Dean! I haven't seen you in what feels like forever, man."
John was dead, Sam was off at college, and here Dean was, hugging a pillow close and sobbing brokenly into the bedsheets because of a blue-eyed man who stole his heart and left with it.
It takes a second of nothing before Dean shakes his head. He pulls the seatbelt over himself, this time with no interruption. “Nah. You’re just fine, Cas. Just fine.”
He pulls the lady out of the water by her arm. The woman is already unconscious, meaning that she may have hit her head on something. Dean suspects the surfboard floats above them.
"It's not that I'm embarrassed by you," he starts, which isn't the right thing to say, judging by the way Castiel's eyebrows twitch downwards. Dean pauses, and Castiel's expression resumes its calm resolve. Safety, he thinks distantly. Remember safety.
Whatever this stupid crush is, this ridiculous infatuation—Dean feels it growing stronger. Not worse; because that would imply the existence of a negative connotation to whatever was buzzing in his head. This thing, whatever it was, while confusing and sometimes frightening, was comforting and warm all the same.
Dean watches as Castiel brings his hands over to his own chest, holding them over his heart. He feels the steady beating under his sweaty palms, and as his breath becomes as even as the pace, he can start to feel his limbs again. The panic and rage replacing themselves with shame. Shame for feeling so vulnerable, shame for letting himself lose control, especially with guests in the house. Especially in front of Castiel.
"What are you talking about?"
"Ooh," Jody brightens up. "Tell me about them. My daughters refuse to talk to me about their crushes, you gotta give me something."
-blood, mentioned in fight scenes, semigraphic/intense fight scenes (multiple fight scenes between dean and Eli, both of which due to dean defending somebody else and going a bit overboard, dean gets ganged up on by Eli and Monroe Styne)
"Well," Jody says, pulling away. "I say we eat."
The waves crash.
Jess chews her lip and looks back at Sam. Sam shakes his head slightly. "What if I come back tomorrow? We can talk then."
So Eden sank to grief,
He had said that he wouldn't take more than a few days; but two weeks later there was a call to the Winchester residence coming from a cheap motel down in Vegas. Dean heard him tell Mary over the phone that he would have to take another week, and then promptly hung up.
"Is this why you asked me for a job?" Bobby asks again.
"Sam, shut the fuck up." Dean stands up. For once, the fire in his chest is used for something he truly believes in. "You're taking that damn cash and you're going the fuck to college. You deserve that much."
"That's what Mom used to like about the beach," Dean murmurs. "The smell of the sea. She said it calmed her, too. I never understood it."
Dean stares at him with a scowl and finally shakes his head, throwing the towel he was using to dry his hands into the sink. "I'm just pissed off about Dad not being back, okay? I had to ask Bobby for a job at the freakin' beach to make sure our bills were paid."
The waves crash. Dean is too caught up in his thoughts to hear Mary's familiar whisper—
Castiel falls completely silent, a splotchy blush over his face and spreading down his neck and the end of his nose. He shakes his head. "That's very kind, but I'm not exactly what 'the guys' find attractive."
Of course, Dean understands this, he has a habit of doing the same thing, but there was a very specific way that Castiel went about it.
Sam makes a noise of amusement. "Of course."
Dean slowly shakes his head. "I can't do that, Cas. You know I can't do that."
"Sure, anything."
He's said the words, in one way or another. Sam knows part of what Dean was supposed to tell him. And while there was a weight lifted off his chest, of having told somebody that he cares about something that had felt like a heavy stone in the pit of his stomach, there was still pressure. It felt like he wasn't out of the clear yet, somehow, even though the truth has been revealed.
"What?" John barks a sharp laugh. His eyes look sinister, warning Dean enough without even using a word. His smile is ugly and the farthest from genuine, all sharp teeth and ready to kill, like a monster under the bed.
THIS CHAPTER HAS SPOILERS
Bobby's house sat directly on the beach, which was a short walk from where John and Mary moved in years before. He was always an old family friend, he always made sure Sam and Dean were getting fed and babysat whenever John and Mary had gone on dates.
Fourth day on the job, and he's thinking that he might finally take Bobby's advice about getting there early. He told him, "it'll wake you up, trust me." Of course, Dean has only ever trusted Bobby's advice, so it wasn't like he was opposed. He just wished that his shift didn't start so early to begin with.
"He left some money," Bobby speaks up. He looks at Dean knowingly. "From his—we'll say expeditions."
"I have a right to be here, I'm an American citizen," Asshole says, which is quite proving to be an asshole thing to say. "I was using my free speech."
"A double date?" Dean shakes his head, trying to ignore the sudden tenseness in his shoulders. "Sam, I'm not—"
Dean swallows. "Cas is the tourist I told you about a while back. The one who gave me CPR?"
Dean sighs and stares out at the waves crashing over each other.
He looks enamored by what Dean was saying, which Dean figures makes sense. He doesn't like to talk about Mary often. He doesn't like to imagine her memory getting tainted with the way he tells it, with his clockwork brain turning each sludge-covered thought by gear.
He sits up at the lifeguard tower and just observes over his coffee. He takes a sip, looking at how the waves gently roll over one another, as if they were telling each other secrets. He hears his mother's voice faintly in the back of his mind again.
For now, he's content with breathing in the peaceful quiet of things not going wrong for once. The other shoe may drop, but until then, Dean is happy. He's positively giddy, damn it. He doesn't want to think about what comes next.
•in the bed, dodie
The design of the place didn't look like it had changed much. The floor still had a white and black checkered floor tile that younger kids now called "vintage". The walls were covered in a sandy yellow paper and were adjourned with seashell artwork and license plates, and sea glass hung from the ceiling tightly with brown twine over some of the diner tables. It was quaint and small, wasn't the cleanest, but Dean almost felt like he was visiting a long lost home.
"Well, yeah," Sam scoffs, "but it's still crazy expensive, even if I get a dozen hundred scholarships it's still gonna cost."
"Dean," John repeated sharply. "I asked you a question."
Castiel jumps, but after a moment he smiles and waves the sparkler around, watching the popping lights follow the movement of his hand. Dean watches the reflection of the sparks in Castiel's eyes and grins. "It's fun, right?"
"Resuscitate?" Dean stutters. "I was... You mean you had to—?"
Castiel’s voice was much gruffer and quieter than it normally was, like his spirit was being weighed down just as much as his heart was. His shoulders sagged, making him look vulnerable and honest and sad.
Dean blinks. He sees a crab scuttle back into the foamy green of the water. Furrowing his eyebrows, a memory drifts over his thoughts like clouds grace over the sun, clearly and distinctly in the way that makes Dean wonder how he could ever forget it in the first place.
It's the most terrifying thing; to watch the understanding fade into Castiel's expression. His eyes grow softer as well as wider, and his eyebrows raise just slightly with what could only be viewed as surprise. He isn't sure what it is about Cas's face, but he falters and forces himself to look away, feeling the deep pain of rejection beginning to swallow him whole.
Castiel blinks, his eyes widening at the accusation, and he trails back. "No, of course not, Dean. I simply came to ask for the directions I came for last night. I would have asked somebody else, but I—I must admit, I wanted to see how you were doing."
Jody scoffs and lightly nudges his shoulder. "You're ridiculous, Winchester. What about you? You got any plans?"
(When he was in High School, he dated a girl named Cassie. She was gorgeous, dark curly hair that flowed to her leather-jacket covered shoulders and deep brown eyes that were full of a certain spark all the time. She fought for what was right, always working for charities and such.
At one point, Dean must have laughed hard enough to bust a lung, because here he was having thoughts about kissing a certain dark-haired blue-eyed boy and John was nowhere around to stop him. Damn it, nothing could stop him, and the thought did not make him actually do it, which only made him laugh harder.
"have a theory that we don't mean anything to ourselves. We carry our heads on our shoulders, we fight, we breathe, we think— but for many, we're taught first to remove our inherent selfishness and care more about the people around us. Everybody is walking around in the stitches of temporary they've created for themselves. True Happiness is a balance, I think, which makes it so rare. Give and take keeps the world turning on its axis."
There's a knock on the door that causes Dean a shockwave through his skin. He looks up at the door quickly and then looks at Bobby—because no matter how much he hates it, Dean was ready to be a soldier, ready to follow orders, the second a threat was present. It was like a phantom of John's voice yelling at him from a chipped spot in his inner ear.
Dean's posture raises and he plants his feet firmly. "No, sir."
It suddenly strikes Dean that Castiel could be anybody. He could be a drug dealer. He could be a drug user. He was already gay, and he was a little dorky, but that was the extent of what Dean catalogued about him.
Dean was having such a nice dream. He was standing on the pier, his toes dipped in the frigid water while Castiel held his hand and read to him. The words don't process in his head, but he feels so safe. So calm, wrapped up in the warmth of Castiel's arms while he snores softly into his chest.
He must remember all of these things, he feels if he won't then he might die. His heart wreaks with grief, and Castiel is still in his arms. He's still holding Dean's hand, and he's still letting his shoulder be used as a pillow.
As he continues looking through the bag, he realizes that Castiel was sort of a boring tourist. His singular bag wasn't packed with funny crap that Dean could tease him about. It was just clothes, this greeting card that Cas probably forgot to take out when he left, and two books— neither of which were the Bible, which Dean would have assumed considering the guy's family runs a church.
Castiel smiles again at him, and it makes his stomach do a silly loopy thing. "That sounds wonderful, Dean. Have a good night."
Shortly put: John would not be finding out from Dean any time soon.
His muscles tighten, thinking of the bitter stench of alcohol, the painful flinch before a punch, harsh words that grate against his ears in an uncomfortable dissonance. He blinks rapidly and shakes his head. "Yeah, y'know, just stupid fights. It doesn't matter."
Out of all things he expected the note to be, a love poem was not one of them. He expected notes on the case. A grocery list, maybe. But not this.
Charlie spares him a nod, and Dean finishes patching her up while an ambulance is heard distantly in the background. Her friend, the person who alerted Dean in the first place, sits beside her and takes her hand, squeezing it and giving her a meaningful look.
This glass jar has a shadow bigger than itself. Looking at it makes Dean feel the very animalistic urge to punch a hole through the wall, to rip open the plaster with his teeth (He doesn't have enough fucking money), to shout into an empty void until his throat is raw (Everyone will leave him, he deserves it), to kick something until all he feels is a throbbing leg (He'll never complete this goal. The sand in the timer will run out, just like it did with Cas, just like it will do with Sam leaving, just like—)
•ivy, Taylor Swift
The kid no longer looked as young, although still younger than Dean. He was probably around Sam's age, which made it even worse to look at him. He was sniffling up snot as well as the sticky red blood, tears running down swollen, tired eyes. Dean noticed that while he had bruises on his cheekbones, the most painful injury looked to be his lip, which was swollen in two places rather than one.
"If Dad won't help me get to Stanford, I'll still need some form of education to be a lawyer. I thought one of these would work," Sam explains.
Castiel does not understand, however, why the love of his life refuses to sleep with a blanket while they are on the road.
"Amen," Bobby says sarcastically. Dean sees Castiel give him a curious glance, but he doesn't appear offended, and he looks away just as fast.
"It's just water."
John didn't say anything back, instead he gave a half-hearted chuckle. Dean heard his shoes against the linoleum as he stepped back and picked up his suitcase. He then stepped out the door, closing the door behind him.
Dean doesn't warrant it with a response, instead looking over at Bobby. While they had left, Bobby seemed to have remained sitting beside the phone. "Any updates?"
And Damn it, Sam looks like he's about to cry, with clenched teeth and a flared nose, holding back big crocodile tears that make him look four years old all over again. "Dean, we can use it to move, you deserve to go somewhere with your life too."
It was strange to be in this particular location. The last time they were there, Sam had forced Castiel to sit with them in a booth. Dean watched him drink a milkshake, and watched as he looked so out of his element sitting with a group of people.
Blood is in his mouth, coating his tongue with tangy iron. "Assholes," he spits out with the blood, watching the red splatter against the sand and making it clump together. "You seem to have a weird obsession with gay people. You sure it doesn't mean anything?"
"From what I've seen, you do it all for love. And you have no idea how good you are. You help people and fight for your friends, and all you see is the blood on your knuckles, and the mistakes that you've made." Castiel frowns deeper, tilting his head to the side. "You have this... this anger, and you think it controls you, but it doesn't. You're more than your anger. You always have been. You're not really an angry person, and yet you still hold it with such responsibility that you convinced yourself that you are. That doesn't make you a sinner, Dean, that makes you brave. You are so, so brave."
Eli groans, holding his nose.
Sam avoids his eyes. "Nothing. It's just—People talk. I was just wondering."
Eli glares. "My dad would be proud of the work I'm doing for the town. Driving unsavouries outta here. You should know about that, with your deadbeat Dad driving out of this town every weekend."
Dean shrugs, the smile not leaving his face. "It's nice to be able to talk to somebody who could have been gone," he explains, but then pauses. "Does that even make sense?"
Sam turns to look at him, holding the stack of napkins in his hands. He looks confused at first, and opens his mouth as if going to correct him, but something stops him. He glances back at Castiel, and then back at Dean.
"I know, jerk." Sam smiles back. "By the way, you should go shower if you're going to go talk to Castiel tonight. Just a tip."
Silence fills the air. Dean can't even hear his own breaths; he's not sure his heart is beating. The vision around his eyes blurs around him and all Dean sees is directly what is in front of him. He would hate to admit it, but the first feeling after the original shockwave is relief.
Cas must have been there for several hours, smiling at the ceiling while lost in his own hedgemaze of a brain, because when he finally sat up again to go talk to Dean, the clock read that it was morning.
"Oh. Sorry about that."
He looks out the window, at the ocean; and through all of his anger, through all of his overwhelming disappointment and crushing guilt, he stops, and he breathes. He sees the waves moving in tandem with each other, and sees the dark midnight blue of the water.
Except it wasn't the exact same. It wasn't the same because Castiel would withstand the test of time given when you meet a stranger. Castiel would stick around longer than one might expect. The clock started the minute Dean turned to look at him. Now sit back and watch as it ticks with every word on this page.
I am a monster, Dean thinks. I am a fucking monster.
"Have you kissed him yet?" Charlie asks excitedly.
"Are you sure he isn't just—... Yes. I understand, but—No. That isn't what I'm saying, you know that, Gabriel." Castiel sighs sharply. "...Do you need me there?"
But a tiny voice whispers in his ear:
"I can't believe I'm related to that asshole," Sam says angrily as he walks through the door. "He's such a dick!"
There was blood splattered on the ground from where Eli had spit through his sobs. Dean's hands shook as he finally let Charlie pull him back. Eli did not get up, instead choosing to shake in the spot on the concrete where he curled up to defend himself.
"Cas," Dean speaks up. His voice was grated and rough, trying not to carry as much bittersweetness as he felt about the man in front of him.
Dean has met a variety of people. He's seen a plethora of faces. He's talked with an abundance of personalities. And no matter how much he will guilt himself later, meeting Castiel was the exact same as everybody else. Completely and utterly ordinary.
Emotions took energy. Every tear made him tired. Dean could not be tired, with the life that he has. He needs to be aware of everything, he needs to be awake. Castiel must have understood this in some way or another, because he has a recognized expression on his face and doesn't argue when Dean said he didn't want to sleep.
ideas, rough drafts, etc, copy pasted directly from my notes:
"But you have to go. You need to, because if anybody is going to make Mom proud, it's gonna be you on that stage, holding that damn diploma," Dean says roughly. "You got that, bitch?"
Perhaps Mary had tucked him closer to her side, perhaps he was shivering with his toes in the sand. But she said in an important voice that he would fall hard in love one day, when he found the right person, someone who made him happy and calm, just like Mary had found John.
"No trouble at all," he replies immediately, sliding out from the booth. He looks at Sam and Jess. "Jess, it was really nice actually meeting you. Uh—Sammy, I'll see you at home. I'm just going to drop Castiel here off."
"Yeah, no shit. Do I look as dumb as dirt to you?"
The fire is dangerous. It is violent. It will wipe out everything in its path before he can even blink, fueling by the smallest of mistakes from someone who has done wrong. In this case, that someone is Eli, who is breathing oxygen into it without knowing the consequences.
This is the moment where thoughts clear into view, where fear begins to burn where adrenaline once ruled. The storm has passed, the dust settles, and the villagers of the fated town now have to see the casualties the lightning has brought to their lovers. Castiel is leaving tomorrow. Dean will have to say goodbye, and he will learn to live without his angel.
"Holy shit," Dean murmurs to himself.
Castiel makes him feel like he can learn to be at peace, and isn't peace the whole point?
Dean walks back to the lifeguard tower and looks around for Castiel to finish their conversation; but the man is nowhere to be found. He frowns slightly, furrowing his eyebrows with a slight confusion. "Castiel?"
"So, Castiel, where are you visiting from?" She asks, picking up a fry and dipping it in ketchup.
Dean picks up the plate and walks into his room, ignoring Sam completely. He shuts the door behind him and sits on his bed. In front of him, on the table, the mason jar sits on a desk. Just a couple of quarters are scattered on the bottom of it.
Dean opens the door with a laundry basket of freshly clean clothes balanced under his arm, and Cas--He looks awkward. Incredibly so, with tense shoulders and squinting eyes and all. Dean notices the second thing; Cas isn't wearing his trenchcoat again, which he can understand because the heat was starting to ramp up now that July was about to start.
After Cas finally decides not to go back to Pontiac, to stay with dean and his new funds from John passing away, Castiel gets a phone call from gabriel explaining that chuck will let him run the garden for the church and that he retired with lucifer's nephew, named Jack, taking on the responsibility. Castiel frowns and hangs up, saying he has a lot to think about, and then dean tries to convince him through heartbreak that he should go, that he needs to go and follow his dreams, because cas has wanted this more than anything and he deserves it. Cas tried to convince him to come with, but dean shakes his head and tells him that he needs to keep the house maintained
"Damn," Dean mutters to himself, and with that, he walks into the bathroom.
Dean really is about to laugh. He's about to say how ridiculous Castiel looks, teasing him with a giant grin on his face, but before can even open his mouth, Castiel looks over and asks him softly to sit with him. Dean finds himself walking over before his mind can process the request at all.
Castiel hums shortly, his eyebrows creased in a way that makes his expression indiscernible to Dean. "What about you, Dean? What's keeping you in California?"
A week has passed since the fair, and there are a variety of thoughts and ideas that have decided to take permanent refuge in the storm of Dean's brain. Thoughts that seem like second nature, that one day were not there and the next they were, and it was perfectly normal because these thoughts made him feel more himself, he thinks.
"I'm happy," Dean finds himself replying, he realizes that this is the first time in a long time where he's said that and meant it without a breath's hesitation. It feels lighter on his chest, so he gives a shy smile. "I really am."
"I'm sure we can," Sam takes her hand and twirls her around. "Let's go."
Mary hugged him with the utmost of tenderness, wrapped her arms around John's waist and loved freely with no fear. She had kissed John with her hands carefully placed on his cheek, as if he had been a delicate thing that could be swept away if the breeze got too drifty.
"Sam's a minor. I'd call the cops on you for kidnapping," John states plainly, a twinge of victory and knowing curling into his voice.
So he just whispers the only thing that he can say.
He pulls away and vomits saltwater all over the sand, coughing and hacking as he does so. His nose burns uncomfortably, and he's shivering so bad that he doesn't even account for the physical injuries given to him by Monroe and Eli.
They meet up with Sam and Jess after the ride on the Ferris Wheel, where by then the sky has gone a deep twilight. The glee in Jess's face as she's clutching a medium-sized stuffed bear under one arm is palpable from the streetlamp's light. Her other hand, Dean notices with a smirk, is still tightly linked with Sam's, who looks far too proud of himself.
"Are you kidding, Dean? You need me," John growls. "I pay for your entire fucking living. I pay the bills. I buy your food, your clothes, I bought this roof. I bought the fucking bed that you used to sleep with the filthy—"
"Nothing," Dean says quickly. "Cool your jets. I just needed to talk to you about something."
The door to the diner rings a bell as he walks in, and he sees Sam and Jess sitting in a booth on the far side of the place. Dean grins and slides in next to Jess. "Hey."
Dean thinks about it and then lets out a heavy sigh, shifting on his seat. "Alright, fine. What do you want to know? Just anything?"
Dean's head is quiet, and everything feels still—Earth paused it's gentle turn so that when Dean looked at Castiel, neither would move.
June 14th, 1986
It starts with the ringing of ears, the pounding of his knuckles on the door. The rush of waves clashing against the rocks, the sun beginning to rise behind the horizon line and decorating the water with shimmering scales of light.
•Do I Wanna Know? Artic Monkeys
"Don't worry about it," Dean says easily. "We've got an ambulance on the way, alright?"
Dean rolls his eyes, fighting a fond smile. "I'm sure."
Dean snorts as he wakes up, looking up at Cas sleepily. He blinks dotingly at him. “Morning, Cas.”
He knew distantly from the second he saw that note on the fridge that Dad would be back eventually. But he wasn't expecting to be here, standing up to his Dad, when he finally came back. He's stronger now. He'll use the flames he was given to smoke out this asshole, and this time it'll be someone who really deserves it.
"How could I do this to her?" Dean breathes. "No. Dad—Fuck. How could you do this to her? Do you think Mom wanted her kids to be raised without both parents? Because you're never here. I raised Sam on my own. If Mom were here, she— Don't you dare speak about her like she wouldn't hate your guts."
"People might see us," Castiel mentions, and Dean knows that he only said it for Dean's benefit. "Are you sure?"
Dean can see Castiel's mouth moving, but something has taken over his head and he can't focus on anything other than making sure he apologizes for the terrible mistake he's made. He also sees Castiel's expression fall while his blue eyes trail down, and the concern in his eyes finally shuts Dean up. "What is it?"
"I'm having fun," Castiel defends, but Dean can see the warmth in his eyes. He looks back over to Charlie. "I was invited here. I decided to go with consent."
"Dad, I don't want to look after the house. I want to be out there," Sam said pointedly, giving a tight frown as he gestured to the door. "I deserve to go to school. I've always been a good student. This is my life, you can't just say no."
"Ridiculous," he mutters to himself. "Freakin' ridiculous."
Castiel hesitates, but he doesn't look angry in the slightest. He tilts his head and leans forward, staring at Dean intensely. "I don't see why I can't be both. My father is very inclusive in his Church."
"That's me."
•'tis the damn season, Taylor Swift
This coastal town was small, but cheaper than the main one next to the interstate. Colourful houses in ranging sizes were placed beside each other in lines. People knew everyone here, they kept their circle large enough to reach the general community.
"I've never been with a guy before."
And with a growing list of things to miss, the one arriving at the very top is a mason jar, now shattered in pieces. Dean feels the remorse clog his lungs. He doesn't know why he misses it so much, except that he does, and that he wants things to be back to before.
"Andy." The kid—Andy, huffs. "Thanks for that. I really did try to convince him that I wasn't— You know. Like that. It was only a prank, really. But he didn't budge."
Dean looks back over at the entrance, just in time to see Castiel walk in. His breath catches with a smile at the sight.
Dean laughs easily. He did think, distantly, that since Cas showed up, a lot of people seemed to be talking to Dean that were like him. Like Cas, he corrects quickly. As in, they liked other genders. And these people were all very nice. Charlie, for example, was surprisingly pleasant company, and they had only been talking for a few minutes.
Sam fights the urge to roll his eyes, and instead just frowns deeply. He steps forward and crosses his arms. “Listen, man. You like Dean, don’t you?”
It must have been an amalgamation of feelings. Happiness, lighter than the multitude of feathers he used to carry on his back, that bubbled and twisted at his heart at the same time. Amusement, because the confession was so eccentric, even to Dean’s standards.
Dean smiles at him. "Yeah."
The sudden relief that floods over Dean in waves is unexpected but he is entirely grateful for it. Instinctively, he surges forward and grabs Castiel by the lapels of his coat, pulling him closer and planting a firm kiss on his lips.
"You're making me soft," Dean says, leaning forward and burrowing his forehead into Castiel's shoulder. "Damn you."
He hands Castiel a few of the napkins, who smiles and takes them gratefully, continuing to wipe his hands down. "Thank you, Dean."
Dean shrugs and folds the shirt, putting it in a pile. "My mom used to do it. It's a habit, I guess. The floor is clean, Sam sweeps and mops twice a week. He's a clean freak like that."
"Who else would I be with?"
"You really should leave people alone," the second voice spoke. "Especially when your religious information is falsified. God has no particular bias against homosexuals."
There's a few seconds of silence, with Sam looking awfully tearful, which almost makes Dean nervous until he lets out a watery laugh and nods. "Okay. I've got it. Thank you."
"Why the hell would you care now?" John continues, taking a sturdy step forward. Dean fought back the urge to flinch. "You got a pretty girl over or something?"
-alcohol/alcoholism/underage drinking (scene detailing dean's experience with underage drinking, alcoholism, as well as mentions to John's alcohol problems. alcohol is mentioned on several occasions in scenes where there are parties or conversations between characters.)
Dean's smirk turns to an amused grin. The damned man was actually being coy with him, and if he was being honest, it wasn't a bad look on him. "I'll figure you out one day, Cas. Just wait, Sunshine. You'll see."
"Maybe."
Castiel shocks the both of them again by speaking up calmly. "With that logic, Dean is no more than an obligation to you. And since you've clearly failed that obligation, you have no reason to stay. Dean is far over eighteen, you have no power over him."
For once, he's right. There aren't any angry flames in his stomach. They flickered and popped a while ago, fizzling into nothing but smoke that clogged his lungs. He was not fire. He was salt water. Like his tears. Like Cas's eyes. Like the waves that violently crashed against the rocks, not knowing why they did so and having no option other than getting hurt due to their own will.
Dean's heart sinks in his chest. This is the first time he's dreaded hearing Cas's voice. Dean doesn't turn to look over at him, instead watching John as if he's a python ready to launch with its sharp teeth. With Cas behind him, he feels a surge of bravery. "You didn't pay for shit, old man. I'm the one who's been paying the late bills while you were off dicking around with slot machines."
Marking the watch on his wrist, the beach was officially open, meaning that people in their tiny bikinis and colourful trousers would start flooding the sands to celebrate the coming summer. Surfers would show up in droves to take up space with their patterned boards and sun-kissed skin. Then there were the people who would just sit on the sand for hours, usually lovers, and then got up to leave when the day was done.
After his shift ends, he's inhaled enough smoke from the day that his throat is scratchy. The door to the corner store opens with the chime of a bell, and he walks towards the large freezer box carrying the drinks. He isn't totally sure how many people are attending, so he buys two twelve-packs of crappy beer and hopes for the best.
Dean frowns. "Well he told me that—"
"Sorry," Dean murmurs again.
Dean turns his head back to him, and there isn't a beat to pass as Castiel leans forward. Their lips brush, tasting of sugar and salt. Dean was right. Castiel's lips are rough. The stubble of his cheeks grates uncomfortably against his face. It's the nicest kiss he's ever had.
Castiel nods firmly. "Yes. I was wondering if you could still give me directions? I know you were probably just headed home."
Too many damn thoughts are running through his head today. He swears he can feel it about to explode.
He must remember blue eyes. Not a shade plucked from the sky, nor a drop from any ocean, more beautiful than each and all. Downturned and deep set, holding so much love for humanity, even the simplest sprinkle of dirt on the land.
Dean wonders sometimes, if he went back in time, what would he say to his past self.
Dean yawns. "I'm lookin' after Sammy. Just like I promised you. Hope I'm makin' you proud. He certainly is, going to college and all that."
Castiel looks at him wearily as he lets himself be dragged down to the beach.
After his shift ends, he promised Sam that he would go hang out at the new diner that opened up near the city center so that he could meet Jess properly. When the clock hits five and people have left the beach to most likely eat dinner, Dean heads to the locker room to wash the salt water off of his body, and then leaves with salt between his toes.
"I'm sorry that I failed you," Dean says with bare honesty. If there was ever a time to be honest, it was now. "You deserve big things. You deserve to get into Stanford. Damn it, Sammy. I'm sorry because you deserve to go more than anything in the world, more than any other snot nosed rich kid, and I'm even more sorry that deep down I don't want you to go because I'll be alone. And I'm fucking terrified of..."
One would think that having worn the trenchcoat for every occurrence before, to be without it would make Castiel look vulnerable and weak, like a thin soldier without his armour. But Cas doesn't look like that at all, Dean thinks. He looks just as awkwardly proud and selfless, even if he was lacking a prominent layer.
It's a loaded question to answer to somebody so holy. But, Dean decides to be honest.
•Be My Baby, The Ronettes
Dean lets his gaze pass around the beach, which for once isn't littered with people. It makes his chest tighten with the beginning of rage. "Too freakin' quiet. Damn it."
"Dean."
"Hummingbird heart" 💕🙏✨✨✨so cute please use
"Let's go, then."
Dean watches them take off and half-snorts. "They are so sickeningly grossly sweet."
"That wasn't a request, Dean Winchester."
"Beautiful," she had said. "Beautiful baby boy. Beautiful Dean. I promise I'll protect you."
Charlie smiles softly and nods. Dean thinks that they must be in love, these two girls. There was no doubt about it, with the way they looked at each other. Like the other had hung the moon and stars, even when just moments before the air was tarnished with fear.
"Nothing," Dean shakes his head. "You know, you're awfully nosy for a foreigner."
Charlie hums thoughtfully and the two of them walk back over and sit beside Castiel.
Things will never be the same after this. But that doesn't matter much now that Castiel is leaving. He has to say it. He needs Cas to know before he goes.
"You never care any other time," John says with a condescending smile. He turns from the open closet to look closer at Dean. "You never give a shit about your old man. I could keel over tomorrow and you wouldn't fucking care, huh? Despite everything I do for you."
•Mystery Of Love, Sufjan Stevens
Dean's face grows warm and he stares Castiel down. If a flirting battle is what he wants, a flirting battle is what he is going to get. "And what about you? What makes your cheeks go pink, Cas? Surely it's something. You can't always be that cool."
Sam portions out food onto two plates. "Right, right. A business trip. God, that's so ridiculous. He should just be honest. We all know that his business trips don't require him going to Vegas, and we've seen his credit card receipts."
"I was wondering if you wanted to go to the fair with us," he explains. "Us being Sam, Jess, and well—Me. It would be another tourist spot, but it could be fun."
"...Goodnight, Dean."
Castiel narrows his eyes but slides out of the bar. He puts down five dollars on the table. "Thank you again."
He’s suddenly very aware of the fact that Castiel is just down the hallway, sitting in his room doing whatever ex-angel’s do in their free time. Sam had left to get groceries, which was lucky for him, because then he wouldn’t have to witness the clownery about to unfold.
"'Course," Dean nods, letting a warm blush come across his face that was most certainly not caused by the heat of the sunlight. He shrugs it off and clears his throat, instead turning his gaze to the group. "We should play arcade games, or something."
"Green," he points out, counting each shade on his grubby little fingers. "And white. And—"
Castiel walks up beside them, his hands lacking a sparkler because he had disposed of it in the bucket. "Hello, Charlie," he says pleasantly.
Dean widens his eyes. "What? No, I didn't mean to be offensive. Sorry, Cas."
"I don't."
"Seagulls are very artful creatures, aren't they?"
Cas was a honeybee halo, sweeter than sweet and searing permanent marks onto Dean's lips in a perfectly clumsy manner that reflects into the very makings of his stitched soul. Cas has a natural serenity that he seems to radiate, like a careful grace that gleams through his veins like his own brand of stardust.
Editor grace I just want to say I'm sorry lmao
Important things:
"Jimmy kinda looks like you," Dean points out.
"Happy?" Dean cuts. "You didn't. I had to learn that on my own."
All Dean can really feel is adrenaline and fear and a fierce intensity to protect everything he's worked so hard to love this summer. Himself, his life, his family, and of course Cas—
"Do you want to go on the Ferris Wheel later?" Dean asks him privately.
Jess frowns deeply, looking over at Sam with concern. "Maybe I should go?"
That night, he dreams again of blue eyes. He's not so sure that he hates it anymore.
"Ah."
Dean tries not to burst out with a cacophony of disbelieving laughter. "Uh. Okay. I would not agree with that statement, but okay. I'm guessing you like crabs too?"
Jess smiles and waves with the hand that's not holding Sam's. "Hey. How have you been?"
A little ways across the sand, there was a mother building a sand castle with her daughter. The little girl was grinning wildly, and although Dean couldn't see too well, he could see her mouth moving animatedly. A smile quirks on Dean's lips and he looks away.
"Doubts?" Dean questions. "Like to the church?"
"It's alright," Dean's smile grows. "You don't have to be awkward about it, that's all."
One night as they sat with a box of pizza on their laps and a movie playing on the projector in front of them, Cassie asked him if he'd ever been in love.
"Bye," Dean calls after him, and then sips from his coffee with a long sigh.
His hand lifts after a moment longer. “Of course. Should I return to the backseat?”
Revealed through maybe a journal entry in John's possessions after he died that Mary was going to skip town as soon as she gave birth to Sam and abandon them at the hospital, BUT she died during childbirth. Dean feels betrayed by this.
"Dean," Castiel says shakily. "You aren't a fire."
Dean glances between the two. "Um... Right. Uh. The ambulance is on the way."
Dean makes an exaggerated noise of offense. "I would never embarrass you!"
"You smell like salt," Sam raises an eyebrow. "Were you over at the beach earlier?"
(Tick. Tick. Tick.)
The memory fades just as simply as it has come, leaving Dean to exhale a heavy puff of breath. He shakes his head, thoughts coming too slow to be coherent now.
"You can," Castiel insists. It almost sounds like he's pleading, begging to keep Dean safe and in his arms. Dean brushes the thought away with the sickening shame of feeling clingy, because he truly does want that sort of protection, but now isn't the time. Not when he needs to take care of things. "We'll figure this out together. I can assure your safety there. Please, let me help."
He's staring up at the ceiling, watching the reflections of a lighthouse slowly turn on the dark of the ceiling. The window is open, he can feel a slight breeze through the air.
He's fifteen, sporting a fresh black eye and huddled in the corner of his room as John thrusts his fists against the door, not so much knocking but not exactly punching either. The particular instance was after Sam had asked to go to a friend's house, in which Dean said yes. John came home, asked where Sam was, and was furious when he found the answer. ("What if he gets kidnapped over there?! It would be your fault! Your fault, Dean Winchester. And then I would have nothing, because your mom left me with nothing to watch him but you. Open this damn door before I break it down!")
Sam did not flinch back. He's always been the braver one out of the two of them. Instead, he leaned backward and glared angrily. "Pretend?"
"I'm listening," Castiel says, his eyebrows furrowed as he looks at Dean with worry. "Are you alright? You seem... intoxicated."
The dark-haired man glares harder, looking thoroughly unimpressed, and looks at Dean. Dean looks back. The guy didn't look gay. First; he didn't have an earring on his left ear. Everybody knows all the gay people have earrings on their left. Plus, his nails weren't painted, he didn't look like he took extreme care in his hair, and while his shoes were well managed he wouldn't exactly point them out exclusively to be "sensible".
"Hello, Dean." Cas purses his lips and does his usual squinted eyes and furrowed eyebrows, giving him a funny expression that made him look incredibly awkward in the most endearing of ways. "I wasn't aware that you were in residence here."
"Good to hear," Charlie laughs. "I'm going to get drinks, do you want anything?"
"Yeah." Charlie puts her hand down, sitting beside him on the log. "I made it out okay, thanks to you, so that's good. How does it feel saving a life?"
His face is the dreadful sort of hotness that comes when his eyes well up with tears, so he presses his nose into Castiel's shoulder and holds him there, breathing in steadily and trying to remember.
"I don't want you to go either." Dean counts the stress lines in Castiel's young face. "But you're right, I know that."
The sky is darkening in hues of purple, swirling around him and swallowing the light left from the day. As he's passing down an alley, he hears the struggling of somebody in a fight.
The sun falls in what seems like a blink of an eye. Dean was told by Bobby the other day that this was probably due to the fact that he hasn't needed to brush off any of his first aid training yet. (Which was an absolute pain to try and study for while John was practically breathing down his neck. Seriously, that man cared too much and not at all about all of the wrong things.)
"I'm fucking crazy," Dean gasps as they quickly walk down the side of the house. "Cas, I'm insane."
Jody also begins to grin and then steps forward, giving Castiel a tight hug. Dean watches as Cas flusters for a moment, not sure what to do with the sudden physical attention, but then sees how he melts into it with a soft smile. Adorable.
Dean is gently led inside of the room by Castiel's hand on his arm. "What happened?"
"I'm very happy to be here," Castiel says with genuine contentment. He gives Dean a smile back, fondness in his eyes. "Thank you for the drink."
Finally, Dean shrugs decisively. "He doesn't look gay to me."
Dean nods quietly, biting his tongue.
It is lovely.
He never thought he could have this. This absolute wholeness, radiating on their skin and between each single eyelash and imprint of lips and fingertips. It was something more than the grittiness of being human. How did he survive before this; when it felt as normal and right as it was to breathe oxygen? How could he ever think this was something damned? This is what holiness feels like. It's not himself-- it's the feeling of Castiel in his arms.
"Is it about Castiel?" Sam speaks up.
Sam takes the paper and looks over it with narrowed eyes. “Dean, this is in Enochian. No, I can’t read it. What are you up to?”
"Yeah," Dean says lamely. "Uh— Listen, do you have a moment? Like, to talk?"
July 14th, 1986
"Pretty sure even if he believed me, he'd still talk his way through the police," Dean says dryly. "I'm really just hoping he fucks right off."
“Cas,” Dean repeats, quieter this time. He’s never sounded so vulnerable to Castiel’s ears. He clears his throat. “This is a hell of a wake up call.”
But Castiel does none of these things. He doesn't say a word. He looks at Dean for a few seconds and then nods, and then continues walking. And really, Dean should have expected that much. No reaction that Cas has given to what he says has been ordinary or like anybody else Dean had ever met; that was being proven time and time again to be part of the man's character.
Castiel, wearing the same clothes as the time that he's seen him, and Dean can only imagine how hot he is with the sun starting to shine brighter as it rises. Nonetheless, the man is looking around with his squinty-eyed expression, so Dean sighs and takes it upon himself to walk up and talk to him.
Castiel makes a humming sound, which Dean has never heard coming from somebody with such a deep voice. It was almost relaxing. "Yes, you're right."
"Dean," Cas says behind him. Dean finally turns to really look at him for what seems the first time since he's woken up. He was beautiful as always, crystalline blue eyes and an expression full of a concern that could only come from somebody who actually cares.
-Scene where castiel forces dean to go collect seashells and hes so excited but dean is like "I literally see this all the time but you are very cute"
Castiel laughs quietly and takes Dean's hand, standing up himself. They join Sam and Jess in the sand, dancing to the pop music and the roaring noise from the sky. Once again he feels the lightness of his chest, and the heavy, healthy fullness of his heart.
With a sigh, Dean puts seventy percent of the first paycheck into the jar. The more than generous check that Bobby gave him was also tucked loosely inside. Together, it made about seven grand. And while that was more money than Dean could ever imagine having for himself, it still only took off a little more than a fourth of the price for Stanford.
"How did your 'coming out' or whatever go?" Dean wonders aloud. "With your dad and weird brothers."
"Sure, Sammy."
"Cas," Dean speaks up.
"My brother," Castiel says, hesitating slightly. Dean watches the calm mask of his falter and fades into an expression of stoic sincerity. "He took me on a road trip, when I expressed my concerns over not wanting to become a priest. But... when we got to California, he left me here with a note."
The next morning, Dean finds him at the library table, his cheek pressed against a book and quietly snoring. He’s woken up, they go back to work, and days continue like normal.
"Nature’s first green is gold,
Dean forces himself to look away before the lump in his throat gets more painful. He shakes his head stiffly. "Sam, I'm so sorry," he says, his voice stripped of his usual defensive tone. "Shit. I'm so sorry."
He guesses that he must have forgotten to layer the coats of sunscreen. Nonetheless, it hurt like a bitch and added to the anger in his chest, like a spring coiling tighter and tighter.
"I'm glad you agree," Castiel grins back at him. He points to a small handful of tiny crabs that scuttle behind a rock. "Look, there are crabs!"
•The Sadder-But-Wiser Girl For Me, Robert Preston
But he was leaving.
Dean learns that Jody is divorced, which is why she moved to California. She's only been here for a year, which is why Dean doesn't know her from when he was younger. He also learned that she has two adopted daughters who argue a lot but ultimately love each other. It sounds like a happy family, when it comes down to it. Jody sounds happy.
"It's full of life, honey." Mary holds him closer, propping him up on her hip. "See? Look. Look at all of those ripples. It's alive, just like you," she pokes his nose, "and me."
Working as a trainee lifeguard was just going to be a summer job. The plan was that Dean would work for a few months, just to rack up some more cash for Sammy to go study at Stanford, and then he would quit and go do something he'd rather waste his time with. Messing with car engines always sounded fun.
•Fool, cavetown
Castiel had stopped trying to talk to people, it seemed, for now he was just sitting on a log on the other side of the bonfire and staring silently at the flames as people danced around him. The orange and yellow of the fire cast golden light across his face, illuminating his skin in a handsome glow. For somebody who Dean seemed to associate with the colour blue, he fit warm tones devastatingly well.
"What are you thinking about?" Castiel asks him, his piercing gaze bringing Dean back to the present.
That wasn't all. It was never all. But Mary had a habit of biting her tongue and speaking through her teeth around John in an attempt to get him to stay. Or so John had told Dean multiple times after Mary had passed.
"He's got blue eyes, Mom," Dean murmurs, his eyes struggling to stay open. The mason jar on his desk blurs in his vision. "Blue like the ocean. I'm obsessed with 'em. They're so damn gorgeous. I didn't know guys could be pretty, but Cas is the prettiest thing I've ever seen."
Castiel was shaking him awake, which doesn't help the massive headache he was sporting. But he did wake up, and the first thing he saw were those damn blue eyes, just like before.
