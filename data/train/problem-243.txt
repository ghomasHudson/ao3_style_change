“I brought lunch,” he said. His face was arranged in the type of pleasant mask that made John step back and analyze what he had in his hands before kissing him. It seemed to be only food, though; John set it on the table and wrapped his arms around Sherlock. He tilted his face up and kissed Sherlock’s long neck, then buried his face in Sherlock’s cold coat. Sherlock kissed the top of his head and hugged him back, a fierce yet distracted embrace.
John drew away before either he or Sherlock was ready, returning to little, light licks around the soft slick flesh. Sherlock writhed impatiently, but John held his hips immobile and forced him to take his pleasure at John’s rhythm. It was only when John knew that his time had nearly elapsed that he penetrated Sherlock with his tongue once more, and then, as the last few seconds ran out, seized Sherlock’s heavy, aching cock and stroked him until, as the timer rang, Sherlock came, his body stiff, then limp with pleasure.
“No! No, Sherlock, you are not abnormal.” John said, gently. “And I can help you. There’s another treatment, one that really is medical.”
“Yes.” The bannock was delicious. John reached for his tea but Sherlock had scooped up his mug and was drinking it in long gulps.
Sherlock reflected on the warm buzzing in his belly and the tight heaviness it had engendered. Mental distraction as well; he had not been able to deduce anything of John’s mental state, remaining rather more focused on his own.
“I’m surprised to find you here,” a voice said some time later, though it felt to Sherlock like no time at all. “You hate hospitals.”
Elyse tossed her head with impatience. “I’m sure you can’t drive your car through a wooded chase.” She swung herself onto the blue roan and waited for John to follow.
Instead, John entered to find Irene sitting at the desk with her hands over her face, her shoulders shaking in a way that suggested she was crying.
John briefly considered climbing in next to Sherlock, going so far as to kick off his shoes before good sense took hold.
“John . . .” Sarah came around the foot of the bed in hopes of catching and keeping his attention. “I don’t suppose you want to tell me what’s going on?”
“There,” said John, touching a puncture wound. “But I don’t know what the ribs were meant to represent.”
“I should lock the door,” Charles said suddenly, and in his mind John could hear Fiver practically screaming in his ear.
But Sherlock couldn’t stop working in order to take care of John every few minutes. John should at least know that much. Which was, perhaps, why John had been making himself scarce when Sherlock was on a job.
Two bright red spots appeared on Elyse’s cheeks, and her mouth became a thin, mutinous line. “You don’t
Seeing there was no way around it short of making a break for the garages—and John at least had the presence of mind to know he was not fit to drive—John allowed the two men to lead him back to the house, where Mrs. Watson, Gerrie and Harry waited in the library for news.
“Curious. It would be useful, after all, so you would think they’d work a little faster to come up with an answer.”
“Of course! Oh, but you see, I recognized you from the blog. Geraldine Holmes, darling, but you can call me Gerrie.” She patted his arm and pushed him toward an armchair that seemed almost too nice to sit on. “Do you want tea? Something to eat? Boys living on their own the way you two do, I’m sure you don’t eat properly.”
“I will try to be kind to Irene,” Sherlock said as they made their way back over the hill, out of the trees and into the July sunshine once more. “But . . .”
Sighing heavily, John got out of bed and slipped on his jeans before stalking through the flat to Sherlock’s bedroom doorway. “You do realize you can’t make me do anything, don’t you? I’m not a dog. You can’t tell me to sit and stay.” He was trying to sound reasonable, but found it surprisingly difficult due to the well of irritation Sherlock’s attitude had tapped within him.
Sherlock froze and his eyes flashed over to where Irene sat on the bench, absorbed in something she was looking at on her phone. “International art,” he echoed. “Tell me more.”
“Looking for the scoop on your roomie?” Irene teased. “He’s not going to kick you out, John, I promise.”
She answered the phone with “John! I was just going to call you! I wondered how the two of you made out the other night. Not, you know, made out, but . . .” She sighed. “I’ve put my foot in it again, haven’t I?”
This was, Sherlock was learning, the chief difficulty in having someone like John in almost constant proximity—an inability to get as much done as quickly. Things he would have ignored in any other person held weight and meaning where John was concerned.
“John . . . love . . .” Fiver’s voice was breaking, and John suffered a pang of remorse for having hurt his feelings.
Sherlock was so busy musing, he didn’t realize he hadn’t answered John. Not that John found this surprising. Sherlock was not given to comforting words or actions; his mind was almost certainly focused on the facts of what they had just witnessed, what it might mean, how best to solve the riddle. John knew from experience that he was on his own from here until it was all over, or at least until Sherlock next found him useful in some way.
Still watching John, Sherlock stood, slowly unbuttoned his shirt, and slid it from his shoulders and arms before dropping it onto his chair.
“Dear Jim,” said a voice from the doorway of the flat. Sherlock and John both jerked upright from where they’d been bent over the sketch and discovered Moriarty leaning against the door jamb, arms crossed over his chest and eyes turned to the ceiling. “The man I was supposed to marry is in love with another man. And to add injury to the insult, he’s accused me of conspiring to kill my brother.”
Sherlock stared at the disc where John had set it on the desk as if it might be a viper waiting to strike. He was aware the best course of action would be to simply get rid of it, but at the same time he told himself there might be something useful on it, so he slipped it into the computer drive.
John slapped the sponge down and washed his hands, drying them on a dishtowel before moving toward his own room.
Sherlock sighed. “There’s more to this than a ring, John.” He paused. “Hemlock isn’t something you drink on accident.” He strode into the bedroom and glanced around. “So what did they drink from?”
Sherlock sighed and moved toward the sofa, but John said, “I won’t be able to get a good angle there. Go lie on your bed.”
“It didn’t occur to you that the man who preyed on you when you were fifteen might still be a predator twenty years later?” John asked. “If not, then why were you so scared of him the night he came here?” When Sherlock remained silent, John added, “Ah! Because it’s all about you, isn’t it?”
“Not enough to charm you, apparently. Anyway, maybe Irene won’t come back tonight.” Christopher kicked off his shoes and removed his watch, setting it on the bedside table. These were the same things he used to do when they’d come home from one of the endless parties to which he used to drag Sherlock, and the detective was briefly overwhelmed by the sense of déjà vu.
, John reminded himself—someone he’d never heard Sherlock mention, and yet she was an “old friend”?) in the living room was laughing. Had Sherlock said something amusing? “Well I’m alone now, aren’t I?” John asked Mrs. Hudson. “Except for you,” he added when he realized how that must have sounded. “Sorry.”
John rolled his eyes and put the phone back in his jacket. “I have no idea. I don’t even know what it is.”
Gerrie’s icy blue eyes met John’s steady gaze. “It’s difficult to miss something you never really had, John. Consider yourself lucky, or unlucky, as the case may be.” And she sailed past him to the yellow room, intent on making sure Jeremy didn’t mishandle any of her property.
But John said, “No, I don’t think so.” When Mycroft turned his steely gaze on him once more, John explained, “I don’t think he put that much thought into it. I mean, it would have taken time to—to have it sized. I don’t think . . .” But John wasn’t sure what he did or didn’t think.
And somewhere in those piles of papers that were shoved into and between the stacks of books was the solution to this mystery.
Lestrade stood there for a moment, unsure whether he should just go and come back later, but before he could make a decision, John emerged from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, leaving Lestrade supposing he should be grateful that there was, at least, a towel.
“I’m afraid not. You can talk to John, though, as soon as he’s out of the shower. Ah!” He spied his other shoe near his worktable and swooped down upon it. “Keep him here, would you?”
The dynamic was intriguing as well, though Sherlock recognized it from his dealings with Mycroft. Harry was positioning herself as John’s defender. She did care, then; her regular phone calls were more than obligation or mere nosiness. Yet John insisted they didn’t get on. Why?
“No,” said Irene with a rueful shake of her head. “There’s only one.” She shifted the bear to one arm and hooked John’s with her free hand. “Come on. Let’s go rescue the hospital staff from your boyfriend.”
John looked at the car again. It seemed like a remarkably bad choice for anyone trying to get around without drawing attention. Though John supposed Sherlock had not chosen the car with that particular feature, or lack thereof, in mind at the time.
Dr. Matthews’ lips twisted with something that might have been amusement as they stepped into the lift. “Explains his suit. Shit way to start a partnership, though, if you’ll forgive my being blunt.”
Moriarty turned, the lily in his right hand, and Sherlock saw his left arm was in a sling under his coat. “In my defense, he said not to kill you; he never said I couldn’t hurt you. And the doctor was fair game.”
Irene ignored him. “There they are!” She stood on her tiptoes—which didn’t do her much good, given how tiny she was and the fact that her heels already had her pitched about as high up as she could possibly go—and waved.
But for now, for today, it was right he should be there. He would ride out and visit Sherlock (he’d learned to ride because it was the fastest way to get around the area, particularly when the roads were mucked up from rain; he liked to think Sherlock would have been pleased), and then there was paperwork to be done for the Historical Heritage Committee that handled the house tours, a list of things to be addressed for the house’s upkeep, and there would almost certainly be at least one local emergency that would send someone riding to Weald House in need of the neighborhood doctor. Just the day before, little Nancy Bazelton had been bit by a dog and they’d brought her to John’s doorstep as if she might die of it, leaving him to wonder what they’d done before he lived there and while he was away.
There was no closing, just a signature written with such flourish that John couldn’t quite make it out. It seemed to start with a G or J. But whatever her name, it was clear the letter had come from Sherlock’s mother. Which meant there was a fair chance the return address was the same place Mycroft had sent Sherlock that morning.
Sherlock looked hard at his brother, trying to read the utter lack of expression on his face. “You always know the details.”
John felt his cheeks grow warm as Mycroft turned his level gaze on him. “You’re asking questions you already know the answers to, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, his tone laced with disappointment. “Think about what happened to Benjamin Markham and his friend and tell me: do you think the good doctor here is in danger?”
Mycroft looked back over his shoulder, understanding now that this was some kind of prank. But John had already pocketed the ring Irene had left in place of the bear, thus secreting the evidence.
As he considered his options, Sherlock idly scanned the flat, his eyes traveling over the familiar objects until they landed on something unfamiliar. A folded sort of notecard lay on the table where the tea tray had sat earlier, just one more piece of paper in a wide array of such things, but Sherlock was sure it hadn’t been there when he’d set the tray down before. So John
“We have to look at everything. You know that. But it would be better to start at the beginning. So if you could tell me . . .” Lestrade shifted his weight some more. “What happened between you and Whitcombe . . .”
“Really? Because I wasn’t in New York. That I know of.” This last had the tone of an afterthought, and John’s brow furrowed a little as if trying to decide if he’d missed something.
From a level or more up came the sound of footsteps and men shouting to one another. A few minutes later the alarm fell silent. The firemen would work their way through the building before letting anyone back inside, though Sherlock doubted they would go into the storage area. Human nature dictated that, in the absence of a persuasive reason to do something, a person was unlikely to bother doing anything. Ergo, unless they thought the storeroom was on fire, the fire brigade was unlikely to bother going in. People cut corners. Sherlock understood this to be fact.
“John,” said Sherlock, bending in attempt to gain eye contact as John’s attention appeared to be on his feet. With obvious effort, John brought his gaze up. “It’s going to get bad,” Sherlock told him with a pang of guilt. It had been selfish to bring John home, he realized; it was only fair to give him one more chance to change his mind.
“Don’t you?” John murmured, sliding his hand the rest of the way under Sherlock’s shirt and around him to draw him closer. His ‘examination’ was going rather well, John thought, until the door flew open.
“Fine, just let me . . .” Sherlock went to John’s room, opened the bedside table drawer and withdrew a box he’d noticed when looking for the gun the day before. Hesitated. Started to put it back, but then opened it and took out his father’s ring. He slipped it into his pocket and returned the box to the drawer.
“Oh, uh, thank you,” John replied absently. The three final candidates were lined up on the glass in front of him as he mentally weighed the pros and cons of each and tried to picture Sherlock wearing them.
Something was touching him, and every place on his body that came into contact with it (and that seemed to be everywhere) was painful. He tried to open his eyes for a better look, but his eyelids didn’t want to comply. So he tried to think instead, but his brain refused to pull together anything coherent.
“He told you,” John repeated flatly. “What? Over the phone?” But his tone made it clear that he knew better.
“Well you and Mycroft can split the difference now,” John said. “I’m sure between the two of you, he’ll be fine.”
“Jesus!” Lestrade exclaimed, pulling Sherlock back by the shoulder and holding him there. Charles had crumpled to the floor, his hand to his nose, though it did nothing to keep the copious amounts of blood from falling to the cream-colored carpet.
John, Mycroft, Mr. Watson, Harry and Irene—it was this quiet collective that ambled into the emergency room, Mycroft at the lead. But instead of going directly to the desk, Mycroft zeroed in on a man sitting in a corner of the mostly vacant waiting area. He stepped over to speak with him.
“You listen here, Missy,” Mr. Watson said in his low rumble. “You may be every kind of important where you work, but you don’t ever belittle your brother’s choice to serve his country. You understand?”
UPON HIS RETURN to room 367 the next morning, Sherlock stopped short in the doorway. Someone was there, kneeling beside the bed. A young man, with dark hair and (though Sherlock couldn’t see them, he knew) eyes, squarely built like a Roman gladiator.
He was cold again, but sweating. And it suddenly occurred to him that he wasn’t wearing a shirt. When had he taken his shirt off? He burrowed again, the covers now almost over his head, making it difficult to breathe.
After a sleepless night at Corring Hall, and a day spent making circles in their library while trying to keep up some semblance of polite chit-chat until it was time to get dressed and return to Weald House, John now stood in the drawing room, charged with nervous energy derived from the knowledge that Sherlock was somewhere nearby, and that it was almost time to see him. Harry had abandoned John the minute they’d stepped through the door (a night and day of his company being as much as she was willing to bear), and John had sent his parents away because they’d only made him more nervous. But now here was Irene, smiling and strangely calm, as if she had nothing to prove by having this whole affair go off smoothly.
John started to sit up, but the point of the cane planted itself firmly in John’s chest. “Stay there for the moment, if you would,” Moriarty requested. “Now,” he went on when it was clear John would not resist, “if you want to prevent me from opening his veins all over your bedspread, you’ll do as I say.”
“What, like don’t feed him after midnight and don’t get him wet?” John asked. Gerrie only looked confused, and John sighed. “He may have a concussion, so if he has a headache that won’t go away, or if his vision gets blurry or he stops making sense—more so than usual—you should take him to a hospital for examination. Have them check his ribs while he’s there.” He pushed past Gerrie to the stairs and tried to exit with dignity, though he was acutely aware his shoes were squelching the entire way.
“I don’t know,” answered Michael, his voice as shaky as his hands. “It doesn’t matter. I just—I need that.”
John turned from where he’d put the cans away and begun brewing tea. “Sorry?” he asked, too surprised to continue the brooding to which he’d been devoted.
With a huff of impatience, Sherlock abandoned that line of inquiry, though he was determined he would get answers for it sooner or later. “When was this?”
Eoin sulked for a moment longer before announcing with what John counted as far too much enthusiasm, “Well, your parents are on their way. And your sister, too.”
John bit back a stinging reply, and Sherlock continued, “Moriarty’s plan was that he would gain the artifact and the Martlets would get rid of me for him.”
Sitting next to the pitcher in a puddle of condensation was a band of brushed and antiqued gold trimmed in two tiny ribbons of platinum.
“Oh, absolutely.” He glanced again at Irene who was watching him now with a quizzical look on her face. “I have to go now, but I’ll be in touch again soon.” He ended the call before Lestrade could say anything more.
“Oh, I think I do.” Sherlock stepped back, belt in hand, and took his wine glass from the desk. Drained it. “Take off your shirt.”
Sherlock stopped and pegged her with a glare. “It has nothing to do with convenience. And there’s no wrath,” he added quietly, going back to reading the return address on the envelope he was holding.
John felt his throat tighten. He tossed the phone across the bed, not wanting to break it but not wanting to look at it either.
John finally looked over his shoulder at her. “I’m sorry, it’s just . . . I don’t see it, how the two of you can possibly get along.”
The three women turned their expectant gazes on Mycroft, who nodded. “I think John saved him. We’ll see what they say when we get to the hospital.”
“Sherlock, really. It’s just that my family, they have a sixth sense for . . . And you know what a terrible liar I am. I wouldn’t be able to hide it.”
THERE WAS ONLY one hour of daylight left by the time John found himself trudging up the stairs to the flat. He’d managed to keep his rising sense of distress at bay during the day by focusing on work and not stopping for lunch, but almost the minute he stepped outside the clinic, the dread began to encroach. And as the sun sank from the sky, John felt darkness creeping in around the edges of his sense of wellbeing.
“Well, the boy’s name isn’t in any of the paperwork, his being a minor and all. But the name of the person bringing charges . . .”
“They didn’t kill him right away,” Mycroft replied reasonably. “They at least waited until they could put his death to good use. Waste not, want not.”
Mycroft took a step toward his brother, menace crossing his features, but Moriarty whispered something that caused the elder Holmes to relax. “True,” Mycroft said thoughtfully, “very true.” He turned and left with no further protest, Moriarty a step behind.
“Until Jeremy comes with the car, yes,” said Sherlock. He was back in the closet, digging out John’s battered weekender. “They have a much nicer library than here.”
But Sherlock didn’t look. He only said, “Mm,” in an absent-minded sort of acknowledgement that he’d heard and recognized his name. And so John was left to wonder whether this was avoidance on Sherlock’s part, or if the moment really had passed.
“Not really, no.” He pulled the door open again, was halfway out of the room, but couldn’t do it. Shaking his head and cursing his own curiosity, John asked, “Okay,
“No, really, I . . .” Feeling as if he couldn’t catch his breath, John turned away from the bedroom and began moving toward the door.
And now John caught a glimpse of a handsome and well-dressed man, someone he’d seen before somewhere . . . In a magazine, maybe? Yes, the man was in print ads for some high-end fashion label, he was suddenly sure of it. “Who is that?” he wondered aloud.
And then some time in the early morning of the fifth day, John became still. It was this stillness, and the quiet that accompanied it, that woke Sherlock.
“This is because of your friend, the one that was here,” said Eoin. “He told me you used to live together.”
“Mum? I think Pharaoh—” Sherlock appeared in the doorway and froze, his eyes moving between his mother, her hand still on John’s arm, and his flatmate. “What are you doing here?”
Almost immediately he felt his knees turn to rubber, threatening to drop him. But Sherlock put his hands on John’s shoulders to brace him. “The world is going to feel a little skewwhiff for a while,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock reached up as if to touch John’s cheek but John flinched as if threatened by something hot.
Sherlock sighed and reached for the blankets, tucking all save one around John. The last one he wrapped himself in, almost as if girding himself, before lying down in wait for what was coming.
John pulled the car up to the gap and, yes, there was an unpaved drive leading away and down toward a stand of trees. He didn’t realize just how large a stand until he got closer.
“John. Son,” Mr. Watson said, low and quiet, “He doesn’t know the difference right now. Save your strength for when it’ll be worth something.”
“Well then,” Sherlock said, pulling him close again, “why don’t you make sure whatever I’ve come down with isn’t catching?”
If there was any conversation of note, John missed it. He concentrated on his meal (which was very good) and listened to the steady stream of Gerrie’s chatter, making vague remarks at what he hoped were the appropriate moments. At some point he found a dessert plate of bread and butter pudding in front of him, though he couldn’t remember how it got there.
Eventually she sat back, evidently satisfied. “I’ll clean up in here,” she said, rising, “and you go find Sherlock before he gets into a mood.”
A growing sense of dread began to wash over Sherlock. It was one thing to have a clever and worthy opponent. It was another entirely to deal with someone who had stepped over the edge of reason.
“I was just—” John began, prepared to explain he’d been on his way to help Sherlock, but Mycroft was already gone.
“John.” Sherlock made the name sound heavy, like a cement block being hefted onto a table. “You are the only person I’ve ever met who openly admires my talents and doesn’t think I’m a complete ass.”
She leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek. “Get some rest. I know it must feel like you’ve been in bed forever, but you don’t want to overdo it by taking on too much too soon.”
, John thought. What would he do at the flat except fixate on what he’d seen, or rather what he’d tried very hard not to see?
Charles set the glass back on the tray and put a hand on the back of John’s neck, giving it a gentle squeeze. “Better?”
Tamzen foraged into the densely packed racks of clothing and returned with a brown tweed suit replete with leather patches at the suit coat’s elbows.
It wasn’t immediately clear to Sherlock that John had meant him, and even Mrs. Grossman and Mrs. Watson were looking at John expectantly.
“Are you going on a honeymoon?” Irene had asked, and Sherlock and John had exchanged a glance before declaring, “No!”
Lestrade looked as if he were contemplating further argument, but all at once he turned on his heel and started for the door. “Meet me out front in five minutes.”
“Sherl doesn’t like to think about how he feels; it’s sort of a waste of his time or brain or whatever. So I do that for him.”
“It doesn’t take immediate effect,” said John, choosing to remain in the doorway, even though the bodies were gone. “They could have mixed it with their tea and put the cups away before lying down.”
“I don’t know. I’m not a consulting detective.” John came to a sudden stop. “You know, I’m not sure if you follow trouble or if trouble follows you.”
Sherlock tried to counteract the surge of adrenaline by closing his eyes and breathing deeply, and it almost worked—until Christopher made good on his threat.
This went a long way in showing John just how little Eoin did know him; Sherlock would have known better than to call his parents, in part to keep from worrying them, and in much larger part to keep them from calling Harry.
Sherlock opened the bag and meant to go straight to the bottom, the most likely place for the gun to be given its weight. But he paused when he touched something smooth and cool, roughly the size of a book though not as thick. Extracting it, he found a framed photo of himself, taken during a beach holiday when he was eight. Sherlock’s mother had left the picture for John, but John had indicated to Sherlock he didn’t want it. So why was it in John’s bag?
It dawned on John what they must have been talking about, and for a split second he thought maybe he should leave after all. But Lestrade was already carrying on, though he darted glances in John’s direction regularly. “It went on for . . .?”
Sherlock watched warily. “You’ll be suggesting we use her bed next. How much have you had?” he asked, gesturing to Christopher’s wine glass.
Sherlock huffed with impatience. “Why on earth would I know where your dog is, Henry? And what’s more, why should I care?”
“He spent every possible minute in here,” Mrs. Hudson went on. “He was determined that you not wake up and think you were alone.”
Sherlock glanced up. “Christ, John, go put on a shirt.” Then he froze and his gaze went back to the disc John held. “Where did that come from?”
“I need to speak to you first,” Lestrade replied. “And I think his girlfriend here might like a turn to visit him in any case.”
“No. Your hands are cold.” Sherlock realized he sounded more severe than he intended, but past experience had taught him anger was an effective defense.
Daisy’s dark eyes flicked toward John, as if to assess the truth of Sherlock’s words. She evidently found them credible because she wasted no time pulling together two full plates of eggs, toast and sausage along with two mugs of tea. “Probably not eating proper at your place,” she said as she set the drinks down.
IT WAS EARLY yet, the edges of the sky slowly turning from pearl grey to blue in advance of what looked to be a lovely April day. That was how John saw it, staring out the window of the cab. He wondered if Sherlock ever noticed these things? But asking was likely only to earn him disparagement.
He learned to doze while lying on the edge of the mattress as though balanced on a razor blade, and through the equivalent of a tantrum.
“Of course. I’ve got better things to do than run after you.” But that wasn’t exactly true, was it? And the memory of Sherlock staring at a blank wall, the idea of not knowing where he was or whether he was really, truly all right . . . Would John have left it alone? Maybe for a day, he told himself. Even two. But he knew that, somewhere between boredom and worry, he’d have been moved to try finding Sherlock eventually. Mycroft had only sped up the inevitable.
“Come on, then,” his sister prodded. “Every second must feel like an eternity out there.” When John continued to hesitate, Harry asked, “You having second thoughts, Johnny?”
Sherlock turned in a circle, made a decision. “Come on, John. We need to go back to Markham’s flat.”
But Sherlock had caught on. “You can’t be all that upset about it, or you wouldn’t have told me about Eoin either.”
“And ‘Martlet’ is almost an anagram of ‘Templar,’” John pointed out, “if you change the ‘p’ to a ‘t.’”
He was drifting in that dreamy space between asleep and awake, watching vivid colors roll like a tide behind his eyelids. He was basking in brilliant blue and yellow and thinking of summer on a beach when a voice whispered in his ear, “John? How are you feeling?”
Sherlock had disappeared into what seemed to be a huge closet. “I don’t think there’s anything to be curious about. Mycroft would have known you’d need . . .” He didn’t finish the thought.
Sarah searched his face, trying to read into his words, but she came up empty; Sherlock’s face betrayed nothing.
“What? No,” said Sherlock. “Though that last one comes close.” He refolded the letter and slid it back into the envelope. “Get dressed, if you intend to come along.”
“It wasn’t me,” Sherlock informed her. They’d reached the flat and he waved a hand in the general direction of the sofa as an invitation to sit. But Irene was avidly looking around.
But now the man was leaning in as if to speak to John after all. “Not that I have any particular love for you,” he said. “But! Today the role of Sherlock’s heart is played by John Watson, and I intend to make good on my threat.”
But if that were strictly true, he should also chuck the ring he’d taken from the downstairs table. And he had no intention of doing that.
Mycroft blinked at John a couple of times before John had the sense to step back and out of his way. As he entered, Mycroft held out a set of car keys, though it took John a minute to realize he was supposed to take them. “I’ve had Sherlock’s car sent up like he asked. Changed the plates to be safe. But if you value your life, I suggest you find a way to get him to let you drive.”
He sat on the other edge of the bed and glowered at it. He should go find Sherlock. Or what if one of the other texts was from Sherlock? But he knew deep down they weren’t.
“No, I imagine not.” A thought pierced the fog clouding John’s brain. “You seem to know a lot about it.”
“We can’t keep landing in hospitals,” said John. “This was fun, you know, when we started. And I’m still amazed by you, what you can do . . . But I can’t spend all my time worrying, not if, but when you’ll next get hurt, or worse.”
Tamzen pulled Jonah over to let Demetria out of the booth. “Her show’s really good,” said Tamzen as the drag queen stalked off, stopping now and again to chat with people in the crowd.
John hadn’t realized he’d been holding his breath until they stepped out the kitchen door. He took in a deep lungful of fresh air and tried to relax as he followed Sherlock along the gravel walk that cut across the expanse of green that led to the pond. The pond itself was crowded by more of the trees that stood around the house; when they filled out for spring and summer, John suspected the water would be almost completely hidden. As it was, the trees had begun to leaf, but John could still make out a structure that he assumed was some kind of boathouse.
John had thought being alone would be better than having other people bothering him, but now that he was alone, he wished he weren’t. He blinked at the room around him, so white and familiar, though it wasn’t one he ever spent any amount of time in. It was a formal room, a staging area, the first stop on the tour. Being there alone made John feel impermanent and forgotten.
“To hell with Elyse,” growled John. “She either sank or she swam.” He ushered Sherlock through the house and, with more effort, up the stairs to Sherlock’s room where John sat him on the edge of the bed, tossed off the jacket, and began unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt.
“No . . .” But what set John off was how Sherlock actually looked at the door as if considering the option.
He rose and was pleased to find that he could stand without the room swaying around him or his legs threatening to give way. Walking was still a bit of a challenge, however, since each step caused everything to appear to move too fast. But John didn’t feel he could stand being left alone with his thoughts much longer, so he pushed on and eventually made it to his bedroom door.
Irene rewarded him with a smile. “Irene Adler. And this is Sherlock Holmes,” she added, looping her arm through Sherlock’s.
My least favorite scene in the entire series, so apologies in advance for some of the cringe-worthiness. I'd remove it entirely, but there is underlying plot structure here.
Sherlock pulled another loose sheet free, glanced at it, cast it aside. “We could be out of here faster if you’d help.”
Sarah saw she was dismissed and stood. “All right then,” she said. She paused at the door. “If you decide you want to talk . . .”
either. I can probably count on one hand the number of words you’ve said to her at dinner the past few nights.”
Lestrade’s eyes went from Sherlock to John and back again, but he didn’t miss a beat. “What, Markham liked the looks of Lumley’s pastries? From everything we’ve heard, it’s out of character for him.”
“No, no, no,” Sherlock said as he sensed John was slipping. He wanted to gather John into his arms but was afraid to move him any more than he already had. “Blanket,” he muttered, but he was reluctant to leave even for the few seconds it would take him to go fetch one. He took one of John’s hands—it seemed impossibly cold—and looked into his face. The eyes were losing focus, as if awareness was being siphoned off into the ether. “Stay with me,” Sherlock said again. “I need you with me.”
The look Sherlock threw him was a mixture of anger and sorrow. “I realize it can’t mean much to you—”
She brought out a large silver hoop with many smaller rings of various sizes looped onto it and neatly selected one of them, which she slid onto John’s right ring finger. It fit almost perfectly. “So if you’re a . . .” Her voice trailed as she removed the ring and studied it as if reading something. “Then he’s maybe . . .?” She held up another ring for John’s inspection.
“I’m sorry you think I’m that superficial,” said Sherlock, without bitterness, but instead sounding honestly aggrieved.
John followed Sherlock down the hall to what proved to be a very spacious but sparsely furnished room. There was a wrought iron bed covered in russet-hued satin, a chair and ottoman done in a striped brocade, and a tall chest-of-drawers with a matching bedside table. The one tall window was covered by rust-colored curtains trimmed in gold. A partially open door revealed an en suite bathroom gleaming with marble.
John sensed the tears were threatening to spill again, so he left it at that, gently sending Elyse on her way. Not long after, Jeremy reappeared driving a cart that was pulled by a dappled grey pony.
“I could hardly believe it when I ran into Irene,” said Christopher. “She hasn’t been over in ages. Want something from the minibar?”
John had never wished more that he had his gun with him than in that moment, and he privately vowed to start carrying it regularly.
John thought about how Elyse had stayed away from her brother’s body. And how the dogs had stayed between her and the body. They’d been watching
“The chicken is a little hot. I don’t know about the lamb; you’re the one who ordered it. You should eat it before it gets cold,” John added, hoping to nip a future tantrum in the bud.
John had drawn closer and was frowning thoughtfully at the page in his flatmate’s hand. “That’s a martlet?”
Sherlock gave him a strange look, remarkably similar to the ones Mycroft sometimes threw at him. But all he said was, “Phone?”
He supposed Sherlock might be ignoring his calls as well as Mycroft’s. After all, they hadn’t parted on the best of terms. Or it was possible Sherlock was simply unable to answer his phone at the moment. In any case, John didn’t relish calling Mycroft with the news. He tried Sherlock’s number a third time, but the result was the same.
“Sally! Of course. How remiss of me,” Mrs. Hudson grabbed Sherlock’s sleeve and dragged him forward. “Soo-Lin Yao, this is Sherlock Holmes. His mother is a friend of mine, and he’s a botanist.”
“Looks like Stamford’ll be late, so let’s get started. Unless you’re going to gas all day, lads, and then eat me out of house and home anyway?” Lestrade laughed, though the laugh didn’t reach his eyes. John thought he saw Lyons wince.
"Sherlock is very resourceful, when he chooses to be. If he does not choose to be, you have my full permission to leave him to suffer the consequences of his actions."
It hadn’t snowed that day, thank fuck, John thought, as he pushed open his front door that evening. He did, however, feel a little apprehensive about the challenge. Sherlock had appealed to his competitive instincts, but he still wasn’t looking forward to blue balls for the better part of three weeks.
Sherlock took his time, exploring every inch, every vein. John felt the tide of his pleasure rise at the slightest of movements. His hips were rocking up, and Sherlock began to bob his head.
“And breathing strawberries is a poor way to get the vitamins. Also, they would obstruct the lungs.”
John looked around. There wasn’t much of a clearing, but being surrounded by bushes meant that they’d hear any dangerous approach. He swung the rifle off his shoulder and sat. Sherlock followed suit, his long legs folding gracefully, and he smiled at John, a little shyly. John looked closely at his face, taking in each angle, marveling at his eyes, not any definite colour but somehow all colours. He kissed him again, suddenly, relishing the little jump of surprise before the wholehearted melting of their lips together.
“When was the last time you had sexual congress?" John interrupted. Let Sherlock have a turn being the target of an embarrassing discussion.
I’m not sorry about the Lestrade/Lyons tension. NOT SORRY. And I don’t know why I never thought of shipping Sarah and Soo-Lin before. They are GREAT together. Please take it as read that Sally and Stamford eventually hook up, too.
“Make clean piles,” John called, knowing it was futile, and slung his axe over his shoulder. He turned towards the bush and began clearing some smaller trees away.
Warning for Sherlock feeling ashamed of his desire in the latter part of the chapter. Tags are updated through Chapter 12.
Thank you all for your patience. I'm working 50+ hour weeks this semester and I don't really remember how September went. From now on, I am going to go to a monthly update schedule. It's not ideal, but it's what I can guarantee. I'll do my best to update more frequently than that.
John, meanwhile, had made it to the street only to realize that he really had very little idea of where he was. He tried to remember how they’d managed the walk home the day before. He’d gone left initially, but then Sherlock had taken him back past Markham’s flat, so he should go right this time.
Modern hospital beds had been designed to accommodate people much larger than Sherlock Holmes, and John found himself thinking three of his lover could easily fit, maybe even four if they lay on their sides, the upshot being that Sherlock appeared strangely small in the sea of hospital white that surrounded him.
John blushed and looked away. “Will you be all right barefoot, or should I run out and fetch your shoes?”
As Sherlock began to gather the energy to fling him, John stopped struggling suddenly and made himself dead weight. It was enough of a shock that his body dropped down into the water a little. Then, John hooked his free leg behind Sherlock’s and, with his free arm, pushed against the water and surged towards him. Sherlock’s stance was not stable enough to withstand the force, and he fell backwards.
Sherlock squeaked. There was no other word for it, a high-pitched noise that must have originated in the base of his belly.
John was surprised to wake before Sherlock the next morning. He looked for Sherlock’s boots, in case he’d gone out to the garden. No, there they were by the door, obnoxiously large and still shiny, despite nearly a month of backwoods living. How did Sherlock do it? He’d never seen him cleaning the damn things, and nobody else was there to do it.
If you’re wondering if this was partly inspired by that ridiculous/hot reddit thread about the dude who discovered prostate stimulation, then YES yes it was. I know it’s been done with Sherlock fic but it was so hot that I still had to make this happen.
“Very well, Sherlock, you’re a genius with poultry,” he said, and watched Sherlock’s broad smile become broader.
John has a dangerous mystery, a moribund squirrel, and a neglected potato patch on his hands. What he doesn’t need is an argumentative, insubordinate Sherlock as well...but that’s what he’s got.
“We can go today.” he said, “There’s no use hoeing; the ground’s heavy as can be. I thought I’d walk the perimeter of the property and mark out this summer’s clearing.”
John stood waist-deep in the water and watched Sherlock stalk into the cabin, doubtless ashamed of his visible arousal. John himself was surprised—not to say a little pleased—that he himself had not felt any undue sexual excitement. A little frisson, certainly, but not the full-blown hunger he had felt before. He had relieved his own needs behind the shanty recently enough (Sherlock had been safely absorbed in compounding violet jelly), so clearly his control was improving. He straightened his back. He might yet make it to September unscathed.
Sherlock frowned, then stepped forward to sniff him. John drew back, but not before he got a lungful of Sherlock’s odour. “And so do you. Pondwards, now.”
He licked his lips, wanting to take it in his mouth but not wanting to push Sherlock beyond his limits. He wanted to see Sherlock spend, too, to watch the creamy jet of spunk shoot out onto his pale belly.
John’s kiss was more insistent now, his tongue sliding along Sherlock’s. Sherlock could scarcely tell where he ended and John began, and it was overwhelming in the most delicious way. Sherlock’s hands tightened low on John’s waist; the curve of his hip flexors was evident even under the bunched cotton of his work shirt. And oh, delight! John’s hands had settled at Sherlock’s waist, the tips of his fingers brushing the top of Sherlock’s arse, the palms pressing and steadying him.
"I meant to tell you myself to-night.  And now that old absurdity of Widow Turner has told you--brutally I suppose--and hurt you dreadfully.”
Well, perhaps, he thought, remembering the long sweep of Sherlock’s pale, cold body. A feeling of dread unrelated to marauding bears, and entirely related to his visit to Mrs. Hudson’s descended upon him. Her prescience in the face of any kind of romantic or sexual entanglement was frankly unnerving. He steeled himself as he pulled into her yard.
“Our commander. Strict, but good. He walked the line between duty and compassion better than anyone I’ve ever known. The betrayal of our regiment finished him.”
“You want this?” John whispered, and Sherlock nodded frantically, burying his nose in John’s hair. “This is what you’d get.”
Soon, Sherlock’s world had shrunk to watching John’s feet and imitating his steps, one after the other. He was cold, colder than he thought possible. His ankle had begun to ache, but he squared his shoulders and modulated his breathing. John must not know that he was cold and sore. He would take five more steps. At the end of those five, he would take five more. The rain might not end, but their march would. Five more steps.
“Tea, Sherlock,” he said.  No response. He had joked, last week, that all it took was the word “tea” to wake Sherlock from a deep slumber. He had complained, actually, because his teapot was too small for more than two cups, and he’d missed having two to himself. Today, he wished that his complaint were true; he’d give so much, he thought, to have Sherlock sit up and beckon imperiously. He set the cup on his trunk and shook Sherlock. Still no response.
"Then we are finished," Mycroft Holmes said, in a pleasant tone, and held out his hand. The corner of his mouth twitched, and John knew that Holmes expected a refusal.
John watched Sherlock bang around the kitchen. He was clearly doing his best to suppress his agitation, but it was pervasive; in fact, his condition appeared to have worsened over the course of the afternoon. Anger—never far—surged through John. Why would the daft bastard not accede to his body’s demands? First the hypothermia, and now this! He was the most stubborn man John had ever met.
“You think so because you've never seen the bottom,” John said, “but about ten yards down this side, the trees peter out, and all there is left is broken rock. Richards’ Brook turns into a waterfall just to the west there, and it’d be a hard landing. Also, there are bears at the bottom-they like the caves at the base of the cliffs.”
Something I didn't learn about in this chapter was what large mummified dogs look like. They really do mummify, and they're really freaking creepy. This note brought to you by having discovered [weird, gross details ahead] the mummified head of a dog in a sandpit one time. [/weird, gross details]
This fic almost had a pair of kittens (called Bonny and Shih, for Anne Bonny and Ching Shih, famous pirates) but I sadly cut it out because I knew it would add probably 5k to the fic—Sherlock baby-talking kittens (“They’re animals, John, it’s quite all right”), John being reluctantly charmed by kittens (Imagine Sherlock seeing them curled up on John’s shoulders at night), Harry and Clara befriending the kittens (both of them can ride on Harry’s back when she’s pregnant), etc.
John pursed his mouth. He didn’t need to read the text to suspect what the topic of this pamphlet was. The word “prostate” caught his eye and he quickly turned the sheet over in case passersby saw him holding it. But the other side was no better. John’s ears burned when he saw the sketch of a long cylindrical object and the large words “PROSTATE MASSAGER” below it. Someone had underlined “A Cure for the Refractory Young Man” in purple ink. Exhaling gustily, he crumpled up the paper, cursing Mycroft Holmes under his breath.
“Then she was happy about it, John.” Sherlock could see it, though he didn’t understand it—he wanted John to himself—but that Mary had wanted to share John was certain.
"Sherlock!" John practically flung his rifle to the ground and ran to him and pulled him close. "What in the almighty hell did you just do?"
A thump and a rustle seemed to indicate her agreement—or was it her desire to eat the handful of summer hay he had grasped to wipe the wall?
Supper was, of course, salt pork and potatoes, with some of the early wild cucumber that Sherlock had gathered to stave off scurvy. John ate without tasting, though, still slightly preoccupied with his discomfort at the human scat in the woods.  Sherlock ate the potatoes and cucumber, but only pushed the salt pork around. Eventually, John speared it with his fork and put it on his own plate. He was hungry, at least.
“I…I will,” Sherlock said, “but may I please stay?” John looked at him searchingly. “Geese,” Sherlock said, and waved his hands. Gratified by the tenor of his apology, and pleased to notice that there were goose droppings on the back of that pristine coat, John relented.
Re: smoking gross things you dry in the woods—what, you’ve never done that? I don’t even smoke and I used to try and make tobacco with all sorts of weird forest greenery.
But wait—there! Clara had jumped to avoid the flock of chickens and her deviation was carrying her towards the manure pile. If she got stuck…Sherlock lengthened his stride a little further. His muscles groaned.
Sherlock burned with curiosity—at last, they were getting to the mysterious Sholto—but he let John continue.
“Quite,” Sherlock said, his expression unreadable. John flexed his hand, uncomfortable. He leaped up.
"I see," Sherlock laughed. "I find I want to watch you dress the bear, but I think perhaps we could resume this stimulating little mise en scène afterwards.”
“See here. The rules are simple and you will listen to them. The first: do not get yourself killed or seriously injured. The second: do not make more work for me. I've got enough to do. Break these," John fixed Sherlock with the glare that had made many subalterns wish they were somewhere else, "and I ship you back to where you will have many more rules than this."
“My answer is verbal: my brother can keep his great nose out of my business. Tell his courier that.”
Speaking of…Sherlock looked around for the boy. He’d leaped from the wagon when Molly had descended but had not stayed nearby to be introduced. There! He was watching John work, now—jumping forward to heft a log onto the pile. Was it an effort in good faith? The log was well beyond his strength, and predictably John stepped up and tossed it into place with seemingly no effort. The boy nodded abashedly, moving back into the shadow of Lestrade’s shed.
“Nice...well, it’s home. But despite being a well-run farm, young lad, there are hundreds of magic places, where if you turn, just right, you can still see fairies.”
Sherlock was surprised at himself. He felt clear-minded, which was not unusual, but also calm, which was. He could not have imagined feeling this way before, and he liked it. There was no niggling fear of losing his edge; he seemed to have no edges. He still did not have a full picture of what was happening, but a conversation with John would help. John was no genius, but he had a faculty for inspiring it in others--in him. He was not a bright light, but a conductor of light.
Distance, then, was the only way. He needed a clear space in which to think and prepare for whatever would happen when Sherlock returned, assuming he did. And so the first point of business: move out of Baker Street.
“I know,” Irene said again. “But he’s not indifferent, John. It does matter to him. Sherl just—he can’t talk about things that matter. He doesn’t know how.”
Having composed herself, Irene had turned around, and though she was smiling, there was tightness around her eyes that gave away her apprehension. “I should go,” she said, too brightly, as she rose from the chair. “Someone has to babysit Mycroft, after all.”
Harry and Irene both looked toward the door, but Sherlock kept his eyes on John, who gave a small sigh and shut his lids once more.
“Is there something to dip it in?” Sherlock asked when John handed him a fresh plate of naan, and the detective appeared surprised when John groaned aloud. Before Sherlock could ask what was wrong, the door opened and Mycroft stepped in, looking for all the world like a sovereign on a state visit.
“Oh, don’t start,” said John, stepping the rest of the way into the room and closing the door behind him. He dropped onto the bed next to Sherlock. “What, are you going to skip meals for the next two weeks?”
John towed Sherlock to the margin of the pond and laid him on his back in the mud beside the water. “Come on,” he hissed through gritted teeth as he checked Sherlock’s pulse, which was rapid but steady, and watched for breathing.
Sherlock couldn’t wish on John any permutation of the eight days he’d spent in his room at Mycroft’s flat during his own rehabilitation. But he also didn’t want John to suffer in a strange place. And deciding that John was smart enough to understand what lay in store—that he knew and wanted to go home anyway—Sherlock slipped an arm under his flatmate and helped him to sit up.
“Anything. Everything. John has a loyal heart; I don’t want this to be because he feels he owes it to me. Worse, he has a soft spot for people he thinks need him, a category I apparently fall into. And I’m not interested in being a charity project.”
John passed through the closet to the green guest room and stopped to pull his wet and muddy socks off his feet before going back down to the kitchen in search of his bag. He found Gerrie still staring out the window at the pond and was prepared to ignore her, but as he was grabbing his traveler, he thought to ask, “Do you have a first aid kit?”
“She would have loved that,” said Sherlock. “Would have suited her sense of drama. But what does any of that have to do with this?”
“Not just a dog! One of my leaders!” Henry halted long enough to cock an eye in John’s direction. “Who’re you?”
John stretched, languid and lazy as a feline, using up the last bit of energy he had. He allowed his eyes to open a bit, just enough to see the man leaning over him.
“Yes, well, he’s got work and so have I, so you might do better trying him when he gets back,” said John. He didn’t like the sense that he was being rude, but he still felt nettled by Sherlock’s behavior that morning, and Lestrade’s inquiry—or lack of it—was making him uncomfortable besides. John knew he was terrible at lying, and if cornered he might say something that gave everything away.
John waited a few minutes, giving Elyse and Sherlock time to get outside before going for his bag and shoes. When he finally went into the kitchen, Gerrie was standing at the windows by the table. “What are they doing?” she asked.
Or maybe he did, but it was more in anger than worry. John began to wonder why he bothered helping Sherlock at all when it only resulted in trouble. For someone so self-possessed, the man was a walking disaster, particularly for anyone standing too near. Not for the first time in the past five days, John silently resolved to have as little to do with whatever was going on as possible. Why he had felt the need to insert himself this evening he couldn’t imagine.
“Well, your last playmate was clearly serious,” said Christopher with a nod at what remained of the cut on Sherlock’s temple. “Courtesy of your flatmate? There’s something to be said for having someone who can stitch you up when you’re done. You never would have let me go that far.”
“Stop! Just stop!” Lestrade was shouting. He was directly in front of Sherlock now, utilizing all his strength to keep Sherlock away from Charles. It struck the inspector that he’d never seen Sherlock this angry, or angry at all for that matter. Didn’t the man have a middle ground? There had to be something between dispassionate and homicidal, didn’t there?
“Oh, and will there be another time?” John asked. “Should I mark two years from now in my datebook?”
In his defensiveness, John forgot to be afraid and finally opened his eyes. “I thought I might need it to find you this morning.”
“What, are you falling asleep on me?” Harry demanded as John’s lids threatened to close. “After I came all this way?”
John felt a flare of irritation that he quickly squelched under the reminder that this poor woman was having possibly the worst day of her life. Against his better judgment, John picked up the gun and held it up.
Moriarty smiled coldly. “I’m sure the idea makes you feel better. But don’t count any chickens yet. I, for one, would be quite satisfied to see how much losing John would pain him. I’ve always been a romantic that way.” He placed a hand on John’s forehead. “Burning yet?”
There came a grinding kind of sound that it took John a minute to recognize as a low sort of moaning. Another minute passed before he understood it was coming from him. He swallowed hard against it to make it stop.
Sherlock held his brother’s gaze for what seemed like a long time, and for a moment John thought Sherlock might actually tell Mycroft the whole story. But all Sherlock said was, “I haven’t needed you to protect me since I was three, and that was from the neighbor’s dog.”
John stepped back, throwing off the support of his flatmate’s grip. This did get Sherlock’s attention. “John?”
“It’s more like an exponential thing,” John ventured uncertainly, and Sherlock’s expression sharpened with interest. “The more you care about someone, the more capable they are of upsetting you,” John went on. “If you didn’t care, the . . . factor?” He darted a glance at Irene, who nodded enthusiastically. “Would be zero, so . . .”
If Sherlock had slapped him, John couldn’t have appeared any more stunned. “I didn’t know she was home,” he finally answered.
“Oh, he’s perfectly lovely, really. A bit jealous of his privacy,” she added with a meaningful look.
John suppressed a flare of irritation. It was well enough for Sherlock to say “whatever,” but if John really did order “whatever” he would never hear the end of how he’d ordered the wrong thing. So now he said, “Write it down.”
“What did she do to upset you this much?” John asked. “Is it the Christopher thing? I know that was poor judgment on her part, but—”
Gun. He needed John’s gun. It seemed unlikely that John carried it with him regularly any more, so it would almost certainly be in his room somewhere. Sherlock checked the bedside table drawer first but wasn’t terribly surprised to come up empty.
Lestrade nodded, and they sat there for some time, Sherlock seemingly having lost interest in the other people who occupied the waiting area, instead focusing on an invisible point on the floor roughly a meter in front of his shoes. An inestimable time later, a doctor pushed through the access doors, went to the desk, and after talking to the receptionist there, he looked to Lestrade and caught his eye.
And then he wanted the thing brought to a suite at the Ritz? Really? And what was Sherlock doing there, exactly? The whole thing was ridiculous.
“Problem with your phone, Doctor?” Lestrade asked now, unable to fully understand the conversation he’d just witnessed.
The knot inside Sherlock eased somewhat. Assuming the photo was a representation of the relationship as a whole, it indicated more tolerance on John’s part than passion.
A branch cracked.  He straightened his spine and looked about; he wished he had brought his rifle. Was that movement or wind? Probably nothing.
"Farming requires a great deal of brainpower. Now, will you help? The horses need watering.” John held Arthur’s lead rope out to Sherlock, but Sherlock did not take it. In fact, neither Arthur nor Sherlock appeared to wish to be any closer together than they already were; Arthur's ears were straight back and Sherlock was wearing an expression of studied nonchalance. John grinned to himself, contrasting Sherlock's fluid physical grace when on foot with his sack-of-potatoes demeanour on horseback.
“You don’t smell like a public convenience. Nor do I, come to think of it, but it’s true that the alkalinity of the goose droppings bring it closer to that particular smell.”
“Whoa, boy.” Arthur was not a nervous horse, but he was reluctant to slow; when he finally did stop at John’s command, he stood shifting uncomfortably.
Sherlock swallowed. John could see a glistening in the corner of his eyes but said nothing further, waiting for Sherlock to speak.
They found very little in the woods, though Sherlock was inordinately thorough. Even the few tracks left by the mysterious woman told them only what they knew already: that she was small and quick, and accompanied by a bear. John’s feeling of unease had lifted but he stayed alert, his rifle at the ready.
They’d only just arrived at what appeared to be the cheapest caravan park in Dorset, and already John Watson hated the caravan, the town, summer, and Sherlock Holmes. For a pound he’d return to London where he could at least have shut out the sun, serial arsonists or no.
“Possibly,” Cousin Mike replied, his brown eyes twinkling, and that was all he would say until Uncle Gregory and Great-Aunt Martha returned.
"John," Sherlock said seriously, "You can always retain my interest." He bit John's ear, and then his neck. Electric sparks ricocheted down John's spine to his cock, and he felt himself dripping onto Sherlock's hand.
They slid down in the bed, Sherlock slightly above John now. John pulled him closer, winding one leg around him to bring their bodies together. The full contact made him gasp. Sherlock pulled back to look into his eyes.
“Not tomorrow, nor the day after, nor Sunday. Monday will be Lestrade’s working bee. Just about everyone will be there.”
“Ready?” John’s voice was softer than usual—the drink, most likely, but something else as well. Suddenly, Sherlock wished he could see his face in the light.
In fact, Greg Lestrade had been quite torn over where to put this strange, serious boy. He could not have given him his sister Juliet’s room, though she had been the boy’s mother. There was something too bitter yet about it, and it didn’t seem right somehow. He didn’t want to wish the legacy of Lestrade pride on John; Juliet had had it and it had chafed and hurt her, and she had kicked the traces. He himself had kept within them but at a price.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, John, it is raining outdoors.” Sherlock’s snide tone grated over John’s strained nerves.
Stephen Rinella’s hunting ethic is one of the least problematic out there: he believes in hunting for meat only and he’s careful about how he goes about it (on foot, knowing the area, etc).
Could he? He recalled the embarrassment that John had displayed in asking him about his sexual proclivities. There was something that went beyond a natural reticence to discuss those parts that were undiscussable in polite company, and, truth be told, this mystified Sherlock more than anything. John did not seem to be overly modest of his person, and he had been in the army. That, in addition to his medical training, meant that he would logically be less reluctant to discuss even the most private of—here, Sherlock shuddered at the memory—“urges.” What might motivate such reluctance?
“The rain has been good for these, at least,” John said, pulling half a dozen juicy berries off a bush.
"Awful," John replied, but he wasn't so sure he meant it. The man’s manners were off-putting, but since it absolved him of any pretense at social niceties, it was something a relief, all told.
“It’s all right, dear. It sometimes catches people this way. Why don’t you go inside and make some tea?”
He almost changed his mind when he got into the woods at the correct coordinates and realized that there was still a significant layer of snow upon the ground: rotten snow, which did not hold his weight, but made him flounder ungracefully and painfully. Despite his soaked trousers, however, he was unwillingnto return to the farm clearing; instead, he persevered, slowly, noting humps that could be stone ridges and depressions that could be swamps.
"My brother, as usual, has minimized my scientific interests, which are diverse," said Sherlock with disgust. "He wishes I would write a monograph on medicinal plants, which, I tell you frankly, is almost enough to keep me from doing so. However, I am fully convinced that such a monograph would be profoundly useful, and so I persevere, despite constant familial setbacks."
Sarah glanced at the clock on the wall. “Not at all. You’re a bit early, in fact, but we could use the help. We’re backed up already, but with you here maybe we can catch up.” She was hedging, trying to remain professional and upbeat, although curiosity was gnawing at her.
John started to chuckle at the idea of Eoin trying to stop Sherlock from doing whatever it was he had it in mind to do, then sucked in a breath at the pain. “He didn’t bother me.”
Sherlock pushed back from the table and stood, and John moved to follow suit. Mycroft handed the letter back to his brother and said, “You won’t find them online anywhere. They’re older than that.”
So the Fourth of May—and he always thought of it that way, in capitals, rather like the Ides of March—was really nothing more than the exit wound from a bullet that had taken ten days to pass through his body. And John had a history of surviving bullet wounds.
John wondered. But he supposed they would deal with it when it happened, in typical Sherlockian fashion.
remember; you remember everything.” He pulled the card from his suit pocket, walked over and handed it to Sherlock.
The cool, fresh air served to sober them a little, and they walked in charitable silence. John was surprised when Sherlock took his hand (Sherlock not being prone to overt forms of affection), but he decided to simply enjoy the novelty instead of questioning it.
Tossing his phone back onto the floor, John rolled closer to the warm body beside him and slipped back into sleep.
Still, dressed in his royal blue silk pajamas and standing at John’s bedroom door, Sherlock hesitated. It was one thing to think of John as a line on his to-do list, but something else again to, well, do it. Him. No, it.
Her eyes darted desperately to John, but he clearly wasn’t comprehending the conversation. “What?” he asked.
“You’re irrational,” John told her, realizing as he said it that he sounded an awful lot like Sherlock.
“Well,” John said briskly, dropping his gaze so that he appeared to be looking at the bodies and yet not seeing them at all, “not much by way of lividity yet, so they haven’t been dead long.”
“Thanks,” said John, and again, “thank you,” partly because his mum had always told him “thanks” was sloppy, and partly because once didn’t seem quite enough when it came to saving Sherlock’s life, never mind the well wishes besides.
Sherlock’s gaze darted to John, hoping to catch out the truth, but John didn’t bat an eye. Was it the meds? Or was John a practiced liar, at least when it came to his parents?
Irene’s eyes flitted to Mr. Watson then back to Sherlock, who gave a small nod of assurance. So with a small smile and an awkward wave, she took her leave.
“I’m sure she was. Just make sure the green room has fresh linens,” said Sherlock. “Come, John, I’ll show you the rest of the house.”
But this morning as Sarah looked up from where she was standing at reception, going through a stack of phone messages, she saw instantly that something was terribly wrong. And forgetting to be uncomfortable, she asked, “John? What is it?”
John was having a difficult time looking directly at Sherlock, and the fact that his flatmate appeared honestly concerned only made things worse. “Fine. Just hungry.” He was a terrible liar and he knew it, and he fully expected Sherlock to call him out on the matter, but the detective let it be.
John stared at Sherlock as if the answers were in his flatmate’s face. “I don’t. Remember,” he said determinedly.
curious. Or more, I was worried he’d have you dressing like him.” Sherlock pulled out a very simple navy suit coupled with a white dress shirt. “But no, this should do nicely.”
“Buy something. Something big enough to need a fair sized bag. You can carry his clothes up in a bag from the gift shop.”
“Indeed, so you have two options here: hold things up or help us catch a criminal. Which would you rather do?”
“There has most certainly been a crime,” Sherlock assured him. “I’m just not entirely sure what it is yet.”
Irene’s brows went up, and she looked over her shoulder at where Sherlock sat glowering. “Is that it?” she asked.
Instead, Irene took what John considered to be an unnecessarily enthusiastic and bouncy seat on the edge of his bed. “Okay, so what
If his flatmate had looked angry or irritated, John would have dropped the issue. But Sherlock’s expression was one of apprehension, and John was motivated to put him at ease, if only in terms that sidestepped the tender emotional underbelly. “I want my two hours,” he said.
“I only just looked it up online.” Sherlock pointed. “Mary and Joseph were to bring two doves or pigeons for sacrifice at the Temple, but those—”
This was their honeymoon, John supposed, cocooned away from everything and everyone. Which had been fine for a while, but boredom was beginning to take its toll on Sherlock, whose experiments were becoming increasingly dangerous—and smelly. And this was the first time John had ever seen him stoop to handling laundry of any kind.
“There.” John had looked back, and as he did, he saw the faint outline of a bear. It was right beside the human figure. Right beside it.
suffering. And, God help him, John would have to provide treatment. He waved Mrs. Hudson goodbye—she was already halfway down the track—and went to find Sherlock.
“I do breathe them in. Every day. And you look like you’ve been breathing pure strawberries.” John dangled a strawberry over Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock laughed and made a grab for it, but John eluded him. “No, you can’t have it. I’m picking for the future.”
"Just not tonight. One thing at a time," John said, and bent to kiss Sherlock slowly and thoroughly, until they were both panting.
He ignored any further rustling in favour of drinking in the view. The old pasture ran before her in a succession of little green hills right down to the famous Blair Water--an almost perfectly round pond, with grassy, sloping, treeless margins.  Beyond it was the Blair Water valley, filled with homesteads, and further out the great sweep of the white-
Neither of them, it seemed, had much to say even once the day’s work was done. John recorded their activities in his notebook as he had begun to do, and Sherlock paced. It was a relief when bedtime came.
The moose did not stop advancing, and her ears did not even flicker towards him. A bad sign. He felt a flush of adrenaline urging him to fly, not fight. He took hold of himself.
For a moment, everything was so silent that John could hear the tiny breeze rustling through the strawberry leaves.
Not again. He could not reveal himself to John, and he would not lay himself out to be vulnerable.  He could trust his body to bail him out
Next week is another HUGE and delicious chapter. I'm super excited for you to read it. I will say that I might have to skip a week after that because I'm not entirely finished Chapter 13.  I'm hoping to get it done but the term has started and I'm working 80-hour weeks for the next few weeks.
Sherlock chuckled around his mouthful, and sucked John in deeply, his big hands cupping John's ballocks.
The actual theme song of this chapter is “Common Disaster” by the Cowboy Junkies. The Easter egg is really the lyrics of the song itself; they’re a HUGE HONKIN HINT about how everything is going to go down.
In fact, though John had gone to sleep with a tight ache in his balls, he woke with a smile. He looked at Sherlock’s bare back in the early morning glow and felt like the luckiest man alive. Last night had been just the right side of too much--maybe this challenge would be a pleasant source of excitement instead of the helter-skelter rush of their usual excitement.
"Only--and I cannot emphasize this enough--only--if you wash very thoroughly afterwards," John said.
The squirrel stopped, and John could hear only the sound of Arthur’s hooves over the blowing wind. He was not far from the homestead, now; he strained his eyes to see whether the light from the cabin was visible.
“You call his name when you have nightmares,” Sherlock said, and even the shadows on John’s face couldn’t hide that it wasn’t the first time he’d been told this.
"Dearer still. Mrs. Hudson has promised me a pair from her new litter, but those are not yet ready. So beware of mice," John said, "Although if you want to experiment on those, we have them in quantity."
“Easy there!” John exclaimed, as Sherlock leaned over to look at a particularly interesting example of
John filled the final two buckets with nearly-warm lake water, and came back. He suppressed the urge to speed up his pace as he approached the house. It was as if the lamplight had made the rest of the world unsafe; who knew, now, what lurked at the outside of lighted circle.
He would, he thought, have to find some sort of slippery medium. Tallow, perhaps, though that was none too easy to come by. Gun oil? Seemed a shame to waste it. Perhaps he could concoct something; Mezenee might be able to help him too, he supposed.
Their arrival at the farm, heralded as it was by Harry and Clara’s plaintive cries and Idiot Horse’s enthusiastic whinnying by, was somewhat reassuring. The geese came up to meet them, much to Sherlock’s delight, and nothing appeared even slightly changed.
He was silent again for a long moment. Sherlock reached for his notebook. He observed John’s face was flushed and his hands gripping at the sheet, clenching and unclenching as they did when he was angry.
we still have a rogue bear problem, not to mention a deranged lumberjack at large, and I can’t go anywhere with you before the potatoes are done.”
“Bread?” John tried, and got a small shake of the head for his trouble. “You need to eat more. I can see your blood through your skin.”
“Tea, John.” Sherlock said, but did not reach for it. Very well, John thought. He cupped the back of Sherlock’s head in one hand and held the tea to his lips with the other.  Sherlock sipped it, slowly at first. Then, he began to drink it in gulps, so quickly that John pulled it back, afraid he’d take too much.
"Sherlock... I'm..." There was no time to warn him, not really, before John was lost, his pleasure running through him like swift water. Sherlock did not leave off, not until the final spasms had left John’s body boneless and damp with sweat. Then, he raised his head and their eyes met.
Crack! John's shot echoed through the air. The bear bounced back, rolled, twitched a few times, and was still.
“Too much Sherlock Holmes,” he muttered to himself. His voice sounded odd in the woods. Also, he was not entirely sure there was such a thing as too much Sherlock Holmes.
"You're delicious," John said. He set his tea aside and began to nip Sherlock's neck. "Come closer." Sherlock stretched out beside him, pushing away the blankets. Then, an idea seized him and he rolled over to cover John's body entirely. John gasped at Sherlock's cool, strong body against him, each inch of muscle and sinew alive and exciting.
“Sorry,” John said. There was no help for it; he was going to have to take Sherlock by the very seat of the trousers. He seized the fabric.
“Come, John,” he said, and began to walk out of the clearing. John stumbled, then followed, scooping up Idiot Horse’s reins as he passed. Arthur, clearly disgruntled, went on ahead.
They stopped for lunch in Charlottetown; John was very silent during the meal, taking in everything for his now-imaginary account book. The speed of movement in the elegant dining room where they ate roast beef and potatoes was startling to him, and he earned a brief reprimand from Uncle Gregory for staring at the waitress. He had only been trying to decide on the precise word to describe her neat-handedness, but his cheeks stung.
Where was the man, blast him? John retraced his steps to the cabin door. Dropping to his knees, he examined the grass just off the paths to the barn; a careful look showed him that, by the shanty, an individual trail revealed itself, and it was heading towards the main road.
In the dim light, its reasons for falling were not immediately evident; John squinted as he leaned over to check, his hand firm on his axe. Running his hand down the thick trunk, he got to splinters—which indicated a natural fall—and then, chillingly, to the blunt-edged marks of an axe.
So Sherlock stood there with John in his arms. Willing himself very still, he focused all his attention on the curve of shoulder and arm behind the young poplar. The clothes were dark; what was not indistinguishable was undistinguished. This was, almost certainly, the person responsible for the trees and the straw dog. They had come closer and closer and now, for some reason, they were within reach, and Sherlock’s brain trembled with excitement and teemed with theories.
“City boy,” John replied, mock-mournfully. “I suppose I have to tell you everything. Use the one on the right.”
The fire, though, did not have the same novelty as the man on the settle, and John found his gaze drawn towards him more often than he might have otherwise anticipated. He was handsome, though oddly so; his features were quite pronounced. His body, like his face, was long and lean, and his hands and feet quite abnormally large. Taken singly, only his large, changeable eyes and mobile mouth were beautiful, but the overall effect was one of striking good looks. Certainly his brain was striking, though John worried about what it would mean to have a devotee of science in the house all summer. Too, he worried about what it would mean to have such an attractive person in his house all summer. Any thrill would do, he supposed, when he’d been alone as long as he had.
“Drew him away from the animals so you could get a clear shot, Sherlock replied, burying his face in John’s neck.
“When he won't, he won't--Lestrade-like.  We're all born with that kink in us, young lad, and you'll have to put up with it--more by token that you're full of it yourself, you know.  Talk about your not being Lestrade!  The Watson is only skin deep with you.”
Five hours later, he was wishing he’d never asked. They had taken a long, roundabout walk through town, covering what had seemed like every low-rent area of Poole. Now, they were sitting on a park bench, in the still-breathless evening, staring across the street at the locked doors of a club. A gay club. Now the shorts made sense.
Or, John realized, admitting that his brother was right. Damn Mycroft Holmes again! He’d set Sherlock against treatment just by advocating it, and now John had to dismantle that wall of contrariness as well as fight his own urges. Well, data was the way to do it.
“I didn’t.” Sherlock said, but he held still while John reached up and palpated his temples, then the sides of his head, then the back. Sherlock’s hair was soft and his skin warm—a good sign—and each inch of skin that was intact was a relief.
“Should we move the tree?” John pulled up right beside it instead of going around as they had before. “If Lestrade sees it, there’ll be questions.”
He looked down at Sherlock sprawled on the ground; Sherlock’s eyes were huge, his curls were tousled, and one of his buttons had given way, exposing the pale collarbones at the base of that long neck. Suddenly, John did not want to whoop or leap—rather, he wanted to touch. To dominate. To pin Sherlock down and
“On foot, obviously.” Sherlock’s mouth primmed up, and John tried not to laugh. “Otherwise I risk missing valuable specimens.”
John’s cheeks flamed. He wished, for a moment, that he could sink into the earth and never return. Had Sherlock seen his crisis? If he had… and John thought of the images that had provoked it. Awful—and he had to live with the man.
“Who doesn’t?” Mrs. Hudson said, and John shuddered inwardly at the tone of her voice. He had, in the past, suspected the relationship between the two went beyond the borders of the platonic, but given their age difference he preferred not to think about it too closely. Neighbours really did deserve their privacy, and it was none of his affair.
Isadora seemed fairly impressed too; as soon as John had freed the bars she charged through, still with the rope on her neck. She shoved Byron aside, though, and went to sniff the manger. When Byron came over to sniff her arse, she didn't move, ignoring him--but she didn't run.
The strawberry patch scene is gloriously self-indulgent but can you IMAGINE Sherlock’s hands, tipped red with strawberry juice, waving around? I can, and I do it frequently. There’s an alternate universe in my head where John breaks and just sucks one of those fingers into his mouth and they bang right there. Then they leave their clothes in a heap outside and go to bed again and when they get up in the morning Harry’s eaten every stitch they own but they don’t care because their testicles are free and so are they.
“After that, no. He was taken to the infirmary, of course, with wounds, and he slept for three days. When he woke…there was nothing. He wasn’t himself. I took him back to his quarters but he wouldn’t eat, or sleep, or talk. He…” John’s voice cracked, “he
“And be deafened? No.” Sherlock was as out of temper as John had ever seen him. He looked oddly ungraceful, folded up into an angular ball on the settle, his long pale feet sticking out towards the fire.
"Correct," Sherlock said, and pressed his body to John's. John shivered at the feeling Sherlock's spunk against his cock and ballocks. His desire was returning, fiercer than ever. He thrust into the slickness.
"We're finally out of salt pork," Sherlock said, as he was making breakfast one morning about a week later. "Thank God."
"Fuck me," John breathed, at the pretty, pretty sight. It seemed there was no angle from which Sherlock's arse was not perfection.
Many thanks to tiltedsyllogism for the perspicacious and useful beta read. Any remaining errors are my own darn fault.
“Everything works, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Sherlock had still not looked up. “I have no, er, difficulties. Everything is proportionate.”
This chapter does contain animal death and dismemberment, so please be watchful of what’s good for you to read. The death is an important plot point, but if you don’t want to read about the dismembering, you can skip from “Then the bear shifted his weight” to “Get yourself clean and get into the cabin.”
With great satisfaction, he grasped the v-neck of the string vest and ripped. Sherlock’s breath hitched as the garment tore from one side to the other, and his hips bucked up against John’s.
“The grownups are gone, now,” Lestrade laughed, as he served Mrs. Hudson an enormous glass of whiskey. His eyes, John noticed, slid after Lyons, slumped at the end of the table with Sarah by his side.
“Good thing he doesn’t. Is this his bread?” She broke a piece off the current loaf and tasted it. “Quite nice, though the dough is not quite salt enough.”
John tossed the case carelessly onto the sitting room sofa and took the distance from there to the bedroom in two long strides. He threw the door open and stopped on the threshold. There were no lights on; the only illumination came from the streetlights outside filtering in through gaps in the drapes, along with the little bit of light trickling in from the open door where John stood.
“I don’t know,” John admitted, thinking furiously. He looked at his own hands. “His fingers are skinnier than mine,” he said. “I think. Not by much, though.”
John didn’t bother to argue; after all, there was no obvious fault to the logic. But he couldn’t stop staring at the screen. Moriarty’s texts from earlier in the evening were still there, and then those he had just sent:
“Brilliant,” John replied as he drew himself back to standing, and although his tone was mild his eyes flashed with something Sherlock was reluctant to label.
“But we wanted to hear about your ride, dear,” Gerrie told him, all warmth returned. “You were saying something about Pharaoh?”
“I’m not convinced he has them,” John told her. “He’s all surface. If you chip away the paint, I don’t know that there’s anything beneath it.”
While Sherlock retreated to his room, John ran his hands over his face, debating. Did he want to go back to Markham’s? No. But he didn’t want to stay home alone, either. In the end, John decided that he’d rather go with Sherlock than sit at Baker Street worrying, which is what he’d surely to do. So he turned himself around and went in search of street clothes.
“How do they choose, I wonder,” Sherlock mused. “Is it a matter of convenience? Someone in the right place at the right time to do the job they want done?”
Sherlock cocked an eye at her, and Mr. Watson said, firmly but not unkindly, “I don’t think we’ve met.”
But he had to be honest with himself. Leaving would make him miserable. John imagined spending his time wondering what Sherlock was up to, worrying about whether he was eating or had done something stupid to get himself hurt or worse. (The man had no instinct for self-preservation, after all.) John knew he would only end up scouring the papers looking for signs of Sherlock’s involvement in things. He’d be bored to tears, wishing he were at Baker Street, in the thick of things. It was selfish, to want to be underfoot, and stupid, too, given that since he’d met Sherlock he’d been in more scrapes than he cared to enumerate. It wasn’t a healthy environment.
