There were two of them—a bulky, dark-skinned man that looked like he was in desperate need of a stick pulled out of his ass and a scrawny, dark-haired, blue-eyed man that probably should have stayed up in the clouds behind his desk. Shove them in the middle of a crowd and they could blend in easily, but the twin blank expressions on their faces and the sharp, black suits hinted at their otherworldly nature.
. And, yeah, you have to work with dickheads like Zachariah and Uriel and you wouldn’t be a happy camper, either. When he appeared and disappeared and his trench coat would flutter with the wind that Dean always assumed came because of his wings. There was this aggravated scowl etched onto his face and his voice was so much more gravely than usual.
Underneath the hood of the Impala was how Castiel found him the next time he popped up in the house. Dean was more focused on the tape that he had playing on the radio inside his car and was humming along with Led Zeppelin’s
As soon as Dean stepped inside the front door, Castiel was there to meet him. Yeah, he should’ve expected it, but he’d just guessed Castiel was too pissed off to show his face around the house, so he was shocked and held a hand over his racing heart. “Damn it, Cas, we talked about this.”
Castiel closed his eyes and his fists clenched in his lap. “I’m…not a hammer, as you would say. I have my questions. I have my doubts. I don’t know what is right or what is wrong anymore and I loathe it, Dean.” Then, he smiled wryly. “Sometimes, I truly wish I could be human. It all seems so much simpler as a human.”
Dean couldn't stop the snort. "Oh, so we're supposed to put some master plan to murder your kind together in the middle of church? Man, I'm one hell of a guy, huh, Sammy?" Sam responded with the fiercest bitch face that Dean had seen in a while, honestly.
Dean should’ve known, goddamn it, especially when Sam came into the kitchen after church, somber as he told everyone at the table that, “Pastor Jim is dead.”
Dean suddenly wrapped his hands around the lapels of that tan trench coat before he started to try to move them off Castiel’s shoulders. All he desperately needed was more physical contact, more naked skin to touch, and why the hell did
Dean tried to hold back the laughter, but he couldn’t stop it completely. “Wow. No offense, Cas, but I’d hate to hear what passes as a joke up in heaven.” He shook his head as he then walked over to his workbench where a bottle of water rested. “Hey, can I ask you a question?”
Dean knew that it wasn’t what Sam wanted to hear, but it had to be done and the brunet knew it. “No. I think she’s been home all day today.”
because, whether Castiel knew about it or not, he was a total cock block and that wasn’t fair. He knew it’d be over once Castiel left which then spiraled into Dean thinking about the fact that he really didn’t want the angel to leave him.
“Like I said, I’ve seen your soul.” Castiel responded with a little smile. “Both you and Sam value your family and friends too much to risk them in the resistance. I also doubt that either of you would let the other sell his soul to a demon for information and neither of you would work with a demon. The more powerful demons have learned how to hide their stains on human souls, of course, but I still believe in you both.” He then paused and looked ahead, not really focus. “My brothers and sisters…they’ve spent so much time in heaven that they’re disconnected from humans. Most of them have a great deal of distrust for humans. I, on the other hand, have faith in humanity.” After another second, he frowned again. “We shouldn’t talk about this anymore. If the wrong person heard me speak like that…it could be considered blasphemy.”
After what Castiel said about Dean, about all the faith he had in him and humanity, the least he could do for Castiel was shut up when he needed him to. “Yeah, sure, Cas,” he carefully dropped back down onto the floor so that he could start to finish up repair on the sink.
Pastor Jim nodded toward the brothers as he passed them, but didn't stop to talk, but Castiel noticed. "Who was that man?"
Heat licked at every inch of Dean that it could while he ran toward the bedroom. When he rushed inside, his eyes landed on the ceiling where there was the definite outline of a female body surrounded by fire and, oh God no, this couldn’t happen. It just couldn’t…not to sweet, awesome Jessica. No, no, no.
Rather than let Dean's mouth end their lives, Sam spoke up on their account. “Yes sir. I'm Sam and this is my older brother, Dean.”
Castiel peered down at himself before he stared at Dean once more, blankly and as if the answer was the most obvious in the world. “I didn’t wish to attract any more attention than necessary at the mass today. Humans tend to…flock around us when we attend masses.” Yeah, he could understand that. Most of the people at church were enthusiastic believers and tended to drop to their knees in the presence of angels. “And, obviously, I want there to be the least amount of stigma placed on you and your family as possible. Therefore, I changed my attire to something that would be considered…more casual.”
“When this…mess is behind us, maybe before I return to my duties with the garrison, I could…pull some strings, as you would say, and help you become a mechanic?” Castiel offered and Dean couldn’t help but smile a little easier. Castiel noticed how Dean chuckled and reeled back a little, like he was offended that Dean would laugh at his kind offer. “What?”
Thank God that it flew over his head because he cocked his head to the side and squinted. “Get lucky how? I don’t understand.”
Once the service was over and Jessica had escaped to work with one of her coworkers, Dean, Sam, and Castiel stood around the front of the church and waited for the crowd to disperse because Bobby, Ellen, and Jo were always some of the last to make it out. Ellen liked for them to be near the front for service because it kept up the whole dedicated worshipers appearance, or so Bobby and Jo told him. They all usually met up after services to talk about if there were any cases that needed to be worked.
There wasn’t too much that Dean could remember from when he was four, but what he could, his mother was always in the memory. But the one memory that was still crystal clear decades later had been that damned fire. Well, it had been an explosion from a crash, but the house had still been on fire. And he would always wonder if he was just fucked up or if it was the human mind that made all those happy memories a little too fuzzy while the most horrible moments remained pristine.
Dean immediately understood the hidden message in that question, but he should’ve known that Dean would never ever rat Castiel out to his superiors. “‘Course you can, Cas.” He replied and threw a stick into the fire to keep away the chill.
Castiel was one of the angels he heard about from his mom when he was a little kid. Maybe Castiel actually cared about humanity, actually believed that humans were God’s best creations and should be protected, and hated the whole world domination deal as much as the humans did. Maybe the only reason he issued that threat before the witch hunt had been because he had to since it was his
“Maybe I’m a dumb fuck, but what happens when all the seals break? Whatever the hell they are?” Dean questioned weakly.
Dean has some less than platonic desires around Castiel. So, of course it makes sense for him to try and get laid...with people that are not Castiel. Yeah, nice work on that one, Dean.
? But Castiel went completely still underneath Dean’s touch and he was scared that he had went too far in such little time. The dark-haired man leaned away from him, eyes still closed but panting. Then, his eyes flew open and he stared at Dean in horror.
Dean put on his most charming smile and grinned cockily at Sam. Sam got up and let out a laugh, then he pushed Dean's head to the side playfully and walked to the door.

Finally, the nurse was done and left the room with the promising hint Castiel might be released today. When she was gone, Dean got up and stooped over Cas. His hand gently touched his cheek, his thumb stroked over the light stubble on his chin. Their eyes met, and Dean smiled softly. He leaned down and kissed Cas deeply, urged him to open his mouth with his own. There was an urgency, an aching need lingering in their kiss, which made Dean’s head spin, which brought a hot blush to his cheeks. For a second, he let go of Cas to see the expression in his eyes, was overwhelmed to find nothing but adoration and desire there. He bent down for another kiss, electrified when Castiel kissed him harder, making him forget the whole damn world around them.
"Partly", Dean admitted and shrugged his shoulders. The frown on his forehead told Castiel something was wrong, that something was preoccupying him, and he didn't seem too over-eager to share his thoughts. For a while they were silent and Castiel focused on Dean's back – he could feel underneath his fingertips that all the tension was gone, and Dean seemed deeply relaxed. Castiel smiled as he detected Dean's happy smile while Castiel's fingers stroked his whole back up and down in reassuring movements. Dean took in a deep breath, then he blurted out with the thing overshadowing his mind.
For a moment, they ate in amicable silence. Dean contemplated Castiel secretly, downright happy about the lasting smile on his pink lips, which he had brought there.
"It's not just that I'm a fed and he's a hooker, I feel so bad for meeting him the way I did in the first place, you know. I really like him, and... well, he's driving me insane... but I have so many doubts, and I have such a sore conscience about going back to him like this."
"Are you hungry? I think I exaggerated a little... I made three different dishes, just in case you don't like fish or if you're lactose-intolerant or allergic to nuts, and please,
"Oh God, Cas," he whispered against the wet, luscious mouth and Castiel kissed him passionately, bruising Dean's lips with his own. Breathlessly they let go of one another, underneath the water Castiel's hand seized Dean's hip and he replied to Dean's movements and pushed his pelvis forward, meeting Dean's eager thrusts as he kept Dean in place, close to his overexcited crotch.

Out of nowhere, their hands developed a life of their own as they tugged and pulled at the other man, sliding over chests and backs desirously, causing a havoc. Their mouths met and crashed together in gut-wrenching, longing kisses that left Dean dumbfound and quavering with maddening pleasure. It felt like Castiel's hands were all over him, taking charge of him easily, and Dean wanted nothing more than to lose himself in the nerve-wracking caresses Castiel gave him. Their tongues glided along each other's intimately, Dean fisted Castiel's hair fiercely and inclined his head to deepen the sensual kiss. He heard a high-pitched whimper that let hot thunderbolts pass through him, Castiel clutched his shoulders firmly as lust grew within them increasingly.
"Oh, I think I've got to go now, before you continue talking about healthy vegetable beverages, ugh."
First of all I wanna thank you for sticking with this story and giving it a try – it makes me very happy and I hope I won't bore you to death. Secondly, I think I will be posting a playlist or listing of all the songs I used in this story once it's finished, because there will be a few more mentioned. If you're not completely averse classical music you should listen to the piano songs Castiel plays, I e.g. love them and I think they're not too incomprehensible compared to 'normal' music. Until the next update and tons of love! Yours, mos
"I'm sorry, Dean. Sorry. I never meant... Sorry. Just forget it," Sam chocked out, and Dean's heart convulsed, his chest tightened. By instinct, Dean leaned forward and placed a comforting hand on Sam's shoulder, bending his head to seek for his answering eyes. When they regarded one another at last, Sam laughed embarrassed and shook his head as if he was scolding himself for his temper tantrum. He brushed over his face with the back of his hand and sighed raggedly.
“Friends,” he breathed the word out as if he didn’t repeat it then it would vanish from between them. “I’m very honored that you would consider me a friend, Dean.”
"Yes, well, before I became a warrior, I observed the earth and humans." He seemed kind of proud of that.
" to make the world as their Father wanted it to be is Year Six. Under the radar, most people just called it Year 666 because by firm hand, the angels meant that they wanted to take over the world and put themselves at the top of the food chain. What was that old saying? Never trust a pretty face because the devil used to be an angel before he fell?
John never spoke much about The Holy Year to Dean, but Dean could remember how everyone would tell his father to have faith when he demanded justice after Mary's death.
had never seen Aaron. Dean didn’t know what to think, only that there was a heavy stone in his stomach, that he was deeply troubled and worried about Cas either way.
“The countryside is marvelous here. It always fills me with serenity when I take a walk here, and all the chaos inside my head just goes mute,” Castiel said finally. Dean stopped and took a look around, taking in the summery surroundings, the trees softly rocking in the wind, the flowers bending and going to sleep… He smiled melancholy, thinking how ephemeral his time here was.
“Oh, I’ve heard. You’re right, usually, I’d be pissed. But senator Gilbert just called me, right after he read the news.”
"Well, I wouldn't ditch you," Dean said with a smile, adoring how Castiel turned his head to him and gave him a beaming, happy smile. Blindly, their hands intertwined, Dean felt impossibly calm when Castiel's fingertips brushed over the back of his hand. His heart leapt into his throat the longer they regarded one another tenderly.
"Is that so?" Castiel asked softly, making Dean's skin crawl with endearment. Flabbergasted, he searched for the right words, incapable of sorting his spaced out thoughts. Castiel watched him with amused knowledge in his look, making Dean scoff eventually. That son of a bitch knew exactly how to play his cards and to drive Dean wild.
Only five demons were left on his side, the majority of them found pleasure in attacking the bold other two. Dean noticed a gap between his foes, and he starting running, aiming for the flamethrower.
The setting sun was shining through the clean windows of Castiel's bedroom, and he narrowed his eyes as he stared into the lush, golden light. Through half-closed eyes, he could pretend that the sparkle of the dancing light beams resembled the luminescence, which lived in Dean's stunning, green eyes. There had always been a golden spark in those irises, and as the sun warmed Castiel's pale face, he was sure he could remember it perfectly. He held his breath as he felt his heart skipped a beat and how strong, warm love bloomed within his chest, fluttering softly inside him like a butterfly's wings; restlessness reappeared inside of him, as it came to his mind again, why he was lying in bed and staring idly at the late afternoon's sun. He had wanted to distract himself, and of course he had failed to do so.
He wasn't in the best of moods when Castiel knocked at his open door hesitantly, leaning against the doorframe and giving him a mellow look and a tender smile. He looked gut-wrenchingly admirable in the lush, golden morning light, how he stood there in the door with his white uniform, his dark hair strictly combed in a side parting. His eyes were refracting the light and shone in their plain, luscious colour at him, cut right through his heart. His rosy lips looked delicate, and his skin appeared even softer as a ray of light hit it. Dean felt his breathing falter for a second; Castiel looked angelic, fresh and pure like a flower at the crack of dawn, just blossomed and wet with morning dew. His feelings were already quieterfrom just looking at him; without knowing it, Cas was his calming anchor, which brought him down to earth. The smile he returned though wasn't as heartfelt as he had aimed for. Castiel entered the room and they exchanged quiet "Good mornings"; Castiel was sitting down on his bedside quite naturally, his legs hanging loosely from the mattress.
As they stood there in the greyish twilight - Dean's back facing the door and Castiel in front of him – it appeared to Dean that their breaths were terribly loud, uneven. He didn't exactly know where he and Castiel where standing in the moment, but the urge to be near him was unbearable. Especially when he drowned in the dark glint ignited in Castiel's wide, blue eyes. They were clinging to Dean's steady look, reading him like an open book. He was still worried how Castiel could do that, breaking seal after seal of his protective wall to gain access to his innermost thoughts, with just a quick glance.
Castiel showered and went right to bed; it was late, but not that late, however he felt already tired. He winced with surprise when he lay in bed and his cell phone started ringing. Blindly he grasped it and answered it. It was Dean, and Castiel suddenly felt wide awake when he heard the soft voice of the man at the other end.
Castiel lay in Dean’s arm, stroking along his bare chest idly. It was incredibly comfortable to lie in bed like this, together, sated, sweat-through. It seemed unimaginable to ever let go of one another, that this was their last night together. That this was the final goodbye. The constant rise and fall of Dean’s chest was becalming, easing Castiel’s mind. It was the perfect lullaby, yet Castiel refused to fall asleep. He wanted this night to last forever, eschew the inevitable as long as he could. Dean’s fingers drew mindless patterns on Castiel’s upper arm, tenderly he pressed a kiss into Castiel’s dark hair, and held him tighter. He sighed contently, melted into Dean’s side, and threw an arm around his middle. Why couldn’t they stay like this? Why did they have to part? A silly idea came to Castiel’s mind then, and he gave voice to it, although he already knew the answer.
„Dean, I need you, wanna feel you,” Castiel muttered. Dean gulped nervously and sat up a little. He reached out a hand and tenderly stroked along Castiel’s stubbly cheek – with delight, he saw him leaning into the palm of Dean’s hand, visibly enjoying his affectionate caress.
„Don’t sweat it, Cas. In fact, you’re a pretty good kisser,” he said with a smirk. It made Castiel grin and reply „you’re not half bad yourself, Winchester” and for that, Dean felt as if on top of the world, stupidly happy. He gave him a nod towards the way still ahead of them and stretched out his arm invitingly. He was glad when Castiel returned to him and when he could throw his arm around his back again.
They were both strangely quiet as they walked to Castiel's office. Dean cursed inwardly about his crutches; their eyes darted over each other time and again, and sometimes Dean caught Castiel staring at him, and then both of them smiled hesitantly. There was something in the air, something thick and heavy with meaning – sparks were flying busily between them, heating up the atmosphere, until Dean felt as if he was going insane with passion. He wanted to kiss those pink lips greedily, he wanted to grab Castiel's slim hips and push him against the next wall to ravage him unrestrainedly... When he received another of Castiel's melancholic looks, he decided to man up and talk with him.
Castiel stayed awake this night, the tiredness he usually felt was long gone, he had overcome his dead point. He wondered if Dean would come to his apartment after his shift, or if he was too fed up with him to face him tonight. He had given Dean the spare key to his place quite naturally last week, and had received Dean's in return. It felt laughable to remember the sweet kisses they had shared afterward, how they had whispered trustful words into each other's ears and held the other man in a tight embrace. A dark emotion shaded Castiel's mind, and he felt a somber wish to possess Dean in the same manner he did whenever he wasn't in the brothel. It made him sick and chilled to the bone to imagine the things Dean had done today, with whom above all. He was so withdrawn into his self and his own embittered world, that he couldn't even watch TV – the whole place was quiet and dipped into the night's light. Only the moon illuminated parts of Castiel's home with silver and white dots and rays here and there.
He noticed the sharp inhale from his partner, the odd trembling of his shoulders. Then he knew Castiel was crying silently, finally coming to terms with their unavoidable, cruel future. Dean turned around to him, brought their warm naked bodies closer as they regarded one another face to face. He smiled tenderly at Castiel, let a hand run through his nightly dark hair.
John had invited Dean and Castiel over for Monday evening, so that they could have the dinner John had promised them. Sam would be there too, because he had a few days vacation between his exams. Castiel had showered after work, then he picked Dean up from the garage, completely flustered when he saw the knowing grins of Ash and Jo, he even blushed when Jo teased him why he was dressed up so formally. He grumbled something incoherent that he was just wearing his usual everyday clothes, and Dean laughed at him – so maybe the blue-stripped button-down was a bit overdone, especially with the fine dark blue silken tie, and maybe he had combed his hair ridiculously austerely, but he knew Dean liked it that way, because he had told him so the other day. And the black slacks he wore, well, that was nothing special, but the black, shiny leather shoes were possibly exaggerated as well. Mainly, because Dean wore just a pair of washed-out jeans, comfortable, dirty sneakers and a sanguine T-shirt, which clung perfectly to his slim figure. His hair was disheveled, and he appeared wild and young, the complete contrast to Castiel's stern presence.
Dumbstruck and amused, the brothers let Castiel serve hot bruschetta and cold tomato salad as the first course. Dean broke out in laughter when Castiel poured himself a huge wine glass with a high percentage wine bluntly. Castiel raised his eyes and grinned roguishly at Dean when he sipped at his alcoholic beverage, his blue eyes gleaming with mischief. He shrugged his shoulders and emptied half of the glass in an imprudent way that had Dean dropping his jaw.
Dean groaned lowly at once and his unoccupied hand flew to the button border of Castiel's baby blue shirt. Clumsily Dean opened one button after the other, his eyes never leaving Castiel's as if he was seeking for his consent, and the way Dean bit his bottom lip tensely, Castiel didn't find the courage to deny him this little concession. He shooed Dean's fingers away and replaced them with his own, unbuttoning his shirt quickly. In doing so he revealed the pale skin of his lean torso, and in a trice Dean's palm touched his pecs approvingly. Castiel searched for appreciation in Dean's eyes, and when he found them, hooded and heavy with lust, he succumbed to his own appetite. He lay his own hand above Dean's and moved it down, over his chest, his ribs, his stomach, hinting Dean to touch him. This was okay, Castiel thought, this was a safe zone. He couldn't resist the sweaty warm palm moving over his skin so lovingly, it felt too damn good. He watched how Dean's lids closed and he moaned, he threw his head back and exposed his throat trustfully to Castiel, his hand roaming over Castiel's bare upper body fervently, while his other hand massaged and stroked his dick harder and harder.
Castiel must have been the superior between the two, Dean figured as Castiel turned back to look at the three humans. “You are Dean and Sam Winchester—the sons of John Winchester. Is that correct?”
“Oh, yes, you are, and you’ll have a long chat with both Raphael and Naomi when we return to heaven.” Zachariah sneered with blatant revulsion. “How could I trust your opinion when you’ve shared state secrets?” It didn’t seem possible, but Castiel stiffened even more than before. “Yes, Castiel, we know about it. Maybe you’ve sided with Lucifer and his abominations. Is that why you’ve turned a blind eye to their activities or is it because of your little crush on them?”
“I hate you so much.” Jessica whined and covered her face with her hands. “I really hope you didn’t talk to an
more than once every few hours and they don’t sit around at the kitchen table all night staring at the friggin’ wall.” He waved his arms around dramatically. “For someone that watched humans, you sure as hell don’t know a lot about us, dude.”
Dedicated to family on top of all her awesomeness? "Dude, if you don't hurry up and marry that girl, I'm gonna do it for you." Dean murmured when Sam plopped down beside him.
“Time to leave, sweetheart,” Azazel told her, all smiles, but there was a threat underneath it that she needed to listen to his order or there would be hell to pay.
The aforementioned man decided to slip into the kitchen at that moment. After he kissed his future wife on the forehead and snatched the coffee from her, he plopped down at the table and looked around—probably for the previous topic of conversation. Before he could even open his mouth to ask about it and before Dean could even answer the question, Castiel chose to reappear to the three of them.
, he meant humans. “And then, I was pulled away from my duties by Raphael. I was commanded to take up the sword and no one told me why until we stepped foot on Earth.”
A heavy, tense silence had fallen between the three men as they drove back to Lawrence and it wasn't until they were parked in front of the house that Bobby shared with Ellen and Jo that someone finally talked about the earlier incident. Before Bobby was out of the Impala, Dean turned around in his seat to fix the older hunter with a hard stare. "You better tell Pastor Jim what happened today. If they know about Dad, then they'll know about all of you soon enough—if they already don't." He warned. "Don't meet up for a while. Keep your noses down. Just keep your mouths shut. I don't want to lose you, Ellen, and Jo over this."
“I find your sarcasm to be in poor taste, Dean.” Castiel shot back with a face that looked like he just sucked on a lemon before he disappeared from the table.
That should’ve made him feel better, but all he could think about was how Sam didn’t have someone to curl up beside anymore and there were even more tears. It was hard not to feel guilty when he leaned out to bury his face into Castiel’s chest and croak out a weak, “Put your arm around me.” And it was kind of nice when he wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders because he could bury himself into the angel as much as physically possible.
"Listen to me, you worthless, hairless ape," Uriel seethed, "we don't have to explain our reasons to you. You can either tell us about your father's death or you will be forced to tell us about it." Then he smirked. "Personally, I'd prefer you choose the latter."
The sun blazed down on—well, what used to be called—Kansas and the sleek, black vehicle that tore down the open road. Not much was spoken between the three men that consisted of two brothers and one, surly older man with his trademarked trucker hat because not much needed to be said, so Metallica was used to fill the silence. Other than the usual banter of public service announcements, music had essentially died out when the angels took control, so Dean all but worshiped the tapes his father left behind in the Impala. It reminded him of warm days in the car, when they had the windows down, and his mother and father would banter back and forth with each other while Dean played with baby Sam in his car seat.
Much to Dean's dismay, it was a lot harder than it used to be to have a slice of pie. Sure, Lawrence had a nice population, but it was nowhere near the size of cities on the east coast. It was poorer compared to those places and the pie was pretty damn expensive—any sweets were, honestly. Factories that processed fatty foods had pretty much died out, so it was mostly farms that supplied the nation's organic, healthy rabbit food. So, anyone that could make a pie out of what was left made sure that they were paid well and, unfortunately, a professional hunter's salary couldn't make it.
Unfortunately, fate decided that Winchesters weren’t the kind of people who had a lot of luck and Castiel was there in the kitchen when he stepped inside. Blue eyes locked on him as soon as he stepped past the threshold, but he kept his own on the plate of food left on the countertop. Despite the late hour, he tried to make as much noise as possible because he couldn’t handle the silence and the tension that came with it. Since Castiel had been alive since forever, Dean went ahead and assumed that he could read the air in the room and understand that Dean didn’t want to talk, but
Their arrival at church with a new friend—loose term, but Jessica decided they should introduce him that way to the church crowd—was met with skepticism. Dean suspected that everyone automatically knew because only people with bank could dress as nice as Castiel and there weren't exactly a bunch of rich people lined up to be the friends of the Winchesters. Plus, since the dude didn't have much experience with humans—Dean couldn't be certain, but he was pretty damn sure that Castiel hadn't—he didn't have the natural habits of one. He moved in a fluid manner, didn't blink or even breathe as much as he should have, and was too ethereal to pass as human. Dean spotted more than one person who stared over at them in the middle of the service.
Dean couldn’t help but crack up at that. He moved out from underneath the sink and when Castiel looked down at him, there was actually a little smile on his face, like the one in the garage. “Dude,” he gasped out and after another minute or two got a hold of his laughter. “Just shut the door if they bother you that much.” Rather than wait on Castiel to do it, Dean stood up himself and walked over to shut the door to the kitchen. “There. Problem solved.” He shook his head and chuckled. “By the way, no one says
“I’ve been alive since before the Earth was shaped. I’ve had much time to learn various skills while I also observed the planet.” He shot back almost petulantly and Dean basked in his ability to goad the angel.
“I used to help people, Dean. No one knew about it, of course, but I would watch over travelers. That had been my main purpose in heaven. If they were lost, I would help to point them in the right direction. If they were too hot, I’d let them have a cool breeze. I would help some edible plants grow around them if they were in desperate need of food. I…” He stared down at his hands. “I did more. But now…all I do is watch humans cower when I walk by or stare at me spitefully like you used to do. I…it makes me very unhappy.”
Rather than talk to Jessica about what Castiel said, Dean did what he did best when faced with emotional shit that hit too close to home…he ran. It wasn’t far, but when he slammed his door shut and locked it, that was more than enough to tell everyone that he didn’t want to be talked to. He paced back and forth in front of his door for a few seconds before he snarled at his own stupidity at being so completely blatant with his sexuality in front of a freaking angel of the Lord and plopped down on his bed. He buried his face into his pillow and almost screamed but that would only make his case that he wasn’t acting like a toddler about the issue null and void.
, but he knew, unlike John, that she never would have wanted them to avenge her death if it meant their souls.
Dean Winchester had been four when the skies tore open and servant upon servant of heaven crashed down onto the planet. Over the decades, that afternoon had become somewhat of a blur, but he could remember, before his father shoved his six-month-old baby brother into Dean's arms and shielded them both with his body, how he wished for an awesome new bike for his birthday on, what he believed at the time to be, shooting stars.
Sure, Dean had heard about that sort of stuff, but he still raised a brow and asked, "People can do that?" Castiel looked hesitant to answer, so Dean dropped it—not like he wanted to make himself look suspicious with, what could be considered, interest. "Must have a lot of juice to keep you out, huh?"
Dean couldn’t help but snort. He had been four when he lost his mother, but he could still remember some things about her and he remembered how much she loved to tell Dean that angels were watching over him, that they were kind and protectors. It seemed like a cruel twist of fate that an angel crashing into their house had been what killed her. But, in the scheme of things, Dean’s realized that it was probably for the better since her heart would’ve broken when she saw what the angels were really like.
Dean was floating on a cloud of dizziness and joy while his abs constricted again and again with each wave of his ongoing orgasm, he shook terribly against the other body. When he came around he realized he was kissing Castiel breathlessly, wetly, unrestrainedly. Appreciative hums vibrated against his sensitive mouth, tickled a little, and he pulled away, still huffing and puffing as if he had run a whole marathon. A shy smile came to Dean's mouth, for he was a little abashed to have come undone so thoughtlessly – but Castiel cupped his cheek gently and kissed him again, slowly and thoroughly, and when Dean melted against his moving mouth, he knew all was good, that he had done no wrong.
It was addictive to sense Cas’ velvety skin right on his lips, to feel how hot and hard he was already. Humming, Dean touched himself, realized he wasn’t faring any better. He massaged his own dick as he wrapped his lips around the head of Cas’ erection, started sucking him. Castiel moaned quietly above him. Torturously slowly, Dean took him inside his mouth, inch by inch, loved how it left Castiel squirming restlessly on the sheets.
you're not indifferent to Dean. A blind man could see you two love each other, so I suggest you move your ass asap to your lover and kiss him and make up. I'm not saying his behaviour was right, hell no, but you can be right for the both of you. It's not like you have anything left to lose, right?"
A part of him asked him bitterly what the hell he thought he was doing, wondered why he was playing this excruciating game with Dean. He still had the opinion that he didn't want to be the man who walked into a brothel to sleep with a stranger in return for money – and he certainly didn't want to be the man who did this several times for his own pleasure. How could Dean not feel exploited? How could he dare to believe Castiel saw more in him, the person behind, and not just another willing body?
"So, your therapist, huh?", Sam asked slyly, starting to unpack Dean's bags and shoving his clothes into the head-high closet behind the door.
"Right... So, let's see what it should show... the temperature, oxygen content, alright... electromagnetic frequencies as well, so maybe we could upgrade an EMF somehow."
Only now Castiel realized he was still bare ass naked, and Dean grinned impishly, letting his eyes roam over Castiel's body only too eagerly. He kept washing up a plate while he feasted on Castiel, his steady regard slowly coming to rest on Castiel's. A heartbeat passed, and Castiel's eyes wandered down to Dean's lips; a consuming desire awoke inside of him, and before he knew it, he had leant forwards and covered Dean's mouth with his, shutting his lids. For a second they paused, relinquishing the lead in favor of the other, then they lunged at each other, both drinking in the other man desperately, kissing and sighing into each other's mouth needily. Castiel let his hands frame Dean's face, and he pulled him closer, moved him against his lips, and they melded together perfectly – nothing mattered, nothing but the two of them, and the intimacy they shared, the affiliation both of them clearly felt.
Breathing hard, Dean let the gun fall out of his hand, absentminded. He studied Anna’s lifeless body there in the sand, the way her limbs lay oddly twisted. Cool raindrops fell from the sky, suddenly, as if they were tears, mourning Benny’s and Anna’s deaths. Dean’s head was swimming, the world was spinning. He felt nauseous, about to lose consciousness. His hurt cheek was burning, and when he wiped over it, he smeared more of his blood onto his palm. The first hesitant raindrops at once turned into a cool, severe downpour, soaked his clothes, wetted his hair and skin. They wiped away some of the blood, but they couldn’t wash away the disgrace Dean had put on himself.
Dean shook his head and instead tried to focus on the campfire ahead of him. He and Castiel had to spend some time in the woods because there was apparently some kind of monster that liked to munch on horny teens that snuck out into the forest after curfew. Dean felt sorry for people who went out that way. All they wanted to do was have a little time with their sweetheart because bible thumpers loved to shove celibacy down kids’ throats these days now that they had the angels on their sides and they ended up dead for it. It was a damn shame. That was for sure.
The other man’s brows furrowed and he stared down at the flames. “I…think I have had moments like that. It was…before we fell—many millennia before that. Before Lucifer fell, even,” he mused quietly. “I loved to watch the Earth, but I also loved to spend time with my brothers and sisters. Balthazar and I were in trouble more often than not and Anael had to save us from punishment. Uriel was much more…carefree.” He smiled, but it looked too sad. “But I truly loved to spend time with my older brother, Gabriel. I miss him.”
He scrutinized the angel. “You have a lot of faith in me. How can you be so sure I’m not in the resistance?” That wasn’t the best thing to say to someone that could decide your fate, but he just couldn’t understand how Castiel could believe in him so much, especially since they hadn’t known each other that long in the scheme of things.
Dean swallowed thickly and nodded. “I should be more honored, right? I mean…it’s a pretty huge deal for some little human like me to be friends with a friggin’ angel, y’know?” He rubbed the back of his neck and made a point to stare at the fire until his eyes hurt. “I…should probably say sorry since I was pretty pissy with you at the start of this whole deal. I just didn’t…” He tried to find the least offensive way to explain the fact that he wanted to stab any angel in the throat.
The corner of Castiel’s lips turned upward a little. “Yes, I think I would like that.” Then he looked down at the ground. “Only if you’re comfortable with that and once you’re done with your work, of course.”
Yeah, this bitch was getting salt shoved up her ass before she was sent back to hell. Of course, he had to stop choking on his own lungs for that to happen first. Since Dean was a little preoccupied with that, Sam took the initiative despite how he was getting crushed into the wall and, God, Dean hated demons so damn much.
, John would scoff years later. He always told Dean that people should've had less faith, shouldn't have bowed like they did, because the angels liked it a little too much.
since the police found some sulfur at the scene of the crime. Neither of them said it since they had no idea who could be listening in on their conversation, but both of them knew that it could’ve been because of his involvement in the resistance. Pastor Jim didn’t seem like the type, but he could’ve sold his soul to a demon. But from what they’d heard from Bobby and Ellen, with Castiel so close to home, they’d kept the resistance activity down to almost none, so unless the Pastor's time ran out—which it shouldn't have—it couldn't have been because of that.
“That was that special sigil that can banish angels.” He ran a hand over his face and shook his head. “Dude, Zach won’t be happy. We need to leave. We need to find someplace to hide out for a while. Is Jess at the hospital?”
“Well, hey, at least you care enough to make us feel comfortable. I haven’t met many of you guys, but most of them are dicks.” Again, Dean tried making Castiel feel better and he had no idea why. Hell, maybe it was because, in the back of his head, he knew he’d be stuck with the angel for a while and it’d be better to get along with him rather than hash it out all the time. Or maybe it was because he didn’t like to watch a grown man cry…or an angel in the body of a grown man. “Especially that dude with you the first time we met. What was his name?”
Castiel looked at him, dead in the eye again, and had no hint of doubt in his eyes when he said, “I believed in you and your brother more than I’ve believed in my own kind for centuries.”
The other man’s head tilted to the side. “Uriel’s the funniest angel in the garrison. Ask anybody.” Then, he must’ve reran Dean’s comment through his mind and almost looked bashful when he said, “Oh. That was sarcasm, wasn’t it?”
Look, you have to make it through a thousand more words and then you finally get the Dean/Cas. And what's even better? Castiel comes to live with Dean...but not in the way you're thinking.
“I don’t get it, man. Why would he come back here?” Dean grumbled as they made their way back toward the sanctuary. “This doesn’t make any sense. This smells funky, Sam.”
It was pretty bad when someone could say that they recovered quick from a hit against the wall, but Dean unfortunately…or fortunately, he guessed, was able to admit that he could recover from it. So, he shakily stood back up on his feet and looked back over at Castiel who now had a dark-haired woman in front of him. Dressed in all black, she smiled darkly at him and batted her lashes while she purred, “Hello, handsome.” Just as he brandished a silver blade, she dropped a match onto the floor and a ring of fire erupted up from the floor.
She shot a look over her shoulder and there was a nervous glint behind her eyes when she turned back to look at them. Also, her smile was tight, but she replied with a, “of course. What kind of person would I be if I turned you away? Love your neighbor, right?”
The demon rolled her eyes at the idle threats and then waved her hand to the side, Renee’s neck moving with it almost to the point that her entire head had turned backwards. Elizabeth shrieked in horror and scrambled back from her friend’s body that slumped to the floor.
? There wasn’t a damn thing, that’s what, because it took your breath away. It left you, some tiny, insignificant protozoa, feeling like you were the center of someone’s universe which consisted of billions of galaxies and suns.
Dean had to stop and think before he spoke. “Not sure you know what this is. Fuck, who am I kidding? ‘Course you do. You know muscle memory?” He inquired and Castiel nodded in affirmation. “Guess it’s kind of like that, y’know? I hid it from my old man for so many years that the habit stuck. I know Sam and Jess don’t care about shit like that, but…old habits die hard, man.”
"My old man wasn't perfect, but, hey, who is? Never sold his soul, if that's what you think," Dean paused and sent them a look. "He wasn't exactly the poster boy for having faith, though. Don't you guys preach about people going to hell if they don't have faith in the Lord or whatever?"
Most humans had rolled over for the heavenly host, but there were resistance movements across the world. From what little information they received from public service announcements, those who rebelled against the heavenly hierarchy were sometimes able to kill off a few angels before they were discovered and removed, but it was never enough to make a dent in the angelic population or cure the world of the angels. Dean didn't think humans would ever make a dent as long as he was alive. Maybe in the future, but not with how the world was now, it seemed. And because resistance movements never lasted since people feared their angelic oppressors or since they were forcefully ended in bloodshed, one of the few times that Dean had ever screamed at his father was when he found out that John had formed a group of people to resist the angels.
“I should check in on Sam and Jessica.” Castiel announced after a few more minutes of too friendly women greeting him.
"Bet you would, princess," Sam stomped down onto Dean's foot and he hissed in pain, but recovered in front of the two creatures. "Fine, okay, whatever," he huffed then explained that, "we were after a daeva, but we were stuck in some pretty thick woods and it got the jump on my old man. Got any other questions?"
"Uriel and I came to speak with you about your father." Castiel explained as he looked directly at the two brothers. "Please explain to us the circumstances of his death in as much detail as you can spare."
“I know.” The brunet breathed out and shook his head. “We can check his house out back in town. I’m sure there’s more there…” He trailed off and stopped when they reached the sanctuary. Then, he looked over toward the altar, more specifically the podium where the Pastor used to speak. “Huh,” he huffed under his breath and walked over to it.
Wow. Dean never ever thought that Castiel would reveal this much about himself, especially to someone like Dean. “What happened to him?” He couldn’t help but ask.
Sometimes, there would be a break between hunts. It happened from time to time—probably because the monsters needed to hide better from heaven or because the angels were actually not sitting on their feathery asses and taking care of the monster problem for them. And, yeah, it made the people close to them happy since it meant they didn’t face the possibility of death, but it also meant that there wasn’t as much money in the house. Jessica made a decent amount of money at the hospital, sure, but both Sam and Dean hated to depend on her. Not because she was a woman or any other misogynistic crap like that, but because they didn’t want to mooch off her. Jessica worked as hard as any other person out there and deserved to reap the benefits—not use it to support her soon-to-be hubby and his older brother.
.” Tammi sneered and turned to face Elizabeth. “What did you expect would happen when you and the book club prayed to all those dark forces? Did you think they were pretend? Did you think it was the power of
“C’mon,” he started to run toward the doors on the other end of the sanctuary. “We have to tell Bobby and Ellen about this, too. I wouldn’t put it past that dick to try and go after them to get through us.”
By you’ll know when you’ve arrived, what Castiel meant was that when they were remotely close to the house, he would pop up in the backseat and scare the shit out of both Dean and Sam. The two of them needed to learn how to adjust to that habit or maybe they could sit Castiel down and explain that neither brother's heart would last much more if he went on with that crap—but maybe that was what his superiors wanted. Dean wouldn't put it past the angels, to be honest.
Before Dean could even get a word in edgewise, Castiel spoke up. “As I explained to Dean before, I’m aware that you and Sam are healthy adults who are in love and soon to be married. People have…had sex with less than that between them.” He looked to Dean expectedly, almost like he was proud that he used more up to date terms. Then he had some kind of an epiphany. “Of course, one of you or both of you could be uninterested in sex and you bonded in another way. One would be very surprised at how fluid human sexuality truly is.”
“I didn’t mean to upset you.” Castiel spoke up in a quiet voice, careful to not wake anyone up. “I was under the assumption that your family knew about your sexuality. I’m sorry that I did that to you. I shouldn’t have even talked about such a sensitive topic. Not without speaking to you about it first.”
The mention of Jessica made Sam stir, but it didn’t take the blank look off his face. Rather, he leaned back onto the bed and stared up at the wall above him. Dean knew that it was the best Sam could do and he was a damned hypocrite because he wouldn’t take care of himself, either. No matter how much they both lost, how much you’d think they would be used to loss, the grief never got any easier.
“Do you know what happened to Lizzy? The…uh, only survivor of that coven?” he reiterated and then ran a hand across his face when he remembered what Castiel had said about her punishment. “You said that you were sure they’d take it easy on her, but you didn’t look all that sure about it, man. Have you heard about what happened to her?”
Their conversation dropped after that and Dean stood there for a few more seconds before he moved back over to the Impala. He cleared his throat and reached for one of his tools then looked over his shoulder at Castiel who still stood in the same place that he appeared in. “You’re allowed to sit down somewhere, y’know.” He pointed out and motioned toward the chair that was in front of his workbench.
a witch and she needs to be punished for that. But I haven’t heard about the severity of her punishment. That is left to those of a higher rank.”
“C’mon, man, we talked about this. Give the lovebirds some alone time, okay? This is Jess’s first day off in a while and with you and me around all the time, they never have the chance to,” he paused and tried to find the nicest way to phrase what, no doubt, Sam and Jessica were doing, “cement their relationship.” Yeah, that sounded pretty okay.
“There aren’t many people with cars these days, buddy.” He shook his head. “But…thank you for the offer, anyway. I really appreciate it.” His companion looked really frustrated and upset about Dean’s answer. “Whoa, Cas, dude, it isn’t that big a deal. Really, it’s not.”
A startled scream came from the kitchen, as did the sound of a plate as it shattered on the floor, and the two men were up from the couch, sawed-off shotguns that they hadn't cleaned yet in hand. In the doorway to the kitchen, they held up their weapons, but dropped them when the metal went red hot. It should have dawned on him then and there what they were up against, but it didn't until he actually looked at their enemies.
“Dean!” He heard his brother scream and also heard his footsteps thunder toward Dean’s position, but then there was a loud crash. Dean could barely look over his shoulder, but he saw that the same invisible force that hand a hand in his chest had also pinned Sam to the wall.
As it would turn out, it was a hell of a lot harder than he expected to find someone to share a bed with him. No matter what the church believed, people still had sex. It was only when the sex broke the law that it became a real problem and even then, the angels weren’t too preoccupied with most of those cases. So, there were plenty of people that he could choose from, but it…never really happened.
Dean shoved some mashed potatoes into his mouth and tried to think of what he could say to Castiel. “You didn’t know. Honestly, I should’ve talked about it to Sam and Jess awhile back, but I couldn’t ever do it. Thanks for doing it for me, I guess.” He mumbled after he swallowed his food.
Sam ran ahead to the kitchen where Jessica was and Dean allowed them one minute to kiss, make out, have sex—whatever they needed get out of their system even though they had literally seen each other that same morning. They were in the honeymoon phase and weren't even married yet, and while Dean tapped his foot impatiently, he wondered how much worse it'd be
Both Sam and Dean walked toward the middle of the altar where Castiel was trapped then turned around to face the new presence in the room. It was an older man with a thinning hair line, but Dean barely noticed that because all he could focus on were those cloudy yellow eyes that made him feel like they were boring holes into his skin. Faintly, in the back of his head, he could hear the drunken whispers of his father. “
Sam immediately took over for him. “Talk as much as you want, but no dice. We’ll never make a deal.”
The other man looked down at the concrete and almost seemed upset. “Contrary to what you may believe, I don’t like to make humans miserable.”
When Jessica stumbled into the kitchen, dressed in her Sunday best, as bleary-eyed as he had been, Dean looked over his shoulder at Castiel, but the angel had vanished. The blonde followed his gaze before she rubbed her eyes and yawned. "Scare him off already?" she joked.
they were married. He was sure more than a minute had passed when Jessica poked her head out of the kitchen and beamed at him as she slowly moved a pie into view.
Sam smiled a little. "We need in the house to end the problem, but if we don't build some kind of trust with them, like Dean said, they'll kill us at the door. And we need in there to take down the wards, too," he added. "It helps sometimes to use the hunter card, like if we need information. Other times, it's better to lie."
, his mind supplied—there wasn't that much issue to trust them. The old enemy of my enemy is my friend chestnut, he assumed, even if to have information about angelic weaknesses or weapons to capture or kill angels, resistance leaders had to sell their souls.
Dean rolled his eyes because only Castiel could talk about human sexuality so seriously. Jessica, on the other hand, seemed genuinely interested, but also confused. “Does that mean that the preachers are wrong?” She inquired and Castiel raised a brow at her. “When they say that homosexuality is condemned by the bible? Is that not right?”
"Million dollar question," the brunet leaned against the counter cut them off, "who loves pie more? Dean or Jess?" he asked and dodged the smack that his fiancée aimed at him.
And it was almost instinctive when he retorted with a coy smirk and said, “You keep up with that and you might get lucky tonight, Cas.” Fuck, fuck, fuck, did he actually say that out loud? What the hell? Oh, shit there was a circle in hell for someone that flirted with a damn angel of the Lord.
Bobby apparently didn't appreciate his tone because he shot a scowl back at Dean. "For someone that doesn't want to be in charge, you sure do know how to bark orders." He rolled his eyes and slid out of the car. "See y'all soon, idjits."
Dean decided to let the conversation drop, mostly because Sam and Jessica had decided to come back downstairs. Once it was established that both brothers had the approval of Jessica to attend church, they shuffled out of the house and crowded into the Impala. It was bothersome when Castiel decided to ride with them to church, but it made sense. Dean had never seen them personally, but he heard stories special sigils that could keep angels out of places. Their new feathered roommate probably didn’t want to risk the chance of losing them on the radar.
This was a pretty sensitive topic for him, Dean could tell. “I’m sorry, Cas.” He took a deep breath and smiled bitterly. “If it makes you feel better, you’re not the only one that got the short end of the stick. When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a mechanic. That was what my dad was before we were assigned to be hunters, but it’s not because of him that I wanted to be one.” He scrounged his head for an explanation. “Cars were cool and they’ve always made sense to me in a way that nothing else can. I can take them apart, put them back together, fix them up, make them look nice, and that’s all there is to it.”
“There’s more than Zep, y’know.” Dean offered hesitantly and when Castiel turned his stare on Dean, he flushed and rubbed the back of his neck. “One of the perks to being a hunter is that I kept Baby here.” He reached up to pat the top of the hood that was still propped up. “And I kept my awesome tunes.” He cleared his throat and jutted a thumb toward the windshield. “So, I could put in some other music if you want to hear more?”
“Renee, shut your painted hole.” Tammi, the patron demon to desperate housewives, drawled and kept her hand raised. She even took a step forward and another wave of pain rolled over Dean while the wall behind Sam buckled under the pressure. “So, a couple of hunters show up at the door? Not that much a problem. Just another mess I have to clean up.” She said. “But help me out on this one, boys, why exactly is there an angel in the backseat of that rust bucket?”
Before either Winchester could speak up, Castiel took another, more confident step forward. “Neither Dean or Sam are a part of the resistance. I can confirm this without a doubt. Azazel tried to offer them a deal and both turned him down. They are innocent on all charges.”
Dean was thankfully able to wave it off. “Just…never mind, man,” his face was red and his heart raced in his chest. “We really need to work on your people skills before you head back to heaven. Maybe next time you’re down here, you won’t be such an awkward dork.”
It took a hell of a lot of willpower not to panic at the sudden appearance of angels because the only time they ever showed up on a hunt was to take out a demon that humans couldn't handle. And since one of them informed them that their work wasn't needed...it could only mean they showed up to have a chat about the resistance movement. Now, Bobby may have not pushed them into it, but that didn't make him any less of a member and just because he was part of the movement, that didn't make him any less Dean and Sam's adoptive father. So wrapped up in the movement, John had pretty much shoved his sons onto Bobby—and Ellen and Jo, later on—whenever he had the chance to and they'd come to love him so much that Dean would die to keep him kicking one more day. So, Dean spun around on his heel, machete clenched in hand, as if that would help if the angels decided to attack. Sure, he would die, but at least he wouldn't have to watch another father die because angels have some kind of complex or whatever possessed them to take over the world.
were. But he did stand up to his full height and turned around so that he could study Castiel’s face and the dude actually looked sincere. Dean replayed every word that Castiel had ever said to him and started to think that maybe,
"When aren't we?" Sam retorted with a smirk. "I have a better one, though." Dean's brows lifted. "My fiancée and I want to settle down in our own place. My brother lives with us and he's a pain in our ass. I think that should get us some brownie points, don't you?"
Whatever it was that exploded inside of him was too damn much to hold back and he reached out to wrap a hand around the back of Castiel’s neck before he pulled him forward to crush their lips together. He had no idea if the angel even knew how to kiss, but goddamn it, if he died tomorrow—which was a pretty good possibility at that point—he wanted to make sure he had kissed that fucking angel of the Lord.
John had been dead for four years and Pastor Jim, who had become second-in-command of the resistance movement in the wake of John's death, continued to hound Dean and Sam about joining up with them. Someone would think they would take a hint after four years, but they tried and tried again. A few other people close to his father had stopped by, such as Tara who'd even stooped so low as to say, "if your daddy could see you now." Dean may or may not have slammed the door in her face because he never asked for what John put on him and Sam. Ever since he found out his father started a resistance movement in Kansas, Dean would lay awake at night sometimes, unable to sleep because he knew angels would come after them at some point. The angels had taken enough from them, he wanted to scream at his father and the people of the resistance, why couldn't they leave it alone? The world could've turned out a lot shittier.
Dean had only heard rumors about what happened to people who were punished by angels and if they were anything to go bad, Elizabeth didn’t have much of a life ahead of her. But it wasn’t like there was much he could do considering he was on the heavenly shit list, too. All he could do was hope that Castiel was right and that the angels would show come kind of compassion toward Elizabeth.
"Hello." A blonde woman smiled at them and stepped outside so that she could close the door behind her. In the background, Dean spotted a brunette in the hall scramble to head into another room. "How can I help you the two of you today?"
It dawned on Dean that, yeah, most of them had sticks up their asses, but the angels that ruled over the Earth were a whole lot like one
Rather than acknowledge Sam's taunt—because Dean Winchester did not pout about shit—he tried to move onto a conversation more relevant to his interests. "Hey, smart ass in the kitchen, you said the archbishop had a heart attack, right?" He didn't wait for her to answer. "Does that mean we don't have mass tomorrow?" Because, seriously, who wanted to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to listen to some dude rant on and on about how humans needed to be better for God.
Dean reeled back and punched Sam in the shoulder. "Ha ha," he scoffed. "You're hilarious." Then, he had another idea. “How about we be lost instead? Haven’t done that one in a while, right?”
