Authors note:
Dean looked away.
Dean looked at him incredulously. “Oh, so I’m your bullet shield.” He commented.

“Maybe I will quit hunting, I don’t know.” His brother responded positively as the three of them went to grab their shoes. “I like the idea of not worrying about getting caught and risk going back to prison every time I work a case.”
your cousin and why did he lie about his name?” She questioned him. “Who was that other German guy he was arguing with?”
The two brothers sighed in unison.
Sam laughed quietly. “My brother says the same thing.” He commented.
Sam, though, couldn’t help being annoyed at all of them for it.
He knew that it wasn’t Dean’s intention to give that impression, but his pride wasn’t immune to the insults (unintentional or not) that he was subject to today. He wasn’t just a little punk, vermin, or a kid. The oldest Winchester brother was being treated like he was younger than even their initial lie intended as.
“Hello, boys.” She answered.
He appeared to be around twenty-three or twenty-four, or perhaps closer to twenty-two, depending on who one asked.
. It correlated with what War had hinted to them, seemed directly more toward Dean, to ask about the younger kid’s blood.
“Just, now I realize something. I don’t trust me either.”
“I have the time, so just freaking tell me already!”
“Yeah, are you?” Dean answered.
“Especially without my brother right now. I mean, I spent so much time worrying about the son of a bitch. I mean, I’ve had more fun with you in the past twenty-four hours than I’ve had with Sam in years,” Dean answered then smiled faintly, “and you’re not that much fun. It’s funny, you know, I’ve been so chained to my family, but now that I’m alone, hell, I’m happy.”
He said, though peeved, yet his worry overcame the annoyance in his voice, hoping it would get past Sam’s overly inflated ego. “
are injured; they won’t last out there.”
“What? No.” His namesake lied. “Samuel wasn’t covering for me, he just finished up work.”
“I thought someone should go out and see what’s going on!” War kept up the act, looking fearful toward the time-travelers. “What’s wrong with those two? None you can seriously believe them, right? They’re crazy!”
She looked up at her name being mentioned.
“Anyways, I’m in Berlin, around—”
“He’s not saying yes to Lucifer. I’ll make sure of it.” She said stubbornly. “Unlike me, Sammy has a chance to have a life without hunting. He can still take his bar exam and make his namesake proud.”
Just when Sam thought he was free from Dean’s control over him, he was tricked into being controlled by a demon he trusted, who had a whole plan to gain his trust. Did Ruby truly care about him in the first place? Of course not! Did she really think him freeing Lucifer would give him freedom and paradise?
“What about me? I don’t know.” The older Winchester said. “Honestly, I’m good. I can’t believe I'm saying that, but I am, I’m really good.”
24 “Not Michael, right?”
He found the passage he was looking for and read it out loud.
“Well, I ain’t running any marathons, but I’ll live.”
Dean leaned away. “Whoa.” He said.
“Look, I’ll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts,” the older Winchester said, “but I do know a little something about missing fathers.”
She smiled as she stood up, along with her husband, and gestured for the two Winchester siblings. “I need to go check something,” Dan said vaguely, then walking over to by the front door, and grabbed the older Winchester sibling’s bag, and brought it over.
“What are you talking about?!”
Hope everyone enjoyed this chapter!
“People, cease fire!” Rufus called out, behind the other man. “Stop shooting, stop!” The older hunter grabbed the gun from the other man and slammed him in the head with it. “I’m getting too old for this.” He commented, frustrated. The other young man aimed out of the window at the pastor and the young woman, who ran for shelter behind a trailer. The pastor came out and the other young man fired, and the bullet went right through the pastor, who fell.
“Yeah, sure. Talk here, though.” Framingham said, indicating his right ear and led them to his office. “Hearing’s all blown to hell in this one.”
1 “Goddamnit, what are you thinking, Sammy?!”
The younger of the two stood up. “
She rolled her eyes as he turned around, facing the older hunter, pushing against Dean’s grip. “Rufus! The polluted water, the shooting star, the red Mustang—it's War.” He tried to reason with the older man. “I’m telling you, it’s War.”
“Samuel, are you okay?” He asked, helping the young man up, who took a deep breath and nodded. “Go find your brother and Rebekah. I’ll take care of Lindsay.” His namesake continued, and Samuel looked down at his revolver in his left hand, putting it back in his pocket as the excitement left his mind, and hurrying out of the entrance.
“Sunrise.”
They decided to regroup and go different directions to cover more ground.
How was
The other young man fired again, missed, and aimed more carefully. Ellen approached, and pressing something to the pastor’s wound, making the young woman look up.
He wondered if this is how Dean felt when he gave his older brother that look.
“I didn’t mean any of that bullshit I said earlier.  I guess I’m just tired, but taking my frustration out on you won’t help anything. I’m sorry.” The taller young man said with a sigh. “When we return to the present, I’ll go pick up my Lithium and Xanax from the pharmacy in Palo Alto. I think they still have it from a few weeks ago.”
She put her hands up in frustration.
This was intended to be one single chapter covering 5x2, but this alone has 27 pages after a few months off writing this (with off and on writers block), so I’m gonna break it into the last part. I’ll be fitting at least some of the original chapter five and the rest of that will finish up into the original chapter six.
Samuel scowled.
Regretfully, Rufus (with black eyes) was closing on them and they fled. “At least we got you, kid.” He said, as looked at the futuristic hunter, making Sam wish he didn’t let Jo catch him off guard in the first place.
The young man cursed himself for not realizing that Dean and Rebekah’s misinformation about his intricate nature could also be believable to the hero Sam, and of course, the hero Dean probably believed it to. He loved his family, honestly, but they didn’t understand him at all sometimes and their irrational version of it
“That definitely counts.” Dean said, then getting up and walked over to the bookshelf, and picked a Bible out of it. He bought it back to the table and searched through it.
“What are you, a demon? Is that why you’re protecting him?” He asked viciously, one arm holding the young man against the wall and the other reaching to choke him, and Samuel realized that his namesake left his sight. “What’s this ‘namesake’ bullshit?”
This is the longest chapter that I’ve written for this story yet and the tags of it will be updated.
His older sister sighed irritably. “What about American dollars, Danny? Can’t we turn those in for euros?” She suggested, then reaching into her dress pocket, and pulling out her wallet to count the dollars in it. “If my math is right, then $20 will get me €17 euros, right? I’ll be fine, alright?”
Dean felt terrible for his namesake, ever since hearing the story when he went to Hell and heard only bits of surviving pieces of the story as a kid. He wasn’t close enough to be noticed immediately, but he was within hearing range.
“That’s what I mean, Samuel. Somehow if you were groomed to take my place in the future, then I didn’t say yes to Lucifer, right?” Sam reasoned with the boy, who shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. “You paid for my mistakes! Dude, that’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair that your brother’s paying for Dean’s.”
“Open up! It’s Roger!” The voice on the other end.
He thought.
She looked at him decisively. “No, unless it’s the only option left. If it means that the world is safe and Sammy doesn’t have to say yes, then I’ll consent.” She said determinedly. “Sam probably said the same thing as me, didn’t he?”
Admittedly, he had only known the kid for a week and half, and after practically living with him, he quickly learned that Samuel had a fragile ego and a need for constant attention. Honestly, this tendency of his could seriously get him hurt or even killed if he angered the wrong hunter at the wrong time.
Dean and his three siblings, two older than him, were taught how to do this back all starting at the young age of seven, when their father was taught at the same age. It was like second nature to him among other skills many little kids weren’t being taught at home, like how to shoot and kill monsters.
of pain and guilt, and in his successful attempt to relate with the younger Winchester once more, they were more alike than Sam thought. It made him think back to when the younger-looking kid admitted to how unclean his father made him and his twin feel, like they couldn’t be trusted to use their own judgments, it made him sick at how poorly this kid and his twin were treated because of demon blood they had no choice in being fed.
The German American Winchesters were sitting over in a corner area as Dean had disinfected her shoulder wound and begun to stitch it up at his brother’s insistence. Sam could wait on having his shoulder popped back into place as he graciously took a Vicodin with the sip of whiskey he had left in his flask in the meantime. Usually Rebekah wasn’t quick to take a painkiller, but she didn’t waste any time taking one as soon as they sat down in the corner.
He asked himself.
“Raphael.” Present Cas acknowledged.
“It’s got to be.” Ellen said as she knocked on the door. “It’s me.”
It looked like the younger-looking hunter was about to look up again.
like his brother when it came to lack of self-control and not thinking before acting, from Dean learned after hunting with her for about a year. It was no wonder the couple hunted well together but had more a tendency to get injured together as well sometimes.
She struggled with sleep apnea, postpartum depression, and had chronic health problems. As a result, Klaus (who already wasn’t around much) had picked up a second job to help pay the bills since she couldn’t work and left the kids either with his parents when they were small. Although the family wasn’t hunting, young Samuel was already caring for his younger siblings when he started primary school at grade 6 at a local Montessori school. Klaus and Hanna were seldom around, and aside from the retired hunter grandparents, Samuel was the only consistent family member they could rely on.
“Okay, all right.” He said.
“Look, listen to me, something’s not right!” He called over at them. “If you don’t want to let me go, at least let him go! Can’t you see why what you’re doing isn’t working?”
Right before the seraph headed off, Sam looked at his brother. “You should be honest about your name as well, Dean. It shouldn’t jeopardize the past too much if you use it.” He said, knowing how overly cautious his younger brother could be.  “Of course. Letting them know about our first names shouldn’t compromise our safety.” He answered, feeling terrible for not thinking of how hard it would be for the heroes Sam and Dean to trust hunters they didn’t know, especially if they didn’t even reveal their real first names. “We’ll be fine.”
Hope the translations are correct.
Dean seemed to be deep thought for a moment. “Of course. How about you’re our sister?” He suggested. “We can say you’re our step-sister or adopted sister. It makes sense you’d keep the same last name as us.”
“Actually, I’d rather get killed than allow more people to die because I let somebody bench me. I’ve hunted with worse injuries, so there’s no reason to think my shoulder would stop me.” He said bluntly and stubbornly, feeling a bit insulted by her as he stood up with one of his expected attention-seeking monologues. “If something as insignificant as shoulder pain would prevent me from hunting, I’d think myself pathetic and embarrassed to call myself a hunter.”
demons! We heard a few other weird things, too, how is death not a ‘permanent thing’ for them?”
Samuel smiled back. “
“Demons happened. I’m not sure of the origin yet.” The younger man, noticeably pale, answered in a European accent full of distress with his face covered in sweat, clearly exhausted with a worried look toward the girl. “They’re everywhere. One of those demonic bastards nearly killed my sister here.”
As for the original statement:
“Hey, Keith, you play?” She called over at him.
“I’m your grandfather,
much. “Come on, then. Somebody should have room for an extra person wherever we end up at.” He said grateful but honestly needing alone time. “You have money for a motel room somewhere, dude? I need a shower and some sleep.”
Emma doubted that they would make any that would be able to tolerate Sam as her
“Yeah, that was, that was hilarious.” Dean answered, mouthing back humorously despite the intimidations. “If I put the kid Samuel in the caged ring with Zachariah, that bastard would get his ass kicked.”
“Saying it twice don’t make it so, Sam. You see, this demon, he, uh, he told us things.” The older hunter continued. “Crazy things, things about you, Sam.”
“God? Didn’t you hear? He’s dead, Castiel. Dead.” Raphael answered unexpectedly.
“Coffee, please.” Sam said.
“We’re fine. It’s just a few flesh wounds.” Rebekah answered vaguely, glancing a concerned look at her taller, silent, and moping brother as they walked into the church, toward the stairs. She looked over at her older brother.
” Samuel muttered.
Reggie held a knife up to Lindsay’s neck. “Let him go.” He demanded.
Earlier, Sam helped the time-travelers dispose of the bodies and got his backpack from the motel room. He carjacked a moderately worn out vehicle from the motel parking lot and dropped Lindsay off somewhere discreet. He felt terrible for the psychological harm he’d caused her, only by showing his in Garber. He felt like just a profound apology and disappearing wasn’t enough, but there was nothing he could do.
Did Chuck plan for them to ‘escape’ and end up here?
Sam realized his mistake when he saw the strange glances his and Dean’s namesakes gave him upon his effort to comfort Rebekah. He knew that mistakes would be made, yet he didn’t expect himself to tune out of their surroundings in comforting his wife.
She shook her head. “I don’t know much about them. They were already here when the attack happened, and already prepared, it looked like.” She said suspiciously. “So, this is it, right? End of times?”
That concept of trusting his own judgment frightened Samuel on the inside, yet he felt his overwhelming compulsion to follow his namesake’s moral advice. How could he
“A deputy sheriff laid eyes on the archangel.”
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
“They took both of them? Demons took them?” The pregnant woman asked, panicked. “Oh my God. What if they’re in here? The demons?”
” She spoke up in her lack of complete fluency in German, and he seemed to relax little with their help.
“Where are you now?”
“If you ever get arrested and charged with any crimes in L.A., I’ll be your public defender or if it’s somewhere else, I’ll refer somebody I or Rebekah trust to represent you.” Sam said, smiling faintly back. "When Lucifer’s stopped, screw what your namesake would do and have the normal life you’ve always wanted, too, Dean. You won’t have to worry about getting arrested or going back to prison if you’re not a hunter.”
The older kid shook his head. “Yeah, that’s what the bastard wants us to do. I didn’t remember that detail until I thought I killed a demon—not Jo, I promise you—but the usual effect of the knife didn’t show.” He said remorsefully. “I-I killed a person, I believe.”
“It’s Rebekah. Your brother gave me your number and I need to update you on what’s going on our end of things. Sam—
“Jesus fucking Christ, just go get help! You’ll get caught, too, if you stay. What good would that do anybody?!” He yelled at them, making them realize how truly screwed they would be if they got themselves caught as well. “Go find the hero Sam and Ellen already, for fuck’s sake!”
Things take an unexpected turn as they investigate a town overrun by demons when they meet three suspicious people claiming to be time-travelers. Two of them coincidentally have the same first names as the boys and a sister named Rebekah.
“But I will take him to Michael.” Raphael countered. “You
His namesake and Rebekah sighed.
Dean was pacing whilst the pastor sat at the table with the older woman, short-haired man, and the young woman. The pregnant woman lay on a cot and the young man sat next to her whilst Austin stood near them.
not draw more attention to yourself?”
“Cas.” Dean answered for him and the angel startled. “His name is Cas. What’s your name?”
The woman gestured at the three hunters.  “He called you Sam.” She pointed out.
His namesake paused and hesitated to speak for a moment.
and we’re still calling Rebekah by her name; we need a last name. I’m not lying to our namesakes’ more than I have to.”
Ellen walked between them in the direction they came from.
“Don’t know yet.” Steve answered.
I probably spent more time researching for this part of the story than I should have, but I wanted to be extra safe and I hope I didn't write anything offensive or stereotypical. That and having writer's block recently, so thankfully, I already have ideas for my futuristic characters in the next chapter!
She became family to him, and he would rather give his life for her and his siblings rather than allow them to die. Unfortunately, he couldn’t reason with her, and he had made sure she didn’t get herself killed. Now was the time to fight, and he considered it necessary that Dean made the initial mistake of revealing too much information. He realized they were sharing too little with people in the past, especially with their namesakes and the Harvelle’s.

She rolled her eyes. “God forbid you get bored.” She quipped dryly.
He asked, feeling warm because his ego was fed well, and he was proud of his brother, who answered promptly, “
Thank you for reading, subscribing, and bookmarking this story as usual. Just like in the previous chapter, there’s mention of addiction, suicidal ideation, self-harm, the Gadreel plotline, Sam’s Cage trauma, Lucifer mentions, suggestion of involuntary commitment, and emotional abuse, also mentions of child neglect and physical abuse. This story will get a lot heavier in these topics henceforth, any additional trigger warnings will be put in the tags and before each chapter.
disturbing, and then realized that he and Dean would (and have) done the same for each other if it came down to it, but killing another hunter was something they avoided. Maybe Samuel wasn’t as different from him as he seemed and maybe his arrogant behavior was hiding something much less intimidating and disagreeable. Something painful.
As for the original statement:
4 “Don’t you fucking start on that, Sammy. You don’t control what happens in the past, present, or future, and if you did, I’d hate to be one of your enemies.”
Who was he, and how did he know all of this?
Updated authors note (12\16\20):
Rebekah was in deep thought about altering the past when the grandmother spoke up toward her. “Rebekah, do you need to lay down?” She asked.
“The Horseman. War.”
“Please!”
“Hold on, Sam—”
It bothered him immensely that the hunter would die as well, and the boy explained calmly in his extremely limited set of emotions that no matter what they do, some people will die. Also, that it wasn’t worth risking the lives of family for somebody who they might not save that served them no purpose, although the kid didn’t phrase it that cruelly.
The boy, based on knowing him for a few weeks now, came off to Sam as somebody who was hiding
Sam was ready for an attack anytime now, although the time-travelers informed him that it wouldn’t be until after he closed the bar. The other two were at the motel, who were waiting until after closing to assist in as look-outs, who reluctantly decided to heed future Cas’ warnings and not change more than they had to. The decision to let a hunter a die wasn’t difficult for Samuel to make and it was easy for him, given that he shown no empathy for the man who would die. D and Rebekah, though, were reasoned out of going for strategic reasons that were in their favor.
Sam knew that War had them fooled when Rufus saw them. “Shut your mouths!”
He thought worriedly, concerned for him and the kid getting out of there alive.
Quickly thinking, Sam pulled out Ruby’s knife and stabbed the demon in the neck and didn’t notice the normal side-effects of the knife used on the demon. The blood on it and on the floor was enticing, and he looked at it intensely.
“So...you gonna tell me who those guys back there really were? And don’t say hunting buddies. Is Samuel
The boys could overhear the loud argument between the other pair of brothers from the picnic table they sat at. Sam and Dean could make out only a couple of words (technically names), and those were
At least Emma wasn’t as irritable and irrational as Sam was when he was still a blood junkie, and she didn’t get into homicidal mood swings, like he did. Emma could get clean from demon blood if he could. Either way, complaining about what-ifs and the injustices that their family had endured would only waste time. It wasn’t like he didn’t appreciate having a break and unwind for a little while, but the urgency of the situation made Danny too anxious to enjoy his break from the family business.
“So do you. Look, Keith.” She said with kindness in her tone to match the seriousness in it. “I don’t know you and I’m the last person to be giving advice, but I do know that no one has ever done anything so bad that they can’t be forgiven. That they can’t change.”
The kid, though, seemed to have a plan of his own.
The boy sighed, clearly remorseful. “I’m not purposely trying to hide things from you. I didn’t want you to think I’m mentally incompetent for needing them.” He said, meeting the younger Winchester’s eyes with shame. “I promise, no more secrets, as my brother occasionally says to brighten serious moment, no chick flick moments.”
“Do as my—
“No,” their grandmother said in concern as their grandfather sighed, “what’s going on?”
“Hey, man, why did you defend me back there?” He asked.
He nodded. “Yeah, of course. They don’t believe that I trust them, but I do trust them.” He answered indignantly, then sighed in frustration in his quiet tone. “I trust you and my brother’s namesake just as much, and…You’re my namesake, so if you have advice, I’ll do my best to adhere to it.”
Thank you for any leavings of kudos, bookmarking, and subscriptions. I’ve been watching a lot of Criminal Minds lately and I’m working through season three now in between my online classes. Episode five, “Seven Seconds,” is primarily what helped with my recent writer’s block.
They noticed a welcoming banner hanging over the street to the town’s Pioneer Days and paused for a moment upon noticing a red classic Mustang that Dean expectantly admired and whistled with approval. Sam checked it and saw it was empty, and they were about to move on when they heard footsteps approach them. It was a couple, young man, and woman, probably two or three years, or maybe four years younger than Sam.
“Listen!”
The time-travelers had become on the edge upon hearing that voice, and the kid named after Dean had a murderous look on his face. Austin checked the peephole and opened the door.
The tall kid looked at her with visible concern mixed with frustration.
Nobody was expecting the younger Wolff brother to stand up and state why he wasn’t giving up, like he was expecting a Nobel Prize for it. The kid was driven, that was for sure, and so was Rebekah. Dean could’ve gone without listening to the short monologue, though. Sam thought a bit longer about what they could do; he could save figuring the tall kid out later. “What if we get everyone guns?” He suggested to the group, and his brother replied, “What, are you gonna arm up baby bump over here?”
“What kind of disturbance?” Dean asked.
“World peace.”
“Oh, like I care about your feelings, you little infernal thing.” War taunted, chuckling. “You can’t stop thinking the blood dripping off your knife earlier, can you?”
Rufus looked to each side.
Austin expertly disassembled the gun.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches.” He said determinedly. “I’m gonna hunt him down, Dean.”
Danny picked up his beer and took a large gulp of it in defeat and Emma stood up.
I apologize for the inconsistent updates and inconsistencies within the story that will be fixed.
Tim nodded to Reggie, who put it down on one of the tables, keeping his hold on Lindsay.
let Lucifer out, and because of that, it was up to him to fix it one way or another. There was always a way to do it.
I had no clear direction for this story in the beginning, having had to go back a few times in the past few months to fix grammar errors, etc. I’ve been reading about how to improve my writing and become a better writer, especially being less wordy and more straight-forward.
Of course, not everything was his fault, given that many parts of his soul wasn’t functional.
He glanced over at Sam, surprised by the younger Wolff brother’s admission.
German translations:
“You’re insane,” his namesake snapped at the roughed-up hunter.
“We should probably start with figuring out if there’s any demons who followed us,” he said, turning toward Emma.
matter!
Danny gave her a matter-of-fact look. “You have powers, Emma, and I don’t even have a useful weapon.” He complained. “We can’t risk letting people think we’re criminals
“Kids, let’s keep moving.” She called toward the Wolff siblings.
Dean looked over at Castiel. “Let us get our shoes on and grab our duffel bags, we’re ready to go.” He answered as stoically as usual, but with a clear gratitude for the angel in his tone as his older brother turned to him with a remorseful look on his face, like a puppy upset that their owner was sad about something they did as he often came across to people when seldom feeling guilty.
“What stuff?”
“Shoot.” The older-looking hunter said as he wiped his hands down on the cloth and tossed it at the bar whilst Lindsay retrieved the darts. He noticed Samuel look over at her skeptically, hiding his glances behind the book in front of his face.
“What do you want me to say?” His namesake demanded.
At the dining room table, there was tension and frustration between all three people. There were three small duffel-bags by each person’s feet at the table, where all three had a pair of house slippers on over their socks. “Couldn’t we have booked a later flight?” A young man said in English with distress in his German accent. He was by the far the tallest out of all three at the table with ebony black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin dressed in a black Henley shirt and black skinny jeans. “We would’ve been fine if we waited fifteen minutes!”
Cas shut up, now realizing he used the wrong words at the wrong time.
The older Winchester thanked the deputy.
Despite this fic taking place in season five, season eight and especially the finale has helped with improving of Samuel’s character in terms likability and originality. Ironically enough, The Originals has provided more inspiration in continuing this effort and watching Brave New World has helped as well.
This chapter is inspired by CM 5x9 mostly in the last eleven minutes of the episode. Spoilers for the episode at the bottom of the chapter, for anybody who hasn’t (and isn’t) going to see it, that explain where the inspiration came from. I am fucking in love with CM, by the way, not that it’s relevant here. I’m referring to the CM glossary site for terms like ‘blitz attack.’
“No, you’re doing this.” He argued.
“Chasity.” The woman answered.
“I’m sorry.” His namesake truly apologized once more.
“We had to, Sam.” The other young man at the table said in English with a solemn pitch in his soft German accent. He was by the far the second tallest out of all four at the table with soft black hair, brown eyes, and fair skin dressed in a buttoned-up blue and white flannel shirt and loose blue jeans. “Emma and Danny said they’ll call Oma and Opa when they get here. Castiel should be here soon.” He looked about two or three years older, or maybe four years older, than the taller man at the table.
He glanced back over at Sam as Ellen lowered her gun and walked closer. “Ellen, what the heck’s going on here?” Dean asked her, surprised as well. She splashed him with holy water from a flask she drew from her jacket and raised her gun.
In the case of this story, Sam realizes that Samuel has a limited capacity of understanding non-familial relationships, despite faking those emotions for years when he must. That’s where Sam comes in, he helps the kid named after him to understand concepts like that foreign to him.
Dean was on the phone with present Cas.
It was also strange that Sam gave his brother the demon killing knife, but the other two futuristic Winchesters had their suspicions on
“Yeah. Call your brother and get him to get mine here.” He demanded furiously, despite his suspicion about why the boy named his brother wanted to go alone with him. “I don’t care that the kid needs alone time with Sam. He doesn’t know he put my brother in danger, does he?”
6 “No, don’t be ridiculous, Dean!”
I just said?”
“I know you could. But I can’t. I’m sorry.” Sam apologized, then improvised, “He’s a cousin of my and Dean’s from Germany. His dad used to be in the business.”
“What are you going to do about Lucifer?” Angelika asked them with concern.
Rufus looked back over his shoulder at both tied up hunters.
He was sure that Emma grabbed her bag from her old room, too, so neither of them had to go back in.
“Look, Sam—it doesn’t matter—whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we’re the, uh, the fire and the oil of the Armageddon.” Dean said sadly with emotion in his voice. “You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good.”
The angel of the Lord, Castiel appeared in front of them at the table.
The main priority was rescuing Sam and his namesake, and then, take out War.
“Where’s my brother and his namesake?”
After that whole ordeal with Raphael, Dean was driving, and present Cas was in the passenger’s seat. He had just received a call from D, who informed him of everything that occurred that night, while they were getting the hell out of Oklahoma before the cops could catch them.
As for the original statement:
A trio of time-travelers contemplate their plan to go into the past and help their ancestors, Sam and Dean Winchester.
If there's still any inconsistencies, grammar errors, etc, that need fixed, please let me know and I'll fix it.
“Think about it. He needs all the rebellious angels he can find. You know it adds up.”
He thought, conflicted and full of shame.
Emma and Danny arrive in Germany and improvise a plan on how to deal with Lucifer. With Sam, Dean, Rebekah in the past, Emma and Danny are at a standstill and try to figure out why the present hasn’t changed at all. Old wounds from their childhood are reopened when investigating for leads on Lucifer doesn’t go as planned.
“Emma, you won’t say yes to Lucifer, right?” Dan asked his granddaughter.
He remained silent and more pensive.
“I don't know. A—a little panic? Maybe?” Sam attempted to reason with him taken aback by this response. “Or fighting against the altered reality Zachariah wants to take you, too? They just want you to see things their way!”
2 “Now, I’ve let my namesake down! How will he forgive me, even if he wants to?”
For anybody who has read the original Progenitor King, does anyone notice any differences in Samuel’s character? Is he a bit more likeable than in the previous, or seem any less apathetic than before?
Any fellow Hannibal fans might recognize the tidbits of that influence in this fic, but the source material of the fic won’t change. All I want to do is improve my fic and once more special thanks to @misha-moose-dean-burger-lover for beta reading, supplying suggestions on Tumblr. I still haven’t heard from @mystic-voyanger (sorry if I misspelled the url!) on Tumblr, who also gave suggestions and quite helpful input, but I want to thank them, too.
“Wait, wait, wait. What?” Dean said, looking over the time-travelers, believing them; they hadn’t been wrong about anything else so far, but maybe their memory had been fuzzy on a few details. “
The young man looked only a few years younger than him, maybe about twenty-two or twenty-three, with an honest look on his face. Meekly following behind him, like he trusted Sam wholeheartedly.
The younger Winchester rolled his eyes at the childish argument and had been about to speak up when Rebekah looked back at the two time-travelers. “I think I saw a rest stop ahead, guys.” She said, glancing at Sam, realize he was awake. “I need caffeine and someone to buy Ambien from.”
, as the kid suggested.
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
His face fell as he realized it.
okay?” Rebekah asked the younger kid.
War faked panic and fear, effectively able to fool Rufus and Jo. “Both of them said they’re coming!” He said in faux frantic tone. “Both of them said they’re coming to get us!”
“I hope they have strong coffee.” Rebekah said, then heading toward the flickering lights.
As for the original statement:
“I don’t care! Either tell me what it is or put him on.”

Dean hung up the phone and he felt like drinking until he’d pass out. All this Apocalypse business couldn’t get more complicated than it was right now, and he prayed in his mind for Cas. He needed to see the angel, and to see the face of the trench-coat wearing Cas who would give him to relief he needed
“What happened?” Sam asked, wondering if one of the Wolff siblings were psychic to possibly know beforehand what happened in the town if they were lying about Cas telling them everything. He doubted they were.
“Yeah, and he’s probably worried out of his mind about us.”
Dean and present Cas were at St. Peter’s hospital to summon, and trap, Raphael to get answers from him about God. In the older Winchester’s opinion, it wasn’t worth all that time. If God were to help, and if he were benevolent like believers often said, why didn’t he ever help any of them. What was with future Cas, though? He shook those thoughts from his head as he watched a nurse go down the hallway and slipped into Donnie’s—Raphael’s old vessel—room and shut the door behind him and closed the shades. Present Cas was already inside and poured holy oil in a circle around Donnie’s wheelchair.
Even though their father would take back his harsh words, a lot of other hunters
“Wait, just back up. It’s the apocalypse?” The pastor asked, taken aback.
It was outrageous, even John would frown on starting the training as young as seven! Dean’s father was no saint but taking a twelve-year-old to hunt vampires was something John
? Doesn't that mean something like wolves and battle?” The older of the two brothers suggested with a smug smile. “I’m the most feared in this family after all.”
“No, he doesn’t believe he did. He believes himself capable of protecting your brother, and to be fair, he protected me and Danny throughout out childhood.” The older boy defended, though sympathetic in his tone. “He protected Rebekah at Stanford, so I believe that he’s more than capable. I tried to tell him that we should inform you first, though, but I’m sure you know by now that he’s stubborn.”
The angel didn’t say anything.
There’s something odd about the other Sam.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam shook his head. “No, he’s not. How about he adopted you after, say, your parents died in a hunting accident and you had no other relatives able to take you in after we moved to the States? It’s a more interesting cover than usual.” He suggested after a moment of thinking. “The other ones are getting boring.”
Only sixteen years ago, the four of the siblings were ten, eight, and six. They were so innocent, compared to now, just learning how to hunt the supernatural. There wasn’t anything like that Apocalypse, or getting rid of Lucifer, back then. It was just about finding the yellow-eyed demon Azazel, and saving Hanna, nothing like how things were now.
What danger was Sam in anyhow?
The youngest Winchester moaned. “Michael only ever answers to Sam, and you’d think he’d at least pay attention to Dean since Michael brought him back to life.” He pointed out. “Does he like Sam better than the rest of us, or what?”
Initially nervous, Samuel bounced back gracefully with an excuse.
Their grandfather came in the room. “You both are giving me a headache and your oma’s sleeping, don’t forget.” He told them firmly, then his tone lightened. “You can deal with your culture shock without waking her or giving me a headache, can’t you?”
“Honestly, people don’t need a reason to kill each other.” War replied. “I mean, you seen the Irish? They’re all Irish.”
Emma sighed. “Yeah, and things he hasn’t even acknowledged.” She answered sourly with weariness sinking in her tone, remembering how much her father had put her and her siblings through, although he kept all four of them safe. “I don’t want to talk about Dad anymore, Oma.” Her grandmother had a look of understanding on her face. “Okay. I’m here if you need to talk, Emma.” She said considerately. “He won’t hear anything about the blood, and far as he’ll know, you’re here to come up with a plan.”
He stopped with his hand on the door knob and looked back, and grimaced. Dean headed back over toward the table, and the two kids followed him. He glanced back at them for a moment.
----------
literally did Samuel mean ‘take his place’? God, the younger Winchester hoped it didn’t mean what he thought it did. They had the same height, but outside of that, nothing else in common in appearance. Samuel had a rather lanky build and he dressed in all black, and his lawyer haircut starting to grow out.
“Fallujah. Two tours. Got back a little over a year ago.” Austin answered. “Takes one to know one. Where’d you serve?”
Rebekah sighed, and resisted say anything to make the younger of the two futuristic Winchester brothers less hopeful. She’d never been religious in her life, though her biological family was heavily involved with a church for some time until she was around two years old.
Sam and the kid were alone, wondering when they would be rescued for God knew how long so far. The door opened and it was Dean, and the two time-travelers. He never seen younger kid never looked more relieved than he was now.
“So, odds are you’re a dead man tomorrow.” He concluded, shoving that thought of his mind, then present Cas confirmed his fear.
“What business?”
Emma snorted. “It’s what the hero Sam would do.” She defended.
He thought, then figuring that he could quickly win the game and get this over with.
“Dean didn’t tell you?”
He knew that he was strange, even for hunter standards.
Cas wasn’t answering any of his prayers and it was pissing him off.
The younger Winchester did wish that Jessica survived the fire, but he wouldn’t wish the hunting life on her, and he wondered if Jess would have joined the family business. Her and Rebekah were vastly different people, and he doubted his deceased girlfriend would embrace the life like Rebekah did.
“I like it,” she commented further.
German translations:
I decided to reboot this story.
“You won’t believe me.” The kid answered with a defeated look in his eyes, widening with shame. “It’s true that Castiel informed us of when and where this attack would happen…. I’m from the future and I was named after you.”
Dean grabbed his jacket and walked toward the bed and put his jacket on. “How’d you find me this time? I thought I was flying below the angel radar.” He rubbed his ribs to show his point. “You find God yet? More importantly, can I have my damn necklace back, please?”
Sam didn’t want to bring it up; maybe his brother was just drunk when he’d said that, or maybe it was what he feared most, the older Winchester had been sober and had meant it. Perhaps he regretted saying it or he was waiting for the right moment to kill Sam when he wasn’t expecting it.
“So, the Roger everyone around here knows, the real Roger?” Sam demanded.
“Dean, it’s right there.” His namesake seemed quite exasperated and impatient himself, and the young man hoped that the hero Sam would snap his brother into reason, or else he’d snap and do it himself, regardless of who Dean’s namesake was. “Can we at least do this like professionals?” He raised his gun and unknowingly turned to the futuristic named after him. “If you want to stay with your brother and sister, I get it, man.”
What the hell did this man do to his kids?
“We can’t say,” D interrupted his brother as he was about to speak, “we’ve already intervened enough to disrupt the future, and if we tell you what happens, there’s the chance of giving you a false hope of them happening. We’ve already interfered enough.” His brother scoffed. “Dean, we should—” He tried to reason, but his brother shot him an irritated look. “I know we should, Sammy, but can’t you see how much has already changed?” He said, looking at Samuel with an urgent look. “There’s a chance we can be overheard, too!”
Sam Winchester's namesake and Rebekah go off on their own to check for more survivors, and both end up somewhat injured by the time they meet Sam and Dean. The two time-travelers make a few mistakes, though, that don't go unnoticed while the latter Winchester brother's namesake is out looking for them.
“I’ll be with you boys in a minute,” the young woman said, putting the coffee pot right back in place as she looked over toward the two of them. “Thanks,” Sam said as he and D headed toward a booth in the back whilst the other two came in, indicated by the chiming bell. He and the older-looking boy named after his brother sat next to each other whilst Samuel and Rebekah sat on the other side across from them. She was wearing his long-sleeved black button up shirt with purple stripes unbuttoned over her long-sleeved fuchsia pink sweater. It looked large enough to be a dress, reaching to her knees clad in loose light blue jeans.
Sam asked him, somewhat annoyed. “
“You were right. Major demon block party going on.” He confirmed.
How could somebody let strangers die without trouble and care too much about the lives of family to the point of risking their lives,
It was Sam. Who else would it be at quarter past four?
Yeah, Rebekah was his wife that he met in college and if they went with that cover, Samuel would be accused of being a manipulative, controlling, or verbally abusive husband. The kid apologized for not telling him sooner and said that he waited for the safest time to admit it.
“No, I’m trying to keep you safe. If they know that I have a bad side, then they suspect I could be a threat or assume that I’m overcompensating for a weakness. Even other hunters can be controlled with fear once they know who they’re up against.” Samuel reasoned in a serious manner, yet no concern for those hunters’ lives in his voice. “They’ll be less inclined to harm myself and my family unless they’re suicidal enough to try. More will be unlikely to try once word is spread that I
He was going over and talk some reason into Dean when the angel grabbed the younger Winchester’s shoulder, to stop him. “Let go of me,” he snapped at Cas, who gave Sam a look of concern, shoving the angels hand off him.
“But hey. Beers are on you when we get back.” Tim interrupted.
“Your brother’s name is Dean?” His namesake asked.
My apologies for taking so long to fix this chapter up, and I should be getting to fixing the next one soon. Hope you guys find that the fixes done in this chapter to be acceptable and didn't take away any of the appeal of the original text. If there's still any inconsistencies or grammar errors, etc, please let me know.
5 “Did Sam just compare himself to Lucifer?”
Anyhow, as many issues as Emma had with her twin, they lived under the hero Sam’s teachings (although they interpreted a few of the teachings differently), and lived by the family business motto,
Everyone else, except for Ellen, weren’t on board at all with the time-travelers claims or believed them about War putting everyone against each other. It was expected that they would be reviled for calling out War, and not believed.
He thought vengefully as he clenched his fist and fixed his shirt collar.
Someone had hammered on the door.
Sam woke up in the passenger’s seat of the car and glanced over at Rebekah driving, who seemed rather drowsy. He looked toward the voice of Samuel in the back, clearly irritable and tired.
“I know who you are. And now, thanks to him, I know where you are. However, you want to refer to them, those humans don’t belong here, and another angel will take them back, even if I do not.” The archangel said. “We will deal take care of getting the rogue angel Castiel becomes back to where he belongs as well.”
I should note that relevant details, such as previous fics that inspired this are still an inspiration to that one and previous outsider media influences remain a vital part of the reboot, mainly Criminal Minds and Dexter, but a recent outsider influence has infiltrated this fic, NBC's Hannibal and Heathers the Musical. The fic will stay true to Spn, of course, and I have a tendency to blend in outsider media influences, where I get most of my inspiration to write. I may or may not be throwing in new ideas, change certain things in the original chapters, or introduce certain things earlier in the reboot, so I hope those who check it out enjoy it.
Thank you all for putting up with my inconsistency and I'm sorry for this late notice on this work. I originally wrote this authors note with haste because I had to go and previously thought this one to be sufficient, for which all of you guys deserve more than that and I didn't mean to show any discourtesy. I apologize once more if I did offend anybody, I assure it's not intention. I probably didn't need to include those insignificant details, but I feel the need to explain why I should fix-up this authors note.
Peace wouldn’t remain when seven years later, when the twins were seven, Dean’s namesake was five, and Danny was three. Specifically, on the twins’ birthday, Azazel attempted to take Samuel and Emma once more, who had no idea of the supernatural, what he did to them, or how their mother actually died. Though Dean’s namesake was only five at the time, nor was he in the room, he knew what transpired based on his older brother’s first-hand account. Emma ran out of the room before Azazel could catch her, and the yellow-eyed demon grabbed Samuel’s shoulder to keep him from running, too.
“Fine, then let’s go.” The younger Winchester said, gesturing for the three siblings to go ahead of them and following up the stairs behind them.
The young man scolded himself for being such a ‘freak,’ as he frequently called himself. His siblings, and even Rebekah now, called him a narcissist amongst other things that implied he had an ‘inflated ego.’ His namesake even implied and told him to ‘knock it off,’ a few times, showing that they must’ve thought something was wrong with him.
“Do you believe the allegations, Oma?” She asked, feeling cornered with panic, as her eyes widened.
“Please! Come on!” Sam pleaded.
“I have a solution I think you’ll like.” Sam said. “Similar to how we met in college as strangers initially, instead when I left for eight years, you came with me and enrolled as well.” Dean shook his head. “Sammy, you were out for eight years and you didn’t require as much refresher training.” He said.
“Look, I’ve never had occasion, okay?” Present Cas admitted.
War laughed. “Oh, that’s adorable, considering you’re my poster boy.” He said.
“Wait, what?” He asked, though it’s not like anyone else knew beforehand.
4 “You’re safe, I swear. We’d never go back here if we weren’t.”
“It’s a long story.” Sam answered, knowing she wouldn’t give up on her goal.
Time to go back to the past.
She appeared shaken, reasonably the thought of War making his appearance, and he put his hand on her shoulder. “
“Bullshit! That wasn’t a misunderstanding. You wanted to get Sam alone for a reason, so what was it? I swear, you better tell me the damn truth this time, or I’ll kick your ass down to hell if I have to!”
4 “I know you’re trying to help, but you have no goddamn clue what’s like to fight this darkness flowing in my bloodstream and resist becoming what Lucifer wants me to be! Him and I share the same hatred of humanity, and sometimes I want to wipe out ninety-percent of the population just for the condemnation and pain to stop!”
Sam looked at the time-travelers and he agreed with what the calmer and more level-headed of the three futuristic Winchesters had to say. “There’s a chance that somebody might’ve seen us, and they could’ve reported it already,” he pointed out the obvious, “all of us need to lie low for a while.”
He suggested to keep the cops off their tail to just stay in one car, and they agreed.
As for the original statement:
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, come on, man.” The older Winchester said, trying to help present Cas understand that he needed sleep. “I just drove like sixteen hours straight, okay? I’m human. And there’s stuff I got to do.”
had conditioned you like this and took away what childhood you had left to be raised like soldiers.”
“Get that away from me.” The hero Sam told the older hunter.
He reluctantly pulled himself out of bed and answered the door to find his irate younger brother.
“What about you?” Present Cas asked.
, could you grab them a few beers?” He nearly slipped up and called the boy by his name.
“No.” Present Cas said vehemently.
“Dean, your brother is Lucifer’s perfect vessel, and Lucifer’s not above using Samuel as a back-up. You
What the hell was future Cas keeping from him?
“What, one of you psychic and you’re covering it up? I don’t buy that story, kid.”
She had a concerned look on her face.
He asked his older-looking younger brother with annoyance in his tone, putting the makeshift paper bookmark in the law book, and closing it in his irritation. “
Sam told him, looking at his younger with worry. “
The young woman at the table appeared more worried than anything else as she sighed. She had long, curly dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and tanned skin dressed in a simple light blue V-neck and light brown jeans, with a deep frown on her face. She looked around the same age as Sam was, or a little older, and was the shortest out of all three.
“Jerusalem.” The angel answered.
Rebekah groaned. “Just stop bitching already.” She muttered.
Rebekah sighed. “Yeah.” She said with a nod. “What about your names?”
“This is
“Buried in a ditch.”
Sam looked away whilst Samuel went back to his book, as if nothing out of the ordinary was reported, given the indifferent look on his face.
The younger Winchester shot him an exasperated look.
More suspicion is coming upon them, and as a result of their carelessness, they may be exposed sooner than imagined.
It was almost like the first time he exerted his dominance in nearly killing a hunter when him and Emma were attacked earlier in 2056 while he was still at Stanford, a remorseless act of brutal violence they didn’t see coming. The hero Sam would have to forgive him for this, there’s no reason why he wouldn’t for saving his life.
Dean considered it, then decided.
“So, uh, you think that all this comes from outer space?” Austin asked him.
Sam glanced over at his siblings.
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
His namesake, nor Lindsay saw this coming, and that’s what the young man reveled in.
There was a devil’s trap painted inside of the doorstep with a salt line across the still. Expectantly, all five of the hunters walked through without an issue, and Ellen turned the boys.
His brother’s voice brought out of his thoughts.
“You’re gonna go out again?” Dean asked his younger brother, knowing why he wanted to, but didn’t think it was a good idea with what just happened. “Well, crap doesn’t hit the fan with coffee breaks.” Sam retorted.
Is my research on green cards accurate? If not, please let me know, and I will fix any inaccuracies. On another note, I decided to throw in revelations in this chapter rather than wait until chapter three (the altered original chapter five) and have a large amount of revelations, like I did in the original.
-----------
The hunter paused and turned back, not thinking his, no,
“Show him Castiel some fucking respect, Sammy. He didn’t have to turn to us for help, and I’m sure he didn’t sign up to deal with your sacrilegious attitude!” Dean snapped at him, surprising the angel, given that the older-looking brother of the two had a very calm nature. “I don’t suppose a narcissist like you would care if he decided to not let us help at all now, right?”
When the younger Winchester and the time-traveler came it, a bell rang and they took notice of the worn-out green and pink paint peeling off the walls, and the ripped light brown leather seats on the booths upon walking in. It was quiet, even a few people working behind the counter were quiet, including the two other customers in there, given that drowsy atmosphere.
Whether the younger-looking boy was struggling with relapsing on demon blood, a common human addiction, or not, he probably didn’t want Sam to know about all the drugs he was buying a week or so ago, if that was the case. The younger Winchester wasn’t going to push him for details, Samuel would tell him whenever he was ready, if he needed to talk.
“Us? Demons? You’re the one with black eyes right now, not us.” He snapped back at her, prompting Dean to remember something. “I’d rather castrate myself than defile my mother’s memory by working with the monsters who killed her!”
Ellen shook her head and sat down next to the young woman, who passed her a water bottle.
He whispered, his brother cutting him off.
I wanted to try something to make the alternating POVs more organized and I thought that it might be a good idea to try flashbacks in between. Those will be in italic text, and I hope that it does make more sense than the way the past few chapters’ POVs have been alternated between.
The lives Emma saved with her powers was worth her body turning into something less than human as long as she still had her mind and her conscience.
The four of them were more concerned about dealing with Lucifer and didn’t even look at their menus. “Yeah, we should be ready to order in a few minutes,” D said, and she nodded, putting her notepad and pen back in the pocket. “Take your time,” she said, heading over toward a customer who just came in and sat down at one of the bar stools.
Rebekah slapped Samuel in the back of the head in response with overwhelming concern and frustration all over her face before the younger Winchester could respond. “Seriously, Rebekah?! What have my siblings been teaching you?!” He yelled at her irritably, rubbing the back of his neck. “That actually hurt.” His voice started to sound more like a whine.
“Oh, the kid? Little punk wore himself out.” Rufus said, glancing at the younger hunter tied up beside Sam. “Why do you care about him? Besides, don’t you got yourself to worry about?”
“Anything else? Anything.”
“You’re serious about this.” He said as the present Cas turned around to face Dean, and dropped the washcloth, and walked toward the angel. “So, what, I’m Thelma and you’re Louise and we’re just going to hold hands and sail off this cliff together?”
If that guy, whatever he was, hadn’t been a demon, then was Jo even possessed in the first place? Dean was confused for a moment, then he realized that he was forgetting something important.
“Very mysterioso.” Lindsay commented.
Dean scowled. “Well, that kid’s ego could get Sam killed!” He argued. “Call him.”
Before he could protest at this, and reason with his brother, Zachariah appeared in the room with holding a struggle Samuel’s arm. “You would leave without saying goodbye to your favorite pet, Dean? I sent the other two pets of yours back already.” The angel mocked him as the boy hopelessly tried to break Zachariah’s grip on his arm and glanced at the displeased time-traveler. “He’s a feisty little abomination, isn’t he?”
He called out for help and when Hanna came to her terrified son’s rescue, Azazel set the house ablaze, flaming rising between inside and outside of Samuel’s room. Little Danny were being carried out of the house by Klaus as he held Emma’s and Dean’s hands, then told them to go to one of the neighbors and ask them to call for the emergency services.
Sam laughed.
“No, man, we got people to protect. All right, the able-bodied go hunt some demons.” Austin said angrily, picking up a shotgun and handing it to the young man near him. “Roger’s right, what those two are saying is crazy and can you seriously believe them? They think an angel’s telling them the future and that they’re
“Move!”
The young man slowly nodded, both surprised and unsurprised by the response.
It was Dean, who sat his bags down.
Child Protective Services and its’ German equivalent,
Present Cas still did nothing until he noticed Dean’s stare, who pulled out his fake FBI ID, upside down. The hunter turned it over for him and added to the deputy, “He’s, uh, he’s new. Mind if we ask you a few questions?”
The younger Winchester figured that the boy didn’t even realize how pretentious he was acting. He was already having difficult time trying to get Samuel to relax after having to tell him to tone his ego down a few times, the boy became more skittish around him when they were alone.
true.
“Yes. I’ll just—”
“What’s that?”
Unexpectedly, for both Sam and the demon, the son of a bitch died, like how they did with Ruby’s knife. He looked at the kid in more confusion than anything but seemed distracted by the blood on the knife for a moment.
It didn’t mean if his father was wrong about his evil, it was still right to defend family no matter what, because that’s what Winchester’s did.
“You know him?” Dean asked.
“And? What, you and the other kids just decided to throw an apocalypse while He was gone?”
Sam—told me the demon crisis will be an hour away in Tully, Oklahoma, and—”
He thought to himself, wishing he could speak those words out loud
“I take it that’s not Raphael anymore.” He said.
He soon learned that kid was quiet around him but soon started talking to him more the next day. Now, when he wasn’t engaging in light conversation with Sam, it was either the boy might’ve had something on his mind that he wouldn’t talk about or he could’ve been hiding something.
“Alright, fine. Where is he?”
Authors note:
“We’re us.” He said and she lowered her gun as a tall, male figure walked quickly past her and the boys, toward the younger hunters in the back with a relieved look on his face until he saw the injuries, especially Rebekah’s. “What happened to you guys? I told you it was a bad idea going alone!” He exclaimed with a worried look on his face. “How many demons did you kill?!”
“Sam, it’s quarter past four.” Dean frustratingly reminded his brother, who rolled his eyes and gave him a bitch face, coming into the room. He shut the door after Sam came in, who was more than upset with him. “What are you—”
“What, you want to let them assume you’re older than me?” He snapped.
“You can see that. Please. Please. Just listen to me.”
Dean’s amulet,” and mentally cursed himself for wording it like that. “Anyways, they should be here not long after the attack begins. I have to go; be ready.”
Sam rolled his eyes and nodded while the kid wasn’t surprised, like he probably knew about this the whole time. “So, who are you?” He demanded of whatever that was.
“Damn it! Where’s Sam?”
She scoffed. “You could’ve got yourself killed, and no, your siblings didn’t teach me to do that. Do you want to be arrested for murder in the past?” She said with her voice cracking with maelstrom. “Hell, they could try to deport you back to Germany! In case you forgot, Sam, we’re not supposed exist right now.”
“Okay, let me see if I can think of the best hunter who might be in the immediate vicinity—oh, that’d be you.”
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately.

“Hey.” She greeted back.
He had never met anyone else as protective as he was of his younger brother, and Sam
Fear was radiating off Sam, if her dysfunctional love-hate twin senses were reliable, and Emma tended to disregard those occasional instances of being a placebo effect from something else on her mind. Her and Sam didn’t have a strong bond, unless their intense love-hate for each other counted as such, and neither did they think like the other often.
Dean was worn out himself, but he wasn’t tired enough to crash at the time like Sam and Rebekah were. He didn’t need any painkillers today either, or in general, only took them when in severe pain.
“Seriously? You’re going to walk in there and tell him the truth?”
She wouldn’t admit that she’d developed feelings for the demon in the past few years either.
D shook his head in agreement. “Yeah, but not just you, Sammy. All three of us need to be more careful.” He said with concern and sapience in his voice, glancing over at the other two time-travelers. “None of us can afford to get any excessive attention right now.”
Their grandfather looked at her with his concern overlapping his worn-out frustration toward his granddaughter’s unusual addiction. At least Sam was able to kick his blood addiction after a year of nearly turning himself into a serial killer on quite a few occasions whilst Emma had been an addict herself for a few years now.
“Because you’re Michael’s vessel and no angel will dare harm you.”
It wasn’t a surprise that other hunters were here, but it was a surprise that the European guy was as tall as Sam. The man, or maybe better described as a kid, had short black hair with floppy bangs shoved away from his face with the same glistering blue eyes that his, no,
He noticed the kid slowly lift his head up and the younger hunter noticed him. “Hey, man, how long have you been here?” He whispered. “What did they do to you?”
A few cars were parked in front of the diner, though, and the pavement was bumpy as Rebekah turned to park there. When all four of them stepped out of the car, chilly air was blowing across the destitute road stop, Samuel was leaning down by his feat and grabbing a long-sleeved black button up with pink stripes. Rebekah locked the car up whilst shivering whilst Sam and D went ahead, and the boy took off his long-sleeved black and purple stripped button and handed it to Rebekah.
“Go, go!” Dean said as him, Ellen, the older kid, and Rebekah turned, and ran.
Dean heard an annoyed scoff on her end of the line as she hung up and put her contact under the different spelling ‘Rebecca,’ then glancing at Cas, before both headed inside.
he did that. It was still a sensitive topic, and neither of them wanted to upset him more than he already was.
Thinking back earlier, Sam overheard him say that there weren’t enough demons to kill, but
It surprising didn’t anger him, nor elicit any sort of hostile reaction when Sam himself told the kid to knock it off. He recalled when the younger-looking hunter meekly followed the older-looking hunter back in Colorado, so the kid must have valued his opinion.
Trigger warning: There's mention of torture in the second scene as well.
“I’m fine,” the boy answered tensely.
Update: I fixed this one up, too.
“Your ‘inherent evil’? What do you mean, man?” He asked, confused.

“Yeah, we know that, Rebekah. You’re good, we’re not denying it.” He said, comforting her with kindness in his tone. “It’s just like how you still need help perfecting your torture method on demons, you’ll get there and become feared like I am one day, so relax.”
Everything had begun happening as the time-travelers said it would. Sam worried about Dean, after receiving a call from him and he explained the whole Raphael situation so far on their end. Future Cas shown up earlier and told them to not change too much of what happens and to put the Enochian angel concealment carvings on the time-travelers’ ribs. He couldn’t appear too much, for Heaven would be able to find him if he didn’t make himself scarce.
Dean nodded. “That’s fine with me.” He said.
“Yeah. Gas station was leveled. Everyone was...it was just horrible.” Framingham attempted to explain what he saw. “And I see this one guy, kneeling, real focused-like, not a damn scratch on him.”
He shook the thought of his head and forced himself to focus on reality.
Outside of that, they were almost always under his or under trusted supervision of an older cousin, his surrogate father, or someone his cousin or surrogate father trusted when they were younger. When they were a bit older, though, they were under Sam or twin’s supervision as their father was never around. In a similar way, Sam was limiting Rebekah in usually never letting her out of line of sight on a hunt, and if she wasn’t in his sight, he made sure he knew where she was. That’s the only way he knew how to keep his former college girlfriend safe because their overly protective and strict father’s way kept him safe growing up.
Rebekah let a smile slip. “We met in law school three years ago. Stanford, to be exact. I got my pre-law degree at in the university’s pre-law program and Sam got his over at Wichita State before moving out to California.” She said fondly, taking the older Winchester aback. “He told me that he wanted to become a public defender to improve his namesake’s image and I wanted to become a prosecutor.”

In CM 5x9, one of the main characters Aaron Hotchner's wife was killed by a serial killer, George Foyet, who they were pursuing. As you guys can probably tell, much of the characters and aspects of this fic has been inspired by CM. Plot details that will come out in later chapters are, just like this, inspired by CM.
Silence followed and the two German brothers sat back down.
Ruby will get the redemption arc that I believe she deserves and will her relationship with Sam be salvageable? What about his feelings for Castiel, though? My influences as of late have been from Criminal Minds, Dexter, Hannibal, and Final Fantasy Vii, but I will make it as true to Spn as it should. Spoilers from any of the above will be mentioned in the authors notes and most chapters will probably remain unchanged.
She nodded as she headed back toward the living room and left him wondering about how without doubt or fear of changing the past. “I’ll use my middle name
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
“Um…I have no excuse. I was acting out of desperation—”
As for the original statement:
Roger was breathing hard and looked like he had been running.
“Sounds fair.” He answered.
Dean didn’t argue, nor did he disagree. There were some things about his older brother that he couldn’t change, and this was one of those things. “Okay, but you can’t constantly supervise Rebekah on cases either.” He said. “We’ll stand out too much and you know there’s more discreet ways to keep her safe.”
Dean knows that he shouldn’t part with Sam, given what they’ve been told by future Castiel and the time-travelers so far, but he knows that Heaven and Hell will use their bond against them. He still can’t entirely trust Sam, and he knows that the time-travelers will interfere in every way possible to keep him from parting with Sam.
Ellen couldn’t believe it, though, as she hadn’t known the existence of angels yet.
“Well, anyways, keep quiet.” He finished, leaving the room in more intense awkward silence.

“I’d honor your request if your life weren’t in danger from the minute you go on your own. Hunters will come to attack you and I’m staying with you to make sure you’re safe until you and my brother’s namesake start hunting together again shortly.” The younger hunter explained rather protectively in his adamance. “My brother and Rebekah are staying with yours to make sure things go smoothly on their end. Believe me, I’d respect your privacy if your life weren’t in danger.”
“Showtime,” he muttered in amusement.
name, too.
The hero Sam looked at him with concern. “There
“Sorry.”
He overheard them both mention Michael.
Dean put the comforter over his head, and Cas left the room with more concern than he came in with.
He was brought back to reality when the brothers’ spoke their names.
“Okay. Where do we start?”
Here it is, episode three. My apologies that it’s taken this long to brainstorm some ideas amongst having a lot of online coursework on my plate now. I want to thank all of you who have read my story, left kudos on it, left comments, bookmarked it, and subscribed, it’s greatly motivating and encouraging.
The older kid and Rebekah nodded. “War’s a manipulator and what better way than to turn us against each other than play the victim?” Rebekah said darkly, glaring the Horseman. “We were informed of who’s meatsuit he’d take over and when he’d come to trick everyone here.”
The two Winchester siblings nodded.
“Yeah, are you and Dean serious gonna drug me?” Samuel demanded incredulously. “I’m not sedating myself on the road just for you both to have quiet, and I won’t be used as your practice torture dummy either. Can’t you guys just wait until we find a demon to interrogate?”
“Good. Random’s good.”
“Wasn’t your usual fireball. It was, um—”
Jo put down the jug and went around to hold his head back.
Future Cas popped into the room and the angel looked visibly distressed, and four Winchesters in the room assumed the worst. “Dean wouldn’t agree after I told him, and he knows you’re all here.” He told them with a deep frown. “He said to not bother him.”
I will get to uploading this chapter on ff.net once I reupload the earlier chapters as soon as possible. The next chapter may be delayed, and I apologize for the delays on this chapter, I still haven’t got the hang of writing altered episodes yet.
ivy league, given the boy’s uncut bangs), and looked more like he should be studying in a library instead of working in a bar in Oklahoma.
A more tense and sorrowing silence passed for a few moments.
This takes place in 5x2.
“Unfortunately.”
Sam turned the engine off and sighed more eeriness followed.
Updated authors note (12\16\20):
harm them or kill them if I must.”
Danny looked at his grandfather. “Are you guys gonna tell Dad about it?” He asked tentatively.
Hell, even if he would need one of Sam’s shirts for this, it’d be too big for him!
Sam nodded. “Same here.” He whispered back. “You okay?”
said and heard an accented ‘hmm?’ from the bar but only glanced a suspicious look at the kid behind the bar.

‘Roger’ took off his glasses, closed the door, moved another chair, and sat down.
different, Sammy, and I have another idea you’ll hate.”
“They think we’re demons, we think they’re demons.” The older Winchester continued, then turning to the time-travelers. “What if there are no demons at all and we’re all just killing each other? Is that right?”
The time-travelers may be a little over their heads right now, especially with Sam's namesake and Rebekah a little worse for wear right now. Stubborn and insistent on helping their ancestors, they're prepared for what's the come and may or may not have told them about Castiel providing the the time-travelers information.
Dean gave him a look to not push on the issue further. “Do you want to correct everybody you meet when you look a few years younger than me?” He said, not in the mood for his brother’s snark tonight. “We need a plan soon, so can’t you just decide instead of complaining about our options?”
The family moved to America when the twins were ten, Dean’s namesake was eight, and Danny was six, where the older three had their initial training. Until then, they stayed in Berlin and in one place.
At last, the second to last part of episode two. I’ll get the hang out writing out episodes better, hopefully not relying on the transcripts of the episodes too often, and I think I’m doing okay as far as that goes. I hope nothing in the canon characters’ have been OOC, and if so, how can I improve that?
“Come on! Stop! Listen to me!”
“No, I’m fine. Thank you, though.” The younger woman answered politely. It seemed that the two brothers calmed down enough to have a civil conversation and their grandmother sent the three Winchesters concerned looks. “Don’t overthink the aliases, you need to pay attention to what’s important.” Sam looked over at his grandmother. “Thanks, Oma.” He said quietly, but politely.
“You’re wrong. Leave him out of this.”
“You mean to tell me you’ve never been up there doing a little cloud-seeding?”
“Look, Dean, I can do this. I can.” The younger Winchester said. “I’m gonna prove it to you.”
Authors note:
“Sam? What happened to Keith?” Lindsay asked, clearly confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You wouldn’t do that.” The hero Sam said in disbelief as Samuel stood beside him, ready to pull his revolver any time now. “It’s funny how watching your best friend die changes that.” Tim said as Reggie walked away from Lindsay, and right beside him.
He thought angrily and in self-loathing, feeling like a useless spectator.
Sam thought, trying to make sense of this, based off the limited information he knew about the boy.
The time-traveler assured him that he’d find a dealer around to illegally buy it until he could obtain false paperwork to get it from a doctor in the present. He was getting more concerned about the kid with every piece of unpleasant information he learned about Samuel, or surprising ones, like Rebekah wasn’t his sister.
