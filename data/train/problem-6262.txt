"Stop whining, Tony," but Natasha was looking at him with unusual fondness. She frowned. "So you sent two stones to their rightful place, you have three..."
Lieutenant Storm and his prisoner – if she was a prisoner, because they only had some very untrustworthy testimony for that – had made their escape while changing planes. According to the only eyewitness, the guy who had been in charge of securing the boarding ramps to the hatch, the woman had tripped at the top as they disembarked and had, by some enormous mischance, crashed into both of Storm's escorts. Storm had seized their guns, grabbed the woman by the arm, and scooted underneath the plane and into the nearest hangar.
Hank, who had been looking as if he were about to burst in an effort to suppress words that Steve feared would condemn him and Tony, suddenly let them flow. "Got interrupted yesterday. Jarvis insisted, and everyone else had disappeared. Didn't want to upset King T'Challa, either, as he controls vibranium, so I guess you want to keep him sweet." He stopped and added, in a very different tone: "You look pretty beat up, Tony."
"Changing it afterwards, Rushman," Tony told her, with the last of his breath. Then the world went away again.
Tony thought. Then,
"The laboratories in the research centre will be heavily guarded," Okoye warned, though she did not look displeased. "By Hatut Zeraze as well as these outsiders."
"Damn right you'll show them to me," Steve snapped, each word bitten out in controlled anger, a voice of command. "I want to know everything. What you know of my – of Captain America's past, about SHIELD, about Fury, about this Doom character. I need to know what I'm in the middle of here."
Now Fury turned to face him. "How the fuck did you do it, Stark?"
"What's a Fandral?"
When he had expressed those doubts, Tony had been unrepentant.
"That was why you needed me to hold you. Because I'd promised."
Every single flying blade bounced upwards, cutting into the roof, sending steel and concrete crashing down. By that time, Tony had grabbed Cap round the waist with one arm and rocketed roofwards, leaving it to Jarvis to find a weak point, if not a gap. Cap held on tightly to Tony's shoulders with one arm while raising the shield protect them with the other as Tony's free hand blasted any remaining roof away.
"Jan?" That was alarming. "Jarvis, what the hell is happening?"
"Or wrong," Rhodes said. "I'm gonna speak to the Commandant an' ask for an extension of my weekend pass."
"Sit down, Capta—." He broke off as Tony shook his head at him, but continued smoothly. "Coffee? Orange juice?"
"She thinks I'm sleeping, have slept, or want to sleep with both. Possibly at once. And no assurances that I think of one as a sister and am terrified of the other will convince her."
"No, I haven't killed him, but he won't wake up for a while. I had to hit him hard; he's a tough cookie."
Once out of the room he found himself surrounded by a quartet of warriors, one of whom said, very carefully, as if learned by rote: "Mr Stark, the Black Panther has instructed us to convey you to a place where you..." He frowned. "...are to wait for him. He wishes to speak to you privately."
"What the hell?" he shouted, though Jarvis and no doubt Steve would hear him even if he whispered. "That fucking thing was dead, as in doornail, not breathing, going
"Parker. Ben Parker. The boy's called Peter. This is real good of you, Mr Stark."
Oddly, Steve also seemed much more relaxed on their journey to JFK, but Tony attributed that to the fact they were finally on the move and, he hoped, to the knowledge that Tony was going with him.
It was not unexpected. Pepper had no real connection with New York, while Tony had been born there. "Do you want to borrow the Malibu house for a while?" he asked.
"Betty and I would like to avoid Washington, thank you very much," Jan added.
Maybe they also could go home now. Except for all those problems with SHIELD.
"Stay safe yourself, son."
When that contact was made the shock was almost as painful as putting on the Infinity Gauntlet. What was more, he sensed something else, deep within the Soul Stone's heart, alert and inimical.
"Can you get there in time?"
There was a handle clutched in Steve's hand and a case had presumably been attached to it.
"Like hell. You never gave that a thought. You just didn't care about your own life."
"Married?" Steve asked, and no doubt his eyebrows were up too.
"That one was effective in neutralising him," North pointed out, nodding towards where T'Challa stood, apparently unaware of his surroundings. "Yours contains the factor carried in the blood of the Chiefs of the Panther tribe that allows them to survive your rituals."
"I like you fine, Clint. It's Fury and SHIELD I don't trust."
"—and Pepper's collecting some of her stuff," Tony continued, despite his sinking feeling. The afternoon, which had begun so well, looked like turning into a nightmare.
– which meant the caller was Marilyn, who was still nagging at him to replace it with the theme from
The stairway led to a walkway in front of a line of offices, suspended just below the roof. Steve, hoping that his memory of this place wouldn't fail him now – how long ago was it that Howard had shown him round? A year? Seventy? – kicked down the door to the furthest office, broke the outside window, and leaped out to the access ladder that curved up onto the roof.
Except that the structure felt more futuristic in the way the armour-encased man and the giant flying aircraft carrier he had escaped had not. Around the walls stood other metal figures – other armours? – from a sleek black number that almost vanished in the dark of its alcove to a giant menacing construction that could destroy...
"Don't touch that!" he shouted, running forward.
"Or the eastern end of Queens and the west of Nassau County," Tony replied. "Either way, it's going to be expensive, both in lives and property damage. I'd offer you beds at Stark tower – we've plenty of room now most of the repairs are completed – but you might well be safer—" He paused as he was interrupted by an urgent, mounting screech, then pulled out his Avengers communicator and slipped the earpiece in.
"I know, I know, you are all that I think about on these trips." Clint responded.
Nat noticed Steve's admiring glances. Luckily, Pepper wasn't noticing. She was discussing with Fury about the facilities. She made a quick scrap of her chair and Steve's eyes darted toward her, albeit, Tony's, Clint's, Banner's, and Hill's as well.
The girls consisted of: Annie Baker, 6; Tina Davis, who was 8 (They slept in the room opposite to Steve's); Ziggy Burman, 16; and Jenny Smith, 18 (They resided in the front-left room). With the remaining two boys being: Peter Parker who was 17, and Tommy Casto, 19 (They had to sleep in the front-right room, adjacent to Steve's).
I mean they knew the apartment wasn’t a huge disappointment, and it was miles better than the one in Wales. But it still had its moments. Just last week, the toilet clogged unintentionally, the light fixtures in the living room failed, and the water temps for showers/baths never were warm enough, at least for Wanda.
Suddenly, the glass broke. The energy roaring like Godzilla, as it began to swarm the building with its vengeful shots of energy. Becoming a symphony of blue and purple hues. An energy blast that sent one of the agents to the ground, got the trio's attention.
"You okay, Cap?" Tony asked carefully.
Tony didn't say anything, still giving his pecks of admiration onto Steve's neck. The soldier simply chuckled, and simply laid the both of them back down onto the sofa.
But these last 15 minutes had Steve lost in his mind once again. He thought about several things. Several events in his life. People he’s touched, hurt, or be-friended. Yet one remained the most persistent.
Steve began to breathe heavily now. Now, it was his turn, to lose his train of thought, as well. He never got to the level Tony was at, as his admiration of this situation was just the sight of the 'iron man'. Tony's had many lovers, and yet he has one incident with Captain America-No, Steve Rogers, and yet looks utterly obliterated with sensuality.
"What took you so long? You do realize my legs aren't actually made out of iron." Tony guffawed.
He sighed again. His eyes barely scanning the sunlit photo frame on his coffee table. It was of him, Tony, and Natasha with a fan at a Manhattan diner. It was around Halloween, and the little girl was in her homemade 'Black Widow' outfit.
It never occurred to the super-soldier of how many times he put himself in seriously dire situations. Truly, from what happened in Germany, Siberia, and now this?! And in those situations, would have to be saved in the process, or be used as a 'tie-breaker'. Steve was surely on his way to becoming a damsel in distress.
"Pretty" Steve lied.
Including his buried act of kissing Steve all those years back. He didn't even hesitate, it just came out with a vengeance. As if he was dying to tell someone other than himself.
"Anywhere is perfect, as long as your next to me.".
Tony genuinely smiled. 'How is he this understanding?' He thought.
"Something with him and Tony that had made them act like idiots for a couple of days. But it wasn't anything big. I got that from Fury." Sam answered.
"Yeah. Everything else is just regularly tasting." He added.
Steve became a little rigid. Had he been that noticeable? And if so, what was their counteraction to it?
Food poisoning, an ugly repercussion of uncooked meat, followed by rancid oysters. He knew they had a funny smell to it, as the odor hit his nostrils. But what was he to do? Sit there and not eat?! No, the soldier needs his protein anyway he can get it. Even if the food seems rancid.
It began a few months back, just after their scrimmage with AIM. When Tony had finally revealed his feelings to Steve. To which, Steve had kissed him in response. And since then, each one of their encounters slowly morphed into something more romantic. Surprisingly, they hadn’t had sex yet. Mainly, on Tony’s behalf.
Wanda slightly cringed at the thought of him disagreeing. But it fell immediately, as, at this point, she honestly could’ve cared less. He put them in this situation. If they wanted to leave, and be happy somewhere else, they had every right to do so.
This was completely different from what the soldier was expecting Tony would do. He'd thought Tony would sleep facing away from him, ever so sliding closer and closer to the edge just so that he wasn't near the blonde. Even so, Steve had thought the brunet would damn near sleep on the floor. It did make the super-soldier feel a sense of hope for their relationship.
The last time jump. We’re now heading into the Endgame!
Nothing. He was breathing, Steve was sure about that. The soldier slightly patted the man’s cheek to get a reaction. “Sam! Come on, Sam... Hello?!” He urged.
“No your fine. It just reminded me of Tony again.” He answered, “I know that it’s been a long time, Sam. But for some reason, I can never get that man out of my thoughts.”.
"I'm not cleaning that up!" He quipped.
"To let them be kids." Tony sighed. The feeling of Steve's hand on his cheek calming him.
Later that night, she apologized profusely. So much so, that she had bubbles of snot coming from her nose. Steve forgave her and wiped her face with a wet cloth. He hadn't had another incident from Annie, like that, again. But it was an exhausting experience, to say the least.
Tony's worried expression suddenly grew to excitement. No ones really asked him for a guys night out. Truthfully, it's something that he's been wanting for a little while now. And at least the person asking this time, was a friend.
Tony apologized profusely, as he grabbed a couple of napkins, and helped Steve with his situation. Once the milk began to dry, the spot on Steve's thigh became sticky.
"Viz we talked about this," Wanda complained.
“Please Annie, you two need to share Lucy because I got her for the both of you. She’s both your friend.”.
The men then looked further down the length of the left side. Towards the back of the house, barely noticeable by the open doorway, was the kitchen. With a dining area sitting between the two rooms with a different enclosing on each side. The living room had a brown, flat, archway with sidelights; the kitchen's being a simple wall & door. Another fireplace sitting next to that doorway.
They must've been devastated. Completely losing sight of reality. Maybe even in still denial.
Once the table disappeared and the flooring moved back into place. The party guests moved to find a spot on the newly put dance floor. Tony hurriedly grabbed Steve and ushered themselves to the middle.
'Has Tony heard this story before? I doubt it, but I guess I'll find out." Steve pondered.
The philanthropist did not look anywhere near convinced, and so Steve sighed in defeat.
"Really?! I mean... like what happened-" Peter looked to his mentor's face, and instantly cut himself off.
"Goodnight, Cap." Tony yawned, before knocking back out on the bed by the window.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tony... What are you doing?" Steve softly whispered, with the huge sensation of desire in his voice. And just like that, the inevitable happened. Scratch that... 5th oddest thing to occur.
Tony looked to his partner, his body tensing.
Once she walked into her bedroom, she could see Tony sleeping soundly. His back facing her. She barely could see the sofa indentions in his back.
"It may be worsen that," a new voice interrupted. It came from a middle-aged woman in a simple uniform of black pants and blue shirt, but with a pilot's wings sewn onto the latter. The captain of Jackson's plane, presumably. "I didn't like the look of the weather comin' in. The last time I saw a cloud formation like that was out in tornado alley."
Okoye touched his arm, but he had already seen it: the same blue-white flare of energy he had encountered on the Vicstar hangar roof. That one had been temporary, and he and Tony had speculated that the sniper had been carrying the controls that had both brought it into existence and let it self-destruct.
"My nephew says you saved his life during that fracas at the Stark Expo a while back. Not sure whether he's making it up. He's just a kid, his parents are dead, and you were already his hero."
That, as he had intended, made Steve grin, if fleetingly.
Steve nodded. "Such as?" he asked, encouragingly.
All three turned to look at Tony. It was Hunter who finally spoke: "My brother pleads for your life, Stark, on the basis that you not taken anything that belongs to Wakanda. But you came here for vibranium."
Steve grinned to himself, but he was growing increasingly uncomfortable. His erection, trapped between the leather seat, pants that were suddenly far too tight, and Tony's hip was now actually painful.
She didn't hesitate, for which he was grateful.
There hadn't been an EEG, he remembered now. He should have noticed that.
Already he could hear the metal creaking.
He heard Steve yell, "Tony!" With what he supposed was his last thought, as Yogthulu reared up, tentacles brushing the rafters of the double height room, Tony set the armour to respond to Steve. He faced the monster, hands raised, palms out, though he knew he didn't have enough power to do anything more than irritate it.
"And went missing deliberately," Tony said. "Otherwise the index wouldn't have been missing. Whose was the sample? Not you or Bruce or Hank himself?"
"Okay." Tony was pleased to hear his voice sound so normal. So, the Widow and Hawkeye were in the capital – a dangerous place for them to be, but he wouldn't have dared to argue with either of them. And for Natasha to put in an appearance as Natalie Rushman meant that she had something very important to convey to him.
Jarvis kept him updated on Sandro and Steve occasionally came through with comments on their latest discoveries and speculations about Ross's files.
At least the latest upgraded suit would be waiting for him.
"Could be locked to his fingerprints," Steve suggested. "Or even to his genetic code." The Iron Man armour was now locked to Tony's. And maybe this control panel was locked to this guy's.
Tony's head lifted away. "Thor – wait!"
Tony turned his head so his face was hidden against Steve's shoulder, but his fingers were biting deep into muscle, as if he could hold Steve here by sheer force of will, and his whole body was shaking, each breath a gasp. "Isn't," he said petulantly.
"It wasn't," Danvers said. "Your abductors weren't Air Force, though they had all the right papers, which means traitors in the command structure." She raised her head to stare back at Tony, her jaw set as hard as his, her expression as cold. "I wasn't entirely honest when I met you the first time, Stark. Jim is my good friend, but I'm an agent of the Secretary of the Air Force, who wanted to know why his one and only superhero had vanished."
Chopping the last of his opponents in the throat, he whirled towards the place where the woman was being held, half expecting, and half dreading that she had already been forced into the car.
"They'd have to look out for hawks," Tony responded, grinning at Clint, who glanced at Natasha, took a swig of beer and did not respond to the bait.
** Kingda Ka – as this story is written, the world's tallest roller coaster.
"SHIELD..."
And if it were true.... if that was
Until, quite suddenly, he was awake and aware of a different set of voices. He did not bother opening his eyes, but tuned in on the low-voiced conversation, some voices familiar, some not.
Once again, he was dying in the Arctic Ocean.
That told Steve that they were well drilled, and probably military, though he couldn't even guess what they were looking for. One of their number lay still on the tarmac, his gun beside him. There was no clue as to whether he was unconscious or dead.
At least it justified the universal sunglasses.
The elevator car was empty.
Bruce blinked at him. "I might have known. Jarvis is his alter ego. Anyhow, Betty isn't working in gamma radiation any more, but she's knows most of the people who've worked in the field and when she saw what happened out in Seattle she tried to alert them. She hasn't been able to contact any of them."
"I know who Phillips was. Clint and I will deal with this. When are you going to be back?"
was Tony's thought. What he said was, "The farm I bought for Pepper, which she rejected even before she rejected me."
"I know. I'm sorry." If Steve had ever doubted that Jarvis felt some kind of emotion – if not exactly human emotion – the last few hours would have dispelled it forever.
It was all right. Tony was still alive. He wasn't alone again.
"We are in a protected forest," Jarvis pointed out.
He glanced at his watch then, with a shrug, selected charcoal grey pants and a cream cotton shirt. They would have to do.
"There's been an attack?"
Knowing that his first thrown stone, had, of necessity, probably done just that, Steve shrugged. "This one seems to be the leader." He knelt down and began to search the unconscious man. "I hope he's carrying the portal control. Keep watch for me while I try to figure it out."
"Oh, I'm not displeased with you, but Jan sure is gonna be. And Natasha. It's lucky for you I called Pepper this morning."
Alien science, bad lab protocols, the odd explosion and a lot of inspired lying.
"We're here to help with the clean-up and rebuilding," Velasco explained, "and Colonel Rhodes here has been assigned to help."
"Wait and see. Meanwhile, make that super-soldier strength useful and help me shift these crates to the loading bay."
Damn, he hadn't heard her approach. But if he switched the hologram off now it would make Pepper even more curious – and this particular secret wasn't his to divulge.
Tony sighed and closed his eyes. That was better. He'd have to ask Steve to find his sunglasses. "SHIELD sometimes lies by omission, and sometimes just lies."
Is that what Tony had been talking about?
Which was all too true. And deep down he had been relieved. He liked – loved – Pepper but he'd been – was still – more attracted to Whitney – and he hadn't been in the least bit jealous when Pepper had been, sort of, pursuing Gene. Well, not jealous of Gene. Maybe he had a thing for supervillains after all.
The words cut Steve like knives. He bit back his angry retort, because
And here was SHIELD. And here was a threat that would be sure to bring him racing to help. And a monster that refused to die.
"Awesome."
"We think Colonel North is down," the woman replied. "Apparently Iron Man is loose somewhere in Wakanda, and we've just had to deal with a Hulk incursion. This is now the only working quantum-bridge we have here. My orders are to snag as much vibranium as we can, hide the quantum-bridge generator and evacuate. We'll be back, never fear. Now, do we have any vibranium at all?"
"It says she saw me on TV and recognised me. That she doesn't want to see me – doesn't want me to see her the way she is now – but does want to hear from me. It asks me to call or write. That maybe I ought to contact her ... her great-niece, Sharon, who is apparently working for SHIELD. She's supposed to have given Peggy my address."
Tony was surprised. "Do you know him? I've sold stuff to his company but only through his management and research staff."
Tony waggled his eyebrows at Howard. "You want me to take his fingerprints too? I daresay if they have records I can find them. Though I'd have to break into the Pentagon if they're on paper."
"Then why should I?" He knew though, that he was not going to leave until he had satisfied his curiosity; what was wrong with Tony Stark?
Betty had been Bruce's partner in more ways than one, and Bruce was smart, in some ways as smart as Tony. It figured that Betty might be their equal.
That same fear was already clouding his thoughts, though he had no heart to beat faster, no hormones to trigger a panic attack, only the memory of dreadful pain as the Infinity Gauntlet burned his flesh, seared it to the bone.
He ran the figures – which way the helicarrier's decks had been facing when she hit, the strength and direction of the waves generated, the state of the tide, the currents in the Sound – to estimate the Captain's likely position after the crash, then what someone with enhanced vision might see, and what reasoning they might employ. Then he headed for Long Island.
He could still end it now. Just open his mouth and let the water in.
." Then he turned on his heel and stormed out of the lab.
Many thanks to both.
It was Steve who, unexpectedly, took on the role of making sure they ate and slept, who hid Tony's whisky on bad nights and who watched over Bruce's experiments while he caught a few hours sleep, because Bruce did not trust Jarvis, let alone the bots, the way Tony did.
"She's the best person to handle it," Steve said, with an assurance he did not entirely feel. "So long as you're right about Storm."
Steve hauled on the hand, pulling Bucky up towards him, and pain lanced so hard into his back that he had to bite back a scream...
Thor pulled his hammer from his belt and tossed it into the air. "It appears I am still worthy. If not, I have friends on Midgard who will not turn me aside."
"Is this something to do with that odd cloud? And why hasn't he called me? Or Bruce?"
"Tony! Stop! It's me and Ms Scott!" The voice was familiar and reassuring.
There was an envelope propped up against the water bottles. Tony goggled at it, particularly as it had his name on it in a clear hand that almost certainly did not belong to one of the scientists. No one wrote to him on anything longer than a Post It, unless it was something that needed his signature.
"What I want – wanted – isn't important," Tony retorted, goaded beyond endurance. "What is is what
He was interrupted by another sharp but unintelligible warning, then the imprisoning hands let him go and, without their support, he fell to his knees in the darkness, feeling the rough concrete of the sidewalk under his hands.
Damn, he needed to be more wary, couldn't let anyone see how much Steve had meant to him – something he was only just beginning to come to terms with himself – and how much this had affected him.
Tony sighed, and obeyed.
"But," Jarvis was continuing, "from the sophistication of their approach and their specific targets—"
"We have a deadline," Okoye reminded him, picking up one of the energy weapons and examining it.
Tony, watching Steve, saw him flinch, then frown. He caught Tony's eye and shook his head slightly.
"Who is supplying you with illicit vibranium?"
"You haven't got the queens there, have you?"
Yogthulu's head and first few segments had emerged; the room wasn't big enough to take the whole creature, though Tony was sure it would simply break through the roof if it felt like it.
"What's the delay?"
Dream, Steve thought. Dream voices. So they needn't be recognisable, needn't make sense.
," Clint added.
Interestingly, none of the other 'agents' escorting them had attempted to shoot Storm. They had, however, ordered the hangar cleared of personnel, and Base Commander MacTavish had had the tarmac cleared and the runways shut down.
He drew in a deep breath, and this, this was how air should taste.
"No. I know better than that. Besides, that was only the second conversation I had with her."
Furthermore, there was no sign of Iron Man or War Machine.
"There's kind of a problem, boss," Happy interrupted. Despite the casual phrasing, his voice was harsh with tension and control. "We're off the road and under attack. Thor's holdin' them off an' stopping the truck goin' hood first down a gulley. We need Iron Man, boss."
"One last thing:" Clint said, "Wakanda's apparently interested in you. That won't mean anything, I guess. We think Wakanda is based in East Africa – at least, its interests seem to be represented by Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, though they're scared stiff of it and ain't talking. Best guess is that Wakanda is an enclave, kinda like Swaziland, or it's a tribe or a secret society. Maybe all three. There was something happening in East Africa – and by something I mean like Hulk or Thor something – around the time you were under attack by Hammer, Tony, but we didn't manage to get in, according to Coulson at any rate. Thanks for attending his funeral, by the way. That meant a lot to us. We'll be in touch again when we've got more info. Ciao."
"I did not," Frigga said firmly. "Your father did. You were just coming into your power, and Odin had presented you with Mjolnir. He had to balance that gift, could not favour you too much. And you were not, in those days, interested in Thought and Memory. It is not a gift Odin can withdraw, once given."
"He's in astronaut training at NASA."
Most of the staff had left the building, though there were still people in the Culver sections, when a woman – he suspected it was Morganti herself – made her way towards the vault, carrying an insulated flask.
"He'll be fine, though it's taking a little time for him to get back in action. I've got a new suit waiting for him when he's ready."
"Just do it, Friday," he said.
Pepper smiled at him with real affection. "I do hope you're right, Steve. Now, please finish those pastries before I'm tempted to eat one."
The thing howled. "Doom is invincible! You cannot kill Doom!" even as the blast exploded out of the left side of its jaw. Steve twisted the barrel so it was pointing upwards and fired another long blast.
"Steve, they've been trying to steal my armour for years. I'm used to this. A different era and they'd be trying to nationalise Stark Industries too – not that that would do them much good. Most of the key subsidiaries are now registered overseas, and most of the StarkEnergy factories will be too, if the deals I'm working on come through. This is where I miss Dad," he added ruefully, "and even Obie, damn his black soul."
"I could have killed him any time if I'd wanted to," Tony pointed out, his voice cold enough to freeze Steve in the ice again. "You saw Iron Man take down Chitauri Leviathans, Rogers. If I'd deployed missiles or the Jericho weapon, every single one of you, with the possible exception of Wanda, would have been dead. But I don't kill friends. And what Barnes needed was – is – help, both legal and psychiatric. We needed to know the brainwashing had totally worn off. Which it hadn't. Hydra wins because
"She had a brother."
Needless to say, they did no such thing.
The helicarrier was lying on its side in the central channel of Long Island Sound. Someone was going to have to find a way to remove it – or possibly blow it up, and would they let him do that, did you suppose? – or shipping was going to be seriously impeded.
"What is the Hatut Zeraze?" Steve asked.
It was Pepper's turn to look alarmed. "Our test site for manufacturing ARC reactors?"
It was now Howard's turn to shake his head. "Tony's had too much experience of people he admired turning out to have feet of clay to let that happen again. He isn't in need of a role model, Steve, just friends. And he is loyal and protective of his friends. So am I. Eat, Steve. Watch some silly TV, and then go to bed. It may look very different in the morning." He patted Steve's shoulders, then reached past him to turn off the laptop.
As if he'd heard Tony's movement – and, hey, super-soldier senses so he probably had – Steve glanced towards him, then came swiftly to his feet.
"So Ross is in this up to his scrawny neck," Clint said, his holographic image staring straight at Betty as if trying to force a confession of complicity from her.
"Pepper's better off out of this, Steve. She never approved of the Iron Man, and she's going to be furious when she realises the Avengers are back in operation. Not to mention that Jan Van Dyne is now a superhero and that Natasha is installed in the tower."
"Why would they want to kill me?" Steve asked plaintively.
"Don't let them touch you, Iron Man!"
There was silence for a while, except for the wind rushing past his helmet.
Because of the delay, which Tony uncharitably put down to Colonel Danvers, it was getting late by the time he arrived back in Malibu. His housekeeper and staff would have long since gone home, leaving the house spotless and the refrigerator full of food.
"No, you won't. Not if this plane carries parachutes. Do planes carry parachutes now?" he asked plaintively.
"Shields up! Warn them off, Jarvis! And armour me up!"
"Jarvis, what did I tell you about tattling to Steve behind my back? Oh, Bruce said 'Hello' by the way, and wants to know why you put up with me."
Kitchen, then, once he had cleaned up.
Tony laughed "This is Steve," he said, gesturing to his right. "Steve, Lori Scott."
Tony came near to licking his lips at that memory, even as he idly wondered whether he dare ask Steve if he had never been cut or if the serum had efficiently restored his foreskin.
"Then do it," Tony said and triggered the boot jets. His exit scattered agents, papers and tech to the four winds.
"My scans find no significant injury. They also find no trace of shrapnel in your chest."
"That sucks," Tony responded "Hey, steady with the water. You want another?"
The case containing the stone had gone and without his shield he was weaponless - no, Mjolnir would come when called. Cautiously, he flexed his fingers – and they brushed the hammer's distinctive handle.
Fuck it, he really should have loosed that worm in SHIELD's computers. "Yeah," Tony said, "Bruce mentioned that in his analysis. What about the body in the lobby?"
"It's nothing to do with either the Air Force or NASA. If you can find Storm, ask him why anyone would want to steal his sister's DNA."
"Sure I do."
Tony looked down into light brown depths.
But Danvers was already on the PA: "Everyone hang on tight. If you aren't in your seats it's too late!"
"Thanks." With that worry dismissed, Tony downed the rest of the contents of the glass and reached to replace it on the tub-side table and exchange it for his phone (the only smart phone on the market that came with waterproofing as standard, though this one was far from standard.) Just before he touched it, it burst into the theme tune from
His voice was suddenly drowned out by shrieking alarms and, riding on top of the hellish noise, the voice of someone speaking urgently in Wakandan.
"Why, exactly, was Danvers at the Malibu house? Jan said she was looking for me. Why?"
"I'll be in the workshop when you get in," Tony told her, heading for the door. No doubt she would get the story - well, his part of the story - out of him in bed that night, which was really the whole point of keeping it from her right now. Having someone to whom he could tell everything was the most wonderful aspect of his relationship with Pepper.
Darkness.
"So Howard said. Tell him we want to see him soon, Tony. We miss both of you." She slapped her hand on the roof of the SUV, and Tony gunned the engine.
"You're not a ghost!" she shouted, winding her arms round his neck and kissing him on both cheeks. "Damn it! Tony said you were dead."
"Eat," he ordered firmly, shoving a partly unwrapped chocolate bar into Steve's hands.
His own emotions, though... was the only reason they were more intense that Tony had become his emotional lifeline in this strange cold world of the future?
Steering a careful course, T'Challa glanced continually between his charts and the automatic pilot. Then, without warning or sight of land, he shut down the engines. The view through the dome vanished, as if shutters had been dropped on all sides.
T'Challa leaped straight at his brother, so they tumbled together across the ground, undistinguishable in their identical white costumes.
And, dammit, there was that yellow cab with that particular license plate again right in the rear view mirror.
"Then you can take it up with the Joint Chiefs, lady."
"Not someone else who wants to get his hands on my body! And don't think I've forgiven you, Rogers, either."
"Avengers help? Why the heck didn't you tell me? Is Stark hurt? Have you called the other—?"
Angrily, he blinked back the tears that still came to his eyes at the thought of his old unit, keeping his face turned away from Tony until he was under control again. Not so long ago, they would have been tears of anger, but that had been blown away in the wreck of Manhattan. The people of his city had needed him, as had his new teammates.
Steve shrugged. "You're making too much of it," he told Howard. "Anyone could have—"
Not offering his hand would have been ungracious, and Pepper would have kicked him. He did so and she didn't. "Pleased to meet you."
The hidden doors to Tony's private garage opened before he had even slowed the Harley to a crawl, and he parked beside a line of sports cars that looked as if they might take off and fly, all painted the most outrageous colours; scarlet and electric blue and chrome yellow. Which made the black or grey of the fleet of limousines opposite look almost odd; Steve had a sudden urge to paint pictures of Iron Man in full flight along the sides.
" Tony's rising voice reflected the horror of the revelation. "Wong told me the Infinity Stones are singularities. If an Infinity Stone has a quantum existence and just manifests as a Stone in Space-Time, its destruction would affect every instant, every location..."
"Should we go after her?" Danvers asked.
Tony wasn't listening to the preacher, who was having to compete with some irreverent unidentified (at least by Tony) birds. Instead, he was trying to locate Pepper, who had taken on the task of looking after Coulson's ex-girlfriend, the cellist from Portland who was, not surprisingly, wide-eyed and somewhat overwhelmed by the attendees at his funeral. The gravestones in this particular DC cemetery might also have given her food for thought, as might the black granite memorial with the SHIELD logo and an engraving of the helicarrier beneath it. Coulson's name appeared there, along with all the others who had died in its defence, whether buried here or not.
He snatched up the three little cakes of heart-shaped herb, and thrust them into his own mouth.
Tony sighed. "I'm not sure. With anything that doesn't threaten Wakanda, I guess. He's a good ally to have, though."
Okoye rose to face her and they began what looked like an angry conversation. Tony activated the boot thrusters as Jan shrank to insect-size, hovering on the dragonfly wings that had sprouted from her shoulders in the process.
"No, you haven't." Pepper slapped his left hand pocket. "You just don't want to leave the booze and broads—"
"No," Tony said firmly. "I stumbled and touched it by accident. I wasn't wishing for anything. So I'm not Ali Baba and this isn't a magic lamp."
"Internet shopping," Jan said. "My fashion house has a branch in LA. I'll contact the manager. Meanwhile, I may borrow one of your shirts. Right this way, Betty."
"He isn't answering his cell or his e-mail," Pepper persisted.
"You can take Pepper back to the hotel, Hap."
But the seats on his immediate left and right were noticeably empty, and Okoye stood at his shoulder, other members of the Dora Milaje lined against the wall behind her.
"No, sir. Wind speed will peak at about twenty three knots."
Betty took the hand gingerly, but her grip was firm. "Captain Rogers." Her eyes assessed him. "And forgive
"I've benefitted so much from the serum," Steve said, "that denying it to others, to my country, seems incredibly selfish. Then I remember that the Red Skull was also a result of something very like the serum. So, if we are all agreed, we destroy the Vita-ray device. Tony will look over the files, extract those that relate to the construction of the device, and then we'll burn them too."
"Nope. And the answer is: probably, if I get to shower with you," Steve answered, picking up his duffle, which he had carefully not loaded into the SUV. It occurred to him that he was getting to know Tony far too well.
The silence fell back into the space between them. “Where’s Steve?” Bruce inquired.
"Tony, I can't be the only one contributing to this conversation. I'm going to need to hear your side sooner or later." She continued.
Tony looked back to the super-soldier, and saw his wink following the comment. "I didn't think you knew how to tease, Cap.".
"Let's hear it then." Tony cheerfully smiled. Hoping to break away the confusing tension.
Kamala, noticing Steve's smile, had once recognized it as a look Abu would give her. She called it the 'Relieved Dad Look'.
"Yea..." she said persistently.
“It’s good.” He said while licking his lips.
And mostly because their good news, wiped out any room for any things, other than their news, to be discussed. And that, with time, certain events can become blurry to a person’s mind. But not always with their hearts.
The soldier sighed once more. He was done fighting for the moment, that much was true. Yet, Steve just wanted to feel needed again, even if that wasn't on a big scale.
Each time Tony would lunge for a kiss, Steve would move his face out of the way. He would shout to 'stop it', or 'no we can't'. But it fell upon deaf ears.
Tony couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Steve Rogers was a nervous wreck. And for what? For wanting to talk to Tony? Sure, there not on good terms. But from that last 5 minutes, it seems as if they’re doing well.
He shot up and headed back into the ship. Hearing the music and laughter slowly fade from him, as he reached the crew quarters. It was quiet. Tony looked around the area, to see if he was sitting anywhere. He wasn't.
Steve waited to see if she would acknowledge his presence. But she wasn't moving an inch or even looking his way in the slightest. So the super-soldier decided to break the ice.
Almost sounding like a dumbfounded teenager, he teasingly tried to apologize to her. And surprisingly, she actually didn’t shoo him away, or give him a go-to-hell look. It was almost like an amused, but monotonous expression. Tony got her to smile, that’s a start.
"Steve, you're being paranoid. We're literally going to the barn, and petting the horses. You do realize that in the time-span we’ve been here, that we have only been around those horses
(See the end of the chapter for
She gazed outside to the street below, and pondered in thought. Oh god, how she didn't want to do it. But she made a promise.
But when they had separated, Tony could see Steve's eyes still burning with passion. "Okay then. I'll stay."
"I should be kicking you out. I should be telling you to never see me or my family again. But, I told you it was okay. And that's no one's fault but my own. It was my fault for giving you that green light when I was still left on red." Her analogy made sense to the soldier. But it didn't make him feel any better.
"You've hacked ... Fury's cell phone?" Bruce was plainly torn between delight and horror.
"I hope you're right. And it'll be just Stark."
Her eyes only flicked away from his for a moment, but it was enough to give her away "Perhaps. I wonder if you have any idea how many times I have been warned not to trust you."
"RAF Lakenheath," Tony identified. "It's a fighter base."
"Oh, yeah. Who are you representing: Stark Industries, or SHIELD?"
Tony thought.
Tony moved fast, finding it surprisingly easy to block Steve's path to the elevator and stop him by grasping his arms. Steve's eyes were wide, deer-in-the- headlights wide, and far, far too bright and he was, fuck it, shaking – or shivering? – in Tony's grip. "Oh, no, you don't run away again. At least, not unless you tell me why you came here in the first place."
It wasn't a question, but Tony said, "Of course. And remember you can call on us as necessary."
"If you had, I'd'a billed your boss," a unknown voice mocked, "because your insurance wouldn't pay out. If you'd got it right you'd have got clean away, and I coulda dealt with this scum."
"Your customised G650. You ought to know. You ordered it to LAX. And Steve Rogers apparently commandeered it using authority issued by you personally, before you – before we – when I should have been consulted before you—"
"Massive explosion at an air force base in Jersey."
Right now, something was urging him to get to his feet, or even to don the armour. Well, least he could rule out separation from Steve as what had been calling him back to the lake house.
"Then come along and watch."
As he wove his way through the throng, he caught another tantalising glimpse of the blond man now dancing with a too-skinny thirty something with haunted eyes. Tony's eyes lingered on the man's neat ass, shown to perfection by too tight – no
"Fuck." Tony made to get to his feet, but Steve hung onto him fiercely, because if he let him go he'd be cold, and alone. Again. He'd lost Peggy to old age and death, and Bucky to Hydra. Sharon, Sam, Clint and Natasha had deserted him. Those had been devastating enough, but to lose hope in Tony would somehow be worse. Not that he'd ever had any claim on Tony, just the cherished the dream of the perfect fighting partnership, more so even than with Bucky. And that one night.
"With instructions to read them."
Beyond that was air. It felt wonderful in Steve's lungs.
Erik," Tony greeted, as Iron Man landed, with the transporter, taller than Tony himself, coming to earth neatly beside him.
"I was not asking you, my friend. I will set out at once."
It was then that Tony's pain lessened as the woman fought the command, unmoving, her lips pressed together. The tight fitting necklet she wore had began to glow, its inset white stones shining with a nacred light, forming unknown words.
"I— it was just instinct," Steve protested.
But he could do nothing to defend himself now.
"Steven has told me of this."
The reply, though, was from an immediately recognisable source. "So long as it does not breech any of the restrictions within my programming and protocols – the instructions I operate by – I am at your service, Captain," Jarvis said.
"Is Dad okay? You didn't leave him to face them alone?" Tony's voice was urgent.
Tony shuddered. How could he have come to Wakanda with a piece of vibranium in his chest and a working arc reactor available for the taking? It wasn't that he had forgotten about it, but now the technology that was so much a part of him was on the verge of going global he had tended to discount its value to others – and the dangers it posed to himself.
Tony still wasn't sure whether Gene's overtures were genuine, but there was evidence that the Mandarin had been surreptitiously intervening in emergencies throughout the Far East, and not on the side of the bad guys.
"Damn..." Bruce said, mildly.
"Eggs Benedict, I believe, sir."
"I think I'll just take a look myself," he said.
"I don't think we were in shot," Tony said, plainly in tune with his thoughts. Neither of them would want those shots out on the net. "Cameras seem to be movement sensitive. Anyway, if there's anything embarrassing on record I'll wipe it."
"How caffeinated are you?" Steve asked him, in a mildly disapproving tone.
Time froze, along with his heartbeat and every muscle.
"He was alive," Tony pointed out stubbornly. "And helpless."
"Invite him up," Tony said.
"Could individuals exist in more than one universe?" Steve asked now.
"You have no idea," Steve said, with a chuckle.
he had messaged to Kublai at Xanadu dot com, because though he and the Mandarin had finally fought the Makluan together, he was not sure Gene could keep the influence of the rings at bay for ever. World conquest might be on his agenda again.
this thing? Is it Makluan? What does it do?"
Steve pushed himself away from the van. "I'm gonna get some shut-eye."
Iron Man flung light down onto the track he was creating, and the truck followed its path, reversing as fast as the path become visible in its mirrors.
"When I first came here," Steve said, "it was in a raging storm. Your house was a beacon light to a safe haven. I wanted to clear my head, to see the beach and your house without the baggage. But not alone." He turned to look at Tony. "I'm not sure I want to do anything alone anymore."
"If you want them flown back, you only have to ask," Tony said.
Tony let his eyes widen. "Why, for God's sake? I can't think of anything that would make you take such a stupid risk..." Even as he spoke, Tony realised he was wrong. "Except your daughter. Damn it, Alison, I should have seen that."
"Captain, hurricane Sandro has suddenly increased from a category two to a  category five hurricane. It is already the largest Atlantic storm on record and it is heading straight for the New England coast. It may make landfall anywhere between Washington DC and Maine, but the likeliest trajectory seems to be New York and Boston. It should make landfall in less than ten hours."
What had Jarvis said? That Pepper Potts wasn't here?
"Come on then." Iron Man held out a gauntleted hand. Steve took it, covering a wince as he was helped to his feet.
He'd braced – but all he felt was a gentle pat.
"Shhh. Hot tubs don't work miracles and I don't heal as quickly as you," he muttered against Steve's mouth. "C'mon. Let's take this to the sofa and get comfortable."
Which left Steve facing Shuri over that deadly blade. He gave it a significant glance. "So that's how you and Storm escaped. Well, you can't cut a hole in this aircraft at this altitude without killing us all. T'Challa wouldn't be too pleased about that."
The last time he had done this, it had been with far more sophisticated repulsor lift units, not these pseudo-prototypes—
Perhaps that had been for the best. It was becoming more and more difficult not to tell Tony how much he loved – was in love with – him. But he'd promised to wait until Tony was ready... if he ever was. If there was any possilbity that declaration could signal a break-up, he had to remain silent because he was still nowhere near certain that Tony loved him back.
"Eye location at 24 degrees 23 minutes North, 73 degrees 98 minutes West. Currently decreasing in strength and now Force 1. It has caused extensive damage on Jamaica, the eastern edge of Cuba, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos, but then began tracking east. However, it is noticeable for its size, rather than the strength of its winds, and will cause minor damage in Florida, though it is wreaking havoc in the Bahamas. Its current path will take it out into the Atlantic."
"He had to take Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, and he wasn't letting anyone else help with
"I could care less about what Fury wants," Tony said, but he had noted the correction.
"Wait, how did you two get here in the first place?"
The answer to that was far simpler. "Yes. Do that. Got anything on the Michael Moorcock connection? Or the Eternal Champ—?"
He'd been through the records, developing new muscles and a hacking cough amid the boxes in his father's archives. Material from the wartime period was scanty and contained none of the specific engineering or scientific data he had been looking for.
"And Iron Man has Captain America." The bitterness was there again. Much as Pepper was trying to hide it, Tony knew her too well not to see behind the mask of lightness.
The contraption on which he had been transported, which had been hovering above the floor with no visible means of support, swung towards him, and he had to leap aside to avoid it carrying him with it as it crashed into the wall.
"The hotel? The guests and staff?" Steve asked.
Sorry this has been so, so long in arriving, folk. It got totally stuck at 2,000 words and refused to budge. I will try to do better.
"Then good luck. And you call me if you need me."
"Oh, shut up, Jarvis."
The man with the sword in his right hand was taking aim with the gun in his left when the ship and its occupants began to... fade.
"Bad dream?" Steve was asking now.
"Only," Steve said, "if you tell me what is happening right now. Because with my shield I can break out of here. If you think I'm incapable of walking out stark naked and finding him, you're wrong, Jarvis." There was silence. Steve picked up his shield and moved towards the door.
Bruce sighed. "Tony, Steve is as brittle as you are – as I am. I'm not sure what's holding him together right now, but then I'm not sure what holding me together either..."
Tony padded into the kitchen in stockinged feet, but even so Thor turned his head before he was through the open door, and put down the glass he was holding. "Anthony. How is our shield brother?"
But every muscle in his body was straining, and, for the first time, Tony saw sweat on Thor's brow.
"Well, it wasn't because I admired the tech," Tony retorted. "I'll get you a better one. I checked the shield too, but it seems to be clean. Jarvis thinks there's a tracking device on your bike, which is one of the reasons I insisted you leave it behind. I'll deal with it personally when we get back. So, do I lose him or lead him somewhere we can grab him and Bruce can suit up and scare the truth out of him?"
"That is so weird," Storm said. "No. I can't. I mean, Mom thought her boyfriend a tad obsessive, and too old for her, I know that, but he's dead too. In fact, he was the one who killed her – though I guess  if I'd been older I'd have been piloting that spacecraft, not Ben Grimm."
Jarvis had analysed the gas, but it was not on any database he could access, and he was not programmed for biological speculation – not Tony's speciality either.
By the time Tony emerged from stowing all three men below the walkway, Steve was in his underwear attempting to get into White Wolf's suit. He'd thought his Captain American uniform was tight, and the suit Tony had designed was no better, but White Wolf's was definitely going to pinch.
"Still somewhere in Wakanda, probably. It's a round room about fifteen feet across. I can't touch the ceiling or find a door. Or any furniture. "
"No!" Steve croaked.
Not that the serum was much use without the so-called 'vita-rays', whatever hid beneath that code name—
"Steve would have been even better. This guy claims to have known Chester Phillips. Phillips was—"
"You'll find out. Now, let's get this armour off."
And, because he was who he was, he stepped forward to face that anger when all he wanted to do was run for cover. "Tony, thank god you've gotten back from Wakanda in one piece. Are T'Challa and Okoye okay?
"Why?" Steve asked as, without asking or being asked, Hogun began helping him with the unfamiliar clothing. "What do you think he'll do?"
"Problem?" he asked, dumping his own bag beside an untouched small backpack.
"Just below the scapula. A little blood. Not currently bleeding. I would judge whatever it was didn't hit anything vital."
Jan had drawn back into a pitcher's stance. Now she hurled something small directly at the Hulk. The beast put out a hand to fend it off, and it exploded in a pink-tinged cloud.
Tony had to stop himself putting out an arm to protect it. "So, are the
Tony ignored him. "What the fuck did you think up were doing?" he snarled. "I thought you were over the committing suicide thing."
"Then lose the signal, chop chop. Okay, J, open hailing frequencies."
"You asked me not to set him looking for data on her," Tony pointed out. "And Bruce persuaded me not to risk it. I didn't want to lose your trust. That's why I went through Natasha."
"No. You're the one who's balancing on stilts—"
Steve looked suspiciously at Tony. "If it is on computer," he repeated. "Would you need to ... hack? ... SHIELD's computers again?"
"Well, apart from the dead guy in the lobby, that might well be the case. This stuff degrades quickly when exposed to air," Bruce told him. "On the other hand, it has a ... nasty ... effect on the autonomic nervous system."
Maybe.
"Vormir."
"Betty and I thought that might have been a cover story."
"The best choice. Volstagg the Valiant is on watch. When we leave it will be as the Warriors Three."
Tony took a deep breath, and made a decision he hoped he wouldn't regret. "Jarvis, make them aware that we know of their presence. Let them see the purchasing documents they were looking for and point them at those that show the amount of Palladium we've ordered. Also the initial specs – not the detail, just the outline – of the scaled up prismatic accelerators for the manufacture of – well, I guess we'd better stop calling it starkium or unobtainium or what-the-hellium so – vibranium. Let them see all our orders pertaining to it and our initial costings."
The files, they burned.
"I'll worry about them tomorrow. Right now I want you off our turf. Then
It exploded.
"I don't—"
Now he thought about it, he'd heard that voice coming from Stark's cell phone, once. "Artificial intelligence? You're a machine? A computer?"
Tony tapped his nose. "I smell a mystery."
"So bill me. I'm still trying to work out whether I can do the same to you for the damage to the foyer of my tower. By the way, unless those thugs were yours – and I do hope not – then there's a leak somewhere in SHIELD or with its masters, because they knew Captain America was the real thing. They came looking for Steven Grant Rogers and no-one else."
"So he did..." Unable to stop himself, Tony leaned in for a kiss.
Tony looked towards the looming machine Vita-ray machine with its human-shaped tank and there was a reckless glint in his eye. "It is very tempting, isn't it?"
In three days time, Tony and his Dad, Rhodey (on a weekend pass from the Air Force Academy), Rhodey's mother Roberta (if she broke free from that patent tangle), Happy (who was making a name for himself in the boxing ring when not working at his mechanic's apprenticeship), and Pepper and her father, would sit or sprawl watching bad geek movies while eating pizza, popcorn, and ice-cream, washed down with Coke, Dr Pepper, or beer.
"Your wish is my command, oh my captain. Except it's five miles to the highway – Christ, that was close! – and that'll be full of traffic."
"Are you sure the Vita-ray machine is no use without access to Erskine's lost serum?" Hank asked.
Tony's suspicions as to who was in that vehicle were confirmed when a question, originally in what was presumably Wakandan, arrived, in Italian, in the measured tones of his assigned interpreter.
"Great. Arrange for the usual bonus."
"You don't need—"
"Jim?" Betty asked.
He was rewarded with a grin. "I can imagine," Steve said.
"Yes. I'm Fandral. Sometimes called 'the dashing.' One third of the Warriors Three. And part of Thor's personal war band, for which he also claims you, so we are comrades in arms."
"No, but you have a terrific arm, lady.”
"God, don't," Tony groaned. "I'm frustrated enough as it is."
With a dreadful crack, a bolt of lightning hit exactly where they had been standing, throwing dirt and rock and concrete high into the air, and adding the reek of ozone to the smell of burnt bodies.
"He also helps me pilot the armour," Tony said, with a secretive smile.
"This mountain lies in the middle of the territory of the Panther tribe, and the chiefs of that tribe have, for many years, also been the kings of Wakanda, though ..." He faded into silence, seemingly lost in his own thoughts, then shook himself, and said, "Some three years ago our then king, T'Chaka, was contacted by outsiders offering high grade technology in return for vibranium. To be honest, we still distrusted your sudden change of heart, Stark, and suspected you of being the mind behind the offer, but Hunter, who T'Chaka had appointed head of the Hatut Zeraze, could find no evidence to implicate you."
Tony hadn't spoken about this woman – whether as Rescue or Patricia or Pepper – as if she was his girlfriend.
"I haven't decided whether I trust him or not," Tony replied evenly. "If he is the king of this country he shouldn't have put himself in his enemies' hands in order to rescue a couple of intruders that
"Did you say you didn't want to?" Steve asked, with interest.
Tiny Jan's voice – helpfully amplified by Jarvis – said, "Tony, was that...?"
Tony demanded.
"I have a proposition for—" But Thor had already gone.
"Yes, I find it suspicious. But I can't refuse, even if it wasn't Clint and Natasha in danger."
Pepper was white, her freckles standing out against her skin. "Are you sacking me, Mr Stark?"
– probably but not certainly someone else – also wants me dead. And they want the ARC reactor. Or the Iron Man. Maybe both. It's great to be popular. And I'm beginning to think we might be better off watching each other's backs than operating on our own."
Danvers snorted her disgust, and demanded reasons.
"Ulysses," Steve said promptly. "My parents had a Civil War thing, y'know." It had seemed appropriate when he had discussed it with Howard, what seemed like a lifetime ago. Ulysses, the wanderer, who had finally come home. Howard had said he would fix it: Steve hadn't been sure how and hadn't cared much – then.
"No! Steve, no!"
"Prove it."
Tony forced himself into Chairman of the Board mode, which was as much as he could currently manage. "A great honour. On behalf of the Avengers, I thank you, and hope we may remain friends and allies."
"If the pain had interfered with the pleasure, I would have definitely said 'No.' Look, Steve, sex – sexual relationships – are about negotiation. It isn't fair on you that I know exactly what I want while you're still trying things out, but that's why it's so important to let me know when you're... uncomfortable. I can't read your mind, babe, though I can make guesses from your body language—"
"Can he?" That was Steve, who had arrived a short time ago and somehow managed to make his way through to this consulting room without creating a scene.
Except that it was morning. Well, daylight was only a few hours away.
He woke instantaneously, all his senses alert, aware that the room was empty – he could not hear any breathing – but that he was warm and comfortable, naked between soft sheets.
As they started towards it, mental alarms began blaring through the pleasant alcoholic haze. There was something wrong about Happy's position in the front seat, about the fact that he was not already out of the car with the passenger door open for them
"Umm."
"No, sir. And I lost radio contact with Malibu and New York once we entered the hurricane."
"Oklahoma?" Hank suggested – the first word he had spoken since he had entered the room.
Tony asked himself. He didn't want to believe the obvious answer:
Not clouds, he realised as they drew closer, but smoke rising from the remains of burnt and shattered buildings, continually renewing the streamers as the wind caught them, the brightness of flame flashing at their base.
Very carefully, Tony untangled himself from Steve, climbed off the far side of the bed and limped awkwardly into the bathroom. Once there unzipped his fly and hurriedly jerked himself to orgasm in a few quick strokes, then leaned against the tiles and tried to catch his breath.
"Come on!" Tony grabbed T'Challa's arm. "Jarvis, garage express elevator to this floor," he ordered as he hustled T'Challa out of the door. Hank was right behind them.
"Take the artefact together," Clea said, holding it out, flat on both palms.
A slim woman who was only five foot two really should not have been able to push him back so easily. "Sleep," Jan repeated. "If anyone is going to use the couch, it'll be me. You wouldn't fit. But I'm going to go help Hank.
"Stubborn bastard," he whispered.
Tony winced inwardly. "She speaks for StarkIndustries, not for me or StarkEnergy. Over which she no longer has any power or influence."
"Apparently... ah. Tony sent a text to Pepper saying... ah...'Marry me, Pep.'"
"Jarvis, rewind the last thirty seconds, then play and bring up the sound," Tony ordered.
It was ironic, Tony thought, that he had promised to fuck Steve until he couldn't think straight, because he was the one who had somehow allowed Steve to root him out of bed in the pre-dawn dark, feed him coffee and pancakes, and chivvy him down onto the beach. Still, he was all too aware he had to cut Steve some slack after last night's misunderstandings.
The view was glorious – and he hated it. It was at once too similar to and too different from the one from the roof of Stark Tower, as if he was looking at Manhattan through a distorting mirror. The tall buildings and the stretches of water were what gave the place that disturbing familiarity, but the scale of Asgard was... colossal. Nor was Manhattan surrounded by rocky crags that looked almost as high as the Alps without either their white tops or green valleys.
"We did, once we finally got the reports and made the connection; the hangar's empty now. But the locals report a helicopter landing at that field five days after the Avengers took down the Chitauri, and maybe thirty six hours before we arrived. Which was so unusual as to merit their attention. The copter took off again about an hour after that."
Steve took a deep breath, then another. There was no pain but he felt incredibly weary.
Another of the gunmen lashed out at her with the butt of his rifle – an M-2 carbine, Tony noticed absently – but Jan had vanished before it made contact. Instead, the gun butt crashed into the side of the head of the man she had been fighting.
"I'll be needing the limo in an hour or so," Pepper protested.
"Yes, sir," Jarvis acknowledged, a sigh in his voice.
, dammit!"
"I won't trouble you again," Steve said in a dull voice, turning away because he didn't want Tony to know how vulnerable he had become to his angry tongue, but his weakness betrayed him. He stumbled, and the scabbarded sword he was wearing somehow tangled with his legs, pitching him forward to crash to the floor, his head only just missing the flight of white marble steps that led to a ridiculous red concert grand, knocking the breath out of his body.
"Jan is going to murder us," Steve said softly to Tony as the Avenger jets raced southward through the pre-dawn dark.
"Not exactly. Betty located her father, and we went in – and then Avengers' Tower didn't seem like a good place to run, which left Malibu and Tony. And we damn near didn't make it, except you were there and so plainly in love with Tony that I could have cheered."
"Makes sense," Steve said, quickly forestalling the pending argument, and looking sternly at Tony, who shrugged, then turned and addressed the armour.
Betty frowned at her. "And don't think I don't know who nagged Bruce into contacting me."
He turned left and continued to wade, following the shoreline until, quite suddenly, the mud cliff dipped into a creek.
"Ms. Potts? Really?! Please, just call me Pepper." She said amusingly. Steve smiles again and proceeds to give her a hand shake.
"Are you... Alright?" Steve croaked, not noticing that his mouth grew dry.
He thought suddenly.
The brunet once again awaited his response but before Steve could, a very hyper-active Kamala Khan entered the room. Giggling to herself, while checking something out on her phone. Making both men laugh in amusement.
Tony didn't even process the thought. He knew what Steve was meaning. And it was taking the genius so much not to completely lose himself. As he began his entry is when he caught sight of Steve leaving the confined space. "Wait! Where are you going?".
Hope you guys are doing well. Don’t forget to comment, and leave a kudos!
"Who is this?" He answered groggily. Voice filled with the croaking sensation of someone who just got up from a well-deserved nap.
The memory dissolves from his brain as a noise catches Steve's attention. It was muffled but it sounded close. It gets quiet, and again he hears it once more. The realization that it's the sound of their dog wailing in peril makes Steve's blood freeze in horror.
Natasha Romanov didn't know what to do anymore. 4 years, she's been sitting in this godforsaken lounge, sipping on some coffee, she had made. Her presence being the only soul there at the compound.
Bring up the 5 years without the Avengers, or without Steve, and Tony would laugh in your face. This was a completely different type of sleeplessness. A dark, self-hating, time for the philanthropist.
"Thanks, Tony."
"I... I don't know what to say..." he uttered softly.
But Steve normally doesn't get sick like this, really at all. Since the serum, he hasn't had to deal with the many issues he had had beforehand. I mean he did get sick from time to time, but he hasn't felt this nauseated in a long time. It was odd.
Sure they were on the run. But the apartment that Vision and Wanda shared, in the upstate of Wales, was surely an upgrade from before.
"Good," Steve stated nonchalantly.
"Sure? But hurry it, me and Pepper are finally going to get some alone time.".
Yet there he was going. Right up to the large doors leading into the main foyer of the building. He pushed one of the doors inward, and instantly froze.
"Jesus..." mumbled Bruce.
I guess Loki's comment earlier, had an influence on Tony Stark's alcoholic needs. But honestly, after literally almost being destroyed from throwing a missile into a intergalactic portal, falling to a very certain death, until being saved by Hulk-Buster. Alcohol wasn't the worse thing on his mind. But asking if the Shawarma Palace had alcohol was an understatement, considering the state it was in.
The 'scarlet witch' felt her cheeks hot and blushed obliviously. She took a nearby napkin and blotted her mouth, before taking their plates into the kitchen.
"Sure man. I'd love to. So I guess that is our second date then?".
Sam didn't have his wings, let alone his weapons. Steve didn't have his shield, which was for a completely irrelevant reason. His suit was tattered, and he could feel the pain, around his head area, grow with vigorous relevancy.
And for last night, the group didn't want to risk heading out, as they had already traveled a good distance with the lead they were tipped on. For which, it lead to the decision to stay in and order some seafood.
"Are you that relieved to see me?" The soldier brought a mischievous smile to his face.
’But I mean, they'll be okay, with time. They'll get through this.’ The soldier looked to his feet, before taking his gaze back to the lake. He really wanted to believe that Morgan, but mostly Pepper, could move on from this. However, the sheer haunting memory of him, is what will be the true ghost to overcome. For both of them, and him.
"So... that's why you and Captain America aren't actually speaking?!" Peter yelled.
"I'm... leaving. Hopefully for a shorter amount of time." He said hoping that the joke, he added, would lift some of the tension. It didn't.
His neck was beginning to cramp up with his constant head-turning. He'd looked left, then right, then in front, then behind, then right again. Steve did this numerous times.
The negative thoughts quickly dispersed from his head, as his daughter caught his attention. She was smacking her fork on the dining table. It's ringing noise strangely louder than usual.
Tony's eyes were now covered in tears again. His glistening, wet eyelashes, made the super-soldier feel awful. 'God, why did I make him do this. He's hurting, you dumbass! You should've just let it go, and kept your mouth shut!' He thought aggravatingly.
"Ain't that the damn truth!" Bucky chuckled.
Yet the true desire of their situation was in their eyes. They were hell-bent on never wanting to look away from each other. Squints came and went, but their gazes never left.
"Huh? Oh! Yes, yes of course!" She said. Clearly upset at being interrupted, but Tony didn't seem to care.
As she reached the doorframe, she noticed the window wide open, and the sound of metal clacking outside of it. The man stupidly took the fire escape, up to the rooftop. Nat actually smugly smiled, and crawled through the window. She noticed that he was a few flights up, and so she flew up each stairway.
"Alright Lovebirds, lets get this show on the road!" Nat announced.
"Please, don't do that. Don’t pity me." Tony complained.
Steve's face crinkled a little.
"You, Picky! Never!" Tony teased.
Judging by certain clues on the board, and his own mindset right now, it finally gave Tony the confirmation that he needed. All the recent photos, so easily taken as if they deliberately stood in front of the photographer. Maybe, they did want Tony to see them, but only him.
"Is the 'Something Stupid' Me?"
"Hmph? Oh, sure! Yea, I'm just... lost in my head is all." Steve smiled unconvincingly.
"Oh, you mean this," Tony touched the reactor with ease, so use to its presence. "Well... Cap it's a pretty long story.".
"Lovebird?"
Steve did let go of his arm, feeling that he kind of crossed a line. As Tony continued to look at him. Focusing on his facial expression to see if it was genuine. It was. 'Did he really just grab my arm? Better question would be, why Steve thought demanding me to give himself an answer was a good plan? 'Cause low en behold, it worked.' Tony thought.
"For yourself, dumbass. At least somewhere else where you can have a clearer mind. Somewhere other than this depressing hovel you call an apartment.". Tony insisted.
But as if it was a light switch turning on, a certain memory suddenly filled Natasha’s brain. Almost like an alarm system, it gave her an answer to a question. A question she would ask Steve all the time, since their time out here, which was always responded with an ‘I don’t want to talk about it’.
He didn’t say anything. His face hadn’t changed, yet his eyes stayed glued on the soldier. Steve looked to the philanthropist and waited for his response. Maybe his laugh was overstepping.
“No, you're fine. It’s just, the last year... hasn’t been the greatest. And I’m honestly ready for the New Year to come.” Tony acknowledged. It sounded as if he was stumbling with his words. But he gave the teen a warm smile.
"Did you not hear anything I said earlier?! My mind is made up! And honestly, how dare you! It seems you forget how hypocritical you are. Because I seem to recall that it was your shit that we had to deal with all those years back!" He yelled, "I honestly think the reason you'd want to have sex with me is because, once it was all said and done; like the great Stark tradition, I'd be sent away. Just like all the others! Kicked to the curb, like some damn whore!"
Unbeknownst to him, Tony, who arrived just after Nat and Steve's discussion, was standing behind him smirking. He found Steve acting nervous kind of adorable. After Steve thanked the confused employee, Nat, Pepper, had sat at the other end of the table. Fury and Hill behind them, were talking privately amongst each other.
"You know, if you need something to do. You can always come down to Malibu with me and Pepper." Tony answered, "I'm sure there are many things that could occupy you. Maybe even finding some good landscapes to draw down there.".
Tony wasn't even paying attention to him at this point, as his eyes were glued to the outside streets of Manhattan. The streets were covered in snow, as the Christmas season was once again upon them. Yet the usual holly-jolly festivities, weren’t going to be that merry this year. This holiday was going to be vastly different.
"Yes, yes, yes. I hear ya!" Steve shouted as Tony began walking back to his car to retrieve his phone.
"Why are these injured people not in the hospital?" Steve inquired.
Dusk began to break, and it was an utter sight to behold upon the 'Shield Spaceship', Tony would call it. Still damaged from their earlier attack, Fury ordered that they fly at a lower altitude. Steve, Nat, and Bruce were deep in sleep, in their staterooms, while Thor, Fury, and Tony were gazing upon the night sky, discussing some urgent matters, on how to fix up parts of the city. And Clint was in the cargo hold, calling his wife. God, how he missed Laura's voice. These missions would feel like centuries, away from home. And yet each time he would return, it would feel like no time had passed. Clint does remember of a discussion he had with her, before he left to handle the Tesseract issue.
"Just because I'm human doesn't mean that it was a valid reason for what I did. 'I'm only human' sounds more like an excuse." Steve kept his gaze on the green giant.
Steve took a few more sips of his whiskey. He didn’t know how to respond right away. So Tony took over.
"Your rather brutal for a woman." Tony teased while grabbing his shoulder.
Back up on the bridge, Fury would hear the annoying A.I. System announce that one of their jets was compromised. He was about to tell one of the agents to fire up some fighter pilots, until the A.I. informed them that it was gone. And just like that The Avengers were off.
Feeling this close again, brought back all those feelings and emotions. It hit them both like a freight train. All the rawness of their first kiss, their first battle in New York, their altercation in Siberia. It all flooded their minds. The heat of the argument was slowly but surely evaporating away from them.
But it was time to stop wussing out. That's not who he was. He was an honest man, someone with character and heart. And leading Pepper on, as if nothing is wrong, is surely a dick move. Looking down at his star emblem, he felt unworthy of it for a moment. It was time to step up, and be an honorable man.
"Oh no..."
The soldier let a chuckle loose, but instantly regretted it. The oysters really did fight back, and this was delivered food. Again, Steve found it odd that simple seafood made him sick. Maybe it wasn't prepared right? Or the restaurant staff knew who he was, and thought poisoning him would be better than a conversation.
A dozen or so Hydra agents stood around a clear plasma container. The blue and purple shots of electric energy smacked at the glass with vengeance. Some of the agents stumbling back a bit, at their close proximity.
His mother, Sarah, came into the festive room and stood at the opposite end of the table, cutting what seemed like a piece of meat.
"Yes...".
As his eyes looked back to the philanthropist, he could see Tony’s composure start to deflate. Which was a very rare occurrence.
After a few hours of jogging, running, then just lazily dragging on through the forest. Steve and Sam weren't even on the same playing field as exhausted.
He then heads over to a cluttered table filled with tools, and gadgets. The blonde doesn't remember why he has the tools. But he likes to think they were for landscaping.
No one was around, or even in sight. He peered out to the front lawn. Pepper's car was there, along with Steve's. Tony was a bit confused, 'where is everybody?'.
"Correct. But do you know what it means, Kid?" Steve queried.
Her soft morning eyes headed to the alarm clock on their right bedside table. It read: 6:30 a.m.
It's one of the reasons why the last house in Philadelphia didn't work out. He could already see the story there. And it wasn't anything promising. So, Steve needed to see the inside as it was either going to make or break his decision. Not just for the house, but for looking in general. He really wanted this to work out.
Suddenly, a loud crash was heard in the distance. It came from Steve's quarters. And that terrified Tony even more. All sorts of worse case scenarios began to fill his head. He rushed over to Steve's door and was about to knock before the door opened.
“WW4?” Wanda pondered.
“Sure I will. If you let Cap give you the ‘D’!”.
Once again, he gave even more kisses onto Tony's lips. Eventually lifting his head back up, for another breath of air. Looking down to the philanthropist, Steve slightly smirked, as Tony was so flustered with emotions. The pink hue collecting to his cheeks and around his eyes, almost like a teenager blushing.
"Same question to you, but with my added question of: Why Ms. Potts isn't joining you?" He joked.
Steve thanked him and headed up to the counter for something delicious. He skimmed the menu, and found some pigs in a blanket, rather tasty.
"What is it?" She inquired.
"Oh, I promise you will!" The man affirmed.
A popping noise is what drew Tony back to the present day. He rubbed his eyes a bit, not realizing that his staring out into the embers, drew his eyes up a bit.
Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock,
"Hi, uh, Tony." He stated softly.
"No, Tony. I'm telling you that I don't like the house." Steve was trying to look everywhere else than Tony's eyes. He knew that if he even took a glance at them, he'd break.
"Tell me something we don't know," Tony smirked, and shortened the space between them.
Both men awkwardly tapped their hands on the counter, and cleared their throats. Tony instantly got up, grabbed a bottle from behind the bar. And poured his ‘Rusty Nail’ into a small glass. Before sitting back next to Steve.
"Without it, you certainly would have been."
And he didn't have a tablet or laptop with him.
"We have not met," the warrior said. "My lady has hidden— I need to get back before she returns and realises I am gone. I can use the portal—"
As the noise abruptly cut off, he raised his head and snapped, "JARVIS, I told you—" breaking off abruptly as he recognised Steve. For a moment he looked startled, and possibly a little worried, but the welcoming smile appeared genuine and there was no slur at all in his voice, as he said, "Hi, Cap. What're you doing here? No, never mind. It's good to see you. Grab yourself a drink."
Steve was turning an interesting shade of red. "I wanted to know... if there was any chance because sometimes you'd say things – though Jan said you say that kind of thing to everyone," he amended.
"Kids are pretty unlikely considering the serum altered my DNA," Steve retorted. "Not to mention it didn't alter my personal... preferences."
The woman seated in an expensive and modern executive chair that was so out of place behind the huge Victorian mahogany desk had no such difficulty in maintaining her dignity as she took off her reading glasses and frowned at them both.
Oh, fuck, he could not be distracted by worrying about Pep's possible treachery right now.
Fury, however, merely shrugged. "You'd have done the same if we'd actually let you into that lab again. So would your friend Banner."
And he was damn sure that, if it wasn't for her, both he and T'Challa might be dead.
Then, suddenly, his hand was caught in a warm grasp. There was weight tugging at him. A voice he
T'Challa spoke a few words in answer in a language that did not sound Wakandan – plainly a greeting – then switched to English. "This is Okoye. She is one of the Dora Milaje, my ceremonial bodyguard, and the first I appointed."
"Steve, don't..."
And that was the paradox, because Tony was as real a person as he'd ever met; frighteningly intelligent, with a razor sharp wit and as many prickles as a porcupine, a reckless courage that made his continued survival miraculous, the arrogance and pragmatism he projected real enough, despite the way he used them to shield his idealism and compassion, just as he used his charm to conceal his ruthlessness.
"Of course I believe him! But I've been through the files. None of it means anything to me. I don't remember my childhood, or World War 2, or any of the people they say I fought with: Namor, Torch, Bucky, Spitfire, Toro, Union Jack. They mean nothing. Nothing! But I remember Tony. Xavier confirmed that. I remember Tony but he saw different versions of Tony in my memory, hundreds of them; fighting them, fighting beside them, being friends with them, arguing with them... I know fighting moves I shouldn't. Hell, I know words I shouldn't. Something terrible has happened. Captain America was dead. I'm alive and in his body." Steve paused, drawing shuddering breath after shuddering breath.
Little pieces of evidence had kept appearing that worried him even more.
Steve rolled his eyes. "Tony..."
"No."
"I presume Van Dyne was at Malibu—" Pepper went on.
"Sir," Jarvis said, "your blood alcohol level is—"
There was a stunned silence.
grateful that you came to claim your turf today. There's this galoot who's been camping out in your dining room as often as he can. He's also been pressuring Miranda' – that's me – 'to tell him who owns the lease so he can buy it out.'"
"I don't think they did. I mean, I don't think the helicopter had anything to do with the people trying to kidnap Betty," Jan said. "The guys in the SUVs only had ordinary weapons and they were awfully polite about taking her."
Iron Man hovered a few inches above the mud so his eyes were on a level with Deputy Director Hill's. She was seated in the grounded SHIELD aircar she was using as a command vehicle and pretending to ignore him.
"Like 'London SW1'?" Steve said, surprising everyone.
But when he pushed unlocked the red button and held it down, nothing happened.
Not as bad as Steve had feared, but not good either. "Damn it, the face fungus fooled me. Not to mention you don't act like a teenager."
"Damn right I will. Wait, Thor, when you've finished come to the tower. Stark tower."
do anything to harm you?"
"She would say she had laid a spell on you. But, friend Tony, sending the stone to the bottom of the sea was well done. Very well done indeed."
It was dark, save for the tiny flecks of luminescence in the rock and the reflected glow of the firebox. Of course, no daylight could penetrate this far underground, and he had no watch, so he had no idea how long he had slept.
"As Loki found out, I don't bluff," Tony lied cheerfully. Well, he wasn't bluffing. Not this time. "Oh, by the way, in case you hadn't guessed, Jarvis has been recording since I landed. The Wakandans will hold the vid against a double cross.”
Tony felt the ground begin to drop away beneath his feet. "Steve—"
All Tony could do in response was to hug him.
Julia stuck her tongue out at her mother, grinned at Tony, and made her exit, though Tony was pretty sure her ear would be pressed against the door within moments.
"Who knew I was here? It was your car, coming from a place where you own the lease on a dining room, not far from the house you built. No, this one was aimed at you. Mostly, though, this attack was incompetent – and by all accounts Rhodes isn't."
"Thanks." Steve scooped up the red-fletched arrows with his left hand, without touching the bows, and hopped up onto the seat to stand upright, looking to the rear, balancing with ease on braced legs, despite the way the vehicle banked and bucked its way through the forest.
"Roger, Iron Man."
God, he really needed to examine Cap's shield. Vibranium steel – his father had said that in his hearing. His interrogators had said the ARC reactor was fuelled by vibranium and talked as if they had access to a natural source. It all added together, but would these people talk to him? At the very least, if they were satisfied he was manufacturing vibranium rather than buying it from an illegitimate source they might leave him alone.
"So you interrogated me in Washington, and hacked my systems," Tony said.
"You were taking a chance there," Steve said. "One word from me and you would have been the one barred from eating Miranda's cooking ever again."
Only Thor had made Earth and, and Steve himself, his business.
But even if that would work, even if Pepper would come back to him – and the odds on that were depressingly low – even if he could trust her – and he couldn't, not really – it would be using her. He had done enough of that in the past, placed her in danger too often, made promises he couldn't keep. He would not do it again.
It was plain who had been the better man. What's more, he'd had the last word.
"I'll get Jarvis to scan it and see if he can pick up any latent prints," Tony said. "And J, do we still have that worm in the helicarrier's systems?"
"What? But— Her exact words, Steve."
It was one of the round, not-huts that he had observed on the way in, linked to the main building by a verandah-like walkway raised maybe four feet above the baked earth.
Relaxing in the hot bubbling water, highball glass in hand – because he had little hope that Steve would arrive with anything alcoholic – Tony finally felt the tension ease out of his muscles.
Steve let out a silent breath of relief. Tony was, it seemed, merely drunk, and an amiable rather than an aggressive drunk at that. Except, in the instant before he had looked up there had been an expression of such intense misery on his face that it made Steve catch his breath. Jarvis was right; Tony needed help, though he almost certainly would reject anything Steve offered.
"That's kind of you, but unless..." Their eyes locked for what seemed like an age. Pepper's expression was uncertain and Tony suddenly realised what she might be asking, offering... but he knew he couldn't answer that, at least not in words.
It was not like any laboratory Tony had ever seen, but it was nearly as well equipped as the ones he had set up for Bruce and Hank in their hidden Oklahoman base. What was more, the computers had been made by Stark Industries, though they seemed heavily customised. He didn't like to think of how that had been achieved, but hoped that SI had been paid appropriately.
Steve couldn't really see the connection. "Has anyone else touched it and experienced the same effects?" he asked cautiously.
"I know, I know. I meant the Carter woman."
"What's this?"
A different voice interrupted. "Mr Stark, I have the UN Ambassadors from Kenya and Tanganyika in reception, together with their entourages. They are insisting on speaking to you tonight..."
"I'm sure that's what Fury intended," Tony said coldly. "Nice cosy chats. Tie Steve even closer to SHIELD. Didn't work like that. And if Coulson made the fakes obvious, he was the one who spoiled the plot." He liked the thought of that. Steve would like it too, when he told him.
Pepper nodded, though she was still looking at him as if he had grown a second head. Perhaps the Van Dyke was coming in faster and thicker than he believed.
"Howard," the other man corrected.
That jogged Steve's memory, the voice of a man now dead: "Shuri is in France and oblivious to what is happening."
Normally when they fought the reasons were clear cut and once it was over they quickly settled back into their – admittedly occasionally emotionally bumpy – friendship, with no resentment lost or gained. But it hadn't been like that last night. Once Tony's temper had cooled – and, boy, was his own reaction too damn revealing of his feelings – he realised that Steve was, for some reason, being as careful around him as he would have been walking through a minefield.
"You're a definitely a billionaire – there weren't any in my day, but then with inflation – and a philanthropist. There's no doubt about your genius. What you didn't mention was how darn kind you are."
Tony put a finger on her lips, but he noted that she was angry rather than heartbroken even though her eyes were brimming with tears. "We had maybe three dates, Pep. Nearly a year ago. I've moved on. I supposed that you had too."
Jarvis's voice changed, becoming deeper, but distorted: "Mr Stark: Our sincere apologies. Your expertise is admirable. We are hopeful we will be able to say the same about your motives. Until then, remember we'll be watching."
Each day with Tony had been a gift, and now each night was a treasure.
Tony said to Steve, with utter certainty, "You are not the man who originally wore that body, but the only part of him that survived death is part of you, even if his memories aren't."
"Not in this timeline," Tony said.
"Lie down, Tony. Sleep," Jan ordered.
"Did you recognise them too, Bruce?" Tony asked "Is that why you lied to Fury?"
"Then, unless you can see in the dark, you'd better let me take the controls."
Left isolated on the Greenway, Steve had become all too aware that people were playing 'spot-the-superhero' and felt incredibly self-conscious and exposed to every cell phone in the vicinity. He shifted his shield to his left arm and was wondering if he ought to exercise his rusty PR skills when the realised that the powerful man in the dark suit making his way as casually as he could – which wasn't very – through the growing crowds was not only vaguely familiar but someone he recognised – Tony's chauffeur-cum-bodyguard who had been introduced to him simply as 'Happy'.
"Have y'all ate or anything?" He asked.
Hope you guys are doing well, and staying safe! ✌️🏻👌🏻🤠
"I've tried to call you guys for weeks now! What's going on over there? Are you guys alright?" Tony groaned.
Tony shrugged it off and headed to the kitchen to check on the soup he was making. He was stirring the pot when Steve entered the kitchen. He was taking everything in at once.
'Honestly why? Why do I keep running after this man?' He thought laughingly, as he too ran back into the house.
"Ugh! Why did I have to do that! Better question would be, why I kinda liked it. Oh god, No! That happened only once, it was uncomfortable. I don't swing that way." He complained softly. His back and forth bickering to himself, was not something he wanted to deal with today. A knock from his door, startled him back to reality. The door opened, and there stood Nat.
The two just smiled at each other.
"Wait, why is that?" Clint asked.
Morgan had become Tony's main reason for staying far away, from really what's left of the Avengers. His salvation to a better life. No more playboy filled nights, no more killing himself each time the Avengers needed a reunion, and a chance to finally be happy.
Once their laughing subsided, Steve finally sat at one of the empty chairs by the table. There was one opposite his, that seemed to be occupied beforehand, but wasn't anymore.
Her gaze was fixed upon the duo before a shuffling noise from behind them, which made the trio look to the back of the war room. It was a bin filled with leftover AIM bots being pushed by some SHEILD agents.
With their division, we will now jump ahead to after the events of Civil War. Comment down below some theories! If you enjoy, don’t forget to leave a kudos, man.
The Captain cheesed. He profusely thanked the genius, before Tony groggily said that he lend some trucks for Steve to use as well. Before wondering how Tony strangely had trucks to spare, the super-soldier once again thanked him, as he then ended the call.
, need to be in the right headspace for that
Nat and Clint just stayed quiet. They knew that any more input would only cause more turmoil. But Natasha felt her tears flow down her cheek. Ever since that day, no matter where, no matter how hard she's tried to forget that face. It would appear to her. In the bathroom, the living area, her bedroom; no where was safe from her guilt. Even after all this time, and all she's experienced since. Her truest regret was the horrifying thought, that her true nature would come out. The nature that she was a monster.
He had heard all about what happened with Pepper and the infamous 'Mandarin'. It was one of the few times that he wished Tony wasn't so stubborn, in calling the group to help. Or hell, to at least call him or Natasha. Finally telling his brain to shut up, he softly walked into the diner.
For everyone this morning, if you weren't feeling your hands or seeing your breath. Then your mind must've frozen over. Sometime in the early morning, the Chimera's initiator cores lost power momentarily. In doing so, all necessities, like the temperature being set at 70 degrees exactly, was compromised. The "How" on the initiator cores malfunctioning was the current topic/discussion in the common area.
Yet, as the day came to a close and nothing was ever said about either's experiences. It seemed not telling just became a lot easier.
"I know! I'm proud of myself for that one."
Tony could see the authenticity in Steve's response, his posture, his tone, his everything! He really was telling the truth. All the more reason for Tony's mindset to be completely diminished at this point.
"Yes, yes I am. It's quite beautiful on the outside, so I'm hoping I can say the same for the inside as well." Steve clasp his hands together nervously.
"Look I just... I... Christ! I don't know what to do anymore?!" Tony screamed in frustration.
"What was she like?" Tony asked cautiously. Even though he didn't want to pry, he was curious as to know who was the mother of Captain Amer-No, Steve Rogers.
"Hello?!" He shouted into the abyss.
"Uh? What are you doing?" He inquired.
That means they took the weapons. And Steve and Sam aren't responding.
He remembers finding a place similar to this in New Hampshire. It was a 2 bedroom, little thing, 950 sq ft. in total. You'd think the size was the reason Steve rejected it since the blonde was looking for something a bit bigger. But actually, it came down to the fact that Steve didn't care much for how broken down the house seemed. Even if he agreed to fix it up, he would've needed to completely gut the interior out and start from there. And to the super-soldier, that just seemed like a lot of unnecessary work for such a small place.
Natasha moved her body a little to better face him.
"What?! Like you could do better?!" She whined, before ducking away toward a crate.
After leaving her room, she headed down the stairs into the living area. Where she could spot her husband in the kitchen. He seemed flustered, looking in a cookbook, and silently cursing to himself.
"For Sokovia. For leaving you, and not giving you an explanation. Not... giving us a chance, because of my own insecurities." Bruce let his response flop out of his mouth in resentment toward himself.
Tony's pitiful protests were silenced as she hit the 'end call' button. Whilst throwing the phone across the room. The anger came back.
There was a play, being held at some theatre, somewhere outside of Fairburn, and Pepper thought it would be a good idea to let Morgan go see it. Trying to make it seem, to her and herself, that the world hadn't wasted away after Thanos.
"Judging by the fact that I see no furniture inside. Nor do I see a car in sight. I'd say signs point to yes." Tony offered as he looked through, what seemed to be the downstairs, living room window.
His hand flew back down to his side. He swallowed and fixed his coat that he was wearing. The walking inside seemed to be heading for the door. Steve licked his lips, took some breaths, stretched his collar, ran his fingers through his hair, tapped his feet. The door opened.
Tony walked over to her and placed a kiss on her forehead. "Good Morning, Sweetie.".
The sun rays blinding him, momentarily. Corny as it sounded, Tony thought he died and entered heaven itself. To his disappointment, he was just asleep in Steve's room.
Steve scowled, "Just let me be an overprotective, pseudo-father, figure for one day please."
"Hmm? Oh, of course. Please forgive me of that." Her tone cracked from a clear attempt at conviction.
The super-soldier bought them the gift to bring the two young girls closer. And ironically, ever since then, those two have non-stopped argued about who's turn it was to play with the doll. Sometimes Steve humors the idea of the doll being alive and having a vendetta against him. Eager to drive them further & further apart, just to make his life hell.
"Well tell her that we miss her, and that's she's doing okay," Pepper added.
And even, at one point, made the super-soldier feel amorously blissful. A miscellaneous act as one would put it. That left the soldier vulnerable, sweat-soaked, and strangely satisfied that it occurred.
Annie finally smiled. A sweet, genuine, smile. Her eyes gleaming with joy. And that was enough for the blonde to lean over and place a kiss on her forehead.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yea we do!" Clint said amusingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he stopped the car near a hotel, he picked his phone out of his right pocket. Instantly, he realized it was the burner phone. He flicked the head of it up, and saw the name and number already there.
"So... that was sex." Steve presumed.
“Yeah. That was a pretty awful move on my part.”.
Even though she understood his duty, she was always the one to pick up the pieces after his or the Avengers takedowns. With Sokovia being the straw that broke the camels back.
"Good evening, Captain. Or really, I should say morning." Tony chuckled.
Pepper, who witnessed the events of New York from her commercial flight, was worried sick. She stayed in constant contact with Fury afterward. Once her plane landed in a still operating airport, she eventually knew of her boyfriend's whereabouts, and found him. She then gathered her things, and up she went with Shield on their carrier. Tony and the team however, wouldn't be on the ship till afternoon.
Clint just looked astounded. He didn't think Tony would do something so reckless, yet so open. He turned to a completely wrecked Tony. 'My god! Please stop looking at me! Jesus, Would he tell Pepper?' He thought frighteningly. He felt his stomach twist and start to cramp.
'How does Tony deal with this much appraisal and not feel overwhelmed?!'.
“So now that we’ve explained ourselves can we go see them now? And sell some drugs while we're at it."
Until recently. Like I before mentioned, their infatuation with each other only grew. Every simple little smile, laugh, or even cry that they had shared, only seemed to catapult their emotions.
"With a personality like yours, it's no wonder you think Pepper is messing around with someone like me." Steve joked.
Steve leaned his forearm on the doorframe, "I'd ask why you're here, and how you found me. But I already have my suspicions: Shield.".
Steve didn't answer, as Tony was well ahead up the stairs to the first set of apartments. The philanthropist came up to the door, and turned around, waiting for the 'man out of time' to catch up. He smiled as Steve smugly walked up to him.
"May I ask about what?" Peter proposed.
Natasha, just simply never ate it. She would take quick trips in and out of town, for her meals. Gathering together the essential meats, fruits, and sometimes grains. But only enough for her.
Natasha laid, once more, upon the bed, quiet and thinking. Suddenly a revelation hit her like a bullet. She could think of a plan. Or hell, she can try and find the clues herself.
Steve lets the usual promiscuous events to follow afterward, clear out his brain noise as he finally reaches the entrance to the boathouse. He slides the massive, main doors to it open, and heads inside. Firstly, he walks to each post and tightens the rigging on each of them.
Tony now really started to feel the effects, of Steve's changes in rhythm. Along with himself getting a bit more louder. Being loud, especially during sex, was always an annoyance to himself. But to Steve, it was as if he could hear the sweet sound of heaven.
He was near inches from the front door. Well, the screen door before the actual main door-You get my point?! His hand had turned into the signature 'knocking on door' formation.
“Hmph, yes?”.
But what most dumbfounded the duo, was at the fact, that it was easy. It was so easy to break out, and leave the shelter. That’s when it finally dawned on them that it was a setup. They wanted them to think that they had an upper hand.
Nat, for the first time, believed him. Looking into Tony's eyes, she could see his sincerity. She held him a few seconds longer, before finally releasing. Tony then made a sharp inhale, to joke with her. This of course was received by a punch to the shoulder.
"Why are you down there?" Steve asked, finally noticing Tony's strange position he was in.
The super-soldier called to the retriever and headed back up to the house. Conflicting thoughts raving on, in his head, if he should tell Tony or not. If he
"Funny, Tony. Anyway... I..." Steve felt his palms drip with sweat. His stomach kept doing somersaults. And if that wasn't enough evidence to show Steve's nervousness. His determination to not look Tony in the eyes should've been a dead ringer for the philanthropist.
Finally, the spark came again, and the vehicle revved up. Which was sweet music to the super-soldier ears.
"Thank You, Pepper. Truly, you really didn't have to be this understanding. You easily could've kicked me out, and probably throw a hex on me while you were at it." Steve jested.
“Hey, can I tell you something,” Steve uttered softly.
Pepper pondered a bit, but still chose to head outside. "I'm going to have a look around." She stated. The blonde slowly could hear her husband's response fade from earshot, as she was already out the door.
"It grew awkwardly silent, so then I asked what we should do about it, or really how to fix it. Because you can't have a wife and kid, and still want me.".
Sokovia’s casualties were catastrophic, and left the Avengers shaken. But it was the accidental casualties in Wakanda that definitely had major repercussions for them.
Honestly, the one time he gets to kiss this man. That’s all he can do!
“What happened?”
"See that's the thing. We weren't even really good friends. We were just kind of like pals. We never really agreed on a lot of things. And besides the whole thing with our... kiss. It was just that." Steve confided.
"Hell, just seeing a naked Tony would be a sight that no one wants to see." He amusingly protested.
She discreetly looked for any signs of a dishonest reason. Even if he replied, she could at least tell if he was lying to her or not. Vision made be a mad scientist's creation, with the knowledge/I.Q higher than Bruce Banner, Tony Stark, and Erik Selvig combined. But it didn't mean he was a saint who never lied to protect her.
"Off you go then."
he corrected that thought, as he looked down.
Less than an hour later, in his most expensive bespoke grey suit, white shirt and grey tie, he was standing at the head of the table in the boardroom, his eyes roving over the immaculate men (and one woman) who made up the Stark Industries board, seeing the curiosity in their eyes, despite their bland expressions.
"I am," Tony replied. "I just wish that they'd never filmed
"Do it, Jarvis," Steve ordered.
Tony snorted. "Jarvis is an AI. He can't worry. I didn't program it."
"Why didn't Howard destroy this himself?" he asked plaintively. "Why put it onto me? I don't have enough information about this time to make a correct decision."
Every muscle in Steve's body was tensed, as he cursed his helplessness. If he had really been Captain America he would have been able to protect Tony and Jean, help Clea, but... he... could... not.
They were members of the Ten Rings – they deserved no less.
went rogue."
The right corner of Steve's lips quirked upwards. "Did they? I guess you're better informed than I am. I never asked. Guess all that 'back-pay' is a SHIELD lie too."
Steve looked with satisfaction at the ingredients lined up on the worktop beside the stove – pasta and the meatballs he had defrosted using the microwave, fresh tomatoes, basil and olive oil that he was going to blitz in the blender, parmesan, lettuce for a salad, and good bread and butter.
"Enhanced?" Natasha's voice asked.
Tony hadn't wanted him to see the telltale changes in his eyes that meant he was accessing machines with Extremis. But now he had the lead he wanted, and a whole lot of that promising information downloaded, he needed just a few more seconds...
Tony opened his eyes just enough to see Steve's face limned in the light of the arc reactor. It took far too long to work out that he was lying on the floor with his head in the other man's lap.
"Do not do that, Captain," Jarvis cautioned urgently. "Not if you value his life and your freedom."
"I think," Steve said, "that that's one of the reasons Tony made Jarvis the way he is – to remind him of his humanity when his mind has soared to places the rest of us can't reach."
"Kneel before Doom!" the robot, or whatever it was, boomed, reaching out one handed, hooking the steel gauntlet underneath the edge of a sleek sports car and, without effort, sending the vehicle rolling towards Howard, who scuttled away. The sports car hit what looked like a super-charged sports wagon, in a thunder of crushing bodywork.
"The government compound," N'kendi said, as more of those ceremonial warriors paced towards the SUV. They were wearing what looked like a form of lightweight armour, but Tony could see only edged weapons. None of the warriors carried anything that looked like a modern projectile weapon.
Bruce was also grinning, possibly at his own joke, possibly at Hank, who had taken a couple of steps into the room, careful of the carpet of ants at his feet, to reveal that the insect-like head was, in fact, a helmet with antennae and a jaw-encircling comms unit – a fact which Tony knew because he had built it for him.
"If Hill's there that would be about right. Let me—"
Clea's silver brows wrinkled in puzzlement. She stretched out a hand towards Steve, fingers spread. "You... are an enigma. You read both young and very old, weak and powerful. And then..." The hand moved towards Tony and her eyes widened. "I don't know what you are. I don't know what he is." Her chin went up, "But I know you belong together." She turned to Steve. "If you die, do you suppose your soul-mate here would survive for long?"
"Sorry, Pep. No more time." Tony cut contact and glared about him at his fellow Avengers. "What's going on? What's happening with Cap and Jan?"
He wondered what Steve was dreaming about: Peggy Carter, probably. He didn't want to believe that it might be Barnes or Wilson, didn't dare think it might be himself.
Tony reached for the car phone and speed dialled '2' ('1' was Pepper and always had been.) "Hi, Jarvis."
He landed within the circle of the helicopter's lights and said, "You wanted to talk to me?
"Nope. Not gonna happen."
"Quiet, you," Tony growled. "It was your own damn fault that you needed him in the first place."
There was light, though, a blinding light coming from what appeared to be a large tent or pavilion, though how you pitched one of those on the deck of a ship, Tony didn't like to guess
The device had been designed that so it would destroy anything up to Cap's shield. It should certainly deal with the wall, and, as a bonus, the light would overload and burn out the sensors of any digital cameras (or old-fashioned film cameras, come to that) that happened to be surveying the room.
"Acknowledged, Iron Man."
It was capitulation, and they both knew it.
"You can tell her," Tony responded, wondering if she had overheard. He was pretty sure Steve, with his enhanced hearing had heard every word, but that didn't really matter: they hadn't said anything that he didn't want Steve to hear. Yet. He certainly didn't want to say anything about Asgardian witches, or his little dip in the Atlantic. "Good luck."
"No. It's to do with something important coming up."
"Oh, and the rest of the so-called 'Avengers'? Are they funded by this 'charity'? Or are they just some kind of tax dodge?"
Jan grinned at her. "Janet Van Dyne, fashion designer, playgirl, biochemist and now, superhero."
"So someone could become king without taking the herb?"
Steve shook his head. "Tony, we can't keep this a secret from them: they already know where we are. Hank can talk to all ants, apparently, not just those in his lab, and understand them. That's how we found you. The ants told Hank about this place, and Bruce is standing by ready to call out the Hulk to smash his way in if you and I don't contact them in—" he looked down at his watch; "— thirteen minutes."
"Yeah, I thought it might get you off my back."
"Despite the name, it has a bad reputation. Agamotto himself wrote that 'The Soul gem is said to devour souls. Something terrible, that legend calls Devondra, lives at the heart of it, and it may be that that is what devours the souls trapped within.'"
Remembering his father's idea for flying cars, he smiled to himself. He could do it... but he was in enough trouble with government agencies as it was. Better leave that one for a more auspicious time.
"Two aircraft, two teams, double the insurance," Natasha said. "If these new beauties can't handle another couple of bodies, they aren't going to be much use to us."
Steve nodded.
Jarvis made no reply.
"Actually," Jan cut in, "I was the one who insisted we try to find them." She shrugged. "Hey, I wanted to test the wings and weaponry. So, my bad."
"Maybe he thought you knew?" Tony whispered. "Maybe I'm... darling, don't you know?" Terrified of the response, he leaned down and kissed Steve, who pulled in those last few inches to lie across his chest.
"Are you telling me he dressed like that?" It was a silly point to hone in on, but Steve wasn't sure he believed the rest of it.
"Nah, Pepper's both M and Moneypenny—" Tony broke off, remembering how many Bond girls had turned out to be traitorous – or dead.
There was an odd, strangely stricken note in his voice as Tony said, completely against his practice. "Um – sure. Nat, could you get me a pen and pad out of the glove box, please. I'll write a personal message for your nephew, Officer...?"
"About a mile behind us at five thousand feet. There is a radar contact, small and metallic."
"Jarvis, directions to the pool, please."
"Oh boy! Well, guess you're gonna find out."
"Okoye is sworn to my service, to train to be my wife, to obey my orders."
Thor thought so too. Tony had spoken to him, and to Selvig, who had told him that there were definite similarities between the device he had built under Loki's instructions – or under instructions emanating from the Tesseract and Loki's staff and he didn't, he told Tony, know which possibility scared him more – and the fragments of the 'quantum bridge' the mercenaries had used in Wakanda.
They all agreed, and got up from their table. Steve being the kind person he is, leaving a tip for the waitress.
In those days, all he wanted to do was to hug the former philanthropist with all of his love and admiration. Granted, he can do that now but back then, during those days. All Steve had to think about was his duties to the world. The constant worry of population, after population in times of peril. Steve shudders a little at the recollection.
"Yes... Why?".
Hope ur doing well and staying safe! ✌️🏻❤️👍
"Well, that's something I might respectfully disagree on." Steve snickered as Tony playfully shoved him.
Nat and Steve would head into the compound; after racing through the massive crowds of confused patrons. Each one bombarding them with even more questions. And instead of easing their pain with answers. They fled.
Steve scrolled. His eyes then found Tony.
But the trek to the Stark farmhouse, was the most anxious Steve has ever been. His palms were sweaty, his breathing hitched every now and then. His mindset was, if you haven’t figured it out yet, all over the place.
Since Germany, the two of them were simply wanting things to get back to normal. Not just by saving the earth every two weeks, it was more so the friends that both Wanda and Vision made.
“Says to the man who still wears silk to an event.”.
"Look, I saw the pictures. The ones that you and... 'them' took. Before you go on, I just wanted to ask... why did you do that?".
'Okay, he's so not fine.' Pepper thought.
"Address? Or just the name of the area?".
Then came the cavalry, with the sound of Sam, and Natasha, awaking and scurrying their feet toward him. But as they reached the opened door, they could see the super-soldier resting quietly.
He extended his hand, at which point, Bruce goes for a hug instead. "Thank You, Bruce.".
"But, if you wanted me to
"Not at all. Consider it my nickname for you!" Tony beamed.
Kamala was in the middle of two-pining idiots wanting to dance with another. "Seriously, go dance with him!"
Steve and Sam, however, we're being bombarded with the agents. Each one getting a few good hits with their energy blasts. The super-soldier suddenly fell to the floor. Too many hits made his body completely break apart. The pain almost unimaginable.
Wanda chuckled before wishing Nat some good luck. She turned the key in the ignition, and sped down the roads back to her apartment.
She took his wallet, and looked toward the driver with eyes of utter pain. "I want you to know, that I spoke to her, that day. I saw her face. That beautiful girl all covered in soot and pebbles, yet still radiating with innocence.” She conceded, “I could've been helping the guys lift the rock. I could've... but I didn't. I was sitting there, with her. Keeping her calm until she drew her last breath. And it has haunted me, but not just me; all of us, ever since.".
But Gene wasn't here now. Tony had already used Extremis and the armour to send a message to Gene's email account when he had identified the Makluan ring. There had been no response and he had not really expected an immediate one. It had been more a heads up for the Mandarin to collect his property. Tony wanted nothing to do with that particular ring.
"Someone should have told all of us – all the Avengers – that. And a lot of other things. SHIELD edited the files they gave me to paint Bruce, Thor and particularly Tony in the worst possible light. I expect the ones Tony and Bruce got were carefully edited as—""
"Even that name is borrowed! I don't remember how it happened but that has to be my fault. There has to be a way to get him back, to make it right."
It was a truce, but plainly, it was not going to last indefinitely.
Tony thought. But it wasn't worth the effort speech would cost. Something else was. "Steve," Tony said, or rather, whispered, because it seemed his voice wasn't working properly. "Tell him... before he... does something stupid."
When he opened his eyes, the HUD was totally dark.
Too late to have doubts now.
"Well, I would like to ask Thor some questions. Like how much the Asgardians know about all this odd tech that's suddenly appeared in the last hundred years or so."
"And you?" Velasco asked.
"It was an interesting experience," Betty said serenely, "though I would rather the deal had included the wings. And I'm still not convinced it's possible."
"Not me. The stones—"
mistake. And I had less excuse. I'd actually met the bastard."
"Well, the Rainbow Bridge – the means of transportation to the other eight of the Nine Worlds – is now restored. As soon as this was accomplished, Thor sought leave to return to Midgard. There is—" Fandral actually twirled the ends of his moustaches "—a young Midgardian lady. Her name is Jane and she is valiant and beautiful."
