John took a drink of tea to wash down the rest of his supper and felt much better. He’d won some sort of battle within himself and proved that he was a different man after all and not the man Sherlock came here to find. He almost felt a little sad for Sherlock to have come all this way for nothing. Almost.
Sherlock ended up walking home. He didn’t plan on doing it, but somehow he ended up there. He couldn’t go back into the hospital, didn’t want to see John, so instead he started down the street in the rain and kept on until he found himself standing at the front door to 221B.
The rushing turned to ringing and John’s head vibrated with the sound. The snow fell, the wind blew it sideways.
Mycroft sighed and leaned over to shut her laptop screen. “Anna, this is no time for games. This only going to end one way: with you understanding that you’ve been lied to your entire life.” Anna felt her heart begin to beat faster, in spite of herself. “I apologize that this is so sudden and unexpected. I’m sure it’s quite a shock. To keep you from the truth, that was a choice Sherlock made when you were very young; and though I did not agree with it, I supported him.” He looked as if he’d become a martyr to do so.
I swallowed. I was woefully out of practice with romanticism, but even I knew that if there was ever a time for complete honesty, it was now. “Actually,” I told him, “I want to kiss you again.”
“Tell me,” Sherlock interrupted, his voice speeding up. “When you told Mary about the raid on Moriarty, did you also tell her about the key?”
When she was a little girl, Mycroft had taught her to play chess. She’d nearly forgotten about it; the games would always end in her being beaten and in tears, and Sherlock had finally outlawed it. Anna was probably eight years old, at the time. “Mycroft, quit bullying her,” he’d said. “Why don’t you play Operation, instead?”
John chuckled again, low and deep in his chest, and I hated him—but also, I laid my head back down onto it to feel the vibrations.
… Sherlock grew uncomfortable, all of a sudden. He stared into his cup before setting it on the kitchen table. “John…”
And then they were off, talking about the Mayfly Man, talking about other crimes and cases they’d solved throughout the years, reminiscing about times long passed. John poured Sherlock a bit of scotch after all, and the two of them soon made a substantial way down the bottle until they’d become awfully pink-cheeked and giggly.
He really would have liked to blame Mycroft for the whole thing. Anna was a child, and Mycroft had exposed her to things that were way beyond her capacity for understanding. But as Mycroft had said, after they’d finally turned off the telly, the crime was supposed to be
. Sherlock’s erection dissipated and he let out a relieved sigh. Maybe if he got up and walked around for a bit before going back to sleep, he’d be able to move on from this bothersome vein of subconscious imagination.
I looked down at him, next to me, smiling at our hands joined in the sink. He caught me watching him, and he rocked up onto the balls of his feet to kiss my lips. It was quick, and chaste, and left my head full of fluff instead of brains. (Thank God, I needed a bit of respite from thinking.)
“That was not the first time you’ve been so drunk. And that is, according to you, a perfectly acceptable expression of grief. But last night you were drunk
Sherlock doubled over, the wind completely knocked out of him. In a flash the wife crossed the room to unlock his shackles from the wall. Still incapacitated from the punch, Sherlock felt Carruthers grab the back of his shirt and drag him over to the bolted-down table, slamming his torso on top, chest-first.
The teacher looked a little taken aback. “Oh, alright. Everyone, this is Mr. Holmes—say ‘Hello, Mr. Holmes.’”
” and other, incomprehensible noises. Mycroft looked a bit awed by it, but nevertheless held him, murmuring “Shhh,” and “There, there.” He tried to pretend he didn’t see the shocked and pity-filled expressions of Lestrade and the police crew standing around them.
“Just put them in the car,” Mary ordered, her mood gone sour. “My darling husband can find a place to store them at the surgery.”
John’s gaze flitted to them, in the middle of the room. “Plan B?” he murmured, looking back out the door again.
More than anything, Anna pitied her mother. As they headed southeast in the car that Sherlock had promised was “parked just out front,” she tried very hard to take her story with a grain of salt—Mary was a
. “What family is that, Harriet?” he asked, smoothly. “Your parents have been long dead, Mary’s as well, and Mary has no siblings or family of any kind. That only leaves—“
Once in the flat, Sherlock relaxed a little. He unbuttoned his coat to take it off and hang it up, and ended up dripping water all over the floor. He groaned, unhappy—it was going to take forever to dry.
Sherlock got inside and John shut the door. He mimicked John and stripped off his boots and his coat. His trousers had buckled suspenders and these he unbuckled and shrugged them off to reveal a thick knitted jumper and jeans. John didn’t think he’d ever seen Sherlock in jeans before and he caught himself staring a little at the sight. Then Sherlock brushed off his hat and John saw his hair
The criminal came and put his mouth right over her ear, so that she felt his hot, damp breath on her face. “Because I
He went back in like a starving man. His hands in my hair, on my shoulders, gripping my shirt once more. I didn’t care this time, about the wrinkles. I clutched at the fabric of his sleeves, trying to anchor myself somehow.
But John knew he couldn’t abandon duty or responsibility, because that was the stuff of which he was made. He wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he left his current life for his old one. He had a wife, a daughter. They needed him.
John had got good at determining when it was going to rain or snow by considering the time of year and the look of the sky and clouds and the level of light and the wind. However there were a few times when he needed to know what would happen later in the day or the next few days. It was mainly in the first year when he wasn’t prepared for the harshness of winter and had run out of supplies and had to walk to the junction shop to get food. He’d started down the road without considering the forecast and had only made it part of the way in the knee-deep snow before the blizzard had set in. The wind blew harder and the snow began to fall sideways, obscuring his visibility, and fortunately he’d had the common sense to turn around. He’d barely been able to see his way back down the road to get home. If he had kept heading toward the shop he would have got lost and probably would have died from exposure. He’d made it back to the cabin and had to wait out the storm which lasted several days, which was when he’d stopped being a vegetarian as he had to eat something to survive. John had fixed up the old radio while he waited for the storm to pass and was able to find a weather report which told him the blizzard would last two more days and then there would be a few days’ break before the next one, enough time to get out to the shop and back with some food to last him until the next break. It had been a very long winter.
John looked down at our hands, and I caught a new expression on his face that I’d never seen before. When he looked back up at me, his eyes were glistening. “Then take all the time you need.”
My heart was beating rapidly. I felt dizzy, all of a sudden. This wasn’t at all what I had expected.
John had tried, had tried really, very hard not to scream. In the military he was taught not to show pain or weakness. Or told, more like.
Sleep wasn’t going to come to him. Sherlock lay on the couch staring at the ceiling, fingers steepled under his chin, wishing he had a nicotine patch… or seven. His mind was in disarray, jumping from thought to unrelated thought, leapfrogging wildly as the clock ticked the passing of time well into the night.
Last night, something had burst loose in his head. The kiss had awoken something in him that he didn’t even know was sleeping—he thought it was dead, or maybe that it had never existed at all. As it turned out, however, it was just lying dormant, waiting for a little spark to send it hurdling back into wakefulness.
He flew into the kitchen table. It screeched on the floor and there was a crash of glass as a few leftover test tubes from my last experiment fell off and shattered. He caught himself of the edge and looked at me, his eyes wide with surprise. I came toward him again and grabbed his coat to stand him up, and before he could react I spun and threw him to the door. He tripped and fell, then scrambled to stand again, looking at me in awe. And I realized, that though he’d hit me plenty of times, in all the years we’d known each other, this was one of the the first times I’d really ever done to him. “Get out,” I hissed, in a voice I hadn’t heard come out of me in a very long while. The last time I remembered it, Moriarty was telling me he was Richard Brook, the storyteller—just a storyteller, it's on DVD. “Get out, before I make you.”
The word stirred Anna to consciousness, her head pounding terribly from the blow Mary’s gun had inflicted. She looked up from the floor to see her mother’s blond hair whipping in the wind, the salty channel spray flying up the sides of the boat with every wave they hit. Mary was searching around frantically for something… and then she tossed the gun aside in anger.
why you figured it out, because he was back by your side. Moriarty severely miscalculated on that one; he knew that you loved John, but he thought it was all about attention, that you’d finally found someone to care about you, when no one had ever done it before. He didn’t see past that, he didn’t see that John provided something more than just a… a lapdog.”
Anna laughed a short laugh, zipping up the bag and swinging it around onto her back. She stared him down with red-rimmed eyes. “Yes,” she said. “I am.” And then she walked past him and out of the flat, leaving him standing alone in her empty room.
“Ohhh, what are you saying to her about me? They’re all lies, Anna,” Mrs. Hudson growled. But her eyes were kind and sparkled, reflecting the Christmas lights strung up on the hearth.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and dialed. It rang… and rang. “No answer,” he said. He tried again. “Still nothing. Molly,
Anna looked from Sherlock, to Mary, and then over to John, who was clearly apprised to what they were talking about. “Jesus, am I the only one who doesn’t know what’s going on?”
The water rose and became warmer, not quite reaching hot. There wasn’t enough hot water in the tank to fill an entire tub so some cold water was mixed in. But that was good. Too hot too quickly would be dangerous. Once the tub was full John sat up stiffly and managed to reach far enough to switch the taps off. He leaned back again as gently as he could and tightened his arms around Sherlock as he felt him begin to shiver again. That was also good. “That’s it,” John said into the warming flesh of Sherlock’s back. “You’re doing so good.” He felt Sherlock’s hand slide up to grasp his arm.
“I apologize,” he said now, suddenly quite aware that he’d brought the whole thing upon himself. John had nothing to do with Sherlock’s mind quantum-leaping to gay sex after a sour, sloppy kiss that occurred between friends, when one of them was absolutely consumed by grief and looking for comfort anywhere he could get it. John just stared at him, puzzled by the sudden change in his attitude. He blinked and ran a hand through his hair, thinking.
“I would say it is extremely likely, Annalise. He knows that you are his daughter—he’s the one who told us in the first place—and he hates Sherlock desperately. He made it his mission long ago to destroy Sherlock’s life... which is why he killed John, of course. It only makes sense that he would come after you.”
. Isn’t that why she was okay with killing all of those museum guards? Moriarty thought it was because she liked to kill, but that wasn’t true. She was just playing a role; playing Moriarty’s daughter. That girl liked to kill, but she didn’t.
He leaned in closer. “I’m going to take this knife,” he murmured, showing it to him, flipping it back and forth, “and I’m going to cut off your miserable, disgusting prick.”
more, but he did not. Instead, he carefully set the glasses in the sink, put the bottle back in the cupboard, and bid John a stoic goodnight before departing to the guest room.
John froze as he realized what he’d done. He supposed it was a familiar gesture because of his daughter, because he kissed
Ella nodded. Then she rounded on John, abruptly. “And now,” she said to him, “I really am going to ask you to leave the room.” John blinked at her, turned back to Sherlock, who gave him no acknowledgement, so he picked up his jacket and waited out in the hall for them to finish.
, over the length of his cock, gripping it firmly. Sherlock sucked in a breath, imagining John’s face, their foreheads touching, breathing heavily onto each other’s chins, John saying something dirty, something like, “You like my hand on your cock?”, growling it, his voice deeper than normal, gruff with lust. Sherlock didn’t respond with words, just lifted his hips into John’s hand, wanting more.
“Why does she have to go?” John asked, his voice higher than before. “What are you going to say that she can’t hear?”
I was breathing loudly and quickly, my chest was heaving. It might have been a panic attack. I couldn’t use the excuse of scurvy, this time. “You’re an idiot,” I wheezed.
, she reasoned. They got out of the car and stretched, surveying the ocean view and inspecting the cabin’s façade. It was their first family vacation; just a weekend getaway, but it was a first, and Anna had been seeing a completely new side to Sherlock. John brought out a sharpness and wit and…
John’s eyes were soft and he looked as if he were about to speak more than once while they waited, but was using all of his self control to hold his tongue. Finally, he couldn’t stop himself: “Can I put my hands down?” he asked.
But the snows had only started and the electricity was working so John could shower every night still. Although his water heater was small and it heated slowly, so Sherlock would not get to bathe until the morning if John showered tonight. He felt a little badly about it because Sherlock had done most of the wood chopping, and that was harder work than John had done wrapping the pipes and caring for the animals. “Would you like to shower?” John asked, making a decision.
The thing was, I hadn’t been in love. Ever. Not even close, not even once. I just didn’t have those feelings for other people. Those warm, fuzzy, head-in-the-clouds feelings that everyone always talks about. I’d never felt “butterflies,” I’d never been nervous around someone because I liked them “like that.” But it occurred to me then that I had felt something close: the giddiness I experienced when John was around. He was the only person I ever looked forward to seeing, and I supposed that was as close to being in love as anything. As close as I was going to get, anyway.
Sherlock immediately moves his mouth up to John’s ear, kisses and licks right below it as he shifts his thumb over and between John’s lips. John swallows it in and tastes it. It tastes like dirty metal, like he supposes the guitar strings would taste. Sherlock lets out a whimper, a small one, but it sounds like John’s name, he breathes it right into John’s ear. John bites down and Sherlock actually
I came, pumping gracelessly into John’s hand, with the suspicion that I might have made an undignified sound or two in the process. It was hard to keep track of.
What would he do after John left? After the flat was sucked dry of all things John, of his sound and smell and flesh; negative space, vacuum space. Nothing alive, anymore. Devoid of warmth and friendship and fighting and awkward tension, sexual or otherwise. Empty.
“No, after.” John leaned forward, pressing his face into my neck. “After Mycroft kidnapped me. I came back to the flat. You’d texted me for an emergency.” His lips were moving on my skin, hot and damp. My eyelids fluttered uncontrollably. “You were lying on the sofa, you wanted my phone to send a text. You remember? To the cabbie.”
When Mycroft had finished, Molly didn’t know whether he was right or wrong. It made her extremely uncomfortable, to on some level
He stood at the sink completely naked, jerking off like a teenager, eyes screwed shut and his hand flying over his penis, the shower finally hot, very hot, the steam thickening the air, making him slightly light headed.
John made a high whimpering sound and I pinned his arms by his sides. I bent to suck on his neck, hard enough to leave bruises. He sighed with pleasure. “Please,” he kept whispering. He tried to lift his hands to my clothes but I pinned them back again, with force. “Oh, please.”
John squirmed uncomfortably under her comment. He was used to people thinking that he and Sherlock were a couple (although, not so much since he’d been married) or that Sherlock was in love with him, but it was doubly awkward to hear it from Sherlock’s parents. He couldn’t exactly use the “It’s not true, I know Sherlock better than you,” defense.
Sherlock had been beaten, so internal bleeding was the first thing he should rule out. John reached out his hand and gently pressed a bruise on Sherlock’s ribcage. Sherlock immediately went stiff, and he let out a hiss. “Scale of one to ten,” John said, quietly. “Tell me how much it hurts.”
In Sherlock’s periphery, he saw Anna glance back at them over her shoulder. “John, you don’t… I mean you’re not… moving
me, then,” John amended, his voice a little colder. They walked in silence for a bit, unhappiness hanging over them like a thin fog. John checked his watch unnecessarily. “I should get back. Mary might need help with… something.” He picked up his pace, heading down the path back toward the hospital.
“Sherlock.” John said it again, and took a step towards him. Sherlock noticed him limping badly on his right leg.
The lock turned and Lestrade’s mouth curved into a half-smirk. “Still got it,” he murmured, as he gently pushed his way through the door.
All this John thought of as he watched Sherlock cross the pond and fall through the ice without a chance for John to shout out any kind of warning. It happened as suddenly as with the dog and John felt a suffocating fear in his heart.
Sherlock stared at her for a long time, and she held his grey-eyed gaze. “I thought you were going to say the kiss.”
The plan was for Mary to secretly give Anna the means to escape and for Anna to do so, but instead of fleeing the building as quickly as possible, she was to make her way to the twelfth floor, disarm the guard outside the elevator, steal his gun, and shove through the office at the end of the hallway where she would shoot (and kill) James Moriarty. Apparently, Mary wanted Moriarty dead just as much as everyone else, but she couldn’t kill him herself—something to do with coups, and a “network”, Anna didn’t really care—and so she devised a scheme for Anna to do it, instead. “It’ll look like you wanted revenge,” Mary had said, after the tears had been shed and apologies had been whispered and Anna had lied and lied like she’d never lied before. “Which,” she’d continued, her eyes sad and a wry smile on her face, “probably won’t be much of a stretch, for you.”
Sherlock pulled away slightly, just so their lips were apart again. John felt a magnetic pull to follow him but Sherlock spoke first. “John,” he said softly. John waited for more but there was none. He would have liked a bit of affirmation or even a denial so that at least he knew where Sherlock stood on their kissing each other. John for his part knew where he stood on it very well, which was almost a surprise to him. He’d thought about it before many times long ago but had always thought it would be different in real life, that there may have been some detail that he hadn’t anticipated in his fantasies that would put him off kissing Sherlock altogether. He was surprised to discover that it wasn’t any different at all from how he’d imagined it in his mind.
It was no use. John believed whatever he wanted to believe, regardless of what I told him—or what anyone at all told him, for that matter. It used to be one of his more endearing qualities, back before he became my sexual partner. “Boyfriend,” was what he asked me to call it, at the beginning, when he vocalized all of the things he wanted me to do so that we could be a “normal” couple. Things like calling each other “boyfriends.” And kissing. And holding hands. “Normal couples hold hands, Sherlock,” he told me, one time when we were watching telly.
Anna felt like whenever she played, she was playing for David. If he liked a certain harmony over a different one, she’d play that one instead. If there was a dispute amongst the members, she would always take his side. And he’d give her this wink that made her legs turn to jelly… and that’s when she began to regret the “one practice a week” she’d made Mycroft agree to.
Mycroft stared at her, uncomprehending. She put her face back into her hands and sobbed the whole way to the training facility.
John came, then, unexpectedly, and violently, with a yelp of surprise. “Sher… Sher… Sher…” he attempted, but was cut short by the shivering waves of his orgasm. He hadn’t meant to come yet, it was just the… the gesture, of seeing Sherlock look at him… “Fuck,” he breathed. “Sherlock…” He pulled out and Sherlock turned around.
She pulled a miniature electric screwdriver out of her pack, keeping an eye on the back office. The admissions lady seemed to be trying all of the extra radios, with no luck. Anna made quick work of the screws and gently pulled off the grate. She looked into the duct, and once again felt thankful that she was small. Without further hesitation, she popped into the vent and set the grate back on the opening behind her—but not before using the chewing gum to add some extra insurance that the grate wouldn’t fall off the wall after she’d left. That had been
I hated him for doing that to me, for altering the way I saw the world. I had been better before, when I hated sex, when I didn’t care, when I was a sociopath, when I could devote every ounce of thought and energy to solving crimes. I was brilliant. I was a genius. Now anyone could beat me at a puzzle, even half-witted tits like Anderson. Anyone could beat me, because my mind wasn’t perfectly focused anymore. It kept going back to John, to the sound of his laugh, to the taste of his skin, to the feeling of him under me.
Thanks for reading, and please offer comment/constructive criticism if you have it! This was, again, sort of an experiment for me, at least in writing style. It’s more freeform than I’m used to doing, and I’m not sure if it was successful or not.
“What I say now I say out of purely selfish interest.” His voice was raw and the anger had gone out completely. He turned around and it was like a different person looking at John, someone John had never even met before, or perhaps just glimpsed, sometimes, in some moments. “I can’t go on without you.”
Another snowstorm had begun and by the time they reached the front door it was coming down thick and the wind was gusting over them. John heard it rattle the windows and whistle through the eaves on the porch as he got open the front door and dragged Sherlock inside. He was pretty sure he commented on it, he was at the stage in his anxiety and near delirium where he was chattering endlessly and almost nonsensically to keep them going. Saying things like, “Here we go, just around the corner, only a little farther, let’s go, wind’s picking up, it’ll be warm inside, come on, we’ll warm up, just a bit more, here we go, up the steps, see we’re almost there, almost there.”
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. “Of course I would have taken you back,” he said. “I would take you back
It was very surreal, to hear John apologize, after years upon years of imagining him doing just that. Sherlock felt as if he was in a movie, that the director would yell “cut!” and John’s face would relax, he’d get out of the car and walk away without a second thought. Like he had, that fateful day, in 221B.
This wasn’t really new for him, this habit of talking to John when he wasn’t actually there. He’d done it even
Molly started to unzip the bag while Sherlock got a clean set of tools. Suddenly, she gasped and hopped backwards. “Sherlock!”
. And we have exactly,” he checked his watch, “one hour and fifty three minutes before Sherlock returns, so we’d best begin.”
might be aroused by it. In fact, until last night, he hadn’t had a sexual dream in probably… well, probably a decade.
Because that was the only reasonable outcome of the situation. Sherlock realized, after pacing for some time, that part of the nerves he had were ones of excitement: this would break John and Mary apart. It could do nothing else—John clearly didn’t love her, had married her under a false pretense of being “over” Sherlock (Sherlock snorted,
In the weeks that followed, I’d managed to find the courage for two encounters—both ended in blowjobs, but still. I knew that waiting for me to want sex wasn’t going to happen overnight (if ever), so I had to give him something in the meantime. John didn’t ask me if I wanted him to reciprocate, and I didn’t tell him if I got off or not. But I deduced, after it was done and I brushed my teeth and went back to whatever I’d been doing before, that he was disappointed. It was incredibly frustrating; I was clearly satisfying his bodily need to have sex, and his emotional need to have a companion in life, but it wasn’t enough. He wanted more from me, and I didn’t know how to give it to him.
Sherlock did not want to speak to anyone. He’d continued to sit on the bumper with his head in his hands for some time, as the fire crew put out the blazing building. As soon as they gave the all-clear, he was going back in there to find John’s body. No one could stop him.
“Because I want to hear your side of the story,” said Ella. “So, tell me, what happened after you rinsed him off?”
“Anna, listen to me,” Sherlock said, pulling back and holding her tear-streaked face between his hands. She blinked away from John and focused on his face. “We’re going to escape, but to do that I need you to trust me, totally and completely.”
John continued rubbing my wrist long after it was clean. “Are you trying to hold my hand?” I asked, eventually.
John looked up into the mist and saw a tall figure in a black coat standing in the road in front of him. He realized then that the sound of the wood being chopped was not the only sound the snow had muted. It was the first snow of the season and he’d forgot how footsteps were nearly silent in the winter. It made hunting for game nearly impossible, which was why John hunted in the fall so that he could keep meat in the house throughout the snowy months. That first year, he’d nearly starved. It was impossible to be a vegetarian in the woods.
,” Sherlock growled, grabbing John’s cock with one hand and poising his mouth over top of it. “Say you want me to suck you.”
was ‘someone?’ Just a random assassin, coincidentally assigned to kill my very own father? No. No, we realized then and there that it wasn’t a coincidence. The British government had found out who I was—who my mother was—and had purposely requested me from the CIA, to put me in the same room as my father and the key, expecting that I knew the secret of the location of the treasure and that I would lead them all right to it.” Mary clenched her jaw, her body shaking with rage. “They didn’t care about us, about our lives, about my mother’s claim to what rightfully belonged to her family. All they cared about was the treasure, and their stupid, stupid pride.” By this time, Mary’s arm had fallen and the gun was at her side. She stared down at the key again, shining brightly in the dull, florescent light. “My father and I tried to escape that night. It was all we could do, knowing that we were being hunted by MI6. But they found us, and they killed him. Right in front of me, they killed him, and took back the key.
. Sherlock had tripped over himself, heading toward the figure, they’d headed toward each other, they’d met, they’d—
At that, Sherlock crumpled forward into his chest. Mycroft supported the unexpected weight, awkwardly putting his arm round the back of his brother’s neck. Sherlock sobbed into his shoulder, sobbed as he hadn’t done since he was a child, with heaving breaths and loud, anguished wails of “
John was watching Sherlock, surprised by the details of the re-telling. He didn’t remember the crying, the hugging, what he’d said. He was awfully drunk that night, so he wasn’t too shocked that he didn’t remember, but still… it was more information than what he’d first had.
Anna started to feel panicked. “Molly, please. You can’t tell him. You can’t. I’ve worked too hard… and if I don’t do this, Moriarty will come after me anyway. You know he will. And he’ll use me to hurt Sherlock again…” She searched Molly’s face.
“Yes, I thought so as well. A bit of a disappointment, actually. I was expecting more gore,” said Molly, sadly.
Sherlock felt his own eyes tear, to his annoyance. “Because,” he said, quietly, “they’d have killed you.”
Perhaps that was his mistake. He should have deleted it, or at least tried to, because the dreams it prompted that night had left him in turmoil.
She bit her lip, her expression gone solemn. “I’m not a lunatic, John. I may have done some things that fell into a… a morally
“John!” Sherlock stood up as soon as the bullets subsided, scrambling around the glass cage, running his hands on it, looking for seams, for some way to open it.
Anna clutched the signal-jammer in her armpit as she used both hands to help herself over the front of the desk. Thank goodness she was small for her age—the poor lady probably thought she was much younger. Anna grabbed a museum map from the counter, though she knew the layout pretty well; she’d been there a thousand times with Mrs. Hudson, who loved that sort of thing.
We were already halfway undressed by the time we made it up to the flat. I felt drunk with the feeling, everything was bright and sharp and real. I was alive, and he was alive, after we’d nearly died, again tonight. “Jesus,” John said, as I slammed the door behind me and shoved him toward the nearest flat surface—which happened to be our kitchen table. I thrust a leg between his thighs to open them, leaning in and rolling our hips together. I grabbed the hair on the back of his head and turned his mouth upward to my own. It tasted like sweat, and like gunsmoke. I didn’t even think to deduce what he’d eaten for dinner. “Jesus God,” John swore again, his breath erratic. I undid his trousers, and then my own, pushing them down, with my pants, so that they scrunched around my knees. John scrambled off the table to do the same. I was so hard, desperately needed some friction, so I moved forward and reached for the back of John’s arse and pulled his hips into mine so that our cocks were slotted next to each other. We stilled there, for a second, both of us breathing heavily. John’s eyes were dark and wide and he gasped, “God, Sherlock. You.”
They broke apart after a few seconds, their foreheads still resting together. Then John began to cry, too. “This is fucked up,” he whispered. “Everything. This is all so fucked up.”
John swallowed, looking around the kitchen. His gaze rested on the countertop, where there were various lengths of human hair taped over the edge, it a row. It was not inspiring. “Erm, I…” He cleared his throat—and lost his nerve. “I was hoping you had some new developments in the search for Moriarty,” he said, letting his breath out in relief. “Anything to report?”
?” whispered one of Anna’s classmates. Sherlock was there for a sort of show and tell—each child’s mother or father was supposed to come into class and get up in front of the other children to talk about what they did for their jobs. Today was Anna’s turn to bring in one of her parents.
John tucked his forefinger under my chin and tugged, silently asking me to stand. I did so, and he kept his hand where it was. He brushed my lips with his thumb, and stared at them before leaning in for another kiss. My heart beat wildly with anticipation.
First, Sherlock refused to sit down and eat dinner with them because he said he was “not hungry this week”—which got him close to a boxed ear from the lady of the house, who hotly told him that they ate dinner as a family, and when Sherlock was in
He didn’t think John knew about that. That he’d gotten sick. It wasn’t the blood that did it, of course. It was the fact that he was utterly unable to do anything; despite that big brain of his, all he could do was just stand there watching Mary die. He’d failed, his vow was broken, utterly
“He’s in the house next door,” Lestrade explained. “He didn’t… he didn’t want the press to know he was here. So we took him out back, around to the neighbor’s.”
“Yes, Mummy.” Anna gave Sherlock a small, knowing smile, showing him how she was holding up her end of the bargain. “Bye,” she called, as Mary grabbed her hand.
Sherlock’s face had grown perfectly still, impassive, the way it always did when he was observing something intently. This time it was John.
lost someone you loved, huh? Tell me, when?” Sherlock didn’t respond, so John continued for him: “Never. The answer is ‘never.’ Because you’ve never cared about someone enough to love them in the
John shook his head, warning him. “Don’t.” John’s provocation was backfiring, and he was not happy about it.
If Anna were to imagine the most unfair thing possible, it would be this exact moment: she’d finally had a father,
Greg Lestrade hiked up his trousers as he stepped out of the car and onto the quiet, suburban street. The lights that towered over the pavement glowed eerily in the early-morning fog, sending a chill down his back. Lestrade cursed every horror movie he’d ever seen where they’d made fog into such an ominous… erm…
Sherlock unlocked the door and John stepped in front of him, then turned around suddenly. “Mrs. Hudson, is she… has anyone told her….”
All eyes shifted back to Sherlock. “That’s because it’s… erm… foreign. We’re solving it for a foreign government, and don’t ask me which one, I’m not at liberty to discuss it,” Sherlock finished dismissively.
“Of course! I’m her father, aren’t I?” John had said. “Don’t you fret, we’re going to have a blast.” He’d shooed Mary out the door, then turned, smiling optimistically, to four-month-old Anna in his arms.
“Ah, but we don’t get more than one life,” said Sherlock, wisely. “And how lucky am I, to have ended up with your daughter. I am truly grateful. She’s given more meaning and purpose to my existence than I had ever dreamed.”
Anna began to shriek. “Let me take her,” Sherlock offered weakly, stepping toward them and holding out his hands.
Of course Mrs. Hudson had been a vital help to him, because he hadn’t known the first thing about babies. He remembered how he’d had to learn to change Anna’s nappies, when and what foods to give her, what size of toy she could play with, how everything at her height level needed to be cleaned and kept clean, how he had to get locks for his windows and gates for the stairs and worst of all he had to throw out all of his experiments—at least for the time being. He remembered how he’d had an absolute fit the first time Anna spit up on his coat, his lovely (expensive) wool coat. “Look at this!” Sherlock had shouted to Mrs. Hudson, shaking it in her face. “It’s a
John received Anna in his arms, and she at once proceeded to projectile vomit all over the front of his jumper. All three just stood there, staring at it. And then Sherlock began to laugh.
“Don’t you dare tell him,” said my mother, giving me cold-eye death stare that I’d inherited from her. I clamped my mouth shut and frowned. It would have been so satisfying to hold something like this over Mycroft. I had already been planning when I was going to reveal it to him. “Promise me,” she warned.
I blinked. I checked the time on the microwave. It was ten in the morning, and John, for all intensive purposes, should have been at the surgery—not at my flat with a soppy smile and breakfast. My plan had been to be gone before he arrived at lunchtime.
“The flash drive.” John choked out, hollowly. “She gave me that bloody flash drive, with her whole life’s story on it, and I threw it in the sodding fire.” He let his head fall forward into the wall with a
“Let me ask you another question, Mr. Holmes,” said Ella. “Why John’s room? For the masturbatory act? Why not go into your own room, lock the door, where he wouldn’t know the difference?”
John’s throat tightened. “Yeah, I think I know what you mean,” he said, remembering how strange it had been when he’d realized Sherlock wasn’t the same person that he’d imagined for the last thirteen years. “I suppose I have to earn it, the title of ‘Dad.’”
All of a sudden, Sherlock began to chuckle. John pondered him, lost, as always, as Sherlock’s laughs intensified. “What the hell is so funny?” he asked, when he couldn’t take it anymore.
“That’s certainly not true,” I said, my body flooding with immense relief. I’d lived to have sex another day. “What about that time I didn’t come to your birthday dinner?”
Sherlock,” John exhaled, shocked at Sherlock’s bluntness and the truth in the deduction. “Do you even realize how
want to die, and as a doctor, he knew the human body’s limits. Sherlock really shouldn’t be as worried as he was. After all, he didn’t like being worried. It made his stomach roil and fogged his normally sharp brain. It made him feel out of control. He shouldn’t worry, John was right, it was just a passing sadness, Sherlock just had to let him deal with it in his own way. Maybe he
“No,” confirmed Mycroft. He looked thoughtful for a moment. “I suppose he said it because he wanted to hurt John just a little more, but it was completely untrue; we did a paternity test after the fact to prove it. Yet when I saw the results of that test, that John was actually Anna’s father, I had a decision to make.
The teacher clapped her hands together and addressed the students. “Everyone, this is Mr. Watson. Children, say ‘Hello—‘“
John removed his hands from his face and saw Anna peering at him out over the blanket. He blinked. “No,” he said, starting to smile. “
John went back to the pan on the burner and cracked four eggs into it and scrambled them up with the onions. Sherlock had finished stacking the wood and came back to the kitchen to remove the two tea bags from the cups. “Compost,” John told him. “Under the sink.” Sherlock found the aluminum pot where John kept scraps of plant matter for his garden. As the pot got full John would dump it into the caged compost pile out back and this he would draw from to mix with his planting soil in the spring.
Sherlock let his hand fall away, the snow blurred by his tears—just debris floating through the air. There had been a lot of debris, after the explosion; the air had looked not much different than this. Sherlock allowed himself to remember one of his old fantasies, one of the first, where he’d stood up on shaky legs, turned toward the ruined building, and through the smoke and the ash had seen a figure stumbling toward him, blackened and broken, but alive.
But sometimes he would rub himself through the fabric of his trousers with one hand and brace his other hand on the doorframe, shoving his face into his own shoulder to muffle any sort of sound he might make as he came. And then, just as in the usual instance, he would tip-toe down the stairs, except this time go for a change of clothes.
thinking about Anna,” Sherlock snapped. “For God’s sake, that’s all I think about. Were you not just in the morgue with me? Did you not just see the threat made deliberately on Anna’s life? If I don’t go after Mary and Moriarty, they’ll kill her,” said Sherlock, shrilly, “like they killed John.”
We kissed again, and my arms pulled him close. As close as I could. I suddenly couldn’t get close enough. “John.”
me; you can’t trust anyone else to be discreet.” He suddenly had an epiphany. “That’s another reason why you’ve asked me to help you, me specifically… you can’t just hire someone random to do it because you can’t trust anyone else; you don’t know who his supporters are, who might tip him off, who might be working for him.”
John didn’t even know where Sherlock had found the picture, didn’t even remember it existed until that very moment. “Where did you find
you, in a way, you know? What to know what it… I mean, Sherlock, I’ve never had a relationship with a man. I’ve never been
“John, you know, it’s quite rude not to say anything when I’m asking such important questions,” Sherlock reprimanded the plaster above his head. “I don’t much like being ignored. Stop being such a tosser and tell me what to do!” He looked around to all of the corners of the ceiling, but nothing happened.
, John,” Sherlock swore quietly. He held his breath against the sour smell emanating from his friend and moved to turn on the faucet. John fell forward without Sherlock to support him, and Sherlock caught him just before his head smacked against the tub’s edge. He righted him again, his arms and face getting soaked by the shower.
“You’ve surprised me, Molly,” he said, walking past her to sit down in John’s chair. He crossed his legs and looked up at her with his usual smirk. “I never would have thought that you’d be the first to figure it out.”
Mary rolled her eyes and looked back at Sherlock. “That’s certainly not true, they’d just only ever met those tarts he dated before
The woman grasped the bottom of her suit jacket and tugged expertly. “I’m aiding the police with Mr. Holmes’ statement,” she told him. “Who are
Sherlock smiled a little, then turned and looked down at his hands. “You know, I loved your father very much. He was the best man I ever knew. And I like to go and visit him, sometimes, because sometimes I… feel sad, without him.” He looked back at Anna, who was silently absorbing his words. “I know it isn’t fair for me to ask you to visit his grave, to pay your respects to a man you don’t remember, even if that man
“Well you’re getting pretty bloody defensive about it.” He sighed and sat up a little, arranging his knees closer together. For some reason this put me at ease. “Honestly, it’s okay if you are. You don’t really get over someone you love, do you? I mean, really over? You always kind of love them.” He shrugged. “It’s human nature.”
John shifted his gaze to Sherlock’s face. The man had most certainly grown older, his forehead a mess of wrinkles under his curls, the skin on his cheekbones not quite as creamy or smooth as it once was. His dark hair was flecked with gray. John found himself wondering how much of Sherlock’s aging had been brought about by raising a child; he could imagine that that sort of thing might age one rapidly. In the six months he’d spent with Anna after she was born, he could most definitely see how that might happen.
. “Shhh,” he whispered once more, slowly beginning to rock back and forth. He rested his cheek against the side of Sherlock’s head. “You’re alright. You’re going to be alright.”
“We should be off,” Mary said suddenly, snapping out of a momentary paralysis. “Come along, Annalise.”
made it down her throat) as Sherlock and John stumbled to clear plates and glasses from the long-forgotten supper. Her eyes began to close against her will. She kept nodding off and snapping them open again.
, Sherlock was such a tit, and a coward to boot, and how immature of him to send John away, and not even just to send him
When Sherlock’s sobs faded, Mycroft led him over to the van and sat him down on the back bumper. He bent down and put his hands on Sherlock’s arms, holding him upright. “Sherlock, I need you to tell me,” he said, his voice stern—all business now. “Did you get the key?” Sherlock’s head bobbed, clearly thinking about other things. “
“Well, throw it out,” Mrs. Hudson ordered. “Whatever experiment you’re doing, throw it out, and take all of your other experiments somewhere else. Because I’m having the exterminator come next week, and that’s final.” She turned and stomped down the stairs.
Sherlock sobbed, pathetically, knowing that he wouldn’t, knowing that it was only fuelling Carruthers’ desire, but unable to control himself. “
At this point, my father entered the kitchen, having been out in his shop, tinkering around with the classic car that he was forever trying to rebuild. (Yes, he was a walking cliché, tell me about it.) He smiled brightly when he saw me, and looked from me to my mother, and I knew he could tell something heavy was on. But he did what he always did: he came over and kissed the top of my head, and then the top of my mother’s head, and went over to the stove, and got out the eggs, and asked how many we’d each like, and went on cooking breakfast like it was the most natural thing in the world. Both my mother and I watched him, and she got teary-eyed again. And as I looked from him to her I knew, suddenly and completely, that there was something inside me that wanted what they had together. I’d always wanted it, my whole life. I’d been trying to avoid it, because it was going to be difficult, and messy, but I couldn’t anymore. I sighed at the ceiling. “Two eggs, please.”
“Two weeks was a bit long, though,” he said, turning back to Sherlock. “Lestrade called and invited us to the party tonight, so we figured it was a good excuse to come back a couple days early.”
John only had to give a few more instructions and Sherlock was pumping away, wanking him like a pro. “God, your fingers,” John moaned, as Sherlock experimented rubbing the underside of his thumb across the head of John’s prick every time he stroked up. He was so mesmerized by John’s reactions to his stimulation that he forgot about his own arousal for a moment—only a moment, though, until John suddenly thrust his own hand under the layered elastic of Sherlock’s pajamas and pants.
Mycroft smirked. “No guns for you, I’m afraid. Not yet, anyway.” He registered her disappointment. “Anna, you need to think about the situation you’ll be in. You’ll be playing the role of Moriarty’s daughter, not his hired assassin. I highly doubt you’ll be given a gun. If anything, you’ll probably have a company of armed guards following you when Moriarty’s not there. Maybe even when he
Memories of last night suddenly flooded back to him. Sherlock putting him in the tub, Sherlock holding him, undressing him, John’s head buried in Sherlock’s neck, the way Sherlock’s shirtsleeves were soaked through and his hair and face were damp from the shower spray… and then, the kiss.
The name edged out of Sherlock’s lips, unconsciously said in exhale. Like an involuntary reflex, like when John used to work in the surgery and tap that silly little hammer in just the right spot on people’s knees and watch the kick that came after.
They stood staring at it, at the name, the dates, “Beloved Husband, Father, Friend.” That last word was Sherlock’s doing, he’d pushed for it because he’d wanted some representation. It was not fair that Mary, deceptive and cruel as she was, got the first mention of “Husband” (or any mention at all, for that matter). Maybe she’d have the first word, but Sherlock would have the last. “It’s not very specific, ’
A few moments later, the three of them saw a tug on the rope. Mary motioned for Sherlock to go and click the winch into gear, and they soon heard a splash as John resurfaced. Anna helped him back into the boat while Sherlock finished bringing the box up the rest of the way. He and John hoisted it over the edge and set it down heavily on the floor next to them.
“You know,” Moriarty was saying, “I thought to myself, ‘Jim, you’re not an unreasonable man. You’re not a selfish man. If you’re going to take away his little girl, you could at least give him something in return.’ So, I propose a trade.”
Mycroft’s eyebrows attempted to reach the ceiling; Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever seen him look so amused. “And why haven’t I heard of this? Surely, if it was so
Ella’s eyes sparkled. “Well, just goes to show that we can deduce anything we want about other people, but when it comes to ourselves, even the best of us are blind.” She smiled. “I certainly had no idea that my lack of jewelry so blatantly exposed my feminism. Here I thought I just hadn’t had time to put it on this morning.”
“Stoppit,” John snapped. “Just fucking stoppit, with the fucking guilt trips and the nagging and the bloody ‘You don’t care!’ nonsense, because you
Sherlock watched him through his cool-colored eyes. “I’m going to give my statement,” he said, abruptly.
Sherlock nodded fiercely. “We knew that the key had an incredible significance, for Mycroft to send us after it. And when we went, it was sitting in the middle of the facility, as Moriarty’s bait, so that he could carry out his plan. You put it in your pocket—“
John pressed backwards and Sherlock let him go. They stared at each other, Sherlock’s expression one of expectancy, John’s one of exhaustion. “What happened,” John started, “was that Lestrade and I couldn’t bear to see a man like that breathe freely one second longer.”
John slowly stepped up to the wall, matching the position of Sherlock’s hands on the other side of the glass with his own. He leaned forward and put his head at Sherlock’s level, pressing it close. “There’s nothing to forgive."
John nearly started crying. It hit him so suddenly, a delayed reaction, he supposed, realizing that this was actually happening, a thing which he thought may never happen. All those years of not being together, all that time of wishing and wanting, it was culminating in this very moment. As Sherlock continued to stare into John’s eyes and slid his hands up to grasp his hips, John reached out and entwined his fingers in Sherlock’s curls again. “I love you,” he whispered, his voice breaking.
I slid my mouth off his cock. “Okay. Okay.” I pulled my fingers out of him, and fumbled around the mattress, looking for the lube. I found it and slicked some on myself.
One thing he learned was that Sherlock was affectionate. John himself had never been too keen on extraneous touching or hugging or kissing but he supposed four years of deprivation coupled with the fact that it was Sherlock doing it made him more accepting of it all. And he still hadn’t got over that Sherlock wanted this. It was such a dichotomy that John was almost amused by it, in fact whenever Sherlock brushed John’s hair back with his fingertips or kissed his shoulder or nuzzled into his neck John couldn’t help but smile. This was more affection than John had ever allowed his girlfriends to show, and even Mary before the truth about her came out, but John was amused and he welcomed it.
.” His eyes flickered to the handcuffs. He smiled again and grabbed a chair from the table, dragging it over and placing it in front of Sherlock, then sat and crossed his legs. The man with the beard leaned against the far wall.
John’s had anal sex before, so he knows how this is done. He’s never had a participant quite this eager, before, though, and he’s surprised at how little work it is to get Sherlock ready. Pretty soon he’s got three fingers in and Sherlock is squirming and making those goddamn sounds, and John can’t wait any longer. He pulls out the fingers and slips on a condom and lines up his cock and asks, “You want me?”
John let out a loud exhale, comically loud, a little “whew.” He giggled, and Sherlock smiled nervously.
“Sher…” John mumbled, lifting his hand to Sherlock’s shoulder. Then he proceeded to vomit again, the sick dribbling down his chin.
“This is right, you and me,” he continued. He pushed himself off the counter and came toward me. “I know you don’t see it now, but you will. So I’ll wait. I’ll wait as long as it takes.”
child, you may hold some sort of emotional advantage over him—and we need every advantage we can get. Third, you have the motivation to go after him: not only is he coming for you, but he’s made Sherlock’s life utter hell ever since he arrived on the scene—and will most likely continue in that vein. And you love Sherlock, I presume?”
A hint of fear crossed Carruthers’ expression. “Look, mate,” he started, lifting his hands up palms-first in a gesture of supplication. “You’ve got the wrong idea. Whatever you think I did, I—“
brain, after all—but none of it seemed promising. Instead I simply sat there, my mouth bubbling like a fish out of water, getting more ashamed by the second.
overly excessive and yes, he should stop. He didn’t need a therapist to tell him that. “So, you think the drinking turned me gay.”
a coward. A no-good, bloody coward who broke your heart and didn’t have the balls to admit I was wrong. I would have rather been miserable for my entire life than accept that I made a mistake. And by the time I’d realized what I’d done, it was too late.”
. John thought about it, supposed he always knew to some degree—even before people “talked,” even before he’d overheard Sherlock’s conversation with Mrs. Hudson, even before Sherlock’s parents had outright told him—
Molly followed him. “Tell Mycroft,” she said. “I’m sure he’s already got an eye on Mary and Moriarty, and this might help him—“
John was standing in the hallway, on the phone with Lestrade, keeping an eye on Sherlock’s sleeping form. “Jesus,” he exhaled. “What happened?”
Sherlock seemed disappointed by the answer, but he nodded. He turned back to his computer and began typing again, silently.
“Sherlock! Wait up,” I heard John call behind me in the corridor. I kept walking, was almost jogging now. I slammed into the door at the end of the hall and flung it open as I exited the building. It smacked loudly on the side of the wall. It hadn’t been the same one we’d entered in, however; it was a side door, I hadn’t known where it would go. I’d just followed the nearest “Exit” signs I could find.
,” he mouthed, nodding in the direction of the crowd. Sherlock drew himself up and went back into the room, breaking up the party, pushing people out the door, clearing the room for his best friend.
The snow compacted under his feet as he made his way through the trees. The path was invisible in the snow but John knew where it was because he recognized the landmarks. He eventually came to a clearing in the wood where the pond was in front of him. He couldn’t see it because it was frozen over top and the snow had fallen on it, so it looked just like a pristine, blanketed meadow. It was very beautiful and John looked at it through the fog of his breath and felt again the calm that nature had brought him over time.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Of course not… five in the morning, honestly. Anna exaggerates constantly, it’s a serious problem. Never believe any of her metrics.” He ran a hand through his hair again, trying to fluff it more. He looked around. “I’d forgotten that Molly doesn’t have a fireplace. Could really use it right now.”
Sherlock was not one to waste time thinking about sex. Sex always led to emotions, and emotions were debilitating to the analytical mind. His methods of deduction only worked because he had trained himself to remain perfectly objective in situations where most other people could not. Becoming friends with John, and caring about him, that had been misstep enough. He’d put himself in mortal danger more than once for John Watson—not exactly the mark of logical, calculated decisions.
be John.” Sherlock and John both looked silly with embarrassment, and Molly laughed. “Well, come and sit, all of you. Let’s enjoy this Christmas morning.”
Sherlock looked out at the ocean and took a deep breath, letting the wind whip over his face and through his hair. “I’m glad you did it,” he said, finally. “I’m grateful, of course I am. Doesn’t mean I’m not angry, still. But you should know that.” He looked back at Lestrade, then held out his hand.
John glared at me, his left hand in a fist at his side and his right brandishing his phone in my face. He was showing me the text message I’d sent him thirty minutes earlier, a lovely up-close image of a particularly nasty batch of rash on my inner ankle with the caption:
, she thought to herself as she raced up the steps of 221B. She dropped her backpack on the ground as soon as she passed through the front door, flopped on the couch with a satisfying “
Despite what Sherlock thought, John was not an idiot. He could put the pieces together in his head, same as anyone else: Sherlock had gone to investigate a kidnapping. He hadn’t answered his phone. Lestrade had found him, nearly a day later, still at the Carruthers’ house. Alive. (Not alive and
If she truly thought about it, Moriarty wasn’t really going to let two of them go “scot-free.” He was a liar, toying with his food before he swallowed it. He just wanted see what he could make them do. “Because I
Sherlock thought the emptiness might kill him, now. Once upon a time he had lived with that emptiness, he’d known how, convinced himself that it wasn’t empty; he just didn’t have a hole where most people did. There was nothing to fill. But now it had been full, that hole he never thought he had, and to empty it again would be catastrophic. It would fall in on itself, nothing to support it. He would go crazy. He would be sad. More than sad; he would be devastated.
Molly had answered the phone with butterflies fluttering around uncontrollably in her stomach. They almost made her feel sick.
He examined the bruises, tight-lipped and silent, Sherlock rattling off numbers on his scale of pain—“three, four,
Sherlock turned and looked down at his side, where a little girl was staring up at him and pointing to the newspaper.
The most bizarre thing about it was seeing John at the hospital the next day. Sherlock had felt shy, of all things, something he hadn’t felt since he was a child. He was keenly aware of everything he said, wondering how it sounded, if John would know, if he would figure it out.
Moriarty seemed to realize what was happening. “Stop!” he yelled. “Let him breathe. He hasn’t got long left, I’m afraid.” He looked genuinely disappointed.
me. I know you did. I saw it when I was standing in that bloody glass cage, about to meet my death—you
“Yes, well, they’re all gone now,” Sherlock told her, pushing her out the door. “And I’ve got company coming later, I’ll need them.”
Sherlock wasn’t so sure why he’d gone off like that. As far as deductions went, it hadn’t been very difficult; he knew John well and, despite what other people thought, he knew quite a lot about the psychology of human nature. So, deducing that John was angry at the universe, and maybe himself—he could have done that in his sleep.
So he’d brought her to play-dates, and group outings, and field trips, he enrolled her in camps and sports. He traveled all over the city to bring her in contact with other children. The trouble was, on those so-called play-dates, Sherlock had to make small talk with the mothers and fathers there—
John’s breath was hot on Sherlock’s face, his lips damp against his ear. Sherlock closed his eyes and let the sensations take him, build up in the pit of his stomach and run wild through the rest of his body. He’d learned a lot about enjoying sex in the last nine months, a lot about control—more specifically, how to lose it. That was a thing he thought he’d never be able to do, after years and years of training himself to do the opposite. But he’d done it with John. For John. Because of John.
“Yeah? And what did you tell him? That I’m having a brilliant time, back at 221B, free as a bird and solving crimes with my best mate?”
John looked at him through heavily-lidded eyes and reached out to grab a fistful of his shirt, pulling him in so that they could kiss again. Sherlock’s hands were suddenly everywhere—first on John’s face, then down to his chest, under his t-shirt, up again, the shirt was off, Sherlock’s hands were smoothing the flesh round John’s back, tucking into his waist, a finger slipping down into—
John let out a burst of laughter through his tears. He glanced over at Anna, who was shaking her head, her own eyes wet.
“Sherlock. Look at me.” He suddenly grasped my face in his hands. “It’s not going to be like this. I promise you.”
“But lying to Moriarty is going to be much more difficult,” Mycroft continued. “And in the event that you are caught in a lie, you need to know how to defend yourself. So, we are going to start with defense training.”
I pulled on him again and tried to stop thinking. He gripped my shoulder and squared his hips. “God,” he gasped, and looked at me. His eyes were dark, his eyelids heavy, and his lips were flushed, his cheeks, his neck. “You.”
in there,” she pointed down the hall, “like you would not believe. It’s absolutely disgusting, and I’ll not have it in my building!”
“It appears as if I wasn’t the only one with that idea,” the Major replied. Sherlock glanced his way and found a small, sad smile on his lips.
“Tell him he’s wrong,” John spun around and stared forcefully at Sherlock, willing him to play along. “Tell him, Sherlock. You don’t love anyone.”
When John and Sherlock walked in the door, a couple boxes of equipment in tow (John had managed to convince Sherlock to consolidate all his experiments so that they could take a cab after all), Mary barred their way with her arms crossed and her feet planted firmly on the ground.
“I know that I haven’t been a good mother—or any sort of mother, really—“ Mary began, but then stopped suddenly as she watched Anna bend down and grab the handles of the iron box. “Anna, what are you—“
Once he’d lowered himself into the water and laid his head back on the towel, he began to digest the recent turn of events.
John froze. “I didn’t even… my God.” His face grew hard. “That bastard, he kicked me out on Christmas!” He barked an angry laugh, shaking his head to himself. Molly thought she heard him mutter something along the lines of “
Meanwhile Sherlock was splashing and the ice around him was breaking as he tried to climb out, and John heard him gasping his breaths as he tried to get enough air in the cold.
John looked at him. He wanted to roll his eyes and say, “I don’t have any friends here, you twat, I never worked in sodding Dover and it’s been thirteen years since I worked anywhere, anyway. And all the EMTs here hate me because I pulled a gun on them to let me in the ambulance with you.” But he didn’t say that. The look on Sherlock’s face puzzled him—it was clear he just wanted John to leave. “Okay,” he said instead. He attempted a smile again, but felt he didn’t quite make it. “I’ll check on you in a bit, then.”
“This is you,” he said, at one point, when he stopped looking at our cocks and looked at my face, instead. “Sherlock. It’s you.” I stared back at him, my body trembling with lust and adrenaline and God only knew what else. John reached a hand around the back of my neck and clasped it, like a lifeline. “It’s you and me,” he whispered.
“Yeah, okay.” Lestrade turned back to say goodbye, when his face suddenly clouded. “Sherlock, before I go, there is something…”
After dressing he made a fire and put the kettle on for tea. The snow had stopped again but it had accumulated a lot during the night and he could see out the kitchen window that there were larger drifts now which had formed outside his front steps. He poured the hot water over his teabag to steep and then got down the old radio from the top shelf. John didn’t care much for listening to the radio, certainly not for any music or news, and there were only a few stations that came in at all out where he lived. The reason he had the radio was for when he wanted to know the weather report.
made a terrible mistake.” In the distraction of what had happened between her and Sherlock, she’d forgotten to tell Mycroft about the threat they’d discovered in the morgue.
“As you can imagine, my father was not keen on helping the British government after they’d abandoned him in Agra. And he’d fallen in love with my mother, and she with him, so they made a plan. He would return to England as a double agent, obtain the key, and when he did, they would meet and she would lead him to the treasure. He put her on a plane to America and promised to be with her soon. And he never saw her again.”
“Well, that certainly wasn’t the impression I got when you first walked in the door.” Sherlock licked him again. “Have you changed your mind?” He put his lips over the head and sucked lightly. “Hmmm?” he asked again, taking John deeper into his mouth and using the vibrations from his voice as extra stimulation. “Which way is it, John?” he asked, letting John’s cock fall out and onto his abdomen. “Do you want me to stop, or keep sucking you off?”
For nearly thirty years Mycroft had helped MI6 searched for the Agra treasure, to no avail. But once Mary popped back up on the radar, he came up with a brilliant plan: to release the key into the world for her to find. The trouble was he couldn’t convince the imbeciles at the government to go along with it. “She’s the only one left who knows where the treasure is hidden,” he’d said, over and over. “We give her the key, we follow her to it. What could be simpler?”
Sherlock dropped the piece of cloth as he felt the world start to dissolve, and he sank, weakly, to his knees. “All right,” said Lestrade, from out of nowhere. It hadn’t occurred to Sherlock that the rest of the police crew had been watching him. “That’s enough.”
It didn’t take long to spot John—Sherlock would’ve recognized the back of his head anywhere. His hair was completely silver, though still thick and full (at least, it looked that way from behind). His shoulders looked a little more stooped than Sherlock remembered….
But now, she had to actually interact with people her age, and not just in politeness—they were a band, so they had to play music, which involved
quite a few people at the funeral. Sherlock showed up late, on purpose, so that he could sneak in and sit in the last row; but he ended up having to stand, as all the pews were full. He slinked along the back wall and leaned against a pillar, taking in the scene.
. He knew that I’d be like this, once he left. He knew no one else would compare, that I’d spend the rest of my life alone.
Sherlock’s grey eyes were full of vigor, contrasting mightily with his deathly pale complexion. He smiled again, weakly, as the three of them watched Anna throw handful after handful of the great Agra treasure into the sea behind.
Sherlock stared at her. “I think… I believe he was just lonely. Grief. He just lost his wife, and was looking for some comfort, and I was there…” he shrugged. “It wasn’t a big deal.”
The band had been his idea—she loved music and played the fiddle (all those lessons Sherlock forced on her would finally pay off), so it would be a much easier transition into a lie than “Science Club.”
“Well, she was an orphan before,” Sherlock snapped, not liking the change in John’s attitude. “So ‘child of divorce’ will be an improvement. Besides, we only had sex, we weren't
Lestrade stared, surprised and confused, and then his face broke into a grin. He laughed heartily. “Don’t worry about it, Sherlock.” His laughter quieted, and then his eyes became very sad. “Come to think of it, it’s me who should be apologizing.”
John shook his head after her retreating figure. “You know, you could have just asked her to leave.”
“Say you’ll never leave me again.” His hand moved off my hip and down to his cock. I could see the muscles tensing in his arm as he brought himself off.
“Basically he told me what I already knew before: that if I really wanted to be in your life, I’d have to get comfortable with waiting. That patience was key. I would need to be present, and to be patient, and that you’d come around in your own time. So that’s what I’m going to do.” John looked at me. “But you should know that it’s not by choice anymore, to wait around like this. Not after you left like you did. I’m doing it because it’s the only thing I can do. Because I need you, you’re absolutely right, I’ll take anything I can get. It’s pathetic, and it’s fucking scary, Sherlock. I’ll really do anything.”
Sherlock just “hmmm’d” in reply, fingers flying over his screen. “Aha!” He tapped, and plugged his phone into the speakers.
Mary’s face began to tremble. “I wish I could have given it up for them,” she said, again. She was quiet for a moment more, her eyes swimming. “Tell them I love them?”
“Because,” John finally spit out, clearly frustrated at my lack of comprehension. “I thought—well. All that about being
. Unfortunately, the yelping is not drowning it out, but I am long past the point of caring. In fact, this is probably going to become a Pavlovian trigger. Whenever that damn lady starts singing, I’m going to pop one thinking about John’s expert fellatio.
No. John was determined not to think about it. That’s what Sherlock wanted, to get into his head and drive him mad until he breached the subject himself. But what Sherlock didn’t know was that John didn’t actually care, not really. That the reason he’d left London was still the reason he’d stayed away and that reason wasn’t going to change. If Sherlock wanted to waste his time waiting to provoke John into a fit then he could do it. He could just do it.
on Anna’s door. “Anna? May I come in?” Sherlock opened the door and found Anna sitting on the bed, her face wet with tears. “I apologize for raising my voice,” he began, walking over and sitting on the edge of the mattress. “Do you forgive me?”
what Mary wanted me to do. She planted the body there, to frighten me, wanted me to go after them—more specifically, after Moriarty. And Mycroft must have wanted the same. He wasn’t using Anna as a weapon, he wasn’t training her to be a spy, he was manipulating her into danger, so that I would have to save her—and destroy Moriarty in the process.”
It was strange, seeing John in this setting. Whenever he’d seen him over the last two months it was always at 221B, and John always greeted him with a kiss. But they couldn’t kiss here. “Good afternoon to you, too,” Sherlock drawled, upset. John gave him a warning look.
“I—I know,” said John, a little bewildered. “That’s what I’ve been saying. I’ll fit in wherever you want me to.”
All of John’s muscles were still aching dully, and he closed his eyes, thinking that might help him relax against the pain. No, no, that seemed to make it worse. He opened them again and studied the seams between the bricks overhead. “The bomb,” he repeated, thickly. “Did… is Sherlock…”
“Through no fault of mine,” interjected Sherlock’s mum. “I was against it from the beginning.” She pursed her lips.
Sherlock looked over from his chair at the wall of ovens in their kitchen, blazing hot, John leaning easily back against the countertop and staring at him. “Can you check?” John asked again, a slyness in his voice. “These damned things are so
Sherlock scowled at him as he eased himself onto the couch and lifted his leg up on the coffee table. He arranged a bag of frozen broccoli over his knee and sat back with a sigh. “Maybe you’re right,” he muttered. “Maybe I should just retire. Then we can
“I can’t,” she sobbed, her outstretched arm beginning to shake. “I won’t.” She didn’t want to kill either of them. She didn’t want to kill anyone, anymore. She knew Sherlock would hate her if she killed John, but if she let Sherlock die, she would hate herself. There was no winning, here.
“Sherlock Holmes!” reprimanded his mother, dropping her napkin onto the table with one hand. “How dare you. A cemetery is no place for a baby, especially on Christmas! It’s supposed to be a day of joy and happiness,” she spat, “not depressing dreadfulness.”
“What about that ridiculous woman who hid the letter under the rug?” John chuckled into his drink. “I can’t remember, how did you solve that one?”
When they came back into the house, Mary was making dinner and there was a barely-older-than-baby girl sitting in the middle of the living room, surrounded by colorful toys.
“Oh yeah? How am I supposed to react? My best friend just told me he’s in love with me, but, oh, by the way, ‘not the sex part’—what does that even
Sherlock turned to his brother, noticing that his expression was not unlike one of concern. In response to it, he gave him the coldest glare he’d ever given anyone. “What would
John sat up and pulled me to him. “Yeah, I went, but I thought about you the whole time.” He stroked his hands over my bum. I pretended not to be interested.
As he’d had quite enough of Mrs. Hudson by that point, Sherlock employed Molly to come to the store with him and help him pick out something “economical.” She’d gone happily, choosing a bright-red, hooded zip-up jacket that looked like a cross between a tarp and a picnic blanket. He zipped it, staring at himself in the mirror, his upper lip curled into a disgusted snarl. He was completely put-out by the purchase; that was, until a few days later when he was holding Anna in the park and she puked on his arm. He wiped it off in two seconds, with zero damage to the hideous garment, and was so excited that he cheered “Hurrah!” with one fist in the air right in the middle of the park. He then went through a phase where he wore the coat constantly, like it was a hazmat suit and Anna an infected specimen. That disgust of another human’s bodily fluids quickly left him, however, after being spit up on, pooped on, drooled on, and sneezed on so many times he didn’t think he could count them even if he sat down in his mind palace and tried.
“Oh, I don’t think you should blame fatherhood for that,” she told him. “I think it has more to do with you losing John.” Sherlock looked at her, and Mary thought she might have seen a smile. “You said that he keeps you right,” she elaborated. “At our wedding, that’s what you said. He’s your
“Later that night, I lay next to your father in bed and cried. Because I’d done that to him. I’d drilled into his head, in the six short years he’d been on this Earth, that he needed to focus on his career, his purpose in life, and not let sentiment get in the way the same way I had. But in doing so, I’d made him into a machine. He wasn’t human any more.
Her voice isn’t half bad. A little flat on some notes, and her vibrato could use some work. There is a piano playing, too, or a keyboard probably, because it’s not percussive enough for a piano. “I can’t focus,” I say, grumpily.
Bullets pelted down from above, and Sherlock’s shout of “Down! Climb down!” pulled them both back to reality. Anna whipped around and hurried down the stairs, all the way to the bottom, John and Sherlock half a step behind her.
