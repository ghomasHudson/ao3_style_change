“So good news, Simmons has admitted she has a problem, and Laura will help design a treatment game plan. We might have to import a drug counselor from the good timeline. Someone that won’t freak out when we explained her fiancé accidentally time traveled and created a new timeline along with marrying someone else.” Tony sighed as he sat down in the chair across from the bed.
Red phone: Yes, it was six days, but I was only intending for it to be three and then we had to deal with some mad scientist wanna be that tried to restart Hydra again or at least take over the brand. Why would anybody want to take over a name associated with World War II atrocities?
Blue phone: That was the impression I got that from her message. I assume that last message earlier was from her?
It is now time to spend some time with the more functional couple in the story. Not that it would be hard to be more functional than Tony and Steve because I don’t think they actually acknowledge that they’re dating yet. If they have, they've obviously haven't told the other one yet.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation, you are all absolutely wonderful. So I did see infinity were already and it may influence some elements but I am sticking to my original ending. However there’s probably going to be more chapters than I originally planned. I’m sure none of you are that upset about that.
Then you took Steve too and I hate you for that. I know I never really had him, but now I can’t even pretend that he’s my friend anymore. Everything is a fucking mess. I just want to crawl into a bottle again and I can’t. I just need to get through these next couple of days. I’m not sure I will.
Me: Again, my feelings for you have led to a lot of questionable decisions. Apparently, those feelings have been around for a really long time.
Steve: Kamala and Robin love that show. Robin told me lots of grilled cheese, and tomato soup is usually involved at your house for lunch. Which incidentally is what I’m making.
A final note, I wrote this chapter months ago, back in January. However, there is a section of this chapter that is very “harsher in hindsight” after Endgame. I chose not to change it.
Counselor Laura: She also feels fixing the universe is more important. This is what happens when you’re ex shield.
Cuddle Bunny: Don’t call her that. Could they have taken your phone away from you in an effort to trace my location?
“I am not…” Happy started to argue, but he knew better than to argue with Black Widow, especially with the glare she was giving him. It felt like she was 30 seconds from dropping him on the floor again.
Red phone: Of course not. The DOD actually respects your autonomy enough not to propose something like that and they like my gadgets, even if I won’t do weapons. However, Congress is Congress.
Me: Not really because she’s SHIELD again but we need somebody at the San Francisco FBI field office to keep an eye on your really little friend’s parole and Woo is too by the book.
Blue phone: Maybe you shouldn’t worry. My experience with the Shield psychologist wasn’t that bad. Her name was Dr. Suarez and she was nice. She gave me a sketchpad and pastels and told me to do whatever I wanted for the hour. I did a lot of sketches of the old neighborhood from memory.
Anthony love: I would say something about the fact that I haven’t heard from you in 14 hours, but I’m very happy that you finally wrote back. Are you okay? Where were you?
“Let me just read you what I have. And you can tell me where I’m going wrong,” Steve said reaching for the nano paper.
Counselor Laura: BTW the Fitz that came from this timeline we call Leo so we can tell them apart, which is why I'm calling you Tony Potts.
Love: Even though he shouldn’t, Coulson took my call. I may be angry at the bastard, but Coulson is Lily and Corey’s godfather. He is protecting us. It’s obvious that they’re not looking that hard for the wayward Avengers.
“Yes. We were engaged actually.” For a moment she let herself smile at that. “However, the team was dealing with trying to prevent the end of the world. That has to take precedence over me.”
Of course, you’re on a mission. That totally explains why you were the first one to respond, even though I wrote in the middle of the night your time.
Red phone: I'm even looking at CEO candidates because I'm not sure how much longer Pepper’s going to want to stay at SI.
MayMQ: Sometimes I think Audrey was your rebound. I think you would’ve told her the truth when you rescued her from Daniels, if she wasn’t. Did you actually talk to Clint this time without giving way to violence?
I should probably talk to the princess to see if we can develop a better classic-like shield for Steve. I do agree with her that dad's original design was a waste of a precious resource. There are more economical and technologically advanced ways to get the same result with fewer raw materials. Yes, he has the digital version, but I think he misses the classic. He can’t throw the digital shield.
Blue phone: Sometimes I think you just go for the easiest solution without looking for the better yet harder solution.
However, AOS season six came out, and I came to the conclusion that things make more sense if I view the TV shows as existing in a separate timeline that runs adjacent but divided at a previous point and therefore the blip doesn't happen.  I.e., in the Coulson lives universe, unlike Fury, Phil contacts Captain Marvel as soon as he was warned about the confederacy and she gets there in time to actually save the day.
Me: I’m glad about that. It’s probably for the best Birdbrain wasn’t there. Although I wish Sam was better at keeping you from doing things that will get you shot again. Were you just hoping the bullet holes healed up before South Africa. We are going to see each other in eight days.
Chief mechanic: He knows better than to argue with May and is looking forward to quality beach time. I might be able to ship Flash off to the West Coast to work with Pepper, but he’s not leaving Ninja spider. I definitely know I can’t send him away. If they’re staying, MJ is staying because they’re all so stubborn. And I’m not even going to try with Afia.
Cuddle Bunny: You said you are doing training exercises. Did you meet your prospective new Avengers?
StarkAE: Great. My AI has a crush on a taken shield agent and Spidey still being heroic, even though he’s grounded. I bet he didn’t call for backup either.
Warning: This chapter does contain references to material first discussed in WandaVision. It’s twisted around for the new timeline, but it is there.
“No, I tried to text message my Nana. I thought that by using my phone, I could create a bridge between the two timelines. It didn't work.”
Tony: Because when the alien invasion /possibly world ending apocalypse happens, they want you on their side.
Me: Okay, I’m more concerned with Senator Hateful and General Hale. There’s still rumors about Hale possibly succeeding Ross, if you-know-who wins the election. I think she hates you, so that’s something I’m hoping to avoid. Monkey Lover really dislikes her for some reason. He thinks she is secretly evil and is trying to prove it.
“Or I accepted that I did get back to her. Just two years earlier. Therefore, the best way to protect her is to save the world. It is just unfortunate that she already has her own Fitz. That’s okay, I kind of like him,” Leo smirked at her.
Me: Germany was definitely a mistake. I really shouldn’t have got a 15-year-old involved in my complicated interpersonal problems. But when you’re in love with someone, you make choices that are not always the best or most logical. Love is rarely logical.
Anthony: At least you figured that out before you died, which is more than I can say for a lot of people on my list right now.
I'm really sorry that I worried you. We're taking precautions to make sure that I am no longer susceptible to the sunflower technique. Even I don't want to go because of an allergic reaction. It would just be downright tragic and ridiculously embarrassing.
She was thankful to see Tony at her stove cooking what looks to be an omelet. She’s happy to see him in the kitchen. She was worried she would have to interrupt his Steve time. The picture earlier was enough for her.
Tony: Shit and you’re still a free man? If Talbot is reading this, I’m definitely glad I didn’t try to have text message sex with you.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You're all fabulous. I have a great time. Awesome con 2017. I even got into the Stan Lee panel. That was fun.
Me: That was going to get very confusing really quickly especially because both of them have the most potent death glares I have ever seen. I didn’t think anybody could top Pepper and yet the Mays can.
Let’s talk about my friends that love me. The counselor loves me platonically, of course, otherwise I think he would have turned himself into the Armed Forces even though he says I’m the worst patient he’s ever had to deal with. He pities my actual therapist. But he keeps me safe right now and listens to me talk way too much about you.
The new consultant: Let's get back to why your dad is meeting with the president. I'm sure it's not all about the general situation.
“Not until you’re ready. However, my friend, Dr. Leopold has created a prosthesis that looks almost like a human hand. Maybe something different than what you had before would make you feel more comfortable,” she suggested as she pulled up a picture of Agent Coulson’s prosthetic.
Number one May: Since I now know some of what's going on, I'm going with Miles and the Khans to the Malta house for a while. The Barton children may join us if Tony can work it out with their dad. I’m happy I took the job at the Stark foundation now so I can disappear for a month without having to clear it with the boss.
The Big Boss: That's all I ask. I’m also not surprised. There's going to be a meeting around 12 PM your time.
Cuddle Bunny: You do come off as being abrasive at first, but once people get to know you, it is easy to see what a good person you really are deep down inside.
Jemma was horribly happy when her boyfriend stepped out of the portal. Leo’s plan actually worked. Her boyfriend and the other two were back.
Anthony: Also, I feel like we would have to deal with less super villains that way. They would totally want to crash.
Genius Princess: We would really like that information as well. We can start getting the stones while we figure out how to get you back. We are trying on our end.
"Or to go completely wrong. Everybody could completely see through the façade." Tony told his boyfriend worriedly.
Anthony: Yes, although it’s mostly to protect their assets from Ross and from whoever the new director will be. That search is not going well. Plus there was an incident recently that requires immediate action.
Tony: I’m trying to be a better person and be respectful of your feelings. But I totally expect you at the wedding. Let us hope the aliens don’t invade.
Red phone: Probably. Anyway, now that I'm back, I thought we could talk and maybe start with easy questions.
Cuddle fiancé: I’m not even entirely sure myself. Although they promised to protect the Earth from Thanos in exchange for the Gravitonium and all the Inhumans.
Me: Well I can’t ask you the actual question since you actually do have the mind and body of a 30-year-old and yet you were only born less than a year after my father.
Me: I guess it's going to have to be because three months ago, I thought you would punch me on sight instead.
Me: This is so embarrassing. I am really glad you are Captain Prude. Although you could’ve told me we are providing a 16-year-old with a really skewed romantic education. Did she at least fix the encryption?
Me: Yes, I’m always this infuriating. Bobbi says it’s my gift. Which explains why we are never ever getting back together. Seriously, why did my other self think about marrying her again? I’m glad they got interrupted by ninjas. He really dodged a bullet there.
Anthony love: I realize now I probably should have led with that. I have other agents going there to deal with that. This may be the other reason why Agent America is concerned. Simultaneous kidnappings are never a good sign.
Nomad: I'll try because it really would be awful for humanity in general, if you two went to the dark side.
Purple Princess: Which has a history of being dirty or despising my father. Why did you decide to give me the ability to have a headache?
“Actually Leo was dropped off in his bed and he waited a few months before even contacting me so I’ve only been not relaying the situation to you since July,” Fitz replied.
Lily bear 2018: I'm friends with baby bird. She tells me things, or rather, she texts me pictures. She drew a picture of you and Dad hugging at the compound. I thought it meant the two of you would get back together, not that you would end up in another timeline. I should've warned you. I’m sorry.
Monkey lover 2: I will add it to the list of things that R&D needs to work on along with the very long-range communication device that Robin suggested. Although, the board wants more things like ICERs and fewer things like Stark phones that last for two years with one charge and prosthesis that function almost like the real thing.
Me: I have no trouble telling Ross or the UN to fuck off if they tell me to do something I find illegal or immoral.
“I don’t count Fitz. I would get him to come to SI, if I could. The Quinjet is coming, that means that the Stark industries jet will only be a little behind. I hate that you have to leave,” Tony lamented, now more awake than before. The kiss probably helped.
Ana Jr.: He is on a mission, and I am not allowed to tell you where your father is currently en route to.
Steve: She left, or maybe he left her. I don't remember everything. I was so young. Being a single mother was hard, so she told everybody that he died. If you hear a lie enough, you believe it.
“I watched Peter die in my arms. That was the second time something like that has happened to me and it didn’t make it any less awful.”
Me: I’m okay. The kids are happy. We’re still talking things out. He had an encounter with our least favorite asshole that’s making him a little shaky but it’s okay.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I've been here for more than a week. I need to ask Friday exactly how long. I lost consciousness a couple of times. Finding out your kids were snapped out of existence will do that to a person.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Yep, at least according to Friday 2023. It's a full dystopic hellscape here because Ross consolidated power. In this timeline, Ross never kidnapped me, so Clint never took him out politically. He was kicked out once elections were able to happen again, but the damage was already done. Inhumans made an easy scapegoat for what happened.
The Mechanic: Yes. We can’t have him asking too many questions, especially when Mommy Monkey Lover starts putting up pictures of her son and his wife and her other son and his husband. Actually, I think we need to move her to another country away from nosy people that only remember her having one kid.
“You didn’t try to leave, did you? We've only been working on this for a couple of hours, and we already have a working theory. I bet super genius Princes could've got you back home in a week tops." Although Deke is personally sure, he's going to be stuck here.
"Which is for your own safety because if you knew, Thanos would stop at nothing to get that information from you." The Princess answered solemnly.
The new consultant: Which is a good idea because I was about a week from locking you two in a room together to work things out.
Nomad: So, are you ready to talk to me again? It’s been four days. I’m not mad that you called out my name while having sex with someone else, I don’t think I have a right to be. Although that does explain why Ms. Potts started giving me really strange looks.
This is a ridiculously long A/N, so bear with me: Because I was asked previously I’m going to take a moment to provide a little bit of background for those who are not watching Agents of Shield, which will be helpful for this chapter and a few more later on. (Available on Netflix in the US. Go watch, it’s tons of fun. It’s already been renewed for seasons six and seven.) The following explanation contains spoilers for the first five seasons of Agents of Shield related to the complicated relationship of FitzSimmons and how it relates to this story.
“I’m not letting him go. And if you haven’t figured it out yet, I am more stubborn than a mule,” Steve said pointedly.
I am decrypting a lot of Hydra files. I probably should have done this after Shield fell apart, but I was too busy chasing scepters and making murder bots. I’m starting to realize what sick fuckers those Hydra bastards really were. Maybe that’s another step in dealing with this. Why do I feel that working through my parents’ murder is going to have more steps than AA?
“Possibly processing all the data related to our attempt at turning Pym Tech into a Time Machine. It didn’t work because instead of ending up in our past, we ended up in a different timeline. Although it is 2018, so we are in the past. I think that’s what Nana was going for since I did find Bobo. You’re not necessarily my Bobo, but maybe her Bobo. The multi-verse is confusing. Maybe I should have talked to other Stark instead of just peeking at his private server for his time travel notes.” The voice Tony heard was not Karen, but some unknown guy standing next to Leo and Hunter.
Wow, a somewhat quick response. Under 24 hours. You’re getting better. I’ll be happy to come for Thanksgiving. I think I would prefer to avoid my extended family for at least another holiday post breakup. Although, I’m going to have to show up for Christmas, which definitely means no Malta. Maybe I’ll be ready to deal with the boyfriend by Easter.
Cuddle bunny: Exactly. They could be manipulating you. Lord knows you already have enough things to be guilty about. You don’t need anything else.
Red phone: Apparently, I really need one after having a tiny breakdown on her couch. Crying was involved
“Although, I am sure the traumatic brain injury didn’t help the situation,” Jemma said, trying to remember various things she read in various medical textbooks about schizophrenia.
Once again, we are going through the 36 questions that lead to love from the New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html
Anthony: It’s okay. I’m used to dealing with assholes. I’m just sad that our virtual date is not going the way I hoped it would. We can’t even figure out a movie.
“Is that because Stefan is not really you? Or maybe it’s because Stefan doesn’t have the same expectations as you do as Captain America."
After reading the text messages, Laura was 100% sure who was writing, but decided that she should write the person back. Therefore, she started to type.
Me: If you want to keep these conversations going to just build up a good professional rapport to prevent the next apocalypse, then you need to tell Anthony that. If you just want to cultivate a friendship, then you need to be honest about that too.
Red Malibu: I think we may still be able to pull this off. Talbot agreed mostly because he really likes Mrs. Purple Arrow and doesn’t like the bad guys using little kids as collateral, but he did sign off on the arrangement. So there’s little Ross can do once the press conference happens, no signing required, I promise.
Happy Bear: I shouldn’t be trying to push you to get back with Virginia especially when you’re dating someone else. I just wanted her with someone better than that asshole. I punched him by the way.
Me: Yes. It’s the Tony Stark clause. I actually had to take a few whistles out of the suit and droids to come into compliance. They’re not allowed to think too much on their own. Obviously, Friday is the queen of loophole abuse. I programmed my baby well.
“Despite the warning, if me reading the Darkhold was the only way to get you back, I would’ve done it with no reservations. Even knowing that it can completely corrupt a person, I would’ve done it.” Fitz responded by kissing her again.
“I figured you would want to, although for safety reasons you will be using a nano paper notebook and there will be a dead drop or several involved. Friday will explain. She’s best friends forever with the Royal genius.”
Anthony: But then he prevented a mass shooting from having more than three fatalities by melting the assailant’s gun on vacation. Now people like conservative WHiH commentator and ani-enhance person activist Jonathan Windom West wants to lock Joey up and the watchdogs tried to burn down his house. The fact that Joey is Hispanic and a member of the LGTB community just makes them even more rabid in their hatred. Again, a terrorist group tried to burn down his house, with him still in it.
“What the hell happened in the other timeline?” Flash asked as he turned his attention to MJ. She was not okay at all.
“It was a possibility I considered. Sometimes you need a little help. Or potentially a lot of help."
Me: And yes, I’m aware that I have a tendency to avoid things and do have the history of not using the best coping mechanisms. Okay and also I’ve ran a few solo missions that have turned out badly, but I know better now.
Then later on it was Happy, my James, and eventually Pepper Pot. After the break up, things between me and her were awkward but we’re starting to talk to each other about things other than work chaos which is good. Most of her questions are about Lily and Benji but we’re talking. Also, I’m not telling her she should get another boyfriend even though I do think it, because seriously, he still thinks that Pepper was just my beard. What type of person doesn’t get bisexuals? I just don’t get it. She needs better but I guess some people need a rebound relationship.
“I think in that case, they probably knew but didn’t want to know and therefore didn’t talk about it because they were afraid.”
Red spider: Hey, I have to go. Apparently, I need to be part of the Rose garden press conference. I do not like Jeffrey. At least he’s not in charge of Shield here.
Captain Tight Pants: It's more tangible evidence that the world went on without me. Some of the Howling Commandos have great grandkids my biological age. Jackie has a five-year-old granddaughter.
Genius Princess: Because he still doesn’t trust his bosses. Especially the one that made him go to the Rose Garden to make the American people think nothing was wrong. I assume that you are with the team trying to recover the shards of Thor’s hammer?
Counselor Laura: He’s been making a fuss on the various talk shows and podcasts. He’s a regular of JJ Jameson, but he’s mostly neutered at this point. We have more significant problems.
Melinda: Friday also promptly confirmed her suspicions that you and Tony never started speaking to each other again after Siberia.
TMNS: It helps that you're not a dick anymore, and it was MJ or rather the book she got me. She’s been buying me a lot of books about that stuff lately. It’s been helping me figure things out a little.
“Which definitely means no friends with benefits.” Because that was essentially his marriage and its ending because they were in love with other people.
Director Snookums: And I understand why you have all those walls. I was there at MIT when the older kids used to use you for money or homework help and that was before Afghanistan. You deserved better.
Tony: I will probably do the same thing for Christmas in Malta. Unless I bring a bunch of shield agents with me. It depends on where we are with the Accords by then.
When I sat down to write this chapter, several weeks ago, the last wedding I went to was sometime during the late 90s. Strangely enough I did end up going to a wedding during the polishing process for this chapter. There was a lot of glitter, rose petals, broken glasses, and party favors. That being said, I had to do a lot of research on this chapter. So good news, my computer now thinks I’m getting married. The things I do for a good chapter. Additionally, SPNxBookworm reviewed this chapter to make sure I was somewhat accurate. Thank you for doing that. This is in addition to the regular proofreading done by Evespring.
Tony: OK so I’m kind of having a crisis of conscience and since you are Mr. Paragon of Virtue I need your help so I can avoid another fuck up such as killer robots or Siberia.
Tony Potts: I considered it, but didn’t. I didn’t think you would want to see me after I caused your or rather her husband to go on the run.
“You were unconscious, and we were trying to figure out why when we started looking through it. That is how we figured out you were from another timeline.” Steve told her which was the reason why she deleted her original message and told Stark not to block their access just yet.
Me: Okay, I wasn’t. But you would look so hot on a recruitment poster. Actually, you always look hot on a recruitment poster. You’re well aware that’s how I figured out I was into men.
Anthony: Also, they usually don’t let you pack a bag nor do they bring presents. They definitely don't talk to your assistant about clearing your schedule in advance.
“Steve and I have conversed. We hugged in the parking lot. I gave him the Shield. We're good now.” Laura responded with an exasperated sigh.
Red phone: Also, Ana taught me how to paint when I was young. Well, it had to be when I was young because she died when I was nine. Regardless, I like to dabble in watercolors every once in a while.
. Although, be warned, she only checks her non-work email like twice a day and I’m not allowed to give that one out.
“Friday princess, can you please get daddy a copy of the initial Shield report and the FBI report?" Tony asked the travel version of Friday on his phone. He really wanted to know what the hell was going on and Agent Agent was being extra cryptic.
“Maybe that is the case for complete strangers. That doesn’t apply to us.” Steve smiled softly. “Although I kind of regret we didn’t meet at some sort of Shield mixer where we could’ve played team bonding games. Instead of getting mind fucked by Loki and Agent Agent having to die for our sins.”
Me: A little bit, but Monkey Lover will be doing the heavy lifting. I might be doing some of the programming. My own programming. Also, princess Friday is lobbying for her own body.
Anthony: Because they need somebody there to eviscerate me. And he’s probably upset that SI stocks are up five points since the announcement. Not everything they're saying is a lie. I am unstable.
Me: Because I think Rice is more qualified. Most of my diplomatic experience involves getting you out of jail in various countries.
Avenger Ana: According to the archives, Thor was unwilling to talk about what happened with his sister. He lost an eye. Although he was given a prosthesis. However, Valkarie and Dr. Banner did provide a report of what happened that I have access to.
Girl Friday: Okay, I’ve checked your lab, and you’re not there, which is good. You’re also not anywhere else. Not good. I guess it’s time to ask my little sister for help.
Tony: I am currently having lunch with the shareholders/investors money people, not the actually take care of the money people. That’s why I want to bring out the butter knives. Surprisingly, the accountants are less boring. Also less fake smiling and conversing with people that make your skin crawl. This should totally be a Pepper thing.
Me: Apparently somebody needs to keep her occupied when big brother is forced to spend quality time at UN meetings and at various diplomatic receptions. Apparently, I’m the best person to do this. Although I’m kind of sad I’m not going to be at his meeting with outgoing Secretary Ross. That would require popcorn
I’m sorry I wasn’t there with you when you woke up. My current nomadic lifestyle means that I’m always moving from one project to the next. I’ve been doing a lot of good. I’ve freed a lot of hostages. My therapist thinks that’s about you and so does my boyfriend. She may be right. I think she’s right about a lot of things. However, I’m not telling my boyfriend that he’s right. It will just go to his head.
Can you talk to Tony about him going public with the new boyfriend? Him being who he is, maybe it wouldn’t be a good thing. His stock prices go down if he stubs his toe. Although, again, it probably would be better than the other stories currently circulating. Maybe Ross will stop targeting Clint's wife and children if he has someone else to target. I already sent Tony a bunch of gifts under the Carter persona.
The new consultant: Third, after my mom. I don't think they knew that they were related, which is kind of sad.
Me: I have a reason. Several actually. I'm not running away. I am taking care of my problems directly. Unlike some people who are waiting for their rich boyfriend's lawyers to sort things out.
Tony: In this administration, who knows. It happened so often, I’m surprised the guy is running for re-election. But actually, it’s the secretary from the last administration that’s getting raked over the coals. The one who is definitely not Hydra. Check Twitter.
“But our kids need us. I don’t know if we will give them what they need if we are not together. We may not even have to worry about that because if this works, Kamala will get to go back to her parents.” Tony realized that Steve was equally worried about losing his child. Yet Steve was the first one who wanted to try because he wanted to do what was needed for the world.
M is State Department shorthand for the Under Secretary for Management. Let’s just say that the person who took this job after the Ross Administration was not happy at all with the skeletons they encountered.
Red phone: Casual hookups are also no longer an option because you could accidentally end up sleeping with a stalker, gold digger, and/or super villain. There’s a reason why Tony Stark sex tapes exists.
“Like your young friend Robin, I see multiple pathways. Your arrival changed things. We have more options to prevent what’s to come, more time. Although none of those options involve destroying the stones.”
Thank you to everybody who have read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. The end is near. Only 3 chapters left in this story after this one.
Venom: Maybe. Benji has been reading the books that you have been giving him, and he considers himself demisexual when it comes to guys, so maybe there's progress.
Me: Who is actually going to take care of the Jarvis and Maria Stark Foundations when you’re at Shield?
Since the snap happened, Steve found driving peaceful. Less traffic, for one thing. Of course, this drive wasn’t peaceful because he was lost in his own thoughts. Although wondering if Tony was freaking out about his Instagram confession was better than contemplating his impending divorce and the implosion of his family. What would the custody arrangement even look like? Polly asked Melinda to take Robin. If they divorce, would she just leave with Robin, and he would never see his daughter again? Would the Khans just take Kamala away as soon as they returned? Would he lose both of his daughters? The thought made him sick.
“Thank you. I would’ve made a cup myself, but apparently, the machine down here has been replaced with a minibar.” He was not happy to find that earlier.
“Do you want to finish the rest of the questions?” Tony asked after several minutes of silence. He’s already on the freeway.
Tony: Yes. Also as sexy as I think that shield is, I realized that the design is kind of a waste of very rare materials that you can do so much with. The communication beads are awesome. Also the use of the nanotech fiber is brilliant. I’ve been dealing with tech envy for most of the day.
Venom: I really should change my first name. I feel like that name was their first act of cruelty against me.
Blue phone: I’ll be more careful in the future and use the new gear. How are you going to get me the gear? I can’t exactly go back to your island.
Tony: Ross has pretty much been a dick to him for the last few days while he was running interference. I so owe him another gift basket.
Warning: There are references to Ragnarok, Captain Marvel, Infinity War, and Endgame in here. It’s all connected.
Friday: @WHiHOfficial_JWest @SI_CEO_VPotts was a goddess among CEOs long before she was screwing Stark and will be so long afterwards.
Tosha: Friday says you’re still in the building. Possibly in the air ducks. You can’t keep ignoring everybody. I know you been doing it for the last five years, but I’m not letting you do it anymore.
“For number three, we are horrible at communicating with each other.” Because if they actually could talk to one another, Tony wouldn't be as desperate to use a checklist created by a newspaper psychologist.
Captain Tight Pants: I'm not mad that she moved on. I'm glad that she found somebody. From Jackie's stories, Peggy’s husband was a good man. Evidently, I met him once. According to Jackie, I saved his life.
Avenger Ana: Yes, although I am not allowed to answer your questions regarding if your wife and children survived the decimation.
: Alias created for Steve Rogers. This is who the press currently believes Tony is dating. 78% of the press anyway. The remaining 22% believes that this is a lie and Tony is actually dating Chris Evans. No one has publicly claimed that Stefan Carter is Steve Rogers, at least not outside of Freaking Cool.
Red phone: Aunt Peggy knows all. And therefore would not be shocked by the fact I think Kevin has a nice ass.
Agent M: I remember having to fill out the paperwork from Budapest because Linda went into labor early. 90% of which I had to falsify to cover up what really happened. The statute of limitations has not run out yet. You owe me.
Pepper pot: You retired because of your health issues and because you didn’t want to see Steve married to someone else.
“Your excellent tongue cannot fix everything.” Tony said pulling away. “Baby cakes, I’m allowed to be a little freaked out because unlike last time, I’ve actually been diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD. Also I’ve managed to piss off the Secretary of State and a few other officials and various governments"
Tony: I definitely would have liked a sober Howard. The alcohol took my dad away. Now that I’m not drinking or rather struggling with trying to stay sober, it’s more obvious how much I’ve lost because he was so deep in the bottle.
Pepper pot: I miss him too. I could definitely use him right now, balancing work and the kids. Especially because you're taking my nanny away.
“Get over it. This is his life and you should be well aware now that Tony Stark does what he wants and what he wants is Steve.” Natasha said to Happy as soon as she dragged him into his room.
Tony: Two Shield agents are dead, which could’ve been avoided if he listen to Agent America. Also Spidey was put in danger and I’m really afraid of his aunt.
2. You care about people. Not just people you know personally, but also people you have never met. You are always sacrificing yourself, or at the very least your happiness for the sake of others. You genuinely care about the people working at SI, not just the executives but down to the cleaning crew. You also care about the other people with powers and not just your teammates, but people like Ms. Marvel and Spidey Junior.
I’m going to behave and not put anything from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier for at least a month. However, I have thoughts. I will say, Tony managed to fix things a lot more than he thought he did. Apparently, he fixed more things than I thought he did. More to come as we go forward
Anthony: Actually Queens and his aunt, but don’t worry, we're going out because I didn’t think it was possible for someone to be worse at cooking than me. And yet I have met her. Although we could get some KFC and then yes, the Colonel would actually be there.
HSBF: Lily won’t be eight for another couple of months, so you have at least 10 years of this because there’s no way Clint is going alone.
Anthony: 2. You were too panicky about May for me to wait until the end of the wedding. How many times did you call Yo-Yo and Simmons with my phone last night?
Red Malibu: With a shady uncle and a father brought into Shield during the last days, most likely so his father could be flipped to the dark side. I feel like I have to be in the system to at least protect them, otherwise it will be people like S and Talbot calling the shots. When Talbot is the lesser of all evils, you know you’re screwed.
Me: At least two, Tony. Merry Christmas. We will have lunch in the New Year to celebrate your engagement. Now, I need to sleep.
Cuddle bunny: According to my sources, a warhead was stolen from a US government facility. A Dr. Lincoln Campbell died during the operation to recover the warhead that was modified with a gas that caused those exposed to mutate and gain enhanced strength, while losing their cognitive functions and autonomy.
Me: We got close, minus the sexual content, then Happy screwed up and Ben had a building collapse on him.  Still not happy.
Nomad: I'm not allowed to watch the TV reports after I broke a television. Clint says he's sedated though.
Friday: @WHiHOfficial_JWest or maybe you’re just bitter that @Iron_Man is an out and proud bisexual and you’re a self-loathing closet case
Tony: I knew that I felt like I was dealing with two different people and I was right. Leo came from the darkest timeline, which is why he needs quality time with Suarez and to consider new job prospects. Trying to save the world is too stressful.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. You definitely keep me in the writing zone.
Anthony: But is it? It definitely seems like he is overcompensating for something. You did say it was the worst sex you ever had. There had to be a reason for that. Unless that reason is total lack of skill. I have neither of those problems.
“Teenagers are not the brightest of people. However, despite that, you should probably give Peter his suit back. He would be less likely to hurt himself with it on." Steve argued.
"Look Steven and I spent the last few months trying to rebuild our relationship piece by piece. Instead of becoming teammates again, we're something more. And I know Steve comes with a dump truck full of Bucky baggage that we are going to have to unpack and we're working on it. Now I have to work on rebuilding things with all the other Avengers and unfortunately, kissing is totally off the table. Which is a shame because I'm good at that. People don't hate me once we're making out." He joked.
Tony: I have about a week. Although, I don’t know if my new android child will make me being the head of the ATCU a nonstarter. I’m probably going to have to tell the POTUS the truth or some version of it.
Agent M: Despite all indications otherwise, she doesn't want Red Malibu dead and had some Intel about what happened that required in person contact.
Nomad: You really need to stop sending messages like that when you’re 6000 miles away and we can’t do anything about it. (message not sent)
Chief Mechanic: I still want more details about how he ended up Chief Creative Officer at SI. I think Pepper 2023 might be in Mrs. Robinson mode again after reading between the lines. Although I am quite sure this guy won’t fuck around with an overrated YA actress.
Me: Very sorted. James Rhodes is in charge of Shield and therefore Ross has no right to enforce any provision of the Accords. Even the Raft is now under control of the DOJ like it should’ve been in the first place. Ross and his agency are now only in charge of negotiating amendments and additional provisions of the accords. Since that part is done by people who actually know what they’re doing and not Ross himself because he doesn’t like getting his hands dirty, I think we’re good.
Anthony: I met Marvelous, not marvel this, but Ms. Marvel would be a cool superhero codename for when Kamala is not 11. I’m going to need to work on the voice rec software for this new operating system.
The boss: Deke is not exactly lost. He made contact with us from 2018, the better version. He's safe, and they're working on a plan to get him back to us.
Number one May is May Parker Riley. Incidentally, Melinda May is not May number two in Peter's address book but just Agent May. Really he has no imagination. Obviously, P Parker is Peter. This is his personal cell phone, after all, not the Avenger line. Also, because this isn't the Avenger line, the names of the under 18 are not being redacted. Although if a mention of their superpowers pops up, that would be edited. Tony and the princes are trying not to be Big Brother. Sometimes they overstepped their boundaries anyway.
I hope that your husband will come around once he has time to process things. Although, I kind of want to punch him for wanting Spidey Jr. to be fixed. There’s nothing wrong with him. He just has some extra abilities. The camouflage is awesome by the way.
Tony: So, I assume Friday didn't forward you Laura’s text messages live when she was chatting with the good timeline? How kind of her.
We are back in the “Tony and Steve had their ship together” timeline. I know you want to see if Tony Stark-Potts gets back to Laura, lost in 2023, but I did promise you a Daisy check-in. Remember that due to me misreading MJ’s last name originally, I came up with the brilliant idea to make her Daisy’s cousin and I kept running with it.
Anthony: Which was very platonic. After Sharon’s father screwed her over, she pretty much swore us all off as a species. Are you disappointed to find out that it’s more than just a pissing contest between possible suitors?
“I don’t like it either. But hey at least it keeps Peter nice and safe and away from the vultures and Ross. The paparazzi vultures, not the guy who tried to steal my toys.”
Tony: I’m confirming because I am not afraid of your imaginary, 16-year-old, voyeur, super genius. Vision said he’ll be back if aliens fall from the sky again or whatever. It is what it is. So that pretty much means the only person with superpowers living at the avenger compound full-time right now is the Bulletproof Pacifist. And not really because he will be spending weekends in Queens once Yo-Yo goes out west.
Tosha: Where are you? Seriously you’re missing chocolate chip cookies. Some of them have mini Reesie cups in them too.
“Then I’m going to count that as diplomatic experience. I personally want to punch out most of the board.”
Tony: It's more like we're swapping places. I am bringing Steve with me. We could take the kids to Queens. that way, you can have a night to yourself. I feel like you need half a glass of wine and some of the good chocolate.
But Romanoff is there, staring into his soul, trying to read into him. It’s something that she’s been doing for almost the last week. Sam is doing it too. And really, Tony, is just glad they decide to do this in the hotel room instead of downstairs at the café. Being who he is, the paparazzi would be there in a second. He knows they smell the blood in the water, thanks to the Pepper breakup.
Tony: I am just finding out about this now? I would’ve figured out some way to sneak you into my meetings, otherwise. That way we could have tested out the integrity of my desk here. I have an office. Or me and Pepper, share one. Between the two of us we are here enough to warrant an office.
Red Malibu: I changed my mind when I opted to remodel to un-Virginia my living space instead of leaving entirely, because your wife said I couldn’t hide with head between my legs in upstate New York forever. It was just a bonus that the kids wouldn’t be uprooted again. Although we are moving all the dangerous stuff to the compound because kids just don’t listen.
Counselor Laura from 2023: It's hard sometimes to understand who you're married to, but it's essential to figure it out.
Hunter: And the only one you ever had. Even though I’m sure, Pepper felt like your nanny half the time when she was your assistant.
Tony: Okay, I have my non-alcoholic mimosa and an obscene amount of blueberry pancakes because Lily Bear just had to have blueberry pancakes this morning, so I’m all ready for us to dig into the questions.
Director Snookums: No, you don't. It's just you have all these walls up and it's hard to get past them. But once you do, there’s this great person there just waiting.
With the next Thor movie opening in the U.S. Friday (and already out in 52% of the international markets), some of you are wondering if things from that movie will get incorporated into the story? The answer to that is I will not know until I actually watch the movie,but I’m currently leaning towards no since the movie takes place on another planet. I won’t make that decision for sure until I actually watch the movie and with my schedule being what it is that’s not going to happen until Veterans Day.
“I think I get at least five more years of doing stuff like this.” She’s forgiven him for accusing her of cheating on him when she showed up pregnant with Morgan. But she deserves some vengeance, especially after watching Tony moon over Steve like a teenager for the last five years. Okay, it was more like 11 years, but she hasn’t had enough coffee yet to acknowledge that.
"This means like two dozen phone calls, starting with Jane the PR goddess, the deputy head of security because Happy is kind of sort of suspended right now, and Pepper.” The Pepper conversation was going to be brutal. “Is it late there or early in Malibu right now?" He asked turning to Steve.
Venom: You’re welcome. However, BITC just had to ask if Daisy had any cool Thor stories. And MJ started crying.
Counselor Laura from 2023: You don’t need to worry about me. I’m OK here. Just concentrate on making sure that what happened here doesn’t happen there.
Me: Dammit, I was planning something at a Dodger game, as soon as you could legally be in the country again.
"You know what, both. I’m not sure how long May Parker-Riley is going to believe that Peter just happened to see something at his date’s house and tipped off the authorities. That’s like only slightly more believable than that ridiculous cover story that Coulson came up with to cover up the fact that Obadiah tried to kill me and I took him out instead. I’m just glad that the board never found out about that during the Shield data dump post implosion."
Agent Johnson: We found Loki. Agent James is down, and there's somebody there named Deke that claims to know me, but I have no idea who he is.
Cuddle bunny: If I told you when I first found out that Hydra had your parents murdered, would you have reacted the way that you did? I don’t think you would have. I think you would’ve had more time to process things.
TMNS: He took detention versus telling one of the teachers what he was doing in the computer lab last night. It probably didn’t help somebody was playing your sex tape on the computer right before Ned took over. It was in the browser history.
Me: Sort of, anyway. Okay, you got the leaders of the Avengers on speaking terms, which is what matters.
Me: Who didn’t tell us shit until she needed the boss to show up in my barn. I don’t have a very favorable opinion of Hill right now.
Red phone: I would, but I can't because I think Vision deleted our conversation or maybe my security protocol did it.
I think I would be up for a visit next month. They don’t celebrate Christmas here, but I’d rather not be completely alone. The Princess visits often, but she’s been in America a lot recently. I’m getting to know one of my neighbors, Polly. She’s from America too, but I think she’d rather spend Christmas just with her daughter. It’s the first one since her husband died.
May: The other May and Phil are not married. They’re possibly engaged. Nobody could get clear intel.
Chief Monkey Lover: Then, at worst, he’s my great-nephew. I am with Hunter. He’s also older than me.
Anthony: Probably. I would understand if you don’t want to risk coming, but I really want to see you. It’s been a very stressful couple of days.
Steve: You’re the closest thing she has to a mom with both her parents and siblings also gone. You need each other.
Yes, I believe Dr. Leopold is from a future, if not necessarily my future, and therefore for the sake of my people, I must heed his warning and prepare us for the worst possible consequences. I will not have the blood of my people on my hands.
Me: Which will help with our open and honest communication. And I understand why you didn’t tell me the truth. But I kind of knew. The international community may have been caught off guard but I wasn’t.
Anthony: Because Friday earned herself off of probation by doing that. Also, despite how well I have covered up our electronic dating, it is impossible not to leave a small electronic breadcrumb trail. A few things were left behind, such as it being on public record that you are allowed to make healthcare decisions for me in the event of my incapacitation.
“And I will when the time is right. You don’t have to be Stefan Carter out there tonight. Just go out there as Tony Stark’s boyfriend who loves him very much. The name doesn’t change that." Melinda suggested.
“You’re not supposed to be here. You’re still disavowed,” Leo sounded worried but that didn’t stop him from handing Hunter the backpack, which Simmons was not happy about.
“You've never been just the dumb muscle. Now can you please get out of the air vent, or I will have Friday use the gas on you.” Natasha threatened him.
“We should have listened to Hunter,” Fitz told him as they waited in the white holding room together. They were both lying together on the giant bed. Leo is glad that he designed this room for comfort. It was much nicer than when he was locked up by the general. Although, they should’ve put two beds in here. Of course, he never thought they would be hosting two people in the room together (he’s not going to think about the last time he was stuck in this room with somebody else). Apparently, Dr. Suarez felt it was okay to put them in together. (His other self wouldn’t try to rape him like AIDA did). Which would be fine if Fitz were not a cover hog.  Although, he’s sure that his younger self probably thinks the same thing about him.
“As well as being sober.” OK, so he is going to get into this a little. “It’s why I tried so hard for Morgan to get clean. It took a few attempts, but I got there.” Now he is going to help Simmons get there, hopefully. He feels like he owes that to the universe.
“So do I. You will write me when you get to DC?” Steve asked with another gentle peck to Tony’s lips.
D FitzSimmons: I vented. I'm not going to punch Bobo out. I just think he's a bit of a dick. Nana has been working tirelessly to get him back, and he's just been running around fucking Hunter and living his best life as the head of SI.
“Because Tony was trying to kill someone and Steve was trying to keep him from doing that. If you talk to Tony about what happened, he would tell you that. Have you even bothered to ask or did you do what you did today and just say bad things about his boyfriend?” Romanoff asked.
Agent 13: It's possible. Even if they don't know you're his boyfriend, you are listed as his health care agent in case he becomes incapacitated.
Anthony: Stupid bad guy screw up number one, never assume that the guy that you're selling illegal weapons to will not blow you up just to get out of paying. It always goes badly. But it makes our job easier when the bad guys just kill each other.
Me: Everything is together. I’ll bring Agent and your ex-girlfriend along with other May and the nephew. Maybe Monkey Lover. I don’t know yet. It depends on if there’s an apocalypse or an alien invasion. Possibly an apocalypse triggered by an alien invasion.
Red spider: If I weren’t currently going through the briefing material, I would ask about the future doppelgänger thing.
Blue phone: Honestly, when I fancy someone gender is the last thing I consider. I'm not a breast man or a butt man. I never noticed things like that at all.
“It feels like it.” Steve says as he rested his head on Tony shoulder. He also intertwines their fingers together.
Anthony: They’re showing a shot of her pushing a reporter that’s following her nephew a little too closely.
The counselor referred to it as a team rebuilding exercise. As you are aware, we have to do a lot of rebuilding, mostly because of my stupidity. Don’t tell your boss, but I think the band might be back together again or at least together enough that we can fight if the aliens start to attack. Again. Baby steps.
Me: Because he was supposed to have died in the battle of New York. Although, I’m pretty sure his ex in Portland knows better.
Nomad: I thought we were trying to be honest with each other. That’s the whole point of these conversations.
Boss: I’m not lying. Agent Melinda May formally Garner did work in HR at Shield before helicarriers ended up in the Potomac.
“10 months. We are immensely proud.” MJ said as she squeezed Flash’s hand again. Peter is just going to ignore the fact that his cheeks are getting red again with the additional contact. You think the spider bite would give him the power to keep that from happening.
Nomad: I mean, not that I think someone posting pictures of you going to therapy is good because it’s not. I hate that people don’t respect your privacy like they should. I am glad that things are not going as badly as you feared.
HSBF: Which explains why you take the suit to board meetings sometimes. I told you I would do this with you and I keep my word. I also took a nap so I could deal with being up at 2 AM.
Chief mechanic: That’s fine. It would be spring break, and I would actually like to get them out of New York. I would send the high school kids to Malta with the little kids, but I’m already having trouble with our middle school kids. Ms. Marvel thinks that she can be useful and shouldn’t be shipped off. I’ve also heard Connor doesn’t want to leave. Lily bear, bless her heart, is reasonable and baby Nat is too little to know what the fuck is going on. I envy that child sometimes.
But Puerto Rico is going a lot better this time around. SI received various contracts to get the power back on using arc reactor technology and had most of the power back on last month. Even in the remote parts.
Me: Possibly. Look, I’m not letting that asshole win. We were good together and we can be good together again. We just have to figure out a way to get unbroken.
Red phone: Because the symbol of America that the DOD paid for is MIA after refusing to go along with the Accords. That makes them look bad and they hate that. They want answers and I’m not sure Congress is going to be pacified with a phone that can go a year and a half without being charged.
Me: Not at all. So we keep going on. Okay for this next question, let’s think back to when we first met during the battle of New York and tell each other the first thing we admired about the other person.
Me: Maybe two or three months afterward. I also prefer midday in a park. Maybe even in Central Park?
Is it appropriate to ask you how your mental health staycation went? I think it’s okay since I’m on a lot of medication and will have to schedule a really long session with my therapist as soon as I get back. I have so much to process. I may have used the wedding in India to float the idea of maybe getting married at some point. I didn’t bring out the ring, but I did mention I want us to have a nighttime wedding because you just know that villains will attack if we do it during the daytime. Also, the paparazzi will just be all over it, especially if I’m able to come clean about who Stefan actually is.
“I hate to interrupt this conversation, but six androids and General Hale are trying to kidnap Agent Coulson.”
D Fitzsimmons:  What happened to Friday? I like her, she's my friend. She makes sure I understand all the pop-culture references that I missed growing up in a world controlled by the Blues. I love the 80s so much. They had the best music. Also, The Breakfast Club is the best movie ever.
Me:  We definitely shouldn’t do this. But the only thing Jane is going to accept is me letting her publicize Benjamin’s good deeds and that’s not an option, so were doing this. Although not necessarily tonight. We should probably break this all up in small chunks.
The new consultant: Be easy on Benji. I think part of him wanted to tell you the truth, but he was afraid.
“I prefer not to Karen. I hate watching him leave because I’m afraid one day he won’t come back.” He thought about May Parker. About her losing her husband just days before Thanksgiving. He doesn’t want to think about that.
“I completely agree,” MJ said from beside him, almost sounding like she was near tears. “It was bad enough reading about my cousin being dusted in Wakanda.” He felt her shiver. It was apparent she wasn’t okay. None of them were.
Blue phone: Although, that explains some of the weird messages from last time where you told Friday not to send certain text messages.
May: I never told you about the stuff I did at the Academy? I was a legend at Shield Academy. Not that people could prove what I did. Although I regret not doing worse to Garrett.
I don’t know if there’s something going on between Peter and Ned. Although, Laura has received some interesting text messages regarding the beauty of Liz Allen. Apparently, she’s a Goddess among seniors. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything and I’m living proof of that.
Blue phone: Has Tony locked himself in his lab? Is he that afraid to tell me that he is sexually attracted to me? I don’t hate the idea. It’s just maybe we need to work on being friends first. He was right earlier. We are kind of broken and we need to fix that before anything else.
Tony: Not you. Such a pity. I’m still mad I had a business breakfast this morning. I wanted to eat berries and whip cream off your stomach.
There is a slight illusion to Captain Marvel in here towards the end of the chapter but I wrote it before I saw the movie and touched it up a little afterwards. It’s vague and not very spoiler heavy. All events in that movie are canon for this story. That’s all I’m saying for now.
Me: It is an option of last resort. Although, I would like to see you again. OK I would like for you to come with me to see James. He agreed for me to visit him and I don’t want to go alone. The rest of the team can’t come with me.
Tony: Apparently, somebody is not that reformed and science is more important than good decision-making. Which I get but I still do not want to be in this position. Again.
“Raising the girls. Skinny asthmatic me never thought he would be a father. I had an asthma attack the first time I had a handjob.” Tony was glad he got under the covers because little Tony was excited and a little horrified. “The fact I preferred that over the blind dates that Bucky always set me up with also had me doubtful.”
“Not the real reason because his mother and grandmother were there. Jim’s wife wants to know why I’m marrying you.”
Football Hunter: She does. The arsehole doesn’t. I hope he gets a heart attack when I show up on your arm tomorrow at a very Stark industries Christmas reception. You know those images will be everywhere.
“That makes sense. Tony is like that. Let’s just go find him and get it over with. I want to know what ever he’s afraid to tell me.”
Anthony: It was a program that Shield created to make life like android copies of agents to send out as cannon fodder. Allegedly, they never perfected it, but you never know. Your old boss was a professional liar.
Anthony: Why do you respond to my text messages in the middle of the night? For a world traveler, I never quite got time differences.
Tony: Unfortunately, Aida is not Friday. I created Friday completely from the ground up. As I learned with Ultron, never trust anyone else’s code.
Tony: I do. I’ll write you in a couple days after I talk to my James and straighten all of this crazy stuff out.
HSBF: Are we still on for our second half of our date? Friday scheduled me for 4 PM your time. She said the kids would be busy with first day of school activities.
Me: Are you upset that life went on without you or that you weren't here to participate in their lives and your lamenting those lost shared experiences?
Chief Mechanic: Although I heard my platypus is Vice President. I’m so proud. I hope he's mitigating the damage.
Cuddle bunny: Clint thought it was too easy. It was arranged? So, if things went south, we would be able to respond in the aftermath?
Acronym guide: ATCU stands for Advanced Threat Containment Unit and is sort of SHIELD’s public replacement that is secretly run by the Director of the rebuild organization. Or it was at least at the start of the story. That will change. Poor Tony.
MJ: Go to the address closest to it that Ana actually believes exists. Why do you need to go to this address?
Me: Contrary to popular belief, Tony was not really a playboy until after his parents died. At least, I think he used sex to dull the pain along with a lot of drugs and alcohol.
Hunter: You managed to make a bridge between two dimensions. Imagine what you could do if you were actually sober.
CoulsonPJ: But it’s worse than usual. Most of the noise is coming from bigots who are pissed about one of the Avengers being gay. It’s times like these that make me sad. Joey decided to go back to the world of construction.
Purple Princess: I just said I didn't want to have this conversation here. We were just talking about a leak problem.
“I’d rather just hug you.” Steve said putting an arm around her. “We made a lot of bad choices without all the information and we can’t change what we did but we can move forward. We can learn to actually talk to one another instead of just assuming the worst.”
Me: There’s also the fact that neither I nor anyone else from my team realized that things were going missing from the DODC for years. I should’ve realized something was up with that when the Baltimore incident happened. It wasn’t just one disgruntled employee, like we originally thought. There’s a lot of fuck ups all around.
“Because you saw a live demonstration in Siberia. You know what, give me the nano paper. If we’re in a relationship we share each other’s burdens and I’m going to take care of this one for you.”
Me: It’s hard to be happy that James is not dead, when I remember, he’s alive because of Hydra. They tortured him for years and made him do all sorts of bad things. He was their slave. He killed your parents. No, they made him kill your parents. If I’d just kept him from falling then things would be different. He wouldn’t have to live with all that guilt, if we’re ever able to undo the programming. They’re working on it, but Hydra really screwed up his mind.
“Okay Sugar Bear, shirt off,” Tony said as he placed his Stark pad on the bedside table and then turned to Steve. Who is apparently using the nano paper pad that the Princess created. “I responded to everyone that actually matters. Everybody else can wait until after the Malta sex retreat is over.”
When I started plotting this story, I did not realize that season five of AOS took place in a branch timeline because the agents created a new timeline when they went back through the monolith. Oops. But in my defense, neither did the AOS writers. Sometimes you have to just roll with it. They didn’t even think they were going to go past season five.
“You know it is not called that anymore." After the Accords fallout, they renamed it the American fudge dream. But it would always be the Captain America to Tony.
Tony: Well at least there’s the anti-discrimination laws on the books regarding genetics. In this country anyway. The Accords are actually cutting down on some of the persecution of Inhumans.
“In that case, how can you take being undercover for so long? Always pretending to be someone you’re not. I worry I’m going to say the wrong thing or respond to the wrong name and it will all fall apart, but this time Ross will arrest Tony for helping me."
Me: Well I’m not 20 anymore and I need food and maybe cuddling. I like cuddling. I was going to order something, but I figured I should respond to you first.
“Seriously, who comes up with these names?” Steve asked, wiping away a tear as he tried to put himself back into mission mode. Natasha handed him an iPad with his mission report. He was almost glad it wasn’t a Stark pad because that would remind him of Tony.
The mechanic: That's pretty much always been Steve's nickname. That should have told Steve Barnes knew about the boyfriend years ago, but my cuddle bunny doesn’t always see what’s in front of him until it slaps him in the face. Sometimes, literally.
SimmonsJA: Well that’s easy to agree on. I’m glad that I only have to liaison with the assistant secretary of OES. I think I may strangle the man if I had to see him in person. But what about the more important issues like the man who murdered your parents.
At least he thinks so. He’s having trouble reconciling this May with Melinda Gardner. How much were the two individuals the same? How much was an act? Steve still wasn’t entirely sure.
“Always. I mean, you don’t have to do me tonight. You just need to focus on something else for a moment. You can always do some drawing,” Tony suggested. “I feel like that your version of tinkering.”
Me: Which means getting back on her good side and unlike others, shoe baskets don’t work on her anymore.
Red phone: The target being the UN was probably the only reason why they authorized action without spending an hour debating it.
Sorry monkey lover, I really should have got back to you a lot earlier. I kind of got distracted with the boyfriend. And I also wanted to lay low for a few days after Mumbai. I’m sure Piper told you that we successfully got the lights back on in Mumbai. The Hellfire Protocol worked well. It lead them straight to me, anyway. But hey, I was having brunch with the former members of my boy band, so it was good.
Purple Princess: Okay, I switched to Avenger channels after I accidentally sent the first picture to May 2.
Once ratified, Inhumans and other gifted individuals will have full protection under the new agreement, meaning no participating government could force those protected by the Mumbai Agreement to fight for the government or become a test subject. If all goes well, the final document will be ratified by the US and dozens of other countries in Mumbai by the start of next week.
“We really can’t go on vacation, can we?” Steve asked, holding his shoulder. Tony is almost positive he’s bleeding. Note to self, considered bulletproof nano-armor for Steve, because you don’t know when somebody is going to try to kill you during breakfast. Although, he was certain Steve brought out the shield at some point during the melee.
Purple arrow: I could use you right now. Your goddaughter is currently crying on my lap again. Apparently, they’re flashing back to when Ross kidnapped Laura.
I wonder how Simmons spent an entire summer on the planet of the Damned with just one other person for contact? I hate it here and want to go home. I really miss my girlfriend and my cousin.
Tony: Why did I decide to make my retirement not effective until March 2017? I mean, I could be in Malta with you. At least until Afia starts school in late January. She’s doing the placement test today. Which is great, so she doesn’t have to sit through the annual remembrance ceremony for our illustrious founder.
“I don’t think the minibar has any protein bars, but we have cake.” Steve says, offering Tony one of the slices he got for himself.
Agent Laura: Also, her boyfriend is your nanny. I think she needs to stay with Hunter for a while. She’s better when she’s with him. She won’t make it without him.
“Doctor Strange, I presume,” Leo remarked, wondering where everyone else was. He was alone with the doctor at the moment.
“Shit! I didn’t know. Okay, they are definitely coming to Thanksgiving at the compound. We’re also doing something fun on black Friday. Can we do paintball at the compound?”
Tony: A little of column A and a little of column B. But you’ve dealt with me leaving my towels on the floor and you’re planning to be my date at a Mumbai wedding in November, so I’m a little more relaxed now.
"Artie, actually. We had a big fight before we last parted, and I regret never fixing things. Grant, Artie’s husband, said that he forgave me, but I could not believe him. Maybe before May, I would've said Peggy, but she helped me make peace with her. I have seen Melinda in so much pain because of Phil. I don't want to stay in that place. I realize I have to let go of what I never really had. Peggy was something I just built up in my head. It wasn't real. But I had Artie once upon a time, and I regret we never made peace." Steve confessed.
“I hope so too. I wish I was there to watch him. But I can’t be. But you are. So please keep an eye on him.” Steve wonders if he’s asking for too much but he knows Pepper loves Tony too.
Tony: Am I sorry that old Stark weapons are in the hands of various terrorist organizations, especially those that like to murder elephants for fun and profit? Yes. Am I and as an extension Stark Industries trying to get those weapons out of their hands? Yes. But I can’t fix everything.
To make things easier, I’m trying to come up with a way to differentiate between characters, especially in my A/Ns. So the Steve and Tony from we made better life choices timeline will be referred to as Tony and Steve Stark-Rogers or Tony SR and Steve SR. Although there will be some times in-story where Tony Stark Rogers will be referred to as just Director Stark. Apparently, he can’t make his subordinates refer to him as his future married name until after the actual wedding. ATCU bureaucracy is annoying.
You don’t blame the gun, you blame the one who pulled the trigger. That was Hydra. They’re gone now and I’m planning to salt their ashes.
Me: OK I have to go, because apparently Jeffrey wants to debrief me. And I can’t dodge him because this place is not quite as big as a helicarrier.
"Friday, please don’t actually send that message to Dr. Simmons." Steve said as he lay down next to Tony as he was trying to convince Dr. Simmons that he could totally do something such as Steve without endangering his health. Obviously, he wasn’t being successful which was a shame because Steve only bothered to put on boxer shorts after getting out of the shower. Bless him.
"I’m still concerned. I told you about the angry email that his aunt sent me. I’m also worried that she is going to discover the truth any moment and rake me over the coals for not telling her. At the same time, Peter really needs to be the one to tell her, and he’s just not ready. It doesn’t help that there’s three inhuman teenagers in Shield custody because their parents kicked them out for having powers.” Tony rambles.
Me: And I’m starting to realize about 80% of the stuff Howard said about you was complete bullshit, so that’s making everything easier.
Counselor Laura: As I stated earlier, we uncovered at least six against Daniel, not counting when they succeeded, and at least four against your Aunt Peggy. But again, some records were destroyed, so things are inconclusive.
Me: Also, I feel like we’re having the type of conversation that should happen in private. There's too much stuff I don't want other people to overhear.
Tony: Obviously they came up with that question before people did wake up one morning with superpowers, usually after having their morning fish oil pill. Or some shrimp. Fish tacos are starting to be scary. That’s what happened to Yo-Yo.
Red phone: Obviously it’s hard to maintain a relationship with someone who doesn’t understand why you need to miss a dinner to prevent a massacre at the UN.
D: Wanda will text her later. I assume by souvenirs, you mean a reconstructed hammer? Yes. Ana should be pushing you footage now.
“That wouldn't surprise me. Laura seems different than the woman we met during the Ultron fiasco.” Steve remarked.
Nomad: Sometimes you make no sense. And I don’t think it’s because I’m missing 70 years of pop-culture references.
"Mostly because I thought that Sharon was the first time he's connected with anybody romantically since the 40s. I would've behaved differently if I knew about Melinda. So he really was close to Sharon's great aunt?"
The new consultant: Then maybe you should write to him. His Avenger system name is TMNS short for teenage mutant ninja spider.
Warning: This chapter has heavy spoilers for Spider-Man: Homecoming. A lot of this stuff has been in the trailer, but the trailer was slightly misleading.
Counselor Laura: It's a little mixed, mostly because technically, Captain America is now May. Although she usually uses Agent America, the press still calls her Captain America because she has the shield. Steve is Nomad.
Me: Because there are other people counting on me. The kids need me to not be like Howard. And there are a lot of them in my life right now.
Purple Princess: We’re pretty sure she’s with the Asgardians, and we have an idea of what planet they’re on now. However, we are still working on establishing contact. Which is actually what I’m working on in the lab right now.
Purple arrow: What is the plural of apocalypse? Because apparently, we’re in the middle of more than one.
Counselor Laura: And he knew how traumatized you were by what Tiberius did and didn’t want any of your personal messages to be used like that against you.
I’m glad you’re safe. I wish you would’ve called me though. At least next time send me a ‘don’t believe what the news is reporting, I’m still alive’ text message. I don’t like having to go through your Shield bodyguards for that sort of thing because Mary didn’t know anything either. I hope you’re aware that your assistant is pissed at you. You have to learn to calculate time zones.
Nomad: I find you very confusing. And yet I really like you. Not your money, not your brains, not your swagger, just you. I care about you.
Stephen C: Only because Dr. Fitz was apparently working on some sort of antidote because he was paranoid. Tony says that’s not even in his normal line of research.
"You say that now that he's tucked away in another country. What happens when he's standing in the room next to you? Would you be able to fight by his side? Would you be able to take your boyfriend having a pizza night with him?"
The new consultant: You owe me pancakes when I get there with chocolate and blueberries. Why do I feel like this is the beginning of another New York level apocalypse?
Just because they’re both together physically doesn’t mean the story is over with. We still have a lot of things to cover, like the climax of Homecoming.
Genius Princess: A third invasion. As you can see from yesterday, the American president is too busy prancing the happy couple around the Rose Garden to actually do anything useful. Despite Steve telling the president that the Confederacy told them that Thanos was on his way to destroy the earth.
Things went okay-ish. Yo-Yo had the Bastard in front of her with weapon in hand. She could've killed him. I wouldn't have thought anything less of her if she did. This guy murdered her cousin who was more like a brother to her. He was the only family she had left before he was murdered. Killing the Bastard that did it wouldn't make the pain go away, but it would feel good to know that the person who took your loved one is no longer breathing.
TMNS: Are you sure Agent Coulson doesn’t have a thing with Miss Laura’s ex-husband? Also, do you take me for an idiot? It totally makes sense that you would bring me in if you are worried about your boyfriend. You would rather deal with it yourself then have someone like Secretary Ross hurt him.
“The difference is that I did kill his parents. I doubt we’re ever going to sit down and have tea together.”
“I was not expecting to be standing around in New York spring weather waiting for the God of thunder and his asshole brother to show up outside the site of the future Home of Alchemax. Because baby bird told us that we needed to warn the brothers Norris that the big purple raisin with the glove fetish is going to want his blue bobble back,” Hunter complained as they kept an eye on the former nursing home being demolished waiting for Thor and his brother to show up, as predicted.
What I feel for Tony is completely different. All-encompassing in a way. But it’s real. I love him. I don’t want to think of a world without him there because he makes things better. He makes me better. He’s caring and compassionate and yes, he screws up a lot, but he tries. He never gives up trying to make things better. To fix his own mistakes and he is aware that he’s not perfect. He’s not trying to be.
CoulsonPJ: By that point, I think he will be sufficiently distracted by the package publicly announcing his return. I doubt he will still be a problem.
Anthony: Although I don’t know how we are going to train that good doer’s streak out of him. You still have it and it’s been decades.
Welcome back to the "bad choices were made" timeline. This conversation takes place about an hour after the last one ended in this timeline.
Spoiler warning: This chapter also draws heavily from Agents of SHIELD up to episode 99/5.11 as well as the scenes in episodes 5. 15 and 5.16 that take place before episode 15.11 chronologically. There is also some Infinity War foreshadowing in this conversation, and therefore, spoilers for Infinity War. But hey, we are in a different timeline and one thing from the movie is definitely not coming to past here, which is Tony and Pepper being engaged. More notes after you read including who is who.
4. You learn from your mistakes. A lot of people don’t. They just keep making them over and over again. That’s not you. You acknowledge them. You now know you made a wrong call in bringing Benji to Germany and you’re trying to do better now. It takes a big person to not only acknowledge their mistakes, but learn from them.
Blue phone: You can’t save everyone or fix everything. You can just try to do the right thing and hope that is enough.
Anthony: If you’re not going to take advantage of your assistant’s super speed, what’s the point of having an assistant with super speed? I need a break after what happened. Also I have a few meetings with various government officials to deal with some of our fuck ups in the country. If I get them done now, that means more time with you.
Red phone: I was 13 when she told me about this friend who liked both and that it was okay. I was 16 when she told me it was specifically you in an effort to cheer me up after some random board member got angry about me having a boyfriend. She made me promise to never tell anyone else. I kept that promise even when you’re Bucky crush was becoming dangerous.
"Also, I know you're scared. I was terrified that Pepper would keep me away from Morgan because of how badly I screwed up. However, we were able to work out an amicable custody arrangement. May will not cheat Robin out of quality Morgan time. She definitely won’t cheat you out of quality Robin time. Your name is on that adoption certificate. If you need them, my lawyers are there for you.”
Me: Even though the moron dumped Pepper for somebody from the Hunger Games or some other young adult franchise. I’m not sure which. I had a little rage blackout when I was talking to Pepper.
I also love the guy who would risk alienating the man that he is in love with because it was necessary to help others because it was the right thing to do. Or as close to the right thing to do as could be in a situation where there were no right things to do. I love the guy who tries to save the world and screws up badly and keeps trying. I love the man who is sarcastic and filled with snark because he's trying to cover up the pain he feels inside.
“I like how you try to fix things even when you have no idea where to start. I like that you’re there for me during this when I wasn’t always there for you, and I should’ve been.” Steve acknowledged.
Anthony: So I am actually back home. You have no idea how much I miss my 5000 thread count sheets and having Friday available to cater to my every take-out whim. Right now, she's getting me virgin Drunk raspberry cheesecake French toast.
Genius Princess 2018: We have yet to build a quantum tunnel, and I think we’re going to need Pym particles in addition to the White monolith. It may take time to negotiate access to the particles.
“Tell her what is actually happening. Pepper is already going to be mad at me for having you call her. Also, see if you can convince her to go to Malta? I would like her not to end up collateral damage from the purple one.” He is sure she’ll say no, but he needs to try. He is still surprised May Parker Riley agreed to go. But maybe she’s just going for Miles’s sake.
With Howard, I always had to be perfect. I never could be who he wanted me to be. It took me a long time to realize that I didn’t need to be. I don’t want Peter to push himself to be perfect. I just want him to be 15. I never got to be 15. I’m pretty sure I was a college junior at his age.
May: Except that’s a lie. You know that’s a lie because you wouldn’t be there with him right now if there wasn’t a chance. I want you to have what I couldn’t have. I know you, Steve. You won’t make a move on him if we are still married, even if I pack lube and condoms for your overnight trip. You can’t make this work if we’re still married to one another.
Part three of the Use Your Words universe. Sequel to I Hope You Have Unlimited Text Messaging and Text Messages from the Edge of High school. Although you can continue reading without having read Text Messages from the Edge, but it's beneficial if you have. Don’t you want to know why MJ and Flash are friends now?
Purple Arrow: Okay. I’ll tell you what I saw and what Simmons told me. I don’t understand, but maybe Stark will.
Red phone: Me too. Some days I'm surprised you haven't found a super villain to make you a time machine yet.
Venom: MJ is not OK right now. She’s very worried about her cousin. We don’t know where she is, and it’s approaching 48 hours.
Cuddle Bunny: You’re not crazy. You’re probably just in need of therapy, but Sam says the same about me.
“That’s not happening. You are ridiculously tall now, and you’ll kill Pepper’s couch. She loves that couch. They went out of business after the snap, so I’m never going to be able to find a replacement. Besides, I was reminded by Laura that we shared a bed before.” It happened during the Ultron fiasco. They somehow woke up tangled around each other, fully erect, and agreed never to talk about it. In hindsight, that was probably a mistake.
Me: Some do like Senator Nadeer, but in her case, she’s obviously team inhuman internment and not team use enhance people as weapons for our side. But not all are like that.
Monkey Lover 2: As you know, it's still growing in, that’s the nano mask. Why did I agree to do this?
Counselor Laura: Unfortunately, every day I've been here since Clint found out that I'm Laura from alternate 2018, he's been avoiding me. I think Friday has been helping him.
Anthony: I’m being completely serious. I could use a good get well card. Lily bear’s card was lovely, but the board of directors sent me a get well basket that contained trail mix cookies that were chop full of sunflower seeds..
“Yes, unless I fall right to sleep as soon as I get to the Arlington house. Although, thankfully my meeting with the President tomorrow has been pushed back to 2 PM.”
“However, I’m used to problems that have solutions and I don’t think there is an easy one for this.”
The Mechanic: Okay I’m well aware I’m neglecting everybody and I promise I will take a rest break and at least reply to a few emails before I go back to the shirtless Stefan in my bed. He’s just so tempting. Absolutely edible.
Me: In this country. But in some of the other countries that you’ve been in recently, it could be a problem. Actually you going against assholes solo who like to kidnap innocent kids already makes you a big target. You’re worried about me getting picked up by Ross’s flunkies and I’m worried about you getting killed because you pissed off the wrong guy.
Friday: Actually, Laura just requested that you go through the questions. She wants you two to work through your emotional bullshit for the sake of half of all life in the universe.
Steve placed the phone in his pocket, just as the door opened. Tony dropped his phone to the ground as soon as Steve’s lips descended on his. Steve was just that eager.
Me: Good to know I won the pool but why are you not having this conversation with your counselor friend?
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Your feedback makes me incredibly happy. Just to let everyone know, this is going to be a slow burn. Tony and Steve’s relationship was completely wrecked in Civil War and now they're trying to rebuild it on a foundation of stone instead of one of sand. That takes time.
Tony: Don’t worry, the only naked person I want to see is you. I can’t wait to take your clothes off.
Thank you to everyone who has read or review the last chapter. All of you have been lovely. I was originally planning to post this Monday but I couldn’t wait that long. I’m working on the next batch of chapters right now. Your words of encouragement keep me in the happy writing zone and make me write faster.
"I am too. We don’t have to go too fast. In our business you don’t want to assume, but maybe we can take a moment. If things go well tomorrow, this might become an easier thing." I.e. if the world accepts Stefan Carter, then they could see each other in public and Steve would be safe. Deep down that’s all Tony really wants for his boyfriend. (Of course, Tony was already making a contingency plan or six.)
The Mechanic: OK, I will send the car. Please send Yo-Yo any menu requests. Though no alcohol because I’m 12 step-ing. You can ask her any questions you have about being a powered person.
Anthony: I can understand why that’s no longer a simple question. Do you actually count someone as a sibling that you’ve never met? Not only that, I assume she doesn’t even know you exist.
The Mechanic: Okay, that’s bad. Very bad. Although what do you expect when you share a name with the president of the Confederacy. His pre-married name anyway.
Me: Which is the only reason why I did not confront her about the Melinda Garner thing. (Message not sent.)
Tony Potts: Now I'm going to push you into the world and tell you to text message you're not a husband.
CoulsonPJ: We were able to arrive in time to at least help with the extraction because Ned called Laura after Happy hung up on him when he tried to warn him about the attack.
Linda Bear: He had Friday design Captain Oblivious an art studio in the new penthouse. It looks really nice. He’s working on something, especially because the asshole just got me fired a couple of days ago.
Anthony: Okay the stepdad thing was kind of for your safety because covers hold together better when there’s at least a grain of truth to it. Hey, it’s not like they can interview your wife because she is dead and her daughter is CIA, again. It’s easier to make one person then two.
Nomad: Tony, we still need to talk about the fact that you made me Sharon’s stepdad. Stepdad! Seriously, we need to talk about this.
Venom: I don’t think I needed your BFF to know I’m not straight. If this is all over school Monday, I will punch your best friend out.
Anthony: Then Jeffrey whatever pointed out the good PR of having a disabled military veteran and member of the enhanced community as head of the agency in charge of dealing with the weird and super powered. Then he brought up the fact that the president’s cabinet is predominantly able bodied white males and maybe some diversification is necessary.
