“Something like that.”
doesn’t. In his haste to leave the room, Cas bangs his knee on the dresser and hisses out a curse.
After a few moments sitting there in silence Sam asks, “You okay?
Right.  Dean was trying to do something.  He attempts a smile, but it feels awkward and nervous as he bins the burned panini.  “Well, um,” he says, clearing his throat and wiping his hands on the waist apron, “so I remember you saying, back when you were human that first time around, about food.  What food you liked?”
“Just promise me,” Sam says.
“No?” Cas says, eyes still big as saucers.
Dean jumps when Jack clears his throat, finally unfreezing himself from the doorway and stepping into the room, closer to Cas.  “I have been explaining what um—what happened and—”
There’s a sudden shift of air and the back of Dean’s neck prickles when he senses a presence that wasn’t there before.  On instinct, Dean snatches the gun he keeps under his pillow, bolts upright in bed, cheeks still wet, and points in the direction of that presence.

Sam’s hands fold across his chest. “Relocated.”
“Very helpful, thanks so much.”  Dean rolls his eyes. “I need you to go to the store for me.”
“Because she’s

too.  It hurts to feel incomplete. It feels unnatural to be this far away from something that he’s always carried within himself. Every step between him and Cas screams to be closed and Dean isn’t sure how long he can hold out.
Cas has been alive for four months. It’s been approximately twenty-four hours since nearly losing each other in passages of that sprawling cave.  Dean knew on the way back home that being there had triggered something for Cas.  He’d been so quiet in the car, staring out of the window with his eyebrows drawn, lips pursed—his
how much better this version of Dean was, what exactly was on the table that he could have that human Dean would never give, surely Cas would have agreed.
A whole six hours Dean deals with this.
“We’re gonna fight,” Dean warns, “and—
,” Cas continues, squeezing Dean’s hand to keep him from interrupting in a way that seems absentminded, habitual, and makes Dean’s heart pitch against his ribs, “even those qualities seem different.  Less...acute.  You seem,” Cas swallows, “softer.”
“I just can’t,” Dean says, desperate for Sam to understand why, “I’m sorry man.  I’ll call Donna, she’s good with gh—with these kinds of cases.”  He turns to Mr. Lowell and shakes his head, mouth moving with words he can’t seem to find the voice for. “I’m sorry.. So sorry for your loss Mr. Lowell.”

have is Kaia, and Kaia has Claire, and they’re so damn good for each other. She talks every once in a while about how Kaia brought home paint and canvas because once Claire mentioned she used to draw a lot as a kid, wanted to be the next Georgia O’Keefe or something, but when her world went sideways so did all the little things that she used to enjoy.  Now Claire is painting again, even decided to present a piece at an open gallery over in Cincinnati just for the hell of it.  Next thing, she’s got an email from some curator over in New Orleans asking if she would be interested in working on a collection—can even come live in the studio above the venue rent-free in order to dedicate all her energy and attention to it.
Cas sighed quietly, turned to look at Dean. “Of course Dean, we are good,” and it was a lie.  Cas was a godawful liar.  The little head nod and lifeless smile didn’t fool Dean for a second.  Their

up close and personal with the goods—”
But Dean wanted him there, the way he always wanted Cas close enough to touch, and reached for his beer resting on the countertop and waved it in the air.  “Down here.”
Cas arches up into Dean, a loud, broken groan escaping his throat when Dean reconfigures his limbs, slides his mouth over the tip and sucks—and god, oh god, Dean can feel that everywhere. One of Cas’ knees bend, and Dean wraps an arm around the calf to steady himself, trying to go down farther, then back up.  He feels his own cock leaking a wet spot onto Cas’ brand new sheets, and for one delirious moment Dean thinks this is how he’s going to come—just from Cas feeling Dean sucking his dick—but then Cas is pulling Dean up by the hair.  Does it so swiftly that Dean can’t even complain about his mouth no longer being full, or the scalp pain from being manhandled.
Dean had thought. Then, more dangerously
Eileen half-smiles, half-winces, and nods.
Claire is talking to Cas near the end of the table, showing him pictures on her phone.  He looks a little tipsy off the wine, cheeks pink and making those rare smiles with the teeth showing, and Dean can’t help it, doesn’t mean to do it with Cas just sitting three feet away, but a rush of hunger overcomes him so completely that a sharpness arcs through his entire body.  He knows Cas felt it too because he gasps a little, fingernails scratching at the tablecloth. Claire touches his arm, brow furrowed, but Cas shakes his head and makes some kind of excuse while Dean, embarrassed, tosses back the whole glass of red.  When he glances back up, Cas is giving him a puzzled look as if to say
Cas pulled back a couple inches, chest heaving, never taking his eyes off Dean’s mouth like he resented the space for keeping him from it.  His hair was fucked up from Dean’s hands, sticking out all messy and on end so the only other guesses as to what he’d been up to in the past 30 seconds were limited to sticking a fork in a light socket.
Their hands and arms tangle as they shove down each other’s underwear until they’re skin to skin, heat against heat. Dean straddles Cas’ upper thighs, and grabs both of their cocks in one of his hands.  His fingers can’t reach around them completely, but it’s enough for there to be friction and Dean watches in open-mouthed, lust inspired awe, as the flushed heads of their cocks disappear in and out of the circle of his palm.  It’s the first time he’s touched Cas bare like this, Dean realises.  Both times he always skirted around touching Cas here, made him do it on his own.  For why?  Because of some flimsy plausible deniability he could retain afterward?  What a waste, this fucking rules.  Cas feels amazing in his hand, blood hot and twitching out little drops of precome that leak down over the head of Dean’s cock, and Dean’s mouth should be there, somehow.  He needs to—
“Team freewill in theory, but not in practice, huh?”
The two of them, standing there cackling in the hallway like a couple of lunatics, every wheeze setting off a bright flare of pain that eroded through the last layers of the perc. Still, Dean wanted to draw that moment out, keep Cas there in that easy liminal space, put off having to step outside and back into a world where Dean was always failing at something and Cas was once again out of reach.
and I wouldn’t have survived it if I didn’t have you.  So let me—let me help you.  Just talk to me.”
Cas stirs against him, his body rolling into a stretch and loosening his limbs from where they’re wrapped around Dean.  His breathing tapers away from the steady rise and fall of sleep as he begins to come around and—there it is.  Cas goes stock still. Dean can’t even feel him breathe.
“Thanks.  That was— I needed that,” Dean said, which was kind of weird and probably why Cas didn’t say anything back.  He cleared his throat.  “This can’t—” he started, “we—”
Claire jabs a finger in Dean’s face and says, “Fix it.”
” Dean lies.  Hasn’t looked a Bosc pear without feeling a compulsion to sob since 1998.
“Right, um.. Listen to me,” Sam says calmly, “I need you to take a deep breath.  Try and count to ten.”
“Wanna fight about it then?”
She sighs, casts her eyes away from Dean’s.  “I’ll look again, but Dean dear— am saying this from personal experience: Accept the regrets. Grieve him, and let him go.”
“First of all—not true.  I know you’ve been using my toothbrush.”
“Let me get this straight.”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean managed, dazed, “you

“Look, that’s part of
when it wouldn’t—I dunno—
“Yeah, me too.”  Dean can’t say anything else, lets his eyes burn a hole into the tabletop.
Jack looks into Dean’s eyes for a moment.  “Dean is already connected to Castiel through this—” he places his hand over the faded scar of a handprint on Dean’s left shoulder and even through layers of clothes it still draws up a warm flicker of sensation.  “Part of Castiel echoes in Dean.  A small piece of Castiel’s grace, the power it took to raise you from Hell and build you again, was left behind.”  Jack gives Dean a significant look which makes Dean believe there is a bit more to it than that.  “When I tried to channel the connection for myself, it diverted to Dean.  It went.. home.  I thought it would be me, just because I’m more, well..”
Dean smiles, looks over at Cas with his elbow resting against the door panel, temple nudged against his fist.  His eyes flick to the side and clock Dean watching him.  The sides of Cas’ mouth begin to turn up. “Watch where you’re going,” he reminds, much less passive aggressive this time.
Too intimate.
Dean—he isn’t broken.”  The conviction with which Cas said it made Dean toss his head back and laugh, but Cas seemed unphased.  “Pain, like fungus, is ubiquitous to the human experience.”
“How can you even ask—”
“Anyways—but I didn’t know if you had a favourite flavour or whatever so I just got, uh, a lot.  I mean, course’ we got your average grape and strawberry.  We got your apple, blueberry, blackberry, peach—at least I think that’s peach.  You might want to sniff it first.  I know one was pineapple-habanero and the colour was sort of the same.  This pile over here—that’s all crunchy peanut butter.  This one here, that’s smooth.  I want you to know you’re a freak if you like crunchy better.”
sound, fumbles it around to disperse the heat from his fingertips while Dean tries to locate an empty plate.  This is all still going on when the door bangs open.
Those things seem so small now, and Cas’ absence is a soul-piercing scream that resonates and brings Dean along with it, but nothing else. That’s what real death is, he thinks, it’s the emptiness.  It isn’t a concept, it’s not something written down on pages or turned into music and art, it’s not a place you go:  Emptiness is the place in Dean’s chest when he walks in Cas’ room and sees the crumpled up, discarded shirt left on the ground.  It’s the chair in the kitchen where Cas sat at night, waiting for him.  It’s the bloodstain on a door, in a room Dean can’t go in, where Cas bought them those last few minutes to say goodbye.  It’s how all these memories are slowly being colonised by grief instead of existing as something quiet and familiar.  It’s the look in Dean’s eye that the widow drinking coffee at the diner in town recognises and asks
. She pops a potato chip in her mouth and crunches down, settles her elbows on the table and leans toward Dean like it’s suddenly an interrogation.  “Got any plans? Something in mind that’s
“Yeah, it helps to be uh, touching, you know.”
His head is nestled underneath Dean’s chin, one arm slung across the rest of Dean’s torso, his hand stuffed between Dean’s back and the mattress.  A leg is draped over Dean’s hips, knee bent, his foot on the outside of Dean’s upper thigh.  He might be drooling, which is
you I’ll give you space, but you’re feeling so
Jack’s eyes soften.  “What I did—” he opens his closed fists and Dean sees the faint golden glimmer of power playing across his palms.  “The Empty can only keep souls that are no longer human, or never were. Even if an angel loses their grace and seems for all intents and purposes
It’s morning.  Wednesday.  It’s been thirteen months, three weeks, five days, and eleven hours since Castiel was taken away.  There’s a fresh mug of coffee in front of Dean with steam still curling upward from it.  He’s picking at the bowl of apple cinnamon steel cut oats that Sam has him eating most mornings to offset the semi-regular plates of bacon
“No,” Jody says and shakes her head, “no, because what you’re feeling right now isn’t just despair, it’s the gratefulness underneath.  It’s the love that we still hold for the people we lose, it’s the beauty that they were ever able to exist at all.”
I mean.  There’s somewhere I need to take you.”
They have a rogue demon stirring up trouble outside of New Castle, Colorado.  A couple bodies turned up down river in what looks like a ritualistic killing, another person missing under sketchy circumstances.  Rowena drops the tip via one of those beefcake demons that serve as her personal guard.  He appears in the middle of lunch, dressed in his Baby Gap black tee and well-fitted trousers, looking closer to a Greek god than a demon flunkie.
Jack blinks and cocks his head in a way that's
into it.
“So what?”  Dean meant to snap, but it came out breathless and quiet.
,” Dean managed to grit out, small and a little shrill, with a sudden strangled feeling in his throat—that thickness you feel when you’re about to cry, and Dean didn’t know why it was there
“Wait,” Sam says, “is he still an angel?”
“Uh huh,” Sam says, holding up a hand. “Right.  And the night he was taken, you didn’t say anything back.”
Dean is more whole now, than he ever was in one piece.
Before Dean even takes a minute to register
“Yeah, I’d hope not.”
“You’re right,” Dean stares at her for a second then looks down at his feet, taps his fingers on the table. “You’re right, that’s what happens,” he says, because it’s not wrong. He’s seen it happen plenty. A person can survive so much that it kills them—maybe not in body, but it can kill something inside you.  Something important.  Makes your feelings stop working right.  At some point the violence turns inward and you’re just trying to run the clock down against yourself.
So Dean—he’d barge in and shatter the silence, get Cas’ eyes on him, get him up and put him to work helping Dean cook blueberry pancakes in the dead of night. There was always a reason, always an excuse to touch him in a way Dean wouldn’t be able to do in the light of day when Cas was wrapped up in all his layers, and Dean was Dean again.

anything, just—pick out some stuff you want.”
He did, Dean thinks, maybe not on the surface, but deep down he did, and he encouraged it almost every step of the way. Part of him knew the only reason Cas stayed in the kitchen at night was because of the possibility that Dean might eventually be there as well, and that thought made Dean feel
A fresh wave of sensation pours over him, and Dean arches with it like a live wire, but this time there’s less pain.  It feels… complicated.  Familiar, sort of the way it felt when Cas would brush his fingers against Dean’s forehead and make something crazy happen—one of the biggie miracles like throwing him decades back in time, or transporting him halfway across the country in the blink of an eye.  Not to say it’s a
He used to think it was comfort which kept people from clearing out the rooms of the loved ones they lost, but here, now, Dean can’t imagine anything in the world that would make him feel more helpless. These rooms stay intact because the people left behind can’t accept them being hollow— the door stays closed and all the mess, all the wrinkles in the sheets and half written notes left on the shelves can keep on staying locked away.  You can pretend there’s still a chance that person will come back, pretend they’re still here even though they aren’t and never will be again.
Maybe Dean had known then—some extrasensory instinct whispering in the back of his mind to make it count, that their time together was growing short.  That this would be the last time they’d ever be this close.
in that sort of bitchy tone of voice he gets when he knows Dean is being petty for attention.  But none of that happens, and eventually Dean grates his teeth together and turns around before he reaches the breaking point, begins a sullen march back to the bunker and slams the door behind him once inside.
“—and it wasn’t just because of the
“It would be embarrassing to die en route to the phallological museum. Sam would never recover.”
“I’ve only been God for a year!” Jack says, finally raising his voice, “I’m still part human!  That part isn’t perfect, it is not meant to be!
I don’t
there to begin with, and that sometimes it felt like he was playing a part, or how the old pent-up longing in the back of his mind belonged to someone else.
“No it came out wrong, I didn’t mean—”
Sam flings the door open, stands there for a split second as he takes in Dean’s state before rushing over to help.  “What happened?” he asks urgently, his hand on Dean’s shoulder, his cheek, down to his wrist where he begins counting the pulse rate.
Dean doesn’t care about any of that.  He sits bedside to Cas, both hands clasped low over his forearm, thumb tracing the knobbed ridge of Cas’ wrist.
Dean turned his mouth to rub his lips feverishly over the crest of Cas’ cheek and ear, telling him, “There, right there,” then groaning when Cas sucked in a breath, stuck a hand over the place in Dean’s jeans where he was straining and jumping at the touch.  A thumb traced the outline of the head before Cas rubbed an open palm down the length of Dean’s cock. Then doing it again, and again, his movements a blur.  “
he said, then when he finally noticed Dean's eyes burning a path across his chest,
“You’re right.”
For a moment, Cas kisses him back, whether it’s reflexive or some small allowance, because just as quickly he’s pulling backward. Dean tries to chase him, but Cas murmurs, “Dean,” into the kiss, then more sternly,
Cas has the audacity to twitch where he’s still gloved inside of Dean’s ass.
When the action breaks out, it’s definitely not the worst fight they’ve been in, not by a long shot, but it's the first one in a while that has given them a run for their money.  Sam sets right to the task of fighting his way toward the partially activated magical nexus to shut it down, and Cas barrels ahead of Dean and smashes into Simeon before Dean has a chance to get there first.  He lands a solid punch across the jaw before Simeon uses that goddamn demonic telekinesis to fling him into the air and against a stalactite.
to me, I know you wanna.” Silence, then Dean pouting, “Look, I’ll even ask nicely: Pretty please? We can talk about
“And?” Dean asks, grimacing when Claire swipes some half-masticated sandwich crumbs off the table and onto the floor.
“It’s really,” Dean murmurs, closing in and letting their noses brush, “
It vanishes as soon as he’s close to Cas and finally feels whole again. If he’s being honest, it metaphorically doesn’t feel any different than all the yearning and aching he’s done for Cas over the years.  He was sick with it then, and he’s sick with it now—just in a more tangible way.
“Drive-thru daiquiris,” Claire counters.
He’d never gotten the shirt back.  Dean had forgotten about it honestly, but holding it now—this ridiculous Ed Hardy knock-off looking motherfucker—he might as well be holding a bomb.
Cas, desperate to get through to him, to make Dean understand:
She purses her lips and thinks for a moment.  “I never
Dean digests this even if he can’t yet relate to it.  It’s true that the grief is so large and certain that even when it’s strangling him, Dean is desperate to keep it close. That’s where he still feels Cas’ presence the most.  But it all still just...hurts.  He isn’t grateful for it.  He doesn’t want to learn anything from it.
“It’s alright,” Dean says, “it’s okay.”  Slowly, his hand trembling, Dean strokes the nape of Cas’ neck.
The way Dean wanted to take the words back as soon as they were out. He wanted to beg Cas to
be because—because Cas doesn’t
“Course you know me, I thought there had to be a catch.  Gotta be a trap or something.  I was ready to write it off,” Claire says through a mouthful of BLT.  “So Kaia says fine, let’s go stake it out.  We go to New Orleans, spend the next three days following this person around.”
Besides, Cas still had a brain full of lore and could hold his own in a fight.  Even without all that angelic strength he was still pretty scrappy.  It made sense to bring him along.
“I don’t like—” Cas says, haltingly, like it’s not something he wants to admit, “I don’t like..the dark.”
Things go blurry all at the edges here.  Before, Dean was distantly aware that his cheeks were wet somewhere between the bookshelf and the bed, but one second he’s holding the shirt, and the next it’s like all the oxygen has been pulled out of the room and Dean’s lungs can’t expand from the absence of it.  It feels like he’s dying.
“I’m worried,” Sam admits, “about both of you.  But, yeah.. Yeah,” he says, a smile in his voice even though it wavers with emotion, “it’s really good to have him home.  Really good.”  When Dean can only grunt a response, Sam starts to get up and walk for the door.  “I’m gonna get some air, update Eileen.  I’ll be back in—”
His eyes are closed, either unconscious or asleep, mouth slack, lips chapped the way they always were—body curled inward on itself on the floor.
“Do you want me to rip my
“Sometimes.  It was...unpleasant. Most of the time it was only darkness and nothingness.  When you’re alone like that for long enough, unable to move or speak or connect, your mind turns against you. Time has no shape there, so moments feel endless.
Cas keeps staring at Dean, and Dean is beginning to feel insecure and lopsided.  He never quite realised just how much he held the power in this, in whatever it was going on between them, and now it feels reversed.  Or perhaps this is balance. Parity always feels unequal when before something was weighted in your favour.
Later, Dean would blame what happened on this.  He’d feed the line to Castiel, knowing good and damn well that by the time they were discharged and stumbling their way into that empty hallway right outside of the ER, that the dopamine intoxication was barely a dopamine buzz and the only thing Dean was high off of, was Cas’ presence next to him, and how grateful he was that they both were alive.
“The last time you and Cas even got near this subject was—”
It’s been a week and Cas is still asleep.  Dean nearly goes mad with it, each hour dragging on and on, and Dean has never been the most patient of people.  After the first 48 hours they manage to get ahold of Rowena. As always there’s great deal of over-curious questions about the science behind the soul-splitting, and a magical check-up where she pushes up Cas’ shirt to spread her fingers on his bare chest (during which Dean side-eyes her
Dean snaps his gaze up to her.
“Humans hurt because they are alive, they sustain damage because it is the nature of the soul, and this changes them with time.  But it does not mean they are broken.  Simply.. transformed.”
“He won’t—” emotions flip in Dean’s chest when the familiarity of grief rubs at odds with the new reality, and his throat closes up momentarily. When he speaks again, his voice is rough. “He’s going to stay, right?  Whatever you did… it means the Empty, it can’t take him away again. Right?”
Cas, who had been charting the line of Dean’s shoulder with his lips, suddenly bites down.  “Stop that.”  Dean jerks, then moans, and Cas smiles against his collarbone. "Stop trying to convince me into not loving you. It won't happen."
Whatever it is they’re seeing, it has
Right there—right there he should have been honest.  Should have said
of that anxiety as he stoops a little and licks over Dean’s nipple, up to his collarbone.  Steadies the base of Dean's head with one of his hands and prints wet, sucking kisses up the line of muscle in his neck.  The other hand cups itself over Dean’s left pectoral, Cas’ fingernails scratching against the skin there.
“Okay Romeo you heard the guy,
The whole damn bunker smells like stale coffee, burnt herbs, burnt blood, Sam is passed out on the sofa, his legs hanging off the end.  Dean knew he needed to give him a break when sleep deprivation and the energy loss from all that mojo had Sam’s speech slurring so badly that he misspoke the evocation and pulled through the business end of a hellhound. Dean realised the mistake before things could get messy and dumped water over the summoning spell, severing it and half the hellhound in the process.
” Dean blurts, rising up from the table to shoo him away with a newspaper or attack him with a knife.  Orzan smirks and disappears, and Dean lurches toward Cas and starts rubbing the mark away with his cuff, telling him
“Nice family, huh,” Dean says, nodding toward the pictures.
wrong.  Dean couldn’t bear any tenderness from those hands
damn unpleasant when he’s seen it happen to other people—Cas included.  Well, quick maybe, but not exactly the last image he wants to leave Sam—globs of small intestine and detached spine flying through the air like fucked up Mardi Gras beads.
“I’m not sure I know how to.. do this. To settle down?  The world has always been ending in some way.  I know it’s such a terrible thing to have become accustomed to.” He tilts his head and stares at his hands, rotating them left then right—furrows his brow when he seems unable to tap into the divine power that he used to wield at a touch.  “Historically speaking, I don't do so well when I’m useless.”
” Dean pressed on, “we can’t afford to get distracted.  There’s so much shit going down right now.  Jack, Michael, whatever made this,” he held up his fresh scar, “all those people out there are depending on us to pull them through.”
Also, if Dean can ever manage to get things right with Cas, it would sort of ruin any honeymoon phase to drag Cas with him to the bathroom after making poor choices at a Pizza Hut buffet. The discomfort of being apart has got to come second chair sometimes to the potential loss of dignity.
going down on
“Yes. Work. Can we start it tomorrow?” Cas breathes against Dean’s neck. He pushes their mouths together and then presses his forehead against Dean’s.
“Sure hope you never come to your senses,” Dean tries to drawl out.
Without thinking, and before his brain can analyse it into something impossible, Dean reaches across the head of the bucket seat and slides his arm until his thumb is resting against the top knob of Cas’ spine.  Warmth curls up in Dean’s chest at the contact.  If Cas notices it for being out of character, he doesn’t say anything, and maybe he even presses back into it.
“Torturing Margaret Thatcher for eternity,” Dean surmises.
He felt like he couldn’t take in enough air, breathing hard and loud into the stifling room before his fingers clenched—soft hair scratching against his palm.  He didn’t warn Cas or anything, let himself fall over the edge—and then Cas was swallowing around him, the hand splayed against the outside of Dean’s thigh tightening to hold him still.  The sound of Cas sucking him through it was choked and wet, Dean can’t even remember any noises of his own, just the obsessive thought pounding against his skull that he’d come in Cas’ mouth. When it was over, Dean went boneless, elbow giving out as he fell back against the mattress.
you.”  A blinding ache passes in his chest and Dean hisses and grasps the side of the table.  “Jesus, Cas,” he says tersely, “let up a sec will ya, I’m still trying to tell you something.  I don’t use the L-word a lot and you—you’re sort of the only person I’ve ever said it to and understood what it means.. I know you probably need some time before you trust me with that but—”
If Cas noticed, he didn’t say anything, he was too engrossed in getting them both off through sheer willpower because there was no reason a frenzied dry hump in a hospital bathroom with the toilet three feet away should have made them that hot.  It smelled like fucking lysol and piss for crying out loud, but it didn’t matter to either of their bodies.  The hand on Dean’s cock retreated, grabbed hold of Dean’s hip and spun him around fast to face the wall—Cas not even missing a beat before he was rolling his hips against Dean’s ass.  He didn’t give Dean a chance to think about it and get antsy, just threw his weight against Dean, holding him there, his hands over the tops of Dean’s hands, stronger than he should be.  He threaded their fingers together. Dean’s scabbed knuckles were cushioned against the pad of Cas’ palms and that’s what did it—not just the unmistakeable mimicry of Cas fucking him from behind, or how Dean’s dick was wedged against the wall and his stomach, and how every thrust made his blood burn.
He’s a little fucking dirty. Dean tells him that.
“You—” Sam murmurs, clears his throat, “you might want to sit down.”
banner taped up in the dining room.  Some of the letters look like they’ve been assimilated from a former Happy Birthday sign because they have been converted with a sharpie.  Everything is pink and sparkly unicorns, and not even close to Claire or Kaia’s style, but when they walk in the front door and see everyone standing there with shimmery unicorn party hats—Dean has never seen Claire smile that much.
you!”  He’s out of breath by the time the rant peters out into dead air.  For a few blessed moments Dean feels a little lighter for having lashed out, but it fades fast into the same bitter heartache of before when he’s forced to accept that bullying the Empty into giving up Cas just isn’t going to work.
“The other one,” Dean gasps when Cas presses in a little harder, enough for the very tip to sink inside, “oh fuck.” His heart hammers inside his chest, nerves and excitement, and the smallest nagging voice in the back of his mind—
and Cas is capable of so much better?  What if it’s too late?  What if he doesn’t want Dean anymore?  Why did Dean ever think he could make Cas happy in the first place?  Dean’s no good at this, he’s no good at any of it, and Cas will eventually figure that out and realise he was wrong. He’ll leave, and what will Dean do then?
Jody laughs quietly and pats Dean’s leg.  “It will. One day you’ll feel more alone than you’ve ever felt, sick and tired of all the aching, and for a second you’ll feel all alone. That’s when you’ll remember.”
“Okay, okay just… okay,” Sam says, that placating tone in his voice indicating that he has Some Opinions and is just trying to keep Dean from going off the deep end.  “But you’re tired, I’m tired. Let’s try again in the morning when—”

“Holy shit,” Dean rasps out, shocked, lost in it.
of it, and aware that it would be so easy to let go of the steering wheel and touch Cas’ hand. Hold it.  If Dean wasn’t a fucking coward he would have done it. It would have felt good. That compulsion to
It was that, more than Cas’ other hand stroking Dean, that did it for him. For a moment, Dean forgot all the fear and doubt, all those treacherous thoughts lurking in the back of his head whispering that this could all be taken away in a snap of fingers. That he didn’t deserve this.  He was being washed away in a tidal swell of sensation, mind emptying out all the danger and uncertainty that waited for Dean outside those four walls, of all the brutal expectations placed on Dean of which he always fell short.  The only part that mattered was that Cas was there, and Dean was as safe as he was ever going to be.
“You turned him into a rabid dog and had him kill your son.”
Maybe the alcohol has loosened his tongue, because Dean spills it all out for Sam—the whole messy truth of it: How Dean started feeling about Cas before he realised what those feelings even meant. The times he and Cas had sex, and how Dean careened them right into a brick wall over it immediately after. About that night in the storage room, and what Cas had said before the Empty took him and how saying it out loud broke open the truth inside Dean, only it was too late. The morning when Dean had tried to move in for a kiss, and how Cas got spooked, took off, and has been freezing Dean out ever since—all leading up to now.
“Not the alligators again, how many times do I have to tell them—” Jack sighs, and with no preamble announces, “I really am sorry, but I am receiving notice of a water park emergency in Heaven and I—” he blinks out of existence.
“Stop.”
Then the demon starts talking.  They always have to do it—can’t ever just shut up about their plans.  “Your brother and the fallen angel will probably be killed when the nexus opens, but Simeon told me to keep you alive for the final sacrifice—the heart of a Winchester.  Hell will bow before their new king and we will return once again to raze the earth!”
“Go team,” Eileen says, and clinks glasses with Dean.
“You were just out,” Cas says, this time that little pissy edge comes across and Dean feels a triumphant jolt.
“Jesus
Rowena, he was taken! He was taken from us, from—” Dean swallows past the thickness in his throat, “from me.”
“No—”
“So, what about you?” she asks, faux-casual because it stinks of Jody and Sam saying
“There you go,” he says and raises his hands up in a shrug.  “Again, I can not stress enough that no part of your soul has been destroyed.  It is right next to you, sleeping in the bed.”  Jack gives him one of those brilliant
yeah okay. Okay, we can do that,
“Probably.  Maybe not though.”  Sam nods to Dean and goes to leave again.
Dean? HA!” And even as a damn
“That’s.. Basically it I suppose,” Jack says, despite sounding discomfited by it.  Must be weird to have so much knowledge, so much power, just to have some guy in a JcPenney Memorial Day Sale flannel try and reduce your cosmic miracle into layman’s terms.
But none of that happened, because Dean, the way he is, was never taught how to move forward as a whole person instead of an assortment of complexes.
a literal
she signs, then pats his chest over his heart.  “Do what feels right.”
It was that, Dean thinks, which broke something open inside of himself—the eagerness of Cas responding to him and how it pulled to the surface all that longing and hunger, all the needing that Dean had been growing in his marrow for so long.
while Cas tilts his head and silently allows this.

“I got it, I got it,” Dean grumbles, making a renewed effort to stay in the right lane instead.
Dean takes a deep breath.  “So, you know, this past year with you gone, I had a lot of time to—to think.  About what’s important to, uh, me. I guess.  We barely hunt anymore, and y’know, we haven’t had an apocalypse in over a year, and I know you’ve probably seen the whole Earth since you’re—yeah.. But
Before Dean can scramble his thoughts together on how the morning turned on him so fast and figure out what to say to fix it, Cas is out of the room and thudding down the stairs, a stunned silence in his wake.
written on the canvas matting.  There’s a waterfall in the background and Claire is pretending to jump off into it while everyone else’s hands are linked, pulling her in the opposite direction.  Behind this, is a 4x6 school picture of Owen against a fireworks backdrop, one of those polite, posed smiles plastered on his face that kids make as the photographer shakes a stuffed animal at them.  Dean doesn’t even need to question why his picture is behind others.  Same reason why he wouldn’t go through the pictures in his phone even when it began chirping with a full memory.  It hurts to look.
Dean gasps out his name, clutching at his chest. He tries to stand, but only ends up brought to his knees, pulling the bedside lamp down in the process.  It smashes to the floor in small, ceramic bits.
Jack’s voice cracks, his lips trembling as tears spill over onto his cheeks.  “I hear you calling out for him.  I can hear your grief.  I wanted so badly to make a world where there was a chance for you to finally find healing and happiness, to make your own choices.  To
“Keep going,” Jody says.  “You’ll get there.”
“God would you—” Dean throws his hands up, grabs Cas by the bicep and walks him away where Sam can’t hear.  “You don’t want to go in there,
He hadn’t known then, but It was the beginning of the end for all of them—right before everything started to go wrong.  Before Michael made another play for Dean’s body, before Jack burned his soul to save them.  Before Mom.  Before Cas walked out of the bunker believing Dean hated him. Before the universe itself began to collapse. A timer had started, and it was counting down to that night in the storage room where Cas says
hurts me,” Cas said, “seeing you like this hurts me.  My Dean would not—”
No. It was better this way.  Safer.
“Dean, you look—” Cas said, then cut himself off and stroked them together harder, faster, slicked with Dean’s sweat, both of them leaking onto one another in Cas’ grip.  He held on to Cas, planting a foot against the mattress and thrusting upward, suddenly two steps ahead and starting to writhe past the rhythm set. The heat and weight of Cas’ dick against Dean’s disappeared, replaced by the pressure of his hand again as he held steady and let Dean fuck up into his fist. Dean could feel himself being watched and shut his eyes against it.  Cas always looked at Dean like he was this incredible gift that Cas had the privilege to touch sometimes, when it was always the other way around. Dean couldn’t stand to see that right now.
“I could mix you up a tonic,” a voice says,  “Help you kip down.  Promise you won’t even dream.”
“That’s the same thing.  And I’ve been to Hell, spent the whole summer having a
before.  I don’t think you have anything to worry about.”
“Thank you for this,” Cas says, and Dean turns to find him sitting at the foot of the bed, his hands in his lap. He smiles.  “You were right, this is.. It feels nice, even if it is strange.”
“Yeah, but you got Eileen back.  You’re all Happily Ever After now.”  A frisson of resentment rolls through Dean.  He’s happy for Sam, is the thing.  Sam is even thinking about getting back into college, starting with a couple online classes and seeing how he feels about it.  His life is course correcting and Dean is grateful, and relieved, and
When he heard footsteps he thought it must be Sammy, coming in to process a day that began with him being tortured by a chick with sensible shoes and a blowtorch, and ended in meeting the mother that died before he was old enough to remember the sound of her voice.  Dean was reeling enough as it was, he couldn’t even imagine how aggressive the whiplash must’ve been for Sammy.
Rowena shrugs. “It’s honest work, you know.  In general, most of the people who are in Hell do
He meets Cas at the bathroom door after they’ve both changed and washed away the bouquet of spaghetti and garlic bread.  Dean doesn’t trust him not to go wandering around the yard if left to his own devices. The few hours of sleep Dean actually manages,
soundtrack or some shite.”
A haunting pulls them back into work.  Ghosts still pop up and pull their crap from time to time.  No matter how much Jack worked to create a stable supernatural balance, human beings are still going to die in ways that are so violent and abrupt, that it continues to echo long after their hearts have stopped beating.

“I—” Dean started, stopped.  “I um.” Cas just waited there, staring at Dean like he was facing a firing squad.  He knew what was coming, knew nothing was going to stop Dean from saying it.  “I just.
“I promise I’m going to tell you this when you’re awake one day—don’t know if I’ll ever be any good at using my words—but I think this is a long time coming,” Dean says, and Cas breathes in, then out, in, and out.  “I’m sorry,” Dean says to his back, “for all of it. I made so many mistakes with you.  Most of the time I knew better and did it anyway. I want you to know that I’m working on that.  If you—if you give me a chance—if you can forgive me for—” Dean sighs when the words stop coming.  “Yeah.. I should really save it for another day.  Let you sleep.”  He pulls the covers up where they’ve slipped down past Cas’ shoulders.  “Good night, Cas.”
Days should come with warning signs, a sort of polite alarm to inform you of the oncoming whiplash. Something to tell you that you’re going to end the day vastly different than how you started it—something better than mushy oats and half-formed plans to go fishing.

but all that passes between his lips is, “Whff,” in a barely audible exhale.
and Dean
Dean groans and lets out a delirious laugh that does nothing to disguise the panic he feels imagining being this heavy for the rest of his life.
Dean interrupts, thinking back to the cold sterility of that bare-faced cement room, “you should have things.  You should—I want you to have things.”
Rowena smiles and returns the gesture, drinks and sets the cup down, but when she looks back up at Dean, her eyes have that look in them again.  “Dean,” she says quietly, “I know what it is you want me to do, and I wish I could help, I really do. Y’know I was fond of the wee angel myself.” She pauses in consideration.  “He was rather fit as well.  A shame that khaki nightmare always covered up his pert little—”
The next thing Dean notices is the silence of the room.  That’s what gives him the most pause.  A sinking feeling in his stomach delivers the worst case scenario that the “detonation” sensation Dean experienced, projected outward into the room and hurt someone.  It’s that fear that gets Dean’s legs underneath himself, struggling to stand.  He pulls himself up by the leg of an overturned table, an oddly unbalanced feeling settling into him, separate from the weakness of his body, as something in his gut gives a hard tug.
Eileen laughs then, “Oh yeah. And if you two have been,”
he says, eyes still averted, “I don’t care—don’t
it’s an insignificant detail, it’s just a goddamn sandwich, but he wants Cas to know that he has paid attention to this stuff over the years.  It’s not insignificant. “I do,” Dean says, looking down at the jars of jelly on the table top and back over to Cas.
The more Dean watched Cas stare at that photograph, the more he suspected Cas already knew this somehow.  The place between his brows creased as he studied it, as if the boy he was seeing was a complete stranger to him, not the same person Cas bore up from Hell and meticulously rebuilt.  He was right, in a way.  This was who Dean was before he learned to be ashamed of himself—a person who might have been unafraid to cross out the distance between them.  The kind of person who would have held Cas’ hand while driving down a dark road toward an uncertain future. Someone who would have sat beside Cas on a park bench to watch the literal birds and bees, just to exist with him in silence.  Dean might have been the loving type.  There could have been a version of himself that would have been good at it.
Cas rolls Dean back underneath his body, licking into his mouth and trembling.
“I’m not talking about the stove.”
Dean gets no such warning.
want thi—”
Sam? The longer he’s gone, the harder it might be to get him back.  You know how easy it is to get lost in those kinds of places!  Time doesn’t move right!  They suck you in, bury you there until you forget who you are.  I can’t—we can’t let that happen to him, Sammy.
Dean didn’t account for that, and goes a little incoherent with it.  He snatches Cas and rolls them until Dean is on top—biting and kissing Cas’ neck, pulling up his shirt over his head and kissing down his chest.  Cas groans and digs his fingers into the hollow of Dean’s hips and starts to push and pull at him.
intense.”
Sammy is talking to Mr. Lowell, the partner of the birdwatcher, kindly nodding and accepting a cup of tea as the man passes it to him with shaking hands.  Dean barely knows what Sam is asking, and from the look of it, his words are barely registering to Mr. Lowell either.  He has a glazed look in his eyes as he flips through the last pictures captured by his husband’s camera, still too shocked to cry, moving automatically.  He doesn’t even flinch at the faint, greyscale image of a 13 year old little girl standing in the distance just past a Wood Thrush foraging on the forest floor.
Sam looks at the ground.  “Alright. Just.. promise that you’ll tell me if you’re thinking about doing something…” he trails off.
and it’s gonna take work, I get that—”
Dean babbled out mindless curses, then Cas’ name when the pressure finally peaked and he started to come.  His final rasping moan seemed distant when Cas went down to lap up those final, dimmer pulses.
Halfway back to the bunker Dean feels it—the first real resonance of something not his own convulse with energy within him, shocking enough to make Dean gasp and slam on breaks and pull over to the margin.
as soon as he was gone, that he didn’t mean it, he never meant it.  There’s just something wrong with Dean that when he’s angry and wounded it can’t just stay contained, the hurt explodes out of him and infects anyone that stands too close.
The clock in the corner of the room ticks away.  Crickets chirp loud and erratic outside the window.  There’s a dull throbbing in Dean’s chest, and he’s working up his courage to say something about it.
It wasn’t long before it cycled to night and everyone began leaving the main areas, headed toward bed. Dean had waited, pacing the threshold with the door cracked, watching and listening for the right footsteps to pass by.  It wasn’t going to be impulsive like last time and Dean had about five minutes to come to terms with that.  This was a deliberate, premeditated choice he was about to make—one of the first since he’d made since saying yes to Michael.  One of the first choices he would make, after being robbed of the ability to do so.  His hands were shaking, nervous and jittery, but those minutes came and passed and Dean still hadn’t found any reasons imperative enough to change his mind—and then Cas was right outside his door.
sense Castiel, or the shape of him, his edges.”  Jack’s shoulders droop and he slowly opens his eyes again. “But then it is gone, and I—then I realise I am just feeling his presence as it lives through you.”
you would never have done that.”
Dean smooths his hands over the wrinkles in the sheets, over the pillow, not hard enough to press them away.  Each indent in the fabric seems massively important, an artifact confirming Cas was ever here at all, and if he destroys it, then Dean will have to admit that Cas is gone. All the way gone.  He’s seen this dozens of times—a grieving family unable to bring themselves to pack away their loved one’s belongings, a room that once was ordinary and familiar turned into a sort of shrine that they enter in order to feel closer to the person they lost.  But Cas, he didn’t have much of anything.  He’d been alive since before the world began but had so little to his name—some shirts and slacks, suit pieces and ties, the coat he was so attached to.  He must have had his fake little FBI badge on him whenever he—when it took him—because it’s gone from the spot on the nightstand where he kept it.  The walls are blank and sterile, there’s nothing to show he lived here, nothing to indicate Cas’ interests and passions were as rich as they were.  There’s nothing here but empty hangers.
“Who cares, we’re the only ones on it!” Dean says, gesturing toward the winding expanse of empty highway in front of them.
“Yeah.. yeah okay,” Sam rubs the back of his neck. “Look, Dean you can
“Cas?”
Dean propped himself up on one elbow to watch, the other hand reaching down to bury itself in Cas’ hair.  It was almost too much to take in—the sound and sight of him doing that to Dean—wet lips, the occasional pink glimpse of his tongue, his low, choked moans.  The dark shock of his hair bobbing between Dean’s legs. It was hard to reconcile this image to the knowledge that this was
“Demonstrably untrue.”
“When did you get that?” Dean pants out as Cas adjusts Dean’s legs, opens them wider.
It’s a moment before Jody says anything.  “That doesn’t change,” she says, “what you’re feeling this second, you’ll still feel it another year from now. Ten years from now.”
instead of in

“This is…” he opens his mouth, closes it and raises his eyebrows.  “I don’t know what this is.”

“Cas, I am
“You guys take our room,” Kaia says, sidling up next to Dean and Cas as they watch Jody walk Alex to her car. “Claire and I can use the blow up mattress.”
Doesn’t take Columbo to reckon something horrible happened to that kid out there in those woods, and now ten years worth of negative energy festering over the injustice of a life cut short—she’s begun reaching out.  Can’t tell the difference between friend or foe, maybe never knew who killed her to begin with and so she’s taking anyone who disturbs her death site. She probably is just desperate to inflict the same kind of pain she’s reliving for all these years, making other people suffer as she does. That’s the depressing thing about ghosts—how so many of them start as innocent victims themselves, but in the end all that’s left is the terror and rage.  A grim facsimile of a person who was once loved and missed.
Claire opens her mouth, then closes it, and Dean begins to wonder if she’s ever had a vacation that she was old enough to remember either.  “Beaches and stuff, I don’t know! Catch a crab? Climb a mountain and turn around!”  She snaps her fingers a few times,  “What is it—DisneyLand? Disney...World? Whatever. I heard there’s a museum in Iceland that has over 200 penises preserved in formaldehyde.  It’s a museum for
alright? We’ll get around to those things when my legs are working again.”
“And nothing,” Claire says, incredulous, “they are
“Never even seen it
to me, you won’t—” he pauses and seems to be choosing his words carefully, “you can’t tell me anything that will—and I won’t think any—” Sam sighs.  “You’re my brother.  I love you and I’m here for you.  Nothing you could say would change that.”
The only thing Dean grimaced at was the old cuckoo clock Cas found in an antique shop and had immediately become enamoured with.  It’s carved from walnut with intricate maple leaves decorating the house facing, and  Dean is absolutely going to shoot that thing by accident.  Which would blow because shit wasn’t cheap.  Every time the damn bird emerges to raise hell in it’s melodious little voice, Dean jumps.
“Do it again,” Dean demands, already reaching for the knife to put a fresh cut in his hand now that the old one has gone all sticky and clotted over.
He hears Sam’s terrified shouting and Dean thinks
Maybe it was simply because of who was doing it.
“Deep breath,” Sam commands, “come on man, you can do it,” and Dean inhales painfully, but manages to let it out with some control.  “Again.”
When Cas bottoms out, Dean grasps desperately at him, overwhelmed, holding Cas still with his arms banded across the broad expanse of his back. They’re so close, so completely intertwined, everything is being shared across the bridge between their soul.  “Can you feel that?” Dean breathes.
“Is that your professional opinion or—”
she signs, then thumps him in the middle of the forehead,
and just ignore whatever Sodom and Gomorrah bullshit they’re praying about.”

“He looks like he just found out that there’s no Santa.”
If Dean was a better man he wouldn’t be putting Sammy through this for the hundredth time—sneaking out at night to bars, getting drunk and belligerent and starting a brawl with the gnarliest pick of the litter, because he wants to get hurt. Aside from the obvious reasons why this isn’t a thing stable people do, it’s also deeply embarrassing having his kid brother appear behind his shoulder while Dean is busy talking shit to a meathead twice his size.  It’s not a good look, him dragging Dean out by the collar, bitching the whole time as he seatbelts Dean into the car, mouth a thin, tight line before he finally says something that’ll put Dean’s tail between his knees.
on a vacation?  Like, you do realise there’s a whole world out there with cool shit to do in it, right?”
“Me too,” Dean said quietly, balling his hand into a fist, and setting it on top of Cas’ knee.
He sounds a little impressed, sort of taken aback, and Dean
“Oh,” Cas said in a knowing way that made it clear he had no idea what Dean meant by it.  “There’s no need to thank me.  You know I dislike seeing you in pain.”
“I loved her.  I would have spent the rest of my life with her. Then she died because of me—”
Dean grumbles to the clump of wires he’s disemboweled from the back of the stove. He knows he would have responded the wrong way—sabotaged it the way he does every good thing.  Feels better to complain though.  Dean was always the best at the anger portion of the grieving process.
“Fjarðarheiði,” Cas pronounces flawlessly.  At least Dean thinks he does.  Cas speaks all the languages so Dean just assumes.
So now
like those quiet, choked sounds that Cas tried and failed to keep in check and how Dean was being allowed to hear it.  He shook apart right there with his cheek pressed to the wall, groaning and coming so hard that he would have fallen if it hadn’t been for Cas holding him up. Before Dean was even finished twitching out the aftershocks, the warmth of Cas’ palms abruptly left, the pressure of fingertips returning to Dean’s hips as he held him in place and pulled Dean back and back and back against him, rubbing himself against space between Dean’s thighs until Cas plastered himself to Dean’s back, exhaling raggedly before going still.
He sees Sam’s back first and feels a little pissy that he’s over there examining—what—the grout job??  Rather than checking on his brother who just spazzed out on the floor like a dying fish.  Then he sees Eileen, and Jack—all there, all staring at the same spot on the floor.
“Dean, I’m not trying to be harsh,” Sam says, grimacing slightly, “but for him, the last time the topic was even close to being broached, was after you two—” he makes a vague motion with his hands, a sort of patty-cake.
“He was working under the impression that you’re basically down to scratch an itch, but that’s as deep as it goes. Maybe after last time, he promised himself he wouldn’t put himself through that again.  I mean, I’m making a lot of assumptions here but.. That’s where my mind would go if it were me. And the way you said it, he had convinced himself that you would never feel the same.  And now he’s carrying a part of your soul, so he’s being constantly reminded of all of this while you’re still there making eyes at him like you have the past few
it,” Cas breathes against Dean’s neck, “but I—I didn’t know what it was you were broadcasting.  I thought I was reading what I wanted into it, and I didn’t think you’d ever let yourself—or if I would ever be an acceptable—” he says, voice faltering in the middle, uncharacteristically unable to articulate, but Dean understands.  There’s so much history, so much leading into this, where do either one of them begin other than right here?
never made it to Dean’s lips.  He was already too close and he wanted it too much.
Dean nestles in behind him—nothing too presumptuous, just his chest to Cas’ back, giving the curve of his body a warm place to settle.  He rests his forehead against the nape of Cas’ neck, puts one arm around him to grab back the hand he lost.
“Of course,” Cas said in monotone.
right?  I mean, this is how it’s supposed to be I think? That’s what Jody keeps trying to tell me.  You have all those dreams when you’re a kid, of growing up and doing something you love. I think people like us, we stop being kids so early that we forget to dream like that anymore.  Hunting becomes our life, and yeah, sometimes it feels good.  Felt good to save people.  But it also.. hurt?  All that surviving, I mean.  After a while it sort of fucks you up.  I don’t know if I want to be your age and still feel the whole weight of that.  I don’t want it to keep me from loving people the way I should because the whole time I’m waiting to lose them, or for me to screw it all up when it turns me mean.”  She winces. “Sorry.”
“Try not doing that.”
Sam walks in from around the corner dressed down in his jogging clothes—must mean dawn is about to break.  Fucking great.  He doesn’t say anything for a minute, just pauses when he sees Dean, before coming to sit across from him.  “Little early, don’t you think?” he asks, then doesn’t wait for an answer and pours himself a single.  He looks down into the glass and takes a sip.  “So… um. Boy trouble?”
Sam sits there and listens to all of it, his face only twinging when Dean overshares about the sex.  When Dean finishes Sam nods and sets his glass on the table.
That silence had been like nothing else Dean has ever experienced.  It wasn’t awkwardness or anger or even uncertainty.  It was the surreal silence of shell-shock.  Neither one of them knew what to do or how to act.
“Hell no,” Claire scoffs, “Kaia is looking into some grants and Tulane has a good nursing program, Alex knows people there.  It’s
Sam goes silent. Stops gesticulating.
Dean swallows down an instinct to just say
Cas came around and looked down as Dean patted the empty space next to him on the floor. When he sat, Dean cracked open another beer and passed it over to Cas, turned his eyes away when Cas let his posture mimic Dean’s, head thunking back against the cabinets as he brought the bottle to his mouth.  They sat there in silence for the longest time, shoulder to shoulder, the heat between them sharp and distracting, but endured the way it had been since the last time.
Cas stares a moment longer, then shakes off a tremor.  “I’ll be fine.”
“Is that a bad thing?” Dean asked, a little nervous for the answer.
Dean doesn’t care.  Dude is starfished across him, leg inches away from the morning wood situation, and there’s no inner crisis of whether or not Dean’s allowed to like it.
He’d let Cas borrow it, years ago, for that small window of time where he was human, or some precarious mix of human and slipshod grace.  Cas had come to them with that grateful but beat to hell look in his eyes, his few belongings stuffed into a plastic bag, and when he’d turned up in the study still wet from a shower with only a towel slung around his hips—
The loss of Cas is a fracture in his soul that Dean hauls around, with no way of ever healing it.  He’s stopped really wanting to anymore.  It’s all Dean has left of him now.
Other than that, Dean’s best relationship was with an imaginary nurse from a Djinn induced fever dream, and teenage puppy love—again, short-lived and only halfway honest.
“I always say the wrong thing.”
Problem is, when Dean imagined true freedom, he always thought Cas would be there to see it. Experience it. More than any of them, Cas never even got a chance to labour under the delusion that he had been given free will because he wasn’t
“What
“Fine, fine.  Uncle Dean has a ring to it though,” he says, even though it’s hard to imagine any one of them being fit to raise kids, not ate up with trauma the way they are.  They’re barely fit for society.  “Hey, Eileen..” Dean says, then signs

The oven crapped out yesterday while Sam was making that quinoa salad he’s started meal-prepping with, and while Dean is grateful that it meant they would eat take out for dinner instead, he
If this was happening under different circumstances, if Dean was the kind of person who could admit in daylight what he did with Castiel in the dark, he would have put on a sly grin and told him it was a bold gamble. Probably would’ve teased and told him to work harder to convince him just because Dean knows Cas really puts his back into it when he gets focused on something—does all the research, pays attention to the details.  He’d probably be a goddamn wonder in the sack if he went in for anything more than demon delinquents, reapers for hire, and fuck-up humans with undiagnosed clinical depression and anger management issues.
“Yeah.”
“Just—” Cas pants out, pressing a shaky kiss to the top knob of Dean’s spine, “a little—more.”  His thumbs dig into Dean’s hips, rearing up from where he was moulded over Dean’s back and up onto his knees, pulling Dean with him.  Scrambling, Dean braces his hands on the mattress, surprised he’s getting his knees and back to even cooperate into this position—the dull throb of old joints and the ragged pull of oxygen into his lungs barely feels any different from pleasure at this point. Everything feels good.
Cas.  You always try so hard to do the right thing, and you’re kind and—and gentle, nothing like me, and I have done nothing but give you grief over it. If I was a better man I’d figure a way to get you free of me so you could find someone who would treat you the way you deserve, who wouldn’t fuck up the way I know I’m gonna fuck up.  But I want to
“Do you remember much from there?” Dean asks, then thinks better of it, “You don’t have to talk about it.”
Cas sits up, faces away from Dean with his feet off the side of the bed, and the feeling is lost.  “I must have moved in my sleep. Thank you for—” he makes a vague gesture back down toward the bed.  “Sorry if I—”
“—for the second time, and for the second time you told him that it was a mistake. He’s still back
lip-bruising kiss that had obsessively preoccupied Dean’s thoughts ever since he saw Cas lay one on Meg in that filthy fucking corridor—but still. Then it clicked that it was
She narrows her eyes, thwacks Dean on the shoulder.
The knot at the middle of Dean undoes itself, but the whole rest of Dean freezes in place.  Aside from the steady pulse of his heart, and the soft in and out of breath, all is still.
“I’ve got to go,” Jack blurts, and with a displacement of air he’s gone.
all the time.  So he kept grabbing, and taking, and the way Cas pushed back with his own searching hands, it took the pain off that indefinable sharp edge. Maybe Cas was searching for relief from all the aching he did for Dean as well, and that’s why he let it happen, even knowing how it would end.
Dean yanks his hands away, uncomfortable and embarrassed and
Cas opens his mouth, his expression still annoyed like he’s caught on the former tangent, but then Dean’s words seem to compute and his teeth click shut.  He shakes his head a little in confusion.  “What?”
Sam repeats, “and I died too, in a way. I can’t ever get that part of me back.  I had to become someone new, and it was hard, it was
“I can feel it, I’ve
Eileen sits at one end of the table, yawning. The whole house still has nightmares, even Eileen who stays over more and more these days, who Dean can sometimes pacing another hall over. Every now and then she’ll give it up and come hang out with Dean, share a 2a.m. carb overload, teach him how to sign dirty words since they don’t exactly put those in the youtube tutorials Dean has been watching.  Eileen works up at the high school teaching A.P. History. Turns out she has a master’s in Folklore and Mythology with a focus in Celtic lore.  It hadn’t necessarily been about a passion for the topic, but a need to understand what destroyed her family.  Maybe that’s why she shrugs and says it doesn’t bother her working for public high school teachers’ wage in Kansas, when she could be doing research for some badass institute somewhere.
“Hey uh—” Sam clears his throat and Dean turns to see him leaning against the doorway, “you need help?
The first time it happened—Dean doesn’t know when precisely—somewhere in those three months of Cas being human.  After Gas Station Steve, before the Gadreel exorcism.
“No, I—”
Dean pours himself a whiskey, tosses it back, pours another.  The sharp throb in his chest doesn’t let up the slightest.
“The fuck—” Dean rasps out, “is that supposed to help?”
because I didn’t—didn’t know how to
Shouldn’t be hard to admit it in the safety of Dean’s own godforsaken head, but it is, and it has been ever since it happened.
or whatever,” Claire says, eyes rolling.  “Plus you’re like, 50 years old, how much do you think your back can take? That sofa isn’t exactly a Tempur Pedic.”
Dean thinks, and,“Cas!” Dean shouts, scrambling to his feet, reaching out in front of himself toward the sound and finding mostly solid walls of rock.  There’s a loud bellow, a brief flicker of light ahead that illuminates the shape of Cas crouching over a body almost twice his size, and Dean stumbles toward it.  His feet eventually make contact with something softer than rocks after a few yards, and Dean falls to his knees, his hands blindly feeling for Cas.  “Are you okay?  Cas!  Are you okay?”
Dean lets his head swivel toward Sam, “Seriously?”
might find it—” he searches for a word, “

“I mean you’re right. It’s Cas. We have to keep trying.  Whatever it takes.”
nerves leaping in his chest, scratching his head with the butt of his wrist.  The backstrap of the gun clacks against his forehead.  “Oh shit, sorry about—” he does a funny gesture with the gun and finally puts it back under the pillow, “old habits you know.”  Jack doesn’t say anything, doesn’t move a centimetre and doesn’t make eye-contact with Dean.
Cas cocks his head. “This is important to you.”  A statement of fact. Dean swallows.
Cas had turned and given him. Dean didn’t have a name for whatever that look was, mixed up of everything and not any one thing.
Dean though, the black-eyed one Cas was meeting with, felt no need to be fixed and resented Cas for believing different.  If only he
Sometimes people need that, Dean thinks, and maybe that’s okay.
all low and fucked up with desperation.
“Well, you see, both trauma and fungus are everywhere, both spread so easily..  You can’t always visualise it as it happens—well, you can technically see fungus spreading.  The spores themselves are microscopic. Unless you’re an angel or nature spirit, you would need to be carrying a microscope with you in order to—”
Dean’s hand at the small of Cas’ back as he got around him to the fridge.
“When what?” Dean half-shouts again. throwing his hands in the air then letting them fall to grip hard at the edge of the tabe, “when
“I promise I’m not mad, I just—” Dean sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.  “Look, I can’t make you do anything, but I need rest.
Hands roving, bodies straining together, Dean squeaks out a, “W—wow—,” and is immediately muffled by Cas’ eager mouth. “Really?  You’re letting me off the hook that ea
“Do it,” Dean bit out against Cas’ cheek, the words skittering over his ear when Cas shuddered and thrust against him again.  “C’mon just
,” kiss, “is just a means to an end for you.” He took himself in hand and rubbed the head of dick against Dean’s hole, hot and wet and perfect, before moving back to the inside of Dean’s thigh. Dean was caught between pulling Cas back in, or else squirming away to eliminate the possibility.  Cas was right, Dean wasn’t sure what he wanted, but he was just going to suppress that voice of indecision and deal with it later.
“Dean, we need to—” Cas freezes just inside the kitchen and Dean freezes with a burned panini dangling between his thumb and forefinger.  They stare at each other for a moment.  A blob of melted peanut butter falls onto the floor with an lacklustre splat.  “What are you doing?” Cas asks, now eyeing the plates of sandwiches everywhere like they’re landmines.
Cas had already crawled back, it had barely been an hour and Dean already needed to take the edge off that heated, prickling sensation in his blood. They’d done a whole hell of a lot more to each other’s bodies, a little brush of hands would have been nothing.
family
Dean finishes, shrill at the end when Cas’ fingers dip below the waistband of the front of Dean’s jeans, barely brushing over the tip of his cock. Dean fumbles backward to get his hands on the ledge of the table, head tipping back on a groan when Cas’ fingertips push down farther, thumb petting over the fraenulum.  They both shudder.
It’s the same as ever—books, an assortment of bunker storage overflow on the shelf.  Dean opens the books one by one to see if Cas might have left something between the pages—a letter, a note saying good-bye, anything.  Dean doesn’t know why he’d set himself up for disappointment like that, it’s not really something Cas would have done.  What possibly could have been left to say that would have made any difference?  As it was, Cas had already resigned himself to silence up until the moment where they were out of options.
“..the hell.”
“Then you know that
Of course he would.  Of course Cas would be a cuddler.  It’s probably the least surprising realisation Dean has ever had.
policy. No more unnecessary drama—keeping to what we’re good at.”
Eventually Cas stopped trying to talk, but kept up an effort to gentle Dean with his hands, calm him down from this turned out state, and that wasn’t what Dean needed either.  He was too panicked for that, too mangled and distorted on the inside, and he was desperate to be seen, to be recognised.
“...I think.”
Cas examined the metal shelf.
Dean doesn’t remember their argument, only that it happened, and how sometimes he can still hear those not-quite-a-joke comments echoing in his dad’s voice when Dean fails to be anything less than what he was told a man should be.  It all started there on those sandy dunes, a small seed planted that whispered Dean wasn’t enough—an idea that would spread over time, its roots coiling around and smothering away the person he might have been.
is that normal?”
“Oh please, don’t tell me you’re holding out for Original Flavour Dean.  He’d be the first round draft pick for a closet competition, you’re wasting your time.  Now me, I don’t have those hang-ups anymore. I’d be happy to prove it.”
“It’s okay, it’s gonna be okay,” Sam says over and over again, even though it’s not okay and it never will be again.  The world might be fixed, but Dean is still the same old fucked up.
Sam has already been up a couple hours at this point, going for his morning jog, then working through an online course he picked up through KU.  Doesn’t seem interested in going back where he left off at Stanford, said that the prestige didn’t matter to him anymore, that he doesn’t have anything left to prove, and he never liked Cali to begin with.
He touches it with his fingers and the tips come away stained red.  “Oh,” Cas says, and
“Alright.”  Sort of a relief.  Sort of not.  “So, what
brushing their shoulders together and smiling instead of doing the Deer In The Headlights routine, probably high for the first time in his existence—everything felt golden.  The excess of dopamine being poured into their brains blocked the sharp throbbing of injuries, until all that was left was Cas’ laugh and the sense of triumph Dean felt that he was making Cas smile at him for the first time in months.
or whatever it is—”
“Dean, what are we doing here?” Cas asks, shutting the car door and looking up and down at the small shops lining the road.  He’s dressed in the usual Tax Accountant Midnight Special, cheap black suit and tie askew. Looks weird seeing it without the coat, actually.  Empty might have given up the ghost, but it sure did keep the Burberry.
of that. But come on— don’t you want to find something that’s just yours?”
what do you mean
and not know anything anymore.
“You still don’t trust—”
He breathes, and breathes, and breathes.
“Anytime,” Dean cuts in, a little too eager, and Cas jerks his chin down to look at him, brows knitted together, holding Dean’s gaze like he’s trying to find an answer there. “I don’t mind,” Dean says, propping himself up on his hands and leaning over back in Cas’ space. Anticipation thrills down Dean’s spine, settles sharp and hot in his chest.  The only way Dean knows it’s something beyond his own restless heart, is the sympathetic shiver that goes through Cas as his eyes flick down to Dean’s mouth, and back up again.  Dean licks his lips and leans in closer.
Dean wakes in the morning to the smell of bacon and coffee, the sound of Sam laughing downstairs, daylight streaming between the gaps in the curtains and warming his skin. Before he opens his eyes, he registers a weight across his chest and abdomen.  Slowly, careful not to disturb, Dean cranes his neck and looks down at his body.
It would be irrational, considering their current bifurcated state, to say what Dean is really thinking.
I want to sit down and do nothing with you.  I just want..” Dean almost says a dozen different things, but it all focuses down to one word, “you.”
“Best sleep I’ve gotten in a year,” Dean admits because it’s true. There’s no ache in his chest, metaphorical or actual—the bond between their souls hums contentedly at having it’s other half so close.
mean it like that?  He knew how it sounded and felt a horrible reflex to qualify it when one of the nurses gave him a raised brow, but he swallowed the impulse down and said it again.  “We’re partners."
“Jack is with him!” Sam calls after, but Dean is already there and throwing open the door to the room.  He stands there half in, half out, one arm still on the handle, the other hand flattened to the wall outside of the door frame.  He knows he must look pretty shit, still sweaty and pale-faced from his trip to the convenience store, panting in the doorway like a fucked up Kool Aid Man.
Dean hadn’t known how to respond to it.  What was he supposed to do with that?  He didn’t understand what he’d done to earn that sort of devotion—just knew he’d do anything not to lose it, and he kept pulling Cas back to himself even when he shouldn’t have. Even when it probably hurt.  Could never just leave him be.
“Temporarily?”
those lives he didn’t save—it’s because I’m the
It’s after noon and Dean is in the kitchen. This isn’t an unusual place for him to be at this time, but the fare certainly isn’t typical.  Strewn about the table are jars of peanut butter and jelly, some opened, some closed and set aside.  He has a skillet going and the panini press—isn’t even sure how a panini press ended up here to begin with.  Dean actually thought it was a George Foreman, either way those straight little grill marks are oddly satisfying.
much of a geezer.  You’re never too old to
It was just Cas, who he was as a person, and something in Dean responded so forcefully to it, that the only thing Dean knew how to be was terrified of the feeling.   All of that tension, all their time together, and the multitude of opportunities that could so easily have become realities—still Dean only slipped twice.
“Jack.”
Sam is sitting in the parlor when Dean careens into the bunker, mouth opening to announce what Dean already knows, so Dean shouts, “I know!” and skids around the corner, rubber soles of his boots squeaking.
Dean doesn’t have anything to say to that.  All the raging he did earlier now flickers incipient and dull at the center of his chest. “So.. how
God.  He wanted more of him.  Wanted to get his hands down the front of those scrubs and curl his fingers around Cas’ dick.  Wanted to taste him, turn over under Cas’ hands and let his fingers wander.  It was shocking to have those desires so close to the surface.  Dean just wanted and wanted, and wanted things he had barely allowed himself to admit for so many stupid fucking reasons.  Old, smothered fantasies—ones he’d held captive save for moments of weakness when he was awake in bed, too tired to lie to himself—about what he’d do to Cas if this ever happened, all congealing toward one objective:
Dean says, wanting it too badly to engineer any wit into his response.
Dean closes the door to the library, pours himself too much scotch, sits back down at the table and thumbs through another dust covered tome for the answers he knows he won’t find there.  His brain is sluggish and everything looks like nothing when he tries to read, but his body is still keyed up—jittery and nauseous from too much coffee and barely any calories.
fuck Dean into the mattress.
Honestly, he’s kind of into that part.
“I’m not—hygiene or—”
Sam had left the room to tend to whatever buckwild thing was happening outside of it, and left Cas alone to keep watch over Dean.  Cas stood outside the trap, concern etched into every line on his face.  Any other time, Dean quietly revelled in it, Cas’ attention was addictive.  The way Cas wanted to save him all the time could almost make Dean believe he was worth the trouble it took.
“Cas?” Dean asks quietly—then the world tilts sideways.
“Yeah?” Dean asks, head already buzzing from the anticipation.
“Fine,” Cas sighs, but Dean sees the pleased set of his expression as he walks off down the hall.
Sam is finding ways to move forward, while Dean creates his own purgatory and lives in it every single moment of the day and sees no future beyond it.
“Would you feel the same way if I weren’t carrying a piece of your soul?”
Orzan wraps it up a curt nod, before scanning everyone in the room, his eyes landing on Cas.
“I know, damn demon clobbered me with a rock or something,” Dean explains while Cas carefully cuts through the rope binding his wrists.  Cas’ mouth tightens into a line when he finds rope burn abrading the skin there. “Just a scratch, doesn’t even hurt.” Not in comparison to the bump on his head at least.
“What you’re describing is—wait,” Eileen pauses, then signs slowly so Dean catches it all:
“Yeah.”
“The one whose memory of your relationship was erased?”
“Shut up, Dean,” Cas says gently, taking Dean by the hand and leading him out of the kitchen.
would feel, except Dean is both camel and needle in the scenario and it’s all just a mad ouroboros in there.  It jolts through Dean in waves, subsiding and fooling Dean into thinking
“Sleep okay?” Dean asks, before Cas can assume the worst and pull away.
“Okay no, let me try to—okay.”  Dean’s shoulders slouch into a sigh and he pinches the bridge of his nose, rethinking everything.  “I thought this was—I wanted you to know that I know you.  And how you feel about things matters to me.  Matters a lot.  Even dumb stuff like,” he flings an arm at the mess he’s made, “food preferences.”
“You do see how that’s worse, right?”
Cas didn’t even flinch, he just sighed and said to the ceiling, “Don’t you think I know that?” then rolled off the bed, got dressed, and left Dean there with himself.
“No,” Jack finally says, “not that.”
Claire snorts, “Dean. I live in
“That you aren’t,” she says, “you’ll think back to this conversation and how I told you it would happen, and you’ll remember that grief, like love, connects us.”  She pauses for a moment while Dean tries to make that sink in. “Gets awful gloomy upstairs on those hurting days though, I know from experience. It’s hard to see through to the next moment where loss stops feeling like an enemy.”
“Gross. No. Toothbrush spit swapping isn’t the same as—” Dean suppresses a shudder when a sense memory of Cas’ wet mouth against his own pops into existence, “Second of all—yeah,” his train of thought still hung up on the previous mental note.  “You don’t have to
“Oh,” Dean says, suddenly understanding and feeling like an asshole for not understanding sooner.  “Cas that’s… that’s okay.  We can leave the lamp on.”
“And I’m not spending another night playing soul tug o’ war, we’re going to
this anymore,” Cas says, and in two strides he’s in Dean’s space, one hand clasped over the nape of Dean’s neck as he pulls him down into a kiss.
“You’re gonna regret saying that,” Dean informs him, matter of fact.
Neither Sam nor Dean seem to have the energy to even speculate further on this.  Upside: Water park in heaven.  Downside: Potentially infested with gators.
“Come on Roma Downey,
Cas stirs in bed and everyone quiets. A nervous chill runs down Dean’s spine when he shifts, body curving toward Dean, but he doesn’t open his eyes.  Disappointment and relief clamour for top spot in Dean’s chest.  He has spent the last year wanting nothing more than for Cas to look at him. Funny how you miss something like that—the certain way someone sees you.  The last time Dean had Cas’ eyes on him, the moment had been filled with fear and panic, which had given way to a very different fear and panic. Cas had been crying. Dean can’t get that image out of his head.
Zero to sixty, just like that.
“Mh.”  Okay.  Guess morning small-talk isn’t on the menu unless Dean wants to hear about the interpretations of constitutional law.  “I was thinking about driving to the lake la—”
Later Dean would tell himself that it wasn’t a lie.  It didn’t have to be Cas—whatever he was going through that night could have been resolved by someone else. It could have been anyone.  But there wasn’t anyone else who saw Dean the way Cas did.  It was only ever him.  But the threat seemed to work because Cas’ eyes narrowed, and with a growl he yanked Dean in by the hair, kissed him rough and messy, pushed his back off the wall and began crowding Dean toward the bed.  Dean doesn’t know how his clothes came off so fast, he barely remembers unbuttoning and getting his fly down as Cas tore into his shirt and toppled him onto his back.
In the dream, Dean is less than a ghost, stuck in an off-centre point of view, watching it all happen—helpless to stop those words from coming out of his mouth.  Helpless in making Cas stay no matter how hard he fights to find a voice to scream it into existence and make Cas hear him.
it’s just
and I apologised!
Donna nudges Dean and starts asking him about a transmission problem in her new Jeep before Dean can start broadcasting fucking Marvin Gaye across whatever metaphysical FM radio wave their conjoined soul exists on.
