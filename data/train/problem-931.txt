“Sherlock,” John said, righting his clothes and moving forward in the chair to cup his face in the palms of his hands. “It’s okay.”
“Okay?” He was asking permission one final time. Sherlock nodded and John didn’t hesitate, he pulled and exposed all of Sherlock to the warm, honey-thickened air of the room.
Sherlock watched as John raised a hand in a halting gesture, his eyes sliding shut with tension. “Just to be clear, I’m not now, nor will I ever, seek your approval. And this plan to uproot Sherlock’s life is shit.”
No matter how down he’d been feeling as of late, seeing this movement, this happy, free movement erupting with such joy from the dancers made John smile. He couldn’t help himself, it was a fantastic sight to behold.
His mother smiled at him, indulgent as always. He figured he’d given her both an answer she was happy to hear and an appropriate response to whatever question he’d been asked. Afternoon tea continued without any other daydreaming incidents.
She tapped on the door with what sounded like the tips of her nails and then the room fell silent; Mrs H had left as quickly as she'd come. John buried his head in Sherlock's hair and chuckled. There was simply no other way to respond to what had just happened.
Sarah, the (somewhat frazzled) assistant, nodded at Mr Baynes' request, and scribbled the addition in her ever-present notebook. Sherlock scowled, holding onto Molly with a fierce grip and an unspoken plea,
They ran through the first three movements with surprisingly little interruption, Mr Baynes only stopping to make changes or alter positioning when absolutely necessary. John would make notes when needed, feeling certain parts of the written music were static to his ears and required a little push here and there. Now that they were in the theater where the performances would be held, things would naturally have to be tweaked, since the rehearsal studios were never an exact replica of the stage, and John figured the music should be no exception.
The morning after opening night found Sherlock staring blindly at the plaster ceiling above him, eyes unfocused, thoughts racing. He had not slept, his mind never ceasing in its insistent review of the evening’s performance and the events that followed. He couldn't stop assessing where things had gone right, where they’d gone wrong, variables that couldn’t be controlled vs. the inevitable hiccups that came with the first night of any production.
As always, thank you for reading. Please leave me a comment (even if it's a shouting howler of a comment, I understand) or some kudos love if you feel so inclined. :)
If you'd like to see some images of the dancers I've mentioned in this chapter I've created a tumblr post here:
, was something Sherlock never wanted to experience again. He’d texted Mycroft telling him as much at the end of the second week and suspected that the next time the company toured, John would be in attendance.
Sherlock starred openly at John, brazen and hungry. He wanted to reach out and pull the red, fabric knot free from John’s throat, exposing his skin to Sherlock’s mouth. He wanted to drag that white t-shirt off his muscled arms, licking stripes of ownership along every tendon. He wanted to kneel before John in supplication, allowing John to use him as he saw fit. Sherlock ached with the overwhelming need of wanting the man who sat ten feet away and simultaneously an ocean’s divide from him.
Those hands were currently digging into the skin at Sherlock’s back, dragging along his ass and pressing his hips further into John’s own, creating a rhythm for them both. It was brilliant and perfect and so completely not enough that Sherlock whined at the injustice of it all. Why on earth had he started this now? At the beginning of the day, a full dress rehearsal day, at that. He didn’t want to open his eyes to his reality, he wanted to keep them closed and filled with the images of John’s hands playing him like his favorite keys.
“Because. I’m a helpless romantic and I like happy endings. Almost as much as I like seeing pretty boys kiss.” She winked, patted the pocket of her satchel where her phone sat, and pushed off the piano, striding to the front of the room to join Greg. John was left behind with a tepid cup of tea in his hands and an uneasy sense of companionship settling in his stomach. He was very much looking forward to the end the day and something stronger than tea to quell his nerves.
A fingertip brushed the small point of hair at the nape of John’s neck, tracing the same line the bead of sweat blazed before it, and every muscle in John’s back arched towards the touch. His skin flared to life under that small, singular sensation. Another finger joined the first, then another, then another, until the entirety of Sherlock’s hand splayed out into the wet hairs at the back of John’s head and pushed upwards to his crown.
John was shoving him towards the shower with rough hands on his overly sensitive skin. He'd leave bruises if he wasn't more careful. Sherlock realised that he wanted him to and he sagged at the contact, willing John to manhandle him all the more. Sherlock basked in the attention, even as his stomach growled with a nagging and inconvenient hunger.
She didn’t explain any further, but simply shook her head and walked out of the studio. Sherlock starred after her, blinking hard. If he were a computer, this would be the part where he’d short circuit and smoke would start to pour out of his ears, John thought before the rest of what Irene had just said came flooding back to him.
The rating has been raised for this chapter due to strong language and some suggestive imagery. (Oooo!)
The flash of a memory to an hour before on Floral street crossed Sherlock’s mind. Warm lips forming into an inviting smile. Broad shoulders and soft, blonde hair. The boy who was both charmingly humble and surprisingly confident staring back at him when no one else ever bothered looking. Sherlock wondering what it would be like to be someone’s friend . . .
I owe a great deal of gratitude to @Nottoolateforthegame and @MandaPanda8 for their help in beta'ing/encouragement with this chapter. Thank you, ladies.
Thank you to @nottoolateforthegame for being a wonderful beta, and a special thanks to @lediona25 for extra hand-holding and encouragement while I struggled to get this chapter out to you. I hope it was worth the wait. *bites nails*
He decided soon after the end of John’s second full week in the studio, when his position became reluctantly permanent, that Sherlock would ignore the strange man with the funny glasses and the plaid button-downs. It was the only option that allowed Sherlock to focus, even if John insisted on being cordial, considerate, surprisingly competent at his job, and always visible the mirror whenever Sherlock looked up towards his own reflection.
“You. Your very existence. John Hamish Watson - The Fucking Troubadour. You sat down at that piano bench back in June and fucked everything up.”
I've given up pretending that this story has anything less than five parts to it - hence the deletion of the completed chapter number. I'm 99% sure that it's five but just in case it isn't, I left the final chapter tally open. I hope that doesn't upset the few of you who have been sweet and generous with your time and following along as I post, and I hope that the addition of more chapters makes you excited rather than disappointed at the lack of resolution posted in this chapter.
John’s anger bled out of him at Sherlock’s ensuing silence, leaving only regret and stabbing guilt in its wake. He nodded and turned from the room, closing the doors behind him with a dull thud that sparked Sherlock back to the present. He blinked at the closed doors, the lack of heat in the room, and the absence of John. He immediately wanted John back. He wanted his fierce strength and fighting will. He wanted him to rail and scream at him for being a jealous, selfish idiot, to fight for him, to explain to him what he’d meant, as opposed to his resigned, quiet departure. It was all wrong. Everything about what just happened had been wrong. John was right, Sherlock was a child. And he hated himself for it, he hated the emotions coursing through him and all of their unstoppable, telling baggage they carried with them.
John tilted his head at the odd statement, his French non-existent beyond the basic conversational phrases and a string of naughty curses. Greg did not explain further, he simply chuckled low in his throat and shook his head at the man, walking down the hall towards him. He did not stop when he reached John but instead patted him on the shoulder and then gave him a gentle shove in the direction of 2B.
“Tell me what’s bothering you, Sherlock. I’ve allowed you your space, but you’ve been downright hostile today. What did I do?”
John's laughter died off in a contented hum at the feel of Sherlock's warm skin. He nuzzled behind Sherlock's ear, kissing the delicate spot with gentle lips when two long fingers pinched his nipple hard. John yelped and smacked Sherlock's thigh in retaliation. "Oi! Bastard."
Between Mrs H's kindness and the addictive lure of being within Sherlock Holmes’ orbit, John found himself as settled as he ever had been, subletting a friend of a friend’s room in a crowded flat in Greenpoint and obtaining monthly Metrocards in order to financially streamline his daily commute. It was a ghastly realisation. John Watson had become rather normal, and the idea struck him as a bit of a novelty. When was the last time John had a bed to call his own for more than three weeks, or a place in a kitchen cupboard to put his favorite mug, or a corner of a sitting room to store his music? John had trouble finding an answer to those questions, so he stopped trying and made his tea each morning, poured it into his thermos, and commuted to his job in the city, just another cog in the great machine.
Sherlock nodded, contented to carry on with his day and leave the ghost of feelings he’d experienced back in the alleyway where they belonged.
John didn’t trust himself to remain on the same floor, let alone next door to the man, so he marched himself downstairs and out onto the back patio. Mrs H was, thankfully, nowhere to be found and the remainder of her joint was left innocently on the table. He lit the tip and inhaled deeply, willing calm to overtake him. Willing his anger to leave and his senses to return to their status quo.
I'd be happy to share with you pictures of Mrs H's brownstone, Fort Greene, lovely examples of the magical back garden, and Balletlock artwork that I've drawn up to go along with the story.
The day before opening, the tenuous thread of rational thought linked to John inside Sherlock’s mind snapped. He watched John place a thermos of honeyed-tea and one of his prized jazz albums into the arthritic hands of Mr Baynes as a thank you for the poetry, and suddenly, the walls of the studio glowed red. He hated someone else being the center of John’s attention, even if that someone was an aging, (thankfully) straight man whom Sherlock could easily outwit, out dance and out fuck any day.
Mycroft straightened his tie, the physical representation of reigning in his frustration. “Noted, Mr Watson.”
It was all Sherlock had said to John in the forty minutes it had taken the two of them to get home. The only communication he’d given him outside of a head nod and the gentle pressure of his large hand pressing into the small curve of John’s back, leading him out the theater’s doors onto the pavement of Manhattan beyond.
Mycroft didn’t allow his brother’s smile to last for long. “I take it you won’t mind being sent back to England, then? Away from your precious company, and your precious pet? The Royal Ballet has informed me that if you were to apolog--”
Molly didn’t turn back from the window for the rest of the drive and John tried to relax his racing nerves by stroking Sherlock’s curls. Twenty minutes prior he’d been picturing a very different end to his evening. That version also ended with a Sherlock Holmes wrapped around him but not quite like this. John sighed and rested his head on the back of the car seat, his eyes falling closed as the car drove up to 123rd and Amsterdam where Molly lived. He’d have to take the subway back to Greenpoint and he’d be taking the long train ride alone.
“My dear boy, you naughty thing! Congratulations. I do believe I owe you a slightly larger salary now that you’re apart of the
John’s hands flew up in the air for lack of a better thing to do with them, as if the visceral response could somehow stop the words escaping from Mrs H's mouth with sheer willpower alone. John’s life had officially turned towards the surreal. “Please,” he said, “please never say that word again. In that context, at least.”
Sherlock swayed, his body losing its balance in the crowd and John held on tighter, laughing into the skin of his neck. “Whoa, there. Steady.”
Holding John against him with a willing, open mind was a revelation. The strength of him, the ferocity, the barely concealed temper he struggled to keep at bay, caused by a summer’s worth of sexual frustration simmering just behind John’s eyelids. It collectively created a spark of fascination that ignited in Sherlock’s mind. He had been the cause of such emotion, and now he wanted to be the resolution. In a surge of sudden confidence, he pushed John back into the leather chair in front of the hearth, his mind racing down three definitive pathways to his next move.
Sherlock’s voice had risen in volume during his speech and at the final outburst, Mycroft’s eyes widened to a comic degree. He looked around him, at the tiny, quiet, quaint cafe with its grandmothers sipping tea and local hipsters eating pancakes with their parents and glared at Sherlock for causing such a scene. Sherlock scoffed at his brother’s reaction.
Sherlock wondered why he and his brother always insisted that friendship and adhering to social norms were below them. He’d always had Mycroft growing up as a confidant and that was enough for Sherlock. Though now, away at school and Mycroft elbows deep in his bootlicking on Downing Street, there was little time for brotherly affection to fill the void of friendship. Their conversations were no longer conspiratorial but contentious. Their comments to each other more biting than humorous, and Sherlock puzzled over what was happening to them to cause the rift.
“Well,” John said, feeling every bit as awkward as he most assuredly looked with his skin flushed from the humidity of the day, the weight of his bags cutting into his shoulders, and the topsy-turvy situation he now found himself. Not two days ago he’d been wondering about whether or not a cat would help alleviate the rat problem in his building and now he had a set of keys to an entire brownstone in his hands.  “You don’t actually have to show me around. Just point me in the right direction and I’ll--.”
John was never one for holding back, but Sherlock was certainly one for avoidance. Every time John worked up the nerve to confront him, Sherlock found a way to dodge or make himself scarce. John would have been impressed if he wasn’t the target of Sherlock's not-so-passive resistance and already frustrated beyond measure.
There was a suspended beat hanging in the space between them, a singular moment when Sherlock wanted to take John into his arms and hold him, kiss his temples, run his hands through his impossible hair and sooth all the hurt he’d placed upon him. Instead, in a small voice, he confessed, “because you walked through that door back in June and my life hasn’t been the same since.”
Sherlock steered clear of John for the rest of that morning. Preferring instead to sulk in darkened corners and brood with his hands folded across his chest.
“You’re still going?” John asked, ignoring Sherlock’s attempt at humor. His mind was set to the same frequency it’d been broadcasting on since last evening when Sherlock informed him of Mycroft’s plans to (once again) install Sherlock at The Royal Ballet as principal for their upcoming season back in merry old England. Sherlock had hoped that swallowing John’s cock while he sat at the piano and attempted to play Brahms would leave him in a more accepting frame of mind to hear such news, but that plan clearly hadn’t worked.
They moved together to the oppressive heat and beat of the music, cocooned in each other’s embrace. John smiled as he kissed and licked at the skin he’d long wanted to taste and felt Sherlock’s moans vibrate against his chest, his lips exploring what was available to him. Sherlock was clinging to him, his hands skittering all over John’s back and hips and legs like he was memorizing every bit of the man’s anatomy. John welcomed the attention, his own hands splayed possessively against Sherlock’s lower back, his pinkies dipping into the waistband of his tight jeans and the rest of his fingers playing a frenetic rhythm of notes against Sherlock's spine.
As always, thank you for reading. Do please leave me some love if you can, and come find me on Tumblr -
The woman, herself, rounded the corner not a moment later, her arms outstretched towards him, face beaming.
Ten minutes later John found himself with a very strong and very good drink, that was definitely twice its normal liquid volume, but he wasn’t complaining. The night had cooled to a level just below tropical and there was a gentle breeze teasing his hair as he slumped in a hammock slung between two birch trees in Mrs H’s impressive back garden. The woman herself lounged on a small deck that led off the kitchen and boasted a table and set of four wooden chairs. She looked content, a little more so than usual, and John hid a smile wondering if the old bird was stoned.
It was Molly. The second they locked eyes, he knew that words were not needed. She looked back and forth between him and John with wizened eyes and Sherlock saw the correct conclusion come to her within moments. Molly had always been smarter than Sherlock had ever given her credit for and another notch of guilt etched itself into his skin at the thought.
Sherlock was telling his brother to leave him be or suffer the consequences of the scandal he'd fabricate out of thin air, even at his own expense. He was telling Mycroft to let him leave in peace or pay the price. Considering Mycroft had always prided himself on Sherlock's squeaky-clean image, the news of such a rumor would be a deep blow, indeed.
The revelation caused Sherlock to experience his first ever flummoxing of a performance. In his shock, he tripped.
Sherlock heard the pounding of the footfalls on the stairs before his eyes could even open to see John tear into the room, chest heaving, and hair an utter mess of tangles on his head.
Walking up Fifth Avenue, not yet teeming with tourists or businessmen and women on their way to their glass towers, Sherlock tucked earbuds into his ears to block out all the sound around him and lit a cigarette, inhaling the smoke deeply into his lungs. All he wanted in that moment was to go push his body to its furthest limits like he’d done the day before, and the day before that and the day before that. He wanted to feel that pure, painfully beautiful exhaustion from a hard day’s work of pursuing perfection.
John huffed again, willing his breath back into his lungs and his temper to stay seated. There was no reason to feel this disappointed, he wasn’t a child who’d was told no to ice cream.
The hard part came when John found a gig so solid that it lasted longer than a fortnight. To a musician, and a traveling one at that, such opportunities were like spotting an exotic species of bird in the middle of an urban city - they were anomalies. It was a score John wasn't very familiar with - finding something that paid well and kept him busy on a pre-set schedule, almost as if he were living the life of a regular person. The sense of normality that came with steady work always threw John for a loop - he'd grown so used to moving on to something new, something different when the opportunity arose, it physically felt wrong to stay put, as if he were missing some yet-to-be-discovered experience that he couldn't name but yearned to taste.
Sherlock inhaled deeply on his cigarette, hating the sting of his brother’s words and instead, relishing the burn and rush of the smoke filling his lungs. He closed his eyes and let the nicotine seep into his veins, wishing he could be anywhere else but cradled in the clutches of Mycroft’s web at that very moment.
He sprang from the floor in a fit of anxious energy, ignoring the tiny gasp of sound Molly gave at being in the path of the sweat flinging from his skin and walked to the windows along the back wall. They were old, double-hung, and wooden, painted many times over the decades and were a nightmare to open, but if they produced so much as a whisper of a breeze to cool Sherlock’s skin, he’d happily exert the extra effort. He heaved once, twice, and the pane flew open, filling the studio with a heavy push of warm air. Sherlock grimaced at the lack of relief but grinned as the satisfying sound of sheet music fluttering to the floor like so many autumn leaves echoed behind him. John wouldn’t be happy that his precious music was no longer in order and that satisfied Sherlock enough. The man had proven to be entirely too organized in Sherlock's view and needed a bit of sanding down along the edges. Sherlock was actually doing him a service, though he doubted that John would see it that way.
Much to John’s delight, now that they were doing full-dress on stage, the need for live accompaniment was paramount to prepare the dancers for the slight improvised differences the orchestra would make come opening night, which meant that John was called in to play. The music wasn't written for solo piano accompaniment alone which meant John was working with altered variations. Tomorrow, an upright bassist, percussionist and a trumpet player would join him, but for now, it was just John and his black and white keys.
As always, thank you so much for reading. Part three will be a bit of a doozy (in length) but I'm looking forward to sharing it with y'all! Thanks for putting up with me and my flighty ways.
“Itsfine,” Sherlock slurred, and reached for the car door, his fingers slipping against the handle. John stepped in close and opened the door, asking the driver if he was here to pick up a John Watson and the man nodded. John was too keyed up about Sherlock to care and turned to help him and Molly into the backseat.
The man across from Sherlock grimaced at his brother’s inhospitable response. “Do grow up, Sherlock.”
Sherlock stepped closer. “We already live together, John. This is merely a question of semantics and a willingness to pack up your record collection.” Sherlock swept his hand in a gesture towards the ceiling, referring to the piles upon piles of crammed milkcrates that lined the floorboards of the music room upstairs. John followed the movement of his hand, only to return his focus to staring just beyond Sherlock’s left shoulder, unable to meet his eyes.
John eyed the man as he rose from his position against the tree and stalked forward with all the demanding grace of a lion before coming to stand beside him. He looked defiant and wild in the light of the morning sun, his hair a frizzled tangle of sleep-tossed curls.
I hope you guys enjoyed this interim chapter before we get to opening night. I couldn't stop writing Sherlock's backstory these past weeks.
for this production. How exciting!” She smacked him lightly on the shoulder before going in for another hug. “We’ll need to update all that nasty paperwork and . . . whatever. Who cares. Where is the drinks trolley, we must have gin. This is a celebration!” She scanned the room, eyebrows creased, wondering why there wouldn’t be gin on every level of her home while also contemplating who to pay to remedy such a blatant oversight. John chuckled and rose from his seat to escort her back to the ground floor kitchen where gin, plenty of limes, and tonic were always on hand.
experience for you both.” Irene paused to jut out a hip and force a pout on her teasing lips. “It’s just that the rehearsal for Rubies will start soon. Doubt you’d want the other dancers to see what John was clearly planning on doing next. Those rascals can be such gossips.”
Sherlock crossed his arms and arched an elegant eyebrow. His head high and nose impossibly long as he stared down the length of it at John. There were no words forthcoming, but his expression was so pointed and clear that John took a step back, stunned into silence. His anger slowly abated while dread pooled in its place.
“It seems rather convenient to me that I’ve been followed by a small group of very dedicated photographers in very crisp bespoke suits for the past two and a half years running.”
John closed his eyes with a sigh, breathing out all his quandaries into the heavy, wet air of the room. He let his fingers trail upwards towards the clenched muscles at the back of Sherlock’s calves, kneading into the damp skin no longer covered by soft, black cotton. The exploration felt bold and John didn’t hesitate. Sherlock was allowing this - he was allowing John, kneeling in supplication before him, to work out his hard-used muscles and long-strained tendons of his legs after an arduous rehearsal, and he wasn’t pushing John away.
“No, Sherlock. I’m . . . no,” John shook his head. He didn’t have the words to describe what this was, what he felt, but it most certainly had nothing to do with the temperature outside the open windows. He turned on the piano bench to stare up into Sherlock’s face, willing him to see how on edge he was, how desperate, and how his need to touch Sherlock at that moment rang out through his fingertips so intensely he balled his hands into fists to keep himself still.
“I say this with great care in my heart, Sherlock. Stay focused. Sentiment is, and always will be, the downfall of every great artist.”
Sherlock shook his head, refocusing at what lay between them, staring at John’s covered erection as if it were a puzzle that needed solving. “I know.”
Sherlock attempted to hold back his smirk of amusement but ended up simply snorting into his tea. His mother, of course, noticed. “Sherlock. Sit. Up.” He did, too pleased to sulk any longer.
“Well then, I don’t see the need for all this melodrama. I really thought you were above this, John.”
Ascending the stairs with hesitant steps so as to not spill, John felt a childlike giddiness threaten to overtake him from the inside out, causing him to pause mid-way and force his face into a mask of stiff-upper-lip English calm. It didn’t last. Another two steps and he felt as if he was radiating as much light from his skin as the sun produced in the noon-day sky. He wanted to hum, to sing, to shout out towards the rooftops that Sherlock Holmes was lying in his bed, exhausted and sated thanks to John and John alone.
“Hey,” John said, chuckling as he shook out his right leg, letting it fall to the side, away from Sherlock’s teasing fingers. Sherlock didn’t mind the adjustment, considering the heavy weight of John’s cock had shifted to lay against his pelvis in the process. The gentle skin surrounding the reddened head beneath beckoned Sherlock from his resting place on John’s chest, encouraging him to move closer.
John laughed, and Sherlock grinned because he’d made that wonderful sound again. “Sherlock, you gorgeous, brilliant, fucking idiot. I’m all in. There’s no halfway for me. Don't you know that? Can’t you see that? I'm all in.” His hands were running along the sides of Sherlock’s neck, rubbing gentle circles into the tense, muscles bunched at the nape.
Chapter four is almost completed. I hope to get it up within the next few weeks. My birthday is the end of April, so perhaps before then!
Sherlock didn’t move, defiant as ever. After a full minute, he heard a thud behind his door and wondered if it was a fist or the resigned collide of John’s weary head. When the sound repeated a moment later, sullen and despondent, Sherlock had his answer: the head.
- I know that literally none of the questions from the last part were answered in this part but the story has run away with me and I figured you wouldn't mind some more sexual tension in the interim? Don't worry, Sherlock's resistance, finally breaking this tension, the full staging of the ballet, and perhaps even the reason to the drugging at the club will all come to ahead in the next part!
“I love you, John Watson,” he said below the din of the hollering crowd. To Sherlock’s astonishment, John turned to look at him at that moment, his eyes filled with a light he’d never seen before. Sherlock said it again, now that he had John’s attention, mouthing the words as clearly as he could manage. “I love you.”
“That feels . . .” The blurry edge of unconsciousness drifted towards Sherlock on a gentle wave as he tried to voice how good it felt to have John work him with his soothing, determined fingers. Sherlock welcomed it, his guilt strewn conscience and Mycroft’s warnings to stay away were nothing but dust in the wind the moment John’s hands made contact with his skin.
Mycroft undid his tie from about his neck and dropped it on the table where Sherlock knew it would remain even after they’d departed.
He made his way up the stairs to the second floor and did not stop his march until he was safely ensconced behind the doors to the music room and the smooth, cool ivory of the piano keys was present under his fingertips.
He’d returned twenty minutes later with a bottle of water, a petulant expression, and a whiff of cigarette smoke filtering past him. John scowled at the smell, hating the habit. Mrs H continued her teaching without further interruption and Sherlock kept himself in the front right corner, as far away from John as possible, brooding the entire time.
Martha Hudson was proud to be the current owner and caretaker of a restored brownstone, circa 1895, which sat sentinel on the left-hand side of the park in the quiet Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Despite the street being filled with grand and charming row homes all dating from the same period, hers was one of the few on the block that still retained its exuberant pre-war interior millwork and Victorian-era mantels and moldings, complete with exterior gas lamps, spindled archways, and a grand front hall staircase. Such lavish details were a point of pride to Martha and she took great care in maintaining her home’s original historical integrity. It had become a large portion of her life’s work outside of the company.
to her; she was saving him from himself. The gentle pressure of her fingers kept him in line and he was grateful for her presence at his side. If he survived this day, Sherlock resolved to send her a ridiculously gauche bouquet of flowers from Mrs H’s favorite florist.
Behind them, a delicate clink of a door being shut echoed through the room, just as Sherlock moaned out John’s name. John’s desire for the man did a skyrocketing thrust into an instant dive of shock at the simultaneous sounds, and fell forward from the force of it all. He rested his forehead against Sherlock’s suddenly tense knee and took in a gulp of much-needed air to calm his racing heart. A small, feminine giggle trickled along John’s spine. It made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end as Sherlock slowly righted himself in the chair, leaving John untethered and hovering awkwardly on his knees at his feet. He turned and saw Irene standing in the doorway, her red lips curling with mischief.
They passed him by without so much as a glance in his direction, as if he were nothing but a smudge on the wall behind him. Sherlock’s eyes followed the final boy in the group, the one who lingered in the back with a secret smile of triumph across his lips and his fisted hands humbly shoved into his pockets. He was happy for his team, but it was clear to Sherlock that this boy, this slight, sandy-haired young man was the one who’d scored the winning goal. It was obvious.
Sherlock caught him staring and John swore under his breath, hoping in vain that he wasn’t flushed. “It’s warm today.”
They moved together, Sherlock shifting off his heels while John sunk down onto the floor in front of him. He handed him a pillow from the chair, “for your head,” he instructed, and gently pushed the man onto his back on the soft, woven rug.
And then Mr Bayens’ brilliant idea for the final piece of the production lit up the theater with its inspirational allure and all Sherlock could do was bite hard on his bottom lip to keep a cry of bitter laughter at bay. He felt Molly’s delicate hand wrap its way around his forearm, and he looked down at her as Mrs H cheered on in the background. Molly smiled up at him, the compassionate look in her eyes blatant with understanding. Sherlock tucked his chin in a tight nod of appreciation and mouthed a silent
Sherlock did not deign to respond to John’s retort, but instead, picked up another mug off the table and drank deeply. John watched the rise and fall of Sherlock’s throat as it worked to swallow the rich, warm liquid. If he licked his lips at the sight, he told himself it was because of the taste of the coffee on his tongue and not the indulgent dip of Sherlock’s Adam’s apple moving languid and smooth along his pale, exposed neck.
The intricate black and white, patterned hexagonal tile leading to the foyer seemed to mock him as Sherlock walked barefoot towards the front stairwell with as much composure as his born-and-bred, blue British blood could muster. He told himself that the fact he was out of breath stemmed from spending too much time in the shock of the early morning heat and not the utter, unending frustration coursing through him on a constantly recycled circuit.
When John approached him at the end of class to ask how he faired after he’d left him on Friday night, Sherlock glared at him, eyes blazing and face cool. He said nothing to John, and turned back to his bag, shoving his empty water bottle and a pair of leg warmers into its depths. John scratched at his neck, hovering awkwardly over him, wishing he’d speak.
Sherlock sighed and he looked away, staring at the breeze dancing with the curtains at the open window. “John, you have two options: kiss me or go to sleep. Either one will do, considering they both render you mute.”
The rasp of wooden legs against the floorboards cut through the air as John stood from the bench and moved to take hold of the overwhelming man standing before him with soaked hair and open eyes, burying his nose into the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder and breathing in all that beautiful, shower-fresh scented skin. It wasn’t long before his tongue was reaching out to taste that delicious skin, his teeth following suit, nipping beneath Sherlock’s ear and whispering his secret hopes into the shadows at the back of Sherlock’s neck.
They walked into the theater side by side, though worlds apart. Every silent step made it worse, every unforgiven minute that passed between them caused a greater rift and Sherlock knew that the feeling he was seeking was penitence. Only he could breach the chasm growing steadily between them by accepting his emotions for what they were: a mixture of pure jealousy and unchecked selfishness. He needed to apologise. He needed to speak.
“So, you decided to let yourself in and watch,” Sherlock said. John felt him stand up at his side and, with a sigh, stood himself.
“Oh, good, Sherlock, were you going to play? That’s a lovely idea! It’s a perfect night for music. Even John was humming just now. You weren’t going back inside were you, after just coming out in the first place? Did you forget your rosin or something? Your bow doesn’t need it, does it? Just come and give us a little concert as a test if so, I’m sure you’ll be splendid.”
The movements his body were making was nothing profound yet the moment felt like a revelation to Sherlock, a reawakening of why he loved this world and killed himself each day in the studio to be greater, to be the best.
He placed a pint of bitter on the sticky tabletop. He had no plans to drink it, John would happily do the honours for him later. He picked up his beloved Strad gingerly from its hard-shell case, fingers brushing reverently across the blue crushed velvet interior before attaching the shoulder pad and lifting the violin to his shoulder. It tucked in close to his neck and he held it tight with his chin. Across from him, seated at the upright piano, shoved against the back wall, was John, his tousled blonde hair glowing golden in the mellow lamplight of the pub. They gave each other a nod and struck up a familiar tune as smiles broke out in the crowd around them.
Mrs H was thrilled to bring in a member of the original corps of Robbins’ traveling dancers to teach the choreography to the company - Tobias Baynes. The man’s reputation proceeded him, it seemed, as every member of the company inhaled audibly at the first mention of his name. John did a quick search on his phone, not wanting to be in the dark, and found the man’s impressive body of work spanned over five decades in the dance and theater world. He’d written several books and even debuted a series of paintings based on his travels to rave reviews in 1987 at the Guggenheim. Christ, the man certainly did have a reputation.
When John finally gave in and moved to pour out more coffee for them both, Sherlock placed his empty mug on the hard, wooden surface and walked off, leaving John behind him. The Chemex was left halfway off the table in John’s hand, hanging in midair, much like the myriad of unanswered questions swirling about John’s mind on a heavy, summer wind.
John kept his back turned as he poured the just-below-boiling water over the grinds, if only to hide his permanent and telltale grin from Mrs H, who hummed behind him in contentment with her cocktail and the current issue of
Sherlock scoffed and moved to turn back but John was faster, he surrounded him, arms circling his waist and shoving him back into the sofa cushions. Sherlock landed hard, his curls flying back off his forehead, eyes wide with shock. John leaned in, arms braced on either side of Sherlock’s shoulders, crowding him.
John took an indulgent sip of the fresh, fragrant coffee and then placed the mug next to his glasses on the bedside table, meaning to leave the rest for Sherlock. The air in his room smelled of saliva-slicked tongues and fevered, sweat-soaked skin. He smiled to himself as he opened the second window along the back wall, allowing a cross breeze to ripple the curtains on their rods and cast the staleness out into the wind.
The bed was consuming him in a cocoon of consoling comfort he couldn't control. His fingers danced along the pattern of the quilt beneath him, playing imaginary keys as he focused on nothing and yet saw every bit of the past hour float across his vision, taunting and confusing him until he rubbed at his eyes to make the images stop. Above him, the ceiling swam into a swirl of dusky grey and before John knew it, the sweet delirium of unconsciousness was pulling him down into a  dream-filled haze of memories he had tried so hard to keep at bay.
John stared up at the large, marble arched doorway of Mrs H’s brownstone with something akin to wonder in his eyes. It was right out of a storybook or a Wes Anderson film. The place evoked visions of the past to John, of stovepipe hats and layered skirts, and carriages drawn by horses and lamps lit with gas and fire - actually, that last bit was a reality he noted as he watched a real flame flicker in the lantern next to the door. He’d been around his fair share of grand homes in England, but it was always a bit of a culture shock to be confronted with such history stateside what with all the glass towers and modern architecture New York boasted.
John hid his face in the folds of the duvet near Sherlock’s hip. It felt like they were teenagers on the hormonal-fueled precipice of ‘going steady’ and apparently, that frightened John. The same man who’d chased down a pair of crackheads after they’d snatched Mrs Hudson’s purse and successfully overcame them. The same man who’d performed emergency (and surprisingly competent) triage on a dancer in the corps who had suffered a compound fracture to the femur after taking a bad fall, and kept her calm while they waited for the paramedics to arrive. This man, who handled such circumstances without hesitation, was hiding from the mere thought of declaring himself taken and Sherlock grinned, feeling emboldened and giddy as he waited out John agonizing over his response.
The two men sat in woven French cafe chairs outside a creole restaurant around the corner from Mrs H’s brownstone, both feigning relaxed postures. Two matching sets of long legs were crossed elegantly in front of them, taking up large portions of the pavement. Sherlock kicked out at his brother’s bespoke Italian loafer just as he went to take a sip from his tea, causing him to spill the hot liquid down his shirt front, and staining his silk tie. Sherlock puffed out a laugh of cigarette smoke, the satisfaction of a gag well pulled evident to everyone around them.
John almost said yes before he remembered he was supposed to be put out by the invasion of privacy. Irene smiled at his dazed look. “Everyone saw you two, John. So saying it’s none of my business is rather a moot point. The question is, what did you do to fuck it up?” She leaned into his space, resting a hip on the piano ledge.
John was standing next to Sherlock, his arms crossed across his chest, legs set firmly apart, solid, strong, and utterly peeved at the man who’d interrupted their quiet Monday. Sherlock beamed with pride beside him.
Down the way, a set of uni boys rounded the corner onto the street, their loud, boisterous shouts and hollers echoed through the alley like a shrill call of alarm to Sherlock’s ears. He studied them as they approached, taking in the sight of their broad, muscled shoulders and pink and white striped jerseys, their flushed faces high with the exuberance and excitement of adrenaline no doubt pulsing through their collective veins. Half wore their white collars popped, half wore them down, all were creased through with wrinkles and mud from the pitch. They’d just come from a game and a winning one at that.
Sherlock leaned back just enough to see a look of awe on John’s astonished face before he moved in to close his lips over John’s, sealing his wonder with a kiss.
Sherlock turned from her water-filled gaze and stalked from the dining hall with a barely contained rage over their betrayal, his long coat flapping behind him in a gust of nonexistent wind. There was familial love, and then there was the overbearing and suffocating reach of Mycroft Holmes, whose paranoia and ego had finally surpassed the girth of his growing waistline. Sherlock was no longer interested in playing puppet on the long strings his brother too-easily controlled from his perch high above Downing Street. To Sherlock, the answer was simple; it was time to leave.
He went to make the drinks, his fingers cramping around the Waterford crystal glasses in his hands. He wanted to punch something - he wanted to fight. Normally, John would push down such instincts and channel that internal anger into playing, but the only piano at his disposal was several flights of stairs away, and Mrs H was expecting a cocktail. John steeled his nerves and returned to the patio and the pain of Sherlock’s music, hoping beyond hope that the slow, deliberate, deconstruction of his ability to hide his emotions would soon be over.
Sherlock leaned in and kissed John’s swollen lips again. “Mmmm, fascinating. Shall I repay the favour?”
“Considering the angle with which I just snapped my latest in a series I’m going to lovingly call, Sherlock and John - The Early Years, I dare say he’ll be rather scandalized if I did.”
She scoffed at him, waving an elegant hand through the air as if it were choreographed and then dug into the satchel slung across her hip. She pulled out her phone and thumbed at the screen, a wicked little smile crossed her face before she turned the phone towards John, showing him what had so amused her.
Molly's small smile faltered and she turned her head to look out the window, her ponytail curving around her long neck. John felt like shit realising that Molly probably had a few herself and wasn’t exactly in a sober state of mind. He'd also just taken her away from her friends on their night off and was now asking her to play nurse and hostess to one very unconscious Sherlock Holmes. He rubbed at his face and reached the arm he’d rested along the seatback towards Molly’s ponytail, tugging gently.
Mycroft rolled his eyes as he stood from the table, brushing away the creases from his linen trousers.
Sherlock’s attention came back to him as the opening notes of music filled the air, the piece having been altered to allow the piano to lead the main theme. A collective breath was taken on stage as the dancers all fell into the movement, performing the choreography with fervour. This was what a dancer lived for—the blood pumping through their veins in rhythmic counts of eight, their bodies working on perfected muscle memory, the energy of the crowd coursing over them, pushing them onward to the very end. The adrenaline of it all felt akin to taking a hit of the purest drug, a floating high from which Sherlock never wanted to come down. He fed off these moments as if he were devouring the finest feast, savouring every morsel to the final crumb.
Well, if John didn’t want Sherlock mapping the intricacies of his body hair, tracing the gentle lines of his softened cock would have to suffice.
It wasn’t until the fourth movement of the ballet’s performance that evening, under the burning multicolored lights and the dripping of his own sweat that he finally realised what had been shattered earlier on the very same stage—his heart. Sherlock's mouth fell open in a silent O as he felt the fact solidify like the most obvious of truths - Sherlock Holmes had fallen for John Watson.
The perfect line the two of them created in the studio mirrors, accented by a slash of red from Irene’s lips and a flash of cream satin from the ribbon of her pointe shoes was nothing if not beautiful. Sherlock knew that people found him attractive in an alien way, but the two of them together created an otherworldly combination he couldn’t help but appreciate when photographed for performances. The company heads hailed them as the Fonteyne and Nuryeve for a new generation and advertised them as such. Sherlock went from being a rising star soloist to principal lead in almost every production the company put up and was revered as being the golden child of The Royal Ballet.
Mycroft smirked at his little brother, producing a package from his left breast pocket of fine, hand-rolled Belgian cigarettes, which just so happened to be impossible to find outside of Europe. Sherlock’s eyebrow quirked. Mycroft certainly had his attention.
Sherlock halted, frozen in place. God, that man! John was bold as brass and beautiful as ever as he sat there at his bench, snapping Sherlock in two with nothing but a smirk at the corner of his clever lips. He couldn’t take it any longer—Sherlock Holmes had had enough.
He was two feet away from the bathroom door when he turned back and blurted, “But, the bagels, John.”
John lifted his head up from the piano and the piece he'd been studying at the sound of a thoroughly overjoyed Mrs H bustling into the upstairs music room. She approached with quick-footed steps and arms outstretched. John gave her an indulgent smile, knowing he was in for one hell of a squeeze.
John, not needing to be present at a piano that wasn’t being played, did not get the pleasure of watching the great Mr Baynes work his magic on the dancers during that first week, but he’d often stop by between his other classes and sneak a peek at the progress of the group. He loved the sounds coming out studio 2B, and grinned broadly at the brazen, uncharacteristic movement of the dancers within the studio’s confines. It was different, refreshing and fucking brilliant. He couldn’t wait to see it all unfold on stage in rehearsal where he'd finally be needed for live accompaniment.
“Tell me, Mycroft, did it ever occur to you to figure out who was responsible for drugging me that 'disastrous' night?”
“No, you aren’t. Don’t forget that I was the one who helped you pick up the pieces after that disaster of a club night your friends dragged you to. Not only that, but I also have proof of your almost-
“May I ask, how was your morning coffee? And which did you find more enjoyable, the caffeine or the company? ”
John nodded, his fingers absentmindedly fiddling with the tags lying on his chest. He’d been a disappointment to his father in more ways than not just continuing on the family legacy of ‘crying God for Harry, England and St. George’ in the military. For one, he was almost certain he would never add a branch to the family tree of continual J. H. Watsons, and the reason behind that very well may be lying before him on the bed in a pool of afternoon sunlight.
of his spine cracking, feeling listless and languid in the hazy summer heat. The breeze coming from the third-floor windows was humid and heavy and quintessentially familiar yet foreign—it couldn’t remember it ever being this hot in Britain.
“No one likes Mycroft, John. It’s quite alright.” Sherlock hesitated a beat, allowing John to step ahead of him into the kitchen. “Though it may please you to hear that he is fully aware of his repugnance to the entirety of the human race outside Downing Street.”
Sherlock did return to the house the previous night but had steered clear of the floor he shared with John. Instead, he curled himself into a tight ball on the chaise in the solarium, like some common rebellious house cat hiding from its disappointed master. He was being a coward again, and he knew it and hated it, but he’d been rattled. Earlier that day in the studio, hidden away from the prying eyes of the outside world, he’d been perfectly willing to give into whatever strange attraction it was that pulsed between him and John, only to be reminded of his damn brother at Irene’s arrival. He cursed Mycroft for ever having sent her to watch over him in the first place. Sherlock did not need a babysitter, especially one who thought drugging him to help him get laid was actually a
Sherlock shook his forehead against John’s keeping his eyes closed, willing for time to stand still in this perfect moment. “No.”
Sherlock watched John enter the classroom with an air of casual, hard-won confidence. The leather satchel John carried, bursting with hand-written sheet music, was slung over his shoulder in an inelegant fashion, a thermos of tea was clasped in his left hand, and to complete the perfect portrait of an artistic eccentric John was clearly trying to portray, a pair of round, wire-framed glasses perched lightly on his upturned nose. His worn plaid button down and corduroy trousers were out of place in a sea of lycra and moisture-wicking synthetic leotards, yet he remained inconspicuous in the back corner behind his piano, never drawing attention to himself, while simultaneously being the only thing in the room Sherlock cared to concentrate on when he wasn’t dancing. John had proved to be quite the distraction and Sherlock found he didn’t like that very much.
The sheer insinuation of such a statement caused John to take a half step back from the man, having no right to feel so tempted by someone who was practically asleep before him. He licked his lips again, shifting his stance, unsure of how to act or where to look or even how to breathe. How had he gotten here? What exactly had Greg intended when he sent John in here and what on earth did Sherlock mean when he asked about making himself useful while looking like an overflowing cone of decadent gelato that needed the immediate attention of John’s too-eager tongue?
“Sherlock will show you to your room, won’t you Sherlock? My hip is acting up.” She tapped her right side with a frown and then turned on the spot and disappeared behind a set of massive sliding doors. The scratching sound of a needle touching down to a vinyl record echoed through the panels not a moment later and the warbling cries of Edith Piaf’s lovesick voice filled the air.
Sherlock showed up early and stayed late into the night. He rarely took ‘fresh air’ breaks (the cheeky nickname the company used to justify their smoking habits) nor did he seem to eat meals or drink anything other than a fancy brand of sparkling water - he kept no fewer than two bottles of the stuff in his sack at all times. He was a walking paradox and a wonderful distraction for John whose knees would start bouncing with nervous energy everytime he received an e-mail or text alert about another gig elsewhere in the world. John would bite his lip and squirm in his seat over the missed opportunities and then as if on cue, Sherlock would spiral out a series of biting observations about a visiting choreographer or the newest affair in the company during class, pulling John from his inner turmoil. The outbursts never failed to make John smile, even if they were a bit cruel. Sherlock Holmes certainly had no qualms about hurting his colleagues’ feelings. Most of them expected it, in fact, including the ballet masters who lead the company’s classes.
Sherlock had the sudden urge to taste himself in the heat of John’s mouth and sprung from his languid position on the floor to cover John’s body with his own and press all of his freshly discovered skin into the man beneath him. It felt good being bold.
She and John exchanged a silent conversation the moment she saw Sherlock’s altered state and immediately flanked herself on the opposite side, helping to hold Sherlock up as he rapidly faded into semi-consciousness.
She smirked and clinked her own tumbler with his, and they sipped in companionable silence for all of thirteen seconds before Irene cut right to the chase.
Sherlock smiled into the warm skin of John’s chest, pressing a kiss to his sternum and nuzzling his nose along the ridge of his collar bone. The hair on his body fascinated Sherlock. The patterns, the differentiating shades of colour, the way it fanned out from his thighs in light, blonde fuzz and curled gently over his chest in small, intricate swirls of ginger. He was a man in every sense of the word, and Sherlock revelled in the certainty of that fact. He felt no inkling to experiment with other people; they were tedious, the lot of them. Sherlock had found John, the standard to which every other human male on the planet should be measured. And no one would ever measure up to John Watson in Sherlock’s eyes. No one.
. Desperately. It took him no less than three seconds to pull down John’s trousers and curl his fingers under the elastic of his pants to drag them past his hips, letting loose the erection he’d been aching to see since the first time he’d pressed himself against the man and felt it push hard and wanting into his upper thigh.
“Cash or card?” The cabbie asked and Sherlock blinked open his eyes in time to see John hand over two twenties and utter keep the change, as he exited curbside. They had arrived. Sherlock followed John with careful steps, watching him the entire time, cataloging every swallow, every uneven shift of his feet.
Sherlock watched as John greeted the other musicians with warm smiles for each. The trumpet player handed him a takeaway cup of what Sherlock assumed to be a strong brew of oolong with honey. The sight made Sherlock wince with its obvious kindness. Why hadn’t Sherlock thought of getting a cuppa for him? It was such a simple thing, such a genuine gesture of friendship. Why hadn’t he ever done that for John before?
He turned and resumed his sprawling on the ground next to Molly, his arms reaching up and out in front of him to mark the steps of the piece they'd been rehearsing. Notes of imaginary music drifted past his gaze as he heard the verses in his head. Molly’s thin, pale arms joined his in the air, mimicking the steps with her hands like all dancers did, and the two of them soon descended into giggles at their impeccable timing. Even without spoken counts or music to accompany them, they moved together soundlessly, the muscle memory ingrained deeply within them, the many rehearsals paying off even in this unguarded, gentle moment.
That was always his favorite part, seeing the small group of company members and understudies run through everything they’d learned, or worked on, or mastered that day be put to music and danced through with all the vigor of a true performance. The Tuesday and Thursday evenings when his schedule allowed him to sneak up to the second story studios to watch (and listen) to the rehearsals of
John Watson liked to improvise. He was very good at it. He saw his entire life as being one long improvised solo he was performing for the audience of the world around him. Whoever felt like paying him mind was welcome to, and whoever decided to look the other way was also accepted. John lived his life the way he wanted it, complete with the gypsy experience of never having settled down anywhere or really owning anything outside of his music and a handful of jumpers. He traveled too much to keep a flat anywhere or to bother with extra possessions and knew enough people in enough cities that finding a place to kip was not much of a hardship.
A moment passed. Then two. Sherlock tensed in the growing silence but before he could formulate some vague platitude he knew would be a lie warm arms wrapped around him from behind and Sherlock felt John bury his head into his soft curls. Sherlock swallowed his panic, which had been steadily climbing up his throat, forcing himself to remain calm in the wake of his admission. He curled into the cocoon of John’s arms, his fingers trailing through the pale, blonde hairs of his forearms.
“Would you rather this be on a bed?” John asked as he massaged circles into the skin just above Sherlock’s hip bones. Sherlock shook his head, his damp curls falling along the sides of his face as he lay back against the pillow.
There were five movements to learn and Mr Baynes had yet to show them any by the end of week one. Chunks of choreography were used in the class warm-ups and floor work, but nothing had been organized into a context yet, nothing had been dolled out into parts, nothing had even been set to its proper music. Mr Baynes, instead, lead the classes with vinyl recordings of what he called
One final person trailed out of the studio, with a bag slung over his shoulder and a thermos in his hand. Greg Lestrade, a Ballet Master with the company, who was mainly seen around the halls eating French eclairs and making the female dancers weak in the knees, spotted John standing awkwardly in the middle of the hallway the moment he turned from the doorway. He pushed the long locks of his salt-n-pepper hair back off his forehead out of habit and smiled at John with warmth in his deep, brown eyes.
Sherlock pointedly put his back to John and faced Mrs H, lounging languid and cool as a cucumber in her chair, before raising his violin and bow into position. She gave him an indulgent smile and gestured behind him towards John in the hammock, attempting to include him. Sherlock ignored her. John sighed.
John’s neck ached in a way that suggested he’d been curled up all wrong in his bed. His right foot was asleep, pressed hard up under his left thigh, and his arms seemed to be wrapped in around him too closely. He blinked his eyes open and stared at the strange leafy green ceiling of his room, wondering when Mrs H had painted the white walls with acres of leaves and sunlight.
magazine flipped open on the table. He heard her place a delivery order at the bakery around the corner for bagels just as he was turning to leave with his fresh coffee in hand, and gave her another kiss on the cheek in silent thanks before heading out towards the hallway. A bagel loaded with lox and cream cheese sounded like a rather nice start to the day.
In the end, Sherlock realised that his reactions were more obvious than a flashing neon sign lighting the darkening sky above a sleazy casino in the American West. More obvious than Mycroft's expanding waistline or Mrs H's marijuana habit. He could play aloof, he could play arrogant, he could play indifferent all he wanted, but John knew that Sherlock ached for him and he had accepted his own feelings much sooner than Sherlock had. John was free, and open and, Sherlock hated to admit it, but so utterly intriuging the need to
Sherlock’s face fell at the final word. John was right, Sherlock knew it. He cast his eyes downward and away from John, his breathing ragged and not from the dancing. Sherlock realised with alarming shame that the prickling sting at the corner of his eyes was the telltale sign of tears. He cursed under his breath and shook his head of every emotion he felt, trying to rid them from this body.
“Interesting,” he said to the air, looking at the space where the boy had been. He felt bereft of an opportunity though he couldn’t fathom why since friendship had never been on Sherlock’s radar.
With another sigh, she stalked forward and grabbed the phone out of Sherlock’s hands with a scoff. “Honestly, you boys are idiots. No, I didn’t take any pictures. Yes, I was kidding earlier. There’s a difference between having a bit of fun, Junior, and just being cruel. I am not
Mycroft broke first, tapping the tip of his umbrella against the rug as if bringing a classroom of students to attention. “While you may think that this is a form of cruel retaliation towards you both for that
That evening, Sherlock sat in Heathrow with two suitcases at his sides, the glow of his phone illuminating his face from below. He was reading a news article posted to NPR not twenty minutes prior, the headline reading:
John shuddered at that last thought, hating the images it sprung to mind. He sat hard on the piano bench in rehearsal room 2B, wishing he had time to go brew himself a cup of tea - he needed the fortification.
Mycroft sat back in his chair, a look of controlled indifference crossing his features. Sherlock knew it was forced. He had him. He stubbed out his cigarette with a flourish and locked eyes with the man he’d once so admired.
John huffed out a laugh and tugged on a curl of Sherlock’s hair, seeing a satisfying wince in response. He smiled and threaded his fingers through the rest of the sleepy tangles, feeling amazed that he was now allowed to do such a thing. He savoured the thought as if it were the last sips of his favorite scotch.
His mother, as always, chose to ignore any animosity she witnessed between her children, instead focusing on the good and never lingering on the bad. She was encouraging in that way, and yet willingly ignorant of the effects such complacency caused. Sherlock watched her sip her tea with her eyes taking in everything around her over the rim of her cup. He could see her cataloging colors and fabrics and shadow patterns thrown by the light cast through the crystal water glasses on the table, her artist eye never once at rest. She was fascinating to observe for this reason, her brain never ceasing, much like Sherlock’s, and he always found comfort in watching his mother gather data and file it away however she pleased up in her brilliant mind. He loved that he was like her in this regard and ached to find more similarities between them.
Sherlock shifted restlessly beneath John, unable to stay still under the onslaught of the new, incredible sensation. John’s mouth was a hot, unstoppable force of heat and suction that Sherlock could never have imagined ever being prepared for - all he could do was call out John’s name in pathetic pants of exhaled breath, shaking in his skin until John laid a reassuring arm across Sherlock’s hipbones, steadying him, and pushing him back into the soft rug beneath them, causing his voice to choke off in a moan at the restraining pressure.
Sherlock’s hand guided John upright from his slouched position and turned him with a silent demanding pressure. John gladly gave in to being maneuvered like a rag doll on a wire as Sherlock crouched down next to the piano bench and peered into John’s eyes. His fingers remained tangled in John’s hair, almost pulling. John held back a groan at the tantalizing feeling as Sherlock used his hold on John to tip his head back, exposing his neck, pushing John’s limits of his own vulnerability.
With exhaustion overtaking him, John sagged forward to rest his damp forehead against the forgotten sheet music on the stand and succumbed to the need to close his eyes against the black and white world before him. His fingers idly played soft, sweet notes along the higher registers, chasing his bitterness away. He had worked his frustrations down to a small pinprick of pain pulsing behind his left eyelid. It was easy enough to ignore, and easier still to soothe with the rhythms he was blending. Soon, the pain would be gone and he’d be whole again - armored and steady.
Pleased with the reaction, Sherlock grinned and shimmied lower, his head coming to rest in the sloping vee between John’s hipbones. “Yes?”
“Not enough data,” was all Sherlock said before licking a long, solid stripe up John’s cock, causing the man to buck into the air like a common beast. He rubbed a hand across his face and punched out air through his nostrils, forcing himself to calm down, lest he embarrass himself beyond all redemption.
John slumped onto the large bed in the corner of the room next to a window glowing with late afternoon light. The mattress squeaking beneath his weight as every bit of tension he’d been holding in his shoulders started to seep out through his pores and onto the floor beneath him. He’d never been so exhausted from a single conversation before in his life and he’d barely spoken. It’d been awful. Sherlock had attempted to be amiable, the worst of things, and now they shared a bloody wall.
Sherlock broke first, his need to be straightforward with John paramount. “If you can deduce my feelings on the idiotic ideals of our society’s ridiculously vapid beauty standards then you’ll no doubt understand my thoughts on the title of ‘boyfriend’ or ‘partner.’”
John shook his head and stood up from the table, leaving the madwoman behind with her purple haze. He’d been having a perfectly mediocre day and she had to go and ruin that mediocrity with her mothering and pot smoke and it was all a bit much. He needed to be alone. He needed to play.
John sat straighter in his chair and hoped to god this conversation would soon be over. “You’re stoned.”
“What happened?” she asked, clearly worried about his trip-into-spontaneous-tumble from earlier. Despite this being a perfectly reasonable question, Sherlock ignored her quandary in favour of snuggling his pointy chin into her bony shoulder.
The drugged drink was another point of bruised pride for Sherlock. He thought he’d prepared himself for the reaction his body would have with the drug in his system, he was almost looking forward to his unplanned high. He’d never indulged in such things before and despite his rudimentary calculations of how much alcohol he could handle, he hadn’t factored in the combination it would have with the GHB Irene had slipped him. He should have known, should have realised that he hadn’t been hydrating enough and had barely eaten anything that day which would no doubt affect his reactions to new chemicals entering his bloodstream. He’d been stupid and slow, two things Sherlock hated more than he hated his cursed brother and all his damn rules.
“Shut up.” John leaned forward and silenced him with his lips and tongue and teeth. The moan that echoed out from the man beneath him made John smile against Sherlock’s mouth before pulling away. He wanted to give Sherlock pleasure, and the hard-stifled, ego-filled part of him wanted it to be so bloody brilliant Sherlock would never bother looking anywhere else for satisfaction again. John wanted to ruin him.
“You’re beautiful,” John whispered, breathing it against his neck. Sherlock shivered, his head falling to the curve of John’s shoulder, seemingly hiding himself from the rest of the room.
Even in the dim light of the evening, John could see the frustration along the tense line of Sherlock’s shoulders and the defiant tilt of his chin.  He hated knowing he was responsible for that tension and wished he could talk to Sherlock, explain things, or have Sherlock explain it all to him. What happened on the dance floor that fateful Friday evening was fun and brash and flirtatious and wonderful. Comparing that to the abrupt change come Tuesday morning and the murderous expressions he’d been sending him since did not compute in John’s brain. He simply did not understand.
No one breathed as the two men theoretically circled each other with their words. Sherlock maintained a surprising silence as his discerning eyes shifted back and forth between the piano bench and Mr Baynes’ clasped hands, assessing every nuance of the men’s behavior and yet remaining tight-lipped. This did not go unnoticed by John, who held Mr Baynes’ gaze in unspoken challenge while keeping track of Sherlock’s presence in the periphery of his vision.
John scowled and sat down hard on the piano bench. He felt like a caged animal, waiting for this impossible man to do whatever it is he was doing behind that damnable door. Naked and wet and . . . John groaned as his head fell forward onto the black and white keys, the sound of their disjointed notes smashing together in a perfect representation of the tempest of emotion swirling in his gut.
Sherlock swallowed, John watched the bob of his Adam’s apple descend in his throat and willed himself to not lean in and lick at the delicate skin.
*Merde - literally means 'shit' in French. It's a tradition that all ballet dancers tell each other Merde before heading onto the stage. It's their way of wishing each other luck for the performance.
John smiled and pulled back, enjoying the freedom of the moment. But what John saw when he looked up at the man he’d been holding so tightly rocked John to his core and suddenly, the world turned sideways. Sherlock wasn’t just drunk, he was visibly drugged. He eyes were wild and out of focus, his eyelids heavy with fatigue. The swaying Sherlock had been doing wasn’t just clumsy, intoxicated dancing, it was truly a loss of equilibrium.
Sunlight crept over them as the morning passed into early afternoon. Bright slashes of buttery light painted the bed sheets, spreading warmth over Sherlock’s exposed thighs and John’s jutting left hip bone. Sherlock stared at the downy hairs that sat low on John’s stomach, the breeze of the fan pushing them to-and-fro like wind across a wheat field. He couldn’t help extending his fingers towards those curls, dancing over them with a gentle rhythm.
Sherlock flicked the butt of the cigarette away from him with a twist of pale his wrist and pulled another from the pack. He was going to make himself sick smoking so much after months of (practically) abstaining but he didn’t care, it helped him think, and Sherlock needed to think.
John nodded, satisfied that the woman was probably taking the piss a bit but her intentions seemed to be in the right place. He lapped at the condensation collecting along his glass and sipped his drink, marveling once again at the rabbit hole he must have fallen down to end up in such a place with such a landlady.
He pinched and patted and adjusted and realigned and moved limbs and fingers and heads to where he wanted them. He was extreme and engaging and did not for one minute ever show his age of seventy-eight years during a class and he expected the dancers to do the same. No one sat, no one rested, they gave it their all and Mrs H was utterly besotted with the man by week’s end.
Sherlock shoved at John’s shoulders, no longer wanting to be cowed into submission. The two of them fell forward before Sherlock grabbed John, twisted him and shoved him back to where he’d just been, giving the man a taste of his own ire. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
Mr Baynes’ left eyebrow arched elegantly into the silver hair sweeping his forehead. “You certainly have a decided opinion on the matter.”
John watched Sherlock unlock the door of Mrs H’s brownstone with quick, measured movements and stepped inside, eager at the prospect of finally being alone with him behind the safety and security of a locked door. Sherlock kept him on edge as he made his way up to their floor, his fingers trailing behind him on the balustrade, pointing back towards John in teasing invitation. John’s own hand hovered close by, the need to touch Sherlock growing with every passing second.
John hadn’t fucked-up Sherlock’s life. On the contrary, he’d brought a fire and vitality and adventure and something fucking interesting into Sherlock’s stilted, stifling world. He’d made his days worth living and for one, staggeringly perfect evening, he showed him what it was to truly feel. He’d been numb before John.
“Yes, yes. I know. Whatever. Forgive me for wanting to compliment my . . .” John stalled, the humid air in the room suddenly felt strained with the tension of uncertainty.
In front of him, the hammock beckoned and he shuffled forward, exhausted and spent, the need to lie down suddenly the most important out of all his most base and depraved urges. He slept there that night, on the hammock, in the silent, backyard garden under the starless sky. He slept fully and deeply and did not dream. If the sad, crying sounds of a violin trailed across his eyelids and over the tips of his toes at the break of dawn, lulling him into the sweet void of subconsciousness after waking with a start, he did not remember it come morning, and for that he was grateful.
“I’ve never . . .” Sherlock trailed off, the youth of his soft features telling the rest of the story.
John blinked at him, the profound statement taking root in his bones and growing out towards his fingertips with the sudden realisation that John alone was being given permission to witness this vulnerability. To be apart of this chapter-turning moment in Sherlock’s life, the same moment John had thrown away all those years ago in the backseat of a car behind a music hall with the girl he thought he was going to marry before discovering another side of himself. It took all of John’s resolve not to buckle at the knees and end up in a heap on the floor.
“John, Molly. I love him!” He stated this as if it were the most profound and wonderful bit of information he could bestow upon anyone, mixed with a general air of being unable to comprehend the foreign words slipping across his tongue. It must have been bewildering to Molly, having to witness more emotion play across Sherlock’s face in one moment than compared to the entire three years she’d been working with him combined.
Martha Hudson was the only one who took exception to this behaviour and would always put Sherlock in his place with a few choice words and a
He laughed and Sherlock could smell the peppermint in the air from his toothpaste and taste the sweetness of his honeyed tea left lingering on his tongue.
“Oh, perfect. Could you refreshen mine while you’re at it? I’m sure Sherlock would love one, too. Gin and tonic, right?” She’d addressed this to Sherlock who nodded once before drifting away from them both as he played, stepping onto the cool grass with bare feet, long toes curling around the soft grass. John watched him go and grinned but it was anger behind the expression, not mirth. He was quickly growing tired of seeing Sherlock turn his back to him.
The small conversation he and John have in this chapter goes a little something like this: You okay? Yup, I'm okay. And then Greg alludes to Sherlock still being inside the studio. He also refers to John as a 'gaitanet' which is an endeared form of giatan, which is Gyspy. I have no idea if this is actually a thing, but to endear a word in French you can add either 'et' or 'ette' at the end (depending on gender) and so I kinda made it up. My mother is the French speaker, not me, I just know bastardized, basic vocab. Please tell me if I've failed at the small amounts of French in this chapter and I will fix it, post haste.
He sipped his coffee on the train, watching the smattering of other passengers sway in harmony to the jostle of the tracks, and smiled when the first light of the day greeted him with a warm kiss across his skin as he climbed out from the subterranean depths of New York’s underground.
John coughed again, though this time it was to cover up the fact that he’d just choked on nothing but his own spit and surprise.
Sherlock let go of the dog tags as if their weight hitting John’s skin symbolised the tactile end of the discussion. Or at least, that’s what John hoped. He began to untangle himself from the position he’d been lying in, no longer feeling comfortable on the bed. Sherlock sat up, concern painted across his face.
John’s brows creased at the sudden confession. It seemed as if Sherlock was attempting to connect with him on another level than just that of sexual attraction and compatibility. It endeared him to John further and he kissed the top of Sherlock’s head with soft lips, whispering condolences into the warm strands of his dark, shining hair.
“Oh, that was never the question.” Sherlock grinned as moved smoothly out from underneath John, only to cage him with his body on the bed. “As I said before, with you, John, I want everything.”
I couldn't stop myself from finishing this chapter and then further couldn't stop myself from posting it. Yay for mutli-chapter updates in one week!
The next week played out rather like what the American Navy SEAL’s lovingly referred to as "hell week
John bit his hip in response, chuckling against Sherlock’s stomach. The sensation caused goosebumps to spread out over his skin.
“You’ll spook. You’ll remember whatever it was that kept you from doing this months ago and if you attempt to shut me out again, so help me, I will--”
God damn his sentimental heart but he loved that ridiculous man. The renegade, piano-playing gypsy troubadour of a tease sitting across the stage oblivious to the hurricane of emotion that had been unleashed inside Sherlock’s heart not five minutes prior.
“Play me something,” he asked. He hadn’t expected to say such a thing, but once he had found the words he realised he wanted nothing more.
Both Sherlock and Siobhan reacted to the statement, but Sherlock beat his mother in response. “I suppose having
The hands holding onto John’s felt fierce and sharp, nails digging in deep with determination. Sherlock was willing John to see and feel that this wasn’t something fleeting, that he did not enter into this lightly, that this was important, and real, and necessary.
It was such a simple thing to say. A kindness John hadn’t expected. He sunk back down into the sheets, all the wind having left his sails in a veritable rush of surprising emotion.
My aunt had an encounter with him on the streets of New York back in the glorious days of ballet ruling the world. She was standing, waiting for the light to change on Fifth Avenue when she looked to her right and saw that this famous Russian Ballet star was standing next to her. She spluttered and flailed her arms in amazement before shouting, 'Baryshnikov!' Rudolf, being the gentleman that he was, simply smiled at her and gave her a deep bow with a grand sweep of his arm and said, 'Nureyev.' The light had turned green at the point and he walked off, and she stared in awe after him. I just love that story!
The boy stopped and turned, the rest of the group continuing around the corner at the end of the street. He lifted an eyebrow at Sherlock, a smirk clear on his face. It didn’t look cruel, however, and that startled Sherlock. Was he just being kind? Friendly? Flirtatious?
Instead of crumbling, or sighing, or tilting her head with a disgusting display of pity, she nodded, her lips thinning in a determined line. “Well fuck,” she said before tugging him into a tight hug he couldn’t bring himself to not to appreciate.
Mycroft’s hand slammed on the table, rattling the fine china in its chipped, mismatched saucers. “Will you desist with that language?”
“John,” he said, sad and small. The sound echoed softly in the room and then dissipated into the silence of the house. Sherlock had never felt more alone.
John blinked and turned his face around to look out the window. He watched the last of the day’s light sink low beneath the skyline in a final ripple of smoldering summer heat and a small spasm of pain John knew to be regret bloomed in his chest. The memories of the night that had so shifted Sherlock's opinion of John could never be changed and the circumstances that he found himself in at present would do nothing to alter the consequences that had occurred all those weeks ago. Three and a half, to be exact, but John certainly wasn’t counting.
In front of him, lightning bugs lit up the garden’s perimeter, a series of flickering fairy lights come to life. Somewhere in the distance beyond the protective borders of Mrs H’s garden, John could hear the sounds of taxi cabs honking and the far-off bustle of an underground train clanking rhythmically down the track, creating a perfect melody to the night and the most beautiful improvised piece of music he’d ever heard. He closed his eyes, laid back in the hammock and took in the experience of a true summer night in New York. He realised how much he’d been needing a home in that moment, and wondered if he’d actually been lucky enough to have found it at last.
If Sherlock had struggled over the past months with having John as a distraction in the studio while he sat quiet and sentinel behind him in the mirrors, he was surely going to set something on fire with the agitation burning inside him over having John placed front and center on stage during a live performance. He’d much prefer him being left to relative obscurity in the bowels of the pit with the rest of orchestra.
Everything about this production proved fascinating to John, but he couldn’t bring himself to call it a ballet, it was something entirely
Just as Sherlock hadn’t been mentally prepared for the awakening of his sexuality, John had been nowhere near ready for the onslaught of glorious attention Sherlock gave him once he’d ducked his head full of riotous curls between his thighs. All John could do was lay back, hands fisted into the tangles of his own hair, and will himself not to fall apart at the seams.
So, Irene is our (sorta) culprit! She really wasn't trying to hurt Sherlock, she just wanted those two boys to bone and well, Irene always did have a slightly warped sense of right and wrong.
Sherlock grimaced at the sight of Sarah tousling that ashy-blonde hair with what was assuredly an unnecessary amount of attention, making it more of a mess than normal and throwing his glasses askew. They laughed as John righted them, the sound trickling over the stage towards Sherlock like shards of shattered glass. He had to get out. He launched himself into the wings before he could allow himself to entertain the idea of tearing Sarah’s matte black fingernails off one by one a moment longer.
Sherlock had already crossed the foyer and was halfway up the stairs, the bag Mrs H had placed by his feet slung elegantly over his back by the time he’d interrupted John’s little speech, leaving the man stunned behind him. Sherlock was being cordial. How odd. John grabbed his music and reluctantly followed, feeling cowed.
John laughed, warm and gentle. “No, he isn’t.” His fingers trilled on the keys, filling the studio with flowery notes of springtime. Sherlock smiled. It sounded like flirting.
John smiled and slipped an arm around his waist, pulling him close. “Good. Because I like you,” he said, tugging them into the sea of bodies.
on stage at the theater across the square dressed in their new costumes of flat sneakers and carefully styled street clothes. They looked all the world like a bunch of teenagers heading to a drive-in to catch a double feature in small-town America as opposed to a group of professional and outstandingly talented ballet dancers, and that was exactly what Jerome Robbins wanted.
Sherlock ignored the interruption, “--leading a vagabond experience just because your father never approved of your lifestyle or your chosen profession.”
With that, Mr Baynes turned back to the front of the room and John sat back down on his piano bench, attempting (and failing) to hide a smirk of satisfaction from crossing his lips. He glanced up at Sherlock, unable to help himself and saw the man staring back at him, his eyes warm. John’s smile broadened. Sherlock mouthed the words, “well done,” and resumed his starting position. It was hard for John to do much else but smile for the rest of the night, he felt like he was floating on air at the day’s turn of events.
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,
“You heard me. It’s what I call it when young folk like you and Sherlock don’t act on your impulses and instead, sling insults or side-eyes at each other till one or both of you go mad. I see it all the time in the company.”
He felt like a voyeur, dirty and wrong, and yet he couldn’t look away. His hand gripped the door handle and pushed inside without his say so, his feet walked forward across the worn, wooden floorboards without his mental go-ahead and the toes of his oxford-covered shoes stopped inches from the ones of Sherlock’s right foot, pointing out towards him on the floor. John stood before the vision of Sherlock Holmes offered up to the world on a plastic folding chair at the back of a dance studio and couldn’t bring himself to feel guilty at the reasoning or the why of it, only knowing that once seen, John couldn’t stand behind the door that separated them a moment longer.
The only solace he had in this new, half-life balanced on a knife’s point was the announcement that they were doing a restaging of a Jerome Robbins ballet from the late 50’s entitled
Mycroft straightened his tie, his forehead boasting a sheen that hadn’t been there several minutes prior.
When Sherlock sunk to his knees, all of John’s thoughts fizzled to a crisp, eradicated from his mind by the devastating sight of Sherlock in all his proud, singular beauty kneeling down before him.
“Sherlock.” John stared directly into his eyes, refusing to look elsewhere. “You were . . . you were never . . .” his voice failed him and he ran a hand over his haggard face, shoving his glasses into his hair. “I would stay for you.”
The audience roared with applause and Sherlock grinned, breaking away to return John's wink before turning towards his fellow dancers and rejoining their ranks. John somehow managed to keep playing a syncopated beat on the keys, maintaining a rhythm for them to move by, and the final piece played on with a new level of added intensity present in the choreography. That kiss had spurred something in the dancers, sparking a hormone-laced frenzy that ignited the movement beyond the telling of a story, to the burning of an eternal feeling of youth and love and freedom. Sherlock finally knew what Mrs H had meant; this was the feeling she’d told them to seek out. His body sung with its presence in his veins.
“God, yes.” John pulled him down with both arms, and Sherlock tumbled inelegantly over the sheets, laughing. He felt free, loose, and perfectly present in that moment, narrowing all of his focus down to John’s lips, warm, wet, and perfect against Sherlock’s own.
Sherlock turned into a statue in front of John, his mind falling elsewhere, attempting to riddle out what John had inferred. Sherlock’s pale eyes focused on John and yet looked right through him, beyond him at something only Sherlock could see.
When in London, Siobhan Holmes always insisted on having tea at The Criterion on Piccadilly. Her mother had taken her there for tea and her mother’s mother had taken her before that, it was a tradition in the family and probably the only tradition Siobhan ever bothered following in her life.
“You’re going to kill me,” he rasped out, his voice nothing but gravel and sand. Sherlock had the gall to grin in response and run his tongue along the lip of John’s erection, pulling back the foreskin with his delicate, pale fingers, revealing his hard length fully to Sherlock’s eyes for the first time.
,” John whispered through his teeth. His body tensed under the surprising new touch, the muscles of his thighs straining and the inward dip of his stomach going taught with his inhaled breath.
It appeared to John as if Sherlock were melting into the seat of the chair, his arms hanging limply at his sides and his head lolled back, resting on the lower barre behind him on the wall, with acres of porcelain skin inching downwards towards those tight black trunks slung low on his hips. John watched the dip of Sherlock’s Adam’s apple make its way up and down along the pale, sweat-slicked skin of his throat as he swallowed a gulp of air into his heaving chest, and John licked his lips at how indecent it seemed.
“So, you couldn’t stand another moment of being indoors? Did your gypsy soul finally catch up with you and beckon you out into the great unknown?”
A trickling tease of a melody soon turned into a pounding cacophony of sound. John played until the hairs at the nape of his neck clung together with sweat and a droplet ran down under the collar of his shirt along the line of his backbone to settle at the base of his spine. He played until his fingers went numb from the consistent pressure forced upon them and continued working on muscle memory alone, allowing the music to play him, to use his body as means of creation.
As the sun reached its zenith in the blazing August sky, Sherlock sought the shelter of a local theater. He sat in the creaking, antique seats, soaking in the blessed air conditioning for the rest of the day with a bucket of popcorn on his lap that he barely touched, watching a double-feature of two old Hitchcock classics and sipping too much Coke.
Sherlock sat down in the dingy booth of a pub in St. Andrews, his back pressing in hard along the mahogany, the wood having turned black from years of cigarette and pipe and coal smoke caressing the close space of the room’s walls. It was humid with the heat of too many bodies inside the pub and Sherlock had long since stripped off his coat, only leaving him the option of unbuttoning his collar and rolling shirt sleeves for relief.
Sherlock tore his eyes away from the rapt attention he was giving John’s trousers and the very distinct outline drawn across his pelvis and hip for only a moment before lifting his long, elegant fingers to bring them to the zip at John’s waist. “I’ve always been curious,” he said with all the measured madness of a scientist dissecting a new specimen.
And if Paganini ever failed, Sherlock knew that John was there take him to bed and play him like his favorite Coltrane piece, or a riff of Davis, or a trill of Baker, an eight-count of Monk, or a reprise of Brubeck. Forever reminding Sherlock of those first few months together living through the Brooklyn heat and the sounds of soothing summer jazz.
of her tongue. It endeared her to John to no end, and he was sure to make his respect and affection for her known. She was the mother he never had and the spit-fire boss he vowed he would never cross. The fear of disappointing her lead him to swallow his urges regarding ever leaving once he'd been given a full-time position. No matter how much he wanted to pick up and go wherever chance took him, Martha Hudson (or Mrs H, as the company lovingly called her) kept his head out of the clouds and his hands continually dancing on the black n' white keys.
Stumbling forward with too much momentum, he turned the misstep into a somersault of a tumble, landing at the footlights and throwing his arms wide, much to the audience’s delight. They clapped and hollered at his display before he leapt up and rejoined his fellow dancers snapping to the music behind him.
anywhere,” John remarked, sudden and with an air of surprise to his voice. He was in his head, far away from Sherlock, pondering thoughts deeper than those of commitment and shipping prices. Sherlock placed his hands on John’s strong shoulders, felt the muscles flex beneath his palms, and pulled him in.
The voice came as a rumble of sound from the pile of sheets and pillows and limbs behind him. John turned and smiled at the mess of his bed and the man lying on top of it in a languid line of pale, naked skin. Sherlock stretched his arm out, eyes still closed, his long fingers reaching blindly for John.
Sherlock leaned against the cool, stone walls of what would be his home for the next three years located on a back alleyway someone deceptively and idiotically decided to name Floral Street. The only flowers he’d come across in the cement jungle of theaters and tourist cafes that made up Covent Garden were the peonies on the front desk inside the doors he’s just walked out of a moment ago, and those had seen better days, in his opinion.
John huffed out a startled laugh as he fell into the soft seat, his eyes alight with excitement and the single, blatant question of
Sherlock had always been immune to this phenomenon, never once having to deal with the internal frustration of missing a beat or fumbling a step during a performance . . . that is, until the opening night of
John laughed. “Christ, I think Molly would die if you kissed her like the way you kissed me this morning.”
It was all Sherlock said by way of conversation. John’s fingers danced over the rough surface of the thrown-clay pottery in his hands, playing unnamed tunes to the beat of his erratic heart. He waited. He breathed. Sherlock remained silent.
It had been two weeks since John had awoken in the hammock in Mrs H’s backyard and was greeted by the sight of Sherlock in the grass with fresh coffee on the table. It was the only interaction the two men had in all that time, outside of the occasional greetings they’d share at home or when their eyes would lock for fleeting, heated moments in the rehearsal studio mirrors. Sherlock would always be the first to look away and John would push his fingers harder into the ivory keys beneath him, pouring his feelings into the piano to keep from bolting through the door and ripping his hair out from finally being driven mad by the man.
He’d kept his distance from John after the club incident, not because of what Mycroft had said that dark morning standing over Molly’s small kitchen counter with a cup of too-hot coffee in his hand he had no intention of drinking, but because Sherlock had been ashamed of his own brazen nature. He hadn’t expected himself to be that forward, or daring, or . . . no, that wasn’t even it. Sherlock had never expected to want anything as much as he wanted John Watson, and the realisation hit him so hard and so fast he couldn’t make sense of it - he couldn’t cope. And so, instead, he buried his head in the sand.
Sherlock had reached the age of twenty-six having never wanted to share a secret smile with anyone if he hadn’t been pretending while dancing on a stage in full costume with hot lights beating down on his brow. And now, here he was, standing at the barre in the epicenter of his world and John Watson was sitting behind him sending him a smile over the hood of the piano. It was a staggering and life-altering realisation to know what it felt like to finally be happy.
Mycroft attempted to straighten a tie that wasn’t there. He looked flushed and pallid all at once, and Sherlock grinned at his success.
She placed her gloves and hat on the table, expecting the waiter to pick up both for her and rest them on a nearby hook. When this action was accomplished with relative ease in an acceptable span of time, she smiled, feeling the day had finally settled into place. Her two boys sat before her, one with perfect posture and bespoke waistcoat, the other with a scowl and a slouch. She nudged Sherlock’s foot beneath the table. He perked up a centimeter in response.
Mrs H graced the company with her presence (finally) five minutes into their pre-performance warm-up class on the theatre’s stage. She whistled at her dancers with a haughty grin and gave them a small speech on embracing the moment and living through the movement as if they truly were all teenagers on the brink of exploring their newly-found sexual natures.
For shites and giggles, here's one of the most erotic (read: my favorite) parts of Howl, the Ginsberg poem mentioned in the chapter. Also, if you haven't read Howl in its entirety, wtf? It's legendary. Go read it. Now.
Sherlock saw nothing but smiles and white, gleaming teeth as the heavy, weighted curtains parted to allow for one curtain-call, then two, then three. Mr Baynes walked out on stage with several stagehands, holding a bouquet for every female dancer and shaking the hands of each male dancer in turn. He swept his arm, gesturing to the orchestra and the Maestro, who stood and bowed deeply before extending his arms to John up on stage. John brought himself up to his full height with what Sherlock could see were slightly uneasy legs, the din of the continual applause no-doubt zapping him of his performance-filled adrenaline. He bowed once, twice, then sat down hard on the piano bench, shaking his head and laughing at the humbling, yet no doubt, overwhelming experience.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was worried, restrained yet urgent, and Sherlock despised him for sounding so concerned. He didn't deserve it.
“Sherlock,” he whispered. “Please let me.” He was moving them backward, towards the door of his room to the right of the mantle that marked the dividing line of their separate spaces. Sherlock’s arms wrapped around John, encircling him in the humid warmth of his water-damp skin. They fumbled and groped at each other in the dark room, laughing into each other’s mouths at every stumble.
There were many unanswered questions from that night and with Sherlock barely speaking to him, John doubted he’d ever get the answers. He dropped his head back onto the hammock and stared above him at the navy velvet sky, void of stars, yet infinite in its beauty. The moon hung off to the right, a calming presence in the darkness, smiling back down at John with its lopsided grin and cratered face. He watched it as the music drifted over him, a fugue, full of the ferocity and brilliance Sherlock brought to all things. Mrs H clapped as he finished the piece with a fermata*, dragging out the note long and slow and painfully perfect.
A few of the apprentices had put together an impromptu pub crawl of sorts to celebrate and the ladies of the group had pulled John along by his lapels, lamenting the ‘lack of cock’ amongst them. John had laughed at the joke, feeling perfectly fine with being objectified if it meant a good time with the good-looking people he’d worked so hard with over the past weeks.
Once outside in the balmy July night, which thankfully held a slight breeze to cool their skin, John grabbed for his phone in his back pocket, pulling up a car ride app.
John’s ire was directed at none other than Mycroft, who stood across from them in a severe grey pinstripe, avoiding the streams of afternoon light slicing across the carpet as if he’d burn from their touch. John’s abrupt (and perfectly reasonable) response to Mycroft’s unannounced arrival and subsequent bearing of bad tidings in terms of Sherlock’s future, left the two of them silently assessing one another with calculating stares.
A sense of levity settled over the pair of them. The heaviness from earlier at the mention of John’s father, which had threatened to stain the soft glow of the easy afternoon, dissipated on a gentle breeze behind a flutter of the gauzy curtain.
Sherlock hummed to himself and walked further into the room, his hands clasped behind his back. Just in front of him were two five-paneled, dark wood doors on either side of a fireplace with an ornate marble mantel and carved wooden hearth surround. Sherlock picked the door on the right, pulling it open with an exaggerated flourish - being cordial was one thing, but it seemed that Sherlock Holmes could not help being a dramatic git no matter what circumstance. John moved past him with a small nod of
, which John instantly cherished, much to Sherlock’s displeasure. He couldn’t remember reading anything by this Ginsberg person was back in school, nor did he understand why a book of dry poetry was so astounding to John.
There was a presence at his back. John could feel the warmth that wasn’t his own move close to him, could hear the labored breathing that wasn’t his own pushed out from flared nostrils behind him.
- Tobias Baynes is a little easter egg of a character created out of two of ACD originals: Inspector Tobias Gregson and Inspector Baynes. In the original stories, Tobias calls Lestrade a fool, so boo to him (since BBC Lestrade is so utterly wonderful and Rupert is rather dashing) but I love the name Tobias, it means 'Little Toby' and isn't that just adorable?
Eyeing the gilded floor length mirror that flanked the entire left-hand wall of the entrance way and the fragile-looking wooden spindles framed in mahogany that arched above him made John beg to differ on that aspect, but he was grateful for Mrs H’s reassurance and tried his best to let the tension leave his shoulders as he took in his surroundings.
Catching on, John’s tentative hand fisted into Sherlock’s tangles and tugged. Sherlock moaned, his entire body arching towards the sensation, his skin prickling with heat. Sherlock’s cheek was damp where it rested on John’s pelvis, the humidity of the room growing with every pant of breath, every pull of his mouth. Sherlock leaned up on his elbow and nuzzled his nose along the soft hair at the base of John’s cock, breathing John in and swallowing him down as far as he dared. John cursed above him on the bed, his hips pushing into the mattress, his thighs shaking.
“Sherlock?” The boy was suspiciously absent though Martha could hear violin music coming from upstairs. She nodded to herself, satisfied that her charge was safely ensconced in his own world for the evening and went to roll herself a marijuana cigarette with the latest ‘chronic’ her neighbor Jerrold had provided her with - the darling man. She would be needing some herbal assistance to steady herself for the onslaught of verbal abuse her young prodigy would no doubt soon be hurling at her when he learned the news that they would no longer be a two-person household, but three.
It was a picture of him and Sherlock dancing on Friday. Well, dancing was a loose term for what it appeared they were doing. Sherlock’s knees were bent, his hips pressed hard against John’s, practically riding his thigh and his head was tucked into John’s shoulder while John licked a stripe along Sherlock’s exposed neck. John’s eyes were closed and he looked wrecked in the best possible way in that moment. It was overwhelming to see an outsider’s perspective and he felt his face flush at the brazen nature of the picture.
Sherlock used his mouth and tongue and fingers and teeth how he thought John would like, never once relenting or holding back, determined to make John feel good. Judging by the constant, low-growl of a moan rumbling out of John’s chest, Sherlock suspected he was doing well.
A warm, wet heat touched the tip of his cock and John’s head flew up from the leather chair back, his vision landing immediately on the image of Sherlock Holmes between his taut, strained thighs with his eyes closed and a crease of concentration present between his eyebrows as he tasted John’s skin. John had to remind himself to breathe.
Sherlock hadn't been prepared for the overwhelming feelings he had when he was around John, how his pulse would quicken and he'd end up fiddling with his hands, leeching out anxious energy through every fingertip, or how often he’d seek out John's face in the studio’s mirrors with flushed cheeks and bated breath. He surprised himself with how frequently he’d pace back and forth across the floorboards outside John's bedroom door since he’d moved into Mrs H’s house. It’d been easier with John only being around during his workdays with the company, but now, with him not only sharing a roof but a bloody wall with Sherlock, his need to seek out the man had only grown more urgent.
He felt ridiculous for his erratic jealousy, but emotions concerning other people were rather new to him and having them flood his system all at once was an overwhelming experience he’d yet to comprehend.
Sherlock had just completed the closing performance of a two-month-long world tour without John at his side. His flight to Edinburgh had been scheduled to leave three hours after the final curtain call. Their time apart had been a shock to Sherlock’s system, having grown so used to John, his quiet presence, his affections, the sound of his piano coming alive with John’s fevered, impassioned playing. Going weeks on end without the comforts of home, without the comforts of
had been a masterstroke, and they’d only just gotten started. Beside her on the teak garden table lay a series of costume designs for the dancers and a bare-bones set for the production that would rely heavily on dramatic lighting cues more than scenery. It all left her pleased as punch, and the new chronic Jerrold had provided her with was doing wonders for her nerves.
What greeted him once the large, arched doorway yawned open was not what John expected in the slightest. In fact, the sight of dark curls and a narrowed, scathing gaze staring out of an impossibly pale and sharp face was so startling to him, he balked in surprise, almost dropping his things.
Mycroft’s threats did nothing to quell Sherlock’s interest in John. In fact, it would probably only spur him to seek the man out more than he’d dared allow himself to before. Some sort of latent, rebellious streak left over from his endlessly coddled and carefully cultivated youth reared its ugly, theoretically-mohawked head whenever Mycroft lorded himself over Sherlock’s life.
That final word seemed to echo out into the early afternoon haze drifting in through the open windows. Those two syllables that were spoken so simply and yet John knew the implication behind them; Sherlock was stating another fact. He was not asking, he knew it as a truth before John even realised it was a possibility. The thought did not make him angry or feel caged, instead, it made him smile.
The slate sidewalk beneath his feet and the cast iron scrawled railings leading up the steps to the front door landing added to the anachronistic sense of timelessness and he climbed up slowly, taking in the grandeur with a steadying breath before finally ringing the buzzer at the door. He adjusted the bags hanging off his shoulders and the crates of sheet music in his hands as he waited, feeling horribly out of place.
. . . “ John repeated as he watched the studio door close behind the confounding woman. “What just happened?”
“But you can kiss,” John said, his mind latching on to the most trivial of thoughts. He knew full well that Sherlock’s tongue had talents beyond that of a novice.
Sherlock had never adhered to such superstition, but he’d readily admit that performing to an empty theater one afternoon and then suddenly being faced with a packed house full of warm, breathing, energy-filled bodies that same evening would cause a shift in atmosphere that could (and often did) throw the less seasoned performers off their game.
John huffed and ran a hand through his hair. “What?” The bark of a question was as close to snapping as he’d come.
“Oh, well. I think he’s embarrassed?” Molly shrugged and offered John a sad smile. It did nothing to quell his anger at the ass over tea kettle situation.
“Hullo, John,” Sherlock said, without moving from his catatonic state, somehow knowing it was John who had interrupted this private moment and was uncharacteristically accepting of his sudden appearance.
John laughed again, and it was a beautiful sound and Sherlock beamed for having caused such a reaction in John that he’d make that glorious sound. He immediately wanted to hear that sound again, and often, and always.
John made to leave the room and Sherlock panicked, his arms reaching, hands grasping for a hold on John, but he wrenched his hand free from Sherlock’s grasp. The pain Sherlock had caused was painted across John’s face in violent, dark strokes. They were etched deeply between his eyes and around his mouth.
I've been creating some fan art for other stories on here that I love and I'm realizing that it'd be fun to have some illustrations of this story (other than the one that sparked its creation, of course) and I figured I'd leave it up to you guys. What scenes/bits would you like to see illustrated? Then again, if you don't care about such things, ignore me. lol.
John shifted, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. “Oh yes, you are, your face is saying a lot.”
Irene broke the growing tension in the room with a dramatic sigh even Sherlock would be proud of and tossed the phone into the air. Sherlock caught it easily and opened the lock screen to study its contents. John shuffled forward and leaned over his shoulder. Sherlock allowed it. John couldn’t help his small smile.
More gasps and a few claps of happy surprise echoed around them. It seemed John’s sass had just earned him a promotion.
Too intrigued to wonder at Greg’s odd behavior, John inched his way towards the studio door, feeling oddly like he was about to witness something that wasn’t meant for his eyes to see. When he reached the door and peered in through the small window, he had to hold back from audibly gasping at what greeted him - the sight of Sherlock Holmes’ long, lean body sprawled in a folding chair.
John smiled down at his hands resting on top of the piano keys as his fanciful thoughts ran away with him. He may be slightly biased but he didn’t care.
The plan for next winter flew out the window the moment Mycroft's aristocratic forehead began to show the sheen of his overly active sweat glands. Sherlock knew that immediate action was necessary, if anything for his own sanity. He hastily typed up two e-mails while tearing down Piccadilly at a steady clip, his curls falling into his eyes as he pushed his long legs forwards and onwards. One was sent to Martha Hudson and one to his brother. Each one contained a press release, both with very different outcomes. In Martha's, there was the announcement of Sherlock joining the company sooner than planned, and in Mycroft's, there was the devastating news of one Sherlock Holmes, brother to the oh, so influential Mycroft Holmes, checking into rehab in disgrace for a multitude of sins.
“Shit.” John angrily punched in the address to Molly’s flat, not knowing where Sherlock lived. Recreational drug use on a night off was one thing, but this situation was fucked.
In the last few moments before their cue, Sherlock rolled his sleeves up to his shoulders, seeking some sense of relief from the backstage heat. His fingers itched at his sides and his toes wiggled in their shoes; he wanted to be onstage, he wanted to dance. He wanted to see John.
"Sherlock, be kind." Siobhan took a sip of tea, her eyes sharp despite the softness of her tone. Sherlock gave her wrist a slight squeeze of affection before retiring his hands to his own lap.
John blinked at him, seemingly confounded. “Did you . . . sleep on the floor?” Before Sherlock could even raise an eyebrow in response, John interrupted him with a raised hand. “No, wait. It doesn’t matter. Get up. It’s half eleven.”
The sounds of the company’s clapping roused Sherlock from the silence that fell around him as he focused solely on John. Sherlock wanted John to see every emotion he’d been too cowardly to express over the past few days in eyes. He wanted to tell him everything and yet a stage, twelve dancers, one ballet master, a company director, and an entire orchestra sat between them like an ocean's worth of his own mistakes. Sherlock screamed inside, his leg muscles breaking into movement from their inertia to bring him closer to John.
There was only half-melted ice left swirling in the glass clasped in John's palm when he looked down to inspect its contents. He envied it - wanting to melt and slip away himself. The music was cutting into him, pulling out deep-rooted emotions he’d worked tirelessly to keep hidden. How dare Sherlock do this to him without even looking at him, or even being near him. His violin held more power than he realised and John found himself standing from the hammock, free hand clenching into a fist. He needed space. He needing air that did not include the lingering presence of Sherlock and his damn violin.
Sherlock blinked down at the man, his mind suddenly zeroing in on his anger with a blinding, irrational rage. “Excuse me?”
“Your legs are impossible,” John said this with a slap to Sherlock’s pale thigh, needing a distraction to break the growing tension.
Sherlock stilled on the first step of the staircase, his fingers tensing against the balustrade. He stared down at his hand on the cool, wooden surface, watching his knuckles whiten with strain. “What are you doing here?”
John paused to take in the sight of Sherlock’s alabaster skin, the slight sheen covering his body left over from the shower, and watch the gentle shivers that overcame him, causing his erect cock to bob proudly against his stomach.
“Being a musician, and a traveling one at that, isn’t exactly something my father was proud of, no.”
“The fans work well enough.” Sherlock gestured to yet another door and John opened it to reveal a smaller antechamber, no doubt the closet. Inside sat three upright fans waiting to be used.
Sherlock hummed and picked up the tags as John played with a lock of his wild, tangled hair. The two of them were magnetized towards each other, John lying higher up on the pillow, his left arm supporting his head while Sherlock rested in the space beside him looking upwards towards the ceiling, long fingers cradling the silver tags with interest.
Sherlock watched John’s world crumble as he paced the carpet before him and some small part of him relished the power he held over the man at that moment. The rest of him burned with self-loathing at ever making John Watson feel inferior. Despite his internal remorse, he prodded further.
Lifting a leg onto the top barre, he bent over, bringing his arm above his head to reach and grab onto his toes, relishing the warmth blooming through his body as he worked and stretched and prepared himself for morning class. He always preferred to be the first one in the studio for classes, to enjoy the silence of the room and the blessed freshness of the air before all those bodies tainted the atmosphere with their sweat and damp clothes and damn bleeding feet.
Sherlock savored the feeling of John’s smile on his lips and each hot puff of laughter against his mouth. He was eager to drink in the sensation of John’s warm body flush with his own, the soft feel of his cotton shirt against Sherlock’s bare chest, and the pressure of John’s perfect fingertips pressing into the line of Sherlock’s spine. He wanted to be an instrument for John to play, a set of keys for him to pull sweet notes from and turn them into an endless rhythm that would echo throughout his body long after John's hands had left his skin.
He smiled down at the impossible man and pulled off his shirt before stepping towards the bed. The familiar weight of his father’s dog tags slapped against his skin as they fell from being caught on the lip of his tee once he’d tugged it off his head. Sherlock opened his eyes just as the light glinted off the dull, aged silver. He had noticed them the night before, of course, and many times before that he’d spied the beaded chain along the back of John’s neck peeking out just above the collar of his shirt. He simply hadn’t had the time to pay attention to them before now.
as opposed to true Jazz, this ballet needed a new defining word, something transitional and fluid that evoked the singularity of the choreography. John would ask Sherlock if he could think of anything, knowing the brilliance of his mind, he’d certainly have a couple of appropriate words or terms floating around up there to call this moving piece of breathtaking art.
He sagged at the piano bench, his curls coming to rest along the white pages of John’s hand-scrawled music, the sheets cool and crisp beneath his forehead. He could read the notes easily enough, but would only ever want for John to play them. If he closed his eyes he could hear their ghostly echo in the room, resonating in the wood, the walls, and vibrating through the keys beneath his fingertips. He breathed in deep and exhaled, feeling uncharacteristically idle.
“Yes, John. She set you up in these rooms with the specific intention that you utilize the piano. Though, if you insist on banging out that insipid jazz you’re always going on about, I may have to poison your tea.”
Sherlock blinked, breaking the spell. The boy faced forward once more, shaking his head back and forth - Sherlock realised he was laughing. Laughing at what? Him? He pushed away from the wall and shouted, “Hey!”
John nodded, despite the fact that Sherlock’s eyes remained closed as he leaned steady and silent against the gently swaying tree at his back. John attempted to maneuver himself out of the hammock without further incident but he stumbled on his right foot as he went, the hammock flying up behind him in an embarrassing display he was sure Sherlock did not miss.
Mr Baynes proved himself to be a drill sergeant but he was also encouraging in the most emphatic of ways. No matter what he was trying to convey, a compliment or a correction, everything was shouted.
That night proved to be more of a disaster than John originally thought, considering Sherlock’s reaction to him when the company resumed work on Tuesday. Or, his lack of reaction. The man burst into the studio with all the fury and defiance of a soldier entering enemy territory, his aristocratic nose was high in the air and his razor-edged wit sharp on his tongue. He spoke to no one that day other than to insult them, and even snapped at Mrs H for taking too long to explain an adagio sequence, to the astonishment of the entire class. Mrs H smiled at him, declared that his behavior was suspect, and told him to take a ‘fresh air’ break, to which he rolled his eyes. She clapped her hands to get his attention, held his gaze, and within five seconds Sherlock was turning on his heel and heading out the door.
“The rehearsals,” John offered with a sly grin he couldn’t hide. He knew certainly well the reason Sherlock was still snoring away upstairs wasn’t only because of the week’s grueling rehearsal schedule, but because he hadn’t let the man rest till dawn broke across the sleeping sky and brought with it a dash of light to their new reality. A reality in which John Watson could hold Sherlock Holmes in his arms and not fear that the man would run away like some over-excitable racehorse at every footfall or chuckle of red-lipped laughter.
