(pointing to photo)
Good.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
It's you! You with the erection, Sherlock!
Lestrade, completely distracted by the telly, doesn't respond.
(sigh)
Sherlock...
(suddenly remembering)
(laughing)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
No, I wasn't, not at all.
"You okay?" John asked with concern.
That's --
The last thing I want to do is go into hiding again.
SHERLOCK
John glowers at her and Irene grins a bit evilly back at him. Sherlock sighs with irritation but continues to work, sniffing and searching.
Like you have anything to compare it to. How many engorged penises have you actually come across in your life, John?
Sherlock pulls Lestrade down the steps. Lestrade turns and waves back to Audrey.
Rosie starts climbing the stairs to their flat.
Molly sets down her phone with a smile.
Thank you, Sherlock.
All weekend long you've been up in my face, looming over me, glued to my side! I am sick of it!
What about you, Rosie? Hungry? Want to stop for fish and chips on the way home?
"So, you’re just going to go right up to people and ask 'Do you come here often?'” John asked incredulously.
MOLLY
Then you and John make a decision whether to break up and go your separate ways, or if you decide to give the relationship more time.
MEDIC #1
DR HERSCHER
Oink! Oink!
So... cocaine contaminating the lotion, eh? Do we know where it originates?
You don't know! What do you mean, you don't know?!
"John?" Sherlock said in astonishment.
John...
Sherlock dims the light. He leans over and kisses John sweetly four, five, six times. Each time John gets a little more into it, his desire growing. John's hand is entangled in Sherlock's curls by the end. Sherlock abruptly stops and smiles.
God, yes.
(pause)
Happy to oblige.
(with furrowed brow)
No need to panic, only a small heart episode.
Yes, that was very bad form of me, wasn't it? Young children thrive in a stable home environment, and I've certainly failed to provide that this week.
Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
(yelling)
SHERLOCK
No. Not really.
SHERLOCK
Yes, but I suspect we'll be a little too eager to get you all the way undressed first. You'll still have one of your tight button-ups on... the sexy purple one, I think.
(with a coy smile)
I’ve been looking forward to this one in particular. The sales clerk went to great lengths explaining how it could be used to stimulate one's partner externally or internally.
Sherlock breathes erratically and clutches at his chest. John finally turns and notices. He rushes over to him.
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - ENTRANCE WAY - CONTINUOUS
John rushes off with the trolley.
(with a bitter chortle)
Hello? Anyone here?
It's okay. Now, put your head up here.
It's Sherlock's day to pick up Rosie from school. He cheerfully straps her into her stroller outside the school entrance.
(getting calmer)
We're doing a stir fry, so these vegetables need to be chopped. To do that you'll need to --
Only in case of an extreme emergency.
Where was I? Okay Rosie, we'll get you changed and head out for a stroll around the block. Maybe we'll bug Mrs. Hudson for a biscuit on the way out. How does that sound?
Hey! I was supposed to do that part!
It is.
(surprised, a little coyly)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock closes his eyes slowly and presses his fingertips to his lips again.
ADLER:  YES I KNOW
Well, not this April. Hence the requisite wellies for proper puddle splashing.
SHERLOCK
ROSIE (O.S.)
MRS HUDSON
Understood.
Sherlock!
I apologize for what I can only presume was his completely beastly behavior.
I will miss working with you. I wish you well, Ella.
SHERLOCK
Doesn't she have a whole roster of pediatric patients?
That bullet wound...
As you wish.
I like to feel a bit constricted.
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
I mean, we know you don't HAVE to jump in the sack right away... but geez, could you pick up the pace a smidgen, you two? This is taking forever!
(fidgeting)
(shaking head)
AUDREY
(wheels turning)
SHERLOCK
MOLLY
And if looking after my daughter is inconveniencing you so much, I'll go ask Mrs. Hudson to watch her.
Couldn't you just say stop when you need me to?
You haven't moved since we left and that was hours ago. Deep in thought?
Sherlock takes another biscuit, flops onto the sofa, and crunches it noisily. He looks over at John and his expression changes from annoyance to intense desire.
Oh John!
(with a twinkle in his eye)
I’m happy to get this out in time for the holidays. Happy Holidays, everyone. I hope to have the next chapter for you February 2021.
SHERLOCK
Just hold on. Your eggs are almost ready, Rosie darling.
Let's go investigate. We'll be detectives... how about that? But you have to be quiet.
Sherlock quietly considers the situation for a moment.
John licks his lips and nods. Sherlock slowly pushes the head of his cock into John's anus. They both moan in unison at the penetration.
Working? Looks like you're lazing about, is what is looks like.
INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - JOHN'S OFFICE - THURSDAY - DAY
Sherlock presses his body weight against John, pinning him to the shower wall as the water continues to cascade down them both. John puts a forearm against the shower wall for support, granting Sherlock enough access to his groin. Sherlock reaches around to grasp John's cock and begins stroking it back and forth, as he slides his own cock up and down the length of John's cleft.
What about having your best friend's wife shoot you? Or, even worse, getting your best friend's wife killed?
SHERLOCK
Damn it! Sneaky bastard found my outfit hanging in Mrs. Hudson's flat... and now he's giving me unsolicited fashion advice.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
ROSIE (V.O.)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock snaps his head around to face John, fixing him with a sharp stare.
Sherlock turns and looks quizzically at John, but John is already hurrying out of the room. Sherlock and Irene share a look.
Em, not as much.
SHERLOCK
Ohh... you mean, in the bedroom?
SHERLOCK
(holding up the dildo)
Make them tighter?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock steps sideways so that he is standing shoulder to shoulder with John. Sherlock slides his hand down John's back, over his bum, and into the back pocket of John's jeans to annoy him.
Sherlock gives the toy a small twist. John's knees nearly buckle.
SHERLOCK
It is Molly's turn to look chuffed as Nazir regards her with affection.
Jesus, Sherlock! Yes, another finger... but do be gentle, I beg you.
John shuffles to the center of the bed, spreading his legs wide, and watches Sherlock making his way towards him.
The evening of the "minor stakeout" arrived, and Lupita, Rosie, and Sherlock waited in the sitting room (Lupita impatiently so) while John finished getting dressed upstairs. When he at last made it downstairs, John's appearance made Sherlock's mouth go dry. He was indeed wearing his black shirt, although the top two buttons were left undone, giving him a rakish look. The jeans he wore were new and fit him very well, the rich indigo setting off the black shirt nicely. And to Sherlock's surprise, his shoes were brand new, too: handsome black Chelsea boots. John raked a hand through his silver hair, giving it a sexy-but-still-put-together tousled look, then he put his hands on his hips and looked at Sherlock expectantly. Sherlock swallowed hard before answering.
Sherlock obliges, picking up the pace of his strokes: from tip to base, and back up. John moans loudly.
ROSIE
Sherlock's. Sherlock's body language.
MOLLY
John taps and rubs lightly over Sherlock's entrance. His other hand continues to stroke Sherlock's cock rhythmically.
SHERLOCK
With one hand grazing John's waistband, Sherlock makes a full circle around John in order to analyze him from every angle.
SHERLOCK
(sighs)
(murmuring in his ear)
evident attraction to him almost more than Sherlock could bear. This attraction, this connection, was not as hopelessly one-sided as Sherlock had long believed, and Sherlock struggled to keep himself from getting lost in his thoughts—there would be time for that later, right now
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
Hm. It seems to work, though.
(calling after)
What's on your mind today, Sherlock?
You are rushing things. It can take a long time for a person to know how they feel about someone, especially when it comes to love.
Sherlock let his phone fall to his chest and gave out a pining-filled sigh.
MRS HUDSON
But first...
SHERLOCK
Yes, yes she is. Single. And smart, and cute, and charming. My whole plan today was for you two to get to know each other better. But...
SHERLOCK
He softly makes his way out of bed and into the bathroom.
MRS HUDSON
You mean this "John"?
But this seems to be more of a... problem of a physical nature.
(sighing, calmly)
But he rose too quickly and thus wobbled, falling back to his seat, clearly not sober enough to walk unsupported.
Did it ever occur to you, dear, that I might be getting too old to be bringing your tea upstairs every day?
Sherlock places his left hand on the base of John's cock and gives the bell end a quick lick. John's breath hitches and his hips pop up off the bed in response.
"I'm going to make some tea. Want any?" he offered.
A boost to your confidence...
(chiding himself)
Oh, I see. That's right. John Watson, trend setter.
(puckishly)
SHERLOCK
"I know." John's voice sounded as far off as his thoughts. There was a pause in conversation as the room filled with the sound of Rosie's squeals and wooden blocks clattering to the floor.
(with a dismissive wave)
Errrrr. Not well. Ms. Adler got a bit snippy.
"What do you want to do, then? You already made it clear you weren't interested in dancing. Unless you’ve changed your mind?"
Good choice.
I don't know if Sherlock can hold you right now, Rosie.
AUDREY
Well, I know how you like to experiment...
Can't deduce it, hmmm? Oh, my dear Sherlock... that must be driving you mad.
(shaking head)
I'm a visual learner, John. Please, show me.
Right.
I'm not about to let you suffer like that. Now, lie down. I'll go to the loo to tidy myself up.
SHERLOCK
That bullet went nowhere near my heart!
(sighing)
(avoiding the question)
(furious)
SHERLOCK
ADLER:  YOU NEED SOMETHING BIG. HIGH STAKES WITH AMPLE CHANCE TO FLIRT
MRS HUDSON
Yeah, good luck with that.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Jesus, it makes me moan just thinking about it.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock gives him an extra-long kiss and reaches down to stroke John's penis. John groans in Sherlock's mouth.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John heads out the door. Sherlock puts Rosie right side up and brings her to the window. They watch John begin jogging down the sidewalk.
SHERLOCK
"I never know how to respond," admitted John.
Sherlock groans lightly and tosses his head in his sleep. John gets a wicked grin on his face.
Well, I hear congratulations are in order.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Still, it seems it is time we gave up our habit of you bringing me my tea. I will miss it dearly. The tea and the company. You keeping tabs on me.
Don't fight it, John. I feel you tightening against my fingers. I feel how hard you are right now. Do not fight it.
John stands in the bedroom facing the bed, sternly, like a soldier. The light from the bathroom pools on his face. Sherlock enters through the bedroom door only wearing black underpants. He pauses momentarily, struck by how fantastic John looks. He closes the door quietly and walks directly up to John, pressing his bare chest against John's back. Sherlock kisses and licks John's neck and shoulder greedily. Sherlock wraps one arm around John's torso holding him in place, while the other hand reaches into John's pants fondling John's hardness. John tries to remain stock still, but he closes his eyes with pleasure and his breath rate increases.
Sherlock opens the front door. John points to the lotion basket.
CLERK
Rosie begins to sing a toddler song entirely composed of the words "red pants."
Good night.
Please, Sherlock, don't make this anymore awkward than it already is.
(taking a big breath)
Whatcha want to do tonight? Some telly? Or you can continue on your phone and I'll go get my book...
John, whether reading Sherlock's body language or deciding it was time to reciprocate, reached over and began to undo Sherlock's trousers. Sherlock reluctantly let go of John’s arse to give him more access, but maintained a firm hold on John's erection. Due to Sherlock's stance and the customary tightness of his trousers, there wasn't a lot of room to work with, but John solved the conundrum by pulling Sherlock's entire package over the top of his pants. Sherlock sighed at the freedom of movement, but the sigh turned into a gasp of surprise when John began playing with his cock in earnest. Sherlock grasped the edge of the table with his free hand and let out a reedy cry.
SHERLOCK
That's a big 'no', Holmes.
No, she loved you, flaws and all, John.
Sherlock dashes to the side table to retrieve the items. He tosses them on the bed with the toys.
John... about me saying I love you the other day...
AUDREY
(sighing)
Oh! Thank you. What is it?
John tries to get out of the shower. Sherlock catches him by the wrist. Sherlock smiles wryly at him.
INT. TESCO EXTRA - SUNDAY - DAY
Er... yes, trying to find trousers... erm, ones that are tighter than I normally wear. Tighter than these I have on, anyway.
(under his breath)
SH:  PERHAPS SOMETHING CASE-RELATED SO JOHN DOESN'T SUSPECT
You allowed yourself to be a punching bag, quite literally. Why would you do that, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
(alarmed)
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
Sherlock tenses up a bit.
MYCROFT
Who's Goldie?
Does he?... Is there a history of him sexually or emotionally manipulating you, John?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Jokes on you, Nazir, I don't officially work here.
Sherlock rises and begins pacing in thought.
No, you choose, by all means.
John bends down to harness Rosie in the stroller.
Hush!
You could have easily popped your head in the kitchen to tell me that, you know.
To what do we owe this nice surprise, John?
NAZIR
Her text came in. And you told me to go to her. You insisted on it.
SHERLOCK
As is yours.
(mischievously)
Heaven forbid you help out.
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET - MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING
(pause)
The very fond way he looks at you, the way his whole demeanor transforms and relaxes when you are around... you should hear the way he talks about you when you aren't around, John.
all of that.
He didn't mean it as a flirtation—it was the truth after all, and he merely meant to help his friend feel better about himself—nonetheless, John got a little red in the face. Sherlock found it utterly captivating, and he really,
Sherlock hadn't given him the club's name yet, and that was on purpose.
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
No? Why not?
SHERLOCK
More or less.
(bitingly)
(nodding)
One final text from Sherlock arrives. It reads: SEE YOU TONIGHT JOHN -SH
We were in the 'throes of passion' at the time, so I don't know if it even counts.
SHERLOCK
But on to the sitting room we go... in the late evenings, you and I sitting in our respective chairs happy as clams... I can't tell you the number of times I've looked over at you and wanted to pull you into my lap, onto my waiting cock, John.
May I kiss you John?
You know, I don't relish spending my entire lunch hour spying on your boyfriend, Holmes.
WHY DOES MRS H HAVE A PLANT MISTER FULL OF ALCOHOL?
John sits at his desk and checks his mobile. There's a text from Sherlock. It reads: COLLECTING ROSIE AT REGULAR TIME -SH
Sherlock looks beseechingly at John who now has other things on his mind. Lying back, John watches Sherlock through heavy-lidded eyes and with a randy smirk on his face. John's hand drifts down to lazily stroke his own cock.
SHERLOCK
I'm going to start lightly massaging around the exterior of your anus, Sherlock. Tell me to stop whenever you need to, okay?
SHERLOCK
What?
(admonishingly)
(pulling a face)
Bye Audrey! See you around!
DR HERSCHER
Here's my own analogy, Sherlock. Do you know about binary star systems?
Yes. And I already apologized for it, if I recall. But I also seem to remember you insisting I continue with the foot rub.
Give up, Sherlock. I say no, and more importantly, John said no.
John peeks briefly at Sherlock's face.
Precisely.
Sooo much relationship analysis, and even more to come (for better or worse).
May I undress you, John?
(huskily)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM -SATURDAY - MORNING
And yours...
One could say the same thing of you... waiting there on the bed for me...
FLASHBACK CONT. - 45 MINUTES LATER
(moaning)
It's not as bad as it looks, Mrs. Hudson. The tea pot miraculously survived and there's a bit of a chip in the tea cup, here. Sadly, the sugar bowl didn't make it, though.
Irene opens the door and joins them at the bottom of the steps.
Sorry? I doubt we'll be wearing much.
John scoffs, but leans into Sherlock as he holds the umbrella over their heads.
Yes. Yes, I did. Now sleep.
Oh yes, maybe I do remember...
What if I helped you?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock opens his eyes with a start. He doesn't look happy.
Stretch me open.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Three hours, you say? Must be lunch time then. I'm a bit peckish. You rest. Rosie and I will fix it. She's already helping herself to the fruit bowl.
Rosie! Come back! Sherlock's not here, remember? He's visiting his mum and dad.
John glances up at Sherlock's focused expression: the detective is, in fact, taking it very seriously.
Pissing doesn't take that long, John.
Well... perhaps I wouldn't mind hearing one more.
SHERLOCK
You know, I can't think of a single thing to say.
Why?! You clearly don't want me around. You are in such a foul mood. The foulest!
Sherlock, he accompanied you on a case today, which he never does, and you didn't even give him a proper thanks or goodbye.
AUDREY
(confused)
John sighs in vexation and rotates slowly. Sherlock sits back in his chair with a smile, enjoying the view.
You'll see, luv. You'll see.
SHERLOCK
What are you doing?
As Sherlock finishes cleaning, he glances up and sees John's expression, although he can't quite figure it out. John gives him a reassuring smile.
What? Everything? Sheets, towels, socks and knickers? Everything?
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
(with trepidation)
Uh, yeah...
Sherlock gives out an involuntary moan of his own.
Eurus stands up and slowly approaches the glass, only looking at Sherlock.
Is it okay?
What I'm trying to say, Mr. Holmes, is I'll protect your privacy.
Sherlock sighs dramatically. He paces in agitation and thought.
(flustered)
SHERLOCK
Please do.
ROSIE
Best to clean up now...
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
NO CUZ LAST TIME YOU COMPLETED IT IN 5 MINS. THE STAFF DIDN'T APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR "IMPROVING" IT EITHER.
Excellent.
SHERLOCK
Yes to continuing.
was a time for action.
Sherlock. They aren't a couple, though.
Sherlock enters.
Sherlock receives a text. It reads:
(shaking head)
SHERLOCK
Okay, my turn. I kiss Rosie, but not John.
Okay, so how do we go about determining how quickly the drug’ll get absorbed by the skin?
It is.
Too late. Now, if you excuse me, I need to get a little mynah bird to school.
MOLLY
(exhaling a sigh)
Sherlock, how are you dear?
I liked you experimenting on me, too... and as much as I liked it, you gave ME the surprise of my life by letting me experiment on you, Sherlock. Twice even. To have you ask for it twice in one day... Lord, so greedy, Sherlock. So delightfully greedy.
John leans in and kisses and licks at Sherlock's neck while gliding his hand up and down Sherlock's penis.
Smut Alert for part of this chapter. It will be labeled.
(furrowing brow)
John looks towards Sherlock briefly, and settles his gaze on the kids playing in the puddle. He is quiet for a few moments.
"Yes, yes. You both look very nice," Lupita said with an annoyed bobble of her head, "Have a good time. Say goodbye to daddy, Rosie." She was obviously
But not every day, mind you! We'll call it my semi-retirement. Let's have you come twice a week. Pick two days, Sherlock. Let's have a proper schedule.
It's not about the bloomin' potty chair!!
HOURS LATER
Well then. In order for me to do a proper job -- and I pride myself on doing things properly -- I need to know how you like to pleasure yourself.
(to Rosie)
"Please," Sherlock enthused.
Just one finger... so choose wisely.
AUDREY
(breathlessly)
Brings back memories, doesn't it, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Then give me some bloody privacy!
Yes, please do.
Sherlock stands up and paces the room with agitation. John doesn't know what to make of this.
Sherlock is back to work typing away on his computer feverishly. He happens to glance at John who is staring at him with admiration.
Molly Hooper, I come to you for advice because you know me so well. And I have the utmost respect for your opinions and very good judgment, particularly in these sorts of matters.
Much obliged, Mrs H! Thank you for bringing dinner, Audrey. You're a saint!
Which one Sherlock? Which one of my jumpers are you imagining as you shag me... or, more accurately, as I shag you... riding your cock, hmm?
I'm still not convinced.
Don't be a tease, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looked at John in surprise. John exhaled an unsteady breath before continuing.
AUDREY
When he hears footsteps in the hallway, he startles and slams down the laptop lid.
Perhaps too smoothly. Gotten a bid tedious, in fact.
Sherlock cuts John's wisecrack short by putting his whole mouth on John's cock, slowly easing down centimeter by centimeter. John gasps in response.
SHERLOCK
Oh? So, you two have the same levels of compassion and empathy? You're balanced in that way, too?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
We'll plan to delve into that another day, shall we? Now... as clever as you are, you know very well that expressing and dealing with your feelings is challenging for you; therefore, you are drawn to those who are naturally compassionate and empathetic.
(firmly)
To demonstrate, Sherlock shows how good he is with his tongue. John groans.
(huskily)
SHERLOCK
One dog and one cat that thinks it's a dog.
(throaty)
NAZIR
CLERK
(continuing pacing, in serious thought)
Ohhhhh... you...
Rosie and I are going to miss you.
SHERLOCK
(pause)
Sherlock was speechless.
Right, off we go home.
SHERLOCK
Dr. Herscher (70's, stern-looking, bespectacled, small) sits at her large desk writing notes. There's a knock at her door.
(with a cocked eyebrow)
Sherlock goes shopping and visits Molly for some advice.
Note to self. The large butt plug makes you aroused, needy, and wanton.
Sherlock's kisses grow gentler for a moment. He rests his forehead against John's forehead. Both men close their eyes, trying to rein in their desire. It takes all of John's willpower to keep his hands off Sherlock, to keep from caressing him.
(trying to control his own anger)
'December 1963' by the Four Seasons begins playing. People dance. Sherlock hastens over to John and Mary.
The two of you must have made a handsome couple.
Sorry, dear!
Oh, I see. My arse isn't as enticing as yours, is that it? We can't all have perfect pert arses like you, John.
There was that blasted 'no' again.
Something that may be benign in its resting state but turns dangerous under the right conditions... needing a catalyst, a chemical reaction to get it started.
LESTRADE
SHERLOCK
Sorry, she's asking for you. Would you mind...?
Dr. Herscher's grin grows wider.
Hm! Maybe he got a friend to purchase the tickets for him.
LESTRADE
You think you'd remember something like that... rather memorable and out of the ordinary for one of your clients, is it not?
MOLLY
Sherlock places her on the changing table.
Sherlock couldn't keep his peevishness out of his texts.
It's lonely living here on my own. This flat was never intended for a single occupant.
Rosie go! Rosie go!
AUDREY
Heart palpitations... it's racing like crazy. You're drenched with sweat here. Your breathing is too irregular. Might not be good.
(pacing again)
(awkwardly)
John leans against the wall, letting the shower spray patter on him, while half a meter away Sherlock lubes up his hand again and gently works his own erection. Sherlock's eyes are half-lidded, greedily roaming John's body as he touches himself.
SHERLOCK
Audrey, come look.
Vatican Cameos?
SHERLOCK
... requires so, so much attention.
The teacher holds up a finger.
SHERLOCK
This is arousing, John.
He considers for a moment what to do. He then carefully untangles himself from Sherlock's embrace without waking him, and quietly enters the bathroom.
Good to know.
(thrown off)
Sherlock's observation abilities are in full effect. He analyzes her outfit and scans her bookshelf carefully.
That's only for the dangerous cases. This isn't dangerous. Come on!
John...
Well... erm...
I've thought a lot about this. And, yeah, I do. I've been in therapy for years for my stuff, and he's been getting therapy for his... and with many more years of therapy ahead of us, I think we can make it.
MRS HUDSON
No. Stay in me.
What do you think of that?
I would welcome the distraction, particularly on my bad days.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - WEDNESDAY EVENING
Let's build a cemetery for you and all your ghostly friends, Emelia.
"Didn't you once use that line on Mary, possibly while presenting her with a ring?"
Morning!
I've missed you, too.
Hmm. Nope. Not really.
(gasping)
Sherlock.
(impatiently, striding to Lestrade's car)
(indignant)
SHERLOCK
than when they arrived at the club and John realized he was totally underdressed.
SHERLOCK
John furrows his brow. Sherlocks notices.
Seriously, Audrey? You can't even pretend to be the slightest bit surprised?
My God, you love this.
(emphatically)
Really? Okay then.
How long has this been going on, Mrs. Hudson? Just last week John was insisting they weren't a couple. I tried setting him up with one of my friends, for heaven's sake!
I'll be spending a couple of nights at their place, in fact. Maybe three.
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!
Hmm. Very nice.
John gives Sherlock a few more kisses.
Yes, goo-
Audrey walks a bit away to hold her phone conversation.
NAZIR
SHERLOCK
It was the clinic, with my test results.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
TEACHER
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
You know it's not Monday, right?
Sherlock takes the seat next to John on the bench.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock seems to fall back asleep instantly. John, although baffled, gives up and falls asleep, too.
Yes, I do.
AUDREY
Only two? It feels like nearly a dozen.
(winking)
Well, perhaps. But there is something else. You see, Gregory is a good man.
Dr. Herscher sits down and gestures to a chair facing her desk.
John's text: MAYBE AFTER ROSIE'S MORNING NAP
(clearing throat)
SHERLOCK
Well, I cuff them. It's the style.
WARDEN
John puts his phone down and returns to eating his sandwich. The mobile buzzes and he grabs it eagerly.
Sherlock takes some more sips of coffee and begins to feel better. John sits down next to Rosie.
Rosie and I have lived here nearly two years, and you are saying I never noticed you had a girlfriend? Let alone THIS particular girlfriend?
SHERLOCK
Vivienne leaves and John looks out the window thoughtfully.
John can only smile. Sherlock smiles back.
Rosie takes the book and begins paging through it. Sherlock turns to gather up a fresh nappy and wipes. He spies the red pants still sitting on John's dresser and grimaces.
We've seen each other naked before. Inadvertently now and then.
Sherlock! Go harder!
(rolling eyes)
(pulling away)
Aren't you chipper this morning! Let's get you breakfast.
SHERLOCK
Be good, Sherlock.
(in thought)
Three, keep half an eye on John Watson who might behave erratically in his current despondent state.
SHERLOCK
You were supposed to spend the evening with me.
(screaming)
Of course, I remember it, Sherlock. I had a bit of a nervous breakdown right there in our sitting room. It would be hard for me to forget that.
Thank you.
(rolling eyes)
Oh, that's a pity to hear. Perhaps I shouldn't have brought her sweets.
"—And you flirt with me on the regular," John pointed out.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
ROSIE
(hissing)
In and out... pounding you over and over... until...
You were a bit hard on him, don't you think?
MRS HUDSON
Sherk?
John then leans over to kiss Sherlock on the top of the head, too.
SHERLOCK
IRENE
(smiling through discomfort)
John stabs at his eggs, perturbed.
Sherlock knitted his brows at the words on his screen before texting back.
SHERLOCK
I don't think I am capable of producing the strong emotions I sense John has for me.
Brought some pain to yourself as well, I imagine.
Yes, that. Do tell.
Sherlock strides to the door.
You've missed a spot.
We've called his mobile multiple times, and his office, too. He's in surgery.
No, they're old.
And four,
(sincerely)
LESTRADE
John is horny. Sherlock goes on a short holiday.
Can I get a goodnight kiss, first?
Ah, you're awake. I was just about to call Mrs. Hudson to see if she could watch Rosie while I went for a jog.
Sherlock! What are you doing up so early?
AUDREY
Until I pushed you and everyone else away after her death.
Sherlock, with his hand on John's chin, softly rotates John's head toward him and kisses him. John's eyes fly open with surprise. Sherlock carefully licks John's tongue with his own.
SHERLOCK
Has anyone ever told you you are awfully chatty after sex?
"Let's see... you either ignore it, or scoff, or roll your eyes, or get annoyed and angry, or say 'please be serious', or launch into a lecture," Sherlock rattled off, "It would appear you have an entire arsenal of responses to all my flimsy attempts at flirting, John."
First, I want to have you on me, on my chair. I want to feel the sensation of you straddling me, Sherlock. Those long legs of yours wrapped around me. I want to watch you lowering yourself onto my big cock, Sherlock.
Hm. Is that so.
SHERLOCK
No. I'm going.
Exactly. Let's go.
Sherlock quickly looks up to analyze John's expression. They lock eyes for a moment. John's face flushes.
SHERLOCK
Sorry?
Sherlock does so, and John slips a pillow underneath Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock's got a pout on his face, but is awfully curious about what John is doing, too.
What the hell is going on, Sherlock?
AUDREY
You're not even looking at me, how could you possibly know my expression --
No. That messes with my schedule.
It is completely unbalanced, utterly unfair to you.
Well, yes, I am. I haven't done this before.
(quirking a smile)
Really John? Another pair?
Sherlock rushes back to grab the shopping bag and hurries out of the room again.
Mycoff?
Rosie is no longer crying. John looks up at the ceiling and exhales in relief.
MRS HUDSON
Now that I've had my coffee, I can say good morning to you properly, Rosie.
A pleasure to meet you.
What's gotten into you? You seem... down in the dumps.
SHERLOCK
Good night, John.
(disdainfully)
"Flat or fizzy?" she asked.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Giving something else a boost, too.
Well, I feel like I haven't even seen you in a couple of days, let alone had a proper chat.
You would assume that this one is the murder and that one...
Mrs. Hudson! I'm afraid you are mistaken. It's John that's in love with me. Not the other way around.
Hello, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Auuggghh! This is a disaster!
Those trousers... you're really going to wear those to work?
So... go shower, shave, and put on something charming. This is vitally important. You might not get another opportunity. Do you understand me? This could be your one and only chance, Sherlock Holmes.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET KITCHEN - SUNDAY NIGHT
(conspiratorially)
And that's my fault? Can you really blame me for Monday night, John? Red pants!
SHERLOCK
(gasping)
(winking to John)
(after a moment)
MYCROFT
Sherlock strips as he makes his way to the bedroom, forming puddles of clothing all down the hallway.
Sherlock kneels on the bed between John's legs and gingerly holds John's cock and bollocks back as he applies the vibrator.
Sherlock gestures for her to go ahead, still pacing.
MARTA
John disappears into the change room and the clerk heads over to the till to help out a customer.
SHERLOCK
CLERK
Well, she's a bit of a user anyway, so the results showed nothing out of the ordinary.
(nodding at the bag)
(helpfully)
It's really not necessary.
Sherlock goes to slice up an apple for Rosie. When he returns to sit at the table, John has brought them each a plate of eggs and toast.
(sighing)
SHERLOCK
Oh my God! Right there Sherlock! Right there.
Mycroft, the knight in shining armor, defending his queen... Well that does explain a lot.
John gives Sherlock a few small kisses.
What?
MYCROFT
Sherlock's hands roam John's body: exploring, feeling, and squeezing everywhere.
Sherlock...
MOLLY
IRENE
John groans and balls his fists.
(hurrying towards them)
Sherlock, I'm going to come!
SHERLOCK
(looking crossly at Sherlock)
(staring into his tea)
Yummm.
It was true, Sherlock admitted to himself: there was amble evidence of this phenomenon, stretching back over the course of John’s and Sherlock’s decade-long acquaintance. For one, John had nearly blown a gasket over the Adler case (obsessively counting Irene’s text alerts and everything), and
I'm not John.
Yes! And we will... take it slow, that is. We'll just have this part... you know... out of the way... for down the road.
MRS HUDSON
Rosie fusses. John hands Rosie some toasts and she coos happily.
Sherlock, bareheaded and without an umbrella, quickly pushes Rosie in her stroller down the sidewalk in a heavy rain. John comes running up.
MRS HUDSON
MRS HUDSON
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
(primly)
Let's get you in the mood first, shall we?
Something more substantial.
Oh, very recent, dear. Very! But it has been a long time in the making. A long time. I was worried it would never happen. So many obstacles in the way... most of which they created themselves, you know.
ROSIE (O.S.)
John stops walking and stares at Audrey. She stops too.
Oh! Really? Er...
Sherlock exits through the kitchen. John rests his elbows on the coffee table, apprehension on his face, as he watches Sherlock leave. John repacks, buttons, and zips his trousers and leans back on the sofa with a heavy sigh. His gaze falls on the violin left on the coffee table. He stands and picks up the violin gingerly. He walks it over to the case lying below the window sill. He pauses to stare out the window for a moment.
SHERLOCK
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs. Hudson, leave Baker Street? England would fall!
So... where to we begin?
Sherlock gasps. John smiles knowingly.
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
Touch yourself... think about all the pleasure your little experimenting brought me today.
Tears were forming and John let them.
A bit better than earlier, thank you Audrey.
Mrs. Hudson looks at him fondly.
And every time you shake it my way, I want to strip off your trousers and do soft and naughty things to you for hours and hours, Sherlock.
Please take a seat. Let's make good use of our time, why don't we?
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
It'll go faster if you help.
John groans again and reaches back with his free hand to grab Sherlock's backside.
(waving a hand at John)
ROSIE
John appraises him carefully.
He hands her a piece of toast from his own plate and she accepts happily. Sherlock leans against the counter and appraises John up and down with a gleam in his eye.
SHERLOCK
(hissing)
Sherlock is kind enough to make sure I reach orgasm, in a few limited ways, that is... but he doesn't want me to return the favor. Ever.
What exactly are you wearing, John?
IRENE
SHERLOCK
(turning to her)
Rosie squeals and runs into the sitting room. She spies Sherlock in his chair, squeals again, and begins climbing all over him. John peeks into the sitting room to see what's going on.
Sherlock sits in his chair with this hands steepled under his chin, deep in thought. He hears steps on the landing. Sherlock cocks his head to listen. John enters the kitchen carrying shopping bags.
Eurus, my dear, do you remember the neighbor's horses, Lucky and Thistle?
It means someone moved the body, or the rug, or both. And I want to know why. What else was the attaché hiding?
Wooo! Wooooo!
IF UP COME JOIN ME.
AUDREY
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.
(quietly)
SHERLOCK
Were you really going to experiment without me? That hardly seems fair. They're my toys after all...
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
It is the same when two very independent people embark on a relationship. It isn't healthy for one person to orbit around the other, as if one is the center of the other's world. Nor is it common that the two orbits sync up perfectly, moving in tandem. Instead two mature souls that have learned to live independently... who have created their own unique orbits... now must find a way to live together sharing a common space, common interests, and yes, eventually a common love. They still maintain their own identity, but they are, as you said earlier, "intrinsically linked."
I have an errand for us to run.
(with a little smile)
I can't! I just can't do it, John. I'm sorry.
Sherlock grabs his phone and laptop and hustles to the door.
John reads in bed. Sherlock comes to join him in bed. Sherlock takes off John's reading glasses slowly and kisses him several times. John responds readily, kissing him back and running a hand up and down Sherlock's arm. Sherlock suddenly stops and brushes John's hand off him, not aggressively, but very deliberately. Sherlock flops onto the pillow, facing away from John. John looks bewildered and turns off the light. He lies down, facing away from Sherlock with a hurt look on his face.
Sherlock breaks his concentration and turns to wait for them to catch up.
All the experts say--
ROSIE
(adding some levity)
Please tell me what we are doing for our date.
SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson smiles through her tears.
If not a mix of chemicals, maybe the catalyst was something else? Maybe heat?
Yes, by the way it is lingering in the bed clothes, especially the pillow, I'd say you slept in my bed at least one night, more likely two... you definitely slept there last night.
SHERLOCK
(blushing, smiling back)
Well, let's get you to bed, then.
A string of poisonings, is it?
It was in my top twenty.
Can you imagine me inside you, John?
Well... okay, yeah... but a dumb arse he's completely head over heels for.
Before Sherlock can change his mind, John dives to the side table and takes out a glove. He snaps it on his right hand and grabs the lube. He looks back at Sherlock and suddenly pauses. Sherlock's expression is one of nervousness and uncertainty.
Sherlock dashed off a quick BYE, then rested his phone on his belly and tapped his fingers together in thought. Her suggestion was worth a try. An idea began to percolate.
When you are parenting a toddler, approximately 50% of all conversations revolve around potty training strategies & techniques.
John nods and closes his eyes with the pleasure of having Sherlock, at last, touching him.
The fact that you have never once consulted a doctor about this is astounding to me! Or, you're faking it for sympathy.
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
What will I do if you aren't around to give me nudges?
"I couldn't take it with me," John started, then stopped abruptly. Perhaps that would be enough of an explanation for the supposedly brilliant detective.
I came for advice. Advice on love.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock.
INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
These! See? What happened, Sherlock? You haven't needed to use them for, what, two months? Why now all of a sudden?
John concentrates hard and gathers the courage to say his piece. He inhales deeply.
John and Mrs. Hudson both glance at Sherlock expectantly, but he's lost in thought at the window.
SHERLOCK
Tilt your arse my way, John.
Well, we are a couple now, so that must make it okay.
Well, I don't remember.
(exasperated)
John regards him carefully.
And speaking of someone who's always presenting his arse... that's you by the way.
It's nothing, John. Carry on. Don't let me disturb you.
I must have patches in the lab, right?
(looking legitimately worried)
(with a yawn)
Sherlock gives Nazir a dirty look. She ignores it and continues eating lunch. She's struck with an idea.
Yes, yes it did.
Excuse me, I'm being summoned.
(blandly)
That's right! What a clever girl you are. So clever, John!
SHERLOCK
And now, all of a sudden... there are butt plugs... and who knows what else.
(setting her jaw)
Your heart...
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - FRIDAY NIGHT
(embarrassed)
SHERLOCK
He sets down his phone with disappointment. John gets another text alert. It is from Nazir this time.
AUDREY
Yes, for his arthritis, and the injection sites look particularly inflamed. I suspect it wasn't the steroids themselves, but rather someone tampering with them.
Time for you to go to bed, John.
(tearing up)
John pulls his solo finger out of Sherlock’s hole and then gently inserts two at once.
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
... I should say, I've meant to say, always, and never had.
"That one I found in the back of the closet of the upstairs bedroom," Sherlock disclosed as he took blocks out of the crate for Rosie, "On a high shelf, carefully wrapped in several layers of tissue paper."
SHERLOCK
I am sorry I've been avoiding you the last few days. It was unintentionally hurtful.
(proud of himself)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
For better or worse?
Yes, you have impeccable taste.
Oh really?
(picking up Rosie)
And yours too, John. And not only today either. Although today really takes the cake.
What's wrong is that he doesn't love me back!
Rosie blows the photo of Mary a kiss. John wipes away a tear on his face. Sherlock looks sad as well. Rosie points at another photo.
SHERLOCK
Practice?
Sherlock uncoils the hoover’s cord, plugs it in, but gets flustered when he realizes he has no idea how to turn the thing on. Mrs. Hudson hustles over with a disapproving look. She takes the vacuum handle from his hand and stands directly in his line of sight.
You have nothing to apologize for.
SHERLOCK
Well... he is a man... and good at it?
"Then I'll take care of both of us."
SHERLOCK
(straining)
Sherlock lubes up and begins lightly massaging his erection.
“You said you would remember for the both of us,” Sherlock wondered, “Did you?”
Yes, Nazir fed me. She knows how much I like Pakistani cuisine and she knows all the good places... this one was particularly good; I'll take you sometime.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
"You watch the bar, particularly that bartender in the fedora who has been shooting nervous
The middle child often has to carry the emotional weight in the family... You're a good brother, you know that, Sherlock.
"Flirting shamelessly with everyone in sight?" John snapped and turned away with a huff.
Sherlock holds onto him tightly with his hands and legs.
At long last, the tedious stakeout paid off when Sherlock spied a short, dark-haired customer sneak behind the bar and plant a playful kiss on the cheek of the behatted bartender. The bartender immediately shot an apprehensive
John, straddling Sherlock again, bends down and finds Sherlock's mouth with his own. They kiss deeply. Sherlock rotates and lies flat on his back and embraces John, pulling him on top of him. John kisses Sherlock again, making sure there is plenty of tongue this time.
John backs out and eases his cock into Sherlock a smidgen more. John stills himself and waits for the next tap from Sherlock. Sherlock taps, and the process is repeated several more times.
Audrey shoots him a wilting look.
VIVIENNE
Oh noooooo. No, no, no. That's not happening.
(suspiciously)
Sherlock also glances at the bag and then back at John, studying his face carefully.
brows.
SHERLOCK
Huh? What. Oh yeah, I'm fine.
I didn't sever it myself. It came in this way.
Budge up, Sherlock. Move, you git!
It was just loads of stimulation on my prostate at once. It would have made me come in a matter of seconds. And I'd like our session to go a little longer than that, if you don't mind.
Er, all TWO of you... I just miscounted.
Sherlock thought and sighed inwardly.
Hm, you were busy.
John noticed him and looked at him with a happy smile. He walked right up to Sherlock, and sensing Sherlock's nervous state, put a reassuring hand on his hip.
We figured it was a double homicide at first, but we've only found one weapon, so it must be a murder-suicide.
(to self)
Sherlock chuckles and turns to head into the kitchen.
(while typing)
(talking excitedly)
SHERLOCK
IRENE
"Did you see any persons of interest at the bar, John?" Sherlock asked, changing the subject. John looked down guiltily. Of course he hadn't, Sherlock knew. John's eyes had been glued to
We are all creatures of habit.
the dancing part of the plan was completely superfluous to the case but
Fine, fine, fine. But, there will be no more kissing until we have our proper talk, is that clear?
(still too loudly)
Please inform your father that it is high time for a potty chair. This is getting ridiculous. Not to mention stinky.
Very well done, John.
Mama!
All three?
(pleasantly)
Ahhh! As much as I like it, I very much want you inside me tonight.
(with a wry smile)
I didn't dare book a table at a fancy restaurant, Mrs. Hudson. I figured he would have called every restaurant in London trying to track down the reservation.
I did love Mary. I especially love the fact that she brought that little person into my life.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock gives it a fresh condom and a generous amount of lubricant.
John starts down the hall towards the kitchen, but stops. He turns around slowly and approaches Sherlock's bedroom door. He opens it cautiously, and peeks in. Sherlock is not there, of course, but the bed looks very inviting. John stands at the door for a moment, looking wistful.
SHERLOCK
In pursuit of solving crime...
(pause)
Okay! That is quite enough!
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Why a haven't we had shower sex before?
SHERLOCK
Why would you do such a thing?
Sherlock grabs the diaper bag and rushes over to Rosie, picking her up.
IRENE
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
Thank you, Irene.
Sherlock kisses John several times more, each with more heat. John responds favorably. They begin to explore each other's bodies with their hands.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance?
Oh yes!
SHERLOCK
Molly, I'll... er... see you out front. I just need to...
SHERLOCK
IRENE
I'm glad to hear that.
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
John wakes up to find Sherlock curled around him. He kisses Sherlock's hand before carefully getting out of bed and heading to the bathroom door. John wistfully looks back at Sherlock as he enters the bathroom.
Sherlock looks stunned by this new information. He paces harder with his eyes wide and fingers pressed to his lips in thought.
SHERLOCK
Ours, I hope you mean.
SHERLOCK
Okay?
There is a pause. Then another of Irene's text comes in: IT IS A WONDERFUL THING ISN'T IT?
ROSIE
Yes, please.
(getting testy)
Sherlock scoffs in annoyance as the two men exit the room.
And I do enjoy experimenting.
So... let's refocus. Am I to assume that your primary motivation in telling someone 'I love you' is to hear it said back to you?
SHERLOCK
You wore jeans to work?
SHERLOCK
It really was.

INT. DR HERSCHER'S OFFICE - DAY - ONE WEEK LATER
Seems like the perfect choice for this sort of weather.
Sherlock begins to rush out.
(knowing smile)
"There's no reason to be sorry, Sherlock," John reassured him. John's patience with him only added to Sherlock's distress, but he still slid his hand across the booth seat until his pinkie finger bumped into John's. John wrapped his pinkie around Sherlock's, and Sherlock felt grounded. They sat that way for several minutes, listening to the dance music swirling around them. Sherlock, by degrees, began to feel more stable.
Sherlock hands her the doll.
SHERLOCK
Bye-Bye Rosie. Bye John.
(shaking head)
Still sounds like teasing to me.
(seriously)
"I should have done it long ago."
I'm so glad to hear they were mind-blowing.
(slaps the arm of his chair)
John eats lunch at his desk. He checks his phone messages and frowns when he sees he has none. He blows out a breath nervously, and sends Sherlock a text.
No! Tree! Tree!
FLASHBACK ENDS - RETURN TO PRESENT
Your brother.
Less than a week ago we were just flatmates, and now...
John sets the controls on the dryer and slams the door shut. He stands and turns to face Sherlock, crosses his arms, and regards him with a serious expression.
Let go, you prat.
MYCROFT
(shrugs)
(sighing, prepping batter)
(with a bittersweet smile)
A case, John! A case! She's requested both of us. I'll give you more details in the cab.
John turned his head and studied Sherlock's face with wide eyes. Sherlock unconsciously held his breath.
And her normal texts?
MYCROFT
His dead wife's maiden name. Well, it wasn't really her name, just one she stole off of a headstone when she gave up her life as an international assassin.
Then the radius, and the ulna. Can you say ulna?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock! You mean...?
Sherlock's bell-end was leaking generously, and John, in his cleverness, collected the pre-cum with his fingertips and added it as lubricant to Sherlock's shaft. John kept up the steady pace of the strokes with a gentle but firm grip, and Sherlock knew he wouldn't last much longer. There wasn't a lot he could do about the small cries that periodically escaped his throat; and John replied to each one with a quiet, appreciative curse—"
Mycroft groans and rolls his eyes.
If you don't mind.
CLERK
SHERLOCK
Right, right, right. But you're a doctor.
So eager, tonight, John.
If I'm naked, you're naked.
NAZIR
(fed up)
Sherlock steeples his hands again in thought. He forgets himself and flops his feet onto John's lap. John gestures in annoyance but Sherlock doesn't notice. John gives up and leans back, eyes closed, head against the wall in exhaustion.
Sherlock closes his eyes with melancholy.
Do you need to use the toilet or what?
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John extricates himself from Sherlock's embrace and heads to the bathroom.
"I'm going to go get our coats and pay the bar tab. You stay here," instructed John, "But if that muscle-bound twat in the fishnet top tries to talk to you again, I'm kicking the shite out of him, understood?" Sherlock gazed up at him with a crooked smile. John cocked his eyebrow at him before turning and heading across the club. Sherlock took out his mobile and sent off the necessary text to the club owner, instructing him to interrogate the guilt-ridden bartender with the fedora who would no doubt tell him everything he needed to know about the short patron stealing from the cash register. He also mentioned that the club owner might want to alert the police of low-level drug dealings going on in his establishment, if he felt like pursuing it.
Sherlock stumbles into the kitchen looking tired.
"Oi! Can my friend get another?" His request came out a bit more rude than usual, and Sherlock knew he shouldn't take his frustrations out on the wait staff, but John's accusation had stung. The waiter nodded and Sherlock gave her a sincere "Thank you kindly" to smooth over any hard feelings. Sherlock sighed and attempted to compose himself.
Sherlock puts the book down for a moment and cocks his head at John, perplexed by the inquiry. John sighs with annoyance, and starts folding laundry. Sherlock returns to reading. John mulls something over as he carefully folds a shirt.
Oh, that's jolly good. Well done, Sherlock.
Yes, I'll sleep with you tonight.
John squeezes lubricant on his hands. He slowly works the bell-end with his left hand while holding the base of his penis with his right hand. He leans back against the sink. His eyes keep gravitating to the glass door as he strokes his shaft up and down, slowly.
Spread your legs a little, please.
(from kitchen)
MYCROFT
Bloody hell!!
John snickers at this, which warms Sherlock's heart.
SHERLOCK
But it is fascinating, John. It immediately rules out Madame Imelda as a prime suspect, although we should definitely keep an eye on that daughter of hers. And we can rule out carbon monoxide or any substance that could easily spread throughout the whole building. The daughter in the flat upstairs wasn't affected. Yet, I still suspect it's an airborne toxin of sorts. One that goes unnoticed at first, but builds up over time...
Here we go, John.
It doesn't hurt that Rosie is so cute and clever, of course.
Ohhh. Amazing. I'm so stretched... I feel so full.
SHERLOCK
We cannot, Officer.
But John realizes something is wrong. He looks at Sherlock's penis in alarm, as Sherlock slowly loses his erection.
Sherlock seeks out advice on his love life. Everyone has their own take on it.
MOLLY
SHERLOCK
Biscuit!
God. You're so bloody hot, Sherlock. Look at you.
Wait, what time is it?
Well, yes, that's by design. Not to keep you in the dark, of course. I purposely make them spur of the moment because I don't trust my dear sister, lest she plan something nasty if she knew I was coming. Mycroft thinks I'm paranoid... he's coming with me tomorrow, by the way.
John, we can't both be in denial about potential heart problems, that's hardly fair to Rosie, and furthermore--
No, I can manage, but thank you for your kind offer, Officer Lestrade.
Or where one pays at the door.
Really! Care to share, John?
SHERLOCK
It figures.
Except for my trousers inventory, apparently.
John!
Okay.
Probably not her, someone else, though.
SHERLOCK
Could I interest you in some sweets?
Well, you're bound to get cold if you don't.
I should join you in the shower more often.
LESTRADE
Sherlock rings the bell. Irene's new girlfriend MARTA answers the door and beckons them in.
Same line of work, too?
(deeply)
AUDREY
John dials while trying to comfort Sherlock.
Five. Five-thirty. Thanks, by the way. It'll give me a chance to get a good start on the housework and dinner.
In the middle of the dance floor, Sherlock has deduced that Mary is pregnant. The Watsons are understandably flabbergasted and panicking.
ROSIE
IRENE
(after a pause, meekly)
(desperately)
I happened to be exhausted from our bedroom escapades the last few nights, okay?
John continues stroking them as a smile plays upon his face.
Sherlock takes a step back in shock, holding the towel limply. John yanks off his rubber gloves and slaps them on the counter.
All this, over a child's potty!
Shame on me?
John, so eager.
SHERLOCK
I know all about your little tricks, Sherlock! I know what you're up to, I'm not that stupid. Intense eye contact... you looking for dilating pupils... Give me your wrist, damn it.
Roughly once a month, Sherlock and Irene would check in with each other, in a "we-tried-to-ruin-each-other's-lives-but-now-we-are-somewhat-friends" sort of way.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock's thumb slowly runs up and down John's stomach.
Errrr…
It is so frustrating.
John walks over and kisses Sherlock on the top of the head. John and Rosie leave the kitchen.
What are you wearing? Jeans?
MOLLY
Good point. Yes, let's wait until a time when we are both ready for this kind of experimentation.
Break up?! More time?! Neither option is what I would call desirable.
I'm not handing Rosie over to you.
Ah. Yes, of course. Thanks.
She races into the building.
John is happy to comply. He holds the base of Sherlock's penis with his left hand while he wraps his lips around the top. Meanwhile he continues to work the finger of his right hand in and out of Sherlock. John tries to match the rhythm of his shallow finger thrusts with the bobbing of his head on Sherlock's cock. He takes it deeper into his mouth.
"Please," Sherlock pleaded desperately. He could already feel himself slip into his mind palace. "Please? I don't want to forget."
SHERLOCK
(strained)
(hissing)
John quietly opens Sherlock's bedroom door. John and Rosie peek in. They see Sherlock sleeping heavily in bed. John looks relieved.
(miserably)
"A two-pronged strategy, John. We observe the activity at the bar, and man the dance floor as well. Based off our interviews this evening, I daresay the staff is entirely innocent, although one or two of them are rather spooked by our presence here tonight. So, the thief must be a customer, a
NAZIR
Through the barrier of John's thin pants, Sherlock traced John's long and prominent erection with his thumb as John threw his head back and sighed blissfully. Sherlock was suddenly filled with two compatible compulsions: one, to touch John's cock, and two, to bring the man pleasure
DR HERSCHER
"I couldn't. I just couldn't. I couldn't have friends... girlfriends... Mary of all people, ask me why I had an ashtray when I didn't smoke. I couldn't risk someone asking what its significance was." It poured out of John like a torrent, a slow and steady torrent, but a torrent nonetheless. "I couldn't be reminded of our little adventures together. The good times we had together. Or the bad ones. But even the bad times felt like good times after a while, if that makes any sense."
MOLLY
(pause)
DR HERSCHER
Thanks for looking out for me, Vivienne!
Sherlock watched as John promptly put down his book and grabbed for his mobile.
Correct.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
I hope you are well today, Eurus.
Sherlock, it’s getting late. I'm going to go. I need to relieve Mrs. Hudson and feed Rosie dinner.
AUDREY
Lighter!
Well, that’s hardly satisfactory to my needs.
Something that accumulates?
(realizing Sherlock is clueless)
Thank you very much.
"Which would you prefer, dear?" Sherlock turned and questioned John. John's eyebrows shot up in warning but Sherlock gave him a "remember we are undercover" look and John rolled his eyes.
SH:  I'M OVER FORTY, IRENE. FLIRTING IS A YOUNG PERSON'S GAME

"My best blue jeans are a decade old," John scoffed.

No, I'm just saying you like women. A lot. And it is a bit hard for me to compete with fifty percent of the world population, John.

Keep me informed on what I need to adjust, John.
SHERLOCK
- Sherlock carefully enters the unoccupied upstairs bedroom and places the bee plush toy in Rosie's crib. He smiles softly.
AUDREY
Sherlock scampers away.
Sherlock ignores this and continues investigating the wardrobe. John's head snaps up, incensed.
SHERLOCK
God, you're beautiful.

With one final hip thrust, John ejaculates all over Sherlock's lips and hand. It spills onto his own belly and the sheets. Sherlock turns off the vibrator but otherwise holds his position while John pants and comes down from his orgasm.
"Come in, it's open."
SHERLOCK
(desperately)
(smirking)
Must have blocked it from my memory.
Sherlock chuckles and John slows his kisses. He gathers wipes from the nightstand and swabs down Sherlock's chest and groin, as well as his own chest. Afterward, he settles his head on Sherlock's chest, listening carefully.
Ut-oh.
NAZIR
I feel I have found someone more suited to me now.
SHERLOCK

Mwah!

So eager. So greedy, John. You need to be prepared a bit more before taking me, though.

(also painfully)
Sherlock drops his interrogation to focus on the matter at hand and the traffic-clogged streets.
Sherlock, for God's sake, be quieter!
John's face softened.
Oi! Who keeps sneaking around getting reservations and what-not for your date nights? Really, John! Sherlock still hasn't been able to figure that out yet.
The noises John gasped out were needy ah’s linking together, pitching higher and higher until they broke into sobs.
The problem of being in heat was that arousal never really went away. It was tempered down by hormones and nudged to the backburner with the extra Beta shot he wasn’t even supposed to take. But it was always there.
The Beta receptionist, Jenny her name tag said, brightened and gave Sherlock a full wattage of a smile. “Good afternoon,” she said.
“Um. Sorry, mate, but that’s wrong,” Oliver said.
“No. Just some adjustments that I’ll need to make.”
Steam still clinging to the walls and ceiling condensed and slowly dripped down. John sat in the tub with his legs stretched out and watched his skin wrinkle. The neutralizer soap bumped against his heels, turning around the drain in circles. There was a nice dent in the corner. He had thrown it at the wall—several times. He nudged it with his toe, forcing it to change directions.
“I’m forty.”
Sherlock gave Mrs. Hudson a quick kiss on the cheek and stopped before their guests. His eyes bounced between the two of them. He pulled off the Belstaff and draped it over the sitting room table.
“Yes, ma’am,” Theo murmured.
“It used to be more fun to watch when Henry was around.”
He stumbled up to his knees and whined at the loss of pressure as his cock throbbed against his stomach, dribbling pre-cum. Quickly, he smeared his hand through his slick and moaned as took himself firmly in hand, enjoying the drag of his palm as he started working himself.
He fumbled with the side table until he managed to get the drawer open. He kept four emergency shots of Beta hormones in his room and another eight in the main part of the flat; two were next to his bed, another in with his socks and the last one tucked with his gun. He refused to throw them out even at Dr. Jones insistence. He bit the cap off the first syringe he grabbed and jammed it right into his thigh.
“You might have ruined all my clothing,” Sherlock offered with a quick grin. “Can’t have that.”
“Can I get that on a recording?”
“Good morning!” Sherlock said too cheerfully and too forcefully, a bright smile splitting open his face. John almost laughed. Sherlock held his free hand out for a handshake.“Mrs. Talbot, I presume?”
John’s hand shook on the doorknob. He wanted to laugh at himself. Get a grip, Watson. He forced himself to turn the handle and step into the hallway and almost tripped over the neat pile of clothes that had been stacked on the hallway floor.
“Do you?”
“No, it was in the contract.”
That was a lie.
A slight smile stole over her face. “It would make this job a bit more exciting for you. Enough to compete with cases?”
Sherlock dropped his persona with hardly more than a blink. “Contract is it. Not settlement?”
“What?”
Alphas draped themselves on chaise lounges and daybeds, letting the green lighting trace their figures. Most displayed their more singular attributes by forgoing articles of dress and using oil to give themselves a sheen. John strode by all of them, shaking off the stares that followed. He was not here for them.
He tried to shift his neck back up and the hair on his body stood up in alarm. It was like being held at gunpoint. He attempted to console himself with the fact this was expected. Exhibiting traditional Omega instincts was the first big bullet point in the literature he and Dr. Jones had been going through. Especially for Alphas that were in his ‘pack.’
Yeah.
“Go on.”
They entered the lift and the doors slid close. There was no floor to select and no floor indicator above the door.
“You get to do the announcement cards. My handwriting is rubbish.”
“I think that’s best, yeah.”
“Oh. You like them?”
Mycroft passed the memory stick over. “Do be careful, brother mine.”
A hand caught John’s elbow and John reached to break it. The cuff links from the woman’s suit gleamed and John had a sinking feeling if he examined them, they’d match the crest he’d worn the other day. John turned around. The woman wore a plain black suit and held an umbrella above her head.
“Yeah. I am. A bit. But that doesn’t matter much for Omegas. I just, I love being a cellist. Utterly, completely love it. It’s the kind of job you give your life for. That sounds contrite and like a load of shite, but there’s nothing else for me. This is it. I sound completely barmy. Christ.”
“Right. Recommended based on extremely limited studies and one clinical trial,” John ground out. “They had four Omegas in that trial. Four. And it only lasted one bloody month.” He had followed the clinical trial very closely while at university. “They needed to be doing trials for years. That’s not enough to come to any conclusion.”
The words curled into pleasure. John chanced a look. Sherlock appeared remarkably put together. He had opened his coat in the heat of the taxi. His trousers were still on with no sign of a wet spot and his shirt was nicely tucked in. A slight bulge remained and his hair was a riot.
Finn pulled the document up on his phone. “Swearing was the first on the list actually.”
“Really? 10k?”
“I’d wish you stay and have some. Are you sure you’re alright going out in your state?”
“Right. Thanks.”
“Right. The program is much more modernized now, Alphas sign themselves up to be hosted.”
“Where do we even start with that?”
Sherlock’s phone rang. He silenced it and John stretched his arm out. Noah pinched some of the fabric under John’s armpit and instructed him to repeat the movement. Sherlock’s phone rang again.
“I had wondered if you were upset at the size difference.”
John paused taking off his jacket. He glanced down at himself then back at Sherlock. “Can’t I just go in this? What’s wrong with it?”
“You’re new.”
All the slick and cum had washed away and he had spent at least half the time watching the bar of soap go round and round in circles. The drain probably needed to be cleaned. Too bad he couldn’t just dump the acid down that.
“Of course not. That’s what he’ll say when someone points out the expenditures.”
“I think that’s fantastic that you want to pay homage,” Sherlock said. He gave John a friendly nudge with his shoulder. “Mine won’t touch anything worth at least half a million.”
“Omega,” Sherlock said. “Only you.”
“Oh, look who showed up,” Lestrade said, his voice muffled by the mask. “Badge, Sherlock. Then off you get.”
“As far as I could tell. Bobby was the third," Mycroft said.
“Alright,” John said softly. “That’s bollocks. You should have. Do you understand that? You absolutely should have.”
Members of the yard were scattered about, more than John had ever seen in one place before, poking at random objects with industrial filter masks strapped over their faces. He supposed that’s what a dead Omega meant—if you died suddenly a lot of people had to pretend to care.
“If you have this all figured out why am I doing this?”
The oven door clattered open. The stud house had sent an email. John licked his lips and clicked on it. They had forwarded the contact information for the two Alphas that John had picked out. They were both blokes. He had been hoping for a bird.
John shrugged. “Yeah. Is a bit.”
“Really, George.”
“Sorry,” Finn said. “Really, sorry. I’m completely cocking this up.”
“Sure. Black with a sugar. You know where to go?”
John looked at him sharply.
“You never took a gap?”
John was useless.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say a theory,” Sherlock murmured and took in the scene.
Shite. John closed his eyes. That was not the thing to say. The bed dipped down under Sherlock’s weight.
John hummed in affirmation. “The same time A/A and O/O couples were approved for adoption rights. You would have been pretty young I imagine.”
“The British government has always held its Omegas in the highest of regards. When a sudden large influx of Omega slick comes on the market from less savory sources there is always a concern of an Omega ring.”
“The staff had to be very careful in fetching it and it gave me the opportune time to ask questions.”
John cleared his throat. “Right.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
John ducked his head to make it easier. Useless, really. Sherlock had a good half a meter on him. The necklace fell, heavy on his shoulders. Sherlock ran his hand along the jewels, letting his fingers trail down John’s back till the pendant at the end. John kept himself still. The scenting was just for a case. Sherlock was not interested in John trying for more. Christ. John didn’t even know if he was interested in more. Even though it would be very easy. He could turn his head, nestle his cheek in Sherlock’s shoulders, breathe in their combined scents.
“Mrs. Hudson. Why am I here?”
Lestrade let out a defeated sigh. “Yeah.” Lestrade made an aborted, frustrated movement. “Bloody hell. He was our only lead.”
“Alright,” Sherlock echoed. He let go.
“Alright.” Mrs. Taylor said, a grimace crossing her face. “Thank you, Dr. Watson.”
“I’ll take you the moment we’re done here. Don’t worry.”
“No. We rutted against each other like two drunk imbeciles, but I’m inclined to think that the point still stands.”
There was always something completely hot and filthy watching his prick go in and out of a hole, pulling slick out with each drag and thrust. He breathed out needy a swear as one hard shove made a wet sound. Yeah. That always got him. He dragged his fist faster, relishing in the near slapping sound. He was already so close.
“Sorry,” John offered. “Thank you for seeing me.”
John pulled his pillow over his head and turned his back to the door. They’d be up at least for a few more hours drinking. John had taken to keeping his shoes in his room. There was normally a smashed bottle or two on the floor the morning after.
Sherlock would just need to replace everything, not only the scarf.
Sherlock grinned at him and entered. Oh, God. What did John get himself into? “Pop on the bed. A good place to start. I think,” Sherlock said.
“Yes. Alright.” She paused before pushing ahead. “He does it all the time, though. When he goes to bed, he has a go around the room and touches everything. Really, everything. Now that he can talk, he names everything he scents.”
“I’m worth more than that. At least a tenner,” John said and closed the door as Sarah waved him out with another laugh.
Sherlock eyed the tablet for a second longer before opening the smallest box and shoving it in John’s face. “Pick.”
“It was rare, a day going by where we didn’t see a feral on patrol or see one of our own starting to show symptoms. If an Omega presented anywhere that wasn’t, well, protected, you’d find their body. It’d just be left out. Along with a few shot up Alphas.”
Sherlock puffed up. He breathed harshly. “Fine,” he ground off.
“You?”
“Can’t blame me for trying. You are a very good doctor. When you show up. I’ll need to brush up on legislation for what we’ll need to provide. Will you need your own office?”
John closed his eyes.
“Would you?”
“Would it be so bad,” Harry had asked once, as they looked over another Alpha Hamish had brought home. “It’s not like you won’t enjoy it. It’d get us out of this bloody shite hole, Johnny.” John hadn’t answered and Harry had never apologized.
Dick.
John shifted. He’d forgotten about that. Not that he had ever had one after Harry.
“Exactly! Better than Christmas. The last Omega murdered in the UK was thirty years ago and it was boring. An Alpha went into a possessive rage. This one looks like it’s going to be much more promising.”
“I don’t talk about my personal life,” Sherlock informed George coolly.
“Alright.” John rocked again. “The flat bothers you though. When Alphas touch things in the flat. You go around after they leave and spray your scent.”
John shook his head. “I don’t need one,” he said.
That wouldn’t do either of them any good.
“If you want to come in you do.”
John startled at that. Sherlock had never said. He’d just assumed it was something Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to.
“Not as such. Don’t have one coming,” John said.
“Must have been a relief when it passed.”
“Good afternoon,” Sherlock echoed. “Sorry, just wanted to check, that you must have an Omega to check in here?”
A trail of slick ran down his thighs as he caught a burst of Sherlock’s scent. Sandalwood, oakmoss and the spark of fire that was utterly Alpha. It was one of the unspoken bonuses of living with an Alpha, John never needed to pay for bottled scents to help get off. He hummed, enjoying the way Sherlock’s scent simmered along his skin like the midday afghan sun, boiling against his touch as he pressed himself down and the tip of his prick caught against his pre-cum damp pants.
“Brilliant,” John murmured, the words finally coming easy. He flexed his fingers and moved his toes stiffly.
“Sorry?” John asked.
John tried to put on a smile. Might as well do his best. “I hope so.”
John bowed his head and grabbed the back of the chair with both hands. He had fucked a Beta in the army like this. Some bloke who just wanted to get his dick wet. John had shoved him down and done the work and God it had felt good. He remembered the Beta’s stunned gaze, his mouth stuck open in surprise. His hands had dug into John’s thighs, not knowing where to touch.
Sally near rolled her eyes. “If you say so.”
“Childish,” Mycroft scolded.
“You know,” John said as he was ducking out. “You could do a bit of adverts if you wanted more business. Could run something like ‘Home to the only practicing Omega doctor in the UK,’ would be a nice photo opt. Might even get featured on the telly.”
“Thanks.”
The floor was hurting his back.
“Just take a peek. Please.”
“Right.”
“The easiest solution would be to secure yourself a bondmate.”
“Right. Of course. Sorry.” John opened the notebook on his lap. Lestrade had prepared a list of questions that Sherlock had added notes to. More complaints than notes, really. “Recently, we found a dead Omega at an Omega hotel. We believe his death is related to your sister's from a month ago. We wanted to ask a few questions regarding the circumstances of your sister’s death.”
“Fuck,” John rasped.
The relief offered by Sherlock’s touch shifted from comforting to the first warm hum of arousal. John cursed himself out in his head. What would he say if Sherlock noticed? There was no way it would go well. John caught Sherlock’s hand and forced it still. He cleared his throat to banish a whine he felt building at the loss, praying Sherlock kept his gaze forward and not down.
He could do this.
And very dear friends.
“Yeah,” John answered hoarsely.
“Why? How can that be good for anyone?” Lestrade asked.
“The Omega brought a ball gag to our session and offered it,” Sherlock chimed in. “It was unappealing.”
“Nah. We’ve got it all sorted.”
“That. Back there. Was good,” John said.
John flashed Lestrade a small smile. “Ta,” John said, his voice wavering. He grimaced.
His prick pressed firmly up against his jeans. He palmed himself and then jerked away when he realized. Hastily, he shoved the lid on and reached for another, hoping it would dim the throbbing.
“Next question, John,” Liz said. "I'm running out of time."
John pressed his lips together and smiled. “Yeah. Pretty sure. I’ve had over half my life to think it through, alright?”
Sherlock made a shocked sound. He was hamming it up. “I’m so sorry. What happened?”
Sherlock held for a moment. His breath flitted across John’s skin as his lips hovered just over the slightly engorged scent gland. With every second John felt his gland hotly pulse, craving any attention from Sherlock. John shivered. The want to grab the back of Sherlock’s neck and force him to bite down was strong. To finish what they started hardly two days ago.
“Boys! You’re back,” Mrs. Hudson greeted.
Sherlock came up the stairs John collected his phone and keys to head out.
“Do we have something on?” John asked.
“Is your chaperone running late?” Fin asked.  “I did order us a starting tea service but we can wait for the rest of the courses.”
“Alright,” John said.
John’s hand would be flying over his cock and Sherlock would be watching, his gaze only on John. Just on John as John wrecked himself, letting his cum coat Sherlock’s posh shirt.
“Shall I deduce?” Sherlock asked. John breathed into Sherlock’s neck. “You came in a cab that turned onto the street from the south, if you’d been from Baker Street or the clinic it would have come down on the north end. Clearly, you were somewhere else—somewhere you didn’t bother to check your phone. You check texts when out on social occasions; both dates and pub outings with the lads. So, somewhere you found important. That leaves very little—potentially sex or a tragedy involving your sister. You hadn’t showered, or applied fresh cologne to cover the pheromones you produce after intercourse with your Betas and you didn’t carry Harry’s scent—that leaves an appointment of some sort. What kind of appointment would cause you to have a panic attack on a rather bland murder scene? Well. Obvious. You saw your Omega specialist and learned something rather disruptive pertaining to your second gender and the dead Omega triggered it. As to what.”
“You think so?” Finn asked with a quick smile.
Sherlock made a face. “It’s still true.”
“Apparently,” Sherlock drolled. “This is the latest fad in bonded male fashion.”
Sherlock directed John to spin around and John obliged. “I have good taste. You’ll do,” Sherlock said.
“I suppose it’ll do,” Mycroft said when John joined him.
He opened one of Angelo’s bags and started eating out of the box with a plastic fork that had been in the bag. He was hungry. Not enough to eat anywhere near the amount Sherlock had ordered in but probably at least two. More like three. Sherlock regarded his makeshift plate with distrust.
“Probably not.”
“Um.” Oliver sucked in his breath. “They really didn’t say anything?”
John rocked back and forth on his heels. “So. This is just for the case, then?”
He went limp.
“All the way in, John?” Sherlock asked.
A door slammed open. John couldn’t manage to turn around and look.
Oliver swallowed. “You’re wrong.”
Sherlock gasped louder, his hips shifting and legs straining further apart, pulling the fabric of his trousers taught around his knees.
“Not to say all Alphas are complete knotheads. It’s usually the same bonded Alphas that cycle out of the clubs and quite a few of the new rich, who don’t understand the rules. It’s quite refreshing. It's how I found Theo. I could recommend you a few if you’re looking.”
“Oh, I wonder how that happened?”
Pheromones burst out, filling John’s mouth and saturating the air around them. Better. A ragged moan left Sherlock’s lips and his grip slackened and John echoed with his own short moans. He dug his teeth in more, dragging them against the bruising scent gland. He hadn’t broken the skin. A good or bad thing; John didn’t know. He couldn’t focus on anything but the bloody horrid scent.
Omegas smelled soft—the quiet moments when everything just seemed to hush. British poets described it like the first burst of rain in the morning or the steam curling up from a hot cup of tea. In John’s case; the perfume his mum had watered down to keep longer, left sitting in Hamish’s room after her death. A scent Harry and John thought of as home.
John looked at Sherlock and grinned. “Who’s a good boy?”
“Gloves.”
“You visited Henry’s parents, then?” Oliver said after a few beats.
“Nevertheless.”
Oliver stared at him with wide eyes. “Killed?”
Sherlock held John’s wrist all the way home, searing small little circles into his skin.
“Sherlock, I’m not sure.”
“I’m demonstrating,” Sherlock said.
John bowed his head into the dip of Sherlock’s pelvis and breathed in. Sherlock only smelled like Sherlock. Good. He smeared himself against Sherlock’s thighs and threaded his free fingers through Sherlock’s trimmed pubic hair.
“Dr. Watson,” John corrected.
“Not sure if I can have this training exercise ready for you every day.”
Men were just complicated.
“I’m here to enjoy myself.”
Discreetly, John removed the backing and attached one Scent Me Not to his wrist. He should have used them yesterday. Lestrade had sat with him for a good fifteen minutes before Sherlock returned, enough time for John to completely cover him. He had to have gone home reeking of Omega. John should apologize. Did he send a card? He wasn’t sure what he’d put in it.
“—ow often does yours let you fuck him?” George asked Sherlock.
“I’ve never heard that before,” Oliver said. “Ever.”
“I’m about to pop out,” John said. He smiled thinly. “It's fine Mrs. Hudson.”
Lestrade pressed a button and talked for the microphone on the table. “15:52, Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson join the interview room.”
Sherlock hesitated; his arm half stuck between the two of them.
John leaned back in the chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. He’d rather be upstairs.
Ayla and her chaperone passed a joint between them. She offered it to John and he held back the urge to tell her to piss off. He had said something to the same effect earlier when she had propositioned him. She in turn had told him he was alright and bullied Emir to take his place.
“For an entirely different reason.”
“It's alright,” Sherlock repeated.
“I’d say he’s in one of his better moods,” John said.
“That begs the question,” John said. “There’s no real indicator. There aren’t really any studies for my situation, best I can do is an educated guess and that is pretty shite, honestly. As soon as two days really. Maybe longer.”
“Alright.” John’s brow furrowed. “Wait. Didn’t you?”
“Alright. I’m for the loo,” John said.
“Alright,” John said, dipping his head.
“—reactions it seemed best to temper it where we could.”
“Didn’t you already go through this?”
Their cocks rubbed against each other, back and forth and John babbled.
The cut of the shirt was wrong, John supposed.
John made a frustrated noise. “That’s the problem.”
John didn’t move. He stared. Hamish grabbed him and forced John towards the Alpha standing in the doorway.
“It doesn’t need to be actually finished. I need it to look finished—don’t bother with the lining, just get the hems done up. People never actually look.”
Mrs. Talbot returned with an Omega man at her back. The Omega, Mr. Talbot John assumed, carried the tea tray in slightly shaky hands. The top of the pot rattled until he set it down on the coffee table.
Sherlock could walk up to John, order him to strip and bugger him right over his chair and John wouldn’t make a sound of protest. He’d encourage it. Probably try to fuck himself back onto Sherlock’s prick for good measure.
“He had them delivered. An early Christmas present. Are you going to get dressed?”
“You’re stalling,” Sherlock said, finally focusing on him.
“Not at all, Mrs. Hudson. I’m sure the sex was—lovely,” John managed.
John sneaked a look at the last picture again. Finley’s prick looked—nice. John had never spent much time looking at cocks other than his own or the overly done up ones in porn. He wasn’t quite sure how it compared. He barely remembered Sherlock’s from this morning. Just how smooth it felt against his cheek, how it tapped against his skin as Sherlock thrummed with arousal and how little it tasted of anything as he licked it. He should not be thinking about that. Absolutely not.
“Yeah.”
“And this isn’t?”
It was a basic echo response to Sherlock’s shifting pheromones. Angry Alpha translated to danger and a pathetic part of John’s Omega instincts were failing to understand that Sherlock was only upset at a bloody cup of tea.
Sherlock grunted as he failed to slide John on his back and the blunt force of John’s dead weight fell on his side.
“No. Definitely not.”
Nothing bad had happened. He repeated it several times over, willing himself to accept it. He had bit the Alpha and Harry had taken him into her room where she had shoved both of them out onto the scaffolding that covered the left side of the building. The government had run out of money to finish the project, at least according to the building manager.
“Mr. Holmes!”
John turned back around. “Sorry, what?”
Sherlock followed suit as John tapped his pockets down until he found a packet of Scent Me Not. They were small stickers coated in trace amounts of paralyzing gel that momentarily curbed scent production. He always carried them around just in case.
“You want me to believe,” Lestrade said, “that you and Bobby shared the beginning of his heat. He got exhausted and you went to go take a shower. Then, by the time you came out, he was dead.”
“I did say danger.”
“We certainly couldn’t do this at Tesco,” Sherlock replied.
John nearly sagged in relief. Noah just thought Sherlock was being possessive of him because they had shagged recently. It was one of the few times Alphas particularities were still catered to because outside of drugging them off their tits there was no answer. On the downside, he thought they were shagging. John would take it. Not like everyone already thought they were anyways.
Christ. This kid was a chaperone.
Theo rushed around the lounge to Liz’s side. He offered her his arm and she grasped it. After a few deep breaths she hoisted herself off with a slight grimace. The scent of heat drifted over. John froze, his hands tightening around the notebook. He didn’t dare move until Liz and Theo were several rooms away.
“The case?”
“Thank you,” John said. “I never said. So, thank you.”
“If I had known we were expecting you I would have received you with my bondmate.”
“There’s no reason to protest.” Sherlock flicked out a police badge. “Tell us the room before Dr. Watson decides to seek compensation for your clearly antiquated viewpoints on Omegas in the workforce.”
“Yeah.”
“Oh, that’s loads better.”
“The club?”
A wrist pushed into John’s mouth.
John stared up stunned, gasping for breath.
The plaid suit fit near perfectly. John did up the white buttons. The fabric was a lush emerald green and dark blue. He pulled out the cuffs. He looked quite fit.
“Oh. The hallway. You’re welcome,” Sherlock said when he had puzzled it out. “This can’t be any different than scenting those boring Beta women you date. Easier, I would think. Just my torso and up would do. Thanks.”
“I don’t know. A few weeks ago? Whenever we went down to the local.”
Sherlock inhaled. “You’re in heat,” Sherlock breathed out the revelation. His hand lifted and cradled the back of John’s neck. “John?”
The kettle popped off and Mrs. Hudson made two cups that she foisted on John along with a spray bottle.
“Yes, it’s a good evening, isn’t it, Mr. Holmes?” Mycroft said with a tight smile.
“I’m not some blushing maiden you were having your way with. I was aware of my actions the entire time.”
“This is,” John started.
John stared at Sherlock. They had frotted on the floor an hour ago and Sherlock had picked out clothes for him to wear. Right.
A waiter silently placed the food on the table. A steak for John and a salad in front of Mycroft.
He leaned back into the seat and stared out the window. He breathed in deeply, trying to sneak a sniff at Sherlock. Nothing. Not even a hint of arousal. Just the bland scent of an Omega taxi.
“No. It was a contract. A settlement would have at least secured your household for several years and Mr. Talbot wouldn’t be wearing fake pearls. How much?” Sherlock asked.
“You would think so, wouldn’t you?”
“Good.” Sherlock sat down across from him.
“I’ll just ask Mrs. Hudson to heat it.”
“I took the liberty of selecting your clothes for the day,” Sherlock said after a stretch of silence.
Constantly.
Sherlock taped his fingers, a quick grin tugging at his lips. “Henry was your lover.”
“Good place to start, Mr. Holmes,” Noah said.
Sherlock stilled. His neck stretched further back and he groaned. A deep, Alpha sound that perked John’s cock right back up and settled right in his blood. He had to grip the door to keep himself still as Sherlock came, spurts of cum falling out all over his posh pants.
Never mind that neither Sherlock nor John wanted a bond. That didn’t matter one bloody bit. He wanted to get on his knees and beg at Sherlock’s feet. He wanted to press his face into Sherlock’s stomach and feel the rumble of his breathing. There had to have been something he could’ve done differently. Alpha had come so close. If he could just fix what went wrong. Because he was a good Omega. He wasn’t useless.
“Ta,” John said. He backed into Hamish.
John cleared his throat and looked away. “Ah. Yeah. I would.”
Sherlock set down a cup of coffee and gave John’s elbow a cursory touch that shifted to a quick scenting. It was the third that morning. John licked his lips. It was normal Alpha behavior. He shouldn’t be noticing it. He picked up the coffee and stopped before drinking.
“Still fond of last year's styles?” Sherlock asked towards Mr. Talbot.
“Very. I don’t think Mr. Talbot would be here otherwise.”
“I’m sure he’ll be right chuffed. We should have done Harold’s.”
Sherlock’s long fingers tested around John’s arsehole and John rolled his eyes to the ceiling. They were slightly cold and dry but they carefully, almost tenderly, urged him open. The head of the dildo replaced the fingers after a few moments and Sherlock pressed it in.
Sherlock came over.
“Still on that diet?” John asked. He cut off a big bite of steak and ate it.
“—Hours. And spend, what? Probably my yearly salary on a few suits. You take time and effort to make yourself look like that. You know why I dress. Well. Not like this.”
“It doesn’t have to be body parts in the fridge.”
“That sounds like a laugh.” Sherlock caught John’s hand. “Er.”
They had a case.
“Right. Mrs. Hudson.”
John shook his head. No. This was John’s room. His nest. Alphas weren’t allowed. Sherlock frowned at him
“If you were bonded this would be everyday attire.”
Sherlock rolled his head lazily over the backrest to appraise John. “Everything.”
“Is it?” Sherlock asked.
“Fucking hell,” John muttered. He closed his eyes and rocked on his feet.
“How’d you know when my heat broke?”
“Was very insistent,” Sherlock said.
John made another note. “Do you know what clubs your sister frequented?”
It was just relief. This wasn’t for anything else.
“Well, that was unfortunate,” Sherlock said pulling up his own pants and trousers.
“That I look like an old bastard?”
“You’ve shared a heat?” John interrupted.
John paused when he got to the Belstaff. He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. Christ. He picked up the Belstaff and held it to his face. He breathed in deeply, taking in all the scents. Oliver’s scent was faint but it still whispered from where he had touched it. That wouldn’t do at all.
“Right. Okay.”
"What?”
Sherlock fussed with how the O-Lariat rested against John's suit. “It’s all yellow diamonds. Worth four to five thousand pounds a carat. I can’t remember the complete sum off the top of my head. You don’t plan on losing it, do you?”
“Um. Right. Yeah.”
John was not going to check himself into a hospital because he was failing to deal with his own biology.
The fact that Henry’s parents were illegally selling his underage heats was not the reason they were there. Not that Alphas would have cared. They wanted to participate.
Program was a generous word. They were stud houses, where Alphas paid to have the chance for some Omega to take a sniff at their pheromones and maybe select them for a few days of a heat fuck.
Deeply, John breathed, shoving his nose against Sherlock’s warm skin. The scent was still there. Tainting and taunting. It wasn’t supposed to be there. This was John’s and Sherlock’s. John made a desperate noise. Even the shirt. He shoved Sherlock hard, out of the chair and onto the ground. Sherlock looked up at him stunned.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “Why not? I’m hardly going to ravish you. You’d be safe in your room.” He shuffled a bit. “I wouldn’t let anyone up. No Alpha is going to show up and try to bond you.”
John watched Sherlock from the mirror, brow furrowed. He was still on the phone and listening attentively in a way he only got when on a case. The phone call ended and Sherlock started tapping out a text.
“Haven’t spent that much time looking at them, to be honest. Had a gander at the ties." John shrugged. “Don’t really need any of those, now, do I?”
“I can tell.”
Oliver pinched his face. “Sure, mate. Can the two of you tell me about Henry or not? I don’t have time to listen to fake progressive shite.”
“You have five years from when you presented to when a doctor could have prescribed them.”
John should use acid. Just dump it right over. There was some in the crisper that John had given up throwing out. Sherlock always replaced it. Why not. Sherlock had money to buy another scarf, ten even. And a new sink. And anything else that might dissolve.
“Am I right?”
“And I am here, why?” John asked, glancing at Sherlock.
John dressed. He pointedly ignored how everything fit perfectly and that he was wearing an obscene amount of pounds. He flexed his toes in the shoes, listening to the creak of new leather and Sherlock joined him, already dressed, and completely put together.
“I can break us in.”
John spotted Sherlock. Still fully clothed. Thank, Christ.
“They have a spray room,” Sherlock informed him, catching him out.  “Surprisingly efficient.”
“Aren’t you lucky to have that choice. How many children are in our contract, Theo?”
John tightly smiled. “Yes. I know.”
“I made the order when it was clear you would continue to assist me with the work. Fortuitous, seeing as our current case is dealing with the upper echelons of society and we would not have had the time to wait.”
“He said he was married to his work,” John forced his lips to work. He’d take a long go at Mycroft if he thought he could sustain it. John doubted he’d get past calling Mycroft a fucking, sodding cunt.
“Navy,” Sherlock corrected.
“Yeah. Very much. That’s why it's case by case. There has been new testing specifically designed to catch Omega genes that was just approved last year. If you wanted to take Gabe to be tested to see if he’s an Omega carrier, the government will front the cost of a live-in Alpha for the family.”
The box held a double set of pins and clips encrusted in diamonds.
“Yeah. Well.” John ran his fingers under the collar of his shirt. “You’re not the one all dressed up.”
“No. He normally stays home the week before.”
“It’s all good. I look fit. Thanks, mate,” John managed with a perfectly steady voice.
“Until I ended up in the Thames. That seems dull. You think he could arrange for something a bit more exotic?”
“I’m not sure if that’s possible, Mr. Holmes,” Noah answered.
“Oh. Overshared a bit, did I?”
“They’re from the family collection.” Sherlock touched the crest and John shivered. “Rather ridiculous, don’t you think?”
“John,” Her voice turned soft, consoling. He hated that voice. He used it himself when dealing with irrational patients. She had to think he was being an uncooperative cunt. “If either of us pursued this outside of a government-funded and approved trial, we would both lose our licenses for something that, with current actual data for, we could harbor a guess of working for maybe one more year. If that.”
“They let you in without one last night. Henry was young. The chances of him bumming off to a club without his assigned chaperone is high. The club assigned you to him when he showed up and you are concerned that you haven’t seen him in over a month.”
“Right,” John said. He sat down and opened a few of the boxes. “Well, I am starving.”
Sally snapped her fingers at the two other Yarders in the room. “Start taking notes! On everything.”
“You can put the tea on the table. Mind the papers,” Sherlock said.
John cleared his throat as Sherlock activated the lift and the doors started to open.
John nodded. “It’s very much expected. A/O’s feel safest when their territory is clearly marked and established.” Sherlock liked to spray their door with some weird chemically enhanced version of his scent once a week. Everyone knew whose flat they were entering, to Mrs. Hudson’s chagrin. “With no other A/O in the household, Gabe will feel the need to compensate for it. It’s completely normal.”
“There’s nothing here,” John started up again, “not a single bloody note. Everything is unremarkable. Heat complications, really.” Irritated, John dropped the autopsy on the table. “It’s either faked or forged or done by a student about to flunk an exam.”
“Supposedly drinking is bad for reproductive health,” Ayla said.
“Sherlock, timing!”
“Good. The imitation scent gland, a knot strap and—”
Sarah’s intercom beeped. “Mr. Waterstone has checked in,” the receptionist said.
“Oy! I have one of the highest solved rates!”
“Right.”
“Have you started smoking again?” John asked.
“I remember the adoption act, but nothing about Omega labor laws.”
In the loo, John splashed cold water on his face. He did it several times and stopped only when the color faded from his cheeks. The shame remained.
“Am I supposed to wear those?”
He pulled Sherlock’s mouth down to his neck.
Steadily, John massaged the scent glands on his neck, digging his knuckles in. All the scraping on Sherlock’s chest had healed, along with the excessive amount of bruising John had left on his hips. John should have checked in with him the day after the fact. Made sure they healed cleanly.
“Sherlock—”
“Bollocks. What do you want? I’ll dish some out.”
Oliver shuddered. The chaperone picked up the spray bottle on the table and quickly sprayed Oliver, cutting off any pheromones attempting to flood the area.
The results stared at John from the computer screen. Twenty years was as good as run as any he supposed. The paper hospital gown crinkled as he shifted back.
“Well, if you’re track record isn’t enough to sack you,” Sarah offered as a rib.
John coughed to cover a laugh.
“I’d probably win.”
Sherlock stood. “I don’t know. Our first query becomes how Henry died. Go change into the gray suit. An older Omega chaperone checking in on a once charge isn’t too uncommon. Mummy certainly entertained her fair share.”
“Right.” John backed away. The hallway would be fine. He’d be able to sit down. Breathe some fresh air. “Sorry. Just going to step out for a bit.”
“Other people, as in?”
“It’s just me, John,” Alpha said. Alpha dropped his wrist right under John’s nose. “Smell.”
I sincerely apologize for how long this chapter took to put out.
“—I’d prefer Tom as well.” Tom held his wrist out for John to sniff, a proper Alpha greeting; at least according to all the rubbish literature the doctors had dumped on him. “Nice to meet you, John.”
“You’re sure?” Oliver demanded. “This isn’t a bloody joke?”
“It’s alright, John,” Sherlock said.
Mycroft pulled out an elaborate bonding pin with a yellow diamond at the center. He clipped it on the suit and held his arm out. John crossed his own.
“Right.” John rocked on his feet and felt his socks squish. The rubbish name only meant one thing. “Is Mycroft here, then?” John asked wearily.
“Try undeleting it. Or recovering it. Or whatever you call it.”
“Probably a cloth one,” John said with a light shrug. He hoped the dead Omega had used a cloth gag.
“Why do you care what they think?”
“Do you try to be unobservant?”
“Did you enjoy it then?”
“Then you came out, found him dead, called the police, and left him,” Lestrade stated. “I’d like to play something, a 999 call that was made from a cell phone, registered under your name, George.”
With care, Noah selected the navy suit and stood by the privacy screen. John stepped behind it and stripped without fanfare. He dressed in the order Noah handed the suit over; trousers, followed by a crisp white shirt and the jacket.
“Was it in the gossip rags?”
“That’s horrible.” John clutched at Sherlock’s thigh like some of his dates had during horror movies. “I can’t believe I’ve heard nothing about it!”
The head of the toy pushed past the beginning of his inner folds, bobbing against the softer tissue, forcing John to hunch forward with choked moans. His legs trembled, and the knot pushed further out, opening him for more cum. His walls chased the feeling, squeezing the knot and the shaft and fluttering around the crown, trying to pull out an Alpha’s release.
“It would seem so.”
Sherlock waited impatiently for Oliver and his chaperone to collect the belongings before he near bodied them out of the flat. John sat in the chair he heard them start descending the stairs before springing up and aggressively spraying the couch. He wanted every echo of Omega scent gone. His was the only one allowed in the flat.
John had presented at thirteen, to his confusion. Neither he nor Harry understood and Hamish was too pissed off his tits to notice. Omegas were a foreign concept only on the telly or in the royal family. They didn’t exist in council flats in Chelmsford. The only one to notice was a school nurse when John came in with stomach cramps that weren’t. Even then, it took Hamish several days to sober up enough to manage them to the doctors.
Lestrade snorted. “Right. Let me hear it, then.”
“Right. I’ll just be off,” John said with an awkward gesture.
John could come with a cock up his arse and hate every moment of it.
Jealousy flared up. A bloke didn’t trim around his cock because he felt like it. John rumbled without noticing. Sherlock started making shushing noises and his own softer version of the rumble, trying to comfort John. That wasn’t good enough.
You—smell—betrayed—how dare—John failed to let go.
“Right, does, er.” John cleared his throat. “Does he, you know?”
“I said knot straps.”
“Yeah. Think so.”
The diffusers humming in the background kept Noah’s scent from really sticking unless John wanted to have a gander at his sleeve. It was a bit of a relief. It confirmed that people still read John as Beta—no Alpha would dream of doing that handshake with an Omega. John held the grip and as soon as it was polite to, he dropped it with a bland smile.
“They’ll have to wait. Theo,” Liz said.
“We’ve already settled it, I’m afraid.”
“Don’t like the truth?” George goaded. “Bet you’re exactly the same. Only want it when you’re dripping for it.”
The Alpha years ago had stuffed the ball gag straight into John’s mouth the second he had John tied up and left it in for hours. It had made saliva drip down his chin and chest and trapped his tongue to the bottom of his mouth. He hadn’t been able to say anything.
John eyed Sherlock. “Yes. She was even married.”
“Expecting company, are we?” John asked, his laughter leaking into his voice.
“Hm. Yes,” Sherlock said. He stepped back into the hallway and checked his phone. “Five minutes. Best hop to it. Unless you fancy a trip across London in your pajamas.”
“Uh, no. I’m good. That’s, yeah. The blue suit?”
“He even likes to talk like one too.” George barked a laugh. “How charming. Doesn’t matter at the end of the day, though does it? We know better. Mine doesn’t give a piss either. At least until she has her cunt in the air, gagging for it.”
“If he honestly died of heat complications, which does happen, there should be remarks somewhere about it. An over producing slick gland maybe or a O-gland not releasing properly.”
At least today had been with Sherlock and not some random cunt from a bar who had gotten a whiff and decided to pin John to the wall. It happened a few times when he’d bought bad suppressants off his dealers and he went somewhere public. The worst part of it was he ate the entire bloody thing up. He craved some big, strong Alpha just hoisting him up and impaling him on their cock. Especially on heat days.
John swayed into a sitting position. The robe John had draped over himself had been replaced with something heavier, the Belstaff John recognized as he blinked blearily awake. Sherlock had, at some point, dragged his chair over to the couch while John slept. Autopsy reports were dumped on the coffee table, half of them askew on the floor.
Lestrade sighed, giving in. “We found some hair. Looks like the Alpha that came with him took a shower. We’re running the DNA. But that could be another two days before we see matches. Lucky for us, all Alphas are required to be registered.”
He giggled.
“You shouldn’t be leaving the flat in your condition!”
Today was just his luck.
“You know that isn’t true,” Dr. Jones said patiently. “Without an Alpha your body will continue to overproduce in an attempt to attract one. You will not be in a state of mind to take care of yourself and replenish all the fluids you will be losing. Severe hydration will kill you while you are near clinically insane. Is that how you want to die?”
Rubbing lube into every crease and rib the toy sported, John slicked it up and then fiddled with the settings. He opted for the gradually growing knot and a barely larger length. Any longer and it chanced to hit his O-gland, which was tucked just inside his vaginal cavity, and doing that without someone to provide aftercare was shite. Who was John kidding? Even with someone, it was shite. It was lucky if he got a pat on the shoulder after.
John swallowed.
Even then, the ones he had left were barely working. Yesterday had proved that. His hormones were nearing free-range and bringing buried Omega instincts to the forefront. At least they were still inhibiting his personal scent production and he assumed his pheromones as Alphas hadn’t started to come on to him randomly off the street.
Ended up not working on this for a few days during the holidays. WIll be back to the 4/5 day update schedule after this. On a side note, have you ever counted how many tables John and Sherlock have in the flat? They have three, plus the coffee table. Two in the kitchen and one in the main room. I was a bit boggled when I realized I had to describe which table in which room. I've had to split this chapter, it ended up being almost double the length. As consequence, I'm bumping the total chapters up as I realized a later chapter would have the same problem.
“Why would I pay?”
This was all shite. John said something. His words gibberish to his own ears. He wanted to let go. To get up. Head to his room. Curl up under the sheets, gun in hand.
“You killed someone for me the day we met.”
“I want you to move your arms out in front, I think we need to taper in a side seam.”
“No reason to get so testy and so early in the morning too. Some things just aren’t to be brought up.”
“Hawaii over the Maldives?” Sherlock asked.
“What did you burn in here?” Sherlock shouted. “It’s all stuck!”
“Who else?” Sherlock showed off the badge like a prize.
“Good. Good,” Sherlock said.
“Uh. Congratulations?” John offered.
Sherlock caught John’s hand, undoing his clenched fist. He wove their fingers together and gently let their scent glands brush. John hated how calming it was.
“Your family declined to comment at the time if your sister was seeing any Alphas besides the potential matches.”
“How much more will you eat?” Sherlock asked, leaning into John’s chair, and putting him too close. “The amount varied per study.”
“I’ve always found it to be an evolutionary miracle that Omegas managed to survive through the years and that it took man-made chemicals to actually do harm to the global population. If you could see yourself, Dr. Watson. Here you are, a man of some intelligence who is quite capable of physical alterations and a crack shot rendered useless by pheromones,” Mycroft said.
John’s arousal was near painful as he watched with rapt attention as the head of his cock disappeared and reappeared under his grip. His slick squeezed out between his fingers, dripping down to the sheets.
What was left after the fierce surge of pride was failure. Not the easy kind that was solved with a cup of tea or a few episodes of crap telly. It was standing over a body in the operating room and hearing the heart monitor flatline and watching the lungs stop moving. Utterly paralyzing in the amount of space it consumed and the resounding knowledge that he had tried and it wasn’t good enough.
“For after those boys leave,” Mrs. Hudson said firmly. “Just give the area a bit of a spritz and send Sherlock down to collect the takeaway. I have something for him too.”
“This is family business,” Mrs. Talbot said.
“I’m not waiting for you to examine my dildo. Come over and make me come. Or I’ll shove you on the damned floor like earlier.”
“No. That you look, well, normal. I’d be able to have a pint with you down at the local. Takes a bit of the pressure off. Oh! I forgot. I should have spent more time looking at the form. I just never thought. Here. Sorry.”
“I thought you’d notice sooner,” Sherlock said, leaning down into him.
“Yes. If the Alphas are bonded, they’re guaranteed to not force one. What’s a little infidelity after all, over dealing with the embarrassment of a lesser Alpha having a chance at an Omega. At least the Alphas on their way out think so.” She paused and sent a sharp look at Theo. “If I ever catch you. I will take you outside and shoot you like a dog.”
“Off a fresh mating?” Noah asked as Sherlock stepped back.
“It’ll have to do. You should have worn a jumper.” Sherlock strode forward before turning back and holding out his hand.
“What do you mean? I brought a cuppa,” Lestrade answered.
“To assist all your needs while you go through the samples,” Sam informed him cheerily.
“I was an Army medic.”
“Hardly. My brain almost atrophied and was unable to process anything besides basic sensory output.”
There was so much more he wanted. The impulses were there, ready to push forward the moment he stopped paying attention. Completely inappropriate.
“Your suppressants. You are worried you’ll end up like our murder victim.”
Finley Clarke was the first Alpha’s name. He was twenty-seven. That had to be one of the reasons he smelled so good. Young Alphas were in the prime of their life. John had over ten years on him. Finley was probably expecting some slip of an Omega that hadn’t even hit twenty. He’d take one look at John and laugh.
“Checked in as Sherlock Holmes,” the chaperone said, checking his phone before taking a drag.
“It just doesn’t make sense, does it? B/B couples having A/O children.”
“What’re you—”
“I’m not eating cold pasta for the rest of the day.”
“Doctor recommended?”
“I’ll be popping off for a bit,” John said.
Sherlock tucked his head into the archway from the kitchen. His eyes darted from John’s shoulder scar to his scent gland. Sherlock sniffed. There was nothing to smell. After the Beta hormones and shower, John smelled like nothing.
“To an A/O club? Yes. At first, because it was expected but then, the rich do enjoy their habits.”
John grinned. “You have shite pickup lines.”
“Just so.”
Hamish had always roughly grabbed John by the shoulders, his hands pressing against John’s scent gland and demanding obedience in an Alpha strong grip. He liked to drag John up and down the street, pointing out the houses and cars. If Harry didn’t follow, he’d grab her too, yank her around by her arms. Sometimes, it was worse; after John had rejected several Alphas in a row. Hamish would grab John by the jaw and force his head to turn and bury him in angry pheromones that made him cower.
“The Thames, more likely.”
“I was told to be thankful,” Sherlock said. He crossed his legs and relaxed back into the chair, draping his arm over the back.
Flexed his hands.
“What?”
“Yes. Much better.”
“Don’t think so,” John said.
Rubbing his hands into Sherlock’s neck, he chanced a glance up. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his mouth partly open, his nose flaring every few moments. John licked his lips and kept going. He spent the most time on Sherlock’s scent glands, dragging his wrists back and forth, smearing his scent, and activating Sherlock’s.
Methodically, John trailed his nose along the coat. Every time Oliver’s scent peaked up he smothered it his own, smearing his cheek or wrist all over it. Sherlock probably wouldn’t notice. Probably. John licked his lips. He did his best to put the Belstaff back exactly as it had been before going up to his room for a quick change. If they wanted information on David Wood he’d need to pop into his Omega clinic and request information on practicing Omega specialists in London.
“Give it a go.”
“It’s just,” Mrs. Taylor started.
“Do you want my help?” Sherlock asked.
Apparently.
Lestrade returned with two masks in hand, and suits draped over his left arm. “Here you go, then.”
“You can’t access Omega records. At least not normally. Lestrade was denied and he’s trying to solve a murder. You had to ask Mycroft.”
John licked his lips. He had a very strong feeling if Sherlock walked away now, he’d be stuck like this until Sherlock’s scent faded. He trusted Sherlock.
“I won’t eat it.”
"Right.” Sally tapped on the door frame. “Just give it a knock when you want in.”
Sherlock squinted slightly at him, trying to puzzle it out. He made a satisfied noise after a few seconds. “You don’t like other Omega’s touching you.”
John was certainly getting too much attention and he had no illusions about his appearance. He was forty and looked it. The boyish charm that had clung throughout his life had started settling into deeper lines and his blond hair was disappearing into gray. He could only hope that the next few years would move him further into distinguished rather than old bastard. Not to say all the Alphas were all old bastards. John would guess at half being just as young.
“Oh, but.” Mrs. Hudson fluttered her hands before frowning at the two of them. “What was yesterday about then?”
John moved his jaw drifting between offended and amused.
Sherlock growled; a low sound that sunk into John’s blood. John moved his arm to hold Sherlock’s cock still from bobbing and found himself pulled up in a grip stronger than it had the right to be.
“There are still adopt an Alpha programs.”
It was like taking a shower after a long patrol. The hot water beating down on his skin, banishing the sticky sweat and grime that squeezed itself through layers of protective gear; suffocating him with steam as he was purged.
“I do believe that is out of budget.”
Sherlock started kneading John’s neck. John glanced up at him. He seemed completely unaware as he continued to talk.
“Afraid my virtue pissed off some time in university.”
He ignored the file. Mycroft pushed it closer.
He inhaled. Once. Twice and slumped against the wall. The scent of Sherlock and home nestled against him, driving away from the blank of the hotel. He wrapped it tighter and stuffed some of it in his mouth, trying to take in as much as possible.
“Don’t believe so, Mr. Holmes,” the woman answered.
“Alright. Be right in. Thanks.”
“I didn’t know what to do, John!” Mrs. Hudson said urgently. “An unbonded Omega just showed up at the door. I couldn’t very well leave him on the street, could I?”
“Maybe.”
“If you’d step behind the screen and strip down, we can get started. Which would you like first? The gray or navy?”
“No. None.”
Sherlock sighed. “Think. Who has access to the autopsies?”
“You won’t improve if I do all the work. Keep going.”
John gripped the sink and rocked himself, head bowed and eyes closed.
“Green is so last season,” Sherlock said. Sherlock walked to the top of the bed and picked up the O-lariat. “May I?”
John started wanking in earnest, biting down on his lower lip. He didn’t want Sherlock to hear him. He ground his arse against the wall, craving more than his pants sticking to his skin. If he’d worn an Omega pair he’d be able to just pop right over and help himself. Or Sherlock could stick his fingers right in as John leaned over him and buried his nose in Sherlock’s scent gland.
“Despite my excellent control, I can assure you I am an Alpha.” Sherlock regarded their hands. He breathed in deeply, his eyes fluttering closed. John swallowed and Sherlock inhaled again. “I have found myself ill-equipped to deal with my instinctual reactions.”
Sherlock sat in the dark of the flat, legs stretched out across the floor. His head hung off the back of the chair and his hands clapped together under his chin. His ratty pajamas made John wonder if he’d been sitting there since he’d bothered to wake up.
“No. But why’d you suddenly fancy a shopping trip? Two weeks ago, you said my clothing looked like and I quote ‘the rejects from the bottom of the bargain bin at a charity shop after the sale.’ Remember that bit?”
“Well, what am I supposed to think, hm? You said this wasn’t your area. We had sex because you thought it would help me.”
John gulped down the water on the table and a horrified expression claimed his face.
“Maybe we should go, Oliver,” the chaperone said nervously.
“You weighed the consequences of going to jail for a man you had known less than two days and then made an educated choice. I saw my best friend going mad from instincts and then made an educated choice. Different consequences, but choices of similar magnitude, I expect.”
“Right. Sorry. I was just worried, that’s all.” John looked down at his hands, trying to be bashful. “I know it’s expected but I thought it wouldn’t hurt to stop by and have a quick chat, just to catch up. Is he due home soon?”
“Right.” Oliver shifted. “Will you let me know?
“It’s a shame you couldn’t come into an earlier fitting,” Noah said to John as he stepped out. “Normally, this would be the third one, to tighten everything up.”
“It’s how I met him. Watched him fuck my fiancé.”
There was an Omega in the flat. John stopped on the threshold, his nostrils flaring. Oliver from the A/O club sat primly on the couch fully decked out in jewelry and his coat neatly folded over his lap. A completely different presentation than the other night. An Omega chaperone with an excessively large bonding pin perched next to him and sipped on tea as Mrs. Hudson doled out biscuits. The dim sum hit against John’s leg. They should have eaten at the restaurant
“You’ll never end up in a skip, or the Thames, or anywhere else his fat arse wants to put you. You are the conductor of my light, John. You belong right here. I’ll assure it.”
John’s world tilted on its axis. Just a little bit. He attempted to hide his surprise by clearing his throat. Generally, someone just didn’t ask their flatmate to scent them like they were asking for a cuppa. Especially, their Omega flatmate. Granted. That was probably a unique situation.
“In real life maybe. Here you’re almost in the crypt. Holmes is doing pretty good though. Still has his trousers on. Longest I’ve ever seen an Alpha last. Too bad Henry’s missing it. He’s fucked off this last month or something after his heat.”
Sherlock presented himself over a daybed, one leg stretched out and the other bent to touch the floor. He had made a giant arrow to his crotch. His head was propped up on his bent elbow and a slight smirk warmed his face. A group of Omegas crowded around him, vying for his attention. John let out a breath. Right.
“You are. Well.” John stopped. “Those are things an Alpha would want for their first rut and,” John cut himself off.
“Case, John.”
He stared.
Noah motioned for John to stretch his arms straight out and John obeyed. Noah fussed with the collars and his scent drifted up. It was sweet, like a forgotten apple rotting on the counter. That particular note of cloying had suffocated John’s childhood and followed him into his adulthood with Harry. It's why he found it so difficult to be in the same room as her, even when his suppressants had been working. The two of them were already haunted with notes of Hamish in their personal scents and it was worse when Harry drenched herself with booze. Apparently, the dredges of John’s suppressants were just completely tits up. Scents shouldn’t be affecting him this much.
“You’re going to have to be more specific, Dr. Watson.”
“Not going to clean it then?”
John flexed his hands over his thighs. He shrugged and pulled his eyes off the ceiling. “You said this stuff wasn’t your area.”
“Yeah. Yeah. I saw that arse when he walked out and how trim that suit was. Mine's let herself go. Said I wasn’t going anywhere.” George pinched his face. “Fucking cunts’ right, isn’t she? Me or you can’t go anywhere. We’re stuck.”
“Really?”
John barely managed to keep his protest to himself when Sherlock pulled away. Wasn’t he enjoying himself? John was such a good Omega. Alpha could have more if he wanted.
Act like an Omega. There was some truth to it.
Habits. Cocaine.
John rolled off his side. He flexed his fingers and pried his eyes open. Sherlock watched him with open curiosity as he grabbed a few pillows. John lifted his hips off the bed and Sherlock propped John’s arse up.
“High praise,” John responded.
At thirteen, then fourteen, and the first months into fifteen there was little John could do against a grown Alpha who wanted to manhandle him. All Hamish had to do was grab John’s shoulder or let out an excessive amount of pheromones that would freeze him from the inside out. He’d be paralyzed for whatever Hamish wanted to do with him.
The dildo stopped moving. John whined at the loss. Please.
“Yeah. I am.”
“I do smell it. Tell me or I’m cleaning the fridge out and going through your sock index.”
“John. It’s fine.”
“More?” John took in the two boxes and groaned. “Are you serious?”
“Of course,” the chaperone said. “I’ll call the car over.”
“I’m not done. Just a few more minutes. Really, John.”
The two of them looked like a proper couple to anyone watching. John glanced briefly at the other occupants. He had originally thought they had just tucked into the lobby for varying reasons but actually looking and then seeing; it was obvious they were security.
“The answer is no,” John said.
John grimaced. “You didn’t need to say it. Ta.”
“Oh, please. No reason for such dramatics,” Mycroft said distastefully. He nudged John’s glass of water, eying John like he was a pet who puked in his shoe and wasn’t quite sure what to do about it. “I assure you the practice is still widely accepted due to our dismal Omega birth rate.”
“No, I listened. I just think it's a load of shite.”
John was struck with how young Oliver was. A teenager sat before him, one hardly out of his majority, with a sexual preference that was considered taboo among most of the UK. The laws that had started to pass parliament in the last few years hardly touched on decades of systematic sexism and deep-rooted bigotry.
“On your front,” Sherlock instructed.
“He’s a smug arse,” Sally said.
“How many years of schooling is that?”
Sherlock squinted at her. “I didn’t do anything.”
Sherlock flicked out his ID and then reached into John’s back pocket and fished out his wallet. He placed both IDs on the counter and Jenny mumbled thanks as she typed on her keyboard. She hardly glanced at Sherlock’s ID and focused solely on John’s. She ran it through a card reader obscured under the desk and offered both of them back.
John stared down at the question on the tablet and choked on his tea. He thumped his chest until he was able to collect himself.
John ended the call. He removed the required clinic diffusers and flushed the room with neutralizer with a flick of a switch. He stood under the vent, letting the chemical smell strip him. He tucked his fingers under his collar, ran them along his ears and wrists before just holding still. He used to skip this step when he never had to worry about his Beta spray fading and his scent leaking through. The neutralizer clicked off after a few minutes and he headed out.
“Just being polite.”
“I don’t plan on having any,” John said.
Sherlock tilted his head. “Interesting.”
“Help with what? He’s dead, isn’t he?” Oliver’s face crumpled and he sucked in another breath. “Fuck off.”
Right.
John cleared his throat, interrupting. “That’s wrong,” John said.
“No, that’s enough, I think. You did well,” the Alpha soothed.
When his suppressors wore out, would he even be able to stand shagging a Beta? One of the few extensively observed things about Omegas was their sexual habits. John knew the score very well.
He swallowed.
John had another sip.
“Why don’t you say that when you leave toes next to the leftovers?” John asked.
“Mine would have thrown a bloody fit.”
“You do not call my Omega a frigid cunt,” Sherlock said, enunciating every word. He pulled John into a half hug. “Sorry,” he breathed into John. “I did not mean to alarm you.”
“Sorry,” John said. “I’ve bollocksed it.”
“I think your training has been coming along very well, hasn’t it? You haven’t gone off to bark at Anderson.”
Lestrade cleared his throat and ran a hand over his jacket. Tabby rushed back to the table and sat herself down.
“Good. Can you walk?” Sherlock asked John. “I’ve changed my mind. We’re leaving. Mycroft is a horrid fat arse.”
The knot looked large. It would feel nice up his arse as it filled out, stretching him. It’d feel nice now. It had been a long time since he’d been bounced on someone’s prick. Alphas never let him. A Beta had. Once. If Sherlock sat down, John could probably persuade him to let John help himself.

"Oh no, no, no," John chuckled, "It wasn’t even a good idea to kiss you in the first place, in your current state."

(breathily)
SHERLOCK
Oh, YOUR John... I see. So, what's up with your John Watson these days? Anything new in your John's life?
SHERLOCK

John is too chuffed having the upper hand (for once) to be annoyed. He leans against the counter watching Sherlock pace.
Astronomy, yes. In a binary star system, two stars orbit around a common center. They both have their own independent orbits but harmoniously share the same corner of space. Are you with me so far?
Sherlock...
Hey, keep your wellies on Rosie!
"Shit, Sherlock. Are we really doing this?" John asked breathlessly.
