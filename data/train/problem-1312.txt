John was half expecting the younger man to push his luck so was pleasantly surprised when he raised his hands instead.
The Dom was beginning to seriously think 3 months wasn't going to be enough with Sherlock. It had happened once in his career where a sub had needed longer, that had been a case of abuse too. It had been so long ago, he hadn't been in his financial state then and he was working out of a small apartment in London city centre. Mycroft had joked about lengthening the time when they'd discussed Sherlock's contract all those weeks ago, but maybe the eldest Holmes was right. Maybe his younger brother did need more time. There was still such a lot for him to learn.
"I think I'll do the same to Mycroft in a minute. He looks like he would enjoy it."
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock's voice was quiet, subdued.
"Leg down!" She barked. That wimpy side of her they had witnessed a few minutes ago had long since gone.
“I don't think-”
"Sherlock do you think you can get on your feet for me?"
"I know you didn't, but you have to be more careful and it's not just about that. It's about your attitude since then." Greg sighed. Maybe we should send you away for a couple of days. Put Anthea in charge of you for a bit."
“Yeah, but we only want to know where they are. The bigger the gap in cameras, that's where he'll be.”
The brothers decided to make a hasty exit before Rosie could make another grab for them.
"For uncuffing me."
"Well you've done a number on this. I'll strap your foot up again and then you can get changed."
John smiled in relief, bending over to hug his boyfriend. Sherlock let him, but didn't participate. "Nope. Not good enough. I need to know that you're in this with me. I need you to hug me back."
Greg spotted it but just snorted, choosing not to mention it. “Daddy! Your go,” he had to say something, or Finn would give himself away.
It was a measure of how much things had changed between them that Mycroft didn’t snipe back. He patted Amy's ankle. "Just so. For a time, anyway."
Sherlock had squeezed his eyes shut. The machine was fucking into him relentlessly and the lube was burning something fierce.
“Second escape attempt. You can kneel there for 20 minutes, thinking about what you have done. Is that understood?”
The lift doors opened and they dragged John out of the Yard and towards the street where Greg's car was.
The Superintendent reached over and gripped Mycroft's chin tightly in his hand. "Do not argue with me."
"I know what you are thinking, boy. But don't. If you do I will lock it up in a cage and give the key to your PA."
"Better," the younger man praised, smacking Mycroft's arse again, then he dropped onto the bed, sitting beside his boy's prone form. "I'm trying to decide what I want to do with you today."
“I’m not waking you up for me to go for a piss.” Sherlock was angry again. Did Mycroft know this was going to happen? Because if he did, an argument was inevitable when they next spoke as was a punch in the face for the older Holmes brother. He gritted his teeth as the Dom spoke once more.
Sherlock looked at the ceiling as if that would help him justify how this man was such a moron. Instead, he rolled his eyes, letting him continue.
Sherlock turned and kicked the hated chest of toys over, sending it flying. "Don't. Don't compare my feelings for her to my feelings for John."
“Walk,” he ordered.
The Dom took his time, tightening every strap he could as tight as he could, even joining it to his collar by the buckle at the top. It forced Sherlock to remain completely still, with the posture collar the way it was. John knew that as he removed the cuffs and added the fingerless gloves to the bottom.
Finn had got the game and put it on the coffee table. He was sat on the floor and Mycroft had dragged Sherlock’s chair over next to him.
“Stand up for me, pet.” Sherlock obeyed this time and John could only describe the look on his face as relief when he saw the cushion rather than… John froze at the thought of what might have been used to punish him if he entered Panic before.
"Good." John climbed out of bed. "Will you help me make sure Sherlock eats something? What do you think he wants?"
“Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.”
John spotted the open window the other side of the room. It had previously been covered up and he had completely forgotten about it, but the brat must have spotted it at some point, he really was clever… observant, but then again he knew that, he had met his brother. So he had found a way out and then what… climbed? Down the building and just sat by the door. Why hadn’t he run off? He had ample opportunity. And all his stuff, he had been left alone for an hour. He had more than enough time to get his stuff and throw it out of the window. Maybe he hadn’t been trying to escape, maybe it was something else.
Greg laughed. "'Ow, sir?' Seriously?" With that, he brought his hand down several times in a row.
A short blond woman nodded once with a cheeky smirk as she brought the coffee pot across the room.
"The life of a sub, eh?"
“No, sir,” he replied in agreement. He was slightly anxious at a stranger coming in, but despite the trouble he was in at the moment, he was aware that the doctor wouldn't bring another person like Wilkes in and leave him alone.
John settled behind his desk where there was already a coffee waiting for him.
"Look at my boy, getting all impatient. Isn't it adorable?"
“My microscope?”
They sat like that for as long as they dared, the time for meeting with Greg and Mycroft drawing near.
"I was hoping you were gonna tell me how you were going to prove to me you're sorry. But instead you want to get off?"
"Stop," John ordered next.
"You're cute too, sir," Sherlock added quickly. He hadn't meant it in that way, but Mycroft was pouting and it was rather adorable. He huffed a laugh into John's neck. "You're not cute, sir, you're gorgeous. Rugged. Handsome. Sexy."
"You alright, Sherlock?" He called in softly.
“And who mentioned anything about my brother?”
The blond shook his head. “No. He always misses it. Never fails to point out the fact actually.”
“You’ve lived with me for a month, pet, it is okay.”
"Don't push me." Irene lowered her voice. "I'll do whatever it takes to get out of here alive."
Some small part of Sherlock had hoped that something small had happened to John during their last visit. Then he would have an excuse that Eurus couldn't argue with. The main part of him was overjoyed to see him and Rosie absolutely fine.
Sherlock worked his jaw for a moment. “I... sir, I... didn’t kneel when you came into the room.”
“38. I gave you a choice. I warned you. If you cooperated you could have been in the more comfortable position. Your own fault I’m afraid,” John didn’t sound as apologetic as his words seemed to make out. He forced Sherlock’s hands up to behind his head. “They will stay there, or there will be consequences.”
“No, not right now,” he glared angrily at Sherlock. “I'll be over to collect statements whenever I get a chance.”
“Because I’m not meant to be in here, sir,” he said slightly quieter.
"Get up!" Irene barked at him, but he just lay there. She kicked him in the side. "Get up, I said!"
"Why?"
The van had been driven off at speed and was going so fast with so many random turns, Sherlock couldn't keep track, despite his avid knowledge of London. He doubted anyone saw it, and even if they did they wouldn't register it as abnormal. It was London at rush hour. And even if it wasn't, people were hardly observant.
“Get up then.”
He was very much out of Panic now, but didn’t seem to want to be. John knew how stupid that thought alone was, but if one word could be used for Sherlock it was unique.
Sherlock woke one freezing January night, practically shivering. He glanced across the bed at John, he was so deep asleep, a bomb could have landed above them and he wouldn't have even flinched. But he did look cold as well...
“Told you that you would like it.”
“Sherlock, phone Greg.”
Greg glanced over his shoulder. "There's services about a mile and a half away."
Mycroft growled in annoyance. "So you don't want him to die, but you do want to play either. Make your bloody mind up, little sister!"
“Seriously, shut it, mate,” he called back between the seats. For once he wished the detective would do as he was told.
When he looked up and saw who it was, he pushed himself off the bunk and to his knees with a heavy thud. The action itself made him seem defeated. “Sir, I'm sorry.”
“No, sir.”
"Shh," the doctor soothed with a low tone, he ran his hand through his air again.
"Hmm," Greg whispered, relaxing against the Dom's knee. "But we love it."
“No, pet.”
"Umph! Sir!"
Greg laughed. "Alright, but I won't go easy on you just because you asked for it. I'm going to make it hurt."
He quickly gave him another bit before he got impatient. This time he received a “thank you, sir,” when he swallowed, but he didn’t look up like he had for the first bite. Maybe the detective had seen that flash of hurt…
John tightened his grip. “When I tell you to do something or not to do something. You obey me. Are we clear on that?”
John spent his time watching Mrs. Holmes. The more testimony Mycroft gave, the paler she looked. The barrister sitting with her didn’t look any too pleased himself. Every now and again, he leant over and said something to her. She never answered, just kept her mouth set in a thin line.
“87 missed calls.”
“You can do that. What about me? Shall I get a blanket? We could move this to the bed?”
"You would never tell!"
“I'll just tie you down, boy.” He put a hand on Sherlock's chest and pushed him back. The younger man went back without resistance. “Lay still.” He quickly returned his ankles to the spot they'd been tied to moments before. The only difference now being he was naked bar his cuffs and collar.
The sub had come in 5 hours late, after he'd specifically told Sherlock he'd be home at 3 o clock.
Whilst they had been talking, Mycroft had crawled to the centre of the room and knelt up. He dared a quick glance over his shoulder to look at them.
"Mycroft, tell me now."
Some of the colour that had left Mycroft's face at Sherlock's revelation returned. "I can't believe you met him and didn't- Nevermind. I'm glad you are still here."
“Leave your hands behind your head. You will not like this. It will not be pleasant, but go along with it and it will all be over quicker.”
"God, now he's being petty." John reached for the gag again. "Well I know what I can do about that."
“You could just not punish me at all, sir,” he replied cheekily.
“Yeah, I pick pocket him when he’s annoying. You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat.” The detective seemed quite proud by that fact.
“Whatever!” The detective snapped.
“He's less than a mile away, Greg your car is out the front, right?”

John sat on the bed on the play side of the room, facing the kneeling man. "Warned you earlier about your attitude. What did I say would happen if it didn't make a u turn?"
“Pet!”
John snickered at his boy’s poor attempt at an explanation. “I won’t stop you working this case, but if your attitude should persist later we will be having more than words. Is that clear?”
"I know he has a temper."
John shook his head and picked up the strap he had put on his desk. He had even made sure Sherlock had seen him put it there.
It was weird, facing up to all this so many years after the event. He glanced towards Finn. He was glad he was doing it though. The boy’s parents had plead guilty so there had been no trial for Finn to worry about.
It was clear to the Dom, the confusion on Sherlock's face. He dropped to his haunches and held his face in both his hands.
Sherlock winked at him. "I decline to answer."
“Calm down a little first, mate.”
John paused to think about it for a moment. "You learnt it could be good with no consequence." He'd had plans. Long plans on what to do with the sub today but after the clamp scenario... Sherlock needed to know it could be enjoyed.
“Hide,” Sherlock said quickly, and the pair of them scrambled into the front room and under the table.
Her bag and threw them at John. “Deal with them John, before I do.”
Sherlock grunted as his cuffed wrists were grabbed by his sister and yanked upwards. "One, mistress. Two mistress." Sherlock kept counting, keeping his voice flat and indifferent.
"Sir, please no, it would drive me mad." As soon as Mycroft had said it, he knew he had made a mistake, Greg's grin had doubled in size.
“Not just you. You and Sherlock.”
“11, s-sir. M-May I have another, sir?”
The sub didn't find it as annoying now as he had a few days ago when John had first forced him to piss with his company.
That was the problem.
“I’m just amazed at the turn of events, sir.”
The remaining few would be painful, especially as Sherlock must have already been feeling the left over throb from his previous spanking.
“Sherlock,” John hissed, but the younger man just glared at him as he reached down and pulled Finn onto his lap. “All this is said with your agreement, Finn, you come first. If you don't want it to happen, it won't.”
“No, sir,” he murmured and sucked on the straw when it was pushed between his lips. “What about you, sir?” he asked when he was done. His voice was barely above a whisper and John struggled to hear him.
He disappeared into the bathroom to have a quick wash, thinking on Sherlock's behaviour the whole time, when he returned he had to grab Sherlock as the sub tried to force himself to his knees.

"This is nothing," the detective countered with a smirk. "Serbia was worse."
Irene hooked her finger into the collar at Sherlock's neck and tugged him forward. It made the detective choke as it tightened.
"You aren't the only one, Sherlock."
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock's voice was close to a moan as he avoided shifting too much.
“At least you didn’t attempt to run naked this time.” John’s voice was dangerously low and Sherlock knew he was playing with fire.
The detective nodded. It was so big, he wasn’t about to try and expel it on his own.
“So why are you in here?”
Greg laughed. "Get on the bench, boy."
"Sherlock, this is your last warning!" John growled.
John hit himself in the forehead with the palm of his hand. "Mate, we should have seen that coming a mile away."
John had to agree with that.
"Good. But first, play with them some more."

He untied Sherlock once again and tugged him unresisting to his feet, then to his knees.
“I am not going to punish you right this moment,” John began, “because I was in the middle of a nice chat with your brother, but don’t think for a second you are going to be getting away with this.”
"Yeah right."
“You didn’t let me down, sir,” Sherlock said eventually. “I should have told you more.”
The government official was watching the DI, he didn’t get to see this protective streak very often and it was rather arousing, despite the situation. “No, I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t even like to know what he would do to me if I did. So would you like to know where you went wrong?” he asked, not waiting for an answer. He pointed at his brother. “Him.” It would always be him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m an adult John.”
Sherlock stepped forward, so he was closer to the man who was leaning against his cab that was pulled up beside the curb.
Sherlock stared at his brother as he held his pizza.
"Go ahead and suck, pet."
John reached over and ran his hand through Sherlock's hair, he decided not to mention. "Is your leg hurting, pet?"
Before he was dragged from the van a soft lined blindfold was tugged over his eyes. He didn't struggle as he was manhandled from the back of the vehicle.
“No other word it can be. Question is: why did she wait until she was dying to write it?”
With a loud deliberate sigh, Sherlock dropped to his knees, for once not making John repeat himself.
Sherlock scowled. "Why don't I get to drink all of it and you do?"
John reached over and clipped the detective on the back of the head. "Be quiet, trouble, or I'll tie you down again."
John laughed. "And I don't want to hear 'bored' again." John pushed Sherlock's face down into the seat and grabbed his flailing arms. He slipped the cuffs around his wrists and pulled him upright.
Greg grabbed his sub by the arm and he and John separated the brothers.
Sherlock wriggled his arse trying to dislodge the nozzle, but it was too well seated. All he got for his trouble was a smack on the arse. He should have known it wouldn't work. Apart from that smack on the arse, he had no idea who else was still in the room.
“You… you p-punished m-me, sir.”
Immediately the detective knelt upright.
John must have been dozing because he jerked at the sound of the tray on the table and looked over to see his sub on his knees. Knelt in his perfect position, his posture spot on.
Eurus watched her big brother's face with interest. "That was amazing."
Mycroft got down on his knees and tried to concentrate solely on his Dom. He used his long reach and stabbed at a piece of fruit and offered it to Greg.
“Good boy.” He sat on the bed beside him and raised his hand to cup his cheek. He smiled when the sub didn’t flinch or pull away through annoyance. “I’ll offer you a compromise. Think about whether you want to sleep with me or not and we will discuss it tomorrow after your punishment.”
“So if this surveillance of yours is so bloody good, why did they let Wilkes in?”
Sherlock had to dash behind a stack of crates as the box was loaded in the back of a truck. He rose up and looked over the crates, wondering if he could get in the back of the truck.
His head was pushed forward so John could release his hands and remove the leash that kept him in such an awkward position.
“But, gov, I-”
As the doctor accepted his tea, he watched Sherlock closely. His sub had given only the slightest twitch at John's order to Mycroft. It was obvious the detective wanted to be the one serving his Dom, but he had to earn the privilege.
After several long moments, the Superintendent pulled back and looked his friend in the eyes. "Let's go find your Dom, alright?" he asked. At Sherlock’s nod, they started walking towards the other two men in the distance.
Sherlock barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes as he sucked.
John couldn't seem to calm him down. Not until, Sherlock pushed him away and got to his feet. Then he ran across the room and cannoned into his brother holding him instead.
"Oh, of course," the Dominatrix said with false cheer. She placed the stool back under Sherlock and he breathed in deeply in relief.
“It might be.”
“Shall we reconvene in the dining room? I've had your favourite prepared, Irene.”
“Newly transferred actually, a promotion of sorts.” The jerk was still grinning.
"Gregory-"
Something about his sub's posture made him realise that the second he turned his back he would no longer be in the corner.
Irene smiled. “Soon you’ll be angry and upset. Hey, junior?"
“I don't want you showing me or yourself up today. If I have to, I will gag you for the duration. Is that going to be needed?”
John tied the cuffs to a bolt on the floor, Greg had prepared the place well.
Mycroft grumbled something, trying to spin and face the other three men. When he had nearly managed it, Greg reached out and pushed him back around.
“Mrs. Hudson?”
John took a hard look at the expression on Mycroft's face. The sub looked quite chastened, but still determined to look out for his little brother.
He obeyed, but John knew it was because it was an order rather than because he wanted to and was waiting for permission.
The detective worked his jaw a few times, then seemed to come up with an answer. "You're not boring when we work exciting cases together, sir."
"It's a room," Sherlock pointed out for no reason.
Mycroft hadn't moved beyond the doorway. He was staring at the floor, wishing he had some insight to offer the other two men. His brother had always been difficult, but this eluded even his understanding.
“Nothing, sir.”
"Verbal answer, pet," John's tone was only slightly sharper than normal but it was clear he meant it.
The Dom took a deep breath but didn’t release his hold over the boy, he knew his game. Safe wording would end everything, it would cancel the contract instantly and they both knew that. It was the moment of truth. “Well?”
He made sure his hand was in Sherlock's curls, reminding him of his presence for a moment as he turned to his guests. “Excuse us, make yourselves comfortable in the sitting room if you wish.” He bent down to pick Sherlock up.
She could tell by the look on Mycroft's face, he knew that.
“Yes, sir,” the officer was clearly a sub himself because he flicked the lights and siren on immediately.
“Don't say anything, Sherlock. Not until we've got you a lawyer. Watch your head,” he ordered pressing him down into the back seat.
"That's it, you gorgeous thing," John told him, "you're completely mine."
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whispered. He didn’t like being near this room, this was the room he’d spent a whole day in. Alone. The thought of that made a shiver shoot up his spine.
“I didn't do it, sir!” Sherlock replied, worried that John believed the worst of him. Worried he believed he was a murderer...
“It’s ‘may I’. You’re asking for permission, not asking if it is physically possible.” It may have been petty in Sherlock's point of view, but to John it was normal and part of the routine, he had also made it quite clear he would start as he meant to go on.
The detective's eyebrows climbed to his fringe. “You're not pregnant. Explain.”
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s not that I don’t. It’s that I remember it all. I don’t need the pictures.”
"You are so far gone," John said with a smile.
“Did Sherlock come through here?”
“On your knees, pet,” Greg ordered the government official and took his chair as he vacated it.
John had screwed his face up behind the younger man and poked his tongue out. When Sherlock turned around John acted completely normal, that seemed to help bring the boy out of his corner as he laughed.
John turned to the mirror in the hallway when his sub had disappeared and finished tweaking his tie. Then he followed on and as expected Sherlock was where he’d ordered him, his hands behind his back, one loosely holding his phone.
Irene sighed and reclined in her chair. "When you break a man… their spirit is gone completely. His… his is just not giving a shit."
It was a fair few minutes before John had cleared his head enough to slide in beside his brat on the back seat.
Satisfied his sub was naked and pliant, he pushed him down to sit on the bench.
All that did was fuelled him on to thrash even more.
“Bollocks,” John hissed.
Sherlock was more than happy to get to his feet. He still wasn’t sure on the kneeling thing. He didn’t understand how it made him feel. He didn’t know that he wanted to understand.
"We shall see about that." Irene, drawn as always to Sherlock, walked over to him and cupped his cheek.
John yanked off Sherlock's trousers and pants. Now his boy was properly exposed, but he was still sporting an ill temper. The Dom grabbed a leather binder and, together, he and Greg got it around Sherlock's arms. It wrapped around them from wrists to elbows, binding his arms together behind his back.
“That is how your posture will be when I say present. Is that understood?”
When John saw that on his boy's face, he gave him another few minutes then stopped the flow of water.
The younger sub’s head found John's knee within moments.
The detective didn’t respond. He didn’t want the situation worse. This was bad enough.
"Irene, you are completely useless," Eurus said, rolling her eyes. "Guards, put her with the idiots."
The lowering of the kneeling man’s head was the only response the doctor needed. “I am not against the additional surveillance, now more than ever, seeing as the sort of people this one has had the misfortune of meeting, but I should have been told!”
He shoved his sub to the floor by the door, his hand pushed into the handle of the leash. He began tapping at the code for the alarm. Sherlock huffed as his wrists got closer together, his contract cuffs joining to one another behind him.
"But-"
"Has it got anything to do with the £800000.00 withdrawals over the last week?"
"Hmph."
"No problem," he glanced over towards Mycroft. "I suppose that one wants you now."
John noticed he was still holding the small black wallet he had waved at the cab. He took the warrant card out of his sub’s hand, still breathing heavily. He flipped it open. “This is Greg’s.”
He took Finn's hand and dragged him into the flat, knowing that his brother would follow.
The shower prooved to be incredibly large. It was practically a room in and of itself. There was more than enough room for the four of them.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder and glared as John played with his hole.
"I believe someone is in the need of cuddles," John said as he finished his beer. He set the bottle aside and wrapped his arm around Sherlock. "Are you ready for said cuddles, or would you like to stew a bit more first?"
Sherlock ducked his head, hating both options.
Sherlock soon found out where the chain went. They went straight to a set of clamps at his nipples that John dealt with swiftly.
He flagged down a cab and climbed in. He told the cabbie his destination, then leant back in the seat. It was all he could do not to fidget. He palmed his brother's ID in his pocket, trusting it was enough. It had been enough for UNIT but he doubted that's what this place was.
“Even if you bumped into her on a street, Sherlock. Anything, ok?”
"In the corner. Facing it," John ordered as he marched in behind him.
Siger had overheard and he laughed. “You’re kidding right? I brought the boys’ with me,” he patted his own rucksack. “You can't go in dressed like that though.”
The older Dom shook his head. "I doubt he will Dom again."
Mycrofts eyes widened in shock when he saw his brother, ignoring the Doms he got to his feet, "Sherlock, what happened, are you ok?"
"I'll see you soon, Finn," the government official assured the little boy. He moved in and took him from Sherlock’s arms so he could hug him properly.
“I guessed you’d be pretty pissed off with me in a minute so it’d be back to you calling me boy again. I thought I’d save myself the hassle of having to move.”
With a smirk, John placed his hand in the Superintendent's hair. "How's that? Is it good for you?"
“Wouldn’t be a game if you knew. You’re the one who chooses.”
Sherlock didn't reply, John reached around him and flicked the shower off. "Come on, babe," he took him by the hand and dragged him out of the bathroom.
Irene removed one of the clamps from each of the Holmes brother's nipples. "Good boy. Say 'what is your pleasure, mistress?'"
The Superintendent shook his head ruefully. "When are we going to learn?"
"Oh, don't worry about him, little Lockie," Eurus sang. "I would worry about yourself."
“Do you want the paddle?” John offered, not entirely joking, if he was more willing to have that as a punishment he would offer it, but from his hate list, the paddle was the most despised area of punishment.
Finn paused in front of the detective. “Sowwy, Daddy.”
Sherlock slipped out of his suit jacket that John had hold of and rushed into 221A.
She laughed. "No, I think he used to be better at hiding it but something happened." Irene brought her fingertips to her lips. "That was you, wasn't it? You happened."
A lot of muffled yelling was the response.
“Yes, sir,” he sighed. He looked his Dom up and down. He'd clearly had his own suit dropped off when he had been doing his little jogging session. He smiled at the hand that was held out waiting for him.
Mycroft chuckled. "Arrest me, sir? For what?"
“Tea?”
“Do you want to wake up?”
“John-” Sherlock was trying to be angry but his eyes were red-rimmed and it didn’t work. At least not what John could see of him.
Sherlock let out a soft chuckle but shook his head. "No, sir."
Sherlock looked away, determined to hide the smile of appreciation at the slight praise. It would not get to him. It would not!
John used the leash to control him, the only way he could when the boy was behaving like a prat. “I said on your knees!” John's tone brooked no argument. Sherlock must have noticed, but that didn't stop his gaze from darting up to stare at him.
At that, Sherlock blushed, both from embarrassment that John had noticed and from pleasure. He ducked his head. "Thank you, sir."
“It was only a matter of time, he’s called me Uncle Mycroft for the last fortnight.” He turned on his father. “Grandad.”
"Mycroft, stay," he ordered, as if Mycroft might get up and wander off.
He rushed over and removed the skillet from the hob and set it aside. The whole time, he kept his eyes on Sherlock. "Get away from that thing." He wasn't entirely convinced that the thing wasn't his uncle.
Only just now Mycroft realised he was back in his suit and Sherlock wasn't.
Sherlock nearly spat the soap out, he needed to speak, needed to apologise. He hated this. This way John did things. Dragging punishments out when they weren't spankings. Making him think about what he'd done. Why couldn't he just throw him over his knee and get it over with? He quickly realised that’s what made John different. That’s what made John so effective when it came to disciplining him.
“Come on,” he jiggled the boy in his arms. “Or we will be late.”
It came as a complete surprise when John used the crop to flick the pegs off of his nipples one at a time. After that his Dom used his fingers to twist them this way and that. Sherlock closed his eyes, then opened them wide when John bit down on his nipples, hard.
With an irritated shake of his head, Greg placed his foot on the back of his boy's neck. "No matter how many chances I give you, you still manage to get yourself in trouble."
The Dom made sure he remained in sight and when the time was up he reached for the leash running down the boy's back and tugged him towards the kitchen.
Irene opened the plug and started popping chunks of ice into it. She filled it as tightly as she could. "You can set the bowl down now, crop boy. I need you to get this one turned around." She patted Sherlock on the cheek.
Across the room, Mycroft was on his feet, all the toys had gone.
“He went bleurgh in the bathroom.”
"Yes. You've been doing it a lot the last few days with the 'im fine's. Forget it for now."
"Where is she going?"
John left him to it, using the free time productively. He did, however, flick on the CCTV camera in the sub’s bedroom so he could check he arrived there and didn’t leave, which he would not put passed the younger man. His tendencies for mood swings were not well enough controlled for him not to suddenly decide to be rebellious and run off, or at least walk around and find some form of a distraction in other rooms, rooms he wasn’t meant to be in. But when the screen buzzed and the 4 cameras that were positioned in each corner focused, he saw him pace the bottom of his bed, violin in hand.
The Dom tugged at the leash he still held in his hand. “You’re failing at the proper respect again, pet.” John’s tone was calm hence the term of address, but there a touch of army Captain steel present.
John gripped Greg's hair, tight in his hand and he winced. "You still haven't come, boy, do you want to?"
Sherlock crumpled into a pile and didn't move. He should have done better. He had wanted to please John, but he had opened his mouth, never a good idea during punishment.
"No you didn't," Sherlock accused.
"Well-" Mycroft searched for a word that summed up how he felt. "Fuck."
John let the pegs stay in place for a bit then he took one off and moved it to a different location on Sherlock's cock. He felt himself getting hard from the change in his boy's breathing.
He glanced down and saw his wet trousers.
Sherlock obeyed his Dom and started sucking intently. "Hmm. Not bad I suppose." For a moment, John pushed the blindfold up to see the boy.
“Yes, sir,” he whispered.
The praise went straight to Sherlock’s head and he smiled slightly against the leather he was leant against.
Chest heaving, Sherlock let his legs fold beneath him. "I want to go home."
John shows Sherlock what fun can be had.
“Now.” John’s sharp Dom tone was back and it had the desired effect. Sherlock turned and closed the door quickly, practically skipped over to him, and dropped to his knees a lot faster than when John had told him to present moments ago in his bedroom. It must have been the immediate sense of reward.
At the mansion, Sherlock got Finn out of the car and carried him in without waking him. He'd known he'd fall asleep. All three of the kids had been asleep within minutes of the journey starting.
Anyway, enjoy!
Once at the university, he quickly found the labs. It didn't take him long to find the one with the best equipment. He searched through the many devices until he found what he was looking for.
“Thank you, Sam,” John smiled at him and forced Sherlock to kneel beside the only seat set up in the back.
“Thought not. Go.”
Irene slapped the oldest Holmes to shut him up. "Only Sherlock asking nicely will get him down."
John didn't make him repeat it louder, that was the first time the younger man had done the correct thing for nearly a week.
Sherlock’s mouth was wrapped around the usual ball gag, if it wasn’t there, he’d be panting like mad. Instead he stared at the floor as if that would help matters.
John poked the tip of the riding crop handle into Sherlock's hole as a warning. The sub stopped struggling for a moment, then started up again. The Dom pushed it in deeper. He kept the crop there until Mycroft had created another enema and set it up. John smirked as he pushed the hose back into his boy's hole.
Mycroft stood at the door, looking worried. As he watched on, John tore off a bite of toast and ate it himself. The next bite was offered to Sherlock who accepted it after a moment's hesitation.
"Oi! That may work on witnesses, but I know better, boy." John slapped his sub's thigh. "Out of bed with you."
Irene actually laughed. "Oh come on, Sherly, cant you do better than that?"
Irene laughed and tugged at Sherlock's cock once again.
Greg held a peg just at the tip of Mycroft's cock. It was the last one he planned to place before he started flicking them off both the subs with his crop. When he let it close down on tender flesh, the government official closed his eyes and groaned.
Sherlock tried, he really did try to get his leg to cooperate, but as he tried to stand it gave way completely.
Both of John's hands went to his hair and gripped it tightly.
Sherlock knelt upright, enjoying John's fingers in his hair. He let his eyes fall shut and filed the moment away in his Mind Palace for later perusal.
He layered the strikes beside one another until Sherlock counted out the seventeenth stroke.
John watched the internal war occuring and smiled, it was good to see him fighting basic instincts. He took hold of Sherlock's cock and ran his hand up and down, using the quickly forming precum as lube.
Sherlock’s gaze flickered to Greg then to John and he was immediately concerned that Greg would punish him. “I’m sorry, sir,” he said sincerely to the older Dom, hoping it was enough to temper the punishment if only slightly.
“Better. Pay attention next time.”
“No. It’s ok at the moment. If he sleeps for much longer I will take you up on that rather than move him. It’s clear he’s exhausted.”
The detective let his gaze flicker around the room. It looked like a strip club given the size and the layout of the room. Although, it was empty now, all chairs and tables pushed well away from the centre stage. Sherlock realised where he was. It was the place round the back of town that was the main D/s establishment in central London. The racks of toys and play things weren’t here, but that didn’t mean they wouldn’t be by the time the evening rolled around. His thoughts halted rather abruptly – Douglas – bollocks.
The detective crouched down in front of him. “Finn, it will change nothing. You will be no more or less mine when that happens.”
“Pet, pet, Sherlock, hey,” he sat with the sub sideways on his lap. He felt guilty, Sherlock hadn't been in Panic for so long which was likely why it had hit him so suddenly.
Greg turned his head to the side, resting his cheek against John's thigh and bit his lip to keep quiet. He didn't want to upset John.
“Not tired anyway.” He climbed out of the car first and opened the flat door. He ran up the seventeen steps, ditched his coat over the kitchen table and knelt beside the armchair John had taken earlier.
“We don’t want tea, Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock yelled in after her. “We want beer. Lots of beer.”
There was another nod and another reprimand. “I will start your tally again, Sherlock.”
Irene smirked and Eurus actually laughed. "Pick on him? We aren't going to pick on him,” Eurus said.
“So?” Finn's bottom lip was out in a pout.
John managed to smile, even if the older man couldn’t see him. “I don’t think he’s gone. His coat is still here and I know him well enough by now that there is no way he’d leave without it, especially in the middle of winter.”
“Can I move, sir? I’m sorry. I’m sorry I ran again.”
An overly tall PC entered the cell and took Sherlock by the arm, his touch was far softer than Donovan's had been. “Yes, sir. This way, Mr. Holmes.”
"Yes, sir."
"Plea-" Sherlock's protest was cut short as John pushed the dildo between his teeth and deep into the back of his mouth, making him gag.
“So what d'you think?” The cabbie looked up at Sherlock, “Shall we?” Apparently just looking at the detective wasn't enough. He stood up so he was the same height. “Really, what do you think? Can you beat me? Are you clever enough to bet your life?”
It was a few minutes, but eventually Mycroft took over Finn duty and Sherlock came back up the beach.
"I can't help the brown spot. I was born with it," Sherlock quipped."
“Do you fancy some breakfast, Sherlock?” the Dom offered when the younger man looked away, ashamed. Ashamed of what, John didn’t know and he was cautious to demand anything of him this morning, especially something like food which he didn’t particularly enjoy, but he lived in hope.
"Get in the bath and get cleaned up, then we'll both put on clean clothes." Sherlock poured some bubble bath under the running water. "I promise you, everyone here had an accident like that at some point growing up."
With hesitant steps, Irene crossed the cell and stood in front of the youngest Holmes.
“I suppose you are used to him just taking off whenever he pleases?”
“Then at least sit back on your heels, pet.” He worded it like an order, but his tone was soft. He needed Sherlock to be more comfortable now, it was time to wind down and relax.
"Yes, sir."
Sherlock frowned at the weird over the top behaviour but didn't comment on it he just tucked into the chips as they were dumped on the table in front of him.
Greg smirked and settled on the floor, lifting Mycroft's head to his lap, shushing him softly.
The next one fell a quarter of an inch below the first.
Mycroft closed his eyes, needing to focus.
John remembered how much Sherlock loved it when he held his hand softly, it was a small, minor thing, but it was enough to help to make his sub feel more comfortable and for that reason he would ensure to do it whenever he could. Therefore when Sherlock took his hand to help him up, the Dom didn’t let go of it. He led him towards the stairs, still holding the leash. Experience told him to not let it go.
“Run.”
"I've told you many times tonight that you can if you want."
"Hmm."
"No reason at all." John removed his boy's gag, just to see if he would say anything. Sherlock didn't, he just kept making the little humming noises that had started when John had stopped smacking his arse. He tossed the gag onto a nearby table. "Boy, Sherlock, can you hear me?"
John knows one thing for sure. He does not like Donovan not Anderson
Mycroft woke on his knees, his hands cuffed behind him and the collar at his neck chained to the wall. Opposite him, the same had happened to his brother but Sherlock was still unconscious.

John smiled reassuringly, he didn’t want to scare the younger man off when he was finally talking. “I suppose. How were you punished for it before? I’m assuming there was a before.”
Despite the fact his boy seemed ok he wanted him off his knees and couldn’t wait to launch those cuffs as soon as possible… actually, he had a better use for them.
“That’s right, dear. Did I just hear you correctly?” she indicated the door John had left open.
John burst through the next random door, Greg on his heels.
As they approached the tape the irritance in the officer waiting there was clear. John was about to open his mouth, but she beat him to it.
"No, pet. I want a verbal response."
John already knew he'd found a case, but he couldn't resist calling out, "babe?"
Sherlock walked across the room, closely followed by Kate. As he dropped to his knees beside his Dom, Kate did the same beside hers.
Hesitantly Sherlock’s hands came over his head, but he watched them like John might cut them off.
John decided he didn’t like it. “I’m sure he does, but that’s not what I meant either.”
When Irene sauntered back over to Sherlock, she still had the taser in hand. "There are all sorts of places I could use this on your frankly gorgeous body." She reached out and grasped his cock. "Here, for instance, unless you cooperate."
John went over to the winch and lifted his sub into the air. When he came back over, he lifted a hand and sent him spinning. He left him spinning and put his hand in Mycroft's hair, tilting his head back sharply. "Did you enjoy that?" The doctor demanded. "A chance to be dominant?"
"I could hang you up by your arms. Make you look all pretty and uncomfortable."
"Mycie."
When they had both finished in the bathroom, the older sub set about making Sherlock comfy, with plenty of pillows up against the back of the bed and raising his leg up too.
He’d give him a bit longer to stew in his own juices. If he didn't start up again, he might go see him in person until then...
"Hmm. I hadn't thought of that, but I think you're right." John tied the rope that dangled from Sherlock's cock to the weight on the floor.
"Just making sure."
Without being asked, Mycroft assisted John in getting the cuffs on Sherlock. As soon as they had been closed around his wrists, the three men stepped back from him to see if he would calm down. The look on his face, clearly said otherwise.
“What’s it to you?”
The detective saw something in Irene's eyes that he didn't like. He realised he'd best get the dildo as wet as possible because she intended to use it on him.
"Ok." John shrugged and left the room, heading to the kitchen.
“Um we didn’t get any snorkelling gear, buddy,” John said, “Maybe next time.”
It appeared as if he was trying to put more weight onto his feet. John once again wasn’t bothered and used his cane to prod the back of his sub's knee and knock him to the floor. He hit the ground with a gentle thud and then yelled out something that John couldn’t quite catch, but whatever it was it was angry. The Dom needed to get on top of this. Fast. He gripped him by the back of the neck and pushed him face down. A hook appeared in the floor and John reached around, kneeling at his sub's back to clip it to the collar.
Dinner had happened wordlessly, both men stuck in their own thoughts. John was sure the only reason he hadn’t ran a mile when he had reminded him of the second half of his tally was because they had been so close to one another as he had said it.
“Yes, sir.”
John watched him carefully for a moment, then sighed going back to his own food.
“That makes this worse!” He tried to yank his wrists free but Greg stopped him.
"Yes, sir," he said with a huff.
John took his sub by the hand. “Greg we shall leave you to it. Just ring the bell if you need anything and a member of my staff will come straight here.”
Sherlock returned to the table with the bottles of sauces which he began to squirt all over the place.
John smiled. “If they start it, fine. But I don't want you starting any fights and I don’t want you going too far either. You’ve come a hell of a long way in a month, pet, don’t let me down.”
“If anything was likely to change my mood with you it would be you doing something to make my mood change. You do not get to predict what my attitude is going to be like in the future. I’m pretty sure your memory is substantial given your brother’s, so what was the last thing I said to you?”
"Do you recognise the sensation?"

In the lab, which John had led Sherlock to by the hand (surprising the detective even more) the door was locked behind them. The mechanism was of similar standard to the set on the front door and the alarm was set. There were windows for safety purposes in case Sherlock set anything on fire, a few lab stools in different areas, but even Sherlock's slim form couldn't get through small glass gaps.
“Yes. So?”
"Oh, that was a rhetorical question. Hurting your brother, really hurting him, will do the job nicely."
Sherlock was in his armchair, his knees tucked to his chest and his chin resting on top. The moment Mycroft entered the living room, the detective rolled his eyes. "Why are you still here?"
"We're going to play in a moment, but I want you completely calm before we start, is that understood?"
“He’s alright, Sherlock,” he nodded his assurances at the same time. “He’s fine. Been busy at work, very busy, in fact.”
“I doubt that Dom will ever see the light again, eh, Sherlock?”
“But I don’t.” Now he was stating the obvious, what was going on with his head?
“Now turn around, face the wall.” He obeyed. “Now jump on the spot. Stop. Turn around again.”
"Why?" John grumbled sitting up and stretching it.
“But-”
The doctor shook his head and held him close once again. “You have nothing to be sorry for.” He pressed a kiss to his temple, and let his curls brush the underside of his chin.
Mycroft snorted. "I won't have you deciding what was cruel. You don't understand the concept."
Greg squeezed his eyes shut, feeling overwhelmed for a moment. "You've been spending too much time with those two, sir. You're starting to become like them."
Sherlock tried turning around. "Please, sir. You don't have to do this."
“I told you to eat, Sherlock,” John said from the door, he was clearly unimpressed and tired of disobedience. The plate of food had been pushed aside to make room for the case notes he was trying his hardest to read.
"You've got 4," John pointed out.
"No. I haven't been for a few days. Your punishment is over."
John had warned him to behave, and the clamps attached to his nipples forced him to remain upright and not lift his head too high.
When the parachute was in place, Sherlock made himself say, "Thank you, mistress." He didn't want to risk Mycroft being put in his place.

The first blow came quick and hard across the widest part of his arse. Mycroft managed not to move, but only just. He didn't manage to keep back his yelp of surprise.
"I don't know what you want from me, Sherlock. The tantrums I can cope with but I don't know why you feel the need to carry on like this."
He tucked his head under John's chin, much like he had earlier in the day.
He tugged the younger man’s sleeve. “He’s there, sir,” he said with a nod and a point.
Eurus laughed from where she was still stood beside Mycroft.
The sub squinted at the two Doms for a moment. “Dear, God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.”
He sat and stared into his half empty coffee mug. Deep down he knew he shouldn't have left Sherlock, but he had seen no alternative. How could he look his sub in the eye when he had been the one to find the evidence that had damned him? The evidence that meant he wasn't his anymore. There had to be a way to fix that, fix the bloody law.
Sherlock shook his head as he tested the new bonds slightly. All he succeeded in doing, apart from proving he couldn’t free himself, was tug annoyingly at his cock.
“Stay, sir.” He said it. It didn’t mean it was necessarily going to happen. From the look on the blond’s face, the man didn’t believe it either, but he didn’t comment.
John let out a sigh. "Alright. I won't force you to sleep, but you will get into bed with me and I'll read to you."
But rather than take his seat again, Finn kept walking until he reached Siger. Without waiting for an invitation he climbed up on his lap. “Grandad.”
The following morning, Sherlock awoke with a groan. His chest ached and he realised with a heavy heart it wasn’t the first time he had awoken in this amount of pain. It was, however, the first time he awoken in such a substantial amount of pain but not alone. He snuggled back into the warmth of the Dom that surrounded him. For such a small man, John Watson had a large presence. He could almost imagine the bruises littering his chest and his wrist was throbbing. He didn’t want to open his eyes because doing that would mean seeing the mess he had managed to get himself into. He also didn’t want to face John. He was probably only still here because he felt guilty. There was no way he would still want him after this. He wondered how long it would be until he called Mycroft and demand he take him away. He tried to do a mental inventory of his condition and decided his wrist wasn’t as bad as his chest. His wrist didn’t make breathing hurt. He had laid there long enough. It was time to enter the real world. What he didn’t expect to see when he cracked his eyes open was John Watson hovering over him, concern swimming in his sea blue eyes.
Sherlock flinched. "I was angry with him for years. We've settled our differences. I would never say such things to him now."
Sherlock didn't bother fighting it, just ate.
Sherlock took a few steps then stopped. "I thought you didn't want to hurt us, Irene? I thought you said our sister was insane?"
“That's a relief.” Greg jostled Finn on his hip. “I didn't know what I would do if you said no.”
Sherlock snapped his mouth shut, breathing heavily. He tried to make it to his Mind Palace to picture the case, but he couldn’t get there. He couldn’t get his head out of the room. Not with the way John was sat there staring at him.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whimpered. He wanted nothing more than to curl up in a ball and ignore the man that had caused the waves of agony to run through his groin, but ignoring the older man, now, would have unforeseen consequences. His hands stayed interlocked behind his head and he kept his head low
"How do you think it sounds?" Sherlock snarked.
Eurus laughed at the chaos breaking out in the cell.
John shook his head. "No. He needs to realise I'm not going anywhere but he also needs to realise I'm not the only person in his life that means something."
"Up, pet," the Dom ordered, reaching down and tugging Sherlock's hand from behind his back and pulling him to his feet. He reached over and cupped his caged cock, giving it a shake. "No complaints that this little fella has stayed locked up?"
“But-”
The detective quickly got into his trousers and then pulled out the little suit Mycroft had got for Finn.
Greg hauled Mycroft to his feet and glared absolute daggers at him as he shoved him out of the room.
"Shut it," John hissed. "Not only did you blow up your mini lab, you defied me to do it. Mycroft would you fetch me something you know your brother would not like?"
Sherlock whimpered, biting his lip as there was suddenly rough jute rope being wrapped around his bollocks. John looped it several times, pulling his balls away from his groin. The sensation of his bollocks being toyed with was nothing compared to the throbbing of his dick in the cage that was trying valiantly to get hard.
John watched him for a moment before reaching for a chunk of fruit. Sherlock took it without complaint and chewed. He made sure to watch to make sure Sherlock didn't struggle but there didn't seem to be a problem.
He took a sip, just to make things go smoother with his sister. At least it was a decent wine. At the sound of his little brother's grunt from behind he could tell he was still face down into the floor.
Finn tugged on his sleeve on the way to the car park.
“Missing? You have that case Mycroft was working on? I don’t see how I can help.”
After checking the window – thoroughly – he was pleased to see that the older man had missed something, or at least misinformed Mycroft and his minions about something. One up!
"Hey!" Greg exclaimed.
Sherlock melted at the little boy’s hopeful expression and he met John’s gaze. “We’ve got to take him, John.”
He dragged him away from the front of the building, there was still a lot of officers going in and out as well as Anderson’s team. John didn’t want to show the detective up in front of people that clearly didn’t know the first thing about him or how to understand him.
Biting his lip, Sherlock looked at his Dom hopefully. Maybe, if he had behaved well enough, John would make use of him later. Then he would know he hadn't messed up too much that day.
“Explain it to me, Sherlock.” He used his name deliberately, it would hopefully help the boy to understand that he wasn’t in trouble but could potentially be if he continued to be obstructive.
“What are you talking about?”
“What's that supposed to mean?” He frowned in confusion, trying to work out what she was going on about.
"Hello dear," Eurus said, pacing the room and pecking Irene on the cheek. The Dominatrix made herself stay still for it. A fact Sherlock didn't miss. Only Eurus could mistake such a reaction for affection.
Suddenly the barrel of the rifle was at the back of his head and he froze.
“I can't,” the government official inclined his head, feeling genuinely sorry for the situation. “I'm sorry, little brother.”
“No, with Mr. Wilkes.”
Greg just squeezed him tighter, it wasn’t the first time he had brought it up and he wasn’t wrong. But none of them could explain it, it was just a part of him that maybe, if they worked at it, would become a distant memory.
“The little terror hasn't even finished his breakfast," John exclaimed.
If Eurus had been paying attention to her 'girlfriend' she would have noticed the disgusted look on her face. Instead Eurus was watching Mycroft, who was hanging heavily in the chains.
“Going to cooperate now?”
“Good. If I don’t want a response I will tell you.”
John cleared his throat pointedly. “I think you should stop just there, pet.”
John pulled a small black box from his pocket which looked like a TV controller. With a flick of the switch, the box undid the force holding Sherlock’s feet to the floor. The Dom reached out, grasped Sherlock by the scruff of the neck and pulled him inside, kicking the door firmly shut behind him.
“Good boy.”
With that, John nodded once and set about checking over his ankle. When he was satisfied it was ok he stepped back to let Mycroft pick his little brother up.
John's hand was at the back of his neck, the pad of his thumb rubbing softly. He hadn't felt a touch like that in days. It was a relief. He hadn't realised a few weeks ago how punishment could be not physical and still be successful in curving his behaviour back towards the outlined agreement in the contract.
The Dom laughed. "I rather thought you'd say that."
John flicked the vibrator up a few more notches and grinned.
"Thought you were just watching?"
Irene's eyes went wide. She'd had no idea that Eurus actually meant it. After dithering a moment, she tried to pull the crazed woman off of Mycroft. "Help me!" she shouted at the guards.
"Only because the car is moving." John released him, giving him a little shove into the front seat.
“Bollocks,” Mycroft hissed.
Sherlock couldn't suppress the whine that built up in his throat. The pressure and the burning inside him had built to an incredible level.
"Trouble," Mrs Hudson said, stepping forward. "That's all Frank ever was, except in bed. He was a wonder there."
Sherlock resisted the urge to say 'why ask then?' He ducked his head instead
Eurus smirked and ran her hand down her brother's chest. "Good boy, Mycie." She fetched her glass of wine and held it to his lips.
Sherlock's head snapped up to look at her.
“But you’ve not eaten.”
The latch slid open with a grind. “What?” grumped the Sergeant on the other side, Sherlock smirked, realising how right he was.
"Fine. I don't need to gag you," John agreed. He forced the gag between Sherlock's lips. "But I want to." He buckled the gag in place. "I can't wait until we get where we're going. I have plans for you, pet."
He had bent him over the back and begun forcing his hole open immediately. The first finger had taken one minute, two fingers had taken five and he hadn't even bothered with three fingers just forced him to hover over the usual dildo poking upright from the chair.
"Sherlock is always the problem."
He saw her touching Mycroft as the threat it was and did what he was told.
“Nice try, pet. I expected it to be a large tally to start with. Mycroft told me all about you, remember?” He pulled out his phone and showed Sherlock the number it had gone up to. The detective’s eyes widened, not realising it had gone up quite as high as it had. His shoulders slouched in defeat. “Can I have half now, sir?” Seeing the number made him realise he didn’t really have a choice at all, the full lot… it didn’t bear thinking about.
“Enough, pet,” John interrupted, tightening his grip at his nape slightly in warning.
They ran in immediately.
"Strip," John hissed. He hadn’t ordered it earlier, knowing someone (he had assumed Mycroft’s men) was going to drop off his bag.
The government official turned around in his seat and looked at his brother. "I thought we were going on holiday because I was having trouble behaving. Now you're starting up?" Mycroft watched him carefully for his response.
Sherlock doubted he would ever come again, but whispered a quiet. “No, sir.”
John folded his arms across his chest and Sherlock sighed, the suitcase dropped to the floor.
"I could imagine if you weren't cuffed right now you would be reaching for that, am I right?"
"Great idea," John agreed. The doctor reached down and plucked out two beers.
John went over what he had said in his head and realised he hadn't specifically told Sherlock to get in and relax, merely implied it. "Babe, you could have waited for us in the Jacuzzi." He offered his boy a hand and helped him to his feet.
John laughed. "You mean you didn't deduce that would happen?" He laughed at Sherlock's reflexive glare, then he kissed him.
John moved around quietly and instructed the younger man onto the bed in his room. So far, he hadn’t obeyed.
“John-”
Greg shrugged. "I don't care, it's not me that's uncomfortable. I'd get Mycroft in here to watch if he wasn't asleep like a good boy."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said immediately, noting the look on Irene's face. "I'm sorry, miss," he added. Had he been ignoring John long? By the look on the Dominatrix's face he'd been ignoring John hours, shame they'd only been there less than one. Why did Irene seem to hate him so much?
The sub glared at the wall in front of him. The whole situation was hateful. Why should he stay in the corner if John was just going back to sleep? He waited ten minutes, then he got up and went in search of something not boring to do, but by that point John had already fallen back asleep again, one foot dangling out of the bed and his head on Mycroft's chest.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock responded quietly. He just wanted this over with. The quicker it was, the quicker tomorrow would come and he would get his violin back.
"I want Sherlock as my sub. Not this fake version." John brought his hands up to the back of his neck. "How do I get that through to him? He's the most stubborn person I've ever met. Once he gets an idea in that brain of his, he won't let it go."
Or sat watching in a cool comfy office.
“Of course being Dominant gives you power! You wouldn’t dare to back chat him,” he nodded at Greg whose nostrils were flaring angrily.
Sherlock stayed completely still, he didn't want to piss John off even more when the day had only just got started.
"It seemed appropriate, sir."
“But, sir, you have finished with-”
Sherlock folded his arms.
The cabbie stopped before climbing into his vehicle. He thought for a moment before speaking.
Mycroft hung his head. He should have done better and deduced what his Dom had wanted him to say.
John made sure to feed him another mouthful before the boy realised what his plan was with distracting him.
Sherlock looked for something to throw at the doctor. The Union Jack pillow was close by, so he launched it at John.
“Finn took off.”
"Why do I get a warning, but my brother gets snogged? It's not fair!" The detective kicked his feet against the floor.
The government official grinned at his Dom and took off after Sherlock.
"Yes, sir," Mycroft shifted around to face John's feet, but it meant facing Sherlock.
But the sub still froze.
Eurus glared at Mycroft. "What did you do?!"
“But… you don’t like it?”
“Get off,” Sherlock complained.
John turned to gape at his friend, suddenly suspicious of where the conversation was going. “Greg, you can't seriously-”
The blond Dom glanced across the table. The goings on had obviously put the other pair off their food and they were sat there quietly.
Mycroft's eyes flicked up to meet his Dom's. They were full of confused arousal, his pupils blown wide and his erection hadn't offered to flag. "Yes, sir," he replied in a voice gone rough.
Mycroft sighed then he swore. "I don't know why I'm surprised."
The older Holmes handed Finn to John rather than Sherlock and gave Mycroft a small shove to the door.
"No, boy," Greg ordered. "Why don't you get a bowl of rice?" He laughed.
The detective paled even more and simply stared at the man.
"Don't even go there," his voice was low and stern.
"Anything explosive?"
As the staff dropped off the third set of tea, John leant forward to make it how they both liked it. When he settled back again, he realised something that should have been incredibly obvious before.
The DI ran a hand through Mycroft's hair; softer this time. “Go straight to your office, attend that meeting you wanted to go to this afternoon. We'll deal with your brother.”
“No. Subs have just as many human rights as Doms do. Just because this guy was a dick, it doesn’t mean you’re below anyone. And aftercare comes after all manner of scenes and sessions not just punishment.”
“…sir?”
"Well, that answers that question," Greg said, shaking his head. "He's just as bad as ever."
Deciding that his Dom was being rather petty, he rolled over and covered his head with his pillow. As if that would actually achieve anything except making the Dom mad.
“Please, sir. How long am I going to be like this?”
“Yes, sir,” he whispered, but his voice was muffled by the bed as he pressed his face into it, thinking it would help.
“You have enough length in the leash to reach the buzzer for my room. Use it and I will be here within a few minutes. Whatever the reason “
Sherlock had been good the past few days and their second week together was nearly over. Physically, Sherlock was a lot better. His wrist had healed of the slight sprain and the bruises were practically gone. His brat had spent the majority of the day persuading John to play with him. He’d finally caved in and Sherlock was now knelt by the door to the playroom. One of John’s little rituals, the kneeling outside part, he said it helped him to get into the right headspace. Sherlock disagreed. It was just boring.
“What?” He stammered thinking it was police. Thinking they had suddenly become non imbecilic to know where to find him.
"Slow down, you git!" the Dom said, laughing. As soon as they had got into the shower with the water running, John pushed his boy to his knees.
The pair were interrupted by a knock at the door.
John grinned sideways. “Hello, beautiful, good sleep?”
"And when I want to relax?" John asked.
"We're… friends?"
"You were lucky how little time we spent up there in the early days... Well for play, I punished you most of the time. Behaving is more important than the games. Even so, move."
John held the cup to his boy's lips again and the detective drank. He needed the caffeine jolt, especially since his Dom had forbidden him using nicotine patches.
Before the sub's scowl could fully form John snogged him and he went completely pliant once again.
Mycroft glanced down at it and whimpered. He eyed the Superintendent carefully as he threw the key up in the air numerous times.
John laughed as he put on the kettle. "You'd be amazed what your Dad and your Uncle can say without speaking a word."
“No. Finn is a Holmes. That will never change.”
The Dom had made sure Sherlock’s stool was in reach of him as he sat back and pulled the lunch box from the backpack.
He was rather surprised when the boy didn’t pull away and actually ate everything he was given.
“Bloody hell, John, calm down
John laughed, the tension flowing out of him. He hadn't realised that he had gotten so wound up with his own boy. That was a bit not good. Play was supposed to be just that, play.
“What's going to happen about Donovan?” He watched the older man closely for a response. He didn't get the defensive/protective senior officer response he was expecting.
“Floor,” he growled dangerously, pointing at the spot beside the chair.
"I... It wasn't a tantrum!" Sherlock snapped trying to fight his position but the cuffs and his cock tied to the floor made him rethink.
"Sh, pet," Greg said softly. "It's time for bed. We're just getting you ready." He smoothed down Mycroft's thinning hair as John made swift work of untying the rope harness while Greg removed the gag.
“You’d punish me, sir,” he whispered quietly.
When Sherlock began to shift on his knees, slightly, but enough to know that he wasn’t thinking about the events of the morning anymore, John knew he would have to distract the younger man. He glanced at the detective, then at his watch. No wonder he was hungry, it had gone 2 o’clock. He wondered if Sherlock was hungry, but he doubted he would get a constructive answer if he asked the question. He may have been restless, but he was still under. The bleary eyes and the drowsy movements were proof of that.
John pulled his hand from his pocket and recognised the number, he knew he would have to step from the room to answer it.
“…sir?”

“There’s, Apple, orange, or coke.”
When Greg reappeared with the cock cage John crouched down and began running the pinwheel over his cock. Sherlock tried to fight it immediately, but given the way he was restrained he didn't get far. John ran it along his length several times, top, bottom and sides, then he ran it repeatedly over the head. Jaws clenched and muscles taught, Sherlock tried to ignore it, but his cock jumped at every touch of the pinwheel.
"Thank you. And yes… Sherlock didn’t believe me." John took a step back. He looked at his fiancé and beamed at him. They really were going to do this.
Sherlock turned on his brother again. "Why did you let them do that?"
He closed the door and locked it. When he turned around, it was to find Sherlock lost somewhere in thought. He jerked as the Dom spoke, but made no other move to run or hide. Sherlock’s head was now low, and he was no longer full of that raw anger and rebellion - for now.
Sherlock ducked his head, looking at the contents of the mug. This wasn't right. Kate didn't have coffee. "I'm fine, thank you, sir," he said putting the mug back on the table and returning his hands to behind his back.
"Impatient or adorable?"
Sherlock looked the blond up and down once, twice, three times. “You’re very hard, sir,” he pointed out, biting his lip again.
“Yes, sir. You told me to be still, sir, and I moved.”
The detective screwed his face up in confusion as his brother's Dom entered the cell, where was his brother? “What this time?” He grumbled. “More fake evidence?”
“Taxi for Sherlock Holmes,” the grey-haired man repeated.
"Don't blame me," John groused. "It's your consulting detective causing all the trouble." He buried his head under a pillow.
“Before we move on and I punish you like you deserve, we need to get on the same page, which means you have to get on top of your anger because it will not help the situation.”
"That's a good idea of yours," John said with a laugh.
The sub did his best to accommodate the Dom's thrusting without gagging. Sherlock laughed when he felt John give up, his legs strained and the older man sank down onto the chair until his arse was flush with the base.
"John..." Mycroft's gaze drifted to the doctor, "would you consider having him microchipped? It would ease my mind considerably."
He sighed heavily. He couldn’t think! This flat was boring now! Boring without John and John was out doing whatever it was John did when he wasn’t with him.
John gave him a little shake. "My jumper better not be ruined. If it is, you're buying me three new ones. To my taste, mind you."
Sherlock rolled off the doctor’s chest to face the other direction.
John opened the sub’s bedroom door and followed him in. He still hadn’t let go of his hand.
The detective's head fell back against the cross with a loud thud. He closed his eyes and thought of what he would like to do to Irene, nothing of which she would enjoy.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
The blond was far too angry to do anything right now, and what he would usually do in this situation was obsolete because he’d done it a month ago. This time Sherlock had wanted out, and gone through a bloody big deal to do so. Firm but fair had always been his policy, but maybe right now Sherlock needed a much harder hand. He sighed, he couldn’t remember the last time he had had to be hard with a sub... 10 years at least and even then it was a military sub that couldn’t settle into civilian life. He’d been there...

John stared at the back of the kneeling sub’s head. They’d got him into his house from the car and only removed the belt. The Dom didn’t feel like making it easier on the boy. He was left cuffed hand and foot, the chain to his collar the only thing keeping him upright on his knees. The dildo gag he wore had the appearance of a muzzle on the outside and in the spirit of it, successfully muted most of his noise.
John laughed. "Fair enough."
Sherlock focused his attention back onto his Dom’s cock. He didn’t want him putting the tally up anymore, not with that new paddle he had been introduced to a few days before.
John jerked in surprise, he'd been waiting for Sherlock to blurt that out, knowing he loved it, but instead it had been Mycroft. Greg agreed immediately and still the detective hadn't said a word about it. "What about you, Sherlock? Would you like some ice cream as well?"
The detective had no idea why he thought they would head to the den next, he'd done nothing in the last 72 hours to even suggest time in the den was appropriate or something he had earned. He had been on his knees over an hour while John reorganised the whole attic. It was like the doctor was deliberately finding things to move. He soon realised they were heading to the Dom's office. At that, he sighed. How boring.
John hugged him to his side, hating the lost look in the little boy's eyes. "Are you all done, then?"
Sherlock rested his head on Mycroft's chest. "And you weren't, I suppose?"
“I know,” Sherlock sat on the bed beside him and pulled the tie from his pocket. “I hate them too. But brother dear says we have to.”
Mycroft crawled in and climbed on the bed beside him. "Don't be a brat, little brother."
Sherlock watched his brother out of the corner of his eye. He seemed happy and relaxed beside the Superintendent. That was good, he smiled softly.
The little boy laughed but nodded. That was exactly what Sherlock was likely to do. In fact, Mycroft made a point to stand by the bathroom window.
“You’re the cabbie. The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street. The one me and- the one I chased.”
"Yeah, I was wondering about that. Where did those things go?"
John reached over and touched the cuffs together. The detective wasn't surprised and he didn't complain, this was the way things were at the moment. The Dom just didn't trust him as much as he had a week ago. He'd explained that it would take a while, but hoped they'd get there once again. He couldn't really blame him, the sub had been stupid and naive.
The boy jerked, he had clearly been deep in thought, for a change. “Yes, sir. Nothing but…” He admitted.
John disappeared into the room they had spent so much time in the day before. He returned shortly with the machine.
Sherlock gave John a forlorn look. "Perhaps we should elope."
“Thank you, sir,” Sherlock whispered after a moment.

John held his hand up before Greg could continue his reprimand, it seemed the older Dom was about to spank Mycroft, without a care for where they were. Ordinarily he wouldn't be bothered, but it was obvious Mycroft had something important to say. Glancing at Sherlock, he pointed at the door. "Outside," he suggested.
He shook his head. “I deserve to be on the floor, sir,” Sherlock admitted quietly.
"Sir! I said I'm sorry."
The doctor noticed when his pet's eyelids fell to half mast. "I think we'd best get out while you can still move, pet." He kissed Sherlock on the temple, then urged him to sit up. He glanced at Sherlock's beer and realised he'd barely touched it.
“You’ll be alright for a sec?” at his nod, he continued, “dial Greg for me, tell him it’s an emergency and to get here straight away, alright?”
Mycroft looked towards his Dom for permission to speak.
“Coming from you!” The doctor laughed so hard that Greg had to take the tray of ice creams. “Good job we’re at the beach with no walls to climb.”
Sherlock ran back up the bottom few steps. “Pink!” he yelled.
“Boy!”
Mycroft swallowed hard and at the hand on his shoulder kneeled beside his own Dom. “They have been dealt with, Sherlock.”
“No. No, of course I believe he's innocent. He's just a kid.” He might have been a bugger and one hell of a boy to try and control, but he was no murderer.
“We’ll catch up later.” They agreed.
Siger looked down at Finn and hugged him. "I would change it if I could." He clearly felt guilty about how things had gone.
"Some more toys to play with pet," he held a set of nipple clamps, a set Sherlock hadn't seen before.
"It's amazing how a little boy can make a beach fun."
"Didn't what? Tell you? Disappear with him?"
"Sir-"
He didn't know how long he knelt there, all he knew was when John noticed him he jerked in surprise.
He loosened Mycroft’s tie and managed to undo the top two buttons of his shirt, but Mycroft’s composure was strained and he barely noticed.
Apparently deciding it wasn’t worth the risk he opened his mouth. “Good boy.”
"Now," she added.
Sherlock bit his lip, but nodded.
Mycroft flinched at the first impact of the crop across his thighs, then he braced himself. He had been through all this before. It was nothing new. It was just boring!
“Of course. I will always do it when you’ve been punished. No matter how good or bad you were during the punishment. Although I will point out, being bad when you are already being punished would be a very reckless thing to do.” John looked at him in a way that suggested he knew just how reckless the younger man could be.
"Well, figure it out from inside," John growled. He grabbed Sherlock by the scruff of the neck and pulled him towards the door.
“I know. In the future I’m going to give you the choice of a cock ring to help you out, okay?”
"That didn't take long," Mycroft whispered when John was snoring softly.
"Actually, I rather like that idea," Eurus said, intrigued. "Can we really do that, love?"
The doctor wasn’t surprised when the boy knelt beside him rather than sit down. Panic was just a spinoff of subspace after all.
Sherlock moaned, but fell still, hating the feeling even more when he couldn't jump away from it.
John watched him for a moment. He had a bead of sweat running down his back and his curls were soaked. His arms were trembling and his legs looked like they were about to give out. He really had left it to the last minute.
Sherlock closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the seat. He couldn't just shut the feelings he had off, even if he wanted to deny to himself and everyone else that he had them.
“Of course,” the older sub agreed with a tilt of his head.
“You know why,” Mycroft repeated, turning to sit back on the sofa.
“I've already deduced the menu, sir,” he said, tilting his head on one side. “I knew you would like the carbonara.”
“Pet…”
"Sherlock."
John shook his head slowly as the other two join them.
"Don't complain about fair or I'll get a pen and play connect the dots with your freckles just for the hell of it."
"We could always just leave you like that, boy. Or maybe Greg can fuck your brother in front of you."
He scooped Finn up and threw him on the bed. At the little boy's giggle, he managed a weak smile.
"I can tell it's not a person. It's a ghost. I would think that would be obvious." He pointed towards the shape. "What else could it possibly be?"
"And I've not left the flat," Sherlock pointed out.
Eurus walked over to Mycroft and placed a hand on his reddened skin, feeling the heat radiating off of it. "Wonderful. You do wonderful work, my love."
When he saw John he fell off it and scrambled under the bed.
"In that case, I shall collect Gregory. But, Sherlock, this had best not be a waste of our time. If you have put Finn up to something-"
"Yes, sir."
The detective’s eyes were wide but Finn didn’t see it as he had his head under Sherlock’s chin.
"No. It's Frank! Who else would want to interrupt my supper like this?"
“What is it, pet?” he asked, sensing his sub’s apprehension.
“I-I-I c-came without permission, sir. But I'm t-trying to ask for-”
Sherlock kept his head bowed as John dealt with the bowl and the soap. He didn’t realise the Dom was done until his curls were grabbed once again and he was dragged to his feet, forced over the sink.
“Look who I found. Actually, I suppose he found me. Well?” Ben snapped, kicking Sherlock in the back of the leg with the toe of his boot. “Remember your god damn manners. You kneel in the presence of more important people. I've tried hard enough in the past to get you to do so.” Sherlock thought it best not to mention the fact that the sod had been holding him up. “But you're nothing but a robot, and even you are shit at that.”
The sub tried to pull free, but it was completely futile, John's grip was too firm. "Get off me!"
"But why not stop it completely?"
The doctor made his way to the kitchen and stuck the kettle on, he settled into his chair with a cup of coffee and flicked through the cameras on his internal CCTV until he found the one in his bedroom. He hadn’t originally intended to have cameras in his room, but they were fitted in all the rooms as standard and he had never got around to having them removed. He wasn’t happy with leaving him alone, but Mycroft had said a long time ago that the best way to punish him, as with any sub, just more so with Sherlock, was to keep it directly linked to his supposed ‘crime’. He had also mentioned how much Sherlock despised being alone when he got close to someone, it was the perfect punishment, even if neither of them liked it.
"No."
"Say you don't know and I'll cage your cock too."
Greg stood and stretched, working what stiffness he felt out that way, then he gave Mycroft a hand up. "Might I interest you in a shower, pet? Together?"
They had been 20 minutes from home, when the car had picked them up. The detective wasn't even sure if it was Mycroft's car or John's. To be honest, he didn't really care. Sherlock was asleep instantly, curled up on his side, his knees tucked to his chest and his head in John's lap.
"You'd think they'd learn."
The second time John tugged the leash, Sherlock managed to prevent himself from opening his mouth, but the glare he couldn’t stop. It was incredibly irritating when he was busy to be stopped just to look at his Dom who was laid back watching him like he was at the cinema. John had explained to him last time that this was probably the easiest part of submission and if Sherlock hadn’t previously screwed up his chances with his violin, he would have been in a better mood; a more cooperative one. Then again, if he hadn’t screwed up his chances with his violin, John would be off doing whatever it was John did when he wasn’t with him.
Mycroft acknowledged the Dom's statement with a sigh that came out as a puff around the gag. He hadn't set out to make Greg angry, but it seemed he was quite skilled at it.
Greg had predicted exactly that response. It was what Sherlock always did when faced with something he didn't like. Run away. Sometimes it was good. Today wasn't one of those times.
Mycroft couldn't help his snicker.
“At that point I didn’t think you’d want to hear it, sir,” Sherlock admitted sheepishly. He wasn’t lying, he had thought John couldn’t handle him and the drama anymore and wanted him gone.
He thrusted a finger in the direction of the luggage on the floor.
"I've already told you to shut up once. Why are you making me repeat myself?" Greg demanded.
Irene glanced at Eurus, but she had gone.
The entire group exited mini bus like a bundle of performers. Their large group drew the eyes of the passersby. As a result, Finn insisted on being picked up so he could hide his face against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Are you sure? Only these past few days, although they haven’t been easy, they have been getting better, why did you suddenly run this morning?”
"Not enough going on. Too calm. No mystery."
"Nope." Sherlock went past the occupants of 221A and started climbing the stairs. He didn't point out that he wouldn't need to if the things kept appearing in the building.
The detective's nod was only slight, but it was a nod all the same.
John snapped a leash to the sub’s collar and dragged him towards the door.
The Dom raised an eyebrow rather astonished at such a suggestion so close to punishment. “A favour?”
Grabbing the leash off the hook, he made the necessary attachments to the wall and then clipped it onto his collar.
John was also proud that he hadn’t been ignored by the detective, even though he hadn’t really presented much of an opportunity to be ignored by not asking him many questions.
“Doesn’t look like much has changed, does it?”
John pulled the leash taught and tied it to the top of the banister.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock frowned in confusion. He held the suitcase rather awkwardly now he was with someone he knew.
The detective hunched over and let out a muffled cry. The Superintendent had caught him completely off guard.
"Why would she be mad? And why does it matter?"
“Do you fancy going for a walk, pet?” John asked. The detective had been curled up on the floor for hours and had barely moved, one hand was wrapped loosely around his foot. He smiled down at him, but needed to get up. He was stiff from lack of movement, so Sherlock probably was too.
He opened his mouth but John punched him again, splitting his lip and encouraging a gush of blood to run from his nose.
The stool was about hip height and wide. It had three legs, and the top was padded by black leather, that ran down the legs about half way.
“You stay there and drink the rest of your tea, I’ll go and get the case notes, ok?” The Dom could read his boy like a book.
"Too late."
The paddle rained down again and again, Sherlock didn’t make the mistake of not counting again.
Once Mycroft was clothes free, Greg pointed to the corner, "Go and kneel over there."
“It’s alright, sir,” the detective insisted.
"I've warned you to quit complaining, boy!"
Sherlock leant over and whispered in John's ear.
“You can’t take my violin! It’s mine!”
“Good, pet.” He wasn’t about to make him repeat it more understandably, it was enough he got the right answer for now. He released the cuffs and Sherlock fell back onto his knees, immediately wincing as his reddened backside came into contact with his heels.
The detective didn't move and he still didn't look up at the Dom.
Mycroft regretted his stupidity all the time after falling for Moriarty's games and putting his brother in such terrible positions.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, feeling rather put upon. “Oh, please.”

He heard Mrs. Hudson's heels on the wooden floorboards and crept down the first flight of stairs, making sure to pick his feet up so they wouldn't be heard.
“Ok.”
"You've really pissed him off, boy," John couldn't help but point out.
If John was going to be out of the way for an hour, it would give him plenty of time to put his plan into action. He went to his room and found some clothes before heading up to the attic. He wasn’t 100% sure, but he thought he had seen a window in the attic, even if it was the playroom. He was breaking John’s rules by attempting to get out as it was, going in the playroom despite John’s specific instructions was the least of his worries.
Sherlock listened to the Dom get ready and heard the squeak of the bed as he climbed into it.
John checked on Sherlock one last time through the sedan window then patted the wheel arch and the car drove away. He couldn’t believe the timing of it.
It didn’t take him long to uncover the ‘window’ and he was right, it was an old fashioned angled window that swung back out of the way leaving him more than enough room.
Mycroft grabbed him by the scruff of the neck as he ran passed.
“You're not in trouble any more, Sherlock. You know that, right?” He felt the need to point that out, despite it being a few days.
“So?”
“What?”
Sherlock knelt on his usual cushion when John ordered him to. The staff brought in their meal and placed it on the table, retreating quietly. Sherlock just stared at the floor, he'd made the whole situation worse, he had been getting off rather lightly.
The detective sighed. "I don't mean to.... not really." When his brother didn't say anything further, he continued, "I just want John's attention. All of it."
At that tone of voice, the government official couldn't ignore it. He crossed the room, dropped his umbrella and collapsed to his knees.
“I don’t believe you. Your attitude is appalling.”
John paused behind him and gripped his caged cock. He put his fingers between the bars, prodding the hardening length, then he turned his attention to his bollocks.
John realised right then that anything related to sex right at that moment was unwarranted. The only thing that had gotten a reaction out of this motionless Sherlock was this. It was rather sweet. He didn't want to risk disturbing his sub, even by lifting him onto his lap.
Between the happy look on Finn's face and the lopsided smile on John's there was nothing the detective could do but agree. "Very well. We're engaged." He kissed John, then stepped back grinning, surprised at how happy the prospect made him.
"It's a nice little Italian restaurant," John explained. "The owner thinks the world of Sherlock."
"You are by very definition, a brat!"
Yet again, Sherlock replied, "Yes, sir."
“I don’t think so.”
Mycroft closed his eyes in realisation, that was what was wrong with his brother. He wanted it strict and rough again.
"She's always let us go before."
The most wonderfully wicked idea came into her mind and it was so simple. Irene leant forward and went up on her toes. "Perhaps this will get a response." She moved closer with the intent to kiss him.
“I’m sorry, sir. I don’t know what number I’m on.”
“She was writing ‘Rachel’?”
“I'm not hungry.” He didn't look up as he spoke, but he heard the intake of breath.
John couldn't believe a punishment for the brat was now based on something they had covered so many times before. They'd had this very conversation mere hours ago.
Beside him, the older man was rolling his eyes. Mr. Holmes had warned him his brother was... no other word for him than a brat.
"Where are we going, sir?"
"Shh," John whispered. "It’s fine."
Greg was stood at the door to the room Mycroft was in.
Just as the DI finished speaking an officer opened the door the other side from Sherlock and climbed in. As if Sherlock would be dumb enough to bolt with his hands cuffed, he had learnt that the hard way with John, but now there were far more people around that would stop him at a moments notice.
Sherlock shivered at the though. It wasn’t a sliver of pleasure that ran up his spine, but one of fear and apprehension. He managed to chase the expression across his face and hide it behind his usual mask of impassiveness, but just because it was hidden didn’t mean it wasn’t there and just because it was hidden now didn’t mean John hadn’t already seen it.
Mycroft stood for a moment in thought and then climbed the stairs after the pair.
“W-why, sir?”
. 139.11MB
Sherlock smirked this time, he should have known John wouldn’t be mad at him for the weird race across half of London. He glanced over at the copper talking to the Californian man. “I’m sorry, sir. But…” he inclined his head. They were being pointed at now.
“Didn’t feel right?”
That made John climb up the bed and sit on Mycroft's chest. He pulled his pants down and pressed his cock to Mycroft's mouth. "That should keep you quiet."
He almost ran headlong into a room where the soldiers had entered but managed to come to a halt. He pressed himself against the wall and peered carefully through the glass in the door.
“Well, boy, which one?”
A van slipped up beside the alley as the man cuffed his wrists behind him. The van was subtle and did nothing to draw attention. The van looked familiar, once again, assuming it was the police or Mycroft behind it would have got him in more trouble. But the Irishman... it had nothing to do with Mycroft.
Siger and Mrs. Hudson sat just at the edge of the water in beach chairs, the water rushing over their toes in shallow waves. They laughed at some private joke as Finn approached with his ice cream, Greg close on his heels.

John set his own boy beside Greg's and nodded. "Sure."
At the boy's worried look, John interjected, "It's nothing bad. Promise."
“Go on, then.”
He sighed as he turned on his toe, his shoe squeaking on the floorboards. “You’re not actually going to punish me, now, are you?”
Sherlock was thrown to the floor inside the room. He was shortly followed by Mycroft.
After nearly 30 seconds Sherlock appeared, looking dishevelled but not out of breath.
His sister looked at him in concern immediately. "What is it?"
Sherlock laughed. "Admit it, seeing Eurus go for Irene's throat was priceless. Her attention isn't just on us and it's not on anyone innocent or who we care about."
“But he will want her there,” Sherlock pointed at Greg.
“Very well. I have no idea where that is but that’s fine. Now bring that case to me properly and talk me through what you did to get it and why it was so important that you left me stranded miles away.”
“This isn’t funny, brother-mine,” Mycroft spat.
Sherlock had his eyes shut where he knelt, John nudged him with his knee, trying to get his attention. He didn't expect the response that he got.
“It doesn’t matter, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Sherlock, what have I told you about leaving the windows open when it’s raining? Especially with it so heavy out there. The amount of curtains I’ve gone through since you’ve lived here.”
The grumpy old man rang off without so much as a good bye. The DI found himself somewhat glad, it wasn't all relying on him now.
“But-”
“Something Finn wants to tell us?” Mycroft sounded confused. “What on Earth are you going on about?”
Slowly, the sub shook his head no.
The Dominatrix tilted her head and raised an eyebrow. "What's the naughty person room?"
Sherlock managed a smile around the dildo in his mouth. Anything he could do to piss Irene off was good by him.
They searched everywhere for over 4 hours before it got dark and they found nothing. They didn’t even find a trace of the direction Sherlock went in.
John pushed him into the apartment.
"She should have pled guilty from the beginning," Mycroft said darkly. "But she's only ever thought of herself.
“Are you getting shitty with me?”
Greg sat back down and beckoned his boy over. "I think John has your brother well in hand. Get over here and finish what you started."
Trying to distract himself, Sherlock watched Kate, slightly unsure how to react at another sub he didn't know, let alone a female one. The only other sub he had knelt across from was Mycroft and his brother hardly made their shared company practice for these sorts of situations.
The detective pouted and walked up the beach. "Yes, sir?"
"Is your little tantrum done?"
“Yes, sir.”
“May I have a cushion please, sir?”
He nodded. “Sherlock’s going to need his brother, but not like this.” The DI glanced at the younger man who had gathered his knees to his chest and was rocking silently.
"I haven't decided if the things she repeats are done so because she enjoys them or because she's struggling to understand something," Mycroft admitted. "Her mind is a puzzle not to be fathomed."
Pressing his lips to his sub's, John silenced him with a kiss. "It's fine," he said when they broke apart. "We're taking it easy today, getting back into things, but finding the joy in it again."
John looked at him in confusion then realised he was still holding the paddle and although the boy's head was low, he was watching him like he would begin the rest of the hits the doctor had originally intended on.
The pair of them were so engrossed in their argument they ignored the yell from Greg.
John looked back. "Oh, let them have their time together. We don't give them enough. As long, that is, as they keep coming this way."
Oh, his Dom was wicked. Mycroft looked around the room trying to deduce what would satisfy Gregory's demand. "I could suck you, sir?" he offered.
“I was?”
"The same?"
“What’s an oy… oys…”
“Sit there, on the top step,” John's voice was dangerously low. “And if you even think about answering back, think it through.”
John sighed, he reached across and cupped Sherlock's cheek. “I know you did. I'm not mad at you for that.”
The government official nodded his head a few times, relishing in John's light touches. The doctor paused at Mycroft's hole, poking his finger inside. The sub squirmed as much as the rope would allow, wanting to push back on the finger, but not having any leverage.
"It's not our normal cell. This one's much smaller." Mycroft moved towards the sound of his brother's voice and sat by him.
Blinking back away from the light, Sherlock steadied his eyes to the brightness around him, 2 large white lights pointing down at him. When he could finally focus, he could see the camera aimed at his kneeling figure.
"Play with them," Eurus ordered when her glass was empty.
Sherlock did. He counted all of them. He began hiccoughing at 6 and John stopped at 8. "That will do. For now."
John chuckled for a moment before nodding at the maid. "Cow biscuits please."
“Even so, pet, go through to the other room. You can play something nice for Kate on your violin while we sort some things here.”
John merely shrugged and tapped his wrists together in front of him.
John had been absently stroking his hair in shock and just nodded, caught completely unawares by the sub’s new attitude. It had to revolve around the violin. John knew he couldn’t rely on that. His sub had to earn the violin, not the other way around. He watched, speechless, as he stood and left closing the door quietly behind him.
"Did I say you could make a noise?" Greg asked, gripping Mycroft's hair in his fist and pulling his head back.
Sherlock was forced to meet his brother's gaze. It made him feel guilty about his biting dog remark seeing the predicament he had got his brother into. It made him feel less guilty when he was a mirror image.
“Yes, sir,” he nodded, glad to just have something to do, especially if it was for his Dom.
Sherlock ignored the effect the praise had on him and swallowed the chunk of pear. It tasted bitter, but the sub kept his mouth shut.
"That's ok, you can stay here alone, for longer."
“Boy!”
He sat beside the sub’s head and brushed his fingers across his cheek. “I wish you would just tell me what the problem was, rather than making me go through all of this with you.” He sighed heavily and caught a few of his curls in his fist. “Rather embarrassing in front of big brother, don’t you think?”
“No, sir.”
Sighing, the doctor took a deep breath. “From this point on, you have no name. I refuse to recognise it or use it.”
"1," he whispered, the bed muffling his words.
Finn pressed it and watched his glass fill. He giggled when the green liquid got to the top and pulled his finger back.
Mycroft watched as the fire of anger lit in Eurus' eyes. "Careful Miss Adler. I've seen that look in my little sister's eyes before."
Eurus' laugh dwindled to nothing. "I don't beat him."
"Do you want to safeword?"
Mycroft ducked his head and Greg yanked it back up again. He kissed him roughly, taking his lip between his teeth.
He ran his hands through his curls first, messing them up a bit before his hands settled behind his back.
“You're here. I knew you would be here. I had nothing to go into Panic for.”
Sherlock began walking to the end of the street, he could maybe get a cab and hold it until John was done. But then he realised that John had asked him for the plan. Which meant he had no idea. Even though it appeared he was taking the lead, which he was glad about. It was great the way the Dom didn’t immediately take over something he wasn’t fluent in. John had said that as he was him, out of his own choice, that they would need to stay together, rely on each other, and that he needed to be polite and then they could act like friends. He knew the Dom would step in when he was out of line though, like he had in the house.
He took his sub by the hand and led him to the door.
"John, I suggest we find our seats." Greg opened the door to the courtroom and held it for the others to enter.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and patted Finn on the head. “You are ridiculous.”
John smiled at the ingenuity involved in working that out, but knew it was probably nothing for Sherlock. It was just rocket science for everyone else.
“Good, pet. Come over here.”
“And what does your Dom think of you staying here, you’ve been with him just over a month and how many times have you attempted to escape?”
Sherlock glanced at the door, thinking hard. John didn’t miss the flash of light that brightened the detective’s features, even for a moment.
"I- that's your-" John sighed. "I know." He put his mug down and took Sherlock's off him. Then he reached over and wrapped his arms around his boyfriend.
After a moment or two of being the smaller one he tugged Sherlock’s sleeve again.
There he was, his sub, his brat. The trouble was. There was a 20 foot gap between the window they were looking through and the window Sherlock was the other side of.
The sub didn’t know what to do or say, he had tried to see how the cuffs held him but they were definitely new issue. Very new. Not something Sherlock had come across before. And he couldn’t reach his pocket for his lock pick kit, even if he could work out where the key went.
“Hang them up,” John ordered when he was satisfied. It had taken nearly an hour to do all 4.
"Piss. Off!" He tried to reach for the cupboard door but John caught his wrist and wedged his foot in the door’s path to stop it closing. The Dom winced at the slam of the wood but Sherlock didn’t feel guilty. He didn’t care. He wanted to be left alone where he could wallow in his misery.

It was 5 days later that Sherlock decided to make his move. There had been gradually more and more of them appearing over the days, but still always at the same time.
"They like picking on you, little brother."

"I think you'll find you meant no, sir. But I further think you'll find you meant yes, sir."
“Well I realised I didn’t get to the toilet unless I’m nice. Please, sir.”
John chuckled again. He had never been so glad that a sub had started to relax around him.
The detective's eyes darted to the strap on the wall by the door and the Dom sighed. "As if I'd use it on you with your brother here."
“Look at me. Sherlock. Look at me.” He repeated. Slowly glassy eyes met his Dom’s.
He sighed in relief when the phone was answered on the fourth ring. He waited out the deductions of the older man and then spoke himself. “Yes, Mycroft, he’s gone, I was with him and then looked up and he was gone. What is he? A child?”
"I could never have been with you, Irene."
Following that interview, the sub was taken back to his cell and his solicitor made a call, no doubt to Mycroft, explaining how screwed his baby brother was. Looked like Mycroft might have to step in... or he would have to if he hadn't disappeared off the face of the Earth.
John ruffled Sherlock's curls as the machine began to move up. "It sure would."
"What were you expecting to happen when you didn't safeword last night? Or just now, in fact."
"As for the lying..." He began, watching as the boy's head snapped up to look at him again. "You seem to think lying in order to cover up the pain you are in is a valid reason. But it's not, pet. In fact, it's the worst possible time for you to lie to me. I need to know when something is wrong. I have to. There is no negotiation on this, Sherlock, do you understand me?"
The detective rolled his eyes. "I'm gay. What part of that don't you understand?"
It didn't take long for Mycroft's hips to start shifting, but he was unsure if he was trying to dislodge them or wanted more.
Greg watched the government official lick his spoon. It was far more obscene and arousing than it should have been. He kicked Mycroft under the table. "Stop that, Myc. It's doing all sorts of things to me."
"No, mistress." Sherlock said.
John grabbed him by the curls and pulled him up straight, then he pressed his foot into the back of his leg, knocking him down to his knees.
He was quite surprised that Sherlock stopped to take his hand before he got too far ahead.
Sherlock glanced at his solicitor, who had appeared at the door to the cell. “Do something!”
“He’s furious. But no, he’s unharmed.”
“Boy!” Sherlock flinched even though the doctor hadn’t even raised his voice. For a man who Sherlock thought was incredibly dull an hour ago, John had surprised him. He didn’t fancy his prospects for the next few hours and John Watson was decidedly not as dull as Sherlock had originally anticipated.
“Sir?”
It wasn't long before Mycroft was growling with frustration.
“I was curious, sir. I’m sorry, sir.”
“Permission to ask a question, sir?” Sherlock asked quietly.
"You should have told me!" Mycroft insisted.
"Trouble. Ha! I like that." Greg grinned at John in the mirror. "You should get him a collar with that on it."
John and Sherlock had been occupying the front room while they waited, Sherlock had been sat writing those boring lines and was more than pleased when John had kissed him and said job done. But now their guests had arrived, the older man put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder and pressed the sub to his knees.
"It happened on Friday night, big brother."
The detective pulled one leg up to protect himself as best he could without causing the stool to tip. it didn't help. Irene struck him on the thigh.
John shook his head, sadly, so much anger still in the boy wasn’t good, but it didn’t make a difference.
Sherlock's cock was trying it's hardest to get hard, with the presence of the plug being enough, but John just laughed. Slipping the by now familiar cage over it before he could become fully hard.
“Put your highly powerful rifle at the back of his head.”
"Good." John opened his flies and lowered his trousers just enough to take his cock out. He stroked it a few times whilst watching his boy's face.
"Don't care," he replied, looking out the window.
He had to control himself like he knew Mycroft would. At least Sherlock had thought he would.
"No!" Mycroft yelled, kicking out at the two women.
“No sir, what?”
Across the room, Sherlock had been bent double and his sister's foot pressed his neck to the floor. At least from that vantage point, he wouldn't be forced to watch what was about to happen.
The helicopter landed and there was no guards in sight.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I. Am. Still. Here," he said as slowly as possible, looking between his brother and John.
Hours later, Sherlock woke. He smiled at John who smiled back at him. Instantly, the sub sat up. There had been a flicker of pain in that smile. He realised he had fallen asleep on his Dom's bad shoulder. "You should have said something, sir."
"There's a little girl that needs us. Needs our help," John chimed in. "Just like you did."
Sherlock glanced up at him with a calculating look. It clearly said, “Make me”
Sherlock let himself be dragged along. He hadn't intended to upset John. He just seemed to be so good at it.
Greg nudged his pet with his toe. "Well, answer John."
"Yes, sir." Of course he did. If he didn't, he'd never have trusted Greg, not just with the BDSM, but with himself, the Mycroft who had never let anyone in before meeting Greg. The BDSM thing had only been one night stands with everyone else.
He sighed. The woman in the pink coat had been dead for hours, he knew what he would need to do he just hadn’t had the chance to tell John what it was, thanks to the sergeant. The rain would get heavier and the wind was likely to pick up too, h had the weather from the previous check on his phone entered into his Mind Palace.
The doctor burst out laughing. "Great idea. But it's still no."
Across the room, Greg had dragged his sub from the corner and deposited him in the middle of the room.
John ran his hand over Sherlock's chest watching as his nipples peaked under the ministrations. Sherlock was waiting for the clamps but was surprised when something like tubing slipped over them instead.
"Good boy," John panted when he could see the clear effort Sherlock was putting in.
“That depends on what you think you heard, Mrs. Hudson.”
"Mm, y-yes, sir." Greg did know and that somehow made it all the more intense. The next two pumps of the fleshlight felt even better, but then it disappeared, leaving his cock bare and aching.
Mycroft frowned, thinking. “No. But if every Dom in the city had at some point touched you in a way you didn't like then yes.”
John pointed at the floor in front of him. "Get here!" He yelled. "Now!"
“Well of course it is,” he stated obviously. “I’m wearing it.”
Finn didn’t seem to understand what the big deal was.
John sat back on the bed and dragged Sherlock by the collar to lay across his lap. The boy whimpered, expecting something more, that bit of help he usually got to stop that burn. John hadn’t done the usual comfort that soothing cream on his red hot ass would offer. Sherlock would need to feel it all day and he deserved to. Deep down, the brat knew that as well.
“I'm starting to get that, yeah,” the DI dry washed his face and leant back in his spiny chair.
When the doctor was completely undressed Sherlock hung the hanger on the hook on the back of the door. “In you get then.” But as he glanced down to the detective – still on his knees – he saw him blushing red before either of them had attempted to get into the shower.
"It wasn't my fault!" Sherlock exclaimed when John walked dangerously towards him.
John couldn’t help but allow the corner of his mouth to curl up at the look of his pet.
"Irene," Sherlock said by way of greeting, his voice cold.
In a rare show of frustration, Mycroft threw his hands up in the air. He grabbed his and Greg’s coats and went back to the living room.
Sherlock looked up in shock, groaning internally as the plug shifted. When he made no move to comply, John gripped him by the curls and pulled him upright.
John couldn't help but laugh.
John called through the order and then pulled Sherlock over on to his lap.
Sherlock whimpered beneath the older man and closed his eyes,
Sherlock jerked his knee away. "Don't care."
Finn moved further back, towards the head of the bed, away from John.
“You have the contract on your side here, John. Apart from running away and having a slight attitude how has he been?”
Sherlock smirked and climbed into the passenger side. "Go for it, big bro."
At that, Mrs. Hudson clasped her hands together, happy tears threatening to fall.
"I don't think so, somehow, do you?" The Superintendent twisted Sherlock's arms until the detective stopped fighting. "I've had practice at this, boy, with blokes that didn't care if they seriously injured me." He leant over the detective to whisper in his ear. "You do."
Irene stepped back and leant against the wall, admiring the pair of them for a while.
The Superintendent finished drying of his sub, then dragged him through to the main bedroom where their clothes were. He opened up one of their bags and got out a complete outfit for Mycroft. Mycroft pouted at the jeans. The shirt at least was partly suitable. "Don't sulk on me now, Mycroft."
“I obeyed, didn’t I?”
John was so surprised by the sudden outburst that he stared after him for a while in mute shock.
Mycroft sighed. “Theoretically. But I won’t let it. And you know how much I mean that.”
Sherlock continued sucking on the cock as if it was John's fingers, only to make the point that he could if he wanted to.
So here the brothers were, beside one another, their hands above their heads as they were marched towards the governor's office in Sherrinford. He didn't know why they still had to put their hands up, they were never armed, maybe it was the sense of defeat Eurus wanted.
John just laughed. “Come on then, you can help.”
“Finish unpacking, pet. I have a surprise for you.”
"You're aware of the change of rules. You're aware that that was not an appropriate way to talk to me even before you ran off so certainly not now. Up and over my lap. If I have to force you it will be 5. And I will force you."
"You may or may not get to come today."
"Well he does a bloody good job pretending he does."
“Excuse me?”
"Yes, sir."
“We’ve discussed this.” He pushed his fingers between his palms, brushing the fading marks. “You don’t hurt yourself. Ever. Now I told you to stay still. You will stay still or do I need to cuff your feet too?”
"Hmm?" Sherlock picked up his slice of toast that John had slid across the table towards him.
“That’s at 7, pet. You can get dressed at half 6. It’s 3 o’clock now. Do you fancy a cup of tea in the den?”
Slowly, Sherlock lowered himself down, more than aware that it was what John was no doubt after. He distinctly felt the chain get tied to the bench and pulled taught. Now he daren't move. If he did, it would hurt beyond belief. He could already feel the strain in his back. It would only get worse.
When no words were forthcoming, John pulled the arm chair over and took his kindle off the shelf.
Sherlock huffed and stared down at his cuffed wrists, wishing he'd found a way out of them weeks ago.
"Mrs. Hudson!" He hammered on her door.
“Maybe this is a big enough punishment.”
“Yes, sir.”
Closing his eyes, John thought quietly to himself before leaning over and biting at his ear.
“Hmm,” Sherlock grunted and tried to glance out the window. They were blacked out so no view. Moriarty almost looked offended.
John laughed with him. He seemed fond of the memory and the Dom reflected on how gorgeous he was not only when he smiled.
With much reluctance, Greg pulled off with a pop.
"Shut it, boy," Greg snapped. The truth was, he was at a loss what to do with the intractable man. "I don't know, John. What is next?"
The Dominatrix regained her composure. "Tie them both over the benches. I won't have either of them causing more trouble."
That caused a mischievous look to come into the little boy’s eyes and he looked at John who winked at him. They would have to team up if they stood any chance at beating either of the Holmes’ towers.
The detective didn't argue, but he knew he wouldn't sleep. As soon as John went to sleep, he was going to sneak out of the bed.
Now he knew what he needed to do, but he had to wait until he knew he had time. He didn’t care how long he would have to wait, he could wait weeks, but it would still be worth it. It turned out that the waiting period was just over 26 hours after Sherlock’s plan had come to his head.
Sherlock glanced up and saw his brother still staring at him in concern. "What?"
Sherlock thrashed and pulled and nearly knocked the three of them over with the amount he was struggling.
The detective shrugged. "You tell me."
“You know, Sherlock, I do love that coat of yours, but it’s rubbish in the rain.”
Sherlock tried to move with the ministrations, but he was bound tightly. John chuckled at the stupidity of trying to fight it in the first place.
“My number is on a website I started at university. It was a while ago, but I didn't want it to be recognised, sir.”
John settled down on the sofa, kicked his feet up onto the coffee table and flicked the TV on. After a few minutes, Greg came in, followed by the older sub, a tray of mugs in his hand.
John froze with one hand in the tub of soothing gel and the other just above his sit spot. It was clear that the term ‘aftercare’ had never been mentioned around him before. Maybe it had been called something else before?
Sherlock frowned now, having the horrible feeling that he was digging a hole. “No.”
"I was the one that didn't play with her."
"Well I'm pretty sure Sherlock is floating." The Dom's clear adoration for his sub came through in his words and gestures. "I'll do as you ask, so long as Mycroft doesn't make him drop."
“Of course. You’ll want the main road if you want signal though. And don’t damage your boy too badly.”
"We're going out."
John laughed as he met Sherlock at the counter.
As he reached the flat for the second time, John was stood in the doorway, grinning broadly.
John placed his hand on Sherlock's head. "How do you mean?"
"At least I can make you more comfortable." He ran a hand down to Sherlock's ankles and started on those ropes as well.
“I still let you down and I’m sorry. I think you deserve a reward.” Nothing could compete with what he deserved, but they had to start somewhere.
The Dom raised an eyebrow.
“What did I say yesterday?”
John smiled grimly, but kept dragging his sub towards the jungle room. He kicked open the door and dragged Sherlock inside.
Irene added two more fingers almost immediately, causing Sherlock to his in pain around his gag. "Some people pay extra for a quick and dirty prep. Trust me, the plug is rather large, Sherlock. This is being gentle." She worked him until she thought he could take it without incurring any damage.
John took his hand. "The two of you were talking. It looked rather intense. Anything I should know?"
Mycroft sighed, but grabbed his coat; his Dom was right, worrying about Sherlock all the time didn't help anything.
Sherlock growled and kicked the floor with his foot. All he had wanted was an interesting morning and to avoid boredom. All he seemed to have managed was to wake up ridiculously early and piss his Dom off twice in as many hours.
“What?” John asked.
The whimper turned into more of a groan until John was back at the unit next to Sherlock.
Eurus seemed almost disappointed by the answer. She paced around both brothers, pushing Irene out of the way. "I intend to get a decent reaction from one of you. Irene, take big brother to their cell. Leave Sherlock with me."
"And did he touch the floor with that leg?"
"I don't know why he likes these things. They hide how fit he is. It really is a sh-"
Sally ignored him, she had been in early to prepare for an early interview with Sherlock. She had been informed the night before by a friend in uniform that the boy had ditched his solicitor when the guy hadn't done anything about the shoes that had been found. It was the perfect opportunity to get to the bottom of this mess and more importantly have Sherlock remanded in custody without bail. Where he should be.
“Why didn’t you just say?”
"I can see that!" John snapped.
With that, Sherlock leant to the side and threw up nearly everything he had just eaten, coughing all the time.
“Fuck sake. The cheeky bastard has played the three of us and won.” He turned on his heel and headed straight back inside to Mycroft.
Sherlock had declared the entire collection boring, but John had enjoyed looking through them over and over with the little boy.
It was easy enough to deduce who had fired the shot. John really had saved his life. But he would not tell him that.
Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise. “I- yes, sir,” he said quickly. “Thank you, sir.”
There was a warm heating sensation in his stomach and he could feel himself getting aroused. He looked down and saw his poor dick imprisoned and locked away. “Bollocks,” he hissed. Then he realised where he was.
Mycroft shook his head, craving more.
John sighed heavily. "I should give you one hell of a spanking for this, but I can't be bothered because I'm so tired." He pushed him to his knees in the corner. "Put your hands behind your head and stay there. I am going back to bed. I'll deal with you later."
"Be quite boy, or I'll stick something hard down there," John warned.
"Go on then."
John laughed and pushed the sub back to the floor.
"Would you like to tie me up sir?" Mycroft suggested, hoping that would satisfy his Dom. "You could tie me up and take me," he added hopefully.
Greg pushed some errant hair out of his eyes and cupped his cheek, “Is this about Sherlock?”
“Carry on like I haven’t realised why he ran and see where we end up.”
As they reached the Yard, it was a confusing situation for the boy. He didn't know whether they'd reached it not soon enough or too soon.
Greg laughed. "I'm a Dom again. Sir," he added sarcastically, as the doctor pulled him to his feet. Greg couldn't resist finishing what he had started.
But the closer they got the more reluctant Sherlock became. He loved John far too much for this to be easy. His steps soon became shuffles, then he stopped altogether.
“Anything to say yet?”
John grabbed a handful of dark curls and pulled his sub up so that he was forced to kneel. Sherlock's eyes immediately went to the cock cage. "Sir, no! I don't deserve that!"
His brother didn't respond and it made him laugh. “You've come round here to plan my wedding and instead we're playing snakes and ladders?”
"Get him up," came a yell from the speakers.
Once it was fully seated inside Sherlock's hole, John patted his hand over it firmly, sending sparks through Sherlock like a firework, then he pulled him upright by his collar, a sharp tug to warn him not to disappoint.
John raised an eyebrow. "Really?" He turned to look at Mycroft. "You three are going to keep me busy in the future. I mean, the way you talked, Greg, it sounds like you still plan on subbing sometime."
“Yes, sir. Crystal, sir.” Sherlock’s hands stayed behind his back and the doctor’s heart clenched.
“That I’m only allowed in your room with you.”
“I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t mean it, babe, despite the circumstances.”
This time, John's sigh was heaved a lot heavier. “Probably. Greg?” He asked as he answered. “He's done what?!”
“Coowee,” the door opened and Mrs. Hudson appeared.
“Sorry, sir.”
“But-”
“I don’t know Detective Inspector.” He turned back to the body. “Looks like asphyxiation probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit,” he grimaced as he said it. “I cant smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs.”
“I would like to speak to the three Holmeses first as they are the first witnesses. Come on through.”
John closed his eyes and took several deep breaths.
The doctor had stepped around behind him to gather up a set of cuffs. When he turned back around and saw Sherlock so straight he was tense, he sighed. "Babe, relax." He knelt behind him, set the cuffs to the side, and started massaging his pet's shoulders.
He still wanted to touch his Dom. Tentatively, he reached out and placed his hands on John's hips. Just that bit of contact felt wonderful.
Eurus tipped his head back by the chin and looked into his eyes, frowning. "You're up to something, little big brother. Aren't you?" she hissed when he didn't respond.
"What would upset you the most?"
"There we go," Greg muttered sarcastically, patting him on the head. "You gonna be a good boy now?"
“Whatever. Can we hurry up and get this over with?” Sherlock clearly didn’t believe the Dom, he felt the need to change his mind now so as to not be left disappointed later.
Sherlock’s grin was mirrored on the Dom’s face as he nodded his acceptance and hugged him back when his arms wrapped round him.
His brother, Mycroft Holmes, was in a different lounge with the Dom, discussing Sherlock’s “behaviour”. Apparently it was out of order for a chemistry graduate turned detective. How many lounges did one house need? He had had asked the exact same question of his parents and was still waiting for an answer.
Without batting an eyelash, John shoved his boyfriend down onto the floor. "You're not a child. You can manage a few hours in a car."
When he was out of sight, John laughed softly. Things were getting so much simpler, the more Sherlock was learning to trust. He had honestly believed after the mistake with Wilkes that this was all over; he was going to fail his first sub, but that hadn’t happened. Somehow, Sherlock had bounched back, stronger than ever. He was definitely the most surprising sub he had ever come across, but he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Wha-?” Sherlock’s eyes had snapped open wide as he looked at the Dom in confusion. He tugged at his chained wrists immediately making John laugh.
“Yes, sir,” he sobbed again. He was still in Panic, even if he was at the edge now, so he no doubt saw the reminder as a threat of punishment later. “I understand.” John wasn’t entirely comfortable with him addressing him like that, but the last thing he wanted was him thinking he was being turned away, now, after how good he had been.
The detective frowned up at the Dom who had perched himself on the edge of the bed, one hand on his belly. “Sir?”
"Then what is the problem? Because you surely can't be worried about Irene Adler that much."
"Yes, sir."
“That’s right, sir. I thought of all the places within about five minutes of the body and only tried the ones big enough for a car.”
The sub beamed and spun to face John. “Can-” he started. “May I hug you, sir?”
"Not right now." Mycroft shook his head. "This is an adult to an adult. Not a sub to a Dom."
This may seem harsh but I will remind you guys that this is a D/s universe and this a common punishment for Dom to do in this situation. Sherlock had plenty of warning
Finn nodded, then crawled over the bed to John. He still looked nervous, but he held out his arms to the doctor. John stood, then picked him up. "Let's go join the others, yeah?"
"What is it?"
Sherlock just frowned. "But it's not a limit, sir. I can't stop you without my safeword if it's not a limit."
“I don’t want to,” Sherlock complained petulantly.
“Present, boy.”
All John did however was bend down to pull a small cap out the tip. Then he fitted a small bag to the end of the cage.
The doctor set it down by Greg and grabbed out a couple of ice cubes for himself. He went over and ran them over Sherlock's nipples, enojoying the jolt of surprise and watching him squirm as he tried to get away from them.
"Being gay means nothing!" Irene hissed as she slapped him. "Now shut up."
"Yes, sir," he agreed dopily.
Slowly, he dropped his arms, but just returned to his ball in the corner. John could see how his legs were now open slightly and spotted how red and raw his cock looked. He must have been feeling that, especially in such a strenuous position.
“I’m not going anywhere, pet. I just want to get you strapped up fully.”
"Alright!" If throwing out the toes kept John from questioning where he had been, it was a small price to pay.
“My good gorgeous boy. You might not have previously liked this, but you will.”
The soldiers were moving out the way, and the woman was leading the Doctor and his new friend through. Shit, he needed to hide. He glanced over his shoulder and found a pile of boxes.
"Well it certainly had the response we wanted," Eurus said with a laugh.
The doctor gave Greg a 'what else can we do' look and let Sherlock go. "Alright, but just go down to where the seagulls are gathered. Don't run off anywhere else."
“Do you not want something like your violin or microscope?” he asked, hoping to lead the sub to an answer that would be beneficial for Sherlock when he saw what progress he made but also gave John something to see what Sherlock's interests were.
“I do believe I told you to do the washing up,” the Dom said, answering the unasked question as if he knew what his sub was thinking, but he didn’t elaborate.
Mycroft bit his lip and tried to look away, but the Superintendent tightened his grip. "Keep your eyes on me, boy."
“You do if you don’t want to wet yourself.”
"No, you're not." They hadn't been here when Sherlock had first got here, in fact it had been weeks into the contract before he had allowed them back. He hadn't thought the sub would be able to deal with them.
Sherlock's whine was pitiful as the dildo was pulled completely free.
After several more minutes of John watching Sherlock, he dragged him across the room to the kitchen. He place a bowl beneath his mouth. “Spit it out.”
"Am I wrong, sir?" Greg said quickly.
Sherlock was getting stared at by Mrs. Hudson. She refused to take her eyes off him as Siger crossed the room and held his hand out to John. As the doctor took Siger's hand, he was pulled into a hug. Mr. Holmes patted him on the back enthusiastically. "It's going to be good having you as part of the family officially. Although, I’m getting a sense of deja vu.”
Sherlock jumped into his Mind Palace quickly and passed on the names of the victims and their addresses.
Shaking his head softly, John removed both chains from the floor and used them as a leash to drag him to the horse.
John gave him a moment to reflect, then cupped the back of his head in his hand. “Tell me the plan then?”
. 8.63MB
The doctor stared at it for a moment and then looked over his shoulder at Sherlock before he burst out laughing.
"What about them?" The doctor made sure to keep feeding the kneeling sub as they talked, maybe multitasking was the best way to keep Sherlock on track.
Greg pushed Mycroft back so he landed on his arse with a grunt. It was in time to see Sherlock.
At that Sherlock froze.
John closed his eyes briefly. He would have smacked himself on the forehead if Sherlock hadn’t been there to witness it. He could see the badly concealed smirk the detective was trying to hide and had to change the subject to not laugh himself. Round 2 to Sherlock, though he wasn’t about to admit that.
The detective's tongue darted out to lick his lips as he nodded eagerly. He'd get to touch John for sure in the shower. He always did. Taking his Dom's hand he let him help him to his feet.
Sherlock had been with the professional Dom for three weeks and improvements had been seen in nearly all aspects, but only slightly in some compared to others.
“As they go, sir. Pretty good, yeah.”
"Put your leg on the table. I'm going to check the swelling in your ankle."
Mycroft shook his head. “No. I merely passed on my... regrets. And her outburst at you no doubt helped.”
There were many skips and bins around, if they got collected or relocated he’d lose his only chance at a lead.
“It won’t be awkward, Sherlock. I won’t make things difficult for you, especially at your place of work, as long as you remember to be respectful and remember the rules. It should be nothing more than two friends okay?”
“That’s the transcript of the interview between my men and the widow. The one there is with the daughter.” He indicated the next paper on the table. “And those are from the first couple. The second couple is in the bottom folder.”
The doctor flicked a switch and let the machine begin its job. Slowly at first, to check there was enough lube and no chafing, but he soon let it speed up.
John patted his boy on the thigh. "Do you want down, pet, or are you still content?"
With a resigned sigh he walk down one street and out the other side, into another. There had to be a hotel around here, somewhere he could sleep in. He found himself completely exhausted, but as he stepped into the third alley in a few minutes he was grabbed from behind and thrown into the wall.
Mycroft grumbled to himself, but didn't speak. His Dom was right. He shouldn't have spoken to him the way he had, no matter the circumstances.
He quickly applied them and joined them together. He ran one chain from the pair down his chest and to his cock cage and he ran another chain up to his collar. By doing it like this John hoped, Sherlock's movements would be more fluid, but he wouldn't be so quick to act, having to first think through the consequences.
"Now we can have waffles," John said with a smug smile.
At that, Sherlock found strength from somewhere and began fighting again. "That wasn't the deal!"
"Charming, mate. Ta."
"Let's put him in another room," Greg said.
The detective rolled his eyes as a man in an all-in-one strolled from the house. With a quick glance at John he tugged his hand free and slotted both into his pockets before turning to the angry looking man, glaring daggers at him.
“And I think from now on, it can probably stay off. I won’t find you getting off in the shower will I, pet?”
"That sort of money wouldn't touch the sides in your account, why was Anthea so bothered?" Sherlock asked with his new found freedom of speech.
“No, sir. I apologise for my brother. I have no idea what caused that-”
The Dom ran his hand through Sherlock's sweaty curls as the younger man sobbed on his lap. He looked down his back and saw how red his arse was, he just couldn't allow himself to put soothing cream on it. Sherlock needed to remember this.
When he didn’t get immediate compliance he pulled Mycroft forward by the scruff of the neck and forced the cuffs on him. Then he pushed him back so he was leaning on his cuffed wrists.
John laughed as he followed his boyfriend up the stairs. The day was turning out so much better than he had expected.
John slicked up the dildo and put it at his boy's entrance. He played with it for a while, pushing it in just an inch, then pulling it back out. He did that several times, before thrusting it in with a single, smooth glide.
Irene heard what she was saying in that sentence. "Fair enough. Do you ever see the… idiots again?"
Mycroft doubled over and grunted, yelling out when his cuffs caught and for the first time he realised his wrists were now chained to the floor. "I don't particularly want to talk to you either," Mycroft hissed.
Kate laughed.
"I don't think I'm going anywhere anytime soon, sir."
“I feel woozy, sir. Like I’m dropping.”
He shushed her and waited until he and Sherlock were out of earshot. "He's had a tough few years. We can talk about it at home, but for now, don’t treat him any differently than you would any other little boy, yeah?" Beth frowned, watching finn closely.
“I’m going to gag you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock glanced down at it beside his Dom, when there was no response, John leant forward and clipped him on the back of the head again.
The older man had opened the cell door and the sub stood there with his arms folded.
When they reached eight, Sherlock was struggling to keep his voice level, the strap covered a larger surface area than the cane or a crop but it didn't help to dull the sensation at all. He didn't know if he'd be able to count all the way to 15.
"I won't beg," the sub said petulantly.
"Why did you open the door?"
The doctor waited for him to make some headway and then cleared his throat pointedly. “And where do you think you’ve been?” he asked, his tone brooked no argument.
The doctor ignored the shower that morning and instead got back into a suit again, he had been beginning to relax around the sub, having no need to put up a front.
"There is one, but it's in one of the other rooms."
"I am gay."
"Eurus, you mentioned you had some toys?"
“Right answer.” He ruffled his curls and for once Sherlock didn’t pull away. “Good boy,” he praised. He could see the effort the boy had exerted in not flinching away and began to unthread the rope from around him. He brought his hands to his front and cuffed them there instead.
