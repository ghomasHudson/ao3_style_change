Hello, D.
[Thu. 11:10 p.m.]
. It feels unbelievable and like everything he's ever lost and ever wanted has finally come back to him.  It feels unreal and like the only real thing in the universe. It feels perfect.
Dean loved Halloween. It was his favorite holiday. He loved the sugar, the scary stuff and the slutty costumes -not necessarily in that order. He usually started thinking about his costume in August, but he had just learned one hour ago that one jummy looking theology major was going to be at this party, so he wasn't about to pull a Cady from Mean Girls and show up in his horrifying vampire costume. He'll save that one for later, October had only started anyway. Instead, he had looked up some last minute ideas online, begged Charlie to make good use of her amazing make up skills and turn him into a "sexy reaper".
"Clearly." Cas agreed with a sheepish smile.
They kept talking about the midterms and their families and how things were going back in Lawrence as they ate lunch. Dean thought it was nice to have someone who knew him so well so close for when things went south. He gave the blonde a big kiss on the cheek when he dropped her at her dorm and made a promise to go to their faculty Halloween party that night.
It was laughing like an idiot staring at his phone screen and being unable to listen to Muse’s Starlight without automatically thinking about Dean, and waking up with a smile on his face because he knew he had a new text from Dean waiting for him when he opened his eyes. And he felt bliss. So he held on to that, and forgot about everything else.
“Nah, I don’t think so.” Jo dismisses, waving a hand “Did you see that dude? He’s like
Castiel considered the answer for a few seconds before replying.
"I am. Thank you for... Stepping in."
Dean is pleasantly surprised to find it doesn't feel weird or embarrassing or over sharing to be telling him all these intimate details about his life, about who he is. It feels right. And when he listens to Cas' stories, he is actually listening, not just waiting for his time to respond. He hears the inflection in Cas' voice when he mentions his brothers, and notices how it changes when he talks about a particular book or author that he likes. And Dean can't help but think about how this, right here, holding Castiel in his arms while he's falling asleep... It just feels right.
K, enjoy~
much, anyway. So he didn't ssee the slightly panicked face the boy in the trench coat had made before he sat at the edge of the bed and started to read in silence.
By the end of the summer, he's only going on Grindr once a week and he's able to look at Jo in the eyes again –his own blue pair finally clear from the fog and the redness of the previous month. She gives him a knowing look and turns her attention back to the screen, where her and Charlie are killing aliens with laser guns.
Perhaps he trembles a little as he types that and replays the song to listen to it again.
dontcha think?
He cleared his throat, taking off his headphones. "So sorry, man. Didn't see you there."
the silence and the staring can be when it is Cas he's silently staring at. After a few minutes of peaceful silence they start talking again.
He doesn't say that. He doesn't say any of the hundreds of things that are running through his mind in that moment. He just stands there, silent and shirtless. Exposed as he has never been before. Physically, but most importantly, emotionally. This is the first time in years he dared to bare his feelings open in front of someone else. He is terrified.
He said his good-byes to his friends and left early, against Jo protests because if he was leaving tomorrow he needed to pack some stuffs and get some shit done before. He felt his phone buzzing but didn’t check until he arrived to his own dorm, though he already knew what it was. Sam’s answer:
They all mumble their apologies as Benny pours them coke in some glasses and settle in the bed so they can all watch their show. And for a moment Dean forgets about everything. Fuck Castiel and his pretentiousness and fuck his homework and fuck his not having talked to his parents in about a month and he really should call them though, but not right now, right now it was just him and his friends and Doctor Sexy and popcorn. The rest of the world could fuck off, for now.
"Yeah! They were really cool. I, um, started working on a draft, I'm not sure I sent it to you"
"Yeah, I take Greek because I don't know Greek! What the hell?"
Truth be told, I kind of hope that you won't.
"I'm going to introduce you to someone" Benny continued, ignoring Dean's please-god-kill-me-now face "not that I know anyone who would be interested in you, but as soon as I do... I mean, not that people wouldn't be interested in you but, you know, like... Guys, who would be into guys. I don't know many, actually, I think you're the only gay dude I..."
time.
He doesn't need to make an effort to ignore the sad look Jo gives him as he blows smoke rings into the small dorm room. He's too-high-to-care right now. He's too sad to care right now.
Castiel keeps telling him everything as they walk under the moonlight, and Dean. Dean
Dean Winchester closed his eyes again, sitting up against the bedhead, trying to gather whatever strength he had left to re-center himself.
"What the...
A minute of silence passes before Castiel dares to speak.
He checked his phone again and looked at the notification bar, the app was installed. His heart skipped a bit but he ignored it and decided to read his messages instead. His mom wanted him to go back to Lawrence for the weekend, she said they missed him and given he had no class on Fridays and only two on Tuesdays afternoons and Monday was a minor holiday, but still a holiday, he’d be free for five days.
“We're all fucked up, Dean. Don't flatter youself.”
The world around him snaps back into focus as the DJ drops the beat of the song that she's playing at that moment and the crowd goes wild with a collective "woohoo". It is then that Dean realizes he and Castiel are standing still in the middle of the dance floor, just staring at each other, as everyone around him dances. He tries to say something, to seize the moment, but he can't. He's a little too drunk for this and his mouth is a little too dry and a little too wanting to rip away Castiel's pants with his teeth. So it is Cas who speaks, frowning a little,
"Then no sex on the first... Would you call this a date?" he tilts his head to the side when he asks the question and damn if he isn't cute as fuck when he does that.
Castiel smiles that open smile again -God, Dean wants to ravage him again.
he thinks. He might be a little too drunk to be making this decision. But right now, with Castiel staring up at him with those big blue eyes and those cat ears and that bow tie... Tomorrow he will probably hate himself for doing it this way. But right now, his brain has left the building and the smell of Castiel's sweat is drowning his lungs and his dick is making all his decisions for him. So Dean leans in and kisses him.
Trigger warning: anorexic ideas. They're subtle, but they're there. Sorry.
"What the... what?" Dean shakes his head, dumbfounded.
I like to believe that you won't let me down.
"Dude, I'm majoring in engineering, okay? I'm just taking this class because I'm a nerd and I like Greek culture, but all I know about it is Achilles was hot as hell. I really like the whole Greek mythology thing, and the traditions were pretty cool as well, but I don't know the Illiad by heart."
That is why, when Castiel saw a kind-of-awkward-but-still-hella-good-looking Dean Winchester sitting in the front row of his econ class on his third year of college, he smiled at the green-eyed boy, but thought nothing of it.
going to fuck up if you keep this up for too long, Dean-o" she paused to look pointedly at Dean "And also... I mean, is this thing you're doing completely immature and could be solved in a civilized manner by having a 10 minute conversation with the guy? Yes. Hell yes.” at this, Dean rolled his eyes at her. “But... I know you, and you are not going to do that because.. ”
"Well, then." Castiel nods "Would you like a shirt, or... Any garment?"
God, he was gone.
And all this time, Dean never thought his angel was capable of human emotions. Had he known...
Forgive my bluntness, I am not willing to associate myself with someone who isn’t at peace with himself.
felt more like home than his dorm. Maybe that was why it didn't reflect his personality at all. He never cared to decorate it or make it 'his'. Or maybe, that was the exact reason why it
A whole five minutes pass before he dares to open his Grindr messages again, Castiel hasn’t said a thing. He hasn't even read the message
Cas felt anxious and hopeful and generally shitty about himself. All at once. He was lucky to have found Dean again. He was happy to be able to share so much time with him, to make him laugh, to spend every waking moment either with him or texting him. To be honest, he was

angel wouldn't answer his prayer.
“So? You’re attractive too. If we were straight, I’d totally bang you.”
[Fri. 11:06 p.m.]
Dean packs and unpacks his bag three times that first week without him. But he can't bring himself to do actually leave. He can't.
When he didn't hear the familiar Grindr ping coming from his phone the next morning, he told himself Cas probably was still sleeping, or in class. The dude was double-majoring, for fuck's sake. He had every right to be busy.
“τέτλαθι δή, κραδίη: καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο ποτ᾽ ἔτλης.”
"Deeeeean, you there?"
“But I want to. I trust you.”
Castiel is in love with Dean Winchester. He has been for the past two years. Since the second time he met Dean.
After that, they'd spend about 15 minutes in each of Cas' visits catching up about their lives, and then they'd sit down and get some work done. Sometimes, after class they'd agree to go to the coffee place instead, and Dean would smile and Charlie would roll her eyes at him to just declare his love for this guy already. But beautiful blue eyes aside, Dean had never gotten so much done this quickly until the study dates with Cas started. So he actually enjoyed the study sessions, if not only for the pleasure of the company but because in a subconscious attempt to impress Cas, he'd work twice as hard as he usually did and finished his robotics project in a couple of weeks.
But his phone buzzed again and,
Cas to understand. "I-I..."
It wasn't that mysterious, really. They had opposite majors (Literature and Engineering) and they had never ran into each other in campus before. It had been luck that they even met in the first place. And Dean had called him using Charlie's phone, so it's not like he had anyway to reach him. And a part of Cas felt sad because he
. But it’s done. He wipes the lonely tear that dared appear in the corner of his eye, and it’s done.
"Don't you take Greek?"
He stops crying himself to sleep after the first month. Though he still wakes up in cold sweats at 3:00 am most nights.
“Because I'm awesome” she smiled.
So...
“Hey stranger”, he said to Dean in what Cas recognized vaguely as a British accent:
What makes you “like me”?
They went to a hipster pet-friendly organic place that was a 15-min ride from their dorm. That had been Castiel's idea, of course. Dean hated to admit it but the coffee was actually
"You thought... what,
They laughed together for a minute before Dean said, whipping happy tears from his eyes “Wow, you’ve gotten cocky”
Probably himself's.
It's enough that he still sees the angel's death whenever he closes his eyes for longer than a second. That he can't stop thinking about all the things he didn't do or say when he had the time.
[Thu. 9:35 a.m.]
u screwed up
“Yes. I just…” he looks up at Dean. “I haven’t always been a good person, D.”
?" he can hear the plead in his own voice but, at this point, he doesn't care.
“Oh my God, Dean you have to talk to him!”
When a couple of seconds pass without Castiel answering, Dean takes it as his cue to step in.
[Thu. 11:01 p.m.]

“Wait, was
[Thu. 11:02 p.m.]
"Oh I'm sure you two are in a really healthy, exclusive relationship" she said, taking a handful of popcorn from the bowl.
“How do you even know all that? You stalker!” says Charlie
“The benefit of the friend is that he gets to spend time with the person he loves”, Cas had read somewhere, and he truly believed it. So he felt blessed that he could at least be around Dean, and enjoy his company, even if it came in a friendship-only package.
He stares at the screen and he hits the 'send' button and it’s already done and he’s not shaking, really, he
And eventually, they go away.
Dean is a nerd, which is why he's rocking out to Mamma Mia on his way back to his room after a long day when he bumps into... someone.
how that makes him feel.
Castiel squinted his eyes at him and repeated, this time slower:
Dean doesn’t say anything. Instead, he takes Cas’ hand in his tightly and leads him out of the club.
Dean had been his crush his first year, but that was it. No need to get his hopes high or get all excited for something that wasn't there. That crush had been all in his mind. They had only talked that one time. And sure, it had been for hours and it felt like magic, and Castiel doesn't remember ever being that comfortable with someone else. But. Benny. And this was nothing. So he thought nothing of it.
Castiel is a Thursday angel.
“You should do something about it” she says after sighing and dramatically rolling her eyes.
"You were?" he seems genuinely confused and Dean doesn't know what to do to seize the moment.
"You're welcome."
The sight of Castiel slowly turning to face him with those piercing blue eyes that seemed to stare into his soul left him speechless for a moment.
Charlie sighs one more time “Whatever, keep staring at his back then” he says before opening her book and leafing through it.
[Thu. 10:49 p.m.]
He stares at the screen and for the first time since this whole thing started he can finally admit to himself that he is afraid. He's scared shitless because he hasn’t done any of this shit, not since Jesse. Sure, he liked Lisa but when she cheated on him it was his ego that got hurt, not his heart. He hasn’t actually experienced this feeling, not since high school. Not since
"Dean, would you please pick up your phone and tell whoever is harassing you on Grindr to shut up?" Jo finally snapped.
That you are not currently texting me in an attempt to cat fish me.
see? U wont even defend ur self
Up to this moment, it had been Cas who sat on the desk, while Dean used his bed to stare at him, be sexually frustrated and get done whatever he could while fantasizing about all the things he would like the blue-eyed boy to do to him on that very same desk. But right now, these stupid bugs needed to be dealt with and however enticing, he couldn't afford to be distracted by the thought of Castiel laying on his bed. Not
[Thu. 11:34 p.m.]
Dean wasn’t reading the messages Castiel was sending him because he was positioning himself to take the best possible version of the picture he wanted to send him. He didn’t want the blue-eyed boy to know who he was just yet –he felt the earth would swallow him if that happened. But he understood why Castiel wanted to make sure he wasn’t being cat fished, and a third wicked part of him, that had been lonely for far too long (and receiving too many unsolicited dick-pics lately), craved whatever little action he could get. So he took ten pictures, chose the best one, and send it to Castiel.
how lucky he was that
Prove it.
They get working on their group project and Dean asks stupid questions -or are they stupid?
All the time they wasted.
one of those classes where you just watch movies all year
Castiel hunched his shoulders, slipping his hand in the pockets of his trench coat, trying to make himself smaller, trying to make them stop and forget about him. He did not want to be hearing this conversation.
I can't focus.
Dean froze for a second, before smiling fondly at his phone and typing his reply.
Returning that night to his dorm room he bumped into someone. He had been blasting Mamma Mia's soundtrack on his headphones (not that he'd ever admit that out loud), with his eyes closed, as he knew by heart the way back to his dorm and usually at this time of day the halls were empty. Not this night, though. Tonight he had bumped into someone. And because his life lacked many things but not dramatic effect, just as he turned to apologize and Meryl Streep sang the last
He speaks with a thick English accent and the way he gestures at Castiel with the drink he's holding in his hand, Dean doesn't like it. He can't quite put his finger on why, he just doesn't.
Making me uncomfortable, I mean.
"Hey... where are you? Castiel's already here!" Dean tried to keep his voice as calmed and quiet as possible.
"Castiel. Goodnight... Dean, right?"
"Not for nothing, but the last person who looked at me like that... I got laid."
“I can’t!” he actually whined, but then sighed and kept talking “At least, not until I come back from Lawrence, I gotta delete the app before leaving campus”
“Isn’t it that gay app Jo teased you about?”
that'd be cool
"Yes, we should get started on the project. I will e-mail you some references we could use." A beep came out of the pocket of his sweatpants, Castiel took out his phone, read a message, sighed and said "It appears my roommate's girlfriend has fallen asleep and it is now safe for me to return."
“It’s a nightmare for queer people, a total nightmare. Plus, my dad would kill me if...” he cut that train of thought, he didn’t want to think about that right now “No. I’m deleting it for the weekend and when I come back, I’ll download it again.”
[Thu. 11:25 p.m.]
"Heyyyy!" he smiles, putting his arm around Cas' shoulders, and giving him a kiss on the cheek. "Sorry I took so long, there was a line."
He told his parents he was meeting a friend from high school (at least he wasn’t lying to them anymore) and that we’d be back by dinner, before driving off to their usual meeting spot: the ghost town just a few miles away. It was funny how neither of them had to ask where they would be meeting, they just
So, he does as Charlie told him and he keeps staring at his back. But when the teacher tells them to form groups for a project and Castiel turns to ask if they can all work together, he doesn’t even try to hide his smile because he can’t believe this incredibly handsome and intelligent man wants to work with him in a project about Ancient Greece and he really doesn’t know much about Ancient Greece, he shouldn’t even be here, like, he didn’t have to take this class but he did, because he’s a weirdo.
” Castiel corrects him and Dean can’t help the smile on his lips at the past tense. “He was my friend… I think. We were also lovers.”
"Oh. Hello, Dean. I... wasn't sure you were home."
"Dude, hahaha, it's okay! Sorry I woke you up, but, um... I was going out for a cup of coffee and thought maybe you'd like to come?"
When Dean answered his question with a vague “Maybe ;)” he’d thought the dude would add something else, but he didn’t, and Dean didn’t know what else to say, either. So he put his phone back in his pocket and settled for not thinking about it, have a good time with his friends and try to look extra hot tonight –just in case.
*eyeroll emoji*
Dean looks down at himself. He had forgotten about his own naked torso, and the tight jeans started to feel tighter a while ago. "Sure!" he says, still strangely overly confident. "Whatcha got?"
They kiss, and they kiss, and they kiss. Partly because of how amazing it feels, and partly because Dean is too afraid of what's going to happen once they stop. Once the world snaps back into focus and they're not alone in the universe anymore. And he kind of hates himself for being such a coward, for lying to Cas, for waiting so long to make an actual move on him. And he lowkey still hates himself for so many other things, and he's still so broken and fucked up inside, that he's not sure he has a right to bring any of those things into Castiel's life. But
"Oh, that's more than just okay, Cas. It's awesome." Dean hears himself say before he can process what's happening and he's glad he subconsciously switched into flirting mode and isn't drooling anymore, because
Which one?
[Fri. 11:02 p.m.]
I'm glad you liked it.
When Castiel stops and drops his hand back to the side of his body, Dean finally dares to look up from his own chest, back at Castiel and into his eyes. Into those impossibly deep eyes he has become addicted to. Dean is sure he has forgotten how to breathe, and the air has become unbearably thick around them. He doesn't know what to say or what to do, but somehow he is certain he has fucked everything up. Until the dark-haired boy finally breaks the silence between them.
, he wants to say.
“Jeez, I go away for ten minutes and you’re already whining all over the place” asks Benny as he enters through the door, carrying a big bottle of coke.
Then I wish for all wars to end. Wars are horrible.
[Fri. 11:08 p.m.]
“So why haven’t you texted him, again?” asks Jo when he visits her to deliver the stuff her mom sent her. “You just need to rage-fuck him, get it out of your system and move on.”
he thought as he typed it in the app store of his phone.
Oooh, the summer is ending. What's gonna happen next? 👀
"I-" Dean glanced quickly at Castiel as he entered the room, then back at his screen again "I kind of am, sorry, man. But, please, make yourself comfortable." he pointed at the bed behind him and turned to his computer.
Castiel's nod was all the answer he got. He was immersed in reviewing what Dean had written and Dean himself couldn't help but feel a little nervous about that. He had been very proud of himself when he finished the draft, but now he was doubting everything he had ever said in his life because now this super smart and hot and well-read person was judging his writing, and he was sure the blue-eyed boy would hate it and think him an idiot and never talk to him again.
in the cashier line.
Dean took a couple of minutes to admire the way Castiel's gestures softened now that he wasn't aware of the world around him. How his chest rose and fell with the slow rhythm of his breath. Then he checked the hour and decided it better to wake him up. He could finally take a break from that goddamned code, he wasn't going to spend it being a creep watching him sleep.
spent two years fantasizing about the perfect person for him and putting Dean’s face on him. The engineering student wasn’t exactly to blame for not being into Spanish poetry or South African indie-rock, or for trying to be funny by making jokes about Cas’ last name (“The party and the Motherland need you, Krushnic!” he would say with a heavy accent).
So now he just needed to prove he had a valid reason to know these things about him. He looked around and saw his opened backpack on the floor, sliding from it was his Greece 101 text book. He turned his eyes back to the phone in his left hand. There were other 20 people in that class. There was no way Castiel could guess who he was.
Although, in order for an actual friendship to form, I would need to have more information about you, D.
That he still does. That he always will.
. After all, they still have a history class together next semester. They’ll be seeing each other two times a week anyway. Perhaps Dean is just being considerate, and giving him the space to be with his family. It’s not like the blonde knows Cas is a black sheep in his parents’ eyes, anyway. They never talked about it, about the real stuff. They just shared memes and laughed, and Castiel got lost in Dean’s eyes when he talked about cars.
"I’m more of a Patroclus man, myself"
“But are you gonna talk to him, right?”
Usually, when the nightmares were too much, he'd pray to his best friend. The angel would fly down, look at him with a light frown, but say nothing and touch his forehead lightly, making the bad dreams go away for the night.
Castiel has never seemed so small to Dean. That all-mighty, all wise, asshole he’s been hating all this time because of how he always acts like he’s smarter and better than everyone else in the world. He now looks to Dean like a wounded animal and he can't help but worry. Who
, he thought, out of instinct, trying to catch his breath.
This ended up being more angsty than I anticipated. Balthazar cameo! he's kind of a douche tho, I don't know why.
“Yeah, better luck next time, sorry, man”
The truth is, Castiel numbs at sadness. It's not an emotion he's ever felt comfortable with, so as a teenager he learned to numb it out. He doesn't even need drugs to do it. The drugs are for fun. For distracting himself. For feeling like he's having an orgasm when the bass drops and he can't tell he's thirsty and his lips are chapped, and he can't feel a bad thing in the world.
"Hello, De- Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were busy"
"Hey!" he touched his shoulder, "get up, buddy"
"I know you. You're not some common slut."
“Because you love me so much”
They were at Cas' dorm, drinking cheap vodka with Jo and Ash, and Pam, and Chuck. Cas was trying not to think too much about when he'd started to spend more time with Dean's friends than with his own, when Chuck looked at his phone and read the tour dates the band had announced that morning.
“You’ve never lived in a small town, havecha?” he said, chewing on his burger,
was, and wherever that somewhere could be.
[Thu. 10:38 p.m.]
Three strong knocks on his door and Charlie's voice calling his name brought him back to reality before he even noticed it.
The next day, he had to deliver a paper and then he’d go home. He was so happy to see his mother again, God he missed that woman. And he could use the break, because really, campus life was awesome but also really stressing, plus, everybody he knew was going out this weekend and he had no money so he preferred to go see his mom instead of staying in his dorm watching porn and eating frozen lasagna while everybody else was partying until they passed out.
"Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll show you where I parked."
"Hey guys," Sam says, smiling from his bed. His grin wavers as his eyes glance over Dean, but then he sees the kids and it brightens again. "How are my favourite nieces and nephews?"
"Yes, really," he snickers, "I was prepared to go with it, but she wasn't impressed by my statistics on the socio-psychological probability of sex workers having absentee fathers."
Suddenly, it all clicks together: I don't know how it didn't sooner. Crazy, threatening lumberjack man, and calm, cool, collected Sam. Brothers. Not only was it a terrible rhyme, it was also fucking insane.
"Their name could be Flash-fucking-Gordon for all I care, why do you keep ab
nieces and nephews," Claire giggles.
have to bring the children out from the playroom, couldn't you just-?" Cas is cut off when Sam hacks out another cough, but he's right, the kids look scared. Claire is staring up at Dean, and Emma has been roused by the loud voices.
Everything was neat, orderly. Sam-ish. I reached out from under his bed, and pulled out his duffle bag. I dumped out his gym clothes, which also smelled like him but in the worst possible way. I was so busy packing I hadn't even noticed the tears sliding down my cheeks.
He laughs bitterly. I reach out, to tentatively pat his arm, but he stops me when he looks into my eyes.
My shitbox car makes it most of the way to the motel, but it clunks and starts rattling wildly with a mile to go. I sigh and pull over. I can't afford this, until I remember something Cas told me last night. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's worth a shot.
Cas harrumphed, fiddling with his wedding band. "Me, I suppose. Your father isn't the biggest supporter of gay marriage."
"Yeah Dean," Claire chirps, taking the phone as her stepdad piles groceries onto the conveyor belt. I follow his lead, transferring my meagre ingredients as well.
"Daddy," the younger girl whined in her baby slur, dragging out the word, and then dragging her feet until her dad came to a stop. "We've been walking around forever and ever! When can we
"Ok is one word for it," Sam smiles at me again, a little smudge of dark chocolate on one of his front teeth. "I'm a little surprised my brother is here."
I peeked through the shelf, the little girl's face was scrunched in confusion, "Who?"
"Oh, them?" Sam grimaces, moving the cake to his other hand, "Were they the ones shouting before? I should have known, my brother's in a mood."
I carefully transfer the fruits of my labour to a cake box. I go into his room, his solemn, still room that smelt so strongly of him, and grab the bag I'd packed for him earlier, when I'd been putting off going shopping. I dragged it for the doorway, perhaps overpacked is more accurate, and remember turning off his laptop, which must mean I'd forgotten it.
For a second, I think he's going to hit me, I'm sure of it in fact, as I crane my neck to look up at him. His finger presses harder on the hard plate between my collarbones, it aches. The pain makes me stand a little taller. "You are nothing to me." He tells me. Like it wasn't obvious. "You're just one more person who thinks the sun shines out Sam's ass."
Cas pulls at his shoulder and Dean drops me. The man in the trench coat has their baby clutched to his chest, the little boy is wailing pathetically. I slump to the floor, crawling over to the duffle bag and cake. My eyes felt too big, too swollen like they would burst, and snot bubbles down to my top lip. I couldn't understand why no one else had come out, could they not hear the commotion? Cas may have been keeping his tone level, but Dean was shouting so loudly I felt like my skull was rattling, and no matter how gently his father rocked him the baby continued to wail. Desperate to escape, I grabbed my stuff and slipped inside.
"How could he be?" Dean says coldly, "Family doesn't abandon you, so he doesn't really fit the bill."
"Unless you'd like to carry Claire...?" he trails off. I take the baby.
I snorted at the thought of this refined, paternal guy surrounded by naked, gyrating women. "Really?"
Cas composed himself. "Mad at John? For being a..." He lowered his voice "...
Dean smiles as he pops the hood, which I mistake as good news. Foolishly, considering the steam that pours out. "Dog's breakfast, much?" he tells me.
" Dean fumes, "Just like my fucking
The door opens, and Dean steps through. He has Emma on one hip and is holding Claire's hand with the one he has free. The girls seem tired, but, Dean is just sour. "We're leaving Cas, come on."
Oh. The determined set of my lips drooped, as I noticed I was missing sugar. It was the only reason I had come today, today specifically. I needed it. Without the sugar, there would be no baking and without the baking, there would be no cake, and if there was no cake-
"Yeah, we were really happy," Cas is interrupted by Jack mewling suddenly, but he just takes a bottle from some pocket and continues, "Then some woman Dean had had a one night stand with turned out to have had his child, which sure was a surprise, especially because she had joined a cult, and child services had seized Emma. Luckily her mom put Dean on her birth certificate so we were able to stop her from going into foster care, and I've even adopted her since then."
"Dada?" Emma warbles, stepping closer as her chin shakes, "Dada ok?"
), "Sam is family-"
Cas takes a step back, his eyebrows furrow. He tries to find the words. "Are you... Are you saying you regret getting married? Married... to me?"
There's a brief, joking headcount from Dean and then we head into the hospital. I hadn't even noticed but Dean managed to get a great parking lot with almost no effort. My eyes narrow. Bastard.
"Maybe," Cas tells me. It's hard to tell whether he's huffing in frustration or exertion. "I was really hard on him. He's been under so much stress lately."
"Yes, but we weren't properly introduced," he tells me earnestly.
"I don't," I say stubbornly, clutching his wrist. "He's my friend. And you're the kind of guy who would give a stranger something they need because they say their friend is in hospital. I respect you, but even I can see you need to forgive him for your own sake."
The girls arrive giggling and squealing. "Daddy, Dean, look! We got one with a seat for Jack!" The one called Claire chirped, bouncing on her tiptoes.
I make my way back down to my car. I may be no expert on families, but I think they're going to be ok. Sure, it would have been nice if Dean had welcomed me with open arms, but it's not like it's not understandable. They had been nice to me, shared some nice anecdotes, but at the end of the day, I was still a stranger. I didn't need some satisfying, emotional full circle. They loved each other, and at the end of the day, that was all that really matters.
It was completely quiet for the moment, even the relentless radio dribble was silent between songs. I couldn't understand the tension, it was leaking through the shelves. "Dean is just... getting a present for uncle Sammy. You remember your uncle Sammy right?"
"You're really ganging up on me?" Dean scoffs, pulling the trench coat tighter around him. He looks between the two of us, and he seems suspicious like we planned this.
I hesitated. Everything was the matter, I was even more volatile than usual. I assumed he meant why I had burst into his room like a slippery hot potato. "There's these guys outside..."
Parking is ridiculous, of course. I'm nervous talking to the receptionist, but she's nice enough I guess. She warns me I only have an hour. I thank her. Elevators are not as fun when your friend is dying apparently, who would have thought. Corridor, corridor, slightly lost and then. I'm here.
"Oh, sorry," a gruff voice says from above me. My eyes travel up, and up, to a handsome middle-aged guy, early forties, late thirties, wearing a trench coat over a dress shirt and pulling a little four-year-old girl closer to him so she didn't knock into me too. He had a baby in his other arm and trailing behind him was another girl, a little older but probably only around eight. I knew it was just a minor inconvenience, getting bumped into like that, and it was such a stupid thing to be upset about considering everything else going on, but I really did almost burst into tears right then and there.
"That's not what you told me," I pipe up nervously, shaky in my attempt to show up. "You said you weren't angry anymore."
He reaches out a hand, Dean flinches as it gently touches his stubbled cheek. "I didn't know, but that's no excuse. You know I love you too, right?"
I pull out the cake, and I have to put it on a rack because of our shitty, peeling plastic countertop. I've done this enough times that I can sort of go on autopilot, and then I look down and there's this really just, great looking cake in front of me. It feels good. He'll like it. I think back to the couple, to Dean. I hope they found their marshmallows. I hope his brother Sammy likes them.
I cried for a while, cried because I didn't know. Because I was scared. Because I couldn't hear Sam sleeping in the room next door.
Then, of course, I laid down, but when I couldn't relax, I tiptoed into Sam's room. It was as still as a mausoleum. It smelled like him.
"I can't just turn up empty-handed," he tells me, this humungous tough-guy, miserable and pathetic.  "He told me once when we were little kids, tiny, barely Claire's age, about these marshmallow nachos? I just remembered it the other day and... I figured if I turned up with his weirdo snack, with the same marshmallows we got when we were kids.... It might do something. He might... Forgive me."
"Abandoning you?" Cas asks hesitantly, "Sunshine, what do you mean?"
My face contorts, "Well, I don't like it, no."
Dean goes quiet. His face droops. "You think he still would?"
The guy behind the counter, some nerdy, cute Asian dude, makes small talk, but I stay strong and keep my focus laser-sharp on them. The cashier, "Kevin" according to his name tag, bags up my stuff with a shy smile, and though I didn't want to seem rude I didn't really give him a second glance. I needed to get in some sort of position. Prepare myself.
Sugar........................................ Aisle 7
"Well, I was buying the ingredients for your cake... and-"
"You know you don't actually have to wait, or even indicate," Cas tells me from the passenger seat, quietly, so as to not disturb Claire and Jack, "Dean told me, it doesn't actually matter if there's no one else there."
"You doin' ok Sam?" I ask him, stupid question really. He's lying in a hospital bed, his girlfriend is dead. His brother is kind of a dick. I bite my lip, I shouldn't think like that.
I do not mention how hard it must be to fill such large hands.
When I'm baking, I often think about chemistry class. As most people who have been in chemistry class know, unless you understandably weren't paying attention, there are physical and chemical changes. Physical changes can be reversed, chemical cannot. Except that's wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. That has nothing to do with it. When I crack this egg, there is no going back. I can glue it back together again, but it will never be the same. I could never possibly get all the goop back in there again. That egg, even though the change is just physical, would never be the same again. It could never be reversed. Now. I didn't pay nearly enough attention to tell you a chemical change that could be reversed, because the only example I can remember is baking a fucking cake, and cake can't go back to batter, no matter how much you try. This may all sound like an extended metaphor, am I the egg? Am I the cake? I don't think it is. I'm just thinking while making a cake. And when I make cake, I think about physical and chemical changes.
For a second, I think he might be making fun of me, because I am a pretty... conscientious... driver, but when I glance over, his face is unamused.
"All things considered," the doctor had told me over the phone in a hush-hush voice, "his injuries are pretty grave, but relatively they're nothing at all."
"Oh," I wince, thinking of how he had stared vacantly at the full parking lot. "The dick?"
I blink. "Yeah. I could."
Eventually, everything made its way into my little shitbox of a car, and then it was off to the hospital. Off to the fucking hospital.
"That was until you slipped out to talk to your little friend!" Dean exclaimed, throwing up his hands, "You just want to spend time with anyone but me lately, don't you? Sam, whats-their-face here-!"
"Oh, nothing," I tell him, high and hysterical, scrambling to my feet and approaching the bed. He's got an IV drip in, and his leg is hanging suspended in a cast. I'm a little confused, to be honest. I had thought he was dying. This looked... Fine. Serious, but nothing like Jessica.
"No," he muses. He hands me Jack, bottle and all, once I've parked so I can get out while he grabs Claire. I've gotten quite used to holding him already, perhaps we've bonded as fellow children of dead parents. "We only met a couple of times, he was in prison mostly when I was growing up, and most of our interactions when I was older usually ended in a physical altercation."
I was stopped cold. Colder than this stupid store. No sugar. Sold out. Bare. Empty. I clenched my jaw. My throat felt full and hot and it might not be puke but I wasn't taking any chances. I couldn't formulate a single thought, not with the static buzzing in my brain. This could not be happening. Instantly my phone is in my hands, frantically googling 'sugar substitutes', only interrupted when a shoulder bumps into mine. Well, an upper arm bumps into my head.
"I'm not trying to prove anything and you know it," Dean hissed, even from here I could see the muscles in the back of his neck straining. He paused, heaved what I'm assuming was a massive sigh, and started putting apples into a little plastic bag. "It's just... You wouldn't understand, Cas."
"Wait!" a gruff voice shouts from behind me, I turn to see Cas walking towards me, hands in his pocket. "Where did you go? I had to thank you for giving me a ride. We haven't even finished talking."
I text back.
"What's the matter Dean?" Cas inquiries cluelessly, "I thought you were putting Claire in bed?"
Dean glares at me from over Cas's shoulder. "I said 'I was angry,' that doesn't mean that I'm not still angry."
"Yeah Dean," she tells him, grinning and pulling her shimmering, blonde hair out from the heavy leather as Dean rolls up his sleeves, firmly grasping a trolly in each hand, "let's blow this Popsicle stand."
my favourite, the angel Cam, even when I knew they would all get brought back to life anyways. I was such a cry baby I was tearing up right now. Without him, my beloved roomie? I would be totally lost.
"Sure," Dean huffs, rubbing his smooth arms to try and keep warm, "But you're always so focused on apologising for me, what Sam did was
"Do you have a car seat?" he asks. I think for a moment.
Dean stands stoically, but his efforts to appear tough are slightly marred by the way he shivers in his flannel hot dog pyjama pants. His bare feet shift on the bitumen, and, as much as I wish I hadn't noticed, I could see his nips, which just made me wildly uncomfortable. I'm a firm believer in my policy that you can't meet someone and see their nipples on the same day.
"Well, you know," Dean pokes the flour, "Grief makes you do weird things. Your friend is in the hospital?"
"Dean?" I heard one of the girls say, probably Claire. "Why are you buying so many vegetables? You hate green things."
We both reached the checkout at the same time, and I nabbed the cashier right next to theirs. I snuck a couple of glances out from under my eyelashes.
"I know, I'm sorry Emma," the man in the trench coat replied mournfully. He glanced back at the man trailing behind them. Now this guy,  he was real rough and tumble, especially compared to the father. He wore a beaten, old, brown leather jacket over enough flannel to stock lumberjacks-r-us. He was actually kind of... rugged. Attractive. My face felt hot just looking at him, he looked like sex on a stick... A bow-legged stick. It was like, even alone, you could see everyone he had ever slept with. His strong brow was furrowed, and he slouched as he came to a halt behind the family, pushing his already full lips into a pout. I tried to focus on my phone, but my eyes kept drifting back up to him, and that tantalisingly close sweetener. Forget the guy, I needed that sugar.
"Here sweets," Dean told her, handing her a dinged-up mobile, "Text your dad, tell him we're leaving now and that we're heading to the store across the mall. You know? The one with the great pie?"
A groan murmurs through my head. This was just too much of a coincidence. They just had to be sharing a hospital room as well. I stare at him, my cake miraculously still held aloft. I set it down gently. He looked down at me. If it was possible, his face became even more contorted in anger.
"Kansas," Sam drawls, sharing a knowledgable look with Cas. "My hometown. I take it dad is still pretty furious?"
"Yeah," I tell him, gently, "Ok, bye Sam, I'll see you tomorrow."
Instead, he instructs me to lock it, and we leave it on the side of the road, it's not like anyone would steal it. Then we all pile into their massive seven-seater.
"Duh," I tell him gently, I add a tactful lie. "He talks about you all the time."
"Sorry," I squeak. I swallow, but the lump in my throat doesn't budge. "I just thought, I thought you wanted... Didn't you want Sam to forgive you?"
"Hold on," I interrupt, "I'm sorry, what? Sam, what's going on?"
"I'm sure he doesn't hold anything against you," I tell him, a little stunned. He had just sort of dumped a lot of info on me, and I wasn't quite sure what to do with it. He wasn't really looking at me either, more so at the cars passing by behind my shoulder.
"Hey," Claire protests softly, but she's already nodding off again. Cas closes his eyes, seemingly overwhelmed with love.  When Cas speaks again, it's nothing but a rough whisper, but in the sterile hospital, we don't have trouble hearing him.
"I'm so sorry, sir, but I really needed this sugar," I bawl, cradling it closer to my chest, "My friend is really hurt and the only thing I'm good at is baking so I need to make him something and I have everything but sugar so-"
I picked up my stuff and brushed off my jorts. "Thank you again," I mumbled. I hold up the offending product. "And sorry for stealing your sugar."
God, I was gonna do it.
He mimics my unsure expression, "I'm sure that would be alright for the ride to the motel, but you'll have to take Jack down to the car."
"Come back?" I blank. "Come back where?"
made him a cake?" Dean narrows his eyes at me. I put my hands up between us.
I've got to admit as I follow them to the checkout, he's a pretty great dad. I really misjudged him. I bite my lip. Surely I couldn't do this. They were so nice and yet-
We eat our breakfast, sitting around Sam's hospital bed. It feels good, it feels homely.
"Daddies!" Emma whined, leaning precariously to tug at the sleeve of Cas's trench-coat, and thoroughly interrupt the moment. "Emmy need go potty! Needs go potty!"
"Their name is Zee," Cas speaks like he thinks he's being helpful, but Dean just looks furious.
"Someone you thought you could talk to," it's a mere whisper, a puff of smoke dissipating in the night air. "I only know because you told me."
Now, sitting in the car with Cas, I feel light yards away from this morning. God, this had to be the longest day of my life, and an emotional roller coaster to boot. I slow to a gentle stop, flicking my indicator on as we wait for the light to turn green.
"So it's no good?" he sniggers.
And then I'm running. I'm not even really sure how it happened but then I hear Dean shout to tell Claire to watch Jack and heavy footsteps behind me so I can't
I knew basically nothing about Sam's home life, mostly because he never talked about it and I wasn't the type to pry. Basically, all I knew was what happened nowadays, which he was always pretty open about. I just assumed there was nothing for him to talk about.
"No, Dean," Cas leans down, wrapping an arm around his husband. A tear slips down Dean's cheek, and he presses his lips together, pushing his face into Cas's chest. "It's ok, I understand."
"Of course, uh, of course, sweetheart," he chokes slightly on the words, letting go of her hand. He watched blankly as she slunk over to her other parent, clutching his youngest daughter tightly in his arms.
"Absolutely Emmy," Dean tells her horsely, gesturing for her to join them. Claire, who had been pushing the trolly containing Jack, probably so she could show her dad where we had gone, stands awkwardly beside the baby. We made terribly uncomfortable eye contact. I look down to my knees instead, bleeding softly and skin peeling away. Sighing, I began to pick up my stuff. Only a little milk had leaked, and that was quickly solved when I tightened the lid. There were a few cracked eggs, but more intact than not, and everything else was fine.
"Dean," a gruff voice says from behind us. We both look over to Cas, standing silhouetted by the sun, the two carts on either side of him. "You never told me that."
"Language," Cas warns, "But yes."
I groaned, no wonder he thought I was stalking him. I take a seat, exhausted.
"You know I have quite a large family," the man called Cas said. His tone was weird like he was making a joke, but deadly serious at the same time. "You can rely on me, Dean. I know you are used to being alone, however, if this marriage is going to work-"
"The girls are getting tired, Dean," I heard him say, concern lacing his tone, "don't you think it's time to...?"
"Wow," I blow out a sigh, "I've never heard a story so romantic that involved prostitution."
My mouth falls open, "You didn't!"
He blinks. The fury returns in a moment, you can see it dribble down his face, starting at his creased brow and reaching his contorted lip. He pushes Cas away, and as he stumbles Dean approaches, glowering. We're inches apart, even through the chill I can feel waves of hot, molten venom rolling of his half-naked body. His arm raises and I finally notice how muscular he is, despite his leanness. His bicep bulges as his thick index finger finds my chest. I'm way too close to his bare nipples, they're right next to my face, I can't breathe.
"Cas?" He mumbles, he looks half asleep still. He finally notices his husband is carrying a small, sleeping child and hurries to open the door. Cas is allowed inside but I'm stopped at the thresh hold, where Jack is carefully snatched from my arms.
He responds. He texts exactly as a middle-aged man would; despite his cool guy aura, he was anything but.
"He seems to really like cars, what's that all about?" I ask, glancing up at the night sky, still a dull amber glow from the city lights.
Dean pokes his head out, and puts his hand up to halt our inquiries, "The operation was successful, you can come in now."
"Dean?" Claire says quietly. "Is it ok if I stay here with daddy?"
"You're not?" He stutters, mouth gaping as he realises what Cas had told him. "What could possibly come between Dean and
hurting Cas? Like when it's the anniversary of my mom's death and my brother is in hospital, fuckin' dying?" Dean laughs sarcastically, "Am I allowed to be a little moody then?"
"What happened to the car?" I whispered hoarsely. The light had gone green, I could see it reflected on his face.
"Are you kidding me?" He roared, he leaned down, and picked me up by my jacket, lifting me up to eye level. There was a wild, feral look in his eye, and I had no doubt that he could snap my neck without a single qualm at this moment. He shakes me on each word to emphasise his point. "What, are you some kind of sicko? You get your kicks stalking people? Stealing their fucking sugar?
me. I was just some freak whose friend was in the hospital.
"He's actually my brother's kid," he tells me matter-of-factly, adjusting the baby on his lap, "He died."
"Take the kids back to the motel if you want," Cas tells him sternly, "But this is their decision too."
The ride to the hospital is so cool, Dean plays classic rock on the stereo and we all sing along, myself a bit more hesitantly. Emma is the most into it, she grins and headbangs and plays air guitar. When we finally do arrive, she even groans as the music switches off.
"No, it's ok," I tell him, "I'll drive you."
While I had been having a moral crisis, the guy called Dean had slumped off, with "Cas", (it seemed like a strange name to me, like it was short for something), hesitantly following him. I ducked around the back and followed them parallel from the next aisle over. I reached the end a little after they did, peeking around the corner at where they stood, arms crossed, talking.
"Fucking sucks," Dean tells me harshly,  "My... My brother too."
"I take it you two weren't close?" I ask, backing into a space.
I squeeze my eyes shut. Oh. Jessica. Everything was most absolutely not fine.
"Oh?" I say, "Why is that?"
Cas clicks his tongue. "His father is a mechanic."
"So why would you guys want a baby?" I ask, glancing at the little suckler, as I turned into the motel parking lot, "Didn't you already have your hands pretty full?"
I don't think I've ever run this fast in my life, I can taste blood in the back of my throat. My bag of stuff swings wildly as my arms pump in time with my legs. Everything is burning and aching and stretching and pulling but I'm almost to the parking lot and I've got the sugar clutched to my chest so that's all that matters but then I've
As his emergency contact, I was tasked with bringing him any essentials, along with personal items. There was the initial shock that I was his emergency contact, rather than his girlfriend Jessica. Then I realised whose house he was staying at. Before I could stop it, I couldn't help but wonder if it was actually her, but she wasn't in the right condition to be contacted. As selfish as it is, it bothers something petty deep down inside me that I'll probably never know.
"He settled down... for you?" I ask him. I had no idea Dean so... he was an incredible guy, to say the least.
"Is that what I think it is?" He asks, reaching for it already. I'm busy opening his bag, trying to distract myself by organising his things. He cuts himself a hefty slice with the plastic knife I had packed and only really noticed me again when he had taken a bite. "So what's the matter?"
The other man, Dean, shook his head roughly. "You don't understand Cas," his voice was harsh and he put against the chest of this man, Cas. "I need to find it. If. If I don't..."
"To be fair, it was very entertaining rambling," I say, leaning against my car.
Dean swallowed. He broke eye contact to look down at the little girl.
"Dean, he is your brother, and he loves you. These marshmallows do not mean anything to him, not when you're there." The baby fussed for a moment, but he fell silent when Cas stroked his downy head with a massive hand.
"It has been a while," Cas steps forward, shoes tapping against the tiles. "I'm sorry about Dean. He was so upset this afternoon, I figured he was over it. Cried himself out so to speak."
"Hey!" Sam interrupts, but he sits up too fast and hacks out a cough instead. We all freeze, but he swallows it down, until his eyes flood with tears.
"You can talk to Uncle Sam in a minute, but we need to talk alone," Dean tells them gruffly. Cas smiles encouragingly and ushers the kids out, the bags of fast food they had brought swing wildly. I give them both a thumbs up and shut the door behind me.
"Have fun finding an Uber with a car seat," he mumbles bitterly, and then he's left.
"Do you think they're gonna argue?" I ask Cas as he coos at Jack.
He looks down at the baby dozing on his lap. "His father gave him a car, for his twenty-fifth birthday, a 1967 Chevy Impala. Dean loved the Impala, ever since he was a child. It was something they had both loved, actually. We had our first kiss in that car." He cleared his throat.
"John took the Impala back the night we got married." Cas's voice was thick and raspy. He buried his face in his baby's downy hair.
"Met how?" this time Sam is the one to interrupt, I feel like my cheeks are on fire. I'm really going to have to tell him about the botched burglary attempt.
"Who are you," he says, forcing the words through clenched teeth, "To tell me what I want."
"No, he doesn't..." He says, his voice unsure. He clears his throat, eyes darting down. "We didn't end up finding the marshmallows."
"I've got family like that," I tell him, nodding solemnly. We both had an ex-con parent too, this baby was like a tiny me. I followed him to his room. "Will Dean be angry when you go in?"
"-won't mind, Dean, I'm sure. He just wants you to be there for him, a marshmallow brand will not prove-" his partner cut him off.
"We're not ganging up on you," Cas says gruffly, "I'm your husband, I want whats best for you. Zee is just an observer, and even they can see what's going on. You're feeling alone because you keep pushing him away Dean. Sure he moved, but that never had to be an ending. He's your brother. He loves you."
"Dean..." Cas approaches like the taller man is a skittish horse, and he's a 14 year old white girl, "I'm... I'm sorry..."
Milk, eggs, cocoa powder and-
Dean's mouth slams shut, his face contorting wildly in anger. He throws his head back and groans, squeezing his head between his hands. I glance at Cas. His expression seems so impartial but his lip has the slightest quiver.
"Dean, did you
"I understand that," Sam assures him, before peeking out from his overgrown hair. "I wish you guys had invited me to your wedding though."
"Huh?" I raise my eyebrows, "I thought we were done."
This was my least favourite recipe actually, but my roommate loves it. He's kind of a health freak, so this little moist Black Forest cake, with berries and cherries and shit is right up his alley, as it is by far the healthiest thing I make. I tried it as an experiment only, but he tried it once and was kind of hooked. "Better than sex," he once told me, jokingly I assume, but still grabbing a slice. It was way too bitter to me, too much cacao, too many raspberries and cherries, heavy with that artificial flavour protein bars have; I almost never made it at all. However, circumstances. They change. It didn't seem like that much effort anymore.
and oh dear, oh lord, I am an evil sugar bandit and he is going to catch me and take me to
When I close the door, I find Cas is waiting for me.
"Nah," he tells me, "Keep it."
Cas put a hand on the leather-clad shoulder, the corner of his lips gently tipping up. He leans closer to kiss his cheek again, Dean tilting his head so their lips meet instead. It's brief, but sweet, and so scorching I have to avert my eyes in shame.
Dean looks away, his mouth set in a grim line, but his gaze grows soft when he looks into the eyes of his husband. "I guess... it's been a while since we last saw him."
"Alright," Dean mutters, fussing with Jack's tiny jumpsuit. He doesn't look up until Cas rounds the corner, and Claire is squirming from where she sat in the other trolly from boredom, or so I thought. Dean takes off his jacket, draping it around the small girl's shoulders. "You wanna get out of here Claire-Bear?"
I nudge the door ajar, right as someone on the other side throws it open and barges in. "No, you know what? Screw you, Sam!" The figure shouts, bumping into me. For the second time today, flailing wildly to keep the cake safe, I'm knocked to the ground by the man named Dean.
Sam's face glazes over. "You should text me later. When you get home. Drive safe, okay Zee?"
"Can't you just hold him?" I suggest.
I gulped. So they were looking for something too. However.... If they were looking for something specific, they would probably hang around for a while. If they were wandering around looking, maybe they wouldn't be paying much attention to their cart. Maybe.... Maybe I could grab the sugar from their cart without them noticing. My stomach squirmed. Could I really do that? To such a happy little family? Normally? No, absolutely not, but... there were extenuating circumstances here. It was the one thing he had asked for, I couldn't let him down.
I glance up at him through my eyelashes, where he seemed to be quite happily simultaneously eating and cutting himself another slice.
"Zee," Sam smiles, bright, if bittersweet, but it falls when he sees my face, "Oh, what's wrong?"
"I get you're Sam's fancy little roommate, but I don't know you, and I'm not comfortable with you holding my baby," he hisses. The door is slammed in my face.
They squeal their enthusiastic consent, as Cas lowers baby Jack into the bright red plastic seat, before hoisting the girls into the giant metal mesh box. Jack stirs again, but quick as a flash Cas had whipped out a dummy from a trench coat pocket and put it in the baby's mewling mouth. He gave Dean a look and they moved on. I followed, trying to be as inconspicuous as I possibly could in the brightly coloured supermarket. I kept my phone out, so I could maintain my cover story of aimlessly wandering while I scrolled. All I needed was one opening, I could take the sugar and leave.
"I know, I know," Dean sighs again, and steps closer. I see their hands touch, fingers intertwining. "But you're not close with any of them like I am with Sammy, I... I love you but I don't think you'd get it."
Of course, baking is not an exact science, and so I'm terrified I'll get it wrong. Baking may be my only talent, but sometimes I am not very good at it. Still, after a lot of mixing, a little greasing and pouring and one smooth motion into the oven, I'm left alone with my thoughts again.
"You make a good point," he ponders,  "I'll have to ask Dean about that."
All I can do is whimper softly. I've been stunned into silence. The door opens and Cas steps out. "Dean?
We both jump as a loud honk sounds behind us. I glance back at the massive four-wheel drive waiting for me to go, and Claire shifting sleepily in the back seat. Sheepishly, I pressed my foot down on the pedal and we eased across the intersection.
"Cas?" Says a voice from behind him, "Are you for real?"
"Huh?" I blank, my arms falling limply.
I blink. Not exactly unexpected.
Sam looked at the older man bashfully. "Thanks, Cas."
"Well," he begins, "At first we both thought it was a one-time thing, but spending so much time together it was bound to happen again. Then, my ex-wife Amelia had a drug overdose of all things, she'd apparently been getting high on hallucinogens for months. I had to take care of my daughter full time now, so I found a house, picked her up from Illinois, and accepted that I'd only see Dean when, or if, he decided to drop in. However, before I could sign the lease he told me there was no way I was raising her alone, and we moved into his house in Kansas instead."
His words take Cas aback, and he glances at me. I stare back, guilty and miserable, I feel like his conversational mistress.
"I suppose so," he continues after think, grinning roguishly, "I doubt John would have been so eagre to commander the Impala if he was aware what we did in the back seat that night alone."
"Because Dean is very impertinent," I look behind me to see Cas, Sam's brother in law I suppose, in the doorway with Jack in his arms. The baby has stopped crying, but his cheeks were still tinged pink.
"The kids are asleep?" My face scrunches in confusion. Cas looks at me, unamused.
To my surprise, trench-coat man let go of the younger girl, Emma, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. A gap-toothed smile lit up her tiny little face, and she scrabbled to her older sister to tug on her hand.
My heart, which had been beating so fast, stopped. It was so close, I could reach out and grab it if I wanted to. If I could move.
"It is pretty old," I say nervously. Dean tries to explain what the issue is as Cas hovers, Jack in his arms, but I don't understand any of it. "You can fix it though, right?"
It feels like family.
"They're right though, Dean." Cas has his hands in his pockets, and his shoes crunch against the gravel as he takes a step towards him. He shrugs off his coat, and wraps it around Deans's shoulders.
"You don't understand, Ocean's 4'11," he tells me emphatically, shaking his head. "I was so mad at him, for leaving us. For leaving me. My brother could be dead right now, and I... I didn't even invite him to my wedding."
"Can we have a second? Please?" the words are barely out of my mouth before Cas has nodded and closed the door behind him.
Cas groans lovingly, pulling away to scoop the baby girl up as she giggles, a fat, little fist going to her mouth.
I set the cake down on his bedside table, and his eyes light up.
it and I-
Sam, because he thought he was too good for the rest of us, and my dad won't even talk to me because I got married to you!"
Another man rounded the corner, grumbling under his breath. He was just as tall as the first one, maybe taller, and he was pushing a shopping car piled higher than my chest, mostly assorted junk from other stores, with a thin layer of assorted food on the top. There. Right there. Resting tantalisingly on the side of their Olympus of junk. My chest expanded helplessly, watching as the two men and the kids passed with a perfect, sunshine yellow packet of pristine, organic, raw sugar.
And grab it.
"What about when
Padding over to our lounge room, I notice he never even turned his laptop off. I save his work, bookmarks his tabs and switch it off. It doesn't feel ok to sink into our couch, it doesn't feel ok to relax at all. Instead, I turn on the TV and instantly it's blaring, with words like
I blow the hair out of my face.
I couldn't help the little sigh that puffed out in relief. It was so cold in this stupid place I could see it in the still air. Who'd have thunk it, this place was freezing. I'd have killed for another jacket, or two. As it was, I pulled the one I had on closer to my chest and soldiered on.
"Bye Zee," he tells me.
I text Dean,
"That's ok, small thief," Cas tells me, lifting his head from where it rested on his lovers. He lowered it and hugged him tighter. "Did you really leave our kids alone to chase after someone who had stolen a packet of sugar?"
"Yeah," I sniffle, swallowing the snot, dripping down the back of my throat. "He had a really bad accident."
"We had to give them some sugar," Cas interjects before I can finish. I quickly rearrange my features into calm, believable expression. Cas and I share a little secret smile.
Dean growls raggedly, but the frustration just becomes urgency. He puts his arms out, reaching, imploring. "Of course not Cas, I fucking
Tumble to the ground, a massive weight on top of me, yelling furiously.
He seemed kind of. Normal. I wondered how much he knew, how much they had told him. He had been awake for a couple of hours now, surely...? Except, he just seemed so oblivious.
"In my defence, it's really bitter," I admit. Dean's face stills, the corner of his lips quirk up, and finally, they draw back to reveal his perfect white teeth as he laughs. Even Cas cracks a grin from over Deans's shoulder.
Time slowed. I could hear my heartbeat, in sync with his footsteps behind me. Everything seems to echo and multiply, reverberating through my skull. The tip of the trolly glides past me. Claire comes into sight, distracted by Dean's phone, then Jack, then Dean, looking ahead at his kids. He was dragging the food trolly behind him, and... and..... The brightest flash of yellow. I reach out-
abandoned me. My mom when she freaking
"I don't think so," Cas tells me, still in his baby voice. "Dean is prepared to admit culpability, and Sam doesn't hold grudges like that. I'm sure they'll be fine."
"We're your
"It's not like that Dean," he speaks softly, his words like honey encased in stone. "I'm just trying to make sure you don't upset anyone. Sometimes it doesn't seem like you don't care who you hurt."
"No, it's fine," Cas sighs hoarsely, stroking Claire's blonde locks with one hand and settling Jack with the other.  "He's just been lonely since the wedding, he lost his job at the garage because John isn't speaking to him, he's still mad at you, he's basically just stuck with the kids all day."
I stifle my laughter with one hand, and Cas grins dopily. I'm dying to know more, so the second I can manage, I ask him, "So what happened after that?"
"My own sake?" Dean throws his hands up, and finally steps away. He has to speak through chattering teeth. "You're ridiculous."
"Claire! Claire! Daddy says if we get a big boy cart, daddy will push us around!! Come on!" The eldest's face broke into a smile as well, and they rushed off down the aisle, skidding on the smooth flooring. The darker man smiles to himself, cradling the baby closer to his chest. Now that I considered it, it was kind of weird that the kids were so tired but he didn't have any food, unless... I press myself against the shelving, trying to make myself as small as possible as he cautiously approached the other man, kissing him gently on the cheek.
Dean hasn’t been sleeping long. His body’s been healed (by Cas) after being beat to a pulp (by Cas), but adrenaline is still thrumming under his skin. They’re catching a couple hours rest before going after the final piece of the trials puzzle. Kevin is curled up in a loveseat under five blankets, streaming a cooking show on Sam’s tablet and glaring when Dean tries to wrench it out of his hands. Sam is fighting off a fever in bed and pretending he’s fine. They’re all just so
Dean raises his dream beer in acknowledgement. “But all the humans I know are oh-for-two, most on their third or fourth relationships with a trail of side pieces scattered behind them in the wind?”
Dean whispers, “If you ever want to see a grown man blush, ask Sam about how he lost his virginity in a church.”
“Shit, Sam,” Dean finally says. The key won’t fit in the door—it’s frozen solid. Dean jimmies the window open instead and they tumble inside. Sam turns on the shower to heat up the room and gathers every blanket available to cover the air leaking through the window. “You probably shouldn’t go around publicizing that.”
“It’s for the honor roll banquet.” Sam flops down on the motel couch — not itchy or filled with bedbugs, which counts as upscale for their family. “I’m not going, you just have to sign to acknowledge it.”
wouldn’t have remembered. You could’ve let
“Well,” Castiel says, strangled. “That’s new.”
“The brunette right? It’s not the redhead, you barely talked to her. The brunette looks like a bookworm like you. Did you warm her up with famous quotes from old dead guys? C’mon, man, it’s my duty as a big brother to celebrate this moment with you. Did you pop
Sam comes all over the guy’s hand, who huffs into Sam’s mouth, rubbing desperately against him for friction. Sam helps the poor guy out, and wraps a hand around his cock. It barely takes two pumps before he’s coming too — all over Sam’s shirt.
. “This one is better for the environment,” Castiel fibs.
Castiel wakes unsettled. The tendrils of a dream claw at the edge of his memory; a flash of skin, the color blue, the sensation of photos flickering by in an album. He rubs his face and goes to shower. He has no need to, but it’s a human coping mechanism he’s come to appreciate lately.
lets them both know that he’s speaking from a place of childhood. He’s parroting John Winchester, the most repressed hedonite since John Calvin.
Castiel doesn’t go for physical purposes, though he’d be fibbing if he said he hasn’t considered it. He goes to talk — when the Dean Winchester on Earth won’t. When he clams up, emotions locked away in a tidy place where no one has access to poke around; least of all Castiel, who ranks just below Sam (blood ties) and Bobby (childhood ties) in terms of confiance. It frustrates him to witness Dean categorically refuse to put feelings into human language when he can do it so easily. It’s infinitely harder for Castiel to translate neurons and shared synapses across galaxies and centuries into
that it’s hard to break the habit.
He reaches for Cas, but Cas shakes his head. Lays down beside Dean instead. “I can’t— if I lose control, they’ll hear. I’m barely keeping them out now.”
Even if Cas had been listening the whole time.
Dean pinches his nose. But the explosion Castiel braces himself for never comes.
“Don’t be so heartless.”
Dean wasn’t lying. He wanted Sam to have a normal life. And then when Sam threw himself into the cage, Dean figured the least he could do was honor Sam’s last fucking request of him.
Except Dean kicked Cas out of his home, friendless and nameless, to fend for himself in the bitter cruel human world. So maybe Dean can do this one fucking thing for Cas. Maybe he can be a human punching bag just one more time.
Something twists in Dean’s stomach. He pushes that aside until later, because they’ve got bigger worries now. “Listen man, I’m glad to see you, but first things first. You scared the hell out of me. What’s going on, are you on the run?”
“That,” Castiel says primly, skipping his remaining tile over a couple red ones — just to keep his dignity while he covertly watches the Dean reading comics: so intent on the storyline that his brow has furrowed — “has never been true.”
fight,” she whispers, to Castiel’s horror. As Dean tries to strangle himself with the bedsheets, she adds, “Super normal.”
and not
“Dean?” Castiel tries. He’s trapped in the passenger seat by Dean’s arm.
Sometimes Castiel disappears to a place in his head. It’s in another dimension, technically, where time both exists and doesn’t exist, but this is difficult to verbalize into human speech and when he tries, he can see Sam’s brain start to leak out of his ears.
“One that I believe you’re familiar with.”
Dean’s eyes widen. He sinks to the ground. Runs his hands from Castiel’s knees up to his waist. He rests his hand over the scars on Castiel’s chest where the angel tablet once hid.
Castiel redirects Dean’s hand to a pale blue bottle instead. Their fingers brush. Dean, predictably, jerks away and tosses the bottle into the empty cart he insisted on taking because
Dean shrugs. Makes a move on the checkerboard — red, two jumps. “King me.”
Dean’s eyes flutter closed as Castiel works his hand into Dean’s jeans. He slides them together, slowly, the spit from Dean’s mouth slick on his hand. Dean breathes, “I might anyway.”
Castiel doesn’t have a ton of experience in kissing comma human. He’s only kissed two people, excluding Dean. But he does have experience kissing thousands of iterations of Dean Winchesters, so he could reasonably claim to be an expert in kissing Dean.
Cas blinks at the illuminated sign. “Here?”
So who’s to say kissing this boy isn’t okay? Maybe Sam’s actually protecting this kid from getting the shit stomped out of him. Most guys who look like Sam wouldn’t be nearly so calm about the way he’s pressing Sam against the wall, dick hard against Sam’s thigh.
His heart already feels bruised as he reaches over to adjust the sleeves of Cas’ shirt. He hitches up a smile that feels like barbed wire. “Go get ’em, tiger.”
Dean does a quick check for security cameras, then closes the doors. There’s only a few kneeling pews. One narrow stained glass window. A simplistic wood cross. It looks like the chapel in the hospital where Dean prayed open-call for any angels to save his brother.
This treatise on gender semantics sounds reductive to Castiel’s ears, but Dean is flushing again in a way that is not related to the busted A/C. He hands off the ziploc full of quarters to Castiel with a murmured, “Take care of this,” and follows the middle aged dimpled beauty to the other side of the laundromat.
Cas is staring at Dean insistently. He looks young and soft beneath the white scrubs of the sanitarium. His usual trench coat engulfs him. Without the suit, he doesn’t look anything like the angry god that slaughtered a hundred angels above and hundreds more humans below.
Dean shrugs. “You healed me.”
“All right,” Sam says, as the meds kick in and Dean is visibly dropping off, “I’m gonna check out the cafeteria situation.” He punches Dean’s shoulder lightly, and takes off.
“Get on your knees,” says Cas.
Every morning Castiel wakes the same way: at dawn, heart in throat.
A couple Deans glance up at them, then immediately lose interest. There’s a game of pickup football happening nearby.
Dean takes away Castiel’s driving privileges for a month. Castiel, shaken for reasons he can’t verbalize to Dean, is grateful. He slides into the passenger seat, clutches the handle. He wishes for the first time that John Winchester could have waited to imprint upon a car after the seatbelt law of 1968.
“Dean,” he says.
“Or the predilection of angels.” There’s a lilt in the way
Castiel breaks the kiss roughly. Dean stares at him, glass green gaze wide, lips parted, cheeks flushed.
And why wouldn’t he be? An angel stuffed into an unwieldy vessel, standing in a man-made kitchen like he belongs. Of course Dean feels on edge. He should be around other humans — human women — to smooth the ragged edges of his wants and needs.
There’s a lump stuck in his throat. Like pulling at the clog in a sink. Pressure rising. Once you pull it free, who knows what will follow.
“What’s going on with you, man?” Dean asks over the roar of the industrial air conditioner, studying an endless row of shampoo bottles. He picks a boring grey one that makes Castiel itchy in a way he can’t explain. “You’ve been acting squirrelly for days.”
He pushes that thought away and leans against the railing. Dean can tell by the way Cas’ eyes are tracking the sightlines that he’s perturbed by the lack of windows. Once a warrior, always a warrior.
Sam startles as the guy’s long fingers slide up his neck. He kisses Sam experimentally, eyes half-lidded by judging Sam’s reaction.
Cas pauses, then continues: “I believed your desires to be like the fireman crush. Something to imagine. But nothing to act upon.” He looks over, sharply. “Unless I was mistaken?”
Dean blinks. He coughs. He lets his gaze wander across the endless versions of himself spread across the unending edges of space. He’s still in his hospital gown, which is— interesting.
His eyes drop automatically. He’s just the worst liar. Angels aren’t built for it. Dean wonders if Lucifer became so mutilated by forcing himself to lie over and over until he was unrecognizable.
Dean meets Castiel’s gaze over the nurse’s head. Dark circles still smudge beneath his eyes, but the glass-green is brighter than usual. He doesn’t look away.
“I haven’t. I never did. Possibly a version of myself in the future does. But I swear to you that I have not.”
He doesn’t look anything like the raging warrior whom Dean shouted at Death to, “Kill him,
Heart pounding, he climbs the steps.
Dean asks, “So how many of these have you fucked?”
like you fit in, there’s less chance of you being attacked. Dean doesn’t care what lies under the surface. Just if on paper you’re a good citizen.
“Necrophilia I think does rank slightly below non consensual relations.” Cas adds, at the look on Dean’s face, “But I did not have relations with her. Or if I had, they would have been consensual.”
It’s something Sam has never questioned. Just like he’s known since before he could speak that there were monsters out there, because his dad said so, he never doubted that there was a God and angels up there because his mom said so.
, wrote a scrawny Irish poet who Castiel once shielded from censure. The phrase resonated with him at the time, even though he couldn’t relate.
The chapel plunges into darkness.
His entire life he’s dropped to his knees and begged for Sam’s life. For his mom’s, his dad’s, every hunter that’s ever been more than a casual friend.
This does not bother Castiel, because Dean is always grumpy in the morning. Eye contact is something he doesn’t expect until well after lunch. It’s an idiosyncrasy that Castiel catalogues away into the endless list of
Cas says, “I heard you.”
Dean is standing very close.
, but the heat of the day clings to the bunker’s concrete walls and his eyes drift shut to the image of Dean’s eyes sparkling at the laundromat woman. What would it be like to be the object of someone’s blatant affection? Castiel wonders if he’d even be able to recognize it, should it ever be directed his way.
“Man’s gotta have a little private time.”
Castiel wakes late.
Dean sits straight up in bed, choking, hand flailing out.
Dean licks his lips. The buzz from the roaring air conditioner clashes with the scuff of athletic shoes in the gym and the reverb from the amps, or maybe it’s just his heart pounding? The core tenets of hunting are a) never reveal your true name b) never reveal your true self and c) never let anyone in close to you, and Dean is about to betray all three. Check, check, and check. Signing his death warrant with a cursive flourish, like he used to sign Sam’s school forms.
Castiel opens the door. The bickering stops; the Winchesters’ eyes dropping to Castiel’s only piece of clothing: threadbare boxers. Sam grimaces and looks away. Dean’s face tightens, a flush spreading across his cheekbones.
“Sure,” says Dean after a beat.
Their eyes meet. Uncontrollable laughter bursts out of Castiel, and then Dean. Castiel’s cock slips out of his mouth and he gets to his feet, pulling Castiel in close.
So he goes to talk.
“Sure, man.” Dean sits down on the floor, back against the wall. The thin grey-blue carpet could belong to every church he ever dragged Sam to as a kid. “This is ballsy.”
Sam grabs a towel and strips down to his boxers. He climbs into the shower with the bathroom door still open — the room still needs to heat up. It’s easier to say to Dean from on the other side of the shower curtain, shouting over the spray: “I thought you said people were sheep who couldn’t think for themselves.”
The nurse hides a smile. She efficiently prods at wires and gadgets stuck onto various parts of Dean’s body, and beckons Castiel closer as she exits.
Sam doesn’t know what to think. Homosexuality’s a sin, obviously, but so is murder and his dad and Dean do that all the time. Sam’s always justified this as a loophole, seeing as they’re stopping
“After all,” Cas continues, blithely skipping pieces across the board, unaware that Dean is having a fucking heart attack or something across the table, “union between humans is commanded by God. Perhaps at the basest level, I was fulfilling my path as a human.”
“I am sorry.”
“Cas,” Dean rumbles. He sounds wrecked. “Cas, I’m —”
Sam thinks Dean has no faith. He’s told him as much, over the years, like every time they’ve worked a case involving a priest or churchyard, or when Dean refuses to beg for Cas to pretty please shake his dumb ass back down to Earth.
“What is this shit?” Dean asks when Sam hands him a wrinkled form.
Not one pushed him away.
“Then take me back to the Gas N Sip.”
Now it’s Castiel’s turn to pretend to study the board. He rests a hand on his one remaining piece. It’s poised between two threatening pieces: trapped. Alone.
“Fucking figures,” Dean mutters.
“Honor roll — wait, Sam.” Dean lays aside the shotgun he’s cleaning, a grin spreading across his face. “Are you a
“Your turn to be the big brother,” Castiel manages. Why is his heart pounding?
“You say that every time too. You never do.”
Dean signs the form with a flourishing scrawl — his cursive D’s resemble J’s enough that so far no one has noticed that it’s a fifteen-year-old boy and not his dad signing Sam’s forms — and hauls Sam up by his collar. “C’mon. We’re going shopping.”
“Nothing about us,” says Sam, shouldering into the room with three styrofoam cups of coffee, “is either of those things. Did you guys see the amount of people in the waiting room? Appalling. The lack of funding in this country is embarrassing.”
Curled up on the organ bench, beneath his trench coat, is Cas. Dean doesn’t see the angel tablet anywhere, but right now he doesn’t care enough to ask.
“And yet you choose a solitary activity.”
Sam’s face sours over half a grapefruit. Dean, being Dean, pretends not to understand.
Sam pulls the curtain shut again. He closes his eyes under the spray. Dean turns on the sink to brush his teeth, momentarily shocking Sam out of his skin when the water turns hot-cold-hot.
“What the hell are you doing, man? You’re on the run from the feather law, it’s not safe here!”
“She was a nice lady,” Cas says. He skips his piece across the Sorry! board. “Your move.”
Dean splutters.
It’s important to him that Dean know this: as absurd as it is to assure a lover that you have not fucked them, as of yet, in the present, but Dean is not an ordinary man. He can and will harbor jealousy toward anyone, for any manner of perceived infraction, including himself.
The sun is already high in the horizon. He knows this by the heat settled low on the floor, just as he knows, instinctively, that Dean has already been up for hours, with Sam not far behind. It’s testament to how Castiel’s mind has been infiltrated by human superstition and custom that he feels shame about this. His body needed rest; there is nothing shameful about that. But there is no escaping the midwest sensibility of the Winchester brothers who grew up soaked in the Puritan flogging of John Winchester.
“You’re using your professor voice again. What, did there actually used to be a cat demon that ate peoples’ tongues?”
Castiel breathes in; closes his eyes. Pulls the covers tight around himself, the way he used to take catnaps on Orion during construction of the Andromeda galaxy.
He’s glad he can’t see Dean’s face. It’ll kill him if his brother, who loves him best and doesn’t even pay attention when the pastor’s preaching, says yes.
No one ever answered.
“You and Sam being the ‘death’ part.”
It’s unsettling being back here with Dean: both of them consciously in this vacuum of desire Castiel has created. The back of his skull itches; like Dean has reached directly into his soul and yanked out with his hands.
Sam shrugs and leans into the kiss. It feels good; and it’s warming him up. And he’s pleased by the attention. Aside from Amy the kitsune, he’s never kissed anyone. He’s definitely never had someone else’s hand jerking him off roughly before, and isn’t
The same drawl. The same elongation of the middle vowel. Castiel had no opinion on his name until Dean Winchester put it into human speech. Now, his pulse reacts to it. Now, he cares about the way it sits on Dean’s tongue.
Dean says hastily, “You know I wanted to be a fireman when I was a kid?”
“Morning,” Dean grunts, not meeting Castiel’s eye.
“I believe he thought he was doing it for your benefit.” Cas finishes the game, winning by a landslide. There’s that patented head tilt: the one that makes Dean feel like he’s under a microscope. “Is it not pleasurable?”
It’s not that Dean isn’t a morning person.
means maybe making out a little with a lanky boy who’s just as cute as his sister.
Dean fidgets as he drops Castiel off at the Gas n Sip. He reaches over to lock the door when Castiel tries to get out.
They laugh together, a little embarrassed, since neither of them considered they’ll have to show their faces upstairs again. Sam trades shirts with the guy, who can hide the stain under many layers. Sam zips the broken clasp of his jacket halfway, hoping Dean won’t notice the color change of his pullover.
“Yes,” says Cas, “because of your crush on the fireman who carried you and Sam out of your burning house.”
He’s pretending to sleep in the driver’s seat when Cas re-emerges from the house not hours later. Disappointment reads all over his face, and hope blossoms in Dean’s chest.
There’s footsteps on the other side of the door. In one motion, Castiel pushes Dean down to his knees on the cushions. Dean folds his hands on the railing and bows his head. An older man with a bible tucked against his chest shuffles in. He blinks at the darkness, but then moves toward the front pew. Castiel kneels beside Dean for verisimilitude, neck crawling at the damp smell of sex and sweat inside the chapel, but perhaps the old man’s olfactory senses are dulled enough that he won’t notice.
“Great.”
Sam says this with a smile, so Castiel knows it’s a joke  — but he jumps guiltily all the same.
“Yes, please,” says Castiel, at the same time that Dean says, “Jesus god no, just blast me with it already.”
“ ‘Handsome’ is for men that aren’t necessarily attractive, but have big arms and can like, chop wood,” the woman continues, smiling at Dean in a way that makes Castiel’s kidney hurt. “ ‘Pretty’ is attractive that no one can deny.”
Dean says, “Okay,
“Sure. Makes sense. The freak upstairs likes to watch the people downstairs get
Their other selves are slowing: Dean’s hand sliding up Castiel’s shoulder, Castiel’s hand branded across the small of Dean’s back.
He retreats to his bedroom. Closes the door, locks it, climbs back into bed fully dressed. He’s exhausted again. He never suspected, when he used to gaze down at Earth, that most fatigue was mental instead of physical. He saw humans’ frail bodies collapsing onto the ground of hunger, injury, dehydration — but he never considered heartbreak as a viable factor.
“What?” says Sam from the doorway, a half-eaten sandwich in hand. “Boyf— I was gone ten minutes!”
Dean swallows. The sound echoes. “Even about Rhonda Hurley?”
“Morning,” Dean rasps as usual to Castiel as he enters the kitchen, shoulders hunched. Castiel nods in return, going to the coffee maker. It’s nearly empty, but he doesn’t trust his hands this morning to make more, so he drinks the dregs.
It warms Dean that Cas notices this. It’s a very human thing to notice. Most immortals, who rarely need to think about things like escape or dying, view architectural structure as just another type of aesthetic. The fact that Cas now has to consider blood and guts and life and death—
Castiel doesn’t hesitate. He slaps a hand onto Dean’s forehead.
Dean knows well enough by now not to say,
It’s awkward and embarrassing and sits between them like a fart in church. Cas played God and lord to Dean and played him for the fool and broke his brother’s head — and then, like that wasn’t enough, lost his own head and got married to some Weetbix prairie whore who found him in a river.
“I’m sorry.”
Cas jerks his chin. Dean follows his gaze to the left side of the bed, where Dean is curled up around his pillow, snoring.
The only thing Dean insists upon is Sunday school every week. The nearest church to whatever motel or squat they’re inhabiting — come hell or high water, Sam is in that sanctuary at 11am. When he was younger, Sam thought Dean was concerned about their immortal souls and all the killing they did week after week. They aren’t Catholic, so they don’t confess these obvious sins every week. But now that Dean’s in high school and going on hunts with John besides, he spends most of the service snoring with his head cradled against the pew.
“It’s good to have a routine, Sammy,” says Dean, eyes closed. His chest rises and falls under the leather jacket he stole off a drunk a few towns back. “Good to have community.”
Fake Dean 790 told him,
Castiel knows a thing or two about irrevocable actions: once you put something into existence, you can never tie it back.
, Sam would say, while Dean gags in the background). Dean looks up; hands not pausing. “Hey, Cas.”
“That I want you to fuck me?”
“Took twelve damn years to get you naked.” He grumbles, Dean’s hands are already slipping under the edge of the boxers Cas is wearing, he’s trying to focus past how hot it is that Cas is wearing
They stand on the precipice and stare into the yawning chasm.
Jack nods sagely, “If you left now I believe Dean would break into heaven… again.” Cas chuckles at the thought, Dean Winchester standing before the throne with nothing but a GED and Give ‘em hell attitude.
Cas looks down, this is too much, there’s too much to say, and he feels like if Dean keeps looking at him like that—
In the months they’ve been open she became nearly professional at subverting most of their clientele’s advancements on the attractive, if grumpy, owner of their little startup.
"Okay?" Sam keeps his voice soft; carefully fishing shattered porcelain out of the sink, Dean’s hand is starting to bleed onto the counter. "I mean, not to downplay things but like, he's done that before Dean, he's a pretty selfless guy."
, or I will be.” He leans his head on the meat of his palms and lets out a shuddering breath. “Oh shit fuck. That just happened.”
“Song of Songs again?” Dean asks casually, though his eyes are dark, something crossing his face that Cas isn’t sure he could name if he tried.
“No.”
“Nah, I think I’ll stay actually,.” Dean says, his stance familiar and stubborn green eyes fierce, swaying very slightly. All the signs scream that the he’s spoiling for a fight,
Our fearless leader
, his angel
No one talks about Christmas Eve, the way Dean stood in his room in shock until Sam came looking for him. The way he let his brother wrap his arms around him while he sobbed soundlessly into his hands. How he cried until there were no more tears, Sam didn’t ask what happened, he just sat next to him.
Jack is there, outside the door, his hair slick with rain and grime, face young and ageless and uncharacteristically serious. A crumpled, human sized bundle held tightly in his arms. He pushed past them wordlessly, disappearing into Castiel's untouched room, leaving black sludgy footprints where he walked.
He presses his thumb down on his 60 day chip until it bruises.
Dean shrugs guiltily, “Early start,” His voice cracks, he clears his throat twice, Cas is now more than six feet away.
Cas listens, and tries to ignore the way his hand stays comfortingly on his knee, wishing there was a way he could wrap himself in the voice of Dean Winchester and just stay there until he felt like himself again,
“So… how’d it go with Cas?”
“What?”
He barely manages to bite off a particularly potent string of words, Cas eyes him and clears his throat, Dean tries not to sigh just as deeply.
“Why did you go after Dean Winchester?”
Erin opens up after that, talks while they paint the walls of the coffee shop that closed, she brings leftovers and meals when they have to work all day; shoving them casually at Dean, telling him her mom’s the best cook in Kansas. After Dean tries her pie, he’s likely to believe her.
The front door bangs open; they hear Sam whistling and humming over the headphones. He’s been in a constant, fantastic mood since he and Cas started working on his Witching.
"No Sam. It's not— He... he said some things,"
an Angel of the Lord?” Sam is not a prude, but this… a lot.
Honestly though, he's been wrong a lot lately: he wouldn’t have guessed Jack would make such a kind god, but here he is sitting at their table, discussing his ideas on renovating heaven with Cas.
“Sam already knows, pretty sure Eileen would give us a high five.” Dean sneezes again, taking the duffel from the angel, already making his way down the hallway, Cas follows quietly. “I gotta teach you some sexier words.”
“Our first meeting.” Cas starts, after a long moment, in which Dean does a poor job of hiding his impatience. “Was in the pit, I disobeyed orders,” Dean is already confused, Cas continues. “I was— I was supposed to rescue you and deliver you back to earth to fulfill your purpose. That was it, I was never supposed to mark you.”
Dean clicks his tongue; shakes his head in mock disappointment, more confident than his racing heart, “Ah, looks like you were actually more concerned that your big, macho, eldest might be into
“I… I love you Cas.”
"So?" His voice pettish, annoyed, "I do the same shit for you."

, I mean,
It did all sound suspiciously on-brand for Castiel, stupid sonofabitch never knew how to make his life easier.
Dean takes his silence nervously, reacting in the most positive way he knows to express concern,
Dean nods soundlessly. Cas turns; John’s eyes are narrow and fixed on the two men in front of him.
“Teasing, teasing. Let me have my fun, I wouldn’t dare play with your toys without permission.” He sighs dramatically. “Upstairs it’s all
Cas’ familiar trench slides off the bed; landing with an oddly solid thump. Dean swipes it from the floor groaning all along, rifling curiously through the pockets. His unbroken fingers stumble upon a piece of worn plastic, a cassette tape and familiar writing.

Cas steps close, pushing into his space, his knees on either side of Dean’s, hands firm at his waist, steadying, stilling the franticness of his movement.

“Heat it up first” Sam calls over his shoulder, “It’ll taste better.”
Both ankles busted; another gift courtesy of his escape attempt. No more running off. Maybe no more running period. He tries not to think about that too much.
Cas sits on the edge of the bed, watching Dean sleep, the low light from the lamp playing across his freckled skin.
Cas chuckles, “Even in your weakened state, you fought me, in my true form; Understandably, you could not know my purpose was rescue. But I could not fight the hoards of hell
and if he were to answer the question Dean asked—
Cas tilts his head and leans forward to run his tongue along the rim, curiously. His head tilts at the unfamiliar taste only for a moment before diving back in.
Jack appears, without a noise, not even the telltale flutter of feathers.
The quick comment on Cas' lips is momentarily distracted when, Dean bends over and his shirt rides up enough to reveal a thin strip of golden skin and darker hickeys. His mouth goes dry,
“Yes.” Cas admits, and the dam breaks. “Balthazar nothing has changed about what I feel for Dean Winchester, he is… the most frustrating
“And sometimes, dads are just shit.” He adds, and she laughs so hard she snorts and he almost takes off his thumb.

, the psychic, he’s a witch like you right? The one that’s been getting all you magic-types and shit, out to help us fight? Eileen— his partner— she’s pregnant
“How’s heaven?” He asks when he can breathe again.
Dean doesn’t mention the spilled water; the way that Cas’ hands shake, or the way that any loud patron makes his head jerk up with panic. He just pats his knee, holding it until it stops bouncing— and cracks a joke, chattering about the fact that the hipsters actually do a pretty good job of making a burger and a nice stout, mentioning the little mechanic shop next to the coffee shop right up the road, how fun it might be to walk from work to nice hometown bar to get a beer.
"And raised you from perdition" Cas finishes, fingers curling into tight balls where they lay on his knees.
?” He whispers the last word.
Couldn't figure out a way for Dean to casually throw in the name Rhonda Hurley to see if that had made it in the books. maybe next time.
“—So what?"
Sam unofficially seeks him out for advice or a brainstorm session. He’s been talking to Rowena about a safe way to tap the powers given to him by the yellow-eyed demon. They stay up late that night discussing, Dean resists the urge to listen at the door.
“I’m sure we can fix it,” Castiel reassures, flashing a look of reproof at his unrepentant brother.

“Want
“You need… context.” He murmurs, and tilts his head up toward the night sky to avoid looking too closely at the man beside him.
Dean has returned unnoticed, face close; his freckles stand out in the bright sun, he leans into the Angel’s space. “Comin’ Cas?” He says, reaching a hand out,
two words,
“You're monster. No matter what universe.” John snaps, brushing past. “Always knew you were, now you’re ruining your faggot brother too—“
“Thanks Cas.”
“Or else?”
Dean runs a hand through his hair self consciously, it’s gotten so long that it tickles the top of his ears when he moves.
“Soon.”
Castiel.”
“You did not meet him at his best, Dean, when he fought together— I do not like to brag, but we were a quite a force to be reckoned with, in fact, I believe, you would have liked him, you two are very similar.”

Cas follows at a slightly slower pace, his shoes and socks off and stowed safely. He wonders softly, if he were to meet the Angel who pulled Dean out of hell, What would he say?
Cas informed him yesterday at breakfast that he would like to own goats, 'perhaps a chicken or two.'
“Yeah I got that when he stole a bike and headed to
isn’t something to be ashamed of.”
Rowena pops in next, graceful and terrifying even in her most natural form, flanked by two demons who stand head and shoulders above the Angels nearby. She winks at Cas and he ducks his head, flustered as always.
After eight months he wakes up and decides to try, just for himself. If Cas loved the world because of the people in it, why couldn’t he try a little of the same?
petty. He rolls his jaw in irritation, pokes at a hole in his jeans.
— you’re home."
Dean opens his mouth to protest and Sam shakes his head firmly.
“Are you going to stay, Angel?” He asks, dropping his eyes against his will, and the pinch of guilt is there and fresh. He can’t ask that of Cas, he won’t.
There is reverence in the eyes of angels, and sin in this act of man.
“You weren’t asking me if I was sure I wanted you to fuck me, were you?”
