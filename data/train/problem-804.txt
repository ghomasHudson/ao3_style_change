He stares back at me, eyes shining a bit—then extricates his wrist and takes the mug from my hand, sets it on the coffee table alongside his own.  He abruptly leans forward and pulls me into an embrace. Wraps his arms tightly around my body, drops his forehead to my shoulder. “Okay,” He whispers.  Okay.
John blinks, inhaling deeply as he glances around his small office.  He’s  always completely floored by these moments, these flashbacks that hit him without warning and the almost-real sense memories that accompany the images.  Sherlock’s skin, one elegant hand resting in John’s—alive and real and warm despite the bitter weather—watching him closely as he wraps the wound carefully with his own scarf.  The subtle puff of breath on John’s forehead—the fact that they’re standing rather closer than necessary—each of them always stealing any chance to do so without having to confront the reason why.  Neither of them ever quite acknowledging it beyond the frequent burning, blinding glances and occasional lingering touch.  That day in the alley he had wrapped his fingers firmly around Sherlock’s wrist, staring up at him for what felt like ages, willing him to understand how much John needs him.  Needs him to take his life seriously, to be less bloody reckless, to fucking stick around.
He’s taken this chance for the both of them—confronted this thing that’s been growing between them for so
forming so deep in his gut, spreading wildly through his limbs now, making his hands shake and his heart soar and—
“Yeah—yes,”  He says, with a nod.  “It’s what you think,”  He watches as her eyes go wide, expression shifting from exasperated to slightly disbelieving to beyond elated in the span of a second.

The metaphor in this one got a bit out of hand. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Anyway—” I cut in, before Hal can drag this out any further.  “Obviously we’ve both made mistakes over the years. It hasn’t been easy, and we haven’t always been kind to each other,”  I look at John, hoping that he can see my gratitude. “But he’s easily the best thing that’s ever happened to me. The best man I’ve ever known,”  And that is the truth.
“You—want to
“Hello,”  John smiles.
Movements a bit stilted, a bit unsure, John can’t help but push his hips upward to meet each of Sherlock’s tentative, exploratory rolls—and the moment he finds the angle he’s been looking for, John knows.  He watches as sharp, nearly black eyes fly open, meeting his own from just inches away and boring straight down to the heart of him.  Sherlock halts for a fleeting moment, leaning in to kiss the last coherent thoughts from John’s mind, then simply pants against his lips as he begins to move in earnest.
“A bit of each, I think.”

different—and I still feel just the same.  I think he might too,”  John sighs, hoping desperately that he’s right about this.  “On some level, at least,”  Harry sets her tea on the table, leaning forward to gently lower John’s newspaper.  She smiles at him—a small, proud thing—then casually ruffles his hair.
but his bastard of a flatmate.  He’d spent their first year together doing exactly that.  John had never dated so many women in such a short span of time in his life—finding the whole game rather tedious, honestly, despite his ridiculous reputation in the army—but he’d been trying to prove something to himself.  It was all useless, in the end.  An absolute waste of time.
“Mm.  The Martha Hudson Sober Living Grant didn’t have quite the same ring to it, but—that—that’s what it is,”  John inhales slowly, leans forward a bit, squeezes Sherlock’s wrist.  “The first recipient has already been chosen.  It’ll cover housing costs in a sober living facility for six months after rehab.  And—ah—a new recipient will be chosen every six months—indefinitely,”  He nods to himself, watching Sherlock closely for signs of life.  He’s lost in thought, clearly.  “That about covers it,”  John says quietly, not really expecting to be heard.
want, John?”
“I’m glad you brought me here,”  John says softly, as though he hasn’t just tilted Sherlock’s entire world on its previously unalterable axis.  John’s palm slides up to his ribcage, then back down to rest against his hip.  The length of his arm is a warm presence against the small of his back.  Sherlock breathes.  John continues.  “I want to try harder with you, Sherlock.  I’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to acknowledge that.”
“That is
Thanks to everyone who's still reading along!
“It’s
John thinks.  All of him, if he wants it.
“Had to get out of there,”  John breathes, the moment we walk out into the cool night air.  “Didn’t think he’d ever shut up,” We share a smile and head for the car hand in hand.  Climb in silently and pull away from the kerb. “The way he was looking at you—” He’s scowling at the road ahead.  Was he looking at me a certain way? I hardly spared him a glance. Had other things on my mind. “Anyway, at least he doesn’t seem to suspect anything.”
Hi!  It's been awhile.  I'm still slowly picking away at this story, though I'm finding it pretty difficult at the moment.  The plot is getting (and continues to be) fairly intense and I'm not really into that right now.  Might step away and write some fluff or something to get back into the creative swing of things.
“I’d like to talk,”  He says quietly. My stomach drops, as it did just ten minutes ago on the pavement.  He lightly takes my hand and pulls me down to sit by his side. “Can we?” I’m almost afraid to hear it.  Haven’t a single notion what he wants to say. Nevertheless, I nod. “This is difficult—there are things I’ve wanted to say to you for awhile now.  Since before we came here. But I didn’t want to get it wrong,” He swallows thickly, looking down at our joined hands for a beat, then back up to meet my eyes.  “I could never picture it—us. I didn’t see how it could work. I’ve thought about it over the years—of course I have—but it just seemed…” He trails off. “We’ve always had this unspoken thing between us, Sherlock—I know that it’s there—but it seemed like we would be risking too much by confronting it.  And then when you did—you were so
Something is off.
It’s like everything he’s spent the past few years thanking the heavens for is about to be ripped away from him.  He knows that he’s being a bit dramatic—Sherlock isn’t actually walking away from them—but it certainly feels that way now.
We stare at each other in silence.  It seems that once again, we’ve run out of words.
Are things not going to plan?”  He looks between the two of us. “
Sherlock smiles, despite himself.  He gives John a sidelong glance, quickly returning his gaze to the foaming sea.  He realizes rather abruptly that he isn’t ready—isn’t prepared for this conversation.  Not at all.  Not yet.
He sighs. “The other is empty.”
She’d asked in her email.
Ridiculous.  “It’s
He sounds a bit mad, really.  But this is the most John has ever said on the matter, and Greg is not about to waste an opportunity to try to gauge his current state of mind.  If his disheveled appearance is anything to go by, things have only gone downhill since they’d last spoken.
really?”  Bit of a fanciful descriptor.
“Medication doesn’t work for you, then?”  Sherlock only inhales deeply, wincing slightly as his body shifts.  It takes every bit of will John’s got not to reach out.
“All right,”  Harry nods distractedly, because she’s unable to conjure any sort of eloquent response for this.  She isn’t equipped to handle this sort of thing at all, has never had to be the one who does the looking-after.  She watches her brother on the other side of the room.  He hasn’t moved—has shown no sign of noticing her presence at all.  “Thank you—I—all right,”  She rises, standing frozen for a moment as her mind tries to catch up with the current situation, eventually deciding there’s nothing for it and moving across the room to stand at his side.  “John,”  She says quietly, placing a tentative hand on his arm.  He glances up at her as if in slow-motion, eyes glassy and unsettlingly detached.
“Working on that, yeah.”
“Wow, Johnny, I—I think I have some idea, actually.  Yeah.  This is—I’ve never seen you like this at all.”
—it sounds—temporary.  Or a bit—sordid.  I suppose I could call you my partner—you
Greg glances up at the tattered awning as he shuffles through the heavy blue door and into the eclectic (if a bit grimy) pub.  It’s been bloody ages since he’s been in this place.  Months and months.  He’d met John here a handful of times in the first weeks after Sherlock’s death—John claimed to have chosen it because it’s quiet and there’s absolutely no chance of running into any imbeciles from the Yard here.  Greg had gotten the impression that John had a history with the place, but he hadn’t pried.
“  He shakes his head.  How to phrase this?  “You’re the first man I’ve been with.  It’s all new for me, too.  The emotional aspect as well—you’re—”
who would be lost without him.  He’s trying to find a way not to be offended by Sherlock’s blunt statement, but he’s finding it rather impossible.
“But you don’t like
He looks relieved.  “Anyway, I’ll see her Tuesday.  I’ll talk through it with her, see what she thinks.”
“Greg.  And Mrs. H. is back this afternoon,” She’s been at her sister’s since Tuesday, meaning she hasn’t been around to hear the telling sounds of our blossoming relationship through the ceiling of her flat.  “And, ah--Molly, maybe. If you think it’s a good idea.” Right. Molly’s name hasn’t come up once since John found out she was in on the ruse.
“John—”
The envelope is fairly worn around the edges, as though it’s been carried around in a pocket for some time.  This pocket?  No.  This bag has been under his bed, ignored since his return to Baker Street.  Perhaps Sherlock has been keeping it with him, tucked away and waiting for the right moment.  John’s heart attempts to sink and leap simultaneously at the thought.  He never gave Sherlock a chance for something like this when he’d first returned.  And they’ve been trying so hard to pretend all is fine ever since—
And I do like chips.  “Indeed.”
stayed out all night.  She can’t help but feel a pang of—something.  Regret, perhaps.  Sadness.  Mourning the end of the lovely bond that had surged between those two misfit men.  John has been desperately holding onto it, even without Sherlock around to carry his part.  It’s been weighing him down, holding him back.  It’s best to let it go as soon as he’s able, she supposes.  To get on with his life, painful as it may be to do so.  She can hear him dithering in the hall and wanders from the kitchen toward the entryway, wiping her flour-dusted hands on a tea towel.
“There isn’t anyone you can—”
“It has its charms,”  His eyes linger on my face, looking for signs of deception, no doubt, but he eventually returns his attention to the conversation happening to his right.  I turn to John, who’s watching me cautiously. He looks defeated. Exhausted. I feel no empathy for him, now. He’s managed to make this infinitely more difficult than it ever needed to be.  When Ben rises to fetch another cocktail, I stand, declaring to the group that we really must be going. I shoot John a pointed look, and before anyone can protest, I turn and walk away.
“Fuck me, John,” I breathe, echoing his words from last night.  So he does.
“Come here,” A low rumble.  Sherlock is looking back at him with dark, hazy eyes.  Pleading eyes.  John goes.  Soon long fingers are combing through his hair, cupping his jaw, tracing a warm path down his side to remain on the curve of his waist.  “What is it, John?”  John swallows, shuts his eyes.  Shakes his head.
I consider fleeing.  Having spent the last ninety two minutes pondering our failing friendship and my part in that, I’m not sure I can ask this of him now.  He’ll surely say no. Why do I continuously convince myself that there’s a chance for us? It’s irrational. It’s pathetic, really. I need to just go.
This is where the doubt returns.  I know essentially everything a person can know about sex, without having actually experienced it for themselves.  I’ve studied human anatomy extensively—have a solid understanding of the process behind each—ah—method. And I have worked many a case where sex was the primary motivation for the crime.  I’ve even watched a few—videos. But my knowledge ends with the technical and the criminal. I have no practical experience—obviously—and the likelihood that I will soon make a fool of myself is high.  I’ve never

Last line is a lyric from the song that inspired this soft story.
Lets out a bark of laughter.  “Does he call him that all the time?”  He asks Rosie.
Now he sees the man who followed him here, to a place unknown, without question or concern.  He sees the only person who has ever made him feel so wholly accepted, trusted—so fully recognized and understood.  Sherlock softens, allowing a wave of tenderness to rise up through his chest, further clogging his useless larynx, causing a slight prickle behind his stupid eyes.
“She’s all right.  A bit bored, I think.  Wanted to talk about him.  About Sherlock.  So we did.  It was—fine,”  Greg hasn’t heard John say Sherlock’s name aloud since before his death.  Perhaps he has made some progress after all.  He takes a moment to consider his next words.
“You really mean it.  You want to be with him.  Why’d you spend so long denying it, then?”  She’s leaning forward, elbows on the table, hair a wild, ratty mess and leg still awkwardly propped up on the chair beside her.  John looks at her for a moment, then bursts into laughter.  She gives him a look that clearly says
you would have, Sherlock.  If you’d known, you’d have dropped everything to help us.  But you’ve done so much for us already, I couldn’t ask you again,”  I’m dumbfounded by this response.
“Hey,” Smiles.  A bit bashful. He’s perfect.
When I drift into sleep, it’s with my head on his chest, counting the beats of his heart.  Eyelids growing heavy, his fingers carding gently through my hair, I slip gradually into oblivion.
"John?"
“I’m going to try something,”  He says finally, keeping his voice low as he rises slowly to sit at the edge of the sofa.  Sherlock’s body immediately inches forward to curl around his side.  Oh, hell.  He knows bloody well that Sherlock, in this diminished state, is just drawn to the warmth that his proximity provides, but John’s heart squeezes painfully nevertheless.  He finally gives in to instinct and brushes a hand over the man’s forehead, pushing sweat-soaked curls out of his eyes.  “Tell me to fuck off if this isn’t helpful, yeah?”  No response, but John hadn’t expected one.  He’s well aware that Sherlock will make it known the moment his presence is no longer wanted.
“You know, yesterday he told me he identifies as demisexual.  Had never heard of such a thing and I’m meant to be a bloody doctor,”  But today he’d spent half the morning reading about demisexuality and a whole spectrum of other orientations and identities that he’s fairly certain didn’t exist when he first began to question his own.  Or perhaps he just wasn’t ready to explore them.  Harry slowly lifts an eyebrow.
He’d never meant for this exercise to turn into a bloody one-sided conversation.  Ella had suggested that he write—the same bland suggestion she’d made when he’d returned from war, broken and inconsolable and ready to get the fuck out of this life.  She’d told him to write out his thoughts, since he clearly couldn’t speak them.  Now she tells him to write his regrets.
really.  Just the one.  This bloody pub holds its own unpleasant memories.  Their parents have been dead for nearly a decade, but the new owners haven’t changed a goddamn thing about the place.
He pauses. “Both are labeled with the letters AGRA.  No confirmation as of yet, but the acronym is associated with a known group of agents that disappeared from our radar a few years back.”
John sighs into the kiss, reaches down to palm Sherlock firmly through his pants.  He moans breathily into the space between John’s lips and doesn’t protest when he breaks free to slide further down that long, lean body.
When he looks up at Sherlock, John finds mesmeric grey eyes already fixed on him.  He has to swallow around the lump rapidly forming in his throat when he sees what’s lurking in the depths of that gaze.  The unguarded affection on display is magnetic, thrilling—John feels an overwhelming pull toward the man in front of him—an immense swell of something new rising unbidden in his chest.  This moment feels profound—teeming with possibility.  John stares back, trying desperately to convey how he feels right now and
We trudge up the stairs to our blue room—John’s blue eyes on me each step of the way.  Don’t worry, John. The mood will pass. Just a bit of melancholy to shake things up. Just a bit of blue
“Molly will be here in an hour.”
John is trembling lightly above me.  He breathes heavily into my neck, chest rising and falling against my spine.  I feel used up, thawed out. Limbs like jelly as I lie here, mind still reeling.  His weight on me is a comfort, a reassurance. I wonder now what he’ll do next. The last thing I want is for him to retreat back into a realm of shame and self-loathing.  I could feel every ounce of his frustration (with me, with everything) and pain, clinging close, right on top of his skin. Raw and honest. We have this now, another language, to help us cope.

“Many people are wary of therapy.  Not interested in talking with a stranger about their lives,” She looks at John, back at me.  “But it’s nearly always beneficial to share your thoughts with an unbiased party. John can testify.  Consider it, won’t you?” And with that, she stands, showing us to the door.
Perfect.
“We’re together,” I blurt out.  “John and I. For a few days now.  We wanted to tell the three of you in person.”  We’re met with a moment of stunned silence. And then:
, of course.
His hands remain firmly on my hip and waist.
“Molls,”  He says carefully.  “Let him—”
“Irene,”  John nods, his tone caught somewhere between empathetic and irritated.  I watch as she studies him, sharp eyes roving across his face—no doubt effortlessly reading each emotion present there.  She seems to relax slightly, leaning against Ben, arms crossed in front of her. She sighs.
“Well what?”
The swell of fondness—perhaps a bit of exasperation—in the unshuttered depths staring back at him knocks him a bit off-kilter.  It occurs to him now that he hasn’t really looked at John, has been afraid to, for quite some time.  Not like this, at least—not so openly, without his walls.
I shrug.  “It was nice.  They adore John, as you know.  And I’ve suddenly found myself the owner of our childhood home, which I’m sure you’re also aware of,”  Another nod. “We expected you to make an appearance.”
played masterfully on a violin by an absolute king.  Please watch this, it's so good & a perfect visual (and audio) aid.  There's even a part where he's silhouetted against a window, Sherlock style.  This song may seem randomly thrown in here, but it's just one of my long time favorites.  Please ignore the fast and loose use of musical terminology.  I know nothing of classical concertos and trying to write a not-boring description of a man playing a violin had me squirming.  Oh and 'calm as a Hindu cow' is a Fight Club reference, ha.
An overwhelming wave of emotion washing through me, I turn my head on a whim, press my lips to his neck.  We haven’t done this yet, either—kissed—it never held any appeal for me until recently. Now I’m regularly compelled to lie my lips on various regions of his flesh.  But I haven’t. Until now. I let my tongue dance lightly across his skin, tasting salt, smelling his own musky scent where my nose rests under his jaw. He sighs, tightens his grip on my body.
—just the fact that Sherlock had thought about such a thing—about John’s need for a peaceful corner to recharge his creative energy.  There hasn’t been much peace in the flat in the past few years.  Things have been mostly lovely—they really have—but between cases, sharing a room with Rosie and the fact that there’s really nowhere to escape to within 221B, John’s spent more time talking about his intention to begin writing again than actually doing it.  The blog has sat neglected—an occasional update, when he can muster the motivation, but nothing like it used to be.
John supposes she’ll always be with them, in a way.
He’s certain that he never has.  The few times a year he’s consumed by them generally result in an intolerable twelve hours of debilitating pain and an even more maddening sense of desperation and inefficacy.
We’re in a cab on our way to pick her up at Molly and Lestrade’s flat, where she’s been staying while we were in Wales for the case.  The two of them found each other just over two years ago, while both of them were at a low point in life—isolated and apathetic. They sought comfort in their friendship, and it quickly evolved into something more.  They’re good together. And they’re both happier and more settled than I’ve ever seen them.
“No, just—I shouldn’t have agreed to come.  I was in no state to be any sort of proper guest.  I’d—”  He pauses, takes another drink.  “I’d been to Baker Street.  The day before.  To see Mrs. Hudson,”
“John—” I trail off again.  This is useless. I shake my head.
“The client is well aware that we work as a team.  Obviously they know that you’re here with me,” I respond, glancing down at the newspaper that showed up on our stoop this morning.  I don’t mention that we haven’t actually worked a case together in nearly half a year. Even before I blew everything up between us, we had begun to drift.  He’d been asked to pick up more shifts at the clinic—and had gotten swept up in Rosie’s routine, now that she’s participating in dance classes and art programmes.  But we have been partners in the work for over twelve years now. People expect us to come as a pair, and

Mycroft.  Brilliant.
“What is it?”
Sherlock’s love for him is on full display, here—as though his heart has taken the form of this carefully chosen home.  Eventually, Sherlock nods toward the bookshelves.
“John,” His eyes are closed.  I brush the tears from his cheek, push his hair back from his forehead.  “The one charm of the past, is that it is the past.” He opens his eyes. Then narrows them.
#cockblock
“Is that—”
I sit hunched over my laptop in our excessively blue room, eyeing the paper cup of coffee on the desk to my right.  It’s gone cold. Drink it anyway? Yes, I think so.
“Sherlock, let me go!”  I do. I peer up at him.  He’s furious. Boiling. Steamed.  “I’m going to sleep upstairs tonight,” I say nothing.  He stares at me. I stay silent. Then he turns around and walks out of the room.
“There’s a package under the sink,”  She cuts him off, having made up her mind about it.  “Fetch it, please,”  She’s really not sure if this is wise.  She is certain that it isn’t her place, that it isn’t her gift to give.  But now that she’s seen what’s become of John Watson, it feels necessary—if a bit bloody reckless.
When have you ever had a best friend?  Plus you’re like forty.  I’d thought that was you trying to give it a name while still maintaining that you’re straight as a bloody board, which has never been true.”
It’s been two days in his presence, and already I’m crumbling.  It was a mistake to invite him. It was a mistake to come here at all.
With fingers first, as I lean forward, face pressed into the side of our bed.  Still half-clothed, we move together, sweat together—John’s slippery digits relentlessly teasing me open as I gradually relax around him.  He grabs my waist, bending me over the bed. Hovers above me, hands on my hips, and glides his slick shaft into my body. We’ve done this often enough that the sensation is a familiar one.  Filled by him, surrounded by him, I moan into the sheets below. He pulls back slow, and pushes in
“I would have—”
Where to begin?  Does he need to know everything?  Do I tell him I’ve killed men—destroyed lives—to preserve his?  I’ve spent most of our time together these last few weeks trying to keep thoughts of the past two years out of my head entirely.  Now I feel wholly unprepared for this conversation. “John, I’m—” I’m what? Ashamed? Is that what I need him to know? I’ve been putting this off for fear of the repercussions.  He will see me in a different light—it will haunt him. “I’m not proud of what I’ve done.”
John watches Sherlock take in his words, watches him scowl in confusion, watches as his expression gradually morphs into something that is definitely closer to longing, to hope.  And then he sees it.  The confirmation he’d been looking for.  Sherlock wants this, too.
before quietly retreating back down the steps.  The air is thick with uncertainty again, now that we’re alone—each of us afraid of making a wrong move and shattering this delicate web we’ve begun to weave around one another.  John looks up at me.
Blunt fingers clutch urgently at the back of the hand that rests on John’s belly, pushing until he can weave his fingers into the crevices between Sherlock’s own.  He squeezes bruisingly and nods once, soft hair tickling Sherlock’s cheek as John melts entirely back into his chest.
“Slightly less if you accompany me,”  I suppose I’m playing with fire, immediately suggesting he come along again.  But he is here. Why is he here?
He jumps as the kettle overfills and cold water douses his hand.  He shuts off the tap, pours out the excess, puts the kettle on the hob, snatches a towel from the worktop.
with a beard, so he's keeping it for the duration of this story.
“Stop fretting,”  Sherlock says quietly as Rosie babbles on, pulling John from his implausible musings.  “You have such little faith in me, John,”  His face breaks into a wicked smirk as he says it, which does nothing to stop the carousel of unconventional housing images that’s spinning wildly through John’s head.  Still, he grins helplessly back.  He really can’t shake the sense of immense possibility that’s been lingering around them all afternoon.
After much badgering, John has convinced me to seek out sustenance beyond the hallway vending machines—so here we sit, side by side, speeding along the highway in the blinding sunlight.  I glance over and can’t help but smile at the sight of him in his tortoiseshell wayfarers and tight white t-shirt. He’s even acquiring a bit of a
is the truth of it.  Their father never threw away a single thing in his entire pathetic, drunken life.  Choosing to be here rather than home says quite a lot about John’s state of mind.
"He looks ancient.  I can't be seen wandering around with an old man."  I sigh. As if such a thing matters. As if I wouldn’t give anything to have him by my side again.  I’ve already given everything. "I think I'll surprise John. He'll be delighted."
I wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him to my side.  His hand snakes around my back as he leans his body against mine.  Warm, safe.
Now my mouth—hot, warm, wet—slides up, down, up, down.  Head bobbing swiftly like a cork in the water, tongue dancing madly along his hot flesh.
“It is, yeah.  Look, Molly—we could use some time—just us.  We—have a lot to talk about.  Will you take her?  Promise you can be the first to see the new place.”
I sigh—I’d been expecting this.  Clearly she hasn’t changed much. I glance over at John’s sleeping form beside me as I tap out a response.
coursing between them in frenzied currents and crackling, frenetic sparks—now that it’s been released at last.
John stands, heart in a frenzy, and waits for Sherlock to meet his eyes.
I shift back, spread his legs and kneel between them.  Can I do this? I can do this. God, I want to do this.  A finger coated in lubricant, a deep breath. I firmly circle the (tight) muscle until he exhales—tension fading—allowing me in.  Lightly, slowly. In and then out. Repeat, repeat, repeat,
John turns where he kneels on the floor, watching him approach.  He holds out a hand, palm up, eyebrows raised in a wordless request.  Sherlock grins, nearly laughs, as he unpockets the neon green lighter and sets it firmly in John’s open hand.  John smiles, returns to his task and pokes at the logs for a moment as a fire crackles to life, bathing the cottage in a cosy, warm glow.  He slowly stands, looking entirely unsure of what comes next.  He sets the lighter on the mantle.  This time it’s Sherlock who reaches out a hand.
.  “I wanted to tell you.  I’m
John is watching me.  My eyes have just flickered open to find his blue orbs staring me down from a mere eight inches away.  Face to face we lie--as we tend to do in this new life--and say nothing.
This final statement is met with a vast, vibrating chasm of silence.  What can she possibly say to that?  He’s said it, now.  He wants to follow the bastard into oblivion.  No platitudes or halfhearted begging from his nearly-estranged sister will break through a proclamation like that.  She’d accepted long ago that this sort of loss may one day be a part of her life again.  Now it feels as though she’s lost him already.
“Yes?”  Obviously yes.  As if John could deny him this or anything else, ever again.  He nods, running his palms up and down the backs of Sherlock’s thighs as he lifts himself up on his knees and begins a steady, slick pull along John’s shaft.  He wastes no time lining them up—they’re both too far gone for this to go on much longer—and as he inches his way down, slowly,
I wake before John, the sun just beginning to rise, casting a soft orange glow over the room.  We haven’t moved much in sleep—I’m still lying against his side, arm draped over his torso.  My face is tucked comfortably into the crook of his neck now, and I can feel his breath against my temple.  It takes me a moment to gather my bearings, to remember that this is all right, now. I turn my head, find myself face to face with him.  We’ve never been this close. I’ve never been this close with anyone. It’s a bit alarming, to be allowed so completely into his personal space.  He’s still sleeping soundly, and when I hear a quiet shuffling at the door, I glance over in time to see Rosie poking her head in. I smile.
The cheerful conversation resumes as we break out the trifle.  Mrs. H. really does have a way with desserts. And as we move back to the living room to finish off the last of the wine--everyone full, content and more than a little buzzed--I admit to myself easily that this is the happiest I’ve ever been.
And John is fairly certain that he’s never felt so content in his life.  He runs his palms slowly up Sherlock’s back, learning the lines of his body, tracing long scars draped over soft skin—reminders of a time when he couldn’t be there, couldn’t save him.  But he’s here now—always will be, if he can help it.
“What do you need to speak to me about?”  He asks, tone clipped. “I need to get back,”  Fantastic—let’s add a ticking clock to this already impossible encounter.  Better get right to it, then.

“Is that Greg?” John has been tapping away at his own phone, propped up against the headboard and scowling at whatever he sees on the screen.  “He’s been texting more details about Mary’s case. God, I’m not up for this today.”
They were in love—like—
“John,” Molly cuts Greg off mid-sentence as he rambles on about some case or other.  John isn’t listening anyway.  He hardly seems present at all—a wisp in the wind.  At the sound of his name, however, he meets her eye.  “Tell me how you’ve been.  Tell me how you’ve really been,”  He looks momentarily surprised, then briefly terrified—caught out.  She watches, then, as his walls fly up, face going eerily blank.
“Still may be,” I pull a small lever from my inner coat pocket and wedge it into the thin crack between trap door and floor.  Cobwebs cling to the underside as I pry the wood up and flip it back on its hinges. John hands me a torch and places a hand on my shoulder as we peer down into the cellar below.
He says, eyebrows raised.  “Well, it’s about time,” I roll my eyes.  I wonder what sort of bet they had going about the supposed inevitability of John and I ending up here.  They’ve both made many little comments over the years, knowing full well how I feel about him. It was obvious to everyone but John.  The fact that
“Hey,” He says, voice hushed but close, resting a tentative hand on Sherlock’s bicep.  “What is this, Sherlock?”  He stirs slightly under the heat of John’s palm.  John watches, waits for him to surface.  He wants to brush the sweaty curls from his forehead, to lie down beside him and stroke his back, synchronize their breathing, fold him into his arms and keep him.  John wants to do these things all the time.  He wants to do them even when Sherlock isn’t clearly hurting.
“You told me that you wanted to retire in the country with me someday, you know.  Did you have this place in mind, then?” Did I? Perhaps I did. What I had in mind at that point in time was another decade or two of the work and our life at 221B—followed by quiet and peace, once we’ve tired of it.  Now, it seems, we can have it all simultaneously. We can have the action once we’re ready for it, and the quiet domesticity whenever we need it. And we can have each other, for the rest of our lives.
“Save it, Mycroft,”  John is in a mood that I cannot contend with.  He wouldn’t hear my claims that getting my brother involved was futile.  Didn’t listen when I’d told him he was wasting his time. Whatever it is about this situation with Hal that’s got him all wound up, he’s determined to resolve it.  Mycroft looks a bit taken aback by the interruption, but he’s clearly curious about the nature of this call. He waits for John to continue. “Holling Collins. An alias, surely.  Tell us what you know,” Interesting. He hasn’t mentioned his suspicions. My inability to find even a trace of the man online suggests as much, but we haven’t discussed it. Anyway, I have already attempted—entirely unsuccessfully—to uncover his true identity.
He’d chosen the destination by closing his eyes and pressing the pad of his right index finger to a map of the United Kingdom that’s been pinned to the wall since the Cubitt case two weeks ago.  He’d landed somewhere in the English Channel, and so slid said finger a bit to the right, to the first coastal town that caught his eye.  A place called Hope.  Hope Cove, to be precise.
He comes with a desperate shout--body shaking, quaking.  I follow close behind --collapsing, crumbling. We lie in a heap--breathing, buzzing--and a wave of relief washes over me.

“Why would it?”  He’s still not quite following—this conversation feels abstract, like they’re still skirting around the truth.
I lick off the last remnants of our sordid soirée, tuck him back in and hoist him up.  He looks at me dazedly, holding onto my hand, as I tug him away and back through the door
“Until you, John.  He has you.  He’s in love with

“What then?”  He has something on his mind.  He’s seemed odd for weeks now. Oddly kind, oddly indulgent, oddly present.  Maybe he’s met someone?  Would that be so difficult to say aloud? For him, perhaps.  Is it something else?  Something--whatever this is, he's stalling.  "Mycroft.  Will you just--"
Carpet.  Minnie’s room alone is covered in horrendous, fusty beige wall-to-wall carpeting.  “Can’t afford to replace it quite yet,” Stella chimes from the doorway as I bend down to inspect the polyester eyesore.
Most of his feelings toward Sherlock over the past few years have involved an overwhelming measure of gratitude and a quiet respect.  He loves the man, sure—but he’s known that almost from the start—and that particular sentiment (and his inability to fully accept it) has caused more pain than anything else.
He isn’t wrong.  Rationally John knows this—has known it.  If he’s honest with himself, when he’d moved back into 221B after the dust had settled three years ago, he’d hoped that at some point he and Sherlock wouldn’t have a need for separate bedrooms.  Of course those dreams had all come crashing down when they’d had

“Good,”  She mimics his tone, giggling as she lies back against the end of the tub for a moment, then sits back up abruptly.  “Can we see
Harry and Lestrade both show up just before two.  When we open the door, they’re both awkwardly fidgeting at the top of the stairs, standing a careful metre apart.  They haven’t had occasion to meet before now, so John laughs at the sight of them and makes introductions. Despite our explicit orders to not bring gifts, Lestrade has in his hands a nice bottle of scotch, and Harry is clutching a small, hastily wrapped package.  I roll my eyes and take their offerings when they thrust them into my hands.
“Good.  I’ll be in touch.”  And with that swift goodbye, he hangs up.

answering her mobile?”  Irene’s expression hardens instantly.  Eyes narrowing at the sound of her long gone lover’s name.  Ben shifts slightly, clearly a bit uncomfortable. He’s been silent thus far, but I’m certain he’s been wondering the same thing since we’d made the call an hour ago.  Irene says nothing, only glares daggers at John. A long, heavy moment passes between the four of us in this little room. I—for once—haven’t got a clue what to say. Now that she’s in front of us—now that she has spoken of lessons learned and solemn regret, I have no real answers.  No solid data, and no grand reveal.
“Yep,” She doesn’t look up from her concentrated colouring, and she doesn’t ask why John was in my bed.  They stay here occasionally out of convenience, but of course he usually sleeps upstairs. She doesn’t seem to mind either way.  I wouldn’t know what to say if she had questions anyway—I’ll leave all that to John.
actually—but I’d like him to be, yeah,”  She stares at him, mouth a bit agape.  He grins, returning his gaze to his mobile.
“Come on,” He stands up, grabs my hand, and drags me to the couch.  He lies right down on his back and pulls me on top of him. “Move.”
“This place reminded me of you the moment I saw it, you know,”  Sherlock says, unlocking the front door.
Observing them now—Sherlock crouched down on the floor, one arm around Rosie where she leans against his side and points at various objects of interest—he thinks that perhaps she already does.

He lets go, surrenders to instinct, chasing John’s pleasure and finding his own.

John hesitates.
asks John for assistance when he needs it, even on those occasions when he could easily just help himself.  He never hesitates to pester John relentlessly at the first sign of injury or mild discomfort (or just an inconveniently placed mobile that he’s too lazy to retrieve), so what, then, is this?
John’s hands migrate to my hair, fingernails scraping lightly against my scalp, and I moan softly, right into his mouth.  Every scratch of his nails and tug of his fingers sends a drop of heat skittering down my spine. He kisses me fiercely, unrestrained—both of us breathing rough and ragged—and hitches a leg over my hip.  We rub our bodies together, erections sliding solid as steel, and I snake an arm around John’s waist to pull him in closer. We both cry out at the increased contact, barely holding on, nearly ready to let go.  Pleasure pooling fast in my gut, bubbling up into a rabid boil. Chest heaving furiously, I roll onto my back, pulling John on top of me. He tucks his face into the crook of my neck, panting hot air onto my assailable flesh.  Our frenzied thrusts slide our shafts together fluidly, over and over—and over and over—
I feel him nod against my shoulder.  “Yes. All right, yes.” He snakes his arm through mine and holds on.
Small and lost and nothing like the firecracker of a man she’d grown up with and relied on all her life.  She glances around this achingly familiar space, eyes roaming over the clusters of mismatched sofas, the lonely leather armchairs that frame the fireplace, the strange taxidermy and even stranger old paintings adorning the walls.  Her gaze drifts to the shelves of knickknacks behind the bar, to the hundreds of fraying postcards stabbed in stacks onto the heads of nails, the countless stray keys hanging in bunches on hooks—all left behind by decades of patrons who’d found themselves in this corner of the world and wanted to leave their mark.  All her father’s treasures, still proudly displayed after all this time.  The pub is empty but for the tragic figure sitting vigil at the bar.
John can only shake his head at the ridiculous image they present—and he knows full well how long this particular activity is likely to drag out.  Placing a hand briefly on Sherlock’s back, he heads out in search of the room that’s been chosen for
A shared gasp—lips trembling where they touch.  A pause—noses brushing, mingled breath hot as it puffs over skin, behind teeth, into lungs.  A careful caress, a subtle slide of tongue.
Harry glances at the time.  2:33.  Mentally shaking herself and begging her bloody brain to wake up, she hurriedly pockets the mobile, hoisting herself off the couch she’s been dozing on and shrugging into her jacket.  She bolts out of the flat, vaguely registering the crack of the slamming door behind her as she tries not to think too hard about what, exactly, this means.  An unfamiliar swell of panic lodges itself in her throat, forcing her to swallow thickly.  If he’s at that godforsaken place, things are more grim than she’d been letting herself believe.
His own feelings aside—when had this become an option for them?  Sherlock has certainly never shown the slightest bit of interest in pursuing a romantic entanglement with John, or with anyone else.  Ever.  They’ve gotten closer in the last month, sure—physically, even.  Sherlock prefers to be near him, to feel his presence, he knows that now.  It’s reassuring for him, probably, after being alone for so long.  That’s how it feels to John.
“Hugo,” A deep rumble.  I swallow when he shakes my hand.  I don’t often take notice of, well, anyone—but this man is unusually magnetic.  His presence is commanding. John seems similarly smitten, his eyes roaming over Hugo’s tattooed biceps, dark skin and neatly groomed beard.  “Hal mentioned you were in Afghanistan,” This snaps him out of it. I watch his face fall.
“She chose you to introduce us to Hal—to be our first link to the case she brought us here to solve.  Clearly she trusts you,” I let John speak—he’s always been undeniably better at this—questioning those involved with a case.  I tend to turn even the most informal conversation into an interrogation with little effort. He’s well practiced at gaining data without losing trust.
“Yes,”  John says, clearing his throat and forcing his mind back to the present.  The door opens a bit and the new nurse—name instantly forgotten—pokes her head in.
Sherlock tears at a piece of bread and steals a glance at John, who’s tucking in enthusiastically as he is wont to do when there’s food within his reach.  When John notices Sherlock looking, he swallows the bite of mussel he’d been chewing and finally speaks.
“Rosie loves Christmas, John.”
if only they’ll let them.
“Sussex?” John is reading over my shoulder.
Enjoy!
By the time we get home, I feel a bit looped up, zipped down.  Obstreperous. Incorrigible. I’m tripping up the steps, and John is not pleased.  Why are you annoyed, John? Have I let you down again?
I’m shocked into a nervous huff of laughter by this unexpected outburst.  Something’s got John’s hackles up and it’s a sight to behold. I peer over at him, trying to parse out his sudden shift in mood.  Sally narrows her eyes at me, but then turns to John and nods, stiffly. “Right. Old habits, you know…”
We arrive at Berwick Station around two.  We’ve got nothing on this week, so we decide to make it a bit of a holiday.  John has booked us for two nights at The Gashlycrumb Inn, a converted victorian mansion just three kilometres from the Eames residence.
“I wouldn’t, no,”  John agrees, bumping his shoulder against Sherlock’s as they carry on walking, this time side by side.  “I’ve never known you to give a single shit about Christmas,”  He adds with a grin.  Sherlock scoffs.

Right on cue, Sherlock rolls onto his back, glancing at John, who quickly pulls back the arm that isn’t smashed beneath a gangly torso.
“Piss off,”  Is all he says.
“No bloody idea.  Just—lucky.  So bloody lucky, Harry.  He’s—“  John swallows hard, realizes he’s getting a bit choked up, thinking of Sherlock and all that he is.  Saying it aloud to his sister, of all people.  God, this Christmas is getting to him.  It really is. “He’s incredible.  You know him.  He’s brilliant.  Thoughtful.  Loyal.  The way he is with Rosie is just—and with me, now that we’ve—I am constantly surprised by him.  By his willingness to—“ John sniffs, stares up at the ceiling.  Christ.
He does.
For awhile, though, we didn’t see each other at all.  I had made the mistake of letting Mary and her absurd post-death video messages send me straight to Hell in a misguided attempt to manipulate John into helping me back out.  I’d gone back to drugs and chaos, and he’d reverted to violence and rage in his frustration. It was not a good time for us. He still carries a lot of guilt over it. And I still have quite a bit of regret about how I handled things, then.
“Show me what you have in mind,” His hands on my hips, now.  My heart slams against my ribcage, threatening to vacate my chest entirely.  My arms hang uselessly at my sides. I've been afraid to show him what I have in mind, for fear of pushing him away.  The past fifteen days have been—without question—the best of my life. John and I are more in sync than we’ve ever been—likely because we’re together nearly constantly now.  We’ve been rather focused on the work as of late, running around London together and then coming home and huddling on the couch, leaning on one another and solemnly rehashing the case.  Or falling into bed, exhausted and still fully clothed, drifting into sleep side by side. We’re a team again. We’ve found our balance once more. And now that I’ve grown comfortable with this new tactile facet of our relationship, I want more.
Hi!  Been awhile.
“Have I?”  John says evenly, holding Sherlock’s gaze.  They stand, eyes locked, for what feels like an age.  John is more sure now than ever of their potential for a new start, for something
“Wow,”  John finds himself drifting across the room to another window, which looks out at a colossal weeping willow that evidently resides on the side of the house.  He lets his eyes roam over the room, imagining Rosie growing up here, in this creatively charged space.  Someone, at some point in time, put their whole heart into this—and it’s really rather inspiring.  “It’s terribly beautiful,”  He says quietly.  A smile blooms across Sherlock’s face when their eyes meet.
Bit cruel.
“Yes,” I say, placing my hand on the nape of his neck, fingers drifting through his fine grey hair.  He glances at me, smiling, before returning his eyes to the winding road. “Perhaps—” I’ve hesitated to suggest this, knowing full well that John will not agree.  We’ve only just found this new confidence in what we’ve become to one another, and I don’t want to risk damaging that. But logistically, I have thought it through—and I think our next move is clear.  “Perhaps it’s time we let Hal believe that he can have me.”

a proper family, you absolute cock,”  John whispers, standing close, both hands on Sherlock’s heaving chest.  “This is just a formality.  Of course it’s what I want.  As I said—long overdue,”  He wraps Sherlock up in a lingering embrace, then steps back, glances at the second envelope, lying abandoned on Sherlock’s chair.  “Open the other one.”
So John just holds on, something in his chest squeezing pleasantly as they step over the threshold, digits entwined.
So John does.  He lets his palms glide up Sherlock’s back, once again tracing the long scars that mar his pale skin.  He’s aware that he’s rather drawn to them, now that he’s allowed to be—as though his touch alone can erase each memory of solitude, of pain.  His hands slide up into slick curls, forward to cup Sherlock’s face through vehement kisses, and eventually back down his chest, thumbs circling peaked nipples.  Sherlock moans, pressing John back against the wall, directly beneath the powerful spray above.  He gasps as his back hits the tile, opening his eyes and grinning up at an entirely drenched Sherlock, dark curls plastered artfully to his skin.
Perhaps a nice roast for dinner.  Maybe that would get him to come down for a bit of a chat.  A roast to go with these crusty blaas—his favourite, though she pretends every time that she didn’t know.  She’d like to check in, to cautiously probe.  She had learned rather quickly not to try to discuss Sherlock outright—Martha had never seen a man shutter up as quickly as John did after her one and only attempt at asking how he was coping with the loss.  And what a loss it was.  The man has been an absolute wreck.  The two of them were so thoroughly intertwined, she can hardly blame him.
Barely a breath, but he hears me, he understands.  Tugs on my wrist until I collapse against his back.  I let my lips linger at the top of his spine, tasting salt, taking time.  We breathe in tandem, unmoving, adjusting—each trying hopelessly to grasp this raw intensity.  I roll my hips slightly and feel him shudder beneath my chest. Lift my pelvis—immense pressure, immense
We found our way back to one another after a few months apart.  I spent that time in a persistent black mood, still using and completely adrift—forced to admit that I was lost without him, but confused by the rage he’d directed at me.  Eventually we talked through a lot of our demons, resolved many of our lingering issues. Forgave, forgot. Cleared the air. And when things became difficult again, we were ready to be there for one another.  Everything Eurus put us through ended up bringing us closer, in the end. It was more clear to me than ever that John is my family, that I need him in my life. He had evidently had a similar revelation, because we’d found some sort of unspoken understanding after that.  And when Eurus took her own life six months later, he was there for me, too.
Mrs. Holmes has been relentless, pleading with them to bring Rosie for a visit in Penarth to celebrate.  John still doesn’t know what Sherlock told her—he must have called his parents in a moment of weakness (or perhaps even happiness) while he was loafing around in his laboratory last week, because John received a nearly hysterical phone call from a joyfully weeping Mummy as he was putting Rosie to bed.  Mycroft had sent them a lotus plant—the simple gesture and symbolism nearly bringing John to tears.  Not that it takes much these days.
I realize I'm staring.  Frozen in place. The dread has returned to my gut.  Roiling and spreading and rooting me to the ground where I stand.  He hasn't moved either. What's holding him in place? Can he feel my presence, as I feel his?  No. Ridiculous. I'm dead. Well, there's nothing for it; here I go.
Arms twisted around his, our fingers twined together, I drive into his body—hard and fast.  Sweat-slicked skin sliding, unrestrained desire coiling, the clap of our flesh as my hips furiously snap.

Feeling suddenly on edge, I take the mug from him, setting it next to my own untouched cup and earning myself a questioning look—then glance back at Henry.
John is unhappy.  Disconsolate. Down in the mouth.  “John,” It’s all I can manage. He’ll understand.
I realize I’ve slipped away when I feel a soft pressure on my shoulder.  I look up to see Molly hovering hesitantly by my chair, pulling her hand back the moment our eyes meet.  “Hello,” She says quietly. “All right?”
“Yes,” Sherlock’s fingers find his where they rest on the floor between them.  He cautiously covers John’s hand with his own.
“Indeed,”  Sherlock brushes a hand through her mop of curls.  “We’ve got plenty of space, and it’s the most logical solution,”  John isn’t too sure about that, but he’s not exactly opposed to it either.  Everything about this place is entirely mad—may as well throw a slide into the mix.  “It’s scheduled to be installed day after tomorrow.  Until then, you’re not to use the stairs without your daddy or me.  Understood?”  He looks down his nose at Rosie, his resemblance to Mycroft rather startling when he uses this tactic on her.  John laughs quietly, causing them both to glance his way.
—he isn’t—“He
“You’re regretful,”  He says, voice uncharacteristically uncertain.
Maybe it’s true.  Maybe.  But he’s missing something—some crucial link, some pivotal component.
I don’t tell him that with every life I took, I felt less human, myself.  Instead I tell him of how I finally tracked down Sebastian Moran—the man who was to kill him if I hadn’t jumped—in Brussels.  He only nods solemnly, eyes shining, when I tell him that I shot Moran in the head.

“Not a chance,” He breathes through his glee, taking advantage of Sherlock’s momentary distraction to roll on top of him.  “Shower though,” John kisses the smirk from his lips and jumps up, grabbing the towel draped over the chair by the door and heading for the loo, knowing that Sherlock will follow.
“You love her,”  John says, voice hushed, gentle.  He hadn’t thought her capable either.  Wasn’t expecting to be confronted with this wounded bird—this lost, empty version of the woman we’d once known.  And he can’t help but feel for her. Ever the empath, my John.
“John,”  Now they lie once more in the silent solitude that seems only to exist beneath the duvet—limbs tangled rather thoroughly, noses pressed together and lips occasionally meeting, but mostly not.  John inhales deeply at the sound of his name, shifting in response and settling somehow closer.  “I’d like to have a wedding.  A—proper wedding,”  Sherlock quietly rumbles.  John lets his eyes drift open and glances up.  Sherlock is watching him.  There’s no trace of doubt on his features or in his tone, and some part of John wonders if he’s heard him wrong.

“Ah, John,”  Sherlock positively beams up at him, leaning casually back against the stone wall and wrapping his arms loosely around bent knees, grin wicked as ever.  John narrows his eyes.  Rosie laughs and laughs.  “We never did find a use for the Pink Lemonade at Baker Street—thought it’d do rather nicely for the front door,”  Good
He sighs, eyes closed.  Mouth wet on my neck. Arm stretched, fingers grasping for the bedside table, returning with the bottle of lube in hand.  I sit up, watch him intently.
“Reminds me of our first case, this place.  Hope,”  He seems to roll the word around on his tongue, as though he’s never uttered it before in his life.  It takes Sherlock a moment to grasp what John is saying.  Hope.  Jeff Hope.  The man who’d convinced Sherlock to gamble his life.  Well, one of them.  John hadn’t given this one the chance.  “I think about that day sometimes, you know.  I’ve never understood, not really, why I followed you there.  Why I—”  He cuts himself off, stares back down at his plate.  “You’d have been fine.”
“I’d like to sleep with you again.  Is that all right?” My heart leaps at his blunt words.  I hadn’t even considered going back to our separate sleeping arrangements.  I’ve been fantasizing all evening about crawling into bed with him tonight—and every night hereafter, if he’ll allow it.
“A nightmare.”
“No worries, mate,”  Greg takes in the sight of him now that he’s settled, noting that he looks a bit less of a sunken wreck than he had on Christmas.  It’s only been two weeks, but there’s a notable improvement.  “All right?”  He asks carefully, more than a bit curious why he’d asked Greg here in the first place.
Well all right, then.
By the time we get back to the cottage, it’s nearing ten o’clock.  My parents retire to their bedroom with a smile and a hushed
“We still on for Angelo’s tonight, then?”

Harry leaves after breakfast (
He is utterly spellbound—more charmed than he’s ever been in his entire bloody life.  He feels as though those tendrils of potential have taken root right here in their sitting room floor and blossomed into something beautiful between them.  He sways forward, carefully plucking the instrument from elegant, trembling hands and setting it gently in its case where it rests on Sherlock’s chair.
After dinner, Molly and Tom must set off for Croydon..  As we stand at the door saying our goodbyes, Molly kisses my cheek, whispers in my ear.  “I’m so happy for you,” She says. “You deserve this, you know,” I pull back to stare at her, unsure how to respond.  I don’t agree, but I’ve been working on trying to. I don’t believe that anyone deserves John, least of all me, but I am becoming more comfortable with the fact that he’s chosen me nevertheless.
He glances at the time.  One minute past midnight.
John and I sit perched shoulder to shoulder in between two skips across the street from the mechanic’s shop.  All is quiet in the flat upstairs. We’ve been here for nearly an hour now, and no one has come or gone. No lights on, no movement--nobody’s home.
“I want everything.  That’s what I’m afraid of,” I pause, consider my next words carefully.  “You already are everything to me, John. I want to be partners, in every sense of the word.  I want you to move back home. I want to discover sex with you and then wake up next to you. Cook meals together, laugh together, settle back into our own sort of domesticity, interrupted constantly by the work.  I want to run around London with you until our legs will no longer carry us. And then live quietly with you in the country somewhere. And I’ve been hesitant to voice this aloud because I’m afraid you won’t want the same, or at least not all of it.  Afraid I’m asking for too much. Afraid I’ll be horrible at this and destroy my relationship with you, the person I hold most dear. Afraid to hand over my heart, although to be fair, you’ve already had it for a very long time. I want us to belong to each other.  But I don’t know how much of this I’m actually capable of. It’s a risk, John.”
“Sherlock—“
When John rushes forward to meet him—fingers clutching at Sherlock’s cheeks and tilting his head until they fit together like they were always meant to—all lingering reservations, already dulled by alcohol, seem to fly straight out the window.  Perhaps John is simply seeking comfort in him, to soothe an aching heart.  But that's alright, isn't it?  They’d been inching their way toward this, he thinks, before.  Before he’d left.  Before he’d died and made everything awful for the both of them.
she’d said.
He swallows, throat going a bit tight.
“You, Sherlock,”  I freeze—a deer caught in the proverbial headlights.  Not entirely sure I’ve heard her call me solely by my first name before.  Sounds a bit—odd. Casual. Has she truly let her guard down or is this part of her game?  What could
“Comfortable, John.  I trust you, of course—but—” Sherlock nearly whispers.  John smiles, nods his understanding.  Perhaps even his acceptance—?
“God, you’re bloody brilliant,” John stands off to the side, arms crossed and grinning.  God, it feels incredible to be here again. Swooping around a crime scene, showing off for him.  His ridiculous praises shooting straight through my chest and deep into my thundering heart.
We pick up Thai and head to 221B.  We almost never spend time at John’s flat.  It’s a nice place, and it’s been their home for years—but it never feels quite right.  Tonight we forgo the kitchen—John and I sit side by side on the couch, boxes of food spread out on the coffee table.  Rosie has gone straight for her stash of colouring books—I’ve kept a constant supply of them for her here—and sits crosslegged on the floor, eating noodles with one hand and colouring in a picture of a clown holding an umbrella with the other.  John watches her.
But John has some ideas.
“Was it a good day?”  A question only a five year old would ask.  No inquiries about logistics, only wanting to be sure that we’d had a nice day.
He is everything John could ever hope to find in another person.
It’s Friday afternoon, and it seems that we have nowhere to be until tomorrow evening.  In my research over the past week, I’ve found little useful information on our future friend (eventual suspect?) Holling Collins—he seems to be quite adept at flying under the radar.  And we are entirely unsure about this Maude character that we’re going to meet. I did find that Mr. Collins is a mere thirty three years of age, however. Hadn’t seen that coming. We’re practically old men—over a decade older than this person we’re meant to befriend.  I think of myself at that age. Still entirely alone—the world a dark, unfriendly place. I never could have guessed that just one year later, John would come along and light it up.
I don't have adequate words for what I’m feeling, so I say nothing, only snake an arm around his waist and hold him a bit tighter.  I shift down and press my cheek to his chest, feel his heartbeat beneath the thin layer of cotton separating our flesh. If this is what he can give me—this invitation into his personal space and affection in the form of physical touch, then I will gladly accept.  If we can have this—can
“The real reason,”  He repeats flatly, voice and features uninterested—but his eyes give him away.
“Oh come on.  We can see how far into the Oath of Allegiance we can get before being forcibly hauled off to the Stranger’s Room.  Could be dangerous.” His eyes sparkle menacingly, savage blue. My heart expands in my chest, seeing him like this.  A bit of the soldier shining through. Have barely caught a glimpse of that part of him in recent days, and it causes a wicked flurry of warmth to shoot through my ribcage and straight to my groin.  I feel a godless grin spreading slowly across my face and John stares fearlessly back at me, responding with a smirk full of heat and promise.

seeking reassurance.  It’s incredibly tedious.
“But it isn’t helping,”  Not a question.  It hadn't helped their mother, either.  She was much too far gone.  Unreachable, in the end.  “Have you told her this?  Maybe she could—”  He isn’t listening.  Harry trails off, watching him sit right in front of her, knowing full well that he’s miles away.  “John—”

I feel lighter and more calm than I have in ages.  And grateful. Relieved. It’s with thoughts of my good fortune drifting steadily through my mind that I fall into sleep, looking forward—for once—to whatever comes next.
“Not sure what you mean,”  Henry mutters, slumped in his seat across the table, clearly not believing his own words.
“We’ll know soon enough,” I nod toward the street, as three unmarked black vans speed by.  “That’ll be Mycroft’s team of gun-toting lunatics.”
“Sherlock,”  John pulls me from my thoughts with a hand on my knee.  We’d put Rosie to bed an hour ago, and now sit in our chairs, each lost in our own heads.  He’s comfortable with my long silences—is prone to his own bouts of distant pondering—although, as ever, he’s more anchored in reality than I ever have been.  “I want to ask you something,” I wait for him to continue. He knows that he can ask me anything. “Are you comfortable with me calling you my partner? I think we’re a bit old for

By the time we pull into the driveway, I am thoroughly regretting my moment of empathy.  The ride back was largely silent, and my mind is filled with the crushing realization that I’ve just signed John up to share my bed for the night.  Didn’t even discuss it with him, to see if he’s all right with it. Didn’t even consider what it will mean for
--yes.  I think a gathering at 221B is just the thing.  Mrs. Hudson? Would you like to be first on the guest list?”
“It was hardly a choice.  Never really is though, is it?”  I suppose not. Perhaps Irene had fallen victim to the same sort of inexplicable human connection that John and myself have found.  Despite my frigid nature and his attraction to females, here we are. I look at him now, a warm presence at my side—let my fingers drift through his soft silver hair, coming to rest on the back of his neck.  He smiles to himself, leans against me, winds an arm around the small of my back. If I lost him now, I’d be ruined. If this is what Irene had found in Isla—if this is what she’s lost—
“John,” She says, voice soft, serious.  “I’ve wanted to ask—“ She pauses for a moment, probably to see if he intends to interrupt.  When he says nothing, she continues.  “Are things—is it all right?  Everything between you two, now that you’re—together.  Now that you’ve—“  She huffs, annoyed with herself.  John watches patiently as she rocks back on her stool where they sit at the butcher block surrounded by a rainbow of baked goods, then sighs, drops forward, runs a hand through her hair.  “I’m rubbish at this.  Just—it’s been awhile, now.  You’ve had time for the shine to wear off, to get comfortable.  Or—not.  Sometimes it’s—well you know.  Clara and I married before we really knew each other and you saw how that worked out.  And with—Mary, you never seemed—“ She sighs, glancing up at him.  “I’m not saying that it—it’s different, of course.  You and him.  You’ve got history.  And you both seem—good,”  She lets out a nervous giggle when John just raises his brows in response.  “Very good, actually.  But.  You know.”
—and really, I never do.  It’s odd for me, too. I may be flattered if it weren’t coming from such an intolerable tosser.  I hand him my mobile. “Well, you are that,” He says, eyes scanning the screen. “A challenge, I mean,”  He shoots me a grin when I narrow my eyes. I suppose he has a point.
I jerk awake—take in my surroundings.  In bed. With John. The beach house. Right.  A soft knock on the door. Must have been what woke me.

need it.  They need this new beginning.  He had seen that when John hadn’t.  “Anyway, the bedframe was built by my grandfather.  My parents have kept it in storage for decades, and I fished it out and had it refinished.  The mattress is new—obviously,”  He smirks.
—so not entirely surprising.
Unwilling to be the bearer of such a dark theory.
Sherlock thinks,
By the time six o’clock rolls around, we’ve got everything prepped and ready to go.  Toppings chopped, dough rising, wine chilling. Molly is the first to arrive. I open the door to find her fidgeting and smiling nervously--same as it ever was--so I wrap her up in hug.  “Hello, Molly. Please come in.”
“I should go,”  He mutters at last, standing abruptly, chair screeching across the floor as he shoves it back and out of his path.  “Thanks for—”  He waves a hand toward the table, immediately turning toward the door to fetch his jacket, shrugging it quickly onto his shoulders.
“You’ve had migraines before?”
“Yeah,”  Greg says, pulling her into a proper embrace.  “But you can’t do much for a man who’s chosen to cling to something that’s no longer there, Molls.”

“Start talking,”  John commands, moving swiftly to stand behind me, placing both hands firmly on my shoulders.  Protective. Ready for action. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Captain Watson make an appearance.
“You want to see--”
“Fine,” I say.  I couldn’t care less.
and there’s a profound silence between them now.  John holds his breath.

“No.  Definitely not regretful.”
“How will this work?”  I ask instead. Will he stay over only occasionally?  Will we alternate flats? Does he want this sort of thing every night, or only when the mood strikes?  Will we try to take it further, or are we simply bedmates now? Is he going to begin dating women again eventually?  What am I to him, exactly? Too many unknowns. We should have discussed this before.
Time passes.  Sherlock loses track as he drifts in and out, the last lingering remnants of the migraine gradually dissipating.  John’s hand still rests warmly against his neck, steady puffs of breath still felt against the thin fabric of the t-shirt Sherlock had spent the night sweating through.  John doesn’t seem to mind.  Sherlock spends each quiet moment committing this to memory—every point of contact between them, every swoop of his heart when John’s fingers knead gently into the skin of his neck, their mingled scents, the light beginning to slink through the tightly closed curtains.  All of it.  He won’t forget this.  Not ever.
, Sherlock--” I realize I’m frantic.  Eyes wild, scanning John’s body for signs of harm--arms flailing against his grip, panic rising, heart clenching.  I can barely breathe. “Shit, he’s shot himself--Sherlock, we’re fine,” His hands on my face, forcing me to look him in the eye.  “Listen, we’re
Do I want that?  “Let me--think on it.  For a bit.”
And that’s still true.  Mostly.  And it’s fine.  Because John is certain, even now, that he himself would not need much more than the intimacy that naturally exists between them.  What he’s seeking is a more open version of it.  Honesty, for one.  Acknowledgement.  Commitment.  And physicality, maybe.  Not sex, necessarily—he’s pretty positive that sex isn’t ever going to be something Sherlock wants—just...affection.  Less of the forced distance between them.  Permission to curl himself around the man, to reach for his hand, brush his fingers through his curls, press his lips to his temple.  Things that he’s always felt a pull toward.  Things John believes—now that he’s come back (a bit softer, a bit quieter)—that Sherlock wants too.
“I don’t have any friends left in this town, thanks to him,”  He looks worn down. Like someone who’s been rejected by the world.  He looks like I did, at that age.

are on full display.  I’ve never fully learned how to hide them.
Six minutes have gone by, the dots appearing every so often—but still nothing.  Perhaps this is a lost cause. I suppose I could just do this alone. Alone is what I have, these days.  Alone protects me. But I’d rather have him there. My ulterior motives aside, he’d be an indispensable asset on this case.
“You think he is?”
“What do you think?”  He wants to go. My ability to read facial cues may not be nearly as developed as his own, but I can see his eagerness quite clearly.  I smile.
Should invite him in.
A wall of rain batters incessantly against their sitting room window for the third solid day in a row, turning Baker Street into one massive puddle and obliterating each of Sherlock’s carefully thought out plans.  Tedious.  Inconvenient.
“All right,”  John smiles as he stands, promising himself that he’ll find a way to bring this up with Sherlock later.  “Lead on.”
Sherlock’s lips move against John’s neck, arms tucked beneath his shoulders, fingers still woven into short silver hair.  Tugging lightly on mussed curls until he lifts his head, John kisses him hard—sharing this immense relief, this gratitude and reverence—the riotous swell of love that churns within his chest.  Sherlock seems to dissolve into him entirely, responding in a way that has John lost once again.
in his ear, Sherlock is quite right.  John had no intention of being the one to end the conversation—he’d have talked nonsense all night just to avoid saying goodbye.
“Baker Street is yours, Sherlock.  I’m more than happy to help with whatever you decide to do—and really I can’t think of a better way to use the space—but you don’t need my permission to move forward,”  Sherlock scowls, and John finds himself lifting his brow in confusion.
“Sally,” Sherlock says simply, reaching his long limbs around John to pluck the freshly made cup of tea from the worktop, lifting it swiftly over John’s head and then cringing dramatically when he burns his tongue.
“Hi, Sherlock,” She babbles animatedly.  “I miss you. Are you in Dad’s bed?” I can’t help but laugh.  I turn to John—he can handle this one.

“What do you think about having our friends over for dinner tonight?”  John asks as we sit in our chairs, sipping coffee and each browsing a section of the paper.  I look up at him, wondering what on Earth brought on this idea. He narrows his eyes at me. “In two days we’ll be announcing publicly that we’re an item.  Amongst other things. I think we should tell the people we actually like, first,” Ah. Yes, I suppose we really should.
“Unfortunately, yes.  Evidently there’s information on the flash drive that we absolutely must see for ourselves.”
“Come on,” He’s got an arm around my waist and he’s half dragging me, half holding me up.  I slump into bed and pull John down on top of me. Wrap my string beans around him tight. String beans?  Shoe laces. “Let me go.”
John’s heart stops, breath caught in his throat, his thumbs tremble where they hover over the keypad as the three little dots appear once again.  They taunt him as the moment drags on for five seconds, ten—
“John,” I snap, startling him when I drop down on the couch, grabbing his shoulders and demanding his full attention.  “You kept this from me. Why?” I need his perspective. Need to know why he and my imbecilic brother believed they were doing me a favour by omitting this rather large detail.  He stares at me blankly.
Sherlock sets his (empty) styrofoam boxes in a haphazard pile on the coffee table, stretching his arms upward, back arching until his spine quietly cracks.  He sighs, feeling full, sated, and lets his body fall to the side.  He curls up into the smallest space he can manage, lest John feel unwelcome and leave his immediate vicinity, and the soles of his feet rest against John’s solid thigh.  He flexes his toes a bit, knowing somehow that it’ll be felt as a gesture of warmth, of appreciation, and hears the expected tiny huff of laughter from John, followed by a soft palm on his ankle.
A wide grin, now.  “You broke your bloody promise, too,”  He runs the pads of his fingers over my shoulder, down my back.
“She—so?  Why shouldn’t she?”  Sherlock only stares back at him, opening his mouth slightly then closing it once more, lips pressed in a thin line.  “Sherlock,”  John sighs.  “We’ll talk today, all right?  We need to have a conversation,”  His only response is a single nod.  “Did you sleep?”
John insists on driving, which is fine by me, and we head off through the redwoods towards town.  He wasn’t wrong about the car. It is, in fact,
and he slides gracefully back in his chair and stands too, taking a step toward John.
“You’re bloody right about that, but you're a dick for saying so,”  He inhales, plodding on determinedly.  “We never really talk through anything, Sherlock, do we?  It’s a problem, I think.  If I’d just told you that I left Mary a week after you’d returned, despite being furious with you, we wouldn’t have needed our meddling friends and all that bloody vodka to find our way here.  If I had just
“It isn’t safe,”  John stomps through the front door, holding it open for me and glaring as I traipse in behind him.  “It would be a reckless, idiotic thing to do. We don’t know what he’s capable of.  We aren’t armed.  We aren’t prepared at all,” He turns to face me, looking tense. He’s grown much more concerned about such things since Rosie entered his life.
John stays.  We put Rosie to bed upstairs, each pressing our lips to her forehead and pulling the door closed with a soft

I’m the first to tumble over the edge.  Shouting and gasping his name, I erupt onto his chest, collapsing against him as he continues to drive up into me.  He wraps his arms around my body, cock buried deep, and cries out, once, twice, hips jerking as he comes—
So I do.
“This is
uninvited as well.  He snaps his fingers at a stony-faced Adam, who sets a fresh drink down in front of him.  Whiskey, by the smell of his breath as he spits an endless stream of words at us. He does love to hear himself speak.
When his limbs regain the ability to hold hip upright, John turns to me, reaching down to return the favor.  I bat his hand away. “No,” He looks up at me, puzzled. “Watch,” I say. “A demonstration.” His expression turns a touch predatory, as he watches me slide my hand down my abdomen and along my own cock.  “I’ll show you
he’d said.
My emotions are running high after this eye-opening conversation.  I want to reach out for John, but after my unwanted drunken (and public) advances last night, I’m hesitant to try to initiate anything.  He hasn’t moved away though, our mouths close, breaths steady. I lean in tentatively--testing the waters--and caress his bottom lip between mine.  Lightly, gently. Immediately, his hands come up to my cheeks and he deepens the kiss, accepting my uncertain invitation.
Below the loft is a small, modern loo and just beside it a large, open kitchen—tall cupboards stained a deep burgundy lining two of the walls.  Beneath them is a concrete worktop, brushed copper stove and refrigerator, and an absurdly large butcher block island in the center of it all.
was invited in each of the eight emails that I received over the last year, requesting our assistance in California.  I look up at John, sitting across from me at the kitchen table. He’s got a cup of tea in one hand and the baguette in the other.  He brushes a crumb off of his jumper with a pinky finger and then glances up, meeting my eyes. A swooping feeling in my chest. A fluttering in my gut.  Ever present, when he’s nearby. I clear my throat. “Thank you,” I rumble. The words feel foreign on my tongue. They don’t get much use, from me. “For being here.”  He smiles. A real one.
“I know you’ll tell John,” I’ve got to.  “But please, no one else.” He doesn’t want our parents to know.  I don’t blame him. They’d treat him as if he were already dead. He walks to the door, takes his coat from the hook--
“I miss you,”  John says quietly, his voice cracking miserably as though the words themselves are painful to say.  Sherlock’s head snaps up, surprised.  He tosses the shell.
They’d reached out last month on the anniversary of Sherlock’s fall and were ignored entirely, a week later receiving a vague apology and a claim that he’s been busy with work.  They’d sent him an invitation to the housewarmingslashholiday party that they’re throwing on Christmas Day and didn’t hear back at all.
Please let me know if you're liking it.  Not sure if I'll keep going with this one or pause it to jump back into one of my (several) other stories that are waiting to be finished.
The trap door in the closet and silo basement below are based on an old house I lived in when I was 20 that had that exact set up.  It was creepy as hell.  No bodies, though.
“Well I’d assumed to keep it available for you, dear, should you choose to go away for a bit.  It is your home, after all.  He’s also keeping Sherlock’s things up there, isn’t he?  At least until he gets around to moving them.  The man has more money than he knows what to do with.  Paid two years out—honestly, so unnecessary.  At some point you have to think he’s just being a bit of a show-off…”  John isn’t listening.  Martha leaves him be, poking her head in the oven to check on the blaas.  Perfect.  Golden brown with a lovely crust.  She plops the pan down on the stovetop to cool and continues working her way through the dishes.
“Alert him!” The taller of the two shouts to the driver as he makes his exit.
“Ah—yep,”  He says grinning widely at the puzzled look on her face.

I love him. “I love you,” He makes a little noise in the back of his throat.  Did he not know? “In case you somehow weren’t aware. I love you.”
“You know I’m not gay,” John says softly.
“Are all of your talking points going to be this imbecilic?”  Sherlock asks, his tone teasing.  He crosses one leg over the other, relaxing into his chair at last and taking a deep, steadying breath before launching into a rather elaborate response.  “Really, John, what do you think?  Did you truly believe there was a chance I’d want to spend another night apart from you?  As I’ve told you, I want everything you’re willing to give.  I meant it when I said that I haven’t got any boundaries with you.  And before you ask—yes
“Oh, well—”  John turns to meet my eyes, looking a bit wary.  I smile. I know this story well.
Instead, he reaches out.

large room—clearly a workshop of some sort in a past life.  The back and left walls are lined with low cabinets topped with well-worn concrete worktops, similar to those in the kitchen.  There’s a large metal sink built in on the far left.  Beside it sits a brand new, rather clinical looking refrigerator—Sherlock’s own addition, surely.
“Sorry—”  Greg cuts in, effectively bursting the bubble that had formed around the two of them.  “Are you two…?”  John’s awareness of their current position comes rushing in.  He glances down at their joined hands and then back up at Lestrade, realizing he hadn’t even thought twice about reaching out to Sherlock the second he seemed even slightly distressed.
It’s been a long day.  A long, exhausting, life-altering day.  They’ve had quite a few of those lately.  Now four walls, a locked door and a blanket of sleep separate them from their (adorably) demanding daughter, leaving the two of them to lie face to face, duvet pulled up over their heads—quite alone for the first time all day.
is who Irene would choose to love,”  Ben lets out a huff of laughter, shaking his head.
When she cracks open the door, she finds him standing right there, as though considering whether to knock or disappear upstairs as he usually does.  When their eyes meet, he seems to internally crumble, so she ushers him inside without question, guiding him straight to the kitchen table and pushing him none-too-gently down into a chair.
He’s laughing, he realizes—breathy giggles and a slowly growing grin.  Sherlock’s returning smile sets his already precarious emotions on fire.
—He won’t respond, he doesn’t need to.  He knows what I mean—what this means for us.  He’s entrusting John with my wellbeing, now. Always has, to some extent.
“Might do, yeah.  Problem?”  He squeezes Sherlock’s fingers tightly, then lets them go, hand falling to his side.  “It’s perfect, Sherlock.  God, it’s ridiculously, impossibly perfect,”  He shakes his head in a futile attempt to hide the foolish smile that’s stretched across his face.  “What do you think, kid?”  He turns to Rosie, who’s kneeling on the sofa, arms folded over the back, watching them intently.
John thinks, staring down at his mobile.  What is this, then?  Sherlock doesn’t say things like this.  Sweet things.  Warm things.  Honest things, even.  Neither of them do, though he wishes more than anything that they could, that they would.  The man has been back from the dead for three solid months and all they’ve managed to do is rage at each other for a full week and then return to the way things were before.  Or some version of it, anyway.  John certainly hadn’t wasted any time moving back to Baker Street, despite the lingering resentment and emotional unrest simmering between them.

“You've got yourself an admirer.”
“Are you my boyfriend?”  John jumps at Sherlock’s words, sloshing the tea he’d been pouring into a puddle across the worktop and cursing quietly.  He’s bloody snuck up on him again.  Didn’t even hear him return from the Yard, where he’d been summoned by Lestrade.  He had insisted John stay home with Rosie rather than bother Molly
We’ve settled in on the couch, side by side, laptops on our knees.  Determined to find a case that’s at least a five. As I’m scanning the blog, scowling at the amount of time-wasting idiots, (
—certainly never knew my brother before he became what he is today.  He’s warmer, now. Still completely insufferable, but Lestrade has thawed him, a bit.  Right on cue, his smug face enters the screen, Lestrade back by his side.
And who knows how many others.  I open my eyes, look up at him.
“Not really, no,”  A long sigh. He sits up, turns toward me on the bed.  “I’d rather pretend it isn’t happening at all. But I suppose the sooner it’s solved, the sooner we can put it behind us.  And word on the street is you’re somewhat decent at this sort of thing,” A smile quirks the corner of his mouth. Cute, John.  Belittling my genius for your own amusement, how clever. “What do you want to do though? Are you ready to jump into a case?”
“Yep,”  Her sprained ankle is feeling worse today, supposedly, but John is fairly certain she’s just being tetchy out of anxiety about what lies ahead.  She’s always been that way, and he’s quite used to it.  It’s probably what’s allowed him to tolerate Sherlock’s moods for so long.  He smiles at the thought.  He’s been doing a lot of that today.
“Love you,” John whispers, voice barely audible over the still-roaring shower.  The words come easily now—he wonders vaguely why it was ever so difficult for them when the feeling was always there.
“Tell you?”
appreciate you giving my Henry a place to stay.  We do have our little spats—I’m sure you understand,”  He sits, uninvited, on the empty barstool beside John, who tightens his grip on my arms.  “Anyway, he said you were the most gracious of hosts. Said the cottage you’re renting is just

He drops back down on the chair, head in hands.
I'm supposed to meet someone. I have a dinner. Reservations, you know."
I slip my hand under his shirt, up his chest—brush across his scar, lightly circle a nipple.  Slowly run my palm back down his side to his hip. I slide my fingers through a belt loop and pull him closer.  Unfasten his jeans and slip my fingers down his pants. Stroke him firmly, steadily, as he hardens in my hand. He watches me closely, panting lightly.  Tucks an errant curl gently behind my ear.
But now, he thinks, it’s time.
it.  It doesn’t suit them.
He’s pulled gently from his thoughts by long fingers on his shoulder.  When he meets Sherlock’s gaze, he knows immediately that he’d be wise to steel himself and get his emotions in check.
I run my knuckles over his brow.  Slide the pads of my fingers over the creased corners of his smiling eyes.  Wipe the tears from his cheeks with a brush of my thumb.
us anything, Sherlock.  But I thought that we were in this together.  I thought we’d established that a long time ago,”  John can feel the tears welling up now.  He turns away, watches Rosie carefully drawing shapes in the sand with a stick.
Sherlock’s body had decreased in mass while away, and despite the frustration that accompanies John’s gentle nagging, even Sherlock can admit that his current weight is a bit worrisome.  He’d endured many things, but the most damaging—and imagine his surprise at the realization—had been the loneliness, the complete desolation he’d experienced once he’d torn himself away from this life for two miserable years.
.  The drawn out drag of friction is igniting every one of my senses, waves of heat rippling through my gut and twisting up beneath my ribcage.
“I was,” John tightens his grip on my hand.  Strong and reassuring. “It was a bad time. And as I’m sure you know, it was short lived.”
“Wow,”  She breathes.  She doesn’t know of the small fortune Mrs. Hudson has left to Sherlock—this must seem like an impossible occurrence.
“Yeah, we will.  There’s no timeline we need to follow—for any of this,”  He stands, tired of the space between them that felt so necessary ten minutes ago.  “Come on,”  He heads for the chesterfield nearest the fire, drops down sideways against the armrest and pulls Sherlock into the V of his legs, cocooning his gangly body against his chest.  John sighs under the warm weight of him, letting his fingers knead gently into the muscle of Sherlock’s shoulders.  He presses several small kisses to his temple as his eyes fall closed and a comfortable silence envelops them.
Sherlock wakes in the hour just after sunrise, glittering golden light flooding the cottage through the windows and the lingering, cosy scent of their long-dead fire wafting over from the grate.
I return his smile, guide him forward with a hand on the small of his back.  “No, I suppose not.”
“John,” Sherlock mumbles.  It isn’t a question and he doesn’t open his eyes to confirm that it is indeed John fretting at his bedside.  “Migraine,” He breathes out.
How could he have known, then, what he would find in John?
Eventually I stretch a bit, roll off of him to lie on my side.  He slides down to face me. We silently stare at one another. Warm blue eyes, locked on mine.
He brings his hand up to brush back a fallen curl, runs his palm down Sherlock’s jawline, the pad of his thumb smoothing gently over a flushed cheek.
John comes back upstairs shortly after Mycroft leaves.  “Hey, I heard--” He stops, hesitates, then strides over and sits down next to me.  “What is it?” He breathes.
I never told him why.  “You were more lost than I’d ever seen you.  Completely inconsolable. You wouldn’t see me for ages—you weren’t even taking cases.  I thought something had happened—I thought that she had—”
“We’ll talk tonight,”  Sherlock says quietly as he runs the towel through his hair, then tosses it to John.  “But as far as boundaries go, I’m not sure that I have any with you,”  John rolls his eyes, grinning and feeling warm all over.  He doesn’t find that entirely impossible to believe—Sherlock’s idea of boundaries has always been more lax than the average human’s.  But he remains certain that they’ll need to have a conversation—to decide what’s next for them, to maintain the open communication they’d worked so hard to achieve.
“You believed me dead,”  For over two years. We don’t speak of that time anymore.
Lestrade arrives shortly after seven.  “Smells bloody fantastic in here,” He’s in good spirits when he tromps through the door, throwing his jacket on the arm of the couch and plopping down casually next to it.  “Thought you two would be feeding us some sort of French something or other. Snails, maybe.”
God, I love him, the idiot.  He knew I needed to hear that.  I cup my hand around his nape, hold him close.  Pour all of my gratitude and staggering affection into a vehement kiss.  When we break apart at last, he’s smiling. Resumes his gentle brushing through my curls.  I begin at the end.
We head back inside.  I pace through each room again, looking for inconsistencies.  Something that doesn’t
Sherlock reaches out and slowly pulls John toward him, immediately dropping his wrist and winding an arm around the small of his back.  John lets himself collapse, leaning contentedly against his best friend’s chest, cheek to the skin of his throat.  He slowly slides his own arms around Sherlock’s waist, attempting futilely to tune out the countdown around them.  This moment is precious, and he intends to cherish it.
The woman who opens the door immediately narrows her eyes.  “Yes?” She demands, face tired, worn. And thoroughly suspicious.
She’s clearly a bit taken aback  by my warm welcome, but seems to relax a bit as she shuffles inside.  “This is exciting, isn’t it? It’ll be just like that Christmas we all spent here--I mean, hopefully not
His gaze drifts upward, taking in the vaulted ceiling, painted white and slanting straight up past the lofted second floor, dark wooden support beams following its slope.  A cast iron spiral staircase stands toward the back of the large room, off to their right.  John tracks its path to the upper level, where it meets a thick wooden banister that spans the length of the loft.
This is the person who should have been the sole recipient of his affections since the day they stumbled into each others’ lives.  Instead he’d been the target of John’s misguided rage, his literal punching bag and
There are long, sheer white curtains on the window, making this space feel more finished than the others they’ve roamed through thus far—still, it feels...lacking.  Not quite right.  The only other object in the room is a brown leather armchair to the left of the door, with a single towel draped over it.
Now John sits close, very close, always very close.  He smiles at Sherlock in their quiet moments together and lets their eyes lock and their gaze linger on and on and on and on.  He’s never the first to break.  It’s always Sherlock who begins to feel the fluttering panic, the palpitating heart, to sense that John has something more to say.  But he never does.  And Sherlock always, eventually, looks away.
Eyes closed once more, he feels Sherlock drop down beside him, smiling when long fingers card gently through his hair.
Now, when he looks back at that time, he mostly finds the feelings of relief and disbelief he’d been drowning in once Sherlock had returned.  John may have been making all the wrong decisions, but the mad bastard had stubbornly stayed a part of his life despite all that—had been there for him in whatever way he felt he could.  Now John is trying desperately to be that person for him—his support system, his partner, his bloody cheerleader if that’s what he needs.  He thinks he may even be succeeding.  They both are, against all odds.
“All right, all right, my god,”  Greg laughs, holding his hands up in surrender.  “Christ, I’m about to have a bloody heart attack, give me a minute,”  He looks between the two of them, smile nearly splitting his face in two.  “You’ve got me struck a bit dumb here,”  Sherlock rolls his eyes.  “How did this happen, then?”
He's squeezing my hands so tight, I can hardly feel my fingers.  "I can't believe this," his brow is furrowed, shaking his head, like he's confused.  It is confusing. I don't know what to do now, John. "I've spent two years in mourning, Sherlock."  His voice breaks on my name. I wonder how long it's been since he's said it aloud. "I don't know what to do with that grief, now."
“Your name is on the deed.”
know,”  He hisses.  “And I need you to tell us.  You can go ahead and toss whatever secret society bollocks is keeping you quiet,”  Mycroft rolls his eyes. “We’ve got reason to believe Hal is dangerous—violent—and he’s got his eye on Sherlock,”  Is that all this is, then? He thinks
It still feels surreal, being allowed into this realm of Sherlock’s world—experiencing these things—some of them for the first time—together.  John doesn’t actually know what he’s doing—the angle is odd and he hasn’t yet learned what Sherlock likes—but it hardly matters.  It feels as though the presence of the other is all either of them really needs just now.
He understands.  He always does.
,” Offended by the very suggestion.  “Sherlock--my savings are dwindling, we aren’t taking cases--not really--you’ve only just come back from the bloody dead.  How are we going to afford to live?” Feisty when he’s hungry, my John. I suppose I could tell him of the trust fund my family has recently restored my access to.  I’d been cut off during the drugs phase,
“Yes, well.  He isn’t a sociopath.  So there’s that.”
“Is this one mine?”
He plays John’s body like his violin, slow and smooth, intuitive and tender.
“I don’t want you to be alone with him,”  He slides his hand down to my jaw, fingers brushing my skin as he watches me carefully.  “Sherlock, he’s tried to drug you once already. Nearly succeeded—
.  I tilt my head back and his hands come up to run gently through my curls, as he continues to press his lips to my neck.  My skin prickles pleasantly beneath the heat of his wet, wicked mouth.
“What have you two got on then?  Another case?  Already?”  John has stepped out into the living room to make the call, knowing full well that if he doesn’t Sherlock will hijack the conversation to ask about recent deaths and infected body parts—as he so often does when it’s Molly on the line.
When I head downstairs, leaving a dozing John behind me, I see that my Belstaff is hanging on its hook where it belongs.  I’m positive I had left it in a heap on the floor when I tripped through the door last night and was heaved into bed. My heart swells at the thought of John, furious and wronged, stopping on his way upstairs to hang it in its right place.  Guarding my beloved coat from harm even when he couldn’t stand the sight of me. I don’t deserve you, John.
The bed stands in the middle of the room, ornate wrought iron headboard against the far wall.  A small brass table on either side. The centre of the mattress has burned through almost entirely, but not quite.  The springs remain, visible through the large, egg-shaped hole. The base of the bed frame is iron as well—unusual—and this is where the ashes lie.
for no reason other than to be away, together, for a while.  Somewhere new.
When we arrive at the station, I scan the crowds, eyes landing on the man standing stoically against a pillar near the entrance.  A quiet man, my father. Reserved and kind. Our resemblance is strong, and when John follows my gaze, he lets out a quiet “Wow,” and smiles up at me.  “No one’s going to question whether you’re kin, are they?”
“Yes, well, nothing new there.  At least you’re nice to look at--” I dodge the Union Jack pillow he’s just tossed at me from where he sits in his chair.  “Really, John, so juvenile.”
After a long moment of calm, I hear a small huff of laughter to my left.  I glance over in time to watch a giggle bubble up in his chest and tumble out of his mouth.  I raise my eyebrows, thoroughly amused, as another burst breaks through the confines of his lips, skittering out over the open water, vibrating through my chest and settling deep into my heart.  Oh, John. Finding only humour in a moment that calls for solemnity. We lock eyes, his are shining. Bright and brilliant, they reflect the setting sun. Watching him now, trying in vain to control his sudden burst of glee—I feel a wide smile creep across my own face.  I have come to cherish these ridiculous moments.
A good lead-in.  Broad. One can respond as specifically or as vaguely as they need.  I could be vague. Tell him I’d like to
John’s traitorous heart leaps violently at her words, even as he rolls his eyes.  Because he’s
Sherlock’s deep laughter is like a balm to John’s soul—filled with amused relief and something like delight.
What are you all up to?
“Yeah?” He’s been watching me.  Observing my spiraling thoughts, my furrowed brow, as I contemplate my next words.
It’s Lestrade.  Another murder. It seems that we indeed have an active serial killer on our hands.  I can’t help the burst of excitement in my chest at this news—it’s been ages since we’ve had a real challenge.  John is reading over my shoulder, hand resting warmly on the small of my back. We share a knowing glance as my fingers fly deftly over buttons, refastening my fluttering shirt and tucking it hurriedly back into my trousers.  He follows me to the entryway, pulling on our jackets in tandem, locking eyes and communicating silently about what’s ahead, what we’re about to walk into. He reaches up, runs his palm over my cheek, down the side of my neck, then drops it back down to fling open the door.  Together, we descend—seventeen steps—and rush out the front door and into the unknown.
“Shit,”  She breathes.  “Shit.”
“I—the owner owes me a favour, so—you
Around eight, Lestrade walks Mrs. Hudson down to her flat on his way out.  They thank us for a lovely time, and we hug them tightly when they go. Harry lingers.  She’s retrieved the small wrapped package she’d brought with her from where I’d set it on the mantle.  She hands it to John. “Go on, then.”
“Do you know who we are?” I demand without preamble.  The sight that greeted us as we marched through the door was of a man looking discouragingly worn down and defeated.  Slumped in a plastic chair, arms hanging between his knees. Cuffs and chains connecting ankles to wrists, his head bowed to the floor and eyes closed tight.  No response. “Ajay. Do you know who this is?”
“Ah, no,”  John says quickly.  Bit rude.  Should be kinder to his workmates.  Has only been at this clinic for a few months, should be trying a bit harder to make friends.  He scrambles to snatch up the paperwork he’d been entering into the system, forgetting his sliced finger and smearing the folder with a thick smudge of blood.  “Not quite finished up here.  Sorry,”  He adds, belatedly.
Her big brother seemed almost content for the first time in his miserable life—and six months into their courtship, they married.  Linda Elizabeth Jones. Soon after, they purchased the house and moved to Sussex.
We pull up outside a small mechanic’s shop.  A rundown brick building, painted white. To the left, a chain link fence, and behind it a gravel lot containing dozens of rusting, inoperable vehicles.
I march out the back door, John not even glancing up as I walk by.  I find Ben, Adam and Danny standing around a charcoal grill, the scent of burgers and bratwurst mingling with the ocean air.  They wave me over, allow me to step into their circle.
Fine.  “John, you know my family has money.  They’ve opted to share some of it with me.  We’re fine,” He glares at me and I recall a conversation we’d had last week.  “Let’s set up a joint account.”
“You’re really going to do this?”  John. Shifting uneasily on my doorstep.  Fingers fidgeting with the hem of his grey wool jumper.  “What are the odds you’ll go off and get yourself killed?”
“Don’t be,”  He says, finally.  They quietly watch each other for much too long, John’s mind spinning, trying to think of something—anything—to say that will break this odd tension,  There’s something present in Sherlock’s eyes that John can’t quite define.  Before he has a chance to mutter anything of substance, Sherlock has leapt up, striding straight down the hall and slamming the door to the loo.  Right then.
Never before has he felt this profound need to flee their beloved London, to
“Yeah.  Yeah I—moved.  Camberwell.  And ah, cut back.  On the lager, that is.  And the rest of it.”
“An elaborate plan to destroy Sherlock’s reputation.  A game of wits—one that he clearly did not win.  In the end there were three snipers, trained on Martha Hudson, Gregory Lestrade, and you, Dr. Watson.  A grand finale to James Moriarty’s great game.  An ultimatum.  Sherlock jumped to spare your lives.  An easy decision for him, I assure you,”  John gapes, eyes wide, apparently absolutely horrified by this information.  Oh, hell.  He leaps up off the sofa, begins pacing the small room, both hands balled into tight fists at his sides.  After several minutes of this, he stops, turns to face Mycroft head on.
This chapter is a short one!  I spent a bunch of time rewriting the second half of chapter 21.  The kiss didn't read the way I wanted it to, and I couldn't move on without reworking it.  This is the kind of wishy-washy bullshit you can expect from my writing.  But it's much closer to how it plays out in my head now, so go reread if you'd like to feel a feeling.

Kenneth Jones has proven to be a difficult man to find.  He owned that house until 1987. Sold when he lost his job at the local industrial chemical plant.  Obvious. The drum. Last known address was a rental property only a few kilometres from here, but he hasn’t lived there in nearly a decade.  This is as far as the local police have gotten. I intend to go deeper.
I stare at the black and white checkered paper that lines our basket of chips.  Knee bouncing, restless, impatient. Where’s Lestrade? What time is it? Half seven, nearly.  Need to hear the details of this case they’ve got on. Why hadn’t he just texted me? Is it definitely a murder?  It’s probably only a three. If it were a five or above he’d have texted me. Maybe he doesn’t think I’m ready for a case?  Am I ready for a case? I think so, yes. I want one, anyway. I wonder if John is ready to jump back into the work. Where is John?  I glance up and see that he’s standing at the bar, chatting with the bartender, who’s batting her eyelashes at him. Nice try, idiot. He’s extremely taken.  By me. Now John is sliding back into our corner booth, two pints in hand.
“I’ll just be down here, then,” John says, retreating into Mrs. Hudson’s flat.  “Having a cuppa. Yeah, Mrs. H?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He can’t even say it, but I hear him.  Loud and clear.
Without hesitation, he slides an arm around my bare waist, pulling me toward him in the centre of the bed.  I weave my fingers through his soft grey hair and let my lips drift close to his. We spend hours—or perhaps minutes—lost in each other, learning this new language that we’ve given one another.  Time halts around us as we lie together, quietly breathing the same air.
They don’t speak.  Their movements quickly evolve into fumbling hands and shifting hips and desperate, ragged breaths.  Sherlock gasps and clings, barely recognizing himself like this, swamped with a desire he’s never known, with a staggering swell of emotion—barely recognizing John, who has dropped his walls, who is allowing himself, for once, to be
“If I’d known,” John begins, holding Sherlock’s hand even tighter, eyes returning to the water stained ceiling while his mind whirls through their past year together—his parade of failed dates and constant uncertainty about Sherlock’s interest in anyone, least of all him.  The building intimacy between them that never went beyond the platonic, despite how it made his stomach twist and his heart soar.  The pining and desperation and the moments of hopelessness and confusion and then near-certainty—but then, once again, doubt.  “I wouldn’t have—I—“
When we walk through the front door, I throw an arm out to keep the two of them behind me.  “There’s someone here.”
“You broke your promise, then?”  I say, smiling at the thought of his idiotic
I stand awkwardly against the door while John turns on the shower.  When he turns to face me, I can feel my face begin to heat, a blush no doubt creeping onto my cheeks.  He smirks, rolls his eyes, and unabashedly removes his pants. He looks lovely, as ever. He’s stayed quite fit through the years, and even entirely exposed he’s incredibly attractive.  And rather aroused.
them to know, he’d had other things on his mind—like not getting shot by the gun-wielding, brainless bastard they’d been chasing across London.
“A proper family, then,”  Sherlock breathes.  “This is what you want?”
Eating alone had been difficult.  So he’d rarely bothered.
Now John kneels, sheets tangled around his hips and two full fingers buried deep.  He hovers above the long, lean body arching beneath him, digits thrusting and twisting, tongue dancing lightly along Sherlock’s gracefully straining erection.  Sherlock gasps sharply, the unrelenting moan that escapes him doing something to John that he could not explain if he tried.  He can still hardly grasp that he’s allowed to see Sherlock like this—to be the cause of it—to watch him slowly unravel, give himself over to sensation.  He always seems to be seeking more—more of this closeness, more of John.
(See the end of the chapter for
Perhaps not.
“What’s gotten into you two?”  Lestrade mumbles, mouth full of eggs benedict.  “You haven’t stopped bloody grinning since you showed up.”  It’s true. We haven’t. But I’m not about to dignify his inane observations with a response.  When we’d told the two of them of our new relationship they’d all but laughed in our faces—Lestrade claiming that he’d thought we’d been together for years.  Molly was very happy for us, but not remotely surprised.
“I—don’t know,” The words emerge infinitely more gently than he’d intended.  Perhaps some part of him suspects that’s what they both need just now.  “But I’m quite certain that we’ll figure it out,”  He is certain.  He’s more certain of this—of them—than he’s ever been of anything in his entire bloody life.  This is it, for him.  He’s more than ready for this.

John glances over at me, expression alarmed but not entirely surprised.  “Um. Yes.”
“An antique cast iron spiral staircase isn’t exactly ideal for a small child,”  He explains with carefully contained irritation.  John grins to himself.  “I’d considered replacing it with something more standard, but I rather like it—and I knew you would as well,”  Sherlock’s right, he thinks it’s bloody brilliant.  He’d certainly never imagined that he’d live in a space with a
It’s too warm for a fire.  It’s probably too warm for tea, too, but that won’t stop John from setting the kettle to boil and leaning against the worktop, watching Sherlock as he messes about with the massive red brick fireplace on the opposite wall.  It’s practically ritual for them, at this point.  Fire in the grate and tea in hand—two small comforts that they seek each time they sit down for a proper chat.  Two small points of warmth.
John wanders out of the loo in his worn rugby t-shirt and plaid pyjama bottoms.  He crawls into bed beside me, plugging his phone in to charge on the nightstand. I’m sitting against the headboard, typing out a response to a text from Lestrade about a case we’ve been ignoring in favour of hauling boxes and painting walls.  I hit
about him.  It was when he was alive, and it is now that he’s fucking dead,”  Harry stares back at him, can hear the grief behind his words, can see it in his glassy, darkened eyes.  “Never any bloody consideration for anyone else.  He’s fucked off without me for the thousandth time, and it’s taking everything I’ve got not to follow.”
He breathes, pressing his lips to mine again briefly.  “Better check,” I reluctantly agree, rolling over to snatch my mobile off the floor as he digs his out of his jeans.  Five new messages from Mycroft.
Mycroft spends a solid hour hunched in John’s chair in the corner, looking like a proper grinch, until Harry accosts him with conspiratorial chat about the wedding.  John spends a few minutes trying to listen in, but gives up on trying to find out what siblings of the grooms have to chat about.
I nod.  An arrangement.  He doesn’t want to watch his own mind deteriorate.  I don’t want to watch it either. I don’t want any of this for him.
John.  A flare of heat sparks wildly in my gut.  I’m already hard as a bloody rod from watching him squirm and moan around my fingers.  I didn’t think he’d actually want to go through with this, but here we are. And if I’m being honest—I want this, too.  I really, really do. I lean forward and press my lips to his spine, taste the salty sweat of him. Line us up—squeezing his hips where my hands rest.  Can hardly believe this is happening. I move my pelvis forward, nudge the head of my cock against him, pausing as he inhales deeply. Then I push, gradually, into his body.
Let's check in with John, shall we?
“Yeah,”  It’s still just after midnight.  Feels like an eternity has passed in the span of a few profound moments.  His whole world has tilted into something new—something
We need to find Kenneth Jones.
“All right,”  Mycroft says, his voice not betraying any questions he may have.  “Let me know once you’ve found a suitable flat.  Best of luck with your interview,”  Greg is fairly certain he’s about to hang up and go pull whatever strings he must to ensure that John gets that job.  “Goodbye for now.”
Plus, I’ve never (willingly) abandoned a case.  Not about to start now.
He’s just spent the last three hours in meetings with old colleagues, in an attempt at staffing Baker Street now that all three flats have been gutted, scrubbed, renovated and furnished to Sherlock’s (frankly ridiculous) standards.  Each space now has its own welcoming, cosy glow, but with rather a lot less dust and clutter, and frankly
“You’ve hired Sarah,”  He says with a single nod.  John nods back, holding his breath.  “I don’t disapprove,”  Sherlock adds quickly, eyes darting over John’s face.  John knows that he approves of her—in theory.  They’ve talked about it extensively.  Decided that she was the perfect person for the job if only she could be convinced.  They’d laid out a generous salary, an equally expansive budget to work with, permission to hire her own staff as she sees fit, and a long list of reasons why she should leave her secure, reliable job at the clinic for this questionable, potentially disastrous one.  In a shocking turn of events, she was eager to accept and brimming with ideas for the place.  She’d spent her university years working in similar sober living homes, apparently loving the work she’d done there, and John is beyond relieved to put someone qualified in charge of the operation.  He and Sherlock have learned fairly quickly that they haven’t got a bloody clue what they’re doing.  Not that that’s ever stopped them before.
Greg hasn’t got a clue what he’s on about, but can chance a pretty solid guess.  All John has ever talked about is Sherlock—and vice versa, for that matter.  The two of them were so clearly in love—it was excruciating to watch them dance around each other for over a bloody year.  Never did get there, as far as he knows.  A shame, really.  A tragedy, even.  They’d’ve both been much happier if they had.  Greg gestures once more to the chairs, and this time he shuffles forward and collapses into one.

“No.”
“Oh thanks so much,” John huffs, rolling his eyes and trying to suppress a grin.  He thinks the place is lovely, actually, the bastard.
“You know what I mean,”  He snaps, glaring in a way that he hopes is threatening.  Sherlock takes one look at him and snorts.  Picks up a midnight blue jumper and tosses it into the cart.  Bastard.  John opens his mouth to argue, but is cut off immediately.
“Of course you have,”  John huffs, feeling swarmed with fondness, with gratitude for the sudden ease of this new intimacy.  He can hardly believe that this is now their reality, that they’ve made it here at last.
My favourite part.  We move together with practiced ease, our gazes locked--unrelenting.  He reads my body like a mystery novel, blue eyes piercing straight through my thundering heart.
It feels as though it exists in a world of its own.  Like it’s been misplaced in time.
“Well, now’s your chance,”  He says, glancing up at John, who’s glaring fixedly at the phone where it lies between them.  “Explain away.”
“On holiday, I suppose,”  He’s chewing. Speaking with his mouth full of something crunchy.  Typical. I glance down to see him shove another crisp into his mouth.  Roll my eyes. “Maybe we’re from the city. Came up from San Francisco for the summer,”  Sure, why not? My heart isn’t in this. Difficult to be interested in a case when you haven’t been informed of the actual crime.  Hard to focus on anything at all when you’ve developed an ever-present ache in your chest. “And we can just use our names, yeah? No one knows us in America.”
His new flat is small, modern, minimal.  Everything that 221B could never be.  White walls and large windows.  Fake fireplace to go with the faux wooden floors.  It isn’t to his taste, really—he’d loved the cozy chaos of Baker Street from the moment he’d walked through the door—but it’s what he needs, now.  Something different.  One thing he can control.
“I think that I have, too.”
“We’ve also decided to be together, in case you were wondering,”  John chimes in with a bit of a smug grin. Mycroft tries to hide his smile beneath another eyeroll, but it isn’t quite successful.  I know that he’s glad for us. He’s grown to care for John, in his own way—and he’s always wanted the best for me.
on an empty stomach, and he’d followed him without question into whatever uncharted realm he’d been trying to reach.  They’d sat there and giggled together as he deduced half the pub, and John had watched as Sherlock gradually succumbed to the effects of alcohol, swaying closer, smiling easier, and he’d felt the same effects mirrored in himself.  It had been lovely.  They’d never done that before, gotten a bit pissed together just for fun.  Ta, Anderson.  His relentless attempts to get back in their good graces since Sherlock’s return ended up resulting in a genuinely amusing night.
His lips form a smile that he knows he reserves especially for Sherlock.  There’s an entire facet of himself that he holds only for Sherlock—a part that never existed until they found each other, really.

.  I can’t, John.  I don’t want to look at him—don’t want to see the concern in his eyes.  I take his hand but stay where I am. I can distantly hear him speaking with the driver, but the words sound foggy, faded.
She doesn’t say anything more, just grips his arm for a moment and then walks away.  He watches her stride down the bar toward Greg, who greets her enthusiastically and rests a hand on her back, easily welcoming her into the conversation.
didn’t think that was the conversation he’d strode unhesitatingly into.  Bit blindsided, to be perfectly honest.
“Yes, I—I’d noticed,”  Sherlock nearly whispers.  He takes a deep breath of salty air, shivers a bit in his thin silk shirt as a chill begins to creep in with the breeze.  “You’ve seemed—”
“I know what that’s like,” John says, nodding toward me.  “Think you’ve caught about two hours of sleep in the last three days?”  My turn to roll my eyes. We were on a
“No,” John lets out a watery laugh, wiping at his eyes once more.  “No, definitely not.  Maybe I’m just getting old.”
“So this is—what?  A platonic partnership?  What could have changed between you if you’re straight?”  Ben again. Can’t seem to wrap his head around it. It really isn’t their business, but it’s my own fault for divulging the nature of our relationship last night in a moment of irritated weakness.  And as much as I despise labels in general—John should probably refer to himself as something other than
If he’s being honest, he’s been finding it increasingly difficult to keep things entirely platonic with this new tactile facet of their relationship.  He catches himself staring at Sherlock across the room, wanting desperately to run his fingers through that impossible hair, to press his lips to those pallid cheeks and try to bring a bit of colour to them.  He settles for the occasional embrace—always springing it on Sherlock once they’re back in the flat after a case has wrapped up, or just before they part to retire to their separate rooms—and then avoiding eye contact once he’s forced himself to let go.  He’s been terrified of that conversation.  Terrified of that rejection, of it being seen for what it is.

“Ah, right--besides giving details on Sherlock’s return, the main thing we’ll be covering at the press conference is the death of Mary Morstan.”  Molly looks confused--she has no reason to recognise the name--and Mrs. Hudson lets out a gasp.
He’d been there back when she’d needed him most—helped her to find freedom, given her a new start.  Sherlock sighs, exasperated.  “You’ve read the letter,”  He adds quietly, gently squeezing John’s fingers and peering back at him, willing him to understand.  John thinks back to her words, her steadfast certainty that they belonged together—
“What’s his sudden gripe with me?”  John asks, taking a sip and cringing when he burns his tongue.  “Thought we were getting along fine on Saturday,” Henry sighs, looking between us.
“Indeed.”
officially met, as I was too lost in my own panicked thoughts to introduce them on Saturday night.  He approaches, nodding at me and shaking John’s hand.
But they really would like to see him.
His lips are on mine.  A soft pressure, barely a touch.  Admittedly I’m out of my element here, but this doesn’t feel like enough.  I tilt my head a bit and lean up, palms cupping his face, increasing the pressure.  He brings his hands to my nape, holds me up. Don’t pull away, John. I want this. I part my lips, and so does he.  I don’t know where to go from here. We’ve paused, just breathing the same air. Slowly, he brings our mouths together again, sucks lightly on my lower lip.  Reverently. His touches feel careful, deliberate. He’s being gentle with me. Do I need that? Maybe I do. Maybe he needs that, too. It feels incredible, this intimacy with him.  We’ve barely touched and my heart is beating out of my chest, breaths coming fast. I run my thumbs across his cheeks. We break apart, stay close. I open my eyes and he’s already staring back at me.  We’re both panting, a bit. “Hi,” I breathe.
“Oh—um—”  He’s not at all sure why he feels so wrong-footed.  Of course Greg would find out soon enough anyway.  It occurs to him now that he
“Left ten minutes ago.  Got tired of watching you sleep.  As did Greg and Molly, although I suspect they had other plans,”  Sherlock winces, not remotely interested in what those plans may be.  “I didn’t want to wake you since you never bloody sleep, but here we are.  Let’s go home,”  (home!)  Sherlock can’t stop the stupid, giddy smile that makes its way onto his face.  John returns it, looking radiant through a lingering haze of sleep and the influence of expensive vodka and a seemingly ever-present swell of joy and relief.

“Yes,”  He presses his lips to a bony shoulder, slides his hands down to grasp his arse.  “Of course, yes,” This is new, fingers kneading affectionately into the swell of his best friend’s bum.  Their difference in height is less of a hindrance than John had imagined it may be.  Their hips line up just fine, his head at a perfect level to tuck into the crook of Sherlock’s neck—which he now does, breathing him in as Sherlock takes them both in hand once more.
“Tell me?”
“Come
“Already done.  The menu has been selected and he’s been paid in advance, despite many tedious attempts at refusing payment,”  The eyeroll can be heard in his words.  “I was sure to include the lasagne,”  Sherlock adds.  John’s favourite.  He smiles to himself.  Sherlock has taken a rather active role in the process, which isn’t altogether surprising, considering the level of dedication with which he’d planned John’s last wedding.  John has been spending rather more time than he’d like lately dwelling on those days—he can’t help but picture Sherlock prancing around 221B, bending over backwards to accept John’s terrible decisions and to make the most of them for his sake.  The cold, sharp regret will always be there, he knows, but it’s begun to soften and evolve into something more like gratitude.  It has twisted and churned like a bloody great lava lamp in his gut, merging with the overwhelming joy that now resides there and forming something new.
“No.  I couldn’t have either.”  Couldn’t have imagined you’d want to know this side of me, John.  No one had ever tried, before you.
“Hello,”  John whispers.  Sherlock watches him in silence for what feels like a very long time.  He watches back.  Waits.
“Define proper,”  John smiles, voice hushed, heart hopeful.  Sherlock rolls his eyes, then touches his lips softly to John’s cheekbone.
“We need you,”  He chokes out.  “We can figure something out, you don’t have to—to leave,”  Tears are streaming down his cheeks now.  Can’t be helped.  He angrily swipes at his face, watching as Sherlock’s eyes grow wide in the same way they do when he’s found the clue that cracks the case.  His mouth slowly opens in a silent
Obviously.  She’s always chosen to live her life this way, clutching on to the secrets of those who wish to do her harm.
Not the case, as it turns out.  He’s right here—lying nose to nose beside him, hand roaming John's body without a trace of doubt.
Sherlock fights the stubborn prickle at the corner of his eyes, inhales deeply and tugs at John’s waist until he’s in his lap, straddling Sherlock's thighs, hovering slightly above him.  John leans back for a moment, looking down at him, eyes blazing and chest heaving.  He traces a finger down Sherlock’s jaw, runs the pad of his thumb over his bottom lip.  He stares.
“It was time,”  Sherlock says.
“All right,”  Another sigh.  “He’s asleep.  I’ll leave the door open—I’m off to bed.”
“You wouldn’t,”  The look of scorn on his face at the mention of a plastic tree dissolves the annoyance of a moment ago.  John smiles.  Just a small one.  Sherlock has been behaving like an overgrown child since the second they stepped out of the Land Rover and wandered into this lot of chopped down, tied up fir trees.  His enthusiasm is contagious and John finds it absurdly charming—mostly.  It’s a bit bloody much, but he loves him for it.  Loves him for the rather overwhelming excitement he’s shown in the last few days about the fast-approaching holidays.
“Sherlock,”  A whisper.  I sigh, turning my head to the sound of John’s voice.  I’ve slipped out of him and slid off of him, making a mess of the bed in the process.  No matter. Now I lie at his side, trailing my fingers over his hip—more content than I’d thought myself capable of.  Our mouths connect, a lazy kiss. “Do you think we’d feel it?  If one of us—if we—do you think we’d know?” He’s thinking of Irene again.  Of what she's lost and how hollow it's left her. It’s a romantic notion, to believe that you can feel someone’s absence—that it’s possible to share a bond so strong that the moment the other leaves this life, you simply
at me.”  Did I? I did.  I did all of those things.  Sounds a bit not good when he rattles them off like that.  God, I’ve behaved unforgivably, haven’t I? Put a wedge between us.  Splintered our tender connection, perhaps irreparably--
John had been sure he couldn’t possibly feel any more for this man, his heart already bursting at the proverbial seams.  He’d been wrong.
He believes that John has figured out, at this point, where his limits lie.  He believes that John is aware of what Sherlock wants from him and aware of what he will never be interested in with anyone—even John, who he loves with an intensity that punches the breath from his lungs if he lets himself fully feel it.  He wants to believe that he could have it, that it could work between them, but he simply does not know what John is thinking.  He never has.
the question that’s been flashing in his head since the moment they got swept up into this whirlwind.  “So—will you, then?  Marry me?”
The restaurant we end up at is casual and authentic.  The food is lovely, and comes out fast--much to John’s relief.  “Oh my God, this is perfect,” He mumbles around a mouthful of curry.  Our table is loaded with plates of spring rolls, papaya salad, fried rice, pad thai--a veritable feast for three.
“Obviously not.  I spent three days here last month while I got everything in order.  There were certain things I’d wanted to accomplish before I brought you here,”  John stares at him, feeling ridiculously relieved that
I nearly drop the mobile in my haste to respond.  We’ve met there before, many times. Back when we were still capable of conjuring words and speaking them aloud to one another, I would meet him for lunch a few times a week.  But that hasn’t happened in months. Now all we have is useless small talk, awkward silence—and a stubborn determination to avoid what really needs to be said.
He’d forgotten about that.  Molly hadn’t wanted to tell him, so he’d let it go.
“No—”
He raises an eyebrow at my confusion.  “We’re going to be spending a day by the sea, you idiot.”
“Yes well,” I clear my throat, tearing my eyes away from him reluctantly.  Best not get distracted. “We still don’t know who. Or
“Must we?”  I ask for the eleventh time, slamming my car door shut with a dramatic flourish.  John only rolls his eyes and strides down the pavement toward the Rainbow.
“Yes,” I say, turning my face into his shoulder—hiding, perhaps.  Delaying the conversation that we must soon have. He huffs, quietly.  Amused by my gracelessness. Rolls forward and takes me in his arms, enveloping my body once more.  Immediately I feel the tension begin to fade. I allow myself to relax against him, to slide an arm around his back and clutch him to me—squeeze him, really—to fully return the embrace.  He sighs, face tucked into the crook of my neck, and I shiver at the thrill of his breath against my skin. He seems to need this as much as I do—this physical reassurance. I wonder how much time has passed since he’s been close to someone like this.  A long time, if I’m not mistaken. Quite a few years.
“Bloody Mycroft,”  He grumbles.  “Showed up—four in the bloody morning at my sister’s flat—tells me that he didn’t
“Yes.  Update?”
Before I can say anything of substance, he’s sliding toward me, hands shaking.  Reaching out, he touches my face. Thumbs brushing over my cheekbones. Trembling fingers are at my temples, then slide back, behind my ears, down my neck, and stay there.  I'm frozen in place again, watching as his eyes grow wet, tears spilling over, still staring into mine. Blue. His palms are cupping my neck as the pads of his fingers trace over my nape.  Up into the short curls there, and back down again. Then on to my shoulders, my arms. He pauses, then pulls me in. Closer than we've ever been. He's breathing hard, sobbing now. Hands clutching my back, holding me tight.  I feel the long gashes burn under the pressure of his hands over my coat. I don't mind. He doesn't know they're there; knows nothing of the whips and chains and rage and fear. I didn't expect this warmth. I thought there would be punches thrown, angry words, loud voices.  I was prepared for that. Not for this. Not at all. After a long moment, my arms come up from where they've been lying helplessly at my sides. I hold on to him and try not to lose myself completely. My eyes begin to prickle and I let the tears fall. Relief. An overwhelming sense of it.  We hold on for a long time. Melt slowly into each other, breaths slowing. His face pressed into my neck, fists in my coat. I've buried my face in his hair, eyes closed, breathing him in. Hands gliding up and down his back.
“I’ll be home tomorrow.”
Whatever this place may be, the fact that it even exists is hugely significant for the three of them.  This is the grandest of gestures.  A promise, a pledge.  And the thought of that makes John feel as though his skin is too tight, as though he’s full-to-bursting with emotion that he cannot express—because he isn’t allowed to grab Sherlock and kiss him until his knees give out.  He cannot pour all of this excess affection into the man it belongs to, the one who’s put it there in the first place—
“What’s up?”  He asks, feigning ignorance as they reach the creek.  She turns to face him, eyebrows raised.
The melody is low, slow, haunting.  Eerie.
“Does it have to be right
Is he allowed to touch him whenever he feels like reaching out?  What about in front of others?  Can he kiss him any time?  Take his hand whenever he craves that connection?  Is Sherlock okay with their friends and families knowing that they’re together in this way?  And even now, when it’s just the two of them—he’s unsure what’s allowed.  He’s followed Sherlock’s lead so far, letting things unfold naturally between them.  And it’s been brilliant—better than he could have possibly hoped for.  But now that they’ve managed to open the floodgates, how do they navigate the flood?
“Sherlock—let’s do this, come on,”  John nods toward their chairs, picking up his tea and heading that way, sure that he’ll follow.  He does.  They sit, eyes locked, silent for a few moments—John knowing innately that he’ll have to be the one to begin this dialogue.  He inhales deeply, more than ready to say what needs to be said.  “Things have been a bit different these past few days,”  Vague, but true.  Sherlock says nothing.  “You’ve done this incredible thing—you’ve set up a future for us—found us a home that is so bloody far beyond what I could have imagined, I can hardly believe it’s real,”  John sighs, leaning forward, resting his forearms on his thighs.  “Sherlock, it’s quite a statement—at least to me—I—I need to know if you meant it to be.  A statement,”  God, he sounds like an idiot.
He stares up at me, all traces of indignation wiped from his face.  “You’re right. It doesn’t bloody matter anyway. I set out to take her down and I have,” Shakes his head once, as if trying to physically clear his mind.  “Were you able to crack both USB drives then?”
The case is seemingly a simple one.  There is an Englishman—Holling Collins—residing in Northern California.  He is apparently up to no good, although details have not been supplied. The client is a secretive bastard.  I’m to insert myself into Mr. Collin’s life somehow—to get close enough to catch a glimpse of whatever crime he’s supposedly guilty of—and report back to my nameless client.
And now they’ve gone and had a drunken shag.  A completely illuminating and unquestionably earth-shattering shag, yes—but a drunken one.  Not ideal.
“Money,”  He says simply, after a moment’s hesitation.  “I couldn’t work only part time at the clinic and still afford all of Rosie’s classes—and the flat—and everything else that goes along with living in London and raising a child.  That’s all it was,” He lifts his head slowly, watching me through tinted lenses.
“This is humiliating,”  Harry sits on her bed, glaring petulantly as John folds a pair of jeans and sets them neatly in her duffel.  He rolls his eyes.
His thoughts are clearly attempting to run rampant now, trying to avoid the situation at hand.  He takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly.  One of the calming techniques Ella had burned into his brain all those years ago—possibly the only thing he took away from those sessions.
And before he even knows what he's doing, he’s got his mobile pressed to his ear and it’s ringing, ringing.  Three times, four—
after everything John had said last night.
John—acting on sentiment,”  He nearly spits this out, voice gradually rising as he continues to find the words.  “I don’t know what to
We trudge through the door, and he lets out a long sigh of relief.  We’ve been stuck at the Yard for hours, wrapping things up, and after everything this week has thrown our way, it’s good to be home.  There hasn’t been much time at all to spare for each other, so once we’ve shrugged off our jackets, I take his hand and lead him to the bedroom.
A quiet knock.  Timid. Reluctant, almost.  I leap off the couch, stride across the flat and fling open the door.  My gaze locks onto familiar blue eyes and a long, charged moment passes in silence between us.  And then:
“I’ve got movers on retainer,”  Sherlock blurts out from where he stands leaning against the worktop, sipping the cup of tea John has placed in his hands.  The morning had been a whirlwind of omelets and arguing with a three year old over the chocolate-stained dress she was insistent on wearing.  In the end, she had won out of sheer bullheadedness, but John had packed a small bag with a few options in case she changed her mind.  Molly stopped by Baker Street to scoop her up on the way to the zoo, wanting to get there before the crowds became too overwhelming.  She’d thankfully refrained from bombarding them with questions, but they did tell her a bit about the cottage, promising she could see it soon.
“I don’t think that’s it, though.  Do you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
This chapter is fairly bleak.  Some notes about Mycroft at the end!
going to get hurt?
He doesn’t wait.  Deftly unfastening John’s jeans, he slides his hand down over the cotton of his pants.  John makes a pained sound, a choked whimper, as Sherlock palms him firmly, tracing the thick length of him, memorizing every tiny twitch, every eager reaction—every last touch that makes John fall to pieces beneath his hands.
John thinks.  This is what he’d felt when they were finally reunited.  This is how he’d felt and John had snuffed it all out with his resentment and rage.
“I believe you’ve missed something,”  John looks up calmly at the sound of Sherlock’s voice, unsurprised at his timely arrival—he always could read John’s bloody mind.  He stands in the doorway, a sleepy Rosie in his arms.  She’s clearly succumbed to drowsiness amidst the encroaching darkness and the excitement of the day.
“This is all very illuminating, but can we get some face time with our suspect before my brother sends him off into the ether?”
“I am appallingly, obscenely in love with you,”  John blurts out, giggling and thinking only of making up for lost time.  “Have been for ages.  All right?”  Sherlock stops, turning to meet John’s eyes—throat bobbing, fingers tightening in a death grip where their hands are intertwined.
the sort that one of them believes to be eternal—will do them good.
He stands a bit straighter, no longer relying on the solid expanse of their front door to keep him upright, takes a step forward and beams, bewildered.
“Fuck are you doing here?”  He mutters, uninterested, immediately returning his gaze to the bartop.
But she had seen how deeply somber he’d become—she had seen that his entire world had narrowed down to John.
It’s nearly an hour before they find themselves sitting side by side in their rented Jeep, facing the cliffside cottage.  It’s been silent, utterly silent, since Sherlock had bared his heart and trusted John with three words that had cost him everything.
John looks up quickly to find Sherlock watching him from his perch in the corner where he’d been dragged begrudgingly into chatting with Donovan and a few other officers about some case or other.  John had slipped away to the bar.  He’d only meant to take a few moments to mentally shake himself into remembering not to stare quite so longingly at the most observant man in London, but then Molly had appeared.  He feels a bit wrong-footed now, watching Sherlock right back, mind frantically trying to catch up with this sudden onslaught of information—this sudden feeling of possibility.  Hope.  His mobile buzzes in his hand and he hesitantly tears his eyes from Sherlock’s to glance down at it.
We’ve yet to get a word in ten minutes later, half-listening as Hal goes on about how he practically owns the Rainbow, for all of the money he throws their way.  He clearly doesn’t suspect that Henry failed to drug us, so I allow my mind to wander. I’m deeply distracted by John—his unending warmth against my chest—the pads of his fingers now drifting across my skin where his hands remain resting against my forearms.  I want to get out of here. Want to crawl into bed with him and curl up under the duvet in one another’s arms. If this is all he can ever give me, it’s more than enough. I’m pulled back to the present by John’s voice—the first time he’s attempted to speak since Hal sat down.
“I never remember them,” John has crawled back into bed.  Pulls me over to nestle against his side, hand going straight up to card through my curls.  Comforting.
Sherlock is awake, lying on his side, already watching him approach with a sharpness that had been absent last night.  John exhales slowly, tamping down a bout of nausea that tries to fight its way to the surface.
“It’ll be fine,”  He steps forward, wraps an arm around her waist, presses his lips to her hairline.  She exhales shakily, breath warm against his neck.  “John will be fine.  He may have forgotten how to bloody socialize, but he seems a hell of a lot better than the last time I saw him.”
I arise disoriented, with puffy eyes.  I’m lying on my stomach and there’s a weight across my back.
“An arteriovenous malformation.  Inoperable.” An AVM. Inoperable, so likely in his brain.  Gradual loss of neurological function. Memory loss. Seizures.  Headaches. Persistent nausea. My mind rattles off the symptoms directly from the medical texts of my mind palace.  Loss of vision. Hallucinations. Weakness. And that’s only if it doesn’t rupture and kill him first. Stroke. Brain damage.  Death.
On page sixteen, I’ve seen enough.  Our next move is clear.
“You’re grieving,”  Sherlock rumbles, taking a deep breath and finally letting his own head tip to the side, cheek resting carefully against John’s soft silver crown.  He can feel John’s smile against his shoulder.  He picks idly at a fingernail, still nervous and quite unsure what to do with his hands.
“Ah, no,”  John says, meeting Greg’s eyes as a small smile tugs at his lips.  “I think my sister is more her type.  Certain of it, actually,”  Ah.  Well.  “We just go back, is all.  She’s known me for a long while.  Since before—this,”  He flicks his hand upward—indicating, Greg assumes, the sorry turn that his life has taken.  “Before this, even,”  He gestures toward his shoulder, which Greg now knows was the only reason John had returned to London at all.  “Anyway,”  John sighs.  “I wanted to—apologize—for Christmas.”
--I’ll suck the breath right out of him.  He’s frantically grasping at my curls, gasping as his hips thrust up into my mouth.  I encourage this by grabbing at his lush cheeks and
One shower, two simultaneous and quite satisfying handjobs, and three mugs of coffee later, we’re packed and ready to go.
“Mycroft loved his brother,”  Greg begins, knowing that he’s walking into a minefield, but pushing on anyway.  “And Sherlock loved you, John,”  He visibly flinches, quickly looking away.  Greg continues before he can flee.  “I have no problem believing that he’d choose your life over his own.  He never put much value on his own wellbeing—you know that full well.  The mad bastard never slept or ate a decent meal unless you forced him to.  I don’t know about Mrs. Hudson or myself, but if someone was threatening you, he’d have done whatever it took.”  John swallows, remains silent for a small eternity.
“All right, then,”  John would really rather explore the rest of the house before venturing back outdoors, but he knows better than to argue with his offspring when there are flowers to smell.  “Lead the way,”  She leaps down from the sofa and marches back toward the kitchen, where there’s a set of French doors leading out back.
“John,”  She tries gently, watching as he visibly deflates, eyes darting back to meet hers before skittering across the room once more.  “Were the two of you—were you—”
“Heard from her lately?” He’s still grinning.  Does he know she still texts me? Not sure how he could.  Long since destroyed that bloody ringtone. Several phones ago.
My legs propel me forward and I find myself sliding onto the bench, to his right.  I leave a few feet between us, glance sideways, and wait. His eyes reluctantly leave the water as he looks over, annoyed that someone dare invade his space.  I watch as the annoyance flickers, replaced swiftly by utter shock. His eyes widen, slowly, growing impossibly large on his ever-expressive face. His body turns toward me as if of its own accord, his mouth parting, his hands shooting up to hover over it as he gapes.  We stare at each other. I watch as his mind frantically tries to accept what's in front of him. My heart has regrown and is threatening to beat a hole through my chest. My stomach has come back, only to drop away again, leaving me to feel like I'm falling. Falling fast.  Panic creeping in. We stare and stare. He says nothing.
I hear him mutter to himself.  I now sit perched on a little bench on the front porch while John walks circles around the car that’s been left for us.  It’s quite—small—now that I’ve seen it up close. Old, but restored. A nice shade of burgundy. And convertible—the top currently down.  “Can you believe this?” He stops his circling and walks over to join me on the bench. I shrug.
John groans, sitting up on the ridiculously stiff sofa and stretching his arms upward until his spine cracks, muscles shifting pleasantly beneath skin.  He glances at the time.  3:42.
open about my feelings tonight—not holding back at all about what his presence in my life has meant to me—and likely already making him a bit uncomfortable.  And now this? And to have invited this near-stranger into our space? What have I done now?
Dinner is served.  We have pushed two tables together, all cramming around them in mismatched chairs.  Molly and Tom brought homemade Christmas crackers with them, so we pop them open before we eat.  The table erupts with laughter over and over again as paper crowns, ridiculous toys and completely nonsensical jokes are revealed.  Mrs. Hudson places a purple crown on Mycroft’s reluctant head and then bursts into a fit of giggles. Harry asks me what you get when you cross a snowman with a vampire.  I roll my eyes, then raise an eyebrow when Lestrade, a too-small yellow crown perched on his grey mop of hair, shouts, “Frostbite!” across the table, sloshing his wine in his haste to answer.  Molly laughs and blows a pink plastic whistle at him.
“You—what?”
“I don’t understand why you still give that bastard the time of day,”  No, she wouldn’t understand.  She never could.  “He was a pompous prick even before he killed himself in front of you and left you to rot,”  She’d met him only once.  On John’s birthday that first year at Baker Street.  It was immediate, mutual disdain.  “And now you’ve ditched your bloody
Last night was everything I could have ever wanted it to be.  The panic-fueled pressure I had built up around the act had vanished, swiftly replaced by absolute trust and profound desire.  It was perfect. It always is. “I love you,” I breathe.
Hal introduces Henry to me as his boyfriend, and then proceeds to blather on for half an hour about where they met (here), how long they’ve been together (eleven months), etcetera, etcetera.  John is well practiced at feigning interest in other peoples’ stories—he is a doctor after all—so I’m barely required to contribute. Just another thing to love about him, really. He’s always been willing to interact with society on my behalf when I need him to.  Henry says nothing. He seems to be a bit checked out, occasionally casting irritated glances at Hal.
She should have seen, should have noticed
“I shouldn’t have given it to him,”  She whispers.  Her expression is earnest, concerned.  “I think I’ve made a mistake.”
A twenty-seven minute ride later (So far away from the beating heart of London--you must have been miserable, John.) we arrive at Mary’s flat.  Lestrade and his team have come and gone, and the flat has been empty for days. John pulls a jangling keychain from his pocket and lets us in the front door.
that I didn’t mean it.  And Mycroft is generally a good gauge for what sort of situation we’re walking into,”  He isn’t wrong. My brother and his position of power continue to be extremely valuable in what we do.  “He’s been quite worried, but I guess he’d assumed you knew something he didn’t. I haven’t told him we’re a bit lost,”  I sigh, stretching out on the couch and tugging John down beside me. We lie face to face, and I let my hand drift down his arm, then around his waist.
woman he’s fallen hopelessly in love with over the last year.  She looks up at him a bit guiltily, then slumps against the wall.
“It’s government funded, see?  Or maybe Mycroft is funding it.  He wouldn’t tell me if he were.  Not sure if there’s really a—a difference.  Sherlock?
It’s still early, but they’ve had a long trip and John’s stomach does tend to rule his pedestrian brain.  Sherlock can feel his eyes on him.  He has always been able to feel the weight of John’s mighty blue gaze.  After a moment, he turns to meet it head on.

New chapter, dudes.  They actually leave the flat for more than five minutes in this one.
Wide eyes and a stunned silence follow my brief explanation of my parents’ gift to us.  I drop down next to him, and he immediately rolls over to face me. “Your childhood home?”  He whispers, eventually. I nod, snake an arm around his waist. “I can’t wait to see where you grew up,”  Is all he has to say on the matter. We plan to go tomorrow afternoon and stay for two nights. I’m a bit nervous to show him—the place doesn’t hold many happy memories for me.  It represents years of loneliness and isolation. Still, it’s a lovely, and rather grand, cottage—and we can make it our own. Somewhere we can find some quiet once our life in London becomes chaos once more.
“That was bloody awkward,” John laughs nervously as we stride out the front doors.  “Sorry to put you through that.”
That is, when he hasn’t vanished for three days without warning like he’d done last month.  But John had chosen to let that go, so—
“When you—touch me.  When you look at me, John, I—don’t have to question it,”  He slides his hand up to rest over the thud of John’s heart.  “You never hesitate to give me every part of you.  It’s—“ He swallows, looking overwhelmed.  John reaches up instinctively to place a palm against his cheek, fingers brushing along his temple.  Sherlock turns, slightly, leaning into his heat.  “It’s something I couldn’t have guessed was possible.  As I’ve told you before, you gave me something to live for the moment we met.  And now—I feel it.  I can always feel it,”  John nods, slides closer and wraps himself around Sherlock’s chest.  He tucks his head beneath his chin, presses his lips to the skin of a sweat-slick throat.
They sit close, knees brushing easily, at their usual table by the window (John had called ahead for it—he always does, these days) Sherlock lets out a contented sigh, long fingers fiddling idly with the small candle that sits between them.  They’ve completed the requisite pleasantries with Angelo—basked in his candid enthusiasm over their coming nuptials, and confirmed the plans for a menu of classic lasagne, gnocchi and chicken saltimbocca.  He promises to deliver one of each for them to try tonight—as if they haven’t been eating his cuisine several times a month since the day they’d met.  Now he’s taken his leave and left them with a bottle of far too expensive wine.
He situates himself on a stool beside Greg, shuffling around a bit and removing his familiar black jacket, tossing it over the stool on his left.  “Anyway,”  He continues, shooting Greg an apologetic smile.  “Hello.”
The problem with my brother and I is that we don’t know what to say to one another.  Our shared interests begin and end with snarky banter and a propensity for deduction.  Outside of that, we only ever seem to find hostility and decades of pain. But we could try.
“Goodnight,” I say, reluctantly dropping my arms from John’s shoulders and taking his hand instead.  We say goodbye to Adam, promising to be in touch about Thursday—then leave before Hal decides he has more to say.
He quickly shuffles closer, eliminating the space between us, and his tongue breaches my lips--hungrily.  One hand leaves my face to grab roughly at my arse, quickly elevating the electricity that had been faintly fizzling through us.  Bodies now charged, we carry on like this--movements growing frantic, mouths wide and wild. John breaks away, panting heavily. He looks at me for a long, blazing moment, before reaching behind him for the nightstand and rummaging through the drawer.  His fingers now clutch a small bottle of lube--a remnant of a past life. Abandoned, left behind.
“Sleep all right, you two?”  I ignore the question and slide into a seat across from my father.
“You really mean that,”  Harry says, almost gently.  Odd.  John stops typing, glances up to meet her inquiring eye.
I am no sort of medical expert.  I knew someone who went through the horrors of a brain AVM, but that doesn't mean I know what I'm talking about.  If I offend anyone, I'm very sorry.  I'm open to any corrections.
John rolls his head to the side, eyebrows raised in an invitation to continue.  “Only since Mrs. Hudson died, really.  He began stopping by the morgue a bit more often, while you were out doing the shopping or whatever it is you get up to,”  She grins at him, knowing full well that he doesn’t get up to anything at all—he’s about as interesting as a stale crisp, these days.  “The first time he brought it up, he asked me how I found the courage to talk to Greg.
“I was invited, of course.”
“Let’s not,” Sherlock interrupts, lifting shaking hands to either side of John’s jaw.  “Soon we’ll—but can we just—”  He dips his head, tentatively meeting John’s lips, clearly unsure of his welcome.  John inhales sharply, momentarily stunned, then quickly pushes his fingers up into dark curls, urging him closer, pouring every drop of warmth bursting from his body into this unexpected and long-overdue connection.
After a long, contemplative pause, he jerks his head back toward the building.  “Lives upstairs. Not in at the moment. Come back later.”
The walls are a very light pink, with large-scale foliage painted in sweeping strokes across them in various shades of green.  There are birds scattered throughout, bringing little pops of colour to the impressive panorama.  Everything is outlined with thin black brushstrokes, making it appear timeless—a permanent fixture.  Rosie has wasted no time exploring the sprawling scene, her stubby fingers tracing over the wing of a crane and trailing up over a grandiose fern.  When she turns back to the two of them, still hovering in the doorway, her tiny features are illuminated with eager elation.
Just inside the door is Molly, chatting cheerfully with Lestrade as she shrugs off her coat.  And beside her, a man of precisely my height, wearing precisely my coat, and sporting a scarf that I wouldn’t wear in a thousand years.  John has sidled over to my side, grinning up at me. I see, John. Very clever. I roll my eyes and opt to say nothing at all. He laughs maniacally, clearly overcome with glee.  Idiot.
“John—” I begin, intending to confront this immediately and suggest that we find something else.
Sherlock kisses him.  He doesn’t realize he’d decided to do so until he’s already inexpertly pressing his mouth to John’s, hands framing his face, head at an awkward angle—trying to get closer, trying to explain something wordlessly that even he doesn’t quite understand.  John gasps, places both hands on Sherlock’s biceps and gently pushes him back.  He stares.  Sherlock stares back, tries to control his breathing.
I glance at his laptop, study the open email containing neatly labeled diagrams of complex chemical formulas that mean nothing to me.
We stay for a cup of tea, invite her to dinner, (
I look up to see John standing next to me, waiting patiently for me to rise out of my spinning thoughts and exit the car.  He opens the door, and I stand.
“Shut it.”
John had set the process in motion before everything between them had begun—before the move, before they’d become
“No gifts,”  John says, leaning heavily on their overflowing shopping trolley as he watches Sherlock pause in front of a display of cashmere jumpers.  Sherlock glances back at him, a confused scowl between his storm-grey eyes.  “No gifts for me, I mean,”  John is counting on this Christmas for the opportunity to show Sherlock how highly he thinks of him in an actual, tangible way.  It’s his turn to do the bloody giving.  And for once, he has a plan in place—something Sherlock would never think to get for himself.  Two somethings, in fact.  “And I do mean it, Sherlock, you’ve already bought me a bloody house and a bloody car and a bloody honeymoon—”
“Keep doing that,”  He demands, happy to hear that his voice is cooperating, for the most part.
“Useful,” He shrugs and nods to his freshly opened bottle, feeling incandescently buoyant with possibility as he takes a cold, bubbly swig.
We’re in motion again, ducking behind the husks of old cars, edging ever closer, prepared to intervene if it comes to that.  But something feels--off. Jones isn’t moving.
Again, John sighs.  Then yawns, large and loud.  He hears Sherlock register this and let out a low chuckle.  He should really sleep.  Reality is beginning to seep in, gradually evaporating the fleeting fog of joyous madness and making his eyelids feel heavy instead.  Today will be spent getting Harry’s life in order so she can step away from it for two full months without it utterly crumbling.  He wants to be sure she has something to return to—some semblance of stability.  Tomorrow afternoon he’ll bring her to the clinic in Leeds—and then at last he’ll get on a train back home.  “But I’ll see you very soon, Sherlock,”  And what then?  God, he can hardly fucking wait to find out.  “You should try to sleep.”
He takes a moment to stare at the two-headed goat that juts out of the far wall, lets his eyes roam over the odd mish-mash of furniture that sits in clusters around a small fireplace, lingering for a moment on the group of twenty-somethings sitting huddled on floral print armchairs, chatting animatedly and sipping their lagers.  He’s always thought this place was quite strange—someone’s bizarre collection of objects put on display with a bar shoved in the corner just to give it all some sort of purpose.
An unassuming seat by the water—a setting for two profound moments in his life.  He seems rooted in place—much like I was, all those days ago—so I take the first step for him.  We slide, side by side, onto the bench and look out at the cold, empty lake. Lost in our own thoughts, we grip each other’s hands tightly and say nothing.  Still and silent. This time, when I turn to look at John, his eyes are on me.
It’s unlike anything I’ve seen before.  And the
“I’m still going.  Tuesdays at ten.”

me?  Elaborate.  And tell us why you’re here, while you’re at it,” Henry looks up at me, slightly alarmed, tapping away on his mobile once more.  “I’ll have the phone,” I say, holding out my hand. He hesitates, then quickly locks it and hands it over. What’s he hiding, then?
“I—well,” He takes a deep breath.  “I suppose the first thing we should consider is whether we’ll share a space—a—bed,” God, why is this so difficult?
On our way out the door, she grabs us each by the hand and beams at us.  “So happy to have you boys back. It just wasn’t the same here without you.”
“I want that too,” Sherlock says, eventually, his tone a bit fierce.  It cuts through the quiet and allows John to exhale at last.
“You’ve composed a blog post about our relationship status, but have made no move to finalize it,”  He says matter-of-factly.  John stares up at him, surprised by this blunt statement.  It’s true that he’s been up in his study picking away at that post for the better part of a week, trying to find the right words to express everything that they are and what it means to him.  He wrote it mostly for himself—just to get it all out—unsure if Sherlock would even appreciate such sentiment being dropped out into the world.  He’s mentioned that he’s fine with an announcement of sorts, but also made it clear that he doubted it was even necessary—so John hasn’t made any real effort to actually post it.
“Ta, but no,”  John says amiably, gracing her with a small, genuine smile.  “But could we get a sixer of the stout to go?”

He kisses me—deeply, fiercely—then abruptly flings the duvet off of our bodies and drags me out of bed.
bright.  Large windows line every wall—and visible on the back porch, eyes to the sea, are two men—each of them dark in both hair and complexion.  They appear to be sunbathing. Adam strides out of the kitchen, handing John and I each a cocktail, and we follow him out to the porch.
“I know, yeah,”  She’s really grinning now.  John rolls his eyes.
“What’s this then?” My mother has stopped her fluttering long enough to eavesdrop.
John leans forward in the armchair he’s been perched in, elbows against his thighs.
She pauses, studies me.  “Who are you? Police?”
“And?”  Surely I won’t be expected to
John doesn’t hesitate outside the door, just twists his key and flings it open, flings himself through, flings himself up seventeen steps and only pauses once he’s flung open the door to their sitting room.

“This is a conversation, I hope.  Nothing more,”  The doctor’s expression is entirely distrusting, his eyes searching for an ulterior motive, but apparently finding none.  He shrugs, slowly releasing the breath in his lungs.  “You’ve missed your last two shifts at the clinic,”  Mycroft had been notified yesterday that John had missed a second shift—slightly worrisome, but he’s loathed working there for ages—since
