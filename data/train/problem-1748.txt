“Talking is good, but it’s not
Obviously, the
It wasn’t until Wednesday afternoon that Sherlock got an update on the case. He had spent the last 24 hours rewinding the details over and over in his mind, but something about the murder just wouldn’t fall into place. He felt like one of the key elements remained hidden in the dark, but by 4:30 p.m. illumination came in form of a phone call. An upset sounding Lestrade explained to him that not one but both suspects were guilty. Unfortunately, only one of them was still in custody. The other one…
, sir,” he begged desperately.
Sherlock eventually turned around and looked straight at John. He cursed silently when the tears spilled over and his eyes provided a blurry image of John opening his mouth, but before he could say anything, Sherlock leant forward and pressed his lips against John’s in a desperate, messy kiss. John tasted like toothpaste and the lingering tang of lager, but Sherlock didn’t mind. “Don’t ever leave like that again,” he gasped between kisses and pressed himself tighter against John. “Or at least let me know that you’re alright.”
of the riding crop hitting Sherlock’s skin and eliciting a moan from the detective, followed by Sherlock thanking his Dom. When Sherlock thanked him for the ninth, he noticed tears welling up in his eyes and by the time they reached fourteen, he was sobbing uncontrollably. What faintly sounded like “Twenty, thankyou, Jawn,” was barely recognisable between the ragged gasps and sobs.
“Oh God, yes!” John groaned and lifted his hips up to help Sherlock undress him completely. It took five seconds for Sherlock to get rid of John’s pants and toss them on the floor and another ten seconds to look at John’s body splayed out before him. Even looking at his naked, hard boyfriend was enough to make his own cock leak a bit of precome.
“You know why. We talked about this, remember, Sherlock?”
Sherlock gave a derisive snort. “If you can’t keep them in custody at the same time, track every movement of the one who leaves first to–”
“Sherlock,” John offered helpfully and the landlady smiled.
, at all. That you’d ditch me over some stupid cigarettes–”
“Yes, obviously. Gavin would rather send them straight to Pentonville than back into NSY custody and he needs my help to convict the second criminal.”
“He’s probably right.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock demanded impatiently.
. Now he would simply have to make John aware that his altered behaviour was linked to the invitation (or everything else concerning John and his military past for that matter) and he would most likely get what his 'transport' longed for.
“And you also read through my emails, right?” John sounded decidedly calm now, but Sherlock knew that it was literally the calm before the storm.
“There’s something I still don’t get.”
“You’re so good at this,” John breathed when he registered the two different kinds of stimulation. “So fucking good, sweetheart.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, we’re going to the airport to pick a suspect up?” John sounded confused. Usually, they only went to the Yard for interrogations.
“Too bad. But don’t worry, love. It’s one of the things I don’t want to ruin about you.”
“I’m close, sir! Oh, God, I’m close…” he moaned breathlessly and John turned the vibrations off. Sherlock whimpered and struggled to cope with the denied release. Being forced to let go of his orgasm for the first time wasn’t painful yet, but it wasn’t comfortable either. His body trembled slightly with the desperate need for release and he panted hard while fighting the urge to shift a bit and rub his throbbing cock against the pillow. It would be so easy, a barely noticeable change of posture… but his need to please John was much stronger than his need to come.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please, John. Please take care of me.” God, why was he already begging? He really needed John to shut down his mind then.
He wasn’t really surprised that John entered the bathroom first. Even three pints (judging by his reaction time and the way he moved) couldn’t keep him from brushing his teeth. Sherlock would have smiled if he wasn’t feeling… well, whatever it was he was feeling.
“I need a case!” Sherlock shouted and paced up and down the sitting room agitatedly.
“It’s alright, calm down, sweetheart. The scene is over now,” he heard John’s voice clearly, but the usual evening sounds of the city as well as everything else sounded as if underwater or really far away. It simply aligned with Sherlock’s state of mind: floating, disconnected from his body, not able to focus on anything but John. Sherlock wasn’t sure whether three minutes or three hours passed till he realised that the insistent throbbing in his cock and balls subsided.
. Sherlock slumped back onto the sofa in a breathless, boneless puddle of misery. Tears were streaming down the sides of his face but he barely even noticed them.
“It’s not okay,” John sobbed, his voice muffled by the soft fabric of Sherlock’s T-shirt. Sherlock had known for years now that it would come to this eventually. John had known it too since the moment they had shared that look during John’s wedding; Sherlock had clearly seen it in his eyes that day.
John took a moment to collect his thoughts. “It’s not your fault if you don’t know how to communicate something. I roughly know what you like and don’t like, but I won’t do
it then.
John didn’t have to think twice. “There aren’t many I’ve encountered as a dominant play partner… I don’t like inflicting pain if it goes beyond 'mild'. I’m fine with bringing my military persona into that, but I won’t engage in anything medical."
“Oh, John, as always you see, but you don’t observe. My mind is rotting away! I can feel it falling to pieces, but of course someone like you wouldn’t understand this.”
? Sherlock, do you have any idea – any idea at all – how dangerous and stupid that was?! He almost shot you; you almost got yourself killed today!” John took a couple of deep breaths to calm himself down. “You clearly lack discipline and your behaviour today was unacceptable, which means that punishment is in order. Do you understand that?”
Sherlock sighed. “Your fears are irrational, John. I’m not alone, there are two armed police officers present during the entire interrogation and there is nothing you can do to help. We don’t have to talk about yesterday’s incident ever again if you preferred not to and I think you could really need a little break from the case.”
John slid almost all the way out of the magnificent tightness of Sherlock’s arse before thrusting back in. John’s rhythm became faster, eliciting little moans from Sherlock with some particular rough thrusts. “Pet…” John waited till he had the full attention of Sherlock’s brilliant mind. What was left of it, anyway. “Lift up your legs,” he demanded, his voice thick with arousal and need.
Sherlock sighed. “I cried when you called me a
The shocked look on John’s face was enough to prompt him to elaborate: “Everything that happened was consensual, John.” Sherlock smiled bitterly. “He knew exactly how to take me to subspace, but he always left me there, alone. When we were done with a scene, he didn’t care much about me afterwards. The humiliation was exciting at first but after a while it left me feeling utterly worthless. I didn’t know how to communicate my needs outside of a scene then and even now I feel insecure about it!” he hissed.
“Yup,” John chortles.  “Figured if we both needed a wash, might as well consolidate my efforts.  On a related note, we need a few new flannels.  This was the only one that escaped the initial clean-up effort unscathed and,” he gazes down at his crotch with a lopsided grin, “it may now be tainted by association.”
Sherlock whirls to face him, his face all astonishment.  If it wasn’t such a serious moment, John would probably laugh at how gobsmacked Sherlock looks.  He flounders wordlessly, his mouth opening and shutting a few times before he narrows his eyes at John and scrutinizes him ruthlessly.  That’s something John didn’t expect; he didn’t think Sherlock wouldn’t believe him.  The man sees through everyone and everything.  John had thought it’d be obvious.
“Why not?”
“And she’ll have
“Better get to work,” John snaps and flips open the first ledger.  “If we’re going to actually stay the night, I’d like to get to a bed before midnight.”
His brain seems determined to tear itself to bits.  It’s not just the eerily prescient prediction from a shadow of his dead wife; this thing between him and Sherlock could be the making of his entire life at last or it could destroy everything they’ve cobbled together.  His friends, the family they’ve made between them, the so-called ‘job’ he shares with Sherlock, one he loves that gives him danger and fulfillment and respect.  Oh, God,
Rosie giggles in delight as John chases her in a half-circle around the bed to where she is now ‘hiding’ behind Sherlock’s legs as he stands at his dresser; Sherlock blinks confusedly as he twists this way and that, trying to get a look at Rosie as she ducks from one side to the other to avoid the reach of John’s arm.
“I, erm,” Sherlock mumbles then starts again.  “I took this side of the bed because it won’t put you on your bad shoulder.  I … hope that’s all right.”
John stares at the hands he has clasped in front of him.  “That’s the weird bit: I wasn’t even thinking of Mary until the words came out of my mouth.”
“Wow.”
*****
“Sherlock, I’m only trying to—”
trying to impress?”
“John—”
“Now,” Sherlock begins in a business-like tone, his ‘armor’ back in place, “let me show you some modifications I’ve made to the flat in anticipation of your arrival.”
“Did you have any particular requests?” he asks.
o	July(ish) – Mary’s death (extrapolated from several-month montage of parenting); Rosie is approx. 7 months old
Sherlock shakes his head and fidgets with his fingers.  “Not since before I … fell.”
Sherlock’s heart thunders in his chest and it’s all he can do to keep a straight face that isn’t crimson.  Just hearing John say such things makes his pulse race and pound at his ear drums.
John visibly startles at this, as if he only just realizes that he’s not sexually active and hasn’t been for some time.  “Not at all.  But you’ve just said—”
“How long before you came back to London did this happen?”
that could have been a hell of a lot worse.  Why
“No,” John says, “with me.  Would you … would you stay … with me?”
He’d been perfectly content to leave it at that, ready to turn back and finish the tea that’s probably cold by now.  John forgets momentarily, however, that children are unpredictable and have a tendency to expose hidden things that adults are afraid to let out into the open.  John is halfway back to the kitchen when the little squeak of voice startles him.
Eventually, Sherlock says, “For ages,” in a broken whisper.
“I know, love, I know,” John answers, reaching out around Sherlock’s hip to touch his fingertips to Rosie’s outstretched palm.  “I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I made you ouchie.”
“That man didn’t have a best friend with a small daughter who depends on the two of us for her livelihood,” the detective responds quietly.
John digs in his trouser pocket and unearths his mobile, thumbing through the gallery for a moment until he lands on the picture he wants.  A few months ago after a case, he’d been possessed of a silly mood and took a snap of Sherlock just after his triumphant Great Reveal.  As he was winding his scarf back around his neck, Sherlock’s eyes had caught John’s and he’d winked theatrically.  Somehow, John had managed to catch him at the perfect moment: dark curls swirling around his face, cheeks flushed, lips turned up in a quirked grin, eyes dancing with mischief, and his fingers just pulling the blue wool tight at his throat.  If any single photograph can distill the essence of the Sherlock that John has fallen in love with, this is it.  John turns the phone towards Alex and watches, gratified, as his mouth drops open in a comically large O-shape.
Sherlock stays quiet as John bangs around more than necessary for making tea.  John doesn’t know the answer to any of those ‘What If’ questions that ran through his head nor does he understand why suddenly the life-or-death daily reality of what they do suddenly seems terrifying as well as exciting, where it used to be simply exhilarating.  John just adds it to the pile of unanswered questions swirling around him since he came back here to stay.
The hitch in John’s voice as he finishes is minute but Sherlock catches it, and so he has to clench his eyes shut and croak around a tightness in his throat.  “You’re welcome, John.  Of course.”
“Necessary,” Sherlock confirms, “given that Rosie has been toddling or walking outright with regularity for the last several weeks. I’ve decided that—”
“Um….”
“Wake up, Sherlock.  Come on, come back to me.  I know you can hear me, come on.  Wake up, Sherlock.”  His voice sounds desperate towards the end.  The last thing he wants to do is startle the man – he has too much experience with what can come from waking someone in the throes of a nightmare, especially if it’s something like PTSD.  Contrary to what John had hoped for that his voice, as calm and reassuring as he can manage, would soothe his friend and allow him to shake loose from the dream but the sound of John’s words seem to catapult Sherlock into agony.
o	January 6 – end of TLD events: Sherlock’s 40th birthday; teasing about The Woman; John's confession of infidelity
When his heart starts beating again, he manages to say, “Okay,” before he crosses the room and begins to seat himself in the rocker.
“For fuck’s sake, Sherlock!” John rages, being decidedly rougher than he should be when placing the line of stitches just above Sherlock’s right hip curving up and back towards his ribs.  The gash is worryingly long but not deep.  “Do you
He hears the detective hum in questioning acknowledgement as he riffles through the diaper bag for clothes for Rosie.
John’s smile is easy but there’s just enough of a leading edge to his voice.  Alex smiles and nods as he hands the phone back.
“What needs, precisely, would those be?”
A soft wuffling sound comes from Rosie, vibrating against Sherlock’s pectoral, and he smiles when he realizes that she’s fallen asleep on him.  John must realize as much as well, a short exhalation of breath taking the place of a laugh.  Sherlock lifts his head and regards John, gesturing briefly towards his bedroom with his chin, indicating his intention to lay Rosie down for a nap.  John looks … disappointed for a moment – odd – then nods silently.  Upon returning to the sitting room, Sherlock finds John unmoved but for the hands that have clasped between his knees, so Sherlock resumes his seat at the desk.  John clenches and unclenches his fingers a few times before he speaks in a low voice, his eyes darting towards the now-closed door of Sherlock’s bedroom.
“A working title, I suppose you would say.”
At first, John believes that Sherlock has been the only one shifting and changing in this new iteration of Baker Street.  More stable, less manic, more … content, Sherlock blossoms into the best version of himself that John has ever known.  John, however, feels that he is as he ever was, at least in essentials.  The stress and grief and pain of Mary’s lies, betrayal, and eventual death has ebbed enough that he no longer feels it as a constant throbbing agony but more like a hangnail that only pains him when he catches it on something that rips open the wound.  He supposes that this is how most people probably feel when they suffer a situation like this, but John really doesn’t have a frame of reference other than when Ella tells him what’s ‘normal’.  Between his father leaving when John was small, his mother’s alcoholism, and his strained relationship with Harry, John’s never known his life to exist without dysfunction and stress, so for quite some time he doesn’t feel that he has changed.
“John?” Sherlock says again, only this time John notices that it’s distinctly a question.  “John, what do you want?”
utter that word about yourself.  Never again in my presence, do you hear me?”
“Of course,” the detective responds swiftly.
“Mycroft, as much as I
“No, no, John…. I’m sorry,
Sherlock’s stomach drops away and he stares at John.  The doctor stiffens suddenly, as if he’s only just realized what he’s said, and although his facial expression doesn’t change, his voice sounds controlled.
A low rumble of voice that could be his name hits John’s ears as he leans towards the door but Sherlock talks to himself when John’s not there all the time, so it doesn’t stop John from swinging the door open to ask his question again.  Once John takes a step into the room, the enquiry freezes on his lips and all his stunned brain can manage to put forth is that he’s not sure whether or not he wishes he hadn’t come in.  He barely even registers the feel of the doorknob in his hand as he clutches it for support, he just stares.  And stares.  And no matter how much he stares, he can’t seem to process what he’s seeing.
Sherlock starts to speak but then his eyes narrow at John and the anger drains from his face.  “You’re not doing well, are you, John?”
Baker Street works.  Sherlock becomes a much more regular, even enthusiastic, minder for Rosie, seeming to be genuinely delighted in coaching her through various cognitive and physical milestones – although he is violently opposed to the milestones associated with teething; little wonder – and regales John with stories of their activities during each day that he spends at the clinic, away from Baker Street.  Only a few days a week, but John still aches for the things he’s missing that Sherlock gets to see with Rosie.  That being said, he’s certainly glad that the person who is seeing them is someone who loves her; John knows that in no uncertain terms.  In the months John and Rosie have lived at Baker Street, Sherlock staunchly refuses to take any case, be it from Lestrade or his email, which ranks over a five.  John only presses him on it once, being flabbergasted into silence when Sherlock explains.
“Sherlock, wake up!  Come on, wake up!
“I’m not.”  John’s remains placid as Sherlock finally drops the pretense of staring at his phone.
The detective stretches his slim right leg from where it had been crossed over his left and regards it thoughtfully.  “They do come in handy here and there.  Although it does make trouser shopping more difficult.”
“She’s recreating whichever style of build you’re less likely to kick over,” John rejoins, amused.  “That hardly makes her the next Norman Foster.”
*****
to be.
“Never fails to amaze me how taken she is with you,” John remarks.
Oh God.  John’s eyes pinch shut for a moment and he has to take a steadying gulp of air before he can continue in an even tone.  His heart aches painfully behind his ribs but he tries not to let it show.  He lets a soft hand at Sherlock’s shoulders accompany his words when he speaks again.
This draws a loud chuckle out of John despite the wobbly feeling in his gut.  “Yes, I suppose kissing Sherlock would be quite an experiment.”
John clamps his lips together momentarily to keep from laughing.  “As a matter of fact, she did.”
John squelches a smile.  He talked to Dr. Simon for no more than thirty seconds once Sherlock left.  “Mmmmm,” he mutters noncommittally, rocking Rosie.  He has no doubt waiting the detective out will yield interesting results.  He’s not wrong.
His flatmate straightens in his armchair, his eyes flicking up to catch Sherlock’s from his former gaze down at his hands clasped between his knees.
Sherlock turns his back, walks towards the window, and fingers his violin where it’s propped in the corner of his chair.  “I’m not her father, John.”
A voice on the other end of the phone that is distinctly Not Mycroft follows after a light clearing of the throat.  “Mr. Holmes, good evening.  I believe I have just the thing for you.  I’ll be in touch with details from my office tomorrow before lunch.”
Jogging up the stairs, John hears some shuffling about towards the back of the flat which means that His Royal Highness must have deigned to rouse himself for the day.  After eleven, so it’s about bloody time. John’s left Rosie with Mrs. Hudson the way he does every Monday – her “special day with her honorary granddaughter” as Mrs. Hudson puts it – so he doesn’t worry about the noise he’s making as he bangs around in the drawers of the sitting room desk, cursing increasingly loudly when he discovers that Rosie’s papers seem to have completely vanished.  A few muffled thumps from the back to the flat draw John’s attention and, in the interest of time, he resolves to go ask Sherlock where he stashed the damn folder so that John can just bloody well get it and get out of here.
He’s not making sense and something behind Sherlock’s eyes splinters.
John scoffs as he stands in the doorway from the kitchen, blowing gently across the surface of the tea he’s just poured for Sherlock as the steam billows up in fragrant curls.  The freshly boiled water in his own mug stands steeping on the counter but Sherlock always takes sugar in his so John starts his first to give it plenty of time to dissolve.  The detective reaches out a long arm for the mug which John hands over with a chuckle.
*****
Sherlock doesn’t attempt to contradict him – he was distracted, after all – but he does slide his long fingers in between John’s again, squeezing just enough for John to feel it.  John’s pulse hammers in his ears and he stares down at their joined fingers.  His voice comes out just above a whisper but it sounds too loud.
She gives a heavy sigh.
my sexual history off of me,” John says with a small smile.  “Bit unbalanced.”
“You don’t have to,” John insists.  “You don’t ever have to share if you’re uncomfortable—”
“Brilliant,” John grouses, “just bloody brilliant.”
John’s eyes narrow and the blue depths are almost icy in their sharpness.  “I do.  When you’re not up to something.  And the fact that you’re being so agreeable about it right now means you’re definitely up to something, I just haven’t figured out what it is yet.”
“What did they do to you?”
Sherlock clears his throat and gazes down at his lap.  “I’m not sure, actually.  Lady Smallwood actually gave me the case but she said she’d have to call me from her office tomorrow to give the details.”
“Just because you don’t witness my exercise doesn’t mean it doesn’t occur, John,” the detective rejoins, smirking.
John rises from his chair and walks to the kitchen.  Standing in the door frame, he speaks without turning around.  “Please just … I know what we do is dangerous but for God’s sake—for
“Well, I—” Sherlock stammers.
John nods wordlessly in return so Sherlock picks up his bow.  For the first few long strokes across the strings, Sherlock watches John’s eyes, letting the swirling depths of ocean-blue set the pace of his pulls on his violin.  The unwavering strength of John’s gaze burns at something in his stomach so when the tempo picks up, Sherlock turns away, letting the jaunty rhythm of the piece move his limbs into a lilting dance of instrument and musician and melody.  He coaxes the bouncing cascade of notes out and lets the short, sharp strokes of his bow occupy his thoughts throughout the entire up-tempo section.  He never turns to face John again, even when the middle section drifts up into a legato melody almost like a lullaby, but he can feel the doctor’s gaze on him the entire time, intense and focused and warm.  As the music picks up again, Sherlock finds himself irresistibly pulled by the liveliness of the tune and gives in to the impulse to dance across the sitting room.  Undoubtedly somewhat ridiculous in his motion, Sherlock hears John laugh but the sound caresses rather than jolts.  It’s not a laugh of derision; his doctor laughs in delight and the sound sparkles within his veins.  Sherlock finishes the final notes with a flourish and whirls to face John, his chest heaving with the effort, his cheeks flushed, his mouth turned up, and his pulse a bit erratic from giddiness.
There is a tremendous amount of rustling, hushed angry whispers, and a soft, “absolutely not!” from his brother before some disturbance against the mouthpiece of Mycroft’s phone.

“I love you too, darling,” he says with a smile.

A deep chuckle rumbles the floorboards above him and John can’t help but return Sherlock’s mischievous grin when he thunders back down the stairs leading to John’s bedroom.

“You woke her?  On purpose?” Sherlock may still be a bit groggy from sleep (little wonder; it’s the first sleep he’s had in 72 hours), but he finds it unlikely that John would intentionally deprive his daughter of rest.
“So … anything?”
Sherlock scowls, lowering his brows.  “The ‘more than usual’ was uncalled for,” he says primly.
“Lady Smallwood,” Sherlock says succinctly.
“But I’m not her father, John.”
A heavy exhalation leaves his lips.  Sherlock pulls his legs up from the floor and wraps his arms around them, curls into himself; he’s well aware of what the posture will read as but he feels safer this way.  He has to look away from John as he speaks so he studies the knees of his trousers.
John growls and snatches away the ledgers Sherlock pointed him towards in order to plop himself behind a desk on the other end of the office.  “Why do I even put up with you?”
John scoffs.  Loudly.  “Ta, I did know that.  In addition to being the father of a toddler, I am a doctor, after all.”
Sherlock settles in the rocker and lays Rosie on her stomach against his chest, one arm under her bottom; the little girl wriggles a bit until her warm face presses against Sherlock’s neck.  John leans forward, dropping his face into his upturned palms and scrubbing his fingers across his closed eyes.  Sherlock clenches his own shut against the weak light from the street lamp just outside John’s window and lets himself savor this quiet moment – his god-daughter’s moist breath puffing against his throat as her sobs ebb away, the clutch of her tiny fingers against the collar of his t-shirt, another fist twining around one of the curls at the nape of his neck.  Sherlock allows himself this one indulgence, here in the dark where even John won’t see.
John nods and gives a tight smile.  “A brief diagnosis is fine.”
Sherlock debates prolonging the conversation, trying to issue some sort of apology, but decides it’s probably a better idea to just let John use the silence and the distraction of the Work to cool his head a bit.  Reapplying himself to the data, Sherlock barely notices the passing of hours as he clacks away at the keyboard, only pausing here and there to look over the ledgers that John silently lays next to his computer.  Somewhere around 10:45 or so, Sherlock twists his neck this way and that, massaging out the stiffness in the muscles with his fingertips and gazing around the room, baffled to find it completely dark but for the single lamp John has turned on over the desk he occupies.  He’s similarly bewildered to find John polishing off the remnants of some chips in a takeaway container, grinning at him with a lopsided smirk.
Sherlock regards Rosie with a fond smile on his face and when he lifts his head to include John, the expression is so warm and unguarded that it staggers John.  It feels as if Sherlock has cracked open a tiny window into his heart and where John expected to find a single lit match he found a bonfire.  He’s so overwhelmed by it that he actually moves back a step or two, his smile wobbling as he has to reposition Rosie on his hip.
“Play the gypsy one?” John asks, hesitant.
Another laugh bubbles up from John’s belly.  “Yeah, shame that he’s well aware of it.  And a proper genius, too.  Most brilliant, amazing man I’ve ever met.  No shame in being proud of that, right?”
“Well, I’ve noticed it’s your preferred side of the bed anyway, so….”  Sherlock trails off and glances away again when John sits carefully on the edge of the mattress and swings his feet beneath the covers.
Something heartbreakingly vulnerable tints Sherlock’s expression.  “It’s just that it’s been so long since you’ve said.  You haven’t called me that in ages.”
*****
In his room, obvious; John’s already seen proof of that.  And really, that would be the most obvious choice for most people.  The shower, maybe?  That’s another logical choice; usually that’s what John does, for ease of clean up and convenient background noise, especially now that he shares a room with his two-year-old daughter.  Sherlock usually precedes John into the bath in the mornings now … has John ever stepped in under the stream of water and touched his own cock just after Sherlock had been in there doing the same thing?  Something about the thought of that, the possibility that they may have come in the same place just minutes apart makes John’s limbs feel watery.
In a disconnected way, John tells himself that it isn’t really anything all that shocking.  As Sherlock himself said, he’s human and has the same needs and ‘biological imperatives’ as any other mature human male.  Erections, particularly in the mornings, are just another thing that proves this.  John just hadn’t been quite so
Sherlock protests in his most put-upon tone, but he’s already up throwing away his food container and flicking the off switch on the computer.
“You must know, John.”
“Come on, you rude wanker.  Only polite to show up when we say we will so the poor woman can go to bed.”
Sherlock stiffens.  “It’s fine, John.  You can leave off the stitches now.”
His heart pounds in his chest when Sherlock wanders into the kitchen in just his dressing gown, curls damp from his recent bath.  He jumps when Sherlock rests a hand on his shoulder as the detective reaches around him for the marmalade, a cloud of fragrant, humid air from the bathroom still following in the detective’s wake and sending John’s senses into high alert.  The man went to bloody Buckingham Palace in a sheet and John barely turned a head, but now it takes nearly ten solid minutes for John’s pulse to go back to normal, scowling into his cereal bowl all the while.  An accidental brush of Sherlock’s fingertips across the back of John’s neck make him suck in half the oxygen in the room while the detective gives one of his theatrical speeches that John has taken to calling “The Great Reveal” – although Agatha Christie would probably call it the dénouement – earning him a questioning (suspicious?) glance from Lestrade that John doggedly ignores.
He turns at the sound of her voice and is surprised to see her regarding him with a kind but concerned expression.
Sherlock pulls a face that makes John chuckle and deposits his mobile in his pocket.  “Just finished, I think.  Grotesque.”
If Sherlock hadn’t been so surprised, he may have been able to rein in his startled response but he knows John sees it, the panic in his eyes.  “Don’t be ridiculous,” he answers, too quickly.  “Of course there isn’t.”
John can’t help but laugh. “She’s doing nothing of the kind.  Sherlock, Rosie calls me ‘Dada’ or ‘Daddy’, not ‘Papa’.  She’s
Sherlock doesn’t mention it when John’s arm slides up around Sherlock and over the ball of his shoulder.  He just angles his face in towards John’s chest, so John lets it pass when Sherlock scoots closer, his long body touching John’s all the way down to their ankles.  John drifts back into sleep listening to the puffs of Sherlock’s breaths against his chest.
Sherlock can feel a blush rise up but he answers as best he can.  “I don’t really have an answer you’ll find satisfying, I think.  It varies.  I’ve certainly done it more frequently since you’ve moved back in.”  He says it without thinking so he startles a bit at the astonished look that graces John’s face.  Before the doctor can make any assumptions, Sherlock quickly amends, “Common animal behavior, John; normal response to introducing another sexually mature adult into a confined ‘herd’.”
A quick flick upwards with his eyes and John sees that Sherlock has clamped his own lids shut.  John definitely would have remembered a long, inelegant gash across the back of Sherlock’s shoulder on any of the previous times he’s patched up the detective so this is definitely noteworthy.  His flatmate remains resolutely silent and unseeing as John goes over to the side table, clicks on another lamp for more light, and comes back for a better look.  When he returns, Sherlock still has his eyes shut and several places on the thin face twitch randomly but he doesn’t resist as John wraps a hand around the detective’s ribcage to turn him for a closer study of the scar.  As Sherlock shuffles to face away from John, John gets the better look he wanted and the doctor is suddenly, stupidly afraid that he might vomit on the carpet.
The silence hangs, so John prompts, “What’s it called?”
John arches an eyebrow as he rights Rosie in his lap.  “So, what is the case about?”
John smirks at her back as the door clicks shut.  He turns to regard Sherlock and pulls up short at the expression on his friend’s face.  There’s something sharp in the blue-green eyes, something that makes John’s pulse hammer in his throat until Rosie bleats at him from her place in the little supportive chair that they placed her in on the exam table.  John’s legs wobble a bit when he gets up to retrieve her.     They stay quiet for a long moment after John has cuddled Rosie in his lap but eventually John has to ask, “So what was all that with you taking the blame for the tea?”
“John… John, I didn’t want to have to tell you this but I’m concerned about Rosie.  I believe that there is some cognitive problem that we hadn’t discovered before and, as her father, you should be aware of it.”
John growls under his breath but stays quiet as she continues,
Sherlock turns away from John long enough to smooth his expression, making a show of taking off and folding his dressing gown to justify his hesitance.  Knowing he can’t dither any longer, Sherlock makes his way back to the bed and slides beneath the sheets.  Every skin cell uncovered by his pajamas soaks up data, cataloguing the warmth left behind by John’s body, the smell, the radiating heat of John’s body so nearby.  John has rolled away, facing the wall even though it puts him on his bad shoulder; Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, mind racing.  He can tell just from the expanse of John’s back that he sees out of his peripheral vision that the muscles are tense; John wants to say something but is holding back.  Sherlock breaks the ice as best he can.

“Tea time tomorrow, I should think,” Sherlock agrees, studying John’s face which he now seems determined not to show Sherlock in its entirety.  “Should call Molly and see if she can mind Rosie, though.  The case isn’t in London, so we’ll need to stay the night.”
“I know that,” Sherlock assures him.  “It’s just not quite the right time yet.  As you said the night Rosie got burned: I will tell you, just not yet.”
“I do,” John says smugly.  “Because I know you, Sherlock.  If you chose that particular thing, you chose it because it’s shaped like a cock, not in spite of it.  And
The months at Baker Street that follow John’s return prove to be a profound mix of elation and bafflement for Sherlock.  Having John back in his rightful place is a joy so acute that a telltale tightness pinches behind his sternum every time Sherlock allows himself to stop and give it active thought.  They are orbiting each other as they once were and it feels as if no time has passed.  He refuses to stop and consider this too often, not only because it makes him unforgivably maudlin but because he knows that even John could recognize the symptoms of peculiar affection if given enough opportunities to see it.  The last thing the detective wants to do now that he’s just gotten John back is unsettle him enough to give an excuse to “get on his feet” with his own flat.  Especially given that this would also remove the littlest Watson from Sherlock’s immediate sphere as well.
“Not the teasing, you git,” John says, a tiny smile fading away as he continues.  “This.”  He waves his hand around vaguely to indicate the boxes.  “I know that we’ve rebuilt the flat to the way it was and you said it’s fine until we get on our feet but—”
in Hell.
“It … isn’t finished,” Sherlock answers.  “A work in progress, in a manner of speaking.”
“Nope,” John says immediately.  After a deep exhale, John clears his throat and says, “Sorry.  I’m … trying to get better about this.  Ella says—”
“I suppose that means we’re not setting off straight away then,” John says stiffly.
Sherlock stares back flatly.  “Are you suggesting that only gay men enjoy the sensation of penetration?  Aside from being factually unsupportable – statistically speaking, more heterosexuals engage in anal sex than homosexual men—”
o	December – events of From the Mouths of Babes
“I did not.  I looked comfortable and responsible for a toddler who has a knack for ruining clothing.”
“Sorry you have to … I mean, it must be awkward,” Alex rolls his eyes away and they fill a bit.  “Having to patch up the bum of some poof who can’t even control his own—”
“I am not!” he retorts hotly.  “I thought she was a bloody nuisance and spent most of the time wanting to give her a good slap.”
“Absolutely,” Sherlock confirms, grinning into Rosie’s face as she starts buzzing again.  “Fascinating creatures.”
Sherlock keeps his gaze fixed on Rosie and jigs her up and down in his arms.  “Yes, darling,” Sherlock stumbles over the endearment, “Papa loves Daddy.  Very much.”
John gives an unsteady chuckle.  “Fair enough,” he confirms.
.  And yet, John is shuffling over to the far side of the bed, pushing the sheet down just enough to possibly be an invitation but not so obvious as to cause embarrassment if Sherlock refuses.
John shivers and grabs one of Sherlock’s hands to slide it down his stomach, guiding the long fingers around his own thick erection. Sherlock curses into the back of John’s neck and the long fingers set up a tight stroke of John’s cock as he thrusts helplessly into John’s arse.  John’s fingers clutch at Sherlock’s hips, groaning as each stroke Sherlock makes on John’s cock matches a thrust forward against his arse.  An embarrassingly short time later, John strains up onto the balls of his feet, moaning as Sherlock presses two fingers beneath John’s bollocks, and oh God, he’s coming so hard his knees shake.  Sherlock bites down on the juncture of John’s neck and shoulder as his hips give one last hard thrust forward and paint the small of John’s back with his release.
“I have a confession,” he murmurs in the direction of the crown molding.
John’s throat hitches but he nods.  “Actually, I slept just fine.”  The silence sits heavy for a second.  “Thanks for staying.  It helped.”
embarrass himself spectacularly by going full mast hard the instant he gets in bed.  Christ, what a nightmare.  He curses Mycroft and Lady Smallwood and whoever the fuck else is responsible for this case.  If they’d stayed in London, John would have had home field advantage for giving a little push at what they’d been dancing around this morning.  There’d been no doubt in John’s mind that Sherlock had been looking at John – or at least, trying not to look and failing miserably – in the bath and if he’d been at home right now where he could retreat to his bedroom if it turned out he was wrong about things, this would have been so much bloody easier.  Instead, he’s out in a little hole-in-the-wall town (which he probably would have found lovely in other circumstances) investigating something that Sherlock should have been able to solve without even putting his trousers on and now having to share a bloody bed with him.  Although, thinking about Sherlock without trousers on will definitely not aid the situation, considering what was going on the last time he saw Sherlock without trousers.
Sherlock shrugs insouciantly but even John will see the tightness in the gesture.  “I suppose it was inevitable.”
“Nightmare, then?”
“Skin-to-skin contact.”
Sherlock’s heart seems to stop in his chest when John kneels up on the bed and clasps at the round of Sherlock’s shoulder with one hand and slides the other up the arm supporting Rosie.  With John on his knees on the bed, they’re of a height, so when the doctor leans forward and places his lips on Rosie’s cheek, John is so close that Sherlock can feel the warmth of John’s breath strike his throat in just the same place as Rosie’s.  John pulls back from Rosie but doesn’t pull away, doesn’t drop back to the bed, simply kneels here close to Sherlock.  He’d never precisely understood the idea of feeling as if your heart was in your throat until that moment, with John’s hands on his arms, John’s sleeping daughter clasped between them, and John’s eyes tracing over his face in the darkness.  He feels his arms begin to tremble.  He
“Of course you are,” his friend replies softly.
Sherlock gapes at him and John resolutely applies himself to laying the last few stitches.  The detective winces a few more times as John works – little wonder; his typically peerless focus under stress is shot to hell – but Sherlock doesn’t comment.  John crouches under Sherlock’s lifted arm to place the last few, grimacing and batting at the dangling cotton of his mangled shirt sleeve that keeps darting in front of John’s line of vision.
John’s grin widens.  “You have cold hands,” he says simply.  John can’t really pinpoint precisely why he finds this funny but it makes him laugh, a low chuckle that teases an answering rumble from the man next to him.
Sherlock nods but continues forward towards the bed.  Surprisingly, John shakes his head.
He supposes that it’s the ‘please’ that induces Sherlock to answer.  “You were a soldier, John; a doctor-soldier.  Surely you recognize the signs.”  The flatness of the tone pushes John that much closer to vomiting.
“It’s about me?” he croaks out.  It feels as if a snooker ball lodged itself in his throat.
And then he understands.  “You dreamt I got shot?”
your fault.”
*****
John straightens.  “How long, Sherlock?”  He asks it again when he doesn’t receive a reply.
Alex nods and goes back to staring at John’s hands.
“Well, it’s not as if you can’t just
“John,” his friend manages eventually, “you don’t mean—you can’t be saying—”
He feels his forehead pinch as he scans his Mind Palace quickly for which of the dozens of pieces he’s played that have a Romany bent to them that John would consider “the gypsy one” and lands on a piece he’d played last Midsummer that the doctor had taken a fancy to even though he’d only heard it the once.
Sherlock smiled. “Yes, John.”
John let go of Sherlock’s wrists when he noticed his reaction and quickly moved to stand in front of the quivering man. “You’re crying, sweetheart. Are you alright?” John checked in with him.
“Is everything alright, John?” he mirrored John’s words from earlier as if it wasn’t
ignore–”
“Then ask your
“Yes,” Sherlock said curtly, determined not to let his disappointment show while he mentally cancelled half of his plans for the day. He reluctantly lifted his head from John’s chest and sat cross-legged on the sheets opposite of him while John propped himself up against his pillow. The sudden loss of skin-on-skin contact left Sherlock feeling cold, so he reached for his blanket and wrapped it around his naked upper body. “Actually, I don’t really know where to start. There are many things we should talk about, so I’ll probably say the most important ones first. I love you, John. I love the things we did so far and I still want to play with you.”
, Sherlock. Why was I angry with you?”
“I enjoy nipple play; clamps, ice, whatever you can think of. Aside from that, you already know what I like.”
Mrs Hudson fidgeted with the hem of the tablecloth before she finally spoke. “It’s none of my business, John, but I know when something’s not quite right between the two of you.”
Sherlock heaved a sigh. Wasn’t it obvious by now? “The case is basically solved.”
Of course John tried to help Sherlock and the Yard as best as he could with the case, but the biochemical tests and the scientific trial and error were definitely Sherlock’s department and at the moment the main suspect’s alibi depended on exactly that.
Sherlock went on: “Oliver, yes,
. “I didn’t cry because it was too painful or I wanted you to stop. For a moment everything felt incredibly intense, that’s all. I did not safeword because I didn’t have to. Everything you did, every reaction you caused was well within my limits, John.”
“Look, it’s just that you don’t usually… I mean, are you sure?”
John picked up the riding crop and Sherlock hissed when the broad, cool, smooth leather tip was dragged up and down the underside of his pulsing cock. “Mmh, poor boy. Are you close?” John asked with feigned cluelessness.
… Yes. Y-Yes, sir, I need to come.”
“I love it when you’re all needy and desperate for me,” John breathed and pressed a chaste kiss against the head of Sherlock’s cock.
was pleased with himself. “Then why on earth didn’t you?” Sherlock snapped and glared at John. Falling behind with a case was beyond unacceptable.
Instead of choosing the riding crop, John reached for the bottle of lube. He coated the index and middle finger of his left hand with a proper amount of the transparent gel and placed his right hand on the small of Sherlock’s back to steady him.
“Yes, Captain.”
“Please hear me out, yeah? It’s about your punishment yesterday. I have already told you that I don’t like inflicting too much pain. Of course I checked in with you to make sure that you were completely okay with the things we did, but it’s still a bit difficult for me. We already are in a relationship. I care about you in ways that exceed simple aftercare for a sub and I just…” John heaved a sigh. “I’ve never seen you cry, Sherlock.”
“What happened?” John asked when they were inside the cab and Sherlock basically yelled their destination at the cabbie. “Why the airport? Did I… miss anything; are we going to a different country?” Seemed just like Sherlock to leave in a hurry and not even bother with any luggage. Of course, the clever git knew that John always carried his passport with him. It had actually helped him to save a lot of time when getting access to a crime scene; to prove that he was
Sherlock made a non-committal sound.
It was the very first thing he had learnt about his relationship with Sherlock. The consulting detective was married to his work and he was a very faithful husband indeed.
, definitely,' Sherlock thought. It was more than obvious from John’s posture: as if he was standing to attention, yet with the undeniable authority of
“Good boy,” John cooed when Sherlock let go off his finger. He didn’t miss how Sherlock’s cheeks tinged pink at the praise.
won’t jerk you off either. And you better come before I do, or not at all,” he commanded in his Captain voice.
“Sherlock?”
“Alright,” John promised, but his expression changed completely when he eventually scrolled through the text. He read it a second time to make sure he wasn’t too pissed to just see what his eyes wanted him to see. “Oh, sweetheart… I’m so sorry,” John choked out and pulled Sherlock closer against him with his free hand. “I know what this must’ve looked like to you, but I love you. I’d never…
Sherlock didn’t know how much time passed before he managed to answer. “Yes, sir.”
… that was a different and quite complex thing altogether. Sherlock wasn’t fragile per se, but John knew from experience that he tended to ignore his physical limits when he had more important things on his mind. It didn’t make him vulnerable by default, but it could become very dangerous under the wrong circumstances. When Sherlock chose his need to please and submit over his own limits…
John had no idea who Greg’s girlfriend could be or why Sherlock was so agitated about it, but he sure as hell wouldn’t ask. Greg already looked uncomfortable without revealing any of the details, but there was something else that John was rather keen to know: “Insufferable
“Fuck me, please. I’m begging you, John. I–
Sherlock rested his chin on top of the shorter man’s head. The movement was ever so soft and careful; a gesture of 'I can easily draw back if it makes you feel uncomfortable'. But John did not feel uncomfortable, if anything he leant into the touch; even nuzzled his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck. They stayed like this for several minutes without saying a word. Words were unnecessary anyway now that John finally allowed himself to
John did not know which reaction was more appropriate: rolling his eyes and giving an exasperated sigh or laughing hysterically. Only Sherlock had the nerve to call an armed criminal who pointed a gun at his head 'idiot'. In the end, he did neither and reached slowly, ever so slowly, for his own gun instead.
'You didn’t,' Sherlock thought, 'you really didn’t and you’re a bloody idiot for even thinking this, John!' He wanted to give John the same answer as yesterday, but that wouldn’t change anything. No, he’d have to change tactics. “What makes you think you hurt me?” he asked instead.
First of all, sorry for being away for so long! Real life kept getting in the way of writing, but somehow this still turned into a 9k words chapter.
“What?” he asked mildly annoyed when John smirked at him.
“Come here.”
“He’s, um…” Greg cleared his throat, “he’s become insufferable since he figured out that I’m in a relationship he doesn’t approve of.”
Sherlock released John’s balls and moved higher, kissing and nibbling his way up John’s length. Once he located the head of John’s cock near the elastic waistband, he focused on that. It was impossible to actually close his lips around it, but Sherlock enthusiastically lapped at it, wetting the annoying fabric with his saliva. The tip of the crop stopped caressing Sherlock’s arse and Sherlock moaned into John’s crotch when he was rewarded with a slap. Sherlock continued what he was doing, earning himself eight more slaps. Just as he figured out what worked and what didn’t, John pulled away.
The detective mewled. “Anything you want, sir.”
John arched back into Sherlock’s skilled fingers, enjoying every bit of it. “I’m, I’m– fuck I’m gonna come. Christ,
“You cried when the scene was over. I mean, you were very deep under, but it wasn’t that. I’ve pushed you too far and I didn’t even realise it at first, but that’s exactly why you acted the way you did yesterday. Subspace puts you in a very vulnerable state of mind and instead of helping you get back to vanilla space safely, you dropped.
he cared, but he didn’t say a single word about either. Not now, not yet. First, he would have to make a difference between venting his anger and helping Sherlock understand
Sherlock turned around and gave John an affectionate kiss. When they broke the kiss, he looked squarely into John’s eyes. “You like taking care of me,” he announced matter-of-factly.
John seemed startled. “It’s so off-limits for me that I didn’t even consider it until now.”
“Yes, Captain.” Sherlock gasped when John licked a wet stripe over his pulsing length from root to tip. He took a steadying breath. “In this fantasy, we’re not roleplaying. I
Sherlock brought himself to lock eyes with his favourite soldier. “Yes, John.”
John took a deep breath and exhaled audibly. He was too well aware that living in the same flat with Sherlock – let alone being in an intimate relationship with the insufferable prick – left no room for privacy, and yet… “If you really read this mail, you would know that it’s not stupid or unimportant but rather an invitation to a veteran reunion.
Eventually, John broke away gasping for breath and as Sherlock opened his eyes again he was a bit overwhelmed with the sight before him: John’s lips were kiss-swollen and slightly parted and his pupils were dilated to two black pools of arousal.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut when he felt the warmth of John’s hand on his lumbar vertebrae. It was a reassuring touch that connected immediately with the 'trust' area in his mind palace. Sherlock still gasped in surprise when two slick fingers began teasing and toying with his rim. John worked him open with cruel efficiency, not once brushing against his prostate. Sherlock tried to push his hips back into the touch, but John stopped him with a hard slap on his left arse cheek. “None of that. Behave, Sherlock!” he commanded sharply. Sherlock moaned when the small amount of pain flared on his skin, but he knew better than to misbehave on purpose.
“I know that it is an inconvenient time, but if I don’t say it now, I probably never will.” Sherlock made a little pause, but he knew that he would have to say it now; there was no way back anymore. His heart was thudding against his rib cage, but if anything some adrenaline was more than welcome in a situation like this. Sherlock cleared his throat in an attempt to hide his sudden nervousness and insecurity; tried, failed…
like I’m not sure?” Sherlock rasped in his low baritone voice.
“You can’t analyse everything as if it were a sample under your microscope, Sherlock. Feelings don’t work like that,
John looked at him in pure adoration. “That was brilliant.
– John buried his hands in Sherlock’s soft curls and kissed him back. They merely brushed their lips together, very tentatively at first, but it felt incredibly good and right and finally,
Sherlock sifted through the depths of his mind palace for a moment. “Knife play, wax play, breath play and collars are also off-limits. I’m fine with wearing wrist cuffs and ankle cuffs for bondage, though. What about your hard limits?”
“Yes, sweetheart?”
Sherlock slowly sank into his chair. The pleather felt weird on his naked skin, but it wasn’t entirely uncomfortable.
don’t work like that!”
“That’s not on my kink list, either. What if I want you to push my soft limits or try something that’s new for both of us?”
again. He managed a feeble: “Yes, sir.”
Sherlock would endure about any punishment to be his
“Where the fuck are they?!” Lestrade shouted after a while. They had completely lost sight of either Sherlock or the suspect. “Tell airport security to check all gates, exits and staff area, too!” he commanded one of his police officers, then addressed the other one. “Emma, go to the second floor, I’ll search the first one; John,
John was in an exceptionally cheerful mood and quickly made a second cup of tea. He was completely undeterred by Sherlock’s reproachful tone. “Yeah, I could have,” he smirked.
“Yeah, sorry. Of course I’m coming over, just give me some time. I’ll be there before you have to go, but there’s something else I have to do first.”
he was angry. The latter would be more effective when working on Sherlock’s lack of discipline.
The only possible solution for him was to subtly make John aware of his military kink and there was Sherlock’s problem in a nutshell: he did not want to beg for anything before John had even agreed to play
Sherlock mentally flipped through the diverse collection they’d purchased over the months and couldn’t suppress a grin. “Hm, yes.”

“Does it
“Shut up!” Thomas cried, his index finger quivering on the trigger.
call me 'pet'.”
Pros: He knew that John was glad whenever he showed some interest in his boyfriend’s social life and he would spend a whole evening in a room full of veterans and perhaps John would even wear his old uniform.
Watson. Sherlock grinned internally. He loved his boyfriend like this and was glad that everything went according to the plan that had popped into his mind the second he had read John’s email. Sherlock had observed that John automatically switched into Captain-mode whenever he provoked him on purpose. John on the other hand did not seem to notice Sherlock’s intent.
Sherlock arched up into John’s fist but instead of tipping him over the edge, John quickly closed his thumb and index finger around the base of Sherlock’s erection in a tight circle. Sherlock arched his neck and gave a frustrated, high-pitched whine when he realised that his desperate need for release was neglected for the sixth time in quick succession. His thighs were trembling hard and his cock twitched helplessly, but John only released the tight grip when he was sure that Sherlock wouldn’t come the moment he let go.
“You just solved one,” John reminded him decidedly friendly, paying little attention to the man who was gradually working himself into a frenzy. Underneath the façade of stoic calm, the army doctor was everything but.
John thought about it for a moment. This was definitely not unwelcome but still a bit unusual for Sherlock.
Of course Sherlock noticed the way John was trying to restrain himself. John wasn’t submissive and aside from that he didn’t enjoy being teased as much as Sherlock did… Sherlock gave the head of John’s cock another hard suck and took more of the hot, pulsing length into his mouth. He focused on breathing evenly through his nose when the thick glans nudged against the back of his throat. His jaw ached with the effort of taking all of John in but, inch by inch, he managed. Eventually, his nose was pressed against blond, slightly trimmed pubic hair and he inhaled the unique, musky scent of
“It is what it has always been,” the detective replied. It was true; they had tiptoed around this for ages now. As soon as both of them had caught their breath John leant in for another kiss, but he stopped when they heard footsteps on the staircase. They were lighter and also a tad faster than Mrs Hudson’s.
Suddenly, it was child’s play to deduce the emotions John had suffered through earlier. “It’s clear from your body language right now that you are still agitated about everything that happened. The thought of losing me still terrifies you, but it’s not about the fact that a bullet missed my head for 10.5 inches. It’s because everything that happened today reminded you of what it feels like to actually lose someone you love. You told me that a bit of edging isn’t enough to compensate my stupid mistake, but
“That’s better,” Moran said, a little out of breath. There was a trickle of blood running down his chin and a bruise was forming on his head. But John knew he wouldn’t hesitate now. No speeches. This was it.
Tea was just the thing for this situation. They could have a cuppa, settle down, and have a
Sherlock broke into a wide grin and raised his glass. “Touché, Doctor,” he toasted, and they both laughed.
, oh yes, divine idea. John would have confessed his undying love for their landlady then and there if he hadn’t felt like throwing up as soon as he opened his mouth.
and with unexpected embarrassment, John wondered if that had been meant for him. He thought of Sherlock lying next to him, holding his hand; his eyes strayed to the fine-boned fingers placing a slide under the microscope and warmth flooded his chest. If anyone could possibly
John was usually not this… demonstrative in public, of course. He was affectionate towards Sherlock in his own way, but he had always protested loudly whenever anyone saw them as more than friends. Sherlock had not expected him to agree to the dance. It was definitely
“I hope they paid you well,” John bit out, and the taxi driver shrugged and turned back. John fell back into his seat and sighed. It didn’t even matter if Sherlock were discovered – the cabbie was right. It wasn’t like they’d really tried to hide him all that well. Despite Mycroft’s invisible presence in the background, and in contrast to the meticulously planned details of Sherlock’s ‘death’, his return seemed incredibly well-planned. His temper flared. “Sherlock, who the hell are you
John recognizes his cue, as Sherlock has started to glance back and forth between the two of them with a desperate expression, so he picks up their twined hands.  John pulls Sherlock’s focus to him with a thumb and forefinger under his chin.
“Be that as it may,” John continues smoothly, “you ought to know by now that you don’t have to
“Besides, it is at least somewhat self-serving,” Sherlock says as he hoists himself to his feet.  “Haven’t I said I’d be lost without my blogger?”
Stepping just a foot or two into the room, Sherlock murmurs, “John?” in the gentlest whisper he can manage.
“I can—” John begins again.
“We can’t all dress ourselves exclusively at Primark, John.”
“Sherlock, how … how far down do these marks go?”
John’s procrastinating the unavoidable conversation, he realizes, as he stands here watching Sherlock dote on his daughter.  So he tells himself to just nut up and get on with it.
o	Late June/early July –
If you're new to this story, sorry to disappoint: it's not a second chapter, it's a plan for the future based on the response from the previous chapter's question on whether this should be a series or not.  Once I mentioned it, I couldn't get the plot bunny(ies) out of my head so I am embarking on a series to tell my interpretation of the post-series 4 "Baker Street Boys".  If you liked this story and - as many of you said in your comments on chapter 1 - want to see more of the "flashes" that I mentioned in my previous chapter's A/N, here's what you can expect:
“Jesus, Sherlock—”
Scoffing, John pads back for his own tea and returns with the steaming mug.  “I was medicine not architecture, remember? And with you to remind me how ordinary I am all the time?  Must be Mary’s influence.”
John’s face changes from one of confusion to the more predictable expression of frustration.  “What are you on about?”
“Uh huh,” he confirms.  “And you feed her?  Bathe her?  Dress her, change her nappies, play with her when she laughs, rock her when she cries, put her down to sleep—”
John chuckles and takes off after him, barely following Sherlock’s high speed chatter about the new baby monitor and nanny camera he’s installed or the nappy disposal dumb waiter/chute he’s built into the wall of John’s bedroom.
He pauses a moment in front of his arm chair, fingers tapping lightly on the neck of the violin laid across its seat, before he resumes pacing the living room.  “I need a case.”
John’s positive this isn’t really what Sherlock means to say.  The air in the tiny room feels alight with tension and anticipation and John’s entire focus narrows to the two stretches of skin beneath his fingers: his daughter’s warm belly as she perches on his knee and Sherlock’s long, smooth fingers.  Despite the hum of energy crowding around him, John smiles.
A grin pulls at John’s lips without him even planning it.  “Modifications?”
The detective’s watercolor eyes mist a bit as he crosses the room back towards where John and Rosie occupy the center. The little girl bats at dust motes floating in the crack of sunshine streaming in from the window.  Sherlock raises a finger and traces the soft curve of her chubby cheek, earning a giggle in return.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and smirks just a tiny bit.  “You see, I was just getting to a crucial moment, so ….”
“Rosie!” John cries, hoping that it sounds natural, and dashes into Sherlock’s room with his towel clutched loosely in his fist.
Mary chuckles and John just shakes his head and mutters, “Jesus.”
"Then why are you still standing there staring?”
“Please, Mycroft, you only ever wear the blue chalk-stripe suit that you had on last Tuesday when you’re feeling insecure about your weight.  So if it isn’t the treadmill, what—” The riffling noise happens again and this time, Sherlock is positive what the noise is.  Bed sheets.  His lips turn up at the edges.  “Mycroft, have you decided to take up fishing lately?”
“What’s the matter with you?”  John probes the instant the door clicks shut behind the clerk.
“You’re right.”
Sherlock snorts loudly and John jumps a bit, as if he’s only just realized what he’s said.
“What in the hell am I going to do, love?” he murmurs to her.  “Sorry about the language but reasonably sure you’re not going to repeat it just yet.  Daddy’s just … confused.  He doesn’t know what to do.”
His stomach flips over and John realizes that perhaps he doesn’t give his daughter anywhere near enough credit for her development.  “You want me to … kiss Sherlock?”
Sherlock hums around a forkful before shaking his head.  “No,” he says thoughtfully, “and that’s the curious part: I haven’t found
“Of course,” Sherlock says and clears his throat yet again.  “I’ll just … I’m nearly finished packing.  I’ll give her a snack once I’m done.”
Sherlock stays silent as a stone as Mary presses fingers to her lips and blows him a kiss.  The video cuts to black and ejects itself from the CD tray.  Sherlock doesn’t move.  The flat is dim by the time he does, when he hears the creak of the downstairs door opening and closing and John’s heavy tread on the stairs.  He hasn’t even bothered to stash the disc somewhere John won’t see it yet – can’t seem to move; why can’t he move? – but he tossed the packaging in the grate as soon as he removed it, so at least that evidence has been consumed by the licking flames that really aren’t necessary at this time of year.
His lips turn up and he tries to think of something sarcastic to say.  His brain abandons him, so he just gives a forced smile and nods.  “Fine, John.  I’ll be fine.  Don’t forget Rosie’s slicker; it’s going to rain before nightfall.”
“You mean … Sherlock?  Were you trying to say ‘Sherlock’?”
The grin that Sherlock aims at John is full of mischief so John puts his nose in the air.  “Until you and your brother’s unlimited gold card decide to fund a new wardrobe for me, I guess you’ll just have to put up with the assault on your fashion sensibilities.  And I happen to like that jumper, you prat.”
decided to push something with Sherlock, he definitely wouldn’t have chosen “naked in the bath with toddler” as his chosen method of seduction.  Especially not for Sherlock.
“I—” Sherlock begins but then takes a few rhythmic breaths.  John’s hands tighten on his arms and Sherlock leans into them.  “Serbia.  Moriarty’s network, the last big piece of it, was in Serbia.”
Sherlock squirms in his chair.  “It’s not that I don’t want to be honest with you, John—”
John pulls away and hisses, “Shhhh!” and nods at Rosie.
Sherlock sprawls across the center of the duvet, limbs splayed in that gangly starfish formation he usually occupies when he’s sleeping, which isn’t terribly surprising, but for his knees bent up to put his feet on the bed.  He’s completely nude which, unfortunately (fortunately?) for John, isn’t all that terribly surprising either.  What John can’t seem to parse, however, is that one of Sherlock’s hands works steadily up and down the flushed length of his erect cock, curved up high towards his belly and wet at the tip.  The detective seems completely oblivious to John’s intrusion, his head thrown back into his pillow, putting that long pale neck on full display as his other hand – oh holy Christ, John’s only just noticed – pushes a flesh-colored toy of some kind or other between his legs and out of sight.  When Sherlock draws his hand and the toy in a long stroke backwards, John can tell that it’s shaped like a cock.
to break this moment before he does something he can’t take back.
“So … you’re gay?”
Scoffing, John replies, “Come on, Sherlock, I’ve seen you use your appearance, your sexuality, as a tool before.  Mostly on women involved with cases, but I’ve also seen you use it on Molly before.  You know you’re good-looking, you know you have sex appeal.  You choose not to engage it in a practical sense and that’s fine but that doesn’t mean that those qualities wouldn’t transfer over to men.  You could pull if you wanted to, you just don’t.”
“Sorry,” he says, his voice pinched.  “Sorry, I … habit.  You know, after spending so many nights sleeping next to Mary and all.”
“Stupid, stupid!” Sherlock goes on, his normal baritone pitching up with uneasiness.  “John knows I would never do anything to hurt his daughter; never!  Don’t you, John?”
Sherlock actually freezes in the act of sitting down.  His pulse erratic – surprise; fear – his hands clenching in the air – nervous tic; picked up from John?  Impossible – for once, he’s not sure he can trust his own brain.  John

The doctor clears his throat heavily and Sherlock’s eyes snap up to John’s face and then as far away from John’s face as possible.
He pinches the skin just above the bridge of his nose and attempts to massage out the tension.
A tightness spreads through John’s chest and he has to close his eyes for a minute.  “Well, I always think it.  I always have.  Likely always will.  Guess I just need to say it out loud more often.”
Don’t insult me by pretending I can’t see it.”

Sherlock turns his face away towards the window but John catches the reflection of a small grin in the window glass.
o	JohnLock as the main pairing.  That doesn't mean there won't be others, however.  ^_^
“Don’t be too hard on yourself.  Accidents do happen, you know.  Even to doctors.”
“Of course you can, John; I would never suggest otherwise.  I merely saw that you still seem … unsettled from your dream.  Rosie can likely feel your anxiety.  Perhaps if you just let me take her—”
Sherlock seems to be counting the beams in the ceiling.  He nods.
“Kathryn Simon, pleasure,” she says in a bright, nasal accent that he places as East Coast American.  He was stationed with a bloke from upstate New York who sounded just like her.   She bends to regard the little girl now glaring at her with heavy suspicion from under her blonde lashes.
“I apologize,” he says. “Late night and high emotion, I’m a bit shattered.”
“God, you’re such an arrogant arse.  I don’t even know why I put up with you,” John says it with heavy sarcasm, but the twinkle in Sherlock’s eye says he enjoys the banter as much as John is.  That and the way Sherlock’s grip tightens around John’s hand.
They can hear the clerk whistling as he strolls to the car – a detail that has Sherlock staring after him with narrowed eyes – so John doesn’t trouble himself to lower his voice.
Eventually, Sherlock admits, “A few days.”
The clicks turn into a run.  “Are you at home?  I can be at Baker Street in eight minutes.”
He can’t help it, he prompts, “Just …?”
“John – ah! – John…?”
“No interest in sex with other people,”  Sherlock corrects.  “An incredibly important distinction, John.”
“Not always,” Sherlock says, damning the break in his voice.
He can’t help the small smile that tugs at the corners of his lips.  Sherlock reclines and spreads his hands wide.  “Astonish me.”
“You needed something?” Sherlock says between panting breaths.  His hands tremble with the effort to remain still.
“Come on, love, we’d better go home.  Too chilly to stay out long.”
Sherlock’s shoulders hunch and he curls away from the bald truth.
“This was a bad idea,” John whispers.
“I’ll just … do you mind watching her while I…?” John flaps his now-free right arm towards the loo and then upwards in the vague direction of his bedroom.
“In hindsight, I’m sure that was part of it, all rolled in to my PTSD now.  But Sherlock, I—”  he swallows before continuing, “What happened to Mary wasn’t just awful because I lost my wife, the woman I loved, right in front of me and I had to just sit there and watch it happen and not be able to help her.  That’s bad enough.  But I sat there holding in her blood from a bullet in her chest … and it felt like being back in Magnussen’s office, pressing my hand over the spot where a bullet was lodged in your chest, watching the light go out of your eyes in the back of that ambulance and….”
He opens his palm to drop the baggie to the floor, clutches the phone instead, focuses on breathing.  “Hurry.”
“Approximately twelve hours.”
Lanky git.  “That’s not that much—”
“No, Sherlock.  Your taste is fine for you, but not for me.  I’m Action Man, remember?  Not a bloody Ken Doll.”
Sherlock tries to crane his neck sideways to look at John, who ducks his face behind the blade of Sherlock’s shoulder.  “Another few inches.  Why?”
Sherlock forces a smile.  “Few things are.”
“Stay,” John says again, leaning up in bed.  His eyes are lamp-like in the darkness but for once, Sherlock can’t read the expression.  “I mean … would you stay?”
“We’ve barely been living together six months,” Sherlock goes on, clutching at John’s hand, “but I wanted so much to show him I can be good with her, that he can trust me to look after her and—”
“Honestly, John, I’ll never understand you.”
“Thank you, John.”  His voice sounds so terribly small.
Tiny specks of fear and anxiety flicker on John’s face again before he caps them.  Curious.
“I’m aware,” John answers, smirking.
“And you’ll protect her?”
Sherlock’s lips quirk up at the edges as he spears another morsel of admittedly very good lamb and holds John’s eyes as he pops it into his mouth.  John scowls at him for a second and then the expression melts away, his eyes crinkling at the edges as he fights a grin and shakes his head.
John nods.  “So you only ever feel attracted to people you already care for?”
“You’re right, of course,” Sherlock says quietly.  “Accidents happen.  We’re all only just human, right?”
Sherlock’s curls bounce a bit as he gives a single tight nod.  John sees his hunched shoulders work as he pulls Rosie from the sink, wraps a towel around her bottom and cradles her against his chest.
“You looked ridiculous.”
Sherlock lets loose a great howl of annoyance.  This circular thought is getting him
“Did she say that—?” John begins, then gives a fake put-upon sigh. “Of course she didn’t, you’ll have guessed—”
Sherlock grins easily.  “Surprisingly well.”
“Hey,” he says quietly, slipping into the role of calm and doting boyfriend that Sherlock has clearly assigned him.  “I know that you didn’t mean to hurt her.  Accidents happen,” he finishes, his voice hitching.
“We’d better hope that we get a doctor who has kids or is tremendously understanding.”
with her,” he can’t help but spit the phrase, “and I
Rolling onto his right side, John now stares a hole in the door across the room.  “Goodnight, Sherlock,” he says.
These would all seem to be indicators of something
Delivering a particularly well-aimed elbow to Sherlock’s ribcage, John relishes Sherlock’s “oof!” a little more than he should, jigging Rosie up and down and making a few soothing noises when she startles and starts to cry a bit at the jostling.
“John, please,” Sherlock protests dramatically, “there are impressionable young minds present.  No need to warp your daughter’s impression of sex by introducing a Holmes into the matter.”
“Point taken,” John cuts him off.  “So where on that spectrum do you fall?”
“You do.  You must.”
He doesn’t realize he’s said it out loud until Sherlock’s face pinches and he asks, “Who?  Right about what?”

a bit, gingerly tilting Rosie’s neck this way and that, and then straightens to rummage in a drawer of the cabinet nearby.
outlook, John.  I’m surprised at you.”
“Please.”
*****
“Wait!” Sherlock protests and tries to check his tone.  “I … need a favor.”
It feels odd but they chuckle together for a moment, John and this past shadow of Mary.  Quick as a whip, she snaps to serious again.
“I have to … I need a minute,” John gabbles and can’t stop himself from dashing out of the room, up the stairs and behind his bedroom door where it all feels so much less earth-shattering.  He braces his back against the door, slides to the ground, and tries to just focus on breathing until he can stop feeling like he’s going to shatter into pieces.
“I can care for my own daughter, damn it!”
Sherlock pulls up John’s travel alarm clock and shows him the little blinking display – 1:03 am.  John actually laughs.
And then one day in early autumn, John stands at the kitchen peeling and sectioning an orange onto a small plastic plate decorated with unicorns when he realizes he’s already done one for his daughter, who happily munches away in her high chair as juice drips down her face.  He knows, though, without even stopping to consider, that he’s made this one for Sherlock.  The man barely eats on the best of days, despite his healthier attitude regarding sleep, and somewhere along the line, John realizes that he’s started making a snack for Sherlock whenever he makes one for Rosie to ensure that his friend gets enough calories.  The last time they lived together, John would berate Sherlock about food until they both got frustrated, then he would give up, tell Sherlock to go to the devil, and eventually coax him into eating something when the man got too hungry to function properly.  Now, when John gives Rosie a hard-boiled egg for protein, he automatically shells another and leaves the neatly quartered pieces on a plate near his laptop where Sherlock is sure to see it and eat without thinking; he hangs a banana from Sherlock’s music stand; he fills an extra small bowl with apple slices that he knows Sherlock will eat as Rosie teethes away at them, using the fruit pieces to explain the germination process to her; or he spreads marmalade on chunks of muffin (Sherlock hates the seeds in John’s preferred blackberry jam), splitting them evenly between his daughter’s plate and a bowl he leaves on the arm of Sherlock’s chair.  John’s fairly certain that this little trail of snacks that he leaves for Sherlock have become the detective’s main source of caloric intake, and John can’t accurately point a finger at when he started this behavior, only knowing that it started after the night they shared a bed.  John is wholly unsure of what to make of this phenomenon.
John nods and Sherlock turns to leave.  Just as he’s crossing the threshold into his room, he hears a great splash of water that follows John getting out of the tub.  A wavy outline of John’s nude body appears in front of the frosted glass door which Sherlock shuts with a hasty snap.
to be so antagonistic when you’re determined to be clever?  I realize that you can’t stand not to demonstrate how brilliant you are, but could you at least refrain from
to see him naked.  Doesn’t matter though because by the time John has pulled the t-shirt down over his head and turned back towards the bed, Sherlock is shuffling down underneath the covers.
But we’re not doing this face to face.”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock agrees, smirking.  “Turnabout is fair play, I suppose.”
“No time like the present,” he murmurs.  And really, Rosie did unwittingly give him the perfect opening for it.  The tea can wait.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums in agreement.  “People would definitely talk.”
John hums thoughtfully at the response.  Everything about the boy’s tone says that while he’s comfortable enough to talk to John, a doctor and total stranger, the chances that he’s going to be comfortable enough to speak to his partner seem slim.
From anyone else’s perspective, John supposes that the way they leap apart from each other when they quit their chairs probably looks fairly comical.  As a matter of fact, the nurse holding the clipboard at the entrance to the waiting room raises an eyebrow as they both stride towards her but, mercifully, she says nothing.  The petite brunette bustles around them taking Rosie’s temperature and weight, getting a look at the burn, and asking for a basic statement on what happened.  The nurse plonks Rosie down on the exam table, shooing them towards uncomfortable chairs in the corner as she examines Rosie’s neck.  John notes a distinct expression of disapproval on the nurse's face when he begins, “Rosie was playing on the floor between us; I’d just handed Sherlock his cup of tea and sat down with my own when—”
“How can you even ask that?  Of course I do.”
He doesn’t try to picture it (the boy is half his age after all) but the image slips into his head unbidden.  Almost immediately, the mental picture becomes John and Sherlock.  Suddenly he’s coming up behind Sherlock, pushing him down to all fours, thrusting into him with little warning and roughly fucking him until—
with Sherlock’s … humanity.  Although now that the evidence pushes against his bum, he can’t help but recall the last time he became acquainted with said humanity.  A flash of that image comes back to him; on the back of his eyelids, he sees the vision of Sherlock’s body bowing off his bed as he stroked at his weeping cock, head thrown back and moaning.  The vision absolutely does not help John’s situation, given that when John shifts anxiously, Sherlock’s arm tightens at John’s waist and he gives an involuntary little rock of his hips as he moves with John.  A strangled noise ekes out of John’s throat and he claps a hand over his mouth to stifle it.  Sherlock murmurs something unintelligible and nuzzles his nose into the hollow under John’s chin.
“It’s
and it’s perfect: angry, abrupt sawing at the strings that lets him pick away at the festering wound that is his mood.  Somewhere floating above his concentration on the piece, Sherlock hears the pacing above him stop.  He picks up the tempo and the volume, his fingers racing his bow across the neck of his violin; the metal bites into his callused fingers, his chin slips from the rest and the instrument sways but he thrusts it back against his throat and continues to heave with the motion of it as he forces the notes out.  He’s only a third of the way through the concerto, scowling out the window and his feet scraping against the carpet as he rolls and pitches with the force of the music, when he hears a telltale creak of floor boards behind him.  The music trends upward, quieter and quieter strokes into the highest pitches he can wring from the neck of the violin, when John speaks.
“Keeping you warm, obviously.”
He settles for, “It’s complicated.”
John chuffs a laugh but snatches the little pink raincoat from the hook outside the door without further comment and stuffs it into the pocket of the pushchair.  Once he shrugs on his own jacket, John casts his eyes back to Sherlock, still curled in his chair, and seems to want to say something.   In the end, he just gives Sherlock an unreadable look and a nod before assuring the detective that he’ll be home before dark.
He has a moment of complete and unadulterated panic that Sherlock has found him out on his recent epiphany – although said epiphany somehow hadn’t progressed to something like this – but then he regroups enough to realize that Sherlock is no doubt asking why in hell John interrupted what seems to be a rather spectacular wank session.
“Jesus Christ,” John mutters to the bar of soap in his hand.  “There’s no doubt about it: I’m in Hell.”
A low rumble of voice that could be his name hits John’s ears as he leans towards the door but Sherlock talks to himself when John’s not there all the time, so it doesn’t stop John from swinging the door open to ask his question again.  Once John takes a step into the room, the enquiry freezes on his lips and all his stunned brain can manage to put forth is that he’s not sure whether or not he wishes he hadn’t come in.  He barely even registers the feel of the doorknob in his hand as he clutches it for support, he just stares.  And stares.  And no matter how much he stares, he can’t seem to process what he’s seeing.
John can feel Sherlock’s body heat warming his back and the bed is narrow enough that there’s only an inch or so between them beneath the covers.  Sherlock stays ramrod straight behind him and his posture doesn’t ease on the bed until long after John slides into the welcoming dark of sleep.
“That’s not the point, Sherlock!  God, if I thought this was a pattern before—”
Surprisingly, the detective ignores the dig.  He reaches out to Rosie as John bounces her on his hip but then pulls back.  Rosie turns her gaze on Sherlock and makes a few happy gurgles.
“Never a truer word spoken,” John confirms.  He pauses, regarding Sherlock with a fretful gaze again before he asks, “Dinner?”
John whispers and tries to take deep, steadying breaths.
“Mary,” John breathes.  His hands shake and his vision starts to go wavy at the corners.  That video is the only thing in his head right now, playing behind his eyes, telling him that Sherlock is in love with him in his dead wife’s voice.  “Oh, God, she was right.
John just nods.  He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised at Sherlock’s consideration for him and for Rosie at this point … and he isn’t, exactly, but the fact that Sherlock is so free with
When John pads into Sherlock’s bedroom, his heart wrenches in his chest.  The detective stands over his daughter where she just drifts towards sleep, his slim digits creating gentle swirls along her back as it rises and falls with her deep breaths.  It’d taken John ages to talk Sherlock down off of the “but all the articles I’ve read say that she must sleep on her back, John!” ledge, but now Sherlock seems to get a strange amount of peace just sweeping his fingers along her back as she lies curled up on her belly.  Undoubtedly, Rosie is the first baby that Sherlock’s had any kind of prolonged contact with and John can’t help but be amused at how mesmerized the detective is by her most mundane accomplishments and realities.  John’s even caught his friend grinning lightly as he pats her upthrust bottom while she naps, causing John to resolutely banish the word
“Ugh, Americans.” Sherlock scoffs.  “So ridiculously predictable.”
“John—”
“John—”
She brightens again and pushes her curtain of hair behind one ear, casting a glance down at the paperwork as she flushes under John’s gaze.  Sherlock barely resists the urge to roll his eyes.
John shifts in his chair.  “Well, no, but—”
Sherlock glances around quickly.  “What about it?”
“I’m here, Sherlock,” he murmurs, gazing down at the riot of curls covering his chest.  “I’m with you.  I’m safe. Just try to get some sleep.”
“You could go without me,” John suggests.
Sherlock chuckles and follows John out.
John clears his throat and pulls his jacket over his lap when he realizes that he’s got another erection blossoming with embarrassing speed in response to his train of thought.  Jesus, when did that sort of thing even become something that appealed to him?  However confident he is that he has never been attracted to any other man enough to even be a blip on the radar, his blood sings in his veins just thinking about shagging Sherlock.  And now, now he’s even getting worked up thinking about being fucked.  He’s never before found the idea of being penetrated the remotest bit arousing – and he’d had more than one adventurous girlfriend who’d offered fingers or toys – but God, his heart races just thinking about it.  Some weak protest echoes in the back of his head that he’s not gay (really, he isn’t) but that seems to matter less and less with every passing second in the wake of what he’s starting to feel for the world’s only consulting detective. Christ, maybe Mary was right.  Maybe Sherlock really is the exception to … everything.
“I just didn’t like—she was so bloody
“Oh, sorry, love,” John murmurs, leaning over to whisper in your ear.  “Didn’t mean to upset you, just needed to teach your—”
“What are you—?”
Both of Sherlock’s hands still but don’t leave their appointed positions.  John wrenches his gaze up to the detective’s face, florid and tipped towards him with an inquisitive expression.
John takes a few steps closer.  Sherlock actually backs away a bit.
Sherlock shrugs.  “‘A lot’ is relative, John.  Once a week would be a lot for some men; not nearly enough for others.  At least once a day would be a lot for me but if the length of your morning showers are anything to go by when compared to showers taken at other times of day—”
*****
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m not—”
“No, not
“Please,” John says in a rush.
He feels Sherlock’s back heave as he swallows heavily.  “That wasn’t a statement on your character, John.  It was just … one more item in the heap of things that make me a freak.”
Sherlock’s propped up in a sitting position on the far side of the bed, long legs prominent under the duvet, his face angled down at his phone. As soon as John strides in and makes his way to the couch to rummage through his bag, the detective looks up from the screen, pinkens through the cheeks, and then glances away nervously, busying himself with plugging his mobile into the charger cord on the nightstand.  John takes this opportunity for the godsend that it is, drops his towel and heaves himself into his pajama bottoms as quickly as he can manage.  The noise on the other side of the room stops and John resolutely refuses to consider whether it’s because Sherlock saw him naked or specifically
to impress me.  I always think you’re brilliant.”
By the time Sherlock makes it up the stairs and pushes John’s bedroom door slightly open, John has pulled Rosie from the bassinet and settled back onto the bed with her, attempting (ineffectually, it has to be said) to soothe her.  John’s chest heaves with rapid breaths, he’s covered in a light sheen of sweat, and obviously barely keeping himself calm.  He rocks too fast for it to be comforting to Rosie; Sherlock can tell that it’s a motion more bordering on hysteria than pacification.
“Does it have a name?”
“You know what?” John says, his tone aiming for bracing but coming out stilted.  “I think we both need a bit of time to digest everything from tonight.  I’m going to go down and get Rosie from Mrs. Hudson and take her for a little ramble around Regent’s Park before it gets dark.  Will you … be all right?”
the detective finishes in a hush.
to admit this, I find myself in need of—why are you out of breath?”
He’s trembling in John’s grip so John glances around in a panic, desperate for a distraction.  His eyes land on the violin resting nearby on the desk.
John’s cheeks are pink from the cool December evening and when his gaze locks with Sherlock’s, the flush deepens.  He doesn’t look away, though.  John flinches comically when Sherlock’s sentence sinks in.
“Well, she doesn’t know that.  You spend just as much time with her as I do, so it’s only natural she’d think you’re her dad, too.  And anyway,” John can’t help that his happiness ebbs away a bit as he stares down into the girl’s sweet face, “it’s not like she’ll remember Mary.”
“Maybe Sherlock does feel the same.  What do you think?  Do you think Sherlock loves Daddy?” he directs at the little girl currently buzzing her lips and patting her hands together.
Sherlock’s heart feels as if it’s trying to escape his ribcage.  “I’ll just,” he gestures to the chair, “let me just….”
“Oh, grow up, Sherlock, for God’s sake,” his brother snaps and switches the phone to his other ear.  “You were calling because you need a favor, which is a far more amusing topic for me.  Let’s get back to that.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest but John literally blocks him as he shoulders in front of the detective and gives the hostess a winning smile.  Despite the dark circles around her eyes and clear weariness in her frame, the woman practically melts into a puddle when John grins at her.
Sherlock still can't seem to get his footing in the situation.  John, who has always complained about Sherlock's lack of boundaries, is calmly bathing his daughter while nude and wet right in front of Sherlock, seeming not to care that when he leans forward like that, Sherlock can see all the way down the lean line of his back to the rounded cheeks of his arse, and—he has to look away.  Sherlock has to look away to preserve his own sanity.  Whatever game John is playing has Sherlock baffled, but he'll be damned if he gives up before he figures out the end goal.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, come on, look at me.  Look at me!” John says, angling the detective’s shoulders towards him so John dominates his field of view.  “You’re all right.  You’re awake now.  You’re here with me.”
“That’s all I need,” John mutters as he wheels them towards home. “Two of him.”
And yet, with all of the years of denying the unusual strength of their connection, perhaps—no, surely Sherlock is just seeing what he
“Would you like to see a picture of my boyfriend?”
“I never should have gone to Dursley.”
Sherlock implores; his voice sounds strangled.  “Given everything I’ve told you this evening, don’t you see how much more difficult that question is than any base discussion of masturbation?  How that particular fact might be my most private confession, given where attraction comes from for me?”
A puff of warm breath leaves John and strikes Sherlock’s pale back; he watches the detective lean back towards the source of it.  John can’t seem to stop himself skimming his hands across the back of Sherlock’s arms to run his fingertips over all the scars, a whisper of contact over each angry mark.
“Lead pipe.  Towards the end, so the state of my healing was hardly their main concern.”
obviously, but—
John rolls to his back, turning his head all the way over to look at Sherlock.  “What, really?  Not even when you were kids?”
sexual behavior, so I’m just … curious.”
*****
“You’re welcome.  And Alex: take care of yourself.  And your boyfriend.”
“Fine,” John whispers into the darkness.  “Then I forgive you.”
For a second, John’s hackles rise but the look on Sherlock’s face is so superior and offended that John can’t help but dissolve into giggles as he flops back onto the sofa.  After a moment, Sherlock joins him, both in the laughter and the sofa.  Tilting his head to gaze at his friend, John notes that despite his defense of his physical health, there’s a light sheen of perspiration on Sherlock’s brow and his chest rises and falls with rapid breaths. It’s much warmer than normal for late June, so between the weather and hauling boxes, it’s enough to make John’s t-shirt stick to his back between the shoulders, but Sherlock barely looks like he’s broken a sweat unless you really look hard. The detective still gazes up at the ceiling with a smile on his lips as he speaks.
John huffs.  “Give yourself a bit of a break, Sherlock; it really wasn’t as obvious as all that.”
When the last patient of the day tells him what’s wrong, John barely resists the impulse to shout and climb out of his own skin.  A sandy-haired boy of no more than twenty or so blushes and refuses to sit when John greets him.  He drops his eyes to the floor and explains in a hushed voice that he’s too embarrassed to his normal GP on account of the nature of his ailment.  After a few moments of stammering, John finally pries it out of him with a bit of gentle prodding:  his boyfriend had been a bit rougher than he’s used to during sex the previous night and he’d been very sore and stinging this morning.  John swears under his breath.
John chuckles unsteadily and mutters, “Damn right.”
“No, John; not even Janine.”
“Jesus, you weren’t kidding when you said that Mary giving value to your life was currency you didn’t know how to spend, were you?  You didn’t
It’s not so different, really, as far as his normal daily routine is concerned.  In any case, the routine isn’t different;
Dragging the other chair over with his foot, Sherlock places Rosie on the table between them.   John gives her a quick once-over and is relieved to see that the lion’s share of the redness has gone down.  On further inspection, though, there’s still an angry patch near her collarbone that hasn’t calmed and causes the little girl to howl when he gingerly presses a fingertip to the nearby area.
“You all right?” John asks, moving further into the sitting room.  “Something wrong?”
“Electrical wire,” Sherlock confirms, his voice expressionless.  “See the marks at the end?  The cord was frayed.”
he whispers and John doesn’t think he has ever heard the deep baritone sound quite so shattered.

After a moment, his hand slides out of Sherlock’s grip as he turns back onto his left side, settling in for sleep.  Sherlock stares upwards into the weak orange glow from outside for as long as he can, his mind struggling to unpack everything that has happened in the last few minutes.  The weight of every minute that escapes him settles heavily on his chest as he clenches and unclenches his fist, trying to hold onto the rapidly dissipating warmth from John’s fingers.
John grinds his teeth.  “Might as well see what she’s said,” he prompts with an acidic smile, trying to keep his voice even.  “She seems insistent.  After all, High Wycombe isn’t that long a cab ride at this time of night.”
“Yes,
"That is quite the accomplishment.  Any ideas?" John asks.  He fishes a cup from the side of the sink, puts a hand over Rosie's eyes, and proceeds to scoop cups full of water to pour over her head, gently scrubbing the paint from her hair with his fingertips.
He bounds down the hall towards the loo and throws open the door.  “John, I thought it was going to be a three, four at most, but it’s definitely—”
“Serbia,” Sherlock says again, his voice uneven.  “All of my intel had suggested that the operation was small and crudely organized – a baron with more delusions of grandeur than brain cells – and that I would be able to dismantle it quickly and quietly.  I neglected to take into account that occasionally Mycroft’s information might be sometimes days or weeks old, depending on the source and the danger, given the fact that we could only be in contact so often.  I managed to dismantle the surface level of the organization but it was messier than I expected and I had to flee.  A safe house that I’d thought would be available and secure had been raided the previous week … they knew I’d be coming … I had no  choice but to flee into the woods and … obviously, I was caught.”
“What do you mean?”
“If it’s—” Sherlock starts, turns back to clutch at the counter, and tries again while staring ahead at the cupboards.  “If you don’t want to tell me what it is then say so, but don’t lie and tell me that nothing’s wrong.  Even if I didn’t have the powers of observation that I have, I know you too well not to see that there’s
Sherlock slowly stands from his half-crouch, leaving the shirt in a pile on the floor, and reaches out once more for the violin.  Once the neck of it is in his hands, Sherlock seems to be at a loss, he gazes around for a moment before retrieving the bow and then stands in the center of the room, his hands awkwardly drooping at his sides.
“Secondly,” John continues in a sharp tone after clearing his throat, “the man I’ve known all this time would never choose something like this at random.  You’re a scientist and a detective, you wouldn’t choose a potentially inadequate tool for a job.  Moreover,” John says thoughtfully, sitting back as if giving the matter due consideration, “a man who refers to any part of sex simply as a ‘biological imperative’ isn’t going to base things on chance or convenience.  You,” John sits up suddenly and points directly at Sherlock’s chest; he smiles, “you, Sherlock Holmes, would want to make sure that if you have to ‘meet the need’ that you did it as quickly and efficiently as possible, with the best possible results.  No, you wouldn’t choose … that,” John waves towards Sherlock’s bedroom vaguely, “unless it was exactly what you wanted.  You would choose that
John stares at him until Sherlock feels like he wants to crawl out of his skin.  It’s the same feeling that he used to get when he was gasping for another fix.
John makes a loud noise halfway between a scoff and a laugh.
Sherlock gives a thick smirk before he leans over Rosie and whispers, “You make a marvelous bumblebee.  They’re my favorite living thing, you know.”
right in front of John’s eyes
She gives a huff of laughter and they both cast their eyes down the hall after Sherlock’s retreating figure.  “Your friend, is he … a life partner?  Business partner?  Live-in babysitter?”
“Come along, Watson,” he says, using his stupidly expensive dressing gown to mop up the dribble from the side of her mouth before throwing it over his shoulder. “You and I will go visit Mrs. Hudson once we’ve cleaned you up so your father can idle about in his dressing gown.”
“It’s hard to explain,” Sherlock hedges.
Sherlock rescues John from having to word the rest.  “No.”
He swipes at the tear with the back of his hand and lifts Rosie from her chair, clutching the little girl to his chest and giving a watery chuckle when she taps his chin.
gunshot.  Obviously, I—” His jaw snaps shut so quickly John hears an audible click of teeth.

“John, you couldn’t have known—”
Sherlock wavers in place but stays silent; his breaths hitch but he doesn’t move away.
Sock,” Rosie says deliberately.
“You were right,” he blurts again.  “About everything.”
“Dada
Something in John’s chest tightens at the notion that Sherlock never questions the two of them growing old together.  After a long moment of silence where they just seem to both be content to smile at each other, Sherlock’s gaze slips again … over the curve of John’s bare left shoulder, down his chest, and gets stuck at his waist where his hand still clutches his towel, but he’d gotten so distracted that his grip loosens to the point of absurdity, and the worn terrycloth hangs low.
Sherlock whines and the tone yanks John from a flood of self-loathing.  “Living through Serbia was dreadful enough; listening to you flog yourself over it three years after the fact is
“You’re lying,” John says before Sherlock has even finished the denial.  “I can see it in your face.”
Sherlock asked.
“But I want you to know that I would never trade your safety for my own in a million years. Okay? We’ll be all right. We’ll catch this lunatic. Together.” John’s jaw was set. “And if he makes one more move on you, I’ll show him exactly what a crack shot I am, you hear me?”
This time, Sherlock let out a small moan and he surged forward. His hand was ripped from John’s grasp and it slid roughly into his hair. Sherlock pulled his head down sharply, crashing their lips together.
“Let me know if you need me to do anything.”
“How much did it cost?”
Sherlock mentally berated himself for letting his control slide so quickly. He had just come to the conclusion that he couldn’t risk losing John over something like relationship issues or misunderstandings and certainly not something so idiotic as these
“Trying,” Mary ground out, her breathing still too rapid.
Mary followed his gaze back to the bed. “Right. I guess I’ll see if I can find us some drinkable coffee. Make sure he doesn’t go anywhere, yeah?”
Sherlock was out of his bed and up the stairs in seconds before he even knew what he was doing. His hand raised to open the door, poised on John’s doorstep, he listened.
“What?” Sherlock’s brows pulled together in confusion. His hand still rested on John’s cheek, his thumb absently brushing over his temple.
“Did you…?” John stuttered.
“No, we don’t,” Sherlock said and began dropping feather-light kisses all over his face.
John still looked at the TV. “Yes. That all right? I wasn’t going to make Mary take the couch with her injured arm.”
“You bastard! How many times, Sherlock? You can’t do something like that to people who love you, I swear you’re going to be the death of me one day—“ He broke off, staring into the pale eyes that narrowed with amusement.
It was painful in a strangely appealing way, and exhilarating in its inevitability. Sherlock groaned into the pillows. He couldn’t stop musing on the situation, on John, on their lives together. He knew something had to come to a head very soon, and decisions would be made… and no matter what, they’d never be able to go back to the way things were. It was absolutely terrifying, not knowing whether this was a good idea, or if he even had any say in the matters of his heart at all.
Then, of course, there had been their little heart-to-heart. Greg thought that if Sherlock was any other man, he’d have taken him out to the nearest pub, bought him a pint, and offered to have a proper chat. Greg was a good listener. But with Sherlock, regular methods did certainly not apply.
John took a deep breath, his posture relaxing a little. Sherlock could practically feel the wheels turning in John’s head. He noted that Sherlock hadn’t dashed away and that there was, in fact, an arm placed rather possessively around him.
Sherlock braced himself for disapproval. But a smile grew on John’s face. He looked quite happy, even if he was a little surprised.  “Oh,” he said, his voice hoarse. “Hello.”
Sherlock groaned internally. Of course his brother would point right at the problem and then prod it until it bled. “What do you want?”
He contemplated calling the police, but he knew that wouldn’t assuage his worry. He finally put some clothes on and grabbed his gun. The fabric of his shirt strained over his healing wound and he felt a little unsteady on his legs. But he couldn’t just sit around any longer.
The first night they’d been home, John had patiently waited for Sherlock to invite him to his room, or waited for a chance to invite Sherlock up to his; however, Sherlock had been in full thinking mode, staring absent-mindedly out of the window. Finally, a tired (and quite horny) John hadn’t been able to take it anymore. He’d gone up, stripped to his boxers and a t-shirt, got ready for bed in the bathroom and then casually leaned in the kitchen doorway.
“I’m glad you helped him, okay? It kept him safe,” he said, his voice becoming quiet. “And that kept
John winced. “Yeah,” he groaned, and shifted his weight. Sherlock grabbed both his elbows and tried to take some of the weight off his legs.
Another voice rang out, metallic and loud through the deafening noise. “Lower the gun, Mrs Norbury, and step away from the car.”
? How?”
“I didn’t… wait a second.” John sat up, reached for the jeans he’d discarded next to the bed and searched the pockets for his phone. He tried to turn it on, but the screen stayed black. “Bloody thing,” he cursed and fumbled with the charger he always kept on the bedside table.
“If I were you, I’d be angry as well. You worry about him, that’s all. Did he at least apologise to you?”
because that’s all I wanted to be again. It was a bit overwhelming to actually hear you say it after the punishment.”
Sherlock smirked at the other man. “Feel free to use my riding crop.”
It took a while till the question registered in Sherlock’s mind. He turned his head towards the man next to him and managed to lock eyes with John. “No, sir.”
.' That was why he had suddenly felt the overwhelming urge to fight John off, despite of all the trust John had earned. '
works fine for me. This doesn’t have to be reserved for roleplay, though.” John briefly wondered whether he’d still fit into his old army fatigues. “What about you?”
“They had a stupid fight and Lestrade called me, asking for advice and insisting that I knew Mycroft better than anyone else.”
The question that had suddenly formed in Sherlock’s mind just wouldn’t go away. He looked up at John through lowered lashes, hoping that his insecurity wouldn’t seep into his voice as he asked: “We can still have sex and
John set all items down on the coffee table and moved to stand in front of the kneeling man. He’d have to speak with Sherlock first, make him comprehend
Greg laughed it off. “There’s nothing you can do about it. Trust me, mate, I know him longer than you do.”
After a brief silence, John went on: “Also, I enjoy taking care of you. Not only but especially when it comes to making sure that you get enough food and sleep.”
“Shut up and listen, boy. You think I’m an idiot, but I might understand this better than you do. Your mind isn’t crumbling, Sherlock. It’s still running at a thousand miles per hour, but with no case, nothing to focus on, all that brilliance of yours is a bit overwhelming. So you can either wait for another case to appear out of nowhere, or you can let me take care of you and try not to think at all for a while.”
'I’m nothing like the fragile little pets you’ve had before me…' He thought about Sherlock’s words again and again.
John groaned and trembled through his orgasm and Sherlock slowly pulled away, licking John clean as best as he could. He kept massaging John’s perineum till there was no more come leaking from his twitching cock and swirled his tongue around the glans one last time. John gave a weak moan when Sherlock withdrew his mouth completely and licked his swollen lips to wipe even the tiniest remnants of John’s powerful orgasm away.
“You don’t have to be too explicit if you prefer not to, but we need to establish some rules and limits to start with.”
Sherlock felt his pensive, sceptical façade crumble in turn. “What else?”
John hooked one finger under Sherlock’s chin and tilted his head up. A pair of grey-blue eyes immediately met his. “Now listen closely, Sherlock. You are not allowed to come without my explicit permission. You can moan and whimper all you like, but the only words I want to hear from that gorgeous mouth are when you’re close to orgasm.”
I know that they talk *a lot* about this kink, but SSC is very important to me.
Sherlock tried to reach out to him a couple of times while they headed straight for the line of waiting cabs, but John ignored him completely. He didn’t trust himself not to yell at Sherlock.
John’s mouth gaped open in silent incredulity. “Are we talking about the same person here? Mycroft
For a while, each of them simply enjoyed their blissful state of mind in complete silence.
Sherlock crawled back over John’s upper body and lay down on top of him. John buried both hands in his hair and pulled him down into another passionate kiss. “
“Sherlock, did you use my laptop again?” John sounded irritated, angry even, and Sherlock knew exactly why – not that he could be bothered to answer him though.
John looked at him expectantly.
Thomas pretended to trip over his own feet but instead of falling to the ground he moved forward, effectively yanking his arms free from the police officers’ grip. Before Sherlock had time to go through the possible scenarios, Thomas had already got hold of the gun. He pointed it at the Spanish police officers, took a few steps back and moved around them in a half circle so that he was also aiming at John and the Yarders.
Greg finished his cigarette but waited a moment while the others went back inside. “Trouble in paradise?” he asked as soon as Donovan was out of earshot.
“What exactly happened yesterday?”
A gentle snoring sound to his left caught John’s attention. Apparently, he was not the only one their morning activities had taken their toll on. He turned his head to look at Sherlock and smiled when he let his gaze roam over the pile of tangled duvet, long limbs and sweaty, dishevelled curls.
deep in his mind palace that rushed to the surface in a dizzying pace. He’d have to do some research first, though.
Their last session was somewhat intense. John is going into Dom drop and Sherlock is being Sherlock, so things don’t go too smoothly.
Sherlock didn’t want to mess up the roles and dynamics they were slowly establishing, but he decided to take charge for as long as John let him. He swung his left leg over John’s hips as well to straddle his upper thighs, effectively lining his cock up with John’s. Sherlock was aching for some friction, but at least he didn’t touch himself that way. He rolled his hips slowly, moaning when he found just the right rhythm. “Fuck, John, you feel so good against me,” he gasped and John only moaned in lieu of an answer.
John eyed every member of the small security team that joined them warily, wondering if Moran had another mole stashed away somewhere. He had dug out his gun again and he knew that if any of them tried something, he would shoot first and ask questions later. He didn’t know why Mycroft was still with them or why he thought that their little car disappearing act would fool anyone. But Mycroft merely ignored his sarcastic comments and showed them their rooms.
“Do I want to know how?” Greg asked, looking somewhat bemused.
“Yes, I know,” John said, knowing it would be foolish to hide his own fears at this point.
back in England.”
“Good. Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?”
Sherlock looked back at his friend and thought for a moment. “Nothing,” he said very quietly.
“Okay…?” John offered, waiting to be enlightened, as usual.
Richard grabbed her book from the scrabble table and nodded. “Don’t stay up too—
And then his befuddled brain continued: something soft, ah, yes, hair, pressed against his neck. The weight of an arm on top of him, a warm hand resting on his chest. Legs pressed up next to his. Long legs. Thin fingers. Curly hair. And a familiar, pleasant smell.
John laughed. He tilted his head to one side and then shrugged. “No, me either,” he said, and Mary grinned. They shared a moment of looking at each other and all John could think was,
“Yes.”
She shrugged. “
“You don’t owe me anything, Sherlock,” he said quietly, still holding his hand.
“Why?”
“Impromptu press conference?” Sherlock quipped and his lip quirked in a smile, looking exasperated. “I don’t know, John!” He raised his hands in surrender. “I didn’t plan this, ask Mycroft!”
an advantage, Sherlock. Neither is your pig-headedness. That doesn't mean they're just going to go away if you ignore them long enough. If it were that easy you would be a much more pleasant man to be around."
He rubbed a hand over his once again clean-shaven face, looking at the person in the mirror. He looked a little thinner, perhaps still quite tired. There were a few more lines around his eyes and a slightly haunted quality to them that he hardly recognized.
The body behind him shifted again and Sherlock was once again looking over his shoulder, reading the file as if nothing was the matter. John stood still and read the same sentence three times. Sherlock’s hand came up next to him to turn over some papers and he was suddenly focussing very hard on the pale fingers, the delicate wrist protruding from the immaculate white shirt cuffs, the cufflinks shining in the torchlight. The moment felt incredibly surreal and John mentally went through the drinks he’d consumed that night but came up short; he wasn’t
She tried to continue, and John knew what she’d say the minute she opened her mouth. “I mean, when Clara left…” she began, but he interrupted by getting up. John squared his jaw, raised his chin, and straightened himself as he had done countless times before.
you haven’t removed any of my things,” Sherlock pouted.
The house seemed to have been separated into different flats at some point, before it was repurposed by MI5. He had to admit, the work that went into maintaining a safe house was actually impressive. He had seen one of the women on Mycroft’s security team in jogging clothes in the afternoon; next, she’d taken the rubbish out and talked loudly with a neighbour. Apparently she lived here. He supposed that people would question the sudden arrival of cars and lights being on if there was usually nobody there, so it made sense. John wondered idly if someone could simply live somewhere and have that be their job.
Sherlock’s head snapped up. “Why?”
“You’re freezing. Let’s go home,” Sherlock said, his lips pulling up in a smile.
had thought about it. He had realised there might have been more than just companionship between them and had to live with the regret. Sherlock couldn’t fault him his frustration – who ever got a second chance like this? He ran his hands through his hair and sighed, stopped in the middle of buttoning his shirt. Even though he understood, Sherlock couldn’t keep up.
When the light had slowly dipped across the meadow and the morning dew was shining in the winter sun, Sherlock felt a hand on his back. Mummy had come downstairs, as silent on her feet as Sherlock. She leaned into him, rubbing his back, her small form a comforting weight against his arm. Sherlock swallowed and put an arm around her, and they stood there for a long while, looking out at the garden. He was glad that she understood him so well, out of all of them. She didn’t need to say anything. He knew exactly what she was telling him.
Sherlock stopped, blinking, the reality of the morning hitting home.
John scowled at him as Sherlock returned with a new round.
Regret seemed to be the key. Sherlock knew he didn’t regret what happened between them (John seemed to think so), but somehow that knowledge didn’t make things easier. He realised he couldn’t very well say he regretted nothing and then expect John to stop… whatever they were doing. Maybe they should just get drunk again, that seemed to have helped with the dilemma a bit. It had certainly shut up his brain for a while.
He recalled his thoughts about relationships. In only one day, John had turned them completely upside down. He thought of some of the
into sentiment made him predictably ordinary.
“No. You can’t.” John demonstratively, if a little clumsily, grabbed Sherlock’s hand and held on to it firmly. He saw a flicker of a smile on Sherlock’s lips.
They looked into their cups a little more, and finally, she spoke up again. “So are you…? I mean… with him?” She seemed to blush a little. Normally, John would have quickly denied anything and everything, but now it made him think.
Realisation washed over him.
“Uh, sure, I’ll just…” John made a small movement forwards to get to the stairs. Sherlock took just a moment too long before getting out of the way, looking extremely out of sorts. John managed to get past him and turned around. Sherlock began heading down the stairs quickly. “You going?”
Suddenly, John’s tongue darted forward and ran over his lower lip – and Sherlock’s conscious will finally dissolved into nothingness. He could not stop his own lips from parting slightly in response and John took that as an invitation to suck lightly on his lower lip. With a full-body shudder, Sherlock let his other hand encircle John’s shoulders to draw him flush against his chest. Neither of them really registered the crutch clattering to the floor.
Sherlock noted that a few other people had spotted them as well and they had pretty much reached the space reserved for the dancing, between the dinner tables and the small stage where a string quartet was playing a waltz. John still held his hand. He looked up and then at something over Sherlock’s shoulder. “And not just him,” he murmured.
In the hall, the speeches were over and space was made for a string quartet. The dancing would begin shortly.
Sherlock looked appalled. “No. Of course not.” He lowered his eyes. “I would like to come home,” he said quietly. “If that’s all right.”
and John had a dawning suspicion that he’d just utterly broken that unspoken ban.
Half of the force had left by now, including a somewhat embarrassed and annoyed looking Sally; Lestrade was still sitting with them. He hadn’t forgotten the bet about the couples he’d made earlier and now that the Anderson debacle was over, he brought it up again. However, John was in on it this time, and he imposed an additional rule.
