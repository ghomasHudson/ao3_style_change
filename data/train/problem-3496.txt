"Oh. Alright.” Dean’s trying hard not to let his disappointment show. “I was told I might find him here."
“I can no longer imagine interacting with the world any other way. Losing it would be like losing a limb,” Anna says, paling at the very thought. “But I understand your fear. Change is never easy, especially when you have to be the one to take the first step.”
When Dean told Sam that he was gonna be a firefighter, Sam looked at him in that odd way, like Dean just told the joke, but the joke wasn’t funny. Like the joke qualified Dean for a temperature check, because maybe he was feverish. How could Dean possibly want to be a firefighter, if he still woke up at night drenched in sweat, the night their mom died still plaguing his dreams, decades later.
He just popped up at his door with a checkered blanket and a picnic basket, and Cas is staring at him like he grew a second head.
Cas didn’t break eye contact. Dean’s not even sure he breathed, but then again, he never knew if Cas had to breathe at all. Either way, there were a few seconds of thick, tense silence, both of them clearly wanting to give each other a piece of mind but didn’t know how to start. Dean eventually did. “I’m sorry.”
Frickin Jack and Amara, Dean thought. He remembered that going back to sleep was all the Empty ever wanted, and Jack and Amara had the power to do so, apparently. Dean frowned, quickly replayed it in his head and figured that the deal didn’t even seem half bad, unless-
Cas looks at her calmly while any expression slowly leaves his face. She walks up to him but Cas stands his ground and doesn’t move back one step until she’s standing right in front of him.
“Don’t make that face,” Cas warns and lowers his arms. Dean mentally counts to three until Cas fully lowers his guard again and makes his way back to where Dean is standing. He un-crosses Dean’s arms in front of him, justifiably keeping a strong grip on his wrists to prevent another attack. “What was that for?”
Cas has stood by Dean’s side for as long as they’ve known each other, despite all of their ups and downs, through fights and forgiveness, in life and death. He gave up heaven, fought his own brothers and sisters and took humanity’s side during the biblical apocalypse because it was Dean he believed in, not God. He killed Billie back when she was a reaper because he couldn’t bear the thought of losing his family, gave his own life Jack’s. He broke through heaven’s brainwashing because he couldn’t hurt Dean.
Cas doesn’t show any physical reaction, but his silence often indicates he’s thinking hard about something. Dean lets him think and continues to ramble. “In retrospect, sometimes I think I should’ve told you. I didn’t—I
After a moment of reminiscing, it reminds him of something else, something that’s been on his mind for a short while. He turns towards Cas when he asks, as casually as one can with a question like this, “Hey, were you ever married before?”
Dean—well, he got hard. Like, immediately. He could feel his brain go offline as all the blood rushed to where he really didn’t need it to go right now. In his defense, this kind of dominance was an insanely good look on Cas. Always has been, to be fair, and this surely wasn’t the first boner he was trying to hide from him, but it was probably one of the less appropriate ones. He had his brows furrowed and his lips parted, and he was staring Dean down with such intensity—
If Dean had to make a guess at what his true happiness would look like, it would, without a doubt, be this.
They both laugh at the memory. Dean doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to forget that day, the feeling in his chest when discovering that Cas was alive. He didn’t know what it meant back then, but in retrospect it was pretty obvious.
Nothing felt real about this moment. It took Dean a solid ten seconds of staring until he finally found his voice. “Cas.“
He cups Cas’ face with one hand and strokes his cheek before pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Nevermind.”
Actually, maybe he was, and he was just being an asshole about it. Dean wasn’t sure if he’d imagined the smirk he saw on Cas’ face right before he grabbed the wheel with his left hand so his right one was free to find its way to Dean’s thigh.
“Stop,” Cas argued, “stop apologizing.” He moved towards Dean again and Dean instinctively stepped back, his body hitting the wall again. Cas stopped only a few inches short of Dean’s face. “Just tell me why. Why did you just—give up?”
But Sam’s not here and Dean is still getting used to the feeling of not keeping a gun underneath his pillow, not even a knife. Not that he’d need any kind of protection up here, not that anyone or anything would even dare to come close, but even if he did, he’s got Cas right next to him to fight off any danger without breaking a sweat.
It’s a ridiculous question, no one up here is ever really tired, but whatever. Dean shakes his head and stifles a yawn.
Right now, the feeling in Castiel‘s guts is loud and clear, it’s like Dean is calling out for him, begging him to stay, trying to pull him back into the room, like Dean might as well be saying
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Charlie says, clicks some more, and giggles when a new window pops up. “Alright, Ash got his first real kiss at some new years eve party when he was fifteen—”
Cas swallowed the lump in his throat. It wasn't what he'd expected Dean to say but frankly, he hadn't expected him to say anything. He didn't know how to react, just watched Dean fumble with the leather string in his hands. He clumsily pinched both ends in between his fingers and tied them into a knot in the back of his neck, the glowing vial hanging on his chest like the pendant of a necklace. Cas had considered that the string could be used that way but he wasn't sure Dean would do it. It was impractical for several reasons and he wasn't sure if Dean would even want to display it that publicly. Just when he was about to say something, a quiet mumble of his name caught his attention.
“You shouldn’t be here yet, Dean.” Cas looked around the room and Dean’s cock twitched at the sound of his name. Cas’ face softened when his eyes met Dean’s again. “You—You’re not supposed to be here.”
Dean sighs. “This is fucked up,” he says because it’s the only thing he can think to say. He didn’t even know this shit was possible but here he is, once again underestimating his friends’ tech abilities. One thing suddenly crosses his mind. “I don’t know what Jack’s gonna think of this.”
Dean knew before that it’d sound ridiculous, but now that Cas puts it like that, it sounds much dumber than he anticipated. He quickly racks his brain for an explanation and surprisingly finds something useful. “I almost got married in Vegas once.”
Squinting her eyes, Meg stares at him. “You really don’t know, do you?” Cas squints back, confused, opens his mouth but Meg continues to speak before he can get out a single word. “Your grace, dumbass. It just went
Dean always thought it was wrong, pointless, a lost cause. He tried to drown it out so many times, because he was convinced Cas wouldn’t reciprocate even if he could, he literally wasn’t programmed to, but even if he was, Dean was never supposed to fall in love with him in the first place, not with an angel and much less with Cas because Cas is his best friend and —
Dean rolls his eyes at the correction, then frowns when he thinks about it again. “Everyone’s memories? Like, mine too?”
Dean rolls his eyes, both of them fully aware that next time a situation like this rolls around, Dean will one hundred percent be doing the same thing again. He’ll absolutely worry to the point he feels sick about it before bringing it up to Cas because that’s just the person he is. He’s not gonna freak out anyone else if it’s not a big deal, right?
Dean sharply blows air out of his nose, resembling a snort, or maybe a laugh. Then he shakes his head. “That’s not enough.”
In the quiet of the room Castiel can’t help but listen to the beat of Dean‘s heart. He realizes that it hasn’t slowed down the way Castiel expected it would, still beating much faster and stronger than a calm heart usually does. Castiel tries not to think about it too much since he knows that, apparently, Dean‘s heart always races a little more than the next person‘s. Obviously, Castiel can only speak for the times he's actually around to listen, but he assumes it must be like this all the time. It wouldn’t make sense for Dean‘s heart rate to have anything to do with Castiel‘s presence.
Charlie is silent for a second, then furiously types way at her keyboard before turning back to Dean. “Yup, him too.”
A few seconds later Dean realizes that shit, he’s right. He feels fine though, now that they’ve talked about it he feels infinitely better than he did when he woke up earlier. “I’m fine, I think I’m just… processing.”
explain to him how she did it in detail, but Dean zoned out halfway through and the pieces that stuck don’t make a whole lot of sense if strung together.
“I‘m not in the mood for your smart words, Sammy,“ he said, loud enough for his brother to hear in the war room. “Either you drink with me or you leave me alone.“
The second time he died landed him right where he is now, even though Heaven used to look much different back then. The walls have come down, what once was just reruns of one’s happiest memories is now a place to make new ones. In a way, it’s just an extension of life on earth, or at least the good parts of it. Dean still drives around in the Impala every day, but instead of going off to fight monsters he goes to visit his friends, his family, everyone he failed to save.
He listens to Cas’ steady breathing for a while, and enjoys the hand stroking up and down his back, not to forget the occasional kiss pressed onto his head. He hears a quiet call of his own name when he thinks Cas might’ve just fallen asleep, and hums in response to signal he’s awake. “Do you feel okay now? Was that the only thing on your mind?”
Instead, he takes a deep breath and reminds himself that he’ll never get a better chance to speak his mind than now. “Cas, I–Me too.” It’s all he can get out before feeling the throbbing beating of his heart in his whole chest, his lungs closing up, but he has to push through, just this once, right now, because what is he even scared of, exactly? “I love you, too.”
Cas’ ears perk up. It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to him, they had the when-did-we-fall-in-love-with-each-other conversation several weeks ago. Cas knows that Dean has trouble pinpointing the exact time he started developing feelings because he spent most of it actively suppressing the shit out of those feelings.
A small questioning noise fell from Balthazar's lips, "Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm just finishing up adding these grades in before I head out. What's up?"
It was absolutely captivating. Never before had Castiel heard a song that built up in such a way. This was intense. The anticipation made his stomach flutter. Tonight was not going how he expected it would at all. This was more than he could have imagined. The music was wrapping around his mind, and either it was the beer he downed or the shared moment with the man, but he was eager to keep listening.
But fake Dean didn't stop. Instead, he started to take Castiel deeper into the heat of his mouth. Dean's other hand moved down and started to stroke himself. Castiel, seeing that Dean was getting off on just this, felt his knees go weak and, with a few more quick strokes, felt his release leave his body, and boneless, he sagged against the wall of the shower letting the stream of cooling water clean off his body.
Turning on his shower, he waited a moment for the water to heat up, then slid under the stream, sighing in pleasure as the water beat down on his shoulders. The heat of the water and the strong pressure were enough for his eyes to close momentarily. This was one of his favorite features of this apartment. Showers became a luxury when you had water pressure like this.
What was happening? Castiel didn't do this. He didn't go to bars or go to concerts. He definitely didn't smile at attractive and talented singers. He taught his students, he read too much, he stayed home on weeknights. He looked away, down into the empty glass in his hands.
Maybe he could go back to the Roadhouse. Castiel froze. Why would he go and do that? It's not as if he would find Dean there again. It was clear from his conversation with Sam this morning and the comments made last night that the band's performance was not something that usually happened.
But every time there was a moment break, he would think about green eyes meeting his, the warmth pooling in his stomach when he remembered the winks sent his way. He couldn't contain the sigh that fell from his lips.  Why was he the way he was? No one else would let this kind of thing affect them as much as it did him.
"Ladies and not-so-gentlemen," a small wave of laughter went through the crowd. "Tonight, y'all are in for quite the treat. We finally got him to say yes to performing for us. As you know a Herculean feat if I do say so myself. You know how he gets." Another small laugh from the crowd. Castiel realized that most of the people here were regulars or at least knew each other enough that the crowd understood the man's remark on the band's member. They seemed to know exactly who he was talking about. The clapping of the people in the room drew him from his thoughts, and he figured he must have missed the name of the band being revealed.
He headed back into his bathroom, shucking his clothing as he went to start his shower. Removing his sweater, jeans, and briefs, he threw them into his room as he passed by his hamper.
"Have a great day!" Sam replied, and Castiel all but books it out of the café. He hopped into the car and quickly pulled out of his spot to head to school. He sees a sleek, black car smoothly take the place he just vacated but doesn't give it much thought other than a quick appreciation of the aesthetic of the other vehicle.
"Yes, you were right Jo. They did blow me away. I can't believe that their music sounds like this." He turned back to Jo, who nodded.
Castiel couldn't remember the last time he came that fast. But now, in the post-orgasmic haze, he felt his face flush. He just jerked off to someone he hasn't even spoken to, and it was the hottest thing he could've imagined.
Castiel knew that as much as he could wish that he could ignore the small moments, that's not who he was. He felt a connection when a cashier told him to stay warm when he left a shop, or a coworker laughed at one of his comments in a department meeting. Someone like Dean sending him flirty looks was the equivalent of a shot of ecstasy straight into his bloodstream.
Except that there was, and the heat that settled low in his stomach proved otherwise. He stood up and made his way to the bathroom. Relieving himself and then washing his hands, he mentally berated himself. Enough! Right now, he just had to think about literally anything else. He brushed his teeth, then walked back into his room. Sliding the mirrored door to his closet open, he selected his clothing for today. He quickly picked a nice blue sweater to keep him warm and dark black jeans. It was Friday, all he had to do was throw a couple of dollars into the basket at work, and he could get away with a jeans day. He didn't feel like putting on anything else.
Sammy and the drummer stopped their background ohs but repeated the last song of his verse. "keep from drowning" was repeated by the two men, as well as who Castiel safely assumed was the lead vocalist. Sammy stepped even closer to the front, electric guitar bright against the drums and melody being played.
Castiel can't stop thinking about the green-eyed singer from the Roadhouse. So maybe he should go back?
Dean was a full rockstar, singing up there in front of everyone, capturing the audience with his sinful, raspy voice. Castiel couldn't have been more opposite the man up on the stage.
Castiel woke up the next morning slowly, faint light streaming in through the gaps of his blackout curtains as he takes a deep breath. Pressing his face into his pillow and he feels the stretch grow and take over the length of his body. The pull of his muscles a pleasant feeling as he wakes up. It doesn't take long for flashes of the previous night to bring him to full consciousness. He glances at his alarm clock beside him; 5:32 glares back at him in bright red.
"Good enough for me. Let's meet up there at like what 6ish?" Balthazar looks down at his outfit, "I'd like to change out of my work clothes if possible."
He wondered what kind of music they played. He didn't have a particular preference for any genre. Usually playing whatever his mood was at the time, so he knew he wouldn't outright dislike the band. The Roadhouse didn't seem like the kind of place that would have insanely niche music playing either. Stereotypically he imagined country music or at least some sort of southern rock. The people around the bar seemed to be dressed somewhat normally, and there were chairs on the stage, so they might just be some kind of acoustic cover band.
Shooting one last look at the bar, no one else had left when he did. He took a deep breath, savoring the muffled voice of Dean inside, then slid into the driver's seat and began the short journey home.
"Make it through and fall into the light." Castiel felt himself lean toward the stage, eager to hear more. "Allllllllllllll the waaaaaaaaaaaaay, a carnival of causes and delight."
Castiel knew there was no point in ignoring his curiosity. He moved around to his desk to start packing up his stuff. He powered off his laptop, grabbed the stack of turned in rubrics from the bin, and shoved it all into his bag.
His mind's Dean sent a quick look up at Castiel and winked at him before taking Castiel into his mouth. Those godforsaken lips wrapping around him, taking as much of his length as he could. Wrapping one of his hands around what he couldn't fit. Dean started moving in time with Castiel's strokes, and stars burst behind his eyelids. It shouldn't be this hot in here. He shouldn't be this close. But Castiel knew that he was, his toes curled, and his fantasy continued. "I- I can't. Dean stop. I'm about-"
"Bye, Mr. Novak! Have a good weekend! When are you grading the narratives?!" Becky, one of his Honors 10 students, asked as she packed up her belongings.
It looked like Dean was trying to find someone, but it didn't stop him from singing. It took one final sweep of the back of the room, and as if they were magnets, Dean locked eyes with him once again.
Kicking his car into gear, Castiel made his way home. He had a few hours to kill, and he needed to get ready.
His voice was like a shot of live wire, shocking Castiel into a straighter position. Something deep inside hummed awake, stretching warm and solid inside him. That voice was unlike any he had ever had the pleasure of hearing. He almost couldn't believe that this music was coming from the live band in front of him. The emotion flooding from the stage had an intensity he could have never imagined.
Nodding, Castiel pushed opened to door for them to exit out into the parking lot, "Of course. I probably will too."
Castiel leaned against one of the student desks, "I'm leaving, was seeing if you wanted to leave together." He doesn't look at his friend but scratches the back of his neck.
"Yeah, I don't think I'll be able to forget him singing," Castiel coughed slightly at the end of that, feeling a little awkward in sharing something that felt so personal with a stranger. He thought he should at least introduce himself after having chatted with her more, "I'm Castiel, Castiel Novak. Thank you for being such a kind conversationalist."
What was that about? Castiel wondered, but Dean didn't stop singing, and Sam and Benny build the song up around Dean's voice. Taking a wonderfully fun turn to the raw emotion of the first song, if they had continued, Castiel was sure he'd brought to a puddle in the middle of the Roadhouse.
But it wasn't illegal to go to a bar. He was an adult; adults went out for drinks. It was a Friday.  He could even ask if Balthazar wanted to grab a drink with him. It's been a while since they spent time outside of work together. It could be fun to catch up with his friend and possibly catch a glimpse of the green-eyed man who'd been haunting him in the back of his mind all day. What was the harm in that?
Castiel sighed to himself, trying to deter his thoughts before it got too much. Not right now. He needed to get ready for work. This was a path he really shouldn't go down, especially if he wanted to be on time. He sat up, throwing his legs off the side of the bed. Resting his head in his hands, elbows on his knees, he knew he needed to forget the night before. Nothing even happened, a few winks and a quick smile. That happened at every faculty meeting if he were being honest. There was really nothing special about it.
"That's beautiful to hear. Well thanks for coming out, as Gabe so thoughtfully put out there. This is a first for us. Sammy here," the tall man shot him an irritated look but raised his head in acknowledgment, "has been conspiring to get me to agree to this. So, take it easy on us." He smiled, and it felt like he was keeping a secret from the crowd.
"Yeah, I heard about it at lunch, figured why not?" Castiel shrugged in an effort to be as nonchalant as possible.
"Yeah, I'll leave with you if you don't mind waiting a few more minutes. I won't be long." Balthazar continued to type in his grade book.
Castiel relaxed as he drifts into his role as teacher, which feels as second nature to him as breathing.
"Man, you're something else. You can relax I'm referring to the band." She laughed, throwing her hand up to point towards the stage, where another song had already started up. This one much more upbeat than their opener.
Castiel took a deep breath. He needed another drink. He slowly got up from his spot to the side of the stage and wove around the audience, making his way back to Jo at the bar. He briefly considered getting something more substantial than the beer he finished but then remembered he had to drive himself home. "I'll get another beer please."
Again, the ride to the Roadhouse wasn't long, and he was sitting outside the semi-crowded bar seeing the spots slowly fill up before he knew it. He stayed in the Lincoln until he saw Balthazar slide out of the backseat of an Uber.
"I'll take the same as Cassie here, and you already made them love you after only one visit." Balthazar turned to Castiel with one eyebrow raised.
"Of course, I'm in no rush." This wasn't a lie. Castiel was still freaking out about his desire to go back to the Roadhouse. "Actually, I was wondering if you'd want to grab a drink tonight?"
He tilted his head to the side; he didn't have much experience with new bands, and that sounded like a stretch. But he didn't remark. Instead, he ordered a local brew on tap. He paid for it with cash. He didn't need to open a tab as he only wanted it to pass the time, not to get inebriated.
"How could I not sweet talk you, with those blue eyes back there? And for those who don't know I'm Dean." He turns back to face the audience and catches Castiel's eyes again, and he winks. At him. Again. They continue to stare at each other, and Castiel can feel the heat building within him. A wave of arousal crashes through him, and his mouth opens with a gasp. He breaks their staring first, trying to rein in his thoughts before he embarrasses himself any further.
The guitar was setting up the mood, the electric feel of the notes dancing in the air. It had to have been about a minute of just instruments and the humming before Castiel saw the man who introduced his band step forward. He closed his eyes and took a deep and steadying breath.
It was Sam. The tall man from the band last night. Castiel reeled back a little. He wasn't expecting to recognize anyone this morning, let alone someone from the bar. He didn't recognize Sam last night, though, and he'd been to the coffee shop enough that he figured Sam would look familiar. He quickly looked at the other staff, not realizing entirely why until he saw that none of them were Dean. Cas let out a breath of relief.
He couldn't believe he was here; he was all set to spend the night in tonight. He even had his mug ready for his tea. The book he started that week was now sitting on his end table, ignored in favor of his spur of the moment decision to leave his empty house and venture to a local bar. It was a weeknight, but he felt it would be okay to spend some time here before heading back home. He had work in the morning, but he should be fine.
"Hello, welcome to Winchester's. What can I get you?" a deep voice asked before Castiel could look up. The voice was alarmingly familiar, and when Castiel brought his eyes up to the barista, he did a double-take.
The fresh air felt nice on his flushed face. It was a bit chillier than he liked, but it was refreshing after the way he was reacting inside. It was unlike anything he had experienced, and it made him feel like he was walking around in someone else's body.
The bar was slightly packed, looking busier inside than it did outside. Castiel held his breath as he looked around the room. He could hear the familiar sounds of classic rock playing in the background, and the room still had the smoky haze he remembered from the night before. His scan came up empty, no glimpse of the bearded man he wanted to see. He let out a breath in... relief? Disappointment? He didn't think about it too hard.
He was up before his alarm. It would be going off in about an hour, but he was fully awake now, and there was no point trying to go back to sleep. As he lay there, enjoying the peaceful silence of his room, his mind wandered. Flashes of vivid green eyes, bearded jawline, and bright smile haunted his sleep and were taking up all the space in his thoughts.
Taking a final glance around to make sure he had everything, he pushed his chair in and left his room, making sure to turn the lights off before he's out the door. On his way out, Castiel detours to the hallway next to his to see if Balthazar is still in his room. Luck was on his side when he saw the door open and lights still on.
If only those lips would trail slowly down his body and wrap around his- Castiel stopped that line of thinking quickly. No need to open that Pandora's box. It wasn't right. It's not like he knew the man. Just because he looked like some fantasy wrapped in tight denim, that gave Castiel no right to think things like that about the man. But Castiel was human. And Dean. Well, Dean was gorgeous. In a way that shouldn't be legal, really.
He gave her a small wave and decided to remain leaning against the bar to nurse his drink. His spot was taken, and he didn't want to fight his way back to his original seat. His beer was just as easy to drink as before, and it didn't take long for him to finish his glass.
"It's Sam." For the first time, the taller man speaks up, voice deep but not as raspy as the singer. "Thank you everyone!" His smile thrown to the audience is brilliant. Blinding in his happiness.
They shook hands. Jo kept talking but moved to fill Castiel's glass. "Nice to meet you Balthazar, any friend of Castiel's is a friend of mine."
Castiel could feel a small sense of anticipation building low in his stomach for the band about to play. He sat watching deft fingers strum to make sure the guitars were ready. He had to admit the shorter of the two had really nice hands, Wait, he mentally shook his head, where did that come from. He took a drink from his glass, reeling in his thoughts. The shorter man looked over to the taller and sent him a smirk. The taller just rolled his eyes.
He sat the glass down at the bar. Jo was busy, so he didn't say anything but turned around, heading for the exit. The cheers erupted at the end of the song, and Castiel slipped out the door heading to his parked Continental.
Castiel groaned, rolling over onto his side, pulling a pillow closer to cradle against his chest. This was ridiculous. He was acting like one of his students, and he had to get it together. Last night was supposed to have been a moment of escape from another quiet night. Something new but not extreme, and still slightly social. Yet all it took was one glance from those green eyes, from Dean, and all that was messed up. Instead of a night of relaxation, he was shocked into bright, burning awareness. The voice that spilled from Dean's frustratingly plush lips wrapped around his dreams throughout last night.
Those lips that last night looked so ready to kiss now pressed against his skin and Castiel felt heat settle deep in his stomach. The green-eyed vision continued to press sloppy kisses down his body, strong hands gripping his thighs. Castiel continued to stroke himself, moving faster as his mind continued to supply him with his personal fantasy.
The smile never left Sam's face, "That, that actually means a lot. Dean, he was the one who sang. He gave me so much shit over last night. He almost didn't even show."
She moved over to stand across from them, wiping her hands on the rag she had thrown over her shoulder. "Can't complain. What can I get you tonight? Same as yesterday?"
"Glad everyone could make it out. Why don't we just keep doing what you're actually here for? Here's another original, "Cannonball."
"Because we can't become, victim of a sum, cradle our desire, to keep from drowning, for all we know, and all we've shown, crazy our survival to keep from drowning." The lead singer belted out, seeming to let out the deepest parts of himself in the lyrics. His voice continues to shoot warmth through Castiel's body. He stepped back, his eyes closed and his fingers still strumming his guitar. Sammy was moving slowly around in his section of the stage. Continuing to build up the other man's voice. The ohs continued in the back, and the drum was a welcome rhythm in the back of the song.
Castiel tried not to let it affect him. He smiled weakly, "Well, you tell him he has at least one new fan." He lifted his drink in a gesture of thanks and swiped his scone from the counter. "I gotta get to work."
“But… Why? I-I can’t take this,“ Dean said softly. He finally took the vial in his hand, slowly and carefully, laying it flat on his palm. Cas was already racking his brain for something to say when Dean’s hand was suddenly right in front of him. “It’s yours, I can’t take it.“
Castiel knows he shouldn’t bother him, should just leave him alone and give him time to cool off, but he’ll take the fact that Dean left his door open just a tiny bit as an invitation. He pushes against it and slowly sets one foot over the threshold, peaking his head through the crack. The lamp on the bedside table illuminates the room just enough for Castiel to make out Dean sitting in the middle of the bed, blanket over his legs and his head in his hands. His chest is heaving, his fingers pressing into the top of his head, his eyes squeezed shut. Castiel hates seeing Dean this miserable and hurt.
No, right now, Dean sits on the heated wood of his windowsill, curls up his legs, and gives the tree a good look instead. He counts the roots poking above the ground, then he counts it’s thick, wide branches. But it’s the contours of the leaves, gently trembling in the wind, that have him mesmerized. With his twenty-twenty eyesight, can he really try to count them up?
Still, every now and then, his muscles tense up, his spine itches and he can't stop himself. He whips his body around, ready to shoot, ready to fight whatever monstrosity has been creeping up to him. But there's still nothing. An empty corridor, the same walls ad nauseam.
Have the noises from the pyre died down? Dean could swear he heard the shouts and laughter coming from it just a moment ago. Or maybe it’s just the distance that quieted it when Dean wasn’t paying attention.
Dean stands frozen as the blood creeps up to his feet. It flows around the soles of his boots, then rises in mesmerizing waves. More keeps coming, cascading down the walls, falling off the ceiling.
To free his hands, he sets the gun and the flashlight down, pushes them forward, making sure they're still on his reach. He grasps the rock to pull himself in, he bends and twists his body into aching shapes.
It’s not working and it’s not going to work. The stupid flame doesn’t change and they did have to end up swapping it for a proper candlestick because, due to Dean’s inability to feel it, move it, change it in any way for approximately a hundred birthday candles, Anna’s stash ran out.
Finding out that Cas loves him, that he knows that Dean loves him, too. The blows just keep coming. Cas knows, he has known for god knows how long and Dean feels like an idiot. He opens his mouth to say something, he’ll figure out what exactly, but it doesn’t matter because Cas beats him to it. “I understand.”
And the longer Dean thinks about it, the more his head hurts and his heart aches but more importantly, the more he feels like he can make sense of where Cas is coming from. Because really, of course he raised Sammy for love, of course he fought for the world for everyone he loves. Of course he cares, he cares so much that it drives him crazy sometimes, apparently he cares so much that Cas only started to care because of him.
It’s so effortless and natural, Dean wants to punch himself in the face for thinking it was impossible, that it would always be this unattainable dream, the one thing —
Charlie’s grin fades into a genuine smile when she looks at Dean. “I was just digging up some dirt on Ash from Heaven’s iCloud.”
And the thing is, they knew. Naomi knew that Cas wasn’t on their side, not really, but she needed him to follow orders and complete their mission. She knew that Dean was his weak spot and that she needed to find a way to eradicate it.
He knows this, of course, he does have a lot on his mind but good excuses to being awake are not in there.
“Yeah, I remember,“ Cas whispered, burying his face in the crook of Dean’s neck and rubbing his hand across his back. Dean thought he could feel the weight of the world fall off the angel’s shoulders. When Cas showed up in the bunker, he was a nervous mess, shaking and sweating and actually expecting Dean to tell him off for some godforsaken reason. Now that all is said, he could finally stop worrying.
Once he’s out of there, he throws his bags in the backseat and starts the car. The drive to Charlie’s place is just as long as Dean needs it to be. He listens to the mixtape Cas made for him a while ago in full and arrives at Charlie’s doorstep the minute the last song ends.
He has never given up on Dean, not even after Dean almost killed him under the influence of the mark of cain. He saw the good in Jack when everyone else could only see the spawn of Lucifer. He believed in Sam even when the demon blood was dragging him so far away from everything Cas believed in.
Dean is already nodding his head before Castiel has even finished speaking. He fully steps into the room and quietly shuts the door behind him before he heads towards the chair by the desk. Halfway there, he notices Dean‘s hand flat on the free space next to him, as if inviting Castiel to join him on the bed. Castiel complies and sits down at the top of the bed, leaning his back against the headboard, his legs stretched out in front of him. Dean shifts into the same position next to him, their shoulders brushing and their knees almost touching.
“God, no,” Dean says quickly to get the thought out of Cas’ head. Dean might be curious, but he would never go that far without Cas’ permission. “I had Charlie filter for funny stuff or just things I could tease you with.”
Cas was still trying to avoid Dean‘s eyes, looking down on the ground. He gently grabbed the angel‘s hand and was surprised at how warm and sweaty it was. Dean guided it towards his own body and put it on his chest, right above his heart. Cas‘ eyes finally looked up from the ground when Dean put his own hand on top of Cas‘ shaking one, tightly holding it in place. His gaze stayed on Dean‘s chest for a moment, feeling his heart not just beat, but race, before he finally looked up to meet Dean‘s watery eyes.
And god, Dean is tirelessly searching his mind how to react to all that but he just does not know what to say, doesn’t even know where to start. He’s still processing everything that just happened, from going after Billie to finding out it was all Chuck’s fault, to being chased down to the dungeon. To Cas and the way his eyes lit up when he said there was one way  to stop her, the way he cried when Dean had never seen him cry before. To everything that Cas said to him, that he’s not the mindless killer he was trained to be his whole life, that Dean has never been motivated by anything other than love.
He knew alcohol wouldn’t make him feel any better, but it wouldn’t make him feel worse either. He refilled his glass, again, put the bottle on the side table and leaned back in the armchair.
“I want you to have it because I trust you to take care of it, Dean. I know that it’s safe with you.“
Dean shook his head with a small smile on his lips before engulfing Cas in a tight hug, both arms wrapped around his shoulders while Cas’ arms slowly found Dean’s waist. Dean was warm and his tight grip was silently telling Cas all the things he knew Dean couldn’t say out loud. He knew Dean wasn‘t letting him go, not now, not ever.
He really didn’t plan on kissing Cas, he didn’t want to overwhelm him or scare him off since he didn’t have a whole lot of that kind of experience. But when Dean replayed everything that he’d said in his head, he was the one to be overwhelmed. Remembering what Cas had said to him in the dungeon and and finding out that he became human just to be with Dean was too much at once. A rush of love overcame him and he couldn’t hold back.
He is unsure of what to say as not to misinterpret things again, while at the same time, he would feel terrible leaving Dean by himself in a state like this. He fumbles with words. “I could… keep you company. If-If you like, or-“
It was out there before he remotely thought it through and he immediately bit his lip. Cas’ eyes went wide and his jaw went slack. Dean thought he said the wrong thing—no, he
“Stop thinking so hard, I haven’t said anything yet,“ Cas told him and Dean was reminded once again how well the angel could read him. His playful tone calmed Dean‘s nerves. He took a deep breath and motioned for Cas to continue. “Jack and Amara have been trying to restructure and rebuild Heaven. There‘s new rules and laws.“
he wants to say because it’s true. Dean has never deserved any of the guilt and the pain that has been dumped on him. His soul, with all its scars and all the damage it has taken, is still the most beautiful thing Castiel has ever seen. He wishes he wasn’t so painfully aware of Dean‘s self doubt and the way he can barely look at himself in the mirror. He wants to tell Dean that he deserves more than this life but he’s scared that Dean wouldn’t agree.
There was no rational reason for Dean to keep clinging onto the keys, so he threw them over to Cas. They were married after all, the Impala belonged to Cas just as much as it did to Dean.
“I’m proving a point,” she says tiredly, as if that explains anything. “Ash said if he can’t find Heaven’s backdoor, neither can I.”
Dean’s throat closes up a little. God, if he’d had any idea what he meant to Cas back then already. Dean left him to die in Purgatory and Cas needed his head screwed with to even try to harm Dean. It’s not fair, it’s never been fair because Cas always gave and gave and gave and Dean never gave anything in return. “Cas,” he says, but Cas ignores him.
Dean barely registered Cas’ thumb gently stroking his cheek until it’s gone and Cas’ fingers start cradling the short hair on the back of his head. Instead of pulling Dean close, however, it is Cas who leans in, his hand loose on Dean’s neck and leaving him more than enough room to pull back if he wanted to, because even now, of course, Cas is happily giving him the option to back out at any point.
The door suddenly makes a creaky noise and Dean looks up, visibly surprised and confused, maybe even a little embarrassed . “Cas? What are you doing here?“
Dean’s mouth fell open and it was evident that he was at a loss for words. Cas could see his eyes drop down to the vial in his hand, shutting them slowly before he found his voice. “I don’t know what to say.”
Stressing out over nothing was definitely a human thing. Cas had always known that humans tend to overthink and overanalyze things for no good reason. Now he understood why.
“I... This is-“ Cas stuttered because he realized that he even didn’t know what to say. He sighed and held the box out for Dean to take. “Happy birthday, Dean.“
A small tear rolls down Dean’s cheek and his grip on Cas’ shoulder tightens. He doesn’t know how Cas did it, how an Angel of the lord cracked the shell of an angry, broken man like him, but he did. And ironically, Dean doesn’t know how he cracked Cas’ shell either, he doesn’t know how he made Cas love him so much that he doesn’t even mind giving up his grace just to say it.
Except for that now he actually had to muster up the nerve to give it to Dean and see his reaction and suddenly Cas found himself wanting to back out. Maybe it was too soon, maybe he should blow it off. He had a feeling that Dean would make it a much bigger deal than it was, he didn’t want any gifts in the first place, and Cas would have to explain himself and-
He blinks and reconsiders and something about it feels off to him. It doesn’t make any sense. Cas was going to summon the empty, this must be
Cas thought about how he enjoyed listening to the tape in his own car, playing and replaying it for hours because he didn’t have anything else and besides, he didn’t mind. It was personal, it was unique, and it was heartfelt, just what a gift should be. It didn’t take Cas much longer to come up with an idea then.
“It was—To get back to the alternate dimension your mother and Jack were trapped in, we needed the fruit from the tree of life.” Dean nods, shivering when remembering that time. “The marriage was part of the deal, they gave me the fruit and I married their queen.”
The library was a bit of a mess after he made Sam help him triple check every single book there was, desperately looking for a way to free an angel from the Empty. They found nothing useful, only a handful of spells and rituals that they figured might possibly work, but only ended up being another dead end.
Unfortunately though, Cas sees through Dean’s lies more easily that he likes. He stares into Dean’s eyes as if he’s trying to get a good look at his soul and hell, maybe he is. Dean learns something new about Cas’ angelic powers every day. “Something is troubling you.”
He yawns and rubs his eyes with one hand. Without the need for sleep there no real feeling of being tired either, so Dean’s body must be just faking it. He brushes away the hair from Cas’ forehead and presses a kiss to it.
needed you, did you not get that?” He takes Cas’ lack of a reply and his incessant blinking as a no. “I needed you ‘cause you were my best friend and ‘cause I loved you.”
There must have been a fork in the road, too well obscured by the play of light and shadow that he never even knew it was there. He took the wrong turn when he thought there was only one.
This is the opposite of relaxing. A minute longer and he’ll have thick drops of sweat rolling down his forehead.
He doesn’t mind, though he’d rather be out of here. He’d rather be in the motel room, savoring the moment before falling asleep in Cas's embrace.
He shifts his eyes to the stand right behind Bess's as his fingers lift to his hair half-mindedly. He's not exactly gonna preen, but still gotta make sure that he looks better than the first time they met—though that's probably not hard since as it turned out later, there was soot on his face that neither of his so-called friends informed him about. Assholes.
It doesn’t work with his eyes open, with the brightness of the flame burning its afterimage into Dean’s retinas and threatening to give him nightmares hardly any house fire ever did, after their house fire, at least.
“If you’d rather start with a bigger candle, that can be arranged,” Anna says as if reading his mind.
Dean almost laughs. There’s no way a familiar could be interested in him before he’s even made his offering. Even then, it’s a big
Cas can’t help but accompany Benny’s laughter. It’s Dean Winchester, after all. Of course, he’d go against God, for the world, for freedom. For love.
It’s easy for her to say when she’s not the one sweating under her intense stare—it must be running in the family, except Cas’s piercing gaze has a very different effect on Dean than Anna’s. And it’s not her whose muscles come seconds away from cramping from the built up tension as he’s trying, subconsciously, to grab the warmth, the swirling particles, with his hands and stretch them out with brute force.
“I’m pretty sure there’s also wine,” Castiel says, as the lights form a path before them. “And food.”
Shame slashes hot and sharp through his gut, and the heat of the fire a couple of feet away is only part of the reason for the blush crawling up his face. This whole thing seems ridiculous all of a sudden. Dean has average magic, less than average offerings. Compared to everyone else attending, he has nothing. If anyone on the other side is keeping a list of the witch candidates, then surely Dean’s name is on the very bottom. This is a waste of time. A waste of Bobby’s money to make the trip out here in the first place.
He's got nothing he could use to pick a lock in the shackle. He can’t rip his foot out of it, but he's still trying. He doesn’t care about the damage it will do to his foot, his tendons and bones.
The buzzing in his head is gone. Dripping down his face, there's only sweat. When he touches his forehead, he finds nothing but a few scraps.
How long has it been? How long since he got here, since he gave up his life for Dean? He doesn’t regret it, not for one second. He was always gonna end up here, anyway. What’s important is that Dean is alive, fighting God, saving the world.
“No more than a scent of baking cherry pie luring you downstairs can hurt you,” Cas says and teases at the same time.
So he's about to ask about what's up with all those honey names when he realizes, well, what the hell, he might as well ask.
It feels so natural, like it’s always meant to be a part of him. Like maybe it always has been a part of him. He becomes so much more aware of his surroundings, of the soft wind caressing his neck, of the bugs running in the grass and the bats singing in the treetops. Of the crackling fire in the distance and the people dancing around it. Of his own lights spinning around them.
They’ve become bonded, and the feeling’s so palpable. As if a part of him shifted and became one with Castiel. A part of Castiel became one with him.
And, well, Dean fucking hates tight spaces. It's not claustrophobia, okay? He will push through if he has to. But there's just something about the walls closing in around his body, blocking his movement and making him vulnerable to any threats that might come after him that makes him really fucking uncomfortable.
It's near damn impossible to squat with his thighs stacked together, let alone keep moving like this. At last, it's zero to one for the fucked up game of Limbo as Dean's knees buckle and hit the ground with a concerning creak.
He'd never have to drop to his knees, scared and alone and not significant enough for this fucking tunnel to have some goddamn respect.
It doesn’t work with his eyes closed either. The flame remains just where it was, the edge of its warmth still barely grazing the skin of his palms and disappearing when his hands inch away. It doesn’t follow, doesn’t expand, doesn’t cling to his fingertips like a sticky paste he imagines it as.
Sometimes in the summer’s early mornings, Dean likes to open the window, climb onto the windowsill and listen to the birds chirping in its branches (he doesn’t like those birds half as much when they wake him up hours before the alarm goes off).
This one rule they set before even stepping a foot in. Because when did splitting up ever not end in a huge fucking mess?
Dean couldn’t take his eyes off Cas if he wanted to. His knitted brows, watery eyes, chapped lips. It would be so easy to lean forward and close the little distance between them and just kiss him. It would be so easy to grab the back of his neck and pull him close. It would be so easy to kiss him the way he should be kissed, and Dean wants to do it, every cell of his body is telling him to do it, but Dean has never been one to take the easy route.
He is cut off by Meg lifting her hand and making a fist and then Cas is on his knees, an invisible hand holding him tight and steady at her mercy. Cas lets out a small cry of pain and it immediately snaps Dean out of his haze. “Stop,” he yells, at least he means to, but his voice fails him and it comes out much quieter and desperate than he intended. Meg turns to look at him as he tries to push himself to his feet but her glare keeps him pinned to the wall, unable to move.
He thought about it for a short moment. “A few months, I suppose. Time works differently in heaven.“
A small scoff comes out of Dean‘s mouth before he shakes his head just the tiniest bit. He looks down at his hands in his lap and Castiel takes the silence as his cue to leave. The door is nearly shut behind him when a quiet call of Castiel‘s name stops him. After a short moment of deliberation, he sticks his head back into the room and sees Dean staring up at him with a soft face. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but then he freezes. “Nevermind,“ he mumbles, breaking eye contact.
Shit. He knew he was forgetting about something. Well, cat’s out, and there’s no reasonable way for him to make up a good excuse this time. “Charlie.”
“It probably wasn’t,” Dean agrees with a scoff, glad about the fact that Cas is so okay with this, apparently, “but you know how they are.”
“It was just a matter of time, anyway. A few years, maybe a decade, and it would have been depleted by itself, and that’s alright because I... sometimes I feel like I don’t even want it anymore, because it’s not who I am anymore. I don’t need it. And it’s not much good anyway, since... what you’re holding is all that’s left. I thought there would be more, but... that’s all of it. I guess I should have known.“
Dean looks at Cas, confused, panicking and worrying if he overstepped already. “I need to know that you’re okay,” Cas explains plainly and calmly.
“Dean, please.” His tone is nothing short of desperate and Dean bites his tongue. He brought it up, so he’s just gonna have to listen. “The angel tablet was my highest priority. I was supposed to return it to Heaven at all cost.”
It’s a torturous few minutes for his husband, but Dean’s absolutely having the time of his—well, you know. He’ll never get enough of the sound of Cas’ laugh, he didn’t get to hear it enough when they were alive, so you bet he’s gonna make sure to make the most of it now.
After all, it’s always been the most likely way for him to go, right? The fact that he’d finally stopped waiting for it and tried to embrace life for once didn’t change that. And then, someone like him to making it to Heaven was quite a surprise. But then there was Bobby, and then Bobby said Cas was here too, and that definitely changed things.
Anyway. Dean casually reminisces about that day while standing in the cheese aisle the grocery store because apparently even in Heaven, you still need to go grocery shopping. Cas has explained to him that it’s not really a necessity, it’s only a way to give everyone some sense of purpose or just a way to pass the time.
Dean’s heart just about bursts, explodes, and leaves him a smear on the wall. They shuffle back down into a horizontal position and Dean snuggles into Cas’ side (looking so invitingly pokable, but sometimes Dean does have some self control), throwing one arm over him and resting his head where Cas’ collarbone meets his shoulder.
Dean barely has time to comprehend those words because suddenly there’s a flash in Cas’ eyes, there for just a second and then it’s gone again. Dean hasn’t seen anything like it in him before, and it should worry him, really, but he can’t think about it right now, not with everything that is happening. Dean is a mess, feels like he’s barely here, like his mind is underwater and his body running on autopilot, his heart is racing and his lungs hurt and the tears in his eyes have been threatening to spill for a while now. When Cas physically pushes him away, Dean doesn’t even feel the pain of his body hitting the cold hard floor.
Carefully walking out to the open section of the room, he found that there were only a few spots left for him to sit. A few were way back from the stage, and there was a small table off to the right of the stage. The stage in question was currently empty of bodies and had been set up with two chairs, mic stands, guitars, a small drum set, and some speakers.
Castiel stepped out of his car and walked over to his friend. "I could have picked you up, you know." He could feel the smile on his face as he stopped in front of Balthazar.
The water continued to warm him up, and he dragged his hand over his length, giving himself a few pumps. The moan punched out of his throat, and he dropped the washcloth. His other hand flew up to support himself against the wall of his shower.
Castiel felt warmth fill his chest. His face felt too hot. It was a split second, but it was long enough for him to get a glimpse of the greenest eyes he'd ever seen. Then the man winked at him, and all his thoughts just vanished.
"So here it goes, we're Radio Company and you are our first show. Let's rock and roll," he nodded once and took a step back from the mic stand. Turned and said something to the taller man, Sammy.
Once he's close enough, he puts the flashlight down right before him and reaches out with his arm. He manages to pinch the piece with his fingers and pull it back to his eyes. It's about a two by two inches piece of torn fabric. The same damn fabric, white with crossing blue lines of Dean's plaid shirt. Cas's plaid shirt. And along one edge, it's stained with blood.
Without thinking, Dean shoots towards it. Human or monster, he just wants to see another living being. And hopefully not be too late to save someone.
With a flicker, the flame goes out, a trail of smoke rising in its wake. Benny and Charlie cheer, while the rest of the traitors that bet against Dean, sound a little more begrudgingly.
With an unamused glare, Dean nods. Way to give him a heart attack. This whole thing already feels like turning his entire being around. But giving up coffee? That would be too much. Even for Cas.
He would never hesitate if there was smoke coming from the crack, not for a second. If the heat of fire radiated through the solid wood, if the stench of burning permeated the air around him. All of that he’s used to, after all. Saving life is his bread and butter. Changing his own — in a very different way than third-degree burns he risks each day would — that’s a bit more nerve-racking.
But then Dean went in and out and no panic attack ever happened. He was determined to save people from fires like his mom maybe could have been saved, and that was enough to choke out any fear in him.
He takes a breath, giving Cas a moment to interrupt him, to protest or laugh at him, but Cas just listens, so Dean continues.
Dean jolts up, back to his feet. This can't be— He buried him. He cradled Benny's head gently, tucked it in the ground in that forest in Maine and buried it with the rest of his body. He can't be here.
On his knees, Dean rushes to the other corpse. It's not the right shirt, now that he can see it up close. It's plain white, without blue, crossing lines on the fabric. Dean gets a grip on the man's shoulder to turn him over and by touch alone he knows it's not Cas. It doesn't feel like Cas.
If anything, he expected one of those long, slender candles you stick into candelabres, but he might have some prejudices there coming from a lifetime of only seeing magic practitioners in the movies, so he keeps his mouth shut.
Is it? A date? Or is it just what they agreed to — a thank you for saving my life dinner? He doesn’t even know if Cas is into guys. Let alone into him.
The tunnel had its end, but it's not the end of the road. If the stacked stones and clean angles have been the cruel design, this is where the real Shawshank begins.
And Cas didn’t even give him the whole alien-like apiary attire to protect him. He said he doesn’t even own one. What kind of beekeeper doesn’t have one anyway?
He flails his hands and legs trying to get up and behind him, his palm meets something wet, but it's not thick blood—it's water. It's just water. Maybe there's an exit that way, out into the river that borders the town.
He’s glowing; peaceful and rested. Dean picked a good day, even if he doesn’t feel one hundred percent certain of his skills yet.
Dean runs faster than he thought he can still run, Cas's name a constant on his lips. Cas couldn't make it too far. He's gonna be crouching here somewhere, by the wall. Too weakened to walk. To weakened to move.
And then Castiel appears, looking much better than the last time, not so disheveled and weak, there's color in his cheeks, though the disarray on his head might just be his brand.
Well, maybe the kid will even recommend him something and Dean'll discover his new favorite food that'll let him lay off unhealthy burgers. Right.
“You promised to stay in my eyesight, you dumbass!” Dean shouts. ‘Cause being angry is easier than letting the stupid feeling in his chest gnaw on him.
With each step he’s getting closer, it’s almost a relief. But Dean won’t be truly calm until Cas is safe within his arm’s reach.
With that, she pulls something out of her pocket and throws it on Dean’s lap. It’s hard and heavy and fits into Dean’s hand as he lifts it. A small jar of a golden liquid, a picture or a bee on the label.
As soon as he stumbles out of the building, Benny's right beside him. Dean yanks off the helmet and breathes in heavy gulps of fresh, evening air. He's alive and nearly unscathed. Lucked out yet again.
Dean drops to his knees, as the piece disappears in the darkness. He frantically searches the ground, but the thing is gone. No, he's not ready to let go of Cas yet.
At last, the guy pays and begins to move. Dean puts on his most charming smile to be visible right away. And then the guy's wide back moves out of Dean's way to reveal—not Castiel.
Dean keeps on chasing, calling Cas’s name. He couldn’t have gotten that far. He only had a few seconds of a head start and Dean’s still a faster runner than him.
There’s still so much darkness left to penetrate before him. But each step puts more darkness behind. There’s nothing there but that; the dead end, the cold stone, the cobwebs.
Cas doesn't say anything when Dean finds his palm and interlocks their fingers. He even gives him a reassuring squeeze.
As if to underline that though, the main pyre flares higher for a split second, and then a dove flies out of it.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Cas says, surprising even himself. Although Dean adored Benny, Cas and he never really got close. It wasn’t that Cas was jealous. Or maybe he was—he was that Benny got to take care of Dean while Cas fled. But that’s Cas’s own fault. And it was so long ago.
But then, there’ll be a lot of time for that later. They got their whole, bonded lives for that. Samhain, after all, is only once a year.
He bows his head to Dean in a little remnant of the tradition Dean used to think was the only way. But it was barely a way at all.
The sound of his phone going off makes him jump in his seat. The connection is broken. But he doesn’t mind, for now. It’s Cas. He’s got a couple hours to kill. Dean blows at the candle to blow it out, and with a whole new kind of butterflies in his stomach, he rushes to spend the afternoon with his friend.
