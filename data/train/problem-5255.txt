“What?” he asked, trying to focus on Bucky for the first time since lunch had started. He heard Clint chuckling on his right, but didn’t really pay too much attention to him, since he knew his friend was already having way too much fun with the whole ‘SteveTony’ situation, as he liked to call it.
“What?” was the only thing Steve managed to say, but Natasha’s unimpressed look made him continue, “I mean, no, I can’t, he doesn’t like me like that” and how sad was it to finally admit it out loud? That definitely destroyed all the hope Steve still had in him, but maybe it was for the better, he couldn’t just keep on falling for every smile Tony directed at him and actually believe one day he’d get to kiss that smile.
“Not in the slightest” he quickly replied, trying so hard not to smile, but failing, ending up laughing like an idiot, with Tony following him right after. And that was it, that was the reason why he liked Tony so much, because it didn’t matter how bad things were, he could always count on him to make him smile. Tony had that something in his eyes that made it impossible to look away from them, and his laugh was so contagious that it was impossible to not laugh along, and his smile was so soft, his voice so caring, his touch so kind, that it was impossible to not fall in love with him. And that was the reason why Steve could never really get jealous whenever he saw someone flirting with Tony, or asking him out, or showing interest in him, because he understood it, and he knew way too well that it was impossible to look away when Tony was in front of you, because Tony simply stole everyone’s attention once he entered a room, he was charming like that, and Steve had learned to love that aspect of Tony too.
The white floor started to shine a little grey line and Tony followed it. Maybe it was the way out of here.
Steve was caught off guard, well he was caught off guard with the call anyway, but this wasn’t a “hey I miss you” kind of call or “I have to stay a few mor days”. But instead he got a loaded question out of nowhere, nothing to back it up. All Steve could do was worry.
Steve hopped out the bed, excited that today was the last day. Tony would be here early that next morning, returning in his arms as he said. Then they would have coffee and sleep with each other in their arms and deliver uncalled for PDA for the team. Everything would go back to normal.
“I made you soup” Steve handed him the bowel. Tony finally sat up fully and grabbed for the bowl. He looked like baby wanting a toy. Steve sat at the couch next to him blindly watching the tv.
The sun didn’t shine on the bed in Tony’s room. The pillows were softer in Tony’s room. There wasn’t an arm wrapped around his waist pulling him closer in his room. And there definitely wasn’t a feeling of belonging in his room, with whoever he was snuggled close to.
It smelled great, a little bit overpowering on his nose and it was warm. Steve was relaxed, anyone would be relaxed, but Tony was still closed off. But the blonde understood, he would never be back to himself after his mom died. Not even with Bucky, their will always be a part of him gone.
“And what about you?” he asked, looking right into Steve’s eyes, and Steve felt a little like everything else around them had disappeared all of a sudden, leaving the two of them alone in the world, “Aren’t you a little bummed about it?” but he put so much emphasis on that words that Steve could feel he was just making fun of him.
“It doesn’t matter if he likes you back” simply replied Natasha, eating another one of Bucky’s fries with some mayonnaise from Thor’s plate, “you have to let him know before you two part for college” she continued, and really, whenever Natasha said anything it always sounded like the smartest thing ever, and Steve hated her for that so much, but also loved being able to always ask for good advices from one of his best friends.
“Hi, Tony” he greeted him, still wearing his big dumb smile, and he could hear his own heart beating embarrassingly faster in his chest with every step Tony took in his direction.
“Wanna walk me home?” Tony asked him, since he didn’t live far from Clint, and Steve didn’t live far from Tony, so they could both easily walk home.
“You don’t think I would know if Tony liked me back?” he asked, now a little frustrated with his friends not understanding just how painful it was to be able to see Tony smile at someone else across the room, “I’ve been crushing on him for the past four years and he never,
“So you’re okay with it?” Natasha had asked him a couple of weeks later, when it was clear Tony was now dating Strange, since they spent almost every minute together.
“No, sorry” he admitted, shaking his head a little and turning to face her, “what were you saying?” he asked her, even if he was still thinking of Tony, something that had started happening a lot more after the end of the school year.
“Yes, I know” he dumbly replied, still looking right into Tony’s eyes, trying to smile a little, hoping the other boy would eventually stop looking so fucking sad.
“Sure, he’s the one bummed about it, uh?” Tony chuckled, following Steve when he started walking towards his class, and grinning like he knew exactly what was going on inside Steve’s mind.
“I never thought Tony would be one for excessive public displays of affection, though” added Clint, and now everyone at their table turned to look in Tony’s direction, and Steve, who really didn’t want to do that, ended up following everyone else’s glare. And it was great, really, to not only see Tony laugh at whatever dumb shit Strange had said, but also have to witness the guy he loved lean in and kiss someone else, there, right in front of everyone’s eyes. But the worst part of it wasn’t really the kiss itself, no, because that wasn’t the first time Steve had seen Tony kiss someone else, hell, they had been to plenty of parties together, no, the worst part was the little smile on Tony’s lips after the kiss ended. Tony looked like kissing Stephen Strange truly made him happy, and Steve wanted to hate him for that, really, but he simply couldn’t, not when he looked so fucking happy doing something as simple as kissing his boyfriend during lunch.
“I wanted to let you know that Tony texted me” she repeated, and, at the mention of the other boy, Steve really started to pay attention to her, “and he said, and I quote, that he ‘could never miss Steve’s party’, and added that he already bought your gift” she told him, and Steve’s heart almost skipped a beat, because Tony was really going to be at his birthday party. And sure, if anyone had told him, just a couple of months before, that he was going to doubt that Tony would make it to his birthday party, Steve would have told them that they were crazy, that Tony was his best friend and that celebrating both the Fourth of July and his birthday was a tradition, and something none of his friends would ever miss. But, having seen how easily traditions could be broken, Steve had spent the last week of June convincing himself that Tony would eventually come up with an excuse to not attend Steve’s party, and, even if that mere thought had pained him like nothing else had ever done in his life, Steve believed he’d be able to fake a smile and tell his best friend that it was okay, and that he knew how busy he was, because it was the truth, Tony was always busy, just never too busy for Steve, at least not before.
“Is everything alright?” Tony asked, getting a little closer to Steve, and Steve finally stopped looking at the ground and brought his head up, facing Tony. His heart was beating faster than ever, his palms were sweating a little, and his breathing was still a bit heavy, even if he had tried to keep it under control for the past minute or so.
“Yeah” Steve simply said, trying to keep his cool and taking a sip of his lemonade, “I knew he’d come” he added, sounding a lot more confident than he was actually feeling, but Natasha didn’t need to know that.
“Why would I ruin our friendship like that?” he tried again, getting a sip of his water and trying not to look in Tony’s direction once again, because really, there wasn’t any point in hurting himself like that.
“You don’t know that” said Janet, and she sounded a lot more serious than Steve was expecting from her, she was the first to know just how easily Tony fell in and out of love for the people he dated. If he was really into Steve, he would have said something about it, right? Hell, they had been friends for almost four years and all Tony managed to tell Steve was how cute he would have been with Sharon Carter from Biology 1. And sure, Sharon was pretty and she was one of the best students in their Biology class, but why would Tony even say that? Steve didn’t understand it back then and, to be honest, he still didn’t really get what Tony wanted to say with that comment.
“Oh, you weren’t there? I didn’t notice” he replied instead, grinning at Tony and hearing the boy’s beautiful laugh in his ears, feeling his heart melt a bit at the sound.
“I know, but..” he started, not really sure of what he was going to say, “I’ve liked you since we first met, I couldn’t say goodbye before telling you how I felt” he tried to explain, his hands now itching to move forward and touch Tony again, hug him tight and tell him everything was going to be alright, that they had nothing to worry about.
Tony broke from the kiss first, looking down and passing his tongue quickly on his now red lips, and Steve still couldn’t believe he had just kissed him, he couldn’t believe he had finally got to taste Tony’s lips. And he knew he was ready to do it again, and again, and fucking again, until Tony would let him, until he had air in his lungs, until he knew Tony’s lips by heart, until his lips tasted like Tony’s.
“Nothing” he quickly replied, turning to look at Tony, who, disturbingly enough, looked kinda hurt by Steve’s question, “I, uh− I just meant you already went out with that Victor guy and it looked like you liked him?” he tried to add, but, judging by the look on Tony’s face, he wasn’t really making anything less awkward.
“I think you should talk to him before school ends” had suggested Bucky later that week, while they were all sitting together at lunch, but Steve wasn’t really listening. It was impossible to pay attention to the conversations going on at his table when he could clearly see Tony laughing at Stephen Strange’s jokes on the other side of the school canteen. And seriously, why did Tony still talk to that guy? Why did he prefer to spend his lunch break with his smart friends and not with his old friends? Steve wasn’t jealous, really, but it hurt him a little, that Tony was actually spending most of his last year with people he had just met and not with the old group, not with Steve. He couldn’t blame Tony for having other friends, because Steve knew way too well just how popular Tony was in school and outside of it, but it was still a little painful to see him so happy but so far away from him. To think that in less than two months school was going to be over, and with it every chance Steve had of spending time with the person he liked the most.
“Why? What do you mean?” he quickly asked, trying to take a step in his direction, but seeing how Tony almost flinched back, “Tony, are you okay?” he kept looking into the other boy’s eyes, trying to find in them the answers to his questions.
“Steve, are you listening?” Natasha asked him one day, while the two of them were sitting on Steve’s porch, drinking homemade lemonade and trying not to melt because of the summer’s heat.
“You can say you’re jealous, you know? It’s normal” added Bucky, who was sitting between him and Natasha at lunch, and everyone else at the table nodded in agreement.
, showed any sign of liking me back” he added, looking at each of his friends, daring them to say he was wrong, to say that there was a possibility that Tony might actually like Steve, even if he had never shown it and was currently probably seeing someone else.
“So you’re going out with him too?” Steve asked, trying to sound casual, while looking at his schedule to see what books he was supposed to bring to his next class.
“Right” she commented, smiling at him knowingly, and Steve realised she knew exactly what Steve had feared, but she was kind enough to not bring it up, “so I guess it’s all settled for Thursday” she continued, and Steve nodded along with her words, taking another sip of his lemonade, and, for the first time since school had ended, he felt happy, like truly happy. He didn’t really know why he was feeling that way, because nothing had really changed, but simply knowing that in just a couple of days his whole group of friends would be reunited for his birthday made his heart melt a bit, and he couldn’t help the little smile that curved his lips in that moment. Sure, Tony coming to his party did not mean that anything was going to change between them, because Steve had no intention of finally confessing his feelings to his best friend, but being able to spend some time with his friends was enough, not everything he wanted, but all he needed.
“Steve, we met four years ago” he said, taking a shaky breath and focusing again on Steve, looking at him like he was some special creature that needed to be treated in a kind and sweet way. Steve hated to see Tony like that, and hated his friends for convincing him that telling Tony everything was a good idea, but, most of all, he hated himself, for not keeping his mouth shut and ruining Tony’s last days before university started.
“Sure” he replied, smiling at the other boy and starting to walk by his side, something he was used to do, at that point. They walked in silence for a while, the only sound being the one their shoes made when touching the ground, and Steve’s heart started beating a little faster every time their shoulders touched, because that meant Tony was leaning a bit closer to him.
“I’m leaving for Massachusetts in two days, Steve” was the only thing Tony said, and his voice was shaking, and Steve had never heard him sound so hurt, almost like talking to Steve was the most painful thing he’d ever done.
“You’re cute when you try to deny it, Rogers” he commented playfully, stopping right outside of Steve’s classroom, “See you at lunch?” he asked then, making it sound like the most obvious question, even if the truth was that Tony had been avoiding their table at lunch for more than a month, and school was ending in less than two weeks.
“No, that’s not what I meant at all!” he hurried to reply, trying to create some space between their bodies now that they were mere inches away from each other, and that was really not helping Steve’s poor heart, already beating damn fast because of how much he was panicking, “I’m sorry” he added, and he really was, because the last thing he wanted was to make Tony feel bad for something that really wasn’t even a reason to blame him. It wasn’t Tony’s fault everyone wanted him. And it sure wasn’t Tony’s fault Steve wanted him. Hearing his words, Tony backed down a little, taking a couple of steps back and letting his finger down, now looking more sad than angry, if Steve could read his expression correctly, and he usually could.
The celebrations for the Fourth of July and Steve’s birthday had been fun, Steve couldn’t really deny that, and the fact that Tony had spent all night with them, drinking and chatting, laughing at Steve’s jokes and telling everyone about his break-up with Strange, well, that had been amazing. Steve had missed having Tony around, and, of course, he knew that everyone else had missed him too, but Steve thought, deep down, that feeling what he felt for Tony meant also missing him the most when he wasn’t with him. “I wish I’d dumped Strange sooner” Tony had confessed to him at some point of the night, when it was only the two of them still sitting at the table, now feeling a little tipsy after dinner, “and I’m sorry I didn’t hang out with you guys as much as we used to do” he had continued, and Steve could see that he was truly sorry for it. “It’s okay, Tony” he had reassured him, putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it lightly, “I know you’re busy” he added then, hearing the pain in his own words, because it didn’t matter how much Steve wanted to believe it was okay, the truth was that it wasn’t, that Steve wasn’t okay, and that it was Tony’s fault. “It’s just that I had never had a relationship that long” Tony had said after being quiet for a couple of minutes, and he was looking at the beer in his hand like he couldn’t really see it, “and Stephen is really smart, so it was easy being around him” and sure, Steve knew he wasn’t the brightest of Tony’s friends, but still, hearing that Tony had dated Strange for that long simply because everyone else was too dumb had been like a bucket of cold water right in the face. “Cool” Steve had simply replied, not feeling like adding anything else, mostly because he was afraid he’d sound too hurt or, even worse, too jealous. “Sorry, I know you don’t really care about this stuff” Tony had joked, turning his head up to look into Steve’s eyes, and it seemed like he was looking for something, maybe expecting Steve to say something on the matter, but Steve didn’t, so Tony smiled at him, a little too sadly to actually pass as a real smile, and got up to go talk with the others, leaving Steve alone at the table, with a lonely tear running down his cheek.
Weeks passed, and the entire school was now buzzing with the anticipation of three whole months of freedom, three whole months to spend doing whatever the fuck they wanted with the people they loved the most, without having to think about the future, even if it was just for a bit. But Steve, who so ingenuously thought his high school years had been the best years of his life, and was now afraid of saying goodbye to them, yes Steve wasn’t so eager to leave school behind. His friends were already planning parties and trips for the summer to come, and, of course, he was more than happy to join them, but they had just been told by Tony that he wouldn’t make it to their annual camping trip, and that had felt like a punch, right in all of them’s faces, but, most of all, in Steve’s, since he had been the one starting that tradition almost four years before. He had tried to convince Tony, helped by everyone else, but Tony had argued that he had so little time left to spend in town, and he didn’t really want to waste a full week camping, since he actually loathed going camping. “He didn’t mean it” was the first thing Natasha had said, worried that Steve might take that a little to personally, “you know he’ll make up for it with a big surprise or something like that” had added Clint right after, but he looked as sad as Steve did, so it wasn’t really the best one to cheer everyone else up. But the truth was, and Steve didn’t even really understand why, the truth was he was okay with Tony not going, and he had known all along that he hated going camping, because they had met during a trip organised by the school on their first year, and Tony had complained for every minute of it, because there was nothing he actually enjoyed about going camping. And it was funny, because Steve loved camping more than anything, since he had grown up with his dad, who was almost as passionate about it as he was, so being assigned a tent with the only kid in his school who hated camping had been the most ironic moment of his entire life. Of course, as the days went by, Steve realised Tony wasn’t so bad, even if he was kind of a whiny kid, and the two of them became friends, so when later that year Steve suggested they went camping in the summer, everyone else had been excited, and Tony had simply laughed, to a joke that no one but them could really understand, and agreed to it.
“I’ll be there if something bad ever happens. I’ll be on me. I’ll keep my eyes peered, I promise, just don’t do that again. Ever.”
Steve stared at Tony’s face, noticing it was no longer red and full of worry lines. The man looked peaceful for once, younger. Happier. Steve wanted to commit the image to his mind, just so he could have it to look back on. Gosh, he loved this man. He just wished Tony knew it.
Tony was just really insecure deep down. And Clint was going to have to at least try and open him up. Just a bit.
The sting of the glass was almost nonexistent as it pierced his skin.  Steve hardly noticed the broken glass in his hand as he stared at Tony across the room. There he was, waltzing away with a broad completely engrossed with her. And there was Steve by the bar with a broken the champagne glass in his hand, the liquid and small pieces of glass dripping to the floor.
Tony stayed in that floor for a while, sobbing as he tried to catch his breath. There was a constant pain but he was grateful; the arc reactor was back. All of that was a dream.
“No, you can’t. I’m . . . I won’t be here today-I’m going places, alone. It’s important.” Tony turned his head to look Steve in the eye. There was a type of desperation deep in those brown eyes showing how badly he needed this day.
“Then I’ll be here with you.” Steve kissed his check. Tony leaned onto Steve his back against the blonde’s chest. He was lucky to have him, Tony knew it. He wanted to be with the man and was willing to work for it. Even if it meant actually trying to undo his self hate because it would be worth it.
Tony didn’t know why Steve was saying all these nice things. It didn’t make sense, he had just made him cry and now Steve is encouraging him. Tony wasn’t all those nice things and he knew it, he had been told that since forever.
“But I thought- i thought we were going somewhere. . .” Tony spoke, his voice breaking. Trying was a waste of time - Tony knew it was- but he needed to know if that was Steve really thought since the beginning. Did he really hate him when the kissed that night at the gala or did he do something wrong. It was his fault either way, but knowing that it was just a part of him was better than thinking he made a mistake.
“All Midguardians are tiny and adorable, but Anthony is the most adorable” Thor thought. They continued to study the art of singing for another half and hour, only ended when Tony’s ‘Oldies’ playlist was over.
“Can you shut up for once in your life?” Steve interrupted. Tony’s month closed instantly as his face fell.
Steve turned back to the bar, never releasing his fist, and stared at the counter. He didn’t want to see the damage done to his hand- his heart already had been through enough- Steve didn’t need to see anymore. Steve just couldn’t believe what he saw, well he didn’t want to believe, but it was real.
All Steve knew is that he had a smile on his face when he finally fell towards the pit black darkness.
“The fight doesn’t matter, Tony. I’m sorry for chewing you out without getting the full story. It’s my fault.” Steve stopped him, “I won’t do it again. Promise.”
Tony gave out a content sound, like a happy sigh, as Steve snugged deep down in the covers. It was quiet the only sound being Tony’s breathing.
“Well, I had just came to see if you can fix my iPad again. But I think I found something much better!” Steve said very excited! He moved towards the vacant stool and sat next to the man.
“Okay, but how was your day slash night? What are you out there doing without me- gambling, drinking with Nat, jumping out a windows? I need answers here, Rogers!” There was another yawn but Steve wasn’t ready to say goodnight yet.
It became so easily ‘theirs’ just by the stroke of the hand. His and Tony’s. Steve’s and Tony’s, together. They could be doing everything together, morning coffee and late night dinners, laughs and watching movies but not if . . . not if Tony kept this up.
“A crush! So who’s the lucky gal, Stark? Or guy?” Clint asked excitedly, almost spilling his cereal.
He watched as Tony became so engrossed with his hand, the little rise of his right eyebrow and how his eyes became smaller with concentration. The smaller man acted as if he blocked out the world with such ease and became something to far to reach. Steve enjoyed it when Tony went in his cycle, it gave more time to study the man when he wasn’t always in a rush. Especially when Tony would return back to the world, blinking and trying to recognize where he was at. It was quite silly to watch, but it was entertaining to Steve.
The sun brought a warm heat on Tony’s cheek while he basked in the heat the bed held with closed eyes. It was nice. Too nice.
“You broke it good this time huh. I’ll fix it later today, definitely before dinner or something.” He kept turning the iPad in his hands, like he was fighting the urge to take it apart and fix it right that instant.
“But I’m wearing mismatched socks. And my hair messed up. And- ” He pulled her back. His eyes were frantic, looking for something that was right in all this supposed mess.
“Your painting done now. What are you going to do with it?” Steve asked with amusement in his eyes, crossing his arms.
Steve was baffled. Yes, he wanted to pick a fight and yes, now thinking about it would lead to something big between the two. But he didn’t expect that result. He didn’t expect Tony to give unto defeat.
Steve’s limbs moved without as he walked towards the man with the need to just protect. He sat down and tried to wrap his arms around his boyfriend but was pushed away.
It was nice, having this time with Tony. Nat knew she was the only one, out of the team, who got to see the slowed down side of Tony. The one that wasn’t always worrying or overthinking. The one that wasn’t in a rush. All those sides of Tony where great, but Natasha likes this one best.
“It makes you feel small, in here, doesn’t it? That we’re just a speck of something bigger. I don’t know but maybe it could be comforting. But I don’t know.“ he rambled. This was the way he conveyed whatever that was in his mind involving feelings.
But Clint had never seen Tony like this, in complete disarray. A complete difference from how Tony always showed himself and Clint didn’t know which one he liked better. Tonys brain was going a mile a minute in a race that was already over. Clint didn’t know what to do but watch.
“You should sleep in my bed more often.” Was whispered in his ear. Tony froze but those arms still held firm against his waist. Tony wasn’t going anywhere soon even if he tried.
“Well Mr. Rogers, Sir is ill at this time. Excessive use of the suit can cause the reactor to become overheated, which can result in death. Per my programming, my priority is to keep Sir safe at all times.” Jarvis spat.
So they sat there, both telling stories of constellations they knew. Tony knew many and the story behind them, from Greek and Roman myths. Natasha told the Russian ones she knew in her childhood. It was very few good ones but it seemed that Tony didn’t care, he was just intent with something bloody as well as something sweet.
Tony slowly open his eyes, adjusting to the light, to find who this mysterious person was. One eye at time, he adjusted to see Steve.
“ It’s our painting now. We’ll share it.” Tony said with a smile as he put a small TS and SR on the top right. It was barely seeable, like a watermark, and blended into the art.
If anyone asked why, her answer would be she couldn’t sleep but to honest, she felt the urge to explore. Since she lived here Natasha had only glimpsed at the blueprints when visiting Tony to discuss her widow bites. Then, she saw a department on the blueprints, something Nat had never seen before. Or even known about before.
After walking for a while, nothing was popping up. Tony even wondered if he was moving at all. There he was in a oversized suit of all things, walking like a maniac. More like running now due to his panic.
But what would make Tony want drink? What’s caused him to go to that bar and drink till he forgot? What caused him to get so drunk enough to call Steve for help with a scared voice?
He remembered how Tony didn’t hold himself up right. The coughing fit and how it took him minutes to recover. How sweaty his skin was. All signs of being sick. But Steve let his own anger get the best of him.
Thor did absolute best to listen and copy Tony’s voice. It was hard at first, he had to admit, but soon (with practice) he could too have the honey dropped voice.
“This isn’t going to work out. No one wants all of me. I don’t even want all of me. I don’t see why you do?”
“Well, it looks good on you. Especially the blue on your face there.” Steve pointed out with a loving smile. Tony face scrunched up in confusion as he reached to touch his face. The paint stained his fingers and he gave a smile.
The ugly big fat tears had come by now and he held his knees close to his chest. He looked like a child who had just gotten yelled at rather harshly. The man was even a horrible ugly crier!
“No, we made you breakfast! Steven and I made the rolls of cinnamon.” Thor answered and he brought the tray. Steve was amazed that he didn’t drop it since he was radiating excitement.
Tony Stark doesn’t give up into defeat willing. Steve remembered all of their fights and how it was usually him giving up the fight and sighing in defeat. Not Tony. Never Tony.
The man threw the covers off and slowly made his way toward the door. He tried to wipe the sleep out of his eyes, opening the door to see- Tony!
After glancing at Tony one last time, he joined the rest of the team in the kitchen. They all had started on breakfast, Natasha making bacon, Thor with the cinnamon rolls (which they found out Tony likes) and Clint working the coffee.
“You might like this.” Steve picked up the paint brush and looked at Tony for permission. He gave a nod and Steve started to paint.
Jarvis shipped the silk a few days later and Thor was ready. The rich silk was soft and fit the exact color of the scarf, just like Thor hoped it would do. Soon the scarf would like it was never torn in the first place.
They knew Tony didn’t sleep. Especially not in front of anyone. But here he was, sleeping peacefully. They all stared at his small body curled up into itself. He looked like a small black cat who was tired of spreading bad luck all the time. Tony looked years younger in his sleep, when their wasn’t something always on his mind.
“I’m trying to put you to bed, you genius.” Steve chucked. That caught him by surprise but at least Tony was trying to change. Tony gave out a small “oh” and leaned back into his pillows.
Steve felt the worst. His face fell. Guilt and regret plummeted in his stomach mixing into a giant blob. It was growing too fast and so hard to contain. Steve was his boyfriend but he didn’t know this. He didn’t even remember. Steve wasn’t there when Tony needed him. Tony was there when he had his accident. But It was like he never was there for Tony. Steve didn’t even know anything about Tony, like his gardening.
He sat down on the soft couch. The couch that Tony provided. It caused him to hate himself more. What would his mother think of him, yelling at his sick host!
“No, I’m sorry for being an ass boyfriend. I wasn’t there when you needed me. All these tears, my fault. I wasn’t there to pamper you or distract you or even talk to you about it. I did nothing.” Tony’s eyes began to water more. He nodded then surged into the mans arms, fast as ever.
“Trust me, you don’t want to meet my family.  Not when they were alive anyway.” Tony scoffed as he started to fold the scarf gently.
Steve kept his fist clasped together pushing the glass deeper into his skin. There wasn’t much pain, certainly not enough for him to actually show it on his face, but it was enough to bring him back to reality.
The blanket he stole from Tony one movie night where the brunette had slept on his shoulder popped up in the mess. Steve didn’t want it anymore, he didn’t need it. He once cherished that thing, despite it being old and smelling like coffee, only because it was Tony’s. It smelled like Tony. He never wanted to give it back. But he didn’t need it anymore just like Tony didn’t need him, didn’t care about him, didn’t even think about him.
“It’s not battle time, Captain, you can stand down.” Tony opened Steve’s right fist and saw the glass. He let out a soft gasp once looking at the small seeps of blood and began to cradle Steve’s hand, trying his best to hover over the bloody cracks of skin. “Well a bit of glass isn’t much damage, you’ll survive.”
Tony’s legs moved faster than his brain did, sinking towards the ground right next to Steve. He didn’t know what he was doing but he was doing it. He didn’t know why but he was. Tony’s heart raced faster as he took told of Steve hands, watching the blonds head raise up.
She wrapped the blanket tighter around her body and walked towards. Natasha didn’t have any type of weapon on her for once. Maybe she had gotten too comfortable in her new environment, but she didn’t feel threatened here. It was safe enough to call home. It was safe enough that she wasn’t scared of what’s ahead of her.
“Am I evil?” Tony whispered sleepily. His eyes were closed and breathing was steady for such a big question. Steve was suddenly alert; why would he ask such a thing?
Tony removed his hands and looked at Steve. His face was blood red, it was kinda funny, but a smile on there as well.
Tony shook the thought away as he ran faster. He needed to find something. A object or a person or an animal. He would even settle for the devil! Just so he wasn’t so utterly alone. Maybe if he ran fast enough, he would find something before they left. And they could figure this out together and escape or work out his punishment.
“I don’t want this. I don’t want you.” rang through Steve’s ears. He had no idea how he was still standing at this point with his legs going limp. His past feelings of bliss plummeted towards the ground and out of his body, right next to his feet. Then his heart followed suit, breaking once it hit the ground. A small pile of his feelings torn into two right by to Steve’s feet, torn so easily by eight words.
But he was here already. And making the journey back to his room- God he didn’t want to do it. He wouldn’t. Tony kicked at the door and held his breath, scared about what was to come.
Clint didn’t need those vibes. Those vibes could be deadly. He didn’t want his grave to say death by stress.
But he was going to wait up. Maybe not to see what Tony was worked up about but he sure as hell was going his hold his boyfriend as tight as he could once he laid eyes on the man.
“Tony you-“she sniffed, “ You need to get back to the tower now. Clint’s hurt bad. He’s in surgery right now but you need to get here. Now.” Natasha cried into the phone. She was painting her nails a nice pink hue, the name was something dusty but nail polish names were all weird, as she tried to find something to watch on T.V.
There were many cars to chose from but he needed something comfortable for all the yawning Tony was doing over the phone. Steve hopped in the Audi and raced out of the garage. He hoped that was comfortable.
“You don’t have to believe me, but it’s true.” Steve tilted Tony’s chin upwards to make eye contact, ”I’m sorry.”
Bruce knew where to get silks and sewing supplies. Bruce knew where to get everything, and he was always willing to help Thor. And if he didn’t help, Thor always found a way to mess up, even if he didn’t mean too.
“Beautiful huh? I like how your thinking.” Steve immediately rolled his eyes, chuckling as he pulled away.
“It was my mother’s you know. My Gramdma made it for her when she found out she was pregnant with me. I’ve only seen my grandmother a few times, every time we went to Italy. She was always sweet and we always picked flowers in her garden. This is all I had left. Of both of them.” Tony explained. He held the mended scarf as if it was his lifetime.
Then he could start his endless punishment. Get his whole life in hell settled before any major changes were made.
“Yes, Captain Rogers. How can I help you?” Steve didn’t think an A.I could sound so harsh. He felt like Jarvis was starring daggers at him. The British voice didn’t help his cause.
Natasha didnt know why Tony needed her to do that exactly, but she did know that line. That was the ‘get out of a date’ line. The one she used many times to get out her many many missions with Clint. Feelings of betrayal appeared in Nat heart, hurt that she wasn’t told anything about this date.
Tony was going to avoid him, that’s what he was good at. He could do this for days, Tony had the skills too along with the tools. A break away from Steve would do him great, maybe Tony would stop fantasizing about them together if he stopped seeing his face all the time. Maybe if his home was so Steve, Tony could walk around freely without fear of blushing like crazy when Steve was around or someone mentioned him. The lab could stop the idea of Steve swimming around in his brain.
Then he remembered, he was supposed to go home with Steve. Tony couldn’t handle being in a confined backseat with the blonde! He could call Steve a Uber or one of Peppers chafferers to pick him up.
“No need to apologize. It’s no problem, but how about we blow this joint? It’s getting a little stuffy in between talking about Avengers and stock markets.” Clint turned to set his glass down.
This was a paint room. A room with white wall that had cans of paint lined up and stacked across those walls. There were two canvases, one blank and one Tony Stark was working on.
“Thanks. For this I mean. Well you already know what I’m thanking you for. But you didn’t have to do all this, it looks brand new!”
“Okay come with me.” Thor followed Bruce towards his room. Bruce got him the needles and pins, all the necessary tools, except the silk. Thor needed to ask Jarvis to get him the right type, it was an old silk that they didn’t make anymore.
“You are very welcome. My mother taught me to sew when I was a child and I have grown very skilled in it. I am happy to be able to fix the scarf for you, anytime.”
“It’s okay, Tony, I know how busy you are” he simply replied, taking out his books from the locker and then closing it, turning to face the other boy, “Clint is kinda bummed about it, though” he added, smiling a bit, because the last thing he wanted was for Tony to think he was the one ‘bummed about it’.
“What do you mean ‘too’?” Tony’s question shocked Steve a little, because he really hadn’t thought about the implications hidden in that little word he had so stupidly added at the end of his sentence.
“There’s something I want to, er− I mean, there’s something I’ve always wanted to..” he tried, but, in that moment, words seemed something too far away to actually be reached, so Steve breathed once more, loudly, and then leaned closer to Tony, leaving no distance between their bodies, and finally, fucking finally
“Yeah, me too” Tony told him, and with that he turned around and started walking towards his house, that was now pretty close, since Steve had conveniently chose to stop right around the corner. He was tempted to stop him, but he was more afraid of Tony’s reaction if he had only tried to touch him again, and he wasn’t sure he’d be able to face another look at Tony’s hurt eyes without breaking. So Steve sighed, hating himself like he had never done before, and, when he felt the first tear fall down his cheek, he let all the others come down, sobbing loudly in the middle of the road, with the moon as his only companion.
“Sure” Steve simply replied, smiling fondly at Tony, now happy just because Tony was actually going to sit with him at lunch, just like he had used to, and who knew, maybe things were going to go back to normal, even if it was just for the last two weeks of school.
“I’m not jealous, I’ve got used to seeing him with everyone else but me” but it came out a little too harsh to actually be considered the truth, so Steve simply sighed and put a handful of fries in his mouth, trying not to look in Tony’s direction once again. Tony had been avoiding their table at lunch for more than a week, and Steve wasn’t the only one upset about it, since everyone else knew those were their last weeks of school together, hell, probably even their last weeks spent in the same town.
“Strange asked me out, you know” and really, did Tony have to punch Steve in the face just like that? Because it took all the strength in the world for Steve not to simply let his smile drop right after Tony’s words, and trying instead to pretend like he didn’t really care about that new information.
“Thank you, Thor!” exclaimed Carol, speaking like she was on stage, acting, and not eating lunch in the school’s canteen, “The voice of reason has spoken, my friends!” she added, making the rest of the table chuckle a little, except for Steve, of course, who was now too busy trying to steal glances at Tony’s table to actually focus on the conversations going on at his own.
“Because college will ruin it anyway, so it’s worth a try!” came Carol’s first comment on the issue, and Steve almost screamed, because his friends were so useless, and he had just finished the last of his fries and Tony was still laughing at something Strange had said and they were sitting so fucking close to each other and why the fuck wasn’t Tony having lunch with his best fucking friends?
“Bye, Tony” he whispered to himself, still staring at the point where Tony had disappeared, trying not to think about Tony and Strange skipping class together, going who-knows-where to do who-knows-what. School was ending, and instead of trying to spend more time with Tony, Steve was only witnessing his best friend having the time of his life with anyone but him. And really, Steve knew it wasn’t Tony’s fault, he just wished they were still as close as they had been for the previous three years and a half, because he missed always having Tony around and being able to spend all his days hearing about his crazy stories and his latest projects. But maybe that was for the best, maybe Tony was doing it on purpose, because he knew just how hard it was going to be to part from all his friends once summer ended. Yeah, that was probably it, the boy was smart, smarter than anyone Steve knew, so it made sense that he was already thinking about the future, and who knew, maybe he was even doing it for Steve too, because he had found out about his little crush and didn’t want Steve to make things awkward between them. But, well, knowing, or at least thinking of knowing why Tony was doing that didn’t really change a thing, and Steve still missed him dearly, even though he was seeing him everyday right before school and, occasionally, during lunch break.
Steve looked back towards the team. Then back at Tony. “What do I do?” repeated in his mind, “Oh what do I do” He continued to lightly shake Tony, until he popped up real fast. The whiplash could have knocked Steve out.
The man pushed himself towards the wall to have something to ground him. Tony’s eyes began to water as he held his stomach; he couldn’t stop shaking.
“Don’t even get me started, Nat. All they do is talk about their pet. The cat’s not on the damn date. I don’t want to hear about your cat, I want to hear about you! And then he gets drunk and start hanging on me like where about to go to his place and have a one night stand and shit! We’re at fucking lunch!  I swear to god he didn’t even ask one single question about me.” Tony said all in one go. He was visibly upset, waving his hands and his eyebrows crossed. “I’m telling you, it was terrible.”
Tony was by his desk when Steve walked in. The bandages were gone but the scars- they weren’t going away anytime soon. It didn’t make him ugly, no it just added to his attractiveness. But Steve wasn’t going to fall for his rugged face today.
“No!” Tony said harshly. He wrapped the blanket closer to himself and seemed even more distant to Steve than when he was outside that door.
Natasha didn’t think Tony would even have time for stars. With his busy life and his recent visit, Tony shouldn’t even have this room. But here he was, staring doubtfully at the tiny balls of gas.
“Your not evil Tony. What else did I do?” Steve asked as he sat up in the bed. But the man was already asleep. What else did he do! What if he tore Tony down or kicked him off the team or said that he didn’t love Tony? What if Dream Steve ruin a whole entire relationship? For all Steve knew the relationship was over because Tony believed any negative thing he thought of himself.
Steve was aggressive, causing Tony to flinch, but he stood his ground. The blonde wasn’t going to miss out on this life that he missed with Peggy. He wasn’t going to miss out on his last chance at love because he was too scared to try.
“Oh Senator Tidal, glad to see you here. Quite a fine party, don’t you think?” Clint engaged as he held Tony’s shoulder. He could feel Tony’s muscles relax and the  air finally returning to his lungs again.
“I’m going to a press conference for 3 days in Australia. But I’ll call you every morning and night, okay.” Tony rushed. The news was delivered to Steve on the exact same day he was due to leave. Steve was little more than shocked, but accepted the quick kiss Tony gave him in the cheek and watched him hop into the car.
Tony walked out after a while dressed in a grey tracksuit with black sunglasses. His hair was slicked back, wether it be by water or gel. He looked great.
“You need to be there for every fight, just like the rest of us. If you can’t even show up, why are you even in the team? “
“Steve knows singers? You must mean the ones who created this song cause Steve knows absolutely nothing about today’s music. Those people are long gone, Thor.” Tony explained.
“Aw, Mr. Stark, just the man I wanted to see. Along with Mr. Barton no less.” The skinny jolly man said as he came over. A small chucked escaped his mouth.
After a while, he was ready to set his apology plan a go. Steve just wished Tony would let him say sorry and not kick him out. He took a deep breath before knocking on the door.
No, he wasn’t going to chew him out, he just wanted an explanation. Some good reason why he wasn’t there! If Tony didn’t provide, then he was going to chew him out.
They entered a hotel room, with two twin sized beds and luxurious windows, only the best for Tony Stark.
“Now I’m going crazy.” Steve mumbled as he laid back down in the bed. They could figure it out in the morning, both of them. They would have an adult conversation and then go to breakfast. Steve didn’t need to worry about it, Tony clearly wasn’t.
Tony didn’t last the day. Steve had stormed in there with a nervous look on his face. Tony didn’t know what to do and what he did, if he did anything at all.
It was going to be okay. Steve knew Tony wasn’t going to stop risking his life but at least he won’t be doing it so often. That was good enough for Steve. He could survive with that. And now at least Steve could keep the blanket.
Clint was shocked at this. Tony Stark, freaking out at a party, his once favorite scene. It didn’t make sense, but at last it was happening. He didn’t quite understand it but Clint could at least help calm Tony down.
“You didn’t have to tell everybody.” He mumbled under his breath. Natashas eyes widened as she whispered a small ‘sorry’. The conversation left Tony’s love life and onto something else, but Tony was still left uncomfortable especially next to Steve. The perfect Steve who had a freckle above his right eye and a too sharp jawline with striking blue eyes. The man who couldn’t like Tony that was always reeking of motor oil and had too many scars to count. The Tony that glowed blue like a freak and had bags under his eyes. He sighed in defeat, knowing he could never measure up to Steve.
“Ok, then where are we going to hang this up?” Steve snatched the canvas and looked around, “Everyone needs to see this! We should post it on social media or something! Maybe have a press conference!”
“We’re making Anthony breakfast and you can ice the rolls of cinnamon!” Thor said loudly with a smile. Natasha shushed him.
“Calm down. I’m fine Steve, look at me. I’m alive. I’m right here!” Tony gripped Steve shoulders, forcing him to look at him in the eye.
“Yeah we do.” The Captains tone was now  serious like a rock, so different than the smooth loving honey it just was. “You go first.“
They broke apart, and stared into the others eyes. Tony wondered how long they would be doing that in their lives, just staring at the other. Living with the other. Tony wanted to do that forever.
“I’m on my way.” Natasha heard, “I have to go. Family emergency, you know. I’ll call you a Uber, thanks for the date.”  The call ended.
He didn’t change much to the painting but adding more color to the grass and stores around the park. It made it more poppy and had a better balance. Wasn’t that helpful but Tony looked at him like he just changed the world. His brown eyes shone towards Steve.
“I had too, Steve. It’s our job. We’re the Avengers. That family could have died and Clint was down there too! I wasn’t going to let that happen.”
Tony must have not been hearing right. Perfect Steve did not just come here and ask him out! He couldn’t have. Tony was Tony and Steve was Steve, it wasn’t Tony and Steve. It would never be Tony and Steve.
“I’m a mess, Steve, like why do people even deal with me? I’m not even suppossedd to be drinking.” He slurred. The mans face scrunched up, showing his true age, as he tried to wipe the tears away.
They would be disgustingly happy in front of their team mates. They would be getting their morning coffee and starting the day. They couldn’t even do that together. It was night in Australia, while it was morning in New York. Another thing that was keeping them apart.
The phone buzzed again in his hand, this time a text from Pepper. Steve must have been missing something.
“How is this my fault? You kissed back!” The blond suddenly grew angry, now standing as well. That kiss was everything and now Tony was acting like it was the worse thing to happen. But it couldn’t be, that was all Steve wanted. It felt like Tony wanted it too.
“Thor! Don’t creep up on me like that, I have a heart condition you know!” Tony jumped. He slowly took off his headphones as Thor gave an apologetic smile.
Thor could hear it. A beautiful voice, a voice that sounded as if honey was dripping down their throat just so every note could sound perfectly once leaving the mouth. It was just beautiful, so very soft and tiny that many wouldn’t hear. But it was very worth hearing and it made him want to sway. It brought a smile to Thor’s face as looked around.
“Are you blushing?” The sleepy voice teased. It wasn’t hoarse or squeaky but sounded as smooth as honey. Tony could feel the mans breath against his skin, how warm it was. Gosh this man made his tongue tie and his stomach fill with butterflies; he was off the rails.
Tony has been working hard to stop being so down on himself these last two weeks. He didn’t think he was pure evil anymore, before he had that dream. He allowed himself some leverage and some time to himself. He had actually been trying for Steve. Even Pepper and Rhodey has noticed how happy he had been than usual.
”I like your laugh. You don’t have to say anything.” They we’re close enough to share a breath, close enough to connect lips. Tony was right in between his legs so that Steve could wrap his arms around his waist.
“Are you ok?” She asked. The women knew he wasn’t, but she needed him to say it. If he said it, he would believe it. He would actually come open about the deeper reason he was in this room. And as to why he kept it hidden.
“You’re shaking. What happened?” Steve asked glancing back. Tony looked like he was going to pass out as sweat shone on his face. His hands were shaking slightly as he tried to get comfortable.
“No! Everything’s okay, I promise, just calm down.” Tony interrupted, almost yelling through the phone. The mans voice sounded hoarse like he had just been screaming, or worse, crying!
“Just don’t shut me out, okay?” Steve looked back at him. Tony nodded. He didn’t know if he could do that, he had to many issues that he needed to keep hidden, but he could try. Tony could always try.
Of course Tony had this room, for the one night stands he was famous for. The life everyone knew about before Tony had cleaned up his act about a year ago. Steve had actually read a few of them and worried that he wouldn’t be enough for the infamous Tony Stark. This man had seen everyone and been with everyone. He was an experienced lover. Steve was not. If he was given just a night with Tony in the room, Steve would cherish it for the rest of his life. He wouldn’t ask for any more or tempt his faith. That would be enough.
“We should have a contest. See whoever knows the most about Stark.” Clint suggested one movie night when Tony wasn’t present. But he was never there anyway.
Tony stumbled out of the bed, getting tied up in the sheets, as he raced towards the door. He bumped and tripped on things in his messy room, but he couldn’t feel the pain. All he felt was was someone squeezing at his chest and stomping on his heart. He needed out of that room to breathe. Tony pulled the door open and threw himself out onto the floor. It was cold, a totally difference than how that room was suffocating him.
Thor walked towards the voice making sure he walked softy as not to disturb. The closer he got the more clear the voice became adding to its beauty.
Once on the ride there Pepper explained what they needed to do. It was quite simple, just stay together and put in a good word for the Avengers Initiative. All she kept saying is how simple this gala was supposed to be.
The only times that they would talk would be at the end and beginning of each day. Steve didn’t like waiting that long- Steve wanted Tony right here in his arms, right here in the bed where he could hear Tony’s breathing.
“I don’t want this. I don’t want you.” Tony said sternly. Even as he said it, the lump in his throat became harder to swallow down, he knew he didn’t mean it. He knew he was lying to himself. It wasn’t true and it would never be true.
“Yeah, but I want to.” Steve took off Tony’s joggers and then started to undress himself. Once naked, he lowered himself into big tub, Tony still on the counter. Steve called him over and Tony clearly didn’t want to come. But the man hopped off the counter, finished undressing himself, and lowered himself into the tub, sitting on the other side. Steve watched as he made sure the reactor was a once the water. Their legs were touching under the bubbles and their arms long enough for their hands to touch.
“Everything fine, Stark. I’m sure Pepper and Happy are close, just calm down. And my suit is fine.” Clint assured. Tony only nodded at him and went back to pacing.
“What did you want to say?” Steve asked so very softly. God Tony loved this man. He had barely freaked out, went through an emotional nightmare involving the man that ended up in his bed but Steve just pushed it aside.
Those weeks they spent together getting to know each other meant everything to him. Even more than his time spent with Peggy, although he will always value that. But to Tony, those weeks meant nothing.
To his surprise, Tony began to kiss back passionately. It was a jolt of energy against Steve’s steady path around Tony’s lips but felt good. They explored each other’s mouths as they shared a breath, oblivious to the world. Steve dipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth and heard a moan form the man. He wanted more but this was enough.
Steve smiles back and thought it was a great idea. Give them all a chance to actually talk to Tony. To actually do something with him. Or see his smile or see his eyes glimmer. To notice if he had dimples are not. Or- no, Steve shook his head. He couldn’t be thinking like that right now.
“Oh your so strong, Steve, did you know that?” Tony slowly said as his eyes started to fluttered to sleep.
“But they have their songs to keep them alive, I guess. Just like you have your tech and screens to keep your name alive. But I would need you to teach me more about these people that are long gone.”
“Thanks for helping me out back there. Sorry I froze.” He said quietly, and if Clint wasn’t trained to hear it he wouldn’t have. That was something else about Tony. In the media, he’s loud and brass but in real life, he’s quiet.
“Why can’t you look at me?” Steve starred at Tony, face full of disappointment. He had been in there for days, days holding Tony’s hand, waiting for the other man to wake up. Just waiting for him to make any movement; to show that he was still there, still alive. “What’s wrong?”
“Yeah the bed’s made, Im waiting to mess up the room where your here to bitch about it. Can’t wait for the screaming match.” Steve could hear Tony’s laughter but it was tired, the man must have had a long day. Steve felt guilty for keeping him up, Tony never got any sleep anyway, but he didn’t want to hang up and wait all day to hear Tony’s voice again. Steve knew he was being selfish but he didn’t care. “How was your day?”
“How’d ya get here so fast, Cap? Got wings I don’t know about? ” Tony slurred as he leaned onto Steve’s shoulder. To yes hair was messed up and going all type of ways. His shirt was wrinkled along with most of his suits
That was 2 days ago. 2 days of a very lonely sleep and very lonely days and Steve being a very lonely person.
Maybe that moment could start a relationship, Steve thought. He just needed to work on his flirting. And he had time to do that. He could also practice on trying to make tony red again too. It’ll all come together later, but now he could wait.
“So Rhodey and Pepper were telling the truth?” Tony’s face turned red immediately and he couldn’t stop it from growing. He looked down at his hands trying to find something to do with them. The man didn’t like being the center of attention, at least not now where everyone in the room wanted to know.
“At the battle, Stark! The one you couldn’t come to. The one where Clint broke his ankle because you weren’t there to watch his back. If your going to be on this team, you need to be there for all the battles, not just the major ones. And you where in here sleeping, all the while! I can’t believe you! People could have died because you weren’t there! But you were sleeping. Sleeping! ” Steve yelled. He felt the urged to pace and really chew Tony out.
“Take your blanket. And the painting too if you want it,” Tony’s eyes turned bloodshot and actually hurt, “ I don’t need them anymore.”
“What shall we do?” Thor asked quietly. But it still caused Tony to move and his brows to cease. They all were still until he returned back to his stance.
All Steve would do was sit there and wait till Tony was ready. He would listen to every heartbreaking sob that tore at his heart before he left this couch. He will wait to see that last year fall down Tony’s face before he left.
Steve was peacefully sleeping when he heard a rattle at his door. The man so very comfortable under the comforter turned towards his clock; 3:00 am. Who the hell was at his door at three in the morning?
Steve had broken his iPad for the third time this month. The screen was severally cracked and frozen, that this time he thought he broke it for good. So now he was trying to find Tony to fix it. And maybe get up on the score board, but who knows? They were all tied at the moment with 2 points each, after deciding to share one. His second point wasn’t one he was proud of and he needed to make it up, to himself, the team, and to Tony.
Tony didn’t answer but instead started to tracing Steve’s hand, wanting to remember the detail- every muscle, every hair, every wrinkle, how it felt.
“No, your open. You don’t hide behind walls or push everyone out. Your funny and cute and I want that. Not you being drunk, but you. Why can’t you see that.” Steve asked moving closer to Tony.
“Umm hey, is there anything wrong? You know you can tell me right.” Steve asked, phone still in hand.
Once given the tour, Tony had disappeared from sight. They never saw him eat, sleep or just chill. Catching a glance of him through the day was rare.
Thor spent hours sewing the scarf making sure that every thread was connected and not messy. The tips of his fingers become numb to the many needles he poked himself with, but it was worth it. Tony would forgive him and this whole situation would be swept under the rug. Thor wouldn’t have to deal with the fake “it’s okays” when passing Tony or the growing guilt.
He rode the elevator to Tony’s floor. The Captain has never been here before. He had only been in Tony’s room at the main floor, which was used when Tony was too lazy to make it to his floor after long lab binges. That room was kinda messy and didn’t have much of what makes up a room. It was more of a living room with a bed plopped in the middle of it.
So now he was crying. And trying his best to stop crying. It was ironic. Tony’s whole life was ironic!
Then Steve connected his hand to Tony’s check, wiping the tears away. And his eyes were soft and trusting.
“Umm- I will be, I guess.” Tony spoke. He stopped looking outside but instead at their hands intertwined.
Tony had always been a flirt but this was different. Anyone that he ever kissed will say he was amazing but with Steve . . . Tony wanted to give it his best. He was never supposed to kiss Steve, he knew it, but it was too hard to resist. Tony had been wanting to do that since forever.
It wasn’t enough, Steve thought, thanks for trying but it wasn’t enough. He would need a hundred of those tiny shots to actually feel something. Steve wished he was drunk right now, to not feel this pain. He wished he could tell the bartender to give the whole bottle. But he couldn’t. Steve would look like an alcoholic in front of everybody at the gala. Like he hadn’t looked at an idiot enough?
Family emergency? Natasha heart squeezed at the realization as the betrayal sizzled out. It gave her an extra pep in her step when she went into the kitchen just thinking of all the different ways she could tease Tony. All she could do now was wait.
Steve felt lost. It was hard enough to navigate what Tony was thinking all the time but now he felt lost at sea. On a little raft. Without anything to help him find land. Finding land would be a lost cause just like understanding what was going on in Tony’s head of his. But it was worth the try, Steve loved him too much to give up.
“I’m a mess aren’t I?” Tony let out a small laugh filled with sorrow. It was kinda hysterical, in a messed up kinda way, the last words of a very broken person.
Pepper said to look after Tony. Rhodey said to look after Tony. Even Jarvis said it in his vague words. Now Steve knew why. Tremors were overtaking his small body, chin trembling as tears flowed down his face. Tony looked so broken on that couch.
The room was a bit big for the small man. The neutral colors didn’t seem like the Tony Steve knew. There was a couch, a mini fridge and a coffee machine. That must be the reason Tony could survive in here for a couple of days.
He jogged to a stop behind the blood, giving a tiny smile. The man was wearing normal attire, jeans and a t-shirt, probably one too tight for his own good. The man looked beautiful, even in his everyday attire.
Tony wiped his face quickly and started to pick up the pieces of his dignity left on the floor. He was going to call Happy and go home.
“I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but it was never supposed to come to this.” Tony started to run his hand in his hair, never looking at Steve. He was dealing out badly, and Steve had never seen him like this.
His joints screamed at him to stop as Tony pushed himself up. The tears were still running down his face but he wasn’t sobbing anymore. He could be ok.
The starlight from the previous room shone on the floor. Nat studied the lines of where one wood ended and the other started. Then she noticed a tiny piece, much smaller than the others. The women crawled over and pressed on the block.
He didn’t know the importance of the scarf, but from the look on Tony’s face, it like his world was ending. Thor has just ripped his world into two.
She made popcorn, drank threw a box of Capri Suns that her childish teammates bought, and was tempted to making cookies as well. Just to keep herself busy so that she wouldn’t miss Tony when he came in.
The man was wearing a classic black tuxedo and his hair slicked back. The smile plastered on his face showed Clint he was a bit too happy to be there. So either it was faked or he was really really really excited over something simple. This man wasn’t intimidating despite his job label and his height.
He turned the corner into the living room, and found the voice! He saw Tony with headphones on, singing!
Tony had somehow slipped by his side, which shouldn’t had happened, but Clint was a bit off edge at the moment.
“You can tell me anything, you know.” But Steve didn’t get an answer and continued to drive. He heard the slight snores and sighed in defeat. He could talk to Tony about this later, when he was going to be able to remember it not when he would be too drunk to even remember his drinking.
Steve fell asleep looking at the man, absently wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist bringing him closer. It was nice. Nice to forget about what had all just happened.
“I’m coming, I’m coming.” Croaked a hoarse voice. The captain didn’t detect it, blind with his rising anger.
Steve crashed his lips onto Tony’s, as if he was reaching for air. It wasn’t rough or fast, just hungry. It would be his last act of defiance against the universe. He promised.
Tony let out a sigh, a good release that clearly affected his body, Steve hearing shuffling around through the speakers.
“Do you know what you’re like when you’re drunk?” Tony didn’t expect that question, but it was he heard before.
“Don’t be nervous, you can come closer.” Steve suggested. Tony scooted close enough that Steve could wrap his arm around his body and pull him closer. He wanted to do so, so badly, but it wasn’t the time.
The next morning Steve was awaken by Tony’s moving the covers, letting the coldness reach their bodies.
Steve didn’t quite know how to respond to that, so he didn’t. Just how did he know? What didn’t Steve know? Why did he know?
“The way I feel when I’m with you” Steve had said. Tony wondered what he was going to say. Steve couldn’t have actually wanted to be with him, but what if he said was something good. Something to make Tony’s heart beat faster or swell with warmth? Maybe Steve had actually meant that kiss? Maybe Steve actually wanted to be with him?
“Umm . . . Why didn’t you tell Tony about the battle?” He rumbled the back of his neck in embarrassment.
“No you don’t. Going out leads to dates which leads to a relationship. And you don’t want that with me.” Tony brushes off gently as he went back to work. He wasn’t going to give into false hope although his heart fluttered at the idea.
It was different than the press smiles, that one more forced and never fully reached his eyes. This one was softer, and actually made his eyes crinkle at the corners, it took years off his face. But really it was just genuine, something that’s hard to get out of Tony Stark.
