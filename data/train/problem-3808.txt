Pulling back, Dean saw the flicker of doubt cross Cas’s features from his silence. Instead of letting it grow, Dean reached up to take Cas’s face in his hands, the kiss the gentlest he had ever given. When they tilted away again, the shine was back in Cas’s eyes. Dean couldn’t help but smile as he wiped the stain of tears away from his own face. Cas reached up to take his hand, twining their fingers together. A few years ago, it would have felt odd holding hands but now, all it did was make Dean’s heart beat more loudly.  They exchanged smiles and stole glances as they walked to the Impala outside. When they reached the passenger door, Dean pushed Cas against the cool metal, searching his eyes.
“There’s a diner just up the road. Is that good enough?” Dean asked and when Cas gave a nod, they slowly made their way. “I didn’t mean to poke fun at your name earlier."
Dean gave a faint nod, not really grasping the words until Eileen reached forward and touched his arm.
Dean felt the intensity from Cas’ gaze and turned towards him again. They sat together for a beat in silence, the stillness of the night peaceful, allowing Dean’s nerves to settle so he could finish saying what he started.
“Thank you, Chief,” Dean said, smiling at the older man who had been a second Father to him. “For everything, not just this.”
Dean tilted his head back and laughed. “Yeah, I kinda hated you that night. Hated the thought of you. Hated you before I even knew you. You gotta admit you were an ass back then.”
Besides, I wouldn’t be destroying my Grace. We would keep it hidden somewhere safe in case a need ever surfaced,” Cas said, choosing his words carefully. “But I would like to share the rest of my life with you. If you’ll have me.”
When they were back on the road towards the bunker, miles of road separating them from home, Dean took a deep breath and let his heart settle. Sam was safe at home, the woman he loved in his arms. Bobby, Jody, Donna and Charlie were alive. Even his parents were at peace. He and Sam were free. A lifetime of pain and misery, anger, confusion, and choices that had left them with battle scars unable to heal. But now, that chapter had closed. Now, they were finally free.
“I know this is weird to ask a total stranger,” Dean started and motioned behind his shoulder. “Do you mind pretending to be my date for a minute? Stalker alert.”
“I think it may be a late one tonight,” Cas spoke in the phone. “No, I’m busy at work. Don’t think I’ll be home until late. Don't wait up.”
His words trailed off and he pushed away from the table, moving quietly to the opposite side. Burying his hands in his pockets, he fell against the wall, the light from outside reaching his feet.
“Like how blue their eyes are or how the loose strands of hair keep falling into their face, making you want to run your hands through it,” Dean said, swallowing against the sudden thickness in his voice.
What he wanted was to reach out and pull Cas against him, to lose himself in those Blue Eyes, feel the touch of his lips and a strong embrace around him. He wanted so much so quickly that it scared Dean back a step. Before Cas could extract himself and free their hands, Dean’s eyes caught sight of an eyelash. Swallowing hard, he reached up with a slightly shaky hand and pulled the lash from Cas’ cheek.
Dean smirked and Cas was quickly on him. The kiss was all tongue and teeth, bruising their lips red. Moving backwards blindly, Dean stumbled into the bedroom that was no longer only his. With the door being locked behind them, to rule out any form of interruption, Cas yanked off his trenchcoat and tossed it to the chair beside them. Dean was on his back, moving towards the pillows when Cas climbed over and covered his body. Looking up into those blue eyes, Dean understood the importance of this second chance. He understood the significance of the choice he had made and at the end of it all, he had chosen happiness. Their lips pressed together, a promise between them. After years clouded by anguish, Dean felt the weight of choosing to love Cas and accepting that love in return, deep in his chest and all the way through to his soul. The ache he had felt inside him for so long was finally gone.
Closing his eyes, Dean let his head fall backwards with a dull thump. A single tear slipped down his cheek, falling off at the tip of his chin. He raised his hand to wipe the wetness away but instead, his fingers reached across and covered the handprint over his shoulder. With a silent gasp, he screwed his eyes shut even tighter, the pain inside his heart growing.
“Douchebags,” she commented with a shake of her head. “They’re the kind that will use you for their own pleasure and then toss you aside.”
,” he said, reaching a hand up to rub the back of his neck. “When Lucifer stabbed you, it killed me, Cas. It killed me like it's killing me now.”
Cas tilted his body towards Dean but stayed quiet, giving him the space to voice what he needed to say.
“Yes, I know it is and I loved the sweater you gave me and the beautiful chocolate cake,” Castiel replied, smiling warmly at his daughter.
bed. Safe and warm in their bedroom, sheets tangled around their bodies where all they could feel was each other and nothing else. Their first time together deserved more than a fumbling in the dark. He wanted to take his time and map out every curve of Cas’ body, to feel Cas against him, inside him. When years ago, the thought of being with another man would have made Dean run, with Cas, everything was different. None of those misgivings mattered, not after everything they had been through and all the times they had died and come back. This was their chance at the truest form of happiness, a chance to submit themselves to a connection that not even the Heavenly Order or Lucifer could shatter.
Dean reached for the photo he took of the three of them in the hospital the day Harry was born off the mantle and handed it to her.
“You have to be gentle with Miracle now, Harry. He’s getting a bit older, so he can’t do everything he used to anymore. Do you understand?”
Harry wiggled out of Cas’s arms and flopped onto the sand, but quickly righted himself the way only a young child could do.
All heads snapped up. No one moved for a second while they processed the information but then they jumped to action, leaning over the edge of the boat to scan the water for signs of him.
“A lot of hearing parents teach their children sign language. They can pick it up quicker than spoken language at this age. And, of course, it will be useful for Eileen when he’s older. Oh, crap,”
Dean sank to the floor, the phantom ache of the rebar still present. “You should have let me die. I can’t live without Cas anymore.” A single tear rolled down his cheek.
“Nothing yet,” he sighs. “Louis’s keeping an eye on the Charleston place, but it’s been empty for weeks. Duncan’s got a cousin in Aberdeen watching that place. Javier’s been listening for chatter on the witch grapevine, but it’s radio silence.”
Their mouths fit together so perfectly it felt like they’d been designed just for this. Dean didn’t know why he’d expected Cas to be shy about this; he’d seen Cas kiss before and the guy was
“Oh yeah, lots of human experiences at college. When you’re older I’ll tell you what Sammy got up to with a watermelon at Stanford.”
His eyes scanned the personnel. Charlie had texted to say she was here, but all he could see was a man in incredible tight leather pants and no shirt talking to a drag queen wearing an elaborate purple wig and silver sequin dress.
The others took bites of their burgers. They all agreed they were delicious. They chatted pleasantly and drank beer for the rest of the evening. Dean managed to avoid addressing any of his comments directly as Cas and Cas did the same. Just hearing his voice was almost too much for Dean.
The next morning, Cas and Dean spent a long morning lounging in bed, trading slow, salacious kisses, in no rush to start the day, but eventually Dean’s stomach informed them it was time to get up.
Sam thinks for a moment before snapping his fingers. “Yeah, I think I know a guy. Everett. Runs a shop up in Seattle. I’ll give him a call, see if he can get it. What about that?” He points to the next one down.
“Yeah, well, this baby has never tried to convince me to get a cat even though it knows I’m allergic,” Dean shot back at him.
Dean took his hand and dragged him to the living room, then lightly pushed him so he fell back onto the couch.
Dean’s voice in his head jolts him back to reality. “Right, yes. It’s about the same size as a buttercup, similar shape too, but is a soft purple shade, almost like a sunset.”
“Jeez, Cas. You can’t drop a speech like that with no warning. You’ve got a bad habit of doing that, you know?” He laughed humorlessly. Cas laughed with him. “What if I get hurt? You won’t be able to heal me anymore.”
Cas stared intently into Dean's eyes. Dean took his hand that wasn't holding Cas’s and cupped his jaw.
“We’ll have a few other things to sort, too. Gotta get you some food, some clothes, a toothbrush, start buying more toilet paper. Let’s get everything ready first. Don’t want to just drop you in it this time.”
Winchester. These are the dumbest middle names.” Sam gave Dean a look of disdain. “This says you’re two years younger than you are.”
Sam frantically waved his hands in front of his face. “Actually, scrap that. I don’t want to know. I never want to hear about your sex life again.”
“Don’t tell me you’re one of those people that’s all ‘video games cause violence’?” he mocked. “‘Cause, spoiler alert, Cas, he’s already killed before. Hell, everyone at this table is a serial killer. Except for Harry, but he’s got time to work on that.”
Cas found a top with a picture of a sheep on it that he liked. He walked over to a nearby shop assistant.
“Go to the mall, buy yourself some clothes and essentials. I’ll make you a list, a ‘How To Be Human 101’, then when everything’s ready, we’ll do it. Okay?”
Cas eagerly takes the book and runs his eyes across the page. By the second line, he is grinning widely. “Yes, this is it! This is the spell she used! Is there a countersp— Yes!”
Once they were close enough, Sam shucked off his own life jacket and dived headfirst into the water, ignoring the saltwater filling his mouth, and swam until he was close enough to grab him.
. For the first few billion years of existence, I believed in God's way, following the divine path. But that wasn’t really
Sam brought Cas into a friendly hug, careful not to cut his coat with the knife. He patted him twice on the back and pulled back. “It’s great to have you back, buddy. Right, Dean?”
Cas sighs. He tabs the page and closes it then crosses the room to switch off the light. “Fine. But no cats.”
Dean’s stumbling was obviously too slow for Cas’s liking because he grabbed Dean by the collar and chucked him across the backseat.
Don considered it. “Alright. Be here Monday, 9 o’clock sharp, and if you impress me, you’ve got the job.”
They smile at each other. Dean’s not sure which of them moves first but their lips are suddenly pressed together. He feels Cas’s arms wrap around him to cup his waist and the back of his head, their knees knocking together.
Dean considered it for a second, then shrugged. “Okay, so maybe I did. It’s not that different from you and Eileen. You called her honey bear once.”
“Cas? What? How?” Sam had entered the barn, his own machete raised, but he lowered it upon seeing Cas through the darkness.
“So, at what point did you realize these dinners were not as platonic as you thought?” Sam inquired, equally engrossed as his wife.
Dean stretches one arm forwards and walks jaggedly toward Sam, vaguely away that he kind of looks like a zombie right now. Just as he makes it to his brother, Sam nips out of the door.
When Cas didn’t reply, he headed further into the house to find him. It didn’t take long before he could hear Cas’s voice in the kitchen, so he made his way over. Cas was leaning on the counter, still in his work shirt but with the sleeve rolled up to his elbows, and had his phone pressed between his ear and his shoulder while he stirred a pot on the stove.
After twelve blissful hours of silence, Sam pulls into the bunker’s garage, his limbs stiff from sitting for so long and his stomach rumbling. He flicks open the pocket knife he keeps in his back pocket and walks around to the other side of the car.
“Oh, you mean your increasingly incoherent messages, the last of which read, ‘I gay. Yay Taylor Swift’?”
Sam glanced around to check none of the other diners had heard that and was met with a very disapproving glare from an elderly woman at the next table.
Dean picks up a small piece of amethyst from a display in the middle of the shop and twirls it around his fingers a few times before poking the pointy spikes, reveling in how it doesn’t hurt at all.
Sam didn’t spend much time in the bunker anymore. He was always out on dates with Eileen, doing, in Dean’s words, ‘new wave hippie shit’, like yoga and jogging. Miracle didn’t seem to mind all the walks he got to go on, though. When he was home, Eileen was almost always with him. Dean found her in the kitchen one morning wearing one of Sam’s shirts like a dress, making pancakes. He couldn’t resist making a whole bunch of innuendos. Eileen just chucked a load back at him. He was really starting to like her.
“Can someone get that?” he yelled to the house and covered his ears. He could just about hear Cas’s thundering footsteps walking to the door.
He turns his head to see Sam lying prone on the floor, the spell pinning him to the wall broken upon its caster's death. A trickle of blood runs down his face from a wound at the top of his head.
“Abilities. Every angel gave him something different. Gabriel gave him the power to rise from the dead. Balthazar, the power to heal the sick.”
Sam stammered, struggling to find the best words to appease this young girl with pure admiration on her face. “Uh, Cas has always been like this, so we’re just… used to it.” And failing.
Dean looked back at Harrison. He could hardly remember when Sam was that small. Harrison yawned and opened his eyes, which Dean was surprised to see were the exact same shade as Sam’s. He wiggled an arm free of the blankets and waved it in the air. Dean tickled his tiny hand with his finger.
“If she’s a Guaire, she could have gone back to the family headquarters. I think they have a base in Charleston, or there’s the old ancestral home outside Aberdeen.”
Cas manages to lower his voice to a slightly more reasonable register. “That will just make me quiet. Dean will still be able to speak in my head.”
Jack had finally noticed the flush fading from Dean’s cheeks, his breathing getting harsher. He rushed to Dean’s side and checked his wound. His hand came back covered in blood.
Dean got his wallet out of his back pocket, secretly thrilled to have been asked. It had been a long time. He stepped forward and held his ID up to her face.
“Well, you spent $500 on car parts last month, so I can spend a few dollars on ice cream if I want to.”
“It would appear,” Cas starts slowly, trying to hold off the litany of curse words Dean is spewing, “that Dean has gained some element of control over my vessel.”
“As long as they don’t get as friendly as Linda from HR at your old place. How many times did she invite you out for dinner?”
She grabbed him by the arm and dragged him with surprising speed, given her footwear, towards the door.
“Oh, no, we’ve never met, but I’m a huge fan! I drove all the way out to Phoenix to listen to your TED talk on Neolithic cave drawings. It was amazing!”
Dean slung his arm over Cas’s shoulders and followed Jack and Zehra towards the parking lot, overhearing their very animated conversation about the latest TikTok dance trend. “Me neither, babe.”
The drive to the café had been down a particularly muddy lane, so Baby was a bit of a mess. He changed into his car-cleaning shorts, thankful for the unseasonably warm weather, and filled a bucket in the kitchen sink.
“So uh, if you don't mind my asking…” Becky hedged. “Cas told you he loved you and now you’re living together. Are you two…?” She trailed off suggestively.
Cas looked very uncomfortable with the idea of Becky being a voyeur on one of his most vulnerable moments.
She sits up in her chair and sets her drinks down on a side table. “Witches talk. And the latest chatter is the Winchester brothers are looking for me. Thanks for sending your little friend after me, by the way. He made a wonderful sacrifice. Very nice bones.”
“My wings are not perceivable on this plane of existence, and to see them in their true form would destroy your eyes.”
“My Latin isn’t fluent, and Google Translate wasn’t helpful, but I recognize some of the words. Angel, and grace, here. This helpful?”
Dean woke to a pounding in his head. He tried to pull the pillow out from under his head to cover his ears, but it did nothing to help. Wait. He didn’t recognize that pillow.
Cas grunted as sleepily as a being that doesn’t sleep could and kept kissing his way across Dean’s chest.
Dean had a lot of free time on his hands now he wasn’t hunting, so he made Cas watch all of his favorite cowboy movies. Cas, in turn, made Dean watch the How To Train Your Dragon series. Dean would never admit it, but he definitely preferred the latter. That dragon was adorable, okay? They watched all of their movies together on the sofa in the Dean Cave. Sometimes Cas leaned his head on Dean’s shoulder, other times Dean had his feet in Cas’s lap, but they were always touching in some way.
The inside wasn’t quite what he was expecting; it looked like a regular nightclub, not that he’d been to too many of those. Dive bars were more his thing. It was nearly identical to his favorite bar downtown except for the rainbow patterned accessories scattered around the place. Nothing too major, just a rainbow straw here or there and the seven stools at the bar that were each a different color.
“When that became the best way to describe the absolutely besotted look on his face. I’ve never seen anyone look like that. What did you
Sam finds it hard to tell which one of them spoke; both of their voices were raised several octaves.
He could just about make out Cas nodding, so he settled his head on Cas’s chest, and curled into his side. Cas tentatively placed one hand on Dean's hip and the other in his hair.
Dean shuddered with the memory of The Incident, AKA the reason Jack had to text before coming to visit now.
Cas slides his hands down the length of the leg, feeling the bone under his hands. It seems a fairly simple break, with no large splinters or cracks. He adjusts his grip on the bottom half of the shin and twists.
There was a Cas-shaped hole in the world and Dean was still struggling to comprehend it. He felt wrong-footed and incomplete as he lay there on the Bunker's floor, staring at the wall that just a few minutes ago turned a black gooey substance and swallowed up Billie and.. And Cas.
The drive wasn’t too long, but Dean could feel the pesky, annoying butterflies in his stomach fucking partying in there.
He thought back at the anger and desperation Chuck emanated, how he’d do anything to have his ending and nothing else seemed to matter. It’d never made sense to Dean, why Chuck would decide to erase all the other universes, his own creation, just because of a few “characters”. But it was never about that, was it? It was never about some stupid story. Death said he was trying to escape his fate, that in order to do so he snapped everyone out of existence. God was trying to get rid of Death. God was dying.
“ You and your brother are the only ones left because Chuck can’t control you. He doesn’t have any kind of power over you.”
“Are you here to kill me?” Dean asked, a tiny drop of hope seeping through his voice. Dean hated it. Hated that he was so willing to die, after Cas-- After.
He squinted trying to distinguish the blurred silhouette that was looming over him and he wanted to curl up in a ball and stay there till nothing existed anymore when he noticed that whoever that person was, it was wrong. No dirty trench coat(
The angel, for his part, regarded this particular un-Dean-like display of emotions with shock and guilt tugging mercilessly at his Grace, temporally shading the elation and dread at seeing Dean so soon. Too soon. He should have lived a long happy life, marry, have children…It was the least he deserved. But as Dean breathed shakily against his neck, his body wracked with sobs, Cas couldn’t entirely suppress his own shivers at having Dean so close.
He hadn't known and now, now he would never know because he was gone and Dean never got to tell him, didn't have enough time to process, didn't know what to do and how to do it and then Cas was dead, gone forever and
Dean was another scratch away from strangling the little beast when he heard Cas make an amused sound from the back of his throat.
How could Dean forget that?? He remembered every vivid detail of that particular meeting. He remembered the sheer terror and awe as he stared Death in the face, expecting to die right then and there for even daring to approach him. But it was nothing like Dean had expected. Instead of certain and instant death, he ate pizza with the Horseman, discovering he had quite a soft spot for greasy food and actually had a civilized chat. A terrifying, but civilized, chat.
Cas stood there, watching with a soft smile on his face. He raised his face to the now dark, starry sky and hummed happily.
As realization struck, Dean felt like his heart had just been ripped out of his chest and squeezed painfully until only shreds remained. He felt breathless, his lungs couldn't get enough air, his face was burning and his entire body was trembling.
"So if you don't see colours, what do you see? Black and white?" Dean asked in an attempt to calm himself down.
Okay so chapter count and tags have been updated. This story proved to be a bit longer and more complicated than i previously thought,
Cas looked up, locking ocean blue eyes with bright green ones. The emotion in them was almost unreadable. Excitement and apprehension and a spark of contained hope. Dean couldn't imagine how it felt for Cas. If this didn't work, well, he couldn't imagine his angel taking it well.
him broke the hunter’s remaining tatters of his soul into tiny little pieces. Dean couldn’t find it in himself to fight anymore, so he simply continued to stay exactly where he was, ignoring the faint buzzing of his phone. He knew he should answer, he knew Sam was probably driving himself mad with horrible scenarios but what would he even tell him? Shit, what was he going to tell
Cas nodded and then squinted at Dean, that tell-tale glint in his eyes sparkling. “Of course, Dean. But maybe without potentially ending the world and everyone in it. I don’t think it’s really worth that much.”
He turned to look at his human and remained struck dumb on the spot. He had known Dean was a good-looking human, had had countless fantasies involving Dean and Dean’s body, but now he felt like ‘good-looking’ wasn’t cutting it.
“Um, yeah, noted. So---AGH! Son of a bitch!” He yelled, startling Cas and looked down only to see the same black fur-ball that had sat on his head now nuzzling his leg, claws suspiciously red. He couldn’t believe it!! The little fucker scratched him!!
Dean sighed and sunk deeper into the worn leather seat of the Impala, drumming his fingers on the wheel to the beat of the Led Zeppelin song that could be heard from the radio.
“Dean?”- and his tone was sweet and concerned and still had that edge of restless enthusiasm and God, Dean was whipped- “ what happened? Are you okay? Do you feel unwell?”
Of course, staring is exactly what he did. He didn’t try anything, why would he? It was useless anyway, trying to escape a most likely furious Death a second time that day(and Jesus Christ when had his life turned into such a shit-show? Ah yeah, since Chuck decided that being a mere spectator to his favourite characters’ lives wasn’t enough). Cas wasn’t there to save him. Cas wasn’t there at all, and the reminder that he would never be again, that loving Dean had
When Death smiled, Dean felt chills shake him to the core. It was one of the most unnerving experiences he’s ever had and he’s literally been to Hell.
Sam handed Harry over, then tried to contort his neck to look properly over his shoulder. It didn’t look good. With a curse under his breath, he left the room.
Cas flaps just his right wing, and watches the feathers ripple and fall back into place. “Hmm. It seems I have full control over them. That’s good.”
“Sorry, Jody,” Cas mumbled, putting down his first and only glass of wine, still half full, “we’ve ruined a lovely evening, haven’t we?”
“It could make or break my career,” Sam continued. “Eileen was out with Valerie, and Val had already canceled three times so this was the first time they’d seen each other in six months, and our usual babysitter needs at least two days warning, so yeah, I phoned you. I wasn’t exactly expecting to phone a sex line. You said you two have toned it down.”
He was looking down at his phone to call her, so he didn’t see her walk up to him and clap him on the shoulder. He nearly dropped his phone in a puddle that he hoped to god was rainwater.
“Okay!” Eileen interrupted. “If we could stop encouraging my son to commit murder before his first birthday, that would be great.”
Cas wanders aimlessly around the shop for lack of anything better to do, running his fingertips over the spotless counters. A small dream catcher on the wall catches Dean’s attention, and he picks it up, bouncing it a few times to make the feathers dance.
A laugh interrupted them. Jack managed to extract himself from the octopus-like creature attacking him and greeted the friend they’d seen joke with him earlier. Jack blushed and took a few steps away from his family.
Dean opened the sliding back door and gestured for Miracle to follow him. Miracle had done this a hundred times before so knew the drill. It was only a short walk up the path to Dean's favorite fishing spot.
A strange sight met him. Harrison didn’t look frightened or upset, or in any way worried for his life. On the contrary, his face was stretched wide in a smile as he slapped his hands against the water.
Harry made no attempt to copy him, so Dean took his tiny hands and held them in place for him. Harry just smacked himself on the head and laughed again.
“And right now? My true happiness is watching you take in the beauty of creation. How you must have seen a thousand sunsets in your life, but it still amazes you every time. Every day with you is the new best day of my life.
As he walked past Cas, he felt a hand reach out and grab his free one. Cas looked up at him with a doe-eyed expression.
Cas pushed him with such strength down the stairs that he stumbled and fell to the ground, scuffing his knees in the gravel.
Dean can feel the grace inside him surge before he sees a bright blue tendril of light flow from his mouth and twist in the air before slipping through the body’s lips.
Sam claps a hand over his heart, where it is beating out of his chest. “God, I forgot how annoying that was.”
Sam got onto one knee in front of her and took both of her hands in his. He rubbed his thumb over the ring that suited her so well, it was almost like she’d been born with it in place. He kissed the fingers of her left hand before letting go so his hands were free.
Dean swore under his breath. Frigging witches! Always up to some messed-up crap. “Well, there must be an antidote! A counterspell or something!”
He holds the phone in place with his shoulder and takes the fruit to run his thumb pensively over it, as if trying to unlock its secrets.
“Me neither,” said another voice from the right. “My nephew’s gay and he’s a great kid. Damn sight better than his brother. That idjit voted Trump. Twice,” he growled.
Donna pulled the remaining guest into another rib-squeezing hug. “Eileen! You keeping out of trouble?”
He can feel the bone protest under his hands, the muscle and sinew stretching. A small spurt of blood trickles from the cut, thickened with disuse.
“Sorry, Dean, but it is necessary,” he says through gritted teeth. “I can’t waste my grace healing an infection right now.
Cas found her discarded shoe and held it in place for her to put her foot into, then buckled it. He held out an arm for her to balance herself on.
Cas tries to lower the arm, but can’t seem to connect his neurological pathways to send the message to relax that muscle.
Dean took Cas’s other hand in his and played with his fingers. He kept his gaze on Cas’s lips, not quite able to look him in the eyes.
Cas sat back down but didn’t stop burning a hole in the back of Valerie’s head with his eyes, as Jack entered the room holding Harry’s hand. Jack was dressed maybe slightly too formally in his rented tuxedo and bow tie, and Harry was the dictionary definition of adorable in his little page boy suit and hair combed into a smart side parting.
Cas removed his hand from Dean’s arm and used it to tilt his chin up so they were eye to eye, their faces mere inches from each other.
Cas slams his hand over his mouth to try and stop the words pouring out but Dean continues, undeterred, even though it comes out muffled and nonsensical.
“Okay, then. I’ll call the restaurant, tell them to add one more to the reservation.” He found the number in his history and dialed it. “Dinner with the Belieber, why not? My life’s already so goddamn weird,” he said to himself.
“Really?” Sam asked. Dean hadn’t mentioned that in his incredibly brief rundown of how Cas had died.
The bouncer looked at him more intensely now he was closer. She ignored the license and scanned her eyes across his face, from his crow's feet over to his graying temples.
“Oh, Sam told me everything before I went to college. I know why condoms are important. He told me what happened with the watermelon.”
“There’s one thing I don’t get though. Cas’s deal with The Empty. It would only come to take him when he was truly happy.”
“That wasn’t so difficult, now, was it?” Cas shoved him back so he fell onto his ass, then gave him one final kick for good measure.
He took a few deep breaths before looking back at Cas, who had his head tilted to the side in confusion but also had a hint of a smile tugging at his lips.
He can feel Dean trying to retreat into a dark corner of his mind to not have to face the upcoming agony but to no avail. Dean wishes for the first time that he wasn’t conscious during this possession. It’s strange; he can read Dean’s subconscious thoughts as well as the words he lets Cas hear.
He pulled out three envelopes, each with a name on the front, and handed them to the respective person, and kept one for himself. “Passports, driver's licenses, birth certificates, social security numbers, college degrees, et cetera. I had to change a few things so it wasn’t immediately obvious we’re the same people.”
Most of them shook their heads. The old man in the corner didn’t look up from his meal. He probably hadn’t even noticed the fight.
“Sam, I think there’s a roll of duct tape in the trunk, could you get it?” Cas asks through the window once he returns.
In an instant, they’re standing in a tree-lined driveway, an old plantation house ahead of them. Empty flower beds line the path and overgrown weeds sit where neatly mowed grass once lay. Vines crawl up the side of the house and through the cracks in the windows. An owl hoots from its roost in the chimney, an assortment of mouse bones in a pile beneath it.
Cas surged forward to press their lips together. He tried to pour as much emotion, every second of the last eighteen years that he'd been in love, into it.
Dean walked further into the room and Cas locked eyes with him over Jack's shoulder. The pained expression on Cas’s face made him stop still, as if all his limbs had suddenly frozen.
Dean had caught wind of a case, where the parents got murdered and the children were kidnapped. It seemed familiar, so he dug out dad's journal from where it was stashed under a box of guns, unused for years. After it confirmed his suspicions, they headed to the vamp nest in a barn on the outskirts of town,
“You’re okay with me moving out, then?” He took a few steps back so Dean couldn’t manhandle him again. “I thought you might have a hard time adjusting.”
He stands back in front of the mirror and runs his eyes up and down his new body. To him, Dean looks exactly the same as before, but as always, Dean has an opinion.
“No, that would be dumb.” Sam lightly slapped Dean on the shoulder, not hard enough to jostle the baby.
Cas hovers his hand over the wound, fusing the bones together and stitching up the skin with a blast of grace.
Thankfully, he doesn’t encounter Sam on his way back to the bedroom, so he doesn’t have to explain his half-naked state. It’s not until he rounds the last corner that Dean realizes where they are.
Sam frowned. “I hadn’t thought about that. We’ve never discussed it. I don’t know what she thinks about marriage, actually,” he said sheepishly.
From her slightly undignified position on the floor, she tried to yank her skirt free, but it wasn’t budging. Cas looked like he was about to help, but realized it might be inappropriate for him to put his hands so close to a lady’s thigh, so he offered up the job to Sam.
“Oh, come on. It’s been years since I got stoned. And don’t you act all high and mighty. I know you’ve smoked before.”
Jack and Cas both looked up from where they were sitting on the bed, hunched over the textbook. “It’s okay, Dean, I’ve got it now. Cas knew what the quadratic formula was.”
Dean swipes for the phone, but Sam uses his extra height to his advantage and holds it above his head, waggling it tauntingly.
Sam looked around, expecting to find some celebrity standing behind him, before remembering that was Cas’s fake name. Everyone turned their heads to stare at Cas, bewildered.
Cas takes the meager duffel bag of Dean’s phone, charger and headphones and slings it over his back. He turns off the light and shuts the door, then heads over to his room.
Cas deepens the kiss, his breathing heavy as he runs the tip of his tongue over the seam of Dean’s lips, seeking entrance.
“Et tu, Brute? I've already got Sam and Claire hanging out my dirty laundry, I don't need you coming for me too. Are you still mad about that? I barely knew you then!”
“Well, I didn’t! Someone should really write a manual. This happens way too often,” he grumbled angrily.
“We’re going to have to work together. On your knees.” He waits for Dean to follow the order. “Now put your foot up so we’re kneeling. Now, Sam?”
All the other patrons lifted their heads in curiosity, except one old man in the back corner kept eating his food as if nothing were happening.
He knocked three times on the door and took some breaths to help mentally psych himself up for the inevitable shitstorm that was about to go down.
Sam returns a moment later and unlocks the cuffs and tosses them back in the trunk. Dean flexes his fingers and shakes his arm a few times. If he still had to worry about blood circulation, his arm would be tingling with pins and needles right now, but it feels the same as it would if it had been free the last two days.
Dean hadn’t noticed Cas preparing the tweezers until they were already poking into his aching wound. It takes Cas a few attempts to get a grip on the bullet, causing Dean to scream in pain every time, but finally, he manages to pull it from his thigh and sets it with a clank into the sink.
She opened the box to reveal a silver band with a subtle diamond and sapphire inlay. “A ring! And do you know what the problem with it is?”
“Ugh,” Dean groaned and collapsed into his seat, “we already turned down Thanksgiving and Christmas. Can’t put it off again. I’ll text her to make plans.”
Years of Pavlovian conditioning had taught him that words like that coming from Cas’s mouth meant he was about to get laid. Damn it, now was not the time to get aroused.
The first press of the needle into his already sensitive flesh has him instantly biting down on the leather. Unfortunately, there is nothing to stop Dean’s internal monologue of colorful expletives.
“Ma’am, huh? I like you. You have more manners than your brother. Did you know he’s a drug addict?” she added bluntly.
Together they cross the room and open the top draw. Cas takes out a large silver knife and rolls up Dean’s undershirt. He cuts a thin, shallow slice across their stomach. It wells with blood but he can feel no pain from it.
Out of the corner of his eye, he can see the waitress walk up to the young boy and crouch down to his level.
Sam scooped the last remnants from the pot and waggled the spoon like an airplane into Harry’s giggling mouth, then wiped off the green mess he’d made over his chin with a tissue.
“Dean, no,” Cas says sternly. He takes the dream catcher from Dean and hangs it back on the wall. He slaps the back of Dean’s hand lightly. “Stop it.”
“Thank you.” He turns back to Sam, who had been watching the one-sided exchange with a smirk. “We’ll get the blood last. I would like to be at full power before I confront her again.”
Cas yanked the door open, ready to curse out whoever was on the other side, but the woman approaching middle age in a sensible skirt made him pause. “Uh, can I help you?”
Dean settled in his favorite spot on the couch, wiggled his butt into the long-established indent, and dragged a blanket over his lap. He reached for the remote to turn on the TV then kicked his feet up on the rest Cas had bought him to stop putting his feet on the coffee table. He groaned.
“Oh, he is. I know how he gets when he’s upset. I recognize the signs. He’s just putting on a brave face.”
Cas pokes at the fingers on his right hand. He can feel the nails digging into his skin, but can do nothing to flinch out of the way. “For some reason, I no longer have control over my right arm.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. That can’t be it. That can’t be our engagement story. Let me at least do this properly.”
“He knows, Cas,” Dean said, shaking his head. “According to the smartass, he’s always known. Back when Lucifer first got raised, I think that little speech of yours in Bobby’s hospital room made him start seeing things a little different.”
Looking down, the sadness he felt washed over him once more. A part of him wanted to leave the barn, to drive back to the bunker and force the pain away like always. To bury his ache so deep that eventually he was numb from it all, as if it had disappeared. But now that they were free, now that their lives weren’t in peril, all he could do was think. As much as he wanted to shut his brain off and forget, he couldn’t bring himself to do it anymore.
He felt another grip and this time, Cas had taken his hand. Their fingers slowly twined in a way lovers reached for each other after years of togetherness. It was so soon to feel this way for a stranger but as much as Dean felt nervous, something in Cas’ eyes grounded him. It felt right, standing there, holding hands.
The kiss was hard and claiming, satisfying a need deep inside Dean. Feeling the stubble rubbing across his face sent an excited chill through his body. What would have felt weird or off-putting before now felt perfectly right.
“Not ready to talk about it yet, Sammy,” he said, closing the topic off as he stepped backwards. “Don’t wait up.”
“He brought you back?” Dean asked, eyes flying across his friend’s face. “He said he wouldn’t be hands on. I asked him after. I prayed to him over and over.”
Before either could respond, Dean turned on his heels and walked out of the room, feeling the heat of their gazes as they watched him go. When he was behind Baby’s wheel, driving down the quiet road in the darkness of the night, he let his pain unravel. The tears he held inside in front of others, the mask of happiness he wore for all to see finally stripped away. His eyes began to well as his heart shattered. An hour into his drive, his phone rang but he couldn’t bring himself to answer.
“Cas,” Dean tried again. “If we do this, I can’t handle you taking off or disappearing to who knows where without a word whenever something big or small happens. I can’t handle you going off for days or weeks without any word from you at all. I’m not saying you can’t do your own thing but it can’t be like it was. I’ll lose my damn mind.”
When he looked up, Cas’ smile had grown softer than before. They held eyes for another few moments until the patron behind Dean bumped into him, sending him forward a few inches. He was nowhere near the danger of falling off his stool but Cas had reached out anyway, gripping his side in protection. Dean felt his entire face flush and cursed himself under his breath. Why was he acting like a teenage girl around some guy he hardly knew? Making a fool of himself every second?
His voice echoed slightly in the open space as he reached out to touch the wall. It felt cool against his hand, his fingers dragging against the metal.
“I love you too,” he said, pulling the Angel’s face up to meet his eyes. “Let’s get out of here and go home. I’m getting too old for fooling around outside like this. You, me and our bed.”
Dean could feel the glistening in his own eyes at the quiet confession. Cas sat before him, waiting, and watching, nervous but forever patient. As Dean took a moment to contemplate the choice laid out, he realized it wasn’t really a choice at all. He and Cas were tethered together, their bond one that sang eternal. They had began as reluctant allies, a bond that blossomed into friendship and family over the years. Somewhere in the midst of all their sacrifices, Cas became more important to Dean than he could have ever imagined. Somewhere between all the laughter and betrayal, mourning and sorrow, Dean had fallen in love with the Angel who had sacrificed Heaven and Hell for him. It was all still so new for Dean, the emotions he felt nearly overpowering him but he gave a nod and told his fears to stick it where the sun couldn’t shine down.
So many words had been exchanged over the years, words that held hidden meanings and yet in the end, so much had been left unsaid. Mourning Cas had been nothing new for Dean but each time he lost his best friend, each time was harder than the last. Losing him after his confession felt like a jagged knife had been twisted into Dean’s heart, holding in place. He had been angry at himself for not speaking up in that moment; angry for so much time that had gone to waste; angry that he had been so blind for all those years. But Jack had proven to be a merciful God when he had rescued Cas from the Empty, transporting him back to the bunker after Christmas night. Dean had stood frozen in place, eyes locked with Cas, neither really believing the moment. Sam had been first to greet him, hugging Cas close in a way that signified their close friendship bond. Cas had smiled at Sam but his eyes had kept flickering back to Dean, a myriad of emotions playing out on his face. He was hopeful and wary, nervous, and happy, waiting and watching until Dean had finally crossed the room and closed the gap between them. Holding Cas close, pinning the Angel to his chest, all Dean could do was tilt his face inwards and breathe him in. Tentative arms had wrapped around him as Cas had slowly given in. They had stood there, holding each other, neither willing to speak from fear of waking and discovering it had all been a dream. When Dean had finally pulled back, Sam had disappeared down the hall. Dean had wanted to say everything all at once but he’d stepped back instead. The light had dimmed in Cas’ eyes and as much as Dean had wanted to reach out and smooth the frown away, he had an idea of how he wanted things to play out.
“Awesome,” Dean said but before either could say anything further, their food was pushed towards them.
“It’s fine,” Cas said, reaching out to squeeze his arm again. “Gabriel calls me Cassie all the time.
Dean flushed again and looked to the side, the move allowing Cas to lower himself down and leave another mark on his neck. It would bruise over, Dean was sure, but deep down he craved it. The idea of being marked, of belonging to someone else made his heartbeat turn rapid. The Mark of Cain and his connection to Amara had been dark. This was the light.
“Sam and I do this sometimes,” Dean said after a minute. “Whenever things got too difficult and we needed a moment just to ourselves, away from it all, we’d drive out here and stare up at the stars. Some nights, we could hardly see anything in the sky. Other nights, they were shining bright like right now.” He looked over and caught Cas watching him with a soft expression. “Feels good, doing this with you.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean raised his gym bag over his shoulder and stepped forward. “Insult me all you want, old man. Leave my Baby out of it.”
The kiss was soft, nothing more than a gentle press of lips. When Dean made a noise of contentment, released from a place of need deep inside, the dam finally broke between them. Cas tugged him closer by the hands they still held, their bodies molding together. His free hand traveled to the small of Dean’s back and up his spine, ending in his hair, buried in the strands as if they were meant to be there always. At the first hint of tongue, Dean made another noise and couldn’t help but lean even closer as his mouth fell open. It was clumsy and messy but perfect. All Dean could feel and touch and taste was Cas, inside and all around.
Cas spread his hand over Dean’s heart before answering. “You are the embodiment of beauty, inside and out. What I said to you that day, I meant those words, Dean. I made this choice because it felt right.
As Cas littered his skin with kiss after kiss, Dean squeezed his eyes shut and let himself feel. He was standing in the same place as he had stood all those years ago, surrendering his body, soul, and heart to the intensity of their feelings. When their lips met again, he sighed into the kiss. He was standing with Castiel, the Angel of Heaven who had give everything for Dean. The Angel who had chosen to leave his celestial life to be human with Dean, to grow old with and love Dean.
“It’s incredibly loud,” Cas replied, lifting his hand to circle above their heads. “I love my brother but how is this even considered music?”
Their banter could have continued like it normally did but instead, Sam tapped Dean’s forehead with his own, high with brotherly affection.
“No disrespect to Ketch but I got my eyes on someone else,” Bobby said before sighing. “Kid, I’m putting your name up for promotion.”
He glanced over and saw the wheels turning in Cas’ head, his eyes growing dark in a way that left Dean completely breathless.
Sam gave him a look of irritation but quickly leaned forward to pull Dean into a solid hug. “Feels good to do this without the world in peril for once.”
“Nah, she was just a one hit wonder,” he replied, ignoring the way Sam rolled his eyes at the words. “Too tired tonight to go bar hopping anyway. Think I’ll just head home.”
Douchebag stuttered in offense but quickly disappeared through the crowd. Dean watched as the man shook his head and turned back to his beer. As much as he enjoyed watching Douchebag strike out, he wasn’t sure his anxiety would make him a better replacement. He’d never picked up a guy before, never even flirted out of fear of how John would have reacted. Even now, a small part of him felt that same, irrational panic. He hadn’t seen his Father in years but a part of him was still worried the man would suddenly materialize out of thin air.
“You screwed up so many times, Cas. In the name of Heaven or peace or the greater good, you lied to me over and over and it hurt more and more each time. It hurt because you
feel right. You always have. My love for you has always been there, never wavered. I just understand it now.”
“You’ve heard…?” Dean started and shook his head. “Cas, that’s just sad. You need to be schooled in the art of actual music!”
Dean took a sharp breath. “You told me I was the most selfless, loving human you would ever know. That knowing me changed you. That you cared because I did.”
“You turn thirty-five only once, little bro,” Gabriel said with a toothy grin. “Mrs. Banks from next door has already agreed to watch Olivia for the night. She’s coming by in a few minutes actually.”
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” the nasally voice said as the older man slightly leaned in, the smell of alcohol heavy on his breath.
“Yeah, all good,” he managed and leaned back again, missing the warm touch when Cas removed his hand. “So, why all the doom and gloom on your face tonight?”
A sudden spark at the end of the barn made him slowly lift his gaze. Blinking through the wetness in his eyes, he watched as the spark disappeared and then another took its place moments later, brighter than the last. The sparks came one after another, intensifying until a brightness filled the entrance to the barn. Dean steered his gaze away just as the walls around him began to shake. Stumbling backwards, he reached inside his pocket for the demon knife he always carried. A quick bolt of thunder and the light disappeared.
The smile Cas gave him made his breath catch. It was full of a promise of things to come, of everything they had long denied themselves or been too inept or stubborn to admit out loud.
They turned towards the PIC walking towards them from the ambulance. Jess had a sweet smile as she slipped in beside Sam, holding onto his arm.
“Or become human,” Cas said, his voice barely a whisper as he took in Dean’s shocked expression. “I chose humanity, Dean.”
Three hours passed before he pulled the Impala to a stop behind an abandoned barn. He hadn’t even realized where he was driving until he stopped. Climbing out to his feet, he made his way through the darkness, boots crunching on the ground. Leaving the barn doors open to allow light inside, he made his way through the entrance and stopped a few feet in. Glancing around himself, he closed his eyes and was back in time, standing shoulder to shoulder with Bobby, guns full of rock salt gripped ready. The doors had opened, the lights sparking around them and suddenly,
“Well, Dean, haven’t seen you here before. Your first time?” she asked, watching as he downed his second drink.
“It’s New Years eve,” Sam said, his smile carefree for the first time in so long. “Eileen’s in the kitchen getting drinks ready. She wants us to watch fireworks on TV and have a quiet night in.”
“Hold up,” Dean said, breaking his lips free and laughing fondly when Cas chased him and stole another kiss. “Sweetheart, hold up a second. I don’t exactly want us to do the deed here, out in the open.”
Dean took a breath at the deep, gravelly voice and felt a sudden heat spring up inside him. He peeked towards them and saw Douchebag leaning even closer, the movement making the man finally tilt his head in that direction.
“I like hearing you call me that,” Cas whispered, lowering himself down, teeth grazing across Dean’s collarbone and up his jaw.
“Everywhere,” Cas said with a smile. “He has chosen not to be hands on but his presence is felt in the world around us. In all of the good there is.”
He flushed once more at his own words, knowing he should be embarrassed but the smile Cas gave him was worth it. They shared a final kiss before they slid off the hood and climbed inside the Impala, cooler dropped into the backseat, the beers long forgotten.
“Do you not understand the meaning of no? Should I contact the Special Victims unit and see if your name is on their list?”
Dean switched on the engine and pulled through the open field. Once they were back on the main road towards the bunker, he turned his attention over. “What do you wanna call me?”
When Cas lowered his phone, Dean was halfway out the door. Startled by the departure, Cas was up on his feet, chasing him outside within seconds.
Bobby smiled warmly, nudging his shoulder once more. “That’ll make us all happy, Dean. You know that, boy.”
“From hunting?” he said with a shrug. “With Jack the big man on campus, I don’t know. It’s like a weight’s finally been lifted. I mean, monsters will still be out there but maybe we can take a step back, relax a little. I don’t think I could ever fully quit. Hunting’s a part of who I am, it’s in my blood, ingrained in me, you know? But maybe we can take a breath and not let it be so important.”
Dean wasn’t sure how to take the words but he offered Pamela a wave and followed Cas towards the entrance. When they were out on the sidewalk, the noise of the bar now a muted sound in the distance, Dean looked up when he felt Cas gently reach for his arm.
was there. Dressed in that ridiculous trench coat that Dean had learned to love, Castiel had strolled inside, blue eyes bright as they met Dean’s gaze.
Dean nodded and took another drink of his beer. “So, it’s pretty obvious why I was trying to duck old pervert back there but your potentials seemed okay. Well, maybe not the douchebag in the suit.”
“I admit, I’m not a diner enthusiast,” Cas said and quickly sat up to correct himself. “That didn’t come out right. I have nothing against these establishments.”
Her eyes narrowed even more as she crossed her arms at her chest. “Dad, you can’t stay here all night. It’s your birthday!”
Cas was smart enough to understand his meaning and reached under the table to take Dean’s hand in his own. The touch settled the nerves threatening to rise and Dean released a grateful sigh in reply.
“Yes, and it’s my choice and I choose this life with you,” Cas said, his voice growing quiet. “I choose to grow old with you.”
Cas’ smile became fond as he looked down but Dean couldn’t leave it like that. He couldn’t let his words have a different impact from what he intended.
“How about classic rock?” he asked, leaning on his elbow. “Zeppelin, Springsteen, The Stones, Bob Seger?”
Castiel smiled even brighter at the nickname but didn’t comment against it. “I had religious parents growing up.”
They leaned back for air only when the need grew too intense. Not wanting the distance to extend, Dean tucked his face into the hollow of Cas’ neck, breathing him in. He could feel the tension in Cas’s muscles as his hands trailed up and down, mapping Dean’s body with nervous movements.
In a deep, hidden part of his mind, Dean agreed with his little brother, but, as he had a reputation to maintain and the opportunity to tease his brother looming on the horizon, Dean snorted.
“You know, I always thought it was obvious, that I couldn’t have hidden it worse. And you had an unfair advantage, being able to feel my fucking emotions!! I mean, c’mon how could you not know???”
And the sad puppy dog eyes were back full force on Cas' face, fully displayed and completely stripping Dean of his: 'tough guy, no chick-flick moments' persona.  And for the process to be complete, Dean gave in to his urge to kiss Cas' cheek if only to see his plump lips stretch into a small, beautiful grin.
"OKAY we're missing the point." said Dean trying to shift everyone's attention  away from him and back to the matter at hand. Cas and his weird ass sight.
He looked at the grass under his feet and then back at Dean. His human’s eyes were a few shades brighter and sparkled, full of life, but there was no mistaking the colour.
Cas hummed and leaned forward in his seat an excited smile spreading over his features and making Dean's poor heart flutter.
Cas leaned in and Dean’s eyes fluttered close in anticipation of a kiss on the lips that never came. Instead he could feel Cas’ slightly chapped lips flutter over his eyelids then move lower to press butterfly kisses over the burning flesh of Dean’s cheeks and then lower to the corners of his mouth. The glasses Cas was wearing bumped into Dean’s skin from time to time but they weren’t that inconvenient. Honestly Dean really didn’t mind them. Plus the sight of Cas with the glasses was doing things to Dean’s insides that he would rather not analyze now, in the middle of a bare field, in bumfuck Colorado.
Sam immediately sobered up and looked back at Cas even though Dean really didn't like the lingering mischievous glint in his eyes.
When Dean pulled back to catch his breath, they were both panting, their eyes never leaving each other.
Dean frowned because okay, point. But really, they had had bigger problems at that time and Dean for one, didn’t really want to think too closely about things like
“Ah, I thought it was an appropriate time to take a break from my duties. Obviously, it hasn’t worked out quite as well as I hoped.” Death mused, his forehead wrinkling even more as he frowned.
Sighing, Dean leaned back against the Impala, screwing his eyes shut. His heart was beating erratically in his chest and it seemed it didn’t matter that Dean was dead and therefore no physical body to speak of, the thought of seeing Cas again after…
Dean, in a futile attempt to get a hold of that phone and the incriminating photo, began chasing his Moose of a brother all over the field.
By the end of his speech Dean was shouting, letting out all the pent up anger, frustration, grief and desperation that have been building up inside him all his life. It wasn’t fair!
“Come on, Snow White, the cute animals await!” he said in a fake overly-enthusiastic voice, even though he was actually kinda looking forward to this. Not the animals(especially cats…cats were the worst and Dean made sure to take his antihistamines for this particular trip.), but seeing Cas happy. And this was guaranteed to make Cas smile. He was a total nature geek and normally Dean would have just chosen to take him to a park or something, but that would have looked too much like a date and that was…it made Dean all warm and fluffy inside just thinking about it, but it also made him very nervous. He was terrified he would make a fool of himself( see his rumblings from earlier) and anyway, he was planning to actually…ask Cas out, instead of going on a date-not- date and then torture himself with what ifs. (He mentally snorted at himself…If he was honest about this whole situation, he and Cas have been acting like an old married couple for years now. They were best friends yes, but they were also more. They’ve always been more.)
“ ‘Course I do. I don’t thank you enough for everything you do and have done for us, ..for me, anyway .”
He swallowed around the lump in his throat and side glanced at the angel in his front seat, who was staring out the window and at the parking lot that was now surrounding them. There weren’t many cars parked, probably something to do with the fact that it was Thursday(Ha!).
Cas shook his head. "No. I know what colours the grass, the sky and the earth are supposed to have, but I do not know what they look like... Why did you stop the car, Dean? "
if he could avoid it. He was barely coping as it was, without deliberately adding yet another set of problems to his miserable life. At the time he figured he would leave it alone and if it came to bite them in the ass(as it always did it seemed) well, they would cross that bridge when they got to it.
For now, he had to focus, had to figure out how and why the original Death was now here, in front of him, and passive-aggressively explaining to him the fact that he couldn’t exactly die.
“I love you, I love you, I love you!” Dean whispered it against his lips in between kisses, seared them into the skin of Cas’ neck and collarbone with his lips, painted them with his hands on the hard muscle of his back, intent on making sure that Cas never had reason to doubt it again.
He shrugged, a little self-conscious and looked at a point a bit above Cas’ left shoulder. “ I-uh…It’s September 18th and I mean, it probably doesn’t really mean that much to you, I think, I’m almost positive it doesn’t but uhh, I- um, wanted to thank you, for pulling my sorry, soon-would-have-been demonic ass outta Hell all those years ago. Jesus it feels like eons passed, but I mean you know more about that than I do, seeing that you’re a gazillion years old and all that jazz…Anyway I wanted to thank you, properly this time, for risking your life to save me… don’t know why you thought I’d be worth it, I mean, I’m certainly not and I know I fucked up your life even more, but yeah, I know it’s not much--” Oh sweet dear Jesus, he was babbeling and blushing and shit just kept spilling out of his mind like he was a twelve years old girl with a crush. Not that he had anything against twelve years old girls with crushes. He just…wasn’t one. Not that it mattered to his stupid brain, it seemed.
Cas’ questioning look was what startled him out of his daydream. Fighting to keep his nerves in check, Dean exited the car, putting his forearms on top of Baby and waited for Cas to follow suit. He didn’t have to wait too long before he heard the slam of Baby’s door and the angel was standing in front of him, squinty eyes looking questioningly around until his eyes settled on the building in the center of the parking lot. Ocean blue eyes skidded over the neon sign flickering over the entrance and widened comically, pure glee glittering in them. Cas turned towards Dean, excitement radiating from his every move and Dean’s heart fluttered in his chest.
“You better not use that photo, bitch!” Dean yelled still embarrassed that he’d forgotten his brother was there and basically forced him to watch the entire thing. Not that Sam seemed bothered by it.
The world full of colour was exquisite yes, but a Dean full of colour and without the angry looking red of his injuries was the most breath-taking sight he had ever seen. Not the newly-born stars and their beautiful soft light. Not a supernova and it’s bright hopeful flame moving across the universe. Not the colourful sky at sunset. Not the bright green grass or the soft brown ground below.
“That’s good. I’m -uh- I’m glad.” Dean managed to eloquently blurt out, totally referring to Cas’ grace and not the increasing amount of times Cas smiled per day(even if it was just a small, barely there tug of his lips) since they’d beaten God and got him out of that horrible deal with the Empty( Dean still had nightmares about that one, about a world where Cas was gone and Dean was left behind, alone, having to pick up the pieces of his own broken heart).
“Really, Dean, you and your brother ought to have figured out by now that you can’t really kill me. As long as there is life, there is Death. What you
"Um, I'm not sure what you mean, Cas." Sam finally replied, looking at the angel in the backseat with a concerned look in his eyes.
"And grays. Yes. I can also see red, but not in the traditional human way. It’s how angels can see injuries both internal and external, hidden weapons, as well as openings in our opponent’s defence."
Cas nodded, looking resigned, like he just knew that whatever was going to come out of Dean’s mouth it would never be anything else other than a rejection. It made Dean sick, how convinced Cas was that he was alone in his feelings. He’d known he was a shitty friend and an even shittier person, but this was something else.
He would have more time later, to drown himself in copious amounts of alcohol in a futile, desperate attempt to drown out the constant ache in his very bones that was Cas’ loss.
made me pray. You made me honest to well..God, pray. I think the last time I’ve done that before you came along was when I was a kid and mom used to tell that angels were watching over me. And even better, you gave me faith in myself, in Sam, in humanity after having been to Hell, Cas. After torture or be tortured was everything I knew for 40 years! I didn’t know it back then, not exactly, but I- I could feel you were different from all the rest. You were special, at least to me… Cas, you said you knew. You said you knew that you couldn’t have what you wanted but, Cas,”-Dean made sure to look the angel dead in the eye-”have you ever thought to
) no messy black hair that seemed so soft and made Dean want to constantly run his fingers through it, no ocean blue eyes regarding him with so much love and adoration and just plain wrong.
A few nights ago, while listening to ‘Angel with a shotgun’ (yeah he listened to something other than rock ballads, sue him. It reminded him of Cas, even tho that totally wasn’t why he’s listened to it in the first place.) realization struck. It was September 16th. In two days time, 12 years ago, Cas had pulled his sorry ass out of Hell. And Dean had never thanked him, not properly anyway. And maybe Cas didn’t really care, but Dean felt like he owed it to the angel to at least…commemorate it, if nothing else.
Of course he had Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Ash , Charlie, even his mom and dad here with him and Sam would be along eventually. Hopefully not too soon. He deserved a long happy life. Even if that life was without Dean, the ex-hunter knew Sam would be fine, eventually. He could feel it in his gut. So Sam wasn’t the problem. The problem was the missing piece. The vital piece to Dean’s true happiness.
Cas’ eyes widened in disbelief, jaw slack with the shock written all over his features. He let out a shaky breath.
“I thought I killed you.” Dean heard himself say, the sound of his own voice distant, void of any emotion, the numbness that was slowly taking over his entire being bleeding through.
“That Nephilim is the key. Remember that. I’ll come to collect when the time is due.” Death finally said and then vanished into thin air, leaving Dean standing there with more questions than answers and despair pulling at his heart strings.
Swallowing around the lump in his throat, Dean opened his eyes and looked around. Nothing, just the plain, green valley he thought was as good a set up as any when one was trying to get their angel to come so they could kiss the living daylights out of him and tell him what an idiot he’d been.
“So when you didn’t do anything I just thought you were ignoring it out of politeness or something. But I guess we’re just a couple of dumb-asses.” They both let out a small laugh, leaning into each other more and more with each passing second. The blue of Cas’ eyes had never this bright. Dean gently cradled his angel’s face in his hands wiping away a few stray tears with his thumbs. “I love you too, Cas!” the words had been surprisingly easy to say. Freeing in a way that beating God never was. “And you can have me, you’ve always had me.”
"Yeah yeah, Samantha, we all know what a hippie you are, don't need to announce it quite so loudly."
Before he even realized what he was doing, his legs had taken Dean to stand right in front of Cas and the next thing he knew, he was kissing Cas. It was more of a gentle brush of lips against lips , before Dean was pulling away, eyes wide with new found fear and brain playing on a loop:
“You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my entire existence. I love you, Dean.” Cas whispered, stating the single, most universal truth. The truth that defined every molecule of his being.
“Sam is still on that hunt with Eileen and Jack is supposed to drop by tonight, Heaven keeping him busy, so it’s just us I’m afraid….As for where we’re going- Dean turned towards his angel, who was leaning on the table, arms crossed, looking intensely at Dean, as was his habit. The hunter threw him a cheeky grin- that’s for me to know and for you to find out!! Come on, we’re leaving in ten!” and with that Dean threw the now wet rag on the counter and walked out, leaving Cas to stare questioningly after him.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. His mind was running a mile per minute. Everything he’s done, everything he and Sam have ever done was out of their own free will. Cas had been right all along. Of course he had been. It was real. They were real.
It was freeing and frightening to think about and any other time Dean would have reacted more strongly, but now he could feel the exhaustion and grief settle deep in his bones, sinking into his very soul and cloaking his thoughts until all Dean could do was lean warily onto the solid wall and blink back tears.
Dean couldn't say that about too many evenings in his life so he figured he should just enjoy the moment, driving his Baby, his brother by his side and his angel lover in the backseat, no world ending problem on their shoulders. Peaceful.
“Sometimes.” Cas agreed. “But at least you can’t hide any injuries from me as you so often attempt to do.” he continued and Dean earned himself a glare from the angel in the backseat. The hunter grinned sheepishly.
Dean gaped at Death. “ Wait wait wait, what do you mean he’s trying to avoid his fate? What the hell does that mean??”
“Dean, ever since that night in the barn when we first met, I found myself more suited for humanity than I did with Heaven,” Cas explained. “All the time I spent by your side and with Sam and Bobby and your Mother confirmed it. The last time I lost my Grace, I was a poor imitation of a human, fumbling around lost and confused. I do not intend to make the same mistakes.”
Smiling fondly, Cas inched forward across the seat and took Dean’s free hand in his. The move was sugary sweet but Dean couldn’t find it in himself to care. He let Cas twine their fingers together, smiling again at the soft touch of a kiss across his knuckles.
Dean felt the same fluttering inside him as he took the words to heart. Could it be that simple? Could Cas choose humanity, to set aside his Grace and live a life with him?
did, that I was the most selfless, loving human you knew?” he said to the emptiness around him. “How could you tell me you loved me and then leave me?”
He waited a few beats before he found the courage to meet Cas’ eyes. What he saw was a warmth that made him never want to leave that moment.
“Billy Stevens was talking about his mom at recess and how she hooks up with a new guy every weekend,” she said with a shrug.
“It’s a good thing I intend to stay,” Cas said, closing the gap between them. “Dean, the world is finally safe. In Jack’s hands, we can trust that the peril that has consumed us for so many years has settled down. We can take a step back, like you said. Both of us.”
Dean pointed with his head for Cas to get back into the bed, which he did, being careful not to spill any of the coffee. They sat up in bed and drank in companionable silence until the caffeine had reached Dean’s bloodstream and he was feeling slightly more human.
Cas’s answer is delayed by him turning his head to the side and releasing a hacking cough, spatters of blood hitting the floor. “Witch. I pissed her off.”
“Okay, so you and Cas have been together for, what, four years? And you’ve not said I love you yet? Give me some context. When did he first say it to you?”
He sits in silence for about half an hour before Dean speaks. He could feel Dean growing increasingly bored, clicking his tongue, sucking his teeth, and making fart noises, but after he sets aside his third useless file, Dean snaps.
The room was simply but sophisticatedly decorated, mostly in a chic glossy white, but with a few color accents, and was, most importantly, a living room. The second mercy he was granted was that a quick look down told him he was still fully dressed in the same clothes from the night before.
“That was close.” Claire put a hand over her chest. “Yikes, my heart’s beating faster than that time a werewolf cornered me down an alleyway.”
“Well, yeah. He kind of is anyway. Besides, they look identical.” His head flicked between the two of them. “It was the obvious option.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugged and tucked the blunt into his top shirt pocket. “Gotta rebel a bit at his age.”
Dean wishes he had more time to think, but Cas is getting paler by the second, the color draining out of him and onto Dean’s hands. “Oh, what the hell. I’ve got nothing in the diary for a couple days. Yes.”
Cas picks up the fallen cabinets one at a time, lamenting his weakened grace for how long it takes to lift them all and shoves the scattered papers back into the drawers at random. With the floor cleared, he pours the bleach into the water bucket and proceeds to wipe down the already-drying blood on the floor.
“Because you’d make an amazing father. I know your own father wasn’t exactly a role model. Mine wasn’t either. But you’re good with kids. You absolutely adored Harrison. You loved seeing those kids trick or treating last year. You’ve even gotten much better with Claire, and she’s a handful for most. But because you’re with me, you’re never going to be able to have kids of your own. I’m keeping that from you.”
Dean closed the final distance between them and placed a quick but passionate kiss on his lips, then before Cas had time to properly kiss him back, he pulled Cas’s hand and lead him towards the bedroom.
Dean remarks casually, still thinking about a funny video he just watched of a dog falling in a deceptively deep puddle.
Everyone looked very confused. They were all silent for a minute while they mulled over this information.
Cas’s right arm jerks forward without his instruction and hits the eject button. He’s so stunned, he forgets to look at the road for a second. Thankfully, they’re on a deserted highway and there’s no one to crash into as he swerves into the other lane.
On Saturday, Dean met Charlie at the address she gave him. He looked out the cab window at the building in front of him, and then back at his phone. Definitely the right place. He paid the driver then got out, and immediately regretted that decision as he watched the car drive away and leave him stranded.
Dean was positively buzzing with excitement by the time they got to the hospital. He ran through the maternity ward, past the flummoxed midwives, until he found the right room. Cas and Jack followed behind him, apologizing profusely to them all for his behavior.
The three of them had stepped out of the car. Sam and Dean looked down on Jack with hope in their expressions.
Sam purses his lips at that but doesn’t reply. He tiptoes to the adorned front door. It was probably beautiful once, elaborately painted, but now it was worn by years of the elements.
Sam knocks courteously on the door but doesn’t wait for an answer before entering. He regards the phone on the table with amusement.
“Don’t bother saving me. I want to die.” His words were starting to slur together but he persisted. “I deserve this.”
With the final button undone, Cas spreads the shirt open to expose his vessel’s toned chest. Dean holds the bowl still while Cas paints a series of symbols with his finger across the expanse of skin, from the neck down to his waist.
“Don’t houses cost money? How will we afford it?” Cas lifted his head long enough to speak, then went straight back to kissing Dean’s left nipple.
Cas had taken the whole ‘becoming human’ thing very seriously and had spent weeks researching the optimal way to care for the human body. As such, he always ate perfectly balanced meals, got his five portions of fruits and vegetables, and most importantly, worked out five days a week. Years of weightlifting combined with Cas’s millennia of experience fighting in Heaven’s armies made him a formidable opponent.
“I’ll be happy to live any life with you in it, Dean.” Cas lightly traced his fingers across Dean's chest. “But I must admit, a life with no demons, no angels, no witches, no deal with The Empty hanging over my head. It sounds… nice.”
Before the man could react, Cas punched him square in the jaw. The force of the blow caused him to bend over sideways, so Cas grabbed him by the collar and marched him to the door, pushing it open with the man's head.
“Hey, did you hear Bess had the baby?” Sam asked, the first one to speak other than Harry babbling in delight.
“Oh, I’m sure we can arrange that. Best man, maid of honor, and all that. So, you got any plans once this shindig is over?”
They’d done it. They’d actually done it. Defeated God Himself. Chuck was left scrabbling on the ground, powerless and pitiful. They could still hear his cries as they drove away, the wheels spinning on the loose gravel, but they didn’t even turn to look.
It was in a bit of a state of disrepair but was structurally sound. Dean spent weeks after they bought it replastering the walls and ripping out the old rotting floorboards.
Dean had forgotten clutching Cas’s dying body to his own and forgotten the blood seeping out of him onto his own clothes.
“They’re children. Scrap that, worse than children. Harry’s going to be a much better liar when he grows up. He takes after me, you know.”
Dean pushed Cas’s trench coat off his shoulders and placed it on the chair next to his bed. Then he did the same with his suit jacket. Cas didn’t break eye contact with him the whole time.
“I own a diner. The burger joint off the highway. You probably passed it on the way here. It’s become a bit of a hunter pit stop recently. Old friends drop in now and again. I help out where I can, or send them up to Gail at the bunker. Cas is human, now. He gave up immortality to bone a fry cook. What a guy. He works as a translator.
Cas’s hands fall to his leg as he folds in pain. He presses his palm over the wound to try and stop the bleeding, but it does little good. “Perhaps I should have specified. I
“It’s a cleansing agent. It is immensely powerful. It will help scrub my vessel of the curse inflicted on it.”
Dean was left on the porch, staring longingly as he drove away. He fell to the floor, his back against the wall, and felt tears roll down his cheeks.
Becky came in just as Jack was walking down the stairs. He’d finally heard the conversation at the door through his headphones.
Cas looks around. The street is as quiet as when they arrived, only a woman leaving a restaurant with takeout a few shops ahead. She walks away from them, so he decides it’s okay to proceed.
Dean heard the sound of the TV turning back on and the volume increasing to max as he left the room. He headed to Jack’s room, clenching his hands into fists and releasing them over and over. He knocked on the door and opened it without waiting for a response.
“How many times do I have to tell you? I don’t want to hear details of your sex life. Wait.” He paused to do some mental math. “The first month he was human? That was right before Harry was born, wasn’t it?”
He shook his head, dismissively. “Never mind. You’re right, though. What happened to me? I used to have sex, like, every night. Now look at me!”
At that moment, Dean’s phone rings loudly in Cas’s ear. Dean yanks the phone away and reads the caller ID saying ‘Sam’ flashing up on the screen. He accepts the call and speaks loudly into the receiver.
Cas looks behind himself to see the clearing extending several yards in the opposite direction, almost doubling his initial perspective.
Sam frowned at him and fed Harry another spoonful. “We think he might be teething soon. He’s started to get real fussy recently.”
They stand back and look down and the symbols once the last elaborate squiggle has been drawn. Nothing happens.
Cas nods. “Give or take. I’m not sure how long it will take. It’s going to be a very delicate process. If I use too much of my grace healing my old vessel, I could burn it all out and be stuck in Dean as a human. But if I don’t heal it fast enough, it will start to succumb to decomposition and I will not be able to inhabit it again and I’ll be stuck in Dean, anyway.”
One rare occasion that Sam wasn’t hiding with Eileen and Dean wasn’t joined at the hip to Cas, Sam cornered Dean in the library.
“Dean!” Cas wraps his stronger, angelic fingers around Dean's wrist and clutches it close to his chest. “That’s it. You can’t be trusted with this.”
The toddler ran smack into Cas’s legs and hugged him. Cas bent to pick him up and placed him on his hip.
“Got a new waitress. Kailee. Most of our waitresses don’t last long. They’re all kids from the local high school. She’s only seventeen, but she’s a fast learner. Some nasty guy groped her, so I punched him. Felt good.”
“It’s not on my finger. I found this months ago and I’ve been waiting, oh so patiently, but this very pretty ring is still in this box under your nastiest socks. Great hiding place, by the way. So what gives?”
They walked into the first clothes store they could see at the front of the mall. Cas didn’t notice the name of the shop, but it looked like every other clothes shop chain he’d ever seen. They headed to the baby section first.
Words overlapped one another, voices breaking. The waves surging against the boat drowned out all other sounds and made it impossible to spot something as small as a child struggling in the water.
Dean smirks at Sam’s expression, already planning his next move. “Yep, and we’ve saved the best till last. Blood of a pissed-off witch-bitch. How’s the hunt going?”
Cas had practically melted into a pile of goo in his arms, so he cuddled him into his chest, and stroked the small hairs at the nape of his neck.
“Nice work, kid. Knew you had it in you. The first one in the family to go to college,” he congratulated, with a painful pinch to Jack’s cheek.
“Good so far. Classes are fun, and I hardly ever sleep so I have a lot of time to catch up on homework.”
“Yes, please,” she grunted, and attempted to stand, but stumbled slightly due to her unlevel footwear.
Dean threw his arm over the back of Cas’s shoulders, sloshing his wine glass slightly as he did. “Yeah, we’re not the weirdest relationship here anymore. When are you and Kaia going to sort things out, huh?” Dean slurred, the wine loosening his lips in more ways than one.
“Yes, I know, but sometimes it’s easier to see these things from the outside. Give her time.” He patted Dean on the shoulder sympathetically. “It took you twelve years.”
Considering you just stabbed me repeatedly, he thinks subconsciously, but Cas pretends not to notice.
“If you know about us, then you know what we do. You know we can kill you.” Sam cocks the gun for emphasis.
Sam is just loading the final things in the car when he enters the garage, and nearly drops his smoothies in surprise when he sees what Cas is carrying.
Cas smiles a weak, but relieved smile and shifts in Dean’s arms to sit up slightly, wincing with every movement. Dean adjusts his grip to support Cas’s head as it lulls on his shoulders.
Dean smiled. He liked Charlie like this. Free from the tensions of Apocalypse World, letting loose. She had a spark in her eyes that he hadn’t seen in a long time, and for a second, it was almost like his old friend had never died.
When the waitress brought out their food a few minutes later, Dean was absolutely overjoyed to see the heaping tower of meat on his plate, even if Sam did declare it a ‘cholesterol nightmare’. Dean in turn spent a long time mocking Sam’s pitiful bean patty, hidden by a mountain of lettuce.
Dean picked up Miracle, as he’d decided to call him, readjusting his grip around the dog a few times to accommodate his weight, and carried him back to Sam and Jack.
Zehra returned moments later, this time without Chad. Dean could see him talking to a middle-aged couple who must be his parents a few yards away. Cas tentatively took the pen she offered him and signed the same no-frills C. Kline Dean had seen him sign on all of his mortgage papers, but she seemed over the moon with it, clutching it to her chest with more reverence than she’d given her diploma.
“You expect me to believe that Dean Winchester, man whore, who can pick someone up at a bar and be back at their place in under an hour, is what? Waiting till marriage?” He threw his hands in the air.
Freedom. It was the strangest feeling. As Dean left his room and made his way down the hall, his mind went over the past few days on a never-ending loop. No longer were their strings being pulled by Chuck. No longer were their lives out of their hands. They were free.
He saw the glistening in Cas’ eyes and quickly realized the pet name he had said. Dean chuckled through his flush but Cas reached for his head and held him in place.
Her smile softened at his words and the mischief was gone from her gaze, replaced by a sweetness that left him wordless. “Honey, is it your first time trying this new thing?”
With a heavy sigh, he spun around and reached for his clothing, strewn across the floor beside him. Boxers, jeans, shirt and flannel. When the final button was done, he ran a hand from front to back, hoping to tame the edges of his short hair, and looked up just in time to catch his mirrored reflection. His eyes were hangover red but there was a tiredness in them that went deeper than his drunken escapade. When the heaviness in his heart grew too tense for that time of day, he tore his gaze away. His companion tilted her body, sensing the surrounding emptiness, and blindly reached her hand out towards him. Dean stood frozen at the foot of the bed, hoping his stillness would deter her from further movement. She made a noise and buried her face in the pillow again, all sense leaving her as sleep dragged her back in.
He released the breath he had been holding and changed his direction, walking to the table he and Bobby had set up all those years back. He leaned against the metal, staring forward at the light near the entrance.
Dean cleared this throat and ordered burgers, fries and sweet tea for them both. When the waitress left their drinks and disappeared behind the counter, Dean gave a chuckle that had Cas turning towards him.
“Seriously?” Olivia deadpanned. “Dad, you’re supposed to wear a shirt that’ll make someone wanna hook up with you, not think you’re some boring old librarian.”
“Love muffin?” Cas asked, laughing at the look of horror Dean gave him. “What about Baby Cakes? Sexy Pants? Sugar Lips?”
When they had been old enough to make it on their own, one night Sam had had enough. With John on yet another drunken binge, Sam had convinced Dean to leave their crummy one bedroom and all those bad memories behind. The Impala had been Dean’s at that point, ownership and everything in place. The one and only good gift his Dad had every given him. They’d packed up their things and driven through the night, ending up at Bobby’s place the next day. Bobby had taken one look at their faces and welcomed them without question. He had been promoted to Chief at Firehouse Twenty-Seven just months before they had arrived at his doorstep. A couple tours around the building and Dean had fallen in love. He’d excelled at the Fire Academy, breaking all other records before him. When Sam had shown interest after his high school graduation, Dean had been elated. Sam had gone on to break a few of those records at the Academy himself, but some had stayed with Dean’s name. The Winchester brothers had become a bit of a local legend, the best of the best by a lot of opinions. Once Dean and Sam were both on Truck 61 under Lieutenant Henriksen, everything felt like it had fallen into place. Sam starting up a romance with the Paramedic in Charge had been a bonus. Jess had taken a liking to them both when she had transferred to their Firehouse, treating Dean like the brother she had always wanted. John had been out of their lives, the disappearance taking the dark cloud of a bad childhood with him. All that was left was for Dean to fill that final gap.
“Will we tell Sam?” Cas suddenly asked. “If you wish to keep this between us, I understand. We can behave as if nothing’s changed.”
“I may be inexperienced,” Cas said, tilting up to catch his eyes. “But I have years of pent-up longing that I can finally address. Also, Google is quite informative. So is the Pizza Man.”
He nodded and followed her gaze again until their eyes fell on a man sitting at the bar several feet away, staring down at his beer with a cute frown. The mop of dark hair was messy atop his head, the navy shirt striking nicely against his skin.
