“Ohhhh, shit...” He groaned loudly, gripping tighter into Cas’ hair. Sparks shot up his spine, and he barely felt it when his legs gave out and he dropped to his knees.
“Hmm. I had hoped.” Castiel answered, his voice sounding like he was already drifting off again.
Again with the room for interpretation. Dean was positive he was sober, but with how low his inhibitions were, he decided it was a great time to stop drinking anyway. Throughout the whole brief conversation, they had remained pressed together - yet Dean felt a surge of loss as Cas moved away, even if it was only an inch. Cas left just enough space between their upper bodies that they weren’t touching anymore, but only just.
“Oh hey, sleeping beauty.” Charlie commented with a smile.
Castiel stood from the bench, and Dean followed him as he started walking along the path that ran beside the little creek. They both tossed their empty cups into a trash can and just walked for a few minutes leisurely.
There was a moments silence before he heard the footsteps retreating, and sighed in relief.
Dean took the opportunity to sit up, hooking his fingers on the waistband of Castiel’s pants. His movements were careful as he removed the pants, but Castiel couldn’t hide the way he flinched in pain. Dean froze, and he groaned in frustration.
“Run!” Castiel snapped, fear and panic lacing his voice.
“I don’t think it works quite that way legally-“ Dean started.
Dean gasped, realising that was as good as a ‘yes’. He reached out, fumbling on his bedside table between kisses until he managed to grab hold of the small bottle of lubricant. Cas grinned against his lips when he pressed the bottle into his hands.
Dean frowned, twisting his fingers together again. He didn’t have a response to that. I mean sure, it sounded similar to what he was experiencing, but he should be better than that. Stronger. Other people seemed to manage just fine, yet here he was, broken and useless.
“We won!”
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
“Fuckin’ chickenshit.” Dean scolded himself and shook his head again, went to take a swig of beer but it was empty.
“But?” Charlie pressed.
Dean glanced around the familiar office, taking in the smells and feel of the place that always put him at ease. Missouri didn’t come back straight away, and he knew she was letting him settle in, letting him take those few moments that he needed. He’d been seeing her every week for three months now, and she’d gotten used to his habits quickly.
The entire car fell into a shocked silence at her words. The reminder of how Cas’ life hung in the balance brought a burn to Dean’s eyes as his hands tightened on the wheel again, turning his knuckles white. Charlie seemed to notice, her sigh loud in the quiet of the car.
“I’m just going to take the trash out and leave you two to talk, alright? I won’t be long.”
“No debt.” Dean chuckled, taking a long drink. “I mean, there’s a bit to do, but the place is relatively solid. It’s just surface stuff.”
“Well, that is an interesting tale. Sounds like you had quite the night, young man.”
Five more steps.
“What for- oh shit.”
“Okay, okay... Let me...” Cas trailed off, his voice shaking.
“Right.” Dean shook his head as he watched Jo wander back to the pizza. In another time, maybe he would have tried his luck with her, but now... no way. It was an odd thought for someone who never settled down.
“Alright, Cas,” Dean started, surprising himself by how stable he was as he stood on his own skates. “Remember what I said. Take it slow, keep your knees bent and stay low. If you fall, fall forward - your wrist guards will protect you. If you have to fall backwards, pick a cheek to land on so you don’t break your tailbone.”
Castiel smiled to himself as he pulled the blanket over them both. He felt Dean’s other arm snake around his waist, and he cuddled closer, feeling safe and secure and wanted.
“Dean?”
Dean was quiet for a few moments, trying to understand what the man was saying. He didn’t fully understand what it meant to have patience with himself, and it seemed that Castiel was offering to teach him that. The problem was, he had a million doubts that he would be able to actually learn anything new. He wasn't smart enough, was too broken and uncontrolled. Still…
“What about ‘thou shalt not kill’?” Castiel eyed the towel, wishing that he could stop whatever was in there being revealed.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Dean took a breath and did as he was told. He put his hands on his knees, under the desk – trying to stop the shaking.
Dean smiled slightly and nodded, lifting his leg to show her as he grabbed a brownie from the plate. He’d finally been allowed to have the cast removed the week before and was now wearing a CAM boot. He’d gotten rid of the crutches as soon as he was free of the cast, and he loved that he could finally walk again – and drive.
“What, you’ll fire me?” Dean snipped with a slight grin, a tiny light of his old humour.
“Dean!” Sam admonished at the same time.
Dean could have imagined the soft kiss that pressed to the back of his head before he let the darkness take him under again.
“Who?” He pushed.
Dean just nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Sam was perceptive - he knew something was going on. But there was no way he could pick up on exactly what had just occurred, Dean was certain. He would have pulled a massive bitch face if he knew and been lecturing him on the ‘undecency of it all’.
“Bitch!” Dean yelled down the hall, then grinned as he heard the answering ‘Jerk!’ float back to him.
The pieces fell into place. He’d missed check in, and Michael would have done some digging to find out what he’d been up to. He was being taken in to be reprimanded.
Dean came back up with a soft pop, and he barely registered a chuckle before his cock was engulfed again, almost to the base. His head dropped back as pleasure tingled up his spine, a loud moan leaving his lips. He felt, more than heard, Dean’s moan in response, and he brought his head up again to find Dean with his mouth wrapped around his cock, one hand around his own.
“Mm, pride killer. I admit, the name they came up with for me - I like it. Though they should be calling me a saviour.”
“I really wish people would stop saying that.” Dean huffed. He noticed her injured look, however, and softened his tone slightly. “I just- I don’t want to rely on the best outcome. But this is great, thank you Charlie. We couldn’t do this without you.”
“Ah, you’re awake again.” Uriel drawled as he stepped into his line of sight. “Good. Wouldn’t want you to miss this.”
best.” Dean laughed. Then his face dropped and, following his line of sight, Castiel realised he had glanced at the clock on the bedside table. “Shit, Cas, it’s nearly nine! You’re gonna be exhausted for work tomorrow!”
Time froze. Then,
“Nope, still quiet on that front.” Sam answered, though he was grinning at Dean like he expected him to guess something.
“I’ve got you, Dean. Sleep.”
“Dean. Come in.”
Dean tried to say his name, but all that came out was a soft grunt. Even that much exhausted him and, as much as he tried to fight it, he went back under.
And finally Cas got the message, thrusting into him hard, driving him into the mattress. Dean cried out, barely making full words now, his mind on a constant loop of pleaseyesharder.
“Well, look what we have here.” Uriel was standing in the door way, a shotgun aimed at Castiel and a grin on his face. “Congratulations. You found me. Too bad you won’t be leaving.”
Dean laughed quietly to himself – he had been worried at first, but of course he shouldn’t have been. Charlie was always up for a drink with him, mostly because they hardly spent any time together.
Finally, the fourth time he woke, Dean managed to crack his eyes open. He was disorientated at first, but as his eyes began to adjust, he realised he was in a hospital room. He glanced around, confused. What the hell had happened? He could see an IV drip running into the back of his hand and frowned at it. He hated needles.
“No, we’re not. But they’ve never done half the things we have, Dean. Don’t they deserve the chance, while we’ve got the time to show them the best parts of life? The parts we enjoyed so much?”
Jack agreed compliantly, standing and following Sam to a different area of the bar.
“Uh, yeah, sure. I can do that. I’ll take the day off work. Where do you live?”
Dean rolled his eyes and walked away. The fact that the scout sign Jo held up was completely incorrect made him feel even more certain that she would do something to embarrass him, but there was no way to avoid it now. He probably should have suggested a different place to have breakfast, he realised. He wondered what Castiel would think when he realised these people were family, and how crazy they all were.
He could decline, say he was busy or something – even though he felt unhappy about lying to the man now. Castiel would accept that he had said no but would probably distance himself from Dean. And a big part of him really didn’t want to say no.
“Oh, sugar, you know I can’t answer that.” Missouri told him with a sad look. “But what if he
Dean shook his head at his brother, then glanced at the angel’s body - he realised that while he had just come in his pants like a freakin teenager, Cas was still sporting a rather impressive erection that was still pressing against his thigh.
Dean groaned in response, pressing his groin hard against Cas, finding a hard length that matched his own. The feeling of it sent curls of heat shooting up his spine and he rolled his hips, grinding their erections together with delicious pleasure.
Dean nodded slightly, trusting. Castiel smiled in response, and they said a quick goodbye before going their separate ways. Dean glanced over at the Café and saw Jo watching him with a glint in her eye, Ellen nowhere to be seen. He rolled his eyes and turned away, heading back to the car. He was absolutely not going to open that can of worms with Jo today.
“Do you want my help or not?” Charlie’s fingers paused over the keys of the laptop as she glared at him.
Dean let his head hit the floor, groaning as his cock twitched with excitement.
The words were feeding his libido now, bringing a suppressed whine of desire as he struggled to keep still, as ordered. He could feel his orgasm getting closer, tremors up and down his spine, heat coiling in his abdomen like a spring that could snap at any given moment.
“Cas, c’mon... please! I can’t lose you, not now...” Dean sobbed, closing his eyes.
“Wait. You’re saying I have four months off work... paid?”
“Alright, I think that will do for today.” The professor’s voice came unexpectedly in the quiet of the room, and Dean glanced up from the information he was reading on the laptop screen. “I have a few things I want to mention before I let you all go, and I would appreciate your full attention.”
The three all took a few minutes to let the laughter subside. Finally they’d all calmed down enough to talk normally, and Sam spoke first as he glanced at Dean.
Dean spent most of his time off for lack of a better word, moping. He had locked himself into his room on Tuesday afternoon and stayed there, ignoring Sam knocking on the door to ask if he was okay.
Instead of moving away Cas just held him tighter, and then on one of the up strokes, that damn angel flicked his tongue over Dean’s slit.
Sam shot a quizzical look at Dean, who had chosen to sit on the couch with Cas, leaving the arm chairs for Sam and Jack. Dean shrugged in response, averting his eyes quickly as a flush crept up his neck. Sam frowned at him, then glanced back at the tv, using the remote to search through the movie titles.
That single sound blew every thought out of his mind right then and there, causing an actual whimper to bubble out of his throat. Cas chuckled, prompting an indignant response from Dean. The protest died on his lips, however, as Cas had managed to slip a hand between the wall and himself, pulling Dean hard against him with a hand on his ass.
Yeah, so, not alot of action in this one, mostly talking. But, it's there for a reason and is necessary. Also new tag added and more will be added as the story moves along.
“Shit.. Fuck, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry Cas,” Dean gasped, putting some distance between them. “I didn’t mean to-“
Within moments the bonds were released, and Castiel flexed his arms as he moved them in front of him. There was still the problem of the blade, however, and Dean frowned as he looked at Bobby. The older man just shrugged, a regretful expression crossing his features.
“Yes, yes of course I want to!” Cas laughed, shaking his head. “I can’t believe how much you’ve all done for me. But yes, I would love that.”
“I’m taking lead with Charlie. She’s got a lock on Cas, so it makes sense. Bobby, you’re with us.” Suddenly Dean’s anxiety disappeared, his training coming into play as he slid into the role of leader. “Sam, Gabriel and Jo, you three stick together. Stay back, but not too far. I need you to still see and follow us. Once we can see the building, we’ll brief before we go in, but in case we can’t - Bobby, Charlie and I go in first. Whoever is in there won’t be expecting a second group. Remember, we don’t know if it’s just Uriel, or if he has help. So ears and eyes open and watch each other’s backs. Capiche?”
After he checked the messages on his phone – at least a dozen missed calls from Sam and a few texts from Charlie – he finally dragged himself away from the warmth of the bed and followed the quiet noises all the way to the kitchen. The sight that greeted him was something to remember – Cas, shirtless and wearing only sweatpants, stood over the coffee pot, apparently making two cups of coffee.
Pain and frustration suddenly gave way to a burning rage, similar to the temper that flared up the first time he’d met that presumptuous, gorgeous, infuriating bastard. Only this was more intense, fueled by sleepless nights, lack of food and long shifts. The normally very placid man slammed the tap off and stormed out of his apartment with not a care that he was still in his sleep pants and robe, his face a mask of untamed anger.
As for the story, I know there’s still some loose ends - the end is coming, but I have plans to tie up those ends first, don’t worry.
As Castiel slowly came to, the first thing he noticed was a killer headache. He groaned quietly, wincing against the pain. What the hell had happened? The last thing he remembered was...oh. He noticed now that his hands were tied behind his back, and the hard floor he laid on was moving. As he opened his eyes, he took in his surroundings with growing horror. He appeared to be in the back of a vehicle that was still driving. He swore to himself and pulled against his bonds, testing them - but they were tight, and he wasn’t getting out anytime soon.
“Man, just shoot me and get it over with.” Dean growled, pissed off now. “You win.”
Dean groaned as he got out of the impala. His leg was hurting, but he’d been warned to expect that. Even with the moon boot, he hadn’t put weight on it for a long time, so it was going to be sore. He grumbled under his breath as he turned to lock baby, not exactly looking forward to the rest of the day on phones. Well, at least it was Friday, which was a bonus. Almost the weekend.
Dean’s breath hitched as he felt a slick fingertip circling his hole, pressing gently around the rim. He was so worked up already, his cock dripping precum, and his hips rolled as he tried to push down onto Cas.
“Thanks, Cas. You didn’t have to bring me anything. Shit, you didn’t even have to come see me.” Dean frowned slightly.
“I’ll be back for you two.”
“I can’t believe how much you’ve grown Sammy, you’re massive!”
“He comes over in the afternoons to tell me that I’ve done good.” He looked away, trying not to show how much those words were meaning to him, even if he didn’t believe them. “He wears these beads, and when I was having a bad day he let me borrow them and I started counting them, like I see him do. And it helped. And, we just have a bit of a talk in the afternoons, when everyone is gone. It’s just… nice, I guess.”
“No, no, I got that part loud and clear.” Dean answered slowly, surprising him. “What I mean is that stuff about the inheritance, and him controlling your life.”
“No, I don’t mind. I’ve really enjoyed tonight, guys. I do have to get up at five, though, and it’s currently…” Sam paused as he checked his watch. “12:25. So I’m gonna head off to bed, and you guys probably should soon too.”
With that the man stormed away, leaving the two to stare at each other in furious silence. Without thinking about his actions, Castiel simply reacted - he pushed the man hard, forcing him to stumble backwards, then strode into the apartment and slammed the door behind him. He turned to set on the man again who was shocked, staring wide-eyed at Castiel. He didn’t miss the way the man’s eyes raked over him, cold and assessing.
The elevator dinged and the doors opened, to reveal the apartment block manager along with two police officers. The manager pointed at the man with a yell of “That’s him!”
“I meant a professional.”
Dean looked at Bobby and Jo with his eyebrows raised slightly - while he trusted Bobby, he was relying on the man’s word that Jo would keep it quiet. They could all end up in jail over this sort of activity.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Dean’s breath stuttered in his chest at the lustily whispered words, the kind of talk he had never imagined coming from Cas’ mouth - that he never thought he would enjoy quite so much from Cas’ mouth. He was inherently glad that Sam liked to watch movies loud, as he couldn’t hear the sinful words from the angel, nor the barely muffled whimpers and gasps from Dean.
The party went absolutely perfectly, Dean decided. Sure, there were a few mishaps, but at the end of the day everyone was happy. Dean and Castiel had just finished getting little sandwiches cut up to put with the rest of the food when Claire and Gabriel had arrived.
“This happen before he showed up here?” Bobby asked as he scribbled notes, trying not to let the worry show through.
“The hell is wrong with you, Dean?” Sam hissed, cornering his brother in the kitchen one night.
“I don’t understand...” Castiel grumbled, taking a bit longer to catch up.
“Get the tomatoes! No, over here – dude, seriously?! You threw it in the water!” Charlie yelled, frustrated but laughing.
“Wait, what? Cas, why didn’t you tell me?!” Dean asked, his eyes turning worried.
“Look I… I just wanted to say I’m sorry. You’ve been different and I know it’s my fault so…”
Finally, after what seemed an age, Dean turned and met his eyes once more. His heart dropped as he saw the tears in the man’s eyes, the slight tremble to his bottom lip. He released Dean’s hand, only to bring his own up to gently cup his cheek.
Well, he supposed Charlie was right, then. His subconscious thoughts were making themselves known, even if he wasn’t aware of them. Throughout the day, he’d just been jotting things down without looking at them. It was somewhat of a shock to see the page filled with his deepest thoughts, the things he tried to avoid, and it made his eyes sting at the edges.
Dean barely had a moment to register the mischievous glint in Castiel’s eyes before he was off, powering into his strides as though he’d been skating for years. He was momentarily frozen by shock, until his competitive side pushed through and a grin curved his lips.
“He doesn’t usually?” Castiel frowned, refraining from commenting that Dean himself had turned out pretty okay too.
Shock registered in Cas’ eyes first, before a look so tender and painful, Dean had to choke back tears. Cas raised a hand to rest on his cheek, gently brushing away the wetness.
“Ah...” Dean didn’t look so confident now, and Castiel was confused as the man turned back to the door. “I, um. I can come back later. If you’d prefer.”
“What do you mean it was an accident?” Sam frowned after a moment.
“Bang.” A low, gravelly voice that sent fire through his veins whispered.
“I’ll check the apartment.” Sam said quickly.
Castiel commented as his hand moved to the top of his denim shorts. Before Dean could reply, he brought his mouth down on one of his nipples, licking and suckling gently. He grinned slightly as he heard a soft whimper, then slowly continued kissing a trail down as his hands got the shorts open. He gently pushed the material down, taking Dean’s boxer shorts with it, until finally his erection sprang free.
Dean waited, tapping on the steering wheel along to Blue oyster cult as he waited for Charlie’s reply impatiently. Finally the alert for a new message went off, and he unlocked the phone again to read it.
“I said, Capisce?”
“Cas, I’m not gonna judge you. I know how cruel people can be and what they say. But you, you’re strong. Confident. Collected. Anxiety doesn’t define who you are, it’s just part of you. And that’s not a bad thing.” Dean stared at him, waiting for him to accept the words. Eventually Castiel smiled, and the man nodded before he continued with another question. “You get attached easily?”
“Alright, quit yelling!”
“No.”
Okay, so that explained the book. Dean smiled slightly, his fingers running over the pages. Castiel was still trying to help him. But then he remembered the envelope. He picked it up and turned it over, about to open it, when Sam’s hand covered his. He looked up, frowning slightly at Sam, who did not look happy at all.
“Hm?” He startled out of his thoughts to meet worried green depths, inches from his own.
Cas grinned and lifted himself up slightly, just enough to plant a gentle kiss on Dean’s lips. He pulled back and met his eyes, smile turning soft as he stared at the love of his life.
Dean’s next breath was sharp, suddenly wondering how Cas could put him so on edge like that. It was something he didn’t want to answer to himself.
“Jeez Dean,” Sam huffed with a laugh to break the intense atmosphere. “I think even Crowley would follow you after that speech. I’m in. Jack?”
“Hmm... That has to be a new record.” Cas answered after he popped off Dean’s cock, chuckling to himself softly as he worked the fingers inside Dean, stretching him, rubbing against that bundle of nerves.
“What?” Dean blinked, her sudden change of subject catching him off guard. “Oh. Yeah, every day. I have it here.”
They skated around the rink, holding tight onto each other. Dean’s eyes never left the angel’s blue ones as he taught him how to shift his weight, how to put some power into each glide, how to regain his balance if he felt like he would fall.
“I’ll go gentle.” Cas promised, voice trembling again with the effort of holding back.
“Oh, Dean. Besting you is not difficult when your intentions are so... obvious.”
“Hm. So, no morning nookie before coffee. Noted.” Dean answered, chuckling at the horrified expression Castiel immediately shot him.
“Cas?”
“I’m ready, I’m ready, please, Cas, need you-“ Dean broke off on a cry as Cas drove his fingers one more time against his prostate, hard.
“I will see you tomorrow.” Castiel told him and for once, the professor left the room first.
“Seriously, Sam? Skating? We’re not kids anymore.” Dean tried, hoping to head off this line of thinking.
“You made a mess.” Cas snorted with laughter. “Mine’s contained.”
“Well, what do we have here.”
“Why? Why do this?” Dean asked quietly without raising his head.
“Oh, no, that’s for our other friend. He’ll be here later.” Charlie lied smoothly.
Dean left the room quickly, not wanting to explain why he couldn’t believe the man.
“He’s taking the trash out, now can you stop avoiding the question?”
The silence was deafening. The three men just stared at the stranger in surprise, though the weapons were never lowered. Bobby glanced over at Dean and, with a gesture of his head, Dean watched him close the door and lock it again. The stranger glanced back fearfully at the door, then once more to Dean.
“Uriel, please-“
“Yeah, sure.”
Dean stood and offered a hand. With a smile, Castiel took his hand and stood, and continued to hold the offered hand. Dean paused, waiting for confirmation; Castiel nodded, then followed him out to where the police were waiting.
Dean tried to keep his breathing even as he counted his steps out carefully, slowly, in his brain. He wet his lips nervously – then remembered to breathe, drawing the air in over a count of three, trying to remain calm. He was closer now, almost to the front of the room where Castiel sat on his strange, wheelie stool. The professor twisted the beads in his hand, staring intently at his screen – and somehow just keeping his eyes on the man was keeping Dean calm enough to keep walking toward him.
“Ah! Oh... Shit... You...” Castiel gasped out, desperate for the man to do something more.
, Dean thought, wondering how the hell to explain this.
Dean sat him on the couch and, without any preamble, sat behind him and pulled Cas’ back against his chest, arms wrapping around his front. He frowned slightly - this was different, and he was going to ask about it, before Dean’s chin rested on his shoulder and he spoke softly.
“It’s been -
“Sorry. So… what happened?”
But he didn’t get to finish that sentence. Sam looked up at him, and it was then that Dean saw the tears streaming down his face. Sam didn’t look sad, though – he looked angry as all hell.
He motioned to Bobby, pointing out what he had seen. Then he pointed to three doors in turn. Holding Bobby’s gaze, he pointed to himself, and the first door, then pointed to Bobby, and around the room.
The sound that left Cas’ mouth could best be described as a cry, somewhere between grief and relief, as their lips crashed together in a desperate, passionate kiss.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Castiel gasped in air as the pressure on his throat was released. He’d lost count now how many times Uriel had choked him, releasing him just before he passed out. His eyes swam with tears, his lungs burned, and his head spun. He could hear Uriel saying something, but he couldn’t make sense of the words.
The man huffed with annoyance, shifting the toolbox he was carrying to his other hand. Castiel’s eyes were drawn to it, not having noticed it before. He wondered what this man was working on.
“You respond well to both touch and praise, I have noticed.” Castiel commented and smiled at Dean’s flush. “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I feel it’s important to use that to help you.”
“I prefer Queen, and you’re welcome.” Charlie smiled as she handed Sam his coffee and took her seat.
He leaned back against the counter, listening – and he couldn’t help noticing the song playing from Castiel’s end. It made him chuckle.
“At a gas n sip.” Castiel couldn’t understand what Dean was so worked up about. “It’s twenty four hours, so I do the morning shift. Charlie, that’s my manager, she gives me the regular hours so I can afford to live.”
“Yeah. S’good.” Dean mumbled through a mouthful of brownie. When Missouri shot him a disapproving look, he quickly swallowed before continuing. “Took baby for a drive on the weekend. That was nice.”
Castiel leaned back again, glancing up at Dean.
“So, this is where you live.” A large hulk of a man that he wished he didn’t recognise stepped out of the dark stairwell, and Castiel cursed himself for not seeing him. At his panicked expression, the man chuckled darkly. “Ah, don’t look so tense, now. If I was going to do something to you here, I would have already done so.”
He didn’t know who hit the call button, but within seconds a nurse was beside him, trying to help him calm down while she yelled for someone to page Ms. Moseley. He could hear someone screaming in anguish, and he was briefly confused - until he realised that sound was coming from him. He could hear Sam telling him it was going to be okay, his voice fading away as the darkness took over and pulled him under.
“Of course. I’m just going to finish preparing dinner so I can put it in to bake.” Castiel replied. “Do you want a drink or anything?”
“It means that our dear big brother is a complete and utter asshole.” Gabriel growled, chewing hard on the lollipop in his mouth. “He’s been lying to us, this whole time.”
“Mmhm. So, why don’t we go shower and get cleaned up?” Castiel asked.
“What do you mean, what? I saw you leave, Dean. I called out but you ignored me. What’s going on?”
By the time he got back to the wall where Castiel was still holding on, he was laughing, face alight with exhilaration. Sam and Jack were already on the rink, moving slowly and carefully.
X-X End X-X
He was dimly aware of hands holding his shoulders, shaking him - But as much as he wanted to, he couldn’t react. His body wasn’t cooperating with his mind anymore. He felt, however, the moment he was pulled against a strong body and held tight. He could hear slow, steady breathing in his ear, loud and controlled. Some part of his mind recognised it, and as he copied, the breaths slowly got steadier and deeper, until eventually he was breathing normally. Control of his body returned, and he pulled away slightly, frowning in confusion.
The first few days he’d been pretty out of it, and he didn’t remember much. He knew that Charlie had come to visit and, after plenty of sobbing and blaming herself, gotten him to sign some documents for work. She’d left not too long after, apparently pleased with herself. At first Castiel listened to Dean arguing with her about making him sign something before he had a clear mind - but oddly, Dean had gone silent when Charlie showed him the papers. He didn’t dwell on it too much, trusting Dean not to lead him astray.
Dean rolled his eyes at her, yet he got up anyway and went to the grab another two beers. When he got back to the couch he presented it to Charlie with an over the top bow and flourish.
Then all too soon it was Monday, and with the new day, back came the simmering panic.
“Sammy, just drop it, okay?” Dean grabbed his plate, loaded the eggs onto toast and took it to the table, not looking up the whole time. “Please.”
“Oh, right. Well as long as you’re okay.” Sam grinned at Dean, not missing how close the two were.
Dean. Perfect, beautiful Dean, dressed in a similar suit, following the same path toward the arch, having entered from the gate on the other side of their house. They’d designed the yard in such a way that it was symmetrical, and perfect for this occasion. Sam was leading Dean, wearing a matching suit to Charlie’s.
He couldn’t explain why, but Castiel just
“Is that what you teach your kid? That it’s okay to abuse someone if he likes them? Cause honey, that’s the stepping stones for abusive relationships. Yeah it’s natural to start with but you’re supposed to teach him that hurting people to get their attention isn’t okay. You’re not meant to make excuses and tell kids to allow abuse just because someone likes them. What’re you gonna do if he’s the one getting pushed around when he grows up? Gonna tell him it’s just because the person likes him and to deal with it?”
Eventually, he heard a soft sound – footsteps and chatter, coming up the hallway. His choice was taken away. The first group of people were approaching, coming toward the room, and they would have no time to talk. Finally he made his choice, and met Castiel’s eyes, only to answer with a single word.
“It’s nice to meet you, Dean.” The man smiled, then returned to glaring at his laptop screen. “We’ll just wait for the rest to arrive, then we’ll get started.”
“You did not know that there could be a non-sexual aspect of BDSM?” Castiel asked, tilting his head to the side in an adorably cute confused expression.
They spent the next ten minutes discussing and agreeing on the rules - eventually writing a list that they all signed off on, very formally.
“Fantastic!” Dean slapped the table with both hands, grinning from ear to ear. “We’re goin out. Gear up, boys.”
Castiel looked up at his lover - into worried, tired green eyes. He sighed softly to himself, slowly lifting himself out of the passenger seat as he braced himself on the frame of the impala with one hand. His other arm was in a sling, mostly to stop him moving it and damaging the shoulder wound or his fractured arm.
“Please, if you’re going to do this, just do it. Finish it.” Tears slipped from his eyes as he admitted the inevitable outcome.
“Uh… Yeah, okay. Thanks Charles.” Dean glanced at his watch, surprised that it was almost eight. “Hey you better go log on. I gotta get to this training. Catch up later?”
“Fuck Cas! Ye- Shit.. Fuck, hard- harder babe, please, please...” Dean babbled, alternating between screaming out curses and sobbing pleas.
“Wait, Bobby, do you mean you want us to keep these?” Dean asked incredulously as he stared at the heavy, but beautiful weapon in his hand. At Bobby’s nod, he shook his head. “No, no we couldn’t - these are expensive, Bobby. I can’t pay you back.”
Dean shrugged one shoulder and dropped his gaze, twisting his fingers together. He honestly wasn’t sure what happened – he never knew what it was, he just called it his ‘episodes’. He couldn’t control when it happened, and there wasn’t always a trigger. It just comes on suddenly, exhausts him, then it’s gone.
Dean seemed hesitant, circling around his hole until eventually with a growl of frustration, he pushed his hips back and Dean’s finger breached him. He moaned at the intrusion - this wasn’t his first time but somehow, this was more.
He glanced back up to Castiel to show the man that he’d left them there - Castiel would probably notice them missing soon - only to see the man still watching him. Slowly, Castiel glanced at the beads, then back at Dean, and he nodded slightly. He was letting Dean keep them, for the moment, it seemed. Dean gave him a half smile, then Castiel shifted his gaze elsewhere, focusing on the other students.
“Yeah, thanks, Bobby.” Sam echoed. “This means a lot.”
Dean thought he heard a thoughtful humm from Castiel – but he couldn’t be sure, and he didn’t question it. Aside from that, there were no further words. Glancing up, he realised Castiel was still waiting patiently for him to answer the question. He frowned slightly, trying to sort out the thoughts in his head and his current feelings so that he could voice them, without sounding completely insane.
Castiel stood from his seat, glancing first at Gabriel, then Dean, judging their reactions to his rash statement. Neither of them looked happy.
So instead he took a deep breath, and as he let it out slowly through his nose, he took the shot - and missed. His jaw dropped in stunned silence as the white sailed straight past the ball he’d aimed for and into the side pocket.
“Dean-o! My favourite brother-in-law!” Gabriel called out as he plonked beside Dean.
He was whining now, hips moving without control, trying to direct those fingers to that- and oh, shit, he found it, that perfect little bundle of nerves that forced his back to arch and sent a filthy moan out of his throat.
Later that night, when Castiel was comfortably in bed with nothing but silence surrounding him, he broke. The tears flowed freely, wracking his body as he wondered what kind of person he had become.
Dean had removed Castiel’s shirt, and had been reaching to remove the singlet beneath, which meant his hands were held still on Castiel’s waist. Cas stayed silent, waiting until Dean lifted his eyes to meet his. His eyes were unguarded, and Castiel’s breath hitched as he saw the deep worry and despair in them.
“Dean,” Castiel laughed as he stood and helped the confused man up off the floor. “Tomorrow is my day off again. Remember?”
He was leaning over Charlie’s shoulder, staring at the laptop screen as it played several different camera streams at once. His fingers tapped impatiently on the table, and he completely missed Charlie’s eye roll as she sipped at her coffee.
The group agreed, and split to head to their respective places. Cas sighed as he slipped into the booth, pressing himself against the wall. He picked up a menu, but he could barely read the words. His hands shook, and he felt light headed.
Lost. Dark. Pain. Air. Breathe, can’t breathe. It hurts. His arms hurt, they’re tied up, trapped. He can feel the tears leaking from his eyes, despite that they’re screwed shut as tight as possible. He can hear someone crying out, begging to stop, just stop.
He cradled Dean’s face in his hands, pushing him back so that he could stare into red rimmed, wet green eyes. His thumbs gently moved over his cheeks, wiping away the tears that had been falling.
But after a long, exhausting week and a really bad day, the smallest thing sets Castiel off and sends him running back to Dean.
There was a small kitchen, a table, and a couch. Someone had been in here recently, judging by the track marks through the thick layer of dust. He scanned the kitchen and table - signs of use in the kitchen, but only one seat was clean at the table. That was a good sign.
After his nasty words, Castiel decides to make it up to Dean with lunch.
“If you start that, I’ll never get any work done.”
“Yes sir, 28 days after we receive your mail. Now, was there anything further I could assist you with today?”
“I would prefer if you didn’t call yourself names, Dean.” Castiel told him firmly, and Dean nodded slightly. “May I take a look? This bandage is far too loose.”
“Hey Sammy.” Dean croaked and god, his voice sounded rough.
Dean huffed out a disbelieving laugh, which made Castiel frown with confusion.
“Yeah. I mean for example, the paint is peeling off the walls sure. But the walls themselves are solid - no patch work needed, just a cleanup and few new coats of paint. These cupboards are solid, they just need a bit of fill, new doors and hinges, and they’ll be fine. I’ve seen places that pretty much the whole insides needed to be gutted.”
“Apologies, Sam. I can talk now. So what did Bobby tell you?” He pressed a button on the coffee machine, starting the brew.
“I gave it to him when he left, but I didn’t tell him it had a gps tracker in it. I was worried about him, and I wanted to be able to find him. Didn’t think to check it before I left home, I’ve never really had trouble finding him-“ He paused, clicking a few buttons as he bit down on the sucker. He typed some more, then growled angrily. “Damn, can’t remember the password.”
Images flashed through his mind, imagining that it was Cas’ hands on him. Cas’ fingers gently moving down his legs, tickling up his inner thighs. Cas’ blue eyes staring up at him as his fingertips gently stroked up from the base of his cock, circling around the tip teasingly. Cas’ palm that cupped his balls, even as his other hand formed a firm grip around his erection and started stroking slowly, teasingly.
“No!” The word left him before he could even think of an explanation for his behaviour. “It’s just..”
“Here, use this.” Charlie pulled her top shirt off, leaving her in a singlet, and handed it over to Dean. At his confused look, she quickly explained. “Once you remove the blade, it will bleed. You have to stem the flow.”
Warning: This chapter contains the description of a minor panic attack.
He barely heard Bobby reciting the necessary words as the ceremony began. He was lost in Dean’s eyes, his thumb rubbing small circles as he held his partners hands. How was it that this person had stumbled into his life so dramatically and changed every aspect, to bring them to this point?
As the phone rang, he noticed Sam had already started the machine and a fresh pot of coffee waited for him.
“Don’t talk. Just focus on feeling my breathing and heart rate.”
“And apparently have random bouts of rage that leads to hot as hell sex with handy men.” Dean commented with a smirk.
She shrugged in a way that did not, in any way, convince him that she would listen. Dean rolled his eyes again as he watched her leave – and then she was gone and it was just him and Castiel left in the room. He glanced over at the man who was watching him carefully. What was he going to say? Apologise for being tired? As it turned out, he didn’t need to worry, as Castiel spoke first.
“Are you gonna.. Let me have a turn now?” Dean breathed, starting to move toward the angel.
Castiel, for his part, had become apprehensive as they arrived at the skatel. Even now, while Dean was helping him ‘gear up’, he was nervous. Skating looked easy, but now that he was here, he wasn’t sure he would be good at it. Still, he thought as he noticed Dean glancing at his brother and Jack on another bench, the hunter had promised to help him.
And of course, he convinced himself it was just a coincidence that he’d thought of Castiel in that moment.
“So, what’s the plan here?” Castiel asked quietly, coming to Dean’s side. “Michael won’t be happy with new faces.”
By the time he finished and slipped the ring onto Dean’s finger, tears were running down his cheeks freely. The look Dean gave him was indescribable as he reached out and placed a hand over Cas’ heart silently. Then, Sam stepped forward to pass a ring to Dean, and Bobby spoke his name. Dean cleared his throat with a nod, and stared at Castiel, emotion swimming in his eyes.
He licked his parched lips as he looked around the room, searching for anything that could help him in this situation. There was one small window, and he couldn’t see any sign of civilisation through it. His heart dropped lower with every detail he took in.
“Oh, Castiel. You should have thought of that before. You know the rules of this engagement.” Michael pulled his face into a sympathetic look, which came out as more of a grimace. This time, Castiel wasn’t buying his fake sympathy. “Had you only checked in with me, this wouldn’t have to happen. But I can’t trust you now, you see? This isn’t my ideal solution, of course, but I must protect you and our family. So you both will need to return home with me, immediately. Of course, I will arrange the sale of your apartment, along with transport of your personal effects.”
Dean cracked another beer, the seventh or eighth he’d had so far. Honestly, he’d lost count by this point, but he knew he was feeling relaxed and certainly a little buzzy. He was sitting on the edge of a multi-level parking lot that he’d found, six levels high. His feet hung over the edge, swinging without a care as he stared down at the long drop. He’d managed to find a spot where the fence surrounding the top level was broken and was sitting on the edge, enjoying the slight rush it brought. He’d already had his episode, dealt with it, and now he was just sitting on an edge getting drunk as hell and knowing how dangerous a position he was in, but not caring.
Castiel glanced over at Dean, then back up at Bobby and smiled. “Yes sir. I will.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I hope so, man. I just-“ Dean stopped and shook his head, fighting back the overwhelming sadness. “I dunno. I just.. wish everything would go right for a change. Seems like everything keeps going bad around me.”
Despite his words, there was nothing gentle about this kiss. He moved his lips against Dean’s, passionate and heated at first, but the movements quickly became rougher, possessive as he licked into Dean’s mouth, enjoying the soft groan he drew from the man.
“Sam...” Dean’s face contorted into a surprised look, not sure what to say to that.
“Where the hell did you even get paintball guns, Sam??”
Dean stared back at him, a pleased smile lifting his lips up. He leaned forward and they were kissing again, more heated than before. Castiel’s dick twitched in interest and he moaned softly against the man’s lips as his hands moved under his shirt, splaying out across the soft skin on his sides.
When their lips met, it was nothing like before. This was gentle, almost hesitant. Castiel’s other hand came up to cup his face as he lightly pressed their lips together, letting out a soft sigh as he did. Dean whimpered softly as he pressed forward, wanting to feel Castiel’s arms around him – the man didn’t disappoint, immediately wrapping around him and holding tight as their lips moved together.
Once lunch break rolled around, he and Castiel ate together in the meeting room. Castiel asked him if he’d thought of a safe word – Dean had chosen ‘Impala.’ Of course. Castiel smiled in response, then told him his own safe word was simply ‘Red’. Castiel explained that he was to use his safe word if he found himself in a situation where he needed to stop immediately, without discussion. Once Dean agreed to use it if needed, they moved on.
“Yeah, well, I’ll also freeze all of your bank accounts and have you blacklisted from every place in the area. Maybe play with your criminal record a bit.”
Okay, so it's been a long week - as you can see by the title of the chapter that I couldn't even think of.
“Dean-“
Dean frowned at Charlie, but she just shrugged as if to say ‘What was I supposed to tell him?’. He just shook his head, but smiled at her briefly and nodded his head toward the door. She seemed to understand what he was saying and after a moment, she stood.
“Hey, you leave baby alone. She’s not just a car, she’s a lady.”
“Harder,” Castiel gasped against his neck, licking and biting at the sensitive skin. “Fuck, Dean..”
“So get this. The lawyer thinks we have a case. Even though Castiel quit, he thinks if we get a judge that’s willing to listen to why, then we’ll have a chance.”
“Dean, I can manage the car door by myself.” Castiel grumbled moodily.
The doctor chuckled and shook his head, which was the precise moment Sam and Charlie walked back into the room. Sam was carrying a tray of coffee cups, and thank god there were three of them. Dean couldn’t wait to drink coffee again – but the doctor was already frowning, apparently having noticed the same thing.
They moved together, Dean pressing his hips down as Cas drove into him, hitting his prostate on every thrust and drawing delicious moans from his lips. Dean was losing in, unable to keep himself quiet or hold still. As the tension built, Dean slipped a hand down to wrap fingers around his cock. The simple pressure had him crying out as his hand moved in time with Castiel’s hard thrusts.
The angel did hear it, however, judging by a soft groan and his hand tightening almost painfully on Dean’s cock. That slight pain, however, sent the pleasure shooting to another level that Dean hadn’t even known existed. He was trembling now, his entire body vibrating where he sat, and he didn’t know how much longer he could handle this.
Dean looks for his notebook, but can’t find it. Charlie has a conversation with Castiel, and Dean finally has a breakdown in front of him.
“Boy, I knew you was thick sometimes, but I never took you for stupid.” Dean’s head shot back up to stare at Bobby, who smiled. “You really think I’d give a damn about your preferences? I don’t care about that, never did. An’ I never left. Damn, I woulda brought you to live with me if I could. But your dad, well... When I found out what he did, I tried to knock some sense into him. Didn’t work, an’ he cut me off. Said if I come near the house he’d have me shot.”
With that, Dean turned and stormed back into the house, leaving the woman and her kid in stunned silence. He noticed Castiel and Gabriel standing on the porch, watching him with shocked expressions – but he didn’t pause, too angry to talk about it straight away.
Dean glanced at Cas’ body - a shock running through him as he realised Castiel had been hit seven times. Exactly the same as him. That, of course, meant they were tied, assuming the other two had been hit more times. Dean was sure he had hit Sam at least eight times, by himself. Jack he wasn’t sure about.
“Dean?! Are you okay? Bobby called, what happened? Are you-“
“Wait, what?” Dean sat up, scrubbing at his cheeks while he looked at Bobby, confused. “You- Dad- But he said you left. Didn’t want nothin’ to do with me, ‘cause of... How I was...” He shot a glance at Castiel, and his head fell. “How I am.”
“It... could have been him, I suppose. I don’t have the answer, Sam, I apologise.” Cas answered this time, linking his own hands together as he worried.
“Your notebook.”
Sam snorted with laughter, standing up. “Yep. You should know by now, Cas. He gets all excited, when we’ve won and it seems like it’s all over - and then something comes and screws it up.”
Sam laughed, throwing an arm over his shoulder in a short but affectionate man hug as the three walked toward their respective bedrooms.
“Dean? Dean!” Castiel’s voice cut through his thoughts and brought the present back into focus.
Crouching down, the three made their way through the shrubs and trees, keeping themselves relatively hidden. Charlie stowed the phone and pulled out a gun of her own; Bobby and Dean already had theirs drawn. Dean moved stealthily, keeping his eyes peeled for any sound or movement, but there was none.
“You’re safe, Dean. You’re here, with me, and you’re safe. Just breathe.”
“I have to go now, but thank you for joining me this morning. It has been lovely.”
“I said, I want to come and help you in the apartment.” Castiel repeated, taking a small bite of bacon as he pushed his diary across the table.
“Look, Dean, you should talk to him. But if it goes wrong, just remember we’re here for you okay? Don’t shut us out. Don’t shut me out.” Sam told him lightly with a pleading expression.
Dean grumbled internally, but still made his way over to the commotion quickly. He had to hand it to Claire, she was pretty daunting as she stood there with her hands on her hips, glaring daggers that could kill at the boy. God, he hoped he wasn’t going to have to tell her off, because that wasn’t his place.
“Then…” Dean felt tears prick at his eyes and bit his lip, taking a moment to fight them back before he continued. “Why have you been avoiding me? You barely even look at me now and I know I'm broken but-” He choked off a sob, trying not to break down again.
“Dean, if you ever need to talk, or just need a break… Let me know, okay?” Castiel glanced up and caught his eyes for a moment. “I want you to know that I will be completely understanding if you wish to ask for anything.”
By the time he lowered himself to the bed, Dean was in a serious mood again. He watched, bemused, as the man fussed over him - he brought water and painkillers, he fluffed the covers, he was ever so gentle as he helped to remove Cas’ clothes so that he could sleep comfortably.
“Bring me in?” He stared at Gabriel, confused. “But why would he- Oh.”
“You’ll be a pro in no time.” Dean grinned and clapped him on the shoulder in a totally platonic manner.
him. Those eyes made him want to spill every secret and trust this stranger with his thoughts, his fears, his very life.
“Then we should do that now,” Gabriel interrupted, noticing the change in Michael’s demeanour, the telltale shifting in his seat that showed his discomfort. “Michael, you’d have that on hand, wouldn’t you? You’re always so prepared. Just show Cas, then we can go.”
“You go get your man, Dean. And don’t let him screw it up.” Ellen told him as she walked beside him, then held the café door open for him. “I’d be willing to bet he’s at that bench along the stream right about now.”
“Sure can do.” Bobby nodded, and smiled at him. “I’m damn proud of you, boy. Looks like you’re doing well. And you-“ Here he pointed at Castiel, who stared back worriedly. “You take care of this boy. He needs you.”
“...Gabriel?” He gasped, his eyes going wide at the sight of his brother. “When- How did you find me? What are you doing here?”
“Dean, stop!” His hand shot to Dean’s cheek, forcing him to look at him again. Forcing him to see the want and the passion in his own eyes. “Please, stop. I need you.”
They stared at each other, both breathing hard from exertion and.. something else, Dean realised, shifting his thighs uncomfortably. A moment later he heard Castiel’s sharp intake of breath, and his eyes widened slightly. Feeling incredibly bold, he shifted again - and this time he felt the hardness pressed against his thigh, his thoughts confirmed as a quiet groan came from Castiel’s gritted teeth.
I’m loving the comments, please keep it up, my heart is soooo fluffy! Any critique is welcome too, if it will help me better my writing I will appreciate it.
God he wanted to just take him, give in to primal desire. But he had to be absolutely certain. He leant forward, capturing Dean’s lips for another filthy kiss as they ground together roughly, then moved down to nip at his sensitive spot on his neck. His hands moved down, gently sliding his shorts down further. Dean squirmed, eventually managing to kick his shorts off with breathless pants as Castiel continued to lavish his neck.
Castiel pursed his lips as Dean revealed what he now realised was an abusive childhood. The biggest shock, however, was that Dean was talking about it so matter of factly. There was no emotion in his voice, and he didn’t seem to feel anything about it. As though it were normal.
3 - No loitering in one position for longer than five minutes at a time, players must keep moving.
His hands came up to hold cradle Castiel’s face, fear shooting through him as the man’s head rolled limply. Had he arrived seconds too late? Tears sprung to his eyes as he looked the man over, taking in the various injuries. His fingers stroked gently over the bruised skin of his face, his other hand gently shaking his shoulder to rouse him.
Castiel comes home. More is revealed about his family and plans are put into place.
And despite how much he claimed to hate chick flick moments, something in Dean’s soul soared then, set free by his proclamation. Their kisses became deeper, more loving and less desperate, despite the rest of their clothes slowly shedding until they were both pressing together, stark naked.
And that was the first time he’d had an episode.
They cried out together as Dean sunk down hard on Castiel’s cock. Dean curled over Castiel, panting for breath against the burn and sting as his nails dug hard into skin. Castiel panted as he desperately tried not to move, for fear of hurting the man more than he obviously already had.
Dean tried to pull himself together as he turned back to his screen. Regardless of what happened next, this one thing he could at least accept with dignity, he thought. He mechanically closed down all of the programs on his computer, logged off, and waited until the screen went black before he gathered his things and stood.
“Uh… hey.” Dean mumbled, looking down for a moment. “Can I… can I sit?”
“Been awhile, huh?” Castiel teased, repeating Dean’s words back to him.
“I’m sorry, Dean. You know I didn’t mean-“
“Dean.” Castiel stopped him and surprised Dean with a sudden warm hug, his arms wrapping tight around Dean. “You’ve got nothing to be sorry for. I saw everything, and I appreciate what you did. You were right – and I asked them to leave and not to contact us again. Both her and her son’s behaviour was entirely inappropriate.”
“Oh, Jo? Don’t embarrass me.” Jo glanced at him with a grin that did not make Dean feel better in any way. “Seriously.”
10 - In case of impending apocalypse, Poughkeepsie.
The two went silent, staring at each other miserably. Castiel realised then that it was a good time to leave them alone, so that they could talk freely. He knew Dean didn’t mind him being there, but Sam didn’t know him. Yes, it would be better to leave them be, at least for twenty minutes or so, just to clear the air on this bit. He formed a plan, and within a few moments he had the kitchen trash bag in his hands and was clearing his throat to get their attention.
“Are you certain?” Cas pulled back, searching his eyes, face betraying clear shock. “That is... very different, from what you are used to. We don’t have to go there, Dean.”
As he reached up to Dean, he suddenly found his wrists in a strong grip yanked above his head and pinned down. He stared up in surprise at Dean, meeting hard eyes that made him unsure if he should be worried or not. Yet his cock twitched, hardening further with excitement at this turn of events.
As he prepped, he found his mind wandering to his budding friendship with Dean. It was strange, really, how their relationship had progressed. When he first met the man, he had hated him with a passion. Somehow, and very quickly, that hate had changed. It wasn’t the moment they had sex - no, he had still hated Dean even then, as bad as that was. But somewhere along the line, something had shifted. He found himself considering Dean’s reaction tonight, hoping he would like what Castiel had decided to make.
The group confront Michael to try and stop him taking Castiel away
“What does that mean, exactly?” Castiel asked, brow furrowed in confusion.
“...you’re welcome.” Charlie replied quietly. “Okay, Kevin, I’m gonna need you to get your computer out too. We want this done as quickly as possible.”
“Shit, Cas..” Dean finally muttered, his limbs still shaking.
Dean shook his head, but he couldn’t speak. The tears finally fell freely, and he choked back a sob – then he felt Castiel’s arms wrap around him in a strong grip, pulling him forward to rest against his chest. Dean buried his face into Castiel’s shoulder, shaking as he sobbed uncontrollably.
“That makes no sense, Dean.”
“No? Castiel, you know the-“
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean? What are you doin’ here on a weekend?”
“Gabriel, he’s missing.” Dean turned and snapped at him.
Castiel gasped out, his vision going white as he felt Dean clench around him. His balls drew up tight, then fire shot through his cock as he emptied himself into him, bucking and crying out as the intense pleasure overtook him.
His fingers worked their way up Cas’ sides, brushing over the sensitive skin on their way up. He brushed the pads of his fingers over the angel’s nipples, grinning into his mouth as he pulled a groan in response.
Dean rolled his eyes and held out the hand he’d hurt, trying to ignore Sam’s poking and prodding. He’d been trying to hammer a picture hook into the wall, to hang one of the pictures he had framed, but missed the nail and hit his hand instead. It still hurt like a bitch, and he grit his teeth against the pain while Sam checked it over.
“Dean, I got one!” He exclaimed with excitement.
“You did great today, Dean.”
Once he could continue he leaned forward again and flicked the tip of Dean’s cock with his tongue, swirling it around the head before taking Dean down again. The moans were louder now, and he could feel Dean watching him as he writhed against the wall. It sent thrills of excitement through him, and he caught himself groaning throatily as he bucked into his own hand, fire curling in his belly.
”Uh, Cas.. You didn’t...”
“What-“ Castiel stepped forward, startled.
Fast as he could, he flicked his phone into his hand and typed out a simple sos text, put Mr. Jackson, the apartment manager, as the recipient, then locked it without sending. He had learnt after the incident with Uriel to be prepared - now he would be able to just unlock the phone and send the text if anything went wrong. He hid his phone in his hand slightly behind him and prepared for the confrontation with slow, steady breaths.
But when he looked up, that thought slid out of his mind.
“Hey, Dean. How you doing today?” Charlie asked casually, her voice not giving away too much concern.
Despite his intentions, Dean’s hips bucked forward, a silent plea for more as he bit down on his lip hard enough to leave a mark, muffling the heavy breathing and the whimper in his throat. Cas’ head shifted, slowly so as not to draw suspicion, until his lips were by Dean’s ear.
“I- Well, it’s been awhile but.. It’s not all my fault, he doesn’t call me either!”
The sentence trailed off into silence as the two men just stared at each other. Castiel found himself leaning closer, his eyes trained on those perfect lips. He felt the sensation of butterflies in his stomach as they drew closer, tasting Dean’s breath on his lips. Despite their interactions to date, this was the first time he honestly wanted to kiss the man without being angry. His hand came up to settle on Dean’s hip, gently brushing over the material there.
