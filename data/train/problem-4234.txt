"I know some of the rules, but I've never seen a game before," Castiel answered him.
“What is happening to you, Novak,” Garth went on, “is you are changing into your final form. Your wings will grow as will another one or two pairs of wings. With the way your wings are growing, I would say you’ll only have two sets of wings. You are a seraphimal-deva, which is better known as a seraphim or a seraph. It’s named after a subspecies of angels, who in some parts of the world’s religious population, have two sets of wings.”
"RAVENCLAW"
At the end of the day, Castiel was told to stand up out of bed and stretch his wings.
Said just before the Empty took you
The man nodded. "Well, I'm Aaron Dolan, and this is Seth Elliot. We've come to ask you a few questions about your mother's untimely death."
"Oh, okay," Charlie replies.
you have to try Ellen's pies. They are even better than the ones here. And the ones here are hella good." Dean grinned.
Cas shakes his head. "I don't think she is killing them. I think they are killing themselves. Freyja seems to be affecting people with her abilities, but accidentally- or purposefully, I'm not sure- putting too much. If the person someone loves doesn't love them back and is affected by Freyja, it's might be that the affected human will either get angry and kill the one keeping them from their lover or get upset and kill themselves. That means there is likely others killed. Search for those who have killed and been sent to jail in the past few weeks."
Cas is relieved to actually see Dean in the room and not some random demon who is trying to kidnap him or something. Dean has his arms behind his back, like he is hiding something.
The house elf jumped. "Oh, hello Master Winchester. Mylie apologizes for waking you. Master Lupin has asked Mylie to bring Master Winchester and Master Novak their Hogwarts uniforms." Mylie the house elf explained what she was going in the supposedly secret Panic Room.
The angel walks in the room, looking a confused as to what exactly Dean is doing. "Dean? What is this?" He asks.
Out of the fire and into the frying pan -
"No. I just asked Jack to bring him up here so I can beat the shit out of him."
A short time earlier, Castiel woke up himself. He was still in his clothes from the day before and grumbled about how they were all wrinkled, mentioning that he would really like to learn and ironing spell. Castiel got up out of bed and looked over to see that Adam and Benny were talking quietly together. They seemed to get along nicely. So maybe that would leave Castiel alone.
Jody nods, saying it's ok before she officially starts the class. The Professor goes over the rules and the things they would be going over in class. Once these things were done and sorted, Jody said that they could go over some very simple charms.
So the Novak kids were left to themselves. And that's mostly how they like it.
The boy shook his head and Dean couldn't help but take notice of his bright blue eyes.
Sirius nodded. “Well, I think they are very cool birthmarks. They suit you well.”
The waiter gives a nod and leads the pair back farther into the restaurant. He takes them to a table and sets two menus down. "A worker will be with you shortly. Enjoy!"
Dean crinkles his nose at her. "I'm a half-blood. Mother was a witch, father was a muggle."
The cake is brought in and the four go to the kitchen to eat it. Jody has also brought a candle to have an official birthday party.
“Quick, lets run,” Gabe said jokingly.
Breakfast was finished up, the two younger boys went to help Ellen cook while Dean and Castiel went upstairs to work on assigned schoolwork.
The Bunker seems quiet. Cas hopes that he got the right last place of the scavenger hunt. If he did not, that is probably a bad thing. The Angel looks around, trying to see if there is a final note hidden somewhere that he didn't see before.
"Sorry for scaring you, Charlie. I just stayed with Dean for the night, that's all," Cas explains to her. He glanced over at Dean, who was still acting cocky about being correct about Charlie's thoughts on what happened to Cas when he didn't show.
"I do."
Dean shakes his head. "No, he's in the shower right now. What's up?"
The woman nods, opening the door to allow the pair of "agents" to come inside of her home.
Dean and Cas shared a look. The Potters would be coming over? Harry Potter and his family would be coming over.
Dean Winchester - Cameron Brodeur
Lupin nodded and left the two boys alone, thinking it would probably be better if Dean talked to Cas instead of the teacher.
With some paper ready, Dean sat down on his bed and started to write the letter to his brother.
"I do know, because I went through a situation much like he did. I may not have wings on my back, but I too was different from everyone my age. I was bitten by a werewolf at a young age. I had to go through my early life believing I was a monster. However, someone quite similar to Dean proved that I am not what I believe," Lupin replied.
Maze crossed her arms. "The to-be Hufflepuff seeker? I'm on the Slytherin team. I play keeper."
James, Albus, Teddy, Alex, Claire, Gabriel, Sam, Dean and Cas all dressed up for the cold and went outside. Claire, Albus, Sam, Gabriel and Alex all went over and played in the snow. James and Teddy stood to the side, talking. James pictured Teddy like the older sibling he always wanted, so the Potter looked up to him. And James was one of those kids that if he looks up to you, he’s never leaving your side.
Gabe looked over at him. His younger brother had to only be five at the time. “Why do you keep those out?” He asked. “Pops doesn’t like them one bit.”
"What do you think we'll be doing this class?" Dean asks his friend. "Because last class was full on weird but super fun."
“You don’t have to feel like you have to hide around me, Cas. You’re my friend and nothing can change that,” Dean says.
Finally, Dan unlocked the final ball. The golden snitch. Dan informed Cas that this was the ball he would have to find to end the game. Dan said that the Hufflepuffs had an advantage. Because, Hufflepuffs.. are particularly good finders. Castiel already knew about the snitch and the other balls as well as the positions on a Quidditch team. He had just never seen a game before. That was until he got caught using his wings, after that he didn’t really play much. When he did, he would use a broom.
"Oh, right. Where are my manners? The name's Meg. Meg Masters. I'm a first year," the girl introduces herself. "Now this is the part where you two introduce yourselves," Meg continues when the two boys just stare at her.
"Nice costume, Novak," Benny said.
Sam notices what Cas is holding. “Whoa, is that your broom? You fly?” Sam asks Cas, stepping towards him a bit.
The final week of school came sooner than Castiel thought it would.
Charlie knows what Cas is hinting at. "I think he does. Hell, I hope he does. You two would be cute together."
Dean put his hands up in surrender. "No, I didn't hear anything. I saw you in there like two minutes ago. I was looking for you and Charlie so I decided to wait out here. I didn't hear a word."
Garth continued, “however, there is another situation where a mate will just pop up out of thin air. These mates are considered true mates. And when a deva finds their true mate, they go through a change. A change that brings them to their final form. A final form for devas, are rare, but they happen. When this happens, the deva reaches their full strength their your wings.”
The mother angrily hands Castiel the note and is on her way to leave in seconds.
Dean looked at her for a moment, a smile growing on his lips. "Sure. You can tag along." He grinned at Lisa. He and Lisa walked through the exit of the common room and out into the halls of Hogwarts.
The man stood there for a moment before lowering his wand and whispering "facti sant cherubi." A bright light erupted from the man's wand.
James was serving detention for something he got into trouble for. Peter was in the library with a (very hot) Ravenclaw tutor to help him stay caught up with his classes. So it was just Remus and Sirius hanging around with nothing to do.
"I... fine, Bradbury, you win. Who should I kiss?" Dean asks, finally giving in to Charlie's magical powers of convincing people.
You made me so much better
Cas shrugs a bit. "Whenever," he says quietly.
"Croatoan, Jacob"
Dean is silent for a moment, just staring at Cas and looking into the angel's blue eyes. After a moment, he hugs Cas again. "Good. Because I love you too."
Dean whips around. He had to check that he isn't just hearing things. "Cas?" Dean asks quietly, looking at the man now in front of him.
Castiel sat down in his beanbag chair. He smiled at Dean and threw the rather large blanket over the two of them. Cas’ eyes had already started to fall when he whispered, “goodnight, Dean.”
Twelve years I’ve known you
Inside the classroom, Castiel's anxiety was going through the roof and Lupin could tell. A hand ran through Cas' short black hair. "I'm not going to be able to live like this for the next seven years, Professor. For you, it's once every month. For me, it's every day. And I understand that you had your challenges as a kid, but it's really hard for me. And I... I just don't know what to do."
The game was currently 60 to 80, with the Slytherins in the lead. They were about an hour into the game. Slytherin and Hufflepuff were a pretty good match for each other. Some of the Slytherins did play rough, but the Hufflepuffs mostly didn’t, yet it was still a moderately fair match.
There's silence throughout the room. "Go on," Jody says and the practicing starts.
Charlie and Cas went back over to the Hufflepuff table. Charlie, muttering about how she sometimes hates rules. Cas sat down with the red-headed muggle born and waited for the okay to start eating.
Bags were packed and students were ready to leave. Cas was back in his trench-coat. The pure-blood quickly ran up to Dean when he spotted the other boy, his coat flying behind him. "Hi," Cas huffed when he reached Dean. In one hand, Cas carried his suitcase filled with clothes and his other items. In his other hand, he carried his new broom.
"That'll be three sickles, sweetie." The candy lady got out a cauldron cake and three chocolate frogs for Castiel. Cas gave her the money. "And what about you two? What can I get you?"
The Winchester took the other boy's hand. "Hey it's ok. We have two options now. We can tell these guys and they can have another lead, or we keep it to ourselves and try to handle it ourselves. It's up to you." Dean spoke softly to Cas.
"Where are we going?" Castiel asks, honestly curious.
Dean quickly looks over the instructions before pouring a bit of the lotion onto his hand. Dean’s hands travelled through Cas’ wings. The lotion easily sunk in, making Cas’ wings more fluffy and shiny.
The two boys walked back into the room, Cas holding on to Dean's hand to try and stay stable. The Ministry men and Sam looked up as they walked in. They sat down in their seats and Cas looked over at Dean, silently asking him to explain it.
Cas wasn’t expecting Professor McGonagall to show up. He wasn’t sure if he should feel relaxed or confused. So he just stayed quiet.
"Bye, Gabe. Take care of our siblings, okay?" Cas says. Gabriel nods, "yeah yeah, I know. Have fun, Cassie."
"Hello there. Can I get a iced espresso, please?" He asks Castiel.
It was around eight o'clock on Saturday that the Great Hall changed it's set up. The first week of school had gone moderately well. There were loads of struggles, sure, but each student was adapting. All the tables previously in the Great Hall had all disappeared and were replaced with hundreds of sleeping bags for students to take.
"I don't think," Cas says, "I know. It's the same guy!"
"Is this about Dean, what you called me here for? I felt him arrive in Heaven a little while ago. Do... do you want me to go talk to him?" Castiel asks. The angel was really just concerned about Dean.
Cas instantly remembers the barn he had first met Dean in. He remembers the moment perfectly. The way he had been so different back then. Such a loyal little angel, he was. Now look how far he's fallen.
But now how am I to forgive you from leaving me?
After a few drinks, the three visitors left. And then Dean was alone. Again.
"Then," the officiant says, "you may kiss the bride and you may kiss the groom."
"And you?" The candy lady turned to Charlie.
"John Watson."
Castiel looked up from the floor and locked eyes with the Professor. "Wings," was all Cas managed to get out through his pain. The terrible feeling in Cas' back was getting worse and worse each second.
When you first laid a hand on me in Hell,
Sam has Eileen. Michael has Adam. Jack is currently thinking that he may be an ace/aro, but he has Heaven to run so he's too busy to be in a relationship just yet. Jody, Donna and the girls are busy hunting. Garth continues to let his family grow. Rowena happily rules Hell.
Wind flying through our hair
Cas opened his letter and took out three different pieces of paper. He smiled, already knowing who they were from.
The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher smiles at them. Gabriel and Sam race into the room to meet their to-be Hogwarts teacher. Gabe made a look when he noticed Cas still had his wings out around Lupin.
Castiel looked up at Dean, his blue eyes watery and his face red.
"Oh?" Ellen encourages him to go on.
The professor sighs. "Yes, dear, you may go to the bathroom. But hurry back, I don't want you to miss any important rules, okay?"
It's a few more minutes before Castiel comes back into the room, new clean clothes on. His hair is wet and all over the place. By now, Dean had put his pictures and the pencil case away. The Winchester was sitting on his bed.
Dean gave her a look.
Castiel listened to Lupin explain to him about his mother. The deva could see the sad look in his professor's eyes. Cas felt sad himself. Except he felt more angry than sad. The way Lupin explained Vicky Novak, it didn't seem like she would be the type of mother to abandon her child like that. But she did. She left without a word. And to Cas, it was because of him and only because of him.
“If you’re staying, I’m staying.” Dean said.
Lupin thought for a moment, debating on if to tell Castiel or not. "Well, Garth told me that if a deva doesn't find its mate, the wings would start to hurt, and loose some feathers, before becoming very frail and weak, and then loose all feathers. So that hasn't happened right?"
It was about 45 minutes later that all the kids were brought inside. Each of them were given a hot chocolate to warm up with. It was 9:30 at night and the party was still going. Desserts were brought out and disappeared rather quickly.
Cas started his meal with his head slightly hunched over his plate. Charlie was talking to him and he was only half listening to her. The pure-blood ate his meal a bit quickly, he was too nervous for his costume to eat much, so he didn't take seconds. Cas felt eyes on him and he looked up to see Dean staring at him from across the room. When they made eye contact, Dean looked away and turned back to his food.
Dean reached out to touch Cas' wings, not knowing that they were actually real. Cas, instinct, pulled away. But Cas quickly realized that his wings were not supposed to be feeling things right now so his wing stretched out so Dean could touch it. Cas blushed a bit when Dean touched his wing. Cas' wing was very soft, Dean ran his hand through the black feathers, not realizing the awkwardness it was putting Cas in.
"Castiel Novak," Cas greets them. The Novak pauses. "I apologize if I seem out of it, I'm very tired."
Dean shrugs. “Okay. Well, I can do that.”
Almost on cue, Bobby and another woman showed up. The woman had light brown hair and sparkly eyes that could easily kill someone with a single glare, but also seemed quite nice.
Charlie thought for a moment. She knew exactly who she wanted Dean to kiss, she was just teasing him with the pause. "Novak. I think you should kiss Cas." Charlie's eyes were flaring red, evil. Or at least, to Dean they were.
And then only the Potters were the only ones not present.
The next students to arrive walked over to the corner kids and got into sleeping bags next to them. Both students knew Maze. The first kid introduced himself as Lucifer Morningstar, a Third year Gryffindor. Castiel commented that Morningstar was his older brother's "archenemy" for having the same name. Morningstar laughed at that. The second kid was Chloe Decker, the first year who was also in Gryffindor.
Cas then takes his turn unwrapping presents. The first present he opened was a set of cleaning tools for his broom from Bobby. Ellen had also given him a book on how to protect oneself. Gabriel had gotten him a chocolate bar. The last present Cas opened turned out to be a simple yet beautiful necklace. The necklace had one charm on it. A single, inch long feather. This present was from Dean. Cas thanked him for the necklace and put it on.
Dean and the two girls watched him go. Meg spoke, "he's regularly quiet around everyone else. Do you think it's just him or something happened?"
When they got to the party's location, Cas felt more eyes fall onto him. His wings folded tight against his back and Cas could feel his wings trying to hide from all of the stares.
Dean decided to go wait for him outside the bathroom. Cas came out a dew minutes later, baring no proof that he had just been in pain and still was.
The angel offers a small smile to Ash as he takes the coffee cup into his hands. "Thanks."
The way to Heaven's Gates was a bit more of a drive. A solid four hours Cas spent in the car. The Angel hopes that this really will be worth it, like Dean says. The day is almost over by now. But Cas kept going. Dean said that he is getting close to finishing up whatever kind of scavenger's hunt this is.
After more students were settled down, a red-headed woman with bouncy curls in her hair walked into the room. "Hello class. 'M afraid you will not need your wands for my class, so you can put those away. My name is Rowena MacLeod and I'm your Potions Professor. For this class, since we will not have enough time to make any potions, we will be going over the rules and regulations."
"Don't thank me yet, boy, I haven't decided yet." Bobby ruffled Dean's hair before walking away.
Dessert plates were put away and soon everyone had gathered back into the living room. Ellen passed out presents. The kids opening theirs first before the adults opened theirs.
"You felt that too?" Castiel asks quietly.
Garth was an animal lover. It was the reason he took this job when the guy the teachers offered it to- Charlie Weasley- declined. He loved kids too. He absolutely hated when animals got abused. And hated it even more when children were treated like animals and got abused. It just angered him so much. But right now, he was abusing this poor kid by not finding whatever was causing the deva's pain.
Dean grins at him.
Sirius grins at Remus.
Plus, Chuck wouldn't pay for the Novak siblings to go to any nearby muggle schools, so Michael took it upon himself to homeschool himself and his siblings. When Michael went to Hogwarts, Cas and Luci took over the teaching and now it was Gabriel's turn to teach Balthazar and Anna since Cas and Lucifer were both gone.
"Hello!" Sam greets Castiel with a large smile.
So, uhm, Destiel
When Cas was about half way down with his chores, his father called him out into the television room when he sat with a beer in hand and the tv on. Cas walked in, “yes, father?” He asks.
"Professor?" Castiel asked with a quiet voice, "may I come in?"
"I do."
"And here come both the Slytherin and Hufflepuff teams." The announcer and commentator, Lysander Scamander, spoke into a microphone
The said Winchester stood back up straight, both hands going to cover a wound. "Ah... yup, still stabbed. Cas, uhhh, some help, please?" Dean still had the wound from when he was impaled by a large nail in that damn barn.
Welp, another chapter completed. Next chapter will take place on Halloween day!
Deciding to try and comfort his friend, Dean placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. The deva flinched and moved away from Dean's light touch. Dean, in response, gave Castiel a weird look but did his best not to touch Cas' back or shoulders again.
You made life worth living
Dean huffed and turned to Cas' dark figure. "Cas, is that okay? I'll only do it if it's okay with you." Dean said quietly.
With nothing much more to do as none of the teachers gave homework yet, Dean decided to go try to find his friends to see what they were up to. He doubted that they were still roaming the halls. As it was just Charlie and Cas, it was likely they went back to the Hufflepuff common room. But Dean had to look.
Ash hands Castiel the drink Dean ordered. "Here. Walk over and give this to him. It's his drink. You don't have to ask for his number or anything."
Exams took up the next two weeks. There was only three weeks left in the school year before all the students and teachers would be returning to their homes.
Gabriel grins at Lupin. Lupin waves. Ellen comes into the room next and invites Lupin to come all the way in.
There was a knock on the door. The door pulled open to reveal an old lady pushing a candy cart. "Candy from the trolly?" She asks the three of them.
It wasn't much more time until Professors Longbottom, Turner and the Mills showed up. Jody, Donna, Neville and Kelly had brought gifts for everyone. So had Ellen. So there were plenty of gifts to go around, including the Novaks; which was an honest surprise to Castiel.
The guy doing the zombie makeup looked over at him, his jaw dropped. "Dude, that's a hella good costume," he commented.
Dan brought Cas to the Hufflepuff changing room. Cas was handed his brand-new Quidditch uniform. The deva put it on, making sure to keep his wings hidden from sight. Once changed, he grabbed his Silver Arrow 3 broom, which was also brand-new and bought for him. With his things ready, Cas joined the other Hufflepuffs as Dan started a before-game pep talk.
"Yes, I did," Castiel answers, smiling down at her. Anna, in returns, grins, glad her older brother had fun at school.
The two talking figures stood just outside a small coffee shop. They both had somewhat skinny forms, as if they hadn't eaten much all week. The slightly taller one has black ruffled hair and wears a dirty trench-coat. The other is a few inches shorter and has golden brown hair. The smaller one wears a brown leather jacket.
Cas took the broom and shot himself up into the air. He zoomed around for a moment before hovering over Dan, waiting for him to start throwing the now-enchanted golfing balls. Dan had enchanted them to move around in the air so Cas could practice chasing it around.
"W-when I was born, I got cursed. Cursed to have these wings. They never caught who cast the spell and they still have no clue who did it. After a few weeks of me being alive with the wings, my mother couldn't handle it. So she left. She left because of the curse. I'm still on the fence about whether or not I like them. They make me, well, me. But they make me different. For the first five years of my life, I was hidden away because of my wings. I didn't go out unless into the woods with my siblings, I couldn't have any friends. Now, I just use my clothes to cover them and will them through a different plane of existence so they can appear while I still have clothes on." Castiel explained all of this to Lupin, while expecting a negative response from the professor.
The crowd burst into cheered as Cas showed them the ball. He grinned and came down to the ground. “Good game,” he told Sturry when the other seeker landed next to him. Sturry nodded, “good game.”
Once Cas was gently placed onto the blowup mattress, Bobby left the room. With Bobby gone, Dean carefully got onto the blowup mattress next to Cas. It was weird that Dean had gotten so used to having Cas next to him, that he didn't want to sleep without the deva by his side, even for one night.
The Professor's face immediately turns into a sad frown, like he was missing someone. "Yes, it is true that I fought in that battle, along with others. I, actually, lost someone in that particular fight. Her name was Tonks. She left me and our son, Teddy. Teddy usually stays with his godparents and their children, though."
Dean's room was the last in the hallway. His room was pretty big and had a bunch of posters on the walls, both muggle and wizarding posters. The muggle posters mostly consisted of old bands, while the wizarding posters consisted of Quidditch teams and pictures of Hogwarts. On the parts of the walls that weren't covered in posters, Dean had a bunch of fake hunter tools hung up on his wall.  A few enchanted guns, some enochian brass knuckles which looked really cool, and some other things.
The pair had visited Garth and his family a couple time. Garth had begun to tell his kids to call the, 'Uncle Dean' and 'Uncle Cas'. They also visited the Wayward Sisters a few times. Claire and Kaia are kicking it off in a relationship together and that is going well so far. Sam and Eileen still hunt together and are getting close. In fact, the week before, Sam had asked Eileen to marry him, she said yes! That was very exciting news.
Cas finishes unpacking his stuff, with some help from Dean. A lot of his Hogwarts stuff, he just leaves in his bag, but the more personal items, he takes out.
A small desk sat in the back. At the desk, was a twenty-something year old woman. She had dark brown, long, straight hair. Her eyes were kind when she looked up at the two approaching boys. "Hello, Sam," she greets him. "Who's this?"
FREEZE MOTHA F*CKA WE’RE THE WIZARD COPS!
"Dad," Dean greeted, his voice flat and almost forced.
Lupin took Castiel by the shoulders and led him over to the side of the classroom. Dean quickly made his way over to them to make sure his best friend was alright.
“If only birthmarks could disappear..” Remus sighed. As of then, there was no way to hide or heal scars like the ones on Lupin’s face.
“R-really?” Cas asks, half-thinking that Dean was just playing him and Dean was just going to say ‘just kidding!’ At any given moment.
It didn't take long for the Novaks to arrive back at their home. Chuck was the only other one home when they arrived. For the first time, Castiel felt no worry walking back through the doors of his house knowing Chuck was there.
The witch gave Cas a thanking look and asked what's good.
"I'll think about it. Who is this friend you want to invite over for break? I will send a letter to his parents."
Sam and Gabriel went down to the basement, because there's also a basement. While Dean and Cas went to the upstairs.
The next thing she saw was a wand. A wand she knew all too well. Vicky looked up, fearing that she would see the one person she did not want to see. But he was there. He was right there, holding his wand right at her, his grip tight on the base of the wand.
Sam huffs a sigh. "Alright. Let's go back to after Dean's most recent and, before now, final death."
"Uhm, maybe later," Cas says.
"I don't underestimate my own creations, Amara. I made them myself."
(See the end of the chapter for
Once outside and in the place where the class would take place, Castiel looked over at Dean. The cursed pure-blood thought about what Lupin had said early about having Dean as a mate. Could Dean even accept him? Would Dean want to become his mate? Were chosen by fate or could the first mate choose?
Once the more students arrived and the seven minute break between classes ended, the office door that sat at the end of the classroom opened and a male teacher walked in. The professor smiled at all of the students and grabbed his student attendance paper.
"What do you think Hogwarts will be like?" Sam asks Gabe.
The angel's focus was then pulled to the dog. Cas' head tilted as he looked at Miracle. Miracle looked back at Cas and, mirroring the angel’s actions, tilted his own head.
A wave of sadness washes over Cas as he realizes that he wasn't there to see Jack's big win. He wasn't there to support his son.
Cas frowned. "I'm sorry for your losses. And for bringing it up."
There's silence in the room after Cas finishes up speaking. Dean doesn't know how to respond to that.
It had been a few hours since the Winchesters had returned to their bodies. Sam, after a lot of convincing from Cas, was allowed into the Dean Cave to watch a movie. Sam sat on the opposite side of the couch of his brother and Castiel. Miracle sat between Sam and Dean and Cas was sitting between the couch's armrest and Dean. Tombstone was playing.
The two friends walk out the classroom together, feeling comfortable with the other’s company.
"Yeah, you're not. You're more of a demon from the gates of hell."
Cas lay a hand on the mattress, feeling how comfortable it was before sitting down. The two friends had stolen a pillows from one of the guest rooms, as well as a couple blankets.
Cas goes out to the field and takes his broom, flying up into the sky. Charlie watches him as he does this. There was no one else on the field so it was just the two of them. Charlie would throw small golf balls into the air for Cas to chase after. He didn't miss a single one.
In response, Meg chuckles. She walks around the corner and reunites with the other workers. "Who is it??" She asks, interested. Her eyes scan the room of customers. "Ooh is it that brunette over there? She is pretty hot."
Sam thinks for a moment, "I think learning new stuff, mostly. There's so much information they will be giving us! And they won't even be scratching the surface. But I'm also excited to meet some more people. Like, you already seem great and I've only known you for an hour or so."
"If you wish to go back to Heaven after I send you back to your past body, then you can return," Cas says.
"Well, I was thinking we could grab some lunch and maybe head to my place to watch a movie or yanno, do other stuff than just a movie."
"What can I help you with, Castiel?" Lupin asks.
“The other Slytherin chaser, Rufters, takes the ball from White and approaches Espinoza. With a great toss, Rufters throws the ball and- OOH Espinoza catches it just in time.”
Bobby stood up straight. "That should do it. Ellen and I will be off to bed. Don't you two bed too loud in the night, you hear me? I don't wanna wake up to laughing or something besides laughing." Bobby looked at them seriously, before changing his expression to a softer one. "Goodnight you two."
Not bothering to get out of their pajamas yet, the two boys walked downstairs. Ellen was making some bacon and eggs on the stove while Bobby sat at the table with a cup of coffee in his hands. Ellen really made Bobby happy. They were a cute couple and Bobby would probably be a bit different if she wasn't around each day to keep him sane when he was home from Hogwarts.
And with that, Lupin was gone.
Dressed and ready for the day, Castiel and Dean went downstairs. Downstairs, they found Sam and Gabe sitting around a small pile of presents while Bobby and Ellen watched them from across the room.
It doesn't take long for Dean and Cas to find their friends. Charlie, Meg and Mazikeen all sat in one compartment. The two first years join them inside. Charlie was already talking about her vacation and caught the two boys up to speed on what she had already told Maze and Meg.
The deva's wings were out, his trench-coat, winter coat and his scarf were all wrapped around him as well. Dean had his own winter clothes on. There was still snow on the ground and the temperature was below freezing.  But they went out anyway. If Cas wanted to fly, Dean would help him to fly, no matter the weather.
Like you were from me
Your “I love you” spoken
The young wizard shakes his head. "Four house sleepover," he repeated, more to himself than his teacher. "Thanks, Professor Lupin."
"Hello, Dean. Sam." Was the greeting. "I think we should talk outside."
Castiel's eyes light up at Blaine's answer. There was a chance he would actually be spending most of his year with The Kid From The Train.
“I think you should try flying again,” Dean says after a bit. “It’s been a little while and here, you don’t have to worry about getting caught by your father.”
Charlie and Blaine go on to talking about classes and adapting to the class schedule. Castiel stays quiet and eats the given food.
Castiel hesitates. How could he tell Dean the truth? How can Cas possibly explain that he really has wings, he's cursed and Dean is possibly Cas' mate. Cas thinks, briefly regretting asking Dean to talk with him without even knowing what to say or how to say it.
"What's up, Dean?" Bobby asks, looking down at his boy.
"I know, Professor," Dan says.
Castiel looks just as good. His trench-coat is absent and he's in a really nice suit that has a blue and white flower pinned to it. His hair is a bit nearer than usual and he's looking at Dean with the same happiness that he had when he confessed.
"HUFFLEPUFF"
Dean shrugged, "sure."
Cas shakes his head a bit. He puts Anna back down on the floor before crouching down so he was eye to eye with his young sister. “I want you to tell Mikey and Luci that I said bye, if I don’t see them, okay? Can you do that?”
ready?"

There's only a few people sitting around at the tables that are scattered throughout the room. The rest of the tables stand empty. Some other people wait in line, linger in line for their turn to come so they can make their orders.
Once the story was finished, Cas and Dean thanked her before leaving to go give Sam their new information.
The Winchester nods. "After breakfast?"
Their father glared up at his boy. “You know what to do, boy. Turn around.” Their dad leaned over to the table and picked up a pocket knife. He clicked it open. “I want to see the reason your mother left. I want to see your monster side.”
Dean let Cas leave the compartment before following the pure-blood outside. Outside and off the train, hundreds of students walked along the pathway.
The four of them arrived in the Great Hall and decided 'to Hell with house boundaries' and all sat down at the Gryffindor table, the most empty table so far out of the four tables. Food was already spread out along the tables, waiting for the students to take it and begin their midday meal.
"Poe Dameron."
When Cas decides it is time to leave his room in the late hours of the morning, the Angel is surprised to not see Dean already up. Confused as to why Dean isn't up and present, he goes to check and see if he is in his bedroom. Dean isn't in his bedroom either.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hi," the boy says, "I'm Adam. Adam Milligan."
"So, what now? We wait for 'Jack' to do something that doesn't seem like Jack? I mean, it might not even happen, right?" Sam asks, making his way over to them.
But before the tip of the blade could penetrate Cas' vessel, the blade was taken from his hands. Cas opened his eyes, wondering why he hadn't been able to end everything. When he looked up, he saw Dean standing there, the angel blade in his hand. Dean had an alarmed look on his face.
The boy could only nod. "S-some of it," Cas said finally. His voice cracked in the middle of the sentence. He was still in pain and Garth still hadn't figured out why he was in pain, only that Cas had a tough few years of his life.
"You're scared?"
Cas nods and follows Donna, though not before looking back at Dean with a rather confused expression. Donna walks away from the field with Castiel beside him. "Y'know, it's funny. The last person who was in this position was Harry Potter. Can you believe that?"
Charlie wagged her finger at him. "Nah ah. The key word is 'or'."
Cas nodded and tried to relax his wings, but the pain was too much to bare so he just kept as still as he could.
It still plays in my head
"Yeah, I do. Top or bottom?"
Sam shakes his head. "I can't believe it."
"Can I see your wings now?" Sam asks, when he sees Cas approach.
From the kitchen, the Novak siblings all froze. They had heard that sound before. Much like Castiel, they thought they wouldn't have to hear that terrible sound again.
If I can find you,
Gabe smiles at him. “Hi.” His voice is a bit more quiet now that he takes Sam’s appearance in.
Lupin looked back at the rest of the class. "Alright, class dismissed. We can finish this lesson the next time we have class." Lupin excused all of his students and they all left, some of them staring at Cas as they walked by.
Together, the Hufflepuffs marched out onto the field. The Quidditch stands were filled with loads of students. There were red and blue mixed in with lots of yellow and green in the stands.
Gabriel raised an eyebrow at the teacher, not caring that he was testing an adult. "How could you possibly know what he went through? I can't even imagine half of how he feels and I've been around him my whole life."
Bridges to other universes have been opened
"Come on, this is only part of it," Sam says, dragging Gabriel inside.
“Angels are watching over you”
"Yeah, her name's Lisa. Lisa Braedon. She's a Gryffindor. We hung out a couple times but she has a lot of other friends so I don't see her much."
Madam Hooch walked over to the center of the field. The Quidditch players surrounded her as she unlocked the Quidditch balls. The two bludgers went flying into the air, as well ask the snitch.
How could my 6 month old brother
"And do you, Samuel William Winchester, take Eileen Leahy to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
The Novak's eyes snapped open. Cas was sweating and shaking violently. Hot tears were streaming down his face. His wings were hiding, pressed against Cas' back. Dean gently took Cas' face into his hands, forcing the deva to look at him. Cas' pained eyes looked into Dean's green ones.
As Castiel walks away from the human, he feels a strange sense of familiarity. He is certain he has never met the Winchester. But he is sure he had heard the name Dean Winchester before.
"I'm still not sure about this."
First year exams were difficult to do. The students all did their exams. There was a collaborative sigh once the exams were finished.
"Hey," Dean spoke, calling to the house elf.
"It has been a long day. I am sure you all are full and tired. So off you go. Your schedules will be handed out by the prefects before you will be shown to your assigned room." McGonagall excuses the students and sits down as all the students stand up in a wave of chaos.
Pushing past the emotion, Castiel made his way to the Entrance of Heaven.
At the front of the Great Hall, the teachers all sat at their table, observing the students in front of them and eating their own food.
"What have you found so far on this case?" Cas asks, going right to business.
Gabe nods, not saying anything before leaving the room.
Cas was pulled out of his thoughts and silent questions when Madam Hooch started the flying class. Madam Hooch had a clipboard in her arms. Reading off the paper attached to the clipboard, Madam Hooch called out names to make sure every who was supposed to be there was present. Once everyone was present and accounted for, Madam Hooch started the first flying lesson.
"P-please don't do it," Vicky begged the man. "Please."
Bobby was the one who answered the door. "Yes?" He asked, looking at the two men standing there on the steps.
About halfway through the rules, Castiel raised his hand. Dean could tell that Cas looked worried. Like really worried.
Garth appeared at the door a few moments later, looking tired but not looking as if he had just woken up. "Wassup, Remus?" Garth asked, taking in Lupin's worried expression.
Once dressed, Dean as well as his four other roommates walked out of their dorm and down into the common room. Other students were already out in the common room, most were slipping out of the picture frame exit while some were waiting for their friends to arrive.
Dean gives an approving nod. "That's a cool ass app."
Cas smiles himself. “Thank you, Dean. But I think my parents would disagree.”
The student shook herself and took a breath before raising her wand up to the snake and shouting, "riddikulus!" Immediately, the snake changed to a pink worm on a string that was flopping about. The classroom was filled with laughter.
Time passed differently in Heaven than down on Earth. It would be a ten minute drive in Baby for Dean, and fifty-eight years for Sam. Sam lived a long, mostly happy life. He married Eileen, had a son whom he named after his brother, and lived until he was 96. He died painlessly and couldn't have been happier when he opened his eyes again to see his brother standing there.
Sam grins. "Make sure to tell Charlie that the next time we see her."
(Charlie's costume)
Castiel looked at Dean, noticing the fear behind the usually bright green eyes. Cas stuffed his hand into his trench-coat pocket and took out the folded piece of napkin that he had written his phone number down on, just as Meg had given him. As he walked by Dean, he slipped the small paper into the younger Winchester's pocket for if Dean would ever need to talk to him again.
The Winchester handed Cas a winter coat. "Here!" Dean says, "it used to be mine and I'm pretty sure it'll fit you."
There's a nod from Cas. The deva looks down at the ground. Charlie takes his hand, making him look up at her. Charlie looks at Castiel for a moment before bringing him in for a hug, carful to not bump into his wings only being cautious in case his wings were super sensitive to touch.
I was too
For another hour or so, the three of them hang out. Cas gets multiple compliments on his “costume” and Dean sneaks him a knowing grin each time. There isn’t any costume contests which makes Charlie sad because she was so sure Cas would’ve won one of those.
The Winchester chuckles. "A long while. Since I was told about it, I think. I mean, who isn't excited to go to a school for magic? It's like the coolest thing there is!"
Amendiel sat on his bed, a book in his lap when Dean entered their shared room. The boy looked up as Dean came walking in and gave the other wizard a small smile. Dean responded with an even smaller smile.
Feeling a bit more confident, Cas walked out of the bathroom, his wings folded behind him but still sticking out behind his shoulders. Cas made his way back to his room to put his school uniform away.
Cas pulled his legs up onto the couch, moving a bit closer to Dean. He was uncomfortable. Not only were his wings in an uncomfortable position, he didn't exactly trust the teachers who had just arrived. Dean glanced over at him with a look of assurance. Cas could get through this  he managed to get through years of keeping his wings hidden.
The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher nodded before walking out of his office to find the Care of Magical Creatures Professor. Before leaving, Lupin took a quick glance at the young boy who looked like he was in so much pain.
Charlie is the first to find her family. She says goodbye to Cas and Dean before running off to her parents. "She's almost like that annoying sister who you love with all of your heart," Dean says to Cas as they watch Charlie go.
Your blue eyes like the sky from which you fell
But I am going to say it now.
About three hours in, Castiel caught sight of Dean sitting in the stands with Lisa at his side. This distracted him from the game for a moment. Apparently it was a moment too long because below him, the crowd erupted. Castiel looked up to see the Ravenclaw seeker holding the snitch up high.
"Sure," Dean replies and moves himself and Mr. Whoo so the girl could sit.
Dean woke up a few hours later. It wasn’t yet morning, it was still dark out. Dean realized the blanket had fallen off both him and Cas. The Winchester looked over to see Cas still asleep. The pure-blood was in a ball, one of his wings was hanging off of the beanbag, another was over Cas’ shoulder. The other two were trying to mimic the bigger wings, but both of the newer set of wings were too small to actually copy the bigger wings’ position.
Jack's just like Cas, Dean notes. "Hey, Jack. You missed the cake," Dean says, informing the Nephilim that he had missed everyone.
"Since today is a huge chick flick day, might as well just go with it... I'm scared, Sam. I've lost Cas so many times already. I don't want to loose him again," Dean says.
Dean nods. "I do believe you, but those Ministry dudes might not. Or if they do, it won't go very far."
Dean looks down at the picture for a few moments, completely silent. He moves his hand and gently traces the outline of Cas. He looks back up at Sam, Eileen and Jody. Jody had that look on her face. The look of a mother who knew her son had lost the love of his life.
Sam and Castiel frown at Dean. "Cas and I were just made up a plan. I will go and try and see if I can do research on how to kill Freyja and undo her spell. You and Cas are going to go out and interview the people close to the vics. Maybe try to find any of the vics' crushes, see if they have some info too."
When they finish unpacking Cas' things, the two friends head downstairs to see if dinner was close to being done. Which it wasn't. Sam and Gabriel were in the couch room, so they joined them.
Castiel watched him leave. If this really was the Professor Lupin the sorting hat was talking about, then maybe Lupin had a secret like Cas did or maybe something similar to it. There was only one way to find out. Besides, Cas can read the first two chapters of a book later.
Bobby passed out drinks to everyone and they all gathered in the living room. The center of attention were the Winchesters. Stories were shared of how they beat God, how God ended up being a poor ass writer, and how Jack ended up being one of the best things for this world, even if the Winchesters doubted it in the beginning.
After a nice long meal, the pair asked for the bill. Dean got out his wallet and payed, Castiel had protested but Dean had easily won that argument.
Cas fidgets with the sleeves of his shirt. "Some of them.."
Eventually, Donna stopped outside a classroom. "Jody-o, can I please see Espinoza?" She asked, peaking her head into the classroom. A moment later, Donna stepped aside and out walked an older boy.
She handed Cas a spoon full of nasty looking medicine. Cas took a sharp breath before taking the spoon and swallowing the whole thing. He was quickly off to sleep. When he was asleep, the nurse took off his trench-coat and flipped him over so she could examine the wings for herself. Both Lupin and Garth stood behind her, watching.
The Nephilim looks at the two men. "I'll leave you two alone..." he says, sneaking out of the room to let them be.
Or at least, that's what he thought.
Bobby frowned at them before opening the door wider so they could both come in. "Wait here," Bobby instructed the two men.
"When I was a small boy, I got attacked by a werewolf. It bit me to get revenge on my parents. From then on, I would turn into a werewolf every month. It's the reason I left teaching here all those years ago," Lupin says. "But I had friends that helped me get through. Peter, James and... Sirius. They helped me get through the night each month. They stayed with me the whole time." Lupin laughs sadly. "Y'know, Sirius... he used to be my mate. He kept me sane all those years."
Jack had killed God. Billie was trapped in the Empty. The Empty itself was back asleep. Everything was over. Lucifer has been resurrected so Jack could use his father's power to substitute for Jack's lost powers. But Lucifer was back in his cage and powerless.
"Can we see it?" Sam asks Vanya after looking around to make sure no one else was near enough to hear their conversation.
Bobby turns to them. "Okay, so you boys have a couple choices as to where you can stay. We have three guests rooms that you choose from, or you can make room in either Sam or Dean's bedroom."
Dean shakes his head. "No, it's okay, you were curious."
"It is quite alright."
Lupin took yet another step closer, to hear out what Garth had to say about what was happening.
Gabriel notices a small sign behind Meg. "Actually, we're looking for jobs, something to make more money. Our family wasn't very rich and our home burned down not so long ago. We weren't left with much. So it would be nice to get some money in our pockets."
Castiel, however, didn't pull up. He managed to pull off a move that allowed him to stop a split second before landing on the ground. Both of his feet were placed on the ground a moment after. It was a swift and smooth move that had a big chance of failing but Cas got it right. The Novak looked over at Dean. "I win," he says, having landed on the ground before Dean had a chance to.
And then it was done.
"Thanks, love," Dean says, glancing up at Castiel's shirt that had his name pinned to it. "Castiel, huh?" He guessed his name. "Well, Castiel. Two things for you. One, tell your friends that they are pretty bad whisperers. Two, when do you get off work?"
Together, just you and me
After a while, the class ended. Half of the class was glad it was over while the other half was disappointed, having found the rebellious wizards in Ancient Greece quite interesting.
I didn’t get to say it then,
Garth was still leading Dean through how to heal Cas. Dean was struggling a bit and Cas was trying to keep still as the pain and aching of his wing started to get to him. Ellen and Bobby stood behind them, both with a worried look on their faces.
Lupin told Cas about his mother when she was younger. Gabriel and Dean  listened in.
The students all nodded, understanding their instructions.
The school nurse, as well as Garth and Lupin, approved of Cas’ wing growth. However, she told him that he should probably stay another night with his wings out so he could get used to the feeling. She did say that the next day, Cas could have visitors come over, if he wanted.
Cas didn't look back at him, he didn't even respond.
Dean takes a breath. He needed to fix Cas' wing so his friend wouldn't be in more pain. Dean couldn't mess up, he had to get this right. And then Dean feels it. The force connecting himself and Castiel. The pull is strong and Dean can tell this is what he was searching for.
Destined to die
Lupin pulled Cas to the side of the party, making sure they were both far enough away from the others that no one would overhear. "Your wings are out," Lupin stated.
Cas went over to Dean and asked if he could sit down next to him. Dean looked up when Cas came over to him and smiled at the other boy. The half-blood allowed the pure-blood to sit next to him. Castiel smiled in his thanks and sat down.
Cas, followed by Dean, went upstairs to get his trench-coat. Dean dug through his closets (a familiar place for him) but wouldn't say what he was looking for. After some searching, Dean found what he was looking for.
Dean nodded, "yeah, sure, Cas. Go ahead." Dean smiled at the other boy.
Cas went off to shower, leaving Dean alone in his room. Dean frowned to himself, looking around his room. The Winchester walks over to a small desk and goes through his stuff, looking for something in particular.
Donna led the two boys away from the classroom so their conversation wouldn't carry over and interrupt anyone. "Danny, I want you to meet Castiel. Castiel, this is Dan Espinoza. He's the Hufflepuff Quidditch Captain. I'm gonna quote McGonagall from her stories, 'I found you a seeler'." Donna clapped her hands excitedly. "Well? Do you think he could work?"
Castiel and Ryan Sturry, The Slytherin seeker, flew around and around the Quidditch pitch, both of them looking for the snitch.
"Alright. Go unpack your things, dinner should be ready soon."
Cas smiled back at him. "I don't want to keep you from going," Cas tried reasoning.
After finishing their breakfasts, the group of kids went on with their days, doing their chores and taking care of their house while their father bitched, yelled at them and drank.
Dean shook his head, "no no. You won't be."
Cas doesn't answer.
Cas was on the ground, doing his best to keep his growing amount of tears from falling.
"Professor, this is my brother Gabriel," Cas introduces his brother to Lupin.
“Garth also said,” Cas continues, “that after a deva finds their mate, no one can succeed in cleaning or preening that deva’s wings except for the mate.” Castiel glanced up at Dean and looked into his bright green eyes. “That’s actually why I decided to talk to you today. When you touched my wings earlier, you managed to straighten a couple of the feathers that I hadn’t managed to move.
It soon gets late, both Dean and Cas agree that it was time for them to leave. Cas saying that he would walk Dean down to the  Gryffindor common room before leaving for the Hufflepuff one. The two of them walk hand in hand towards the exit of the party but they hear someone talking to them from behind.
"Dean, I..." Cas starts.
"Hiya." Meg greets the pair, flashing a smile. "Anything else I can get you?"
The thought of Cas made Dean rethink what Cas had recently told him about his father. Dean hated how Cas' father treated the boy. It wasn't Cas' fault that his mother was gone! Cas had nothing to do with his mother's departure. And what kind of father calls his son a monster?! Castiel had later told Dean that the abuse had stopped a while ago, but now Dean didn't trust Cas' father one bit. In fact, Dean knew exactly who he was going to have over for Christmas break. Dean didn't want Cas to go back to the father that hated him because of something the poor boy never did.
Next, Dan brought Castiel to the field. "You've been to a Quidditch game before, right? Or at least know the rules?" Dan asks Cas.
When they did arrive, there was already a group of people waiting outside Bobby's place for them. Each person looked familiar.
"I'd loose the ability to hear," some fifth year kid hissed from beside them, "so then I wouldn't have to listen to your stupid game."
And then it was Castiel's turn. His named got called and he jumped a little. Dean gave him a nudge and he stumbled forward. Castiel walked up to the stool and sat down. The hat was placed on top of his head. And just by his ear, Cas could hear the hat whispering.
Lupin pulled away from Sirius’ touch, a bit shyly. “I think they are some kind of weird type of birthmarks,” Remus lied. He got an awful feeling whenever he lied to Sirius, and he lied quite a bit so that feeling never fully went away.
Eventually, it came Dean's turn. Hesitantly, Dean stepped up to the boggart. The boggart, having previously taken form of farting pig, looked at Dean for a few seconds before changing. The boggart changed into the form of a younger boy, laying dead on the floor.
"Anyone else?"
Castiel glanced over at Dean, who shrugged, before walking over to the two teachers. "Yes?" He asks quietly, scared that he was in trouble for doing a dive like the one he just did.
It was a while before Dean's name was finally called. The Winchester stood up straight and walked over to the stool like everyone else before him. He sat himself down and felt the hat fall onto his head.
That's when Castiel begins to worry. He searches the entire bunker for his lover, but Dean is no where to be found. Finally, Cas goes back out to the map room to where Cas had left his phone. He could just call and ask Dean where he is. Opening up his phone to call Dean, Cas spots a note pinned to the wall across from him.
Making a deal that when you are truly happy
Most of the students went back to their common rooms to get changed into their outfits for the costume party. Castiel went along with them, getting more and more nervous by the second. What if people noticed they were too real looking or that they were in fact attached to his back? Cas tried his best to put those thoughts away. He could worry about that if someone actually did find out. But not right now.
Novak spent the next few minutes showing off to Dean. He was constantly flying up and then coming back down. Each time, he got higher and higher as his confidence grew. Dean watched him with amazed eyes.
Cas thought about what she said and would continue to think about her words. Trust someone. Castiel could do that.
Aaron nodded and stood up. Seth followed his lead. The two men went over to Bobby and gave the professor some contact information before leaving.
Meg nods. There's silence between the three of them before Meg finally stands up. "Well, you two are pretty boring. I'm gonna go find me some girls and we're gonna have some real fun." Meg leaves without another word.
“Aren’t you a first year?” Sam asks, “I didn’t think first years were allowed to be on the team.”
But it felt like there was something missing. Or rather someone.
I was lost too
"Hey, c'mon, lighten up," Charlie told him, "This is going to be a fun school year. We're gonna learn and make new friends and just have a good time. Okay? Good." Charlie took a cookie from one of the plates in front of her. She looked at Cas and noticed that he didn't seem to believe her. "Are you okay?" She asks, her voice sounding more concerned than before.
"And now you've scared the kid off," Maze muttered.
"I'm a pure-blood," Castiel answers.
Dean greeted him back with a smile. "I'm really excited for this."
Dean nods. “Of course, Cas.” He smiles.
Dean and Castiel exchange a look. "I think we are ready to order our drinks."
Though that wasn't necessary, as a few minutes later, Dean and Cas entered the kitchen together. The pair sat down at the table. Sam turned to them when he was able to and smiled when he saw his brother's hand over Castiel's. It had finally happened. And, man, Sam couldn't be more proud of Dean.
Lupin walks into the rest of the home, looking around. It was a annual thing for one of the professors to invite the other teachers over for Christmas, just in case they had no where to go to celebrate. This was the first one at Bobby's house. Bobby usually never came to the teacher parties so it came as a surprise when he invited everyone over.
Cas let out a sigh. "Okay. Sorry for reacting like that, it's just... never mind." He was quiet for a moment. "Charlie's outside talking to some Ravenclaw named Dorothy. They were outside reading some books when I left. I think Charlie should still be there."
And, yes, this is actually going to go somewhere. I do have a bigger plot in mind. Because, for once, I actually have a plan for this story. And I personally think it’s a good one!
The man who had just walked in was tall. Young, maybe in his twenties. He had a brown jacket on over a dark shirt. There was a small necklace dangling from his neck that had a single pendant on it. Castiel had never seen this man before. The angel watched as the man walked over to the serving counter. There was no one else in line so the man went right up to Castiel and flashed a smile.
We could have had a life
Both Winchesters know that's a lie.
(See the end of the chapter for
The fallen angel steps towards his hunter, "it's really me."
The Winchester nodded. "Cas seems like a really nice kid."
"I believe they are strong enough to hold me, yes," Cas answers, "however, I haven't tried in a long time. My father caught me flying while my siblings were using their brooms and flying around. Well, I should just say it ended well. Every now and again, I would use one of their brooms. I was good at it, but it could never compete with the feeling of flying free."
"Though, Bobby probably will invite Professor Rufus Turner, the Ancient History teacher, and Professor Kelly Kline who teaches Earth Magic. They are all cool and accepting, but it's okay if you don't want them to know about your wings." Dean was super aware that Cas may end up feeling uncomfortable around new people, especially with his wings out, so he made sure to make it clear that it was okay if Cas didn't want his wings visible.
But Cas understood. In that moment, Cas understood everything. The angel had a small smile on his face as he stepped up to Dean. Green eyes looked into blue and their lips connected in a soft kiss.
Benny and Adam talked quietly between the pair of them while Castiel fell asleep. They talked for a bit before following Cas' actions and getting into bed.
The male with the mullet hands the first one Castiel and Gabriel's order. "Write down your number and give it to him when you give them their order!"
Sam understood his brother's silence. "Dad's here?" Sam asks after a moment, repeating what Dean had said earlier. "Think I'd get kicked out of Heaven if I went over to him and slapped him?"
A few feet away from the water, there sat a small, wooden bench.
"May we come in?" Dean asks, speaking first of the pair.
Castiel, however, didn't each any of the given desserts. He kept his hands in his lap and a tiny frown on his face.
“You won’t just disappear on me half way through and never speak to me again? O-or call me a monster and storm out?” Cas was having serious anxiety about Dean agreeing, he just couldn’t tell if Dean was being serious about helping him or not.
"Cas, what the hell?" He asks, his voice loud and sharp.
Not a chapter
Cas nods, "yeah, it's a pretty big, chaotic family. Michael and Lucifer usually fight all the time. Gabriel and Balthazar really don't help when those two fight. My father doesn't care and my step-mother is almost never around. Anna and I usually just stay in the background."
I wanted a life with you
Castiel, Meg, Dean and Charlie all got into one boat. Charlie and Dean kept eying Meg and Meg kept sending glares back their way.
Compliments kept coming from the four children. Ellen said it was nothing.
Victoria, or more commonly Vicky, Novak ran as fast as she could. A hand was wrapped around her stomach, protecting the unborn child inside of her. Vicky was a good dueler and was great with her wand. She just didn't know how much longer she could keep this up.
Cas walked over to one of the mirrors and checked his reflection. For a moment, he stood staring at his wings with pure hatred in his eyes. But then that changed when he remembered his wings weren't the only thing that made him himself.
"You're going to do great," Dean assured Cas, sensing the deva's worry.
"How long have you been teaching here?"
Now not as confident, but a bit more shy, Cas then left his room behind and went to go see if Charlie was ready to go yet. Sure enough, Charlie was waiting for him to arrive. She had a cute, red dress on with a red mask that belonged at a masquerade party. It was a simple costume, obviously homemade, but good.
Cas pulled Dean to the other side of the room, away from the Ministry men and from Sam. His face was nervous and shocked, like he had just seen a ghost.
"And the others?" Dean's voice is sharp.
Charlie nodded, "alright. Fizzing whizbees, please."
The Winchester was changed when his best friend was taken from him. When his best friend chose to leave him behind. Dean constantly had to remind himself that Castiel was gone for good. His friend, his lover, was never coming back.
Cas gave Benny a smile in return.
“Drink this so you will sleep through the pain and the night. Tomorrow, I’ll give you some more pain medicines for when you wake. But Professor Fitzgerald tells me you will have to be awake for most of tomorrow so you can successfully.. grow strong.”
Then we can have that
"I will, Sammy, I promise. And I'll do my best to write whenever I can."
Sam nods.
"I'm not sure." Comes the reply.
The first student in line stepped up as the boggart was released by Professor Lupin. There was a silence and stillness throughout the classroom. Before a giant, very intimidating snake appeared out of mid-air. The snake was decorated with brown spots and had blue skin. It's pink tongue stuck out and it hissed at the group of kids in front of it.
Castiel smiles. "That will depend on what happens throughout the year."
Garth moved so he was standing behind Cas and looked over his wings. Garth's hand moved so his hand was only a few inches away from Cas' dark wings. His hand moved down, staying close to the boy's wing but not touching it. Garth's eyes followed his hand as he examined the wings.
Prefects had to yell over the talking and tell the first years to follow them so the first years could be shown to the common rooms.
"So? Did you get expelled? You're not going to leave, are you?" Dean asks him.
Once most of the food was cleared throughout the five tables, the main meal cleared and was replaced with multiple desserts.
Once most of the students finished taking in the sight of the Hufflepuff common room, The female prefect started to speak. And Blaine now had a bunch of papers in his arms.
Dean doesn't reply. Of course he was scared! His best friend for 12 years confessed his love to him before sacrificing himself so Dean wouldn't die. And the worst part? Dean felt the same way. He felt bad that there wasn't enough time for him to say it back. For all he knew, Cas had gone to the Empty, forever thinking that Dean didn't feel the same way.
"Half-blood, pure-blood or mud-blood?" Meg asks. "I, myself, am a pure-blood."
Castiel felt loads of eyes on him from different parts of the room, including from the teacher table. He was not enjoying this extra attention and slouched over in his seat.
Lupin began to walk back to the castle to show Garth to his office where Cas should still be. Garth walked along side Lupin. The pair of teachers made their way up to the school and traveled along the halls silently.
"Dean!"
Much similar to how a real snitch works, but slower, the golf ball circled Cas for a moment before zooming off. Castiel immediately followed it, keeping his eyes attached to the fast moving object. After two or three tries, Cas caught the golf ball in his hand.
"The hat mentioned that you had a secret that was similar to mine. And I was thinking that if you do have a secret like mine, that perhaps I could confine in you about it. At home, I have one of my brothers helping me, but here it's a bit different..."
"Ooh, so you're him. I've been waiting for you to show yourself, Dean Winchester. I must say, you've got a long road ahead of you, but I think you can handle it, with the correct friends of course. Let's see... GRYFFINDOR!"
Castiel’s wand was chosen because of the resemblance to an Angel Blade, as well as the apple-like coloring that went well with the apple wood.
"What- did you- how much did you hear?" Cas asks, eyes wide and his face suddenly nervous.
Besides the whole mate thing, Cas was doing pretty well in school. The classes were pretty easy so far and Castiel was doing well in all of them. His friend group had stayed strong. Dean, Charlie, Meg, Maze, Chloe and Lucifer Morningstar, with Dorothy occasionally dropping by.
By now, more students had filled up the Great Hall and were now eating from the tables. There was a range of food on each table for the students' different tastes. Most of the students obeyed the house boundaries and sat with their own house. There were a few who went to other tables, but they mostly stayed to their houses.
Dean wasn't paying much attention to his brother as Sam read off the people who had gone to jail for that reason. Instead, he was thinking to himself, zoned out.
“And you’re Sam, right?”
Charlie's face went pink. "Oh, I don't have much Wizard money, so I'll pass. Thanks, though."
Cas looked over at the lotion. He smiles softly as he figures out what it is. Cas picks up the lotion and reads the label for some instructions. The deva turned to his mate. “Do you think you can help me with this? I haven’t properly washed my wings for a while.”
"Dean mentioned it to me," Cas explains simply.
"Hi, Cas," Sam greets, his focus still on his laptop.
Cas shook his head. "No, Professor. Actually, I think I found my mate. I just haven't exactly said anything yet. But I will tell you if I'm wrong and one of those symptoms pops up."
"Go!" Everyone flew up into the air as Madam Hooch threw the Quaffle into the air for the chasers to catch. The rest of the players scattered.
"Speaking of which, how many people do we have to inform that I am not, in fact, dead?" Dean questions, looking over at his younger brother.
With a sharp turn, Dean turned to see his father standing there. Castiel, despite his faded powers, could practically feel the fear radiating off of Dean.
The two boys eventually arrive at the Great Hall. Mere seconds after they entered, Charlie came running up to them. "Oh my Mystra*!Where have you been Cas, I thought you were murdered or something."
Folding his wings up behind him, Cas turned to the boy next to him. "I hope the charm I put on them lasts," he said to cover up the fact that his wings are actually real.
"I need you to focus, Dean. Focus on the connection you have between yourself and Cas. Not just the friendship, the profound bond. Focus on that bond and do your best to make the feeling stronger. As strong as you can make it."
All dressed and ready, the two boys went downstairs and said a quick goodbye to Bobby and Ellen, before walking out the door. The snow hasn't started to fall yet, but it certainly would soon. It was cold out, though the boys stayed warm inside their coats. There was a bit of leftover snow on the ground from the last time it snowed. Dean and Cas walked down the street, being careful not to slip on any ice. They walked in a comfortable silence.
This is a day neither Winchester thought would happen. For starters, neither thought they would be getting married at all. They didn't think they would live that long. For another thing, they are getting married on the same day!
Lupin made his way to leave. “And if you two do decide to stay here, you won’t need to worry about anyone wondering where you’ve gone. I will tell your house heads and notify that you are both safe and together.” Lupin pauses, “oh, and Castiel, good luck with your Quidditch game tomorrow, it’s your first one after all.”
For our kid, so he could stay alive
Gabriel smiles down at Harlan and starts to go through his candy, letting the younger boy pick out two pieces. Harlan wobbles back to his mother and plops one of the candies into his mouth.
"Cas?"
"Good, very good!"
"I'm sorry, Dean," Cas says.
"What's up, Cassie?" Gabriel asked, a small wave of concern washing over his face. "Did he reject you? Cas, it's okay if he did. Not everyone here is accepting of a male being with another male, even if it's just your vessel-" Gabriel was almost ranting by now.
Dean chuckles a bit, "well, he's super geeky. He loves a bunch of muggle shows and is a huge nerd."
The other four baristas watched Castiel walk across the room, passed customers and over to the corner where Dean sat alone. Castiel hands him the espresso. Dean looks up at him and for the first time, Castiel sees how bright and beautiful his green eyes were.
Garth glanced over at Lupin. "There... there are marks, scars, on this boy's wings. The marks are all old, so whatever happened, happened a long time ago. I'm no expert, but they look like a blade or a sharp piece of glass cut them." Garth paused. "Castiel, did you do this to yourself?"
See, Dean was a wizard and this year, he would be going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Cas smiled sheepishly, "thanks," he said quietly.
Madam Hooch wrapped up the class and excused her students to go to their next class. Dean and Castiel made their way down to the dungeons for Potions with Professor MacLeod. On their way, they met up with both Charlie and Meg. Dean introduced Charlie to Meg. Though, the two girls didn't get off to a good start.
Lupin caught sight of the two boys and smiled at them. "Hello Dean, Cas. I didn't expect you to be here, Mr. Novak?"
Lupin shakes his head. "I'm not sure why Vicky left you. But I knew Vicky we'll enough to say that she did not leave because of you."
It didn't take long for Dean and Castiel to arrive at an apartment. The Impala parked in the parking lot and they got out. Dean walked, leading Cas into the building. His apartment was on the third floor.
The Winchester reaches out. “So, uh, how do I do this exactly?” He asks, a bit confused.
And although the school nurse offered to heal up Cas’ scars, the cursed pure-blood wouldn’t let her touch them. It’s not that he
Cas thinks about it. “Maybe I will try flying again.”
I was the righteous man,
"Good luck, Cassie." Gabriel grins at his younger bro before turning and walking in the opposite direction of the lower leveled angel.
A waiter who stood at the front desk gave them a welcoming smile. "Hello! Table for two?" The waiter doesn't waist anytime with small talk and asks how many seats would be necessary at the pair's table.
After checking to make sure no one could see, Vanya took out her wand and tapped the wall four times. "Just like platform 9 3/4, go right through. I'll follow after you two," she instructs them, more for Gabriel's sake than Sam's.
The Winchester looks up and over at him. He nods. "Yeah, they both died. My mother died when I was four, Sammy was just two years old then. And then, exactly four years later, my father... he dies too. She was caught up in a house fire and he overused some drugs..."
