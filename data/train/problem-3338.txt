Dean rubs at the back of his neck and fidgets with his tie again. “Yesterday was… yeah… it was… I enjoyed it. Y’all are awesome. But I… I don’t know if it’s such a good idea; me squeezing into your relationship like a third... no, a fourth wheel.”
Dean says nothing. He did though. Hunter and hunted both know it. There’s still time, he prays, glancing at the wooden door of the warehouse, waiting for a last second reprieve. A wood splintering crash and a lecture on diving headfirst into danger would be more than welcome right now. Something in Dean’s gut tells him it’s already too late.
“Shame, shame,” Zachariah says, with slightly too much glee. “Perhaps Ellen’s files need some updating. I’ve been suggesting for years she should relax her regulations. Allow a wider range of alphas onto her books. It’s not easy matching the more unusual omega with an interested alpha.”
Thankfully, the waiter appears at their table before Dean gets a chance to tell Cas exactly where he can shove his social media. “Can I get you anything, gentlemen?”
“And your biological clock is ticking,” Garth points out, just as Dean is on the cusp of apologizing for being an ass.
“This is my goddamn house.”
Cas wraps himself around Dean’s back like a sleepy koala, kissing the soft hairs at his nape, while Dean pours him coffee.
keep on walking. Dean should in fact run, not walk, straight up to his room and pretend he’d hadn’t seen Cas pounding someone’s ass over the arm of the sofa.
But, after the studio and test audience had seen Marv’s rough cut, the shit had hit the fan. So, now Dean and Marv are back working together, both trying not to be the one to throw the first punch.
Cas walks by once, ignoring him completely. If Dean was a bigger person he might apologize for snapping at him the night before. He’s not, so he ignores him right on back.
“Oh,” Dean says. “No, I still don’t understand.”
“Damn right they are,” Dean says shortly, now highly suspicious that this alpha is perving on his friend. And okay, perhaps a little jealous that yet another alpha has fallen for Charlie’s admittedly awesome charm. “And they’re together. Kind of. I’m sure Charlie isn’t up for any more alpha’s chasing her around anyway. Not that
“Darling, I know I’m smooth. And I know you’re not as unimpressed as you’re pretending. I can smell your interest from here.”
That’s when Dean sees Benny and Cas step up behind Cain. Even in the darkened lighting, Dean can see how pissed they look. They may be here, like some minor miracle, to rescue him, but Dean suspects they’re not happy about it.
Dean’s too confused to do anything but kiss him back.
“Well, calling me pretty was kind of embarrassing,” Dean laughs.
But truth be told, Dean wanted the bastard cold and dead on a slab. And he would have happily put him there himself. That callous sonofabitch murdered his father in cold blood. Left him to rot in back alley dumpster. Alastair was a monster, nothing more. Dean thinks that if he’d had a gun in his hand, if he’d had the opportunity, he could have pulled the trigger and lived with the consequences.
Dean shrugs him off. “I can do what the hell I want. I’m not a fucking pet that your buddy picked out for you at the pound.”
“Trust me, there’s not an alpha in this county that I wouldn’t rather punch in the face than mate with. Look, I get that you’re worried, but honest, Sam, it’s fine. I’ll be fine. I’m not gonna be auctioned off. It’s not some huge government conspiracy. I’m just gonna meet some alphas. And if I like the look of any of them, maybe I’ll spend some time with them. Maybe I’ll date them. Maybe one or two. Maybe a dozen. But I’ll not be spending time with anyone I don’t want to. It’s like speed dating. Really intense speed dating. And, with any luck, I’ll meet someone I want to mate with.”
“You here to drag my sorry ass back inside?”
“Excuse me for interrupting, but I wanted a quick word, Dean, hope you don’t mind.” Benny places his hand on Dean’s forearm, his touch warm on Dean’s bare arm but still making goosebumps pop across his skin. Dean deliberately doesn’t look at Charlie as he feels himself blush.
The guy is wearing a Joker costume. A cheap polyester thing, tight around his waist, and a good few inches too long, the pants pooling down over his shoes. Rather than the usual Joker make-up, the guy is wearing a plastic mask. One that hides his face entirely. Dean tries not to let that freak him out.
Dean quirks his eyebrow. “You compromised? Looks to me like you cut your hair, dude. I’d say Ellen kicked your ass.”
Dean nods. “And Cas.”
Dean knows this is a bad idea. But Dad’s been gone for weeks and the landlord is talking about throwing them out, or taking the rent out in trade on Dean’s ass. Maybe if the guy was less detestable Dean would consider that but the dude hasn’t showered since 1984.
Cas pinches his side. “These people were all criminals and all died.”
“I do,” Dean says, quiet but with absolute conviction.
Dean shakes his head, takes another draw of his cigarette, trying at least not to blow the smoke in Crowley’s direction. It’s bad enough that he’s smoking in the trailer. He’s going to have to air it out before Sam and Cas appear. If they ever do.
“What?”
“Hey, guys,” Sam says, walking up from behind them, thankfully seemingly oblivious to Dean’s flustered state. “It’s time to get this show on the road.”
Dean’s stomach immediately tries to twist itself into a reef knot.
He’s ready with five minutes to spare, and figures he may as well head down to the conservatory. He almost trips over Charlie when he opens the door.
“Hell no.” Dean smiles. “Takes more than you going all terminator on Marv’s ass to scare me.”
“Then what the fuck is it, Sam? You’re freaking me out here.”
Sam mumbles something noncommittal under his breath.
A flutter of hope cracks opens in Dean’s chest. “So, best friends who have feelings for one another and who also have a lot of really hot sex, but not with other people.”
“I’m sure the table is sturdy enough.”
dealing with it.”
He manages to smile back at Cas. He doesn’t trust his voice not to break and give him away if he replies.
Cas takes a picture with his cell and sends it along with his text to God knows who, before focusing his attention on Dean. “Not that big of a deal?”
Abaddon smirks, her stance relaxing. “Looks like I’m not the only one who wants to play. My boys are going to have fun with you, darling. After I’ve had first go, of course.”
That much, Dean has to concede is true. But, seriously. “Are you telling me your own guys couldn’t do the computer shit she does? With the resources your company has?”
Despite all the things they own, all the crap they’ve accumulated over eighteen years of marriage, it takes him only two car trips to pick up the stuff he wants to keep.
“Don’t even pretend you didn’t get off on it, you pervert.”
Cas sighs and sits up, pushes his shades up on top of his head. “She made one bad decision, Dean, when she was young and overwhelmed. She doesn’t deserve to be hung for it. I’ve made horrific decisions in my life. Truly terrible choices. Choices that got people killed. And yet you forgive me.”
“Twelve years, Lisa. Twelve fucking years!”
Then he flees.
Dean stills. The voice, feminine but with a tone that is unmistakable alpha, is right in his ear. A nose brushing against his skin, inhaling the sweat at the back of his neck. A hand slapping against his ass. Dean’s skin crawls with the wrongness of it.
At that point, Dean should admit that he stepped over a line. He should apologize. He should not regress to being a scrappy twelve-year-old with a chip on his shoulder.
Dean nods, even as his gut tells him he doesn’t want to know the answer.
He thinks about bumming a cigarette from one of the smokers hanging around by the door just so he has something to concentrate on other than the thought of Cas hooking up with someone
Dean is taking solace in pie. It’s just as well he has a quick metabolism and doesn’t easily put on weight.
“Oh?” That’s news to Dean. Jessica and Sam were all over each other the last Dean knew. And the last he saw. He still gets unwanted flashbacks to seeing his baby brother sticking his tongue down that poor girl’s throat. God, seventeen-year-old boys are gross.
An unsure shrug and an, “I guess,” is all he manages.
“Let me guess,” he says. “Steampunk Ginny Weasley?”
Daddy says it’s too late, Dean, we can’t go back now. Don’t be a baby. You’re too old for stuffed toys and fairytales.
Cas wriggles across the mattress so he’s snug against Benny and pats the empty space between him and Cain. He eyes droop to half-closed and he looks like he’s ready to fall asleep again. To be fair, they all have a fair amount of sleep to catch up on after the past few days. “Dean,” Cas says. “Snuggle.”
Crowley waves his hands dismissively. “The movie-going public will shed tears as they watch Jason Todd’s Robin die. They’ll hate Batman for not saving his brave side-kick almost as much as they’ll hate the Joker for killing him. The Red Hood is going to end up being the anti-hero that everyone will root for. They’re going to love you, darling. I’ve already drafted something with a couple of the writers, hopefully we’ll have the new script pages for you later today.”
“You want to join the others inside?” Benny asks. Dean’s not sure whether there’s more to the question. But he takes Benny's words at face-value because that’s the easiest thing to do.
“God, it wasn’t even that bad,” Dean groans. “Look, can we not do this right now.”
He hates himself almost as much as they're going to hate him. But, maybe it’s better to put the brakes on now before things have a chance to get serious. Before promises are made. Or broken.
Dean scowls.
But Cas has a family he can visit. It doesn’t seem right, him hanging around here when he could at least be surrounded by people who love him.
“It’s been pretty awesome, right?” Charlie grins up at him. Dean’s heart swells a little just seeing how happy she is. “And Gilda and Dorothy look totally hot!”
“I didn’t... I didn’t mean to. It just… it slipped out. There was a man. A director. He said... he said he’d seen my work, and he could help me.”
“For an omega?” Dean finishes off for him snidely.
Uriel smiles at him like he wants to eat him, but he unlocks the doors with the press of a button. Dean bolts from the car like Godzilla is in the driver’s seat.
“What?”
“I’m thinking the sooner we get back to yours, the sooner we can get this party started,” Dean says.
Mary coughs nervously and glances back at Sam before she continues. “I work mostly in the theatre though, not movies. And I... I go by my maiden name Mary Campbell. I worked with a repertory group in England for years, touring the country. Then I worked in Canada for a few years before...”
Charlie is dancing with Gilda, inelegant but so wholly unselfconscious that Dean can’t help but smile as he watches them. They’re the only ones dancing, and they don’t care. Dean would feel sorry for Dorothy but ten minutes ago she was feeding Charlie tiny cupcakes, so he doubts Charlie has come to a decision yet.
“How cool would it be if I swooped in all Jason Todd badass on my bike though?” Dean says.
Dean stands up.
Dean would argue at being labelled a twink even though he knows he’s not much beyond that and he’s no longer a virgin in any way he can think of, but he’s still as nervous as he is slick-drip needy when Cain lines up behind him and presses his dick home.
“Just take a breath, Dean,” Cas says, voice low. “Remember where you are.”
“And now you’re smoking again?” Cas’s voice is clipped, his eyes blazing.
Dean’s heart sinks. The thought of going anywhere with another alpha and leaving Benny behind makes him feel sick to his stomach. But whether he likes it or not, he agreed to do this.
“Cas,” Dean pleads desperately. “Baby, please, this isn’t Alastair. He’s just a nobody with a knife.”
“No, but it is my home, Dean. If I wish to walk around naked I think that’s rather my prerogative.”
“But, I’m not… my heat’s over… and… I… we….” Dean’s never been good with words but now he seems to have lost his basic grasp on the English language.
Ignoring the car outside and the security guy hurrying after him, he storms down the sidewalk until he finds a store that sells cigarettes and matches.
“You’re alive then?”
“Have you seen you and Carmen? Damn right it’s a good idea. Probably the best I’ve had in a long time.”
He expects Sam to bitch about his drinking, but all he does is ask for a beer. That’s when Dean knows for sure that Sam really is just as stressed as he is about this whole thing.
“Sorry. For when Eileen squeezes out your no doubt gigantic sprog.”
To be honest, the thought of wandering around comic-con incognito has lost its appeal. There are just too many people around for comfort now. And apparently not all of them are fond of him. In fact, if he didn’t still have commitments, he’d be happy to leave now. Crowley would no doubt kill him if he bailed early though.
Cas kneels on the bed beside him, runs his fingers through Dean’s hair. “You’ve never done this before, Dean. Never let an alpha knot you. And we don’t want to hurt you.”
Dean doesn’t need to be asked again. He spends twice as long as he normally would shooting with the photographer because, damn… the bike is hot. They take a few pictures of him wearing the full face mask, and quite a few more with him just wearing the eye mask. Then the photographer persuades him to take that off too and takes some with him looking more like Dean Winchester than the Red Hood. The photographer is funny and friendly, and knows a lot about bikes and in the end, Sam almost has to drag him away.
“Dude,” Ash interjects. “You’re wasting your breath. They love parties around here. Any excuse is good enough. They threw a birthday party for Garth’s hand puppet a couple of weeks ago.”
leave her alone. Brother, that’s blackmail. And bullshit. You don’t have to—”
“I’d rather eat my own eyeballs than listen to that arrogant asswipe brag about his collection of ancient weapons again,” Dean tells her. “And by the way, there’s only one reason a man brags about the size of his blade and it’s not because he has a giant d— “
“You’re the one who wanted to do this in the first place, Sam,” Dean shoots back at him, and then feels like an ass. “Shit, sorry, that was… I didn’t mean... let’s just get this over with, okay?”
“How about you draw up what you think is fair and I’ll get Sam to have a look at it.”
And then maybe we can discuss how you feel about threesomes,” Matt adds.
He’s not so sure the alphas will want anything to do with him now that his body is no longer pumping out “fuck me” pheromones. Maybe one taste of just how needy Dean is during a heat, how exhausting he is, will be enough to scare off the three of them. It’s not like they need him anyway. They were perfectly happy without him before. Cas, Benny and Cain in their cozy house, handcrafted bed and steady relationship. There may not be room for Dean in any of it.
“Cain?” Abaddon says, disbelief in her tone.
Dean has to swallow a lump in his throat himself. Cas’s hand squeezes at the back of his neck. Sam looks at him, and nods, his mouth a firm line and an apology in his watery eyes. In the fucked-up mess that’s their lives that’s one of the nicest things that Sam has never said to him.
“Because you came here to Fairdale for a reason.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Straight down to business, Lis? Are you that worried I’m gonna sic an attack dog of a divorce lawyer on you? You’ve got a lot of faith in me, huh?
Cas smirks. “On your belly, freckles.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, once he’s closed the trailer door behind them. “You know that Crowley—”
“It’s a bit chilly to be frolicking about on the beach, boys. You should be tucked up nice and warm at home.”
Cas shakes his head as he stands up, patting Dean on the shoulder. “
Lisa shrugs, but Dean can tell she’s not as confident as she’s pretending to be. “Honestly, I wouldn’t blame you for being mad enough to take me to the cleaners. I figured Sam might have hooked you up with one of his law-school buddies by now. I bet he’s mad.”
“Still,” Cas says, “I embarrassed you in front of your friends.”
“What? No,” Dean says. If she hadn’t sent Benny chasing after him God only knows what kind of mess he would have ended up in. He’d definitely have more than a bruised face to contend with. “
“So why come to the Den then?” Dean asks. “Why bother?”
“Whatever, man,” Dean grumbles. “I make a mean bowl of cheerios.”
“Dean,” Lisa says, in that patronizingly over-patient voice she uses when she thinks Dean is being unreasonable. “I’m not sure what you want me to do? I can’t make Cas move out? He has as much right to be there as you or I do. Look, why don’t you come back home and we can talk about all this.”
“Dude,” Dean says, wrinkling his nose. “Please, some of us are trying to eat here.”
“Won’t your mom be disappointed?”
“No,” Cas says, firmly. “But, I did find you puking on Benny’s shoes as we scooped you into the cab fairly amusing.”
“Trust me, Dean, I’ve never wanted to kill anyone more. It would have been so easy to put a bullet between his eyes, but in the end, I found that I just couldn’t step over that line. I have spent many years regretting the lives I’ve taken. As much as I wanted to end him for what he did, for what he might still plan on doing, I couldn’t claim the right to be judge, jury and executioner.”
“This is not a joke,” Cas replies tersely without taking his eyes off his cell phone. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humor when it comes to death threats. Dean is getting used to them to be honest. And this one is a bit too ridiculous for him to take seriously. Or maybe he’s just passed his limit on stressing out about this bullshit.
Lisa sighs. “Me neither. One of us is going to have to tell him.”
Dean wakes up, reluctantly, head groggy, to Cas kicking his ankle. It’s dark outside, and Dean has no clue what time it is.
If Dean wasn’t quite so mellowed out under Donnie’s magic fingers, he’d take offence at that pug slur. Those little scrunched up faces are freaking adorable.
Dean thinks about it seriously for a second. Marriage, the whole white picket fence thing, it’s never felt like it’s in the cards for him. Not with all his emotional hang-ups. But now. With Cas. “Yeah,” Dean says, a soft smile lightening his voice. “Yeah, I would. Right time, right place, right person, I would.”
Dean rolls over onto his back, his dick springing up hard and needy between them, and grabs Cas’s wrist when he tries to stand up. “Oh no, bucko, don’t you dare go anywhere. You started this. You finish it.”
“Not lately.”
“Come on Deano, we don’t have all day,” Alastair calls from not very far away.
“Sam,” Dean says, stomach swooping with fear. “What’s wrong? Is it Jess? Elle?” God, if anything happened to his sister-in-law or little niece Dean doesn’t know what he’d do.
“That’s obvious,” Uriel says, without a shred of humor. “All the more reason for you to accompany me today.”
Dean laughs. “Nah, I don’t care. There’s way worse out there, trust me. But, listen, I couldn’t bum a cigarette, could I?” The tell-tale scent of nicotine lingers on the guy’s clothes. There’s no way he doesn’t have smokes on him.
Dean almost laughs. Hell, if Dad’s pitching a fit because he saw Aiden smoking behind the store, god knows what he’d have done if he caught him and Aiden making out there the other night.
“You are a stubborn idiot,” Cas gasps.
“Whoa, hold on a minute there, Freud,” Dean snaps, creeped out. “I’ve never tried to be Sam’s mother.”
“No,” Ben says. “Claire called to tell me our moms have been screwing around since we were kids and they’re planning on getting married. She’s freaking out! And I don’t blame her! Seriously, Dad? What the fuck?”
Cas stops dead in the doorway. “What are you doing?”
“We have heat rooms,” Ellen points out. “You could spend the next few days in one of them. They have everything you need, and Missouri and I will be on hand to make sure you’re okay.”
is so he doesn’t like to argue, and frankly, it’s hardly the most threatened he’s ever felt in his life. He settles for flashing his best shit-eating grin, and winking at Marv, which perhaps doesn’t pour oil on the situation. But hey, at least he didn’t punch the moron.
“Everything is just freaking peachy,” Dean growls. “For God’s sake put on some damn clothes and stop dripping water all over the hardwood floors.”
“Well, I guess he was right,” Dean says, bitterly. “You did just need time. Twenty-five years.”
Dean takes a pull of his beer before he answers. “Not entirely,” he admits. “It’s not like us omegas don’t have any say in the matter. But, let’s be honest, having heat sickness hanging over our heads like a guillotine is gonna make some omegas settle at the first sniff of a suitable alpha.”
“Well, it’s a good job Zachariah doesn’t get a say in who I sleep with, ain’t it?”
“Me too,” Charlie says with a grin. “It took us a while but somehow we still managed to beat you down the aisle.”
For once they know better than to bitch about his drinking.
“I’m not saying we ignore it, Cas, I’m saying... alright... I am saying we ignore it.”
“If you don’t tie up that monstrosity of a hairstyle, your ass is gonna hit the sidewalk,” Ellen retorts, striding up to Sam and Dean and dragging Dean straight into a hug. “It’s good to see you boys, it’s been too long.”
Charlie still has a comforting scent and Garth’s aftershave still makes his nose itch every time he tries to hug Dean, but his sharpened sense of smell doesn’t feel strange now, just like a part of who Dean is.
Dean groans around his next mouthful of pie and the next. Cain stands and watches, his eyes turning dark and scent growing thick.
Dean shrugs. He doesn’t want to seem like an ungrateful asshole, but he’s not going to lie either. “Well, the food is awesome, but I’m not really a party kind of guy.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Charlie says. “I guess I’m just surprised. I mean… you barely even know these alphas or anything about them. And they’ve been living happily together for years. How are you going to fit into their relationship? How’s it even going to work? People don’t live in packs anymore. It’s just… it’s not the way things work. Like my mom always said, alphas and omegas are two halves of one whole. Soulmates. You and three alphas? That doesn’t add up.”
The old guy stumbles towards Dean, yellowed finger jabbing at his chest. “Listen you little faggot—”
Gordon holds his hands up. “Hey, man. No offense intended. I guess not every woman is a gold-digging bitch like Andrea was. We damn near lost the business because of her.”
Dean turns his glare fully on Cas. “It’s a couple of hours away. We’re not exactly talking full-on road-trip here.”
“Tomorrow,” Charlie says. “We’re spending tonight in the honeymoon suite of some super-duper posh hotel, courtesy of Gilda’s parents. It’s gonna be freaking awesome.”
Sam wanted Dean to recover back home in LA, but despite his less than ideal experience in Scotland so far, Dean’s fallen in love with the place. It’s certainly a lot more restful than LA. Even if a decent coffee shop is impossible to find.
Dean wriggles his butt backwards against Cas’s crotch. Two can play the teasing game. Cas’s hand drops to his hips holding him firmly in place. “I think we should perhaps leave before you torture me any further with all this naked skin and your ass in those leather pants.”
And well, that’s not something Dean’s complaining about. Even when they discover the desk isn’t as sturdy as it looks. Or when yet another pair of his panties end up in shreds.
Dean wishes he believed her.
“Um…” Meg and Lisa exchange complicated glances, and after some silent communication, it’s Meg who’s nominated to reply. “Twelve years.”
Dean stiffens at the voice, and curses himself for being so lost in his thoughts he didn’t notice anyone creeping up behind him.
He tells Dean to sit on the hay bale. Legs spread. Dean does.
on a date. But someone, an alpha obviously, is coming to Fairdale to meet Dean. First dates apparently normally happen at the Den. And as this is Dean’s first first date, it’s definitely happening here.
Without the knife to worry about, Dean’s actually not too far away from enjoying himself in a weird kind of way. Fights in bathroom stalls are a bit of a deja-vu from Dean’s misspent youth. More than once he’d hustled the wrong guy playing pool and ended up wrestling on bathroom floors far less hygienic than this.
Uriel smirks at him. “Wherever their alpha decides.”
“We really need to keep some lube out here,” Cas says looking at the sun lotion doubtfully.
“No, I don’t have herpes!”
“Dean!”
“And the cops...”
“Trust me,” Cas says. “Whether people know it’s you or not, you’re still going to draw attention.”
Cas shrugs. “I did say tiles would be more practical flooring for the kitchen.”
“She’s still young,” Dean says. “We all take risks when we’re young. You allow her to make her own mistakes. I respect that.”
“Will you marry me?” Cas repeats, his voice, if possible, even tighter. The words growled against Dean’s pebbling skin.
“No,” Cain says. “It’s not. You cannot shoulder the blame for things outside your control.”
“Darling, the studio hired me to salvage this disaster of a movie. This is how we’re going to do it. We’re going to shoot as quickly as possible. I’m going to cut Marv’s horrendous bumbling attempt at storytelling into a slick masterpiece and we’re going to release this movie as quickly as possible before the critics hang us for Marv’s mistakes.”
“Just grabbing some fresh air.”
“Dean?” Lisa says. “Are you okay? Do you need a paper bag?
“Did you have to be quite so blunt?”
“He,” Cas says, giving Dean a sideways glance as though he’s not sure how Dean will react. “My date tonight is a he.”
Dean huffs and sticks out his tongue at his phone, which if anything neatly backs up Sam’s point. “He’s an asshole and I want him out.”
Dean glances towards the door the guy is pointing to and winks. “Well, if he doesn’t catch me, he won’t.”
“How do you even yoga somebody to death?”
Dean swallows hard, and steps forward to stop Cas from following Crowley.
“I’m not really a traditional kind of guy,” Dean grumbles.
“No fucking way,” Dean says.
“How did you even hear about that?” Dean snarls.
“It’s not a date,” Dean stresses. “It’s a bunch of people getting together for a few drinks. That’s all. Hey, you should come with me.”
Benny pats Dean’s shoulder lightly as he walks past. Dean can’t help but lean in to his touch, closing his eyes, breathing in deeply, and inhaling Benny’s scent.
At least he’s not asking for the hundredth time if Dean is okay. Dean’s starting to sound like a broken record; yes, he’s fine. No, Uriel didn’t bash his head hard enough against the wall to impair his faculties or give him brain damage. Yes, he’s absolutely, one hundred percent, certain he wants to spend his heat with the three of them in their home.
To be honest, Dean hasn’t actually ever seen an omega doctor. But he doesn’t see any problem with that, not when their family doctor has always been perfectly happy to keep him supplied with suppressants and blockers.
“I never did anything like this,” Dean says. “And you started it!”
“But true,” Cas insists.
Parties suck. And this one sucks more than most. Dean’s nose is still pretty sensitive and there must be around fifty people in the room. The smell is almost overwhelming.
Dean never thought he would see Cain flustered but right then, as he licks a smear of apple filling from his lips, Cain’s cheeks turn pink. And then red. And then he sits down heavily, hands clasping the arms of his chair as he watches Dean consume every last morsel of pie.
“No, I haven’t,” Dean admits. It’s not something he’s proud of. Ben hasn’t called for over a week and Dean for once is relieved. He doesn’t know how to tell him. And he honestly can’t stand the thought of upsetting his kid while he’s thousands of miles away and Dean can’t even give him a goddamn hug.
Ellen is waiting for them on the front steps when they arrive back at Fairdale, her expression thunderous. The ear-bashing he gets from her is less than fun, but it’s still favorable to the oppressive stench in the car.
“Wait. Wait,” Dean says.
Lisa follows a few minutes later, by which time Dean is already sprawled on the sofa twisting the top off the bottle.
“Come on, daddy, fuck me hard.”
Dean sighs and squares his shoulders ready for another argument, but then, to Dean’s surprise, Cas stops just as they reach the door to his trailer, and exhales with a deliberation that Dean knows means he’s resetting his temper.
, in his head. That’s as far as the word makes it. He just about manages a stiff nod that, thank every deity, Cas takes as a yes. He kisses with a gentle devotion that steals Dean’s breath away.
A knock on the door interrupts. “They need you on set now, Mr. Winchester.”
A part of him wishes that the alpha had followed. It’s a ridiculous thought. Cain works at Fairdale. He’s not here to find a mate. Given his age and unfairly gorgeous looks, it’s more than likely he’s already been snapped up by some lucky omega anyway. Dean tells himself he isn’t a little disappointed.
a threat, Dean,” Cas says firmly. “He’s dead. He has no control over you. He never did.”
“Don’t you worry about that, Sammy.” Dean smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “Cas knows how to treat me right. In fact, just a second ago he promised me a happy ending. So maybe you should beat it before we—”
Cas shakes his head. “Am I to take it from that show of passive aggressive sarcasm and non-apologetic apologies that you two have resolved your differences?”
“Were you marking your territory, you asshole?”
That makes sense. If there’s one thing Zachariah respects it would be money. Especially old money which usually comes with a decent amount of power, connections, and sway. Dean’s not sure whether the fact this alpha is loaded makes him more or less attractive. Usually Dean would say less, but the fact that he apparently has the power to make Zachariah disappear is definitely a mark in the plus column.
It’s Cas’s turn to snort this time. “Gabe would rather eat his own eyeballs than have anything to do with our family.”
Dean’s date doesn’t go well. Uriel is a close friend of Zachariah’s and his personality is just as obnoxious as that dickwad’s. He’s as broad as a barn and the way he looms over Dean is designed to intimidate. His scent reminds Dean of curdled milk and his smile never once reaches his dark eyes.
“She called me Clarence,” Cas says, ignoring Dean’s sage advice. “When we first met. Didn’t explain why. Not until later when we watched the movie together.”
Dean heard someone say that once to Dad. He thought it was stupid at that time. He still does. But it’s not like he knows why their mom left him. For all he knows it
He hasn’t had a flashback or panic attack for a few weeks now. Although he did have a tiny meltdown before his first therapist appointment a few days ago. But in the end, it wasn’t that big of a deal. Tessa seems sweet although Cas has already warned Dean, she’s a hard-ass underneath. The main thing is Dean feels comfortable talking to her. That’s a start.
It’s then of course that Dean notices that while he was asleep his bottle of Jack had slipped from his hand and he and the sofa are now literally steeped in bourbon. Well, that’s classy. Thank God Ben
Cas is on him in less than a heartbeat.
“Oh, spunky
The next day it takes Dean two hours to clean the sofa and get rid of the stink of Jack Daniels. By the time he’s done he seriously doubts he’ll be able to stomach the smell of bourbon for a while. That’s probably not a bad thing.
“And isn’t it a good job we did?” Cain shoots back immediately.
“Mature adults?” Dean’s laugh is bordering on hysterical. “Fuck you very much, Lisa. I want the beach house, and you damn well better tell Meg to tell Cas that…”
He doesn’t have a single mating bite though. Not that he expected one.
When the door is opened from the outside, Dean literally falls out of the car. Hands and knees in the dirt, head down, puke crawling up his throat.
do this now,” Sam perseveres. “We never talk about it. Or you don’t at least. You know I had therapy after Dad died and everything that happened with Ruby and Jess. And talking about our messed up childhood actually—”
Cas gives Dean’s hand a reassuring squeeze before releasing it, and striding up to Zachariah. “I’ve already talked to Omega Welfare Services, and trust me, they are far more interested in the fact you used your position of authority to blackmail an omega into accepting a date with your friend. And that you are an active recruiting member of a church that’s facing a number of criminal allegations.”
In the end, Dean orders two pizzas, one covered in as much meat as possible and one with pineapple even though he feels dirty ordering it, and he can feel the judgment from the other side of the line. They watch three Doctor Sexy Christmas specials and then a two hour documentary about bees. Cas drinks three beers, lectures Dean on the importance of biodiversity, and doesn’t mention Meg again. Dean considers the relaxed slant to his shoulders and soft smile on his face just about worth the humiliation of ordering a pineapple pizza.
“You are not going down there.” Cas doesn’t look like he’s joking. They’re staring down at the madness below them from a balcony, obscured from view of the vast majority of people.
It’s neither.
Dean’s the first to arrive. Something which should be a surprise to exactly no one, least of all himself. His days aren’t exactly jam-packed with excitement since Ben left home and disappeared off to college in another damn country.
“You make me happy,” Dean says, making light of Cas’s noncommittal answer. “Can I do you?”
The strangled groan Dean makes as he stares at Cas’ ass proves otherwise.
Dean rolls his eyes, feeling the pout unwittingly form on his lips before he can control it. The photographer takes a flurry of shots with a laugh, and Dean knows he’s going to see that online someday soon.
Thanks to Sam and Cas’s new policy of full disclosure, Dean knows he has still been receiving threats. Mainly just from the normal garden-variety keyboard psychopaths but there is also a thread of homophobic threats that Cas is taking more seriously. So, as much as crowds don’t usually bother Dean too much, the thought of who might be hiding amongst them does make his skin crawl.
“Jesus, Dean,” Cas growls.
The alpha is already waiting, sitting relaxed in a leather armchair, when Dean opens the door and steps in. “Well, aren’t you a pretty one,” is his opening gambit.
Their urges, Dean thinks. Seriously. “Do they?” he asks tightly.
“Are you… going somewhere?” Garth nods towards Dean’s hold-all splayed open on the bed.
Idris smirks. “Sweetheart, the only department that the Red Hood threatens Batman in is the walking bow-legged department. Let me tell you, that kid walks like he’s been...”
Benny covers up his surprise with admirable speed but there’s no mistaking the widening of his eyes as he looks between Cas and Dean.
“Really,” Dean replies. He’s heard a similar speech from at least five other people. Uriel left him to the mercy of the crowd after he spent a good forty minutes sermonizing to the attendees with Dean frozen by his side. His strained smile disappearing altogether as it became more and more obvious how Uriel’s crazy brand of religion viewed poor unfortunate omegas,
“Dean,” Cain starts to argue.
“It’s fine. Uriel didn’t even touch me yesterday and if he tries anything today, I’ll break his face. I might not want to do this, but I’m not some helpless omega. I can look after myself.”
Dean hums contentedly, and relaxes back into Cas’s arms. “You think we could steal the bike? Ride out of here like Butch and Sundance?”
That makes Dean move, even though the blinding pain behind his left eye isn’t happy about it. “Nope,” he says, sitting up. “No ambulance. I’m fine. Peachy.”
Crowley grins and sits back down. “Oh boy… this is going to be fun.”
“You know we have a cleaner to do that?” Cas comments when he walks past Dean who’s down on his hands and knees trying to remove a faint stain from the living room floor. He actually thinks it might have been there since Claire and Ben decided they were both wizards and made a potion that had turned their hands, feet, and the floor green. He never had found out exactly what they’d put into it.
The only problem with the whole wedding thing is the dancing after the meal. Dean doesn’t dance. He’d much rather eat another pie while he watches everyone else shuffle awkwardly around the room.
“They don’t count,” Dean grumbles more or less under his breath. Ignoring Cas’ scoff, he changes the subject. “So, what do you think this meal is in aid of? Lisa said there was something we needed to talk about but she didn’t say what. Did Meg give you any clue?”
“Hey!”
“Everyone makes mistakes, Dean. Everyone. Doesn’t she deserve a little forgiveness?”
Sam huffs out a breath, bull-like, and turns away, his hands flexing by his sides. Dean knows him well enough to tell he needs a few seconds to calm down, reign in his temper. He shoots Mary a warning glare when she opens her mouth to speak.
“I didn’t know,” Mary insists, and now her eyes are watering and Dean doesn’t want to see her cry. Doesn’t want the fucking deja-vu. “I didn’t know he’d leave.”
“No problem,” Ellen says, leading them through the restaurant to the small private dining area in the back. And then Dean doesn’t hear anything else she says because his mother is sitting right there at the table. Blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, crows’ feet at her eyes and laughter lines at the corner of her mouth.
Mary doesn’t stop smiling at him.
to go. He has to. “It’s for the best.”
“You know her best.” Dean shrugs. “Raising teenagers is a crapshoot. You never know which way they’re gonna jump in any situation. You can only hope they don’t fuck up too badly and be there when they inevitably do. Lisa pitched a fit when Ben got drunk at that dumb party. Honestly? I was just glad he had the sense to call me to pick him up before he passed out. Christ knows at his age I wouldn’t have been so sensible.”
Dean should tell Benny that he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He should tell him, he’s got it all wrong. But even he knows it’s bullshit. Doesn’t mean it’s still not a freaking awful idea though.
Which was barely big enough for the three people already splayed out on the floor.
“Nice apology, dickwad.”
It’s not like Dean is completely out of shape. He can still run a few miles without keeling over, but, unlike Cas, he’s far from as lean as he was twenty years ago, back when he was modeling part time. Although when he looks back at the advertising promos he did for Lisa and Meg when they were trying to get the business off the ground, he has to admit they’re a bit of a cringefest. At the time, he thought he looked cool with blonde tips in his hair, the pink lip gloss Lisa persuaded him to wear, his oiled chest and his tiny running shorts. In retrospect, he most definitely looked like a twink trying way too hard in a gay bar.
“Sam,” Cas chides, “stop teasing your brother.”
Dean doesn’t like that comparison, not at all. “There’s nothing to forgive, Cas. You were a soldier, a fucking kid, following orders. You didn’t make those choices, you didn’t have any say, you just did your job. That’s completely different. You thought you were doing good, for Christ’s sake. And, when it came down to it, you did the right thing. Even though those ungrateful assholes kicked you out of the army. Even though you damn near lost everything. “
“Well, yeah?” Dean doesn’t see the problem.
“We’re done when I say we’re done,” Marv snaps. “And we’re not done until Mr. Winchester here does us all a favor and remembers how to act. Make-up? Can you do something with him?”
Unfortunately, the bare facts are Ben doesn’t need him anymore. Lisa definitely doesn’t need him anymore. Sam hasn’t needed him for years. His future is a blank canvas that he has no idea how to fill.
Dean holds his hand up, wanting to clarify his point so no-one is under the misguided illusion he’s suddenly had a change of heart. “Whoa now, I’m not saying I forgive you. All I’m saying is this new clusterfuck might not entirely be your fault.”
“Do you really want to know?” Cas asks. Dean can tell by the set of his mouth that it’s not a throwaway retort; it’s a serious question.
Dean picks up a fry and pops it in his mouth without a word. The pink tips of his ears speak volumes anyway.
“Balance,” Dean scoffs, before blowing his nose loudly. “Baloney.”
“Is there anything I can do?” Sam asks. He knows better than to push Dean when he’s already feeling overwhelmed. “You need anything?”
Ellen continues. “We have a doctor with whom you can discuss any concerns you might have about coming off the meds. You’re scheduled for a full medical tomorrow morning anyway.”
“Hmm,” Dean says, dubious. “Word on the grapevine is already pretty shady. Three directors linked to one movie, all these reshoots after the test showing, I doubt we’re gonna break any box office records.”
Dean finds himself laughing again. He never really thought of Cas as being funny before. He’s not even entirely sure Cas is meaning to be funny now.
Cas observes them warily.
Dean stops walking, earning disgruntled complaints from the staff trying to hustle them along. He hauls Charlie into a quick one-armed hug. “You’ve done enough. We’ll catch up later, I promise. I know there’s still stuff you want to see and there’s no way Cas and Sam are gonna let me wander around after all this.”
“Jesus, Dean, shut up and let me tell you, okay!” Sam’s rattled, pacing the width of Dean’s kitchen now. Dean takes a long drink to stop from snapping back.
After almost falling out of bed in shock, he half-runs, half-trips down the stairs, heart hammering in his ears, to find Cas sitting cross-legged on the living room floor, the smell of pot hanging thick in the air.
“Garth,” Dean starts to argue. “I don’t know…”
“It’s clean,” Dean says. Which okay, not exactly smooth but he wasn’t prepared for a character assassination in the first three seconds of meeting his date. He doesn’t even know her name yet.
“An hour or two?” Dean gapes at him. “Are you kidding me?”
Sweat is dripping down Dean’s back now, the heat from the spotlights suddenly overwhelming. He tugs at the collar of his shirt, which is starting to feel like it’s trying to strangle him, then takes another sip of water, his hand trembling when he places the glass back down on the table. The fact that the guy’s face is hidden behind an unmoving mask is starting to freak Dean out. The dude could be anyone. A tiny terrified voice in Dean’s head whispers that it could be Alastair.
Crowley smirks. “Just in time to save the day.”
“Dean, calm down,” Sam says. “Yelling isn’t achieving anything. We came here to discuss this like adults. You’re not even giving her a chance.”
“I know it sounds trite,” Ellen admits. “But unless you fully participate in our program, the chances of a successful outcome are slim.”
Lisa takes a step, reaching out to touch him. Dean flinches and backs away. He can’t help but feel a sick burst of satisfaction at the flash of hurt in her eyes. “Dean, you have to admit our marriage hasn’t been the easiest lately.”
“I’m fine,” Dean snarls. “We only have another couple of days of filming and then I won’t be your problem.”
Dean groans and runs his hand across his eyes. He’s definitely ruined any chances he ever had of having a hot threesome with Benny and Carmen. And he’s going to have to find a new gym. Again. What an absolute clusterfuck of a night.
“I know you brought your brother up to be a fine young man who’s going to attend a prestigious college. He would not be doing that without your sacrifices. I know you are protective of your friends and….”
His mom. Dean doesn’t look at Cas in the front passenger seat. Won’t look at Sam sitting beside him. He stares out of the window. Sees nothing.
Cas scowls at it as though it’s mortally offended him just by existing before 6am before taking a sip. “You are cheerful this morning.”
“No, fuck that,” Dean argues. “Tell me now.”
Ellen laughs at him. “Get out of here,” she says. “And don’t forget to stay hydrated. Heat takes a lot out of you. And be careful of chafing. And remember to eat. Food. Not just…”
Cain holds his gaze for a moment before breaking the intensity crackling in the air, the suggestion of a smile playing on his lips. “There is perhaps just one thing you are lacking.”
Dad, bad mouths him. Sam’s a good kid, the fucking best. And if Dad laid a single hand on him, Dean would punch him out.
“I’m joking. You know I’m joking,” Dean whines, rubbing his arm.
Dean should feel nothing but relief. Cas hasn’t been cheating on him. Apparently, Alastair is no longer lurking around the corner waiting to jump out at him like they boogeyman. Dean should be down on his knees thanking Cas and, God knows, he doesn’t want another fight, but the fact is Cas has been keeping secrets from him again. Making decisions that affect Dean without even talking about it. Dean can’t pretend that doesn’t bother him.
“Dean,” Cas says again, the note of disapproval in his voice indicating better than anything that he’s back in control of himself.
“This director,” Cas cuts in for the first time. “What was his name?”
Dean wants to tell her that adding off and on to every sentence isn’t helping at all. The words seem to get stuck in his throat though.
Rather than brooding about any feelings he may or may not have towards Cas, Dean does what any normal man would do and pretends they don't exist… apart from late at night when he’s jerking off before he goes to sleep. Instead, he focuses on trying to lose the love handles he’s convinced he’s developing. Thanksgiving didn’t help. He made two pies like he usually does but this year he ate them both himself. Spending Christmas alone too is bound to end up with him comfort-eating his way through a 16” pizza and several family-sized tubs of ice-cream before Boxing Day. If he hits the gym a few times beforehand he’ll not feel quite so guilty.
“You shut your mouth,” Dean says, stubbornly finishing off the last scraping of delicious blueberry filling, before licking the spoon clean.
“Cool costume, man. You a Joker fan?”
“Your brother and pretty boyfriend not with you today?”
Cas flips them over so fast, Dean doesn’t have time to blink. Cas stares down at him, a spatter of Marv’s blood across his cheek. Dean reaches up to wipe it away, but Cas catches his hand in vice-tight grip. “Cas,” Dean says again. “This isn’t you.”
Dean’s jaw drops so quickly he swears it almost dislocates.
Ash nods. “Oh yeah, bromegos, they are amazing! Best thing about being an omega is when you find an alpha who really knows how to knot you good. I’ll never forget my first time. Better than any high, man.”
“How do you want to do this, Dean?”
The upstairs of the cottage is like a different house from the cozy rooms downstairs. There have obviously been renovations made leaving only two rooms. A bathroom and a bedroom. The bathroom contains a bathtub big enough for at least two grown men to lie in and a huge shower with enough chrome heads and knobs that it takes Dean five minutes to figure out how to work it. Once he does, the pressure is a dream. Any other time Dean would be reluctant to step out from underneath the beating water. Now though, there’s a buzzing under his skin, a fever spreading through his bones, that a cool shower can’t cure.
And then he kisses Cain until Cain finally unclenches and kisses him back. And then he tries desperately to hang on to any shred of self-respect he has and not come in his pants when Cain lifts him up and lays him back over the table, mouthing at his neck. Dean responds enthusiastically and loudly, dragging Cain down on top of him and wrapping his legs around the alpha’s hips. Whimpers and breathy moans fill the room as they rut and grind against each other, quickly working themselves up into a fervor.
Dean’s heart clenches at how broken Cas sounds.
“And will my alphas be in the heat room?”
“Perhaps we could talk in your trailer,” Cas says. He doesn’t sound happy.
“I'm just saying, boy. There’s a reason nature sends omegas into heat and it’s not just for the amazing orgasms.”
“Budapest,” Cas says, pride shining in his eyes. “She posted some new photos on Instagram a couple of hours ago. Did you see them?”
Dean and Cas edge a little away from the group. Dean can feel Benny’s eyes on them, but he’s more worried about the hangdog expression on Cas’ face. “I’m sorry,” he says to Dean. “I shouldn’t have caused a scene.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas’s posture change. There’s not a single muscle relaxed in his body, and he’s already edging out of the darkness of the wings towards the lights of the stage. His intent to jump between Dean and this moron obvious.
“I’ll find out, young man.” Mrs Spangler grins, jogging away in the direction of her hyperactive terrier.
“Benny’s idea,” Dean groans. He’d tried to veto the suggestion, but had been soundly out-voted. “So,” he says, changing the subject quickly. “Dorothy’s father came round to the whole triad marriage thing?
Crowley might be a dick, but he knows how to produce a badass promo. Although it’s mainly put together using footage that Marv shot, the trailer is a hundred times better than Marv’s original version; bolder, sharper, infinitely cooler. Dean’s almost breathless by the time it’s over. There’s a worrying second of complete silence in the hall before the audience begins cheering and whooping and Dean’s heart rate starts to calm at the same rate as Crowley’s smug grin grows.
“I never wanted to hurt you.”
“I didn’t tell you because I had to make sure it was genuine, okay? I had to make sure it was really her. It’s not the first time someone’s faked something like this.”
“At that age, I was the most buttoned-up, straight-laced student you could have met and adamant I was going to become a priest.”
“Oh, kiddo, if I had the time I would, but I fear time is something neither of us have much of. What do you think the big man’ll do when he finds your lifeless body? You think he’ll cry for you? You think he’ll kill for you? Seek revenge?”
Charlie and Gilda are now serious. And obviously happy even though Dean knows that Charlie is missing Dorothy terribly.
Dean’s four and a half, nearly five when his mommy kisses his cheek, ruffles his hair and walks out the door, face wet and bags weighing her down.
“You know what I mean?” Ash sighs, obviously remembering something Dean does not want to imagine. “The way that knot fills you just right, presses on…”
“Not off the top of my head, but I’ll ask around. But, you know once those sharks get involved it could get real messy and expensive.”
“I’ll deal with it,” Sam says. “Yeah, thanks, I’ll call you back, okay.” With the call cut, Sam stands up and paces two lengths of the room before he stops and meets Dean's questioning look. “The press knows about Mom. Pamela’s been inundated with phone-calls asking if it’s true we’re feuding about it. Apparently, they’re gunning for you.”
“Perhaps we should let an A&E doctor decide that,” Cas says in a snippy tone that Dean hasn’t heard for a while.
Cain just plain scowls. “That isn’t true, Dean.”
“But you don’t want to mate me?” Dean blurts out, cringing at the butt-hurt whine in his own voice.
“No wives, no kids. No presents under the tree. Huh, no tree.” Dean sighs. “Yeah, I don’t think this is going to go down as one of the better Christmases.”
He walks around the island unit in the center of the room, placing the barrier very deliberately between himself and his brother and boyfriend, downs two fingers of chest-burning whisky and refills his tumbler before he speaks. “Tell me,” he says to Sam.
“Why are you stopping?” Dean whines.
“I’m not a kid, Cas,” Dean bites back, the initial relief he felt at seeing Cas rapidly deserting him. “Don’t talk to me like you’re my goddamn dad. What the hell are you doing here anyway? Sam been telling tales out of school, huh?”
Sam bites his lip, gazes at Dean with those awful weepy eyes. “I don’t want to do it alone, Dean. I need you.”
“Night, Cas,” he calls after him, voice breaking. “Merry Christmas.”
He grips Cas’ thighs and yanks him in close, hoping Cas gets the message. Cas, bless him, does.
“Aren’t you supposed to be on your way to your mom’s right about now?” Dean asks, pouring himself some coffee which Cas has thankfully left in the pot.
They’re halfway through a take when Marv’s raised voice cuts through the silence. “I asked you for a cappuccino with an extra shot and a dusting of cinnamon, I mean really... how hard is that?”
Dean licks his lips, trying to work some moisture back into his mouth, his eyes not quite meeting Cas’s. “There’s something though. Something you’re not telling me.”
Cas laughs and then shoots Dean a nervous glance. “I’ll pay for any damages.”
Dean groans. “Sam.”
He feels kind of sick and really fucking tired.
And that’s pretty much how it goes down.
It’s the closest he gets to saying fuck you to his dad.
“Unfortunately not,” Cas says, although the way his nips at Dean’s earlobe is hardly discouraging.
“You did an admirable thing,” Cas says. “Stepping up like that.”
But, since he had to ride one for his role as the Red Hood, Dean has been smitten. It’s freeing riding a motorcycle. Physically and mentally. Mainly because for once he’s on his own. No security. No cell phone beeping at him. No one making demands. Just Dean, his bike and the road.
Unfortunately, Cas is as stubborn as a mule. All Dean’s attempts to persuade him to head home achieve is Cas throwing a bag of chips at his head and retreating to his studio.
Lisa watches him from the bedroom doorway, twisting her hands anxiously. “Please, Dean, just stay tonight. I’ll sleep in the spare room. We can talk about this more in the morning. We
Charlie smiles and pats his arm. “Okie-dokey. Now, let’s roll, people.”
It’s strange how hurt Dean is by Cas’s swift shut-down even if it is exactly what he expected.
“Damn, Cas, are you alright? Where the hell have you been?”
He walks straight out the door, without looking back, without even glancing at Mary Winchester. Or Campbell, or whatever the fuck she’s calling herself these days. He’s so mad he can’t even talk to Ellen, just brushes past her. Even when she calls after him. It says a lot that he feels worse about that than he does reducing his mom to tears.
“I’m sure you do. Any of them you’re actually interested in?”
“I’m no one's pet, bitch,” Dean snaps, fed up with being discussed like he’s not capable of speaking for himself.
The combined scent of Cas, Benny and Cain is almost too much for Dean to bear. He’s lightheaded from just sitting in the same room. Waves of arousal keep washing over him, and his dick has been rock hard since he walked into the alphas’ home. He knows for a fact that when he stands up everyone is gonna see that the ass of his jeans is soaked through with slick.
“I still don’t think it’s fair that we can’t go for the whole weekend,” Dean grouses, moving from one argument to another. “Or at least to the Star Wars panels on Friday.”
Ellen nods. “I’ve set her up in the private room out back. I’ll take you through. You boys want drinks?”
Dean looks at him blankly.
Cas focuses his glare on Dean. “Did you toss it again?”
Cas nods. “I’m perfectly sure.”
He does fuss about the marks left behind on Dean’s body after the day’s brutal filming. New bruises and irritated red scrapes around his wrists. Dean is more patient than he would normally be at Cas’s motherhenning but Cas is still muttering low courses aimed at Marv when Dean crawls under the bed covers. Dean falls asleep with Cas’s arm wrapped around his chest, his head tucked between Dean’s shoulder blades and his hand over Dean’s heart.
Truthfully, he’s really fucking confused. He doesn’t know what’s happening. Doesn’t know why Cas is doing this. If he’s just horny. Or lonely. Or didn’t buy Dean a Christmas present and decided an orgasm was the perfect last-minute gift.
The only reason Dean stumbles backwards when Marv shoves him, is sheer surprise.
Despite his exhaustion, Dean throws himself into filming. It’s a relief to escape his own problems for a while and let the Red Hood take over. There’s only a couple days of shooting left and Dean’s determined not to let anyone down. Least of all Jason Todd.
Pretty sure his legs are steady enough now to hold him, he shakes off Benny and Cas’ helping hands. He can still feel half of the bar watching them. The other half are gawking at Carmen dragging Gordon out of the door by his ear. Dean hasn’t seen anyone actually do that outside of TV shows since… well… ever.
Even exhausted and stressed, Dean can’t help but grin at his adorably pillow-creased face and ruffled hair. Cas is so effortlessly sexy it would be infuriating if he wasn’t Dean’s.
“Winchester.”
The ride home in the car is tense. Silent. No one had said a word since they left the studios. Cas is right, it wasn’t the time or place for the conversation. But the car ride also gives Dean time to stew. Time for his thoughts to run wild.
“I really don’t think you want to add an assault charge to your problems,” a studio exec calmly intones, arriving on Marv’s heels.
Dean thought talking to Ben on Christmas Day would leave him feeling miserable, but in fact, he’s grinning by the time they say their goodbyes. It hurts less being apart from his son when he knows the kid is having a good time. And that he hasn’t completely forgotten about his old dad. He calls Sammy afterward, tries not to laugh when his brother has to cut the call short because baby Grace Exorcist vomits all over him. Dean’s inordinately glad he’s over the baby stage in his life.
“Dean,” Missouri says. “Don’t you walk out.”
His unexpected reply bursts the bubble of tension in the room, a ripple of laughter replacing the shocked whispers.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t entirely agree. Neither does Sam. Your behavior right now, your mood is... erratic. You’re having nightmares and, I suspect, flashbacks, possibly even panic attacks. Not that you would ever admit it. You barely eat, you’ve lost weight and you’re drinking more often than usual. You refuse to seek help or talk to anyone and we think—”
Right, remember where he is. Not locked away in a basement. Not facing Alastair. Not fighting for his life. He’s on a film set. Surrounded by cameras. By dozens of people watching him melt down. Crack up. Dean breathes in deep and slow, only noticing how tight his chest is when air finally reaches his lungs. His shoulders slump. Exhaustion replacing the adrenaline pumping through his veins.
Dean dry swallows a couple of the pain meds, shoves the rest in his pocket and rubs his hand across his face, wiping away the tears of frustration he hadn’t even noticed had spilled over. He’s going to go grab his bag, find his damn car and book it out of here. There’s bound to be a motel nearby that he can crash at until his head stops pounding. Maybe he can find a clinic and ask for more blockers.
He’s just so damn tired. He’s honestly lost track of all the things he needs to apologize to Cas for. He hopes he’s covered most of it.
Dean finishes off his drink and tries to spot Crowley amongst the revelers on the dance floor. The alpha should be easy to pick out seeing as how he was fully dressed when Dean saw him last. Most of the bodies writhing to the music are half dressed at best. There are people fucking, with abandon, while others watch on. There’s a guy wearing a leather harness being led around by a leash attached to his dick. A woman bent over a table being spanked ruthlessly with a wooden paddle.
It’s not so bad with a director that understands an actor can’t switch emotions off and on at the drop of a hat. Or Dean can’t anyway. He lives his emotions. If his character is getting the stuffing beaten out of him, so is Dean. Even if punches are pulled and bruises are faked, Dean’s brain and body reacts like they’re real. And at the end of the day he limps away exhausted and aching even if it’s all make-believe.
Ellen smirks at him. “I doubt that very much. But I think you’ll fit in just fine around here. Who knows, you might even have fun.”
“What?” Dean is pretty damn slow today because he doesn’t understand.“I’m the alpha you’re meeting first.”
Cas looks so ridiculously smug that Dean would be annoyed if he wasn’t too busy being utterly charmed.
His dad is still recovering from the discovery that Dean has bagged himself three alphas. Dean actually thought, from the worrying color his father’s face turned and the throbbing vein in his temple, that John Winchester was going to have a coronary. Still, in the end, he took the news better than Dean imagined. The three alphas towering over him in his living room, probably had a little to do with that.
“It was a movie, Crowley, not a war,” Dean points out, sliding out from under Crowley’s arm before Cas’s good mood vanishes. “And you only turned up at the end.”
Dean grins at Cas. “Look at you, half a mug of coffee and you’re putting on the moves.”
“Dean...”
“It’s a compliment, Cas,” Dean says, trying not to laugh. “I swear.”
The glass of water trembles dangerously in Dean’s hand. He’s a second away from throwing it in Adler’s pudgy face.
The place he went to today seemed a bit more his style. The owner, Benny, a friendly bear of a guy, had introduced himself and shown Dean around. The atmosphere was laid back, the equipment modern and easy to navigate, and the clientele an even mix of genders, age-groups, and physiques.
“Maybe… maybe later,” Dean says. “When I figure out what the hell I’m doing. I’m still kinda processing to be honest.”
“You really shouldn’t use alcohol as a crutch.”
Charlie leans away and reaches up to touch his face. “Did he do this?”
“You know I only love you, sweetheart,” Dean says, squeezing his arms around Cas’s waist and feeling nothing but toned muscle. His boyfriend is so fucking sexy, seriously. “Although…” Dean muses, “Crowley does have that devilish twinkle in his eye, and you know, I do love a man with a bald spot.”
“I hate that you’re hurting, Dean, but this, breaking up, it’s the best thing for both of us. You haven’t been happy for a long time.”
“And Zachariah,” Dean pushes on, ignoring Benny’s argument. “He’s not happy.”
“The beach house,” Dean says, glaring at Lisa until she stands aside and lets him pass. He hadn’t actually thought about where he was going until she asked. But the beach house is as good a place as any to hide out.
Okay then.
“Nothing,” Dean says. But that’s not entirely true otherwise he wouldn’t have applied the brakes.
Charlie kicks him again, right on the same spot. Dean hisses. “Liar,” she says. “Tell me or I’ll tell Ellen you’re having second thoughts about Marvin and desperately want a second date.”
Even now, there’s still something she’s not telling them.
Cas patiently lets Dean show him photo after photo of his niece, oohing and aahing often enough to appease him, then he persuades Dean to make him a mushroom omelet to make up for throwing out his smelly cheese.
Thankfully, before Sam has a chance to properly break out the puppy dog eyes, they announce Dean’s leaving gate has opened giving Dean a legitimate excuse to make a run for it.
Benny just laughs. “Sure darlin’, just like you don’t cuddle.”
Cas snorts. “Don’t be an idiot.”
Cas grabs his arm when Dean sways a little. “I don’t think you are the best judge of that, right now.”
“And the hottest,” Cas says next, his voice an even deeper growl than normal.
“Why now, Lisa? Why wait until now to tell me? To ask for a divorce?”
He doesn’t know about Cas though. By all accounts, the dude went from having a large, maybe slightly insane, family around him to having Meg and then Meg and Claire. He’s probably never spent a Christmas without family by his side. That’s not a bad thing. Dean doesn’t think this year should be the first he tries to go it alone. The guy was depressed enough watching a crappy Christmas movie on his own.
“Dude,” Dean growls, storming across the room. “What the fuck?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, trying not to roll against him as the matchmaking sofa cushions attempt to squash them together.
Only once Dean has relaxed underneath him does Cas stop kissing and start talking. “You are quite possibly the most infuriating man I have ever had the good fortune to meet. And I think that jumping into a serious relationship this quickly after a failed marriage is a monumentally bad idea, especially given the circumstances. But… but when I thought you were going to leave with Benny and Carmen I was inordinately jealous. And… and I knew you were watching me that night with Alfie, I heard you come in, and it didn’t make me want to stop, it made me fuck him harder wishing it was you. The reason I didn’t go to my mother’s today was because I couldn’t bear the thought of you spending Christmas Day on your own because you… you’re not the only one with feelings.”
“Why did Mommy leave?”
Thankfully Uriel drives them back to Fairdale afterwards, although the route he takes is anything but direct. His motive is obviously to milk the opportunity to talk at Dean. As if he hasn’t done enough of that over the past three hours.
Dean stuffs the last of his belongings in his hold-all and, with a little help from Sam, manages to close it without too much cursing.
“Nothing,” Dean mumbles.
“I’m just saying—,”
“Like mind blowing orgasms that can last for hours, Dean.”
“Seriously,” the guy replies, his sky-blue eyes twinkling. “Without the shining armor, I’m afraid.”
The problem with actors is you can never be quite sure when they’re putting on a show. Not if they’re any good. Not if you don’t know them well. Dean can’t say for sure how good of an actor Mary is. But he doesn’t trust her. Not at all. But then, he doesn’t trust many people.
Cas isn’t mollified. “You should have texted me or Sam. At least let someone know what you were doing.”
“Yeah, Castiel, give it to me.”
“Easy?
“Well, you obviously haven’t watched enough True Crime documentaries, have you?” Dean quips, continuing speedily when it looks like Cas is planning Dean’s death himself, “You told me yourself, Alastair’s dead. Gone. No longer a problem. It’s the last day of shooting, that’s all. This is probably the work of one of Marv’s homophobic douchebag pals. Or a disgruntled PA that drank one too many red bulls and thought a little criminal damage was a good idea. It’s nothing.”
Dean’s whining into Cas’ mouth, shaking with need when Cain starts to chase his orgasm, his heavy balls slapping loud against Dean’s ass as his pace increases. He pounds faster, harder, the bed creaking under the onslaught. Dean screams when his knot catches, his orgasm punching through him fierce enough to steal his breath, and consciousness. Again.
Cas finds out about today’s shitfest, he's going to be pissed. But seriously, there’s only so much heartfelt concern that Dean can cope with.
If Dean could speak he’d tell Cas not to apologize. Tell him he likes it rough. Likes to be bossed about. And he really fucking likes it when it’s Cas that’s doing the bossing. Instead, he lets go of his cock, grabs the back of Cas’ thigh, and urges him to do it again.
A few hours of listening to Uriel’s sanctimonious bullcrap might just kill Dean. It’s hot as hell inside the church hall although Dean seems to be the only one bothered by it, sweat dripping down his neck, his face no-doubt growing redder by the minute. Everyone else is dressed in their Sunday best even though it’s the middle of the week, obviously doing their utmost to impress Uriel. Because of course, Uriel doesn’t just attend church, he’s the goddamn preacher. And this church is everything Dean hates about religion. It’s not even the usual brand of closed-minded, bible-thumping, give me your money and I’ll get you into heaven, bullshit. It’s worse. These people are believers. And the shit they believe, it’s insane.
“No, he was too busy getting wasted and passing out at his friend’s parties,” Cas throws back.
“And they’re adorable,” Cas says, and then coughs awkwardly. “Anyway, I’m heading out soon, so…” he draws out the ‘
“But so much fun,” Claire sniggers.
love with you anymore. You have to understand.”
Dean can’t resist kissing the surprise from Cas’s lips. “Of course I will, you idiot.”
Cas makes the godforsaken noise again, and Dean can safely say that it doesn’t sound any better close up.
Dean licks his lips, nothing more than a nervous tick, but Cas’ eyes track the movement with undisguised interest.
Dean’s heart clenches. He almost caves and tosses his return ticket in the trash right then. Instead, he gives Sam a rueful grin. “You haven’t needed me for years, man. You and Eileen have got this, I promise.”
“No. I told you, don’t touch yourself. I want to… I want to.”
“Yeah, I wasn’t real hungry,” Dean replies, despondent.
“And as long as you promise not to change the WiFi password again.”
“You want a light?” a voice says.
“And where is that exactly?” Dean asks.
So, the first thing Dean apparently has to do is get Cas the fuck out of his house.
“Dean, you okay?” Benny asks, keeping his voice low.
“Where do you want me?”
Dean’s not going to even hint that wouldn’t be awesome. But he also knows it’s not possible.
Cas spins around to face him, cutting his explanation off. “Crowley wants in your pants.”
“He’s dead,” Cas repeats.
“What?”
“Yes, I’m sure, bitch. I pay your wages.”
“What the hell, Dad?”
Dean’s not exactly dancing for joy either.
Charlie gapes at him across the table. “You went out with Crowley again? What’s that three times now?”
“I assure you we can,” exec number one says, glancing nonchalantly at his Rolex. “And if you have any sense at all, I suggest you leave the premises with as little fuss as possible.”
“Not for anyone,” Dean replies. “We ready to roll?”
“Anyone ever told you you’re hilarious?”
The oppressive heat hits Dean when they walk back inside. And the noise. Christmas pop music is blaring from the jukebox and there’s a crowd of folk on the dance floor.
The blockers were designed to stop other omegas and alphas scenting Dean, but they also stopped Dean from scenting other people. Now he’s stopped taking those little pills every day, it feels like his sense of smell has gone insane. It’s overwhelming, and really fucking annoying.
“I’m fine,” Dean snaps, pulling a face as he wipes the blood from his lips. The stuff doesn’t taste great. “I want this scene over and done with, and if I keep asking for breaks every five minutes we’ll never wrap.”
“Dean.” Sam nods.
“And how do you like Fairdale so far?” the man asks, pressing into Dean’s personal space as though it doesn’t exist.
“Handle the situation?”
him. In the end, common sense wins out. He hasn’t smoked since he was a teenager. Now, probably isn’t the best time to restart. His love of pie, booze, and bacon already makes him a prime-coronary candidate without adding nicotine to the mix. Instead, he shoves his hands in the pockets of his jeans, leans back against the wall, and takes a few deep breaths.
“What about you?” Charlie asks.
They’re both smiling at Ellen in what they must think is their most charming way. Dean is definitely charmed, but even he can see the way they’re sniffing the air and practically basking in Dean’s scent.
“Yes, she was very bossy,” Cas agrees. Dean closes his mouth. He hadn’t meant to say that out loud. “In retrospect, perhaps I should have known Meg and Lisa’s relationship was more than just that of business partners. They were always very wrapped up in one another.”
“Dean,” Cas says, leaning forward and laying a hand on his arm.
, really, Dean?
Charlie at least looks bashful when she chimes in. “Um, yeah, me too. She might be a bitch but she‘s got a wicked tongue.”
Dean suddenly has a very
“Dean, please, this isn’t easy for me either.”
“Dean,” Cain’s voice joins them, sounding more ragged than Dean’s ever heard. “You’re going to kill us before we even get started, boy.”
Dean groans. “But he doesn’t. Trust me, I was on the same date as him. There was no chemistry. None.”
“Obviously,” Dean parrots.
“A brawl might have made me feel more at home, to be honest,” Dean admits. “He ain’t exactly the first guy to think it’s okay to put his hands on me.” It’s weird how much this guy’s scent, and the surprisingly soft cadence of his voice, is doing to ease the pain behind his eyes. “How’d you know who I am anyway?”
Although Dean knows this Ellen chick is speaking sense, he’s still instinctively on the defensive. “I’m sorry there are so many assholes in the world, but seriously none of that crap happened to me. I’m fine.”
“What now?”
Cas’ eyes crinkle at the corners in concern. “Of course, Dean. Anything.”
“I said no, Dean,” Dad yells, advancing on him. “And I don’t think I’m liking this new disrespectful attitude of yours. Maybe it’s just as well we’re leaving. You need to stop hanging around with those asshole kids. I saw that boy with red hair smoking the other day behind the store. I tell you now, I ever catch you smoking I’ll break your damn fingers.”
“I see,” Dean says, although he’s not sure he does.
“Jesus,” he says, breathless, when Benny pulls away.
“Can you… I’ll tell you how you can help me, boy. You can get your pansy ass out of here and let us decent folks drink in peace.”
Cas and Sam are still talking to the police when Dean retreats back to the small studio which has been cleared of the photographer and his crew but not the bike. He strips out of his ruined jacket and shirts to let a paramedic clean his wounds and patch him up. He has a couple of eggs on his head but his brain isn’t rattling any worse than normal. The cuts on his arm and belly aren’t deep and should heal well enough. These ones shouldn’t even leave a scar. The paramedic doesn’t make a fuss when Dean declines to go to the hospital. She’s probably relieved she doesn’t have to fight her way out of the building with Dean by her side.
Dean knows Sam is worried when he lets that one go without comment.
“You’re peachy?” She repeats, rolling up the blood pressure cuff and putting it away.
“Everything okay?”
Still, he’s only a few minutes early this time. He didn’t expect to be sitting here fighting off the temptation of the basket of delicious smelling bread rolls all on his own. Especially considering this meal was Lisa’s idea in the first place. And she’d been pretty damn insistent he turn up.
“No,” Dean laughs. “No, it’s definitely not Gilda. It’s… he works here, okay?” Well, Benny does, and Cain apparently does, and Dean is not admitting that there is more than one alpha in his shady fantasies so it’s as close to the truth as he’s getting.
“Dude, you lay your hand on me again and I’ll fucking flatten you in front of your flock,” Dean hisses low.
It takes a supreme effort for Dean to focus on Cain’s words. His fingers curl around his dick as he blinks up at the three naked alphas staring down at him. God, they’re gorgeous. From Cas’ paler skin to the dark tan of Benny, from Cain’s thick grey-haired chest to the sharp cut of Cas’ hips, from Benny’s dark treasure trail to Cain’s thickly muscled thighs. Dean wants to get his mouth on each of them so badly he’s in danger of drooling.
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas says, pressing a kiss to Dean’s cheek. “Cain likes to watch.”
“But don’t you get sick of it?” Crowley continues. “The never-ending rules and endless parade of tedious alphas looking to bend you over and breed you up. Don't you ask yourself if this is it? This is all your life is? Don’t you ever just want to bugger off and go howl at the moon?”
do while your wife was busy building her business empire? Stay home with the kids? Change diapers and braid hair? Were you a soccer mom?” He’s laughing outright now, even though he’s the only one who thinks it’s funny. “Did you spend your time doing laundry and visiting the beauty salon to keep yourself pretty?”
Cas grimaces. “I assure you, it’s real.”
“Dean, Dean, Dean...” Crowley appears as though simply uttering his damned name summoned him. “Your presence can always be relied upon to provide us with some extra drama.”
“Alfie,” Cas supplies.
Sighing deeply, Cas levers himself off the sofa and fetches two tumblers from a cabinet, ignoring the array of papers and pens that fall out when he opens the door. Dean wisely doesn’t mention the mess even if part of him does want to clear it up.
Dean shrugs. The ass of his jeans is damp with wet sand and he’s wearing one sock, the other presumably lost on his run down the beach, so it seems pointless to deny the fact.
Dean’s glad that none of the alphas had a chance, or thought, to put fresh sheets on the bed because he can still smell the faint scents of Benny, Cas, and Cain mingled together on the white linen, and it’s intoxicating. A siren song beckoning him closer.
“I am,” Dean says. Cas doesn’t look convinced. “I will be,” Dean amends.
“Which is admirable,” Cain says. “But you do not always have to. You can allow other people to help.”
“Speaking of cute,” Charlie says. “How adorable are you four with your matching bow ties and vests?”
Dean slips on his full-face mask in response.
you want? You want a role in a movie? Want me to introduce you to people? You want me to—”
“Um,” Dean says. “No?”
“I…” Cas seems at as much of a loss for words as Dean for a change. Dean would find that reassuring if he wasn’t already feeling a sweeping sense of panic starting to wash over him. One of them needs to start fucking talking.
Lisa jumps up and flags down a waiter, who manages to appear both enthralled and slightly terrified all at once. By the time the poor guy manages to find a brown paper bag for Dean to breathe into, Cas has started throwing the remains of the fish platter at Meg and Lisa, and the maitre-de is bearing down on them with a determined expression.
Dean bristles. Cas knows better than to bring up his dad. “My dad did the best he could.”
She doesn’t sit down and she doesn’t offer Dean her hand.
Even Sam seems doubtful.
Charlie hands him a tissue.
Dean at least manages to take his own weight as he flips on the light and shuffles the few steps to the sofa while Crowley fetches him a glass of water. Dean guesses now isn’t the time to suggest something stronger, even though he’s sure whisky would do more to calm his racing heartbeat. He does rake through his jacket pockets searching for his cigarette pack. There should be one or two left. Nicotine might just help.
Sam turns up just as Idris and Betty from catering start belting out We Will Survive on the impromptu karaoke. Dean’s relieved that Sam missed his rendition of Mandy at least. Although he side-eyes Cas sternly for Sam showing up at all.
Dean cringes as she runs a blood-red nail down the ridge of his cheek bone. “Look, I don’t want to hurt you, but…”
“I love you too.” Dean winks.
That’s the last insult he manages before the venue’s security people finally pounce on him, and the entire audience goes batshit. It’s chaos as the guy is bundled out of the hall, spitting obscenities the whole way. Some people are yelling back at him, others are on their feet.
“Did you tell him what scenes you were shooting today?” Sam shoots back, sounding more like the snotty teenage brat he was a decade ago, rather than the grown man he is now.
“No, Jerk, I pay my wages. And everyone else’s. And deal with all the boring business shit, as you call it. And set your schedule.”
Third time's the charm, Garth says the following week when Dean’s next date is scheduled. Dean doubts it very much. But he’s polite. Well, he’s not rude at least. He doesn’t mention that the alpha’s scent is less appealing than Chuck’s unwashed bathrobe smell, and he smiles and nods when the pretentious prick prattles on in what has to be a fake British accent about wine and religious antiques for almost the whole two hours, only stopping to ask Dean if he owns a suit. He barely stops talking long enough to listen to Dean’s answer.
He does jerk off as soon as he’s alone though. And for the first time ever he even tries sliding a finger in his hole while he’s doing it. He’s never wanted to get fucked before. Never admitted to himself that he’s even curious about it. He’s always tried so hard to pretend he’s normal, like his dad always wanted, that he refused to even contemplate the idea of bending over for anyone. Even the thought of allowing an alpha near his ass used to fill him with a hot wash of shame. The suppressants and blockers helped, quashing every natural omega instinct that he had. Now though, now he has to admit that he’s aching to find out what it would feel like to be fucked by an alpha. By an alpha who wanted him enough to pursue him. By Cas, or Benny, or Cain.
The problem is Cas is looking for fun and hook-ups and nothing serious and Dean thinks he might be in love.
For all Dean knows Meg’s absolutely right, but he and Lisa have been married for eighteen years now so the scrappy start to their relationship doesn’t weigh heavily on his mind.
Dean’s answer escapes him as he spots the motorcycle in the middle of the space.
And at last there are hands brushing across his skin, cupping his face, kisses placed reverently on the back of his neck, the ball of his shoulder, trailed down the knobs of his spine. And then he’s being manhandled, gently pushed and tugged around until he’s straddling a warm body below him. And he’s being kissed so gently it’s almost frustrating except for how it’s somehow perfect.
Cas doesn’t answer immediately.
Cas waggles his finger in Mrs. Spanglers direction. “We are not giving you details, Rose. Betting on your neighbor’s love life is hardly polite behavior.”
“Because I was right there.”
“Is that why you were so happy when he wanted to go to college abroad?” Dean asks, bitterly. “You figure dumping me would be easier if he was studying thousands of miles away in the UK?”
“Thank God,” Dean says, smoothing his hand over the machine. It’s perfect. Not a scratch.
“But I like ass,” Cas argues.
“I’m going to leave you bloody and broken if you don’t start behaving, bitch,” Uriel snarls in Dean’s ear as he starts to drag him backwards.
Cas shifts uncomfortably beside him. “But…”
The both pause in their struggle when a shout echoes down the street.
“Lisa.” Dean’s voice sounds exhausted even to his own ears. “I’m not trying to trick you. The business is yours. God knows you sacrificed enough over the years to make it a success. I’m not fighting you for it. Just… don’t fuck me over.”
The doorbell rings again.
“You’re welcome to the pathetic bitch,” Abaddon sneers, backing down now that she’s outnumbered and out maneuvered.
Dean feels like he’s been punched. “Waste time? That’s what our marriage has been. A waste of time?”
Like Sammy said, not every omega dies of heat sickness if they don’t find a compatible mate. Dean’s given this Omega Den thing a shot, he doesn’t fit in, and he’s fucking miserable. He’d rather take his chances on his own than waste the next God knows how long stuck in this pretty prison.
Benny laughs, leaning over so his mouth is just inches from Dean’s ear. “We were hoping you might want to come back and celebrate Christmas with us.”
“So,” Dean turns to the studio exec’s once he’s finally damped down his urge to cackle. “You fired Marv?”
“Aaron Bass,” the guy introduces himself. They shake hands briefly, and Dean grabs the opportunity to take in Aaron’s scent, which turns out to be disappointingly nondescript, not unpleasant, just not much of anything. It’s an anticlimactic moment really, not exactly the first-meeting that movies always seemed to show. Dean would feel bad, but Aaron doesn’t seem immediately overcome by Dean’s scent either. They stare at each other silently for a moment before Dean catches on to the fact the Aaron’s waiting for Dean to sit back down before he sits. It’s so incredibly awkward that Dean has to smile as they both finally sit opposite each other.
Dean inhales, exhales, and counts to three slowly. Despite the prospect of a really hot threesome, he’s seriously regretting coming here tonight. So much for getting out there and having some fun. He’d rather be sitting in front of the television with Cas and a bag of chips right now.
“Look,” Dean says, trying his best to sound reasonable, even though sweat is beading on his forehead and his shirt is now sticking to his back. He hopefully has a couple of hours before his heat truly hits, but they don’t have much time to waste. “If this whole thing with Uriel and Zachariah has fucked up my chances with the three of you, I understand, I mean, I’ll be fucking devastated, but I’ll get it.”
Dean thought that of the three alphas, Cain would be the hardest for him to talk to. Not because he isn’t interested in the alpha but because his words have a habit of drying up when Cain looks directly at him. One glance from Cain and Dean feels like a teenager with a crush on his teacher. And after last night, Dean feels even more like a dumb kid in front of the man. But as they polish off their burgers, Cain manages to put him at ease. And not by merely ignoring the events of the previous night. He doesn’t lecture, doesn’t scold, he talks to Dean as an equal, not in any way patronizing. He explains that he’s had dealings with Abaddon before and couldn’t stand the woman even before she tried to attack Dean.
“We thought about it,” Lisa admits. “About telling you and Cas. We’d decided more than once that we had to come clean, to stop lying. But then Jimmy disappeared and Cas ended up with Claire, and Meg couldn’t just leave him. We tried to end things between us then. And we managed… for a few months. The next time we decided we had to tell you, Jess died and you were doing all you could to keep Sam afloat, and I couldn’t face hurting you any more than you were already hurting. And then your dad died. And Sam hooked up with that bitch, Ruby. And god, you were so down, Dean. And then the kids were teenagers and we figured, we figured life was tough enough without their parents divorcing.”
“I hope you’re behaving yourself with these lovely ladies,” Uriel says, arching a brow at Dean.
!” Dean repeats with scorn. “There’s always a but.”
Dean exhales in relief. “Sure, thanks, pal,” he says, turning around.
Dean shrugs, brushing off the praise as usual, even though after months of Marv’s sniping it is nice to hear. “Just doing what you pay me for.”
“Comic-Con. We’re going to blow them away. Make them forget all about Marv. But I need you there, looking enthusiastic and happy. And healthy. Not like death warmed over.”
Dean shifts uncomfortably on his lounger and grumbles, “I’m not Sam’s damn mom.”
“Maybe,” Charlie says. “But there are some advantages.”
Dean sets his cue down on the table and rolls his shoulders. Just because he doesn’t want to fight doesn’t mean he won’t kick this moron’s ass if he needs to.
He’s not about to tell Dad any of this though, because Dad smells like he’s downed a bottle of Jack. This is not the time to provoke him.
Unfortunately, not everyone is onboard with that plan. “Well, hello, beautiful, you’re new here.”
“Great, Sam, just great.” Dean sighs.
And Dean’s an idiot really. What does it even matter what this is? Sex is sex. Cas is hot, and Dean’s not gotten laid in forever. Even if this is just a one-time thing, he’d be insane not to go for it.
health, Novak? Screwing with my car.”
Dean shrugs. “I suppose I could give this place another chance. There are some decent folks around here.”
“Why do we even need a better sense of smell than anyone else?” Dean bitches. “I mean what’s the goddamn point? Was Mother Nature on crack when she came up with the whole omega/alpha thing? Is it all some big cosmic joke?”
“It’s Sam,” Sam corrects him, but without his usual ire.
“Is there something wrong?” Cas asks, eyes crinkling with concern as he leans forward.
“You think you can push me into moving out?”
Because he’s sick of getting poked and prodded and asked a bazillion stupid questions. His nose is sore, his eyes are stinging and he has a thundering headache. All he wants to do is retreat to his room and have a nap.
Thank god they pull up outside the beach house just then because Dean’s painfully aware now of just how badly his mouth was running away with him. He knows he said some stupid shit. He’s not sure he remembers everything he said to Cas but he definitely recalls mentioning Cas’ sex hair at one point. That alone is enough to make him want to hide in his room and never come out again.
The alpha gives Dean a lop-sided smile. “Well, thank you. You’re very cute too.”
Dean nods. “Okay. You meet her then, Sammy. You ask her what excuse she has for abandoning her kids and husband for over twenty years.”
Dean feels about two seconds away from bursting into tears for no good reason. It’s not something he’s willing to do in front of Cas, not now. “I think you should leave.”
discussed it? Who else knows? If you were doing this ‘unofficially.’ Who else knew what you were up to, Cas? Where you were? Because honestly, it’s not like Pam and Charlie were gonna be much help if Alastair turned on you.”
Dean doesn’t punch him, but it’s a close-run thing.
“Don’t you dare apologize again, Cas, I swear to god,” Dean warns.
“Dude,” Dean says, grabbing another bottle of beer. “You’re at a Den. That is essentially an omega supermarket for alphas.”
“Is that so?”
Dean chuckles. For as much as he dislikes crowds, for as much as this absurd amount of people under one roof should freak him the hell out, there something about the energy of the place, the chattering buzz of excitement, that calls like a siren to his inner fanboy. From a distance at least.
“Pretty much,” Charlie says, moving them deftly out of the way of a pair of octogenarians tearing around the dance floor. “He’s not over the moon, but between Gilda’s charm and my lovable personality, we’re winning him round.”
talk about this later,” he warns, pointing at Dean.
At least this is just a photo shoot. Dean’s not gonna lie, the first couple of times he worked with this guy, Alastair, he was seriously creeped out by the time he walked away. But it’s not like the guy actually touched him, not really. Nothing more than moving him from one position to the next, showing him what he wanted Dean to do. And a skeevy pervert taking photos of him is still better than a stinking pot-bellied greasy-haired pervert fucking him.
Lisa, as usual, had talked him around. The house was big enough that they could all have their own space. There were three bedrooms upstairs, one a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom for Dean and Lisa. Downstairs there was another master bedroom for Meg and Cas, as well as a huge living room, and a spacious kitchen/diner. On top of all that there was an art studio, a family-sized pool, a double garage, a balcony with stunning views and the beach was literally on their doorstep. Plus, Lisa promised they would split up the days at the house, so each family had their own time alone. It was all far too good to pass up.
Cas holds the glasses while Dean pours the vodka, taking one when Cas offers it. He only remembers how violently he dislikes the taste of vodka when he takes his first sip. The only saving grace is that it’s a decent brand and not the cheap shit that tastes like gasoline.
Cas’s expression turns stormy. “We’re travelling together in the car. I’m not discussing this any further.”
Dean doesn’t flinch at the mention of Alastair’s name anymore. But he still doesn’t like saying it. Or hearing it. Even now, Dean still feels sick to the depth of his guts when he thinks about him. About the hell he’s put Dean through for the past couple of years. And put Cas and Sam through too. There’s still a part of Dean that doesn’t quite believe he’s really gone. Despite Cas’s assurances, he doesn’t feel any closure. Any sense of relief.
“Do it,” Cas growls, slamming in hard and slapping at the guy’s ass again. “Come for me, baby.”
Uriel shoves Dean against the wall, his head crashing against the solid stonework hard enough to leave him dazed. Uriel shakes his shoulders, bouncing his head off the wall again for good measure. “Behave little O or I won’t be the only alpha knotting your virgin cunt tonight.”
With Cas walking in front, looking enough like Constantine in his trench coat, suit and with his dark messy hair, to fit right in —and draw more than a few admiring glances of his own— Dean and Charlie a few steps behind and Sam behind them, they join the crowds. Cas has people in the hallway keeping an eye on them too, but with his full mask on, Dean still feels amazingly anonymous.
Charlie kicks him, hard, under the table. “Offence taken, dickhead. What’s that supposed to mean?”
It takes a second for that to break through Dean’s concentration. And another second for it to sink in that Marv just ruined a take he wasn’t even watching to yell at a kid for messing up his coffee order.
“It gets easier,” Charlie reassures him. “The first week is the worst, I promise.”
God Almighty! Dean takes another drink. People pretend to be his mother? Jesus! Why?
The following day, Dean drags himself out of bed before dawn, stumbles downstairs, and after one cup of coffee, throws himself into cleaning the beach house. Seriously cleaning. He empties the kitchen cabinets and scrubs everything down. Tosses out-of-date tinned food into the trash, along with Lisa’s protein bars and slimming shakes. He washes windows, polishes the floors, and cleans the bathrooms so thoroughly they gleam.
“I don’t want your money,” Mary insists.
“Made a mistake,” Dean finishes for him. “Which as someone wiser than me once said, we’ve all done.”
At some point in the five hours they spent hanging around the emergency room Cas regained his sense of humor. Dean’s not so sure he’s happy about that. He thinks it happened around the same time Dean sobered up and every damn thought he was thinking stopped spilling out of his lips.
Dean wishes he hadn’t said anything. Not if he’s just going to be treated to another lecture about what a special snowflake he is just because he was unlucky enough to be born an omega.
“That is never gonna happen,” Dean promises, backing away.
The look Ellen gives him says it all. Pretty damn bad.
“Do best friends with plenty of hot sex benefits who live together and don’t sleep with other people by any chance give free massages?”
Dean’s heat lasts for four days. They don’t spend the entire time screwing around. Dean doubts he’d ever walk again if they did. In between the rolling waves of his heat, Cain makes sure they all eat and hydrate. Even finding the time to bake a pie so delicious the noises Dean makes while eating it leads to him sucking off three insanely horny alphas who should be conserving their energy for when Dean’s out of his mind with want. He sure doesn’t complain though. Kneeling on the kitchen floor while they tower over him, sucking down one cock and jerking off the other two, is one of the dirtiest things he’s ever done. And is such a fucking turn on, he comes without a hand on his dick when the first load of hot alpha spunk hits his face.
Cas leans forward, elbows on his knees. Despite Dean’s frustration he can’t help but ache for him. The guy looks spent. Drained in a way Dean has never seen before. His explosive temper earlier suddenly seems more understandable. If Dean wasn’t still pissed, he’d want to tuck him into bed and make him sleep for a week. Instead he listens impassively as Cas repeats his story.
“She thinks you're hot,” Benny says, smirking when Dean almost chokes on a mouthful of beer. “So do I,” he adds, with a lecherous wink that turns Dean’s face beet-red.
“I’m not stupid.” Sam pouts. Just for a second. “My teacher says we’re going to be making Mother’s Day cards this week.”
Dean doesn’t want to engage in chitchat. “How the hell do you
“Fuck you,” he says, sitting up slowly and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. He suspects he’s been drooling.
“Nah,” Dean says, backing away. “I don’t want to bother you guys. You’re obviously… um… yeah….”
Cas nods and sticks his hand out to the side in front of Dean. “So, truce?”
Cas’s arm tightens around Dean's shoulder, his lips brushing across the top of Dean’s head.
Cas growls by Dean’s side at the sight of Adler. Dean just rolls his eyes. He’s had more than enough of Zachariah’s smarmy bullshit.
“Ahh...
Abaddon laughs at that. “Oh lover, why do you think Crowley invited you here? You think you’re the first omega he’s tempted away from a Den? Darling, he’s a pro at seducing the innocent. Tell me… are you a virgin? He loves virgins. Loves watching them being corrupted. Ruined.”
“It was Lisa’s idea. She was very open about how much she enjoyed sex back then.”
Dean wants to say no. But Alastair promised him three hundred bucks for this. You don’t earn that kind of money for nothing.
draws to a halt, his shirt is clinging to his sweat-slicked skin and he’s fighting to draw in a breath. He doesn’t wait for the engine to stop running before fumbling at the door handle, which refuses to open under his trembling fingers. Panic bubbles up in his chest, wraps around his heart, and squeezes.
“And publicity,” Sam points out, icily.
“I’m fine,” Cas says, stretching out his hand unconsciously, the knuckles scraped but no longer bloodied. “How are you?”
“They’re… distant,” Cas eventually says. “We have a complicated relationship.”
“I love you, Dean,” Sam says earnestly. “And I worry about you.”
Dean’s five and a half, nearly six, when his daddy bundles him into the Impala along with Sammy in his car seat and tells him they’re going to find a new home. A better one. One where there aren’t ghosts and demons to haunt them. It’s dark and Sammy’s snoring softly, head tucked against the cushion of his car seat when Dean realizes they’ve left behind his teddy bear. Bear is brown and soft and missing one ear and a half an eye because he got too close to the fireplace one night, and he’s Dean’s best friend in the world. Apart from Sammy.
Uriel steeples his fingers together and hums. “And why, Dean Winchester, would it not be a good idea? You are an unmated omega and I am a wealthy respectable alpha. You should be grateful I wish to pursue you.”
“It’s fine, I guess,” Dean replies, sidestepping around him and nodding towards the door. “Excuse me, buddy, I was just leaving.”
“Benny,” Gordon scoffs. “Thinking with his damn dick. S’not okay to hit on gym members, he’s the one told me that.”
Jabbing his finger at the writing on the wall, Dean explains, “They can barely write, Cas. I mean, come on, they didn’t even spell my name right. We’re not dealing with a Mensa member here. This dude didn’t break out of Arkham Asylum, he barely made it out of kindergarten.”
Ellen curses under her breath and makes her way to the front door, her pace glacial, no doubt hoping Benny will talk Dean out of what is undoubtedly a bad idea.
“Humiliating,” Dean supplies. “Totally fucking humiliating.”
“I’m an equal opportunity kind of guy,” Dean admits. Between looking after Sam and working shifts at the grocery store and gas station, he hasn’t had much time for a social life lately. He did sleep with a few girls back in high school. Something which his dad was weirdly proud of when he found out... thank you small town gossip. Dean guesses it was easier for John Winchester to ignore that Dean was an omega if he was screwing around with girls. He probably wouldn’t be so proud if ever found out about the furtive handjobs Dean had exchanged with a few guys in the club at the edge of town.
The slap that Cas lands on Dean’s ass as he helps him to his feet is entirely deserved.
He couldn’t tell you how long he’s out for, only that when he becomes aware of his surroundings again he’s lying on his side, Benny wrapped around him from behind, Cas’ face buried in Dean’s neck, mouthing at the sensitive skin below his ear, and Cain wrapped around Cas, his hand draped over Dean’s waist.
The alpha smirks. “Aren’t you the charming one.”
“Leaving isn’t the answer.”
Crowley’s words slow down to a kindergarten teacher crawl, patronizing dick. “This is the Red Hood’s movie, darling. It needs to end with the Red Hood in all his angsty glory.”
Though he’s almost asleep in his chair, Dean keeps on reading. About his history and biology. About mates, and packs. All the information he should already possess. His lack of knowledge is no one's fault but his own. He could blame his mom for taking off, abandoning him and Sammy, leaving them without the soft touch of a maternal figure. He could blame his dad for completing ignoring Dean’s designation. For forcing Dean to bring himself up. For making him feel nothing but shame and fear at being an omega. For a shit load of things actually. He could blame his doctor for shoving pills at him without explaining the full impact they would have. He could blame his teachers for allowing him to skip out on sex-ed and healthcare classes. For failing to see that the scruffy kid with the attitude problem needed help, not detentions.
“And,” Cas continues. “If it was my mother, despite everything she’s done, all the hurtful things she said, I would jump at the chance to form some kind of relationship with her again.”
“Do you think…. you would ever want to get married? I know that after what happened between your mom and dad, marriage might seem like a… a bad idea, but if you met the right person at the right time?” Cas trails off.
Giving up on his packing for a second, Dean sits down beside his little brother, and throws an arm over his shoulder. “Sammy, if you’ve reached seventeen and still think life is fair then you’re either really damn lucky or really fucking dumb.”
In response, Cas leans down and kisses him.
“Um, okay.” That’s a little disconcerting.
has always been Dean’s therapy. The outlet for his emotions. Perhaps it’s not healthy, but it’s worked well for Dean. Until now.
Dean chokes on his vodka. Cas slaps his back until he stops coughing. “You’re shitting me! You were going to become a priest? What the fuck happened?”
“And don’t forget your appointment with Dr. Missouri,” Garth reminds Dean, cheerfully, patting him on the back before he wanders away to bug some other poor schmuck.
Dean doesn’t want to give that woman another chance. He hates her. He hates that she thinks she can just walk back into their lives and make herself at home when she’s done nothing to deserve the title of mom or grandmother. He doesn’t trust her. And he doesn’t believe she doesn’t want anything. He really doesn’t want to watch her break Sam’s heart when she up-and-leaves again.
Zachariah carries on speaking, glibly ignoring the scowls he’s gathering from the small group. “But if I hear right, you’ve been saving yourself for your mate. A noble and clever move, Dean. A virgin bride is what most alphas dream of.”
“Three dates in one day. I must be mad. Do not rush into anything,” Ellen says, looking at Dean sternly as they come to a stop outside the door. “This ain’t a normal situation. And I ain’t saying I’m surprised because you boys are all pretty damn obvious but that doesn’t mean you have to jump into this blindly.”
“Not as far as we know,” Dean returns. “Dad certainly never kept in touch with anyone. It was just the three of us. After Mom left.”
Cas bundles Dean in the passenger seat before hurrying around to the driver's side, and slamming the door behind him. He grips the steering wheel, rests his head back on the seat and closes his eyes.
Dean may not always be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he thinks Benny might have been flirting with him. And, to be honest, it feels pretty damn good.
“Here,” his dad says, taking the bag from his hand. “I’ll take this out to the Impala for you.”
!! You know what’s not easy? Growing up knowing your mom didn’t love you enough to stick around. That’s not easy.”
“Am I free?”
“Talked what over?” Dean asks, pinching his cigarette out and throwing it in a cup for now.
He lies content in Cas’s arms tracing his fingers across the outlines of Cas’s tattoos until he knows he’ll be late if he doesn’t move. Even then it’s a struggle to haul himself out of bed.
Dean nods. “No arguments from me there.”
Dean thought Dens were safe places for omegas to find a match. He didn’t realize alphas had to pay for the privilege. It makes him feel a little like a cheap whore, even if he’s not the one the money is going to. At least Ellen has made it very clear there is to be no physical contact, definitely not on the first date. A handshake, she says, is the limit.
Four days into his stay at the Fairdale Omega Den, Dean is not having fun. He didn’t realize there was so much paperwork involved in being an omega.
Dean flips over onto his belly without a word of complaint. Pillows his head on his folded arms and shimmies his ass for Cas’s benefit.
“I hate you, jerk,” Sam yells.
“Hmmm, hello, little O.”
“Hell, no,” Dean replies firmly. “I’ve done enough talking the past few days to last a lifetime. Nah, I’m just going to go ahead and get out of y’all’s hair.”
Dean’s gobsmacked. This was never an option he’d considered. Not in his wildest dreams. Not even in his wildest spank-bank scenarios. Well, maybe in his
“Whatever,” Ben huffs. “I don’t even know what the hell I’m supposed to say to her.”
Cas squints at Dean apparently oblivious to the joke. “No, I was not a fan of her taste in music. I was going to say hard liquor.”
“I’m sorry, Cas. What I said about Claire was way out of order.”
“I’m not asking you to,” Cas informs him coolly. “But the fact is I’m not leaving either.”
There’s a low hum of disappointment when he announces that Dean has been delayed which makes Dean smirk as he sinks further down into his chair. Almost immediately the room sinks into complete darkness and the screens behind the panel light up, and the hall goes quiet.
Crowley doesn’t actually seem to care about the smoke or Dean’s meltdown. He’s as unruffled as ever. Dean swears it would take an apocalypse to break through his unflappable exterior. “Would you like me to call them?”
“He told the press about our relationship in order to garner more media attention.”
“And this is your idea of fun?” Dean looks around at the gathering of people. Half-naked bodies pressed together, the smell of hard liquor, sweat and sex hanging heavy in the air. Dean can’t even tell what or who he’s smelling. The club might be full of normals or mixed with alphas and omegas. All Dean can scent is sex. And lust. Pure unadulterated desire.
That explains the smell then. It’s reassuring to know that even when Dean’s nose is defective he can still sniff out low life. Maybe some Omega Welfare agents are decent people, but the few that Dean has dealt with in the past have all been condescending morons. Looking at Zach, smelling him, Dean figures he’s definitely another one to add to the moron column.
Tonight though, Dean just wants a few hours to relax. To act like a normal 21yr old. Maybe hustle a few bucks at the pool table while he’s at it. Dad’s been gone for over a month. Sam’s stressing about exams, and, as usual, Dean’s stressing about money. If he had any sense, he’d be putting in an extra shift at the gas station, but he’s not had a night off in weeks, and a guy has to let off steam occasionally.
“Aw, baby, are you jealous?” Dean teases.
The MC introduces Crowley onto the stage first, followed by Idris, Chris, a couple of the producers, and Marie and Calli, two of the main writers.
“I… don’t understand,” Dean says.
Charlie slides in for a hug once Sam let’s him go. “The promos were awesome. And so were you. That guy seriously had a screw loose.”
“Twelve years? She cheated on you for twelve years? With Meg?”
The driver drops Sam off at his home first. Sam hesitates for a moment before climbing out of the car, but does nothing more than shake his head and glare at Dean before slamming the door behind him. Dean thinks he might hurl. He’s not sure whether it’s because of the nicotine or Sam.
Dean can’t begin to imagine himself with anyone else.
“It’s okay, I’ve got him,” another voice says. Chris nods, and steps out of the way. Perhaps guessing how vulnerable Dean feels right now, maybe figuring the guy who was pretending to kill him a second ago, isn’t the best person to help.
“Come now, Dean,” Crowley says, stopping once they reach the bar. “I thought you were broad minded.”
Charlie laughs.
“You look pretty cute yourself,” Dean points out. The white pantsuit Charlie had eventually settled on after a day-long shopping expedition that Dean had somehow been roped into, is perfect for her. And as close to bridal as she was willing to get.
"It's alright," Dean promises. He hopes it is. Sam... Sam's always been the one with a soft spot for friendly monsters, right? He'll be fine with this. He's got to be.
Jack starts crying, loud and confused and tired and done with all the noise and strange people.
Emma grits her teeth. "Does it matter?"
He shakes his head again. "But you're not any different. You're not pretending."
Claire narrows her eyes and switches to the red velvet again. "So will you be like my uncle or my step-dad?"
"Why can't we change, though? Do something different to honour the pact? I haven't killed anyone yet and I'm still strong," Emma points out. "If Harmonia really cared how we honour her, surely she'd come back and show us how to do it without getting ourselves killed."
It's nonsense and yet some part of Dean thinks he knows where this is going, because even if his brain hasn't quite connected the dots yet, his heart is going haywire in his chest as Cas gathers himself to say more.
As Cas reaches across the bench to pick up the light his sleeve catches on the vice, pulling it halfway up his forearm. He quickly grabs the edge and tugs it down, but not before Dean catches a glimpse of the rubber band he has around his wrist and the lotus flower tattooed there.
John doesn’t answer, but Dean watches the way his eyes follow Jody when she turns to grab the equipment to do a basic exam.
Cas frowns and rolls his eyes. “Wonderful,” he croaks, his voice raspy with disuse. He has barely spoken two dozen words in the last few hours and it is seriously starting to scare Dean. Cas closes his eyes again and rests his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“I’m gonna come, Dean. Come on, let me feel you,” Castiel groans. He shoves one hand between them, strong fingers wrapping around Dean, stroking him faster and harder, creating a counter rhythm for the thrusts driving Dean crazy. Dean plants his feet on the bed, pushing up so Castiel bottoms out, and lets go.
"Do you want me to come in with you?" Charlie's voice is soft and low. It's probably meant to be soothing, but it sounds patronizing.
Castiel sighs, rolling over and pressing his face to the soft hide on Juliet’s flank. Why is it too much to ask for to have both the life and the love?
Dean flips the switch on the pump and they listen to it gurgle to life. Within minutes, the water is circulating smoothly through the filter and back out into the pool. Together, they take turns walking around the deck, measuring and adding chemicals. By the time they’re finished, the sun is almost directly above them and Dean’s shirt is sweated through. Looks like it’s going to be even warmer today than they were calling for.
Dean frowns. “You paid me hourly for my time and you fronted the costs. Why would I get a cut of the profits?”
“On Saturday,” Dean confirms with a nod. “I can’t think about anything but playing this song. And then I was walking, and there was a music store with a piano. I sat down, and the notes were just there. I have no idea how I did it, but I was good enough the clerk thought I was a classically trained pianist.”
“Malachi did a number on both of us,” he soothes, running a hand over her hair in a sudden reversal of their roles.
“Dad,” Ben says, leaning forward again, “no blood. I don’t like blood.”
“Women are fickle creatures, darling. Alas, they have left me. I shall have to find another,” Balthazar rejoins, swirling his wine in the bottom of the glass. “You should be glad that men aren’t as capricious.”
This time, it’s Ellen that gasps. “Like
There is silence for a long moment before Sam clears his throat. “Because not much besides Cas bothers you.”
Dean sighs. “Uh, because you paint? The landscape in your room, it’s your back yard right? So I know you’re good. It would be neat to see people lining up to buy one of your paintings.”
on the side. Dean’s soft gasp is almost drowned out by Ben’s yelp of delight. He immediately starts rambling, touching the side of each box and listing what sounds like electronics components.
The words are daggers to Dean’s chest. He opens his mouth to tell Sam how wrong he is, but the thought of what his mother would say about recent events stops him. Dean doesn’t believe she would approve of the way John treats him, or what he’s allowed his life to become. She’d love Charlie, of that he’s certain, but she’d hate the rest.
Dean whines low in his throat and attempts to follow when Cas pulls back, but Cas just grins and pushes him down on the bed. “Roll over, Dean. On your stomach,” he says, voice thick.
“Enough, Zar. If you open another bottle, we’ll be sleeping here tonight,” she says with a yawn, then adds a sleepy, “Leave him alone.” Meg has slid down during the evening and is resting comfortably with her head on Balthazar’s thigh. If Balthazar occasionally runs his fingers through her hair, Castiel pretends not to notice.
Cas nods like he was expecting Dean’s answer and leads them into the living room. The large wall of windows at the back of the house reflect the indoor lights back at them, making it look like they’re facing a giant mirror.
“So how the hell did you even know what was going on?”
If just the thought of being strapped into a flying tin can isn’t bad enough, the way Cas curls into himself in the seat next to him makes the entire thing a hundred times worse. He doesn’t pull away when Dean clasps his hand and he kisses back when Dean presses their lips together, but it is superficial at best. He seems like he is a million miles away, trapped inside a solid block of ice that Dean can’t even begin to chip through. It is only Meg’s reassurance when she drops them off at the gate that she will meet them in Pontiac this evening that keeps Dean from panicking. It’s a sad day when Meg Masters is Dean’s lifeline.
“It took me over an hour to get the slime out of the carpet!” Candace exclaims, punctuating the end of her story with a grimace. Jolene and the other parents laugh, so Dean joins in even though he wasn’t really listening. He managed to place himself toward the side of the cluster of parents, out of Candace’s reach. She has continued to ignore his subtle rebuttals over the past few weeks, so he’s had to escalate to keeping his distance. He really hopes she doesn’t force him into an outright rejection.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Paralysis?”
Ash’s jaw is clenched when Dean looks over at him, but he unlocks it to say, “You know I’m sorry for that. I wasn’t really thinkin’ straight. Wish I could rewind and take it back.”
No matter what Ash might have said, Cas isn’t expecting the relief that shows in the other man’s eyes. “I, ah, thanks, man.” He starts to put out his hand to Cas, then pulls it back. Dean must have told him that Cas doesn’t like to be touched.
A small smile twists the corners of Cas’ mouth again, then he looks back down at the tablet in his hands. The pencil moves, short strokes followed by longer ones that glide across the paper. After a moment, he looks back up at Dean and studies him, considering, before looking back down,
Castiel clears his throat and steps back from the door so that Dean can enter before closing the door behind him. Juliet is thankfully well-behaved and Dean leans over to pet the top of her head before turning to Castiel.
After a few seconds, she sighs. “Fine.”
Dean hates the way John’s flippant words can still hurt him. “Figured you should hear it from me.”
“That must be horrible for everyone.” The extra work means Cas hasn’t heard Balthazar’s tales about his escapades with the women at the gentleman’s club down the street in over a week. There are always silver linings.
Introducing Cas and Dr. Moseley turned out to be one of Dean’s poorer ideas; now they’re both nagging him about the graduate program. Dean hasn’t told them yet, but he’s already filled out the application for the Spring semester. He thinks he’d like to study something about the role of music in American culture.
The corner of Castiel’s mouth quirks up. “It doesn't have to be hard to reach out and take what you want,” he says. “Though figuring out what that is isn't easy”—he leans back, dropping his eyes to Dean’s mouth—“even when you’re Dean Winchester.”
“You should play for us,” she says, pushing the guitar toward him.
It isn’t even the contact that has Castiel so flustered. It’s his reaction to it. He remembers full well what it was like to want Dean’s touch, to seek it out in the weeks before Christmas when he thought they’d been moving toward something more than friendship. He recalls the way he would lean into the pressure, the slight tingle left afterward so much more pleasant than the buzzing discomfort he usually felt.
Ellen makes a small, non-committal sound. “You two seem close,” she says, glancing at Dean out of the corner of her eye as she pulls the pitcher of water out of the fridge. She pours a glass and washes down the salty ham.
As soon as he got the call, Dean texted Cas, but the other man hasn't responded.  He just hopes someone is at the school to let him in to look for Benson. According to Missouri, Ben had noticed on the bus that he had forgotten the stuffed dog at the school. He was in full meltdown by the time they dropped him off.
The glow from the overabundance of lights decorating the front of the house can be seen from two blocks away as they start down their street. It took Dean hours to string them, with Ben handing the strands up to Dean on the ladder. While most of the houses in the neighborhood switched over to plain white lights in recent years, Dean continues to use the multi-colored lights that remind him of his childhood. No matter where John dragged them off to during the year, they always made the trip back to Lawrence for Christmas.
Dean has never thought of himself as the type of person who needs to see a therapist, but he’s beginning to wonder what type that is, anyway. Ellen gives him paperwork to fill out and they make another appointment for next week.
“It was the paint, but it wasn’t right paint. It’s not the paint Cas uses, and it burned my nose.” Ben picks at the edge of his sweatshirt and pushes his tongue against the roof of his mouth to click a few more times. Finally, he looks up with a frown. “Allie made a painting of Smaug, but Austin Kemmery said it didn’t look like Smaug in the movies, so it couldn’t be Smaug. Allie was sad, and I told Austin to mind his own business because it was artistic license. He’s such a jerk.”
Jody cuts him off before John can respond. “That’s fascinating, Dean,” she says, her eyes lighting up. “Dr. Harvelle does great work.”
“You did all the real cooking, Dean. I hardly did anything but stir and put it in bowls.”
“Friday.”
They continue to banter as she unloads a number of inexplicable items onto the table at the front of the room. As Cas helps, he looks up to survey the parents who have arrived and his gaze stops on Dean. For a single heartbeat, Dean is sure that Cas will continue on without even acknowledging him and his heart clenches painfully in his chest. But then Cas breaks into a wide grin, eyes sparkling with pleasure and Dean lets himself relax. It can’t be too bad if Cas smiles at him like that.
