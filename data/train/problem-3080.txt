„Good. Get your ass over there, then“, she said with an encouraging nod. „I'm gonna be proud of you.“
They stood in front of the storeroom, the darkness behind the open door like a gasping mouth. Dean groaned and turned on the lights with a fast tip upon the switch. „Of course you will. Or do you think I would wear these damn tennis shoes for free?“
The morning sun glared into Dean’s face as he arrived at his workplace. He parked the Impala, his baby, carefully at the same place behind the bakery. It gave him a queasy feeling to leave his car alone – after all, it –
Dean had the desperate urge to facepalm himself but resisted by cutting the flesh of his callused palm with his fingernails.
„...and that's the kitchen“, Dean closed his showing trip through the bakery. The kitchen was the biggest room next to the café section, the walls were yellow tarnished although they should be in a bright white; the equipment old and rusty, but they were doing there job. And it was clean.
Castiel did pretty well at serving his customers, floating through the gap between the tables with surprising elegance, the trenchcoat flowing around his legs like calming waves of a deep blue sea. Dean watched him getting a lot of happy smiles. He never had thought that Castiel would be that good at following orders with a precise and organized structure. The only thing that was hard for Castiel to understand were the humans themselves. He didn't know any of the daily manners - but at least he tried to be nice and friendly, which was working well enough to get a lot of tips.
"But you're not doing the work you should do. Remember? We‘re still searching for an apprentice." The person yelling passionately at him - Ellen - pressed a stack of paper into his arms while clever avoiding his sticky hands.
Dean tried to be patient, but it was hard as the hot feeling of anger already seethed in his stomach. „You will. We're more a café than a bakery in the traditional way. That means you will see a lot of cake, pie and fluffy cupcakes which you will give to crying toddlers and violent children. So you should be okay with that.“
In his apartment, Dean opened a bottle of cheap beer and threw himself upon the obsolete couch. He didn't turn on the TV. This time, he pulled out the black feather and watched it, watched it for minutes, watched it for hours.
„I can't do anything against the rules“, Dean warranted himself because damn, those eyes turned from creepy into puppy mode and Dean couldn't resist puppies even if he hated them.
Ellen's Bakery was just a small place in a big town but it was more special than anything else you could find there. It was a location where the spirits of bumped people came to heal their damage, but empower their specialties.
Heavy silence. Again. Just staring and moving towards each other. It was totally not okay because no one, no one ever did this. Dean always hated those movies in which something like this happened. It wasn't real. It wasn't like life worked.
He laughed humorlessly. Sammy‘s nerve-racking voice was everything he had left of his brother. What an honor.
Dean held his breath while he watched it fascinated, not sure why he was this ecstatic. Slight images appeared just for seconds in front of his eyes like bright memories, but they died too fast for him to catch them.
There was nothing between except maybe a tour into a tacky strip club on Saturday. Nothing that could remind him of what happened with Sam. Nothing that could remind him what
„Fine“, Dean said and swore. „You can keep your crappy trench for the first time. But don't mess with Ellen. When she says you will have to doff it, you will, okay?“
Before Dean could ask what she meant, Ellen stormed into the kitchen, taking along a fresh wave of air.
It made Dean feel uncomfortable. Nobody, nobody normal would react like this. This was a dumb thing only known by cheap, subprime movies. But in real life? Nah.
Castiel laughed. Little wrinkles surrounded his eyes of deep sea blue like a contrast to the innocence of his nealy childlike expression. The dark of his eye rings was outshined by his bright smile, but only a second glimpse was needed to see how tired and decayed Castiel's hand rubbed his temple, the fingers trembling like the ones of an old man.
"Do I really need to kick your pretty ass to make you stop dreaming or will you get to work now? Son, we'll get huge financial problems because of your temporary dickhead moves."
Cupcakes. Fine. Dean was great in drawing rainbows and pink unicorns with food dye upon a faceless brown mixture. Okay, that was maybe the problem – Dean was
Sam could finish his warm-up and a long run through town way before Dean was able to open a single eye. But Sam wasn’t there waiting for him anymore – there was just ‚Highway to Hell‘ playing on his nearly dead phone; it was one of the old models you could throw against a wall and the wall would break. It was like the Devil himself said ‚hello‘ to Dean every morning, throwing ice cold water into his face with burning claws.
That would be a wonderful future if that creep would really start to work at the bakery - Dean literally saw the endless hours of someone observing him.
„Let's see how this new guy is.“ He grabbed one of the aprons hanging there and tied it around himself. „Why did Charlie even know before me?“
„Don't doodle in this notebook.“ Dean said with a neutral voice. „It looks like you're not working, and you can't really see the customer's orders.“
Dean yanked his hands out of the cake batter to hold them up in a defending way. "What? I'm totally working."
The man laughed with an uncomfortable look in his blue eyes, trying to make the situation less embarrassing. „No, no, I'm just looking for a friend. We wanted to meet in this quarter, but he didn't appear.“ He scratched the skin beneath his v-neck. „He's always looking a little disheveled, disorientated, maybe a little manky, too. Has black hair and is a little bit smaller than you.“ He pointed vigorously at Dean, still smiling.
He just dozed off in front of a dull football game, his old leather jacket still upon his stomach like a cheap blanket.
He cleaned his teeth without a glance into the grease-spotted mirror. He flicked a dead fly off the sink and flung cold water onto his face.
Dean did a miserable job for the rest of the day. He made new pies without big zeal because Jo finished his old one, but every piece looked messy and bulky. Nothing he did after coming back looked great. What a surprise.
About unexpectedly coming out to Dean that morning, the things that Pam had said, rebelling against his father, Anna’s strange behavior, leaving for college, The Whispers, the panic attack, the recurring dreams, Meg’s revelation that maybe there was more to Dean than he’d been willing to admit.
Tonight, The Old Park is abuzz with young people for neither the first nor last time as Castiel pushes Meg’s squeaky car door open and rises from the battered cloth seat before shutting it with a click behind him. Now that he’s here in person, it doesn’t even take spotting Dean yet before he starts to feel his insides twist.
Meg tugs on Castiel's hand, urging him to walk with her. Her knowing smirk is lost on her best friend, who can't seem to look away from Dean. "Alright, Romeo. Let's get you to bed."
"You move like you've known each other six lifetimes over and look at each other like you're God's gift and he's something worth praising. Makes my insides all warm and fuzzy. I hate it because it doesn't belong to me. I love it because damn, what a sight you are when falling in love."
"Shit, my bad, sorry!" A vaguely familiar male voice says. He catches Cas by the arms as they nearly collide.
"Both of my boys are here!" Kelly, Anna’s receptionist, beams as he approaches the check-in desk with Steve at his feet. Kelly has a warm smile and a welcoming voice, and Cas was always glad to see her.  "How are you, Castiel?"
As they drive through the city, music flowing through every open space between them, he soaks in his surroundings like a polaroid snapshot. Summer air whips through the car, twirling Meg's loose curls around her face. Dean is grinning, eyes on the skyline that stretches out alongside them like a warm hello and a soft goodbye. Castiel holds his hand out of the window, feeling the air push back against him. The daylight is loud and demanding, but the night is quiet and full of promise.
No, wait. It's a phone. A phone is lying next to Castiel's face, and it's vibrating, making his head throb on cue with each
This seems to work, for the most part, and Anna offers a smile that doesn’t meet her eyes. “That’s great! I know how hard you’ve worked to get where you are. You will excel just like you have for the rest of your school career. We’ll miss seeing you here, but my colleague, Hannah, is so excited to meet you. She’ll be sure to take great care of you.”
"You didn't tell me we were reprising our Will and Elizabeth costumes," Castiel says when Meg steps out of her car the following afternoon. "Is that a weapon at your waist, Miss Swann?"
The thought opens up a sad pit in Castiel’s stomach. All this time he’d spent ignoring Dean at his father’s request, they could’ve been getting to know each other. What pointless prejudice was worth letting a young man remain alone even in a room full of people?
It's well into the night (morning?) when Castiel finds himself in an upstairs bathroom with no recollection of how he got there. What he does know is that he's absolutely shitfaced in the worst possible way and the farther he disassociates, the more uneasy he feels.
"Well, she thought you bailed on her because you pulled a fuckin' Houdini and disappeared, so she left to see if you'd gotten yourself lost wandering down the street. I think she was glad it wasn't some side piece answering your phone, too." He glances down at the phone, pushes some buttons, then looks back up. "Anyway, I, uh, think I know where your place is. Can't miss that beautiful blue 1969 Mustang out front. Seen your dad driving it around town."
“I’m checking on you later, so don’t ignore me,” Meg tells Cas when they pull up to his house. She looks back at Dean. “Am I taking you back to your house?”
"I promise you that my favorite color being yellow is one of the least interesting things about me," Castiel says one day when they are at The Old Park's gazebo together. Dean had been excited to show off his homemade EMF detector after they'd spent the previous night debating what ghost hunting show was the best over text. The debate had carried over into the next day, and he was trying to defuse their disagreement by asking random questions instead.
The boy's name is Dean. Noted class bad boy, popular with the ladies, and infamous in his own right for various reasons.
"If you'd dance with me, it'd get better," She offers, shimmying her shoulders in mock seduction and holding out the hand not occupied by a can of cheap beer.
Even with the radio playing, the atmosphere is heavy with quiet. Meg casts an apologetic glance at her best friend, who won't look at her, and shifts into drive. He can't recall a time she'd ever seemed genuinely embarrassed about something she'd said, but this had to be as close as it got.
“Hey, don’t cry,” The worrying way Dean is looking at him only makes him want to cry more. “Don’t cry. Here.” He crawls over to Cas’s side, kneeling beside him and placing his hand gently on his shoulder. “What do you need?”
“Ah, well. I just say what they tell me to.” She winks. There’s something about the way that she shifts in her seat that makes it seem like she’s a bit shaken and trying to hide it. “I’m sure it’ll all make sense one day.”
“I’ve been well,” he says, looking back to her. “There was a brief incident on the night of my graduation... I overindulged in alcohol. It got a little loud for a moment, but I got home safely. I made a new friend in the process if that’s any consolation for my mistake.”
A week later, the afternoon sky is overcast and eerily beautiful with the promise of rain to come as Castiel steps out of his father's old Mustang onto the gravel parking lot.
"No problem. Meds, huh? You seem like the type to always have it together, so it can't be because you have any screws loose."
He sighs, dragging every bit of courage he can to the surface before wrapping the towel securely around his waist and opening the door. His room is right next to the bathroom, so the trek isn’t far, but it
He can hear Dean telling the girls to wait there, but he doesn’t slow his pace to see if he’s being followed. Instead, the faster his heart beats, the faster he walks. By the time he’s clear of the crowd closest to Pam’s tent, he breaks into a run. He can hear Dean calling his name from somewhere behind him, but it’s nearly drowned out by the frantic pounding in his head.
"I'm glad you hit me with a door, too," Castiel says. He makes a failed attempt at feigning seriousness but can't hold back the chuckle that bubbles up in his chest. Dean holds his somber expression a little bit longer before he starts giggling, which just makes both of them laugh harder.
He laughs to himself. Dean is practically adorable when he’s excited about something. His endearing little quirks are not something Cas
"I guess I love you, too," He'd answered, like it was no big deal, but only because he didn't want her to be embarrassed. Meg wasn't much for affection, and she sure as hell didn't share her feelings with just anyone. To be loved by her was a privilege few had.
Castiel had worked hard to be the perfect student, coming out on top with excellent grades across the board. At the top of his class with scholarships galore and sashes over his graduation gown to show for it. Most importantly, he's earned the first proud smile he's ever seen on his father's face when the principal calls his name to walk the stage.
Stevie doesn’t miss a beat. Castiel swears they function on the same wavelength. “I think we should. See you guys later.”
"That they did," Dean says, saddling up close to Cas as if things hadn't just been wildly awkward between them.
Thank fuck he doesn’t hear Cas’s breath hitch over the sound of the video blaring on his screen. Seeing Dean in his room, on his bed, dressed in his clothes, feels all too personal. Like he’d laid some type of claim on him.
The way Cas and Meg's duo turns into a trio is practically seamless. One would never be able to guess that Dean had been a stranger to them nearly three weeks prior.
He's so wrapped up in the anger that finds itself building in his chest that he doesn’t notice Meg moving to leave.
yikes! it's been nearly two months, but i swear i haven't given up on this fic. i've just been Going Thru It. sorry if this chapter is lacking, i may come back with some edits later. the songs for this go round  are yellow by coldplay and solider, poet, king by the oh hellos. ps thank y'all sm for the kudos. 🥰
That didn't invalidate the fact that when he looked at her, there wasn't a doubt in his mind that he'd be by her side for the rest of their lives. He didn't care that they were just two kids. She was his soulmate, if only platonically. That didn't mean he couldn't have more than one. Fairytale rules be damned. He just didn't know when he'd meet him.
He eyes a newly added statuette of Michael, namesake of his brother, who strikes down a foe in stunning porcelain detail as she begins their session.
She turns to him with a wicked smile and throws the car in reverse, sending people behind them scattering.
She does the same with him and nods over his shoulder to whoever is behind them. There's lingering mischief in her eyes when she says, "Winchester."
If you didn't know them personally, you'd think they were just another couple who couldn't keep their hands off each other. That is far from the case.
She tilts her head, challenging him wordlessly. The five stages of grief seem to play across Dean’s face before he says, "I’ll probably live to regret it, but fuck it. Let's go."
He hasn’t broken his focus from his phone screen yet, so Cas uses it to his advantage and grabs his clothes as fast as possible while keeping his voice nonchalant. “Keep it. I wouldn’t want to upset the rock gods with my misuse of vintage concert tees.”
"Stay away from the Winchesters, Castiel. Stay away from Dean." His father's voice was stern and absolute. With that, he returned to his meal.
He is struck by the feeling of being in a dream yet again. Everything around him seems to flow so smoothly, from the way the boy's lips next to him move along to the lyrics to the yellow glow of passing streetlights dancing on their skin. He notices that Dean has freckles, faint and spattered across his cheeks like tiny constellations, that offset how rough around the edges he usually seems in an endearing boyish way. There's something soft about him up close that Castiel can't place; like this version - one that is perfectly at ease and not playing the part that the daylight expects of him - is the real Dean.
At some point, he must've woken up to stumble into Meg's bathroom and looked at his phone, where one text from Dean's newly added number was waiting for him.
His father had taken down all of her pictures when Castiel was born and packed them away somewhere secret, so he had no idea what she even looked like. Though, according to other's accounts, her genes ran deeper through him than they did through the other Novak children.
been someone with one poster on his wall. Until one day, he’d tacked up a photobooth strip of him and Meg that made him happy. Then came a bee-unicorn keychain from Charlie. (“When I saw it, I thought of you and Meg’s friendship meet cute story!” she’d told him when she’d gifted to him for his birthday.) From there on out, the collection had grown, like an oversized crow’s treasure trove. Post-it notes and polaroids, quarter machine rope necklaces, lyric sheets out of CDs he’d long since lost, wristbands from concerts. If he could staple, tape, or tack it, it was there, a memory book of his life.
"Enough of the trauma talk, boys," Meg says, giving Castiel's wrist a gentle squeeze. "Who wants to play truth or dare with me?"
What Meg and her quips don’t know is that there are a few talks the two hadn’t had in their time spent alone together. The Gay Talk was one of them.
"Fucking hell," Meg says, kneeling beside him to tuck a pillow under his head. "I lose you at a party one time, and you end up pulling up to my house in the middle of the night with the one person your dad would lose his shit to see you with." She lays a blanket across him and runs her fingers through his hair. "I don't know what to do with you."
“Damn right you wouldn’t,” Dean lowers his phone, sitting up. “Whoa, dude. Put some clothes on, will ya?”
Castiel could be imagining the way Dean’s chuckle seems flustered. The way his fist clenches in his lap, however, is another story.
They feel forced and painful now, tracking down his cheeks like wet fire. He lifts his head, pleading with his eyes. He doesn’t know what he’s pleading for. Dean can’t save him from this. No one can.
They stop and chat with a few of their friends from school, catching up with everyone’s antics from the night before. Charlie did her first keg stand, which she describes in full, glorious detail. Stevie fills in the story with the aftermath, which involved Charlie being sick to her stomach and living to face regret.
That night, he watched her sleep curled up in the pillow fort they'd built in his room and realized: maybe this was enough. Maybe, in another life, they could've fallen in love at first sight like the handsome princes and beautiful princesses in storybooks do; they'd kiss, sparks would fly, and they'd live happily ever after as perfect soulmates. But that wasn't them, not in this reality. Meg wasn't some princess in need of saving. She could slay a dragon just as easily as any white knight, and she'd do it with a grin on her blood-smeared face. And Castiel knew if he were ever to offer true love's kiss, he wanted it to be another prince on the receiving end.
Valid point. Give Meg a trip to the thrift store and a sewing kit, and she'd come out the other side with an impressive set of coordinating outfits every time. It was another talent she'd taught herself out of spite back in eighth grade when the class mean girl told her that she and her "weird boyfriend" would surely lose the costume contest at the school's annual Fall Festival. He can still remember the poor girl's face, devastated in her crinkled Party City Cinderella dress, as Meg carried their first place trophy off the auditorium stage.
but that doesn’t mean you can’t still make a life for yourself. For Sam. I don’t need to see the grades you made in high school to know you are intelligent, clever, ambitious… kind. You’ve got a good heart, Dean. Don’t let your self doubt break it.”
There are a few things Castiel regrets the next morning. Some he could forgive himself for. Drunk-sleep texting Dean is not one of them.
Coming home absolutely blasted at 3 AM with Dean as his designated driver may be pushing it, all things considered.
Cas gives a wave, watching the sleek blue car drive away and feeling a lot like a child being dropped off for after school soccer practice – only it isn’t soccer practice. It’s an appointment to see his psychiatrist.
The Novak’s neighbor, Marv, had offered it in addition to hourly pay in return for Castiel's help running his secondhand bookstore (and the only bookstore in town) during his high school Summers leading up to graduation. It had needed some work, but he'd tended to the old beast every chance he got, determined to give her new life. Now she waits in the garage for her opportunity to finally hit the open road when Castiel leaves for college in the fall. His father joked that he was fairly sure Marv was just glad to finally have one less yard ornament, but Cas couldn’t have been prouder when he’d cranked the engine and heard it rumble to life without a hitch for the first time.
"No, you can ask. I'm the one who brought her up." He turns to face the setting sun, skin crawling with memories he'd never gotten to make with a woman he'd never known. "I never met her. She died giving birth to me. I've been told she was very kind and very beautiful. Though I suppose people say things like that often to children whose mothers are dead, as if it helps to know I took part in cutting that beauty and kindness away from the world. My father never speaks of her. It was a dark time for him, as you could guess. So I only know what others have told me."
“I do,” he rasps. “I promise, pup. Nothing’s going to happen to you or your papa as long as I’m around, and I plan to be around for a long, long time.”
“Keep eating and I’ll tell you.” When Dean takes another obedient bite, Cas nods. “Well, I tend the rose garden in the mornings. It’s rather expansive and requires a great deal of upkeep. It pays for itself, of course, but it is a lot of work.”
“Let me order lunch for everyone,” Cas says firmly. “I’d like to show my appreciation for the two of you assisting me.”
Castiel looks up from where he’s studying at his desk. He’s wearing sweats and a t-shirt, something he’s begun doing recently and is directly Dean’s influence.
Cas tilts his head in confusion. “Tended bar? Applied for employment? Attempted to secure an interview? Whichever applies most to what’s making you nervous at the moment.”
Dean’s whining is interrupted by a piece of bread being pressed to his lips. He blinks, then watches with keen interest as Castiel chuckles at him.
“I was in America when Hannah, an old friend, reached out to me about Alastair… And the rest, as they say, is history.”
Dean is well-versed in Castiel’s nightmares. He knows about the variety of psychiatric institutions Castiel’s mother forcibly admitted him to as a child, about the kind-hearted nurse, Missouri, who figured out that Castiel wasn’t insane and helped him become emancipated at sixteen, about the struggles Castiel still has with anxiety, overstimulation, and self-worth.
“Hmm?” Cas hums, busying himself by pulling out one of the thin towels they use to filter the coffee grounds out of their cups. His lack of eye contact is rather conspicuous. It makes the suspicion buzzing in the back of Dean’s mind even louder.
“I just thought… Well, you’re a bartender, and I know how to run a restaurant, and it’s already pretty much set up as a bar. I was thinking how nice it would be to have something of our own.” He takes a deep breath. “And you could bring The Colonel in and he could hang out in the office, and eventually, we’d hire a few people, and there’s room for a dance floor in there, and I know you have ideas at the bar that they’re not letting you utilize, and I-”
Everything falls into place, then. The exhaustion, the trouble focusing, the increased caffeine intake.
Sensing that this is something Cas needs to do, Dean nods his acquiescence and obeys. He’s asleep as soon as his head hits the mattress.
Deans not stupid. He knows what he looks like, and he knows what another man’s interest looks like. He just doesn’t give a fuck. How could he? He has Cas.
He sleeps fitfully until the first rays of morning sun drape themselves across the farm. It’s far earlier than he normally rises (when he’s not on a job, anyway), but the thought of staring at the ceiling for any longer is unbearable.
To his utter horror, Dean hears himself blurt the words out with no amount of finesse or smoothness whatsoever.
The name shocks Castiel. He feels his face cool as the blood he does indeed possess enough of drains from it, making him paler than normal, he’s sure. His limbs are alternately almost numb and far too sensitive. His fight or flight response has him struggling to keep his fangs hidden. He pointedly doesn’t look at Dean.
His genuine dreams are flashes of green watercolors on white paper, glowing blue eyes, and The Whispers singing Led Zeppelin as he reaches out to take Dean's hand. Their fingers are about to touch when the sounds of a car door opening shake him from sleep.
The tile floor does suddenly look cool and welcoming, if not a little blurry. Castiel slumps down, closing his eyes at the blissful change of temperature. He wants to ask for Meg, but he can't seem to get the words out past the acid in his throat.
Castiel takes it, allowing himself to be pulled unsteadily to his feet, and Dean pulls him back into his arms like an anchor keeping a ship from drifting out to sea. He feels a hand rest at the back of his head and buries his face in his best friend’s shoulder. He knows his tears must be soaking through his clothes, but all Dean says is, “I’ve got you.”
Dean offers a lighthearted chuckle. "Thanks, Cas. I'll see you around." He gives a short wave and shakes his head as he walks away.
It's almost easy to forget that every night, he's been dreaming of The Whispers growing angrier about the time the pair spend together, just like it's almost easy to forget that he's been rushing out the door to avoid his dad asking what he and Meg are doing for the day and telling himself that withholding information and lying aren't the same.
Cas is inches away from losing the last shred of self-control he has, but he won’t make the first move. He’s got to be sure Dean wants this just as much as he does.
He scrubs his face too aggressively before shutting the water off and stepping out of the shower. He’s halfway through toweling off when he realizes he’s forgotten his clothes, which earns another anguished face rub and wondering if he’d manifested the thought of getting everything humiliating and otherwise over with at once.
He shows Dean into his room and shuts the door behind him as if that will make a difference if his father
Castiel had planned to bring it up, once. Then Dean made a thoughtless joke about something being "super gay" later that day and he had decided it was best to keep it to himself for now. Sure, Dean could be a flirt, it was just a part of his personality; Cas had seen it in action plenty over the past month they'd spent together. But he would never be romantically interested, no matter what looks Meg thought she saw. Dean simply talked about women - and their assets - far too much.
“That’s what I said." The set of her lips are so tight, he can nearly feel her teeth clench by just looking at her.
"As for flowers... sunflowers. There's something joyful about them. They were my mother's favorite, as well, from what I've been told." He instantly wishes he could take his words back.
The young scholar is, undoubtedly, a bit neurotic. His psychiatrist will tell you that it comes with the funny little mental illness that he takes medication for every morning. But this evening, entrapped by the surrealism of his high school career coming to an end, he does not have time to feel his usual nervous disconnect—just pride.
“Same old shit. Dad’s going to be gone a few days on a hunting trip. I’ve heard that before.” He keeps his eyes averted, running a hand across the back of his neck. “Hey, do you maybe wanna take your car for a spin tomorrow? I know somewhere we can go, backroads.”
He was always somewhere out of reach. Always silent, but something about him called to Castiel. The need to get to him was almost maddening, like Dean held secrets Castiel was destined to hear. Every time he got too close, though, his father's voice would ring out around him, echoed by The Whispers, telling him to stay away. He wanted to question them, to ask them why. When he went to speak, nothing came out. They'd silenced him.
At first, Castiel finds himself nervous that Dean won't find him interesting without Meg as his buffer. The theory is easily dismissed when they begin spending time together, even on the days Meg is working her annual Summer job as Ruby's assistant. Being with Dean is effortless, while most interactions in Castiel's life have been anything but. His "people skills" were notably "rusty," and Meg was the only one who really took him as he was. It was hard for him to feign polite interest in things he didn't care about, superficial interactions nearly pained him to participate in, and a lot of time had been spent training himself to catch social cues on what should and shouldn't be said aloud. With Dean, though, he doesn't find himself needing to censor his thoughts or words like he does with some people. Most surprising of all, when silence forms between them, he doesn't feel the least bit uncomfortable.
Dean flushes the toilet before crouching down beside Castiel and swiping the sweat slicked hair off his forehead. His fingers are gentle, foreign, and seem to linger. Maybe that's just because the world feels like it's tilting and time is dragging out alongside it.
Not missing a single beat, Meg asked, "Yeah, but have you seen the new exchange student, Rowena? I love a redhead. And that accent..."
There's also a little black cat named Steve who lives on the front porch, always twisting around the chipped railings or slumbering on the wooden steps. Today, he greats Castiel with a happy little "mrrrow".
"I haven't lived without it, so it's normal to me. Unfortunate and occasionally irksome, but nothing I’m not used to." He can’t bring himself to make eye contact all the same; he always feels slightly alien talking about the crossed wires in his brain.
He leads Dean inside, too exhausted to feel paranoid about the scenarios involving his father coming home early that are poking incessantly at his brain. At this point, everything that can go wrong might as well so he can get it all over in one day. He was far past halfway there.
What to call him, then? He recalls the last movie they’d watched together, The Lost Boys, Dean’s favorite. Dean had gone on a whole rant about how Kiefer Sutherland was “legendary” as the lead. That’s it-
Ruby is in full support of this heedless adventure, though she can hardly believe that reserved young Castiel Novak is ready and willing to sit in her chair and have a needle shoved through his skin. "This is awesome. I love seeing the nerdy ones finally do something they normally wouldn't."
She shrugged and glanced away as if she'd been caught doing something she shouldn't. "I just love you, I guess."
“Yeah, bud. No problem.” He rests his hand on Cas’s shoulder again and gives a gentle squeeze, concern lingering in his green eyes. “Any time.”
"Now we're getting somewhere. I look at women the same way I look at men. I've also got one foot in the closet until we leave this town and get far, far away from this shithole where my homophobic family members can't watch my every move."
"A pair that doesn't look like they make any fucking sense, but actually makes perfect sense. Misfit gay solidarity."
Just like that, Dean seems to read his mind. “Do you need me to- to hold you? Give you space? Shut the fuck up?”
Meg doesn't even acknowledge his words, asking, “What are you and Dean-o doing tomorrow? Charlie posted on Facebook that there’s a ren faire, and I just knew he would love that nerdy shit.”
He matches her energy and rolls his eyes. "Have you ever considered, maybe, I am not well equipped in the art of making new friends? Or that I should even be doing any of this in the first place. You've led me astray, Miss Masters."
“Nothing that made much sense,” He replies, unable to help the way his voice rasps. It feels like his whole body has just been violated, though he won’t tell her that.
Dean focuses everywhere but on Cas, then takes a long look at his friend's face as if this were the first time he'd ever really seen him. His features twist into something painfully close to annoyance, and he nods before climbing in the back.
The chorus of “Ramble On” shatters the moment, Dean’s phone buzzing incessantly from his pocket, and they jump back from each other. He pulls it out, nearly choking on his words for a moment.
"Than telling him I'm-" He stops short, remembering that he doesn't know this person at all. His sexuality is still murky waters that he'd rather not tread with strangers. "Than telling him I'm out participating in these types of activities."
“Dude, I hope you know you’re not getting this shirt back. I swear this is vintage, and it’s sacrilege to let someone who can’t name all five band members own it.”
The sound that leaves him is strangled as he swallows back an audible sob, his hands wringing in his lap. He wants to hold on to his best friend and not let go. He wants to push him away so he can breathe. Breathing hurts. He’s trying so hard not to hyperventilate. He’s shaking. He’s shaking, but he’s holding Dean’s gaze and willing himself to focus.
He follows her down a short hallway that ends in a single white door to the left, one that is all too familiar to him, much like the red leather chair that waits for him across from Anna’s grand mahogany desk. Her study is a small room, always filled with the smell of woodsy scented candles and the soft sound of violin music coming from who knows where, and the vast majority of the space is taken up by the colorful rows of medical books that line the wall-to-ceiling shelves behind her. Anna's being religious is heavily implied by some of her decor, though Castiel has never personally asked her about her beliefs. Relics like intricate crosses and angel figurines hide among her literature collection; a framed bible verse sits next to a leatherbound book on anxiety disorders, reading “She is cloaked in strength and dignity and laughs without fear of the future – Proverbs 31:25” in rolling script.
he thinks, shifting restlessly. The same goes for the sheer amount of people in the huge two-story house, but he's hanging on for Meg's sake. Barely.
Cas gives a nod and Dean slides in, leaving the door open. “I can’t wait until I get to have one of my own.”
She's dressed to the nines in her pirate costume from two Halloweens past with some added embellishments, including the sheathed (presumably fake, but one could never be sure with Meg) dagger at her hip. She's quite the vision - all flowy fabrics, leather belts, and matching boots with the three-cornered captain's hat she'd found at a yard sale years ago placed on her head. Her eyes are lined dark and a new set of dangle earrings sway with her hair when she talks.
"Thought what? Are you going to tell him about my father hating him next? There's another talk we haven't had that I'd love for you to bring up at an inconvenient time."
They meet each other’s eyes across the small space between them, falling into a companionable silence. Castiel knows he should look away. That it’s long past the point of reasonable eye contact. If it were anyone else, he would.
Castiel falls back onto the floor, running his hands along his face and taking in a deep breath, exhaling with a "Fuuuuck."
His eyes dart around the room as if holds the answers to what must be very well practiced magic tricks. She could have had itching power on her hands or something, right? Only this doesn’t itch. It almost feels like it’s
Cas lets the scalding water wash over him, scrubbing at his skin and hair as if it could take away the weight of his worries if he tried hard enough.
He wipes his hands on his jeans and takes what’s supposed to be a deep breath but comes out more of a pitiful huff. He doesn’t often feel sorry about his “quirks” as his father calls them, but they do come as quite an inconvenience when he is faced with things he can’t guess the outcome of.
“I’ve gotta say, I saw you as more of one of those weird minimalists that hangs like, one fuckin’ poster on his wall,” Dean observes, walking over to the wall across from Castiel’s bed. He smiles. “But this is a lot more… you.”
"What are you saying? Give me that right now, Megan!" He jumps up and dives onto her bed in one fluid movement, but Meg is up and running across the room, still typing.
"I do have what you could call a few 'screws loose,' I suppose." Castiel could swear that even in the muted lighting, Dean develops a bit of a blush, but he cuts off his sputtered apologies. "I’m not ashamed of it; it just doesn't usually come up in casual conversation."
But Dean’s eyes are truly bewitching, a shade of green he’d only read about in books. He’d spent a lot of time thinking about them lately, but that wasn’t all. He was so beautiful, in earnest. It didn’t take having feelings for him to make that true. His light brown hair never seemed out of place, while Castiel’s always seemed to be ruffled. His nose fits perfectly with his other features, splashed with freckles that stood out better after a day in the sun. They spread out over his lovely cheekbones that were just as strong as his jawline. His lips…
“Of course, Anna. Always a pleasure to see you as well.” She’d made it clear that she preferred he call her by her first name instead of her title long ago. It was likely a gesture to build trust between them and make seeing a professional seem less intimidating, what with Castiel first coming to her so young, but he’d never questioned it. It was a thoughtful gesture, if so.
"Aww, he wants to know how you're feeling, how sweet," Her tone is mocking, but only to poke fun at him. "He also wants to know if we wanted to go to another party tonight at The Old Park. You know I'm always up for seeing who wipes the fuck out trying to skate in the empty pool."
He, his little brother Sam, and their father John had breezed into town right before the start of Castiel's Junior year, attracting the expected amount of gossip amongst the tight-knit community about their arrival. The story was that John and his then-pregnant wife, Mary, had previously lived there for a brief time before abruptly leaving in the middle of the night and not returning. Rumors differed as to why they left, but even the nosiest of neighbors wouldn't speak too terribly ill of Mary, who had since passed away. Castiel's father never once spoke on the subject himself, so he found himself taken aback when he mentioned the new kid, Dean Winchester, playing a prank on the hellish math teacher one night at the dinner table only to be cut off with a sharp "Winchester? As in John's son?"
He glances back over his shoulder to watch the sleek black Impala pull away from the curb, engine revving as it drives away.
“I’m glad to hear that it wasn't severe. I know I don’t have to tell you, but, as your psychiatrist: don't forget that alcohol and your medication react poorly. Potentially triggering an episode is dangerous, Castiel.” She makes some notes as she talks, brows knitting together for a moment. He knows she isn’t purposely trying to make him feel guilty, but he shifts uncomfortably under the weight of her words all the same. “Tell me about this new friend, though?”
Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe Dean’s not even here. Maybe last night was all one big delusion, and none of it even happened. Maybe-
"A week ago, I wouldn’t have even entertained the thought of disregarding my father’s wishes like this. Am I just late to full-blown teenage rebellion?"
Meg snickers. That's one way to put it. She would tell you that her parents are just a bit… complicated… but that they love her in their own messy way. Castiel knew that was true to a point, but he could never quite make peace with the fact that in all the years he'd known them, all they'd ever done was chase the youth they lost to raising their only daughter as an infant. They always show up for things like graduations, birthdays, and holidays, at least. Still, Meg had spent a lot of time raising herself in the blank spaces between those occasions. She was used to alone until she met Cas.
“We were just saying how nice it was that you helped Cas out last night when he joined the ranks of us who are still nursing hangovers today.” Charlie was known to blurt things out regardless of the level of awkwardness they caused.
However, there's a first time for everything, and the excess of alcohol has removed personal space from the equation. The song playing is going on about "everybody in this bitch getting tipsy," but he's far past that. Every thrum of the bass makes his head spin deeper. He can't break his concentration on Meg because when he does, he swears The Whispers he'd hear often before he started his meds are there, waiting with something to say.
They meet each other’s eyes behind Dean's back. There’s a brief moment of silent communication only mastered from knowing someone over half of your life, but they both seem to agree that they don’t disapprove of the idea, though they are both surprised he seems to want to continue hanging out with them.
He notes that Amanda must not be as important as he had originally guessed because Dean doesn't bother to tell her goodbye at her own party. He finds his mouth speaking without his brain's permission again when he questions, "Don't you want to tell your girlfriend goodbye?"
She starts to make him a spot on her bed like usual, but the floor looks so irresistibly comfortable, and he decides that it's the ideal place to sleep. He falls to his knees, flopping unceremoniously onto his back with a noise of contentment.
"Please. My standards are higher than that." He pushes off of the door frame and downs the last of his drink before changing the subject. "You know, you promised to get me drunk so we could live out our dying youth. All I am is bored."
He says it in a way that's only half-joking with an edge of genuine concern to it. Like Dean doesn't have the type of dad who grounds him for a week when he does something foolish. Castiel doesn't want to assume, but he feels a tiny pang of guilt, knowing he can usually get away with things, what with being the baby out of four kids.
He hadn’t had a surprise anxiety attack in years, not with perfect use of his medication, but it wasn’t unheard of. Sometimes they’d creep up on him without a trigger and there wasn’t much he could do about it. It was ill-timed instances like this that was always the worst.
“Stop looking at me,” He mutters, flinging the nearest pillow on her bed at her, which she neatly dodges and promptly threatens to suffocate him with it.
. He squints, hard, but can't seem to keep his eyes open. The light is too bright, and the ringing from earlier has returned, growing louder with every second. Filling the room, filling his thoughts. He can hardly think, screwing his face up against the pain building in his head. Just when he's tempted to reach up and cover his ears, it stops.
He does as he’s told, if not hesitantly, their hands clasped on either side of the crystal ball. Pam closes her eyes, her perfectly arched eyebrows coming together in concentration, and begins.
“I’m no mechanic, but Marv used to be when he was young. I’d say I’m a quick learner. My father would say I can’t stand the thought of being told I’m incapable of doing whatever I set my mind to. Regardless, I got it done.”
"Don't think you need to treat him any different," Meg says, always on the defense when it comes to the possibility of people judging him. "He just hears voices if he doesn't take his two pill breakfast of champions."
“It was nothing.” His voice sounds lower than usual if that were even possible. He clears his throat. “I’m fine now.”
“A Son of God will father the moon,” she says, her voice low. “A Daughter of Man will birth the sun…”
"For one, you puked in front of the guy then told him he was pretty, yet he still wants to see you. The ice isn't just broken. It’s shattered." She tosses a piece of popcorn and he catches it in his mouth without moving. They’d had a lot of practice. "Secondly, you've led yourself astray. I'm just along for the ride."
Reaching the edge of the sidewalk outside of Amanda's house introduces a new problem: getting into the shiny black car in front of them without him falling on his ass. It doesn't seem to phase Dean at all - he opens the door with Castiel still on his arm and easily gets him seated and buckled in like he's done this a million times. Maybe he has.
of the infamous Dean Winchester to even really get to know him. The only person he appeared to share anything more profound with was his little brother, Sam, but with a four year age gap, it was rare to catch them together at school.
His chest is hitching, short little breaths that won’t allow for much air. He can hardly process the people he passes or the looks they give him. He slows once he’s out in the parking lot, and though he can’t think straight with his thoughts speeding like they are, he manages to make it back to Meg’s car before leaning against it and collapsing. The first gasp for air feels like breathing in sandpaper. It always does.
"My apologies, I've been told I'm not great at understanding 'personal space'," Cas says, hand slipping back to his side.
"I don't know if I have a favorite song, though Meg does often judge my deep appreciation for Lady Gaga." Dean lets out an abrupt snort of laughter, and Castiel's eyebrows draw together critically. "She's very talented, Dean."
“My garage, Meg. Not my bedroom. He’s helping me make sure the car doesn’t need any finishing touches.”
His fingers twitch in his lap, tempted to reach out and touch to see if the person next to him feels as real as he looks, just for a moment. The urge is nearly magnetic. What would it hurt if this is all an illusion?
“Oh, Cas,” She chides, sitting back in her huge leather desk chair. "No serious side effects, I’m hoping?”
When the sun has long since set and the two have parted ways, Castiel returns home, heading through his yard towards the back door in an attempt to draw less attention to himself. When he passes the long neglected tire swing, he thinks of that Saturday in June spent with Meg all those years ago.
"That, uh, that definitely answers my question. Hang on." Dean digs under the sink cabinet for a hand towel and dampens it, holding it out like a lifeline. "Here."
When the time comes for his graduating class to toss their caps into the air, it feels a little like letting go of a piece of childhood. Which, he supposes, is true. The band plays a celebratory tune, but they can hardly keep up with the volume of deafening cheers.
of him now, under the skin with no way to get out. He’s starting to feel sick with unwanted anxiety, swallowing the feeling down like a handful of pills with no water.
. The real question is, doth thou wish to join the Queen of Moons this afternoon on the battlefield? I need men."
Dean gives him a light push on his shoulder and speaks with the soothing tone of someone tending to a lost child. "Cas, buddy, I think we need to get you home. It's pretty damn late, and you can't keep your eyes open. Where's your girlfriend at?"
"What happened to your mom? She still in the picture?" Dean asks. At Castiel's solemn expression, he adds, "You don't have to tell me. Personal, I get it."
There's that weird pang again, zapping him in the middle of his chest, the same one that was there the night before when he met Dean's eyes on the dancefloor. The idea of seeing him again is undeniably tempting. He wants to get to know him. Be his friend, even. It won't matter once he's gone for college, he tells himself. He doubts Dean is the type to keep in touch. His dad never has to know...
"Whatcha lookin' at?" Meg interrupts his train of thought and follows his line of sight. She cocks an eyebrow at him and a smirk crosses her lips. "Not Mr. Jawline? Daddy said no bad boys, Cas."
He leans against a doorframe away from the main crowd to people watch. A couple is climbing onto a table across the room, the boy helping the girl up so they can dance there together. Castiel recognizes her as the one whose parent's home is currently being turned inside out by dozens of their peers. He's almost positive her name is Amanda, but he knows for sure she was on Meg's cheerleading team. (Meg joined on a dare but ended up being ironically good at it. Her squad hated her for outshining all of them. She thrived on it.)
His vision is bleary, and the look on Dean's face is unreadable, though he could swear it betrays something close to fondness. He lets himself be guided out of the car and to his best friend's front door, where she is waiting to take him under her arm.
The Whispers are here for certain this time, hanging in the air just far enough away for them to not make sense, like a static filled radio turned down low. Maybe if he closes his eyes, they'll go away. Yeah. That will make it better.
The feeling creeps up from where his palms touch hers, quickly spreading to his forearms like a barrage of pins and needles. His fingers twitch instinctively, ready to pull away, but Pam holds on tighter as her head dips lower.
But when someone is with him, speaking to him, their presence demands attention. It’s like a switch being flipped in his brain, reminding the turmoil that it can leak out from his eyes in the form of tears, his mouth in the way of sobs, or his limbs through tremors. If someone asks him if he’s okay, the switch always flips. The tears always start. And God, are they hard to stop.
Dean clutches the clothes as if they were a gift, lips twitching into a small smile for the shortest moment. “Okay.”
Castiel glances back, and, sure enough, Dean is watching from the corner of the room. He raises the bottle in his hand when their eyes meet and gives a sly smile. A jolt of something mixed between excitement and panic zings in his chest. He blames it on his altered state of consciousness. It's more likely that Dean was watching Meg and is sending some wordless congratulations to him from across the room for being the one there with her.
"I didn't know you hadn't told him." Meg whispers, hovering close at Cas's side. "I really thought..."
"Dudes! You're here!" Charlie's cheerful voice interrupts. She's the best dressed out of all of them, but she's had plenty of practice. She lowers her tone as she draws closer, raising an eyebrow at Cas in particular. "And you brought Dean?"
His father smiles, moving to switch gears into reverse as Castiel pushes away from the car. “It’s my job to worry. I’ll see you Sunday, kid.”
He does as he’s told and pauses to look at himself in her dirty bathroom mirror. He's the type of lean and tall that's not unheard of for a high school boy, with deep brunet hair that's perpetually a bit of a mess with tiny curls at the nape of his neck and a face that always seems a little too serious until he smiles. His eyes are a stark contrast to his equally dark brows and lashes, and Meg always calls them a shade of blue unlike all the other blues, but he has no idea what exactly that means. To him, they’re just blue, common among the men in his family.
manner. They met in the middle, the place where boys and their deep voices and long lashes were, and found common ground. Experiments were made and lessons were learned along the path to this conclusion—some things they chose never to mention again.
thanks for reading, angels. this fic is bound to have some small edits made as i go along, but i hope you enjoy. also, all my chapters have a hidden reference to songs i was listening to while writing them in some way, so have fun playing ispy. for chapter one, the songs are tipsy by j-kwon and drunkface by machine gun kelly.
“Where are you going, buddy?” Dean half-shouts as Cas rushes outside without acknowledging any of them.
"Yeah, the feisty little chick always in some type of leather? Meg, right?" Dean reaches for the phone and looks down at the screen. "Hang on, this is her."
While her parents were unbothered, the rest of Meg's family wasn't so accepting. It was one of the reasons they let so many people assume they were together.
Cas’s voice is trapped somewhere in his heaving chest, so he silently reaches out for a hug. Neither of them mentions how awkward the angle is. When he finally lets out his first calm breath, Dean moves to get up. His arms feel heavy with emptiness.
“Actually…” he pauses, seeming to consider what to say next. “Cas, does the offer still stand to see the pimpmobile in person?”
“There was…” He tries to collect himself, unsettled by the sudden sharpness of his internal voice. “There was ringing in my ears, The Whispers, slight panic. It wasn’t for long, thankfully. It was foolish of me, I know.”
They wave everyone goodbye, and she takes Castiel's hand before sprinting off towards her beat-up old car. Their doors are hardly closed before Meg is turning the key and blaring the radio.
It's not lost on Cas that Meg purposely throws her purse in the passenger seat as a way to get him to sit in the back with Dean, but he doesn’t say anything as he climbs in next to him.
For a long time, no one knew where their interests lied but them. It was their little secret as they fumbled through the dizzying world of teenage hormones. Then one day, Castiel slipped up in front of their friends at lunch about how cute a guy in his English class was. There was a stilted silence among the table, though he could've sworn his heartbeat was audible at that moment.
"I'm being festive. I also may have smooth talked a couple of Charlie's theater kid friends that have keys to places they shouldn't. Wait until you see Dean."
“I don’t know if I can do this,” He says as Meg joins him at his side. He’s no stranger to the symptoms of anxiety, and the frantic beat of his heart has begun without him even taking a step towards the party.
"Never would've pegged you as a fairgoer, big guy. I like the outfit. Very Prince Charming." She gives him and Cas a once over with a smirk. "Prince Charming
"Fine." He slides off the table and nods towards where Meg’s car is parked. "Let's go before I change my mind."
Charlie looks down at an imaginary watch. "Oh, in about... now. Come on, let me show you the ropes."
He splashes cold water on his face and meets his reflection in the huge brightly lit vanity mirror. There's something about looking at mirrors, especially when drunk, that can ground you in the most jarring way. Like the person you're looking at is you, but not quite.
It strikes Castiel at that moment that he’d never actually seen Dean have an actual friend. Not like what he and Meg have. Dean had flings with pretty girls, buddies he’d talk to at parties, people he sat with at lunch. But when it came down to it, everyone always seemed too busy with the
There's a gathering of people already there, split into groups based on the type of character they seem to be playing. Charlie carries herself like a warrior queen would as she approaches her group, her loyal subjects thrilled to see her. Over the next hour, there's a lot of whacking one another with fake weapons and witnessing Dean settling easily into his role as Charlie's right hand man. She goes from doubtful to giving him fist bumps and laughing as if they'd been friends for years by the end of it all.
"Wouldn't dream of it," she says, breaking Castiel from his reverie and ushering the boys out the door in front of her. They both manage to get a thank you in before the door closes behind them.
He headed towards the Briefing Room and saw a small crowd in the Break Room as he passed. He was to be paired with Deputy Chris Barker this first two weeks, but hadn’t met him yet. There were only a few people seated in the Briefing Room. He didn’t know if one of them was Deputy Barker, but he’d find out soon enough. He decided to just sit in the dead center of the room, but as he was walking towards the desk a deputy waved and walked over to him.
Castiel had woken with a start when his alarm went off. He’d forgotten there was a dog in bed with him. He opened the kitchen door for the dog and found it was still raining. The dog ran out anyway, but stayed against the house under the eaves. Castiel saw the dog squat down, do her business and quickly run back inside.
He ran his hands up and down his face and through his hair. He wheeled over to the bar and poured himself a shot of whiskey. He could figure a way to pick up all the mail, but there was no way he’d be able to get up and pull the armrest out of the air vent. He poured himself a second shot. He noticed that the ornate scrolled antique reproduction vent now looked like it had two eyes and a tongue sticking out. As he glared at the air vent, he heard a car door.
“You’re looking sharp Cassie. Good idea to use the suit you always wear because Dean likes it.” Gabriel said and smiled. He was so proud.
It was on the verge of being too dark to see well enough to safely walk down the hill, as they made their way back to the car. The trio drove along the road that followed the northern edge of the lake and turned to the south.
Dean just sat, mouth agape, staring at the doctor. What was he talking about? WHY was a doctor in his room? Wait, now that his eyes were clearing, he slowly came to the realization that this was not his bedroom at home. He looked around, confused.
“That was sooo good, Cassie! You are sooo good, you’re so much more good than everyone one else. I know I’m not that good!” Gabriel hugged him closely as he spun them around, then put him on the ground, holding the little hand like the most precious thing in all the world as they ran together to find the plane.
“Wait, here. Put it in this and tie the top closed,” Michael pulled an unused plastic Kinko’s shopping bag out of his pocket and passed it to Gabriel. “Again, just in case of a tornado and rain.”
“Man, how you going to act making that poor soul so flustered.” Benny chuckled. “I thought she was going to faint, then you give her one of your ‘looks.’ I think she forgot where she was or how to speak for a minute.” Benny shook his head, grinning down at Dean, who was doing a poor job of suppressing giggles.
Michael looked warily at his younger brother.  He stopped sorting the files and sat on the bed. He looked down at the small stack of files in his hands, then tossed those on the bed.
Ezekiel slowly removed his hand from Dean’s chest, smiling and nodding at the normal rise and fall as his breathing had returned to normal.
“Son of a—I don’t remember how I even got here.” He practically yelled, snatching his arm out of the grasp of the nurse who was straightening up the various wires and tubing around Dean. Cas nodded and spoke in a soft, soothing tone,
Michael slammed his glass on the counter so hard it shattered. He walked out of the room to get the accordion file he had stashed in the hall closet a few minutes before.
“What? No, I’m not.” Dean shook his head, pulling his shirt over his crotch. “She just smells and needs a bath. I just had a bath and don’t want to get smelly so soon. I’m just nervous. I don’t know.”
“OK. I promise, Mr. Lafitte.” Jack vowed. “Can I call you Uncle Benny, too, like Emma and Ben do?” Jack asked with a fond smile.
“Relax, he didn’t tell us what it’s about, though we’ve got our ideas. Just don’t break them before Gabriel graduates and gets the hell out of there.”
“Dean, you served this country. You made it back alive. Not everyone makes it back alive or uninjured.”
Jack and Castiel sprinted to the car.  They turned left at the corner and headed west, then took the curving road that went around towards Chase Lake, Castiel driving a bit faster than the speed limit to catch the sun for his daughter. He smiled at the thought. He would always try to catch the sun for his children. They were his everything. He marveled that the simple things made them squeal with delight, and felt immense pride at the way they recognized the beauty of the world in what much of humanity would consider the ordinary.
“Sorry, but it was a lot. Turns out the kid not only got elbowed hard in the nose, but he bit his lip at the same time.” Ben laughed again. Dean tried to keep a straight face, but was having a hard time as Ben continued to describe the scene.
“Oh, my god! Bro! I AM sorry!” He heard Gabriel gasp, holding back laughter. “I won’t keep you. By the way, I am
John slapped her. Emma held her face. She ran to her twin brother who comforted her with soft words. Dean stared John down. If looks could kill, John would be six feet in the ground.
There is homophobic and Racial slurs/Language used in this chapter. We don’t condone bigoted people in this house. Benny to the rescue. That big ole teddy bear.
That seemed to cheer the kids up. He drove to one of the local pizza places and ordered their usual.
Benny said he understood. He hadn’t planned on being Castiel’s “gay lifestyle” tutor, but he liked the doctor enough, that he’d take it, if he could get to know him, spend time with him and develop, at minimum, a close friendship with him. God knows he’d like more, but there was something in him that made him feel that the doctor was not meant to be his. So he’d take what he could get, because he felt that Castiel deserved a break in his life and to be shown what it felt like to have unconditional love and care from another human that was not a relative. He didn’t mind being a stepping stone to something more for someone as deserving as Castiel, and if that meant him eventually stepping out of the way for Dean, well, that made him all the more OK with it all. He thought of Dean’s reactions and actions when he was around Castiel. He knew Dean, and he had the sense that Dean was just sublimating and repressing his feelings about the doctor, as he did so often with his feelings, in general.
“Well, we can just eat at the mall then at Ruby Tuesday or the sports bar place, couldn’t we? That way if anyone we knew saw us, we’d have an excuse to be here.”
“I wasn’t sure if Benny and Lee helping was a good idea considering your history but I guess it’s all good now.” Sam said and smiled.
Claire and Jack had a favorite uncle. It was Gabriel. If you asked him who his favorite brother was, he would say Gabriel, but he would also ask you not to tell his other brothers.
Castiel woke early the next morning. As soon as he opened his eyes he felt the dog’s head lift from his leg. She slept by him all night again, only moving when he rolled over. He sat up and ruffled her ears.
Gabriel noticed the girls coming from around the side, backpacks in hand, but he did not see the person he wanted to see. Before he could walk in that direction on the premise to “go help his nephew,” Jack was already on his way back. The Winchester twins called to the others to follow them inside. Claire called over to her uncle to find out if he was staying, but just waved and blew a kiss when he told her they were still working. He heard Dean ask his children where their Uncle Sam was and heard the reply that he was on an important call in his car.
He put the gun down on the credenza and began to remove some of the jewelry boxes, metal boxes, files and papers, stacking them on the credenza next to the gun.
He realized that in the back of his mind the entire time since he’d picked up his guitar, he’d been thinking of a blue eyed man. He’d definitely like to have some of that rich man’s fun. He had to admit that Castiel was a beautiful man. He had a quiet intensity and a quirky formality, but it was not an affectation, from what Dean observed. He was actually reserved and somewhat awkward in his personality, as if he was constantly on the edge of feeling utterly lost in the company of others.
“Did you see that? Did you see how good? Was it good? Was I good?” The hopeful blue eyes were as bright as blue topaz. Gabriel picked him up and swung him around.
He turned his attention back to the black Charger ahead. He saw it turn towards a road leading out of town. Well, at least he knew the man might be around the school another day. Maybe Claire or Jack would make friends with his children and could get the scoop on Mr. Lion Mane. One way or another, he was going to meet that man.
It hit him like a blast furnace. He had caught the same subtle scent wafting in the light breeze from Castiel on the porch earlier. He felt his cock engorging with blood. He buried his face in Miracle’s fur and inhaled deeply. It was intoxicating. He struggled to get his right hand under the sheets and around his cock. He buried his face further into Miracle’s fur and inhaled deeply, seeing Castiel’s blue eyes in his mind.
“Okay, once again, I appreciate all of you parents for coming and your patience. I’ll take no more questions for today. If any of the parents have questions, please email them to me and I’ll address them this evening via email reply. Again, thank you all. Students may return to their classrooms and lockers to get their things, come to the office to meet back up with your parents, get signed out, sign and receive copies of suspension forms, then vacate the school premises immediately. No dawdling. We have busses coming, school is nearly at dismissal time.” With that, Principal Macleod and Assistant Principal Mosley left the auditorium and the school security officer directed the families to the exits.
“Quick, hand me the waste basket!” he commanded Gabriel. Gabriel looked under the desk and grabbed the ornate dark cherry wood waste basket. He dumped the crumpled paper trash on top of the desk and ran over to Michael who was pulling stacks of files, computer diskettes, and microfilm containers out of the safe. As soon as Gabriel held the wastebasket in front of him, Michael started dumping some of the files, diskettes, and microfilm boxes into the container and others he tossed back into the safe. He was now almost dripping with sweat.
So all he had was Gabriel to help. Well, plus his cousins. Balthazar, Samandriel, Anael were a big help too.
Michael raised his eyebrows at his mother daring her to speak again. “And just to let you know, those are copies. I have several other copies of it all, hidden in safe places, and my lawyer has copies in sealed files, so he doesn’t know the contents. And I also have all the originals. I have others as well, I just thought these would gain your attention quicker and offer me the most leverage.”
He opened his father’s video surveillance system cabinet, opened the security camera video recorder and erased the previous three day’s recordings and the same three day’s backup tapes, making sure of erasing everything leading up to his and Gabriel’s argument and fight, Anna’s arrival and the images of them stealing the files. He removed the cassette, quickly slammed his hand on the stapler on the desk, took the staple, bending it slightly, and then shoved it inside in away from moving parts, near the main recorder head, wiped the tape off and replaced the cassette. He made sure all the equipment was running again, wiped everything down again and closed the cabinet.
“If you go inside, death and despair will be the only thing you find. Turn back now and all will be forgiven.”
“Ah! My dear! See that wasn’t so difficult, was it?” He cooed with his British accent at Castiel. “Now, second question: were said pronouns chosen by you or are they the usual pronouns used by these prospective romantic interests?”
Castiel pulled into the carport and was gathering his bags of vegetables and cheese when Gabriel came out to help, all smiles. He came up and wrapped his arms around Castiel in a tight hug from behind.
Castiel groaned and kissed the back of Benny’s neck, before pulling himself away enough to allow his hand and lube packet room.
The kids had already begun tearing into the snacks Dean had laid out. Backpacks were tossed in a pile nearly blocking the door.
“Maybe there’s a reason why you keep missing one another. Maybe it would just be a disaster if you two got together. Might be wise not to tempt fate.” She watched as multiple expressions flashed across Gabriel’s face, before she poked him and let on that she was joking.
“Miracle?” Castiel smiled. “Her name is Miracle. I’d never have guessed that. I tried so many typical names, but never anything close to that.”
“I don’t think that will be necessary, B, but I’m not taking it off the table at this point.” Michael said seriously.
“Apologies. I- I will get a nurse to- to assist you and bring a fresh gown. Please Mr. Winchester, for everyone’s sake… Just. Don’t. Move.” Dean just watched wide-eyed as the doctor fled the room. Castiel pulled the door closed behind himself and looked skyward as he leaned back against the wall. Christ on a cracker! Gabriel always seemed to have a hand in Castiel’s undoing in some way.
“Magda is Emma’s new crush, I think. She won’t admit it yet, but they’ve been hanging out at lunch and their lockers for almost a month and were on the phone constantly while we were at Uncle Sam’s.” Ben squatted and pet Miracle some more. “We were going to meet Dr. Novak’s kids, because we saw them on the middle school side, but they were talking to these other kids. We thought they were friends, but when we got closer, we heard one of the girls yelling at Dr. Novak’s son. Asking him if he was some kind of freak. And the other boy, who I thought was his friend, got a little closer, trying to ask him something I couldn’t hear, but he, Dr. Novak’s kid, just started moving his arms around. I guess he was nervous or something. And then the other boy tried to grab his arm to get him to stop or something, but Dr. Novak’s kid kind of freaked a bit when the other kid grabbed him and he flung his arm out hard and spun away, but his other arm was up, too. So when he spun around, his elbow hit the other kid, like really, really hard right in the nose and blood just started gushing out. It was awesome!” Ben laughed. “Blood was every where. I never saw that much blood that fast ever.”
“You have it so much easier than I did at your age. They had to know where I was every second of every day until I turned eighteen and told them I wouldn’t be home until the next morning or afternoon. Dad started to object, but Mom just put her hand in his shoulder and shook her head. I think she could see I was reaching my limit on ‘first born’ as an excuse. Besides, that was the last time Lucifer and Raphael were here, and they wanted to spend quality time with them, before they went back to school in Switzerland. They didn’t want to deal with arguments from me.”
Gabe slowly made his way back to their table. Jules was still there talking with Michael, who looked very interested and was smiling.
Dean wanted to ask Kaia something to include her, but he didn’t want to make her uncomfortable by bringing the spotlight of attention on her. He didn’t have to worry though because Claire did it for him and Emma joined in.
He had help of course, his brothers and his sister. His parents, not so much. Castiel had four older brothers and one older sister. His cousins helped too.
Putting down the empty shot glass he rolled over to the door and quickly tried to think of how to apologize or at least thank the doctor. It was the least the man deserved for taking care of Miracle. Not every person would do what he did for a muddied, possibly stray, dog scratching at their door on a rainy night.
“Well, you have to admit they have a point.” Kaia said, “your dad might just be one of those people who likes to hunt and play and throw away. My step father does that.”
Adam and Ezekiel assisted Dean out of the chair as Benny quickly pulled it out of the way. Before Dean could finish turning around to back himself into the truck, Benny and Lee got on either side, picked Dean up, and lifted him gently into the truck.
“Here let me get some towels.” Castiel went to the nearby sink and pulled several of the folded white paper towels from the dispenser. He used the spoon he picked up off the floor to scoop as much as he could back into the smushed paper ice cream cup, tossed it in the garbage can, and turned back to help Dean, who was already trying to wipe the melting red blobs off the sheet and his gown. Castiel began wiping up the blobs further down the blanket with firm and deliberate strokes, only thinking about how Gabriel was so proud of his new ice cream dessert, specifically designed to stain the lips and skin wherever it touched. This organic gelato’s cherry sauce had excessive red-blue food dyes “added to give one's lips and flesh that blood-red come hither look.” Exasperated, Castiel scrubbed harder, positive this blanket would give that “come hither look”, to the lap of all its patients for the rest of its days.
Checking to see the onions were almost translucent, he tossed in a bit of curry powder and the potatoes. There it was again. He grabbed his phone and lowered the volume. Yes, there was definitely something scratching at his door. He looked around. He had no weapon. Did they have cougars or bear out here? He quickly pulled his pan off the fire and grabbed the fireplace poker. He peeked out the peephole, but didn’t see anything. He heard the noise by the kitchen side door. He crept over and leaned to look out the window. Nothing. Now it was back at the front door again. And at this point Castiel put the poker down, because he was positive it was no bear or mountain lion. It was definitely the sound of a dog that was sad or scared. He opened his door to see there
Castiel sighed. “Yes, and I’m doing just fine. Just trying to finish writing this book. It’s not going as… well the way I want it too. How are you Gabriel?”
“I’m going to go in and say good night to the kids, then head out. I’m really sorry I can’t stick around, but I’ve got to be in court first thing in the morning. I need to go over the case and do any last minute prep work.”
Castiel finally picked up his keys and stood to leave when he realized that Dean was having a severe panic attack. He went over to Dean and began to speak in a soothing  voice.  Dean had begun rocking himself slightly back and forth, clutching at his chest as he tried to catch his breath.
All of the couple’s went onto the dance floor to slow dance. It was almost time for Adam and Michael’s first official dance. Adam smashed cake in Michael’s face and Michael did it back. A food fight started. Of course they didn’t use all of it. Michael could easily make more.
The Old Stone Barn was the oldest barn in the county and on the adjacent farm. Dean had been eyeing the land for a few years, even before the twins were born, hoping to add that land to theirs in order to grow more Christmas trees, pumpkins and corn for the corn maze. But Lisa had fallen in love with the barn, she had a dream of making it into a wedding and special events venue. For over three years they’d tried to coax the old man to sell it, but he would not budge. Then, June day they were driving back from Dallas, where they attended a friend’s wedding, and took a side trip to take the children, who were then six years old, to Six Flags Amusement Park. As they neared their home, they came up their road from the opposite way that they usually went on a daily basis, and they saw the For Sale sign. The old man had died and his city dwelling children had no interest in the farm. They were soon proud owners of the good-sized acreage, the small farmhouse, old stone barn, several outbuildings, and a pond.
“Claire, you should not belittle what other family member’s feel is important to them.” Castiel said sternly, “Just because you do not feel as strongly as another person does about something, does not mean it doesn’t deserve equal attention and time.”
Benny nodded. “Yes Brother. Even after everything. We sure had something special but that’s in the past. All is good.”
“OK, Anna, I’m going to go read my book now. I’ve been on it for a while and I just want to finish it. We love you. We miss you. I’ll talk to you later.”
Castiel decided to spend part of his evening finishing a book he’d been working on for the last two and a half months. He’d been so busy dealing with the fallout of Betta’s show, packing, moving and settling in that he’d ended up starting it over twice. He almost didn’t want to finish it, because he felt it would bring up bad feelings stagnating in the back of his mind.
He shoved Benny’s jeans down as he finally worked the button fly completely open. Castiel slid his hands around Benny’s hips, exploring the sensations he felt inside himself as well as tangibly. The feel of silky flesh over hard muscle thrilled Castiel more than he knew it would. Grasping Benny’s buttocks, he pulled their bodies together again. They simultaneously gasped as their cocks pressed against one another.
To his nephew’s delight, he turned the car around slowly, then turned on the siren and lights when he sped up to catch up to the other two vehicles. The little convoy made good time out to the farm. Gabriel saw the truck and black Charger pull off to one side of the house near the garage. He saw the arced drive in front of the house and pulled to a stop there. He knew they couldn’t stay long, but was eager to get out and finally meet the tall attractive man.
Sam and Gabriel slowly danced together. Adam and Michael had their first dance together in separate bodies. Claire and Kaia made Castiel tear up.
“We left the doggy door unlocked, have a bowl of water for him, the security camera feed is fine and you can see it from the bed. I think you’re all set.” Lee said as he leaned over to double check the camera feed.
“D. Winchester. Yep,”  he sighed. He really hoped Mr. Winchester was feeling less hostile and sullen now that he was home.
“Yes, I really like Clark! He’s funny and very friendly. I would enjoy, very much, if he would come.” Jack’s face lit up. “Would you please ask Deputy Barker if she would allow that, Uncle Gabe?”
“I’ve tried everything I can think of to find any link between your accounts in the Chase County Bank as well as your two national chain banks and your mortgage company’s accounts on all their websites. I got nothing. My last thing I’m going to try is to do a light hack into the mortgage company’s website using this account number on the foreclosure notice and see if I can figure out a password for this account.”
“Sounds like a plan to me. We can work on homework, if they have or are allowed to have any. I can order everyone’s favorite pizza. Wait! Maybe your punishment is everyone has to eat their least favorite pizza, huh? Ha!?” Dean looked up at Castiel and winked.
Dean took a deep breath and looked at Castiel. His bright blue eyes. His messy hair. The oversized trench coat that’s too big for him. That cute adorable head tilt. That beautiful smile.
She went over what the staff and deputies had learned of the fight in their interviews from the students in the room. She asked if they had missed anything or if any of the students in the room felt they’d not been heard or had something else to add or object to in the summation. After, no one had anything more to add, she said she was going to tell them what the other group of children had said of the fight, then would allow for questions, objections and civil discussion.
“Oh, people just put the address of the post office, and put the P.O. Box as a number that, to anyone reading it, looks like an apartment number. I’ve done the same thing for my law office when I was between addresses.” Dean nodded in understanding.
“I’ll do it. That way I can tell the kids good night before I leave.” Sam volunteered. “I’m just going to head home in a little while. It’s probably for the best since I’ve got court so early.”
“We can get some kind of pain reliever when we get out. It’ll help the swelling too. I guess we can go to the sports bar. It’s a little darker than the other place.”
“I’m going to grab a clean shirt. Be careful going downstairs, check for parents first, just in case they already got home.”
“I’m so sorry that I’ve made you all feel so bad for so long. I didn’t…I never thought that my issues dealing with my…my baggage and trauma, would affect you all. I thought I was better at protecting you from it all. I’m so sorry.” He sniffled some more.
The local doctor was immediately concerned and sent them to a specialist in Wichita. The diagnosis was quick and bleak. Grade 4 Glioblastoma. Six months to a year, if lucky.
Adam made a surprised face and turned to grasp the new doctor’s hand. “Oh, thank God, you’re here. We need your help.” He vigorously shook hands with the stunned dark haired man.
“Yes, ma’am!” Clark always knew when he could get away with being impish and when he should truly show his mother love and respect she knew she was due.
Michael was not going to let his parents have the upper hand. When he turned and saw them both standing in the middle of the room, he walked past them and went around to his fathers seat behind the desk. He did not sit, but tossed the file folder on the desk.
“As you know, I said no one that has been suspended is allowed to have extra time for projects, extracurricular activities, et cetera, et cetera. However, I know that you two have been out with the flu, and though you only missed two days, I know both of you had big end of semester projects that you lost time with, not only those two days, but the weekend as well. So, I will allow you extra time the rest of the week, morning and afternoon, as well as this afternoon, which may or may not be sufficient time to make up for your missed time. I know this will be especially difficult on you, Young Benjamin, as motor vehicle projects do not always cooperate with the clock. But this is an exceptional offer, take it or leave it.
“Are we going away?” Castiel had the truest smile Gabriel had seen in years, but the baby was laughing and crying at the same time. Gabriel gently caressed his brother’s cheek and thumbed at the tears falling with the laughing relief from the glistening blue orbs.
She led him into the Break Room and pointed to the table. “Lay them out there and make yourself a cup of Joe. I’ll put the word out to pass through here on the way to the morning briefing.” She perused the two boxes after he had laid them out and removed the lids.
From across the room, they heard a clicking noise and the quiet whir of a motor.  Gabriel and Anna stood watching as Michael quickly walked from behind the desk and back to the fireplace. They saw another safe rising from the recess in the hearth. They watched open mouthed as Michael got out his wallet and pulled out an identification card. He quickly swiped it through a card reader on the lock and entered a series of numbers, before pulling the handle. As it opened, they saw his chest and shoulders relax as he let out a long breath they did not know he was holding.
Something wild settles a bit in Cas’ eyes and he nods seriously. “Th-thank you, Dean. Come with me, I drew you a bath.”
“My name is Claire,” she says decisively. She drops into what is probably the most adorable curtsy Dean has ever seen. “It’s very nice to meet you, Dean.”
Castiel stays silent, because any lie that he might offer is so entangled with what is actually the truth that it may as well be truth itself. He’s never been able to reliably lie to Dean, anyway.
“Almost done here, chief,” Benny says, wiping his hands on a rag. He’s called Dean “chief” since the moment they met. Cas is “Mr. N,” a marked improvement from the formal “Mr. Novak” Benny insisted on using until recently.
his parents, and that his brothers are on his Christmas card list and not much else (also that Cas has a Christmas card list). The struggles he had with finding the drive to get out of bed sometimes, much less find a job and keep his apartment.
As Dean is thinking about his brother’s clean getaway, Sam pulls out his own pistol, lets out a (ridiculous) battle cry, and shoots wildly at their pursuer.
Today, however, he’s not thinking about Dean’s bare, glistening chest. Instead, Castiel is thinking about the hundreds of ways their plan for tomorrow could go wrong.
Dean is not an idiot, nor is he blind. He is well aware of how pretty Castiel is, with his pale skin, slender frame, and bright blue eyes that have already shown such an array of emotion. Despite the marks on his neck, he still smells like healthy, fertile omega. He’s been pretty feisty so far, threatening Dean and keeping him in his place, but Dean’s always liked omegas with spirit.
“Cas?” He sounds incredibly young, more like the teenager Cas met than the young man (vampire) he’s become.
Until a familiar twink sat down next to him at a bar, introduced himself as Dean, and talked about a job offer with no long-term guarantees. He talked about loss, how he and his partner were familiar with it, and how they wanted to help Benny get back on his feet if he’d come to work with them (always “with,” never “for”).
Cas just hums his agreement and watches as Dean finds a rhythm. For now, Castiel is content to watch as Dean chases his pleasure. He is, as always, fascinated by the way Dean moves, the way his muscles shift beneath his skin. The urgency of his own orgasm fades as he lies in awe of Dean.
“I can host until you get back,” she says, her soft voice lilting and pretty. “It’s going to be slow, anyway.”
Castiel examines Adam closely. While Dean was shouting and punching the bartop, Adam looked genuinely frightened. Moreso than the situation called for, Cas thinks. A kind of fear that lives outside of the fear for one’s physical safety.
“Goddamn,” he says, breathy and excited and maybe a bit overwhelmed. “That was quite a speech, Cas.”
He’s no better when he gets into the office that day. He gets through a chunk of his emails and weekly reports from various departments he oversees, but his heart’s not in it. He finds himself halfway through a page without any recollection at all of what was on the first half. He daydreams about lunch, which isn’t
There are few moments in his life that Dean can look back on and definitively say, “I did the right thing.” Cutting ties with his father as soon as Sam graduated high school. Following Sam to Stanford and helping his little brother out. Taking the German Shepherd puppy from the shady dude in the Wal-Mart parking lot and refusing to pay him for the little dude.
Dean’s voice cuts through his haze like butter. He whips his head around to see Dean diving for the gun, then standing and pointing it at Zeke, his eyes wild, his chest heaving.
Cas is squinty-eyed and suspicious, but he does as bid. When Dean rounds the table to take a seat across from him, he makes sure to let his fingers gently brush along the width of Cas’ shoulders. When he does sit down, he notices that Cas’ bright blush just makes him prettier.
When his hips are finally flush with Cas’ behind and he’s sheathed to the hilt in Cas’ silky heat, Dean braces himself to stay still while Cas adjusts. He’s still fairly well-endowed, and Cas really
Dean doesn’t know what to do with another little brother. Sam’s all grown up, a lawyer who married a tough-as-nails nurse. Dean did his big brothering already. He just wants to run a damn might club with the love of his life, is that too much to ask?
Dean finally opens his eyes and meets another pair of blue eyes, although these are icier, lighter than Castiel’s. The light of the lanterns that keep the room from being plunged in darkness dance on her light blonde hair peeking over the foot of the bed and the illumination is just enough to see her eyes and her little snubbed nose. She’s young, probably only four or five years old, certainly too young for the wariness in her eyes.
Dean once again takes the lead out of the building and Cas keeps his eyes on the back of his head instead of the death around them.
Dean’s face is slack with surprise, his eyes nearly glowing with a dozen emotions Cas struggles to put a name to.
When he goes out to the bedroom, he doesn’t look at Dean at first. He goes directly to the dresser, drops the towel from around his waist, and pulls on a pair of briefs and flannel sleep pants. The silence is oppressive.
Thunderous footsteps come from the stairs, and Castiel doesn’t care if the relief he feels is obvious as he turns to see Sam stumble into the doorway. That is not a conversation he wants to have with Dean, ideally ever, but especially not right now, before he can get his wits about him.
Dean opens his mouth to reply, but his throat seizes around dryness and he goes into a coughing fit, instead. The omega sets the tray down and pours water into the cup before hurrying to sit next to Dean on the bed. Very gently he cups the back of Dean’s head and presses the cup to his lips, urging him to drink slowly. The water is cold, soothing, and Dean drinks all of it gratefully. The omega quickly pours another cup without prompting and helps Dean drink that, too.
He accepts the paperwork from Anna, sets it and his briefcase on his desk, and leads Benny down the hall to his father’s office. He’s keyed up, wondering if this is
“It’s a private matter, but I’ll tell you before we leave so you can feel more comfortable getting in the car with me.”
“Cool with it,” Gabe replies without taking his eyes off of the Vegas strip. “Honestly, I think I love this guy. What a great way to live.”
One of his contacts intercepted communication regarding Alastair’s failure to capture and subdue Dean, or to eliminate Cas. It explicitly describes the entire incident, much to Cas’ confusion, going so far as to describe what each of them was wearing. Dean brushes aside how strangely detailed the report is and just beams at Cas when Gabriel reads the part where Cas breaks down the basement door aloud. Castiel is sure he’s blushing.
As his exhaustion finally drags him into slumber, Castiel thinks that he doesn’t need Dean to say the words out loud to him. He knows how Dean feels about him, it’s written clearly in every move Dean makes, in how Dean has stayed by his side, trusted him with his most vulnerable secrets.
The real shock, Castiel supposes, is that Joshua’s head is lying a few feet away from his body. Castiel is fervently grateful that Joshua’s face is turned away so that all he can see is the back of his mentor’s head.
Dean runs a hand along his scruffy jaw. “‘s itchy,” he mumbles a little, embarrassed. In for a penny, though. “Don’t suppose you have a razor I can use?”
He wants to watch Sammy grown up, he wants to harass Bobby. He wants to be Charlie’s best man at her lesbian wedding. He wants to watch Ash take over the world.
“If you have any questions,” Castiel says, “I would, of course, be happy to answer them. Or any proposed changes! The HLSC has given me full authority to sign off on any alterations to this contract. Or any concerns you’d like to hash out.”
and uses all of it to let his mouth fall open against the wet flesh pressed against it. Coppery liquid floods his mouth, so hot it feels like it’s boiling against his tongue, but he accepts it greedily. Some instinct is telling him that he needs it.
Cas turns enough to cock an eyebrow at Dean. He’s strikingly lovely in the afternoon sunshine coming through the window, with a clean white shirt rolled up this elbows and breeches that would be distractingly snug if Dean wasn’t so worked up about his interaction with the sheriff.
Dean was under the illusion that his cheeks could get no hotter or redder, but he was clearly mistaken.
Dean’s expression is no less predatory, but it does soften a bit. “Not tonight, Cas. You just lay there, baby, let me do all the work.”
“I’ll love you no matter what,” Cas says casually, “but if I’m sacrificing half a milkshake for it, I expect to see results.”
students of Pontiac Prep, a double-whammy of academic perfection and intimidatingly well-done orthodontia. Castiel and his siblings enjoy a bit of privilege because of it, he knows. He has little shame about using that privilege to further himself.
She interrupts him by hitting a button on the intercom on her desk, and all hell promptly breaks loose.
“You are,” Cas says with a smile, “about to say something terribly noble, I think. It’s just who you are, you can’t help it. But before you do, you should know that I have precisely
No one is certain what John and Mary Winchester did to get their sons into Pontiac Prep, but it couldn’t have been wholesome. Castiel isn’t convinced that it was even as simple as bribery. He thinks it may have been something much… Darker.
Every move each one of them makes is comfortable, warm, specifically designed for the other. They’re each a whole, complete person, but they complement one another so well you’d never be able to tell. The love shining in their eyes, even when they’re not looking directly at one another, it floors her every time.
His eyes have been closed forever, now, and moving is something he distantly remembers as an option. He slumps forward, completely unable to control his descent. He’s vaguely grateful for the cold bands that keep him from falling more, falling forever in darkness.
“Fine,” Cas says, but he’s softened a little, looks a little less on edge. “Let’s go to our seats and get this over with.”
His legs are spread wide, and Dean has two lubed fingers gently rubbing against his prostate. It’s making Castiel shudder and see stars as he fights the urge to thrust, either up or down, he’s not picky.
“He was raised by his mother, who he says worked very hard to provide for him. He’s pre-med, and credits her with getting him that far.”
He wishes he could wake up next to Cas every morning (afternoon), but someone has to be there to meet the delivery guy, Garth. It’s the kind of thing that they can probably trust one of their employees with, but Cas thinks it’s unfair to expect that much of them. Especially when the truck gets there at ten in the morning and the club doesn’t open until seven at night.
