I'm too tired to write more.
“You're … are you drunk?”
Suddenly, plush lips ghost over John's mouth. He parts his lips instantly, and a wet tongue slides in. This very effectively helps to silence them both. 'Bloody genius,' John thinks, licking into the stranger's mouth. Their tongues entwine; John feels the pleasure building in his gut as the hand between his legs speeds up while an eager tongue simultaneously fucks his mouth. John can almost taste how close he is, and becomes dimly aware that he might come in his pants any second now. As if on cue, his assailant drops to his knees, swiftly opens his fly and takes him into his mouth.
“Did you prepare yourself?” John asks, his voice several octaves darker than usual.
It's surprisingly clean. Fresh sheets on the bed, a bottle of water on the bedside cabinet. There's even an ensuite bathroom with only two cockroaches quickly hiding in one dark corner as John switches on the neon light.
Confronted with John's misery, Lestrade takes a step towards him. “John, please. You know him best. Back then his world revolved around smack.” Lestrade stuffs his hands into his pockets, turns his head and looks into the distance. He finally seems to have come to a conclusion. “I was working vice at the time. Met him when he got arrested during a drugs bust at some illegal West End club. He was so… different from the other boys. His voice… you couldn’t avoid noticing that he came from some place posh. Well bred. I wondered how he ended up, well, you know… there. We got talking. I bought him a coffee. Despite being high as a kite he was still super smart and sharp, as you can imagine.” Greg smiles a little at the memory.
No chance. I'm lying awake in the middle of the night. It's too hot. Well, that, and I miss you. I wonder where you are, if you are back in England, if you still think of me... Perhaps you found someone else? Someone good and steady. I wish for you to be happy, John, you deserve it. God, I sound like a maudlin idiot. I'll shut up now. Do not forget me.
“I'm sorry.” John whispers, casting his eyes down at the floor.
“Beg me to fuck you.”
A hand rakes through Sherlock's hair, pressing him down. Usually, John isn't very demanding, but right now he seems to enjoy Sherlock gagging on his cock. Sherlock enjoys it too.
“I didn't care, John! I still don't.”
Greg's gaze lingers but he just frowns at the sudden change of topic as a shadow briefly darkens his features. Instead of pursuing the question that's obviously on the tip of his tongue, the DI leans back and starts a lengthy tale evolving around Mrs Lestrade's plans to convert the attic into some kind of studio, now that the daughter has moved out.
On the hotter days, they lie idly on the few still existing patches of lawn in Regent’s Park, beneath the last old trees that didn't succumb to the frequent air raids or were cut down to make room to 'dig for victory'. But even when staying in the shades, Sherlock still gets freckles all over the back of his nose, which he hates but John finds very attractive. He proves it by yanking Sherlock into one of the cubicles in the public toilet near the boating lake, pressing him against the tiled wall and snogging him almost senseless.
William clears his throat before he continues:
“John...” Sherlock's voice is rough and a bit slurred.
My dearest,
“Write it on Sherlock's tab.” John suggests and the woman turns towards him, still flushed but when he smiles, she simply smiles back. There's a small gap between her front teeth, which John finds rather charming.
There's no answer forthcoming as Sherlock still seems to be gone somewhere far away. But because John actually prefers his partners to be present in the bedroom he decides to bring him back. And the best way to get Sherlock's attention John can think of right now, is to start gently circling Sherlock's right nipple with the tip of his tongue once, twice. It works; Sherlock sucks in his breath, abruptly pulled out of his reverie.
“How much?” John asks matter-of-factly.
“I can feel your heartbeat,” Sherlock says, sounding amazed and almost stupefied. Sherlock holds John like this for a moment while both men just breathe together, relishing the closeness. Sherlock is stunned into silence that he can actually enjoy this. Meanwhile, John is so turned on that coming here and now is an acute possibility, his cock giving an enthusiastic twitch at this prospect. John flexes the fingers of his right hand, digging his fingernails into his palm to distract himself with pain while his other hand comes up to cover Sherlock's, interlacing their fingers.

“Oh, do you?” She arches a wispy plugged eyebrow. “I just work around the corner. Applegate, Simmons & McFarlane.”
Then, he panics. He suddenly experiences the strong urge to leave, so he gets up and, without another word, strides towards his room. He carefully closes the door behind him, then leans his forehead against it, breathing deeply.
“Did Mario know about your... devotion... towards Mr Dunbar?” Sherlock's voice drips with unusually blatant contempt.
“Spoilsport. Let a man dream.” John teases through a mouthful of Krupuk and William shudders in disgust.
“You promised me you would be wired. You weren't. If I'd been the killer...”
“I was off my face!”
“Would you care to sort through those boxes with me upstairs?” John asks for want of anything better to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
Walter called earlier and we went for a walk. He offered to show me Berlin, particular places that might interest me. He also talked shop. Said he wants me to get involved with Salon Kitty, as ‘men like us’ are impartial to the female charms on display there. Men like us – as if we were alike! I’ve heard others talk about this operation and it seems to be rather salacious. I'm really not interested in listening in on other people having intercourse. We'll see.
Tea is abandoned together with further discussions of the subject for the evening as they relocate to their bedroom.
SOE means Special Operations Executive and was a British WW2 organisation. Following to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in Nazi occupied Europe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive).
“You're welcome.”
Instead, they tread towards the park's exit, side by side but worlds apart.
John very tenderly brushes the tip of his tongue against Sherlock's lower lip, then opens his mouth and sucks lightly. He closes his eyes and tilts his head just a little bit, changing the angle. Eventually, Sherlock seems to catch on and gives in a little. His mouth relaxes under John's pressure, and suddenly John’s tongue slips past Sherlock's lips and collides with the tip of that usually so very acerbic tongue.
“So he was living here by then.” John remarks. Despite his earlier words, he can feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand on edge. A man bearing his very name had occupied these very rooms right here over sixty years ago…
“One thousand dollars.”
“At least he was spared a court case.” William sighs. He feels cold. “So he was a professor for chemistry.”
“How come you have not been conscripted? A man your age. Or are you on leave?” Somehow, though, John doubts that.
He still has no idea what Sherlock's stance is in this matter.
The preparation is cursory at best, but John knows that he'll come all over Sherlock's arse any minute if he doesn't get inside him NOW. His cock is still wet from Sherlock's mouth, precome dribbling copiously down the shaft. This will have to do.
Greg turns to face him; the DI, too, is visibly shaken. The hand he rakes through his silver hair trembles. Eventually he says: “I tried to keep an eye on him. But it’s impossible to keep track of Sherlock Holmes if he doesn’t want you to.”
John huffs a laugh and shakes his head. “Well, how about satisfying my outdated chivalrous attitude and give her a fair warning? To make it up to me for calling my parent's marriage a sham?”
“Sorry I'm late. Next round's on me,” John offers.
What helps is discovering ligature marks on said flatmates throat.
“Would you?” He rasps.
Sherlock huffs in amusement. In revenge, John steals another deep kiss.
John's incomprehension must show. “Greg, I... what the hell are you talking about?”
William’s body shakes with a raw sob.
My dearest,
“Oh, what a tender world that would be.” Mycroft smiles a thin smile. “Unfortunately, real life is much harsher. Sherlock will undoubtedly go to prison for his offence this time, perhaps for a rather long stretch. You will get implicated as well. Are you prepared for this? T face a court and inevitable public exposure and humiliation?”
35 years, Sherlock. More than half of my life I've spent with you. And now I'm tired. My back hurts, as does my shoulder. My eyesight starts to fail me. I remember your last months, how much you suffered, until it was finally over (why wouldn’t you allow me to help you, love, to deliver you from your misery? A stubborn git to the very last.) – and I’m not prepared to do the same. Besides, I'm lonely. I miss you every day. Your voice. Your touch.
When Sherlock eventually only brings up green-grey bile, he sinks to the floor, exhausted. John silently pours him another glass of water. After gulping it down, Sherlock coils in on himself on the cold hard bathroom floor and John slumps down beside him.
Shooting Sherlock a dark look over his shoulder John reluctantly turns around until he sits on his arse. Sherlock waves his hand and gestures for John to lie down on his back, then takes the pillow John is still clutching in front of his private parts and shoves it unceremoniously under John's lower back while pushing his legs up.
“That's rather blatant.” John states.
When Sherlock finally starts blinking again, John undoes the last of Sherlock's buttons. His movements are slightly restricted by their close proximity which inspires John to press his face against the exposed pale skin of Sherlock's smooth chest. He smiles as he whispers, “Like what you see?”
They lock eyes. John's skin prickles all over under Sherlock's intense stare.
I'm forgetting how your voice sounds when you gasp out my name, the sweet smell of your silky hair. You are slipping, ever so slightly. Please, stay with me.
They feel surprisingly soft. Though unrelenting. Sherlock just lies very still – is he even breathing? - and lets John's lips touch his.
“To see it for yourself? To get a feeling for the people involved? I'm sure if you were to talk to Sean, you would...”
During these past weeks of separation my mind has often wandered back to our days in Naples. Was it truly happenstance that we were both there at the same time?
“Phone Lestrade.”
During the days, they are usually dressed much more formal. Martha sometimes senses their presence on the stairs, or upstairs, one gazing out of the window, the other leaning against the fireplace. Yet they are not haunting this place, the only hints at their existence a whiff of pipe smoke or the low rasp of a violin at the small hours. They inhabit the house as an immortal entity, their undying love outlasting decades.
He's getting through his stash faster than anticipated. At this speed, he'll be in need of new supplies in four days. Sherlock hates the necessary interactions with the providers of his substances of choice. It's so … undignified, almost sleazy; even if he doesn't buy from shady individuals lurking in grimy alleyways or squalid council flats anymore, now that he can afford better. But the posh West End clubs or faceless hotel rooms are only slightly less sordid. Sherlock still feels stained when returning from his procurements.
“Nope. At least I wouldn't. He might. He's curious.”
If it wasn't for the frown on his face, the firmly closed lips, the flaring nostrils.
John is obviously and deliberately left out but he’s also too proud to send a text to Sherlock, asking if he needs some help, or at least to be told what the hell is going on.
Bored.
“Terrible weather, isn’t it?” The man asks in a voice that indicates very clearly that he’s not the slightest bit interested in nor bothered by the weather.
John visualises a writhing and struggling Sherlock as he feeds him his cock: impossible lips stretched tight, the head of John’s prick rhythmically hitting Sherlock’s soft palate; he’ll be gagging and spluttering, drooling even but John would hold him firmly in place, his hands gripping tight at the back of Sherlock’s head, entangled in sweaty curls. Oh, the sounds Sherlock would make while John fucks his mouth – needy guttural whimpers, resonating low and deep inside his body, muffled by the hard rod of flesh forced down his throat; and John could actually feel it: the expression of Sherlock’s wanton abandon, as he comes into that filthy mouth that, for once, wouldn’t be spitting vitriolic insults but instead would be effectively coughing up John's spunk, dripping down his chin.
“Why?” Sherlock breathes against John's mouth, sounding a little bit irritated.
John is sweaty all over. His cock is not fully hard but that is not to be expected at his age and after a rather spectacular orgasm merely an hour ago. Anyway, he's had enough.
“Do you think that matters?”
Later, Sherlock lies on the sofa, allegedly thinking but, truth be told, he's just taking a nap, when John asks him suddenly, nearly calling him out: “So, the case?”
But Sherlock has pushed two fingers into his own mouth, sucking hard. He imagines them to be John's, drawn from his arse and stuffed brutally down Sherlock's throat. All he can do is hump and rub in ecstasy as his orgasm crashes over him. His abdominal muscles nearly cramp while his whole body shakes violently but he doesn't avert his eyes from John's arse and cock. John's balls are drawn tight against his pubic arch. He's close.
“So it seems.”
Suddenly, his head is yanked away again. John sits up, almost knocking Sherlock off balance, literally climbing onto his lap.
It's a bit awkward at first, as both men lie in the dark, on their backs, just breathing. John can smell Sherlock's scent in the sheets and pillows and it's intoxicating. When he dares to move he turns on his side and, as Sherlock had the same impulse, they suddenly face each other.
Room 257 turns out to be at the end of a dimly lit corridor. The door’s ajar when Sherlock arrives, yet he still knocks.
----------
Sherlock frowns in slightly amused horror. “Honestly, bridge?” he asks. John only shakes his head. “Who'd thought...” The words hang between them. Sherlock still watches John but doesn't seem inclined to put more words behind his thoughts.
“I think it's fitting.” John smiles against Sherlock's temple.
They lie face to face in the darkness, uncertain and slightly intimidated, listening to each other's breathing.
“Abigail.” John fills him in.
“If?” John looks up at Sherlock from under his long blond lashes.
“Oh, dear...” He snorts, pulling the duvet up over the two of them.
Sherlock obeys without a word.
Eventually, they get up around noon, and make themselves some tea and sandwiches, consisting of brown bread and cheese. Sherlock has donned his rather flamboyant dressing gown again, while John is wrapped in a sheet.
My love,
And, oh boy, Sherlock's dark moods are epic! Seeing the usually already high-strung man in an anguished frenzy for the first time – yelling, pacing, pulling his hair until almost yanking it out with its roots – had at first truly frightened John. As a doctor, he knows about all kinds of mental degeneration and psychopathies, but it's a different thing to experience signs of these conditions in the man he loves and desires. It's unsettling in the extreme – as is Sherlock's method of treating those manic fits with morphine and cocaine. John has no idea where Sherlock obtains the drugs in these dire times, but regarding his eclectic, bohemian circle, John is sure that he could get hold of almost anything he wants.
(See the end of the chapter for
I love you. I need you. I couldn't live with being parted from you again. That miserable war already stole so much of our time. You are no use to me in prison.
Had he been wrong?

“Someone throttled you. There are actual strangulations marks on your throat and the whites of your eyes show petechiae! Don't even dare to deny it. I'm a bloody doctor, I know about these things!” John’s voice sounds clipped as he confronts his flatmate’s nonchalance. He pushes his chair back and gets up, to be more level with this pain in the ass leaning against their worktop, jauntily blowing on his tea.
This is not just 'a bit not good'.
Met Witold again. He urged me to inform my superiors. Not sure. Of course, I've heard the rumours, but in a war truth dies first. I'll have to talk to Irene again. Maybe she knows more. She's rather well connected.
This is getting odder and odder.
Sherlock throws up his hands in despair. “I liked it, John. Stop mollycoddling me. I'm an adult. I could have said no.”
“Well, everybody can be bought.”
“Not much, actually. I think there was a fight. A tattoo. A Lonsdale shirt. That's about all.” He's an accomplished liar. Little bits of truth always add credibility. He licks his lips, shrugs, then coyly looks up at John from under his lashes.
John gives him an inquisitive look.
“Yes.”

“I bet he does,” John grumbles, switching on the telly.
Sherlock shakes his head, as if such a gesture could help him blocking out his gloomy self-pity, and sighs before opening the door, steeling himself to ward off yet another round of Polish cordiality.
John feels mortified. Embarrassment doesn't even begin to cover his frame of mind. There is no hole deep enough for him to hide in.
It's a fine, if windy, autumn day; Gibson is sporting expensive dark pilot shades and a fur-lined leather jacket, his blond hair tousled by the breeze. He's all elegant casualness, while Lestrade has his hands stuffed into the pockets of his worn coat, squinting his eyes against the bright sunshine. The equally shabbily dressed DC Coventry watches Sherlock and John with open doubt.
John waits a little but when nothing happens, he knocks again, louder this time, and steps back onto the pavement to gaze up at the facade. He can see the curtain of a window on the first floor move slightly. About a minute later, the front door is opened a fraction and a pale face pears out at him, surrounded by dark curls. A sharp gaze runs him up and down before the door is opened a little wider.
Or that he doesn't eat anything except plain yoghurt and dry toast; he'd never been a keen eater anyway.
Sherlock cuts her short: "Yes, hello, Mrs. Hudson, it's me, and that's my name. I know."
“How...? Well, never mind... that was amazing.” John pants. He knows he should be a little unsettled, but he's just mesmerised. Before he can say anything more, however, his mouth is claimed again.
John is shell-shocked. He tries to breathe evenly; his leg threatens, once more, to give out. He has to close his eyes and pinch the bridge of his nose to focus as Greg continues.
I hate myself. I can't do this anymore...
“Call him yourself, you pompous prick. Why is it always me who has to deal with your bloody brother? Ok, calm down, I'll phone him.”
Next, Sherlock licks tentatively at the base of John's cock, which is rapidly stiffening. He's just using the tip of his tongue and John realises that Sherlock is tasting him. John sighs and flexes his hands, still unsure if he's allowed to touch but when Sherlock rubs his nose against his shaft, he's past caring, knitting his fingers into Sherlock's silky curls, pressing him close.
“No memorabilia?”
don't think about it! It is over.
There was black snow today. It's ash, I'm told, from the crematories. I desperately want a hot bath. Instead, I drink myself to sleep with Vodka to feel a little warmth. It's so cold, John, you can't imagine. I'm wearing all the clothes I have, one above the other, like an onion, and I'm still freezing. Everything is damp. I feel like I'll never get warm again.
“Passion. Feelings. That sort of thing.” John blushes. This is decidedly not his area, but some things have to be spelled out for Sherlock.
“If I do this will be over embarrassingly quick.” John huffs.
Sherlock slams the laptop shut.
“Those letters also allow us to draw conclusions as to his progress until the war came to an end and the Allies advanced. Here, they marched North through Italy but were stopped due to bad weather for the winter south of Rimini. Apparently, my great-uncle was stuck there. Then his SOE unit was transferred to France and advanced with the 2. British Army. Here's a letter to John from April 1945:
“Abigail.” They shake hands.
“Chemistry. Never got the hang of it but she just loves it. She's pretty smart. And it's a really good career opportunity, what with biotech and everything.”
“No! Just … no.” John wipes his face with both his hands and Sherlock, who is for a second reminded of his dream, shudders but then John asks tentatively: “What do you remember?”
Mrs. Hudson's smile changes. "Oh, yes, dear, a pretty young lass, handed in a note for John."
John actually found himself a lady friend, behind his back! It's scandalous. It's almost ... sleazy.
Later, he discovers that he must have bitten down on Sherlock's shoulder, as he encounters teeth marks on that milky, slightly freckled skin. This draws yet another spurt from Sherlock's by now sensitive cock, and he hisses in a mix of pain and pleasure. John quickly removes his hand from Sherlock's groin, smearing the gooey mess all over Sherlock's abdomen, pressing his forehead between Sherlock's shoulder blades, holding him close.
John is not sure what he's landed himself into. Blackmail is still an option. But, suddenly, he has another suspicion and feels his stomach lurch. God, has he really been so naive?
“You are not very eager, are you?”
Sherlock smiles a dark, defiant smile. “I've got relatives in high places. My family intervened. It was all hushed up but I had to leave the army nonetheless.”
“Not the truth, obviously.” Mycroft states dryly.
“Tea?” John offers a little abruptly, getting up, pressing a fleeting kiss to William’s hair.
Sherlock sighs. “You see, I had to gather evidence. So I stayed late after class, took my time while showering and then went over to Mr Rucastle's cubicle. I was just clad in a towel, loitering in the door frame. The minute he looked up at me I knew.” Sherlock makes a retching sound as there seems to be no saliva left in his mouth.
As if to prove him right Sherlock sits up in silence and looks at John, tilting his head to one side to examine him thoroughly. John feels himself crumbling and shrivelling until Sherlock asks disbelievingly: “You'd like to watch that? Seriously?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What happened to your leg?” John asks, rolling onto his stomach, into the warm spot on the mattress Sherlock just vacated.
Truth be told, if Sherlock hadn't been so utterly, frighteningly still and subdued, John would have pinned him to the mattress and shagged him blind.
I'm brown as a nut by now. And bored to death. We are holding the fort – but what for? This isn't a war, this is an outing. The only good thing is that nearly half the time of my assignment has passed.
Sherlock looks through various papers at the bottom of the box. “Ah, here, a letter from the University of London:
She finally breaks the spell, grabbing her Latte and making for the door. “Thanks a lot, John. You made my day. I promise to pay you back.” She winks at him and then she's gone. Mr. Chatterjee smirks over the counter as John leaves for his appointment in a much lighter and relaxed mood than usual.
“GO. AWAY. Or I swear I'll kick you out of my room.”
“Nothing.” John looks down at his plate but the remains of his breakfast don't offer any kind on condolence. He pushes it away, all at once slightly put off.
My love,
“He seems to have respected their legacy. And waited for the right person to take over.” John whispers into William’s hair.
“I'm not going anywhere.” Sherlock mumbles, before returning the frozen legumes to his face.
John almost misses the kitchen sink. He retches forcibly as he brings up remnants of his dinner mixed with beer. The sour smell of vomit spreads in their kitchen as John wipes his eyes and mouth with the back of his hand, trying to get his breathing under control. He hangs onto the counter for dear life, unable to look at Sherlock who is still sitting on his chair behind him.
This chapter was kindly and thoroughly beta'd by
John quickly removes his hand. That has possibly been a bit not good...
Sherlock doesn't move, doesn't answer, doesn't even look.
He can hear John panting.
“It's not as lush as your bed.”
Anyone?
“What for?” Sherlock seems genuinely puzzled but not especially perturbed.
But perhaps it's time to move on? Mycroft has hinted at a Job for MI6, something on the continent, and why not? Suddenly, Sherlock desperately wants to leave London and all it contains behind.
They are sharing Sherlock's bed in a mostly platonic way despite some ferocious snogging. They touch more often as well; small, casual touches like patting shoulders, nudging one another or placing a hand on the small of each other's back. When they sit on their sofa in the evenings, (John watching telly; Sherlock reading, typing, texting, plastering himself with nicotine patches, sipping tea and, on Tuesday, poking around in an old printer with a screw driver and soldering bolt) their shoulders or thighs are pressed together. It's rather nice, Sherlock reckons; unobtrusive but promising.
Very tenderly.
“Yes.”
“An atheist, are we?” John asks for anything better to say.
“So... “John starts, then has no idea how to continue. He wants to say something innocuous yet reassuring but doesn't dare, dreading spiking Sherlock's temper even further, or – worse - frightening him off altogether.
Should he ask again?
Sherlock turns his face and looks at John, raising one eyebrow, asking blasé: “What precautions? Taking up self defence training? Getting a Bull Terrier? Carrying pepper spray, which is illegal, by the way? All of this won't stop her pursuer. As I said, he's obsessed with her. He can't stop. The only thing she could do is vanish from his radar and hide but that would destroy her career perspectives. The easiest thing for her would be to just give in and let him have his way with her.”
“You won’t. I promise.” Sherlock would actually promise so much more if John would just ask for it, but that’s another story.
“Good night, John.”
----------
“Put your mouth on me, gorgeous. Suck me off.” John’s voice is raw with sudden need.
“What's she studying?”
God, how low had he gone?
Not only are their fingerprints taken, but they are also submitted to a humiliating examination, undertaken by a police surgeon. They have to undress and bend over so the doctor can feel them up, part their cheeks, pet their testicles. He even tries to insert one finger into John's anus, upon which John nearly punches his colleague and has to be detained by another officer, who doesn't have to be told twice to use his truncheon on that crazy faggot.
John feels pinned to the spot. He can't move. He has to watch and the intimacy of the moment is almost breathtaking. It makes his head spin. He wants to touch, he wants to taste, he wants to lick the sweat from Sherlock's temple and kiss those pink lips, wants to suck his nipples and his cock until Sherlock comes in thick shots down his throat. But he isn't allowed. John balls his hands into fists so as not to touch either himself or Sherlock and hopes that when Sherlock finally comes some of it will hit him on the chest or belly or – even better – in the vicinity of his already once again half hard cock.
“If you mention that film ever again, I swear I'll tie you down and force you to watch all seven Star Wars movies with me. Even the one's with Jar Jar Binks.” Sherlock's mouth snaps shut. “Listen, there's much more to sex than just penetration. No, don't say anything, Sherlock. This is, for once, my area, so lie back and enjoy.” And with that, John resumes plundering Sherlock's mouth before moving down his throat to suck on one of those dusty pink nipples until it's a hard, glistening nub.
He fucks Victor relentless and steady, pounding that unprepared pink hole. Yet he's sure he's not the first today to get a leg over, so that's all right.
John had the nerve to let him wait! Due to the heroin, Sherlock wasn't exceptionally hungry. On the contrary, the intense smells of roasted garlic, grilled fish and Mediterranean herbs nearly turned his empty stomach, still burning from his earlier retching. All the people around made him uneasy; he felt watched and confined. Paranoia could be a side-effect of freebasing but Sherlock had never suffered it to this extent before.
All remaining mistakes are mine.
Gibson just looks mildly amused. “Well, so money makes no difference to you?” His eyes roam Sherlock's body, clad in a bespoke suit and a shirt surely the other side of 200 quid.
“God, I missed your taste. So fucking delicious.” He sighs, lapping at Sherlock's over-sensitive nipple. Sherlock pulls his face up by his short blond hair and sucks John's tongue into his mouth, tasting himself.
_______
“I'm not a prostitute. I'm not after your money. I just want to know why you came by now. You are obviously tired, having worked a busy night-shift. Yet you took the trouble to come over. Why?” There's genuine curiosity in his tone.
Or the rejection of touch.
Late Monday afternoon, Sherlock is back on the sofa, napping. He dreams of an auditorium surrounding him and, as a thousand eyes watch him, a small voice says,
As much as I hate your brother, today I want to kiss him. He sent me a telegram in which he told me that you are alive and well. I'm so glad. I cried. I only learned now that you've been missing in action for almost eighteen months. Jesus, love... what happened to you?

“Sherlock...” But there's neither menace nor coaxing in John's voice as he steps away and fumbles around in the darkness until he finds the switch of the bedside lamp. The warm light shines on his slumped figure on the edge of the bed. John covers his face with his hands and takes a few deep breaths before looking up at Sherlock, who simply stands rooted to the spot in the middle of his own bedroom.
“Blood being thicker than water?” John offers.
The rattling of a belt buckle hitting the floor brings Sherlock back to his senses.
“What about you?”
“I might stay on their books, you know. Just in case Mr White's back in town.”
After gulping down the rest of the water on his bedside table, Sherlock gets a bit more aware of his surroundings. The room is bright, so it must be nearly noon. Despite his excessive bath last night Sherlock feels in desperate need of a shower.
Sherlock
He only comes round reluctantly but he knows he has to pull the syringe from the vein soon. He presses another antiseptic wipe over the puncture wound and bends his arm to prevent bleeding. Afterwards, he just tosses everything in the drawer of his nightstand. He’ll clean it later. With more care, he hides the plastic bag again. John finding it would be an utter waist. Finally, he blows the candle out (fucking smoke alarms, again). Only then Sherlock allows his body to slump onto his bed.
There's a short silence. Both men stare down into their half-empty glasses.
When the tub is eventually filled, he lowers himself into it with a soft sigh. To his utter surprise, Sherlock opens his dressing gown, lets it slide from his shoulders, and clambers into the tub as well.
I think it's over two years now that I last saw you.
Though he does cry a little when Sherlock reads him his journal later that night, after a second, much slower, much gentler round of lovemaking.
But fearing for his sanity and self-respect, John, for the love of god and all that is holy, won’t put this specific hypothesis to test in the foreseeable future.
We are stuck in Tirana, waiting for a boat. I'm hungry. And so tired. My feet are still bleeding. But we made it. I miss you. Sometimes I can't recall you face, John, and that frightens me. Do you still think of me, I wonder?
“Yes, you’re great. Now I’ll be next door if you need me.”
John had to reach the age of 32 to live the summer of his life. Despite bombs raining down on the capital, despite rationing, despite his work load increasing with more and more casualties… he’s never been so happy. No, happy isn’t the adequate word for how he feels – exhilarated, sanguine, vibrant; those are much better terms to describe his state.
“No!” John wails, despite his muscles slowly relaxing. After a few seconds he has to grudgingly concede. “Yes.”
“John?” Lestrade’s voice seems to come from far away. Instead of answering John just gets up and stumbles towards the door. His leg feels wobbly. No, stop that! He senses Lestrade following him but doesn't turn until they are both outside on the pavement.
“I think we have.” John replies. “I want you. Go on.”
“Do you know her? After all, you are the classical music buff.”
“Sherlock … what the hell?”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock brow furrows. As an answer, John makes an uncommitted gesture with one hand toward Sherlock's middle section. His prevailing erection is clearly visible, trapped inside the soft wool of his exquisitely cut trousers.
“It's Greg.”
“Oh god yes, please, Sherlock, let me watch you touch yourself.” John skids up the bed until he can rest his back against the headboard to give Sherlock some space.
The day dragged on and on, tedious and dull. Nothing captivated Sherlock long enough to let him relax, forget, bury himself in something worth his attention. Around mid-morning, his jealous inquisitiveness got the better of him and he fished John's clothes from last night out of the hamper, sniffing them (stale beer, neutral soap, alcohol hand rub, DKNY for women, JOHN), prying for some clues for infidelity. Infidelity?! That would imply being in a committed relationship. Nevertheless, he was glad when he discovered no tell-tale lipstick stains or residue of vaginal mucus.
“When I was... you know... earlier... what did you want?” Sherlock's hand is barely moving now; he just holds his swollen cock in his fist, pressing down at the base so as not to come right there and then. The slit leaks a clear drop of precome and Sherlock angles his hips forward to make sure the clear fluid lands on John’s thigh.
“Ok.” John realises that he's nearly naked in their freezing sitting room. Sherlock, of course, is totally unfazed, ignoring him over – Jesus Christ, are these human eyes? - whatever mess sitting on the slide he's concentrating on. “Fine. Uhm... I'm off to bed, then.”
“I don't even speak Spanish, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, what the fuck…?” Sherlock imagines John’s shocked face, words dying in his mouth as he watches Sherlock in horror, his jaw going slack as he's confronted with openly displayed addiction, witnessing Sherlock's need and dependency.
“You left me as well,” is his muffled answer.
“Let go!”
This chapter mentions some historical figures and events. There'll be footnotes at the end in case you want to know more.
“Mates' rates.” Sherlock offers with a smirk before putting his mug into the sink and sauntering off into their bedroom.
He wakes in the small hours, cold and stiff. The TV is still on, showing extremely boring footage of famous scenic railway journeys. In the dim light, John can just make out Sherlock, hunched vulturelike on his chair, knees pulled up to his chest, scrutinizing him.
To distract himself from the atrocious evidence of Sherlock's morbid pastimes, John focuses his attention on his patient: “Your t-shirt is ruined beyond rescue.”
John is suddenly not sure if this has been a good idea after all. He pouts mutely until Sherlock starts to speak again.
“And what are you about to do with... that?” Another vague wave of the hand, this time more obviously directed at Sherlock's groin.
He looks at John with dark eyes, then pulls him close, their bare chests touching. Their skin is warm and damp, already a little bit sweaty. Sherlock bows further down and presses his lips to the scar on John's shoulder. His tongue is darting out as he licks over the severed flesh and muscle, then transfers his attention to John's collar bone, tentatively dipping into the hollow above with only the tip of his tongue. After a moment, he moves over to the right shoulder, nuzzling, brushing lips and nose over taught tendons. It feels odd when Sherlock's stubble scrapes against John's neck but it is the first time that Sherlock takes his time to explore John's body so he doesn't protest.
Over the next twenty minutes, the moving of John's stuff is forgotten along with those letters as they engage in a rather sexualised wrestling match that William is only too glad to lose. They are panting into each other’s mouth as John whispers: “What was that about your pliant body, your long, white legs, your dark curls between them and your lovely, lovely cock? I have to wholeheartedly agree.”
I don't know what to tell you. I remember this time last year, when I was with you. In London. I'm so sorry... this is all just awful. I'll try to sleep now.
Sherlock is following Gibson's departure with narroed eyes. “Don't be disappointed. I'm sure it will be a rather dull affair.”
, Sherlock wants to retort but – even if John does not believe this to be true – he has a sense of common decency; pointing out to your flatmate that you know about his secret sexual proclivities might almost always be frowned upon, to say the least. So Sherlock just shrugs his bony shoulders. He's still not facing John.
“So, what brought this on?” John asks casually.
“What are you thinking about?” God, that voice, deep and dark and rumbling. It does things to John he's not ready to face yet.
“Sorry, what? Sucking my cock in our sitting room is your way of saying sorry for being an utter dick all evening?”
Needs must if the devil drives.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock wills himself to not look up from the eyepiece but stares down the lenses unseeing. He has to stop cutting, for his hands suddenly seem unsteady. He doesn't want to ruin the specimen.
John's head is spinning. “Are you sure?”
William shrugs. “Seems likely. How else did those letters end up here? Grandfather must have allowed him to live here. Even if they weren't talking to each other.”
“What?” William asks after a moment.
, John. Those people
“If you say so.” John yawns before closing his eyes and snuggling up close to his lover. “I'll buy you a dictionary if it gets you in the mood. Just no more
Sherlock grabs John's hips and almost folds him in half, spreading his cheeks. John grabs the back of his knees and holds on for dear life. First, Sherlock gives his cleft some broad swipes, getting accustomed to the area. By and by, he narrows in, until the tip of his tongue is circling John's tight, pink pucker. John sighs and relaxes. Sherlock spikes his tongue and pushes it.
Irene came by tonight. She's trying to bring me together with a member of the Polish resistance. But they are very cautious. It will take some more time to gain their trust.
“Sure that's not Superglue or Deep Relief?” John giggles nervously.
Usually, John thinks of this particular act as dirty and filthy. But looking at the man below him, at his open desire and wanton display of lust and enjoyment, he realises that there's no need to feel guilty. What they are doing here might be raw and unconventional, but it's neither unnatural nor dirty.
What had he really wanted this morning? John kissing him? Or John not kissing him?
Lestrade's face pales. He loosens his tie to ease his breathing. “You should ask him, John,” is all he says.
When Sherlock doesn’t continue John asks tentatively, “An accident?”
He receives an answer even before squeezing into the stuffed car of the Metropolitan line:
God Almighty!
He doesn't have to wait long. John shimmies down the mattress and puts a pillow beneath his hips, canting up his arse.
When John approaches him, a wild grin on his face, Sherlock pulls him over into a dark corner to ravish him. John follows willingly, excited and aroused by the danger of getting off in such a public place. He leans against a metal shutter in the gloomy twilight while Sherlock sinks gracefully onto his knees and sets to work on his fly.
“I don't mind.” John finally opens his eyes and turns slowly around. “Morning, gorgeous.” He strokes back a wayward curl from Sherlock's forehead, still smiling at his flatmate. His hand brushes the side of Sherlock’s neck, around to his nape, lingers. Sherlock holds his breath. John’s hand continues to slowly wander down along Sherlock's spine, fingertips barely brushing over protruding vertebrae. Sherlock can't help it, he shivers and his eyes flutter close as John reaches the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
John kisses Sherlock's cheek, smiling. “Just not in his shorthand of yours. Write me proper love letters when we are back home. Featuring soppy promises of eternal love combined with brimming elegies about my strong and able body.”
“Your observational skills... god, do that again,” Sherlock almost whimpers.
“Yes, Sherlock?”
But Sherlock stops him with a sweet, tender kiss to his lips. “No need to apologise. I had Walter, remember.”
Thoroughly convinced of his innocence, Sherlock keeps on reading a rather fascinating article about a burglary in Islington (it's one in a series of similar crimes and it's quite plain that the chartered maintenance contractor is involved, as all sites were served by the same company) until the paper is violently torn from his hands and Sherlock is forced to look into John's distorted, bright red face.
John grins. He kind of likes this brat.
John closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. He draws a deep breath before he feels able to look back at Sherlock. “But they were all... I mean you didn't...?”
“It would have been my word against his. Besides, afterwards... I couldn't...” Sherlock shudders again. “I just couldn't do it, John.” He averts his eyes and stares at the carpet.
Lestrade sighs. “If you really have to know, he got involved with a rather bad lot. And then he was just gone. Vanished. I made some inquiries – nothing came of it. I feared the worst. Until one evening when I’d been working late, a black car pulled up at the curb just as I left the station to walk home.” They share a knowing look. “I was driven to some warehouse. God, I nearly shit myself. Thought my last hour was up. We had a… talk. I was informed that Sherlock had left London and was presently residing in Florida. That he would be used as a drug mule to smuggle cocaine into the UK. That his flight was due to land next Tuesday morning. That I was to arrest him, then escort him straight to a house in Norwood where I would hand him over. My objection that I wasn’t even on the drugs squad was met with a dry smile. ‘You are now’ Mycroft informed me. And that was that.” Greg's face has turned ashen. John just stares at the man with a mixture of disbelief and fascination. “But of course it all went to hell. Sherlock spotted us at Heathrow and smelled a rat. As he started to run he crashed into another passenger. One of the condoms he’d swallowed ruptured and he collapsed. We got him to hospital just in time. Shortly after, Mycroft arrived and took over. Very efficient, that man. Would stop at nothing to protect his little brother.”
“You sound like my brother and I will not have that in our bedroom.” Now Sherlock behaves seriously miffed.
He's loved John for so long but never told him. He'd sworn that if he'll get another chance he'll say it.
OK, this is getting too close to home. As both outright denial and well aimed insults have failed, Sherlock eventually sees but one last resort: call on John's compassion. It's a little bit ignominious and it makes him feel sleazy but John gives him no choice. Sherlock casts his eyes down and bites his lower lip, displaying a level of vulnerability he knows John finds impossible to resist.
Sherlock has no idea what to say to that. He wants to scream
“That's a hell of a name. “John retorts and she laughs as he extends his hand. “I'm John.”
John stares at the ceiling. The beige paint is stained dark yellow from nicotine and flaking where cracks are showing.
“But not on purpose!”
Still, he listens to John's bare feet plodding into the loo, the rattle of the shower curtain as it is pulled open, the gargling of water in the pipes as John turns the taps, the low hum as the boiler comes to life; then, the rustling of fabric …
John lowers Sherlock’s legs and scrambles over to the bedside cabinet to grab the lube. His sweaty fingers are shaking as he fumbles with the cap, watching Sherlock sprawled out on the duvet, graceful and enticing, his nipples dark and peaked, the triangle of black curls between his legs a stark contrast to his translucent skin.
“I'll have a shower first.” His new acquaintance says before locking himself in the small bathroom while John sits down on the bed and switches the TV on, zapping though the channels.
He just needs a moment. He wants to stay like this and never let go. It’s bloody perfect. Until Sherlock's hand comes round to gently pet his arse.
Back in Hamburg again. The city is almost razed tot he ground. Yet somehow, life goes on.
I was relieved from my watch at the brothel. Back at Wilhelmstraße now, as Walter's personal aide. At lunchtime, I was sick in the gents. Have to find a way to communicate with Irene.
This is unbearable! This is unheard of.
“Among other things.”
Another day spent behind a peephole, watching a Bohemian diplomat mount one of the  woman. I still feel dirty, like a voyeur, even if it does nothing for me. To my embarrassment, I met her again on my way out, yet she was totally unperturbed. Her name's Irene. She seems strangly familiar, but I can't put my finger on it.
John finally seems to sense Sherlock's dire need for solitude.
“How much?”
“Ok. Fine. Great. That's settled then.” John coughs, unsure of what else there is to say. Plenty, apparently, but he feels exhausted and tired and exposed. So he retreats. “Good night, Sherlock.” That said, John turns and starts to leave, only to be called to a stop by Sherlock's voice as he's half way through the door.
Sherlock smirks and arches an eyebrow. John shrugs. Some of the pent up tension eases as Sherlock continues: “But, as I said, it was just a small trust fund. And I had developed quite expensive habits. In the end, I started to cook my own stuff. As I was studying chemistry, I had access to the equipment and to a variety of substances. At first, I only experimented. It was purely for personal use. But slowly the word spread. I started to sell, small scale, just to meet my expenses.” Sherlock's voice is more steady now as he's on firmer ground. He rests his chin on one of his knee caps and John wonders briefly what kind of conversation one must have if confessing to drug trafficking seems the easy part.
“John... what...,” Sherlock grunts, perplexed and confused. “John... watch out... what are you doing?”
“I am relaxed!” Sherlock bites out.
“I don't know.”
“As much as possible.” John growls.
Sadly, the next morning starts nothing like the last one. They are rudely woken by John's mobile at around six thirty. Sherlock's head rests low on Johns stomach (god, this could have been really promising under different circumstances) and John has to forcibly push Sherlock away then crawl over his warm, inviting body to reach for his phone. By the time he's answered the insistent ringing, they are both wide awake. It's the clinic. A stomach bug seems to have incapacitated half the staff and as there's a flu epidemic spreading. They are in urgent need of staff. Could John come in A.S.A.P.?
No. Sherlock thinks. “Of course.” Scott says, a lewd grin spreading on his face. “I’m not a charity.”
“Don't we need... something... slippery?” John's asks, suddenly experiencing nerves. He's not getting cold feet but it all of a sudden seems so... real. Face it, Watson, you're about to take it up the arse.
“I'd rather wished for you to have stayed ignorant of these aspects of my past.” Sherlock is surprised that his concern is audible in his voice. He aimed for haughty with a pinch of scorn but sounds worried and rattled instead.
“Yes, you do. At least you care for your doctor.”
“Are there? Certainly not you. All you have on tomorrow is a visit to your utterly incompetent if time consuming shrink.” Bow and violin each dangle from one of Sherlock's hands at his sides.
, a sweetheart. I said yes. She hopes that we'll be reunited soon. I hope so, too.
“Hmm.” Sherlock hums dreamily. “What do you think about French, though?
It's late. He'd thought John would have gone to bed, but apparently, he'd waited up for Sherlock, nursing a cup of tea between his hands while sitting in his armchair, doing nothing but stare into the cold grate of the fireplace. He's dressed in jeans and a maroon cardigan, looking utterly John-like and not a bit like Hamish White anymore.
Of course, he has buried all the blankets underneath his lithe but – at least in sleep – surprisingly heavy body but John can't summon up enough irritation to get cross. Instead, he is strangely affected by Sherlock's presence and very glad that his flatmate is sound asleep and therefore unable to witness John's fond grin as he climbs into bed next to the world's only consulting detective.
“That's right, Mr Holmes. Mario was even clutching the cell phone in his hand when he was found on that bridge.”
“I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.” John whispers again and again, stroking Sherlock's biceps with just his fingertips, so careful, so tender.
John blushes. But of course, Sherlock is right. Images flood his brain - of Sherlock with other men -  and he feels heat pool low in his gut despite violent jealousy roaring through his veins. He can hear his pulse hammer in his ears. John bites the inside of his cheek to calm down a fraction.
Still not better. Dreamt of home, of you. I don't dare to sleep hence I might start to blab. I think I’m hallucinating.
He tries one final approach: “But I honestly think you should inform Miss Smith of your findings. She has a right to know. Why else would you bother to find out in the first place?”
“I could think of worse things. After that, you can read my letters to you, all 835.”
“John, what…?” Oh. OH! Clever, clever John. Just, this isn’t the right time… “I can’t stay. I have to…” Sherlock gestures towards the door. There's still a murderer on the loose.
Sherlock hums, opens his throat and swallows John down to the root. The sound that escapes John’s mouth makes Sherlock grin in satisfaction, despite his mouth being stuffed full with cock. He hollows his cheeks and starts in earnest, massaging the veined underside of John’s erection with his flat tongue.
In his dream Sherlock smiles to himself and John smiles back at him, admiring Sherlock’s clever thoughts and beautifully versed poetic ruminations, even reaching out his free hand to stroke Sherlock's cheek tenderly. The touch burns and leaves an ugly dark stain, a hideously repugnant black mark and then Sherlock can feel his skin peel off his face as John flails him with clawing fingers, ripping away pale skin, yellowish subcutaneous fat tissue, pink flesh and red muscle (Zygomaticus, Orbicularis Oris, Risorios, Mentalis), exposing the white bones, until he's but a grinning skull (not unlike Billy on the mantelpiece). John smiles all the time, a sweet and slightly gawky smile, murmuring softly “Look at you! Just look at you!”
“How long do we have here?” Sherlock asks suddenly.
John fastens his robe, standing in the middle of their living room, feeling a bit discombobulated, his head still spinning from one of the best blow-jobs he's ever had. Who would have thought Sherlock could give head like that? John would have put him down for a novice at best but he'd just proven that he could perfectly well repress his gag reflex, if needed. Not for the first time, John marvels that he might have got something truly and profoundly wrong about his flatmate.
Sherlock's POV of the events of the past few days...
“How did you find me?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock is alone with his brother.
“John? Do you feel sick?” There's no answer forthcoming; only a huffing, sobbing sound escaping John's throat. It's muffled because he presses one fist against his lips.
Waking up next to this almost ethereal man amazes John every time it happens. Sherlock looks so young and innocent, vulnerable even, with his hair dishevelled and his features softened by sleep. For all his frank scorn he shows in public towards other people, with John he's gentle, open, kind and very funny. That John is allowed to see this side Sherlock usually carefully hides away makes him proud. He swears to himself to never betray Sherlock's trust.
John pulls Sherlock upright, then places one of the man's long arms around his good shoulder, while sliding his own around Sherlock's waist. He manages to half drag, half carry Sherlock to his bedroom like this, then lets him slump down on the bed.
Told Witold that my country won't help. The look on his face, John... I hate myself. So much. I let him down. England let him down. I'm so ashamed.
“What the fuck, Sherlock...” he gurgles as blood spills from his mouth.
All my love
“Don't!” Sherlock retorts, firm and a little vicious. When John faces him again he can sense barely controlled rage simmering beneath Sherlock's prim demeanour.
Again painstakingly beta'd by Lockedinjohnlock, who is now on tumblr. Hurray! Welcome to hell! Look her up at lockedinjohnlock-podfics.tumblr.com - there you'll find all her marvellous Sherlock podfics. Listen!
“In a few years, I'll be glad if I get it up once in a while.” John grins.
Again heaps of gratitude towards
John slumps down inelegantly and lands in on uncomfortably cold and rather sticky patch of bedding. He rolls on his side, squirming while trying to pull his left leg up to stretch it, but is hindered by his pants still tangled around his legs. Sherlock is quite unceremoniously shoved away and flips down onto the mattress, only to be nearly kicked in the face when John ineptly starts to wriggle out of his boxers while cursing under his breath.
John has to suppress the impulse to lock himself back in the loo as Sherlock's words sink in. “Shit, sorry, you really don't know, do you, Sherlock?”
“So, that's what I am to you? An obligation?” Sherlock yells, sounding almost piqued and suddenly John is aware of their impossible situation, for he can't tell Sherlock, can he...? Not after his previous statements on the evanescence of all human relationships.
It gives John some confidence when Sherlock arranges his limbs with deft precision, spreading his legs a little wider before lifting one foot up to rest on his left shoulder. John shivers, feeling exposed and almost folded in half. He might be too old for this kind of stuff if it calls for this kind of gymnastics.
“I don't know.” Another lie. Once started, it gets kind of addictive.
“It's for the best, Sherlock. He'll escape prison and gets to follow his calling. When he returns, he'll be a man of good standing.”
Sherlock's cock is magnificent; long and thick, his balls already tight against his body. The wiry black hair surrounding it is a stark contrast to his white skin, as is the dusky pink glans protruding from Sherlock's fist, shiny with precome as the foreskin is fully retracted.
My dearest Sherlock,
It had been carnal and very physical, an almost brutal fuck instead of the sensuous lovemaking of times gone by. Sherlock had bitten and torn at every inch of John's bare skin he'd been able to reach but had shied away when John had tried to reciprocate. They'd collapsed onto the carpet afterwards and held each other, stroking, panting until they'd fallen asleep; they'd paid the next morning with stiff limbs and aching joints.
John's mind goes completely blank. What the hell is one supposed to say to something like that? He can only stare at Sherlock, like he's never seen him before. Sherlock stares right back, unblinking.
“Mmh...” is all he gets for an answer.
I'm sipping a glass of Prosecco on a balcony in Naples. I can't believe I made it this far. The town is full of GIs, all out and about, having a good time. They are playing that song you used to hum... I don't remember what I did last New Year’s Eve. But browsing through this notebook, I see that it's my third New Year without you. This is unacceptable, John. This war has to end! I love you. I wish for nothing else than to kiss you when the clock strikes midnight. Wherever you are, be assured that I'm thinking of you with all my heart.
“Sherlock, if you have dragged us out here to just show off, I promise you...” Lestrade starts but is interrupted by Sherlock, who is suddenly beaming with delight and satisfaction. Their surroundings make John think that Sherlock takes to this part of a case like a duck to water.
“Because those things you did... they surely come back to haunt you. I don't want to trigger... something bad.” John is stammering, his face flushed red in embarrassment. “Lestrade told me how you funded you habit.” He can't go on. His voice just dies.
“So you did your penance.” John states, barely managing to keep his voice in check.
John knows that he looks out of order in this part of town in his dark jacket, white shirt and tie. But it can't be helped. The meeting took longer than expected, and he'd simply had no time to change. Despite, he loves this suit. It's bespoke, Bond Street, made of soft black wool that hugs his body most favourably – or so he'd been told by his tailor before he charged him the equivalent of his driver's monthly salary for a pair of slacks and a a coat.
Or the nightmares.
“Getting laid?” John grumbles exasperated. This is becoming a shade annoying.
He tolerated the anguish, even welcomed it. Sensation play: he’d toyed around with it in the past. It had been rewarding, at least on some occasions. Sherlock knew that pain helped him to focus, heightened his perception. He was quite aware that he needed a certain level of physical stimulus to let go.
“If you say so, Doctor,” he quips over his shoulder, sauntering off.
The week was hell. I have to compile lists of people. I don't want to do this! I tried to act clumsy, losing papers, messing up the index. But I have to be careful. They need to trust me. If they get suspicious all is lost. The things I say... I want to wash my mouth with soap every evening. I hate myself.
They both fall silent until John chuckles: “And once again, you successfully steered me away from the issue I wanted to discuss. But at least it was with an admission of fallibility on your part. That counts for something.”
He clenches his fists, tries to even his breathing, then opens the door of the fridge. There are fresh eyeballs (displaying signs of Marfan Syndrome) in the crisper. Lovely! He might just try to dissect the Zonular fibres, and see what he'll be rewarded with. Perhaps a nice Glaucoma. This delicate process would need his undivided attention and concentration, thereby taking his mind off …
William literally jumps up again and starts pacing the room, his fingers steepled under his chin. “
John shakes his head; it's a small but livid movement. Then he takes a deep breath. Sherlock steels himself for what is to come.
He'd been smoking like a chimney all afternoon and the ashtray in front of him is overflowing but Sherlock doesn't care as he stubs out another cigarette. Ash and butts spill on the coffee table, probably leaving marks but so what? There’s no-one around to admonish him and even if there were, he wouldn't listen.
“Sexlive!” Sherlock snorts sarcastically. “You mean your sad endeavours of chatting up lonely middle aged divorcees in faceless chain pubs, always leaving before breakfast, sneaking out of their too soft beds and their depressing flats at the break of dawn?”
Sherlock doesn't like this tone. He looks really hard at John. Pub, three pints, talk. A revelation. Shock. Afterwards John took the tube home. He has cried.
To John, he looks about fourteen in the dim light streaming in from the hallway.
It's been so long. I need you, so much.
“I can't leave you like this.”
John watches awkwardly as Sherlock rips the pack open and rolls the sheath on.
“No, no, John, that doesn't fit. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, the means of covering it are coolly premeditated too. I think, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.”
The reverie doesn't last long, however, for John pins him to the door the moment he has closed it, and kisses him hard, open-mouthed. There's nothing tentative there anymore, no uncertainty. John licks into him and Sherlock just follows his lead, their bodies pressed together from knees to chest. That is, until John inserts one knee between Sherlock's thighs and Sherlock starts to rut against it.
“Breathe, John.” Sherlock is still standing with his back against the bookshelf but he seems to relax a fraction as John stumbles further back until he hits the desk with his backside. His head feels dizzy and he has to clutch at the desk so as not to keel over.
John follows him.
“I like it.”
The siren call of morphine is strong during those empty hours, but Sherlock resist, knowing how much John would hate it. He sits in his old, battered chair in the living room and watches the light change, staring into nothing until his brother arrives in the evening.
“No, that was your supervisor at that... facility you are working. He was informed by the police of your arrest and thought it wise to inform me.”
Sherlock looks John dead in the face. His eyes are a deep sea-green. They are pinched but perfectly dry.
John just grins. “What happened to that Victor?”
----------
“I don't need
John smirks. “That bad, is it?”
“Go. Just go away! Leave me alone.” Sherlock turns and strides over to the window, his back to John. He's tense, his voice cold, detached, betraying no emotion.
Sherlock shrugs but doesn't pull his hands away. John is watching him intensely.
They kiss, softly at first, but then more and more insistently. John's split lip stings but he doesn't care; Sherlock can taste his blood. It's carnal... and very arousing.
I know that you didn't believe in heaven or an afterlife, but who knows? I'm about to find out. Testing a hypothesis, as you might have said, my love.
“Good.”
“Jesus... do that again!” John pants and doesn't care how needy he sounds.
Sherlock had thrusts into his fist, his hips bucking once, twice, before shooting his come all over the tiles, sobbing into the crook of his arm.
I actually may continue this...
“Yes, Sherlock?”
Sherlock sits on one of their kitchen chairs, turned around so he can brace himself, his arms folded on top of the backrest between his spread legs. He's naked down to his waist, so as not to soil another shirt. John has just pulled on his striped terry cloth robe. He hovers over Sherlock - allegedly dabbing at the stitched-up cut to his eyebrow but in fact losing himself in the oscillating shades of Sherlock's slate-coloured eyes - as a knock on their door makes him nearly jump.
“This is nice.” He murmurs, closing his eyes. A sponge comes up to gently wash his chest, circling lower and lower... The last thing John sees are Sherlock's long toes peeking through the surface of the soapy bathwater.
Das Englandspiel (The England Game) was a counter intelligence operation launched by the German intelligence agency during WW2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englandspiel.
“Not at all.”
As he turns a corner, he sees the first shapes lingering in the doorways of closed-down shops and dirty railway arches – thin, pale, clad in tight dark jeans and even tighter shirts, with chunky boots and studded belts riding low on slim hips. Most are too young for his liking – he isn't one of those punters – and he prefers his acquisitions to be at least half-way sober and not drugged into oblivion or itching with cold turkey.
John speeds up as he can feel Sherlock's whole body clench before going almost boneless. Just a few more thrusts, and he's coming as well, spilling his come between Sherlock's strong, pale legs.
There's some negotiation as to the number and type of required seating; John ends up carrying all of their kitchen chairs downstairs. He has to nudge Sherlock's shoulder to get him to evacuate his current stool, giving him a pointed stare but Sherlock has better things to do than move their furniture around. There's the lung still waiting for him in the fridge. Cutting it up on their chopping board earns him another look from John - this time rather horrified but as the good doctor seems mollified by their earlier shenanigans he just retreats to the shower before going for a prolonged walk. When he returns, he carries bags filled with spicy Thai take-away (Sherlock had lost track of time while dissecting the organ; it's actually gone dark) but insists on Sherlock first cleaning everything up before laying the table.
“I know you want me to leave. But I won't. Because you need me.” John declares, tightening his grip around Sherlock's waist, pulling him in, holding him close. It's possessive and intimate and absolutely unwanted.
I'm still at Tripoli. The hospital needs me, it's terribly understaffed. We are daily treating many casualties, though it seems that the Germans are retreating. There are rumours that Rommel left for Berlin. We'll see.
Sherlock has no idea what to say to that. He wants to scream
“We are not talking the kind you'd put in a pie?”
“I'll take care of that in the shower, if you don't mind.” Sherlock starts to shuffle back to get up.
“I'd love to have seen you as a strawberry blond.” John jokes, trying to lighten the mood, curling a dark strand of hair around his finger.
He still doesn't move.
John is brought back to the present by this question. Somehow sobered, he's all at once almost terrified of what he might have done to Sherlock.
In the 33 years of his life, Sherlock had been fed his fair share of malady. He'd encountered various rather unpleasant elements (vicious serial killers and ruthless East End bouncers among them); he'd broken into at least three high security buildings, had been at the mercy of members of Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs and officers of various divisions of the UK's police forces (only the intervention of his brother had saved him from coming into contact with the more refined machinery of the British judicial system); speaking of Mycroft, at one point Sherlock had committed a deed that could well be rated as high treason. He'd infiltrated the TTP to rescue Irene and, at a very low point, had even lived rough in South London for a few months. But never in his whole life had he been as terrified as when he'd entered John's room and asked to stay the night.
“But what's the point of this exercise if there's no penetration?” Sherlock yells frustrated. “In that video...”
At least we are alive and well. As I hope you are, too. I'll see you in about a month back in dear old blighty.
Witold brought two friends who confirmed his story. I still can't believe it. But if it's true, we have to do something. Now! This is far worse than I ever imagined.
“What is it?” John enquires tiredly. He expects some silly demand or odd question (like “Where did you put my blow-torch?” or “Why's there no turpentine left?” that is, things Sherlock would typically request at eleven thirty at night). That's probably why he's taken aback when Sherlock asks in a rather endearing (because obviously forced) casual way: “May I bunk in here with you tonight? Mrs Hudson and her friends seriously shatter my nerves.”
No new developments. No news from home.
“How about I'd agree to the mission you were talking about lately?” Sherlock offers hesitantly.
He seriously should take his own advice. But he can't.
“All I want is an honest answer, not some kind of elaborate excuse.”
And John has a lot of question. About how Sherlock copes, for example, about what else might be lurking in his past, or even in the present. He resents the potential answers (if any will be forthcoming) but has to ask anyway.
doesn't stop talking. I've already plotted fourteen ways to kill him. If he doesn't shut up, I might be forced to put into practice.
“I'm not at liberty to say, as you very well know.” Mycroft bows his head. “Of course, the Maghreb would be much preferable to South Asia or India. One hears dreadful things from those part...”
But Sherlock interrupts him, finally snapping: “Yes, it is. We all have a past. Grow up and live with it!”
William squints. “She was an opera singer, rather successful during the late forties and early fifties. I think she gave it all up when she married and moved to America. No idea why they kept this.”
Sherlock is on the brink of answering but is literally saved by the bell. “Ah, that must be our new client!” With that, he jumps up, straightens his jacket and perches languidly on the edge of the desk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” John snaps, throwing tea bags into their mugs. Two mugs. That’s a good sign.
I love you.
There's something scribbled onto it with pencil, slightly blurred spidery letters. As if written in a hurry; as if written without looking.
Having been ignored all day, John feels way too miffed to send another text enquiring after Sherlock's whereabouts. Instead, he brushes his teeth in frustration before stumbling up the stairs to his room. He doesn't switch on the light, just undresses down to his underwear and it is only as he is about to climb into bed that he sense that something is… off. As he reaches out, his hand makes contact with a soft silky mop of hair. He lets his fingers wander over the warm, lean frame curled up in his sheets and joy bubbles up in his chest because Sherlock is sleeping peacefully in his bed.
As you can see, I was so bored I invented my own shorthand to write this. Should I ever be captured and this little book falls into the wrong hands, they won't be able to decipher it, I'm pretty sure. I miss you. Fiercely. I hope you are well, wherever you might be.
“Whatever.” John coughs then pinches the bridge of his nose. “How long would you have been standing there, letting me rut against you? All the while... ?” John can't bring himself to speak it out loud. For speaking of it makes it real.
I just want to hold you, to kiss you, be happy with you, like we were back in London. That's all I want.
Again painstakingly beta'd by the wonderful
“You utter … dipshit! Where is Abigail's note? What did you do with it?”
Not everything is perfect. But it's as close as possible, and certainly the best and most intimate affair John has ever had with the most fascinating man he's ever met. As late summer slowly merges into early autumn, they settle in a trusting, stable and honest relationship.
I refuse to believe what Witold tells me. Even the Germans won't sink that low. This is barbaric.
“Where else am I supposed to put them? Seriously, John. Now get on the bed.”
They are both home now. It has taken them long enough.
John feels a little affronted. “At least it's quiet,” he bristles.
“How do you know?” John asks smugly.
“God, John, no! Do you listen to me, or are you just indulging in one of your self-destructive fits, butchering your confidence by falsely blaming yourself?”
He pushes in without mercy until buried to the hilt. Victor takes it, despite a slight show of discomfort on his face. But then, John is huge. And doesn't go slow.
“You look like a pirate.”
“Don't tell me you are clean and unarmed.” John snorts.
Gently, John turns Sherlock's face towards himself. He knows he has to do something right now, or this will end in disaster before it had even properly begun.
Apparently not, John wants to say, but he just smirks and looks away and plays with his beer mat.
When he returns to the sitting room, wrapped only in his robe, Sherlock is still on the sofa. He is now, however, perched on the edge, his back rigid, head bowed down. John just wants to go over and rake his fingers through his curls but somehow that feels inappropriate, since Sherlock has radiated pure discontent all evening.
John purses his lips but then, what is there to say: “I thought I made myself quite clear about half an hour ago. And, well, you deduced the rest of it yesterday.”
Sherlock's eyes follow John's gaze; he shrugs. “Possibly...” His voice is even lower than before. John senses that his flatmate is ...  ashamed. But Sherlock's never ashamed! The man went to Buckingham Palace in nothing but a sheet!
It's like magnetism, the way they are drawn to each other, as if by gravitational force.  Or rather, John thinks, like the moth is drawn to the flame; even risking getting burned doesn't prevent it from circling closer and closer. Because what they are doing is dangerous on many levels. It's not only the law that threatens them with draconian punishment, it's the public rejection they have to fear as well. Losing their jobs, their flats, their friends, their families are certain consequences if they are ever found out. Sherlock has already been through this once and despite his general disregard for social customs and civilities he doesn't seem too keen to repeat his experiences.
Sherlock is curled into a tight ball, arms clasped around his lower legs, his forehead resting against his knee caps. “I was packed off to boarding school when I was thirteen,” he begins, sounding restrained and detached, as if he's talking about someone else. “It was quite a venerable institution. Mycroft had graduated there the year before.” Sherlock coughs. “During my first year, one of my classmates drowned in the school swimming pool.”
“Please … mate … I'm sure we can talk about this...” John stutters, obviously shaken but not retreating.
John follows suit, burying himself inside Sherlock, pushing as far in as possible, spilling hot, thick come inside the wrecked, trembling body in front of him.
It seems that we have fought off the Germans for now. But across the border, in Libya, there's still fighting going on. James wants to march towards Tobruk, but his hands are tied as we are told to stay put and await further orders.
“That's it, Sherlock, let go. Jesus, you feel so good. You are amazing. Gorgeous. So fucking hot.”
“John... I'm sorry?”
When John announces on Thursday that he'll meet Lestrade at the DI's local in the evening, Sherlock just arches an eyebrow and gives a reaffirming nod.
Sherlock's hot breath huffs against John's skin through the thin fabric as he snorts a laugh. “It's still illegal, the way I am. You think I make a habit out of picking up strangers, giving them my name and address. To seduce them?”
But Sherlock had noticed John looking at him in that peculiar way.
“I don't care! Just shut the fuck up! I want to sleep!”
“I doubt it. But who knows?” Sherlock smiles down into his mug. He doesn't care. But watching John's embarrassment is rather rewarding. “By the way. That was a clever plan, John. How did you fake the message to the escort agency? It seemed genuine.”
this work!” He snarls, sounding rather preposterous for a naked man who just tried – and failed – to put an unsuitable object up his arse.
“But I just ate last night...”
Forgive me.
“And here you are.” Sherlock's smile is icy.
I'll try to update again by the end of June.
Next update due in May 2016. Please be patient!
?” All other noise is drowned out. There's only him and Lestrade confined in a bubble filled with dread.
Because you are dead, lying cold in your grave I can't visit without breaking down crying.
“Come in.”
“Why not?” John whispers, opening his eyes and fixing Sherlock with an unmistakable stare from hooded dark blue eyes.
John suddenly feels sick as Lestrade’s word sink in. “What do you mean by
“Did he... did you...?” John can't say it.
“You utter … dickwad! First, that's none of your business and second, I'd like to sleep anyway!”
“Nor me.” John adds.
John swallows, hesitating, stalling.
John doesn't think about his next question; he just asks it because he's curious: “What did you live on? Did you, I don't know... pickpocket tourists on Trafalgar Square? Scrounged for some change?”
“That's what they always say.”
They are both sweaty by now, panting hard. John stops clawing to Sherlock's hips and grabs his wrists instead, pinning him down onto the mattress while hovering above him. Their eyes lock. John's rhythm doesn't falter. Sherlock face splits in a manic grin.
Happy New Year, John, wherever you are. To a happier year!
“That would be lovely...” John mutters, but his host has already left the room and made for what seems to be the kitchen. John follows and catches Sherlock grinding real coffee beans in a coffee mill. The smell alone makes his mouth water and his eyes burn.
“Yes.” John agrees.
“Am I detecting a submissive streak, Captain?” Sherlock asks and it doesn't sound nearly as sassy as it is intended because the line is delivered in a somewhat raw and throaty voice.
But Sherlock seems unfazed. “I don't make it a habit of mine to judge my clients’ conduct in this specific area,” he states coolly. “But I must point out to you that there are certain laws regarding sexual harassment in this country, as there certainly are in yours.”
“Well, due to my other obligations regarding my danger prone and socially awkward flatmate, that's about all I'm able to sustain!” John is getting rather worked up. What the hell has gotten into Sherlock? He's in a real mood today. Or does it just hurt because Sherlock's razor-sharp analyses are, for once, directed at himself rather than clients or criminals? It's a very unpleasant experience to be at the centre of the focus of Sherlock's mercurial temper and uninhibited deductions.
John slowly shakes his head, then looks around the empty sitting room. After briefly contemplating going after Sherlock, he swiftly abandons this thought, because he still bears a grudge with His Nibs for being unceremoniously shown the door last night and seriously doesn't need that experience a second time in 24 hours. So he gathers his wits and forces himself to move with most of his dignity still intact, idly shuffling up into his room, where the persistent need to get the tension out of his system starts to take its toll.
When John leans against the damp shutters to get his breath back, he can sense the presence of another human being. But it’s too dark to see anything. Suddenly, a cigarette glows not five feet away. John can smell the rich, sharp scent of Turkish tobacco, a luxury these days. There seems to be a pale face behind the red glimmer, just barely illuminated, but not enough to make out any detail.
Sherlock doesn't flinch but looks Gibson straight in the eye. “Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain. And now, I would be most grateful if you could remove your hand.”
“Now you flatter yourself.”
“Of course I did. But it was a comprehensive in the eighties. Remember what the grocer's daughter did to their funding?”
But as he glances up at Sherlock, his face falls. Because Sherlock looks outright terrified. Shit! Think, Watson! Say something, or this gorgeous creature will bolt from your bed, likely never to return.
Up in his room, he tells Sherlock to walk over to his small bed. “Get in. Lie down.”
“So did I last week.”
“Sherlock, please... I promise, I won't suddenly want to... participate.”
Sherlock bites the inside of his cheek. John usually hates this name! Well, usually… usually John doesn’t hire escorts either. But this is not John, not tonight. And he’s not Sherlock, he’s Scott…
In the end, I told Mary that I was taken. She cried a little but accepted it. She thinks I'm married back home. Well, I am.
“Don't...”
“Alliances? Sherlock, this is not war. Being with someone is about love and care and respect; altruistic reasons.”
"Sherlock...?!" It's both a question and an exclamation
Gibson, instead of getting up, only leans sideways in Sherlock's chair, an angry gleam in his grey eyes and a tinge of colour creeping up his collar. John instinctively takes a step forward to position himself between their bristling client and the world's rudest consulting detective. “What exactly do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?” Gibson asks dangerously low. He reaches out and grabs Sherlock's shoulder, forcing him to turn around.
It looks like James will make it. I'm so glad! Yet he's severely wounded. I'm not sure we'll be able to save his arm.
A moment later, there's a firm knock on the door before an impressively handsome man enters, his tall, gaunt figure brimming with a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. His face is hard-set, remorseless, with a strong chin and sharp but cold grey eyes. After eyeing the two men in turn, taking in the dingy untidiness of 221b with a stern gaze, he walks over and lowers himself rather unceremoniously onto Sherlock's chair. Sherlock is forced to turn around, looking down at the new arrival. Their guest isn't the least intimidated.  John had got up as the man had entered and now instinctively moves to Sherlock's side, standing a little more upright, every inch Captain John H. Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.
“Sherlock, what...? Oh god...” John's slight discomfort evaporates in bright white bliss at the touch of Sherlock's tongue between his arse cheeks, licking one broad swipe from perineum all the way up to John's tailbone.
“Hi.” Sherlock replies, leaning against the wooden frame.
The only thing that keeps me sane is my hope to see you again.
Please, don't judge me too hard. I'm trying to hold myself to a higher standard. But I'm not a saint. Sometimes, I just want to grab a gun and shoot some German soldiers. But I guess they are just frightened boys, too, homesick, too young to know better...
Instead of showing disgust or indignation, however, Sherlock starts to chuckle as well.
Useless. He's absolutely useless at this. This might have been his only chance – and he'd screwed up again!
“That's different. It's for science.”
----------
“Honestly, what the fuck…?” John has trouble breathing again. He wants to reach out to his friend, who’s slumped down boneless opposite him. But he stops himself, unsure how Sherlock would react to the touch.
“Wait, husband? So Neil Gibson is dead?” John sits up, confused.
“Do you have condoms?” The apparent need in Sherlock's tone jerks John into action.
John sighs as if he remembers that William, despite his cutting intellect, does sometimes need things explained to him straightforward. “No. It's letters. And a diary. I think.”
“Then make me shut up.” John's smile borders on wicked.
And all the while, John simply ate his food and drank his wine and sat there until Sherlock was internally screaming. What a waste of time! This was so pedestrian, so utterly mundane! He'd prefer sticking matches under his fingernails to this dull, trivial, superfluous meet-up. John could have eaten back at Baker Street as well. What was the point in dragging him here? Was it a test? Could John not bear being alone with him anymore? Was there a hidden message in this dating business Sherlock wasn't getting?
Luckily for both John and Sherlock, Lestrade is standing in their living room as John returns from Ella (and a quick round to the shops). Sherlock is calling the DI an imbecile and a moron, in the same breath insulting the rest of his division as a bunch of mentally deficient cretins, before shrugging on his coat and storming downstairs to hail a cab. When John shouts after him, asking what all the fuss is about, Sherlock just huffs theatrically, spins around on the stairs, makes some offensive gestures with his hands, barks “Case!” and is out of the front door within the next fraction of a second.
As it's getting winter, we are retreating into the woods. We have no adequate clothing, no food, no ammunition. Some comrades eat grass and leaves. We lost nearly half the men in our brigade already. We reassure each other that they died for a noble cause. Cold comfort, I know. But what else have I left? I could murder for a decent cup of tea.
Instead of in a filthy cell, as John had expected, he finds himself in a shabby office. His back still hurts where the truncheon has hit him, but otherwise he has regained his composure. But the uncertainty of his situation starts to get to him. His head hurts, and his hands are shaking.
"How pretty?"
“Oh, fuck! Sherlock, have you any idea what they might have given you?” To Sherlock’s great relief, John sounds instantly concerned, but at the same time satisfied with the explanation he’s given. Good, that will hopefully stop him from further inquiries. But better give him some more information to reinforce the feeling of reluctant frankness.
“John?” He sounds somewhat husky.
William toys with a spring role. “We'll see.” Yet John knows that he’s a little excited as well to delve back into the past. As if to challenge this unspoken assumption, William continues: “I can see that you are imagining all sorts of adventurous entanglements, John. But reality might have been much more trivial or harsher.” Is he trying to curb John’s enthusiasm – or his own?
Thanks to everyone who commented on this or left cudos! You make me keep going!
We'll sail for Italy tomorrow. Never been there, though I recall you telling me travelling to Florence and Rome after university. So I'm getting my grand tour after all as well.
What passing-bells for those who die as cattle? I read that somewhere and never quite understood its meaning until now.
The next few days are surprisingly placid and tranquil. A few private clients call on Sherlock with comparatively mundane problems – unfaithful spouses, thieving relatives, fraudulent employees. It's easy but it keeps Sherlock... well, if not busy, at least entertained and occupied. Therefore, he's moderately good-humoured.
“Could be.” The man outright growls and a shiver runs down John’s spine. He looks up and despite the darkness is able to make out a long pale face framed by dark curls. John knows he really should say something and licks his lips, but no sound comes out of his mouth.
“You are not really successful in this line of work, are you?”
“Ha! As if that would help!” John barks, his tone curt and sharp. “Tell me, what happened.”
“Innuendo doesn't suit you, Doctor Watson.” Sherlock informs John, sounding a bit piqued.
“I got shot early on, in Belgium. I wrote it all down. Here.”
“What were the exact relations between you and Mr Dunbar?” Sherlock asks, matter-of-factly.
They stand like this for some time, two men in their forties; two bachelors (one once had been married to his work but that didn't count; the other had been married to an assassin. Mycroft had seen to it that this doesn't count in the end, either). Both their bodies are scarred. Their hair is beginning to grey; John has to wear glasses sometimes now, to read the papers or type on his blog. He'd started blogging again just a few days back when the annulment had finally come through. The first post John made was to inform his readers that he'd be moving back in with Sherlock Holmes.
“Who did this to you?” John asks, his voice surprisingly steady. Sherlock has finally stilled and sagged on his arm, one hand pressed against the door frame to support his weight.
“Well, honestly? You've been sending mixed messages on this topic lately.”
And John understands. Up there in the attic linger ghosts from their past. And they are neither ready to face them. There's nothing to be gained by reminding themselves over and over again what they've lost, missed, what has been taken away from them. They are together now, and that is all that matters.
My love,
True, Sherlock had told him he didn't do sex.
John has to press his mouth against that fluttering heartbeat. He starts mouthing down Sherlock's neck, brushing the collar aside with his nose, then sucks. He remembers the faded mark Gibson had left at the same spot as if laying a claim to Sherlock's body. 'But he's mine now,' John muses. 'Mine!'
What is our world becoming, Sherlock? How are we all to live with what we've done when this horrible war is finally over?
“Slowly.” John tells him, and Sherlock melts under his heated gaze and fierce, possessive grip. They stare at each other for a moment, and only when John seems satisfied with what he sees does he start to move again, setting a mesmerizing rhythm. Sherlock closes his eyes and tries to relax as best he can.
John knows he's standing too close but he can't drag himself out of Sherlock's vicinity. Instead, he longingly stares down on his tousled dark curls and bites his lower lip, allowing himself in this unobserved moment to indulge in the sight of Sherlock's delicate white neck, bowed down, so that John can just glimpse the fourth vertebra protruding beneath the collar of his shirt. John seriously has to fight the impulse to push his hand into Sherlock's hair and pull his face flush against his groin.
John shakes his head but he knows that Sherlock can see how affected he is. He hates himself but can't help it.
“Yes.” John is surprised how true this short statement rings. All of this feels surprisingly, utterly, absolutely, frighteningly right.
“Shlck, what the hell? Stop fidgeting!” John mumbles, his speech slightly slurred from sleep. He pulls the hand he's holding up to his chest, their entwined fingers coming to rest on John's sternum. John sighs contently as he wraps Sherlock's long arm around him like a shroud.
Carefully, John moves down the dark passage, reminding him of a black, gaping void, one hand against the row of closed market stall shutters, but there’s no one about. He’s alone, his heart beating fast, hammering against his ribcage.
John can't help but smile. “Fine. But as I said, I love you. I... want to protect you. I have the disquieting feeling that in your past you had some rather... bad experiences. I don't want to add to them. So, please, tell me if things get too much, or if you don't want to...”
“You don't know?” John repeats flatly. He'd hoped for something more decisive, an explanation, perhaps, but well, it's not a
“God! You really thought …? Now, who's pathetic, Sherlock?” John’s voice is low and cruel as he seems to work himself up into a giggling fit and Sherlock is mortified, literally too afraid to open his eyes, but he forces himself to do so, only to see John striding towards the door.
“That might be enough for a nocturnal git like you but it's not remotely enough for me! So, please, could you refrain from tormenting me with Stravinsky or whatever and JUST.BE.QUIET!” John yells the last three words to emphasise his point. Sherlock just frowns.
“You should've taken that into account. The Metropolitan line is notoriously disruptive. That's why I never rely on public transport.”
“But they were so few. So few. Do you know how many die there every day?” Sherlock sounds equally shaken.
“At least, he won't expect to get in my pants afterwards!” Such an openly salacious remark from his usually cagey flatmate (at least in this respect) would have been shocking to John a mere hour ago. As it stands now, he's past caring; cards on the table.
“Fine. Good.”
They move back to the living room where the light is better – and the atmosphere a little less charged.
But John stubbornly refuses to stop weeping. He just grabs Sherlock tighter. His body is trembling as all the pent-up hurt, anxiety and grieve pour finally out of him.
Sherlock's head slumps down on his arms, folded on the kitchen table and he winces as John switches on the lights. It's too bright and evidently hurts Sherlock's eyes, as he groans into the crook of his arms but John doesn't give a toss. He slams a glass of water hard next to Sherlock's head, the liquid sloshing over the rim.
The Armia Krajowa was the Polish Home Army (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Army).
Sherlock had wanted to taste John, his salty sweat, his milky ejaculate, had longed to lick his skin clean, sucking come from his testicles and fingers. John would have writhed and panted, perhaps even moaned Sherlock's name....
“I'm not one for cuddling.” Sherlock says the word as if it describes something rather gross and indecent. That coming from the man who just had his tongue up John's arse makes John smile.
“Stop deviating from the topic! You were crouching on the bathroom floor, retching and when I tried to touch you, you literally flinched and coiled in on yourself.” John’s nearly shouting now – not very smooth, he knows, but he can’t help it; Sherlock is such an infuriating dick sometimes, it’s unbelievable!
My love,
midnight. There are people here who have to get up in the morning!”
John returns and presses a mug into his hand. “So, do you think your great-uncle Sherlock lived here with his lover John?” He looks at William over the rim of his own mug as he takes a sip.
“Yes, Greg. I'm so beyond the point of no return right now that I don't think anything you'll tell me can make it any worse!”
As nothing else is forthcoming, Sherlock just shrugs and lowers his brow back against his knees. John can't see his face anymore and is very grateful for that because it gives both of them some much needed privacy.
I'm alright. Many others aren't. We are still at El-Alamein. We have to stop the Germans. If they advance towards Alexandria and Suez, all is lost. We have to stay put and hold out, whatever the cost. And, oh, believe me, the costs are high.
The policeman catches them a few minutes later, with John's cock in Sherlock's mouth and John's hands in Sherlock's hair. There is no mistaking of what they've both been up to, and not even Sherlock can talk them out of being arrested and getting carted off to Wood Street police station.
“I...” Sherlock croaks. “I really shouldn't...” John's right hand tightens, but he's not pushing or pulling, just keeping Sherlock in place. No demand, only an offer.
Sherlock scoots closer. He's up on his knees and only inches away. John can smell him.
John nods, gets up and starts to dress himself. “The room's paid for all night. You can take a shower if you like.” He throws a few notes down onto the bedside cabinet while Sherlock covers himself with a sheet, suddenly self-conscious.
“You still lied to me.” He says to Sherlock's back.
Sherlock can only nod. Until John presses a third finger in. Sherlock can't prevent his face from contorting in discomfort. John doesn't seem to notice.
Sherlock looks down in disgust. “God, I haven’t come in my pants since I was a teenager.” He shoves the thin cotton fabric down, then offers it to John for a clean-up. Sherlock turns on his stomach, allowing John a marvellous view of the ridge of his hips and arse.
His hands still resting on the focus knobs, Sherlock goes very still and simply asks: “John?”
John leaves the awkwardly silent bathroom when the tub is filled with enough hot water to wash away, at least, all bodily remnants of whatever it is that happened to his friend. 'He'll be fine', John thinks. 'He's always fine.' But he lingers outside the closed bathroom door, just in case...
“Quite sure, Doctor Watson.” Gibson states in a way that bears no argument.
Sherlock strongly wants to abscond, to delete this unwelcome experience, distancing himself from this new found insight into John's libidinous pursuits but somehow his fingers seem to be glued to the doorknob.
God, Sherlock, I miss you already. How am I to stay sane? How am I to survive? Well, it's just six months... I think I simply have to carry on.
“About Walter...,” Sherlock begins carefully.
“Tedious. Besides, I tried but as always, you didn't listen. Now shut up, John, if this is going to get anywhere.”
“I said a lot of very stupid things yesterday,” Sherlock concedes.
Sherlock's face is ashen when he dares to ask in a low voice: “Do you mean something like this when you say you love me?”
John sighs, heavily but dutifully gets up and dresses while Sherlock curses his 'pointless, unnecessary, galling occupation' in quite colourful language, almost whining with frustration as John runs downstairs to get at least a coffee before work. Of course, Sherlock's constant nagging makes it impossible to enjoy even this small comfort.
“Well, some say it tastes better with flavour.”
“No, just numbered. Gosh, there are over 800!” He leaves through them more thoroughly. “I'd say they are from the Second World War. Here, El-Alamain is mentioned. That's in North Africa, isn't it?
“What? I had your cock in my mouth last night. Don't get coy now.”
John stares right into Sherlock's slate grey eyes in the mirror as he speaks, his voice way more steady than he actually feels: “So, where do I sleep tonight?”
John is aware of the eyes that follow his movements from the shadows after his car has turned and left. He won't need it tonight. He'd call cab – later. As he walks down the derelict street lined with boarded-up shops, he knows that he's sticking out like a peacock among pigeons. Will surely drive up the price. But sod it – he can afford it.
“What case?”
“Yes.” Sherlock purrs, curling around him like an overlarge cat, resting his head on John's still heaving chest. “And you?”
John takes an instant dislike to the man.
“John?”
“Circle jerk behind the bicycle sheds? Or maybe the boat house, since you certainly went to some grand posh institution with one or other royalty and a future prime minister?” John has no idea if Sherlock actually attended boarding school but judging by his voice he definitely didn't go to a mediocre comprehensive. If he had, he would have been teased, mercilessly.
“All right, message received. No pictures.” John sighs.
“I said, take your hands off me!” Sherlock barks out.
“No, on my way to work actually.” John answers, hoping to shut the nosy stranger up.
They both look down John's body. The towel has ridden up on his hips and is obviously tented, but still hides most of John's cock.
All my love
“No reason at all.”
idiots...
“So did I.”
“We were both put in handcuffs and chained in some dark cellar. He blamed me, and our commander wanted to believe him. But suddenly, the rescue ships arrived. Mind, I was one of the last to get out, together with other comrades who had apparently violated regulations. Back in London, my brother pulled some strings. As both my commander and the other man involved had drowned during the evacuation, the most important witness had perished. Still, I had to leave the army.” He stares down into his lap. “It shouldn't matter, you know. I wasn't a coward or anything. I did my duty. But my father... my father accused me of lacking bravery, you know. He said to my face that if I were an honourable man I'd do the right thing and kill myself. That was the last time he spoke to me.”
They have so much time, John thinks, they'll get it sorted in the end. Never mind...
He almost bounces off his stool and flees into the sitting room, coming to rest his hot face against the icy cold glass of the window overlooking a dark and empty Baker Street.
Speaking of … Now, listening into the void of silence, John can finally hear someone come up the stairs, but the steps sound heavy and unsteady. Then the door to their flat swings open, and there  he is, a dramatic black silhouette against the light from the staircase. Sherlock Holmes, all great-coat and dishevelled curls, swaying slightly on their doorstep, positively reeking of booze and stale smoke.
Yes, accustomed. An acquired taste. Sherlock might even miss John should he suddenly be removed from his vicinity (at least after a few days, as it actually might take Sherlock a while to notice John's absence).
“It always is, with you.” John smiles a small sad smile. Sherlock coughs, then draws a deep breath.
In the end it's easy. He'd said it so many times; when he'd been lying bleeding and sore in a cellar in Serbia, or lonely in a posh hotel room in Paris, or freezing while hiding in a cave in Algeria, or dozing off on a bus in Turkey, or too sober in a cab on the ride back to Baker Street after John's wedding. It had become kind of a mantra to him, a promise that kept him alive over all those years: “No more hiding. No more lies. I love you, John.”
“Watch me,” John breathes but he needn't have worried; Sherlock is enthralled. He scoots down the bed until he's lying on his stomach, his face in the open vee of John's legs – giving him a perfect view of John's cleft and crotch. John's only able to press his index finger in up to the first knuckle but that seems enticing enough. He takes up a seductive rhythm as the fist on his cock starts to move in unison.
“Still...” Sherlock trails off.
John knows he should feel ashamed, sitting handcuffed in the back of a black police car – but he doesn't. Instead, he feels almost proud, sitting next to his the man he loves, who doesn't seem fazed by what is happening. Sherlock holds his head high and does neither whine nor plead. He looks the bobby straight in the eye and meets his open contempt with a sneer. Not the wisest move, as it turns out, for it earns him a rather brutal shove when manhandled a little too violently into the font of the vehicle. But it once again proves to John that Sherlock is not a coward.
“You just did.” Sherlock retorts in a lazy voice. His breath wafts over John's skin.
“I pay extra.” It's messy, open-mouthed, all tongues and teeth, but neither of them does particularly care.
When Sherlock mentions Warsaw, he means the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising).
He's to keyed up to sleep. But there's nothing else to do either. Mycroft will provide him with all the essentials, he doesn't need to pack anything. He'll miss this flat, though. His violin. London.
On the first floor, a door stands ajar, opening into a cluttered sitting room. John looks around in awe. There are stuffed animals residing on shelves crammed with books (in different languages); a human skeleton stands to attention in one corner. The large desk between the windows is covered in papers. The dining table is occupied with what seems to be a rather complex chemical experiment, containing test tubes, Erlenmeyer flasks and a Bunsen burner. The room smells heavily of incense while the curtains are drawn, shutting out the sunshine. His host has reclined onto a velvet settee, lying back on embroidered cushions, one arm stretched languidly above his hand, a cigarette dangling from long, white fingers.
“It absolutely does.” John agrees, staring down into the murky water sloshing in the sink. “We all have a past. Things happen to us. Imagine never anything happening to you.”
, who - despite having loads on her plate herself - kindly went through the trouble to take a look at my story.
“All right?” John asks rather unimaginatively after a minute or two, just to break the awkward silence.
“Stop this!” He sounds almost disgusted. Good! They are finally reaching some common ground.
Sherlock looks up at him from hazy silver eyes, grabbing the headboard and invitingly spreading his lean thighs.
Sherlock sulks anyway. “Well, Doctor Three Continents Watson, then tell me, how
“Again, Sherlock? I was called away from a vital meeting at the War Office. Do you have any idea...?” Mycroft interrupts himself, and now it's his turn to sigh heavily. “No, of course, you don't.”
“Oi, shut it, will you. It was fate. They were destined to be together.” John chimes, steeling a kiss. “But this John seems to have been injured? He's back in England, in some kind of hospital or nursing home?”
This has happened a few times now. These rendezvous have a dreamlike quality to them; no names exchanged, no questions asked. Easy come, easy go. That’s how things are today. When people get reminded every day that life's too short to feel guilty or ashamed, everything starts to shift. Morals are decidedly becoming lose. Men like John grab every opportunity that arises, for they could be conscripted tomorrow and shipped off to some godforsaken shithole to fight – and very likely die - for Queen and country. Who knows what might happen the next day? Carpe diem is the motto of the times. John has no problem with that. Yet, those impersonal encounters leave him somewhat empty, unfulfilled…
John tries to reach for Sherlock's cock but Sherlock is faster, sinking to his knees to undo his boots. He has to do so blindly because John grabs his short dark curls and presses his face against his groin. Sherlock can feel the already hard length beneath the abrasive wool pulsing and mouths it greedily while attempting to untie his laces, cursing the knots under his breath in colourful language.
The following silence lingers.
“I'm sorry. I... you... god, I...” His vision starts to blur.
“Here, just swallow them.”
“As much as I sometimes hate my brother, I have to say that this was actually pretty decent of him.” Sherlock mumbles against John's pectorals. His muscles have become quite defined, a fact Sherlock appreciates very much.
“You said I could hit you.” It comes out still rather shocked and a little bit sheepishly.
John takes the box from the coffee table. “Perhaps we’ll find it in here. Ah, look, a few newspaper cuttings from the late fifties and sixties. Apparently, your great-uncle became some sort of inventor. Here, he seems to have done research on forensic blood spatter analysis, among other things. Developed a method to… whatever, you’ll understand it. Look, that's him in 1961 with some inspectors from Scotland Yard.” John passes him the old article and grins. “Fascination with crime seems to run in the family. I hope he was better behaved than you are.” Sherlock is surrounded by grave looking officers in gala uniform with one of whom he’s shaking hands. He wears dark-rimmed spectacles by now, but otherwise seem unchanged.
“When he tried it on again I told him I would report him if he didn't stop. I further suggested for him to leave the school at the end of term. He wisely did.”
The reverie they've lost themselves in comes to a grinding halt one Wednesday evening in September. The days are already getting shorter and a little chilly, a relieve after the summer's heat. It's actually a bit like their first encounter in spring, only this time, John's shift is over and he meets Sherlock on his way home – or rather, to Baker Street. Sherlock has managed to slip away from whatever he's doing deep down in the market's vaults to have a cigarette between the borded-up stalls.
He's definitely not shy. Sherlock has a beautiful body, and he knows it. He revels in showing off both his mental as well as his physical advantages, and John doesn't mind at all. Sherlock usually lounges about the flat in next to nothing, dressed only in a silken dressing gown or a sheet, which gives John free access to his body anytime he wants. And oh, how much he wants.
“Are we just talking classmates here?”
“What is it? Did something happen?” John instantly feels a little bit more in charge of the situation. He dares to walk up to Sherlock and kneels down beside him. “Hey.” He says softly. “Talk to me.”
“Don't you have anything to say to that?” Sherlock asks briskly. “Something about me risking my health? Wasting my money? Don't you want to lecture me on the benefits of sobriety?”
“That wasn't exactly about me.” John grins
“What? Don't you want to know about my attitude towards sensual input?” Sherlock's voice is sharp and strained.
“Seriously? Well, how about Victor then?”
John turns back to Sherlock, brushing his palms up pale, sinewy forearms. He can feel the firm flesh and lean muscles as he strokes up and down. Sherlock is so beautiful like this, anxious and flushed, his sharp features accentuated by the diffuse lighting. He is wearing a tight shirt with the first button undone. His pulse is hammering in his throat, barely visible inside his open shirt collar.
“A bit.” Sherlock smirks.
„I can’t believe what you just said, Sherlock! Are you totally out of your mind?” John explodes.
“Relax if you want to.” Sherlock purrs, kneeling between John's spread legs. There's pressure against John's rectum and then he shudders as he feels Sherlock's finger breach his rim.
But Sherlock cannot answer. He has to swallow a few times; there's nothing to be said.
Sherlock looks at John, takes in his pink face, hooded eyes, his heaving chest, his usually fair hair now dark and spiky with sweat. Sherlock seems satisfied with the debauched abandonment he encounters because he slowly removes his fingers.
But in spite of being rather spectacularly fellated (modesty really wasn't one of Sherlock's predominant features), John seemed suddenly, somehow, bothered. Edgy. Uneasy. He wanted to talk about it.
“That was fourteen years ago. Didn't you… I don’t know, had some repairs done, or looked through the flat when you moved in, or some time after? You are the nosiest person I know.” John grins affectionately.
He lies on his back, staring up at the ceiling lit just by the street lamps outside and watches the shadows move as streaks of light stream in from passing cars and buses. He floats, detached, aloof – and then he feels nothing at all.
We are advancing!
My love,
“Do you really think
Sherlock's head is spinning, he's got trouble concentrating. John! He can't allow for John to suffer, to lose his job, his reputation. It's too important to him. He has to protect him at all costs. Oh, those stupid, stupid feelings!
“I want my brother safe. I want his exceptional talents put to good use. I want this horrid war to end sooner rather than later.”
He has to grip the back of John's chair to steady himself and John is up on his feet in an instant, offering his assistance but Sherlock just pushes him away and tries to unwind his scarf, failing miserably.
What the hell is it with him?
William just nods, still browsing through the box.
John, where are you? I need you. You are my conductor of light. What am I supposed to do?
This whole relationship thing is still new to William – and it shows.
“You slipped me your address. Do you remember? Last night, Smithfield Market...?” John feels his cheeks heat as he stammers helplessly, searching his pockets for the piece of paper to occupy his hands.
After carefully closing his bedroom door, making sure it’s locked, John leans back against it. He knows he won’t make it over to the bed, because his boner is already uncomfortably and quite insistently rubbing against the fly of his jeans and anyway, John wants to revisit the memory of hovering over Sherlock, his long pale neck bowed down, tendons strained, delicate white skin stretched over his spine, nearly translucent and oh so sensitive... The fine hair at the nape of Sherlock's neck is damp, curling, as it had been last night...
“There's a bit more to it, actually.”
“He left school a few days after and did not return. But I had found a new pastime. I had never thought about myself that way but if Victor perceived me as attractive, maybe others did as well? I took them behind the boat house and started to... explore. And let them explore me. Some were not that bad. I didn't always especially like it but I gained experience.” Sherlock tries a weak smile.
There had been a time when they'd been able to be honest with one another. But since his return, Sherlock is again hiding behind indifference and dismissiveness.
“Maybe Mrs Hudson dished out some of her herbal soothers?” John offers.
That night, Sherlock tells John what happened in Serbia – well, not everything, just as much as he can manage without breaking down again. It somehow seems easier in the dark, though of course Sherlock knows that this is ridiculous. He tells John about the flogging, the whipping, the shackles. He tells John about the cold and the thirst and the hunger and the fear; the exhaustion that nearly broke him. That he'd felt so filthy, lying almost naked in his own blood, piss and vomit on a soiled concrete floor after yet another tormentor had had a go at him, literally kicking the shit out of him. John goes very quiet before wrapping one arm around Sherlock's shoulders, pulling him in.
John has to concentrate hard and keep his eyes on the treacherous ground as not to trip and loose the towel in the process. Therefore, he only encounters what Sherlock has been up to when he stands behind him.
“You don't think it's odd?”
Sherlock just shrugs, then grabs his shirt that has been dangling from a nearby chair and starts to button it up.
As he still stands, rapt, in the doorway, Sherlock scoots over to the far side of the mattress and finally John is able to move again. He steps back into the dark room and tentatively climbs into bed next to Sherlock, cautious not to touch.
We heard from Warsaw. First, we were so excited, but now it sounds just horrible, all hope crushed. At least they tried. They rose against their oppressors. They died proud. Does this make being slaughtered any better, I wonder?
“Was there ever a more exact demonstration?” he asks, spinning around and bouncing over to the parapet where he points to a second chip of the exact size and shape as the first which has appeared under the edge of the stone balustrade.
William puts the letters down onto the sofa. “Are you sure you didn’t have a gay relative called John Watson as well?”
John starts to furiously soap his body, as if by vicious grooming he can delete all romantic (and, if he's honest with himself, more base) notions from his mind.
Just as I sat down to start my daily letter to you a telegram from your brother arrived. It just said 'Grand Hotel Vesuvio, room 221'.
John summons up all his courage and dares to ask, “Earlier, when we, you know... what happened? I mean, you invite me to your bed but you can't stand me touching you. It's a bit… confusing, at least for someone ordinary like me.”
They decide to go to one of the sleazy little hotels lining the dark side street. John pays $ 20 for the whole night and signs in as Mr Smith. The janitor doesn't so much as look away from the TV he's watching when handing him his key to room number 6.
As John comes downstairs on Saturday morning, Sherlock is already on his laptop, skimming his inbox. He's still dressed in his clothes from last night, so John knows he hasn't slept at all. John wonders if he should remark on that, if they should discuss what happened, now that some time has passed. But as Sherlock seems rather captivated, John decides to make tea and wait patiently until Sherlock will be in the mood to make him privy to his thoughts. In the meantime, he sits in his chair, sips tea and browses through the paper. Perhaps it's a bit cowardly but he didn't even have a proper breakfast yet. There's only so much a British male can take.
“Sher-Scott! Jesus, I thought you were born to suck cock, but this... holy FUCK!” John almost arches off the bed as Sherlock's tongue probes deeper. Down between his cheeks, Sherlock moans into John's arse, all modesty forgotten. The feeling of John writhing and squirming beneath him, loosing control, is overwhelming. He is doing this to John. And John loves it.
His audience, with critical and incredulous glances, watches as Sherlock firmly ties one end of the twine to the handle of the revolver. With great care he marks the exact spot where the body of Mario Gibson has been found. He then hunts among the heather and the ferns – all swirling coat and bobbing curls - while the two policemen glance at each other in disbelief and Gibson smiles rather appreciatively - until he finds a hefty stone. This, Sherlock secures to the other end of his line of string, which he then hangs over the parapet of the bridge so that it swings just above the water. Eventually, Sherlock takes his position on the fatal spot in the middle of the road, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with the revolver in his hand, the cord taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side.
“All right. John. Your revolver, please.” Sherlock holds out his hand expectantly.
“For example!” Sherlock sternly refuses being mocked by John Watson before breakfast. “Comes in quite handy sometimes.”
” He almost chokes on the last word.
Sherlock is silent on the cab ride, impatiently drumming his fingers against his knees. John makes an attempt to ease the tension by asking: “Would you care to elaborate?” He knows it's very hard for Sherlock to resist the temptation to brag.
John and Sherlock live their summer of love despite their world exploding, until reality intrudes, brutally tearing them apart.
“Mmh?”
With that, John is gone and Sherlock is, at least temporarily, released. He sits, frozen to the spot at the kitchen table for a very long time while his tea goes cold and his toast goes dry, staring into nothing, barely breathing. His thoughts tumble and slither as he contemplates how to survive this latest humiliation from a man he would, up until this morning, have trusted with his life.
Thank you for reading! I'll update every three to four weeks but you'll get rather long chapters for it. Please be patient, this just takes some time...
John brushes the knuckles of his left hand over Sherlock's quivering abdomen. “Hey, there you are. How about we slow down a bit, hm?” he murmurs.
The man who eventually enters isn't a police officer, that much is clear. Yet the bobby dozing in the corner jumps to his feet anyway before shuffling off.
Sherlock rests his head against John's chest, hugging him so tight that John has trouble breathing. Not that he minds.
John leans back against the door as he imagines Sherlock on his knees in front of him, hard cock in hand, the fully exposed glans glistening wet, begging John to be allowed to touch himself more thoroughly. But John would just shake his head and in response, Sherlock would positively growl with frustration, deep, impatient and raw. The thought of tantalisingly drawing it out, denying Sherlock his immediate satisfaction and of Sherlock obeying him until he’s about to beg for John’s cock in his mouth and his hands between his legs sends a new gush of hot blood to John’s groin. He has to push a hand down the front of his denims to take himself in hand eagerly. Despite his pants growing much too tight, he just hastily undoes three buttons. There's neither time to undress properly nor to get some lube. John’s rock hard and leaking as he finally starts to avidly stroke himself to completion. Last night he’d been too anxious and affronted to take care of the intoxicating arousal holding a vulnerable and half naked Sherlock in the bathroom had provided but now, there's no other option but to deal with this, fast, hard and desperate.
