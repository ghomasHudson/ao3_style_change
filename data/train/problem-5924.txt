Finally able to see him, she looked up and smiled at her Pop. He smiled back at her before making his way around to bed to give Tony a quick kiss in greeting. She watched him and shook her head fondly at the two. She continued watching him as he went to their closet to change, before she turned back to Tony.
“Could you get this for me Pete? I’ll pay you back when we get home.” Peter looked down at the book, The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. His furrowed brow and frown turned to a surprised smile as he looked back at his sister, laughing and taking the book from her.
“Well yeah, she’s in one of my famous baths. With rubber duckies and lots of bubbles,” Tony said in a sing-song voice.
“I don’t know,” she replied honestly. “I don’t think so but my body is still kind of numb from the seizure. I don’t feel any like, immediate pain…I guess I’m just being paranoid…” she stopped talking in favor of squeaking when she was suddenly swung up into the air. Her Pop immediately started carrying her out the door before talking.
–” she choked the last word out before hiding her head in her hands, sobbing loudly in the otherwise quiet room. He saw his husband reach a hand out in comfort before Emerson threw a hand up, stopping him. He gently lowered his hands back onto his lap and Tony could see tears glistening in his super soldier’s eyes. She took a few more breaths before continuing.
“Hey Jim, good to see you,” Steve said, attention turning to the grimacing man and handing over the sticky girl. He reluctantly took the girl, shooting both Steve and Tony a glare but greeting his niece regardless. “Babe, do you mind helping me wash this off?” the blonde asked as the genius decided to roll with it, abandoning his friend in favor of (if nothing else) the chance to rub his husband’s arms. They walked to the kitchen and Steve’s demeanor didn’t change, still happy and almost playful.
“Not the point, guys…” Steve began. “Who was smoking in the field with you?” he asked, frowning at seeing her suddenly look anywhere but at him.
“– TO WHAT STEVE? You want me to listen to you explain the reasons why you’d choose your macho save-the-world bullshit over your family, why you’d choose him over us?” Tony spit those words out like fire. He knew he would regret this, knew his insecurities were playing a part, but his heart hurt too much to stop.
He made sure to etch the drool currently pooling on his brother's chest from his baby, smiling and wondering if he should also try to catch some z's before she woke up again. But drawing always put him in such a tranquil mood, he felt at peace as he sketched the duo. One hand was protectively placed on her back as Bucky's head shifted a little in his sleep, causing the younger man to momentarily pause in his drawing.
Steve thought to himself as he went to get his two youngest kiddos. He went for Morgan first, greeting his princess with a smile before taking her to Harley’s room to change and grab his middle child. One in each arm, he took his two youngest into the kitchen to feed them some fruit and oatmeal.
“Emerson, you know that’s not what's happening. Miles actually found the letter, which was beside the trashcan - for the record. And I figured I’d offer either an ear to listen or a boxing partner to blow off some steam.” She wrapped the towel around herself and took a deep breath.
"And as for this one," the man snarled at the teen who was trying to figure out if he realized she was awake or not. "I would've preferred killing his prodigy, but the little bitch will do," he said as the men laughed along with him.
“My dear husband, I am perfectly capable of looking after myself,” he said smugly while digging into his own plate of pancakes. Steve looked up to respond but Emerson beat him to it.
He wrapped his arms around her, bear hugging his kid who didn’t return the embrace. The father further worried about his daughter.
“Yeah, Harley picked it out. After his favorite book, Peter Rabbit.” The name of his other son startled Tony as he looked to his mate.
“No, it’s just embarrassing, okay? I tripped at the cemetery and hurt my ribs by falling on a stupid tombstone,” she said, clutching her stomach a little.
"Hey now," the genius said as he opened the door to their room, "I can be mature enough to keep my hands to myself, okay? Especially if it's for the sake of my daughter," he said smugly as he tucked himself into bed while Steve remained standing and just stared at him.
“Well, for one thing you were completely distracted on the job – something I thankfully got to witness first hand…” Steve felt the shred of anger dissipate into laughter, enjoying hear Tony’s laugh join in. “Come on Steve, what was your dream job as a kid? Surely you didn’t want to be dealing with flammable drunks and horny billionaires?”
“That so?” Steve asked as he squeezed Tony’s ass again. He found himself closing his eyes in pleasure as his hips involuntarily grinded down on the man, smiling to himself as he felt the sudden hardening of his love.
She knew it wasn’t the same. She knew she wasn’t back there and no one would hold her head under. This was her Tati and a bubble bath that
“I am sorry though. For being such a bad boyfriend and not knowing what you wanted to do with your future…”
"Can we see our rooms Mr. T'Challa?" they heard Miles asked excitedly, smiling as they turned to the kid jumping up and down.
“Seriously?! Andy? Suzie Q? Come on you little demons, Steve’s got to go,” Bucky said more forcefully, tickling his sister to get her to release her hold long enough to yank her away. He did the same to Andrew, laughing along with his brother who giggled in his embrace.
“I’m…I’m really sorry Steve,” Tony said sadly, causing the blonde to stop in his tracks. He walked over to Tony’s bed and sat next to him, smiling at him as he rested his hand on Tony’s knee.
“I don’t actually know, she keeps changing her story and I can’t get a hold of Susan to get any straight answers.”
“It’s a big deal! Twenty years of being blessed as my trophy husband, why wouldn’t you want to celebrate it?”
“Oh hey Steve,” Tony said with a bright smile, putting his phone in his pocket and turning towards the blonde.
“Wow,” Clint said again, looking down at the band that he realized was missing a friend. “We gotta get you a ring too..."
“There’s my girl, where’ve you been?” he asked with one arm reached out towards her. Instead of answering, she gently bent over to hug him; burying her face in his neck. Tears she thought she was too dehydrated to produce flowed as she choked out a tiny cough.
“Me too, I told Jo you’re the only reason I’m actually friends with her,” Xavier teased. His daughter looked offended before mock-glaring at the other teen.
There was nothing like it. The thrill of flying through the air, the adrenaline rush as he soared over buildings. Almost as exciting as stopping a robbery, prying a car door open after a wreck, hell – even literally saving kitties stuck in trees. So why did his guilt always rear its ugly head? Because he had been Spiderman for three months and had kept it a secret from his family? On top of
Her inappropriate thoughts were interrupted by familiar heels clicking behind her. She turned around in time to make eye contact with one of her favorite ladies.
At that moment, the sounds of a car pulling in interrupted the two. Clint watched Bucky’s face, frowning when it shifted to panic.
“Harley isn’t his biggest fan. I think he’s not over what happened with Sunset,” Tony said quietly just as the little devil they were discussing turned towards them.
Steve stayed sitting a moment later, smiling back at the teen who had crawled back to curl up under her blanket. He helped adjust the pillows that Tony had messed up, rolling his eyes fondly at the man who had started reading the essays.
“Joey I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t genuinely want to know. I could’ve just driven past you, but I care about you. If you don’t feel like talking about it, that’s fine too. But my offer still stands, okay?” she said, waiting a moment before grabbing the remote and putting the TV on. It was muted, giving Joey the option to opt out of opening up right now.
“Do you have any questions?” Steve asked her gently. She felt her jaw lock to the side as she shook her head no, staring at her plate in front of her.
And a lot worse than almost giving your old man a heart attack," she laughed a little at that, glad to see him smile in return before addressing her again.
“And you...did you read to me?” Daci felt her cheeks blush pink before nodding in answer. It was easier to talk to the Hulk for some reason. “And...did you call me Uncle Bruce?” She could feel her cheeks turn red and glanced at him, waiting for him to not be okay with it before she saw the man smile.
, his mind supplied by the sweet scent coming from the brown eyed beauty. Curly brown hair, doe eyes and smelling of coffee and honeysuckle, Steve couldn’t help but stare.
“Let’s do it,” he said in finality, kissing his husband’s neck more vigorously as they finally walked back up the stairs to resume their vacation.
Bucky grumbled before pulling over to fill the tank, knowing it’d help his dad out anyway. Afterwards he picked up his two worthless friends and ignored their banter on the drive to the Stark mansion.
“Alright, thanks J,” Steve said as he stepped out onto his floor. He put the bag on the kitchen counter and fished out Tony’s favorites. His husband had a coffee machine in his lab and was no doubt drinking it without eating any breakfast. Steve ate an apple fritter and chugged a glass of water before plating his husband's donuts and walking towards his lab.
He could hear soft murmurs around him, recognizing his family surrounding them but eyes trained on the most beautiful creature alive.
“If you start calling me Ashley, even in jest, I will gut check you.” He recognized she was joking, his heart hurting at hearing her try and make a joke of this.
“Of course, I’ve got homework to do anyway,” he said with a hopefully normal voice as he almost tripped over himself to grab his backpack and go to his room.
“Right, um, Emerson wants to talk to you. I was just here to play naked referee.” With that, his husband smiled before he left the two, shutting the door behind him. The super soldier made his way to the bed, sitting down and leaving space for Emerson to join him. And she did, after another beat.
"He had a bad day at school, I figured you guys could tell him after he told you what happened," she said bitterly before moving over to sit next to her Dad on the couch. The billionaire wrapped his arms around her in comfort as she sat fuming. The super soldier walked over to join them, sitting in his original space between his husband and eldest, moving Miles back on his lap to look at him.
All previous confidence flew out the window, as well as his sanity, as he simply nodded in response.
“Of course not, cub. Lean your head back and I’ll rinse your hair.” She closed her eyes and enjoyed the water until her Tati was finished.
Peter even went so far as to say "apa," which they agreed didn't technically count as his first word - but was still just as precious to hear from the tiny brunette.
The blonde quickly stepped away with a laugh, throwing a mock-glare at his husband as he walked over to Joey – cheeks always pink when he was tickled.
“-but I brought my Asgardian mead!” Thor cried cheerfully before pouring a few drops of his drink into his, Steve’s and her Tati’s drinks. “To Barnes!” he said again as he raised his glass in the air. She watched everyone else copy him, smiling when Tony winked at her and picked up his water, which she copied in turn and joined the other’s cheer of ‘to Barnes!’
He looked down as his eyes bulged in disbelief. Sitting there, fangs still embedded in his skin, was the colorful radioactive arachnid. Shock and panic caused him to have a delayed swatting reaction, killing the bug he had worked so hard to create.
“Tony broke up with me and hasn’t been at school the last week. He won’t return my texts or calls and won’t even talk to Pepper! I think things have gotten worse at home but I don’t know what to do,” Steve rushed out, not able to keep his composure any longer. He was really worried about Tony and hated that he promised he wouldn’t lay a hand on Howard.
“I could make a few guesses, sir,” he said hesitantly. Fury leaned back against his chair, face unreadable as he sighed heavily.
"Publicity stunt?" her Pop asked in clarification. Her little brother nodded before continuing between crying puffs of breath.
“It’s a simple fucking question, Cara.” The teen looked dumbfounded back at her, but Jo kept her face devoid of emotion, long since over this bitch. "After everything you've done to me...I think I deserve at least that much."
“This isn’t your fault, Buck. She was manipulating you,” Steve added. And he could’ve said more, but Bucky heard a ringing in his ears as the memory of what he said to both Daci and Clint came to the forefront of his mind.
“Noooooo,” the boy cried, clutching tighter to his father. Steve noticed Tony smile and shake his head fondly.
“No. That would never happen,” Tony said assuredly and confidently. “Our concern would be if Emerson wanted to hang out with her, get to know her.”
“What’s wrong with her?” Tony asked gently as he moved to sit next to the teen. She had stopped shaking and closed her eyes in exhaustion, chest heaving up and down.
…where both children had their pants pulled down while Bucky was simply looking frantically between the kids and Steve, mouth gaping open and closed in shock.
“I did her a favor because neither of us deserved you as a mother.” She paused to take another breath, secretly enjoying the truly hurt look on the older woman’s face. She meant every word, this woman never should have been able to give birth to children and keep them.
“Fine by me,” Daci said, feeling her competitiveness come out as she turned to Peter. “Count us down Pete.”
“Yeah...so...maybe you should just leave then,” Clint growled out, shrugging his shoulders as if the words meant nothing. As if it didn’t break Bucky’s heart to hear his boyfriend dismiss him so easily.
“I’ll tell you about it after lunch. You’ve bragged about those sandwiches before and I intend to taste them for myself,” Steve said with a big dopey grin, grabbing the Omega’s hand and leading the two down the hall.
Steve sat in the living room, glaring at the girl in question who was screaming bloody murder because she
“Yes I pinky promise, Petey,” Steve said as he wrapped his pinky (which was bigger than the five year old’s middle finger) around the boy’s pinky finger in promise – adding a kiss on his tiny hand for good measure.
Something’s been bothering him, even as great as his life was now with his mom awake and as much better as he heard Clint was doing...he still felt guilty about not being there for his best friend. Bucky had been struggling a lot these few months and Steve hadn't so much asked him how he'd been doing.
“Come back to me in one piece,” Tony growled at his husband before Steve nodded back at him with a smile before following the others.
Ulysses Klaue was a weapons dealer who primarily got his weapons from stealing and killing. Her Dad had told her about him, how they had known each other long ago and even worked together - before her Dad realized what Stark Industries was doing and vowed to stop it.
They sat like that for forty minutes before Peter’s cries began to finally die down.  After realizing Peter had cried himself to unconsciousness, the three began to slowly extract themselves. Steve bent down to pick Peter up, tucking him into his bed with the same gentleness as when he was five. He stood to find Tony and Emerson in a half-hug, the pair looking sadly at the tortured teen.
He and his girlfriend lived near them and one day she went to their apartment to wait for her Dad to get off work.
" to him. He made eye contact with her as they smiled in realization, turning back to the people giggling about something.
“Daci? You alright?” Steve asked her, pushing the stroller to stand next to her. She was staring at the big animals to their right, behind a glass cage and using their long necks to eat from the tree tops.
“It’s better than seeing him so upset,” Steve said with a shrug before he shoved his brother playfully.
A loud, thundering voice echoed throughout the halls, startling her a little as both she and her father froze in their tracks.
At this point, Tony couldn’t help himself, Steve was so goddamn cute and confused and it always made the butterflies in his stomach flutter – even after over 20 years together, thank you very much – he grabbed his face in both hands and slowly kissed the sexy blonde.
She could still hear her dads' crying though, breaking away from her love to comfort the grown adult men.
Since the incident with his biological father, Leo’s been hot and cold with Peter. And if he really thought about it, mostly cold.
Until something pulled him out of his deep slumber, some kind of nagging sense of longing from the bond.
“Yeah that...that makes sense. Thank you, T’Challa,” she said sincerely but unable to look him in the eye. He reminded her too much of Shuri and everything just piled on top of each other. Fuck she really misses her wife. “I’m going to go eat something, you want anything?” she asked as she got up off the couch, still not looking him in the eye.
“I have his number from Tony’s old phone,” he said, disappointment in his features instead of the congratulatory one. “But I can’t make a call to England...” Steve continued sadly.
“We’re in the living room!” he shouted to the pair, staying seated as the boy crawled onto Tony’s lap. Steve walked in first with Joey following close behind, the teen looking around the mansion in awe. The blonde walked over and smiled at the pair, moving to sit near Tony but not so close he’d scare Peter. The toddler cuddled further into his father’s embrace, hiding his face from the stranger.
"I think you could literally pull off anything. Even a man bun. However I must warn you if you do ever get a man bun then I will be forced to no longer be seen in public with you," she teased as he laughed along with his daughter. He rolled his eyes fondly as she moved to sit at the kitchen island.
“I...I am Spiderman! And stop calling me kid,” Miles said with a pout, not really arguing his own case. “I have the suit and the abilities, what makes you think I’m not-”
“Tony, my love, the baby is okay. We have a son.” The Omega whipped his head up at that, looking into his mate’s eyes with disbelief. “Nurse!” Tony looked around to see that there was only one nurse remaining, who smiled with a nod before leaving them.
That didn’t mean it didn’t freak him out from time to time, the thought that he was part of an actual happy family just, occasionally made him have mini panic attacks.
Emerson looked at them for a long moment with a small smile. She didn’t even know marriage could be like this. Her experience only showed violence, hatred, betrayal. Not this playful banter, unconditional love thing they have going on. I really don’t deserve this, she thought to herself sadly as the movie started.
“Well, my father was an abusive asshole, so I really only mourned my mom. And I was twice your age,” he said, smiling as she smiled and nodded in response.
Two days before her brother’s eighteenth birthday – the Avengers siren went off. She owes her Uncle Clint twenty bucks; he said Starks were cursed and something bad would happen on Pete’s big one eight. Just like their dads’ twentieth anniversary, and apparently on Pop’s ninety-fifth?
“Can I… um…” Tony brushed his fingers through her hair to tuck behind her ear, smiling in a way that fills her with warmth and encourages her to continue.
"Emerson, I am a little mad. But please let me speak my peace, I'll keep it short, then you'll help me pick out the playlist for the runway show, okay?" he said and smiled as she smiled in return.
“Okay...everything’s been okay with your dad?” Steve asked tentatively, watching Tony put his shoes back on.
Although, he’d never before brought a boy home that Barney had approved of. In fact the first time he met Rumlow - which had been an accident - Barney literally threw him out on his ass.
“…next week!” the brunette pointed out. “Come on, a spontaneous romantic trip is just what we need!” Steve couldn’t find a single argument against that, humming in approval as he closed his eyes to finally sleep.
“Because…because your mother never forgave me for your uncle’s death…and then when she found out she was pregnant…she swore you and I would never meet. And your dad kept her wishes. By the time I found out what happened to your father…it was too late.”
“Who said I didn’t like her?” he responded, handing the plate of burgers to Steve to carry back inside. “She’s still my niece. My niece who is also a terrorist. Now come on, you said they should be back from school by now.” Steve shook his head smiling as he followed his friend back to the kitchen. Sitting at the small table were his husband and his son while he noticed Emerson was filling a glass of water at the fridge.
“She…she called me ‘dad’ last night Steve. I was comparing myself to her father and she said I wasn’t her father. That she was happy about that. Because she liked me better as her…dad.” His eyes were glassy as he told Steve all of this, unable to stop the smile spreading and his hands from cupping his face in awe. Steve’s eyes got a little wet too, overcome with joy. He rolled the pair over until he was on top looking down at his handsome genius.
“Good start,” he said before bringing his hand down hard on her behind. She yelped at the sting and didn’t bother holding in the tears that followed his onslaught of smacks.
“I’m sorry, is this your…mistress?” Tony asked skeptically as Steve gingerly bandaged her foot. The woman in question’s face turned green and scrunched up at the question.
Needless to say, she was tired when she went to school the next day, unable to focus on her friend Xavier complaining about the latest Batman franchise.
The reminder of the scared six year old had Steve momentarily snap out of it, looking at his brother for confidence. The brunette smiled at him, nodding his head while Steve attempted his suggestion. Focusing all of his energy, he pushed ease and comfort through the bond, breathing a sigh of relief when he felt calmness coming through the other side.
“What’s wrong with a nanny?” his shorter father asked in confusion. Peter scoffed as loudly as he could before his other father spoke up for him.
“Okay, well. I’m too stubborn to initiate it and he’s probably glad to be free of a ‘white trash carnie’ for a friend.” She was startled when he suddenly brought his feet back down, seeing real anger behind his eyes for the first time.
“I…” Tony said in shock, words caught in his throat. He closed his eyes and hung his head, tears spilling down his cheeks when gentle hands brought his face back up.
“Remind me again why I put up with you?” he asked before pulling back, though still staying in his husband's hold. A dopey grin spread across that handsome bastard’s face before he bent down to steal a kiss from the shorter man’s lips.
She waited patiently, surprising the blonde further, until he brought the sandwich and sliced banana over to watch her eat.
“He’ll be home soon, sweetheart. I talked to him about half an hour ago, I promise he’s okay,” he said in assurance as he comforted her. “In the meantime, do you wanna keep me company till he comes home?”
though!?” he asked not caring how whiny he sounded, hating that on top of everything else going on in his life, his little brother had stolen and copied his superhero identity.
“You can’t talk to me like that!” Tiberius demanded, wiping the grass from his clothes as Steve walked over to hold Howard back. Who honestly looked like he wanted to rip the Alpha’s neck out with his teeth.
“I know, Steve,” the brunette said, ducking his head away and walking past him. Steve turned around and watched him walk towards a table with some mechanical device on it. He followed him, looking at all the machinery and computers until he heard a kind of chirp sound.
“Loooooove youuu,” he said still embarrassing his kid. He immediately let out an “oof” when she swung her legs up, using the momentum to tumble backwards off to the other side of the bed. He curled up a little, hands protectively around his groin as she smugly walked out of the room, weirdly proud of that move.
His head lolled on his shoulder, and Peter found himself clutching the boy a little tighter to his chest as he saw his husband and Melanie waiting outside for them. Even if Peter had been doubting Leo's placement with them, he couldn't deny the overwhelming urge to protect this child.
Steve’s smile faded as he looked back at the sleeping lump. He frowned when he looked back at his husband.
“Yeah, what else would we be rubbing, huh?” the brunette teased. Steve chose to ignore him in favor of painting the picture in his mind.
Tony wanted a tall glass of scotch so badly, but instead decided to bite the bullet and tell his parents as well.
On the way back from lunch with Aunt Nat, she stopped to pick up the mail. After parking her car, she grabbed the envelopes and made her way inside.
Harley must’ve noticed Steve’s change in attention, as the pup not only quieted but suddenly melted himself into the Alpha’s side. When the pup’s hands clenched around Steve’s legs, the taller blonde finally looked down at the smaller one.
“Ack!” Tony squeaked out, smiling reassuringly at his daughter who immediately sat up. He didn’t want to interrupt her, but his bruised abdomen wouldn’t allow it.
"Thor!" the super soldier exclaimed to get his attention, throwing his hands up in the air in exasperation. The taller blonde looked quizzically back to the father before smiling at seeing both men.
“Pssst, May, Steve wants to talk to you. If you could…keep our stories straight…I told him we ran into each other – let’s say at a bookstore – and you invited me over for tea…” she pleaded, glad to see the woman laugh and reach for the phone with a nod.
“Did I tell you guys about that?” Jo interrupted him, turning to her parents. “He told me if one of you died then he’d happily be my step-dad. He said he’d take either one of you.” Tony and Steve shared a look before bursting out laughing.
“Looks like someone’s got a crush,” Aunt Peggy teased, making Tony frown as he pulled his son away from the smelly baby.
“I like her,” Wade said with a bright smile, as if this entire thing hadn’t been a complete disaster.
“So, Emerson,” Tony started, waiting for his husband to sit on the other side of her before continuing. “We’ve been talking. And since you’ve been here a while, it only seems right to…” the genius found himself suddenly lacking words, thankful his husband spoke up.
“You heard the woman.” It took Tony a second to realize the confident voice had come from his own mouth, surprising himself as he looked over at Steve...almost for confirmation.
Steve quickly whirled around and enveloped both of his ridiculously incredible kids into a bear hug, before mercilessly tickling the pair.
“Steve?” May asked after putting the phone to her ear. “Yeah not a problem at all, Joey’s a delight. Uh huh. Well…that’s why I offered the tea, Steven,” she threw a wink at the teen, who felt herself calm down a little at that.
“There you are! Think you can just come and go from my gym as you please?” his Pappy asked, faux anger in his voice as he shuffled over to the pair. “And who’s this lad?”
She could not possibly decide among the six adorable kittens in front of her as she and her brother sat in the kitten area. Miles was trying to persuade her to get the orange one, but the tuxedo kitten was currently passed out on her lap and was definitely winning. She looked back at her dads who were talking to the woman that ran the shelter, smiling cause she remembers their conversation in the car about making a donation to the shelter.
“Oh Steven, you should know by now I don’t share,” Tony purred out before leaning down, kissing the blonde sweetly on the lips.
A week went by and she didn’t grow to like Vivienne any more. In fact...she was really starting to dislike her. Like when she spent the night with them. Daci had a nightmare and went to her father’s room, where Vivienne intercepted her and made her go back to her own bed. The woman had made sure she had Wolf and offered her a smile, but Daci felt something cold behind her eyes.
"Run that by me again," the super soldier said as he started to unwrap the tape on his hands. His husband had interrupted his workout, but not of course before gawking at him for a few minutes before interrupting him and his punching bag.
One day before his birthday – she was walking around the block, enjoying the blooming trees and sunshine as she practiced her deep breathing. She always liked to take some time to walk around the beautiful area her therapist’s clinic was in to calm down after sessions; especially when neither of her dads could take her. She thinks she’s starting to get a better handle on her…mental illness.
“Seeb, up!” she said with a smile. When she decided to crawl closer to him, he stopped her with a hand out and a ‘nu-uh’. She looked back at him with the same offended look Bucky has just thrown at him, causing the blonde to chuckle a little.
“Well, Harley’s middle name is Patrick and Morgan’s is Elisabeth,” Steve answered with a smile as Daci mulled those names over in her head.
Sure enough, the British voice spoke over the loudspeakers in every room of the mansion, asking Joey to join them in the living room. They sat there for several minutes as both Tony and Steve’s confidence began to waver.
"Oh yeah?" Steve asked, suddenly nervous at the prospect of meeting him. His other half sensed that, grabbing his hand and leading the two back to his car.
Her family blessedly remained quiet as she felt her Pops sit behind her and gently rub her back. The family of four sat in silence for a few moments longer before her Pop’s interest piqued.
“Yeah, took me a while. Now I love them...Daci if you ever want to talk about what happened, I want you to know you can talk to me, okay? You know...you know I went through similar...circumstances.” Daci smiled at the suggestion, feeling unwanted tears begin to form in her eyes from the amount of trust and security she felt at the moment.
“I think so buttercup.” She smiled at that, also appreciating the fact that Tony was leading this conversation.
But his shame and embarrassment got the better of him, thanking the man before heading home to finish the rest of his joint.
Steve froze a little at that, looking up at his Pappy who was only looking at Harley. The Alpha even opened his mouth to answer for him but Harley beat him to it.
The Omega had kind of secretly been hoping his Alpha would be too big headed to let Ty back into their lives, but then he wouldn’t have been the Alpha he fell head over heels for.
“That he’ll need physical therapy and recovery time, but he’ll be fine!” she said excitedly as she walked along with him, moving to push her brother along. He walked behind them as they made their way around the corner; eternally grateful SHIELD had locked this whole wing down. His heart was beating rapidly even though he restrained himself to walk at a leisurely pace.
But this wasn’t a grown man he would eventually marry; this was his barely sixteen year old traumatized kid. Who was right when she had snapped at him at dinner.
“Green really isn’t your color, Barton,” Tony sneered back, a smile still on his face as he turned to look for Steve. It was of course at that time that a certain head cheerleader, still wearing her crown - which Tony realized Steve had taken off and left somewhere - sauntered her way to him.
“Yeah,” Steve said after he collected himself, wiping his face of happy tears, “they tend to do that.”
Bruce she met when Tony took her to his labs at Stark Industries, Steve remembering Tony and Emerson retelling of the day. He hadn’t realized she was interested in science and loved the way she went off on a tangent about Bruce being smarter than Tony, only earning a glare from the genius. Who, the captain noted, was also sporting a small smile.
“Well, one year ago this weekend, Daddy and I got married. So we’re going to have private just Papa and Daddy time to celebrate, okay?” Steve responded gently, knowing how Peter can be.
He checked the regular places he knew she liked to hang out at, as well as at a few of her friends’ houses. Nothing.
“Hey! Good job, buddy,” Steve said with a smile as he grabbed a can, ignoring the scoff coming from the genius who grabbed his own along with the tray to set aside.
“Well I guess we’ll have to have a movie night after dinner, won’t we?” the Omega said as he walked around and loudly kissed the pup’s cheek. Steve watched for a moment, a smile on his face as he wondered if this was a life he could have.
"Whatever feels right baby boy, we'll love you no matter who you end up loving," the brunette said as he walked around and kissed the boy's cheek. Emerson smiled before she started leaving the kitchen again.
The day of their wedding, Steve was having trouble wrangling the four and a half year old into his tiny tux. Joey stood unimpressed by their side.
“But…” Steve said, his inner Alpha changing to being defensive. His mate seemed to catch on, grabbing his hands to further get his attention.
- growl. "Obviously I love you more...fiance..." His protective partner smiled at that, taking the one step closer to kiss the blonde. "Still can't believe it," Clint said absently.
“Sucker punching me was low, even for a trashy dyke like yourself…so I wanted to see if you’re free after school today. For a fair fight,” Staci said, finishing with her arms crossing her chest. Joey stared back at her, never really one to back down from a fight.
“Well, then we’re staying here,” he said, putting the dress down and crossing his arms over his broad chest.
Clint took that opportunity to check out his own crush while he tried to come up with a plan to talk to Bucky again.
“Hmm,” his genius hummed as he walked past Steve holding the door for him, “guess I’ll just have to come up with a creative punishment then.”
“Anthony, you’re already sleeping on the couch tonight, you wanna lose your lab privileges too?” Steve asked him. The genius immediately pouted at that, knowing how true to his word that stubborn blonde of his was.
"That means Max will come back home?" Emerson eyes rolled as she felt a soft hand clasp into hers. She turned and smiled at her love, leaning into the kiss as she was distracted from her little brother's betrayal.
"Where are my flowers?" Wade whined as Miles pouted with a "I don't get any flowers?" The others in the room laughed at the two as Peter felt his sister elbow him in the side, whispering "
“Steve also has ears and is standing right next to you,” the blonde groaned out as he joined the others on the couch. “Why don’t we go back to Bucky cheating on Clint?” Steve knew, okay? He knew he shouldn’t have said it, cause he knew exactly who his brother was.
“I’m better knowing I have a Peter. And yes Mama, I just handed him back to the nurse after scenting him. He’s perfect. Just like his big brother,” Tony answered his parents while snuggling his pup that much closer to his body.
“Hello, Emerson, my name is Katherine Williams. Feel free to call me Kate,” she said with a kind smile.
“My name is Daciana. My Tati gave it to me,” she spit out before being electrocuted again, her body shaking as tears began forming behind her eyes. It only lasted a moment but it felt much longer.
“I made a new friend today! He’s a new kid, his name is Wade Wilson and he’s super weird. He said we would probably get married one day.”
The rest of their vacation was incredibly relaxing, so much so that Steve had even calmed down a little to talk to Joey about what she did the first night they left.
while also sipping his coffee. "Fine, Wade does all the cooking," he admitted as his family laughed aloud. Jarvis interrupted before Emerson's stomach started hurting too badly from all the laughing.
“We’re trying to figure out which princess everyone will be,” Emerson said as she kept her focus on the tablet, Steve just now noticing she had a pen and paper pad in hand.
“Oh please,” Howard said with a scoff. “That took a few minutes, I did actually have business around the world. Plus took your Mother to Italy to visit your Nonna, she’s getting better, by the way. The little Stone shit was just a detour in our travels. A successful detour that involved intimidating a punk little Alpha…” Tony absorbed that information with a satisfied smile on his face.
She jumped off his lap, wincing in pain from the sudden movement. Steve reached his hands out to steady her, looking at her in concern as she balanced herself with his outstretched arms.
By the time he’d made it home, he had definitely calmed down. Not significantly, mind you. He was still pissed as hell as he went straight to his room, ignoring whichever sibling was calling him as he slammed his door shut before collapsing on his bed.
Familiar arms wrapped around him from behind, his husband’s head gently resting in the crook of his neck.
She immediately took that as regretful confirmation, cries increasing as she further curled around her pillow in anguish.
“Bambino, come sit with us,” Tony told his son, one hand over his now visible tummy as the pup put down his legos to go over to the pair. He and Steve were sitting on the couch together and Tony pulled the pup between them. “We wanted to talk to you about something…”
, wants to mock you over who you love, I will happily defend you. Just like you have against racist assholes for me.”
“You’ve been in a fight, I can see that Joey,” he said softly as she turned and looked incredulously at him. “Someone used your ribs as a punching bag and something happened to your face,” he added as Tony rejoined them and sat on the other side of Joey after handing her the glass.
Tony’s mind immediately went to some aspect of Steve’s body, and was confused when the blonde didn’t start taking off his clothes after shutting the door. He watched him go to his closet, which perked the genius’ interest again as Steve reached up on a high shelf and pulled out...a notebook?
“Get off this property. And if you want to contact me, you can send me an email at my Stark Industry account, since I’m CEO and all.” Howard unsurprisingly lunged at the words, but Obadiah was smart enough to haul him back before Joe could do any further damage.
So that Friday he dragged Tony with him to Buck’s baseball game, sitting on the bleachers behind home plate with Clint - in what he realized was a perfect view of the senior’s ass. He hadn’t even known his friend was the catcher, which only kind of made him feel worse about not paying attention to him.
“- don’t lie Steve. I see him. I know he doesn’t sleep. I see that look in his eye. He’s sad. And I can’t...I can’t change that. He needs...he needs what you and Tony have.” That got a quirked brow from the super soldier before a smile slowly spread across his face.
“Those fucking bitches! I can’t believe this! Give me their names I will ruin their pathetic lives before it’s even started. They have NO IDEA –”
“You drawing pictures of me said that,” Tony added, cause he was not going to be out-trolled. And man did it work, the blonde blushing furiously - even in their low light from the lamp post.
Peter padded in to the kitchen with hair sticking up in all places, looking around the room until he saw the person he was looking for.
“Your chest is perfect, beloved,” he shouted back at the ridiculous group of people he proudly called his family. Steve stood up, smiling as Tony immaturely threw a “nani nani boo boo” at their kids, making his way over to the three. He leaned down to kiss his husband, saying “you make a very sexy mermaid” before kissing him. The two teenagers groaned before Emerson spoke up.
“Yes, the cunt. So when Staci the cunt and her entourage approached me between classes, she called me a dyke in front of Mr. Jefferson and he said nothing. He did, however, address me as Miss Stark…
haven’t watched the twins solo.” He took the opportunity to eat more of his fries before his Dad responded.
“Pops,” she greeted back, taking deep breaths and kicking her legs in the water. He kept staring at her with a stupid smile, making her quickly lose her patience and snap, “
“We should uh…” Tony said, suddenly noticing how excited he was becoming below a writhing super soldier. “We should continue our anniversary.” Steve’s eyes comically dilated before him, curiosity on his face as he grinded down on the brunette’s growing erection. “I believe there was some mention of me having my wicked way with you?”
“Yeah…good luck with that,” Steve said with a smile of his own, not wanting to think what kind of trouble she could get into if she did this much as a toddler. He felt lucky he could watch her from afar, loving his niece dearly but not wanting that kind of responsibility.
“Fine, we’ll go. Just know El Toro sends his regards, puta.” He spit that last word out, Peter recognizing the words were Spanish for “the bull” and “bitch.” He hadn’t noticed he had also stepped in between Emerson and the gang until he felt her hands squeezing the back of his shirt, angry and powerless as they walked away.
“Yeah Pepper! You’re not being very nice right now,” Mr. Stark said with a pout as he stumbled to sit by his friend’s side; suddenly aware of the blonde in front of him.
“Says you told her you didn’t want kids when she was 8, and four years later boom, she’s your kid. How do you think that made her feel? You know what else she said?!” he asked a little more forcefully.
have discussions with my son, I don’t start by throwing him down some stairs,” Joe growled out as he crossed his arms over his chest. That’s when Tony noticed Sarah at the door, phone against her ear as she spoke softly to someone.
the two blocks home?” he asked in a dangerously quiet tone. Her eyes shot up at that, because he totally skipped past the
Which isn’t fair, because his heart has secretly been hurting him lately. Not that he wanted to admit that out loud. It was probably just the resurfacing of a certain fuck-face…
She’d be lying if she said she wasn’t somewhat thankful. She wasn’t the reason her last family “didn’t work out.” She didn’t shove her tongue down her foster brother’s throat. But to be fair, she also hadn’t calmly defended herself when his biological mother – her new foster mother – confronted her about unwanted advances and “tainting” her son. So here she was, glad to be out of that house even if it meant a lecture from Mr. Simon Hoggs, aka the social worker who immediately believed the mother without so much as asking her what happened.
“Papa look! Check out my Wonder Woman toy Uncle Rhodey brought! And Morgan has a new stuffed animal,” Peter said excitedly, climbing out of Tony’s lap to run over to Steve. They spent the next hour going through all the toys and taking away the foam axes - Steve’s rule, unfortunately.
“No, part of my negotiation with Fury was to pick my battles, and mostly be a backup. You will always come first, ficca.” {
“Look, I…” here Steve faltered in confidence. Luckily the waitress came back and gave them their drinks, Steve talking the opportunity to take a sip; and a deep breath to allow him to gather his thoughts.
All day, she thought about what would happen if she lost Tony. Tony, who’d just gotten into her life only to be stripped away from her.
In spite of the worry in his gut and hurt in his heart at the child’s outright rejection - he was starting to really love this kid.
“So she did fake her own death?” Peter asked, getting another ear flick, eliciting another yelp in pain.
Harley even let Steve carry the sleepy pup home, which won the Alpha sweet, sweet rewards from his Omega when they went to bed that night.
Peter apparently did the same as Dad, because Pop was instantly rubbing his hand over the teen's face in annoyance. The arachnid grabbed Miles to use as a human shield, tickling the little boy in the process. Emerson and her Dad reached over to try and intervene, but Peter just tickled the boy harder. They went for Peter instead, dragging him over to their Dad's lap as their Pop pulled a shrieking Miles away from his brother; everyone laughing at the silliness of the situation.
“Not nearly as amazing as you, babe,” he said with a sly smile as he got the blonde to laugh. Large but gentle hands cradled his face, thumbs stroking his goatee as the beautiful blue eyed man brought their lips together to kiss. He snaked his arms around the unfairly narrow waist, bringing them closer and having Tony realize he would do anything for this man.
Lacy, who was always kind to Steve, told him about his mom giving the ‘verbal ass-kicking of a lifetime’ to that woman. That would’ve been the only other contact he’d had with her, other than calling her the day her granddaughter was born and her daughter died.
“I’d be more than happy to teach you too, Leo. If I can teach this block of led to not sink, I can teach you to swim,” the old man said as he stuck his tongue out at her. She splashed him in return.
She finally focused on her destination, taking the elevator to the top floor and around the hallway corner to her Dad’s office. His assistant was there and turned to greet her.
“I’m sorry, Buck. I’m sorry for not coming to more games. And I’m sorry for not being there for you with Clint. I should have-”
"Get your hands off of her," came the voice made of steel before the person made themselves visible.
“Actually, my favorite are hawks. Part of where I got the nickname,” Clint replied with a smile, squeezing her hand and leading the group to get tickets. Once inside, she couldn’t help but stop in her tracks.
So he walked after the ball in one of Steve’s comfy hoodies, enjoying how the sun felt against his face. He should’ve known his good day wouldn’t last, as a purposeful cough caught his attention just as he reached the ball.
“You should know,” Kate said as she walked her out, “whatever you say is between us, we can involve your fathers as much as you’d feel comfortable with.” Emerson smiled as she made her way to the lobby, saying goodbye before walking to reception to schedule more appointments.
Ty remained quiet, a disgusting smirk on his face as he simply looked between the three men. He took a moment to look down at his phone before responding.
“No, no everything is not okay,” Tony said before turning to his mate. “I got a call from work that some little fucker had used their Voice on Harley. And I can’t get his Prima Alpha to step up and help him because he’s a worthless piece of shit,” Tony spit out, turning back to his phone and dialing, not watching as Steve walked past him. He also had a hand on his stomach, feeling his protective parental rage take over. “Listen here you dickless, spineless poor excuse for an Alpha. Your son needs you, but
“Can we do something nice for Daddy? To cheer him up?” Steve couldn’t stop himself if he tried, picking that sweet kid up and hugging him tight before responding.
Those words took two full seconds to register in his mind before he felt his anger begin to shift to the small child.
“I fell on my face, Daddy,” Peter said with an adorable pout, rubbing his tiny hand over the spot for good measure. Steve couldn’t hide his smile as he got an ice pack, knowing the boy was hamming it up a little based on his previous behavior, but also knowing that their boy was five. And could always use undivided attention from his Daddy.
"Oh God, it's already happening," the woman said over dramatically. Peter stepped forward to face the couple, doing his best to keep his anger at bay.
“Did Dad call you crying again?” she asked with a laugh, often listening in on those calls when her Dad was too exhausted and needed Uncle Steve to come to the rescue. She ran her uninjured hand over her face in exhaustion.
“After your Dad died, I thought about how little family you had. You just had me. And if something happened to me? ...I got scared and I emailed her, asking her if she’d like to be a part of your life. And that
He took a moment to smile at his family curled in bed. Emerson lay on her side with her back to her brother, looking up at her father with a small smile. He pulled the blanket back to join her, waiting for her to curl herself up around him before he settled to get comfortable. He placed a kiss to her forehead before tightening his hold on his girl, finally letting his brain shut down and sleep.
He was sitting next to Sarah and Helen, drinking coffee with the ladies Sunday morning while Steve and Joe had gone fishing. Aunt Peggy was out of the country for the weekend and he was thoroughly enjoying spending the weekend at the Rogers’ home. He had opted out of sweating in a boat with two grumbling men in favor of leisuring around with his grandma and future mother in law, who was getting better and better everyday.
“Jo, you have lumps, plural?” he asked carefully (and skeptically). She looked panic-stricken and quickly grabbed one of his hands to place on the outside of her right breast. His Captain role easily took over, gently feeling what she was talking about…before laughing fondly.
The next video made him freeze with fury, as it had just occurred the other night. And showed Vivienne spraying something on him before leaving his bed - without him waking up - to tell a crying Daci at his bedroom door that she was too old to sleep in ‘their’ bed and there wasn’t any room.
“Suzie Q how did you even get up on the counter? I told you I was going to get you a slice,” Bucky growled out as he wiped the girl’s face and hands with a paper towel.
“No,” Harley said with a smile, getting a chuckle from Daci and Peter and a groan from the adults. Her Tati came over and sat by her side as the couple kissed their boys in goodbye and made their exit.
"Tony!" his Pop said before turning his attention to his eldest. "What's up Pete, why all the gifts?"
“Isn’t the kid gone? You should take advantage of that and have fun for once, Rogers. I’m serious, I’ll be your wingman if you need help finding some good pussy.”
He had suggested it to Steve, who immediately agreed – and didn’t know that was a thing you could do for kids of famous parents. But here she was looking at him like he’d just announced she was in his will.
"Dad, tomorrow is Saturday," the boy countered. Tony reached over to check his phone, hating himself a little for losing track of the days. He considered what Steve would say, then remembered that he wasn't here.
I saw somewhere online the idea of the Sarah Rogers foundation, where Steve starts a non-profit that helps single moms; homeless, victims of domestic violence, immigrants, etc. Too cute not to include <3
Bucky frowned when he realized why she was laughing, and playfully shoved his brother as they turned down the cereal aisle.
She’d been with them about four months at this point. As luck would have it, everyone was home this Sunday afternoon which prompted the four to watch a movie. Tony sat in the corner of the large “L” shaped couch, hogging the best seat, Em noted, with his tablet in his hands. Emerson was sitting on his right, straightening the blanket out to share with Tony, who gave her a quick smile in gratitude. Steve, who surprised both Tony and Em with a “seat check,” was in the bathroom while Peter came in to join them, popcorn in hand.
Which of course is endearing and hilarious to look back on, but it could’ve been avoided if she had a mom.
“Uh huh,” the teen teased before letting him go. “And you,” she said as she pointed a finger at Steve, “don’t pretend you aren’t the secret brains of this operation. I see you over there making marble brownies…which I happen to know are your favorite…”
“Sonny, would you say bye to Cher already?” Joey groaned, though it didn’t sound nearly as sharp as it could’ve been.
“Kids, don’t tease the fossil” he said before leaning up to kiss his husband’s cheek. This only added to the growing giggle fest happening in front of him. “Tonyyyyy,” he whined.
Clint was scooting to the edge of the bed and sitting on it, looking wearily at Bucky as he walked over to sit down next to him.
“Jumping off rooftops in spandex…on the other hand,” she teased before turning back to the window. He smiled at her back before grabbing a towel and spray to help.
“Could we go to the gym today?” she asked quietly before pulling out of the hug, puppy eyes looking up at him - making him cave easily.
"How did you even meet a woman?" Nat asked suspiciously, not appearing to be happy about the news either.
Steve was livid but tried not to convey that over the phone as his Omega begged him to go grab the pup, since Tony had already planned back to back meetings at SI.
“Yeah Stevie, he’s the champion,” the older Alpha said. “You on the other hand need to work for a living, I’m not paying you to sit around and do nothing. Get back to work!”
“I’ll call you later,” Steve whispered against his mouth before kissing him again. And a few more times until Tony returned the smile. Then Steve got up, finished getting dressed and smiled before heading back to his apartment.
After a few rounds, they decided it was time for presents and cake. The only clean ones were May, Pepper and Peter - all who opted out. Everyone else was covered in dirt and paint splatters, sitting around the wooden tables under the canopy.
Steve shook his head, remembering that situation just a little differently, but decided not to comment when he saw the cheek-to-cheek smile from the teenager, noticing how “new daughter” hadn’t fazed her at all. He continued shaking his head when he heard his son join them.
He went to check the kitchen for his husband, but frowned when he didn’t find him there. Which meant he was probably in his lab. The blonde sighed before heading to their bedroom to finally crash.
They were still laughing at Sam’s expense when a nurse came from down the hall the surgery was taking place. They all stopped and turned to her. Emerson stood up and walked to the nice looking woman.
“Told you Staci!” she heard Alexis laugh, “told you the dyke had a dick!” She heard the others laugh around her, keeping her eyes down as she planned a counter attack.
Clint took the bag as he squinted at him, halfway teasing and halfway bringing his walls up, before he stepped back to let the older teen inside. As he watched him step inside, he brought a breadstick out to chew.
“Oh, hello,” Clint said to the little man, smiling when the boy held his arms up. Clint happily obliged, reaching down before hoisting the toddler on his hip, the two watching Bucky scold his sister.
“I know it’s you, you son of a bitch. At least have the decency to face me.” Wade slowly turned around, still wearing that ridiculous fake mustache. He reached out to pull it off when Wade stepped back, preventing him.
“Good, glad that’s settled,” Joey said before turning to grab a few of the strawberries already dipped and popping one in her mouth.
“Daddy guess what? Father bought me this cool robot dinosaur and he said we could assemble it together! Isn’t that awesome?” Tony took a moment to hug his son before turning to his ex.
“Hey!” Tony said in shock, before turning back to the teen. “Looking past all of his faults,” Tony shot back. “Just…I mean…can you blame me?” he said gesturing to Steve’s body.
Tony and Steve waited another moment, both probably thinking the same thing about their son, before turning to Emerson. They had already discussed this with Peter and felt like now was a good time to officially ask her. They’d had a lot of missions and meetings and business trips the last few weeks.
“Morning Papa and Daddy! It’s time for breakfast!” the almost five year old shouted as he scrambled his way onto their bed and proceeded to hurl his tiny body on top of them. Tony groaned before burying his face in his pillow as he felt his husband shift next to him.
“I don’t care if she starts drinking when she’s 21, I just don’t want her to drink underage. I don’t care that you drink, I actually find you incredibly charming and maybe even a little sexy when you’re drunk,” Steve blurted out, pausing when Tony just looked surprised back at him. “I love you Tony. I love you so much it
It took three books, but right about the time the third one ended she felt a shift below her. Rolling off to the side, she watched in amazement as the sleeping Hulk shifted back to a sleeping Dr. Banner. Putting the books to the side, she quietly approached him before sitting by his feet.
"Miles is safe, he actually found me earlier, but...they think Klaue has your daughter," she said sadly at the news.
“Except next time I won’t be safely in bed when it happens,” she said as she started pacing the room. “I’ll be walking the street, or riding my bike, or maybe it happens when I’m driving and die at the wheel,” she finished with a crack in her voice.
“Look,” he began carefully, “I know I haven’t been the easiest person to talk to, especially lately. But I meant it when I said you can tell me anything. Okay?” he asked with a small smile. “If you want to,” he quickly added, not wanting to pressure her.
“I hope he likes dinosaurs!” Harley exclaimed excitedly, oblivious of the two adult’s anguish as the pup ate some fruit. They ate lunch in silence while the pup occasionally asked curious questions regarding his birth father.
He knew Buck used to spank her when she was little. She wasn’t a bad kid, but she’d often do things without his permission or things that would get her hurt. Mostly it was just a swat here or there, but he’s heard Bucky tell him how awful it was to actually spank her. His brother used to tell him it was the absolute worst part of parenting. Steve’s had the displeasure of doing it once, a few months after Bucky died. She ran away from home when she was just twelve and literally almost got herself sex-trafficked. They were both pretty shaken up afterwards.
“Thanks for the warning,” Joey said sincerely, nibbling on a French fry as she’d suddenly lost her appetite.
They had spent the day at a carnival a few cities away, glad for the lack of recognition the two fathers usually got. That night, Steve left Tony to do some additional work in his lab, curling up to sleep in their bed. He hadn’t meant to stay up that late, glancing at the clock reading 1:04AM, but he and Tony had stayed up a little talking about the upcoming meeting about the accords. His eyes shut; he was just starting to feel himself on the brink of sleep when his super hearing picked up the small sound of his door opening.
“That’s all I was saying!” Bucky shouted, mostly to his mate. Clint of course didn’t look convinced, just walking around to sit on the chair farthest from Bucky. Sam had plopped himself on the couch next to a grumpy Bucky.
Steve laughed a little at that, “Till my voice was hoarse, which wasn’t actually that long, since I also yelled at him in the field.” He chuckled when she laughed, relishing the sound.
"That's your son," she said to her wife accusingly, who simply pulled her phone out again to snap a few more pics.
"You've been through a lot little Thumper, you have to give yourself more than a year to get past it. And it's definitely not a decision you make
He was too busy trying to keep a straight face, and the five year old suddenly noticed how fondly he was looking at both her
[Hey love, so…Xavier is joining us for dinner to make up with Jo. And after you and I should talk…cause Voldemort’s publicist reached out to me today]
His brother winced at the thought, looking back at his girl while Steve helped himself up to make his own exit.
“– I don’t know,” the shorter man said, shoulders shrugging. “I don’t know,” he repeated as he wrapped his arms around the super soldier – sighing as he returned the bear hug. Steve kissed Tony’s cheek before settling his head in the crook of the genius’ neck, breathing in the smell of motor oil and lavender.
“You’re starting to grow on me, Barnes. I never approve of the schmucks dingus over there brings home, but you seem like a decent guy.”
"Oh, no, it's really not that baaaaaaaaaa-" she finished with a groan as she keeled over. She ignored the comforting back rub as he said, "elevators kiddo."
"I'm really not," the teen deadpanned back, face breaking into a smile when his father began poking him with his outstretched feet.
“Seriously?” the arachnid asked, glaring at the man who was completely unfazed by it. “Leo, you’re not in trouble, I know who’s responsible here,” he said, glad to see a smile appear on the boy’s face. “Has he introduced you to his bots yet?”
She squawked in protest but he was already down the hall and walking to the elevator before she could even muster a rebuttal. Knowing resistance was futile and she was too tired to be any sassy, she lay quietly over his shoulder as he eventually led the two to the…roof?
“Right, well, let me go shower and I’ll come back and help,” the blonde grumbled, smiling at his ridiculous family before making his way to their shower. He made it quick so he could rejoin them in the living room, hair still damp as he found his favorite people in the same positions that he left them.
“Josephine?” she asked as the teen came to a complete halt a few feet away. The woman looked slightly familiar, but nothing actually came to mind as to why she would know her name.
“Hey, to be fair, Daci didn’t use any of her powers,” Peter spoke up on her behalf, having been a witness to what happened at recess. Clint gently pulled her out of his embrace, but she kept her head down, unable to face him. .
“Buck…you okay?” the blonde asked with concern. His brother looked in the direction of the bathroom, waiting to hear running water before responding.
"Her tracker is moving, it's moving fast Steve," Tony said as he turned to look at the man. He grabbed a hold of his husband, the two flying off to follow whatever it was that was taking their daughter away from them.
“Yeah, I’m sorry if she scared you buddy, she’ll be okay,” Steve said with a smile as he turned to Peter.
“Nope!” Joey practically shouted, immediately closing her eyes in embarrassment as she heard the angel laugh again.
“Alright Buck Morgan should wake from her nap soon. Her teething toys are in the freezer, just stick one in her mouth when she starts crying. There’s pasta sauce from yesterday if you just want to boil some noodles for their dinner. We’ll be back around midnight. Only call us if you’ve already tried Bruce, Clint and Tasha. Alright boys, you be good for Uncle Bucky, okay?”
They sat quietly for a few minutes before they heard some mumbling coming from the sleepy teen. Tony leaned back a little to let her sit up a little, arms still loosely wrapped around her.
Wade helped halt his thought process with a quick kiss on his lips, pulling away with a slap to the shorter man's ass. Peter glared at the back of Wade's head as he waited a moment longer before joining his ridiculous family.
“Yeah, I’ll leave the pictures as a surprise. Wouldn’t want you to have to change your pants before we head back downstairs. Cause the things I’m thinking of, involve lube and lingerie…”
“In his lab, being a cranky sourpuss,” Steve answered, letting out an ‘ooph’ when Harley came out of nowhere and jumped onto his lap - not at all gently. “Harley, baby, we’ve talked about this,” he attempted to say sternly. Attempted, since his little blonde was giggling up at him.
“I got distracted,” she said as she tried to reach around his giant frame to grab a piece of chicken. He saw and blocked her again. “If dinner’s not ready by six why can’t I be a little late?”
“Wow. You can go fuck yourself,” Barton snapped before shutting the door in his face. Bucky was tempted to continue their fight, but just brought his anger and confusion about who told on him back to his own floor, where a nervous Daci was waiting for him.
The one he’d heard about from Tony early on - who explained how toxic his ex was and how she’d only been after his fame and money.
“Well,” Steve began, momentarily letting him off the hook from explaining further. “He seems to think he’s the love of your life…considering you’ve dated since you were teens…” he trailed off, hands still gripping his hips to keep the man grounded. Tony’s hands finally fell from his face, tears in his eyes as he looked at Steve in pain.
The thought of once again upgrading his arm got him distracted long enough to stop, which had Pietro collide into his legs. Knocking him flat on his ass.
“I don’t know,” Steve finally answered, snapping her from her thoughts. “But I called your neurologist and we’re seeing her this afternoon. Happy will pick up your school work and they already gave you an excused absence for the day. All you need to worry about right now is waking up, okay?” he asked as he brushed some of her long hair behind her ear. She hummed in response, trying to decide whether she’d like him to move or not. Her stomach ultimately made the decision for her.
Even his own parents, who they told over lunch at their mansion. His Mama burst into tears again, but this time with obvious tears of joy. His father, who was holding Harley in his lap, congratulated them before kissing the pup’s head.
what all of this is about? All that bullshit about me cheating on you or...finding your replacement?” the blonde stuttered out, still in disbelief. “Because you think I regret retiring?”
“He’s getting it done quickly to put everyone’s mind at ease. It’s not because we couldn’t put off such a procedure for a while, he’s not dying from this – I promise,” Steve said as he took a drink of his water. She looked back at Tony who smiled at her in response.
“Oh, I um...I passed,” her Tati said with a blush on his face, walking towards the recliner before sitting down with Harley in his lap. Daci watched with a smile as everyone congratulated him before she walked over to sit on the ground next to Steve and Morgan.
"Where are our parents?" he asked her, smiling as she kept reading her book and didn't look up to answer.
“I love you Joey,” he added for good measure, promising himself he’d say it more often. She squirmed a little in his lap, only to bury her head in his neck and wrap her arms around him again.
Now, two things stuck out to her Dad when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Alcohol and marijuana both trigger seizures. He had lectured her over and over again the dangers of those things. Not only what it would do to her adolescent brain, but what would happen if she seized around people that could take advantage of her.
“Sometime tonight, love.” Peter hummed in response, looking like he was thinking as they pulled up to their home. He was quiet until they got to the elevator.
The room silenced as Tony quickly got up to walk over to the blonde. Steve was wearing his scrubs, happy tears in his eyes as he met his husband halfway.
"It's not a big deal," her father grumbled, though she could feel his smile without even seeing him. She wasn't sure how she felt about that.
“No problem Aunt Tasha,” she said with a grin, immediately taking off when Hulk gently placed her on the ground. It only took about ten minutes of chasing before Hulk collapsed next to her aunt on the ground.
She got a few kicks in, and one backhand to the biggest of them; Alexis Washington. But ultimately they were able to hold her back as Staci approached her – and proceeded to punch her in the ribs several times. And though this bitch was skinny, apparently she had lean muscle hiding under the skin and bones she called a body. Because this shit actually hurt.
Her stance only lasted another second, before her arms waved frantically again; further explaining herself to Steve.
He looked up, expecting Tony to maybe have changed his mind, only to see his daughter standing there with tears in her eyes. He quickly sat up and beckoned her over, catching her when she threw herself onto him.
Peter couldn't help but laugh a little at that, wondering if he was being honest as he finished packing his own suitcase. Wade slung his backpack over his shoulder before walking over to Peter, kissing him on the cheek before saying his goodbye.
“Or, counter offer-” her Dad said before promptly shoving the man into the pool. Emerson and Miles both burst out laughing as their Pop came sputtering out of the water. The genius was standing tall on the edge, hands resting on his hips in triumph.
“Oh. See…I thought it was cause you secretly wanted to fuck my dads…?” Jo teased back, the other two turning to the poor boy whose dark skin turned pink at the confession and brown eyes shot wide open.
“He doesn’t need controls, Steve. . He’s an AI. Artificial Intelligence. Again, don’t tell him that cause he’ll just-” Tony was interrupted by the sounds of ‘whirring’ as DUM-E appeared to be spinning in circles from the praise.
“Don’t fret Master Tony, I brought you grape juice as well,” Jarvis said, appearing a moment later with glasses and a plastic one for Harley.
“Are you guys talking about Emerson?” Peter asked as he hopped up on the counter near his dads. Both men turned to look at their son before nodding. “She’s made it a point of not having me over. At first I thought it was because literally everyone in my class wants to see the Tower, but she won’t let you guys drive her home. I think she doesn’t want anyone to know where she lives.”
“What was that, doll?” the cheeky bastard sing-songed, making Clint reluctantly pull back enough to be heard more clearly.
look. The genius remained pouting, increasingly more grumpy when Peter handed him the shot of cough syrup to down. The billionaire's arms remained crossed as he refused to take the medication. Peter glared at him a moment before remembering.
“You are spoiled in one thing, though. If I’m being honest,” she said a little more seriously while the three guys looked confused at her. “You’re spoiled in hugs!” she said with a laugh before hugging him tightly and swinging them around. The boy giggled in response before Steve eventually asked them not to get too dizzy spinning.
“I didn’t,” she said as she slowly extracted herself from the comfy bed. “It just…didn’t work out with them. So I came back and found Tony passed out.” She started walking towards the door, stopping to say what she needed to to Steve, who was now fully clothed near the bed and had a scowl on his face.
“Hi, Leo,” he said, smiling when Leo offered a small wave back. They stayed silent like that for another moment before his girl spoke up.
Tony spoke first. “Hey kiddo, Steve told me what’s going on. And much to my frustration, I’m apparently not allowed to suit up and take care of this personally – he added a sideways glance to his husband, which made a small smile appear on Emerson’s face – so why don’t we focus on the here and now and how we can help, okay?” She took a moment to look at the two men, two superheroes who didn’t owe this waste of space a damn thing, before giving a small nod.
“- why hello there friends!” the Omega greeted loudly, pointedly ignoring his Alpha as Sam and Nat entered their apartment and Clint closed the door behind them. Steve’s momentary reprieve ended, however, when Natasha suddenly inhaled deeply and scanned the room, eyes landing on Steve.
“I thought you said you wanted a fair fight,” Joey tried, fists clenching and beginning to raise. She stole a look at Cara, who was hanging slightly back…but not making any move to stop what was about to happen.
One that almost inspired him to skip out on the massage in favor of having some afternoon delight with his mate. But alas, the two had to enjoy relaxing massages for an hour until he could see his pup again.
Bucky’s bio father, Carlton Barnes, was an abusive piece of shit who Buck vowed would never meet his granddaughter. When they were little and would spend the weekend with him, back when their mom didn’t know any better, they’d get the shit beat of them.
“What?” Tony snapped, putting a smile on Steve’s face at his husband’s aversion to the vegetable. “You’ve been drugging me and putting kale in my food?!”
“I’m going to start on dinner,” Steve said and made his way to the kitchen with Peter following him.
“I need to pee so badly. I don’t want to move her, but she’s been on my bladder for the last thirty minutes…”
Steve waited until she left and they had settled in the hammock before searching his husband for his hidden pocket, smiling as it seemed to tickle him. He decided to change tactics and focus on digging his fingers into the man’s ribs as they wrestled in the hammock.
He wonders if he should’ve gone to grief counseling for Wade, but shook his head before continuing that thought. Yes, he was Spiderman before Wade died, but he truly felt the role after coming to terms with his first love’s passing.
“Well, then I’m glad. I like her too,” she said sincerely as she watched Morgan push the white stuff around. “She sure likes baths,” she added with a frown.
“Stevie! Get your ass moving I’m taking your brother home before he fights the bartender,” Clint called out as he drugged Bucky alongside him.
“Yeah well, good to see you’re still a hard-headed jackass,” Steve maturely responded, taking both mugs and raising Buck’s as a silent offer to get him another. The brunette shook his head no before slouching a little in his stool. Steve frowned before quickly washing the mugs, thinking about what they were originally talking about. “So, your lack of sleep issue, I have an idea,” Steve said as he wiped his hands on a towel before turning back to his oldest friend. Bucky was just glaring back at him.
Clint was trying to talk to her, fingers on his bow and was staying far enough away to not let her get a hand on him.
“What exactly are we doing up here?” she asked as he gently placed her on her feet. He looked considerably less frustrated then before as he took a step back to start stretching.
“Wrong,” Wade said immediately before leaning against the island and planting a quick kiss on Peter’s lips. “You
“Friends! Now that the children have gone to bed, we must drink in celebration!” Thor bellowed out as he pulled a flask out of nowhere.
Bucky and Clint were going too, which maybe their teasing was why something sat wrong in his stomach. His younger sister Becca was probably going to throw some snide remarks as well, but he was pretty used to the sixteen year old’s sass.
“Just like your Daddy,” the blonde murmured fondly, walking to the cabinets to check what ingredients they had.
“I found… look, I don’t know how to describe it. They didn’t look at me like I’m some disgusting dying animal they feel obligated to take pity on. And they don’t see me as a toy for their own using. Need I remind everyone they are also gay and therefore have no sexual interest in me –”
This will be Leo’s first time meeting his family. Pete had called his Pops the night before to prepare everyone and warn them to behave themselves.
“Fine. For now,” Peter agreed tiredly, holding his hand out when the stupid teen tried to hug him, still incredibly pissed and turning it into finger pointing. “But let me make myself perfectly clear, the second I sense any actual danger, I tell them. But...I agree, I will train you,” he paused to wave his brother’s triumph away before continuing. “This offer will only last...until I feel you’re trained enough to show Dad and Pops. You will come to our house next weekend, Saturday morning to Sunday night. Tell dads you’re going to help us babysit and want to hang out. Which you will do at night, while we train during the day, so at night I can have a date with my husband followed by loud sex you’ll be able to hear from the guest room,” Peter threatened, enjoying both the cheer from his husband and look of horror on his little brother’s face.
to hear your juicy details,” the blonde said in a low voice; his pupils dilated and hiding his blues.
“DUM-E, this is Steve, Steve, DUM-E,” Tony said as he waved a hand between them. Steve stared in wonder a moment longer before reaching a hand out to the claw, chuckling when the curved metal prongs gently curled around his hand in greeting.
“Avengers, assemble.” Clint laughed so hard that she couldn’t help but join him, glad to see Clint so happy with her powers. No one else really asked her about them.
"Good. Now come on, Jarvis' flight should land soon and I promised him we'd pick him up from the airport."
“Out of all of that, I think I’m most offended by him calling Leo a sissy,” Pete said honestly, smiling when his husband threw his hands up in agreement.
“God I love that man,” Clint said with a sigh, leaning his head against his shoulder as Steve realized he was getting a better view of the brunette’s ass. The taller blonde was unable to stop his eyes from rolling.
“Your scent has changed, dear,” Maria said with a quirked brow. “Now, you are a smart young man. I know you wouldn’t jump into something as serious as this without thinking it through. So tell me, why are you bonded to this Alpha?”
Tony returned the smile, leaning down to whisper in his ear “how does that sound, big guy?” A moan escaped the blonde’s lips before he brought his hands up to give Tony the filthiest kiss he could come up with.
She clutched her stomach in pain, determined to keep checking the kitchen rather than ask her fathers for help.
“Yeah, she’s great. You, on the other hand, can kindly fuck off,” Clint said as he held up both hands to flick him off, and again almost falling off the bed. Buck grabbed him around his waist and easily lifted the teen back onto the bed, in the middle away from the edge.
But he found him a moment later, when the sneaky bastard grabbed his butt from behind. He yelped as he turned around, the love of his life finally resurfacing.
"Maybe when I get discharged, but I'm pretty sure you owe me dinner first," Clint - that beautiful sassy little shit snarked, earning him another deep kiss. They were kissing for another few seconds when they suddenly heard cheers. And sure enough, watching them through the glass from the hallway, was Natasha and Daciana.
When she was ten, she remembers asking her Dad where the rest of her family was. He was confused by the question, glancing at her in the rearview mirror as he drove her home from school one day.
“I have a fucking grandmother?!” she demanded at Steve, who simply set his pad of paper aside at her outburst. Tony, still confused, looked back and forth between the two as Steve took a breath to answer.
