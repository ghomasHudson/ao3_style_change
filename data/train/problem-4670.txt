in the tent.“You're not scared that... uh, you never doubt... us? That this won't work, that we'll – ?”
“A what now? An astral dorp?” Dean grabs another bite of his sandwich. “Sounds like every hippie I've ever met.”
“Oh, I'm fine.” He grabs the pillow, swings his arm back and tosses it with such force that Dean almost gets knocked out of bed. He's already reaching for Dean's pillow. “Take all the pillows!”
Three hours after arriving in KC, Dean was ready to tear his hair out. As it turns out, there’s no gift that says thank you for saving my life more times that I count.
Dean looks at Castiel, king of Vondar. No one should look that good while waving a fake sword around.
As they continue walking, Cas points out all the wildflowers and how they benefit the wildlife, especially the bees. He lists their medical properties and names those that are edible.
That incessant pounding has diminished in Dean's mind by utter shock as Cas says there's a way – and Dean welcomes a way to defeat this terminator of death – and then proceeds to tell Dean that he made a deal.
have me.” He stilled and got off of Cas. “I need to lay down. Or puke. I'm not sure. I think I might have two bumps now.”
“By the way, whenever you get tired of my brother, we have a spare room. We won't make you jog either.”
It's a physical sensation. The hair on Dean's arms stand up and there's a tingly feeling between his shoulder blades. Adrenaline flares suddenly, courses through his veins. As Dean runs away from Cas, he knows with the beating certainty of his heart, that Cas will always follow.
food–” Dean holds his hands up in defense when he sees the look Cas gives him, “– not that we'll eat them, because
They slammed their bodies together, and whereas the kissing had started slow, now slow seemed not enough to convey the magnitude of their feelings.
There's a hint of something in Castiel's eyes. “Yes, I have some errands to do. I left the library in Crowley's very capable hands.”
There was a flash of annoyance across Cas' face, but then he smoothed it out and put on his lecturing  Professor-Know-It-All-face instead. Dean would never confess that he kind of
“Shut up.” Dean sits up in the bed. “You don't understand. If I'm hungry and don't eat, my stomach will growl and then I can't sleep.”
Trailing his fingers over Cas' shoulder anchors Dean. Every second that passes with Dean caressing Cas solidifies the realness of him. That he's here, present in this moment. That Dean has him.
“Who am I to stand in the way of the most epic love story of all time? But if I hear you messing with the balance of the universe again, I'll have your hide.” She turned to walk away.
After a couple of attempts at reaching the top of it he scowled, admitted defeat, and dragged a chair over to climb on. Plopping the angel right on the pinnacle of the tree, he hummed thoughtfully, watching it spin around.
“What I'm afraid of? People that enjoy camping. And permanent back injuries.” Dean groans and turns to his side.
There's a gentle prodding between his ass cheeks and Dean tenses. He pulls at his wrists and the tentacles that were clamped down ease up.
Dean had turned that split-second elation into confusion and then painful horror because Dean knew. The ones he loved always got hurt, he always made them bleed dry. And they always left. Those months after Cas had died had been the worst of his life and Dean had had enough worst moments to fill a life five times over.
He sucks gently at first and Dean loves how Ion rakes his fingers down his sides. He arches his hips up, wanting more.
That seems to be it because Cas lets out a harsh groan as he comes and the sound is all Dean needs. He comes hard, gritting his teeth and grabs a hold of the table with one hand.
Suddenly the door bursts open and Sam enters, gun raised with a serious expression on his face. It crumples quickly, and then Sam exclaims.”Seriously guys? No, no, no. I haven't even had breakfast yet.” He turns away from them.
dry. “Alright, Mr. Plant. I'll give you some love. It seems like you need to recharge. Let's take you to the power plant.” He grins and turns around, looking to see if Cas heard his amazing joke. Power plant. He's so funny. Cas is already occupied with the budding garden. Budding. Man, he's on a roll and no one's there to witness his comedic genius.
Tearing his gaze from Castiel, Dean looks at Sarah waving in the distance. She's probably wanting to make sure everything is alright. He waves back. Dean's perfect. He's fucking peachy.
It takes every ounce of willpower Dean has not to do just that when he feels the warmth of Cas' tongue against his hole.
Dean shakes his head and baits the angle. “Nah, staked out the area while on a walk with Cas, but haven't tried fishing yet.”
Dean huffs and steps under the water and sighs. The water isn't scalding but it's still hot enough. “This feels so good. Do we have to go to the farmer's market today? Let's just say here and turn into shrivel old prunes.”
Dean and Cas visit the Bunker for a game night with Sam and Jack. But tempers flare after Dean accuses Cas of cheating and tempers turn even hotter as the evening lingers on.
Dean practically bounced out of the store, a wave of joy overtaking him. He’d found it. He’d found the perfect present for Cas and Dean absolutely couldn’t wait to give it to him. As Dean walked back to the Impala, snowflakes began to fall and he couldn’t help whistling a happy Christmas tune. Looking up at the sky, he smiled, his heart full and light.
Exhaling, Dean feels lighter. This thing has been eating at him but he's relieved that it's all out. Cas is right. He has Cas and he'll train his Winchester-stubborn mind to accept that fact. “And how will you remind me of that?”
Dean frowns. “Just 'mm?' Gimme that.” He breaks off a piece and chews. “Wow, mm. Really lemony and soft and still a tad warm. This is fucking perfect, Cas. Worthy of at least a 'fuck, that's so good.”
Cas is too slow. Dean comes over, grabs his hands. “You ready? And stop with the grumpiness, you'll love this.”
Slowly, his belly starts to distend as Cas empties more eggs inside him. It's an unfamiliar feeling but one that Dean quickly adopts too. Cas keeps pumping him full of his eggs until his stomach bulges. A tentacle caresses his stomach, lovingly and Dean comes again, come running down his legs and cock.
Nodding, Dean grabs the knife and puts it in his back pocket while he flips the floorboards over. Reaching for the knife again, he flicks it open and starts carving the demon trap. The circle and star are straightforward but the sigils are kind of a hassle. He hears a hammering sound and looks up but can't see Cas. After what feels like forever, Dean's finished.
When the butter is melted, Dean sticks a finger into the pan, checking the temperature. “Lukewarm, then we know it's good. Stick your finger in there, and feel. It feels good right, not too hot and not too cold.”
A man about Cas’s height walked past Dean, decked out in a black three piece suit. He turned and saw Dean sitting there with his frap and gave him a warm, friendly smile. Dean felt his cheeks heat and he stared down at his drink.
Dean places his hand on his heart and inhales sharply. “Only because you're my husband will I forget that you said 'only' and 'Baby' in the same sentence. But you're right, we can't afford to chance Baby getting damaged. Her leather seats ripped up, the paint scratched... Nope. We're renting a truck.”
Gabriel didn’t dwell on the fact that, despite his careful rest and recovery, he wasn’t back to full power. Snapping things up from nothing still wasn’t quite as simple as it used to be, but oh well, he could rest tomorrow. He was here for fun, not realism.
The path to love is anything but straight. Dean of all people knows that. He has stumbled, and fallen and rejected the path ahead of him. Disorder marries with free will for what is free will if not chaos and the random embraced?
Dean kissed his husband. “As long as we don't play Scrabble, Domino or any kind of game for a while you can have all the reins you want, Cas.”
With every bump underneath Baby, Dean groans and he feels nothing but relief as he kills the engine in front of the house. “Next time, we're covering everything up with a tarp, before putting it in Baby!”
Dean didn't always enjoy the adventures life had thrown at him, but with Cas, Sam, and Eileen around, he gladly took the string free ups and downs in stride.
“I think so.” He leans in and his lips are at the shell of Dean's ear. “No one can see you.” His hand goes higher up and wraps around Dean's throat as he pushes a thigh in between Dean's legs. “And no one can see me. I could turn you around, pull down your pants and enter you in one quick move. Does that excite you? Being fucked in the dark, people all around you and you want to say something, you want to go away but it feels so good to have a cock in your ass so you just stay.”
“Uh, no. Just having a hard time coming up with a gift for someone I care about. I bought a couple of things but neither one seems right.”
Cas looked up with a curious look on his face and cleared his throat. “That's good. Just..“ He stood up again and placed a finger on Dean's chin, – “move this here and up,” – and slowly angled Dean's face so it was just right. “Perfect. You're perfect.”
Most times he grabs something at the cafeteria but Cas insisted on making him his lunch today. Dean pulls out the bento box and opens all the little containers. It's like food Christmas. Fried noodles, crispy pork, some soybeans, sliced carrot and a little chocolate bar. Digging, he moans as the flavors hit him. Cas sure can cook and it beats the cafeteria food by a mile. He wonders what he has to do to get Cas to make him more bento boxes. As he lifts out the little chocolate bar he spots another note from Cas.
Dean nods dimly and pats his stomach. It bulges slightly by the sheer amount of come inside. Fucking hell.
Surveying the room slowly, Gabriel took in the miles of garland, herds of ornamental reindeer and inflatable Santas that occupied every inch of the bunker’s main communal space.
The old man fumbled with a massive keyring until he found the correct key and unlocked the case. His gnarled hand closed around the black velvet box as he pulled it from the display. “Well,” he said, lifting it close to his face. “This is a boring little scrap of gold.”
A cool hand on his ass startles him but soon Dean relaxes under its careful ministrations. “I'm here, Dean. You have been very good. We're soon finished.”
Castiel nods and grabs the canister with gasoline. He places his hand on Dean's shoulder. The world shimmers. They're in the janitor's room at the north wing.
Dean tries, he really tries–but he's in the middle of an epiphany, that a damn priest is giving him the best fuck in his life–and if that's not something to be vocal about he doesn't know what is.
Castiel adjusts his glasses and smirks. “Let's find out.” He opens a bottle of lube and squirts some on his finger.
He touched Cas' chin and when Cas didn't say anything, Dean cupped his cheek. “Is it alright if I... if I kiss you?”
Suddenly looking uncertain, Cas is quiet for a few seconds. “I've never driven a truck this size before. “
Cas touches his cheek lovingly. “You're a sight to behold, Dean.” He pushes his cock past Dean's lips.
“I'ma go unpack. You keep an eye on the chickens and then I guess we'll have to drive again and buy a chicken coop. And food.”
“What are you afraid of? Nature, fresh air, bird song. I'd say these are all things that are beneficial.”
Dean tosses Cas another rope. “Alright, you got your wood ready?” They will slide it under the door, preventing the changelings from escaping. “Yes.”
Dean winks. “Kinda like you.” He grabs Cas' hand over the table and laces their fingers briefly. “How am I doing? Are you feeling wooed yet?”
Shaking his head, Dean sits down too, leaning his back on the door frame. “Nah, not my usual brand of nightmares, these are... different. And, uh, it's not just when I'm asleep. It's not really dreams though...”
Cas' eyes on him shine with lust and want. He wipes some of the saliva away and rakes his fingers down Dean's sweaty back as he moves behind Dean.
Dean gets up and the shrubbery rises with him, grows until it's a shield covering him. He reaches for his gun but his fingers grab air. “What the hell?”
Maybe it's in how Castiel whispers the words, maybe it's the cassock Castiel's wearing, maybe it's the crucifix around his neck that presses against Dean's naked chest, or maybe it's just the fact that Castiel wears his dominance as a cloak around himself.
hasn't abated but the prospect of being done soon – and how much it means to Cas – keeps Dean going. When he finally puts down his shovel, his back is aching and his skin is sticky with sweat. He wipes some from his brow and looks at Cas as he picks up a water bottle.
Dean turns to Eileen and hugs her. “You keep him in line, alright? His head is so high up, he needs someone to help coordinate his feet.”
Smiling, Dean grabbed a pair of pants, pulled a sweater over his head and hurriedly put on his shoes before climbing out of the window.
again and again, and his nipples are being sucked on and Cas strokes his sides, so lovingly and that's it. Pleasure coils deep inside his pit, needing release and Dean goes taut as a bow as come shots out of him.
Dean moans but it turns into a scream when the cane whirls in the air, hitting Dean's soft arch again.
Even before the strike at midnight, fireworks were going off in all the colors of the rainbows. Some looked like dotted streaks, others like explosions of tiny stars, some were twisty, others went straight up, only to fall to the ground as quickly while turning from purple to pink.
Castiel chuckled and ignored the protest. Instead, he continued his trail of kisses down Dean's chest as his hands followed, stroking and caressing.
Turning around, Dean took the glass of water Cas offered. He took a sip but it didn't help much against the dryness in his throat.
I had soo much fun writing this, both the 'Dean being an idiot part' lol and the kinky stuff. I love how this came out and hope you do too! <3
Dean narrows his eyes. “Look, if you don't start making sense soon, I don't care how good-looking you are – you've chosen a pretty face – I'll start cutting first, and asking questions later.”
The library is not as it used to be. Books are scattered on the floor and table, fighting Men of Letters files and crystals for space. The walls are littered with Enochian symbols, markings in Latin, and a dozen other languages. It's nothing, Dean thinks vehemently, the sudden spike of anger invigorating him.
Dean motions for Cas to back out and as he gets out of the coop, Dean notices it in how Cas stands too – the happiness. Before, he always seemed guarded, a true shield, but now he's more relaxed, at ease. It was not something that was noticeable before but now when Dean sees the difference in Cas, he's amazed that he didn't see it sooner.
Cas's eyes were blazing neon blue in the most supreme expression of irritation and panic that Dean had ever seen. He didn't know whether he should slap the shit out of him like some hysterical southern belle or get on his knees and beg forgiveness.
Lorp, because of course it's Lorp, has wandered off and Dean follows her as she happily struts into the shrubbery.
“Yeah, that's what I'm doing,” Castiel grits out as he comes again. He slips out of Dean and gets out of the bed.
“Where are you going?” Cas had no business looking that good just waking up. His hair was in a disarray and his right cheek had markings from the pillow wrinkles and he looked perfect.
“Now pour the flour blend into the bowl with the butter and whisk. Oh and grate some lemon zest, I'd say from three lemons and blend it in. Three is the max I'd say, we don't want the sponge cake to be too sour.”
Dean lets out a startled moan that turns into a cry as Castiel pulls out, only to move against him again. Each thrust sends pleasure throughout him but is also a painful reminder of Castiel's earlier ministrations. His ass and thighs hurt, red welts probably mar his skin but Castiel pays them or Dean's cries no heed.
Soon, Lorp vanishes behind a dark mass of oily, bubbly black but Dean can't move. The damn foot is still there, caging him in.
They all turn to face the door as Jack enters the Dean Cave with a smile on his face, holding a bowl of popcorn. “I love them, Dean. Thank you! And they're so comfy.”
Dean exhales softly and moves his jaw. He wipes away more saliva and clears his throat. He wants to say yes, but his cock is achingly hard in his pants and the wet spot in the front, tells him what Dean already knows.
The last thing Dean remembers before passing out it is Castiel sitting on the couch, kissing his knuckle
“I'm not the one causing the damn trouble. Castiel has been skipping dimensions, even took a little joyride to Purgaytory a while back. Pur
Noticing the glares and stares, Cas raised an eyebrow. “Anything on your mind, Dean?” That slight smirk he flashed Dean, told him that Cas knew exactly what he was doing. Well, so did Dean. Just watch me, Cas, we are two who can play this game.
Castiel stood in the middle, like a jagged cliff unperturbed by the wild, crashing waves of the sea. Then he arched an eyebrow, a smile tugging on his lips and he turned around. The crowd parted as one, and Castiel walked away towards one of the back rooms of the house. He seemed not in the slightest worried that Dean wouldn't follow him.
They have settled now, and Lorp even bends her neck and pushes her beaked face into the crevice of Dean's elbow. Henley cuddles close to Lorp and they both still.
As Cas pulled out to thrust in again, the thunder crackled. In the brief silence between the booming that filled the bedroom, Dean thought he heard a noise,  forceful knocks on wood, and then
Dean didn't even look to see what it was, he just took the pills. Swallowing again, he bit his lip as he stared at Cas. Cas
“I don't know if the cool kids will call this clubbing. We're just gonna go to a bar and have some drinks. I think the cool kids are into... I don't know... is TikTok cool?”
Dean nods but the warning in Castiel's eyes is enough. “Yes, Father.” His voice sounds hoarse, needy. Sudden shame colors his cheeks.
Dean's cheerful mood sours. He's known his brother long enough to know where this conversation is headed so he cuts his brother off. “Enough with all this floss-ophy.”
After claiming the beds they ordered weeks ago, Dean strolls over to a section in the store where he saw solid pieces of wood together with planks and some odd bits and pieces earlier. He caresses a large piece of wood–after some sandpapering and polishing up–it will be a badass counter top in the kitchen.
“He might be pretty as one, Ion, but Dean's no porcelain doll. You can go ahead and really fuck his ass. Isn't that what you want, Dean?” Cas bends down and pushes his thumb inside Dean's mouth. “To feel his big cock inside you? To be impaled?” Dean nods as Cas continues to whisper sweet promises to him. “You want to just give in as he pulls every last gasp and moan you have from you? No mercy at all.” He pushes Dean's tongue down. “Isn't that
Cas pushes Dean down on the bed and Dean moans. Cas quirks an eyebrow. “I haven't really done anything yet,” he murmurs.
As Dean kneels, he listens to Castiel go about the room. He hears the sound of a chair scraping on the floor and a drawer opening. He knows Castiel won't be long because Dean didn't get a pillow for his knees.
After a few minutes of walking, Dean stops. He doesn't want to go too far away from Cas and the cottage, so he sets his sights on an oak tree with a huge trunk growing a few steps from the main road. Cursing at tiny branches that rasp his skin, Dean settles down with his back against the large oak, still clutching the chickens.
Dotting the last corner with gray, Dean grabs the roller. If someone had told him a decade ago – hell, even one year ago – that Dean would be painting the walls in his own house instead of painting sigils in the bunker. He'd think they'd be full of shit. Not to speak of Cas being his damn husband.
Gabriel had a bit of a thing for Christmas. It was a party, first of all, but he’d also been rather instrumental in the first one, and he did like to hear people sing songs about him. He was pleased with the way the celebration had evolved over the years, though if he was honest, he did kinda miss the raw, unfettered rowdiness of the pagan traditions that had preceded it.
Cas grinned as he rested his head on Dean's chest. “I was still. Just tried to maintain equilibrium with regards to your previous order. “
He thinks Castiel is close now; his breathing is labored. “You've dreamed about this?” Castiel places a hand on his throat and pushes down. “What this in your dreams too?”
Cas narrows his eyes. “I have to say, despite being human for months, some things are still puzzling.” His voice turns softer. ”I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, Dean, if that's what this is about.”
Castiel licks his lips and smiles. “If I didn't know any better, I'd think you've been avoiding me, Dean.”
It's when he's about to open the storage box that he notices the box. Not the second storage box but a wooden box placed on top of the dresser. Dean stops, just because of the sheer surprise of it. He's ready to bet his entire Zeppelin collection that the box hadn't been on that dresser before.
“How would I know that? All you talked about was that yes, you were happy to see me but that was for me, what I could do –
Castiel turns to look at Dean. “Do I have something in my hair again?” He smiles and his eyes are so warm, so loving that Dean's heart aches. “Nah, you don't. You look perfect.”
“Just a little sedative. Your body feels sluggish, hard to control, right? It'll wear off. I didn't want to give you too much. Don't want you dead.” Castiel luckily moved away from his cock, only to splay a hand in his hair. He raked his fingers through the strands. “You're beautiful, you know.” His fingers slid down over his face and Castiel stopped at his mouth.
After a moment, Castiel stops and pulls out. His hand never leaves Dean though, and Dean feels Castiel caress his back in long soothing strokes. “So good for me, Dean.” He motions for Dean to lift his hips for a second, and Dean feels Castiel pull at his cock once, stroke the swollen head before pulling away.
Dean pulls Castiel close. A decade of distance and yearning is enough. The presence of Castiel is temperance, he can feel it in his hunter bones. Going through everything they have – to finally land – in this space should be honored with honesty. He kisses the warm skin on the side of his neck, inhales the scent of Castiel, and trails hungry kisses all the way down to his collarbone.
“All questions will be answered in due time. Or not. Somethings I still can't tell you. But what I can tell you is that you do not disappoint, Dean Winchester. “ Castiel splayed his hand and dragged his fingers from Dean's chest down to his belly button, and further down still.
Dean's mouth curves up into a smile. “Thanks. We eye-balled the bed but I think it'll do. For the both of you. You got some nice blinds, too and look, I even made you a reading nook. I know nerds dig that kind of stuff.”
Ion just grunts and then climbs on top of Dean, straddling him. “Whenever he wants is fine by me but right now, it seems you're all mine. He bends down and kisses Dean once before going lower and catching a nipple in his mouth.
“You're beautiful, Dean.” Cas bends down and caresses Dean's cheek while leaving soft kisses down his jaw.
“Figures. The gods are laughing at me. Instead of a cold beer, I get this.” He gestures at the beast between his legs. “You owe me one after this.” Dean looks down at the ground and tries not to imagine him falling down and breaking his neck.
Finally, Dean is done and he relaxes the hold on Cas' hair that he hasn't even realized he's been holding on to, and Cas pulls off. He readjusts Dean's panties and looks at him, a mischievous smile on his face.
“I see you've grown quite fond of them.” Cas kneels by the door to the coop and watches Dean. To his surprise, there's nothing but sincerity in Cas' voice.
Castiel exhales hard with each thrust and for a brief second, he closes his eyes. There is no respite tough. No, the pressure on his wrists increases slightly and Dean clenches around Cas.
A look of pity ran across the woman’s face. “Maybe we can figure something out. I’ve got some premade pieces we can probably make work, or were you hell bent on bespoke?”
Dean grinds his teeth, and presses his foot harder on the pedal. Everything is good. He has Cas, he knows that Cas loves him back – and holy shit, is that a sobering thought – so why can't he get rid of that niggling fear in his mind?
“I do. I know you have a little brother called Samuel. I know that you finished top of your class. I know you like pie, classic rock music and that you're not a morning person. I know you take your coffee black and that you're allergic to cats.”
“Good.” Pleased that Dean has done as he asked, Castiel adjusts his cassock, seemingly ignoring him. “Turn around. Bend over the prie-dieu and grab hold wherever you can.”
“So I need sleep, sandwich, and shower. Not in that order.” Cas rolls his eyes but Dean pretends not to see it.
Soft breaths escaped Cas, as Dean continued to kiss him. One hand carded through his hair, and gripped tightly, exposing his neck. Cas moaned at the heady mix of pain and pleasure. “I don't know if that wooden implement counts.”
A tentacle slithers up his legs and caresses his thigh before it goes round and Dean stiffens when he feels it probe between his cheeks, pushing at his hole.
Walking over to the bedside table, Dean pulls out a drawer and grabs his mask. “Check this out.” The mask is black with one side covering the face and cogwheels in different sizes adoring the material.”
“What? That was not what I meant and you know it. 'Maintain equilibrium.'” Dean rolled his eyes which earned him a light swat on the cheek.
Dean was the only patron in the little place, so after a quick glance around him, he perused the menu, happy to see all his fave diner options. He ordered a bacon cheeseburger with double onions and extra cheese from the aptly named Marge and when he was done enjoying his burger and gushing about how good it was, she slipped him a piece of pecan pie on the house.
Like a sacrificial animal, Dean is splayed on that stone altar, trembling before the uncaring man, more cold hunter than holy angel. If pain is the vessel of purification, then Dean is a man possessed.
“Tried looking into the mirror?” The bitchface on Sam warms Dean's heart. Some things will never change. “Alright, don't be a stranger.”
Dressed in soft, worn jeans, a black T-shirt and a green flannel –ever the Winchester style – Dean looked the same as he always had. Older but still the same.
“Gods, you feel amazing, Dean, so tight, “ Cas murmured. Dean arched his body up, needing Cas to hit that sensitive spot again. Fuck, he was so close.
“I'm awake.” He looks at the tray loaded with scones cheese, jam, freshly made coffee, yogurt and a cookie. “Is it my birthday or something?”
The heat of shame colors Dean's face but the other Dean's words travel right down his spine as his cock pistons in and out his hole, driving pleasure out of him. “That's why you're so tight around me, you've been saving yourself for Cas' cock.”
Goosebumps move over his body, but his cock is definitely not cold. It juts out proudly and Dean goes to cover himself with his hands.
Dean glances at Castiel, then at the beer. “Uh, nope. That's just for me.” He takes a swipe and puts the beer away. So, first, you crack in the eggs.”
Castiel lets go of Dean and grabs what looks like a small flask made of glass. He holds it in one hand as he does the sign of the cross with the other.
“Ding-dong merrily on hiiiiiigh...” Gabriel yowled victoriously, spinning around in the center of the war room, glitter spraying out from his hands like shiny, irritating, impossible-to-clean-up fairy dust. “In Heaven, the bells are riiiiinging,” he crooned on.
Another tentacle pushes inside his mouth again but Dean's full attention is honed in on the tentacle hovering near his thighs. One tentacle wiggles underneath his boxers and Dean hears the rip as they tear. A rush of cold leaves his cock small and flaccid.
No donkeys were abused in the creation of this chapter. Baby's upholstery however...well Cas knows just how to make it up to Dean😊
"No. Angels don't usually touch each other's wings unless wounded and in need of healing," he murmured, scrolling through more entries on the page.
Sudden rage fills Dean and he tosses the damn book across the library. It lands with a thud on the floor.
He starts fucking Witch Dean's throat in earnest, and Witch Dean eases his hands underneath Dean's T-shirt.
Cas whirled around, his wing knocking Dean over. Dean's ass landed right on the tub of peanut butter cracking it wide open and some of the containers plastic embedded in his ass.
Dean was barely aware of the barn, of the hay bales, of the darkness outside. His entire existence was narrowed down to his own pleasure coiling tight, of Cas' palm bringing fire down on his sensitive skin, of Cas' presence looming over him making him feel small, powerless, and gloriously alive.
Even if the grace bonds are evidently there – Dean can almost feel the power surrounding his wrists, the slight vibration in the air – he still pulls on them.
Dean ducks and crawls around the bed. He yanks away the covers and raises them up like a shield just as Cas tosses the second pillow. Laughing, he gets up and grabs the two pillows, swinging them around in each hand. “What are you gonna do now, Cas? You're unarmed.”
“Such a nice living room, Dean. I love the muted colors,” Eileen says. “It's really cozy.” She touches the gray fabric on the sofa and looks over at the window. She grins suddenly and starts signing rapidly to Sam, who bursts out laughing.
After swirling toothpaste around in his mouth more than doing actual brushing, Dean is ready to fall asleep where he stands. He ambles into bed, pulls the covers over himself, and is sound asleep within seconds.
A thin, slender tentacle eases in too, wiggles its way inside next to Cas' cock and settles inside Dean's ass. Dean clamps around it.
Gabriel chattered away to himself at full speed as he moved over to the Christmas tree, flicking the tiny, metallic instrument he had been fiddling with up into the air. It did a little flip before disappearing. Kazoo tidied back out of sight, Gabriel began poking idly at the pine branches.
“Hell, yeah, the sandwich was great.” He laughs when Cas narrows his eyes. “And the sex was good too, Cas.” Dean pauses. “It's always nice with you...”
Dean is tired, so he and Cas decide to hit the bed early. When Dean wakes up in the middle of the night, he wants Cas.
Trying to take calming breaths Cas reminded himself again that this wasn't Dean. Michael was using everything he could to get a rise out of him. That was the only logical explanation. Steel in his voice, Cas bit out, “We will find a way to save Dean and kill you, Michael.”
Disappointment flashes through him but he obeys. He doesn't want to lose what he already has. Dean's so ready to be filled, to experience something else than pain. The majority of his fantasies involving Castiel have been about fucking, and Dean is eager to experience that for real. He ignores the tiny voice that warns him of such things.
do. He groans as Castiel hits that sweet spot. And the wave of pleasure rises higher and higher and Dean is not sure if the oncoming crash of the wave will drown him or wash him ashore.
He was already done with himself, so instead he leaned over Cas. “Keep your eyes closed until I tell you to open them, got it? And don't roll your eyes at me, I can see it.”
Dean laughs. “At least, for now. There are things straining, just so you know.” He eases down his jeans down to his ankles. The wind blows softly against his naked skin, causing goosebumps to erupt.
fortune cookies. Must be a really handsome devil, that one, that's so generous. He wants his date to get all the luck. And he's thoughtful. Heard he's handsome too.”
“What are you talking about?” Cas didn't remember when his voice had taken on that weary and cautious note.
Cas looked at him as if he was seeing something incomprehensible, like a vamp in a clown-mask. “What...”
Witch Dean drags his tongue at Dean's length before going down on him once more. This time, he picks up the pace and Dean can't help but move his hips.
Dean closes his eyes and opens his mouth, expecting a searing kiss. When nothing happens, his eyes flash open in confusion.
Cas places his hands just right and starts moving his hips. He fucks Dean's mouth fast and it's dirty and loud. Dean feels Cas' cock far in the back of his throat and saliva builds up quickly, threatening to spill out. That's what Cas wants. He slows down just to pull out his cock almost all the way. Saliva runs down Dean's chin, dribbles on his chest and Dean manages to take a big breath before Cas plunges back inside.
With a final spin of the cake stand, the frosting was all done. Dean loved the smooth finish and it looked way better than the last cake. He pulled out a small tube from his pocket. “Now for the finishing touch, some gel. Don't worry Sam, it's the edible kind.” Dean squirted out the orange gel and wrote
Cas breaks off the kiss. “Shouldn't we sleep? It's late and I know you're tired.” He mumbles at the shell of Dean's ear but judging by how his hands dig under Dean's T-shirt, he has no intentions of sleeping either.
He recognizes the feeling of tiredness. His eyes feel heavy and the episode isn't really making sense any longer. It seems he missed some parts. Cas is warm behind him, and he can feel his relaxed breathing as his chest presses against his back. “I'm just gonna take a break and then go to bed,” Dean murmurs and he closes his eyes and relaxes against Cas.
Castiel leans in closer. His breath ghosts over Dean but his next words chill him to the core. “Don't fucking lie to my face again, Dean.”
Sam swoops down next to Dean just as he's about to taste his chocolate milkshake. “So, you thought about my idea?”
He moves his hands alongside the coffin but he's not sure what he's looking for. Splaying his hands against the lid, Dean pushes with all this might but it doesn't budge. He kicks at the bottom of the coffin but he might as well be kicking a damn mountain.
Chancing a look at Cas, hoping that he'll get some clue as to why the cupcake event, all Dean sees is Cas' stupidly handsome face; his blue eyes almost glowing and his lips pulled up into a smile.
Confused, Dean picks up his phone again. “Hello... Cas? Are you okay?” That's when he hears it. Cas is there, breathing and in the background, he can hear the distinct sound of skin against skin.
Goosebumps erupt all over his body as Castiel gently caresses the back of Dean's neck. He cards his fingers in Dean's hair and Dean's sighs against the soft strokes.
Dean looks down at his hand, fiddles with the black titanium wedding ring. Cas is his. And he is Cas'. Exhaling, Dean walks out of the bedroom.
“The top right sigil is a bit crooked and the bottom sigil, that little tail needs to be longer.” Cas points out the errors. “But don't worry, it's nothing that will affect the integrity of the actual trap. You know what's perfect?”
Dean sighs contentedly and flexes his leg. “More like a dying tiger. And my calf was on the verge of cramping just now. But no worries, let me nap and we can do this again.”
Cas' reply was cut short as Dean pressed his other hand on Cas' groin, feeling his hard cock beneath his palm. His blues eyes were hidden, closed briefly as Cas pressed back against Dean's hand, slowly undulating his hips.
Why, the little fucker. Dean tried to count elephants or sheep or whatever that calming technique was. Cas probably knew but he was not gonna ask him and Dean has other ideas for what would calm him down right now. “Of course. Cheating your way to the top, let's quit while you are fucking ahead, why not?
He placed a hand over Dean's stomach, kissing it softly, before speaking. “This stomach is perfect.” He glared at Dean as if daring him to disagree. “It's soft because it has known food and the gift of being full. It moves with deep laughter that only comes from affection, love, and an appetite for love.”
Easing off from his cock, Witch Dean grins. “I know all our best tricks.” He licks at Dean's balls while his hand grabs the head of his cock, spreading out the precome that leaks from Dean's slit.
The bench is not that far away, in fact, it's so close to the window, that when Cas turns towards Dean, he can see the smirk on his face. He arches an eyebrow and then turns again, away from Dean.
“Refreshing.” Dean makes a face. “Snacks aren't supposed to be 'refreshing.' They're supposed to clog your arteries and leave greasy stains on your fingers. Now that's a good snack.”
Witch Dean looks up at him and grins, almost as if he knows what Dean's thinking. Then he opens up and starts sucking on his cock.
Slowly, he drags a finger alongside Dean's cheeks, then pushes against his puckered hole. Dean moves slightly and Castiel looks up at Dean, takes note of any signs that Dean's about to wake up.
Dean watches as Cas opens his fortune cookie, breaks it in two and rolls up the little message. “'The sun is bright, but your future is brighter'. I don't put much stock in a mass produced message but in this case, they are right. With you in my life, us together, my future can't be anything but bright.”
He decides to put them in the back, on the floor. Carefully he puts the carrier down – wedges it between the front car seat and the back, until it can't go further. It's kinda dark but what will they care? They're chickens. To them, it's probably night now.
Castiel hums. “Bingo. Gold star for you.” He keeps his hand at Dean's throat, the knife a silent threat, as he thrusts his hips against Dean. Just a few more and he'll come again. This time Castiel doesn't care about being gentle. He grabs Dean's hip with his left hand, almost with bruising strength and fucks him hard. “Oh, yeah. Such a good boy you are, being so still.”
He doesn't know what the card is or why but he nods towards Jack. “Thanks. It's very... eye-catching.”
The sturdiness of the Bunker had to have deteriorated suddenly because Dean was in the air flying as his feet caught on something. He fell face forward and heard a sickening thud.
Billie grabbed her scythe and pointed it at Jared's chest. “Really? Even when you're faced with your impending doom?”
I had so much fun writing this piece. Selfcest... I think it's one of my favorite things to write. Especially Dean/Dean. <3 Enjoy!
“Color comes in an array of shades, on a spectrum. White is not just white.” Cas pulls up his phone and starts typing. “See?” He hands the phone over to Dean.
His heart is already screaming the answer. Dean takes Cas' hands in his and nods. Of course, he'll marry Cas. Ten times over if he could. He's already smiling.
For fuck's sake. Sighing, Dean crawls out of the sleeping bag, pushes the tent flaps away, and ambles over to the coop. He opens the hatch to the run and then the tiny door to the hen house.
Cas moves his tentacle inside him and Dean can feel it press against his stomach. He comes suddenly, hard and violently. Come spurts up in the air, and Cas is there with his hands, gently rubbing at his cock, which is still hard.
Smiling, Dean moves into Cas' arms and lets out a long sigh. He tells himself that it's because he missed Cas and not that he was afraid Cas would be an illusion. A mirage that would shatter as soon as Dean laid a hand on him.
Sam grins and wraps his arms around Eileen. He kisses her once, then twice and when he's going in for a third kiss, Dean mutters, “Enough, lovebirds. Don't make me lose my appetite. It's Sam, not you, Eileen, you look great.“
They fly down the stairs, running through the kitchen, even as they hear the panicked screams from the mother and father.
He hesitated and glanced at Dean. His blue eyes seemed to hold the world and all its secrets within.
“Yes, I'm sure. Meanwhile, do you want a sample? I've been courteous enough to let Dean breathe for a while. He's been aware.” Michael smirked.
Equally wild and fierce though was Dean's love. And while he'd never considered his love holy – no, he might be the righteous man, but he was never holy – that fire that Castiel had awoken refused to die down. Hope never resided there, hope was the edged blade of pain and suffering, and the scar it left, Dean had worn for over a decade. But a small fire burned nonetheless, and Dean stoked it, fed it his regret, anger, and grief, carefully containing the love he harbored – the love that was the one thing to turn fire into an explosion.
Cas smiled back at him. “I gave Jack the book; he was excited, said he'd start reading it right away.”
It's a plain stone altar but the reredos behind it are anything but plain. Jesus and his entourage are massive as they loom above him, carved in some stone and blinged up with gold inlay. Hues of blue and red can be seen. And Dean only knows that the altarpiece is called a reredos because of that particular night where church knowledge was beaten into him. He wipes his hands on his pants in remembrance, pain ghosting over his palms.
Dean nods but can't help the smile that spreads on his face. “Got it. But I mean... if I knew chickens would make you so happy, we'd have gotten them years ago.” He laughs at Cas' sudden frown. “Let's get inside and unpack.”
Again, Castiel was pressing his cock in between Dean's cheeks and the lube was all the small mercy Dean had. Castiel thrust his hips and entered Dean in one stroke.
As he walks back to place the Pokemon ball back on the table, he trips and drops the ball on the floor. It lands with a loud thud and Dean curses. Sam will have his hide if his precious toys get broken.
Castiel smiles but his voice is hard. “Are we not to stand before God, naked and open? Stand bare to eagerly await His blessing so He can make us whole again?”
Dean grins. “It's snacks! And don't give me that Winchester crap.” His smile grows wider. “You're a Winchester, too.”
Fuck. Dean had never been this horny, this fast. The slaps on his ass, the fact that he was over Cas' knee, the fact that Cas was talking to him like
It feels like Dean is going to burst and his nerve endings are on fire. He's stunned momentarily by pain but then Castiel starts moving slowly and Dean gets busy trying to contain the pleasure that starts building in him. Castiel is hitting his prostate, slowly, teasingly at first but then he increases his speed and the grip on Dean's hips becomes almost bruising.
They were small tasks so Dean had been very surprised when he found out that she had put him in his will and even more surprised when he realized that the house was his.
Walking down the tiny hall, Dean opens the door to the right to what will be their bedroom. The windows are dirty but Dean still sees the lush, green trees through the grime. He dumps the bags in the middle of the room and pauses.
Dean's fingers flash over the screen as he writes. “I dunno, like a list of all the foods you wanna try. So we can keep track.”
Warning him, Dean places a hand on his shoulder. Witch Dean stops sucking and stills instead. Opening his mouth, he glances up at Dean and that's enough. Dean comes with a moan, thick white come landing on Witch Dean's tongue.
Dean grabbed Castiel's hand as they reached the car. “And I want all of you to take off your shoes! No way are you dragging that mud into Baby.”
Grabbing the pile of rainbow-colored bills, Cas started dividing them up neatly. “It's a slug, Dean. And Sam was judge and he didn't object.”
if you stopped making stupid deals.” It feels good to have Cas' hand on himself. It's something tangible and Dean needs it after being so close to losing him again.
Suddenly he feels something bigger press against his hole. He tries to relax. He feels more secretion spill inside him and then what he realizes is an egg is being pushed inside. As his ass swallows one of the eggs, he groans. It feels so good and then he feels another egg coming along.
that. I care for your soul. It's tattered, but I'll put you back together, Dean. I will give up a part of my divinity, give you of my
Tacky as hell, maybe, but that was a matter of opinion, Gabriel thought. With a smile that was fonder than he’d care to admit, he decided that the Winchesters, their friends, and his spunky little Nephilim nephew would love it.
“Yeah. Those four hours of sleep... I was just getting by. You trying to wake me after four hours now, I'll murder you. After coffee. That'll never change.”
Dean doesn't mention that Castiel has cursed several times and that he fails to see the logic of Castiel being allowed to curse, being a priest, and all when Dean can't. He grinds his teeth against the burn a few seconds longer, before answering. “No, Father. I'm sorry.” He hopes the throbbing subsides soon and turns his head to the right.
Another one! =D Hope you enjoy my sweet readers. <3 I've been having the flu or something for the past few days but I'm trying to write something, lol. This is me trying to write shorter fics.
“Yeah, we do.” Dean's voice came out harsh and needy and his cock strained against his underwear and pants.
Cas insists that they supervise the loading of the truck. Dean agrees in theory, but in reality, he's itching to run to Baby.
Cas' lips pull up into a smirk as if he's reading Dean's thoughts. He bends down and pulls the panties to the side, setting Dean's cock free. “There is something about seeing you like this, Dean. In gorgeous lace panties, cock jutting up proudly. So wet for me. You are wet, aren't you?” He pushes down his thumb against the slit and smears precome all over the cockhead.
Kushiel contemplated teleporting to Dean and shoving him in Castiel's arms just so that Castiel would shut up.
Just as Metatron was about to speak, Kadriel heard Castiel's thoughts. Judging by Metatron's and Jael's reaction, they did too.
Somewhere just east of Manhattan, his phone chimed. He glanced at it, quickly reading the simple “get milk” text from Sam. Sighing, he watched the exits and took the one for Manhattan, knowing there was a Walmart in town.
Laughing, Dean shakes his head and gets out of the damn storage room. At least, he knows now that Castiel
Dean takes a step backwards and tosses more cheese on the floor. “That's it. Follow the trail of cheese. Good chickens.” Like Hansel, Dean makes the chickens follow the trail of – well, cheese in this case.
Glancing around his home, nothing was out of order. The books were stacked precisely, there was a pulled pork in the oven, thick carpets were aligned with the walls, blankets folded over the couch; everything was spotless.
Dean grins and opens one eye. Cas looks at him with a smile on his face. He looks absolutely breathtaking. “Shut up.” Dean gets up slightly and kisses him before slumping down on Cas' chest again. “Cas?”
Dean laughed. “I remember that.” He played with Cas' T-shirt. “So after you show me your drawing, maybe I can show you my baguette?”
Dean swallows frantically and hears Castiel groan above him. His eyes burn and tears escape, trailing down his cheeks, but they do nothing to clear Dean's vision. Castiel's cock is something dark, and if it's something holy, then it's a worship Dean pays in pain and tears.
The third strike hits him at the same spot. “You're beautiful like this, Dean. Beautiful in your suffering.”
Closing his eyes, Dean allowed Castiel's soothing words to wash over him and soon he knew of nothing but the warm body of Cas above him and his hard cock inside him. Outside the thunder and the storm raged on, the rain hammering on the roof like bullets loose from a gun.
Cas chuckled slightly, a deep sound that wrapped around Dean like a loving hug. He wanted to close his eyes and drift away on that feeling. “Remove your shirt, Dean.”
Dean grins and grabs Cas' wrists. Cas is strong and it's not easy getting him down but Dean has a little trick up his sleeve. He pulls out his leg and tickles Cas' side with his toes.
Castiel felt Dean's hands in his hair again, urging him on. Again he flattened his tongue, teasing him with a few more strokes before he pushed inside Dean's hole again. He started eating Dean out, reveling in all the sounds he could pull out from Dean and how his body reacted to each movement, each thrust with his tongue. Dean tasted like Heaven and Castiel wanted more.
“You're an idiot!” Dean practically growls. “Do you know what it did to me, watching you die like that? Do you know how it fucking killed me that the last thing I saw was Lucifer's damn knife through your heart and then your lifeless body slumped down to the ground?” Dean swallows against the pain that flares up thinking about that memory. “I watched over your body for fucking hours, not being able to move, and then I carried you to that cabin. I had to wrap your dead body, Cas! I burned you on the pyre! And for a long time I hated Jack, I hated our son because I blamed him for your death. I was a goddamn mess, drinking myself into a stupor to not think about the pain, the regret, about how much I loved you!”
Dean shut his eyes tightly and tried to relax a body that was rigid, anything that could help ease the pain.
Dean sees a tear trail down his cheek. A dozen scenarios flash through his mind but none of them are enough, none of them come even close to trying to explain a scenario where Cas actually cries.
Castiel grips his jaw harder and Dean thinks that he'll break it. He turns his attention back to Castiel.
Cas adjusts his grip, tightening his hold on Dean's hips and backs away from the wall. “No, just Castiel.”
Witch Dean spits on the floor. “Fuck Chuck. No, the asshole has nothing to do with me. Sorry about that though, I can't imagine the... difficulties you'd have to endure under his thumb.”
Cas nods. “I think so. Sure the games are crazy and they're most likely to get killed but at least they have a shot, in the real world, not so much.
“Look, Cas, it's – ” He stops and fiddles with the roller before dropping it on the floor. “I'm... I've been having these dreams.”
Dean's heart stopped beating. It didn't have to mean anything but part of Dean's brain was screaming at him that Cas found him
he was when they found the bunker – it has meant a lot. Dean can see that now. The bunker meant security when he'd experienced just fragments of it when he was a child, and most of that security had come from a tight grip on a gun and salt in his hand. The bunker meant a place that was his own when before all he'd known was seedy hotel rooms and the albeit comforting confines of Baby. And while it hadn't been a place of only happy memories, it had been
It's funny about darkness, how it faced with the bright flames of love, transforms into absence of light, instead of all-consuming nothingess.
Dean pushes the box over to Cas and grabs the remote. “We'll go tomorrow, alright, it's just been a lot at work, I'm tired and I just wanted to hang with you at home.”
He hears a slick sound and realizes that Cas has brought lube with him. Cas sighs and Dean sees how he adjusts himself on the bench. “You should tease your head slowly, Cas, rub a thumb over your slit.”
“Is that something bad, Mr. Winchester?” Cas asks, his voice whiskey deep. He winds his fingers in the hair at Dean's neck and pulls.
Cas chuckles, the bastard. “I'm afraid that's impossible. It can only be subdued for a while. Pain mingled in with pleasure works too.”
They store all the packaged goods out of the way on the wrap-around porch and take a break to drink some beer and water. Dean sits down on the stairs, and sighs content. “This is life, Cas. A beer, the sun, you. The only thing missing are those warm, salted pretzels.”
Cas leans in and pulls at Dean's T-shirt. “Oh. You're quite beautiful, too.” His mouth is on Dean without warning.
“I don't think so.” Cas leans in and kisses Dean's throat, right on his pulse point. He chases his pulse higher until Dean's panting underneath him.
And below those words, written in smaller text, slightly on the side but with the elegant writing that Dean knows as his brother's:
“Sounds good. You be in charge of the growing and I'll be in charge of the pounding... You should see me with a pestle.”
Dean frowns but his small smile betrays him. “Yeah, I guess. But if this thoughtful gift shrivels up or rots away, we – ” He glances at Cas and continues, “It's not like they'll know if it dies. But fine.” Dean mutters as he starts walking back to the cottage.”We'll do our –
Smaller tentacles shot out from Cthulhu with little suckers. They land on Dean's nipples and he gasps as they suck down hard. He closes his eyes as a wave of pleasure erupts in his body and he feels a push against his ass as more of the tentacle goes inside.
He heard Dean's head hit the pillow as he groaned and held up his thighs to give Castiel better access. “Yeah, Cas. Please...”
This, this was ridiculous. Full on, having a meltdown in a Macy’s bathroom over a Christmas present. Why the ever loving hell did this matter so much?
They put together both beds – the one in the guestroom and in their room – while carefully avoiding touching the walls. They do agree to wait before putting the stove in until the paint has fully dried.
Witch Dean pushes Dean and he must've dropped the magic, because Dean stumbles backward, until he bumps the table. “Tick-tock, the clock is ticking. I won't be here for long. Imagine how good it will feel. I'm you. I know what you like. Hey, I'm
Dean opens the church doors slowly, not wanting to disturb anyone that might still be praying. Outside, night shrouds the city but the many lit candles inside the church cast a warm and welcoming glow, trying hard to banish the darkness.
John looked at the scene in front of him, trying to make sense of it all. A vampire in Heaven didn't make sense though.
Henley clucks and rubs her neck against his leg. “Alright, alright.” Dean grabs Henley under his arm. “You've seen the awesome kitchen, I'll show you the guest room.”
“Fuck. I didn't want to make you cry...” A wave of nausea swept over him but Cas' hands were on his waist, steadying him. “Yeah, I love you.” He smiled and the whole world seemed lighter.
Huh. Maybe Cas would look great in a slick leather jacket. And $300 later, Dean had a slick leather jacket in Cas’s size and another mountain full of doubts--and a weird, sudden, overwhelming urge to cry.
It was muted, but still the thoughts came through to Nuriel. She shook her head. If she had to listen to these intrusive thoughts she was going to find Castiel and plunge a dagger in his heart.
Fucking weird. Maybe Jack's in some kind of Nephilim puberty. He'll have to hit the books tomorrow or maybe ask Cas later if that's even a thing.
The light from the single bulb was dim but they didn't mind. Climbing the ladder, they went to the top loft where many of the hay bales were stored. A window allowed some of the light of the moon to shine down on them but they didn't need it to know themselves or each other.
It feels surreal to call this place home, and even more so to be able to share it with Cas. But no matter that the feeling is foreign, it also feels
Dean feels the muzzle of the gun move, as other Dean trails lazily down his spine. He moves the gun between Dean's cheeks and Dean freezes. He wouldn't pull the trigger but he's not so sure about his other more fucked up version.
“You're not so bad, yourself.” Witch Dean wipes at his face and gets up. He looks at Dean and he notices how his eyes flick to his mouth. “I've always wondered how it would feel like to taste – “
The hair on Dean's arms stands up in attention. He knows that voice. Reaching slowly behind his back, Dean curses when remembers that he doesn't have the gun there.
"Yeah Cas. I'm shitting name brand chunky style out my ass…..no I'm not crapping myself!!! Was gonna use the peanut butter to get the oil out cause all it was doing was spreading."
“Holy fuck!” Dean grabs the side of the table, his knuckles whitening and closes his eyes. He totally gets why Cas looks like he's in seventh heaven when Dean goes down on him.
“Would it kill you to call it a firetruck like a normal person?” Dean presses a hand against his hardon and sighs.
And it's just that. Dean knows Cas never will. He sighs deeply, grabs the bull by the horns and all that jazz. “Alright, you know the movie 'Princess Asuka and the tentacles of – “
“I don't think they'll like me more because I've named them, but at least I know what to shout at them now.”
He knew which room Cas was heading towards and as he arrived the simple wooden door was closed. That irritated Dean, that Cas could read him like an open book. He knew Cas was giving him a choice, or the semblance of a choice anyway. That flimsy door did nothing to hide the allure of him; Dean doubted anything really did.
The morning swoops by in a flurry of meetings, a semi-important call and lots of report writing. Dean picks up his phone and types Cas a quick message.
A hand grabs Dean's chin. “Eyes on me.” Dean looks at Ion. His pupils are wide and Dean bets his heart is beating away like crazy. “You think your pretty face can save you from being this mouthy?”
Phanuel's eyes flitted to Ariel. Their knuckles were white from rubbing. He inhaled more smoke and sighed as calm filled him. By the sound of it, Dean's ass was about to get filled too. He chuckled slightly.
Things are spinning out of control, and the whole conversation feels fucking surreal. Is Cas really saying that he not only loves Dean, but that's he's loved him for god knows how long? “I remember that goddamn church! You said 'I love you, I love all of you.' That meant
The sun caresses Dean and the last traces of ocean water on his skin have transformed to salty residue. With Cas' arm wrapped around his waist, Dean sighs as his mind drifts off.
Turning his head to the side, Dean could see the simple wooden door with the worn knob. When not lingering on Cas, Dean's thoughts seemed slow and sluggish. He tried to hear sounds; he was not quite sure exactly what he was searching for but he knew that he would know when he found it. Dean almost laughed out loud at that; it seemed like such a crappy new age - find - yourself - thing to say. Everyone knew those people were out of their minds.
“I'm a natural,” Dean jokes and moves his hand up and down Cas' cock. With the other, he teases the head, slowly rubbing a thumb over the slit and smearing oil all over.
He sees a variety of costumes, some consist of only a mask and others are more elaborate. A guy walks past him with a simple peacock mask plastered on his face and his date wears a dress in matching peacock colors and a train resembling feathers.
“That wasn't you Dean. It wasn't you.” Cas let go of Dean and quickly grabbed his phone. “I'm just sending a text real quick to Sam. He will want to be here.”
“Dean, I haven't seen you... in a while. Do you want to play Scrabble? Jack is setting up a game.” Even in his human form, Cas was still badass at Scrabble.
“What if I don't want to?” Just as the answer left his lips, Dean felt a wave of shame wash over him, and he wished he could have taken the statement back. Looking down, he noticed his bare stomach, the purple shirt on the floor.
Doing as he was told, Dean’s heart was thundering in his chest. He hadn't seen Cas's wings since the fateful night they'd met and he was terrified, the only thing he remembered was their sheer size. He knew it was coincidence, yet he couldn't help correlating Cas's wing span with how he was packing in the dick department. Both man and angel were heavily endowed, and he was now the lucky sonuvabitch recipient who got to enjoy such blessings. Anyhoo…
Castiel had been in many less than desirable situations, some of them could best be described as embarrassing, especially for a warrior of the Lord but this had to take the prize. Although much had happened since Castiel yanked the righteous man out of Hell – meeting Dean Winchester had altered the trajectory of his life completely – this was a first.
The others had seemed so happy to have their assignments. Dean felt like Scrooge for even being the least bit out of sorts, but how did you compile ten years of wow thank you for saving my life more times than I can count into an appropriate gift? Hell, what even was the appropriate gift for that? "Nut up, Winchester," he chastised himself. "You're thinking too hard."
Dean nods. “Yup.” He glances at the sanding machine and smiles. “Can't wait to try you out, sweetheart.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean places a pan in front of Cas. “Now, pour this in the pan and then we'll bake this baby for about thirty minutes. Three-hundred and fifty Fahrenheit is good. Then, we'll eat!”
Kushiel knelt down in the sand box, took some sand in his hand and allowed it to sift through his fingers. Maybe Castiel was finished now.
Dean perks up but Cas shakes his head no. “Fine, alright. We'll get some shades of white and we can look at some appliances. We need a nice big stove and a new countertop. That one is old and the plastic is cracked. I don't wanna think about all those fucking germs that are all over the place.” He groans. “We need cleaning supplies! A lot of them. Soap, brushes, a bucket... you name it.”
“Fu – Father, yes,” Dean quickly amends and groans again when Castiel twirls his finger. His cock is hard as a rock, leaking and he's about to hump the damn prie-dieu.
Castiel pushes inside forcefully and Dean screams as pain travels from his ass, spreading out like a twisted spiral until his entire body is nothing but agony.
The sight of the belt around Cas' neck, him eagerly pulling to reach every last inch of Dean's cock was too much. Dean's balls tightened, his abdomen constricted, and as he came he pushed forward meeting Cas halfway. Dean moaned as Cas worked his tongue around his head, sucking and trying to swallow down all his come. After a last twitch Dean dropped the belt from his hand and swiftly unbuckled it from Cas' throat before falling back on the bed.
The pad of Castiel's thumb ghosts over Dean's mouth, pressing gently and Dean opens. Castiel pushes inside, exploring his mouth before pressing down on Dean's tongue. It's uncomfortable and Dean doesn't know if he wants to swallow or gag to make the feeling go away.
“Evening, sweetie.” Dean sat at the counter and as an older lady sat a menu in front of him. “Coffee?”
Dean nods and takes his hand. They're big and Castiel has a firm handshake. “Hi, I'm Dean Winchester. I know you're new, I saw your truck, uh the rental a couple of days ago. I live down the street.” He points vaguely to where his house is.
Back in the car, Dean adjusts his mirror and starts Baby up. “You know, Cas. I think I'll tag along on a few more of these sunrise excursions. I'll bring the lace, you bring the coffee.”
Cas chucks some melted butter into the bowl together with evaporated milk. He opens the fridge and places a pie crust on the countertop.
? Now, whose fault is that? It's not like you couldn't have said something earlier either? How the fuck was I supposed to know that you felt that way, that you even could?”
Dean twitches and sighs. He places a hand over his stomach and imagines the little squids. He takes Cas' hand in his. “Uh, how long does this extra potent love mojo work?”
“You're beautiful like this.” Castiel looks down at Dean and places the bread in his mouth. “Swallow.”
Steps forwards. Waves of water rising up to his chest. Dean's breathing was even and calm as the storm raged on around him. Lightning illuminated the ocean for a split-second and Dean could have sworn he saw a man standing there, surrounded by dark waters. Wiping away water from his eyes, all that remained was a flash of blue.
He mumbles against the tentacle in his mouth. “No, no, that's too much.” The tentacle pushes down gently, choking his next protest.
Tension radiated out of Dean, but also an inexplicable sense of relief. He decided not to ponder on that feeling right there, but save it for later introspection. Knowing himself that meant it would likely not be dwelled upon come day.
With each thrust, Cas pulls moans from him. One tentacle wraps around Dean's throat gently, and Dean's nipples are raw. He's sweaty, and overcome. Dean moves, tries to get away – it's too much sensation, too much feeling – but the tentacles around his ankles are like vices, cold and merciless and Cas' cock is deep in his ass.
Dean smirked to himself and snarked, "Nope. But my endless forests have seen your wood leak when highly aroused."
Dean grabs the reins and pulls gently before letting go. He squeezes Princess' with his calves and she moves forward. “Pff, look at this, Cas. I'm a natural.” Princess starts trotting and Dean realizes his hat is loose. Just when he's about to catch it, it tumbles down his shoulder and falls to the ground.
Dean nods once, and then claims Cas' lips in a kiss. His other tentacles join in the embrace. One slides up his legs while another pulls his ankles apart.
“Mm, not yet.” He grabs Dean by the shoulders and turns him so he's having his back pressed up against the wall instead. A hand spears through Dean's hair and tightens just on the right side of pain and Dean moans softly. Ion's lips curve into a smile. “Mm, you like that?”
After some time, his hunger is too damn much. He gets up and looks around the room but all he sees is failure.
Dean decides to check in on the gray chicken in the living room. She's pecking at the floor but upon seeing Dean, she seems to perk up and walks towards him. At least one of them isn't running around like a headless chicken. “Perfect, come here. That's it, follow me.”
Hot come spurts out of his cock, pulling out a muffled scream from him. The Bible pages in his mouth are soggy with saliva and taste bitter.
With each thrust, Cas takes him closer to the brink. A thin sheen of sweat covers Cas' body, his hair is messy and his eyes seem to be on fire. Again and again, Cas' cock finds the right spot and soon Dean is rendered speechless, his words replaced by moans and grunts.
A mild breeze moves through the clearing and it ruffles Dean's hair, finds its way down the back of his Henley. The chill is welcome in the summer heat but Dean is burning up for entirely different reasons. A raging tornado of fire consumes him, leaving his mouth parched and dry. Speechless.
Jack had wanted to barge in and help but had so far listened to reason. Thinking about the conversation Jack had revealed he and Michael had had at Hitomi Plaza, Cas was firm in his decision to keep Michael as far away from Jack as possible.
Dark smoke billows against darker sky and the night is silent, as if holding its breath. Bright fire licks at the windows, up the walls, and as it climbs higher, so does Dean's pulse. His cock fills suddenly, and he's so hard that he can shatter at any second.
passing over Castiel's face before he nods. “Dean it is. And I don't know what's wrong. It won't start.”
“There were barely any kids left at four so I could leave early.” He arches an eyebrow as Cas just stands there. “You're not gonna come and give me a kiss.”
Cas takes his hand and pulls him up. “I think so too. Get dressed and let's go home before people arrive.”
Dean hears Cas and Ion exchange kisses before Ion moves up to the front and spears his fingers through his hair. “Open up. I've missed your mouth.”
Dean gasps as Castiel pushes against his hole. His pulse is already high but as Castiel strokes his taint, teasing him, it ratchets up even higher. Dean lets out a little whine. “Please Sir.”
Dean's pulse hasn't gone down yet, it still hammers away wildly inside him but he grins – the realization makes him giddy and he raises his hand, cupping Cas' cheek. “Cas. You can have me. All of me. I
Dean closed his eyes at Cas' admission, a surge of relief washing over him and then he felt Cas' hands card through his hair as Cas' lips trailed down his neck, leaving small kisses in its wake. There was something in that statement that poked at Dean's attention, but Cas' teeth grazing a nipple made him moan out loud.
“I was looking you straight in the eye when I said 'I love you'. That was for you, the rest was for them.”
Castiel brings the cane down on the arch of Dean's right foot. There's a slight pause, then Dean grunts, almost in surprise. He probably thinks this is it. Castiel canes his foot again. And again.
is divine.” He places his hand on Dean's head and Dean's body tenses, readies itself for pain but Castiel slides his fingers down Dean's cheek and rests there. “You do want to save yourself, don't you Dean?”
Castiel yanks at his hair gently. He kisses Dean's neck, grazing his skin with his teeth. Dean lets out a fucking whimper but instead of making a humiliating remark, Castiel praises him. “Mm, so good for me. I love that you make me know what you like.”
Cas mumbles in his ear as tentacles slither up Dean's chest. Suckers pull at his nipples, hardening them instantly. “I'll buy you a new one.”
Castiel takes a step back as if to appraise him. “Do not cover yourself.” Castiel comes back, encroaches on Dean's space. His thumb moves over Dean's lip slowly as he leans in.
Shrugging, Dean walks into the kitchen, pulls out the plant in its plastic pot and douses it in water. “There. Everyone loves a shower. Back in the pot, you go.” Done with watering the plant, he finds a spot near a window and places it on the ground. “Now you better thrive, Mr. Plant or I'll make salad out of you. I don't need Eileen or Sam to drag me about killing a supposedly Winchester-sturdy plant. You fucking grow or else!”
Castiel groans softly as he enters Dean. The tip of his cock is inside Dean's ass and it feels fucking amazing. He just stands there, absorbing everything. He strokes Dean's sides softly, his fingers ghosting over his skin before he grabs his hips, allows his hands to rest there. He doesn't grip Dean tightly, no. He's soft, gentle, quiet.
They eat the rest of their cake, talking about this and that. They head back to their workstations after twenty minutes.
Cas, who finished taping down the protective papers on the floor, shrugs as Dean walks to stand in the doorframe. “If you think that's for the best. You don't think they'll be upset?”
Up close, he's not only hot but beautiful. Sure, he has dark, disheveled hair, a slight scruff, and lines on his forehead – the guy is probably twenty years older than him – but it's his eyes, an intensive blue – that draws him in. And then he speaks, and it's like a punch of pure desire that goes straight to Dean's gut.
Fuck, Dean bites his lips to stop a snarky reply from leaving his mouth. After a few seconds, he says, “I'd never dream of it, Sir.”
Dean walks up to the run, opens it up, and bangs on the coop door. “I'm not kidding about the plucking. You'll be naked! All bumpy chicken skin and with the sun out, it won't be pretty. You'll be roasting slowly. Don't come crying to me when you turn into a charred crisp!”
Jack turns towards Dean as his leg stops bouncing. His eyes are larger than fucking Bambi's. “We're just at a really exciting part, don't you think?”
Dean's heart shatters. In that single word, he hears years of pain and uncertainty and coating it all is the fear of rejection.
Dean takes in everything and exhales softly as a smile spreads across his face. “The son of a bitch. My shoes and socks are gone.” He digs his toes into the white sand and looks out at the ocean. As the waves break, they scatter the sun's rays causing the waters to shine brightly like polished gemstones.
“Fuck, yeah, that's it. Your mouth is better this way, being of use. Mm, you suck me so good, Dean.”
“To pray is to be honest, Dean. To speak no lies.” Castiel tightens the hand around Dean's throat. “Lies taste bitter on the tongue but what is worse, they corrupt the soul. And you're unclean. In the biblical sense. I see through you.”
Dean's chest is flush with warmth and he's not sure if it's from the fucking or the praise Cas lavishes on him. “It feels pretty amazing. This is better than in my dreams.” He grabs the sheets, just reveling in how Castiel fucks him. His hole is stretched to the limit, his cock is hard and leaking and he's in heaven.
When all of the stalk and roots were up, there was enough of it to reach the phone. Castiel punched his right fist into the earth and dug around. A radish, two potatoes, and four earthworms later – Castiel silently approved of the earthworms, it spoke of good and nutritious soil but he didn't eat them – he found a sizable rock. Grabbing the stalk of beans, he tied it around the rock.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Trust me.” He bends down to double check that the sandpaper has the right grit, thirty, before turning the machine on. It whirls to life and Dean holds it steady. It's like a young bull straining to toss him off, but Dean has the upper hand.
Swallowing does nothing to mitigate the coarseness in his throat, the heaviness that sits there. Tired of hiding pain and heartache, Dean opens the lid on the canister. He rubs a thumb over the polished steel and wets his lips. He should say something.
Dean glares at Henley and Lorp as he grabs some pellets. “You're chickens. I don't need a profound bond with you.”
Dean almost snorts. Clone, a different iteration, a magical sparkle, whatever the hell this other Dean was, he sure is cocky. Nothing like Dean.
Slowly, Castiel moves his hand down to Dean's throat where he stops. His hand stays there like a human clerical collar but the only thing that Dean wants to worship is the man in front of him. A small voice whispers that he doesn't know what this God demands of him in sacrifice but somehow Dean isn't disturbed by the thought.
Cas' hand rubbed the spot where he'd hit Dean and it felt so good. “Shh, it's OK.” His voice turned harder. “You snuck out, Dean.”
Either it's that Cas is so lost in the act, or that he doesn't hear Dean, so he grips Cas' hair carefully and leans down. “Cas, sweetheart, I'ma come soon. You gotta stop.”
A gentle finger on Dean's chin pulled his gaze up to meet Cas' brilliant blue. Dean had no doubt of what he was seeing there. Unbridled joy.
Dean nods softly. “Yeah, how could I forget.” He dispels the worst feelings about those memories – how he was about to lose Jack – and tries to think about the good. “You made me all sentimental, talking like a damn philosopher.” They sit quietly for a few seconds before he adds, “But thank you, Jack,” he squeezes Jack's shoulder, “for everything. And you were right, you know. It's moments like these that matter... and I'm glad that we're able to have more of them.”
Getting up, Dean looked out, only to see Cas, his neighbor, best friend, and... fuck buddy. That was everything they were. Sure, they loved each other as friends. Which friends didn't?
Food. That's it! Dean goes to the kitchen and opens the fridge. He grabs a package of sliced cheese. Do chickens eat cheese? He takes out a slice. They do now.
“Alright, I know something is up, you've been acting weird since you walked in – “ That's when he sees it. There's a vase on the kitchen table and it's practically overflowing with flowers.
She is pretty, Dean will give her that. The coat is golden brown or caramel, Dean has no idea of what the official color is called. Too bad she's built like something out of a nightmare.
“I don't think your descriptions of camping are accurate, Dean... And Sam and Eileen do seem quite fond of camping.”
Now Dean's dick is straining in his pants. He looks around the room and unbuttons his jeans. He unzips quickly and pulls out his hard cock. He traps his phone between his shoulder and ear – he's not putting this on speaker – and grabs his dick, giving it a few, long hard strokes.
“From each other.” Sam moves his finger from Dean to Cas. “And the sound is a warning. That I'm home, inside the Bunker and that you should put your clothes on.”
Dean let out a sound between a cry and a moan. His heart was beating like a thunderous inferno and he wanted more. “I mean, we do like to fuck rough.”
“Pretty good moves for someone petulant, yeah?” Dean whispered, voice smooth. He could see Cas' blue eyes twinkle in amusement, one side of his mouth threatening to go up in that confident smirk Dean both loved and hated, mostly loved if he was to be fair.
Dean licks his lips. The cassock fits Castiel immaculately; the cut accentuates his waist before it flares wider below. The row of black buttons is perfectly straight.
There's a pause. “I... don't know.” He aches to touch Castiel, but he's not sure that would be appropriate. He almost laughs at the thought; he just confessed to thinking about Castiel fucking him, a simple touch would pale in comparison.
Castiel's hand goes lower, down Dean's back, and leaves a trail of fire that seeps through the layers of clothes down to his very skin.
The suddenly harsh tone makes Dean look up but he only sees the side of Castiel's face. “'Thus I will punish the world for its evil. And the wicked for their iniquity. I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud'. Isn't that why you're here, Dean?” Castiel whispers. “To be rid of that prideful streak in your being, to abase yourself in the presence of God?”
Cas shrugs. “To be fair, you have threatened to turn her into a number of dinners since you met, so can you really blame her?”
“Yeah, and that's what we did for the entire fucking day. Asiago batard, caramelized onion batard, multigrain, sourdough, olive oil and thyme, fig, and honey. Batards, batards, batards. I long for simple white bread!”
Dean can't help but smile. “Cas is Cas.” He clears his throat. “I was afraid he'd be different, you know, after the Empty... after he turned human. And sure, he has nightmares, and he drinks ungodly amounts of coffee, and if my morning mood was that of a bear's, his mood is that of a fucking dragon's. Hell,
Eileen looks beautiful but more importantly, she looks happy, even if she's with his moose of a brother.
As they sit down with coffee and cake in hand, Dean is sweating bullets. He wants nothing more than to ask Cas again but that would sound creepy. No one wants to date a creep. So he keeps things neutral.
Cas turned and reached for his phone. He squinted at the screen and shut the alarm off. “Sorry, must've forgotten to remove the alarm yesterday.”
Dean and Cas devour the sandwiches before going back into the cottage to apply the last coat of finish on the wooden floor.
Cas' hands on his hips are an anchor. He won't drift away, he's safe. Darkness is the absence of light and with Cas by his side, Dean will never truly be engulfed by it. Cas is his hope, his light, his love. Right now though, Cas is his frustration.
Dean hears the chickens before he notices the sound of an engine and the smattering of wheels on gravel. “You're lucky Sam and Eileen are here. Otherwise, I'd had to continue with the sampling of the pie. You know, to check that it's good. Can't serve our guests – or me for that matter – rubbish pie.”
They both turned towards Sam as he dropped the lid all over the game board. “Oh, my bad! I guess the game really is over.”
“Amazing, wonderful, hot as fuck?” Cas snuggled up beside him, a hand lazily stroking his chest as he kissed Dean's cheek.
Dean flexes his toes and moves against Castiel's finger. “Please, Father. I want... to be...good, worthy.”
Cas tilts his head slightly and takes a step forward so Dean's back hits the wall. “I could eat you.” His hand splays over Dean's chest. “Cas... I don't think...”
“Alright, step back.” Dean flipped the switch and the whisks started moving. “Ah, man, look at that.”
But now, as he wandered the mall, $1800 poorer, Dean wondered if he’d picked the right gift. The others surely weren’t going to spend $1800 on each other, and probably no one would spend $1800 on him. Dean wondered who had his name. Were they as stressed out as he was?
“The prime of our lives. And you know how long that goes on, Dean? Until we die. Your body is perfect.”
Dean felt the bed dip as Cas sat down next to him. “The shoes I've been wearing I've realized are not that comfortable. Becoming human again has made me aware of different sensations that were simply not there when I was an angel. But I'm taking your shoes off for sleep, not stealing them. Here.”
“I tell you what, I'll fix us some breakfast and you pick a movie, alright? Do you need something, Advil, coffee?
The tears won and Dean buried his face in his hands, sniffling. When the tears finally subsided, he lifted his head again. A handful of toilet paper soaked up his tears. He finally felt stable enough to gather himself and leave the bathroom.
Cas sighed. “I don't need to stand on my toes. Why are you trying to lift me, Dean?” He shook his head. “Never mind. You can't answer that. You're clearly too inebriated to make sense of your thoughts and actions right now.”
A man stood in the door frame, face set in anger. Honestly, he looked like a disgruntled tax accountant from the early nineties – and his trench coat swayed in what could only be described as a sudden storm now raging outside John's house.
Dean thinks back on all the times he smiled at a girl, touched a guy a tad too long, caressed a woman's soft breasts, touched a man's hard cock. Being told that he's good, that he's hot, that's he's pretty.
Cas put a reassuring hand on Dean's shoulder. “It's alright. That was all Michael distorting and twisting events.”
It's not gonna last, Dean thinks for a brief second. He sees Cas swallowing up souls to become God. Cas getting stabbed in the back. Cas, cold and dead on the ground. Cas in that fucking storage room swallowed up by inky black.
His heavy, golden wings twitched involuntarily with anticipation as an idea began to form. He finally turned from the tree, spinning on his heel with a gleam in his eye. Strolling nonchalantly through the bunker, he invited himself into every bedroom, every nook and every cranny, poking around until he found the presents. Some of them were surprising. Some amusing. Almost all of them were thoughtful, personal, or kind. Gabriel wrinkled up his nose.
"I like trying new things, even though we sure as hell haven't gone stale. But if there's something you're curious about, just ask and I promise to keep an open mind."
At first, he knew love as something warm and gentle. The feeling of a safe embrace when nightmares had disturbed his sleep as a child. The taste of hot chocolate and puffy, floating marshmallows. The quiet hum of a nonsense song as he walked next to his mother on a warm summer day.
Lorp and Henley mill about Dean's feet. “Cas, we're shutting the door in ten. I don't want Lorp and Henley cackling or worse, nipping at the walls while we do this.”
It wasn't Mary, she had her own place a mile away and at this hour, he couldn't imagine who else it could be.
“I was once an ancient being of celestial intent. If I want to taste the peanut butter molecules, now that I can actually do it? It's my right as a Winchester.”
That elicited a chuckle from Cas. "That's far more accurate, yes. But this back rub feels good, can you do some deep tissue massage around my shoulder blades?"
Dean gags, unprepared but Castiel doesn't seem to mind. “Relax Dean and take it. To pray is to let go. Don't fight this.” He stops momentarily.
Cas opens the tent flaps and pokes his head out. “What did you say?” He squints against the sunlight and his hair is all over the place. The black pajama shirt looks so good on him and it's not really fair that Cas can be so breathtakingly beautiful while camping in the backyard.
Maybe it was the lingering fire that still simmered underneath his skin, causing him to feel clammy and warm, maybe it was his upper arm that still throbbed with pain or maybe it was the soft feeling of linen against naked skin.
“Oh – um. A while. Nothing to get all worked up about though. A quick walk and I'm down for sleep.” He starts walking back towards the cottage and their tent.
“I think it would be a shame not to see that beautiful fabric and your cock together again, don't you? Me unbuttoning your pants just to touch the fabric, just to feel your hot, warm cock against that soft lace. To whisper promises of what I'll do to you when we come home, to –“
“So prideful. Do you think that I'd touch you?” Castiel's hand leaves him and Dean exhales. He realizes that he's been holding his breath. “Do you think you're worthy to touch me?”
“Hey, come on. I don't mean it literally. I'm not gonna crush your beautiful eggs.” He'll just take them inside and crush them there so he can make an omelet. Not that he's telling them that. He's read that stressed out chickens lay fewer eggs and they don't need that worry in their lives. He has enough worries as it is.
“Deal. We'll take it!” Cas makes a face that Dean decides is him agreeing to go along with Dean's plan. “Now, let's go look at mattresses. I want the best memory foam. Your back will thank you, Cas.”
The water turns to black sludge, filling his throat as he swallows desperately. Soon his entire world turns dark.
“Mm.” What the hell is going on? Dean's gaze flits to Jack. He can't see his face properly but he doesn't miss the way Jack's leg bounces.
A sigh escaped Cas's lips and Dean was maniacally grinning to no one in particular, levitating with glee at this discovery. Maybe not all fans were creepy, ridiculous fan girls and boys. Some obviously had damn fine imaginations and he decided to later pillage this A03 site for more ideas.
Henley starts clucking again and Lorp pitches in like a drunk bassist trying to help the lead singer. With a groan, Dean opens the coop door. “Shh, you girls are gonna wake Cas up, and then I'll really be pissed.”
It's different this time. Castiel proceeds to move his hips again, hits Dean right where it counts. “I should have done this earlier.”
It was supposed to be on terms they both agreed on and not all the damn time like Chuck wanted it. “So I dumped him.”
There was a pause then, so long that Nuriel exhaled softly. She cursed Castiel's longing; it was so loud on Earth and in Heaven, that she had to actively think about blocking out his thoughts and it was exhausting. There was a small blessing in that he was elsewhere right now.
“I put the brewer on as soon as I went into the kitchen. You have a thermos with strong coffee all to yourself. I even prepared a mug for you. Here.” Cas bends down and brings up a thermos mug.
Dean sighed. His brother was always so serious, ruining his fun. “Tone it down, it's not like I bought a bazooka. As for when, a week ago. And how... I ordered it from an amazing place called Amazon, Sam. And I don't mean the hot warrior lady that could crush you between her thighs like a watermelon.”
“Oh, that's it. Don't you all 'sweetheart' me? I don't want your stupid pillow.” He takes Cas' pillow. “And I'm not grumpy!” He was just planning on throwing it gently on Cas, just to make a point but as he hits Cas' face with the pillow, Cas's head swings back.
Cas silences him with a kiss and hoists Dean up, against the wall. When he breaks the kiss, Dean is panting. “I can't wait to be inside you,” Cas growls.
Dean hissed when he felt Cas enter him, but he didn't mind the slight burn. With Castiel he'd take everything; every offering was to be worshiped. Cas' hands caressed his stomach and then he pushed Dean's hands away, grabbing his thighs for leverage.
He walks up towards the altar and even though he's been there many times, he can't help but look up at the ceiling. It's dark as the night outside and together with the glimmering round details, it looks like stars covering the sky. The vaults and pillars seem golden –Dean wouldn't be surprised if it was real gold– and he understands the feeling people have of being overwhelmed when entering. It's by design.
Dean nods, even does a little wave and Castiel winks back. It's adorable, more of an eye closing awkwardly than a real wink but it's cute so Dean hasn't said anything.
Dean stays although his body screams for him to fight, to push away, to claw – anything to relieve the ache in his lungs. When tears blur his vision and his vision turns hazy, Castiel finally relents.
Dean clears his throat. “I don't think I'll survive it every day but... I think it's time I invest in more panties.”
“Ugh!” Shaking his wings and shoulders, Gabriel dislodged some snow that clung greedily to his jacket. In his arms he carried a giant ball of mistletoe, fresh and dewy. He strolled through the bunker from one end to another, festooning every doorway he could find.
You made a vow.” His voice comes out as steel but when Dean turns all he sees is worry painted on Cas' face.
Cas snorted. “Might be, but I don't feel hot as fuck right now.” He rubbed at his eyes. “When did Sam, Eileen, Charlie, and Dorothy leave yesterday?”
Castiel started moving inside Dean and sighed. “Fuck, you feel so good. This is better than I imagined it. You're so beautiful.” He gripped his hip. “All
Cas doesn't reply, but Dean hears some shuffling and then the sound of Cas' hand over his cock sounds clearer.
Taking a brief pause, he looks at Cas who kneels down with his fingers deep into the soil. He looks at peace and so happy that Dean almost feels it as a physical pain that thumps beneath his ribcage. After a short break where he sips some water, Dean starts digging again. Cas is still digging on his end.
Castiel grabbed his chin.“You can make this difficult or easy.” Castiel shrugged. “But judging by your nature, I think you'll go for the first option. I don't mind.” He tightened his hold, almost to the point of pain.
Reaching out and stretching his arms until he felt there was no give left, Castiel managed to just barely reach a beanstalk. He grasped it and pulled at it gently. The joy he felt when the long starchy stalk of the beans slowly came up from the soil was one that was almost unparalleled. Only Dean's spoken words of love had stirred his heart that much.
Dean was in such awe, he forgot that they didn't have any massage oil. But canola should work fine, right?
Dean ran to the other side of the kitchen and grabbed something. “We need to use this!” He smiled as he placed it on the counter.
He clenches his teeth against the pain and the uncomfortable throbbing in his hand. Muttering a curse under his breath, he sinks his fist into the water again. He lets out a curse as the water cools his hand, almost numbing, it but the immediate pain of the burn lessens.
Shaking his head, Dean grins. “Don't worry, I don't plan to stab you... not with a dagger at least.”
the poster-boy for obedience; right now he was a sassy little shit. Sometimes the best thing to do was ignore that kind of behavior. Dean almost laughed out loud. He had learned that lesson himself, the hard way.
Dean starts to move, rutting up against Castiel's leg. His clothed cock seeks the friction and Dean moans. “God, this feels so good. You feel so good, Cas.” Castiel cups Dean's ass and moves, undulating his hips in a way that brings him even closer to his thigh.
Sweat erupted all over Dean's body as his nerve endings turned on fire. He screamed and gripped the bindings hard, his knuckles turning white. He didn't,
Suddenly, everything feels awkward and Dean realizes with mortification what he's been doing just seconds before. “So...” he starts but it doesn't cover the full range of what he's is feeling.
Dean closes his eyes as he lays on the stone floor–among the scattered remnants of failures and heartbreak–and finally falls asleep.
“The things I do because I love him,” Dean mumbles as he grabs a pair of sweatpants. At the last minute, he grabs a hoodie too. Since Cas insists they'll be up predawn – which is basically nighttime anyway – it'll probably be chilly. “I'm ready!” Dean calls.
He felt its twin in the ghostly ache on his shoulder where he'd once been gripped tight, raised from perdition. As Castiel's words sanctified him and baptized him in the
Dean has been a hunter too fucking long to ignore his instincts. And even though the monster hunting is way less intense these days, he still listens to his gut. And his gut is telling him something is up.
Cas nods but touches Dean's shoulder. “You're staring at that tree like it has a personal vendetta against you.”
Castiel's cock feels fucking amazing. It fills Dean so good, and he clenches hard around it. He hears a soft grunt and does it again. The fact that Castiel's careful facade can crack, that it's possible for
Two seconds later, Jared was engulfed, faster than some chaotic guy named Mike could scream 'I will out them!”
After stuffing the freezer full and putting away all the groceries, Dean and Cas place all the boards for the chicken coop on the ground in front of the porch.
He noticed the telltale expression of curiosity spreading across the angel's face as a pop up ad for who-knows-what had likely flashed on the screen.
Dean's smile falters. He looks over at the Chinese takeout, the boxes empty except a sad, soggy egg roll. Sighing, he types back.
“I guess you're right. It would be unfortunate if they got paint on their features. That can't be good.”
Dean has a huge crush on the new guy Castiel but he's pretty sure it's one-sided, even though Charlie keeps pestering him to do something, or rather do *someone*.
Dean wants to move backward, he arches his back and digs his heels to get away – it's too much – but Cas pulls him back in and then he stills for a fraction of a second.
“Like fuck you're gonna beat me,” Dean objects. “You can beat me in the bedroom anytime you want, but games are my domain. I just don't get your obsession with playing Scrabble?”
Witch Dean grins. “Let's say, I'm created from a single entity that also shares some knowledge about your world. Quite a lot, most of the time.”
“It lasts longer. They don't need to mingle with people – why the fuck should I know? It's weird. Who wants to live like Snow white without the added bonus of seven guys?”
“I guess this is a step in the right direction.” Cas puts away the garden gloves. “I don't know about you but I'm hungry.”
Backing away, Dean tried to get a sense of the situation and what was happening but the sound of buttons clattering on the floor brought him back. Then Cas' hands were under his shirt, touching his stomach and each caress sent shivers through him. No one had ever elicited that kind of response from Dean before, male or female but it seemed Cas was in a league of his own.
“Yeah. I see you drink tea all the time and now you're having coffee. I wasn't sure that you drink coffee but I guess it's nice to have both.” He takes a sip of his coffee to stop himself from rambling.
Dean stops and stares at Cas. “What are you doing? This is no time to rest. It's not like this is getting
Dean peels open an eyelid to look around the room. He can tell it's not just dark due to the lights being off, but that it's dark because the world outside is yet not graced with the rays of the sun.
”Fuck, your mouth is indeed sinful.” He grabs Dean's hair. “Don't worry. I'll clean it out, bless you with my holiness. Don't you feel blessed?” Castiel pulls at his hair. Spiky pain travels throughout his body and transforms to pleasure on the way.
“Goodbye, Dean. Love you.” It might have been insensitive to hang up on him, but Dean knew that Castiel was well and Castiel knew that help was imminent. Now all he had to do was wait.
Castiel arches an eyebrow but doesn't say anything. He takes the balloon whisk and starts whisking. Yolk flies.
“I'm a different iteration of you, formed under different circumstances but with the same core. We are the same but on different paths. Imagine a lake, and the moon's light bouncing off the waters. It causes a million tiny sparkles to shine. We're both a different kind of sparkle. But the ultimate source is the moon and – ” Dean stops. “You know what, fuck it. The short version is I know everything you've been going through, fucking sucks, but I'm happy you pulled through and congrats on finally getting Cas.”
Cas ambles to the bedroom, removes his work clothes. Quietly, he crawls into bed, only to be greeted by an arm slung over his chest.
Cas moved under him but Dean stayed put. He wanted to say something profound but he just had to get one thought out of his head that wouldn't leave him. “You know what rhymes with broom?”
“As I was saying, as the Kansas song goes, 'There'll be peace when you are done' and I think we all deserve some peace. Because we're done. Finished. We made it.”
The hair on the back of John's neck rose in warning. There was no mistaking the sharp teeth. A vampire! “Dean...” John warned.
“I could put you back in the coop, but you'll just continue with your chickanery.” Dean laughs for himself. “Get it... chickanery, because you're chickens?” He doesn't get a reply – they're chickens after all, but it sucks that no one is there to witness his awesome joke.
he had for you! How is an angel supposed to handle all that? He clinged to you like a baby chicken imprinting on the creature closest to it.” The other Dean tilts its head and
“I'm right,” Cas replies with certainty, his voice heavy with the solid authority only a former angel can possess.
“And he’s about my height, maybe an inch or two shorter? We’re the same size everywhere except his thighs are way thicker than mine, and his shoulders are a bit broader.” Dean used his hands to gesture the differences to the tailor, who stared at him opened mouthed.
"Oooh. that's quite pleasant..sorry," Cas moaned and apologized as his left wing involuntarily extended, knocking over the lamp from the nightstand.
Dean readily obliged, and the surprising moan from Cas under his skilled fingers has his curiosity insanely piqued.
Lust still burns in Castiel's eyes; it turns his sapphire gaze into something hot and still manages to make Dean squirm. Even when Dean has laid everything before Castiel, it seems there is more to pull forth.
Mildred had left some things around the house. A gray clay pot in the kitchen, some candles in a drawer and in the attic, a dresser, and a chest. It doesn't bother Dean. He got the place for cheap, Mildred had taken a liking to him–told him he reminded her of one of her students–and he had helped her with chores such as mowing the lawn and repairing the fence.
Castiel's hand on his cheek is branding him, but not with divine power. It is a power though, a force of such magnitude that it compels Dean to stay. His answer is a mere whisper.“Yeah, Father.” He notices Castiel's smile and looks down.
There's something holy about the rhythm of sex; how bodies join each other, less concerned with the doing and more tuned into the being. How the heart expands, just as blood vessels do. How pleasure can be found in the soft exploring of freckled skin and strong thighs but how pleasure can also be taken in the unyielding force of a hand between shoulder blades and the fierce thrusting of hips.
“I've had dreams. About you.” Dean licks his lips. Very uh, unholy dreams. Where you...do things. Where you...”
Gabriel knew Castiel and the Nephilim were here somewhere too. He knew their signatures, he could feel them nearby when he allowed his senses to drift out.
Castiel continues to stroke his ass and adds more lube. It feels fucking great but Dean wants more. “It's important to have light and airy motions, Dean. Just a subtle hint of a touch, it's a delicate thing. Wouldn't you agree?”
Cas thumbs at Dean's mouth and pushes a finger inside. Warmth flushes around Dean's tongue and Dean sucks harder. “This is just the beginning.” He slithers a tentacle between Dean's cheeks and pushes at his hole.
Dean's eyes flit to the spot again. The windmill isn't there, it's just a tree reaching with its branches up and out. He wonders briefly if the tree envies the flight of birds, if it, too, desires to roam instead of being anchored down into the soil, unmovable and stuck.
“Please, Cas.” He clenches around Cas' cock, loves the hitched breathing but doesn't love how Cas stills momentarily.
Dean has no question as to who Castiel believes is God. His pulse speeds up, transforms into a distant roar in his ears and he glances up at the statue of Jesus.
Dean's cock is already hardening. Maybe it's because they're in public, maybe it's the way Cas acts, so in control, maybe it's because it feels so damn good.
Suddenly looking serious, Castiel takes Dean's hand. “To me, no matter your perceived physical imperfections, you're still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.”
Dean looks at Cas in confusion but Cas doesn't seem to have any idea either because he's doing the squinty thing with his face where his eyebrows are pulled down – but it's the adorable eyebrow, not the one that gets him all hot and bothered.
Castiel smiled. “The trick is to have lots of candles at home, and drink copious amounts of coffee.”
Dean huffs out a surprised breath. He looks up at Castiel but freezes when Castiel's hands go to one of the tiny buttons on the cassock.
Peter, a buff guy in his thirties with short brown hair and a dimple in his cheek smiles. “You sure? I can–”
“No...I'm opening my-my... uh”, what did the lady say? “My channels.” He crossed his arms. At least he remembered that from the website.
His pulse is still caught up in a frenzy, dancing to the harsh rhythm of his heartbeat when Castiel comes before him. He lifts Dean's chin up and looks at him, with something akin to pride. It warms Dean, makes him feel
“It's stupid really. I mean... this is all I ever wanted. Hell, I barely dared dream this and now it's mine and instead of enjoying it, it feels like I'm walking around on eggshells.”
“Mm. Maybe.” Dean pushes away and pulls at Cas' boxers. “Off with these.” When Cas is naked, Dean finds his cock hard and leaking. He starts stroking and finds a nice rhythm where Cas moves together with his hand, chasing his own release.
Easing out of his jacket, he hung it on the coat rack and worked his shoulders. They cracked loudly – which should've concerned Dean but he figured it was all the work that he'd done earlier; his tension had to settle somewhere. Rather his shoulders than his jaw.
There's a vulnerability to a sleeping person, and in the grip of deep sleep, Dean looks younger and the lines on his face are soft. Maybe there is peace in sleep.
Dean drops his arms back on the altar, only to yelp out in surprise when his arms are pulled. “Fuck!” The pull on his arms is gone in a flash only to be replaced by a harsh tug on his scalp when Castiel yanks his head up.
Dean fell back against the bed and rested his head against the pillow. Swiping a hand over his face, he winced. The damn bump was still there.
Castiel takes a step back. The altar is to his right but all Dean sees is Castiel, the crucifix, the black cassock. “You're already down on your knees. It suits you. You're one of those men that think that your looks will be your saving grace. You use your body like a tool to get what you desire, what you want. Everything you do centers around your mortal body. What about your immortal soul?”
“You're a fucking dentist, Sammy.” Dean grabs the bowl of nuts that he'd pushed to the side and chews on some peanuts. “I'm good. Besides, Mildred gave me good advice.”
Maybe it was that Dean had blown out so much anger at Crowley and his damn bread, maybe it was how the lighting made Cas look ethereal, like a damn hot angel really, or maybe it was that Dean was sick of just thinking about touching Cas, just thinking about claiming his mouth, just thinking about saying how hot he looked; he wanted action.
Ordering seeds. If it was any other person, Dean would've rolled his eyes and made a joke – but this is Cas. He's a nerdy, former angel of the Lord, but he's
Frowning, Dean pours the beef and curry stew over the rice. “You're telling me you've been up since... what three? And work on top of that? What you wanna watch, comedy, horror, drama?”
Finally, Castiel moves on top of him. Dean glances at Cas' eyes, where grace has them shining brightly. He looks the same yet the power that lies as a dormant promise in those eyes makes Dean's heart beat faster.
He hears the voice inside his mind, but he has no doubt whatsoever that it's real, a projection from that thing in front of him. Dean screams.
“Christmas is hard, ain’t it boy?” An old man plunked his bag down on the counter. “Was better when my Liza was still around to do all this shopping bullshit, but I got grandkids I don’t wanna disappoint.” He started washing his hands, glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye. “What’s got you down, sonny?”
Cas' own shirt was discarded and now he stood up again, slow fingers unbuckling the belt on his pants. Dean had to fight the urge to rip the belt from his hands and do the job himself. Exhaling, he unbuttoned his jeans hurriedly and stepped out of his underwear. Cas hadn't even pulled the belt out fully, taking his time to watch Dean's every movement.
Salathiel was one of those, living a quiet suburban life in a small town in Mississippi. Miss me with it, though, but who was they to question the word of God? They didn't understand why they had to be one of the overseers. And it didn't make much sense either way. When the Apocalypse started, not much would be left of humanity anyway.
With his mouth slightly open in ecstasy and fingers digging into his soft thigh to the point of pain, Cas seems to be in Heaven and he's adamant to take Dean there too.
Dean looks at them both. “What the hell?” He nods towards Cas. “Let's go, Cas. And next time, be fucking louder, Sammy. To be clear, we're going to our room now.”
. He still wants more but he remembers Castiel's earlier words about being prideful. His cock is still hard, painfully so.
Ion nods. “Yeah, well, you're not too bad looking either.” His eyes look up to catch Dean's and his smile grows bigger. “You're hot too.”
Turning to Cole, Dean pats his cheek. “It's been too long, buddy.” He pulls out his knife, stabbing Cole in the gut.
Cas leans in and kisses Dean softly. “Then I'll wear it. Hurry up now. The beans, sprouts and marshmallow cookies are waiting.”
Dean wakes suddenly. The covers are being pulled away from him and his initial reaction to get the fuck away from whatever is happening is hampered.
Cas glared at him. “You should follow directives. You're drunk, Dean. You're in no position to be flinging yourself off beds. Now, if I was an angel I could've healed you,” Cas spoke quieter, “but I'm not. Not anymore. So stay in bed and sleep this off. I know it's been – rough these past days, with... your visit to the Empty, so go to bed. You'll feel much better in the morning.”
He could hear Cas flip a cap open as he moved to give Cas space. Soon, Cas was against him again, pressing small kisses on his back.
Cas does a mock pout with his lips and eases a finger between the jeans and the soft lace panties. “So this isn't an invitation, Dean?” He presses down on Dean's growing erection again.
Salt and fire, a hunter's bread and butter. Salt to purify, salt to keep the ghosts away, salt to die by. And now, salt to live for.
Dean sighs and enjoys the cold a tad longer before he grabs the small cabbage head they bought. Cas was planning on making some kind of wok later on but Dean figures they'll have time to take a grocery trip before that.
Even after two years, Dean's body still erupted in flames. Suddenly, he thought about his dad being home and his desire faded. John had been increasingly suspicious about Cas. Not that he knew that they were... fuck buddies. Dean didn't think John would mind if Dean
Noticing the worried look on Cas' face, Dean reassures him, “Nah, don't worry. That will fade as it dries.”
He felt the blunt head of Castiel's cock between his cheeks and dug his heels in. He tried sliding back, away from Castiel but the bindings and bed only allowed him to go so far.
He can feel the soft fabric of the cassock rub against his legs but it's the vortex of pain and pleasure, precariously balanced that threatens to undo Dean. It feels so good to be under like this–Dean's been tempted by Castiel for so long–but he's in a damn church and God, his host and their cousins are watching–and it should feel bad.
Dean removed his arm from Cas' throat only to replace it with his hand, fingers gripping tightly. “I have some ideas.” His lips covered Cas' mouth, tongue demanding entrance. Their kiss was hot, bruising and wild and Dean smiled inwardly as he noticed Cas' breathing become more erratic. Dean managed to tear himself of Cas, his fingers going down to unbuckle Cas' belt and pull down the zipper.
Lorp's cooing increases, Dean recognizes her slightly higher cluck that ends on a low note, making it sound like she's asking a question. “Lorp, you're not coming with.”
for more. Castiel grabbed Dean's cock, his fingers stroking the hard member as he continued to lick and tease at Dean's taint.
Dean blinked slowly, as he came to. The entire world was swaying back and forth and as Dean squinted he was pretty sure he saw the floor and Castiel's shoulder.
The sun is out but the heat is comfortable. It's one of soft rays warming your back more than sweat dripping down your neck, but Dean is already sweating which is ridiculous. It's not like this is an airplane.
“Smartass,” Dean mumbles. He digs into his jeans and pulls out a half-eaten granola bar. “Here you go, some food.” He pulls off small bites and extends his open palm only to retract it in the last second. They'll probably peck his hand off.
Bile rises in his throat. His stomach churns, stirring acidic bubbles. Dean turns to the side and pukes violently. The acidic taste coats his tongue and drying his burning eyes, Dean drinks again to wash away the foul taste.
Clearing his throat, Cas lowers his voice, as if telling a secret. “I only wear an apron because Dean insists it's the correct attire to wear while cooking.”
A wind blows, ruffling Dean's hair. As it sighs past him, it takes away some of his hesitancy. He owes this to Cas. He doesn't linger on the gentle thought that he owes himself this too.
Cas' voice comes to him like from a dream. The only thing grounding him is Cas' arm slung over his chest–like he wants to protect him even now–because if Cas' continues to stroke him like this, he'll definitely fall asleep.
“Sleep.” Cas slowly eased him down on the bed. “I think you need to sleep. That's the usual remedy. You can also drink some – “
Dean gathers the dust into tiny piles and when Cas is done, Dean vacuums it all up. He also vacuums the floor again for good measure.
The dense canopy shields the light of the moon, and there are treacherous roots threatening to trip Dean over so he threads carefully. He doesn't want to break a leg, nor crush Lorp and Henley.
Dean feels a brief flash of panic and steels himself for the same fate when the Empty just vanishes.
Just then, Dean moves and Castiel moves with him, his thumbs still under the waistband. As Dean settles again, Castiel pulls the underwear down to his thighs. He waits there for a few seconds, maybe even a minute.
Dean knows that voice. Even if it didn't go straight to his gut, he'd know that voice anywhere. He turns to face Cas.
“Yes. And that fire I saw in your eyes, it has never diminished. I love your eyes for how you see the world through them, Dean. You're passionate and driven and you've never stopped seeing the beauty in the world and in others. When you look at them, you pull something forth, something deep within them that makes them strive to be better. Not for your sake, but for their own.”
“Yeah, I know you like that on your avocado sandwich.” Dean took a bite of his egg and bacon sandwich. “Also, I heard it's good against hangovers.”
He felt discomfort. It was a cloak that covered his body, as if it was on the verge of shivering but didn't quite know how or why. He almost wished that his grace would get sucked into the soil completely, or that the posts on the edge of the garden patch were destroyed. Anything but this odd half-state that he was currently trapped in.
He backs up slowly and opens the front door. The gray chicken turns right, straight to her winged fiend of a companion. They cluck excitedly. Dean grinds his teeth. He hasn't even had his morning coffee yet and he's hungry as fuck.
He risks opening up his phone and turns the screen away from Dean, but he needs just a little light. He's seen Dean Winchester at the library a lot since he works there and Castiel finds him very beautiful but the sight of Dean in bed sleeping, almost leaves him breathless.
Dean did the finger guns towards Cas. “Sure do. A bump for you. Get it? Because I – “ He dropped his guns. “I'm fine, it's not like my brain is gonna leak out.”
He knew that Cas would've loved it. Cas loved the forests, the trees, the oceans. He'd said that if God did one thing right – it was when he created nature.
This is their home. The thought is almost as terrifying as it is electrifying. For a brief second, worry rears its ugly head and a small voice pushes at him with its poisonous speech. That this won't last. That something will happen. That Dean will fuck up. That Cas will leave.
His hips undulate, trying to catch another thrust even though he knows it will be his undoing. Whimpers escape his mouth, mingling together with needy breaths. His cock leaks, salty fluid mingling with the salt of his sweat-soaked skin.
The other Dean waits until Dean's finished, holding the come in his mouth. He looks up gracefully, not letting his gaze drift from Dean and swallows.
After searching high and low, he finally spots the plant on the porch in the corner behind the stove. He moves the stove out of the way and looks at the plant. The green leaves and stalks hang close to the ground but maybe they're supposed to hang like that. Some of these modern plants look all droopy and sad, others look like grass. If Dean needed grass, he'd go outside and pick some, not buy it at Target for $ 24.99.
Cas chuckles and bends down to swallow Dean's head. His hand goes back to teasing Dean's balls, hands stroking lightly across the fabric, and Dean is in heaven.
Castiel pushes his finger all the way inside before retracting it. Cruelly, he teases Dean's hole, playing with the sensitive rim. There's an amused lilt to his voice, the darkness is temporarily gone when Castiel speaks. “You want my hand?”
“Do we really need... all this, Dean?” Cas raises a questioning eyebrow looking at the display in front of him. He fiddles on a cleaning sponge. They were only there to buy breakfast items but somehow they've ended up in the kitchen aisle.
The mattress on the bed was soft, a welcoming contrast to the hard planes of Cas' body covering him. Looking up at the man above him, Dean reached out a hand to caress his shoulder but Cas grabbed the wrist gently and pressed it down on the bed. A flash of excitement went through Dean as Cas increased the pressure on his wrist. Dean tried to free his arm but that was impossible like bone and bed had fused together.
“Mm,” Castiel hums, “I think they do. I'm looking forward to it too, Dean. I can't remember the last time we were on a vacation.”
He stops and looks at the horizon. In the distance, he sees it. A tall structure, rising high to meet the sky. A windmill.
The windows in the house are alright and the glass thick, so they just need a thorough cleaning. Dean can't wait to peel off the tape around the edges and near the baseboards after the paint dries.
“Don't fucking move.” He knows Dean realizes it's a knife against his soft neck by the way he freezes.
“‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro’ the bunker…” Gabriel began, tiptoeing across the room. “Well, shit, nothing rhymes with bunker. Drunker? Junker… Ooh, Dean wouldn’t like that one.”
Fuck, he didn't know what to do. He didn’t feel like he could give Cas the jacket or the suit as a suitable gift and he didn’t know what else to get.
games but as Cas didn't make a motion of any kind Dean was starting to wonder if he had miscalculated.
Dean shrugs Cas' hand off and turns to face him. “No. The process is done. Kitchen is finito. Why should we wait? Why? How?”
Castiel waits for Dean and they ride together towards a small trail that's trampled up by countless hooves.
Cas continues to massage Dean until goosebumps erupt on his skin, only to chase them away with warm water.
“You two do seem more... amicable nowadays. You made the chickens a... cabbage ball and all.” Cas' eyes glint with amusement.
Dean assumes the position he had before, now naked. He looks at the stone altar before him and wonders if he can find purchase somewhere.
Prompt by NicNack4U on Twitter. (apparently, all my drabbles are turning super fluffy - what's happening?)
The glow from the porch lights chase away the darkness around the cottage. Dean has his plate propped on his knees and hums happily. “Man, I don't know about you Cas, but I can eat a dozen of these steaks. I never want to look at a sandwich ever again.”
"It's not. The lightness of the color isn't the same and the windows in the living room allow more light to come in. That also changes – ”
“What do you want?” Cas leans down and whispers in Dean's ear. “Do you want me to take you slowly, evenly?”
Dean eyes the directions on the phone now and then – apparently, Cas picked a special spot – but otherwise keeps his attention on the phone. “Please tell me you didn't forget – “
He remembers one of those time when Cas had talked about the Earth and the divinity of it all. How beautiful he had looked in the early morning light. They had been out on a case and the sun had draped him with its speckled embrace. Cas had looked ethereal – devastatingly handsome really – as he reflected on the beauty and fragility of the world around them.
Dean has some idea but he keeps on begging. “Please, I want to feel you inside of me. I can't wait for that cock to fill me up and – “
Dean moves hurriedly. He removes his Henley and folds it neatly. Castiel doesn't tell him to but Dean gets the feeling that it's expected. He goes to place the clothes on the prayer bench but Castiel stops him.
Dean cleared his throat, suddenly jolted awake to reality. “Yeah, it is.” His arm was pressed against Cas'. It felt like he was on fire, and he'd gladly burn.
Cas pauses briefly, and Dean sees his face change. His expression softens – really isn't like anything Dean has seen before. He looks so damn happy.
Stroking her gray feathers soothingly, Dean mumbles, “It's just a figure of speech Henley. I'm not gonna step on your eggs.”
Dean's hazel green eyes narrowed in worry but still, they met Cas' gaze. “That's good, Dean. It's nothing but thunder and lightning. It will pass soon. Now, let's ride out this storm together.”
Dean can feel his come as it rushes inside him, and when he thinks that Cas will pull out, he doesn't. He stays until his hips stop twitching and then he pulls out slowly. He closes his eyes, it's too much and then Cas' words bring him back.
Dean scoffs. “Hiking is a tool for fools to lure them in. You picture yourself campfires, roasted marshmallows, shooting stars and all that crap. Instead, what you're getting is mosquito bites everywhere, blisters on your feet, and miles and miles of walking. Sam won't fool me. Suddenly you're tired and end up resting in a cabin where you get crazy drugged and horny as fuck only to realize the owners are some creeps and
By his own accord, he moves towards the Impala. “I'll just get Baby.” Peter is slowly walking over to the car and over Dean's dead body is he gonna sit down in her.
Dean looks around but no one seems to have noticed. “I can't take you anywhere,” Dean mumbles as he tucks himself away. “Holy shit, Cas.”
Dean furrows his brow and doesn't hide the scoff in his voice. “Are you kidding me? Like hell it is, Cas. I thrive on quiet.”
“Let me just – “ Castiel takes a step to the side and grabs something. Dean hears some scribbling before he turns to him again. “So.”
He's perfect like this, just waiting for Castiel. The way Dean lays there, it's almost like an offering to Castiel and he's not going to turn it down.
The eye keeps staring at him but Dean's eyes are all on the tentacles. He doesn't understand how they can be solid when they look like they're made of light but his mind doesn't have the luxury of thinking about such things right now.
Dean took another pull on the whiskey and grimaced as he swallowed, the burn way past pleasant. Or maybe Dean was afraid that if he said it back, something would happen and Cas would vanish again. Ache seized his heart at the thought and the fucked up thing was that he didn't know what was worse; him not saying anything or the thought that he'd say it back, only to lose Cas again.
Clenching his hands, Dean breaths out through his nose, tries to calm down. “Why the fuck do you think I
After going through every room, they end up in the living room. Henley seems very content cuddling with Dean, even though he's carrying her under his arm with her chicken feet dangling in the air.
Finally, he broke off as Dean whimpered in protest. “I think this is enough. I need to know my limits.” He grinned as he looked up at Dean. “I'm not good with spears.” Lazily, he teased Dean's fluttering hole with his finger.
Alyssa proved to be incredibly competent at least, and an hour later, Dean left the menswear store with a lovely new suit for Cas in hand, along with a bright blue silk tie and crisp white shirt. He’d even bought shoes, since he knew Cas was a full size bigger than him.
Nodding, Cas starts to say something but Dean increases his speed and squeezes just below Cas' head. Cas moans again, lost under Dean's skillful hands. “Fuck, I think I'ma come soon. The heat feels amazing. You're so good at this,
Castiel kneels down to meet Dean, still not letting go of his throat. “Go on.” His voice is matter of fact, which turns Dean on even more.
Leaning in, Dean kisses that black mop of hair that he adores. He loves Cas so fucking much. “I – uh, I was just thinking about after everything – you know, Chuck, the Empty –  that... you're still here. That we are together."
“Of course you need me. I'll take care of you, Dean.” Cas smiled but lowered himself over Dean, offering himself silently. Rising up to meet him, Dean kissed Cas with fervor, lips bruising. A moan escaped him as he felt the hand on his thigh grip harder, nails burying down in his skin. Panting Dean fell back on the bed.
Dean grins. “Yeah. Towel?” He waits while Cas rummages through their stuff and tosses a T-shirt at him. “This better not be my Zeppelin one.”
business – surely has his own issues with it. It would be an asshole move to start talking about his husband's death, so Dean remains silent. They've talked about it already. It's done and over with. He's fine.
As with everything else in life, Cas took the notion of sex to heart and he turned out to be a quick study. “I'm not foreign to the concept of sex, Dean. As a former ancient cosmic being I've observed countless sexual practices throughout the ages and nothing you desire will ever make me uncomfortable. I'll never judge you.”
Then, he knew love as pain. A cruel but constant mistress that even in her harshness was comforting. To Dean, love was then something that burned bright albeit briefly and was always followed by a bitter taste of regret and anger, and deep down a yearning for more. Over time, even the comfort was erased until all that remained was something caustic and cold. And though Dean longed for warmth and kindness, he knew a tainted soul like him deserved nothing. Not even warped love would stay. Love was to yearn, ache, lose. To be abandoned.
Castiel shoves the finger inside, and Dean can taste the bitterness of his own cum. He sucks and cleans the finger until Castiel pulls it out again. “I think that was kind of bitter, no acidic taste at all. Next time, I'll pick the cocking lesson.”
The parking lot is sizable and since they arrived early when the store had just opened, there's no cars surrounding Baby. She's parked in a closed-off zone, courtesy of the car rental agency. “I can see her,” Dean says, “but I don't like how that guy, Peter, is looking at her.”
him. Then Eileen's words register properly. “Hey, wait a second. I have green fingers, too! They're greener than Shrek's. When I plant seeds, they race to see who will breach the soil first.”
Michael narrowed his eyes, his face wearing a mocking smile that made Cas' heart beat faster in anger.
“I'll raise you from the perdition of your own making and give you what you want. I'll give you the blessing you crave.” Castiel's finger dips between the crack of Dean's ass, applying pressure on his puckered hole.
Castiel has tied his wrists with fucking rosary beads. He pulls at the necklace and is surprised when it holds. He pulls back harder, using both his wrists now but the necklaces don't break. Sighing, Dean relaxes against the altar. There's no use in pulling, all that will achieve are burns and that's a pain he can live without.
When the shower is done, they both crawl into bed. Dean slings an arm around Cas and sighs contentedly. “Now I know how a dishcloth must feel... fan-fucking-tastic.” He pokes at Cas. “Hey turn around.”
He noticed Cas' yellow sneakers and called out. “Cas, if I ever ask for bread again, please shoot me.”
He tilts his head trying to decipher Dean's words and he looks so fucking adorable that Dean lets out a nervous laugh. “No. I mean, yes... Fuck.” Frustrated, he rubs a hand over his face. He's not doing a great job of explaining it but Cas is ever patient.
He seemed content with that answer but Dean was curious. “Why did you want to draw me? You see me every day, nothing special about that.”
Castiel smiles and raises his hands in an apologetic gesture. “I'm not out to steal your coffee, I promise.”
He notices Dean's breathing increase and how he fidgets in his bindings. Removing the cane brings stillness to Dean. It's a false peace.
“F-f-father, it feels so good,” Dean mumbles and remembers in the last second to change his fuck to something Castiel approves of.
Cas frowns. “They have water and I gave them some corn before the trip. Maybe I should've done more research. I keep forgetting that I don't have powers anymore.”
go after him. Counting to three, Dean cursed himself like the huge fucking idiot he was and then walked after him.
Dean grabs the cat carrier from the back of Baby. He puts it down in the grass and looks at the chickens. They're kinda big and have passed the stage of adorable fluff, transformed into walking feather balls. “So, should I just release them into the wild?”
Dean sighed. “Mm, sorry about that. I was a coward. You are family, I would die for you, just as I would for Sam and Jack. And I love them. But I'm
Following the sound to Baby, he doesn't see anything out of the ordinary at first. When he rounds Baby's trunk, he spots a wooden carrier on the floor. It looks like a cat carrier. Dean picks it up and what stares back at him is anything but a cat.
Despite being stuck in the mud, Castiel still had some dignity left. “Well, hello to you too, husband.” Not wanting to be an ass, he decided to soothe Dean's fears by telling him how much he meant to him. “I love you, dearly.”
Castiel snaps with his hips, melding himself to Dean, and grazes with his teeth on soft skin. His breath is a dark whisper near his ear. “How much more?”
The sharp shrill from the phone's alarm woke Dean up with a start. Groggily, he peeled his eyes open and searched blindly for the phone on his side of the bed. Coming up empty, he turned towards Cas and shoved at him. “Phone.”
Forcing air out of his nose, Dean was initially going to answer calmly but then he thought about how Cas had emphasized that word. He was not fucking
“Oh, still silent about that? Well, I'm not surprised. You did pour out your heart, dying with a spear firmly embedded in your gut.” There was a hard edge to his voice as he continued. “Did you know why Dean didn't answer you? Fear. Maybe his needy little heart had misunderstood you? How could you really love him? A mere human when you were an angel of the Lord?”
Dean clenches his teeth to stop himself from cursing, and then Castiel hits him again. “God!” It's like something is biting into his skin and warmth floods his body. It's the kind of warmth that he knows will turn ice cold soon.
The table is clear, except for one piece; it looks like a round steel Pokemon ball. Dean picks it up. It has a nice, heavy weight to it. Spinning it around, Dean doesn't see any sign of an opening or welding or anything that implies how it's pieced together.
almost radiate as she flaps her wings. Dean looks up at the sky, but doesn't see the moon through the leaves. Lorp turns her head to the side but her black eye shines at him.
Charlie had more spunk than him. She was the one that had dragged him to the party yesterday and despite him being tired after all the swimming and the mountain trek Charlie had insisted they go on in the early morning, he'd had a good time. It was his fault that he hadn't told Charlie of what had happened yesterday, so here he was again, but where his mood has been light then it was now clouded in darkness. Just a few more hours and then he could take her back home and hit the bed.
It was odd seeing Cas in this position but strangely satisfying. Try to get out of this with a fucking card, Cas. Dean walked up to him and stopped when he stood in front of him. Cas looked straight ahead, even when Dean's hand carded into Cas' dark hair, perpetually in a style of just-done-being-fucked. Dean let go of his hair, his hand trailing down to the front of Cas' face. His thumb played over Cas' plump lips before pushing inside. Cas was truly beautiful like this and hot as fuck.
Cas just smirks and pulls at Dean's belt, before unbuckling it. When he pulls down the zipper and eases a hand inside Dean's pants and underwear, Dean realizes that they'll never make it to the bedroom.
The way Dean is pushed down, overpowered with no escape. How Dean feels so damn full and how Castiel keeps going, never stopping. How Castiel's hold on his hips changes as he pulls him closer, only to pin him down again. The way his nipples throb and how that delicious pain echos the needy throb in his cock.
Dean leaned in to look where Castiel pointed. The lussecats were golden buns shaped like “S” with... of course, a gross raisin stuffed in the middle.
Looking up and down Poyntz Avenue, he realized all the stores were closed, lights off, and locked up tight. Only the store directly across from the diner still had its open sign lit, and it was a jewelry store.
His own cock is throbbing and his heart beats wildly. A quick glance at Cas makes him smile. No one should look that
Dean chuckles but the laughter dies down as he looks at Cas in his mask. Black, intricate crow feathers frame his face and hide everything but his eyes. The beak should look ridiculous but on Cas, it looks intimidating. And
Dean clears his throat and the sound seems loud, obscene almost. “I thought the church was open, Father. My bad.”
Dean moans softly as Castiel's finger slowly works its way inside; it feels fucking amazing and he tries not to clamp down hard.
Not having a care in the world, Cas pulls off and slowly gets up. He opens his mouth, showing Dean before he swallows.
It's also a sincere smile, one that almost scares Dean with what it draws forth from him. This is their home. A sudden burst of happiness fills him and with that a sense of astonishment. He wonders briefly if he'll ever stop being amazed that he and Cas are together – hell, married! – that his story ended happily.
Dean shrugs. “Sleep is fine but it'll be an unsatisfying sleep. Like... you know when you pour a beer and it's all foam. Horrible.”
His mouth is stuffed, his nipples are hard and Cas bends over Dean, stroking his soft stomach. The grace tentacles hover above him, like a threat, or promise. “Look at you, splayed out like that. All for me.”
The heat of Cas' mouth feels fucking amazing and then Cas starts sucking up and down. His other hand goes to his shaft and he does a twisting motion. Dean claps his mouth shut and tries not to moan.
“Sure, what's another winged creature in the house?” Grabbing the buckets of paint, rollers and some brushes, they walk down the aisles.
“Maybe a cock would be too conspicuous. I think a hand would be enough. Don't you? One hand here.” Cas squeezes around Dean's head again, and one hand here.” He places the hand around his throat and squeezes just right. “I think it's best if my hands rest here. I don't want you to call attention to yourself.”
Exhaling, Cas started to collect all his Monopoly money, but Dean didn't fail to notice that raised eyebrow.
With a practiced movement, Cas puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out something. He sinks down to one knee and takes Dean's hand in his.
Like that would work, Dean thought but he didn't say it out loud. “He's busy. And you're my little brother, it comes with the territory that I should boss you around.”
Then Cas retracts the tentacle from Dean's ass, only for a smaller one to squirt something inside him.
Cas eyed the TV. “I don't know. They're probably rigged anyway and I'm not sure I'd like to be entertainment for rich people. But I think I would. Only for the change to kill whoever was responsible.”
“I guess,” Dean mumbled. In the distance he could hear a rumbling; he was not sure if it came from the party or from outside. It almost sounded like thunder and for a moment images of huge waves crashing over sharp rocks and the lulling sound of water as it touched the beach came over him. He looked at Cas in confusion, wanting to ask him if he also heard the noise but the sight of Cas fully naked before him shattered any such notion.
He's mowing the lawn wearing black sweatpants and a pink T-shirt that's tight enough to tell Dean that he's definitely working out. It should look ridiculous but the guy has a nice body,
Dean doesn't need much prompting though. He opens up to Cas and moans in surprise at the rush of want that Cas coaxes from him so effortlessly. The warmth of working with his body is overshadowed by the pure desire that surges through his body, a heat that can only be quelled by this man before him.
Not sure where Dean was going with this, Cas just nodded and grabbed Dean by the shoulders, pulling him down. His boyfriend was sure in an odd mood right now, but as long as they finished what they started, Cas would not complain.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, yeah. There's nothing wrong with some peace and quiet. I think we've earned it. Decapitating vamps, running around fighting monsters left and right for ages. If I wanna sit down, eat a fine steak and not worry about getting my balls busted by a witch or get trapped in some weird alternate universe where I have to relieve my worst nightmare, again and again, I'll take being called old. Besides, with you going all out with the professor McGonagall I think the kids are alright. We are legacies. Let the youngsters do the backbreaking things. The only thing I wanna break is Cas' winning streak in Yatzee.”
Dean raises an eyebrow and shakes his head slightly. Maybe Charlie is overworked. He should invite her to dinner this weekend.
“Look at this baby. Isn't she beautiful? You can put that bowl back, Cas. I'm bringing out the big guns.”
His heart was pounding and his palms were sweaty, too. Dean realized he was absolutely the most pathetic, ridiculous creature in the entire state of Kansas...maybe even the entire country.
Dean is not sure where all this is going. To be fair, he has his suspicions, he has his hope which almost makes him laugh. He's never been one to hope but the first time Dean looked at Castiel, he found faith.
Dean doesn't need to look at the blue of Castiel's eyes, the ethereal glow that starts out dim and burns brighter as he nears his completion.
The gun vanished. “Old habits die hard.” John walked around a table and was about to embrace his son when the door opened again.
He blows away some of the shavings and looks at it. It looks good. “I think I'm all about done here. How about you, Cas?”
A shrill scream pierces the night as the mother stumbles out, flames engulfing her. She runs hurriedly to the lake as her husband follows. The open door spews out more fire.
Ambling over to the bedside table, he opens the cabinet but there are no bottles there. “Son of a bitch,” Dean mumbles. Sam had to have been in his room. He doesn't even have the energy to be pissed off about that; he just muses that he needs to get a chain and padlock.
Dean laughed. “Cas... you're the fucking poster boy for beautiful. And hot.” He sighed and turned serious. “Man, I know this is just a kiss and no promises and all that, maybe you just wanted to kiss a pretty face,” Dean grinned, “but I've been in love with you for almost a year.”
Castiel looks at him. “She's just adjusting to you hanging on.” He narrows his eyes. “I thought you rode horses.”
Kushiel rolled his eyes. Puriel seemed to be enveloped in hair, a living, breathing hairball. He laughed for himself, savoring the moment. The high was already wearing off.
Dean finds the box three weeks after moving in. He hasn't been avoiding the attic, it's just that he didn't have any reason to be up there after storing away the last two boxes that contained his art supplies.
Communal gatherings weren't really Dean's thing but he owed Mildred one for fixing him the apartment. He scanned the crowd, his heart skipping a beat when he noticed Castiel, his neighbor.
“Well, Eileen's been very encouraging and Rowena has taught me some tricks,” Sam said, “but that was my own spell, yes.”
As soon as they left him, Dean got up and hurriedly pulled up his pants and underwear. The burn on his cheeks had nothing against the blazing inferno that spread over his face. “Cas, I –“ He had his back turned to his friend, afraid to turn around.
Dean opens his eyes and has just enough time to see Jack smile and wave before he vanishes. He blinks and sighs in relief when he notices Cas standing next to him with a perplexed expression on his face.
Dean strokes Cas' entire length; it feels very smooth with the oil. He drips some more oil on the head and watches as some of it pools around Cas' short hair. He adds some more, letting it run down to Cas' balls.
“Nope, you're not old, you have patina.” Dean caresses the hair above Cas' ear that's sprinkled with gray.
Castiel's smile is predatory, and he nods once, as if he's pleased with Dean's reaction. “You are for my eyes and I want to look at you. 'You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you', so Solomon says and beauty is to be perceived.” Castiel leans in, and whispers close to the shell of Dean's ear. “So let me perceive.”
They start with the smaller stuff. Dean temporarily places the cleaning supplies and paint in the bathroom.
It's like Castiel knows where Dean's thoughts are going because he kisses Dean again and reassures him. “That's it. You're so close. I can feel your hard cock rut against me. You're beautiful like this, Dean. Taking what you need. What you want. Because you do want this.” He moves his leg causing Dean to briefly shut his eyes in pleasure.
He looks at Jack. “Alright, you put the potatoes in the oven, don't forget the garlic butter on top.” Dean grabs the tray with the chicken wings and places it next to the potatoes. “Man, this smells amazing already. Come on, we have time. I'll give you the tour.”
“The sun is up, it's been nice, this has been nice, Cas. How about we head back home, crawl back to bed, and take a nap?”
Dean's kisses traveled down Cas' throat and he was so pleased when Cas arched his neck, almost in supplication.
Dean has no idea where to go from here and Billie's fist against the door is a doomsday call but his pulse is down a notch, not that it really helps. He still feels like he's going to throw up but there's this weird burst of joy mixed in there.

Firing up his girl, he pointed her westward, ready to get as much distance as possible between him and Kansas City.
Cas' hand is swift as it wraps around Dean's throat. “I will not abide you disparaging yourself, Dean. In this household, we worship at the altar of Winchester. And no, that doesn't mean only Castiel Winchester but the other Winchester, too.”
Dean turns around but doesn't see what could cause Sam to laugh, let alone remind him of any bet. “You're not making any sense.”
“Cas, you've got this. You're basically a pro.” He glances over at Peter who he knows is holding the car keys to Baby. He can see it in how Peter swings his hand.
The sun hits his face and Dean squints against the harsh light. He moves slowly; his body feels like it's been hit with a goddamn truck. “Man, I gotta stop drinking this much”, he mutters. He stills when he feels
“Lorp, you come back here. You know that part is off-limits!” Lorp ignores him and pushes through the greenery, disappearing from sight. Dean catches a glimpse of Henley, but she's a good chicken and stays close to the house and coop.
Castiel strokes him slowly, going over the globes of his ass. Fuck, finally. Dean's cock twitches and he sighs against the endorphins that rush over him. He's always liked massages; how the hands go over his skin and work out the kinks in his back and shoulders, turn hard muscles pliant.
“I'm home,” Sam says and changes his grip so he holds both the pan and spoon in one hand. With the other hand, he flicks open a small vial and tosses it at Dean.
“Thank you,” he chuckles darkly and pushes in all the way to the back. As Dean swallows around the intruding member, Cas groans in approval and tugs at his hair. Cas pulls out and splays his hand over Dean's shoulder blades. “Arch your back more.”
Castiel's hand on his cock was a shook. Dean pulled away immediately, bucking his hip – or tried to – but all that his body produced was a weak twitch. “What the fuck did you do to me?”
Dean feels the mattress sink lower as Cas kneels down next to him. He hugs him close and nuzzles his neck. “Dean, my love. How are you?”
Just then Dean remembers something. “We forgot the roost. But that's easily fixed...” He opens Baby's trunk and comes back with a big machete. This was not in any of the how-to-guides of owning chickens he'd quickly searched on his phone nor in Cas’ chicken-lecture.
There's a pause as Cas thinks. “I'd say yes. While my memories are the vessel for millennia of lived experience, I haven't been
“Alright. Let's see if we can catch some dinner. Sam's coming over and he eats a whole school of fish.”
Cas opens and closes his mouth. “I've told you I love you. In that church when I was stabbed by the spear – “
Sam comes face to face with Dean and Dean just gapes. Sam is wearing a whistle around his neck and holds a saucepan and wooden spoon in his hands.
The lights are dimmed, popcorn is popped, blankets are folded and ready to go if anyone needs them and the beer is chilled. It's the perfect movie night, except Dean's internal alarm bells are practically screaming.
Cas' side of the bed is empty. What the hell? Maybe he changed his mind. “Cas?” When he takes another step, he feels a presence behind him. He's just about to turn his head when he feels a hand between his shoulder blades. Just a light shove and Dean's pushed against the wall.
Back in the tent, Dean pulls off his damp hoodie and his pants, then sighs with contentment as he eases into the sleeping bag. “I won't be having trouble sleeping now. God, after forty it feels like your entire life is a slow crawl towards death. My knee hurts, I think I have a thousand tiny cuts from walking through some damn bushes and a blister on my right foot.”
"I watch your movies and ask you questions and enjoy seeing you overly excitable even when it's not a movie or show I have particular interest in."
Sam huffs. “Not like that. Besides, what's stopping you? Castiel is good-looking. I've seen him on occasion when I'm at the library borrowing books. Tall, broad shoulders, nice hair, pretty blue eyes. He seems nice, and always helps me when I need to find a book.”
Dean sinks his hand in the water again and touches the last remnants of what was once Cas. “I love –”
“This ain't my kink, sweetheart.” Half the time he didn't know if he even believed in their mission, yet so far he had stayed. Right now he wished that he hadn't.
That is life, Dean muses as sleep slowly beckons him to follow her. Life is not straight, not order. There is a system to life yes, a symmetry and pulse, but it dances around the edges of chaos and choices, much like love.
Climbing down in their sleeping bags for the night, Dean sighs. “Just one more night and then I'll have the sweet embrace of a mattress. I don't understand how people over forty think camping is fun.” Dean turns until he finds an angle that doesn't hurt his back as much. His body is definitely objecting to the lack of a proper bed. “Scratch that. I don't understand how camping is fun. Period. I'd replace misery and fear for memory foam in a heartbeat.”
He pulls out a smaller pocket knife and smooths the branch down. “Here, now the Misses Prissies can perch and do whatever it is chickens do with a stick.”
Dean scoffs and grabs his end of the piece. “Nope, not at all. Let's go.” It's heavier than he remembers it to be but he's not going to complain. He's strong, he's got this.
The pictures are tiny and Dean squints at the little squares. “Macaroon Cream? Moth Gray? That doesn't sound appealing at all.”
Sam sighs. “Because I lost a bet a couple of weeks ago and promised Dean we'd do one thing that he wanted for Christmas.”
He closes his eyes. This must be heaven. Being fucked by a priest–and while that is kinky–the fact that it's Castiel makes it so much damn sweeter.
“You don't know that. And I do need one... for making you eggs in a basket in the morning. With fresh eggs from our chickens, how about that?” He points a finger at Cas excitedly. “Every day!” Leaning in, he whispers, “Every. Freaking. Day.”
Not wanting to make a big deal out of it, Dean shrugs. “Yeah, it's a good treat for them. Has lots of vitamins.”
Cas nods and wraps a tentacle around Dean, pulling him in while he places another tentacle protectively over Dean's belly.
The man's dark hair was disheveled but it was his eyes that had John backing away, not the fact that the stranger was walking straight towards him. They were sapphire steel and with each step a wall of
Any confusion Dean has is alleviated, when he hears the soft click of the cap and then he feels Cas' cock slick with lube, gently press in between his cheeks.
limp rag.” Dean sighs and Cas squeezes him tighter. A heartbeat later Cas has his fingers in Dean's hair. He alternates between moving in lazy circles and pressing hard into Dean's scalp.
Puriel wrinkled her nose and jumped off the swing. “No, and you can't get too high. Child protection services can take me and then I have to break out again. Don't cause trouble.”
Castiel moves, Dean can hear the soft clicks of his shoes on the stone floor. “Raise up your hands slightly.”
A few bedraggled old artificial wreaths hung on walls and a garland of plain fresh pine roping had been wound around the stair railing. At least it made the room smell a little festive. He gave it a flick with his finger and sauntered over to where a decent little tree had been set up in the library. It was strung with colorful lights and popcorn garlands, and other little trinkets that Jack and probably found around the bunker. They may not have had a chimney, but that hadn’t stopped Jack from tacking up a dozen or so socks along the bookshelves beside the tree.
He doesn't know why he calls out to her – she's dead and gone – but he's read enough paranormal magazines to know that sometimes dead people turn into ghosts, maybe even poltergeists and shit.
They go slowly over rocks, grass and tree stumps. The moon is out but so are the clouds and although the stars try to penetrate the dark and gloom, Dean prefers it this way. It will make the contrast so much better. He can feel his heartbeat speed up just by the thought. He glances over at Cas. “You got your lighter?”
He leans in and kisses Cas' mouth, mumbling in between nips. “Say that again?” He stops when he feels Cas' hand splayed on his chest.
The other man stills but doesn't move away. “Did you just smell me?” Mortification colors Dean's cheeks red and turns his tongue into stone. “That's alright, Dean. I've wanted to taste you since the day I met you.”
Sighing, Sam pats Dean's shoulder and gets up. “I'm just looking out for you, you know. If you don't wanna date the hot librarian, you obviously don't have to.”
“You are confused, Dean. I did not leave you. Rather was my action an invitation for more. And it was an invitation you couldn't decline, could you? You came to me like a ship during troubled waters, following the light to safe harbor. I was merely your guide.”
“They followed me like I'm their mother and went inside the house, spreading feathers all over the place.” Cas nods as Dean explains what transpired, as if he's the damn chicken-whisper or something.
He pulls the trigger and darkness is gone momentarily as a lance of fire envelops one bed. Dean doesn't even register the angry shrills as he aims the fire at the other kid. He wishes the fire lasts longer, that he can be there longer but they have to move.
Come drips out of Dean's cock, a little stream that runs down his hardening length. Dear Gods. Castiel moans and bottoms out.
The rain had turned into a downpour but those three words were enough to warm Castiel. “Let's go home.”
They remove their masks temporarily as they place wood fillers in all holes and gaps they encounter.
Dean listened to the words but wasn't understanding what Castiel was saying. He flexed his fingers and pulled at the wrists. Sudden anger coursed through him. “Why the fuck am I here? Why do I have cuffs?” Suddenly, Dean become aware of himself, fully, and of what wasn't there.
Cas nods. “All set, and the lock is in place on the door as is the wire underground. We don't want to make it easy for any wild animals and predators.”
Cas holds Dean tighter. “As long as you don't aim at my heart. That was stabbed a long time ago with the arrow of – “
“I – you've always said that we had a profound bond. And we do. I never... I didn't think angels could love like this. And I sure as hell never thought that I was worthy of that love. This... what happened here tonight. You changed me, Cas.” Dean took another step towards Cas and grabbed his hands. “I thought that the love I had for you, that it was a love, a primal one, a
He leaned to the side and grabbed hold of a plant. It was cucumber. Castiel plucked the long vegetable and took a bite. It was watery and just slightly bitter but he didn't care. He bit off another mouthful and chewed while thinking. He'd devise a plan, but in the meantime, he'd eat.
After doing a trip to the store – buying mattresses and ordering a new fridge and freezer – Dean puts the groceries away. He promised Cas there would be meat and potatoes on the table. Not that they have a table at the moment, it's on its way, but eating on paper plates on the porch works too.
Dean looks up at Castiel. He's handsome, hot even –too fucking hot to be a priest– and his blue eyes seem to stare straight into Dean's soul. They seem to penetrate him (God help him, his cock twitches at that thought) and know his every secret and sin.
Dean remembers a time when he thought so. Maybe enjoyable is too strong of a word, but he hunted because it brought him satisfaction. Because it was all he knew. He knows that he made a difference in many people's lives, saved the world a couple of times. But had he enjoyed the world he saved?
“No, I mean. He just doesn’t have anything really nice and I just wanted to--you know what? Forget it.” Dean turned to go and the woman reached out and touched his arm.
He soared down the tree decoration aisle on his cart, warbling ‘Santa Claus is Coming to Town’, and grabbing handfuls of everything that glittered or sparkled obscenely. Tacky tinsel, baubles that played music, and a golden rotating angel that glowed to go on top of the tree. A fluffy tree skirt that looked like a holdover from a Christmas porn movie, snowflake garlands, and irritating toys that started singing hymns whenever someone walked past made it into his cart.
Dean's heartbeat speeds up. His ass is full and his mouth is full and tentacles or not, he feels like he's fucking floating in space. The pressure keeps building and a slow-burning sensation grows around his ass.
Dean meets a mysterious man named Cas at a party. He can't resist him, not the first time, and certainly not the second time.
“Stop ogling. It's your fourth time. Go approach him, my Lord.” She practically shoves him towards Cas.
me? And the names are great. Henley and Lorp, it's every chicken's dream to have awesome names like that. Jack, help me out here.”
Dean scoffs. “I don't know about that. I still remember when we played poker with Sam and Eileen and you –“
“You know, I almost lost it when I saw you. At first, I thought that you'd told Charlie, that it was planned.”
He hasn't dreamt about the archangel in over a year and now his mind decides to bring him and all the unpleasant memories attached to him back. Dean chucks away the broken parts of the twig and grabs a leaf instead. He tears the leaf methodically, trying to make the pieces as tiny as possible. He imagines that they are Michael's wings and each little bit that he tears apart is a feather. The Empty can feast on Michael's pain and regret for eternity for all that Dean cares.
Dean glares at Charlie. She's working for him – one of his best – but she's also his friend and unfortunately, she knows what he feels about Castiel. She hasn't stopped pestering him since. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
Dean takes a step forward and Henley finally gets the message and turns to walk out. Slowly. “I swear, they're out to get me, these hens.”
Again the tentacle pushes inside, and Dean can feel it swell in his mouth. Just when he thinks that he's about to choke, a warm fluid fills his mouth. Dean coughs and feels some of the fluid dribble out of his mouth but not enough. He swallows desperately, all the while trying to breathe. His body is still being pressed down by the other tentacles.
Both Cas and Sam looked at Dean questioningly but Dean had no time to say something witty. He walked over to one of the stainless steel cabinets, opened it, and pulled out a black KitchenAid.
Cas laughed. “No razors.” He pointed to the spot where he sat. “Please here, I think the lightning is the best here. I'll just grab some pencils and thicker paper.”
Cas surged forward and kissed Dean passionately. Not at all in a brotherly way but deeply and with tongue.
Sam freezes for a split second before shutting the door so fast Dean thinks the hinges will be messed up.
Dean would absolutely take that. Although sex with Cas had an entirely separate and special place in his heart, he adored making him happy and feeling good in every way possible. He prided himself on taking care of him every bit as much as Cas cared for him.
Cas' arm in his was nice. It steadied him and the room didn't do the rumba. “Man, are we there yet, Cas?”
Frowning, Dean took a swipe of the beer the bartender had shuffled his way. He searched the crowd for Charlie and found her in a corner, talking to another redhead. She glanced his way, a grin on her face and raised a drink. Dean saluted her and turned his attention back to the crowd.
Dean shrugs and grabs a handful of M&M's from the bowl. “And about you asking me why Cas?” he says between chews. Pointing at Sam, Dean continues. “You tell him, Sammy.
They reach the end of the thick forest and walk through a patch of weeds that grows in their path. The river calms down and is now more a brook than anything else. The other side is tall grass and wildflowers. Dean didn't expect a meadow to be here but doesn't say anything.
Castiel leaves Dean's side and stands by the altar again. A finger pushes gently at his chin and makes him look straight ahead.
Castiel watches Dean intently as he walks over to the wall and picks up the Willow. He can see Dean's apprehension. His shoulders are tight, his breathing is shallow and he doesn't miss the tremble as he carries the Willow back to Castiel.
Not much happens at the party though. Dean mingles a bit, tries the wine which he hates and decides to eat as many canapes and miniature cakes as he can instead. After listening to a guy talking about stocks for ten minutes – and seeing Cas being busy talking with someone – Dean grabs a cracker and retreats to a corner.
“Is that so?” Cas leaned in, his hands trailing gently over Dean's chest, up over his shoulders. “I think this shirt is too much too.” A hand wound its way around the nape of Dean's neck, and small goosebumps exploded near the base of Dean's skull. The urge to close his eyes and give in was so overwhelming that Dean lost himself for a moment before realizing what Cas was doing.
He stops for a second, dragging the cane over Dean's arch and exalts in how Dean flinches, expecting more pain.
“You really can't– ” Dean cuts him off with a soft kiss, pries open Cas' mouth to claim more. Cas tastes of the ocean and even as a human, he's still electrifying. Where before it was the quiet hum of his grace that Dean could feel pulsating off him in waves, this time it's the sheer joy of being able to be close, to be in his presence. To share not only a profound bond with Cas, but a profound
Dean realizes what's going on. Cas is so into it, so lost that he's not hearing what Dean's actually saying. “Cas... Cas!”
Sam scoffs. “Please.” He walks up to the small built-in shelf and eyes some of the books. “Most of these seem to be your kind of books. Vonnegut,
Castiel gripped the spear and flexed his arm. He leaned the tip of the spear slightly upward and squinted. Dean could see the moment Castiel was ready; his bicep flexed and his arm went back. Suddenly the spear was in the air and Castiel's grunt was cut off by the loud thunk of the spear hitting wood.
For some reason that's really beyond him, Dean hesitates with his underwear. His fingers ghost at the waistband.
“Just gonna adjust my grip.” Dean moves his hands slightly and is just ready to go when he notices that the chickens are at his feet. “Son of a bitch, the black chicken is right next to me, I think. Can't see it.”
Shit, maybe he took it too far. “But uh, I'm sure this time the sun will be extra cool. And hey, since it's at the crack of fucking dawn, I get to spend some extra hours with you.”
Dean turns away from Castiel, and grabs his arm, placing it over him. “Spoon time.” Castiel adjusts himself and hugs Dean. “And we are spending time with each other, but that's not what I mean. I'm looking forward to the extra benefits. Massage, the beach, all the bacon I can eat. You think they have those tiny little pancakes?”
even more, is just looking at Cas. Sure, it might be because his husband is hot as fuck but it's not just that. Since becoming human, Cas has fully embraced the change. It's not all been a roller coaster ride, far from it, but Cas dives into each new experience. He takes part in it and his determination to enjoy life reminds Dean of how often he missed that.
Kadriel blinked. Dean Winchester hardly fought for good. How could he when he was allied with the humans? He looked at Jael, his garrison leader, who shook her head slightly. Kadriel was just about to go over his briefing with her. He tuned in on her presence, shielding away every other angel.
Dean reached for the cover and dragged it over their naked bodies. “Mm, sure. I'm up for that after some Netflix, no chill.”
Cas looked at him with those brilliant blue eyes; sometimes they seemed to know secrets about Dean, even he himself wasn't aware of. “I heard you. So if he's home, let us
A whirlwind of warring emotions swirled through John but it all melted away when Dean Winchester, his eldest son stepped inside.
Dean's ass clamps down on Castiel's cock and it feels fucking amazing but Dean's body goes rigid and tight.
Dean would laugh out loud if his throat wasn't so dry. How could he not remember? He clenches his hands. “Yes, Father, I do.”
“I like them. And they just want to cuddle. This is a very friendly breed of chicken, it's an Australorp.”
“You can...” he sighs as Cas starts moving but it quickly turns into a protest when he stops. “Come on, Cas.” Dean opens his eyes only to see Cas raise an eyebrow.
Dean reaches down and grabs a chilled beer. He pops the cap and sighs as the bitter taste hits his tongue. “Anyone else wants some?”
He's angry because it's easier to cling to his anger at his own damn thoughts than to give in to fear. And he's angry because he shouldn't have a reason to be angry. Or afraid, for that matter.
Dean shrugged. “I don't know. We're quite far from the city center but the person at the reception desk said that usually, they can see the fireworks going off. As long as we don't except anything like Madison Square Garden.”
witch, too.” Witch Dean pats Dean on the arm. “And how's that going for you, the fucking?” He grins.
“I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be... what my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer.” Cas looked at Dean and Dean was shocked to see Cas' eyes wet, like he was about to cry. “Because the one thing I want... it's something I know I can't have. But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having. It's in just being. It's in just saying it.”
Cas kisses him and squeezes on his throat, choking him. “Be a good boy for me, Dean.” His whisper goes straight to Dean's cock and Dean is right there, right about to come when Cas removes his hand from Dean and releases him.
Dean hums and sinks into Cas' chest. Maybe it's the swim earlier but his muscles are sore and tired. But it's the good kind of sore that comes not from one too many hunts, but from using his body because it's fun and enjoyable. “I had fun,” Dean mumbles, “when I beat you.”
Dean bridged the gap between them and tentatively kissed Cas on the mouth, his finger still holding Cas' chin gently. His pulse was somewhere in the stratosphere.
Sam pulls away from Dean with an exasperated sigh and looks him in the eye. “Don't get into too much trouble. I'll call you if we find anything weird.”
He pulls up his hood and starts walking. He's not sure where he's going but he feels like the damn Energizer Bunny and walking is better than staying put.
“It's alright, turn around. I won't bite. If you don't want me to.” The man laughs as if he's said something funny.
Cas swats away Dean's finger. “I know! I heard you and each prayer was agony, a blade to my heart. Don't you think it took every resolve I had, and believe me as an ancient angel, I have as you'd say 'a fuckton' of it, not to run to you, not to be with you?!”
Jared laughed thinly like the question was ridiculous. “I'm so proud of you guys, but you know, I don't think the point is that it's.. you know, you both have male bodies. Human male bodies. Even you Cas.”
Dean flares up the collar on his black jacket and sticks his hands in his pocket to check for the keys before heading out. That's when he finds the crumbled-up paper.
Dean turns and starts pulling at the pillow. “Come on. Your head weighs more than a sack of potatoes.”
, when Dean stood there with fear hammering in his heart, hope turning to bitter ash and dread transforming his tongue to lead, that love
Dean blinks as droplets of Thundercloud gray land on his face. He wipes it away with one finger only to get more across his cheek.
A drop of water hits his nose and another one lands on his cheek, trailing down, gravity dragging it to his throat. Pulling up his hoodie, Dean grabs a twig and starts massacring it.
He hears Cas say those words, listens to Cas pour his damn heart out, and describes him in ways Dean would never use about himself. He swallows hard and listens as Cas continues “ – Because you cared, I cared. I cared about
His booted foot hits something hard and moving his arm, his elbow hits a wall. Opening his eyes, Dean sees nothing but darkness but he doesn't need to see. He knows where he is.
He drops his hands slowly and tries to ignore the hotness that flames up in his checks as Castiel looks him up and down.
Castiel grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him towards the stall. “I saw how you eyed that murder teddy. Let's give it a try.”
Cas caresses his arms, up and down. It feels nice. The weight of his arm is comforting. Cas slides down to his side and envelops Dean in a hug.
Slowly rising, the sun glows a deep dark orange. The ocean waves kiss the sand gently and the sound is kind of nice, relaxing. Dean forgets about everything for a moment. Cas is right. There is something spectacular about the sun bringing about the day. “I hate to say this but I guess you were right. Just a bit though. The sunrise is kinda nice.”
Dean pats Sam on the back and lets go. “It's nothing.” He looks at his hands. “I need to wash my hands off all this glitter and then we can watch another movie. I think Sam has suffered enough.”
Cas pulled away, a small frown on his face. “That's kind of a vacant look you have there, Dean. Not the exact reaction I was hoping for while kissing you.”
“For the love of... Cas. I'm sorry, alright. You're awesome with speary things. Javelin, Britney Spears, you're the expert. Please, fuck me with your tongue.”
Dean turns and huffs. “Of course not, Cas. Give me some credit here, man.” He grins. “I named it after Robert Plant.”
