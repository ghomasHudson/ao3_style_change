Soon Gerrick changes the subject, blathering on about their teenage years and how he was into sports and other such nonsense.
God but he drives John mad, he's like a damned cat from the way he moves to the way he talks and purrs, for God's sake.
Truth is, not a lot of people know John as well as they'd like, his closest friends and family included. Whereas Harry was loud and brash, more bark than bite so to say, John was quiet when wronged, until just before he crushed their bones.
Sherlock finally breaths and leans forward, head dropping against the door, curls all mussed. John slowly gets up, caressing his back as he makes to support the slumping form of the detective.
'Jawn, please jAWN' Thrice. John growls and grabs Sherlock's hair again, pulling his head around in order to lick at his mouth, hips never stopping their thrusting.
Away from set pieces, props help to secure the ball when a player has been tackled, so it helps if they can combine their power with a degree of mobility. You’ll also often see them used as battering rams in attack, receiving short passes after a ruck or maul and hitting the opposition defence at pace in an attempt to occupy the defenders and make space for their own backs.
The cabbie's voice cuts through their argument and they both turn around from where they were bent towards each other, to scowl at the cabbie.
Victor stalks forward, enraged and his arm readies to strike for a second time, but John's had quite enough.
And with that he steps back, spine ramrod straight as he does a military step around and makes the few feet to Sherlock's side, leaving Mycroft to fall to the floor with another pained cry.
Attempted non-con ( not between J & S and it's very brief and non explicit, but please be warned, to avoid triggers).
John hisses, and grabs Sherlock's hips in a brusing hold in order to control the pace and avoid penetrating the man by accident and hurting him. He proceeds to pull the detective back and forth with his arms, rutting his cock fast and faster between his arse cheeks until he's almost close to release. Sherlock is making small breathy moans, hands fisted against the door, forehead dropping against one arm and head trashing back and forth against it as if he can't take the pleasure anymore.
** Sherlock belongs entirely to John, A C-Doyle and Moftiss, I'm making no money on the back of these stories. Obviously.
..or he could push Sherlock against the door to their flat and proceed to fuck him senseless right then and there.
Speaking of direction, John's turned and turned the music off on his laptop, as well as the floating speakers. The DI's heard John complain about them before, apparently Sherlock's brought them in for an experiment. Looks like they're good for something.
John's turned around, making for the door before he turns his head slightly to throw some more words over his shoulder. Alright, he's entitled to some bloody showing off.
'Heard you talking about your kitchen, this little freak here used to dissect dead birds when we were at uni. Shared a dorm, the numbers of times he'd bring roadkill and such in, really, no wonder no one liked him - '
'No sweetheart, I want you to come just from this. Just from me.' Sherlock groans and puts his hands back against the door, head hanging low.
Sherlock groanes and begins his hands go to the front of his trousers, fumbling frantically before they manage to open, and then they're assisted by John in pulling the trousers down.
He'd shortly been whiskered away on a case which turned up to be pretty mild by Sherlock's standards, despite the fact that he'd forced John to traipse all around London on an empty stomach for the best part of the day, the prat.
Those normally icy shards are now molten like molassess, only a very thin ring of grey surrounding and being swallen up by his pupils.
The silence in the car is heavy like honey as they're eyeing each other up. Soon enough they'll be arriving at home, and John is thinking of the possibilities. He has two choices, either he could run up to his room as soon as he's out of the car...
Lestrade and Anderson shout and John can hear young Mark's worried cries for help but Sherlock is suspiciously silent and John's worried the murderer shot him. He needs to turn and check on the detective, but the killer is built like a beast and willful.
' -because if so, tell me, am I going to kill you by the end of the night? I'd say almost definitely!'
John's had enough. He smiles a thin, polite but sharp smile as he takes a sip of his wine, clearing his throat a little. He feels Sherlock's alarmed eyes on his face. Gerrick  raises a questioning eyebrow at John, Lisa watching on.
' I can do whatever I please, Mycroft. You're not the boss of me. If you care about it so much why don't you take it for yourself. I have no care for being caged in that fancy prison, doing nothing and being bored for the rest of my life. Ha, I've no desire to become a shrew like mu-'
'All right, gentlemen. I think it's best you two go home now. Uhm, I'll be coming around tomorrow or..or the day after, to take your statements but right now it's best you two go and wind down.'
"I said that's enough. Return to your table, I'll take it from here. Never touch this young man again."
tone has turned questioning so his eyes focus in and he hands the phone, who's display had turned black by now, back to her.
He's been battling his sexuality from the first moment he laid eyes on this brilliant man, but the last couple of weeks especially have been tenuous. Days and nights consistent of swatting down thoghts of plump lips, electric eyes, milky white thighs under a revealing blue slik gown. Nights of turning over in bed, of swiping on Tinder in the hope of finding an acceptable date to continue a life that he knows is a facade.
Interrupting the irate man, Sherlock snorts derisively and he cocks his head in a strange reptilian manner, to gaze at the date in question for only a fraction of a second. He looks at her from top to bottom so fast then takes a breath and straightens up. John looks on with baited breath, eyes flickering back and forth.
Lestrade guesses by the perplexed expression on Sherlock's face that this is quite unexpected. Clearly, John's playing this music and to be honest Lestrade wouldn't have thought John to be the type to listen to Rammestein. Lestrade himself only recognizes the band because of his angry teenage daughter, and the less said about that the better..
While stopping their side of the scrum from moving backwards, the props also support the hooker's body weight, allowing him or her to see and strike the ball when it is put into the scrum. In the lineout, props should be able to support or lift the jumper to prevent the opposition winning the ball.
John hums and purses his lips, fingers twitching around his mouth, supporting his face, tapping his cheek in that way he does without realizing when irritated, the more he listens to the bastard go on.
Sherlock giggles darkly from where he's sat with his head in John's lap on the sofa. John smiles, fingers carding through Sherlock's hair as they both remember the day Sherlock and Mycroft met Jane Watson, the Alpha of the Watson pack.
Greg and Donovan push the man out of the room, Donovan throwing him one last look which John doesn't understand, and Mark and Anderson still don't say anything as John bats at his clothes uselessly and makes his way over to Sherlock.
'And you DARE to show your face, today of all days. And you dare to lay your filthy hand on Sherlock. You fucking cockroach, Mycroft Holmes, you listen to me and listen well. If you ever, and I mean EVER, raise your hand at your brother again, if you even
Grabbing a hold of the copper's collar, he one handedly manages to pull the huge man from over and across Sherlock, and throw him half-way across the room. Pulse pounding in his temples, John ignores everything and stalks over to the giant form struggling to get up on the floor.
Soon people come knocking at the door, and John starts to feel a bit alarmed not only by the number of Holmeses, but also by the sickening shade of pale Sherlock's face takes by the time they're all seated.
John smirks and continuing to move his hips he also brings his left hand up to fist in those devilishly soft curls. Sherlcok gives a guttural moan and laughs shakily when his head is pulled back, long neck stretched and there for John to finally kiss and ruin with his mouth. Travelling up to lick at his jaw, ignoring the brat's attempt to turn his head and capture his lips, John strecthes up on his tiptoes to mouth at and breath over that pink, delectable ear and to whisper..
He almost wails, one hand slipping agaist the door and he has to catch himself. For his part, John's head feels hazy at the taste of them both combined. His cock twiches against his leg but he ignores it completely, focusing and lavishing all his attention on his detective.
John had almost  taken the train back to London but had forced himself to reconsider. He had no business behaving like a jealous fool, Sherlock was free to get with homever he liked. They weren't in a relationship..they haven't even kissed.
Linda, Lisa? leans across the table and shoves her phone in his face. John flinches and covers up by gently plucking the phone only to stare numbly in the eyes of a demon tabby. He takes the opportunity to wonder whether he'd picked up his laundry already or if he needs to stop by on his way home. He muses, probably too late for that now.
Sherlock gives a deep moan and opens his lips to John, who licks inside, tongue sliding wetly against the other man's. He grunts at the delicious feeling of it, the sweet, wet, warm taste of Sherlock. The feeling of his elegant hands, one fisted in his hair to keep his mouth fixed on his, the other on his arse, pushing him closer between his spread legs.
Sherlock takes a couple of hesitant steps, grimy face scrunched adorably. John can't help a fond smile. He's in trouble.
They both moaned in each other's mouth, lips still for a second as if just realizing they're finally kissing. Then they began to slide wetly and drag, to nibble and suckle. John broke away for a moment for a breath before licking Sherlock's upper lip..that damn lip has been driving him insane with the urge to kiss it since he'd first laid eyes on it.
Something feels out of place. The building is abandoned and derelict, and the murderer's spread evidence everywhere. Most of Greg's team is spread around, with only Anderson, Donovan and Anderson's assitant, a young boy named Mark, in the room with John, Sherlock and Greg.
'I leave you alone for one minute..' John half smiles, but it isn't really there. His eyes are glued to the purplish bruised on the detective's alabaster neck, and those swollen lips..
The consultive pain in the arse grunts as he finally pushes the door open and Lestrade was just about to open his mouth when it hits them and they all stop in their tracks.
From the looks and sounds of it, John understand why Sherlock and Mycroft hate the 'Christmas dinners'. It seems like the Holmes cousins aren't very nice at all. Not very nice no, they remind John of the wanker, Sebastian Wilkes.
John lunges across the room and twines his hand around the one holding the pistol, while pushing Sherlock behind and away with his other. The murderer shouts in agony but doesn't dessist and the two begin grappling around in a brutal dance of tight grasps, twists and punches.
John coughs and scratches at the back of his neck, arm muscles bulging as he does so. His abs tremble in time with this breath, and shorts seems to have slipped enough for his V cut to be seen.
Once back from the army, when his surgeon career had properly taken off John had made a proposal to invest in 221 Baker Street, as a way to partially repay Mrs. Hudson for all she'd done for him. He managed to convince her after some effort, and now the house is state of the art and they have joint ownership. All the flats, including C are elegant but modest and he's also bought the properties adjacent and behind 221, so they are now connected and there's more space.
Sherlock blinks and seems startled at  this, as if he can't imagine why in the world someone would smile at him. John's protective instincts rise again and his right hand tightens against the wheel to stop him from flying out the car to hug the young man.
'Well, seems like I'm finally meeting another Holmes who doesn't like to join the 'flock', so to speak.'
He tended to mask that side of himself, from early on as taught by his mother and her side of the family. And that was the arrow that drove a wedge between him and Harry, the fact that she's always been aware of something not quite right, of a secret being kept from her.
The music is even louder in here, bouncing off the walls and Lestrade can also feel it ricochet in his sternum. The sofa, armchairs and coffee table have been pushed and aligned by the wall, so there's some open space in the middle of the room. And John's on the floor, doing push-ups. Naked, one armed pushu-ps.
The haze still hasn't lifted form John's mind, it feels like he's in a dream. His movements are a bit slugglish and yet his body is still tense and ready to go in overdrive.
His right hand travels up to fist at the back of Sherlock's head, finally grasping hold of lusciousl curls. He thus pulls and Sherlock groans and tilts his head back, body automatically arching and pushing his cock even more against John's.
Lestrade relents and soon enough John and Sherlock find themselves in the back of a black sedan sent by Mycroft, squeezed very closely together.
Not needing to be told twice, John takes Sherlock by the hand and drags him away, towards the main road to catch a cab. They don't look back once, and so they have no idea that Mycroft was loaded in the ambulance to be carted to the hospital along with the little girl Sherlocks saved, or that the yarders were still mostly stuck in place, gaping at John's back, or that they'd attracted a bigger crowd, some of which were filming the whole thing.
Sherlock is pinned to the bed by Jack the new copper. The big man is straddling the detective on the bed, one hand clasped like iron on both of the detective's writsts, the other in his hair. Judging by the red blooming spots on the Sherlock's face, his swollen lips and the fact that as soon as John had burst in, Jack had lifted his face from Sherlock, the guy had been kissing him and thus muffling the defective.
Then, to make matters worse, of course there had to be a case, and a nine at that. Sherock's been a beast, focusing on the case with an intensity he's not seen in a while, and he knows that today's been affecting the detective as much as John. For that matter the doctor didn't chuck a sickie like he'd wanted to and went to work just to give them some space, but he didn't..couldn't have refused to accompany the detective on the case when a desperate Lestrade came running. Not today of all days.
John gulps, feeling stuck like a fly in a spider's web, heart rabbiting in his chest. He's helpless to even breathe, lost to the world and nothing else exists but those cat eyes and the way they're eyeing him up, promising to devour him whole.
A look at Sherlock from the corner of his eyes shows an expression Lestrade's never seen before on the young man's face.
But it's 3am now, and they're bone tired, all of them. There's too much ruckus, what with members of the yard running around shouting to each other, police lights flashing, the chatter of some stragglers attracted by the incident, the screams of the serial killer as he's being handcuffed and read his rights.
'So, Gerrick, you used to play sports?' John suddenly asks, overiding the prick's attempt at digging into Sherlock.
John turns his head. His baritone voice is like smooth, golden honey. If his eyes weren't so dilated, John thinks they could be green.
to cover with make up.  At a closer glance you can notice her clothes are creased and her, quite large, slumped and spilling bag contains a tube bagel wrapper, her last night dress and her prey's wallet which she happened to
' - no wonder the criminal population seems to be flourishing if the police have nothing better to do than kidnapping me.'
Gerrick smiles condescendingly, 'Well, there wasn't much we Holmes weren't good at, barring some exceptions,' he pauses slightly to glance at Sherlock meaningfully, 'I was quite enamoured with rugby and-'
WARNING Attempted non-con ( not between John and Sherlock and it's very brief and non explicit, only involves kissing mostly  but please be warned, to avoid triggers).
Best case ever. He must remember to thank Lestrade for hiring...and sacking that useless man, whatever his name was.
Loud music is playing from upstairs, so loud it seems like the walls are pulsing from the power of the bass.
Longish hair disheveled and sticking to his sweaty forehead, chest panting for breath John pushes Greg and Donovan away and turns towards the bed on which Sherlock still lays.
Lestrade's going to enjoy the hell out of hearing John's taken the Holmes brothers down a peg or two, in Russian.
He plucks the blue satin handkerchief out of his suit pocket and hands it to Sherlock, who takes it hesitantly and gently wipes at his nose. He ignores him when he hands it back.
Gerrick faltersa bit under everyoe's attention but he hasn't caught on and gives a little laugh, ignoring Lisa's touch on his arm and wary look.
Ever since Shelock's come back, Anderson's been behaving almost like a fan boy, and Sherlock doesn't want to admit it to John but the latter knows the detective is almost enjoying it. Sure, he still complains of Anderson's stupidity most of the times but not as much as before.
.' There's a desperation swirling in Sherlock's eyes and growing in his voice, and John's blood sings in his veins and they're almost touching from head to toe and he doesn't know when that happened.
Ten reps, twenty, followed by some back clap push ups later, John finally stands up and grabs a towel from the arm of the sofa.
John had meanwhile also dropped his, and he now places Sherlock's hands so that they're exended and flat against the door, and the clever detective gets the idea and leans over, pushing his delectable arse out towards John who groans at the sight.
John's not aware of anything else other than the tosser in front of him, who'd been the cause of their pain more often than not. To John, it still feels like Mycroft was the one who fed Sherlock to that wolf, Moriarty. And here he is, on this blasted day, hurting Sherlock again and making John want to grind him to a pulp. He's often wanted to, and now he's finally snapped. So John's not aware of anything else, he;s not aware that everyone's stopped what they were doing to watch the going ons. Lestrade, who was already making his way over to them, runs over and makes to interfere but Sherlock, still cupping his red cheek, stops him with an arm.
When the door to flat B slammed shut, so did Sherlock's body against it. He bent his knes slightly, automatically making it just slightly easier for John, who pressed both hands against the door on either side of Sherlock's face and his lips against his at the same time.
'Don't look at me like that, you tiny piece of shit.' John's aware this is really, really inapproptiate at the Christmas dinner table, but he's not entirely sure the way Sherlock's squeezing his hand is to stop him or encourage him and he's to incenssed to stop. He's donned his captain persona and that little prick needs a dressing down and proper training.
Then Sherlock moves, and John can't help but cry out, "NO! DON'T!", but his words are abruptly cut off when the door clangs shut. The lock clicking into place is horrendously loud.
Sherlock's lips pull back into a simile of a smile, "Hello Sergeant Donovan. As always, I'm here for you to make my day a little brighter. Your attempts at intelligence are always amusing."
After that, his awareness rose and fell in that same disjointed continuity of all dreams. His body never seemed to move, but time had surely passed. He would notice Sherlock’s hand against his cheek, tilting John’s face up to stare directly into his unfocused eyes. He caught the clipped ending of an argument that had occurred in some unknown span of time.
Irritation prickled up John’s neck. He wished for physical buttons that he could press with force instead of a flat screen he had to tap, ‘Sure, that’s why I’m texting you for a lark when I made it perfectly clear how much I don’t like you.’
When John is satisfied that all of them are incapacitated with pain, John turns around to attempt to comfort the woman. Maybe he can carry her to a hospital, have her send a message that these scum need medical care. She's staring at him in horror, which isn't new, but she's also pointing behind him and gaping like a fish.
His body and spirit still feel abused and worn, but he absolutely refuses to be broken. A new method of escape forms in John's mind, though it's hardly appealing. But he's a soldier, he can adapt.
Sherlock’s features tightened. His lips pressed together into a thin line. It was when he averted his eyes that John had his answer.
Thunder cracks like a schoolmarm snapping a ruler, aghast at his effrontery. With a wave of his hand and a sharp word, the living room is bubbled in silence.
John scrambled to turn over, and it wasn’t until he tried to reach for it that he remembered he’d thrown away his gun. The frustration, and even a little bit of fear, started to bubble up in his throat. He had walked into a group of drug dealers, had thrown his illegal firearm into some unknown junk heap, and dived into a thicket of shrubs all on the word of a teenager.  He was going to be beaten to death by a bunch of kids who were poor decision makers, all because he’d been bored and had desperately wanted to feel useful again.
Fuck. Fucking hell he's still beating himself up over how stupid he'd been, to even let her sit with him in the first place. John can't help that now. But he can do everything in his power to make sure that sweet woman will see another day. A very dangerous idea starts to take root in John's mind. He might be able to pull this off, or he's going to end up in deeper shit than before. Well, once more into the breach and all that.
“God! Not, not yet,” John moaned, his voice hoarse, “I just—need a bit more time. Like tomorrow. Or the next moon.”
"Nonsense," Sherlock says, almost ready to shove him inside of the flat, or at least give it a good try. For a creature that can eviscerate a dozen armed thugs, he's incredibly bashful about his own presence.
The man he is to interrogate is stripped close to naked, his white briefs being the only thing that separate complete nudity. He's dangling in mid air over the grated drain. His arms are pulled up over his head, and he's been there for a while, the strain in his face is indicative of that. His feet are tightly chained to the floor, making him completely immobile for Sherlock's work.
While John is struggling to find some semblance of stability, he wildly thinks that he can somehow still handle this. That the warmth of Sherlock’s tongue won’t drive him to madness, and that he can ignore the heaviness in his balls and his bladder if he simply tries hard enough. Maybe he can withstand the agony of denied release in both areas, and hold on until Sherlock is either satisfied or bored. But then Sherlock’s lips slide down his shaft and the sudden sucking makes John thrash and sob brokenly.
"And don't worry, you're not in the incompetent hands of a novice," Sherlock turns and walks slowly towards the screaming man, "I have had a lot of practice."
John stopped himself mid-tirade when he swung open the door. Sherlock was standing there with his finger firmly pressed against the doorbell button. His face swung up in pleased triumph, “Oh good, I knew it wasn’t brok--.”
John's eyes fly open, but he's not focusing on his reflection. He's focused on the monster in the long, black coat.
Yet all he could think about, was how much he would want to bring Sherlock with him. He would want to take Sherlock to those same places, show him all of his favorite stops, and then sit back and laugh as Sherlock railed on about the banality of tourist shops.
A few of the others joined in his mockery, while the leader just frowned from his table. Sherlock seemed to sway in place.
“Have you never won a fight before?” John couldn’t help but quip as they sped ahead. Sherlock was looking a little fatigued, but his long legs helped him keep pace. John knew it wouldn’t last for much longer.
"Look, again, I can't really fly I can just sort of-" John's cut off by surprise when Sherlock practically launches himself at him.
He walked past them, and resisted the urge to shove them aside. Perhaps because it would be a petty and juvenile move, when he was trying to appear well-reasoned, but victimized. Or perhaps he still saw a Jim smiling at him while blood dripped down his face, or a Sherlock whose eyes could glow with cold fury while two beaten and pitiable men fled for their lives, and maybe these recalled images still inspired a bit of fear.
“I was a bit distracted by the collapsed teenager on my medical table. But yes, I do remember now. So, how exactly are we going to stop them? And I still say we should go to the police.”
John was rolled over onto his front. He felt Sherlock’s weight drape across his naked back. Sherlock still remained clothed, but the evidence of his eagerness pressed against the small of John’s back.
He clutched the paper hard enough that it made a loud crackle. There was still no disturbance from the bed, and John had the fleeting thought to be grateful that Jim slept far sounder than his husband.
Sherlock motioned his head for John to follow him. “This way, I don’t want to be stopped by the other patrons.”
With Sherlock occupying his mouth, Jim satisfies himself with gentle nips on all of the exposed shoulder he can reach. The combined mouths send John spinning. He's caught in the indecision of who to touch, though it's not like he has much choice, with his hands trapped behind his back. He clenches his fists, but even the bite of his fingernails does nothing to ground himself. He's floating in his own body, riding a wave of endorphins headier than anything John's ever felt.
Sherlock heaved a deep breath and hummed a low note, releasing the energies from their manipulated form.
His crew was shouting excitedly, crowded around the mast of the ship. He pushed his way through the crowd, the shouts and laughter of the crew falling quiet as they became aware of his presence. He elbowed his way to the middle of the crowd, taking in the sight that lay before him.
As time went on, John found himself falling further and further in love with the strange Sherlock Holmes. He started doing research, hoping to find something that could help him be with Sherlock.
"J-John?" Something passed over they boy's face, a hint of sadness in his steel eyes as he rubbed the back of his neck.
“Shit!” He cursed, grabbing the rope for his mainsail and swinging around the mast, using the weak gravity caused by the storm to his advantage. He leaped onto the edge of his boat just as it was threatening to capsize, pulling the rope tight and leaning back, turning the boat sharply.
"I-I read that it- th-there are things- I-I just-" Sherlock sighed shakily, and John leaned in to kiss the boy again, feeling how tense his boyfriend was. "I-I don't want to do something wrong." John kissed Sherlock again before pulling the lanky boy in for a hug.
When Sherlock came to a few hours later, John had managed to clean up most of the blood and disposed of the bodies of Fate and Moriarty. He was watching as Sherlock started to stir and was by his side as soon as his eyes opened. He checked Sherlock over as he waited for the man to get his bearings.
It was his first date with Sherlock, three days after the boy had asked him out, and John was both nervous and excited. He had never taken another boy out before, much less someone as posh as Sherlock Holmes, and he didn't want to mess it up. Harry would probably kill him if he did.
It wasn't that he wished to be in her shoes, John didn't want him like that and Sherlock was fine with it, he hated the thought of John taking his pleasure from someone else. He didn't like sharing.
He stayed by Sherlock’s bedside, checking his lungs and pulse several times an hour. He found the bag Sherlock had with him when he found him and pulled out the leather-bound book he saw in there. It was a copy of The Hobbit. He smiled as he opened the pages. He decided to read to the young man, hoping it would stimulate brain function.
"Yeah, I got that bit." Sherlock gasped as John rubbed their hips together. "I mean, do you want to- all the way? I'll uh- I'll have to go find lube or something-"
“What are you talking about Love?” Victor grabbed his elbow and tried to drag him towards the bathroom. Panic gripped him as the memory became clearer. “Come on, let’s get you cleaned up.”
"John!" Sherlock's voice came from behind the officer, who glanced back before stepping aside, letting John through.
The voice in his head kept it’s promise, never letting himself succeed in taking his life again. He hated the reasoning that it used.
When they were a few hours outside of E2, John pulled the Star Sailor to a stop, and started rooting through his bags.
John was shocked out of his thoughts by his phone ringing. He really needed to remember to change the ringtone.
“Oh, I know that. I never had any intention of keeping you. I just needed to give Sherlock the motivation to come save you. I couldn’t control you if I wanted to.” Moriarty gripped John’s hair tightly and yanked his head back, pulling a yelp of pain from the broken man. “But I will enjoy making Sherlock pull you apart.” John laughed painfully, feeling involuntary tears slip from the corners of his eyes.
“Oh. You should have woken me sooner. I have filming in an hour.” John swallowed the flare of jealousy and ran his hand through his hair.
“Tell me, Captain Watson, have I behaved to your satisfaction tonight?” John bit his lip against the whimper that threatened to fall from his lips. He nodded gently, already starting to squirm. “Excellent. I think it is about time we took our leave.” The younger man sucked lightly on John’s ear, sending a spark of arousal along his spine. “Well, as pleasurable as this has been, my doctor is insisting I get plenty of rest. We shall be taking our leave now.” Sherlock pushed John off his chest, standing and dragging the shorter man to his feet.
Sherlock parted his lips and sighed as he felt John's tongue slip into his mouth. He gasped and shuddered when John threaded his fingers in his hair, not tugging, simply cradling his head as he sucked on Sherlock's bottom lip, pulling another helpless whimper from the boy.
As he neared, he could hear the cries of men and see the flickering torches surrounding the castle doors.
“Oh, I was going to say French Fry grease. I think I like your idea better.” John giggled, wincing as the surrounding people shushed him. “Stop that. You’re going to get us kicked out.” He scolded, the harshness of his tone dampened considerably by the grin on his lips.
Moriarty had turned John so he could watch the first sun setting, re-positioning his body so that while his arms were still trussed above his head, he was kneeling on the cold floor. There was a reason for the position change, of course. Moriarty had broken John’s knee and was forcing him to bend the ruined joint.
"John, it's fine. They don't care, trust me." John nodded, cupping Sherlock's cheek softly and kissing him sweetly. "I love you."
The wolf that was on top of him was ripped off his chest, sent flying with an unpleasant shriek and a sickening crunch. Sherlock caught sight of his saviour as his vision faded away.
“You’ll have to let me investigate that one day.” He mumbled as he wiped his mess from Sherlock’s chest and stomach. The Siren laughed, touching his jaw and pressing a soft kiss to his lips.
“Yeah, I don’t know what got into him. I’ve never seen anything like that before, I’m a little worried to be honest. He is never like that.” Sherlock felt a spark of concern start to pool in his gut. “Is everything alright with you two?” This time, Sherlock did drop the beaker. By some miracle, Lestrade managed to catch it. “You okay?”
“Please, Sherlock. I know it didn’t go so well the last time, but that was twenty years ago. And now you have me.”
Sherlock closed the gap instantly, pressing a firm, deep kiss to his boyfriend's mouth, his body burning at the shocked sound that escaped John's throat.
They slid to the floor, a tangle of limbs and sweat as the giggled breathlessly into each other's neck.
One day, after nearly a month of being home, John came back from wherever it was he would disappear to and Sherlock decided he had had enough.
He was jolted out of his thoughts by The Beast entering the room again. He looked excited, practically bouncing as he came to a stop by Sherlock’s bed.
The toaster popped, startling them both. Sherlock yelped, his feet tangling in the sheet as he tried to stumble away. John watched in shock as the taller boy crashed to the ground, not able to process what was happening for several seconds.
“I never mentioned the torture.” He whispered, his voice soft and timid. John smiled sadly and sat back on his heels, grabbing his Med Bag and pulling out the set of ID tags he kept there and handing them to the siren. Sherlock read the tags, looking back at John with understanding and pain in his eyes.
“Please tell me you didn’t watch our tape?” Sherlock sounded disgusted, his face turning a bright red as he glared at his brother.
"That whole book is about bees?" John sounded amazed, not angry or frustrated like Victor used to, and Sherlock fought down a happy grin. "Jesus, how much information could there possibly be?"
Something was wrong, John could practically feel the tension pouring off his boyfriend as they sat across from each other in the small café.
“No! No, don’t do this. Please don’t, not now. I just got rid of you!” John felt panic in his chest at the image before him. He had been seeing Sherlock everywhere since he found out the Siren had died. The voice in his head talking to him and making him see his dead friend’s ghost.
"What did I say about patience, Sherlock?" John growled, pushing into the detective's body slowly, his mind spinning with arousal at the sensation. "F-Fuck- I told y-you-" he paused as he slid inside Sherlock fully, biting his lip against a groan, "I told you I-I would fuck you." Sherlock whimpered, shifting his hips slightly and glaring weakly up at John, his cheeks and chest flushed and lips swollen from where he had been chewing on them. "God Love, you're bloody perfect-"
"So do you." John pressed a kiss to his temple and pulled back slightly, smiling fondly. "So, what do you want to watch tonight? I downloaded Doctor Who and Game of Thrones, as well as that Supernatural show I keep hearing about, so you have lots to chose from." Sherlock smiled, because of course John would go above and beyond to make him happy, and leaned down, pressing a firm kiss to his boyfriend's lips.
"Call John, tell him I can't make it." Sherlock blinked away tears of guilt and shame at the thought of bailing on his boyfriend.
"J-J- Daddy, f-fuck Daddy please-" His own erection was aching and leaking against his stomach, begging for some of the pressure to be relieved.
He pulled out his Star Guide, taking a seat on the end of the boat and hanging one of his feet off the edge, trying to figure out where he was. The last of the three suns had finished setting, and the brighter stars were making themselves known in the inky blackness.
He softly licked at the insides of John’s mouth, tasting John’s tongue and tracing over his teeth. John moaned underneath him, and Sherlock felt him buck his hips in sharp demand. Sherlock grinned wickedly, before he softly bit John’s tongue.
John sighed and closed his eyes. He already knew he was an arse, but he was slowly beginning to see that it wasn’t a recent development.
For a few moments, John was so stunned he was entirely without words. “What could you possibly mean by that?”
The door to the greenhouse was unlocked as always, and the constant warmth was a blessed relief on his extremities. His face felt damp from sweat and steam, and he hoped it wouldn’t freeze when he was forced to step outside again.
The reasoning behind this new development became as clear and sudden as a light switch, and John huffed a laugh. He pushed himself as far back into the pillows as he could, and looked Sherlock in the eye while he smiled,
“I’ve had a very unpredictable and long night Moriarty. And recent developments have progressed quite unexpectedly.”
John smiled at him. He felt as though he should reassure his patient husband that the wait would likely be a short one, when his attention was caught by another part of the greenhouse.
In the signature section he read the names ‘James A. Moriarty’ and ‘Violet G. Smith’. The date placed it at twelve years ago. John kept his breathing steady. Underneath it was the contract entitling Moriarty to all of Ms. Smith’s funds and assets. There was no documentation of a divorce paper.
John sets the mug to the side, breathes in deeply, puts his palms on his thighs and starts with, “I woke up in pain.”
John tries to pull down, to shift the abrasive material against his skin, but he stays damnably put. He leans up into Sherlock's brief caress on top of his head, and whimpers when it's suddenly pulled away. The footsteps leave his side, and John speaks without meaning to, "Sherlock. Sherlock, please. Don't leave. I'm sorry."
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock asked as he went to his husband’s side, “Your episode caused quite the stir within the household today. You couldn’t be roused for anything. Jim even tried to ride into town to fetch the physician. Thankfully the butler persuaded him to have the carriage prepared instead. Moriarty is awful on horseback.”
“Indeed the Detective Inspector told me about the return of our enemies, yes. Though I did have previous knowledge that Lord Moran was in the vicinity.” John’s face tightened, his eyes darkening. Sherlock growled.  “Calm yourself, there was no reason to alert you to his presence and besides our Mender has known of his presence for some time.” He said dismissively, looking as if he were bored by the conversation.
"Sherlock, You promised." Lestrade said sternly, hands clenched at his sides. "You don't even know what the case is." The familiar sound of stress and tension in Lestrade's voice almost made John laugh. The poor man, Sherlock never cut him a break.
"Wait, what's this?" Kitty asked grabbing John's hand. She laughed. "Oh isn't that precious. He gave you a ring? No," She gasped incredulously. "What are you two going to be consulting husbands now?!" She giggled and ripped the ring off John's finger, finally garnering a response for him. He struggled trying to get it back. "Oh look, he does care." She growled and punched him in the right side of his face, reopening the wound from earlier. "It's mine now." She slipped it on her thumb, ignoring the blood. "Only ten hours left Johnny boy, then it's your curtain call."
“It is… Too late…” John winced as Mycroft tried to move him. He reached up and tried to brush away a tear from Sherlock’s cheek. “S fine... You are… Safe.” He shouted in pain as Greg tried to lift him. “I… I love you.”
"But I don't want to... I can't afford to make another mistake." His eyes were glassed over, so much pain.
The two of them showered together and then dressed, returning to the living room just in time to hear a knock on the door. Greg was in the kitchen and the kettle had just finished boiling. John let Mrs. Hudson and Molly in, both of them carrying trays of pasties. They set everything down and greeted the boys warmly, before they all settled around the dining room table with tea and breakfast.
"I'm going to go upstairs myself. I believe my son asked for my attention and I'll have better luck in my mind palace if I don't have you two staring at me." He teased and Molly just shook her head.
When John returned to the living room their bags were in the doorway. The flower arrangement Sherlock had gotten him was on the coffee table, the one from Mrs. Hudson was on the kitchen dining table, and the other two were on the long formal dining table. John blushed and Sherlock grinned.
"It has." His lover conceded, his mouth sliding across John's jaw and down onto his shoulders, his tongue putting just enough pressure on the love bite there to make John arch. "My mind can't stop, but I have been woefully neglectful of you and our son. I mean to remedy that as soon as this case is closed." The tongue pressed in again and John softly cried out.
“You’ve figured something out.” He whispered into those dark curls, nuzzling his mouth towards Sherlock's ear, blushing some but ignoring the others for the moment.
"You have worn it every day for the whole of your life, the very idea it could come off was impossible." Sherlock wanted to press kisses all over him, to cuddle him, and swaddle him in warmth and love, but he knew from watching others go through this, that touch might be the last thing John wanted. He was surprised when John leaned forward and curled against him. He wrapped his arms gently around his husband and held him.
Sherlock just let himself go and he grew more determined and needy with each kiss he pressed against John's mouth. He shoved his fingers against the buttons on his shirt, pulling at them and growling in frustration when they resisted his work. John groaned the pure desire and love radiating off Sherlock and threatening to drown him if he stopped kissing the detective, but he also felt his heart pounding against his rib cage. He was terrified Sherlock would suddenly stop again, that he was going to restrain himself once more. John felt himself completely dissolve into the moment despite the fact that it was all so very sudden and oh so very needy, because he needed it just as much. And that was them wasn't it? All fumbling and bad timing, finding a lead on a case or out running a bad guy, and suddenly needing the other, suddenly desiring to share that adrenaline with the other half of themselves. This time there was no stopping it though and the kisses they were sharing were sending them both tumbling head first into dangerously inviting territory. Sherlock didn't even push his shirt all the way off when he finally got it unbuttoned; he was too much in a hurry to actually touch John's skin. Instead he slipped his hands under it to trace over the lines of his chest both of them moaning loudly as those cool fingers pressed into his warm flesh. John's mind went blank with need and he undid Sherlock's shirt using it to pull him back slightly, both of them panting hard.
"I have to go to Baker Street. Now." Sherlock looked around. "Where is it?" He demanded, dancing around the room.
"Oh God..." John's voice cracked as tears leaked free. Sherlock understood instantly that John had been locked in a nightmare of dread; one that told him Sherlock might not be alive. A memory of the last time they’d stretched their hands out to one another and only one of them went home. He could only imagine the intense emotion that had been trapped inside John’s heart and mind for two days."You're okay..." He whispered meekly.
"Captain John, I demand you keep these safe. You are as always the only one whom I can trust with such essential items. One day you and I will become pirates and we will sail the world together as we were meant to. For now I have decided I will become a detective as you once suggested I do. They did not listen to us but If I can prove that King Izzod did not murder King James then we shall be allowed to be friends again. I don't know if this will truly make it to you, but Prince Croft assures me Lady Georgina is trustworthy. I am loathe to confess this but I miss you terribly. I have tried to learn more about you, but I have failed despite my best efforts. I know I
The next chapter will be smut and fluff while the epilogue will set up the Kid!Lock I will eventually write that will go back and explain everything that happened the summer the Pirate Prince and the Captain met.
Please note this store does contain an original backstory made by me which includes characters I created and modifications/additions to canon characters. It also includes mention of hate crimes and homophobia. This chapter isn't very graphic with only a little smut but it's building darkness for the coming days.
“My brother has always been capable of intense affection, though he had restricted himself from it after… Well since he was a child.” Mycroft added as they all piled back into the car.
"We have the car ready down in the ambulance area. Less of them can get in that way. If you're ready we can go." John made sure he had packed everything in the bag Sherlock was carrying and then nodded.
"Yes. I will try to make it short and to the point as we're all trying to work against time. This all boils down to a crime of hatred and I believe deep down misunderstood communications and the belief that what one person believes is the best for all. You two know by now that all of us belong to the Order of Serpents and Scepters. You also know that Sherlock was approached to join and declined membership. He was allowed to do so only because of his father's contributions. You, John, were never approached because your father has tarred your name and thus put a black mark against your family. Once you had proven yourself to be especially honorable and a worthy candidate for us you were inseparably bound to Sherlock and it was decided that his opinion on the Order would likely sway you from a positive impression of us. The Order minds their own business about the private lives of members, so long as whatever activities they choose to be a part of do not draw unwanted or ill fitting attention to the Order or the member themselves. Because of that it was of no important to the Order that James Pendergrass was gay, nor that his lover Uthur Argyle was a member of the chapter in Switzerland."
son keeping secrets." He smirked, his eyes flashing with possessiveness and inspiring indecent thoughts to obliterate John's train of thought. John coughed slightly and looked away, blushing a bit. Hamish was being a bit restless in Sherlock's arms, but he sat up suddenly and looked at them both.
, to poison you?" His words were so... So full of emotion that it deflated John's anger and disarmed him. Their eyes locked as words poured free of both of them.
“Certainly. Where is Gregory? I have not seen him about the manor for a few days.” John’s voice was conversational as he returned to his work, not saying anything when Mycroft’s hand came to rest on his thigh.
When she left the room and entered the hallway a hand clamped over her mouth and she was shoved back into the wall of the dark hallway. She was surprised when she looked up to see Sherlock glaring down at her, possessiveness shining in his eyes. When he was sure she would remain quiet he slowly removed his hand, glancing quickly towards the stairs before back to her.
"Are there any other secrets you haven't told me?" He growled, leaning down so his restricted erection pressed into those blushing cheeks.
"Sherlock... God... I cannot stop." John grunted, his eyes glazed over. They'd been wrapped together for what felt like days but the fire in John's blood would not be calmed.
“Where my mate goes, I go.” John conceded and turned back to Mycroft with a glare. “I hereby rescind your permission to touch me.” He growled, and his necklace flashed once.
“We must, for our own wish to harm us.” James said quietly, bowing his head but smirking at the state of the mender before him. Sherlock frowned, looking down at the beaten man and beginning to feel something pulsing in his chest. The man shuddered violently and Sherlock was sure tears were falling.
"I believe the opposite is true, my little love. I believe that he cares deeply for you and yet does not want to give you more torment by having you torn between us. I shall endeavor to be better, John. I do not want you hiding in the thatch any more. I want you to return to me and allow me to help you through the sea of your emotion. I am not the best at it, but I wish to try for you." He leaned down and claimed John's mouth in a gentle kiss, tightening his hold on him until their bodies were flush together. John shivered as his emotion tried to break free and Sherlock kept kissing him until he felt John melt into the comfort of their embrace.
"It's exactly like he said. She believes herself to be the John to Moriarty's Sherlock. She thought he loved her, I'm guessing he played it along wanting to have someone he could use. She was already there on the edge of all the reporter groups that came along wherever we went. I think that she thinks she is more than she actually is. But she's well hidden, there is no way to draw out this game than to play. It's a game of chess that started years ago." John said it meaningfully and was rewarded with just a slight flush of color on Sherlock's cheeks.
“Yes love, there you are. Use my fingers to gain your own pleasure.” John crooned, groaning as Sherlock ground down on the two fingers inside of him.
"And I think he has a point about Baker Street, whether we'd like to admit it or not." John's voice was growing more tired.
"You're wrong." His tone made her growl and she stepped towards him. It made Sherlock tense and the sight of John's blood on her was not helping his calm demeanor. "It is not too late for him, but it is for you."
The man led John to the coven house, taking him in a back door and up a hidden staircase. When they entered the room John saw Anna writhing in pain on her bed. He dashed over to her, taking her hand and beginning to search his kit for something to help her. He worked quickly and within a few moments she began to calm, her breathing slowing. However as soon as he eyes beheld him she paled with fear.
“Do not be ashamed, my love.” Greg’s voice was terribly soft from beside him. “You needed that, he needed that. Only a fool could not have seen it.” Mycroft looked up at him, concern flooding his face but Greg simply smiled on. He reached for Mycroft’s hand. “Let him rest now.”
"I never started having lovers, you were my first friend and so easily taken from me. How could I chance giving my heart to someone... Well if I'm being completely honest to someone else, but I was seven. I didn't know anything about love." He sighed, his shoulders tense from the battle that still waging in his mind between emotion and rationality. "We saw what happened, we told them what we saw, and they still took you from me. Still they didn't believe us. I was powerless and you know how much I
"Oh... If you keep going I'm going to have to abandon my little experiment." Sherlock's voice was husky and full of arousal against his ear. John could feel the heat burning off of him. "And I have four days to torment you. I don't want to waste myself in one go."
"I know he does." Sherlock turned to him with surprise on his face. "But Sherlock, it's a Dom sign. You're not in that culture anymore." He sighed. "You two think you're really clever don't you? You think we don't see what you two do, but we all see it. Watch him, really watch him. The moment he thinks no one is looking he'll reach up and run his finger over it." Sherlock kept his body turned towards Lestrade, continuing to give the impression they were talking. Meanwhile the therapist had walked away from John and he was standing there alone. It took about a minute before he slowly reached up and gently ran one finger over the love bite, a faraway look in his eyes. It was very brief however as the therapist returned and started talking to him again.
They arrived at Mycroft's large, well maintained estate and were driven around the back. The guest house was a two bedroom, single level building situated near a rather scenic pond quite some distance from the house. There was a single drive up to the house and a single sidewalk leading from it to the house. A small garden situated to one side and an entire air of separation from the main house. John raised an eyebrow looking at Sherlock as the car pulled to a stop. They got out of the car and Sherlock unlocked the door.
John and Sherlock solve their first case (without much effort) and John learns a deeply painful lesson about whom to trust. A lesson that just may break him.
"Yes. Georgina knew and she agreed to marry James because his family did not support his lifestyle. She didn't mind as long as she got to be with him and be comfortable. They loved each other dearly and had a good life together. Do not have any anger about that." Jacob scolded him.
"Good morning to you as well," Mycroft's voice was loud enough John could hear it. "I'm on my way to discuss arrangements with you. I'll be there in about twenty minutes."
"Not wrong, but I wasn't done." He replied sternly. "And because I know that you have been going insane planning this out. For ten months you've been working on planning this exact moment. The only difference is that I gave you more incentive during our last case. You watched me studying the travel brochures when I thought we might go away for our anniversary and you picked the one that I kept coming back to. You rented the cottage several months ago and got Mycroft to promise to watch Hamish... Since then you purchased the rope, a new riding crop, the blindfold, four pairs of handcuffs, three new types of lubricant, and spent enough time on the internet watching questionable material to enhance your knowledge that you're lucky our son hasn't caught you." The huff of air that left Sherlock's lungs betrayed his pleasure.
"I... I cannot handle anymore, please John, please stop!" Sherlock gasped, his body felt like it was fire. Every touch burning as the pleasure bled away and became pain.
"Oh Lord, Lestrade. You took his files? Are you trying to kill me?" Sherlock clicked his tongue, not appreciating the joke. "He'll be bored to tears in five," John's voice contained a smirk but Sherlock spoke over him.
"It's been two years," John protested weakly, his eyes betraying how much he wanted to say yes. How much he knew it would hurt Mary but how his heart begged for everything Sherlock was offering him.
will?" Mycroft barely breathed as he leaned over John to inhale the scent coming off of him. He pressed his nose gently against the crease of his neck, groaning. John groaned softly himself, the power of Mycroft's need cutting off the rationality of his thought.
"I have not had time to train him! What purpose does it serve? He has no need of his vampiric abilities with me, Mycroft. I do not intend for him to ever be in a situation where they are required." His voice was dark, because he truly believed he was all John needed to remain safe.
Six dark months passed and each night brought nothing but more disappointment and heart ache. John stood still as stone in the silence that settled around him, as it did many nights when he retreated to the solace of the library. He could not stand to stay in his and his husband's chambers, far too pained by the memories that he knew Moriarty was stripping away from his loves mind. He sank down on the sofa far in the back of the library, out of sight of the door and closed his eyes - hoping that this time his dreams would be empty. As he slept however his mind brought him to his favorite place as a child - to the forest near his adopted parents’ home. The one where he'd spent so many hours writing things he'd learned about herbs, vampires, and his heritage.
"That's what I thought before." John tried to fight the sob that was threatening to break free but he couldn't. Sherlock held him as tightly as he could, feeling his body shake with the emotion and tears that threatened to pull him back into darkness. He had an odd look on his face as he had to admit that he didn't know what to do for John in this moment. He didn't know the right words to say, the perfect touch to give, or the motion to make. He felt his own face tighten as he tried not to give in to the full sway of his own emotions but tried to give himself the space to feel and not think. He held John a bit tighter, trying to convey his support to him through silent touches but felt the moment John tried to bottle his feelings back up. A maneuver he'd seen John use time and time again.
Above them Sherlock tensed, he'd just dropped one of the snipers and Mycroft's words fluttered to him. His heart panicked, Mycroft was bluffing wasn't he? Surely he didn't mean that. Surely the elder Holmes wasn’t that cruel… Fear and panic flooded John, desperation betraying itself in his eyes. There was no way this could be possible could it? Certainly Sherlock would never agree to that? Sherlock could see the reactions on John’s face clearly and it worried him. If John thought the wrong thing he might do something incredibly stupid.
“What of my fear of losing you?” Sherlock’s voice was soft, gentler than it had been in some time. “You always consent to ignore the danger to yourself for my betterment. You are my light in this world, my guide. What is it that allows you to so carelessly toss yourself aside?” He held John’s chin so he could not look away. “Without you, I am naught.”
"Mycroft," They both grumbled at the same time, still very sleepy. Sherlock fumbled on the nightstand for his phone before hitting the button to answer the call. "What do you want?" He asked in a voice thick with sleep and annoyance. John's phone stopped ringing.
“Very well, summon James and let us be on our way. Then clean up this mess.” He growled as he swept away to prepare himself.
directly so I may ensure you are well kept and happy.” He leaned forward a bit, his mouth just apart from John’s. John felt how Sebastian’s aura pushed down on his own, how easy it would be for Sebastian to simply overpower him. “I will always protect you
"What about the rest of it?" His voice was timid as he spoke, afraid of how Sherlock would react. "How Mycroft used the fact that Stamford knew us both, how he set us up to become flatmates?"
and beg you to keep it safe so I will know you when I find you again. I have decided that I shall become a doctor as well as a soldier - that way if we ever again encounter the Beast I can save the victim. That I shall possess the knowledge that would have saved us this distance in the beginning. So that we shall never again be separated. I understand how terribly difficult it must have been for you to confess such sentiment when you told me before loyalty was all you needed, but you should know I still feel the same as I did. Those words whispered in the rain in the forest have not changed. I look forward to the day we meet again, always yours John." John's eyes were glassed over and Sherlock was utterly a wreck, betraying far too much emotion all at once. It was actually slightly disturbing to Greg and Mycroft how much he was unrestrained in this moment.  "But John never heard back from Prince Erik, he couldn't even be sure the letter made it to him after all he didn't trust Prince Croft as much as Erik did. But something even better happened, though John didn't know it at the time. One day, six years ago Captain John took a chance and followed an old friend into a lab where he met the now grown up detective Sherlock Holmes." Hamish let out a happy sigh from where he was snuggled deep under a blanket in John's lap.
Hours passed and Moriarty took his fill from the menders broken, ragged body. He cut him to watch him bleed, forced his own erection into him without preparation, watched as he writhed in pain even as he moaned for more, and preceded to violate the mender's body in every way possible until he was bored. He snapped and a blonde woman and a man resembling Sebastian appeared.
“In the spring I think we should look at finding a home of our own. Things are changing so rapidly in the world, I want to see more of it. We could move further into the heart of the city.”
"Just a man would not have pulled you out of that room so fast even I did not see you move, brother. Come now do not be silly, tell me the truth. Is it true, that look on your face? Do you believe him to be your mate? Are you still looking for something so trivial as that?" Mycroft's voice was teasing and Sherlock growled again.
Sherlock has too much energy so the two set off to see if there are any clues left at Pendergrass Estate, what they find provides them more information than they expected and sends Sherlock a little off the deep end.
"I honestly thought she would have remained distant. It was a misinterpretation of her motives. It will not happen again." He said it dismissively, tilting his head slightly.
"I believe Sebastian is trying to repay me by protecting my family since I saved his. I believe he will honor it and he will do his best to control Moriarty."
"Why did you take it?" The pain in his voice was what Sherlock latched onto, slowly looking up to meet his eyes. John's eyes betrayed the deep pain he was feeling, the utter betrayal.
Sherlock returned to the manor late that evening, content that the events of the evening had been delicately managed and the guilty party sufficiently explained. He knew Moriarty would worm his way out of punishment. His excuse had been that one of his servants explained the herb would help vampires enjoy normal food more than they already did. Elizabeth had taken the explanation at face value and forgiven him, but Moran and Sherlock knew otherwise. Lord Moran promised to find out what Moriarty's intentions had been and Sherlock believed him. The anger the man held for the fact that John was a target was enough to both enrage his jealousy and to soothe his worry about Moriarty. Sherlock opted to walk down the hallway near Mycroft's room in order to be sure his beloved was taken care of and was surprised when he saw John leaving Mycroft's room, still trembling but otherwise seemingly alright. He smiled as John looked up at him, shakily pulling a dressing gown around himself.
They passed the rest of the evening in this manner, Mycroft not daring to do more than keep his hand on the mender while he worked and their conversation flowing easily. Mycroft could easily glean that whatever evils Sherlock felt Mycroft had committed on the mender, the mender had either forgiven him or did not see it the same. Mycroft walked John to his chambers and gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek goodnight, please to see how the mender blushed before entering the room. Mycroft continued this way for two more days and on the sixth day of Sherlock’s brooding, he decided to reclaim what was his.
“Mike, I can’t stay.” John finished tying down the last of his supplies, looking up at his friend and offering him a soft smile before standing. “I can’t be around here anymore. Not after this. I can’t stand to see the pity in everyone’s eyes.” He pulled Mike in for a hug, feeling his long-time friend tremble against him.
"You. Please John- fuck me, please." John smirked and lowered his lips to meet Sherlock's collarbone.
“No. We are almost to your flat, then you need to rest.” Sherlock protested, nuzzling his face against John’s neck and sucking on the skin there. John pushed him off gently and helped him out of the now-stopped cab. “Do you have your keys?”
John's chest tightened in panic at the thought that he was boring the beautiful boy, and glanced around the restaurant, not seeing the owner. He reached across the table and grabbed Sherlock's hand, smirking mischievously at the confused boy.
"Sherlock, look at me." He shook his head, wiping a tear off his cheek. A hand gripped his elbow, trying to turn him around. "Sherlock please-" John spun him, pulling a gasp from the taller boy as he was crowded back against the mirror. Sherlock tilted his head back, trying to hide the bruise that Anderson had left on his chin. "Christ Babe, did he-"
A new man poked his head into the room, waving at John and Molly before turning his attention to Sherlock.
"Remind me again why I let you convince me to come tonight?" Mycroft groused, fighting with his tie again. Sherlock rolled his eyes and grabbed at the offending piece of clothing, swatting his brother's hands away and tugging the tie off. "Sherlock-"
A massive ship, built to resemble the Pirate ships of old was looming in the distance, heading straight for them.
The dance was stunning, both Harry and her partner moving in perfect sync across the stage. John spent the entirety of the song with his eyes glued to the boy, watching as he danced gracefully across the stage. He felt his chest tighten and his face burn when, at the end of the song, the boy lifted Harry over his head with surprising ease, holding her there for several seconds as the music stopped and the crowd erupted into applause. The boy lowered Harry and the pair bowed before they left the stage, the boy's composure never waning even though John could see the glee in his little sister's eyes.
After Sherlock made a third nurse cry, John insisted that they let him take the young man home. He showed his credentials and convinced the staff that he was more than capable of handling the petulant man on his own.
"And bring your friend! Your father wants to meet him." Sherlock groaned and fell backwards, covering his face with the blanket.
"How many of them have you fucked eh? The whole team? Or is it just Watson and Lestrade?" Sherlock felt his cheeks darken as he struggled against the other boy. "The whole school thinks you're a slag, you know. Everyone knows you let the Captain of the rugby team pass you around like some group fuck toy-"
Sherlock held his gaze for nearly a minute before blushing and looking away, fussing with the menu. Mycroft felt a swell of pride and grinned, reaching his foot under the table to nudge at Sherlock's.
"Do you think that maybe one day you would want me like that?" John shrugged, rolling onto his back and tugging Sherlock close to his side.
“You can kiss me whenever you please John. If you recall, I did say you can fuck with me whenever you please.” He winked before passing his hand over the watch, the world suddenly coming into harsh focus, pulling the air from John’s lungs once more. He felt a stabbing pain in his chest and dropped to his knees, fighting the darkness that threatened to claim him.
“Don’t care.” Sherlock started pulling at John’s shirt, tugging it up and over his head, letting it catch on his wrists. John felt his wrists being raised above his head and gasped as Sherlock snagged his shirt on a hook above his head. He whimpered as Sherlock moved his mouth down to his shoulder, sucking and biting at his bullet wound.
The Beast snarled, stepping closer to Sherlock and baring his teeth. Sherlock cowered slightly, but stood his ground.
"What do you mean? It's clearly a Daddy kink, what is there to discuss?" John chucked, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.
When the song ended and Sherlock had made his way off-stage, the rest of his troupe gathering around him and chattering excitedly. They all insisted that he had won the competition for the team, and as happy as he was with the dance, he found himself faking smiles.
“Wake up.” The body didn’t respond, still muttering nonsense. “Wake up!” He shouted, shaking the man on the floor. “Please! You have to wake up!” Pale eyes opened to meet his own.
“I need you John, and I’m going to take you. Then, after I’m done with you here, we are going to go home, and you are going to take me.” John whined as Sherlock bit gently on one of his nipples, bucking his hips against his lover’s and pulling a deep groan from the taller man’s throat.
“No. It doesn’t matter Love. No one deserves to be treated like that.” John leaned up, catching Sherlock’s lips in a kiss that felt like a slow burning fire. “I love you Sherlock.” There were a few moments of silence from the brilliant man above him, but John didn’t feel anything but more love for Sherlock.
"I'm not being a brat, I'm just not too keen on walking in on my brother balls deep in my dance partner." Before he could say anything, Harry had disconnected.
He came to with a painful heave of his lungs, coughing and choking on the residual energy his lungs had absorbed during his fall.
John smirked and licked his lips once more before turning back to Rosie, handing the child the biscuit before starting to clear the table.
"Jo-hn-" Sherlock shifted his hips, his erection brushing the underside of John's own, sending a shock of arousal along his spine. A growl escaped John's chest as he hurried to roll the condom on, slicking himself thoroughly and using his fingers to press more of the slick into Sherlock's body.
“John!” Sherlock’s concerned voice sounded years away as John felt his body connecting with the floor.
The shrieking cry of a horse in peril pulled the wolf’s attention away from his body. A new growl rumbled through the air, deeper than the wolves and twice as loud.
"Daddy- Daddy please-" Sherlock keened as John palmed his erection through his trousers, his back arching and head dropping back against his chair.
“John is immune! He shows almost no response to my song.” Mycroft’s eyes brightened dangerously at that and he moved closer to John, reaching out to touch the unconscious human.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, certain that John was simply trying to get him to admit that he enjoyed seeing him playing.
“You won’t. I have enough power for another kiss. I-If you want.” John nodded, leaning forward and pressing his lips against Sherlock’s once more. He whimpered against the sensation, pulling back after a few seconds. He was breathless and lightheaded, but happier than he had felt in a long while. “Go to sleep John.” Sherlock whispered.
“Mycroft, what a pleasure. Your timing is, as ever, perfect.” Sherlock’s tone was dripping with sarcasm as he rolled his eyes, standing and turning to face the new man.
John arrived at the school, making his way to the Ballet studio. He knew he looked a mess, face covered in mud and scuffs on his jeans. He had come straight from Rugby practice and hadn't bothered to shower.
"Look at what he has done to you, made you into a mindless, anger-fuelled drone-" Sherlock drew his hand back, preparing to punch Jim for his words, but found himself dragged backwards, forced to stumble away from the other boy.
“Well, I’m starving. Let’s go eat, and we can discuss that tissue you wanted me to sample.” Mike draped an arm over John’s shoulders and hooked his other arm around Sherlock’s elbow and led them into the Diner.
They were still for a while until they had recovered. John slid himself out of Sherlock and cleaned them both up. They were silent as they adjusted their clothes and gathered their blades.
"You." He whispered against John's lips before biting gently on his bottom one. John chuckled, tightening his grip on Sherlock's hips.
“It would be worth it if it meant I could kiss you again.” Sherlock flushed, seemingly flustered by the terrible line.
"Maybe next time I'll just strip you down and bend you over the sofa, eh?" Sherlock whimpered as his member gave a half-hearted twitch at that. John laughed and grabbed his hand, leading him towards the bathroom. "Come on Love, let's go take a shower and then we will go to bed. Sound good?"
The energy storm hit with almost no warning, knocking his Star Sailor off course and sending him careening through the stars.  He fought against the waves of energy to keep his sails unfurled and intact.
"I know Love, I get it." John pried himself out of Sherlock's grip, his eyes sparkling with amusement and love. "Come on, lets go back to yours, eh? We'll send a cab to get those two when the call asking where we are. That will give us lots of time to be alone. Sound good Tiny Dancer?" Sherlock felt his heart swell for his boyfriend and he leaned down, kissing the other boy sweetly.
“Sher-Sherlock-” His mind was spinning and he could feel an intense need gripping his chest as the note continued to pulse through him.
“It can’t be healed. He had at least one of every type of Med Kit available. I tried healing it before I escaped, it just reappeared.”
“John needs you!” He shouted, punching Dying Sherlock again, once more hearing the distant wail of monitors. “For fucks sake! Fight! John Watson needs you!” The castle started crumbling faster, the walls disappearing around them. “Please. You think it was lonely before, you have no idea how much it hurts knowing that you failed John Watson.” He whispered, knowing it was too late. His body had died. He could feel himself fading away. “I’m so sorry John.”
“Well if you don’t know, then you may need to revaluate your choices buddy.” John could hear Greg snigger behind him, the strangely beautiful man shooting a glare at John’s friend before turning his gaze back to the med student.
A bolt of lightening cracked down onto a tree next to him, sending Sherlock and Redbeard tumbling down a slight hill. He felt pain blossom in his wrist as he landed.
Something flickered in the back of Sherlock's mind, making his thoughts spin as he set his violin back on his desk. He grabbed the case, flipping open the cover and finding the picture of the boy. He felt a vice tighten around his chest and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, dialling the now familiar number of the Detective Inspector that had saved his life.
By the end of the day, the whole school was talking about how the dancing freak was being protected by the Rugby team.
“Greg, get him out of here. I need to focus.” Greg escorted his husband from the room, pulling the door shut behind him. “What the hell is wrong with you Sherlock Holmes?” He whispered, leaning down and pressing his ear against the pale chest.
“It was me.” He whispered, flickering in and out of view as he struggled against the emotions. “I did this. I- I killed John.” Gavin dropped his hands to his sides, looking lost and confused. “I was holding him and kissing him and his heart stopped.” Greg stepped around the bed, standing in front of Sherlock.
“I’ve been meaning to ask, when did Mycroft marry George? Last I remember, they were only just starting to date.”
Firm hands gripped his hips and spun him, pressing him back against the door, pulling a gasp from him.
“He is nothing!” Moriarty pushed John forward, making his right shoulder snap unpleasantly and pulling a scream of pain from his raw throat. “At least, he will be, once you’re done with him.” Two men grabbed Sherlock by the elbows and dragged him into the room, the Siren not putting up any fight.
The kid was thin. Almost too thin, despite eating regularly. That wasn’t a good sign. He peeled away the gauze and growled when he saw the wounds.
“Hmm, so the scar is sensitive? Good to know.” Sherlock’s voice had gone deep and husky, and John felt arousal pooling in his stomach. “I shall take that into account while I’m fucking you, Captain Watson.” John whimpered, he had filmed with lots of guys before, but none of them had made him feel quite like this before.
"I-I'm sorry. I just- I was af-afraid-" Another kiss calmed him, bringing his mind back to the boy before him, letting him focus his thoughts.
"Not yet, my guys just found something farther down the alley. Might be important." Sherlock bit his lip against a whimper and moved to stand, but was shocked to stillness by John's hand resting just slightly too high on his thigh.
“Let him go, and fuck off.” He deepened his voice, barking out the command in the same manor that he used to command soldiers. The men grinned, letting go of Sherlock and letting him slump to the ground. They stalked towards John, trying to intimidate him.
“I don’t have time for this Sherlock. Now, stop distracting John. I have to finish his makeup.” Sherlock flushed and clenched his fists, looking incredibly uncomfortable. John smirked at him in the mirror, feeling a spark of affection for the young man.
"Yeah, that's Mary. We almost hooked up once over the summer, but nothing wound up happening." Sherlock felt a flare of jealousy and sent the girl a glare. John laughed harder and gripped Sherlock's hips, tugging him closer. "Are you jealous, Tiny Dancer?" Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to push his way out of John's grip, but was promptly pinned against the nearest wall.
"Sorry guys, guess we're going to be bailing on you. Stay and enjoy, eh? See you Monday Greg!" John grabbed Sherlock's elbow and pulled the other boy out of the restaurant, leaving Greg and Mycroft standing by the table.
Sherlock heard his name being called faintly and glanced up from the textbook he was studying, a sharp dismissal planned for anyone but Mrs. Hudson.
"Y-Yes, just a bit sore." John nodded and reached for Sherlock's feet, tugging at the laces of his shoes out of habit. "W-What- what are you doing?"
"Indeed." Sherlock replied in a sulking sort of voice, but his eyes were narrowed the way they did when he'd discovered a fact about the case. John stopped asking questions for the moment, waiting until Sherlock shook his head.
"He's sleeping for the moment and I think you and I need to have a little chat." John dropped his tone and his eyes sharpened.
I know poor John is having a rough go of things! Stick with me! There will be a break in the storm during the next two chapters.
"You have no idea what you've done, Marcus." John spat the word at him and he flinched. "You've brought a hell down on yourself you can never be prepared for. My husband is not a man you want to mess with. I hope you’ve made your peace."
John and Sherlock passed in and out of groggy states of sleep and wakefulness for the next week, both of them recovering slowly from their injuries. Mycroft remained behind, letting Greg return to London and to work, while the husbands recovered. John recovered faster and it was to his great pleasure that he was able to finally get up and start moving around by the following weekend. Poor Hamish had been glued to their bedsides though it was clear all three were beginning to go stir crazy. Mycroft know he could not keep the two of them confined in the hospital much longer and the doctors finally reluctantly agreed to release them the following day.
“Locked up in this house with nothing to do for the winter sounds infuriating.” Sherlock mumbled as a reply, looking a bit sheepish when John snorted with laughter.
in the kitchen trying to make tea. His mind clearly not in sync with his hands. John knew what the effort meant and he let it soften his anger and hurt. They'd both wandered in darkness alone for almost a year and now together again they had no idea how to interact anymore. Both aching inside, both hollowed out from a year of regret.
“NO,” They heard Hamish shout suddenly and they both ran to the living room just in time to see Hamish toss his teddy bear at the TV. “RED NOT BLUE! Look at the shape! ” The little boy yelled as he was watching one of those children shows that pretends to ask the audience for input. John doubled over laughing and Sherlock simply consented to look slightly sheepish.
"He's a lot like his father..." John said it automatically without missing a breath, but smirked as he was corrected.
“He remained behind with the mender. Well we believe it is the mender. There is far too much blood to move anything until night falls. Whomever it is they are alive but unwell.” She looked up as George entered the inn.
“No my Lord. Lord Mycroft left at darkfall and Lords Sherlock and John left a short while ago. Their carriage lost a wheel and had to be repaired.” She looked concerned.
They settled into their temporary life at Mycroft's estate fairly easily after that. Lestrade came by at least once a week to ask about a case, check in on them, or else just to have dinner with them. They went into the station once a week as well, following up on whatever they were working on. Mrs. Hudson came to visit a few times and John began a relatively structured schedule of waking up early, being hauled into town for physical therapy and doctor's visits, heading to the Yard, and then returning to isolation at the estate. Time flew by and before John had really absorbed everything that was going on he and Sherlock had been at the estate for almost two months. John's arm recovered much faster than the doctors had expected, no doubt owing to the amount of effort he was putting into trying to get back to full strength - but he was still having some trouble with certain motions. His nightmares dwindled until he was only having about one a week and as winter descended on them it was hard to remember that there was still a spider web lying in wait. Which is why John was slightly taken aback when after two months of not speaking about the case at all Sherlock sat him down on the couch to explain what he knew.
"Very well, I shall return later and attempt to speak with him" Moran stood and left. Mycroft stared after him for a long time, a muscle twitching in his jaw. There was danger under his mask and he was sure it was somehow related to the mender.
Marcus fell over shuddering as he did and Sherlock never noticed that he'd pulled the trigger. Instead he first saw pure fear and terror building in John’s face. He then felt fire bloom across his abdomen and looked up at John as John screamed his name and lurched forward, sinking the hook into his neck. Sherlock took a few shaking steps towards John, both of them reaching out for the other before he collapsed. The pain in his body was so much he felt like he was disconnected from it, watching himself from some other vantage point outside of it. Mycroft was shouting behind him and men with guns poured into the room. But neither of them heard anything he said, both of them watching in horror as their lover was bleeding out and their vision swam and faded to darkness.
"Stop thinking Sherlock. This isn't the time for thinking. You said you were going to claim me, so fucking do it!" He grunted as Sherlock slicked cold lube over the entire length of his ass, slipping his fingers down to trace the length of him as he explored John's body. John grunted again as fingers worked and teased the tense but sensitive muscle, slowly pushing their way in and caressing every inch of him they could reach. John started to say something but it became wordless muttering as Sherlock expertly teased him.
“It will be dangerous to leave the protection of the house however, and I am sure your brother,” John paused he did not know why but saying Mycroft’s name had a very ill-effect on his mate, “Would be displeased if we did.”
“Only if you promise not to give him or her sweets. I'm serious you’re probably the cause of little Hamish’s toothache.”
"John, have you ever forgotten someone?" He asked softly, ripping through John's thoughts in the way only he could.
"She was supposed to be at her flat. She told me she would be." He whispered through a clenched jaw, he was clinging to Sherlock's shirt. "I..."
“He is my son; I can do whatever I want. If I kill him it’s none of your concern.” Mycroft went to say something else when Sherlock suddenly appeared in front of Marcus, leaping gracefully down and landing perfectly in front of him. "A trick?!" He growled and snapped but no sniper sights came.
“John?!” She exclaimed before coming to his side. He could not speak and for a long time she simply sat there, holding him as he shook.
"No." John's voice caught under the force of his attention. "But I can't lie and say I don't feel anything about it. Because lying won't get us anywhere, it'll only ruin what we've started." He sighed but didn't pull away. Trying to keep his voice even. "I'm jealous, Sherlock. I'm beyond jealous.I didn't even know
for - was gone." Sherlock looked uncomfortable. It was too much, more than he deserved. This was his fault, he'd put John at risk and brought him pain. He wanted John to be angry, that was the logical reaction to this situation. John should be hitting him, or kicking him out, or any other number of things that an angry person would do. But he was trying to forgive him. Trying to allow him back in, even though his trust had been compromised.
"Oh..." John forced out as Sherlock pushed down on his hips, primal force and desire behind every motion.
"I am pleased to know this. You have done well, be safe." He ordered, turning to stalk towards the stable.
“The killers methods seem familiar to me, as if I have seen them somewhere before, obviously.” Sherlock snapped, and John simply pursed his lips and furrowed his brow. He leaned over and took the file from the other.
Super fluffy chapter but it was necessary! I wrote this chapter around the time the US got our air date announcement for Series 3 and it just poured into the work.
“My love, you are so foolish when you speak like this. For months now you speak as if every moment will be our last together.” Sherlock kissed him deeply. “I will never let any harm come to you if it is within my power to stop it.”
"So was your evening pleasant?" Mycroft teased, a darkness in his voice. He was drinking blood from a wine glass - one of his favorite actions.
"You are leader of this clan, you are the elder brother, you are my tutor - whatever your rules are I accept." He replied as firmly as he could. Sherlock's nerves were gnawing away at him, though his own resolve was strong. Mycroft smiled and turned to move back towards his chair.
"It's alright John, it's alright." Sherlock tried to put his hand on John's but realized he was using his right arm. He grunted and switched to the left side not responding to anything else anyone said until John seemed to settle down.
"It's not that, it's just... You haven't hardly touched me since we got out of the hospital." He arched as Sherlock came back and gently ran his hands over his legs. "And now it's all secrets and handcuffs."
"I believe I shall return to ensure James is keeping an eye on his wife and not trying to ruin the first logical thing he has ever done." Moran nodded and left.
The boy smiled as Sherlock finished the story but he was almost completely asleep again. Sherlock sighed as he realized that Hamish now had carrot mashed into his hair. He looked over at John and saw that he was awake but looked utterly exhausted. Sherlock hoisted Hamish up and walked over to the door, opening it and walking to the landing.
" His tone cut and his eyes hardened as he turned to face Sherlock fully, so that his body now also face him.
“No you have not! You refuse to let me go visit my home. I am not allowed to write to my brother without you seeing it. You keep me in a gilded cage!” He shouted, anger flaming in his eyes.
" Sherlock moved over to John lifting him slightly so he could slide underneath of him and rest his head in his own lap. He slowly carded his hands through John's hair and looked up at his brother with mild interest and concern.
"Mistakes mean we're human Sherlock. But you're already worked on counteracting that. You made a call and in my opinion, it was the best one you could have made. You came home and you let me in." John whispered as he reached out and let his hand come to rest on his tags over Sherlock's chest.
"I know much about you, little one. I do not believe it is a secret that you have a had a zealous suitor who has been denied your hand. I was sadly denied the pleasure of you at least a dozen times." Mycroft smirked as John blushed. "I confess that I did not know you were Solvanar. However I knew you were important to my coven. Ever since you were small my people have returned to me from nights they should have perished with a story of a kind young boy who tended to their wounds like no other ever had. Someone who was born with knowledge of healing our wounds though they were only mortal. You see, little one, our kind has very few healers. Most of those who embrace the life of the night turn their back on their fellows. They seek only a life for themselves or their mates and never for those in their coven or their family. That is what made the civil war that lead to the creation of your line so deadly. I sought to bring you to this life before Sherlock was even aware of you. I wanted to train you and perfect you so when you were ready the transition would feel natural." He sighed a bit wistfully and sat back, caressing his cheek with his hand.
"Share?" The hope in Sherlock's voice as he so very slowly turned his gaze back to John's caught John off guard. In that moment Sherlock's guard fell further than John had ever seen it and it made him loose what little control he had left over his heart.
“Is that what has been plaguing you for the last several months?” He looked to the other with more understanding.
Sherlock swept from the room, well aware he was dangerously close to losing control again. He heard John laughing, which angered him slightly. John didn't realize how close Sherlock was to proving to him that Sherlock Holmes did not take prisoners. John seemed to realize something was wrong when Sherlock didn't return and hastily gathered his things to get ready to face the day. As Sherlock moved through the living room towards his own room to change his eyes fell on the card sent by
"I'm anxious." He replied dismissively. "I feel like there is something I could be missing, something important. And if anything goes wrong you could be hurt or die. This isn't the same..." He was cut off mid-explanation as John's mouth found his and blew his train of thought to pieces. It was nice to have the quiet in his head for the moment and John was the only one who could ever cut through the chatter.
“You are his Sire! You could have ordered him to reveal his plans! To keep himself out of harm's way!” He shook his brother, and Mycroft easily forced his way out of Sherlock’s grip.
“Father you should know, he has stolen the blood of two servants in your absence.” Meaghan said timidly.
“Sherlock…” John grunted, trying to warn him because Marcus was drawing a pistol as he turned back to face the detective.
John had no idea if it had been five minutes or three years. The silence was thick, like molasses. He heard a car door slam down in the street, somewhere the barking of a small dog, and the utter silence that meant his whole world had to change. He couldn't keep chasing the demons of this place, no matter how much it felt like home. He sighed, taking a deep breath as he heard a door open somewhere nearby and close. He closed his eyes, with them shut tightly he could imagine the flat as it had been two years ago. When it was full of the anxious energy of a high function consulting detective sociopath. Violin music rained down on his ears for a few minutes before the Sherlock in his mind waltzed over and dropped down into his chair with a huff.
Life at Baker Street begins with deepening friendships, Sherlock's introduction to mortal drugs, and fear.
“Very good, we can’t have John freezing to death in the flat.” Sherlock smiled but John knew the look in Sherlock's eyes. Everything they suspected was proving true.
“If you betray him, I will find a way to repay you.” She growled with promise. “We are working on a plan to incapacitate my father. The only way to do so is through poisons of the blood. John is an expert in herbs and potions of our kind and together we have created a blend of herbs and blood wine that arouses the person ingesting them while subsequently weakening the person’s strength. John has been taking minute amounts of the herbs in blood wine for several years now to begin to build up a tolerance to the weakening side effects. However we are certain that the amount required to be in his blood when my father returns, will leave him incapable of escaping on his own. As such I am to flee here with him and ensure his safety until we return to London.” Sherlock frowned in confusion but said nothing for a long time.
"Yea I bet you are. You two have been a right mess haven't you?" He nodded to Sherlock who was draped over the couch and seemed to be asleep. "Has he been a terror?"
-Her red hair was more copper colored than the last time, her eyes tired and weak, and her entire persona unkempt –
Sherlock, you are my brother and the man you love was just injured." Their tones were definitely dark. Sherlock felt angry and vulnerable and did not like Mycroft's tone.
"SILENCE!" He backhanded her, growling. "You will answer every question asked of you, you will not move, and you may rest assured you will pay for this." His voice was so low and dark, even Mycroft was somewhat unnerved by it.
His heartbeat raced as he looked over every detail in the way only he could, The amount of emotion and sentiment it conveyed to him was overwhelming.
"Yes. I have been able to heal at least some wounds of your kind since I was a child. I first discovered it when I happened upon Anthea in our apple orchard when I was approximately five." John replied softly.
“Of course, there is no blood on the body! He was killed by something other than a typical weapon!” Sherlock began to rant and rave, mumbling possibilities to himself before freezing as John mumbled something. “What did you say?” He demanded, striding over the body to where John was eyeing the word on the wall with a frown. The word was “Rache”
"Sherlock," He whimpered, completely lost in the sensation. Sherlock rarely was so impatient with this, so desperately desirous. It made him feel drunk.
"No, you're right. The logic of your statement is correct. I just find myself at a loss of facing my words in your mouth and your emotion in my heart." The look on Sherlock's face conveyed pain, guilt, and love. It sucked the air out of John's chest and for a moment the two of them forgot they had an audience, John resting his forehead against Sherlock's chest while Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's neck. It took a long time before someone broke the silence.
, John fit in his arms like they'd been made for each other. Sherlock let his nails scratch against the sensitive skin of John's scalp as he toyed with his hair, blowing his breath across the very purple love bite on his neck. John muttered something before trying to shake off his tiredness.
"Nothing, forget it. Let's pack. I don’t want this turning into another Baskerville where you have to use half my stuff because you forgot your own.” John barked at Sherlock and with a piece of toast half in his mouth he stood and moved toward the bedroom.
“John, I keep telling you it’s Christmas. Maybe this last year has taught me to be more appreciative of those we have around us. Leave it at that for now, okay?” Sherlock turned to Mycroft. "I have something we need to discuss with Lestrade."
"Watch me." He commanded. "Watch me give you want you want, John." John couldn't have disobeyed if he wanted to, his attention becoming fully focused on the fact that he could just see how Sherlock's hard cock was pounding away at his tender ass.
"Good evening, Lord Sherlock and Lord John. I do apologize for disturbing your celebrations," He added softly, he was going to continue but John cut him off.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft commanded as Sherlock appeared at the top of the stairs beside him. “Go with John to Elizabeth’s manor. I shall go to the Duke and bring him presently. Do
"My love you should not have attempted to enter my mind without training." Sherlock scolded him, motioning to one of the mortals who came over and allowed John to feed. When he finished Sherlock scooped him up and carried him to their room.
"It is of little consequence to have the physical document." John furrowed his brow, why was Mycroft being so
"Yes, little one. He will be perfectly fine. The longest he has been in a dark mood has been ten days. I believe he will awaken in the next day or so and be confused as to where you are. Will you stay with me until that time?" Mycroft's mouth was on his instantly and John could find no will to say no.
"What life?" Sherlock demanded, his tone soft because he did not understand this at all. He looked down, contemplating things as Anthea spoke up from the door.
“I told you, you will never have Sherlock.” John’s voice was dark as he growled, but his arm trembled with weakness. The sun was just beginning to crest over the horizon. “You will have nothing.” He struggled with Moriarty, wrenching him away from his own body and dropping him.
"He knows his Mommy isn't coming back, John. He knows something bad happened. He's our son, he's smart."
“It doesn’t matter; you’ll never see him again. I’m taking you away. I’ve arranged it all. You’d better say your goodbyes. Your son won’t be coming with you.” Marcus grinned looking down at his phone.
"I'm sorry - should we have stayed in?" John laughed, it felt so strange to hear Sherlock asking him for answers to questions like that.
“So what has changed?” Sherlock sighed impatiently. "Why do you suddenly want to know what's going on? I thought you all were going to let us handle it."
"I... The memories are so hard to find..." Sherlock whispered but he closed his eyes. John slid his hand into Sherlock's as he slipped into his mind palace.
Sherlock stops brooding only to find Mycroft's truth regarding his feelings for John. While Sherlock trains John in his vampiric abilities, Mycroft chooses to distance himself from the mender.
"You've been sick a lot over the last year. I think Hamish is sharing too many germs with you." Sherlock sighed softly.
"Reclaim what is yours." John begged, fire still raging in his veins. Sherlock leaned up to search his eyes before leaning back down and kissing him furiously.
"I have missed you. I have grown far too attached to someone who is not mine." He smirked as John blushed.
“I should have listened. You have never steered us wrong, Sherlock simply wanted to enjoy what was the anniversary of my coming into this life. He will take our life from him. His memories, his heart, all of it shall disappear under the weight of the herbs. It was intentional wasn’t it? What did you see in my memories? What happened when I was rescued?” The mender demanded of his Sire, clutching him and staring in his eyes.
"He came when I called and told me that we have conceived. I was feeling very faint and he remained with me for a time to ensure I was well cared for. I asked him to tell James the good news in my stead, while I rested. James informed me that John was waiting for him upon his return and in his earnest to celebrate James offered him some of our store of bloodwine. James and John were both overcome by the effects of poison, it seems all of the bloodwine we possessed was poisoned with the same herb that our servant tricked James into giving you all at the engagement dinner. When..." Elizabeth took Moriarty's hand as he let out a soft noise again trying to comfort him. He however played his part well, though he was quite amused that none of the men believed his act for a moment.
Afternoon was slowly giving way to evening, the weak light of the wintery sun casting its' final shadows over the whole of Mycroft's study, giving it an overall gloomy feel. Mycroft sat quietly at his desk, palms pressed together in front of his chin, with a stern look on his face as he watched an anxious John pace back and forth across the length of the room and mutter to himself. Mycroft's irritation was almost palpable as he watched how his fledgling continued a descent into the darker parts of his mind. For the better part of the last two days Anthea and Mycroft had worked diligently to free John from the mental reverberations he'd forced himself to suffer through by attempting to mind link with Sherlock. For his part, Sherlock still remained in his brooding state - statue still and unresponsive, even when Mycroft attempted to find him in his mind. John had calmed some and under Mycroft's direction taken a bit more blood, but he had refused to properly rest or feed until Sherlock came back into the world. Mycroft himself had only been able to rest by using the force of their Sire/Fledgling bond to compel John into slumber, which had angered the mender immensely. His pacing was growing feverish and Mycroft's anger finally snapped. Sherlock would pay for doing this to John, Mycroft was sure of that. He swept out from behind his desk and placed himself firmly within John's course through the room, stopping him and grabbing his arms as he did.
"Sherlock, look at me." Lestrade ordered and Sherlock looked up at him, confusion on his face. "I'm going to meet you at the hospital, okay? Mycroft's already there waiting for you. Nod your head that you understand me." Sherlock nodded but his attention was completely focused on John. Lestrade closed the doors and the ambulance was quickly on its way. He was completely astonished, he'd never knew Sherlock could be so put off.
"But it's the way things are and I'm not going anywhere. So, if you're done trying to pretend none of that ever happened I think it's time you consider how you're going to repair your bond with your brother."
“Yes.” Victor sighed, leaning back on his heels and looking around the flat, a weight seeming to settle itself on his shoulders.
Sherlock looked beautiful in the snow, the tip of his nose bright red in the cold air as he returned John's smile. He was bundled in his ridiculously long coat and blue-grey scarf, and his dark hair stood out against the snow.
“You loved the challenge of me more than you actually loved me.” Sherlock sniffled and nodded, watching as the young man stood. “Don’t feel bad, I knew that’s all I could get from you. You made me feel free to love whoever I wanted.”
“You claim your song has no effect on this man-” Mycroft’s voice was filled with awe as he watched his little brother and the human.
"Oh, you liked that, didn't you?" John chuckled, pulling Sherlock's shirt out of his trousers and pushing his hands along his spine. Sherlock nodded, biting his lip as he felt embarrassment clawing at his mind. "Don't be shy Love, Daddy loves hearing you."
"John, I want to go home," Sherlock leaned down, nuzzling into the crook of John's neck and biting gently. "I have other things I would rather be doing right now." Sherlock felt John tense against him, and felt the soft hum that rattled the shorter boy's chest.
It didn’t take as long to return to his true form, but it hurt worse. His tail ached and the seal burned through the muscles.
“The rose lost another petal today.” John nodded, his chest tightening. “You have to do something John, we don’t have that much longer.”
He thought as he searched for the source of the voice. He froze completely when he caught sight of the being that was sitting on the edge of the boat.
"U-Until- until six thirty." John glanced at the clock that hung on the wall, smirking dangerously up at Sherlock as he slid down to his knees. "J-John-"
"Y-You Daddy. I want you." John chuckled, moving his hands from their place on Sherlock's hips and gripping his arse tightly, making the detective whimper and wriggle against him.
“God, Sherlock you are gorgeous. Look at you, so desperate to come. Do you want to come Sherlock?” The younger man nodded, rocking his hips into John’s fist desperately. John stilled his hand and stopped Sherlock’s hips, earning a whine from him. “I asked you a question.”
As Sherlock rode into town, he heard the whispers of the townspeople, he could feel the confusion and awe as they watched him ride along the streets.
“How do you know its not?” John shrugged, taking a swig of his beer. “Anyway, what I mean is do like a séance or something.”
Sherlock won the first place trophy for his troupe, the rugby team and his boyfriend cheering him on from the front row.
"Come on Posh Boy, we both need a shower, then I am going to fuck you into the mattress." Sherlock groaned, letting John lead him down the hall and into the shower.
“Sherlock.” John fought back a giggle at that. A strange name for a strange creature. The creature hovered above him, holding his gaze almost in challenge. John found himself slowly losing himself in the pale eyes of the Siren.
"Sorry, hang on a second." John excused himself and stepped away, mumbling into the phone in what was clearly a fake conversation. Greg felt his chest tighten in panic as it became very clear that John and Sherlock would be ditching them. John made his way back, his face set in a grim line.
"No. He succumbed to fever less than a week after he was brought in." John's chest tightened and he blinked back tears.
Watching Sherlock change from Siren to Human was breathtaking. His song was stunning and watching the energies dance and change around him sent a thrill along John’s spine.
“Humans are dreadfully unresponsive when they are unconscious.” The man moved his grip down to John’s throat and squeezed, cutting off his airway enough that his body started trying to fight, but his mind stayed blank. “Do you know who I am, little human?” John tried to free himself from the grip crushing his airway. “Do you know what fun I could have with your body?” The hand on his throat disappeared, swinging his body and causing his shoulder to pull painfully.
“Are you sure this is a good idea Greg?” John gestured and the collection of objects the group had managed to collect. There were various herbs and a large copper bowl with a very intimidating looking dagger. Resting in the bowl, was an intricate old pocket watch, glinting in the soft light.
“I remember my father writing in it when I was a child, telling me stories when he was sober enough to do so.” John sighed heavily, the few good memories he had of his childhood weighing on his heart. “I started writing in it when I was in the War, carrying on the tradition as best I could.”
“Well Sherlock, I don’t think we were properly introduced last time. My name is John Watson.” The shorter man stepped forward, reaching out his hand. Sherlock hesitated before reaching out his own. As their skin touched, electricity sparked between them, causing them both to pull their hands apart. “What the fuck was that?” Sherlock felt a jolt of fear lance through him.
"Hey." John whispered, brushing a stray curl out of his eyes. "What's going on, Love? Where is all of this coming from?"
He hated how nice his new roommate was. He hated that John never mentioned what happened between them. He hated how attractive the older man was.
“Yeah, not for another couple of weeks. The wound on his stomach is still healing, and not well at that. I’m not comfortable with him returning to filming with it still open like that.”
He situated the condom on the head of Sherlock's erection and looked up at him, smirking dangerously. He then preceded to lower his mouth onto Sherlock's member, rolling the condom on in one smooth motion. Sherlock moaned helplessly at the action, watching his new lover in awe as John easily took most of him down his throat.
He shifts his eyes to Sherlock's who has been cataloging his reactions this entire time. "Well, I will say this," John says after he clears his throat, "you have very good taste." And he can't help but admire the artful contrast of the pair of them when Sherlock chuckles and drapes his red arms over John's shoulders. The pale hands run over his chest, before sliding into John's pockets and pulling him back, until he's flush against Sherlock.
“The filth is where I am,” Harry chanted as her hands reached for the disgusting muck. “I’m just disgusting filth John. I couldn’t protect you. I’ll always be filth. I’m so thirsty. I couldn’t protect you.”
The ghosts surrounded him and obscured his sight. He could no longer see his tormentors, but felt himself being gently impaled over and over again.
Sherlock glances back at him and frowns. "Won't you come sit?" And John does choke out a laugh at that. It sounds a little brittle to him.
It was as he treaded a path into the carpet, that he stopped and looked out his window. He could see the side of Sherlock’s house, and all of the windows looked dark.
John hid his blush with another sip. He noticed something and asked, “Neither of you are having any?”
He catches the hand that was straying underneath him, and brings the other one up to pin it against his leg. He still strokes himself, and his breathing becomes shaky when John moans in desperation. Sherlock pistons out of John now. The squelch of wet flesh picks up in tempo.
“I see,” Jim said delicately as he brought John’s warm plate over along with a carafe. “Well, unfortunately I just remembered some business that I have to attend to on my own. I’m sure I’ll see you later Johnny.”
The woman says nothing, just continues to stare ahead. Sherlock glanced behind him, and swore in his head when he saw Lestrade and Donovan emerge, both with bewildered looks on their faces. They immediately clouded with suspicion when they didn't immediately spot Sherlock. He had to hurry this along.
Well, Mycroft was a shot in the dark anyway. At least John wasn’t going to be shuffled into a black site faster than you could say ‘bureaucracy’.
"It's certainly hard to tell if you've figured out the solution to your little dilemma, so allow me to guide you,: Sherlock leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, and John stares with barely any comprehension evident in his face, “pleasure is the only way to ease the more unpleasant side effects, John. Actually, any physical touch will do, let's not sugarcoat it. I can literally do anything I like to you in this state, and you will
Sherlock stared at his fingernails. They grew rapidly around his mug of morning tea as he clenched it between his hands. They stopped a good one and a half centimeters past the ends of his fingers, and tipped into sharpened points. They looked like they were meant to gouge out honey brown eyes and scratch away soft smiles.
The pleasurable buzz in his veins had evaporated. Once again, John was a potent mixture of anticipation and nervousness. Sherlock’s hands ran over his backside, not in an erotic caress, but a comforting one.
Sherlock moaned openly when he thought about the lines in John’s brow becoming pronounced when he scrunched his face in disapproval. Would those same lines be deeper, or smoothed by the feeling of pleasure? Finally he would know for certain.
When John is blindly placing packets of pens in his cart, he reflects. Maybe the counter-offer wasn't such a bad idea after all. Sherlock had seemed annoyed by it, of course. He's not exactly pleasant when he's not getting his way. John's certainly not keen on trying it again any time soon, but maybe it is a good ace in the hole. If Sherlock's being too unreasonable (and wow, isn't his definition of that a bit stretched) he can always play that again. But only as a last resort.
He looked up at Sherlock again, who hadn’t lost his pleased expression, and couldn’t stop the giggle muffled around his food.
Sherlock deftly twists his hand around John’s cock, listening to him become increasingly desperate for release. When he rubs his fingers over the head of John’s prick, the moan is exquisite enough to compel him into action.
Even as he left the stables, he saw no one running for him. Rather than being relieved, it only made him anxious about their plans. These were extremely clever men.
John felt himself become encased and shrunken, as if the touch of the nothingness were the wrappings of his own corpse. He was being eclipsed, lost amongst all of the black. He was immobilized in the crushing pressure of the void. He felt it circle around his neck, and then
?” As soon as the question left his mouth, John regretted it. He was still too unbalanced by the visit, and the implication that he and Sherlock were—had been--. Well.
That is another point Sherlock hopes to show John tonight. And for the first time in a while, Sherlock isn’t entirely sure about his potential success. And, well. He would say he’d be damned if he doesn’t try. But Sherlock already knows that such a fate is practically sealed for him by now.
“He would need to have an established and trustworthy relationship to a former delinquent of one of those schools. Someone who was young enough to appeal to your subordinates, but old enough that he could be trusted with the responsibility of a drug smuggling operation. Someone like you, Mister Charles Pierce.”
"John." The doctor startles at the use of his name. It's the first voice besides his own that he's heard in ages. The deep voice is edged in warning, and John is close to desperate to hearing it again. But nothing else is said. His name is the only warning he's getting. It's not like John can put up much of a fight at this point anyway. Fighting him now will probably lead to more time in that tiny hell. Or something worse.
Finally, with ten minutes on the clock, the moment of truth has arrived. "Much to your dismay, I did in fact manage to grade your exams last night. The results were, well, what I expected." John doesn't need to look up to know that there's a twist in his lip. Whenever John overhears other students talking about Mr. Holmes, it's usually with unmitigated hatred. While John does agree that he can be harsh, John never for once thinks that he's overcompensating for a lack of intelligence. The man is brilliant, and John feels the sharp ache of disappointment in himself that he might have let the man down.
John thought for a little bit, because it seemed like Sherlock was willing to let him figure out the answer. He thought about a grieving boy, alone, with no one to turn to, and only one person in the world who could make him feel--.
He nearly comes to a dead stop in the middle of his stride. Is that….music? Faint strings and gentle flutes wind their way through John’s ears. He can at least tell it’s not a live band, but he has no idea what piece this is. Gone is the ever present scent of bleach. In its place are the lingering remnants of sharp smoke from a lit match, as well as the barest traces of something edible.
John is good, and human. He is a short temper, mixed with strong principles, steady hands in the face of fear, and strong black tea with a splash of milk.
The wheels on the chair are obscenely loud as Sherlock pushes himself towards John. Suddenly, the soldier is lying on his back, his head is swimming from its impact to the floor, and there's a very shiny shoe pressing down on his midsection. Sherlock grinds down, and John is scrambling for purchase on the carpet. He's not sure if his lack of air is the wave of euphoria, or Sherlock still steadily pressing downward with his sole. The pressure eases back, and John bucks up to get more of it.
Sherlock brings his bag closer with the hand that was teasing John's chest. He's still twisting and shallowly thrusting the toy, and John hasn't seemed to notice the absence of one aspect of stimulation. Sherlock rummages until his hand clasps over the cock ring from before. Sherlock brings his focus back to the doctor's face, then travels to the slowly returning erection. It's almost time.
... The words seemed almost shouted though Sherlock didn't open his mouth, but under the weight of John's calm, even stare he sagged. His guard collapsed and for the second time in four days, Sherlock Holmes let himself be vulnerable in front of John. John watched as that surrender happened and felt a deep ache inside of himself. He wanted to jump up and pull Sherlock to him, to embrace him and tell him everything would be alright. But now wasn't the time, Sherlock needed to navigate this to learn how process his feelings. Their eyes searched each others for a long time before Sherlock replied.
“No,” John said firmly, and Gregory looked up at him with surprise. “We are not coming back to the manor, danger or not, that is no longer our home.” Their eyes met for a moment and though part of Gregory wanted to smile, he frowned instead.
"It pleases you that I have formed some bond with him though he is my brother?" He asked breathlessly as John's kisses again trailed down his chest.
“Ah, yes Lord Moriarty asked to accompany us to visit you.” John’s father spoke and motioned for the man to join them. "He had to attend to the carriage."
"No Daddy, that's not how we play this game," Sherlock chided him, Hamish giggling beside him as he did. John shook his head but narrowed his eyes slightly, the way he did when he was observing and deducting. Sherlock's breath hitched in anticipation, the thrill clear on his face.
let him out of your sight Sherlock – TW. Mrs. Hudson paled slightly. She wasn't sure who TW could be, but it worried her that such a note should be slipped through her door. She picked up her phone and decided which of them to try first. She decided to try John first as he might be on his way back by now. As soon as it dialed she heard it ring from upstairs. She furrowed her brow; it was very unusual for John to forget his phone. The row between the boys must have been worse than she thought. She then tried Sherlock several times, getting no answer. She knew Sherlock was on a case and thus unlikely to check his phone for quite awhile. She checked the clock and knew that John should have been back by now. She was quite worried. She looked down, thoughtful for a moment, before spotting Lestrade's card on the fridge. She picked it up and dialed the number, barely letting him answer before she started speaking.
"Why are you so angry?" Sherlock asked softly, leaning against the wall near the door. His voice cutting straight through John's angry internal mutterings.
" He whimpered, wrapping his hands in those dark locks. Sherlock kissed down over his jaw and onto his neck, bathing the pulse point with kisses and nips until John was keening for more. He was desperate for this, for this bonding. The one he thought he would always reject with all his heart. John wasn't like anyone else, he wasn't like any other creature Sherlock had met in the world. He was different. Sherlock fished around the table finding the oil and preparing his eager love.
"Nor do I, but I believe that John's logic in this instance is sound. Just tell me what you need." Mycroft sighed.
The next chapter will likely be just a heavy if not heavier than this one, but there will be fluff! Eventually!
John made short work of dressing and hastily arrived at Elizabeth's manor. He was ushered inside by one of her servants to a room where she was lying propped up in a large four poster bed. He came in a took her hand, feeling how cold and clammy she was.
"Fluently. I've been teaching Hamish some as well." John blushed a bit with pride. "Ist nicht das so, Hamish?"
"Elizabeth, you are not welcome in our home. I suggest you contact the apothecary to and request the name for a physician nearby. I will not treat you. I wish James a quick recovery and ask you see yourself out." He turned and strode from the room as strongly as he was able.
“I shall explain later, for now I need you to repair your clothes and come with me.” When Mycroft did not move Sherlock turned back and reached a hand for John.
"Mycroft if this is..." Sherlock looked worried; he didn’t want to trust anyone but himself with saving his family. Trusting his brother to protect them was even worse. He would owe Mycroft something and he would lord it over them…
"Yes you do. Hey, I've been your friend for what almost seven years now? You know I watch you. I have to make sure you don't end up back out there on the street, when you think no one is watching you pull his tags between your top two buttons." The smirk on Lestrade's face did nothing to ease the slight anger that grew in Sherlock's stomach.
“I’ve seen this before.” Both Sherlock and John said at the same time, both of them turning to look at the other with a confused look.  There was a tense silence as the two of them tried to size the other up. This was not something they had ever discussed and it was clear that somewhere in the heart of this was something that both of them were keen to keep private.
John tried in vain to seek solace in his search, staying close to Sherlock and Moriarty for a few years as he tried to find his beloved. Eventually however he gave up and turned to other locales to try to push his sentiment aside. He traveled to Summer, the city of the Solvanaar and tried to distract himself. He setup a small shop where he sold potions and herbs to the travelers who came and went, making only enough money to buy his products and rent a room in the inn. A few years went by with a few short letters finding their way to his Sire but no real contact had between the wounded mender and his coven.  One morning as John was closing down his shop he looked up at the sound of his name, smiling as a woman with brown hair came to a stop just outside the door.
"Oh it's fine Mrs. Hudson, I... I don't think we knew what we were in for." John blushed and fidgeted with the scarf now around his neck, covering the love bites.
"You would rather injure your heart and his than share him, is that what you are trying to convey?" Sherlock demanded softly.
"Have you taken into account that perhaps it is meant to look like that?" Mycroft countered. "That perhaps you're missing something?"
In a sparse office across town Mycroft watched his brother pull himself back from his rugged convict look and back into the clean, somewhat respectable Englishman he was. Smirking as Sherlock mused over his plans for returning home.
"It's wrong!" Marcus shouted back and he would have come in the cage to strike John if John hadn't been holding the child. "Men and women belong with each other. I tried to warn your sister but it got her..."
"And God help me, I love it." John smirked, snuggling in closer to Sherlock before drifting to sleep.
“I admit it wounds me that you believe I harbor ill will against you, despite the depths of what you know to be my emotion towards you. However, I do not begrudge you feeling as you do, especially given my behavior when last we were under the same roof. That is, in fact, precisely why I am here. I have come…” He paused, looking almost as if he had swallowed something unpleasant, “To apologize to you, mender.” He broke his gaze away from John’s turning his back, so his face would be hidden from the other as he spoke. Trying to maintain the careful mask he was building to hide his truth. “I had intended to come much earlier, however once the weather finally cleared I was summoned to deal with a few things for the monarchy and as such was unable to do so.” He slowly turned back to face the mender, trying to speak his heart but finding his anger at the ridiculousness of the situation overriding everything else. “I have, obviously, had time to consider how my actions may have been perceived and what the consequences of that perception would have been for you,” John went to say something, but Mycroft shook his head. “Let me finish. I cannot claim to understand what possessed me to behave how I did, however I can, just this once, admit my brother was correct. I was indirectly attempting to claim you as my own and due to that I lost myself in the power of being your Sire. I have never, nor will I ever be again, so consumed by my own nature or my powers. While I fully expect you shall ignore this, I have come to remind you that you and my brother will always have a place in our Coven and a haven in our manors should you ever wish for or require it.” Mycroft slowly lifted his gaze and met John’s confused stare, finding he could only meet his eyes for a moment before it became uncomfortable. “My words are not enough to make up for what I have done, however I hope they will suffice.”
