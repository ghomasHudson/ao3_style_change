"So...Dean stopped using the services, that's a good thing yes? Means he's handling them on his own." Meg stated, her arms crossed over her chest, a challenging look on her face.
"Yes Dean. And lets not even begin to talk about that pretty boy Alpha you spent a whole week with. Talk about being a naughty boy. I bet you let him knot you everywhere he could." The older man snorted before sneering down at Dean, his lips curled up in disgust. "No wonder he left, but he's back now. Did you know that? He came back to visit his brother, brought a real pretty dark haired Omega with him too. I bet she must really be well trained." Alastair let his head drop, quickly pressing his foot against Dean's throat and holding him still. "Admit it Dean, you know you belong here where we can take good care of you, make sure you're an obedient Omega..you're too broken to be out there and you know it..You belong here where you can be a good boy."
A few minutes and a short walk later found them separated, Castiel making small talk with the few members of his family that had shown up while Dean was making the same rounds with his. Every once in a while he'd find Dean searching for him the same way he was searching for the green eyed man, their eyes holding for a few seconds before they'd look away, their faces red.
The call ended and Castiel sat and stared at the phone for a moment before he got up and headed towards the bay. He barely beat the ambulance there and stood off to the side as they brought in the patient. At first all he could see was a man in dusty chaps and jeans lying still on the gurney and then a taller man with long hair and wild eyes trying to keep up with the team.
His eyebrow arched as he watched his brother pace, a rare serious expression settled on his face. Around them the same expression was mirrored and he huffed as he crossed his arms, holding his ground in the face of his brother's displeasure.
"Meg touched you." He snapped as he positioned himself sot that was hovering just above the purpling head of Dean's cock. "You let her touch you."  He eased himself down with a calm that the fire under his skin belied. "You want her Alpha? You think about fucking her like you do me? Or do you think about her using you the way I do?" He took just the head into his body and then lifted off only to repeat the motion.
Azrael opened their mouth to speak but closed it again, their jaw clenching as they looked away. “What do you want Samael?” They asked finally.
Thursday found Castiel dragging himself up Gabriel's front steps at a time he wasn't even sure Gabriel knew existed for a tuxedo fitting for the mating. Yawning he rifled through his keys until he found the house key that his brother had given him and after a few attempts managed to get the door unlocked. Rubbing a hand over his face he stepped into the silent house the scent of coffee hitting him instantly. Closing his eyes he stood in the entryway and pulled in as big a breath as he could before he started towards the kitchen as it was obvious that someone was up and that coffee had been made or was in the process of being made, both options made him perk up a bit more.
"Well someone has to serve you lovely ladies. This is a night for you all to relax. Sam and I will be manning the bar while Dean will handling all the food. And just wait until you taste his cooking, he's a master in the kitchen. Coulda been a chef that one."
"So we're agreed then? We're going to meet him today?" Rowena asked as she looked between Castiel and Dean, eyebrow raised slightly.
"I've never been happier than when I'm with you. Even when I had no idea who you were, all those life times I was only truly happy when you were by my side"
"So you're saying Dad was a man whore." His normally lively eyes were dark as he stared at nothing in particular. "He had a whole 'nother family waiting in the wings?"
"You wrap up in extra blankets at night...you wear blockers all the time." Castiel turned wide, sorrowful eyes to his mate. "Our room doesn't even smell like our room...our house smells...cold."
Before Castiel could come up with an answer Balthazar hung up on him, leaving Castiel to stare at the dark screen. His lips curled back into a snarl as he hurled his phone across the room. Thankfully it survived the throw and with a softer sigh Castiel picked the phone up and pocketed it before he went to collect Jimmy from his room. Together they made their way towards Moondoor, both wondering idly what the news Balthazar had.
"I figured we'd play some whisper games with Dean at the bar....or club...whatever it is. Gage just how into this he is and maybe even set some boundaries."
Dean nodded, a smile on his face as he turned away, stopping only to talk into his headset before jogging out of their sight. Dual groans filled the air as they looked at one another.
Both of them looked down, Castiel's face blazing in embarrassment as Sam's scent turned ashamed. Neither of them needed to look up to know that Dean's eyes were probably completely gold in anger and Castiel knew that he was going to get an earful from the Omega as he was getting patched up.
"I could stay Castiel.." Gadreel offered, his eyes still glued to Daphne. "I might not be a medical practitioner but I can help and provide an Alpha figure head if needed."
"I wouldn't say it that way.." He huffed as he stared down at his tea cup. "My father was being an Assbutt of the highest degree and he was only making Dean angrier and angrier. We had just began..." He coughed, his cheeks turning a slightly darker red. "..anyway... I didn't want him to insult my mate, and I knew that I couldn't..."
He lead his boyfriend to the bathroom, his new piercings could wait for another day; today was Dean's day and he finally understood why Dean felt the way he did when Castiel got new work done. Just knowing that his sweet, nerdy boyfriend had his dick pierced was enough to make Castiel start to chub up and he couldn't wait to show Dean the pleasures of his new piercing.
With a nod Ash ducked back into the back and the sound of boxes being moved about and filled filtered through the air. Castiel watched idly as he covertly watched his brother move through the bakery refilling cases and putting little samples out under glass domes. Every once in a while he would stop and wipe his hand over his face, a subtle scenting of the mark that Sam had left. After the fourth time Castiel was getting ready to call him out on it when Gabriel turned to him, his lips kicked up into a smile.
Dean didn't get a change to gather his thoughts before Benny ducked through the door and into the dark leaving Dean on his own. As he gathered his gear Dean let his mind wander and when he slid behind of his car he wasn't aware that the man that was occupying his thoughts was watching him from shadow of the tree line.
"Of course. I hadn't expected to see it when I came around that turn. I figured this old place would have crumbled to the ground by now. And then learning what this place actually was? I had to come out here and see it for myself Dean."
"Why didn't you ever tell me?" Castiel pressed, his voice a controlled calm that belied his roiling thoughts.
"He does that sometimes." Dean had an amused lilt to his tone and Castiel looked over again to see Dean smiling softly. "But it's endearing and always ends in a good knotting."
He had just raised his hand to knock again when the door swung open and a he was tackled down off the porch with enough force to knock wind from his lungs.
The sound of music swelling in the room caught Castiel off guard and he watched as people began to pair off; Sam standing and offering his hand to Gabriel, a smile on his lips. The two joined the couples on the floor and he watched as they moved together as one only to belatedly realize that he and Dean had been left alone at the table. Glancing at Dean covertly he watched as the other gazed almost longingly at the couples on the floor. Finishing off his drink he stood, smoothing down his vest and jacket and walked over to Dean, holding his hand out to the green eyed man.
Inhaling deeply he scooted forward, making sure to stay on the pillow and leaned against Chief's leg before laying his head on the man's thigh. The leather was warm against his skin and Dean could pick up the soft sent of leather soap and he felt his eyes close as the smell eased a bit of his apprehension.
He looked up to see Dean leaning against his car, his suit jacket now gone leaving him in his vest with the sleeves of his button down shirt rolled up to his elbows. Castiel's words died on his tongue; his eyes touching on several different points of Dean before lingering on his lips.
Jack's voice was tentative and soft but it still caught the older hunter off guard and he jumped, his eyes going wide as he reached for his gun.
"At least it's not witches." He murmured as he pulled up the cast list to see who all had signed on so far; it was always better to be prepared. His eyebrow arched at the named actor for the Vampire lead. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad being his meal at after all.
"Mmhmm. ash in all his infinite wisdom pulled rental information, rental, business, and auto. There was an old home out past Moondoor that was rented a month ago and a couple vehicles freshly rented. One a four door sedan and the other a commercial van."
"Correct. Anything else?" When everyone stayed silent she took a breath and started speaking. "Right so, ye know that the first pup from a Pure Line Mating is always pure, that makes the second pup from a Pure Line/Regular Line mating what we call a Halfling. Just enough Pure Line blood to follow the same breeding lines and protection of a Pure Line pack and if a Halfling mates with a Pure Line then their pups will follow the same breeding pattern, all pups from that mating would considered Pure Line. Now in the case of a Pure Line Alpha and a Pure Line Omega mating, their pups will trade off which parental line they take after but all pups will be Pure Line." She cut her eyes over to him and Dean and he straightened his back again, narrowing his eyes at her. "For the most part it means nothing more than just a pedigree now, much like whether one is old money or new money. It used to mean something back when Kings ruled, but now..not much." She rolled one elegant shoulder, looking at all the pups and smiling.
Castiel pulled in a breath as he rubbed his eyes. On one he wanted to Samandriel to understand, but on the other he knew that in order to do that he had to explain why Dean reacted the way he had and that wasn't his story to tell. After a few moments of thought he decided to just go forward with the tale.
He felt Dean pause and he pulled back just enough to stare at him, molten gold eyes trained on his face. Slightly he turned his head to the side, the tip of his tongue peeking out between his teeth. Without turning around Dean called out loudly.
"It does! I was waiting..." He swallowed as he struggled to sit up, groaning as his chest protested the movement.  "I was waiting for you to ask....but you disappeared instead, you wouldn't talk to me and then you stopped coming to school...and I know why now but you just left me Dean.."
The slight flush on Castiel's cheeks warmed further even as he nodded at Ash. It took him two trips to get everything situated in the trunk of his car, making sure to grab both the water and the sports drinks. He checked his phone for updates from Gabriel and Sam and when he didn't see any he headed out to the Vineyard, his mind a constant loop of
"Put it away you two. I'm not going to take the wee pup now. They stay with their families until they are of age, and then they get to make the decision on their own. Granted most pups have extensive knowledge of their backgrounds and the utter privileged it is to be Chosen as the Magic User." Rowena's voice took on an airy quality as she sighed. "So instead of going back to Scotland, I'll be staying here to help."
Dean pinned him with a frown and he shuffled slightly, his Alpha anxious. With a sigh he pressed his forehead against Dean's, scenting him gently before brushing a kiss over his lips.
"Nah, but some of us need more to do. And we have enough employees at Moondoor so that we can trade off who is there on what day but myself and Dean are always a phone call away and they know that." Charlie explained as she picked up her keys and ushered Castiel out of the shop and down the way. "Us working also gives the public other ways to contact us in case they're scared or unable to get to Moondoor. So far it's Benny, Gadreel-who works at the Sheriff's department with Dean and Garth-who is one of our children's therapists, Sam, Ash, Jo-who works at the Roadhouse, and myself."
Castiel watched as Jimmy regarded Gabriel; his head tilted just slightly to the left and his eyes narrowed with lips pursed.
Ash cleared his throat, his eyes glittering playfully as he looked between the two. "Well that's settled, call me Boss when you're ready to be picked up and I'll haul ass back out here for you."
"You were the younger twin." He offered with a shrug as if that explained everything, and for him it probably did.
“Jimmy…we’ve both been around Dean long enough to know that he doesn’t take shit from anyone if he doesn’t want too. No this red was the red of earning praise.” He nipped Jimmy’s ear again before growling softly. “It was the same pretty red you turn when you’ve been my Good Boy.”
"Och, I know your name, but you're acting like a moody little pup...and your mate isn't much better judging by his phone presence."
"He's got a point Cas. You've been super aggressive ever since.." Gabriel started to add before trailing off before he finished. "You won't be helpful to Dean in this condition."
The Omega seemed scared, his eyes flitting around the room without seeing anything or landing on anything or anyone for more than a few seconds before moving on. Castiel watched as he scented the air trying to get a read on him and Meg.
"Take the bee out of your bonnet Cassie. I'm making some mini pies to go out today. They're quick and easy and everyone loves pie! But why don't you get Adonis here a shirt and an apron."
The next forty-eight hours were pure absolute torture. Gabriel took Sam home and kept him there. Balthazar became a shadow lurking behind Meg and Charlie, deeply intrigued by the facility and how it ran along with the multitude of services offered. And he and Benny had to be pulled apart and patched up four times, their underlying tension coming to a head. Jimmy wisely chose to stay to himself and took time to explore the town, stating at one point that he was thinking of moving there and opening a bookstore.
The silence wore on for long moments until it was broken by a pained snarled from Lucifer as Dean wrenched his arm up higher against his back.
Jimmy glared at him before he blew out a breath. "I'm still not used to this logical side of you. Maybe you're growing up."
Castiel didn't know how it happened, or even who this Adam was but now he had unresolved beef with an unknown 4 year old because he insulted his niece. He allowed himself to be hurried through his morning routine, stopping only to put on the sock monkey hat that Claire had given him for his birthday before the two of them headed off towards the only pumpkin patch in town.  His old truck bounced along the rutted road and he allowed himself to think of the last time he'd been down this way. The hard clench of his heart at the memory however had him shaking his head and focusing on the road. It was fall after all and even though it was the middle of the morning deer could still jump out of nowhere.
"You said...you said you almost ripped out Jimmy's throat when you found him in my heat room...what stopped you?"
He knew he couldn't control the tone or inflection of his voice but at the moment he didn't care, all he cared about was finding out what happened. Dimly he was aware of Meg's gaze flicking back and forth between Gadreel and himself, her eyebrow arched questioningly but it was just another thing he couldn't bring himself to care about right then.
"Dammit Jack...you and...and Cas. Bells...we need bells." He trailed off, his chest aching painfully for a moment before he shook his head and held out the crystal to Jack.
There came another tittering of laughter from his class and he shot them a look, his eyebrow arched dangerously before he turned his attention back to the two officers.
Ash's voice broke through his thoughts and he flashed the other Alpha a grateful though slightly confused smile.
That had been the last straw for his mate and that night was the worst fight he and Dean had had to date.   Dean’s voice had been calm and controlled ice as he instructed Samandriel to take Lucas from the room and to call Sam to come and pick them all up. The young Alpha balked for a moment, his brain at odds with his innate sense to stay and protect his Omega father and doing what he was told. In the end a soft word from Dean had him hurrying to boy Dean’s wish. The fury foiling in his mates green-gold eyes was the only indication of his anger and it kept Castiel pinned to the spot as they waited for Sam to arrive.
"Have a good night Cher. Try not to get choked out again. Unless it's in the fun way." He looked back at the fire and chuckled before starting towards the door. "I'd get out of here Cher before the cops show up."
"Oh that's right! He's mating Dean's brother isn't he? Now there's an odd couple if I've ever seen one."
It took a while before he found the pattern, but once he realized what it was it was glaringly obvious.
Gripping the arm of the man that had been tackled stood Dean, his head bent forwards as he spoke in a low tone. The more Castiel looked at the man in cuffs he could see it was a younger man, probably not more than a teenager. Dean waved off the other two officers and lead the cuffed male away, placing him in the back of his car and taking off.
At the fork in the road he turned right and followed the hand painted signs for Singers Farmstead and Salvage Yard. The signs looked to have been painted recently, the lettering a bright green with orange drop shadow to make them pop and grab a persons attention. Humming to himself he looked over and watched as Claire stared out of the windows watching the farm land pass; the stalks of corn already browning and starting to fold in on themselves and the cows off in the far field idly wandering the gently rolling hills.  Soon they were pulling into the cleared parking lot and Castiel was surprised to see so many cars there that early. In fact there were people standing out at the entrance chatting over steaming hot cups of something or the other that were being sold near the front gates as they waited for them to open.
A litany of dirty talk flowed from his lips when they weren't pressed against Dean's throat and he growled as Dean's nails found purchase in his skin, leaving stinging lines behind. For the moment Dean seemed content with the pace, the pull and drag letting them both feel every sensation but it wasn't long before Dean started pushing back him and in one swift movement Castiel found himself on his back with Dean grinning down at him.
Castiel leaned in and took Dean's face between his hands, gently running his thumbs over Dean's cheeks. Lightly he brushed his lips over Dean's, nosing his cheek softly. He felt Dean slowly melt, the blonde pressing against his hand as he sighed.
A soft smile filtered over his face and he raised his cup back up for a drink only to find that his cup was empty again. He contemplated going back in for a third cup when he heard the soft sound of breathy laughter from kitchen, with a grimace he set his cup down and resolved to book himself a hotel room for the remainder of his stay. Getting up he stretched and folded his blanket, setting his borrowed pillow on top and calling out before heading into the kitchen.
"Easy Alpha's. Calm down. Save some of that anger for when we get into the auction." Meg soothed, her voice low and calm as she looked around at them.
"Don't ever change Cas." He grinned as he gave Castiel's hand another squeeze before taking the bag back into both hands and turning it over as he admired the craftsmanship of it. "This is honestly the best D-bag I've ever gotten."
"Meg...Charlie probably already knows. A) She's a master at finding out any and all information on any person she chooses. B) She vets every single person that she allows to work at Moondoor." He watched the blood drain away from Meg's face. "And she's by your side. She understands what it means to survive in the environment you were in. She also understands forgiveness and atonement. You maybe been 'bad' at one point Meg but now you're.."
"Ok, ok. Calm down Michael." Dean's voice was placating, his scent amplified with calming pheromones.
Silence was thick around them and Castiel felt his blood run cold. He knew his brother wasn't a fan of the Winchesters, he had always felt that Dean was a bad influence on him when they were growing up but he'd never thought that his brother would ever be that callous. He risked a look over at Dean and seen the ashen look to the man's face as he hugged the younger boy close.
The man's eyes narrowed before a smirk played over his lips but he said nothing as he turned and lead the two of them to a different room. The room itself was set up like any ordinary dressing room; three doors leading to presumably individual rooms for changing, a couple full length mirrors, a semi circle of seating so that whoever was trying on their outfit could come out for criticism from their partners. There were wall sconces that held flickering candles and on a small wooden end table sat another tray with drinks and some crackers and cheese. The chairs provided for them were overstuffed leather wingbacks with ottomans sitting slightly off center.
There was something off about Dean's tone prompting him to sit up and wrap his arms around the Omega, resting his head on Dean's shoulder. Gently he mouthed at the smooth skin of Dean's throat, his mind flashing an image of a bite mark sitting just right where it could be easily seen by all.
Jimmy stiffened at the snarled question, his eyes flashing red at him as he climbed out of bed and moved into Castiel's personal space. They stood there staring, their canines dropped as they began circling one another. Castiel felt his muscles tighten and he prepared himself for the lunge but stopped when Meg pushed her way between them.
"Just talking about you growing up with this one Brotha. Nothing bad." Benny grinned before tossing a wink at Castiel. "Unless you want us to share some of your more rowdy stories with him."
"We're f-fine." Castiel ground out, the wide eyed innocent look on Dean's face making his pulse pick up. "Tell Bobby we'll be right there."
Their wings tightened around them, iridescent black meshing with emerald and bronze to create a safe dark haven for them as they clung to one another. Time lost all meaning as they reconnected on every level and plane after so long apart with vows whispered between kisses to never be parted again. Neither aware as the other two Angels disappeared with a slight ruffling of feathers to leave them to their rediscovery of one another.
"This is amazing. There's something...I can't place the taste." The taller one said as he took another bite of his piece.
Castiel's eyes narrowed as Gabriel continued to grin at him but nothing else was said on the subject and for that he was grateful even if he was sure he'd be thinking about it for the rest of the night. After they each finished another beer they bid each other goodnight and Castiel found himself staring at the ceiling long into the night thinking over his conversation with his brother.
"Moondoor. Everyone got brought back here...well everyone but that Alastair guy. Talk about a piece of work. That guy is a total douche. All the Omegas are being checked in by the on site staff. They have a lot of room here y'know, able to take all these poor souls in and get them started back on the right path."
Jimmy rubbed his hand over his face as he headed back into the living room where he dropped down on the sofa with a groan. He leaned up only long enough to take Lucifer's untouched drink and downed it as he looked up at Castiel.
In what seemed like no time at all; and he had to admit that his nap must have been deeper than he previous thought; he felt someone shaking his shoulder. Growling he shoved at the person in question without opening his eyes.
"It might seem that way to you but to your Oma it brought up years of bad memories. Your Grandfather, your Oma's father wasn't a good man. He was...gruff and very...hands on. He lost his mate when your Oma was very young. He started to drink and when he drank he was mean. One time when your Oma couldn't have been more than 7 years old he and your Uncle Sam were outside playing. Sam was only 2 and you know how young pups are, they aren't very quiet. Your Oma tried to keep Sam as quiet as possible and at the time I thought it was strange, kids are loud, they're supposed to be. But your Grandfather came storming out of the house and starting yelling at your Oma, demanding to know why he couldn't keep Sam quiet and then he yanked your Oma up by the arm, making him yelp." Castiel's jaw tightened as he lost himself in the memory. "I wanted to step in, but I was only 9 and he was your Oma's father, what right did I have. Anyway I was sent home, and when I seen your Oma a couple days later his arm was bruised from where his father grabbed him, and there were bruises on his face and around his throat."
Castiel had been about to make some sort of sarcastic retort when Dean opened his eyes, the normally green orbs a brilliant molten gold as they stared down at him. It was if all breath had been stolen right from his lungs and the sudden red tint at the edges of his vision let him know that his eyes had gone red. Dean shifted once more, rocking back against him before he surged to his feet and darted away, leaving Castiel confused and panting in the dirt.
He nodded and slid of the stool, grabbing the broom and dustpan from the closet and handing Meg a trash bag before leading the way upstairs. As he took pictures of the mess so to have it on file, his mind kept throwing out the worst case scenarios and there was nothing he could do to stop it.
"At first I took his quietness as his acclimation of moving into his own place full time. But even then after Sam and your brother's honeymoon he continued to be quiet, withdrawn...and according to your brother he pulled away from the nesting therapy and now barely even shows up to the facility. He comes to work at the Sheriff's department but he's locking himself into his office and when he does interact with anyone else he's short tempered and aggressive."
"There's a lack of places where people can feel safe. Whether they're Alpha, Beta, or Omega. We wanted a place that was safe for everyone that we could help them feel comfortable in their own skins, offer them a support system for their times of need."
"I was thinking nothing of the sort. We just don't keep much tea on hand during the warmer months. During the winter ones we normally have five or ten different types to help with seasonal colds and the like." He set the kettle on the stove and turned it on, his shoulders pulled up towards his ears.
It felt as if ice water had suddenly started to pump through Castiel's veins and he couldn't stop the snarl that exploded from his chest. Three more snarls rent the air around him and the scent of Alpha anger curled around them tightly, egging them all on.
He shuttered himself away from the host after that; his grief all consuming until he could stand no more. Under the cover of twilight he made his way to earth and secreted himself away; warding himself from the eyes of the host and shutting down Angel Radio. Once he was left in silence he pulled a shining silver blade that his mate had gifted them as a mating gift and he pressed a kiss to the blade before he pulled his wing around and reaching back as far as he could started to hack away at the appendage. Pain ripped through him but he bit his lip to keep from crying out. Each slash, cut, and hacking motion cut tendons and bones until there was nothing left but the slightest of nubs against his back to even suggest he had wings.
“Professor Novak..Castiel Novak, Professor of Religious History.”  He was grateful that his words came out steady as he looked up at the man. “And you are?” He inquired as he reached up to take the man’s hand.
"Yes..I...I think Dean was....eight when Mary passed. It was..immediately different. Dean went from bright eyed, playful child to.." Castiel's words faltered. "I don't know what Sam's told you, but John..he was not kind to Dean. Dean would miss weeks of school, when he did show back up there would be healing bruises, cast bones. Through it all Dean was expected to care for Sam and the house. My best friend disappeared over night and in his place a quiet boy who never looked up." His eyes strayed away from the fight, taking in Henry's tense posture. "I know he's your son.."
"Benny's just...he's protective. But I'll tell him to cool it. And you two keep your fangs in your mouth where they belong." He smirked slightly as he raised an eyebrow. "Unless of course they're on me."
"Because he's a jerk." She pouted as she looked up at him, her eyes starting to sparkle with tears. "He called my Grumpy Cat hoodie stupid!"
Meg snorted and he shook his head at her but he understood. Looking at Jimmy was like looking in a mirror; they were the same height, had the same intense blue eyes, and the same dark locks. The only differences were that Jimmy's hair was just a bit shorter giving it a more managed look, and his expressions were much more open.
Castiel nipped at Dean's ear, tugging lightly and then tensing up as he felt Dean arch up and moan brokenly as he came hard, his body trembling and the aftershocks of his climax milking Castiel's from him with a howl. The last thrust locked them together as Castiel's knot caught; causing him to bite down on Dean's shoulder to muffle his sound of completion. They panted together, Castiel wrapping his arms around Dean and holding him close as he nosed at the sweatied junction of Dean's shoulder. Rumbling softly he lapped the freshly bruised mating bite, his inner Alpha sated on all fronts at thoroughly marking his Omega again.
A smile ghosted over Samandriel's face and Castiel reached up and patted the young man's face gently. They sat for a few more minutes in silence before they got back on the road. The rest of the ride was quiet but the atmosphere was calm, the two Alpha's enjoying the ride and the company. The feel of the car started to turn the closer they got to Castiel's mother's home. They sat in the drive for a couple of minutes, both of them looking up at the large front porch and the wide bay window. Pulling in a breath Castiel was the first to move, stepping out of the car and smoothing his hands down his shirt as if to brush away any stray wrinkles that might have taken up residence during the ride.
By the time they pulled up in front of the bakery he had run out of things to point out and Meg was contenting herself with making jokes as they passed through town. Taking a breath he looked over at her before getting out and moving around to the back of the vehicle.
"Dean? Ash is here with the order but he brought someone with him...mmhmm...Gabriel's brother?...mmm, ok."
"Hey, Dean."  Chief's voice cut through the chatter and he looked up. "You're lost in your head right now, where did you go."
Dean opened his mouth to ask which one the yes was for but closed it again and looked around the shop once more.
"Alright boys, put 'em away. As much as I would love to see you two pretty boys go at it, now is not the time." She flicked her gaze between them, shaking her head. "Clarence to the corner, Jim back to the bed." She waited for them to comply before speaking again. "Good boys. Now Jim, why are you here and where is Dean?"
Slowly and with his hands held up as he were approaching a wild animal Dean made his way over to the couch where Jack sat.
"You sure? Even if I want you sucking my dick as Cas fucks you open for me so once he's done I can take his place?" The groan Dean gave in response as he rutted between them spurred Jimmy on, his teeth now finding the soft skin just below Dean's ear. "Or maybe while Cas is fucking you, I'm sucking your dick Dean, each thrust from Cas sending further down my throat.."
Castiel looked around again just to make sure they were still alone before he pressed play on the video; the sound turned down so that he had to hold it to Jimmy's ear for him to hear anything.
"Adam?" Before Castiel could even offer and explanation Sam shook his head and barreled on. "Doesn't matter, look we have a problem...a big one."
"Azrael..I don't..." Gabriel's hand faltered, the blade nicking the tender of Dean's throat slightly as it slipped. "I can't.."
A mirthless laugh bubbled out of him as he shook his head; the angel had picked something up from the brothers and it irritated him to no end.
"You know he's not set to give birth for another few months. There's nothing to report." In less than a blink of an eye he had his hand around the shorter Alpha's throat. "Now tell me the real reason why you're here."
She  waved her hand as she played one of the videos; it was grainy like most surveillance cameras tended to be, but there was a clear picture of the rear end of a car that looked like it had come from Dean's house. In the back of his mind Castiel knew it was a long shot, that that car could belong to anyone in the neighborhood, but he held out hope that it didn't and that it was sort of a lead.
"Normally I'm good with immediately. But today I'm moving my brother in with me. I can start tomorrow though for sure."
"I'll be just a moment, I have to let them know that I'm staying behind as well and that they can leave." He murmured softly.
Gabriel shifted closer, wanting nothing more than to pull Dean close and scent him until Dean's scent was the only thing he could smell.
Breathlessly he shook his head as he continued to stare; taking in each feature of the man's face from close up and filing them away. Belatedly his brain realized that the man had brought up CPR and damn if that didn't kick start some rather delicious scenarios that sent a pleasant shiver down his spine.
He wasn't even sure how long he'd been out, only that the sun had risen completely and was now beating down on his back when he returned to the hotel. Drenched in sweat he discarded his clothes on his way back to the shower. This time he took his time under the warm water, his eyes slipping closed with a happy sigh. He had just slipped on a shirt when a knock sounded on the door to his room. Eyebrow arched he opened the door without checking to see who was on the other side. Something he suddenly wished he'd done.
Castiel snared as he took another step forward, his fist clenching at his sides. Smirk in place Crowley took two steps back.
"Means you're both hard headed morons that are somehow so perfectly suited for each other it was practically pre-ordained." Castiel stiffened as she continued. "You both are bloody ridiculous. Call your mate and get him back here."
He nodded, he'd heard of places like that from some of the Omegas that came through his practice and had a small knowledge of what they were. He moved over and sat on the stairs by Dean's feet, his eyes trained on the man's face.
Silence fell between them as he felt Jimmy's chest grow tight as the sensation of tears welled up in his eyes. Gently he reached up and pressed his fingers against the damp trails before pulling them away and studying the shimmering liquid.
"What's with you Novaks?!" Sam snarled, ignoring Dean's command and stepping closer. "First Jimmy, intent on confusing my brother. Then
"I don't have a mate, just an inconvenient scent bond that should already be gone. It's been over two months, he's been gone for over two months. But I can still sell him. He's still there in my scent.." Dean's voice dropped to a plaintive growl, his heart spasming painfully as he went over Alastair's words in his head.
Castiel moved from his chair to stand behind Charlie, looking over shoulder at the pages she had pulled up.
First he loaded up on blankets, picking the softest looking ones first and then setting them on the front porch before returning and grabbing another arm full along with some of the pillows.  Next came the basket of food and case of water. As he set down the sports drinks last the smell of ripe peaches tickled his nose and he swallowed a down a groan. Straightening his back he called out, his voice deep with a growl.
Standing there in perfectly fit jeans, plain tee and a flannel was Dean, his mouth opened in an aborted greeting. Belatedly Castiel realized that while he had donned a shirt he still only had a towel tied around his waist. Swallowing he fought to put on an unaffected air, even going as far as to work a smile onto his face.
"No." He scoffed. "I've worked hard to take a tiny walk on role on some no name tv show that only wanted me for like three episodes and turned it into a brand. I've done countless cameos in movies with this character and this will discredit it all."
Castiel looked up from the envelope to find Crowley already gone and Dean looking at him curiously. With a shrug he slipped the envelope into one of his back pockets and pressed a kiss to Dean's temple before gently pulling the blonde back to the others. They had better things to concentrate on for the day, his family was all gathered in one place and as he looked around he felt more settled and full than he could ever remember being.
"Hello Fergus...why yes I did speak with him....did he now? Seems he has quite the temper, though for a warrior line I'd expect nothing less...I wouldn't worry too much about your manhood..." With a sigh she ended the call, effectively cutting off the Alpha on the other end. "Alright now that that's over and done with, how about a cup of tea?"
Dead eyed he looked down at his once beautiful wings; the greens and golds of his feather spattered in blood and bits of muscle and bone from his frenzied cutting. Fire set into the mangled nubs of his wings and he swallowed down the pain as he started to pull the feathers from the wings, creating piles of feathers good to sell as they were and others that needed cleaned.  He knew humans valued Angel feathers for magical properties and that by selling off the remnants of his own would allow him to life comfortably.
The two lapsed into a comfortable silence the warm intimate moment lulling them into a post sex doze only for it to be broken by a pounding on their trailer door. Neither one moved though they didn't need to in the end as whomever was on the other side called out loudly even as they continued to pound on the door.
At his side Meg nudged him and he pressed his lips together to keep from snarling at her. Taking a deep breath he moved over to the line of chairs and dropped down heavily into one, taking his phone out and checking the time.  He thought briefly about calling Gabriel and letting his brother know he was back in town but thought better of it, besides Gabriel always did like surprises.
Dean's face turned bright red as he to looked away. "After I called him your name. Sam told me, he was pretty..ah..he was pretty angry that Jimmy didn't say anything himself at first. I'm sure Sam wanted to hurt him, he still might I don't know.."
Once they arrived Charlie ushered them into her office and shut the door, taking her customary seat behind her desk.
Adam's brow furrowed and for the first time the younger man seemed to let his guard down a bit. "Omega trafficking?"
Castiel froze before he stalked forwards again, side stepping Meg when she tried to move back into his way and curling his hands into Jimmy's shirt and driving him backwards into one of the walls.
“I…uh…” Dean looked around, the light red on his cheeks going a bit darker before he cleared his throat; his words coming out rushed. “IwasmakingaTikTok.”
Settling down in his room he allowed himself the time to flop back onto the large queen size bed and soak up the quiet for a few moments, his eyes fluttering shut every now and then. His phone buzzed, bringing him out of his fugue like state and without moving too much he fished it from his jeans the text icon flashing at him repeatedly. Thumbing open his messages he let himself grin as Dean's name lit up.
The longer Castiel stayed hidden the less the conversation made sense. Maybe it was some sort of DND thing that Dean was into and they were working out some sort of plot line. Watching as Dean's shoulders tensed more and the brunette hunched over in a protective stance was the deciding factor that Castiel had had enough. He straightened up and moved away from his hiding place, a cocky smirk on his face as he strolled over towards the trio.
"Yeah..the worse part was how dead his eyes were. My brother didn't follow commands at all before it all happened, but when I brought him home he'd do anything without hesitation, never questioning anything he was told to do." Sam shook his head before looking down at him. "He's better now, but he's still not...he's not Dean. He tries, and he tries hard but I can still see the shadow there, the fear lurking deep down waiting to strike. I know it will never ever truly be gone, but it's going to be hard when he moves out full time. I won't be there to protect him, Gabriel won't be there to drag him to their nest after a nightmare.."
"New new then. Follow me." Chief turned and headed towards a door on the other side of room; pushing it open easily and then waiting for Dean to step inside.
"What's been done so far?" He turned to Meg, trying to focus her and not on the man turning an ashen grey the longer he laid  on the gurney.
His Alpha preened under Dean's words and his growl rumbled softly as he leaned in to nuzzle Dean's temple.
"Calm down James. If you're so worried about it, why don't you see about trying to spend some time with Dean."
The room was deathly silent, Jimmy's angered scent joining Dean's and raising the tension in the room by 10 fold.
Though Dean's tone was gruff if was easy to see that he was working to put that tone on. Castiel teased one more kiss before Dean pushed him towards the door.
"It's ok, you're not going to hurt me Alpha." Cool lips pressed against his brow and he whined softly in his throat. "C'mon Alpha, take care of me. Take care of your Omega."
"I don't know about that. They play off each other well, almost two perfect halves of a whole. Though I was surprised to see that they were in fact getting mated. Gabriel has always stated that he didn't want to settle down that way."
7 am came earlier than Dean realized and he sipped at his thermos of home brew blearily, blinking and rubbing at his eyes alternately as he waited. He wasn't sure when his eyes slipped closed but the sound of something scraping against the pavement of the alleyway had them snapping open as he looked around.
Doing as he was told Castiel took the second suit and swapped them out, smoothing his hand down the green vest as he looked at himself in the mirror before going back out. He had to admit he did like that suit better than the first one, it fit better across the shoulders than the other and the pant legs seemed to be a bit wider. Stepping out he mimicked Dean's stance earlier, arms wide as he looked at Crowley.
There had been the initial introduction when the younger Omega had answered the door and for a moment shock had ruled his reactions but then set in anger and Castiel had to restrain himself from placing himself between the two. Even Henry stayed quiet as he watched them; Rowena's quiet instructions to let Adam and Dean sort this out between them clear in their minds.
The smile on Castiel’s face grew and he pressed his face against the side of Jimmy’s throat, humming softly before he pulled away to answer, his voice soft as if he were afraid someone would over hear him.
"Don't. I know he was an ass, but he abandoned us, abandoned them. Who knows how many other siblings we have out there."
"Gadreel is a Heath Companion at the Moondoor Facility, Benny too and they've...assisted Dean with his heats for a while."
It was Ash's turn to look confused and he shook his head as they took a curve just a little too fast.
He narrowed his eyes again at his brother; snapping his teeth at him in annoyance as the other had the audacity to look smug as he crossed his arms over his chest.
"Come now James, is that any way to treat your brothers? Besides we just met Cassie here. We should get to know better dontcha think?"
"Truly regrettable." Castiel's lips twisted into a similar snarl as he stared at the blonde headed man. "I'm Castiel."
A shuffling sound from the hall drew their attention and Gadreel reached out and quickly ran his wrist over the sleeve of Castiel shirt before stepping away to help Ash unpack the boxes.
Rowena shooed Dean off, and Castiel followed quietly; taking a seat on the edge of the bed as his mate moved around the room gathering clean clothes.
"You two are so much alike. Daddy issues galore, willing to follow orders blindly if it means getting the praise you crave." Blue eyes flicked around though the man stayed quiet; bringing a huff from the blonde. "If there were ever two people more suited for each other it would be Castiel and Dean Winchester; The righteous man and the angel that lifted him the depths of hell. Two men so entrenched in whatever feelings they have for the other they can't even speak it aloud for fear of...something.."
"I guess you kind of know. But your brother over there." He followed the eye line of Crowley's finger even though he knew where it was pointed. "James is your twin, parted at birth I'm afraid."
They traded soft kisses as they pressed together, Dean relaxing further into the embrace in their little make shift nest. With a gentle push he eased Dean back and began feeding him from the plate that Gabriel had left, taking a bite himself after every two that Dean took. There was no need for them to talk, right then it was nothing more than an Alpha caring for his pregnant Omega and seeing to their every need in the moment. When the plate was empty and Dean was tucked back against his scent gland Castiel let his thoughts wander, each and every one of them centered on what was the most suffering he could inflict on Alistair before allowing him to die while a few strayed to John Winchester and what awaited him.
The night hadn't been kind to Castiel; he'd tossed and turned and multiple times he'd picked up his phone to text Dean. He never sent any of them though, afraid of what Dean's answers might be, or worse that he'd get no answers at all. When the morning light finally crept through his bedroom window he pulled himself from his bed and trudged his way to the kitchen, intent on drinking at least three full pots of coffee in order to help clear his head. He glared at the coffee pot as if it would make the machine work any faster, the slow drip making his eye twitch and his hands clench at his sides. His attention was taken off the coffee maker by a knock on the door and he snarled as he moved over and yanked the door open, his eyes narrowed in annoyance.
A flush worked it's way across Castiel's face as the image of Dean "trussing him up" flashed behind his eyes. Groaning he shifted on the bed, his skin heating up and his forehead breaking out in a light sweat. He sat up and shook his head in an attempt to get rid of the errant thoughts, now wasn't the time for them. Pushing himself off the bed he typed back a short message saying he'd be there in a bit and then headed into the bathroom for a cold shower to finish clearing his mind.
"Heaven is supposed to be a place of calm, a place of peace. I know what my son was thinking by bringing you here. He knows I value my family more than anything. But you do not belong here John Winchester. I may not have pulled you out of hell but I can make sure you end up back there." Dean let a smile cross his face, though it was devoid of warmth. "You were thought to be the righteous man once a upon time but even the Demons of Hell seen you were twisted and broken. You were one of them from the beginning."
He laughed as he gave a nod of his head. "I can understand that, then I must insist that you call me Castiel, or Cas. Whichever suits you better. I'm a little shocked to see you here rather than back at the facility."
The three of them headed back towards their trailer, Jimmy leading while Dean and Cas followed more sedately. Dean was flipping through the pages, scanning for the lines he was going to read, his head tilted slightly to the side and not looking where he was going and ended up running into Castiel's back when they stopped.
He knew he was wearing a dopey smile; the expression completely wrong for the situation that they were currently in but Castiel couldn't for the life of him keep it off his lips. He loped down the stairs of the front porch, the garbled sound of what was probably cursing made his smile bigger. It might be a mark in the bad Alpha column but knowing that John Winchester was uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form brought him a sense of dark satisfaction.
"No Dean, you're not going to rip his lungs out. We're just going to make him cater Becky's fanfiction weekly meet ups." Castiel grumbled as he settled into a more comfortable position that he was sure wasn't crushing his mate. He shifted around for a moment, making sure that both he and Dean had a good, no stress view of Rowena, his eyes slipping closed as Dean's walls clenched around him and milked another climax out of him. After a couple moments his ability to string together coherent sentences returned and he focused on Rowena.
Dean's breathy groan pulled a deeper answering groan Castiel and he rocked against the blonde harder before slowing back down and grinding against Dean again. One of the other things he loved about sleepy morning Dean was that the blonde was more in tune with the softer side of his inner Omega, Dean purred more and louder and was more responsive. He also allowed Castiel to take care of him more without his usual walls in place. It wasn't that he didn't love all the parts of his headstrong mate, but he enjoyed the few times where Dean let his guard down and let someone else take the reigns. No one else got to see those parts of Dean and it appeased his inner Alpha that only he got to see his mate that way.
"We'll find him Cas. Maybe nothing happened, maybe he caught someone trying to break in or already in the house and he's out chasing them. This is Dean we're talking about."
After meeting with Adam things returned to a slightly more stable version of normal; Dean backing down slightly with his need for contact with packmates and his mood swings slowing to a more sedate speed with the pregnancy. One thing Castiel was pleased to see stick around were the bi-weekly Omega nights where Gabriel, Amelia, Dean, and sometimes Meg would spend hours in a specially constructed nest that was created from clothing from each member of the pack so that they were surrounded by the soothing scents of their pack. It helped ease anxiety and let the pregnant Omegas get some much needed deep sleep.
The air was tense and Castiel found it hard to breathe with the way Dean’s jaw would clench every time he glanced Castiel’s way.   There was some silent communication between the brothers before Dean kissed each pup goodbye and once the door was closed behind Sam the fear in Castiel’s stomach ramped up and filled the air around him. The anger in Dean’s eyes went from roiling to a low blaze and if Castiel’s knee’s hadn’t locked up he knew he would have crumpled to the floor. Everyone had heard of the rumors that surrounded Omega Rage, old wives tales of Omega’s ripping apart anyone that hurt or threatened their pups and it looked like Castiel himself was about to witness it first hand.
As they cleaned up their nest and aired out the house they paused for frequent touches, scentings, and heated kisses, neither one of them wanting the time to end though they didn't give voice to those thoughts. After putting the last bit of soiled laundry into the trunk of his car, Castiel leaned against the cool metal watching Dean lock up the house. A smile crawled over his face as he took in the still thoroughly debauched look of the Omega, a swell of pride in his chest at being the one to make Dean look that way.
"My brother is trying a new line of 'medicinal' baked goods and as you can see we're not in the best part of town. Just last week we had an attempted robbery but fortune favored us and a couple of officers stopped in randomly for some coffee."
Dean leaned his head back and rubbed his cheek against Castiel's as he purred softly, and Castiel's eyes closed in contentment as he savored the feeling. For a moment longer the world just consisted of them. The illusion was shattered a second later when Rowena called up the stairs that they'd better be moving their arses or else she'd come up there and retrieve them herself. With a sigh Castiel kissed the bolt of Dean's jaw and pulled away, smoothing down his shirt and then opening the door for the brunette.
Hearing Henry call him Dean's mate made Castiel's Alpha rumble happily and he felt his eyes slip into Alpha red. A sudden up take in noise drew his attention away from Henry and back to the brothers and he watched as Dean swept Sam's legs and shoved at his chest at the same time. The move sent Sam down to the dirt where Dean dropped his knee across Sam's throat to keep him pinned.
"Well I don't know how I can even compete with Dean's toast so I won't even try. Instead all I will say is that it has been long believed that everyone has their perfect half out there somewhere and those that are lucky find them. Somehow Sam drew the celestial card that linked him to Gabriel and though I will never understand why, it's clear to anyone that looks at them that they balance each other out, they support one another and they are so grossly in love that we're all going to need insulin shots after this. May they have a long and happy mating."
"Tell me about him." Henry's voice was soft as if he was worried about what he was asking would set Dean back into another panic attack.
"Same here, the last time I was here was right after your Senior year homecoming dance." A fond smile ghosted over Dean's lips.  "But Sam and I found the deed in Grandpa Henry's things this past winter. I come out here once a week when the weather is nice."
Time had been kind to his friend, he had filled out nicely and even gained a few inches it seemed; his hair was a slightly darker honeyed color than the last time he'd seen him, but his eyes were still the same vibrant green he remembered. He opened his mouth to say something when Dean looked up, a smile on his face before he leaped at him from the top of the porch, sending Castiel back to the ground.
It was Castiel's turn to sigh as he rolled his eyes. "We're friends, he was only spending what little free time he had with me."
"No. Unless of course I can work with the Winchesters and find a secure place, well warded to keep all manner of things out.  But can you deal with just snippets of time with them?"
His cheeks burned even hotter and cleared his throat before speaking again. "I just wanted to let whoever was in here know I was coming in, but then you looked like you were in the middle of an important conversation with the machine and I didn't want to take your attention away from that. We all know machines can sense weakness and will attack when the time is right.
Sleep didn't come easy for Castiel, in fact he'd have been lucky to have gotten two hours total the entire night. He stood on the balcony of his hotel room sipping his coffee as the sun rose, the inky black bleeding into lavender then orange and gold before fading to light blue. His lips curled into a grimace, the day had no right to dawn as bright as it had as if the world wasn't missing a beloved person, as if he wasn't missing his mate.
"Dad...it's a Vampire movie, no one expects anyone to live unless is the character that the Vampire wants to kiss. Duhh." She rolled her eyes and mimicked his stance.
Gabriel rolled his eye and let out a put upon sigh. "All that flirting you two were doing. I was worried I have to start advertising the shop as an Adult shop and put in place an age limit for visitors."
"N-no. Gabriel and Anna were mine biologically. But you and Raphael..your father brought you to me." She huffed, setting her shoulders straight. "He told me that your mothers were unfit, that he couldn't leave his children with them. That he knew I would love you as my own. And I do. You're my pups.."
"Then what? What happened? Grief as terrible as you say doesn't just go away, it just doesn't resolve itself."
He was taken back by the hostility, Sam Winchester had always been a kind hearted polite boy and yet the young man standing in front of him looked as if he wanted nothing more than to leap over the counter and throttle him.  His mouth moved silently for a moment before he cleared his own throat and focused on the sign again.
"Like I thought, we had some stiff competition, you three were the best of the best we had here today and it's a hard choice to make. But, first place goes to Mr. LaFitte, 2nd place to Mr. Winchester and Milligan, and 3rd place to Ms. Braeden. Hopefully we see you three again next year. I can't wait to see what you come up with for that. And don't forget that we have the Fall Bake Sale to help raise money for the town coming in mid October."
Dean glanced back at the clock keeping track of the competition time and nodded, they had plenty of time. He pulled out his phone and found a pretty easy recipe for homemade Vanilla Ice cream and after pulling out all the ingredients he and Adam got to work, both grinning and playfully nudging each other out of the way.
Jimmy’s voice was something of a soothing balm to Castiel’s irritated nerves but he nodded as he pushed himself up from his chair. Taking a breath Castiel looked around, noticing for the first time how everyone was keeping their distance but were casting curious glances his way. Huffing a non-committal noise, he nudged Jimmy’s shoulder before he turned to head back to their trailer as the sudden need to be out of the line of everyone’s sight settled in the pit of his stomach. He had just unlocked the trailer door when he heard voices heading his way.
A quick shower and a couple more teasing jabs at his brother, Castiel found himself slowly walking down the main street staring into all the shop windows as he went. There were a few that he ducked into and studied closer, making small purchases at a few before finally running across Charlie's bookstore.
Gabriel took the paper and looked over it before nodding. "Yeah, Dean didn't roll in until about 4 am, not that it mattered."
Castiel felt his cheeks heat up and he cleared his throat before heading around the front of the car, offering Dean his elbow.
"Dean, this is Castiel our Earth Sciences Teacher, Cas this is Dean our new Librarian and my Handmaiden." Charlie cut in, a smirk tilting her lips up at the side as she watched them interact.
"Why?" He was genuinely confused and he pushed himself out of bed and moved over to stand behind Dean, his hands reaching out to touch his hips.
"I wanted to talk to you.." He said weakly. "Dean I didn't know...I didn't..." He began as tears started to gather in his eyes.  "I never knew what my Father said to you.."
"No, if Gabriel wished it, Azrael would have already been dead." Sam's voice was soft as he watched the two battle. "He mourned you. There wasn't a place in the heaven's that didn't feel Azrael's grief..he was locked away, his anger too great to be allowed free reign.  Father was worried..."
This was supposed to be a completely smutty chapter, however feeelings worked their way in and well..this happened. Enjoy!
Dean shifted from foot to foot as he watched them try each pie in turn, Adam adding some ice cream before drizzling a little bit of the honey over the small offering before stepping back next to him. The smaller man arched his eyebrow before tucking into his piece, the man next to him humming loudly as he took another bite of the pie with the honey drizzled ice cream.
He didn't know how long they stayed like that, the two of them enjoying the quiet but when Chief's fingers disappeared he let out a soft whine of disappointment. An equally soft laugh had him opening one eye to look up at the other man, a pout that he'd absolutely deny later, twisting his lips.
The man's voice was clipped, his British accent condescending as he looked at Dean, one corner of his lips tilted up in the smug smirk. Immediately Dean's hackles rose and he glanced over at Gabriel and seen his normally carefree boss glaring as if he could smite the man in front of him.
"Finally!" Gabriel huffed when his eyes caught sight of him.  "Talk some sense into your mate before I cuff him too and toss him into the one of the cars."
The sound of the shorter man's name being called made them both jump and they turned to look at Castiel whom was standing in the doorway of the office with his arms folded over his chest.
From the exuberance of the voice and the causal nicknames it was easy to tell it was Gabriel that had been sent to fetch them.  With traded soft smiles and playful shoves the two men dressed quickly; Jimmy in dark dress slacks with a white button down and Castiel in worn jeans and faded black shirt. They stole a couple short kisses before making their way to set.
His father shook his head and leaned against one of the hollowed out shells behind him, his arms crossed over his chest. For a moment Castiel was sure that the older Alpha wasn't going to answer but then the other man started to talk.
Castiel pulled over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine; turning to look at the young man. He reached out and took Samandriel's hands in his, holding them firmly.
The words were dripping in sarcasm and with flick of his wrist he watched the man tensed, his skin turning  a flushed red color. A soft groan errupted from the dark haired man, the sound deep and growled as he surged to his feet and took a few shuddered steps backwards.
"Hands off my suit Puppy." Crowley's voice was low and there was a twinge of red around his iris. "You bloody American Pure Alpha's. All rage, no decorum."
coiling through Castiel's stomach and he jerked back as Dean launched himself at Gabriel, a loud thunder clap sounding as they crashed together. Between one blink and the next there suddenly 6 sets of wings visible; 3 a bright golden color and the other 3 a familiar mix of dark greens and bronzes. Transfixed Castiel watched as Dean and Gabriel grappled, thunder and lightening accompanying each strike that landed.
It wasn't until the frigid, angry scent of Omega anger--bordering more on Omega Rage--broke through that he and Sam separated, both of them bleeding from noses and mouths as eyes started to swell shut.
A knock on the door drew both their attention to the large oak door and Castiel took a step back, using moment to head back over to the chair he'd been in and retaking the seat.  A tossed "come in" brought a brown hair, scruffy faced Omega into the room.
"That is true, what with mine being the much better looking version." Castiel grinned at Jimmy's eyeroll. "Anyway, I have..something of import to show you."
"Yes Sam. He's our brother. I figured you'd like not being the baby anymore." Sam glowered at him before turning to stare out of the car window. "Well he's staying with you. He'll cramp my style." He finally grumbled.
The blonde's grin was infectious and Castiel found himself nodding as an answering smile quirked his lips.
Castle's eyes narrowed even further as he watched his brother seemingly flirt with the younger Winchester. Something wasn't right, Gabriel seemed more "into" Sam rather than his mate to be. And he knew Sam practically his entire life, there was no way that Sam would hurt his brother,they were close--closer than any brothers he'd ever come across. The picture that was starting to click together was one he didn't like and he felt his lips thin in anger. He was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of snapping and when his gaze refocused Gabriel was standing way too close, forcing Castiel to take a step back to create some air between them.
Gabriel was the first to break the silence by clapping his hands and calling out to Ash as the blonde wandered by the door.
“Well now that Sammy’s in school he doesn’t need as much, and I get residuals from my films that all go into an account that only Sammy has access to for his books and general living expenses. I don’t need as much.”
"Oh! The pizza's cold." Gabriel looked down at the boxes in his hand, a frown on his face at not being able to provide his Omega with a warm meal.
"Why are you here?" Dean's voice, though muffled from under Castiel's shoulder was still demanding. "And how the hell did you get in here?"
"Handmaiden?" The confusion on his face had both Dean and Charlie laughing and he felt the warmth from earlier creep back into his face.
"Well then I'll catch you around Boss, don't be a stranger. Maybe we can talk more about your...movie preferences."
"True Mates...you both thought you were True Mates? It never crossed your minds that you were related? I mean you look dead identical but instead of thinking you're family you went with True Mates.." Meg's tone was mocking as she flicked her eyes between the two.
He pulled away, his tongue flicking out to clean away the thick, heady liquid from his lips as he stared up into Dean's eyes the pupils ringed by only a sliver of gold. He slowly worked his way back up to Dean's lips, teasing kisses as his hands skimmed up over Dean's hips and sides. As much as he wanted to follow what his Alpha was pushing for he couldn't follow through just yet. Stealing one last soft kiss he pulled back, looking down at Dean's flushed face.
"Dean! Omega! I come with food and items for a nest." His eyes darted from window to window for some visual sign of Dean even as the smell of peaches started to try and wrap around his mind.
The large man moved up next to him and started the video he’d recorded. In it Dean was running with the dog—Colonel—only a couple steps behind him. The video seemed to have been filmed in slow motion and he took a moment to just admire the way Dean moved; his bowlegs catching his attention and bringing forward some rather salacious thoughts that were better suited towards a late night in his own home.
Dean's jaw tightened and Castiel snapped his mouth shut as he waited. After a moment or two Dean took a deep breath, his eyes darting to Castiel's face and then away again as he started to speak.
His thoughts ran around in the same vein until he found himself finally falling asleep, his hand clutched in Henry's shirt as if he was afraid the older Omega would disappear on him as tears leaked steadily down his cheeks.
"Well Eileen for sure, Charlie and her girlfriend Stevie, Jody and Donna, Claire I think was coming, and Rowena I think said she was coming too."
"He does seem to take charge easily." Castiel's murmured as he draped himself over Jimmy's back and nipping at his earlobe. "Imagine him doing that to you...hearing him order you to your knees so he can fuck your face. You'd like that wouldn't you Jimmy? Would you be as good a boy for Dean as you are for me?"
"Alright, we've got less than two hours to get this all put together. Ash has jumped in and pulled around some body cameras and micro-mics so that we can see and hear what's going on." She nodded at Balthazar then, indicating that he had the floor.
Castiel chuckled as he moved over and put a hand on Dean's shoulder. He ignored the way his hand tingled from the innocent contact and focused on the brilliant green eyes that were locked on him. He leaned in until his lips were just brushing the shell of Dean's ear--it was a dick move he knew, but the resulting shiver from the young man was worth it.
"Another Winchester?" Gabriel groaned as he hid his face in Sam's shoulder. "Where do you all keep coming from?"
"Technically, but the Alpha mates line was pretty cloudy unable to find just where they came from or if there were Beta's in their line."
"Is that what you want?"  Castiel reached down and cupped Dean's face his thumb rubbing over Dean's lower lip before pressing in gently, a hiss escaping him as Dean began to suckle lightly on the digit. "Because I can think of multiple different things I'd like to do to and with you that will require multiple nights to cover and that doesn't even begin to touch on what Jimmy wants.."
The layout was identical to any other coffee shop he'd ever been to over the years. Long wooden serving counter with a pastry case at the end filled with the sweets of the day, a row of different coffee machines behind the counter to make any number of drinks from plain black coffee to fancy teas, and a mixture of tables and comfortable arms chairs strewn about the main area. Off to the side and towards the back there seemed to be a small stage like set up and for a moment Dean allowed himself a grimace at the thought of beat poetry.
"Yeah, yeah. Big Strong Alpha watching over the weak Omegas." Meg quipped as she came up behind him.
Benny flipped the phone back towards himself and after punching around a couple of moments turned it back towards him. On the screen another K-9 police officer was doing the exact same thing Dean and Colonel had been doing but the music seemed to add another depth to it.
Castiel whipped around, blinking at Sam before looking back at the fighting. How they hadn't drawn a crowd yet amazed him and he must have said so out loud because he heard Sam chuckle beside him.
"You're very good at this." Castiel murmured against Dean's ear, his hand splayed against the man's lower back.
"I couldn't ask that of your Gadreel. Besides I don't think the Sheriff's office would let you be away for long."
"We're open 7am Monday through Saturday and close at 9.  We're not open Sundays. Is that a problem for you?"
"At least you're showered. Why don't you put on some blockers Clarence, you're going to choke out everyone we come across."
"We..we thought were True Mates..." Castiel's voice was no louder than Jimmy's and his face no less red.
It wasn't soon enough that he was pulling up to the mausoleum and he popped the trunk, another shiver trickling down his spine and he looked around to make sure that he was alone. As he closed the trunk he heard something snap off to the side and he whirled around, eyes wide but still he could see nothing and he swallowed thickly as he started towards the building. Using the electric lock pick that he'd gotten from local law enforcement at some point he let himself into the building, shivering violently as a blast of cold air rushed at him.
"Well we don't know unless we ask him. It's quite simple Jimmy, you're making it harder than it needs to be."
Castiel tightened his arms out of reflex, a soft growl vibrating his chest at the thoughts that Dean's words planted. He pulled in a big lungful of Dean's calming scent, the normally light peach and leather scent laced with a sweet undercurrent of cream.
"She's right..being angry now isn't going to help anyone." Sam cut in, his voice more even but his scent still radiating anger.
"These preggo Omega...feeelings. They have me all screwed up." Dean scrunched his nose up before huffing and crossing his arms.
"Kinda harsh there weren't you Cas?" Jimmy asked as he stood up, his eyes flicking over to where Dean was still standing with his back towards the two of them. "Dean?" He questioned as he took a step forwards, wondering if maybe Castiel had pushed the young man too far.
They stopped and looked at one another, both of them watching the intensely and if the urge to just touch Dean early had been unbearable then the pure want to kiss him was going to be Castiel's death. Forcing himself to look away he carefully pushed himself to a standing position, wincing slightly but idly noting that most of the sting from the rock salt buckshot had subsided.
Brows knitted together Castiel turned around to see his brother straddling Dean with his nose pressed against the blonde's throat. His eyebrow was cocked as he set the cup down on the table a soft growl rumbling in the back of his throat; coughing to cover it up he settled himself down in one of the other chairs.
Dean came over and waited as he dutifully sniffed, the scent of worried Omega starting to fill the room. With a head shake he reached out and wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and pulled the Omega into his lap. Gently he mouthed at Dean's mating mark as his fingers moved slowly over the bared skin.
Though it was framed as a question, Castiel knew it to be a command saying that Dean was done with the touchy-feely emotions. The two Alphas nodded and with a final touch a piece disappeared down the hall leaving Ash, Dean and Castiel alone.
"Here." The man held out his hand and Dean stared at the offered appendage. "I don't bite Cher..unless you're into that."
Castiel took a deep breath to calm himself before turning back to Dean, the warmth on his cheeks heating back up as Dean stared at him with one eyebrow raised skeptically.
Dean's eyes dropped away from his face to linger on the towel again, his teeth raking over his full lower lip. Transfixed by the motion Castiel felt his tongue flick out to wet his own lips and he forced his gaze away to the bed as he fought to keep his voice even.
"It was like...the moment he stepped out onto the porch, looking all sleep rumpled something just shifted and he was buried under my skin, something awakening and clawing at me."
Before Castiel could think of a reply Michael spun on his heel and slipping into his SUV in a matter of moments, the sound of the tires on gravel heralding his departure moments later. He stood staring at the place his brother had been for long moments, the entire conversation replaying over and over in his mind, his jaw clenched tightly shut. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths to try and calm himself before headed back into the house. Stepping back inside helped soothe his ruffled feathers, the scent of home and mate and pups wrapping around him and reminding him that Dean was his mate, and that they loved each other.
The reply was quick and without inflection and it brought a rumbling growl from the center of Castiel's chest. Something was going on and his Alpha didn't like it. Reaching out Castiel gripped the point of Dean's chin, turning his face so that they were looking at one another.
"No, no, no. I'm ready..lets go get this all taken care of so we can go on about our days." Gabriel huffed as he pulled away from Sam slightly, ghosting another kiss over his lips before separating from him completely. "Grab your keys Deano and lets go. The sooner we get this done the sooner you can put on that spiffy Sheriff's uniform and cause all the women and a few of the men to flood the street in drool."
Green eyes tore his gaze away and looked up at the other man, a lopsided grin on his lips as he slowly pushed himself up, dusting off his pants before holding a hand out to help him up.
The being barely got the words out before a blinding pain ripped through Dean's mind and he screamed as he dropped to his knees, his hands pressing against his temples to stop it. Across from him the being was talking, but the light drown it all out and he only realized too late that the blinding light was coming from him and not the being in front of him. It felt like his back was being skinned, the pain so raw and all consuming as pressure bore down on him, pressing him face first into the dirty flooring.
"That's enough!" Dean bellowed, his wings snapping out and arching high. "This is my house and I will not have you speaking to my family this way!"
Fingers dug into his scalp and yanked backwards, dragging his line of vision upwards as it strained his neck. He swallowed away the soft whine of pain, his eyes now looking everywhere but at the pallid face of Alastair.
"Deputy Tall Drink? That cuddliest Alpha to ever Alpha?" Meg questioned, a smirk now playing on her lips as she looked over the bruise.
He found his hand gripped and yanked to the side before the heel of his targets other hand was slammed into his back to hold him to the ground.
"So tell us Rowena, why are you here? Why couldn't this wait until Dean and I were...less engaged. What was so important that you broke in our house.."
"Thanks. Anyway it was getting down to the last acts of the show. And one of the cowboys.." the sound of someone talking caught his attention  "..right...right..so his glove got caught in the rope and when he went to dismount he got drug and dislocated his shoulder. He was able to get himself free but then the bull turned on him and stabbed....I mean gored.." Her voice got lower and figured she was speaking to whoever was in the ambulance with her. "I don't work with cows you ass. Anyway Clarence, the bull stabbed him in the thigh but he's losing a lot of blood and the EMTS they had on stand by couldn't stop it. We're about ten out."
Dropping his brief case to the floor by the door Dean moved over towards the bed, the red ring around his eyes the only indication that the Heat scent was affecting him.  Suddenly impatient with how slow his mate was moving in regards of removing his clothing--honestly how dare Dean still be that dressed--he lunged, his hands yanking fabric aside until he could touch skin. With a happy purr he shoved his face against Dean's scent gland, mouthing at it as he wiggled around until he was straddling his mate. Dean hummed softly as his hands gently rubbed up and down his spine and he felt some of the fire beneath his skin subside.
From across the room she seen Jody wave her over and she smiled as she joined the group and was introduced to Charlie and Stevie. As the conversation flowed around her, she sipped on the drink that she'd somehow acquired and smiled. Perhaps Ladies Night would become a regular occurrence for her after all.
"Really Meg? The Rodeo?" He scrunched his nose though the stray thought of his Cowboy calendar breezed through the back of his mind. It'd been a gift from his brother Gabriel and he didn't have a thing exactly for the esthetic, but he could appreciate a well toned man in leather and little else.
Dean's threat died away into a loud, filthy moan as he speared his tongue into the slick soaked channel repeatedly and eased a finger in along side it. He felt Dean's thighs press against the sides of his head and he purred as he added a second finger despite Dean's slick making the need to stretch Dean open almost obsolete. He could feel the warm liquid sliding down his chin and throat and it brought a primal sort of satisfaction to Castiel, as if Dean were marking him for all the world to know.
Gabriel bounded up the stairs and pulled the other man into a hug, rubbing his face against Dean's throat before pulling away. From his vantage point on the ground Castiel watched the intimate display, his eyes narrowed and his head cocked to the side. Dean didn't look at all like the blurred man in the photos on his brother's social media account, but then he had been gone a while and he wasn’t sure if Dean had ever grown his hair out.  He listened to the two talk quietly back and forth before he got up and and moved over to the stairs himself; leaning on the railing and looking at them.
The older hunter looked up from the old book that he'd been looking at; Castiel was pretty sure that Sam had roped Dean into research; and Castiel's lips twitched into a slight grin as he took a seat next to Dean. Without saying anything he handed the box to Dean, watching the confusion filter over the other man's face.
"No more a drunk than you. At least he cared if Sam and I lived or died." Dean's teeth were bared as the pain grew another few decibels more intense before the sound of ripping cloth filled the air.
"Yeah, Charlie and I..." It was Dean's turn to flush hotly but after a moment he started talking again. "We LARP...Live Action Role Play. Charlie is the Queen and I am her faithful Handmaiden, though I am more of a..bodyguard since she is a Warrior type of Queen. We named the facility after our game actually."
"Sammy don't be a prude....Alfie pup pick anything here you want. This is your car, there isn't much I can't fix up. And what I can't we'll find someone that can."
"I guess you're right. I just don't see the point in paying so much for an article of clothing that you're only going to wear one time."
"Please forgive my tardiness. My alarm must have been silenced." He grinned as he closed in on the group.
"Well..I guess..some part of me knew he wasn't a serious threat. Yes he smelled like you from being in your bed but he didn't
One of the things that Castiel loved the most about his boyfriend was the sweet doe-eyes he'd get when Castiel came home with a new tattoo or piercing. He stood staring at the two silver hoops through his nipples and smiled as he pictured Dean's reactions to them. He and Dean had been a couple since the 10th grade when a game of spin the bottle at Benny LaFitte's birthday caused them to out each other to one another.  Back then he'd been the picture of a small town pastors son; collared white shirts, navy or black slacks and he added a trenchcoat when the weather got cold. The smile that had been on his lips faltered as the memory of junior year resurfaced.
Sam recited the information as if he were reading directly from a book and honestly Castiel wasn’t surprised that Sam had answered, research was something he’d always enjoyed and was what made him a stand up lawyer. Add to the fact that none of them had any knowledge of what being a Pure Line meant other than it was something that used to mean something, Castiel wouldn't be surprised if Sam had found enough information in his digging that he could write a book or three about it. Castiel noted in passing the feeling that they were all back in school with the way Rowena was going over the information and asking their input on what they knew so that she could pick the best place to start in expanding their knowledge.
Castiel watched silently as Sam reached out and gently rubbed his wrist over Gabriel's', scent marking him stealthily before moving back and sticking his hands in his pockets.
"I'm sure he won't hate you Dean. Will he be wary? Of course. Will he be a little standoffish? Well he's a Winchester so probably. But I don't think he'll hate you."
And so he told the story of creation as seen through his eyes from stardust that started it all to the grave dust that awaited the world at the end.
Castiel felt his face heat up, the warmth crawling up his neck and settling in the tips of his ears. He was trying to figure out something, anything to say to his brother but was drawing complete blanks. While he was thinking Gabriel took advantage of the silence, a smirk on his lips.
Castiel blinked as he looked over his shoulder at Henry, the older man's words circling his mind until certain ones stood out to him.
Unable to speak Dean just nodded his head, his gaze now trained on his hands as shame welled up and extinguished the glow in his chest. Self loathing was the next emotion to roll in; reminding him that he wasn't the man that his father raised. That if he was he wouldn't be seated in a room talking over this freak stuff with another man.
"You talking my brother into joining us?" Sam asked as he pushed away from the car he'd been leaning against.
Dean arched an eyebrow as if he couldn't smell the left over mixture of strong emotions. Samandriel ducked his head, his face red to the tips of his ears and mumbled softly. With a soft sigh he carded his fingers through the soft hair even as he leaned into the young boy lightly.
"Castiel! They know what you look like, and if it's Alastair then he's going to know everything about you that he can. Sending in your damned double mint twin is only going to get him hurt...or worse."
Sam and Jimmy were leaning against the wall with matching scowls and crossed arms, Gabriel was growling lowly at Dean and Michael and Rowena were suspiciously absent.
“And you couldn’t ask them over the phone?” Samandriel arched his eyebrow and for a moment Castiel wondered if the boy had picked up the habit from himself or Sam.
"Hmm? Of course." He focused his gaze on Dean, watching the brunette scoff. "I was merely wondering if I wanted to fuck your mouth first tonight after we're done for the day or eat you out until you're begging me to fuck you." He hid his grin behind the rim of his cup as Dean sputtered; his face a bright red as he spilt coffee on his shirt.
His eyes drifted over to Dean as Sam and Gabriel exchanged a chaste kiss for the moment, his eyes taking in and appreciating the form fitting cut of his suit. Sure he'd seen it on Dean two days ago at the final fitting but standing in the sun, a smile on his lips and his green eyes sparklin made Castiel's stomach flip end over end. His inner Alpha puffed out his chest when he caught Dean glancing at him from the corner of his eyes. He arched an eyebrow watching as a blush crawled  up Dean's cheeks a smile quirking the corner of his lips.
A quick look to the driveway let him know they couldn't be too far, the Impala was still parked in her spot and a flick of his gaze told him that the keys still hung from the hook by the door.
Sated grin on his face Jimmy hooked his chin over Dean's shoulder and offered Castiel his hand, watching with slightly narrowed eyes as he took his time cleaning to proffered appendage. A soft groan pulled his gaze away from Jimmy and he focused on how Dean followed his every move, shifting slightly in his lap.
It was Castiel's turn to look over at his niece, his eyes narrowed as she shifted from foot to foot and her eyes trained on the ground.
Tapping his fingers on the steering wheel he thought over the few pictures of his brother and his intended that he had found on his brother's social media. The man appeared to be tall and long haired. The pictures had been blurry so he couldn't make out any facial features, but still there seemed to be something familiar about the man and his brother never put his name in the posts, just called him sickeningly sweet pet names and none of the commenters ever posted his name either. The man must be special however if he managed to talk his brother into mating so he couldn't be all bad.
