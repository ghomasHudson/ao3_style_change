Having sex with John always surprises him. It’s never, ever the same. Each and every time he’s stunned by the sensations that are drawn from him.
Sherlock stood and cleared their plates and loaded the little cart back up, wheeling it through the door to the hallway. When he turned to go back inside and had shut the door, Sherlock found John standing very close to him, nearly toe to toe. His brain went offline for a moment before clicking back on. His heart rate and breathing sped up and he could feel sweat beading at his hairline. “Are you-”
“To Sherlock Holmes, bastard finally lived up to his hype,” Greg toasted, raising his glass and they all followed suit and drank. “Now, I do believe a celebration calls for dancing, yeah?”
that he’s acting silly. He’s the only one who knows about it, he’s the only one who can pass judgment on himself and Sherlock chooses--in this moment--not to.
A few more strands of hair slip through the vees of John’s fingers. “BBC wouldn’t have been able to stop the wind, either.”
Sherlock’s breath halts in his chest as he stares at the open dialogue box. It feels as though his heart is in his throat as he types back.
John’s face is blank for a moment before he steps up, takes Sherlock’s face between his hands and kisses him softly, deeply, and it lasts for ages and ages. John finds himself overheated and shrugs out of his jacket before helping Sherlock push his own off of his shoulders. They stay like that, entwined in the greenhouse as the sun sets over the ocean, kissing.
John’s smile flickered before he caught it and it broke into a grin. “Got back into your room I take it.”
Sherlock turns his hand over so that the tips of his fingers are at John’s wrist and vice-versa, their heartbeats resting under the other’s fingerprints. “As am I.”
The raucous atmosphere was a detriment to his focus, and he trusted his agent to find separate, quieter accommodations away from the athletes. In Turin he’d bunked in a hotel with the journalists and other delegation members, and in Vancouver he’d managed to secure a quaint and rustic rental cabin away from the center of activity. This year’s lodgings were far less lavish, but they were private and quiet nonetheless.
Sherlock stood, his dressing gown flowing off the stool behind him. Taking a hold of John’s biceps, he stepped into his space. Voice dipped low and imploring, he said, “Come with me.”
John looked his fill and then got out of bed with a grumble of displeasure. After a moment, he returned to swat Sherlock’s arse playfully; he bit his lip, stood back and just gazed at Sherlock’s lithe form beneath the sheets. “Just focus. We can deal with this Moriarty business when you’ve completed your run.”
Sherlock imagines John Watson taking him to a fish-and-chips joint, of watching John sucking the grease off of his fingers; he imagines them sharing Mongolian beef, their chopsticks bumping. Sherlock imagines their eyes meeting over wine glasses, by candlelight. He can’t decide which image he likes the best. He can’t decide which situation he most wants to see John Watson
If he were alone as he thinks this, Sherlock would physically bat the tedious idiom away, but he restrains himself. Instead, he dips his head towards the menu and pretends to read as his mind whispers to him again, the unformed deduction vying for his focus.
When Sherlock pulled back, the color was high on John’s cheeks, but he seemed content to just share in Sherlock’s space, not pushing for any further intimacy. There was trust there, in his gaze, a sort of solidified assuredness that Sherlock had seen from very few people in his life. He made up his mind about what he wanted to do instantly.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, turns his head, speaks the response very quietly, over his shoulder. “Nine. At Speedy’s.”
Though Holmes placed first, it was with a meager lead of just .07 seconds. James Moriarty, the leading men’s downhill racer out of Bern is a force to contend with. Also in his fourth Olympics, but with the distinct edge of being younger in years, Moriarty has fired shots at Holmes this past season, commenting on the skier’s age and agility. “I tend not to waste my time thinking about him; he’s nothing to me,” Holmes said following his first place win at Beaver Creek.
Sherlock’s agent had begged him to do the group interview with Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon, though it had taken a lot less cajoling than all parties involved had anticipated. Sherlock found himself agreeing when the email came through, a decision he knew he wouldn’t have so readily made just a few short days ago.
Sherlock blinked again and looked just over Greg’s shoulder to where John was sitting and their gazes caught and held. He gave a half smile and John returned it before jutting his chin in a “go ahead” gesture. Sherlock blushed, dipped his head and made his way across the snow to where the press had been corralled.
“Boring.” He yawned, doing nothing to restrain the noise that emerged from his throat; Mycroft would hate that.
A bright coil, something real and tangible, snaps and John says nothing, manages the tiniest, choked noise, and he comes, wringing himself out. There are three stuttered thrusts before John stops entirely, head drooping into the hollow between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, briefly. When he pulls back, it’s with an exhausted, “Oh, fuck,” and then he’s grasping Sherlock’s prick in his right hand and tugging.
Sherlock nodded as they walked in the opposite direction of the elevators, towards John’s room. “Yes, the course is… was… unexpected.”
John turns on his heel and takes in Sherlock, hopping up and back onto the bed, bouncing with the force of his efforts. “Not bad,” he says, patting the mattress next to his hip. “Good lumbar support.”
; he’d heard that before, but where? Not in casual conversation, no. No, that was something you said to someone on a date, on a
The only reason Sherlock attended the Parade of Nations was his sponsors’ insistence. It made no difference to him whether he was seen as prideful of his country or a team player; why did participating in such a charade deem him worthy or unworthy of a medal? The entire thing was tedious, a complete waste of his time; the athletes were forced to be corralled together for hours before the ceremonies began.
Sherlock stands, blinks at the wall, then at the window and then down at his dog who makes the dog equivalent of a shrug and then returns to nosing a his toy. Sherlock rereads John’s words twice more, finally coming to the very strange conclusion that his not understanding the situation, not understand
The last sound Sherlock hears before he’s tugged into slumber is John’s easy laugh, asserting, “You’re right… I’d never.”
Sherlock doesn’t generally interact with many people in an amiable way, and it’s nice to be able to chat to someone. It makes him feel good. His thumbs go to his mobile once more.
Molly takes that as her cue to shuffle over and present Sherlock with a bright orange biohazard container encased in a thick, clear, plastic bag. “Uhm, I could only manage two, as there were two John Doe bodies for cremation, and they’re not… well, they’re not the freshest but-”
It was drizzling when they left Angelo’s, giggly from the abundance of free wine that had been foisted upon them. “You’re right, that was amazing,” John said warmly, his arm brushing up against Sherlock’s as they walked across the pavement.
John steps in, enjoying the feel of the warm water enveloping his skin, and he maneuvers carefully to sitting and then to reclining.  The bomb hisses and bobs, coming to rest on his thigh, tickling.
When he’s not taking the Tube out to Edgeware Road for appointments, John is learning how to navigate the complex landscape of the modern internet. He’s got email down, but he learns through some information that veteran's affairs sends--that he begrudgingly admits is helpful--that setting up profiles on LinkedIn and Facebook may not just help him in staying connected, but also help him to find work.
The spent a moment smiling at one another before Sherlock pulled his mobile from his pocket and immediately began texting.
Sherlock lingered there against the wall for a long time, doing his best to wrangle his thoughts into some coherency. He unbuttoned his parka and let the cool air whip against his body in an attempt to keep him present and focused; Sherlock struggled to settle his mind enough to be able to lay out the whole of the problem but found he was so rattled that he wasn’t able to get to a place where he could even begin to think about Moriarty objectively.
“Good,” Sherlock said and bounced over onto his stomach, shifting so that his chin was perched in the cup of his palm, lips pulling back to reveal a delighted, dark grin. “I like that you like danger.”
“Like a blind date! How exciting!” Molly says, actually having the audacity to clap her hands together again, in a crowded bar.
“That’s-” Sherlock is interrupted by the chirping of his mobile and manages a slight downturn of his mouth as he extracts it from his pocket. He spends a second or two scanning the screen and then pulls his wallet from his coat and tosses down a one-hundred quid note.
Sherlock sends that off and then leaps up from his bed, abandoning his mobile in favor of tracking down his laptop. He wants to see John5NF’s words larger, wants to be able to visualize their entire record of their volley of messages.
“I…” Sherlock begins, and he can’t stop the tide of words that escape his mouth. “I got him off of a murder charge and—”
The car arrived and they shuffled in; John waited for the door to close before he explained himself. “Because
The annoyed groan he emitted was loud enough that it startled him even as it happened and he pressed his face down into the pillow while swiping the ‘accept call’ bar and bringing the phone as close to his mouth as he was able.
you to,” he growled and then pressed himself back in so they were chest to chest. “I want you to fuck me.”
They write nearly every day until Sherlock gets wrapped up in a nine of a case, winds up catching a murderer just south of Croydon and then sleeps at a hotel there for an entire day before making it back to Baker Street.
SOCHI, Russia - The skiing world was turned on its head Tuesday night when allegations were brought against dynamo Swiss ski and downhill favorite James Moriarty. Implicated in not only a plot to illegally traffic banned skiing wax to other elite athletes, but most importantly, in a murder plot, the thirty-eight year old skier was banned from the competitions and led from Olympic Village by police.
John tips forward, shivering in even further, spreading his hands out across Sherlock’s shoulder blades and taking a deep, shuddering breath. Sherlock wishes he could turn, take John into his arms, bury himself deep, so far down he’d be hopeless to emerge. A ragged sob tears itself up from his throat and Sherlock pants a shocked gasp, taken entirely my surprise by how much he wants to surrender to everything John.
Head flopping back dramatically, Sherlock turns to glance at him, “I told her that you like baths, so she got those for you.”
Grunting, Sherlock lets John have his fill and then struggles over onto his back, unconcerned with the wetness on the bed.
John sits back in his chair, hard, as though he’s been punched. “Fuck,” he says once, and then again. “Fuck.”
Brow scrunched, Sherlock experienced a moment of complete and utter nothingness before his finger swiped the trackpad to click on the link.
“Interview today,” comes a deep, rumbling baritone and John very nearly spills the hot liquid all over himself. “No… first day on the job.”
The thought halts his entire body; it’s as though the blood stops pumping, cells remain inert, no breath, no enzymatic reaction.
The water begins to run cool and he hops out, dries off, opens his wardrobe and begins carefully selecting his outfit for the evening. Everything is properly pressed already, hanging in neat rows organized by color,  so it’s quite easy for Sherlock to pluck out a pair of deep navy slacks and a just-barely powder pink shirt. It’s not as aggressive as he generally dresses, but the jacket does add an extra bit of stylish flair.
Sherlock rubbed his hands over his face and watched as Greg sank down into a chair. “John has convinced me that we need to take this to the IOC, go through the proper channels. If this blows up in our face, we’ll have our bases covered.”
If Sherlock believed in fate, he might believe that fate was playing a cruel joke on him. But he doesn’t believe in fate, or luck, so he just stews at his own ineptitude.
But John was shouting again, screaming at the top of his lungs, thrashing his bound legs and spitting like a rabid animal. Sherlock’s brow furrowed, he glanced up at Moran and knew in that moment that Moran had chosen not to take the supposed out that Sherlock had presented him with.
John returns his attention to the cover:Sherlock in the deerstalker splashed across it. “Still… seven times…” John shrugs, leaves the paper out on the cushion beside him and moves on.
He tried to remain silent and undisturbed while people flitted around him, taking selfies and vocally editing the captions on them. Sherlock leaned up against a cinderblock wall, shades over his eyes, and immersed himself in reading a text about infectious diseases on his phone.
He feels raw and strung out, overstimulated and somehow empty. It’s the come-down after the end of a case, and frankly, he’s shit at handling it. In days of old he would have injected some of his seven percent solution, but he now instead indulges in sickeningly sweet bakery treats. He buys an eclair, a frighteningly large piece of lemon cheesecake, and two dozen assorted cookies, intending to gorge on the lot.
Wasn’t that a turn up. From nostril flare to admittance of attraction in under three seconds, if Sherlock had to quantify it. How positively-
Ignoring him, Sherlock shifted his skis again, thrilled at the ease with which they moved over the tightly packed snow. “These will… suffice,” Sherlock decided, betraying nothing of the immediacy with which he needed to take the skis to the slope. “Let’s take all of this over, I want to try a few runs on these.”
When they’re through with the third training run of the Giant Slalom and Sherlock has ensured he has the next fourteen hours to himself, he texts John–finally–to meet at a restaurant on the edge of the Olympic Village.
“Oh,” Sherlock thinks for a moment. He can’t for the life of him remember why he’d brought John Watson up at all. “Nothing, actually.”
Monday morning dawns windy and crisp and John dresses in his favorite blue checked shirt and irons a pair of slacks on the tiny board that had been in the closet when he took the bedsit. He smooths his hair twice in the mirror and re-checks his email for the third time, confirming again his itinerary for the day.
Still, he gets up and goes about his day, cleans around the flat and accepts the paperwork from the messenger upon its arrival. The rest of his weekend is spent getting his wardrobe in order and going out to fill the gaps; he purchases a jumper and two new pairs of slacks, three ties from “last season’s selections” and two crisp button down shirts. He knows that the dress code is relatively casual, and there will be no one to really see him but Molly, but he wants to put at least a modicum of effort into appearing properly professional.
The righteousness had worn off as soon as he’d reached street level and he’d actually thought about turning around, taking the elevator back down to the basement, and apologizing to John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Bring Molly with you, then. At the moment he’s still at the athletic complex with his… crew. By my estimation he’ll be there another hour or so, depending whether he uses the steam room. I need to know when he leaves, the minute he leaves, no later.”
Sherlock looked smug as he undid the sash with deft fingers, the terrycloth pooling on the floor. He stood before John in just his pants, cotton covering a swelling erection. “Should have figured you’d look like this,” John said, pacing up to Sherlock slowly. “Olympic athlete and all, but
It’s John’s turn to use his elbows as support. He knows how his voice will sound before he even opens his mouth, “Sherlock.” Filled with awe, slightly choked, John can think of nothing else to say.
Sherlock shoved his free hand underneath the pillow and punched the headboard in front of him three times in rapid succession. He didn’t abide Mycroft when he was wide awake, nevermind first thing in the morning; he could only speculate as to what utter nonsense he’d called about. “What do you
By the time their food arrived they’d both tried two of the four vodkas they had been brought to sample. Sherlock felt warm and heavy, delightful really, and he noted the way John had melted back into his seat, legs splaying out just the slightest bit further apart beneath the table.
“Lamp, Greg,” Sherlock called brokenly and Greg snapped to attention, looking from Sherlock to the tabletop lamp which he snatched up with a shaky hand and it brought it down hard on Moran’s head. The lamp didn’t shatter but instead hit skin and bone with a dull thud and then thunked over to the side, the bulb flickering out as it rolled as far as its cord allowed.
“Too bad,” John said and smacked him playfully on the behind. “Now, get in the tub, you utter arse.”
Apprehension and nerves coil in his gut, his massive ego unable to tame them. But Sherlock forges ahead, brings his fingers to the keyboard and begins typing.
Perhaps it was the drink, or the pressure of being around someone he liked so very much. Maybe he still needed time to adjust to the altitude. The higher part of his brain shouted that theory effectively down, leaving only the weaker notion - that he was entranced, in every sense of the word, by John Watson - lingering in the forefront of his mind and he didn’t want to lose him just yet.
John grinned, the color high in his cheeks, and positioned himself so that his knees were on either side of Sherlock’s thighs. In this position they were nearly eye to eye.
“We can stop all this, then?” Sherlock asks, breathless, pathetically pleading. “You can sleep in my bed. You can tell Rosie, properly that I’m-”
Sherlock’s mouth twists as he picks up the to-go cup and pops off the lid, testing the temperature, dumping two sugar packets in and stirring. “Did we?”
“I do know Elena Piscante,” Greg said after a time, crossing his arms over his chest. “She sits on the Executive Board,” Greg fell silent for a moment, head bobbing back and forth as he considered. “I suppose if we knew anyone on the Ethics Commission that would be best but-”
A barking laugh startled out of John and he lost control of his posture, moving in to sling his arms around Sherlock’s hips. “Okay. One box, two?”
Sherlock grunted and attempted to move again, but only succeeded in sliding an inch towards the sofa. Sweat broke out on his brow and his muscles strained against his bonds; he fought the instinct to thrash or to panic and instead sat back in the chair, spine straight.
Molly tears her gaze away, gives a little, uncomfortable laugh and picks at the cardboard cover around her hot coffee cup. “Oh, uhm, don’t be angry, don’t… get upset but your uhm, your blind date or
Sherlock thought for a moment, touched by John’s slight insecurity, feeling warm to the tips of his ears with it. “Oh, I suppose as John Watson.”
“Mmm, I think not,” he murmured, eyes strayed to where other members of his delegation were letting their hair down, imbibing and chatting, smiling and laughing and getting to know one another.
John considers this, that Sherlock doesn’t seem to believe that he’s good-enough for the just-barely-keeping-it-together human that John Watson is. It seems at once absurd and stunningly human of him.
Sherlock stays up very late, talking with John5NF about nothing, really. He asks him medical questions just to test his knowledge, finds out that he likes Bond films and hates chickpeas and Sherlock tells him the history of Redbeard.
They’d been back in London for a month and a half, and Sherlock was just managing to take John out on a proper date.
“Well, it’s more efficient and hospitable than the last, but people won’t stop asking questions. I mean, I think they know I was involved but they don’t know
Sherlock immediately types and sends. It doesn’t shock him that he’s sent it, because it is the absolute truth.
John sat beside Lestrade, rosy cheeked and windswept, scarf wound high around his neck. “Two more serious injuries; who designed this course? Hey Sherlock,” John gave a tip of his chin and Sherlock returned it likewise.
Ski poles at his side, he dipped his body into a starting crouch. There was pressure at his temples, underneath his tongue, as though he should put voice to words he didn’t have. Sherlock had a startling thought in that moment, that he should remember what he was thinking as he was going down the slope. That someone was going to ask him what he’d been thinking just before the race. But he was thinking of nothing and
Belatedly, he went back and read John’s, the mention of the “course medics” reminding him that he’d never actually read the whole of John’s messages.
Sherlock blinks at her, takes in her shoes, her coat, the sweater she’s decided on. “And uhm, I’m sorry but there’s really no one else interesting,” she giggles. “Either dead or alive.”
They fell into a companionable silence, the only sound the hiss and crackle of the fire in the hearth. Content for awhile to simply enjoy being close to one another, Sherlock slipped further over on the couch, his thigh pressing into John’s, and after only a moment’s hesitation, he draped his arm along the back, tucking John into his side.
And it settles, like the very first sip of an exquisite vintage, in the pit of his belly: the knowledge that he’s a man in love. It’s as simple as that.
John tipped his head to the side in concession, but it was a rather long moment before he said, “That, that you are.”
,” Sherlock breathed, pressing his palm against John’s lower back and they made their way inside swiftly, closing the door silently behind them.
Sherlock gets the leash out and Redbeard is at his side, ducking his head so Sherlock can clip it to his collar. Sometimes, Sherlock thinks that his dog may be too smart for his own good, but considering he’s the one who owns the dog...well.
“For us,” John corrects, seriously. He reaches over to squeeze Sherlock’s shoulder once, and holds Sherlock’s elbow as they turn towards a photographer asking for a photo.
“Aren’t you the least bit curious about Hanzu’s death?” Sherlock spat back, a tad viciously. He advanced on Lestrade a step and threw the full force of his gaze down his nose at the man. “Athletes of our caliber don’t die at events like this. It just. Doesn’t.
And so Sherlock does, with John by his side. He notes John’s height and the length of his stride, how he swings his arms alongside him as he walks. John is confident and deft, stepping around passersby with ease. John is compact and strong, and Sherlock surreptitiously appreciates the expediency of John’s gait.
Falling in love with Sherlock Holmes had been so incredibly simple. It was so natural that he was unable to recall just how it happened. He realized that it had been there all along, slowly enveloping him in its glow. How he yearned to touch the skin of Sherlock’s neck above the collar of his pajama top; he wanted to explain how desperately he wanted to know the contents of Sherlock’s heart and to allow his own heart to spill open before Sherlock. The desire to give word and touch to his love was almost painful in strength.
John stops typing and realizes that Guest may actually be in the room with a man he’s speaking about (John hopes) hypothetically killing. Abruptly, he deletes all of the text. He thinks about what Guest said in the chatroom, about the inquiries he’s made and realizes that this is all
Sherlock was shocked to find himself in a better than average mood, so much so that he wasn’t even a complete arse to Molly when she arrived and spilled some of her mojito on him.
“What do you think of him?” Adam questions with no preamble, tipping the phone so that both Gus and Sherlock can see a Grindr profile.
Heat thudded in Sherlock’s veins, the desire rendering his thoughts thick and liquid. Testing his limits, Sherlock slid down as far as he was able, the smooth tip of John’s prick just bumping at his throat and he exhaled, slipping down impossibly further. The resulting gasp from John was worth the slight discomfort, and on the upstroke Sherlock sucked, hard. Pulling off, he kissed the tip lewdly, his mouth forming a plump little heart. It was all for John’s indulgence, the show Sherlock put on.
Greg had been good for Sherlock, breaking down the sport into its components and helping him channel his anger when he didn’t advance as quickly as he liked. Additionally, he didn’t put up with Sherlock’s precocious nature, being just as firm with the boy as he would have been with any adult he was training. Sherlock gained a great respect for him and, after training with him for two years, began to flourish on the youth circuit.
Some of the younger team members tried to lure him into conversation but Sherlock would just smile in that frightening way of his and go back to the chapter on Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. It was madness beneath the stadium, hundreds of young, eager competitors, excited to mingle with other teams and engage in more base behavior. Sherlock hoped once his competitors were swept up in the air of revelry of the games, it would give him even more of an edge.
“Yes, and you’re on your way to St. Bartholomew’s hospital,” he says easily, and John catches him glancing over at him. “A new… technician of some sort.”
The knocks come crisply—three raps and then a long span of quiet. Slumping down further, John makes every effort to ignore the intrusion and relaxes as best he can in the less-than-ideal space available. If he doesn’t move, maybe he’ll be left in peace. There’s a brief respite of silence and then, again, three more raps on the door, in faster succession this time, followed by, “John, it’s been an hour, how can you possibly—”
John falls back against the bed, Sherlock’s head now just within reach. It’s a moment before gentle fingers begin carding through the camera-ready gelled curls, peeling strands apart.
Sherlock gapes; for a moment he feels as though time has stopped entirely. John’s nervous about meeting him. John’s wondering what it would have been like getting coffee with Sherlock. John is interested in both pieces, in both…halves? No, that sounds too trite.
John blushes, making love. Words he never even imagined he’d hear Sherlock speak, nevermind in reference to the two of them. It hits him right upside the head. He can’t help but grin, attempting to take some of the heaviness out of the situation, his voice tinged with salaciousness when he says, “Every?”
After a laugh, John is back to it, holding Sherlock open, teasing him with light pressure. Tongue and then lips, tongue again and then a good suck. He somehow manages to keep Sherlock on edge, varying his pressure and his strokes. When he adds a gentle finger, Sherlock releases a moan so tortured that it sounds like pain.
Sherlock narrows his gaze and feels that prickle again and realizes belatedly that he doesn’t feel at all put out to be at lunch with John rather than procuring body parts from Molly.
There’s a shaky slowness to his movements, intention covered in velvet, without hurry. Sherlock appreciates it, loves having John this close, able to hear every sip and hiccough of breath that comes out of him.
John checks his own spelling and then for good measure uses spellcheck and hits ‘send’. He goes back to his dinner, prepared to wait a bit for Guest to get back to him, but not two minutes later, there is a ‘ding’ and a reply to his sent message.
could find out was that Hanzu’s neck had broken clearly, he didn’t suffer, he was gone instantly. I asked after his gear, got some weird looks for it, but they said his ski team took it away, don’t know if it was looked at or not.”
“Let’s say the upper half,” Mary says, and he can hear her rummaging about in the closet. “Like the bottom half just fine.”
“I didn’t mean it as a compliment,” Sherlock murmured, sitting back so he could impress upon John the graveness of the situation. “I have something to tell you, something to share with you that might be… difficult.”
John responded quietly. “Yeah that, thank you, yeah, I’d just erm, rather not think about it for the moment. I don’t want to think about that right now.”
Independently, it's all so hopelessly dull. All of it. But, he considers John’s tendency to rub at the back of his neck when he’s unsure, the way he holds a fork and knife, his smile, the way he walks, swinging his arms to and fro, purposeful. It’s
“Naw, but I thought I’d wish you luck; ‘sides, the air’s better up here, innit?” He reached out to tap Molly on the shoulder and then spun back to face Sherlock, snickering to himself silently; she came up behind him and thwacked him right in the center of his back, hard.
“John,” Sherlock said, throat thick with the sudden onslaught of emotion, his head resting in his upturned palm.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathes again, more urgently, and that sets him off. The force of it startles him, and his hips buck twice and he’s coming, warmth spreading across Sherlock’s wrist and hand, John’s own stomach. White light fizzles behind his closed eyelids and he bears down, grits his teeth as the orgasm takes his body, thrashing it.
Sherlock, rather than being taken aback by that, considers. He is odd, that’s true enough. What good would denying that do? And yet, John remains sitting across from him, smiling, apparently waiting for a response. The fact that he’s odd isn’t putting John off at all, it appears.
Sherlock reciprocated in kind, backing off to take teasing nips at John’s lips and chin before delving back in, slicking their tongues together. Tilting his mouth downward, warm breath puffing against John’s mouth, he said slyly, “It’s getting late.”
Sherlock managed a long workout, settling into his routine easily, allowing his mind to run over and over the turns in the course as he churned out leg press after leg press. It felt wonderful to sweat out his frustrations of the previous day, getting five miles in on the treadmill before he realized how far he’d run. He opted to run two more as he wasn’t fatigued and his legs felt strong; he’d gotten so much sleep the night before that he knew he’d have some extra energy to burn after an entire evening sitting at the opening ceremonies - the extra distance would do him good.
Buoyed by that thought, he didn’t put up much of a fight when Molly threaded her arm through Sherlock’s and tugged on him until he followed along beside her.
John chuckled, but didn’t recoil. Sherlock hated him for it, hated him for pressing, for not just giving in and brushing Sherlock off as a lost cause. He hated that he didn’t particularly wish to be left alone by him, that he inexplicably wanted John to know every last thing about him.
“Right, nevermind. So… you’re here for a case?” Lestrade tries again. “That I don’t have. Because as I’ve said, I call you when I do.”
John smiles to himself, eyes slipping close, pleased with being able to wake up with Sherlock in the room, no matter how. “You’re just pissed you’re not competing, old man.”
There are few details that are being released to the press; as it stands, security has been increased dramatically in the wake of these events, both at Olympic Village and at Rosa Khutor.
Sherlock didn’t turn back towards his group, but he did allow his face to relax and his eyes to slip closed as the weight of the praise seeped in. Eventually he tipped so that his left temple rested against the cool glass of the cabin and he didn’t open his eyes until the tram reached the terminal destination.
Sherlock stared at John for a long beat and then took a single step forward. “Stay tonight. Please just… sleep here. With me.”
John went straight-backed and conspicuously silent while Greg leaned back on his stool and grinned. “You two shared a room… and John’s still alive…”
“Yes. Thankfully, obviously. Just… play nice. And maybe smile. For the cameras, the ladies love your smile.”
Sherlock will read John5NF’s response in the morning, perhaps before he makes his way down to Bart’s to try and clear the air with the morgue technician. After all, if John Watson is sticking around--unlike the several technicians before him--it would do Sherlock well to stay on his good side.
John goggles from Molly to the doors, wondering what he could possibly need with tongues. He feels the anger bubbling in his gut and mutters under his breath, “That man must be mad.” He takes up his own chart once more and whispers, in addendum, “And John Watson isn’t a fucking boring name, knobhead.”
It’s almost impossible to speak through the laughter that overtakes him suddenly, “Stop! Stop, you… maniac! If you don’t stop moving, I can’t get you naked!”
But Sherlock knew otherwise, and that simple bit of knowledge bolstered him. He licked his lips and addressed the interviewer, addressed his audience. “Do I think my approach is better than others’, Candace? Yes, I do. Thanks,” and with that, he ducked away from the camera and back towards the athlete’s area.
Sherlock blinks, gives a half nod, takes a step back on the pavement and looks up at the awning. He finds, suddenly, that he cannot possibly move forward. Molly too takes a step back, glances at him, at the awning and gives him a pitying little half smile.
For now he allows it all to settle, allows himself to feel the myriad of emotions that are twisting inside of him. He allows the melancholy to settle and transform into something like acceptance in the pit of his stomach, and presses his body back into the protective curl of John’s.
If Sherlock had to choose one benefit that came with being a professional athlete that he was very glad for having access to, regular therapeutic massages were it. Normally he didn’t like to be touched, and sometimes it still took a good while for him to relax under a professional’s ministrations, but once he did, his mind quieted and he found true solace, if only for a brief time.
A feeling of awkwardness overcomes him. Sherlock has seen him naked before. Sherlock has seen him in situations that are far worse than seeing him naked, but now, after seeing Sherlock’s eyes, the guilt there… John feels different. John feels that taking off his clothes is different now than it would have been before. Sherlock’s seen his skin, the whole of it, probably, but now it’s… more.
“Yes, I was out early.” He didn’t bother informing her that he had in fact spent the night in another man’s room, in another man’s bed. He didn’t mention that the man wouldn’t stop niggling at his mind, picking at his resolve.
He pushes his way through the pedestrian cross traffic and through the door. It’s a moment before John sees him, but when he does, he raises a hand. Is it Sherlock’s imagination or does John make to get up and greet him, as he might a date?
“How will you learn,” John sauntered into the living room, following Sherlock, “if I always do it for you?”
One side of Sherlock’s mouth curled up in an amused and pleased smile. “And you invaded Afghanistan.”
“Nice work,” John intoned, pulling up at his side, straightening the media lanyard around his neck. “Maybe could have chosen a better word to tell someone to fuck off than ‘bugger,’ but nice, all same.”
He shakes his head, leans in, close to Sherlock’s face, and meets his eyes. “Could just… stare at this all day.”
Sherlock shakes his head, once, massaging out his temples. The tumble into memory and subsequent personal discovery has left him feeling tired, but simultaneously reinvigorated. If he’d known he needed a more firm grasp of his contentment, he’s have tidied his mind palace long ago.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock says and takes a step towards him. John’s eyes drop, lingering on the swath of skin that Sherlock’s left revealed at his neck, and in the next moment, John’s eyes sweep his whole body. Ah, not entirely uninterested, then. Or, John can perhaps appreciate the male form. When their eyes meet again, John’s cheeks have gone the tiniest bit pink, his mouth slipping open a fraction.
John looked at him like he thought he was just the slightest bit mad, shrugged, and took a pull from his fresh beer. “Right, so.” John slipped up onto one of the stools and Greg followed suit, leaving Sherlock clutching his drink and standing there awkwardly. Under their scrutiny, he shifted up onto a stool himself, sipping primly from his drink.
“Alright,” comes gently, and then, “But back to what I was asking about before, the sex was good, right?” John ribs and Sherlock laughs, guffaws, gathers John up and holds on, and the demons that they might have once held at bay are all but forgotten. There is perfection, right in this moment.
“Athletes being snarky with one another is hardly evidence to go on,” Sherlock frowned. “Though I think we’re all in agreement that he’s behind all of this…”
Sherlock’s gaze remains fixed there, on the bit of flesh where the left side of John’s jaw meets his neck.
“Oh yes, yes,” he said and tumbled forward a bit, his hand slipping on the knob before he stepped out into the living room. The sun had shifted behind the clouds and the room was cast in eerie shadow. Sherlock took one more look around before turning back and ensuring that the contents of the cupboard was just as they’d found it.
John smiled at Sherlock, and Sherlock gave a half-smile back, and they fell into silence, Sherlock picking at lint on his trousers and John just watching him for a spell. “Right,” John cut in when they were minutes from their destination. “I’ve got a few hours off shift before I come back for the night runs; let’s get lunch.”
Lestrade huffed a laugh as he took a small bit of the wax between his fingers. “Even if they did, they’re not going to let you faff about in there. Probably need a Russian passport to get into any facility like that in this country way things are at present.”
He distantly noticed that the buzzing in his head had quieted, but now he was too busy fending off the siren call of slumber to think properly about the issues at hand. But he couldn’t ask for John to stop; he was making Sherlock feel absolutely at ease. He had moved onto Sherlock’s hands and wrists when he quietly murmured, “Let’s bring Greg in on this.”
. Strange, that this slightly supersedes the need he has to solve this case. That’s ever-present, but just the idea of John, constantly making itself known alongside these alluring suicides begs Sherlock’s attention.
Sherlock was momentarily stunned by the response and belatedly stunned that he’d bothered to engage his rowmate in conversation to begin with. He opened his mouth at once to speak but couldn’t think of a single thing to say so he shut it and angled himself back into position against the wall.
He was all smiles, the color high on his cheeks, and he was wearing a tight, forest green tee-shirt that Sherlock found very distracting. Until now he’d seen John in his delegation gear, his comfortable but atrocious-looking jumpers and worn jeans. Now, the jeans he wore were tighter and hugged his arse in all of the right ways. “Looks like everyone turned up!” he said, covertly squeezing Sherlock’s side as he rounded him. “Good crowd.”
Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice, instead glancing back at his notebook and carrying on. “I am quite talented, I have to say, but alas no, I cannot deduce proper names. Not for lack of trying, I assure you. Where the
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m fine.” He hopped down off the stretcher with a feigned energy that he didn’t feel and a stab of pain radiated up from the center of his right foot. “Well, relatively fine.”
There’s a grumble as Sherlock turns on his side, snuggling in to John’s sleep-warm stomach. “I should’ve have signed with the BBC.”
Redbeard gives a little ruff of acknowledgment before walking to the stand by the door and snatching at his leash with his teeth. “Alright, yes, yes,” Sherlock says, pats the dog on the head, goes to turn the kettle back off and gets Redbeard settled for a walk. They walk the deserted streets of London until Sherlock happens upon a pizza restaurant that's open and stops in for a slice.
Sherlock sank back into the sofa, hands on his thighs. A million thoughts buzzed through his mind, the most insistent of which was that he and John shared the same suspicion. “I was about to tell you the same.”
“Oh.” And it’s apparent that he’s made his point rather plain; Sherlock doesn’t date. He needs John to know that.
Sherlock twists, grunts and some of the bravado visibly drains from him, “Don’t want you… thinking yourself out of this.”
John’s eyes were a bit red and his gait sloppy; Sherlock ignored the niggling voice in his mind asking when he’d categorized John’s gait and
“Your phone, it’s a hand-me-down. Harry Watson, from Clara, on that back there. Your brother is an alcoholic; every night he goes to plug it in to charge, but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them. Not top-of-the line but you kept it, which means you’re not doing well financially which is, I didn’t mean—”
If he’d only told John about Guest sooner. Hindsight after all is quite clear, and harping on decisions on the past will do him no good, but he can’t help but think…
It sounds oddly formal, leaving his lips, but Sherlock lets it settle, as though this was the very first time for the both of them.
It takes him the better part of two days to get his LinkedIn profile to his liking, and he has to stop several times after becoming frustrated with his own slow progress. He figures out how to use his laptop’s camera in order to take a serviceable photo of himself, though that too takes ages. When he’s through, he browses the profiles of the people who are suggested to him; John is surprised to find many people from his own unit already on the website. He’s more surprised when he starts coming across the names of people he went not just to medical school with, but primary school. John hesitates, not wanting to reach out anyone just yet.
John feels like he’s been punched straight in the gut; he’s so stunned that he can’t even morph his face to feel as outraged as he is. Instead he stands there stock still and watches as Sherlock leaves, punching his way through the swinging doors.
Sherlock fell in step with the rest of the athletes leaving the stadium and intended on going back to his room for perhaps then out for a jog before bed. The thought of languishing in his room didn’t much appeal to him and since he needed an outlet for the energy thrumming through him, he followed the throng of people off of the Olympic campus and down a road towards where the district of nightlife establishments began.
John pressed him back into the wall, confident but gentle as their tongues slicked together and retreated. It was a slow kiss, something that stretched the bounds of time, all warm and sweet and deep. Sherlock sucked in a breath through his nose and gave in totally as John moved his mouth from lips to jaw to neck and back up again.
His team gathered his gear and made their way over to the general practice area for the downhill, a course that looked even from above to be vastly less complex than the Olympic course. Sherlock was both glad and disappointed by this. His mind and body craved the adrenaline rush, and a day without, anticipating the run, left him feeling parched and unsatisfied. Sherlock knew he wouldn’t feel quite totally whole until he’d gotten down that hill at least once.
This isn’t the first time they’ve kissed and it’s not the fiftieth; this won’t even be the first time that John has peeled Sherlock out of his trousers and put his mouth on his prick. But this is the first time–carefully choreographed around landladies being absent and Rosie being away–they’ll make love, and in a proper bed.
Writing with John has brought him so remarkably out of his comfort zone while simultaneously making him… happy.
He’d heard that this course was going to be brutal and now, after one run on it, he knew it to be fact.
John’s tongue makes a path down his neck, teeth finding a trapezius and sinking in, just until he feels real resistance. Fingers find John’s hips and tug, fumble, press in between their bodies and Sherlock manages to fiddle the buttons of John’s flies open.
Sherlock wrings his hands as his brain runs into overdrive and then he breaks out into a delighted grin in the backseat of the taxi. He’s still high on endorphins, his body singing with the excitement of a new,
“Yes, thank you very much,” Sherlock said graciously and at a peal of John’s giddy laughter, leaned his head against the cool window with a groan.
Sherlock was fifth on the docket, and he remained calm and still while he watched the athletes prior to him explode through the starting gate and disappear from view. Members of his team wished him well, but they were all white noise to him, the only sound cutting through was the intercom announcing he was on deck.
It’s an oddly specific question and oddly formal. John’s eyebrow perks as he reads it, but still, he does the math in his head, and aside from extenuating circumstances, comes up with a ballpark answer. He doesn’t give it, however, feeling something vaguely off about the question.
. As he suspected, there was no real discernible difference between the sample he’d taken from Moriarty’s rooms and the other waxes he had on hand. If only he had access to a lab, then he might be able to make some actual progress.
“My room then, I’ll… room service, if that will suit? Say, eight?” His heart thudded hard in his chest, he swore it rattled his ribcage as he waited for John’s response.
He feels himself flush hot and then cold and then, out of sheer disbelief, he glances around the flat to ensure that yes, he did indeed forget his cane back in Brixton. What in the world...
John’s teeth grind; he imagines he’ll be doing much of that in the future if he’s around Sherlock Holmes. “She’s a kind woman, and it’s obvious you’re stringing her along. It’s cruel.”
his mind helpfully supplies) the other evening, but Sherlock is still a bit of an arse. And what’s more, he doesn’t want Guest to be scared off if he arrives to find John with someone else.
he knew what to say. For a while he gazes at Redbeard, who is seated by the fire, gnawing contentedly at a beat up chew toy. He envies the dog, never having to suss out situations such as these. And even this, such a simple thing, seems to be completely beyond Sherlock. His thumbs tap aimlessly at the sides of his mobile for a bit before he sighs, and hits ‘Reply.’
John grimaced and shrugged, sitting himself down in a leather desk chair. Lestrade rolled his eyes again and then tossed himself down onto a sofa, turning his hands up in surrender. “Well I’m in it now, aren’t I? Christ you two… I… Sherlock why can’t you just be happy with making it to the – no, no, nevermind. I’m not your coach and you’re not my athlete. I’m not doing it. I’m not talking you into or out of anything. Just, fuck… fill me in on everything you know.”
He’d seen dreams like those of the people before him deflate, and he lost himself for a few minutes in attempting to predict how poorly each of the athletes were likely to do.
“Three, perhaps for the entire month. Staging. Prep. Press. All that’s. Perhaps… put in a few runs on the eastern slope. Reserved. For training. It’s supposed to be magnificent powder.”
“Well,” Molly says. “Don’t be nervous. It’s a nice feeling though too, isn’t it?” She watches Sherlock until he nods. “I know it’s, it’s… pointless to say that but you’re dapper and lovely and while you leave an awful lot to be desired in the…
For a moment, Greg stood there, stunned, and then shrugged his shoulders. “Sure. Anytime. You know that.”
“Impatient with reason, John!” Sherlock says, his tone low and forceful, but also with an edge of play. “Ten…
When asked what Moriarty thought of his narrow second-place finish, Moriarty said, “Well, it just proves I can beat him. I will beat him. This is just practice, just child’s play. Wait until the medal race and I promise you’ll be dazzled.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he hesitated, glanced down at John’s hand, then back up at his eyes. “Sherlock Holmes.” He fit his palm against the other man’s and was greeted with a strong grip and sure shake. Sherlock inspected John’s wrist and arm, the forearm was clearly well-muscled but hidden beneath dark gray wool. His hand was tan below the wrist, weathered and cracked; interesting.
Sherlock takes his time there as well, producing his pocket magnifier to get a better idea of the head wound. He gets a slap to the arm when he tries to insert his index finger into the wound (even though he knows better) and spends a bit examining the hips and pelvis. He surreptitiously sneaks a few photos before he pockets his mobile and takes a small step back.
John chimes in on one or two subjects and then simply sits back and watches the various conversations play out. It’s not boring, but he doesn’t feel very engaged either. He’s finishing up his apple and preparing to click out of the window when guest_47995 asks, “How long would it take for a 200 pound, six foot athletic male to expire from a wound sustained to the femoral artery?”
His team was excited but serious when he arrived at the top of the mountain. Molly was busy preparing his accessories while Phillip toiled over the tail end of his skis, twisting them this way and that to gauge how thick the wax was. When they finally noticed that Sherlock had arrived, neither of them said a word, but each bowed their heads in greeting and returned back to their tasks.
John copies the email address and goes back to his email, pasting the address into a new, blank message. He pauses, rethinks his strategy and creates a new account. Going by h.john.watson is much too obvious; he certainly doesn’t want this stranger to know his actual name. Not that his ego is large enough to believe that he is the
They were in hospital for what seemed like eons. The competence of the doctors on staff was certainly much higher than what they would encounter if the world’s elite athletes had not overrun the city, but Sherlock was miffed at the quality of treatment all the same. Since he was the athlete, the doctors swarmed over him first upon their arrival at the A&E, but he was very adamant in his demands that John be treated first.
over one of the very few things he found happiness in was strange, wasn’t it? “I…” he began, thinking on it a moment longer. “I am. I’m having fun.”
Running his fingers gently beneath his eyes, his thoughts wandered to John and how he was faring today - if he was feeling as awful as Sherlock was, if he’d slept, taken his painkillers, told anyone about what had happened to them. Sherlock’s mobile was in the bedroom but he resolved to take a long, scalding shower before calling. He was greasy and gritty with dried blood and his skin felt as though it’d shrunk as he slept.
“Mmmkay,” John says, bringing their mouths back together. He loses some of his finesse, his kisses turning sloppy as Sherlock curves his finger inside, massages. “Oh, fuck… yes,” John’s forehead falls to Sherlock’s sternum as he rocks back into the pressure. “Should be… doing that to you,” he manages, smearing a kiss across Sherlock’s right pectoral.
Their perusal of the case reveals nothing solid or illuminating, but does serve to update them on the nuances and circumstances related to the first death. Sherlock has pages of scribbled notes and John makes photocopies of several items of interest. When they leave the constabulary, it’s rapidly approaching dusk and a chilly wind has kicked up, doing nothing to deter the throngs of people wandering the town.
It’s a crazy thought, he knows it is. But then, maybe he’s going a little bit crazy. Maybe he’s just perpetually
“That’s shocking to discover,” John returns, with a scathing little laugh. “And since you’re not my friend, you probably shouldn’t be sitting with me, so.”
, he wonders?) there’s nothing to be done. He shouldn’t feel upset for being excited to see Sherlock again because Sherlock, at the very least, has shown up. John feels for a moment how entirely underwhelming that fact is, how depressing that showing up is the bar he’s set for himself.
“Whatever you’ve on is fine. S’a king bed, I don’t mind.” The voice was thick with sleep but sounded sure enough, and with that, Sherlock returned to the bathroom and donned his pants and moved through the dark room to slip into the vacant side of the bed.
Sitting back, Sherlock made to wipe at the mess with the back of his hand, but John was darting up, breath heaving as he leaned in to lick over Sherlock’s face with an enthusiastic  tongue, spreading the slippery release around on his skin before lapping it up. Sherlock’s cock gave a twitch at both the sensation and the knowledge that he was cleaning his come off of Sherlock’s face. “Fuck,” John breathed, hot against his cheek.
He shimmed onto his side, toeing off his trainers in the process, and slung an arm up underneath his pillow. It took a while for his eyes to adjust to the room but when they did, he made out the odd outline of an object on the table by the bathroom; it wasn’t there before he’d gone, he was sure of it. So preoccupied with clinging to his fantastic mood, he hadn’t noticed it upon entering, an oversight that hadn’t happened to Sherlock in years. He noticed
John shakes his empty hands at his sides, bringing himself back under control. “Just because I want to get you naked doesn’t mean that I want us to just... “
Sherlock knows that he likely won’t find anything in the minutia, but he’d needed a reason to see John. Needed a reason to bring John along, immerse him in the case, capitalize on his obvious adrenaline addiction.
a date,” John returns, dragging a hand over his face. “Meeting a friend. None of your business, actually.”
John licked his lips, raised a brow and glanced back at Sherlock, who dipped his head as he grinned. They both got up out of the booth and headed towards Greg and Molly on the shadowy dance floor.
The thought of lying to John turns his stomach, makes him feel–somehow–even more wretched. John is… John Watson, the amalgamation of his online persona and his real self, is a wonderful accident of a human being. He’s perhaps the least boring person that Sherlock Holmes has met and Sherlock in his infinite wisdom realizes that… he can’t lose this. He can’t lose this thing that is budding between them. The only person he’s truly engaged with since… Sherlock can’t remember when; the only person that Sherlock looks forward to speaking with.
If this had happened years ago, back before they’d become so completely entwined, John might have been fine with the idea that they race towards mutual orgasm, just to know. But there’s a need he has to allow Sherlock to understand and experience how deeply John cares for him.
was able to communicate his pride and happiness; Sherlock felt something delicate burst open inside of him and as a result, he gripped Lestrade harder to his chest.
John glances up and down the street, oddly buoyed by the message. To go to the veterinarian would imply that Guest owns an animal of some kind. The image of a solitary man or woman seated on a sofa with a cat in their lap comes to mind and John smiles at the image of it. He can’t help that he’s intrigued by Guest; Guest is so strange and yet seems intelligent--if a bit strange--and self-possessed. It couldn’t hurt to learn a bit more, and sending these emails actually helps John feel more connected to the world, in a strange way.
The last bit garnered a round of chuckles from those surrounding him. “But I know I haven’t made it easy for you over the years and I… very much appreciate every bit of your work, your attention to detail, your loyalty and your professionalism. I would say--though I may be biased--that I have been privileged to work with the best team in all of downhill racing, and I thank you.”
“Oh, piss off,” John says, gives Sherlock a faux-severe look and laughs, and it feels so natural, so nice and easy to be talking with Sherlock like this, that he nearly forgets that they’d been shouting at one another just a few days ago. “Yes you have.”
John chuckled and continued to glance around, touching things here and there until he turned towards the fireplace. Sherlock watched as his eyes settled on the mantle. “You put your medal in a shadowbox? How
Their joined digits swing along between them, before Sherlock relaxes and leaves John’s hand to flutter happily back to his side.
Sherlock searched John’s eyes, his face, before he brought a hand up to skim the backs of his fingertips over a cheek. “I am, yes. I very much am.” When his hand fell to his lap John tipped forward, their lips brushing intimately, slowly.
Sherlock shrugged him off, uncomfortable with the camaraderie, and barked at Phillip to bring his skis over. He was on deck for the event, and his people immediately surrounded him, fastening and refastening his boots and getting him into his skis. His helmet came down snugly over his head, the sounds of the hut nothing but muffled white noise.
He thinks for a time, a new mail window open and worries over what to say. Sentiment, never his strong suit.
Tugging on his gloves, Sherlock threaded his hands through his poles and Molly took a step back. A hush fell over the area as he shifted to the gate and set himself in a starting crouch.
“Right, right,” Sherlock swallowed even as his mouth went dry. “Right.” Gaze darting around the room, he looked for somewhere they could hide and spotted a door in an alcove to the right of entertainment system. He was annoyed with himself for not spotting it as soon as they’d gotten inside but was grateful he’d noticed it now. “There, across the room.”
He doesn’t know what to do with everything he feels, the overwhelming weight of it all. It’s a brilliant conundrum, where to put hands and mouth, how to move to make Sherlock feel good, feel the very best he’s ever felt, because he deserves that.
There’s a bag on the sink, not very large but not very small, either, emblazoned with the word “Lush”. John takes a cursory glance around him and then steps inside the room, uses one finger to pull the bag open enough to peek in. He’s met with nothing but a puff of crêpe paper. John takes a step back and then leans back in, dipping at the waist to bring his nose to the bag’s height. Primly, he sniffs, noting that the muted floral and citrus aroma seems to be coming from the bag itself.
Sherlock sighs and pulls himself up out of his seat in a decidedly dramatic fashion. “How on earth the Met sees fit to keep you on the payroll I will never-”
John led him through the hall to the bathroom and sat down on the rim of the deep tub as Sherlock undressed. “How about,” he turned on the tap and tested the temperature. “A bath?”
“That depends entirely on the case,” Sherlock replies, dragging a roll through his sauce before turning it over and letting the other side soak up the sodium.
“There’s been some speculation that you were involved in an altercation with James Moriarty prior to his removal from the Games. Is there any truth to this statement?”
“Not- it wasn’t a direct threat, but he made it seem as though he was aware someone had been in their villa. Which would mean that he went back there before they went to -  Christ Sherlock, we could have been caught! You would have been-“
As it happens, it’s a terrible idea; he very nearly chokes on the toothpaste, opting to spit the entire brush into the sink. There’s an email there, amongst the replies from Lestrade and the pleas of people to take their cases, from John. There’s no subject, and for some reason that sets Sherlock’s nerves on edge.
John smiles; digitalis. How strange. What a strange life Guest must lead, he muses for the umpteenth time. He finds himself just as drawn to that fact as he was from the start, and before he knows it, his fingers are flying across the keyboard. He’s missed this more than he’d thought, he realizes. He’s missed the simplicity with which they communicated, he missed speculating on what Guest was doing, where he was sitting, what he looked like in the dim glow of his laptop. He’s missed
“You’re proud, but you carry it in a way that speaks to your abilities and not false imaginings you have of yourself. You’ve a surgeon’s hands though you’ve clearly not performed surgery in years and yet you chose to stay within the medical profession. Oftentimes when surgeons suffer conditions that cause them to lose their dexterity they eschew medicine entirely. Yet, you stay. You’re a thrill seeker, already having told me about your days as a biathlete. Between that and the army it’s clear to see why you’re here; you want a change of pace, something exciting that you can’t predict. And, the chance to help people with potentially serious injuries, nasty injuries skiers endure.”
“Oh,” Lestrade parrots. “Just seems like you wanted to talk about something there. Molly, the morgue technician. Is that why you’re all, all,
There, nestled between another email from Harry and one from the NHS reminding him of the criteria that he must meet in order to retain his medical license, is a reply from Guest.
They’d spoken with an architect–recommended, strangely enough, by Anderson–and they’d begun working with him shortly after the explosion. The floor plan was to be open, another bedroom added where the den had once been, the fireplace restored. John had only needed moderate convincing to agree to move into the space.
“I…” John seemed to consider his words carefully, even as he reached out a hand to rest over Sherlock’s knoee. “I want you to win, I think I’ve made that rather plain. And not just to you. I like you a lot and I don’t- I don’t like how he baits you, how he talks about you in the press. I just don’t. And if that colors my judgement then…”
, not like you need to put massive pressure on your foot or anything.” Greg drawled, took a sip of his coffee and huffed out a sigh. “Right then, you bloody idiot, gather your things, you’ve a gold to win so hurry the fuck up!” His chipper tone caused Sherlock to roll his eyes, but he did as he was told.
Sherlock tossed his head back and barked out a laugh, his whole body shaking with the effort. A giddiness filled him and he found that he couldn’t stop smiling down at his phone as he thought of how to reply.
LONDON, England - Sherlock Holmes is not what one would call a homebody, though he’s often to be found at home. Sitting on a posh leather sofa and surrounded by precarious-looking chemistry equipment, he cuts a striking figure more likely to be seen on the catwalk than on the slopes.
“I thought you weren’t really concerned about that?” John sounded curious and unsure, but he still took a little step back in Sherlock’s direction.
It’s past noon and there’s nothing more to do; the rest of his day stretches out blank and empty in his mind and he’s struck with a pang of terror. His therapist visits have presented him with an awful possibility, have unearthed a truly terrible scenario: what if the rest of his days are just this, this bleak existence?
if you believe they can recall the mountain with such clarity. I’m sure other athletes prepare and race in their
“Are you, that is to say, there was Mary and Sarah and, that one with the hair and the other one with the eczema, but.” Sherlock’s eyes flash. “There were never any… men.”
There was something off about the man, about that much Sherlock was sure. But what? It was likely that he was using equipment that wasn’t to IOC code, altering his skis in some way; it was the only rational way for him to pull such fast times when he hadn’t been training as he once had. While it was Moriarty’s fourth Olympics as well and he was a seasoned skier, something about his qualifying times didn’t make sense. They kept getting
His challenger came out of the gate explosively, body bent to perfection as he took on the first set of turns. Sherlock couldn’t rightly tell how well his skis were cutting into the snow due to the large pixels on the monitor and the sunlight that obstructed his view. He’d have to review tape of it later, when he was alone.
He pours them each a standard finger, knowing the dangers, and knowing his limits. Heis getting back to the place where he can enjoy a nice drink without fear of overdoing it.
“We weren’t ready, we weren’t…no, we weren’t ready.” John sighs, turning his head a bit this way, a bit that, feels Sherlock respond, skin to skin. It’s quiet, it’s warm, it’s lovely and all a bit strange, just being this close, this together, in this flat. John savors it, pulls the scent of Sherlock deep into his lungs and doesn’t let go until he feels he might burst.
Pressing his tongue into his front teeth in consternation, he reconsidered. John was a smart man, a strong man, a man of very obvious reserve. He could trust John to make that decision for himself, couldn’t he? Or, Sherlock wondered, was he just being selfish in hoping that John realized the obstacles to being Sherlock’s friend and simply chose not to allow that to stop him?
John thought for a moment, pouring some bath liquid beneath the tap before crossing to the sink. Their eyes met in the mirror. “Dancing and tequila, I suppose.”
, his fingers itch to write, because otherwise he feels like he’s somehow lying to John. Does John think Sherlock knows how to respond to situations like that? Does John think that Sherlock could suss that out on his own as being what John logically wanted to hear?
Sherlock peeked up at John’s face, delighted to see that he’d been right, that John had covered his eyes with his arm and was silently cursing to himself. He chuckled against John’s left nipple as he moved to give it the same attention and that drew a groan from John, the vibrations from his laughter having caused a pleasurable rumble against John’s skin.
John leaves, not bothering to finish his cappuccino, fisting his hands deep into the pockets of his coat and resolves to walk home, head bent down against the wind.
Once inside, Sherlock shakes the water from his coat–wool does tend to absorb moisture in the most disgusting of ways–and catches John eyeing him up as he does so. It shouldn’t thrill him, knowing that John likes him, but it truly does. He takes a moment to fluff his hair back up as well, noting that John’s eyes do not leave his face.
“Hm?” John’s eyes take a moment, sliding across the floor until his gaze meets Sherlock’s feet and begins to trail up his  body.
Greg groaned in defeat and let him be but John nudged at him again, still smiling; Sherlock caught a whiff of his scent, spicy but muted, mingling with clean sweat and a crispness that lingered from the air outside. “Come on, one drink.”
It is distinctly pleasant and friendly and Sherlock sleeps well for the four hours he manages. He wakes and feels cheerful but exhausted, and he only manages a short walk with Redbeard before returning to the flat to begin his day.
Moriarty considered, levering his head back and forth. “Oh not mad, no. No, just opportunistic, but then aren’t we all. It was a happy accident when my people stumbled on this new compound! Couldn’t get it sanctioned but then… I’m am ever resourceful, don’t you think?”
John bit his lip and turned to look out the window, then shifted to glance across the expanse of restaurant before finally turning his eyes back on Sherlock. “Kind of hard not to. You look like a dream out there.”
“Hah,” Sherlock tried again, terror renewing this efforts. “Help!” he called and was immediately met with the kick of Moran’s solid boot in the center of his ribs. A dull, throbbing pain radiated out and a second later the shock wore off and pain tore through him, jagged and searing.“Fuck, help!”
Sherlock unfurls, stretches his legs out before him and leans his head back on the sofa cushion, and turns his head to look at John once more. “Your penchant for elaborate, saccharine language doesn’t extend to declarations of love, I see.”
“Hmmm,” Sherlock hums. “Just pondering if I’ll even be able to get back on skis the next time we’re here. If we’re even asked back.”
Sherlock stared down at the table for a long moment, allowing the tidbits of information that he’d come across to flit over the screen of his mind. Sherlock had numerous reasons for suspecting Moriarty, the foundation of implicating data fairly strong in Sherlock’s mind. But what had John seen or heard that made him believe similarly? Sherlock’s eyes traced the fabricated patterns in the faux wood for a moment more before turning to snap his gaze to John’s face. “But what leads you to believe he had something to do with Hanzu’s death? Did you see something? Hear something? Anything?”
John pushes him half-heartedly away with a playful shove, a flicker of his eyebrows as a challenge, “You want to come in your pants?”
Between the alcohol and the intense workout he’d had in the morning, his body was just about ready to give in. Sherlock remembered belatedly that he hadn’t had a thing to eat since lunch time save for some pretzels at the bar, but couldn’t be arsed to get out of bed to find food once he’d drawn the covers over himself.
Their buses were miraculously still waiting for them at the airport although they’d landed nearly three hours late. By the time Sherlock stepped off of the plane he was a ball of antagonistic energy, doing his best to put off anyone who dared speak to him. He gathered his luggage and tore the customs tags from the case, weaving through those still waiting to pick up their luggage. He entrusted all of his equipment to his ski team and didn’t bother to wait around to speak with them.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock hummed, but gazed down at John who stared back up at him. John cracked a bloody smile and then winced, Sherlock’s fingertips slipping carefully over his cheek. “We need to get you to a hospital.”
He skipped up the last few steps, following John, and tossed the door closed with finality. Once inside the flat, Sherlock shed his coat and hung John’s, watching while John glanced around the room. “Violin?” John asked as he came upon the case. “You play?”
John made a show of looking Sherlock over once more. “You look a bit stiff, are you sure you’re alright?”
Sherlock glances over, shaking his head, aloof. “Hirscher is slated to win, and I believe he will. But, he certainly hasn’t been training as hard this season and missed a qualifier in November, but he is the favorite to win this giant slalom, though I’m not sure
“Silly me, yes! Of course, I can forward you along all of the information if you leave me your email? Pay, NHS nonsense, all of that.” Harried, she sticks her hand in the breast pocket of her lab coat and when she extracts it, a few tissues float to the floor, but she’s managed to present John with one of her business cards. “Just write it on that. Or keep that and email me and I’ll email you back or--”
Greg sipped at his coffee, eyes widening in disbelief. “You say yes, just like that? No argument at all?”
When he turns, John is behind him. “Wait, wait, I… I’m.” John frowns, rolls his eyes and blows out a breath. “I’m sorry. I think we… no, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.”
, his mind supplies haughtily–to Sherlock Holmes, then perhaps Sherlock doesn’t see all of himself, either.
Not the most inventive segues into normal conversation and Sherlock found himself frowning at the banal attempt. “Yes, took some doing but eventually...”
Their kissing slows, mouths meeting the edge of jaws, collarbones, cheeks. There’s a little laugh from Sherlock when John dips to nose along behind his ear before licking the lobe into his mouth.
A buoyancy fills him, an odd sort of manic wonder. “In your arse, was hoping,” Sherlock cheekily replies, knowing exactly the effect that his word choice will have on John, wanting to see it.
Greg slapped a handful of quarters down on the table. “Well, let’s get this party started!” And with that he snatched up a few coins and went to the jukebox. A moment later, synth pumped through the sound system and the opening strains of “It’s Raining Men” had people laughing and moving onto the small dancefloor.
Blood pulsed through his veins, slicking into and out of his heart; his body waiting for the moment when the muscle would beat double, triple, the adrenaline satisfying his seemingly undying craving.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he knew instantly that the level of concern he felt was far beyond what the situation called for; his lips twisted in personal disapproval.
He winced as the meaty sound of flesh on flesh came from across the room; Moran was focusing the brunt of his efforts on John now and that knowledged caused a deluge of pain and regret to tear through Sherlock’s chest.
. He knows that the search engine can’t provide him with those answers, but he might at least find something to occupy him until he’s made himself weary enough to go to sleep.
John swallowed and tilted his chin in Greg’s direction. “On the plane actually, we both took a seat at the back of the plane-”
John looked so intent, as though he had something planned. Reaching forward, he plucked the glass from Sherlock and placed it alongside his on the coffee table, sidling right up to Sherlock immediately after, his nose trailing along behind Sherlock’s hairline. He heard John sigh and then suddenly, John was straddling Sherlock’s legs, his arse settling back on his knees.
They remained silent for a bit, until the cabbie interrupted the tranquility. “Oi, ain’t you that bloke that won the gold in skiing?”
Mike presses his lips together and considers. “Mmmmm, strictly speaking it isn’t, but she’s right. Sherlock
Sherlock called his agent, Molly, and his parents in that order, making sure all of his bases were covered and leaving his agent and Molly to distribute the information about his condition to those that needed to know. Then he settled on his bed and dialed John.
And again, Sherlock has no earthly idea what to say; it’s an entirely fascinating and enraging feeling.
There was no warning save for the tightening of his hand in Sherlock’s hair, and John came, spurting hot and fast into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock did his best to keep up swallowing, but a bit managed to dribble out over his lips; he chased it with a tongue, just in time for a stripe to paint his chin in the last of John’s release.
“I’ve got to keep my energy up. There’s a training run tomorrow and I can’t afford to let this get in the way, not again. I’m not going to let Moriarty derail me, not now.” With a flick of his wrist, Sherlock opened the menu and then glanced up at John from beneath his eyelashes.
The group paused, just off to the center of the room as Moriarty glanced stoically around, and then out of nowhere broke into a grin and threw up his hands. “Well, don’t all go welcoming me at once.”
Casually, he takes a sip, and then his eyes widen at the glass. “That…is actually the best wine I’ve ever had,” John takes another sip, savoring it, and then leans back against his seat, smiles. “All of that deducing, knowing what people are, who they are, it’s fascinating. Must be a helpful skill to have.”
Sherlock finds himself slightly charmed and reaches out, shaking firmly; model good looks and a skier's body, he is momentarily arrested by Kenworthy’s rugged though polished demeanor. Sherlock had taken notice of Kenworthy, simply due to the fact that both he and Sherlock were skiers. John had caught Sherlock mid-perusal of Kenworthy’s Instagram, and they’d both taken a moment to appreciate his abs.
“Not a bad time. Had a kip, woke to the news. Please.” He stood back and gestured John in with a sweep of his arm. John walked past and Sherlock ducked into the bathroom and retrieved a fluffy white robe, pulling it around himself haphazardly.
I can say to make you reconsider that, you utter madman?” John sounded reproachful, though he was smiling fondly.
He does what he can to live up to the expectation of a first date with his best friend, but the slow buzz of the knowledge that they will be sharing a bed keeps pulling his attention to darker, more salacious corners of his mind.
It’s very nearly unbearable, the ping-ponging of emotions that he’s experiencing, the juxtaposed thoughts. He consciously makes an effort and banishes them, sitting down hard in front of his laptop. Perhaps it will be easier to suss out exactly what he wants to do about this–if anything at all–if he actually talks to Guest.
Sherlock sighs, leans back into the sofa and reads over John5NF’s–John’s, Sherlock mentally corrects–email. He has absolutely no idea what John must feel like; he’s never been part of a cohesive group before. The closest he came was perhaps when he was away at school, forced into moments of institutionalized camaraderie with the other chaps in his class. The sporadic meetings hadn’t taken and Sherlock had been left blissfully to his own devices.
The thought startles him, how positively romantic it is. Sherlock, too, wonders if John Watson is simply stirring up a dormant part of him that another might have been able to as well, or if this is unique to John.
“Are your,” John doesn’t know why he feels the need to speak. He’s never felt the need to fill space with words before, “sheets clean?”
There’s nothing hurried when they enter their shared room. Sherlock slips out of his suit jacket and unbuttons the cuffs at his wrists while John toes off his loafers, manuevering them to neatness by the door. It would be a night like any other, getting ready to retire for the evening, if there wasn’t such purpose in the way Sherlock stands before him.
“Do you…” Sherlock begins and then trails off, shaking his head at his inability to form sentences that sound correct.
“Me specifically, and yes, they do, but they still like talking about that gorgeous face.” John reaches out and lightly smacks Sherlock’s face with his palm. “Bad press is bad for all of us, is what I’m trying to say. You can talk shite about everyone to me, just don’t take it too far, yeah? Try and be amiable? In public? For me.”
“Mike! I--he’s just, a good friend and brilliant and sometimes he needs specimens that can’t be procured otherwise and I… help him with that,” she finishes meekly.
There was a moment of silence and then Sherlock briefly explained to Lestrade what had happened. “Moriarty is planning on pinning it all on Moran; we can’t let that happen.”
“Right,” John murmured, already headed in the direction of his room, fingers still curled tightly into his palm. “Well, I suppose… I, ehm, g’night.”
Sherlock has already folded back the duvet, and stands aside for John to look his fill. “Preferred side?” Sherlock asks, rather formally, and John shrugs. “I find that I sleep best on the far side; will the light from the loo bother you?”
, needed to devise some way to both out Moriarty and ensure that it didn’t affect his own performance on the slopes. His fingers threaded through the hair at the sides of his head and he tugged as he slumped back against a brick wall, waiting for the many passersby to dissipate.
“Are you kidding?’ John chuckled indignantly,. They’d traveled together plenty, already, and Sherlock tended to be a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type of traveller. Most of the responsibilities on that front had fallen to John.  “First off, I’m not packing for you.”
, but just a bit, don’t want to come on too strong.” Sherlock looks so damned self-satisfied that John wants to throw his coffee at him. “A
Sherlock exhaled harshly through his nose and settled the weights on the rack, fingers still curled around the handles. John turned and began walking away and Sherlock couldn’t stomach it, couldn’t
He can tell that John is feeling similarly; he’s been quiet, and a bit withdrawn, and Sherlock knows that will take them both a few days to find themselves back on even emotional footing. Adrenaline ebbs away and leaves a cavern of tangible loss.
John eats and Sherlock picks; the food is delicious but he finds he’s not terribly hungry, just going through the motions of eating, picking at this and that. But it’s quite something, the tiny, hot thrill that runs through him every time John reaches across the small table to take something from a shared plate.
That’s an interesting question and Sherlock mulls it over for the briefest of moments. White rose in his pocket? Wear a certain hat? Describe the coat he’ll be wearing? Sherlock scrunches up his face, thinks and thinks, turns his head and glances his reflection in the window. It only takes him a moment to remember how physically striking he is, and in a fit of confidence he types back,
John was already seated at a table when Sherlock showed up, but Sherlock requested that they be seated in a more private spot on the second level; it wouldn’t do to have more paparazzi photos surface in the midst of his investigation. It was a delicate matter and Sherlock’s credibility would be on the line if he brought any damning evidence to light. He didn’t need the added stress of the media prying into his personal life alongside that.
John hunkers down on the sofa, snatching the photos from Sherlock’s hand. They’re bound together by twine, each individually wrapped, a post-it note denoting the more obvious details of the case. Sherlock must have meant to file them, but as his life–their life–unraveled, he must have forgotten. Some are proper police photos and others are from Sherlock’s phone, or from John’s small, efficient digital camera. Most are gory, some are artful and others are just plain confusing.
Sherlock considered; it wasn’t an overt threat, but it was certainly a possibility that Moran knew more than his veiled threat was letting on. He did, after all, know the exact suite in which Sherlock was staying. He bit at his lip and thought; even if Moran had an
If Moriarty was headed back, they had little time to slip back out, unnoticed. Sherlock placed everything back as he found it and hurried back out into the living area, calling John’s name quietly. John popped his head out from around a corner, eyes wide at the urgency in Sherlock’s tone.
“Okay,” John said on a breath, settling his hands palms-down on his knees. “I’ve something to tell you, as well. You’re uhm, you might think I’m crazy but just…”
“Hmmm, acceptable,” Sherlock says, and at the look that crosses John’s face, he continues, “Bit preoccupied with what happens after the date.” He clips the ‘t’ hard, as he might when having a bit of a go at someone, but John is aware that the tic extends to the few times his nerves get the best of him.
“A challenge for you, then?” Lestrade’s eyes were still focused across the room at Molly, who was fighting diligently to get her drink from the bartender.
Sherlock flops down on the bed next to John, his arms flailing so wide that he nearly catches John in the groin. Shifting, John sits up, glancing down at Sherlock’s frowning face, and reaches to smooth over a cheekbone, oblivious at his attempt to soothe him as Sherlock shouts, “I put on a tie for this!”
John’s arms went lax, his hands and Sherlock’s falling to his side. “Am I?” he muttered. “So are you.”
he had been. It’d been such a pleasant surprise to Sherlock. “That… difficult fellow I was telling you about,” he mentions to Redbeard as they walk and he chews. “He may not be so difficult after all. Aside from his seemingly endless desire to have conversation, he may not be entirely disagreeable. I was entirely correct about the psychosomatic limp, by the way.”
Sherlock licked his lips and considered insulting the as yet faceless man, eventually deciding against it. “There are other seats,” Sherlock said coolly, but not as impolitely as he might have, without opening his eyes, crossing his arms tighter against his chest in silent defiance. He mentally tallied the number of seats on the flight and the number of people aboard and found that yes, there actually
But John just moved to stand beside him, reached out the hand that held his pint and gestured towards a group of ice skaters.
It wasn’t until the official had entered to tell them shortly that it would be another five minutes before they were prepared to start that Moriarty and his company barged into the space. It had been quiet before, but the volume reduced even further as he entered, the hulking figure of Sebastian Moran pulling up the rear with the man’s skis.
Sherlock took the elevator to his floor and rounded the corner towards his room and was delightfully surprised to find John leaning against his door. Blushing, he glanced down at his shoes, and looked back up to find John clasping his hands together and pumping them over either shoulder in a mock show of celebration.
“Course not,” John returns, some of the rigidness going out of his form, “Making an observation. Kinda like he does, just-“
“Yeah, you know I get a cut of all of your endorsements this go round,” Greg joked as they exited the tram to head back to their respective hotels for the few hours’ rest they’d get.
There’s something that lights in Sherlock’s eyes, something that seems almost dangerous. John takes a moment to work out exactly what’s being held there, and is unnerved and thrilled to find that it’s unguarded lust. It’s a striking look on Sherlock, colours his cheeks the slightest bit pink; John finds his mouth goes a bit dry just witnessing it.
John grinned and nearly jumped out of Sherlock’s lap and moved towards the kitchen, snapping up his duffel bag on the way. Sherlock admired his retreating form and after pressing his hand to his erection to rearrange it a bit, tamed the fire for the evening. Then he followed in John’s footsteps, shutting the lights as he went, locking up, ensuring that they wouldn’t be disturbed.
“Why must you insist? You’re always… insistent.” Sherlock growled; John insisted even when he wasn’t present, elbowed his way into Sherlock’s thoughts and wouldn’t leave until Sherlock turned him over in his mind a few times.
The entire walk back to Baker Street, Sherlock turns the details of the case over in his mind, binning the needless effluvia in the skip round back of his mind palace. Everything else he tucks neatly away.
And as he’s trying to decide how to continue with his reply, a small bit of text pops up on the left-hand side of his screen.
Confused, he took a step towards his things, spying a note tucked into the front flap of his laptop bag.
John sits down in front of the telly for a bit of Baking Show, but his mind keeps being tugged towards the question of what’s in the bag. His eyes keep straying towards the bathroom as he wonders.
A woman, freckles, and long brown hair, short nails clicking over the keys of her laptop as the dog paces by the door, waiting to go out. A man, bald, thick fingers tapping over his PC’s keyboard while a dog rests by his feet. It almost gives the emails an intimate quality, knowing something so, well,
