Cas is wearing a sweater that Dean’s definitely given him shit about before – as if Cas really cared – but Dean’s man enough to admit that he was probably just jealous, projecting his insecurities onto Cas, too caught up in his own nonsense to enjoy something like wearing a sweater. Dean’s certainly got no complaints about it now, appreciating how the plush fabric makes Cas even more enticing to cuddle up to, warm and soft and comforting.
“Good?” Cas echoes, lingering concern in his voice.
Dean makes a noise, either a laugh or a sob or somewhere in between, and reels Cas in again, a surge of elation bubbling up within him: It feels like the first time they kissed, the first time they touched without the flimsy pretense of being strictly friends, the moment Cas decided to stay. As far back as he can remember, his vision of the future’s been vague and muddy – but the image is suddenly bright and sharp, nothing but love and safety and Cas, Cas, Cas. It’s real now. They’re family.
He and Dean have just been in this strange limbo for so long now, he thinks as he waits for the coffee to brew. He’s simply gotten used to how he feels about Dean, to existing with it and not knowing what he’s able to ask for, uncertain if Dean feels the same or if he ever will. Castiel is aware that there are ways to find out, but… perhaps his reservations aren’t so far from Dean’s, and this is just one thing he’s never able to be brave about. The risks are too great, and he’s not willing to lose Dean by being too greedy.
Dean almost scoffs at the question because c’mon, Cas probably knows already. But after a beat he realizes that although Cas can read Dean with terrifying accuracy sometimes, even he has his limits. Some things he’s just not going to understand unless Dean finds the nerve to tell him.
“Anyway,” Sam says, “I’m gonna see what his employees have to say. Bet someone around here’s got some dirt.” He turns to Dean expectantly. “You coming?”
as quietly as he can manage, delighted when that encourages Cas to quicken his pace, hand still gripping Dean’s thigh tight enough to bruise. He whispers Cas’s name, just to test the shape of it in his mouth, excited by hearing himself say it in a way he’s never been before. That earns him a growled

now, placating thoughts to return to when his problematic feelings bubble over, ways to ponder something more palatable to keep those feelings from reaching a boiling point in the first place.
Dean, to sit beside him and enjoy this idle, quiet state that they find themselves in too infrequently. His mind drifts as Dean sleeps soundly through the night, finally stirring once the morning is well underway.
, he kinda can’t believe they actually did that.
Ramona’s rusty pick-up is parked by the bank of the reservoir, slightly obscured by the tall grass. Jones is already standing near it, looking surlier than ever when they pull in. Dean leaves the Impala a few yards away and they follow the worn dirt path down to the waterline.
His smile is infectious as always, and Castiel chuckles along with him. This isn’t a façade or deflection, it’s open euphoria and affection, and the sight of it makes Castiel’s heart beat wildly.
He feels so damn empty when Cas pulls out, but, well, that’s certainly about to change. Cas doesn’t spend too long basking in the afterglow, because he clearly hasn’t forgotten about their plans either; he wastes no time in trailing his hand up Dean’s thigh and sinking two fingers inside him, tracing circles in fascination where Dean’s still wet and open. He’ll do this for ages if Dean lets him, chase his own come with his tongue and eat Dean out until he’s practically in tears – and that’s definitely not a bad thing, but they had other plans, and there’s no way they could stray down that path without both of them getting completely distracted. It took Dean long enough to work up the nerve to get them here, and he’s not about to get side-tracked now.
He senses Dean’s presence a moment before he strides into the room, but he’s still caught somewhat off-guard by his sudden appearance.
He makes a discontented sound when Castiel pulls away, but his pout fades when Castiel braces himself and tries rolling his hips, just a slow back and forth at first, thrusts longer and deeper until he withdraws almost completely, Dean groaning when he pushes all the way inside again.
“Mmm?” Dean replies, close to nodding off in Cas’s lap.
. What’re you in such a hurry for anyway?”
“I don’t understand why you feign indifference,” Cas says, eyes flicking towards Dean’s as he presses a kiss over Dean’s heart. “We both know you’re eager for this,” he adds, hands sliding to Dean’s ass and squeezing. Dean flushes a bit, but doesn’t deny it. “
“Until now.” Cas fills in for him. He isn’t angry, Dean knows that much, but he’s clearly not thrilled, probably still processing this turn of events.
Castiel looks into Dean’s eyes, surprised to find them glazed over with tears. “Took you long enough,” Dean teases, as if his forced laugh distracts Castiel from the raw emotion in his gaze.
“It doesn’t bother me,” Cas says gently, maybe seeing the worry in Dean’s face.
He tips over the edge with a moan that Dean echoes when Castiel spills onto his tongue. Dean swallows everything Castiel has to give him, throat working around Castiel’s cock, and Castiel swears again at the heightened sensation, gasps Dean’s name.
And yep, there it is, the palpable hint of a threat, the suggestion of a growl in his voice. Cas can be scary as shit when he wants to be, and a smarter man than Jones would’ve taken Cas up on the offer to shut his damn trap and move on, but the pompous ass just keeps right on going, takes another step into Cas’s space, looks on in silence for a beat or two. “Oh, I get it now,” he says, evidently changing tack now that he realizes exposing Dean doesn’t have the impact on Cas that he was hoping for. “Ya know, the tough guy act is
A sense of protectiveness washes over Dean because it’s true – nothing’s gonna happen to Cas, not if Dean has anything to say about it.
It’s as much an insistence as it is a genuine question, an assurance that Dean has the ultimate say in how this goes. “I—Yeah,” Dean says hoarsely, even if he’s not as sure about that as Cas is. For Cas, he can definitely try.
“You can make it up to me,” Castiel says breezily, a faint smile on his face. He didn’t mean for it to sound suggestive, but he can’t regret it when he sees the interest shining in Dean’s eyes, the flush on his face. Castiel feels an unfamiliar thrill shoot through him over making Dean blush. He’s looking forward to doing it again. Castiel lets the charged silence sit for a moment, thoroughly enjoying it, before breaking it. “You knew all along that it was nothing? Even from the beginning?” he asks, legitimately curious. He’s seen less telling cases turn into something serious, and more suspicious scenarios turn out to be false alarms. Their

this, he can do what Cas asks.
He observes Dean for a second – sprawled face down and fully-clothed on the bedspread again, shoes not even removed – and clears his throat. “Dean?” It’s a delicate balance, raising his voice enough to get through to Dean but keeping it subdued enough to avoid startling him into a violent, half-conscious reaction. That’s become something of a running joke among them, but Castiel can’t help but look past it to the underlying cause, and it makes him ache to think that Dean feels so unsafe, so persecuted, before he’s even fully conscious.
revelation?
“That sounds nice,” Cas says sincerely, watching Dean instead of working on the puzzle. “Which beach?”
Cas is better than that, that’s what makes it so fun when he lets go and acts like he is decidedly not above base emotions, gets all grumpy and demanding and handsy. Because that’s not who he is, not really, so Dean has nothing to worry about. Cas isn’t some insecure asshole who treats Dean like an object instead of a person, just something to be owned and selfishly guarded. If anything, Cas treats Dean more like a person than anyone else ever has.
Dean sags into their next kiss with utter relief. “Okay,” he says at length, “That’s, um…” He wants to make things official somehow but
“Do you have one?” Cas asks without missing a beat, sounding surprised but intrigued.
It’s a dull, grey morning, the sun just barely peeking over the horizon, when Cas and Dean reluctantly roll out of their creaky motel bed. It’s early as shit and Dean’s tired, but he’s good – on the road with Cas, taking on jobs that are important but not too tough,
. Physically, there’s nothing intimidating about them at all, but the judgment in their eyes has Dean stupidly shaken, feeling exposed. They’ve seen this side of him and they don’t care for it at all, and as little as Dean cares about the opinion of two backwater hicks at the local Wal-Mart, it still touches a nerve.
It wasn’t long ago that Dean wouldn’t want to hear of such a thing, to know how badly Castiel wanted to keep him safe. But it’s starting to look like he might be more open to that, more willing to put his trust in Castiel. Castiel’s seeing more and more of that raw vulnerability from Dean – when they’re talking into the late hours, when they’re in the midst of passion. Even when they’re not saying or doing much at all. Like one instance when they’re in front of the fire on a rainy night, beside each other in comfortable silence, and there’s a moment when Dean turns to look at him that Castiel sees everything laid bare, the unfettered emotion in Dean’s eyes, every bit of Castiel’s adoration reflected right back at him.
Dean’s grin softens into something that’s as close to shy as Castiel’s ever seen on him. “Okay,” he says after a few moments of deliberation, idly stroking Castiel on the arm, sliding his hand up to his shoulder to lean in and kiss him on the cheek before taking his seat.
Apparently Dean’s initial response of, “Oh hell no,” wasn’t clear enough, because instead of  taking him at his word and dropping the subject like a
Castiel keeps at it for a while, highlighting relevant passages and bookmarking promising websites, but the longer Castiel sits there, the more he can tell that Dean’s sleep isn’t particularly restful.

“I thought you might be angry. I was invading something private.”
And sure, he phrases that like a joke as he always does, but it’s not even remotely an exaggeration. He’s still restless from adrenaline like he’s the one who threw a punch, keyed up from watching Cas deck that asshole in his fat mouth.

It seems unreal.
As the initial shock fades, Dean purses his lips and shifts awkwardly; that word doesn’t seem right, not for Dean. He doesn’t want to tell Cas no, though, doesn’t have the energy, eyes darting away from Cas’s too-earnest gaze.
Cas gives him an inscrutable look. “Dean—”

Then he realizes he’s just in Cas’s way, blocking the end of the bench, and he stumbles back a few paces, embarrassed on too many levels to keep up with.

Castiel was able to suspend disbelief for a while, but Dean has complained about youth internet culture loudly and often in the past, and Castiel is justifiably dubious that he’d suggest something like this over something more hands-on. Dean is quite clearly avoiding something, and Castiel can’t think of anything he’s more averse to facing than his own feelings.

Dean tries not to let on, but he can’t say that he doesn’t dread checking into motels nowadays, anticipating that moment when he asks for a single for him and Cas (or a double, if they’re with Sam) and the clerk looks at them and does the math. Dean hates feeling like he’s making a pronouncement just because they need somewhere to pass out for a few hours, waiting for the person at the counter to arrive at the inevitable conclusion. Reactions ranging from impassive to judgmentally closed-off are the worst that Dean’s had personal experience with, but he wrestles with the constant worry that today might be the day the bar gets set even lower, all too aware of how potentially extreme a negative response could be.

for Dean, and Dean feels an absurd rush of pride that he brought Cas to such a state without even touching him. Cas leans in to kiss him thoroughly, a slick slide of tongues, the sharp nip of teeth. “Turn over,” he insists, almost a growl. “Let me give you what you asked for.”
Charlie glares at him. “Lies and slander,” she says haughtily. “And anyway, if you’re gonna hang out with your cute gay friend – who so
“The hell is that?” Dean asks, leaning closer to inspect a tear in Cas’s shirt sleeve, a few inches down from his shoulder. It’s almost hidden in the red plaid pattern, but that’s definitely blood staining the fabric, a nasty looking cut visible through the frayed hole.
“Cas,” Dean cries out, barely aware he’s saying anything at all, “
He taps out

“I had you just like this,” Cas confesses, starting to curl towards Dean again, hand on Dean’s hip. Dean wishes he’d let his touch wander further, give Dean’s aching cock some relief. “Was inside you so deep.”
“You totally did,” Dean agrees with a breathy laugh. “That was awesome.” He’s still so damn thankful that Cas made the first move, because his dumb ass would’ve let them dance around each other for a couple more years at
They’re ready to hit the road a few days later, and although Dean’s pretty sure he and Cas have an unspoken understanding about what they’re hoping for, he’s still thrilled that Cas tags along. When they roll into Lebanon, Dean immediately heads for a long overdue shower, indulging in the hot spray until he finally feels some of his stiff muscles start to unlock. He emerges from the bathroom, half-worried he’ll find that Cas has disappeared on him again, that things between them aren’t as fixed as he thought, but when he steps into his bedroom, Cas is there waiting. He’s lounging on Dean’s bed, coats and tie discarded, collar unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up to expose his thick, tan forearms and
that’s nothing compared to the aura of smugness radiating from him right now.
Even comparatively innocuous interactions that he was so sure he’d learn to brush off can be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. Maybe it’s been a long day, he’s frustrated, and he jumps at the chance to have an outlet for his ever-increasing agitation. Or maybe he’s had to deal with so many smaller infractions one after the other that it starts to add up, and almost before he knows it, he’s giving in to that side of himself, no longer able to be diplomatic or subtle despite his internal efforts to act civil. Castiel’s not proud of the way he reacts when they’re out shopping and a salesman tells Dean the shirt he’s considering will bring out his eyes, but, well… it’s hardly the first time they’ve defiled a department store dressing room.
It seems like neither of them is ready to sleep yet, so they find something to watch on Netflix, Dean’s head in Cas’s lap instead of the computer, Cas gently running his fingers through Dean’s hair.
. Dean ended up firmly pinned in place, didn’t struggle even a little as Cas sank his teeth into his neck – a cliché pair of perfectly pointed canines, nothing at all like the real thing, thank fuck – and yanked Dean’s belt open, jerked Dean off right there in that filthy alley.
That irritates Dean to no end because this is
“No.”
, he’s right there.
“I—” Dean flushes, unprepared to have that moment of weakness thrown back at him so soon, but it’s less humiliating than he would’ve thought. He knows how good it feels to want Cas and be wanted by him; any potential shame is easily eclipsed by the swoop of renewed arousal in his stomach. Going for another round would probably be pushing it, at this point, but he’s not sure that would stop him.
and oh, Jesus, it’s not like they’re alone in the bunker. What if Sam’s still up and wandering around?
type shit. “Sounds like a pretty straightforward haunting,” Sam says. “Textbook, almost.”
“You really don’t think it’s weird?” Dean asks out of the blue one evening, pacing the motel room floor while Castiel’s seated at the table, looking over their latest findings. Sam’s gone out to pick up dinner. Castiel looks up from the laptop, silently imploring Dean to continue. Dean clears his throat, looks down at the carpet. “That I like it when you, uh… rough me up a little.”
Cas juiced up in all his angelic glory is definitely a beautiful thing to witness, but there’s something about seeing him like this, casual and relaxed, turning off that immense power, that appealed to Dean too. It didn’t make him weaker, just… more accessible, no longer the untouchable, unknowable divine creature that Dean had met all those years ago.
images remain as vivid as ever, and he squirms at the thought of them, still buzzing with arousal, but he’s definitely gonna ignore that because—yeah. That happened.
His face is on fire right now, no matter how damn hard he tries to will his blush away, and if he weren’t embarrassed enough that he actually said that, the sappy expression that Charlie melts into would definitely be flat-out mortifying. He knows she only refrains from cooing

look about him, know what I mean?”
One evening, Dean’s in the war room, finally tackling that one annoying wobbly chair, when he hears footsteps. He isn’t expecting it, but when he looks up there’s Cas, just as abruptly as he’d vanished. Dean licks his lips, heart pounding, and if he’d had any doubt that his feelings for Cas might go a little deeper than he’d first thought, there’d be no arguing against that now. Dean’s not an expert on this, but he’s experienced it enough to know what it is, to know that it’s more terrifying and overwhelming than it’s ever been.
in a desperate litany, but Cas is already giving him more, still switching up the pace and force of his strikes just enough to keep Dean on his toes.
“Christ.” Dean laughs again, scrubs a hand over his face, feeling like an idiot, almost giddy with relief. “You could’ve just told me that’s what was bugging you.”

Dean’s wary about those kinds of displays in public, though; Castiel understands and respects that. No matter how strong the urge is to let any interested parties know that displaying said interest is futile, that pursuing Dean is a misguided notion they’d be better off forgetting.
Castiel withdraws for a moment to make sure his hand is sufficiently slick, and the brief reprieve seems to bring some of Dean’s wits back to him. “So how do you want me?” Dean jokes, still sounding breathless and dazed, but his smile is looser than before, his humor less forced. Castiel is proud that Dean was able to get there, and that Castiel helped him do it.
Dean’s stupidly grateful for the reprieve. “Yeah. Yes. Please,” he replies immediately, aware he’s bordering on babbling by now.
Sam shakes his head. “If your dreams are freaking you out, then you need a therapist, not a lore book.”
something they need to take care of, the incident was more of the personal vendetta variety, rather than the generic, folksy sort of haunting. One look around the room tells him that this guy’s got deep pockets and likes people to know it. It’s not too hard to imagine he might’ve pissed someone off. Hell maybe he
Cas is kind enough to tone down his look of skepticism. “You seem like you have something on your mind.”
“You can…” Dean says vaguely, circling his hips more deliberately to get Cas started. He bites back a whine at the stretch and burn from even that little twitch of motion—he
Dean swallows, his eyes searching. “Yeah.”
They’re still barely scraping by money-wise, happy to accept whatever free food that diner owners are dishing out to friendly “FBI” agents, shopping around for rock-bottom motel rates. Ten years ago, Dean might have found something sort of romantic about it, living rough on the road with nothing but the absolute essentials, but now he just wants his memory foam mattress and a door he can lock behind him, misses waking up to Cas’s grumpy face and being able to linger in bed with him, kissing his stubbled jaw until he’s fully alert and smiling.
Dean huffs out a laugh. “Me too.”
“No.”
“Cas already said he’s cool with it,” Charlie chimes in with a benign smile. She’s not gloating about her impending victory – not yet – but she can definitely tell that she’s wearing him down. “And I’ll take care of the driving. Hell, I’ll even pick up the tab. That’s how much I like you losers.”
“Yes,” Castiel gladly confirms for him. “And I’m starting to realize how inadequate my imagination is.”
he is when he rubs up against Cas’s taut stomach. He stifles a moan, bucking his hips, shamelessly chasing the friction, and fuck,
Cas seems to consider that for a moment. “Are they that appealing?”
one, nicely fitted to cut an even more impressive figure.
Cas smiles at him. “Really.”
“What the hell was that about?” Sam asks.
“All right,” Cas replies, expression unreadable. He drops one last kiss on Dean’s lips before pulling back and taking his hand again, heading back onto the path.
“You’re up early,” Dean remarks, smirk forming on his face. “For once.”
Dean doesn’t know if Cas is still holding himself back or if he’s deliberately teasing, but either way it’s driving Dean crazy. Knowing Cas, it’s probably a little bit of both. He’s properly slotted in behind Dean now, a long line of heat against Dean’s back. He rests his other hand tentatively on Dean’s hip, fingertips trailing lower, brushing his thigh.
“Sorry,” she says with a tiny pout, not too over the top but clearly put on for effect. “I really wanted to help you out.”
Castiel is aware of the way Dean reacts to him, the way Dean looks at him—behavior that he could easily write off as nothing,
Cas’s hand rests heavily on Dean’s shoulder as he forces him flat again, shifting onto his knees to straddle Dean’s torso, to pin his wrists down on either side of his head.
Cas’s voice is already fading as he retreats. Dean gets quite a look from Sam when he suddenly appears, ready to work.
Unwilling to dwell for too long, Castiel quietly untangles himself from his sheets, in search of a shower. Sleep was only the first human necessity that Castiel chose to regularly engage in, but as he spent more idle hours in the bunker with Sam and Dean, more followed. Sitting for meals with them was a natural next step – not just observing but actually partaking, even if it doesn’t quite taste the same as it would if he weren’t an angel. It’s still interesting, still satisfying, especially when it’s Dean’s cooking. Castiel knows that it means a lot to Dean that he eats. He’d protested, once, that the food would be wasted on him when he didn’t need it, and Dean should save more for himself. That hadn’t gone over particularly well.
“What’s a ten-letter word for untruthful?” he asks, thoughtfully tapping the end of his pen against his bottom lip.
Charlie scoffs. “It wouldn’t sound stupid if you’d just hear me out.”
Castiel doesn’t always like the films as much as Dean does or hopes Castiel will. It’s not a testament to their quality – Castiel knows enough to understand how sentimentality and nostalgia factor in for Dean, even if he doesn’t know it or admit it himself. Castiel just doesn’t have that background or baseline to experience certain media the same way. But Dean is always excited to show him, to share some part of himself and the things he loves, and Castiel treasures that time together, Dean bringing him into his world like that. The movie could be a cinematic catastrophe, but it wouldn’t matter. There’s nothing Castiel would rather be doing.
Jones quirks one thick eyebrow, the first hint of a crack in his impassive veneer since they arrived. “Don’t tell me the feds give a shit about a missing college girl,” he scoffs. “Don’t seem worth the trip.”
“Dude,” Dean mumbles against Castiel’s shirt, “You didn’t even take your clothes off.” Dean’s stubble rasps against the fabric as he settles, undoing a few buttons and slipping his hand in, resting warm against Castiel’s sternum.
Truth be told, if Dean really were just getting a head start, so to speak, he probably wouldn’t strip down right away, knowing Cas will want to get involved and peel him reverently out of his clothes – or tear them off, depending on the day. On the other hand, if Dean were actually flying solo here, he might not bother getting fully undressed at all, just shoving as much clothing out of the way as he needed to get at his dick, to bring himself off quick and dirty. So he could just open his pants and slide his hand in like he’s done so many times before, but if he’s being
“Oh,” Castiel says in genuine surprise. That doesn’t occur to him, sometimes, always so
he sees in Cas’s eyes. “You make me want stuff I thought I’d never get to have—like this morning, waking up with you there, that was… Thought I’d have to be stupid to want that, but I do.” Doubt starts creeping in. “But if we’re doing this, I—” He pauses and swallows. “I can’t do this halfway, okay?”
seriously, but that’s exactly why Dean trusts him.
Dean doesn’t say this part out loud but… after all the shit he’s been through, everything he’s had to sacrifice… it feels like Cas is his reward for all of it. Their relationship has been a trial in itself at times, but getting through it, getting to
Dean’s glad that he and Cas didn’t drink anymore; he’s only the good kind of achy the next morning. Maybe he wouldn’t have minded if he’d gotten drunk enough to forget the incident at the bar, but he’s more than okay remembering the aftermath at home.
“Yeah, I’m—” Dean starts to say, but when he turns to look at Castiel something makes him pause. “Actually,” he says at length, closing the door again, jaw clenched, faint tremor in his fingers. “I gotta tell you something.”
“Aww,” Sam coos, mouth quirking up at the corners, “And you didn’t even ask me to walk you down the aisle?”
“Okay,” Castiel says slowly, lifting one eyebrow. Castiel doesn’t think it would be paranoid to call Dean’s reaction somewhat suspect. He’s never had a problem diving into work first thing in the morning that Castiel’s ever seen. And if Castiel didn’t know any better, he’d say Dean looks a bit nervous, growing more flustered the longer Castiel studies him, eventually turning away in search of food.
“Thank you for clarifying,” Cas says, seriously. “I want to know about

Overall, despite those kinds of setbacks, it does seem like he’s maintaining a firmer handle on himself. He has
“Cas?” Dean manages between panting breaths, confused by the look on Cas’s face.
, but he quickly reminds himself that that concept doesn’t really apply here. He doesn’t have to worry about them giving themselves away by not being careful, doesn’t have to stop himself from doing even simple things that he’d readily do when they’re alone. He still can’t quite wrap his brain around it.
By the time the case is over, Dean’s looking better than he had when they’d started. It’s not unusual for him to perk up at the prospect of heading home, but he’s also looking significantly more well-rested than he does after a long week of work. Castiel’s grown used to him shuffling to the car still haggard and gray, even the relief of a job well done not quite enough to cut through his exhausted prickliness.
“Hey,” Dean says, catching Cas by the arm before he can retreat, reeling him back in for a kiss he puts all his remaining energy into, trying his best to convey that Cas has absolutely nothing to be sorry for. “That was
Castiel smiles reassuringly. “So we’re doing interviews after all?”
His hand just barely slips beneath the worn fabric of Dean’s shirt, but he doesn’t follow through on the suggestion of undressing Dean. He just lets his palm rest there heavily, his grip on Dean’s hip sure and firm, fingers cool against Dean’s overheated skin. Dean’s properly hard now, and Cas’s thumb tracing aimless patterns so close to where his body is screaming for touch might actually do him in.
And Dean’s a little surprised by how he’s handling this too. He keeps reaching a point where he thinks it’s all too much, but then the pain shifts, transforms into something brighter and more enticing, something akin to bliss. He lets himself be driven a little higher, to some place beyond the physical sensation where he slips out of his head, his own pleas and whines sounding far away, writhing under Cas’s hands, twitching with each strike, and he absolutely
Cas dips down to kiss him and Dean smiles into it, hardly believing that this is his life, that he and Cas finally got here.
Cas leans back and just looks at him for a moment, intently drinking him in. Dean’s mostly used to being scrutinized like this by now, the fondness in Cas’s eyes, one wide palm carefully cradling Dean’s face, but it never fails to put an excited little flutter in his stomach. Dean leans into the touch and tries to pull Cas back down, but Cas obviously has other plans. He doesn’t budge an inch.

of them so long – but he’s certainly going to make up for that now.
He might feel different in the morning. The shame might find him then, when the endorphins and the afterglow are just a distant, happy memory. But he really hopes that moment never comes – he wants the inarguably good parts about how this feels to crowd out the bullshit like they’re supposed to.
Dean raises an eyebrow at him. “Is that what
“Well,” Scott says, suddenly even closer than he already was. “Maybe I can finally get a little time alone with you, then?” he asks, hopeful.
The thought of Cas saying that so casually, that smug son of a bitch, just gets Dean more and more agitated the longer he sits there and dwells on it.
good. “You can—” A whimper escapes him as he pushes into Cas’s hand, grinding his aching dick against the gratifyingly solid muscle of Cas’s leg. “Keep going.”
Cas smiles at him affectionately, eyes boring into Dean’s now that he’s gotten permission to stare. “That’s more like it.”
Castiel was too, but he’s suddenly in less of a hurry. He offers nothing but an unapologetic shrug in reply, reveling in the laugh that earns him, the conspiratorial smirk.
. And they always were, really, but the only way to make it by when he was younger was to dissociate from those labels completely, to carelessly deride them as if they didn’t apply to him.
, he can actually do that now. He stops walking abruptly, and Cas looks at him with curiosity until Dean winds his fingers in Cas’s jacket and starts to pull him closer. His face softens in understanding as he meets Dean halfway, reaching up to cup Dean’s face in his palm. The way Cas touches him is so confident and familiar, and Dean wonders exactly how long Cas has wanted to do this. He sighs happily when their lips meet, squeezing Cas’s hand in his, pleased when Cas immediately squeezes back.
“What was he doing here at that hour anyway?” Cas wonders aloud, crouching down to examine the paperweight.
, Dean,
Dean wonders if they could’ve spent a little longer teasing him open but the stretch is amazing, everything he’s craving right now. He feels so gloriously full, revels in the sensation of Cas deep inside him for a moment before he needs more. It takes a second to get the hang of it, a bit of maneuvering before he can get his knees solidly planted for leverage, Cas slipping even further down the seat, but then Dean starts to move, to bounce tentatively in Cas’s lap, working himself back and forth, groaning. He keeps it shallow at first, not much room to do more than that but it’s so good like this, circling his hips, looking for the right angle and oh,
as Cas all but herds him away. He distantly registers the sound of her heaving a sigh before heading into her apartment building.
He even goes so far as to outright refuse to go into the basement in case Cas is there, no matter how much Sam whines that he needs help moving some boxes.
Dean recognizes that tone – he knows Cas can get a bit gun shy after he lets his base instincts take over like that. Watching Cas in the mirror, he can almost pinpoint the moment some ugly feeling like guilt starts to seep in and put tension in his frame, making him pull away, and Dean’s gonna nip that backpedaling shit right in the bud, because Cas should never have to feel bad for rocking Dean’s world like that.
*   *   *
Despite his palpable reluctance, Dean lets his hand slip from Castiel’s grasp. Castiel already misses it terribly, but it’s a heady thrill to know that for once, this won’t be the only chance he has. He has a solid week of chances ahead of him, maybe more.
Dean sighs. “I mean, you saw how hard it was for me before. To
, desperate and hopeful, but Castiel doesn’t know what to do for him.
A few weeks later, Dean, Sam and Cas are just wrapping up a wendigo hunt in South Carolina when they catch wind of a possible case. There’ve been reports of a couple unexplained attacks in Missouri, one within the last few days, both localized in a town so small and so remote it barely registers on the map. There’s nothing in the brief article that sounds definitive or outwardly paranormal, so it could be a total bust, but it’s more or less on the way home, and as far as Dean’s concerned, that makes it worth the slight detour.
It’s not even rhetorical dirty talk coming from Cas, or at least it’s
makes it all worth it.
It’s almost like they’re back to square one, but now Dean knows, at least, that Cas has shed some of his guilt about his reactions and has no trouble giving in to those possessive urges when they do occur. It’s just harder for him to get to that point in the first place.
“Wow,” Charlie says as she puts the car in park, turning around to look at them. “You really did keep it PG. Are you even awake back there?”
Castiel would tell Dean that he’s close, but he’s well aware that Dean already knows, doesn’t even want to be thrown off his rhythm long enough for Castiel to warn him,
Castiel can see how needy Dean is for any kind of attention, always so physically affectionate with him and absolutely melting when Castiel reciprocates. Castiel again wonders how long Dean’s been craving that kind of tenderness – not just from anyone, but from Castiel in particular.
“Comin’ right up.” He’d make her any kind of damn breakfast she wants right now.
. It’s almost indescribable, the feeling of nearly unbearable fullness, stretched tight and making space for Cas. Letting him in – literally – in ways he never thought he could. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Or maybe it does, but he’s been worked into such a state that his brain’s going haywire and he doesn’t know pain from pleasure anymore. All he knows is a blinding intensity that he either wants to run away from or absolutely cannot get enough of.
“C’mon,” he pleads, kicking off his own sleep pants and rolling more fully onto his side, reaching back for Cas and dragging him closer. “Get— just like this.”
without the warmth of the sun or Cas’s embrace.
Christ, Cas was an animal. They both were.
Cas hardly blinks as Dean cleans his wound, though Dean’s sure it’s gotta hurt like a bitch. Dean wonders if he’s deliberately easing the pain away, if he’s trying to be
But Castiel can’t say that he’s much better off himself. Whatever had been building between them up until this point, Castiel has rapidly accelerated by inviting Dean into the shower with him. He’s not sure what he was expecting or hoping for at the time, though he was of course open to all possibilities; he just wanted to be closer to Dean. And he certainly accomplished that. It just seemed foolish to be in there by himself, thinking of nothing but Dean. He can’t think about much other than Dean right now either.
Cas picks up on his presence right away, locks eyes with him as he directs his horse in a wide loop, and even from this distance Dean can see a smirk on his face. Dean tightens his grip on the fence, already feeling a flush rising to his cheeks and hoping Cas doesn’t pick up on it. He looks on in veiled admiration; Dean’s okay with a horse, but he’s got nothing on Cas.
Then there’s one where they’re in an ancient villa, Dean reclining on a couch while Cas feeds him grapes and reads him love poetry. He’s almost embarrassed that he dreamed that up. What’s more embarrassing is that he
It’s like he stepped into a goddamn postcard.
Castiel doesn’t recall that being part of the rules, but he knows better than to try pointing that out to Dean when he’s in one of these moods.
. Christ, he really wants to go home. “Good for her.” He really, really means that. “Guess the aunt’s cool with everything, if she’s putting them up.”
“Can you keep looking through this then?”
The circumstances may change, the
“The entire world isn’t your responsibility, Dean,” Cas continues. “You’ve done more than anyone could ever ask of you. You deserve to rest,” he says with conviction. Then, more hesitantly, “If that’s what you want.”
.” He tries to keep his gaze fixed on Castiel even though he’s abruptly hurtling towards orgasm, holds it until the very last moment when he’s forced to squeeze his eyes shut, overcome. Dean would deny it if Castiel said it aloud, but he’s unfathomably beautiful in that moment, head thrown back, neck temptingly exposed, chest heaving.
shining in his eyes, looking, inexplicably, just as overwhelmed as Dean feels.
and he finds himself floundering for a second because he hasn’t really thought that part through. Maybe he should have done some research of his own.
Dean doesn’t quite register that he’s in front of a mirror until he starts to watch the path of Cas’s other hand as it trails up his torso, teasing a nipple through his shirt and eventually – almost too briefly – wrapping around Dean’s throat. He doesn’t apply any pressure, really, but just the image of it, the feeling of Cas’s strong fingers there, is a shock to Dean’s system, cock twitching and leaking in Cas’s grasp. Then Cas’s hand keeps going, and Dean instinctively wants to close his eyes against the sight of his own face streaked with come, but Cas obviously wants him to watch; he doesn’t command him out loud, but it’s implied well enough when Dean’s eyes start to slip closed and Cas nips the back of his neck to keep him focused, hard enough to leave a mark that Dean won’t really get to look at later—that one’s all for Cas. Dean shivers at the fervor in Cas’s gaze when they lock eyes in the mirror, that unspoken understanding that he wants Dean to see how good Cas gets him off, fingers gathering some of the mess smeared across Dean’s lips then shoving inside, pressing against Dean’s tongue.
“But you can’t wait any longer. Neither can I—I need to have you.” There’s the slightest waver in Cas’s voice there, a microscopic break in his composure, and if any part of this filthy diatribe was just a show for Dean’s benefit,
And of course, to top it all off, he has another goddamn dream.
of it all has him so wound up he’s about to burst, makes him come so hard and so fast that he doesn’t even think to be quiet about it, and if he weren’t already falling over the edge, the faintly smug look he catches on Cas’s face would absolutely have gotten him there.
After a few beats of silence, Dean clears his throat. “So,” he says vaguely, looking awkward.
Cas’s frown deepens. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he replies. Cas could legitimately be clueless here, but the more obvious sentiment is he just doesn’t give a fuck what Jones has to say.
Dean smiles to himself. “Damn.”
the way no one else could hope to be, enraptured by the sound of his gasps and helpless moans, reveling in the way he trembles and clings to Castiel as he loses himself to ecstasy. He eases Dean back down to earth with soothing words, gentle kisses on his cheek, completely at odds with the frantic energy still humming under his skin.
Even when Dean’s not going out of his way for the obvious joke – like referring to Castiel as
Dean’s startled into a laugh that echoes off the mountains, getting a double dose of joy because Cas always looks so damn pleased with himself for getting that reaction from Dean. He softens after a moment, turning to Cas with fond eyes. “Let’s go home.”
“I’m gonna run up the bill,” Dean threatens. He’s not technically agreeing, but judging by the victorious look on Charlie’s face, she gets the message. “Gonna order the most expensive shit they have and not even drink it, just to spite you.”
Dean hears the bitterness, the guilt in Cas’s tone clear as day, wants nothing more than to soothe his worries. “You didn’t,” he says, and that’s not a lie. Dean never once felt like Cas even came close to actually losing his grip on his power. Dean would probably be a pile of ash if that had happened. “You just got, uh… enthusiastic. And it was
"I can see that," Cas says dryly.
He’s lost track of how many times Dean has pulled him aside in the middle of the day and dragged him somewhere moderately private – maybe the backseat of the car, maybe a rest stop bathroom – like he couldn’t wait another second to get his mouth on Castiel. Perhaps the physical sensation appeals to Dean; he seems to crave oral stimulation, whether it’s this or Castiel’s fingers filling his mouth or Castiel’s lips against his own.
,” he mutters, scrubbing a hand over his face, “You knew all that stuff already, of
“So do you,” Castiel replies, because Dean deserves that compliment and many more besides. He leans in to get his mouth on Dean’s jaw, his neck, his collarbones. “You feel incredible. You
, for real this time.
But Dean’s relationship with Cas has always been… complicated. Too complicated, probably. Finding Cas distractingly hot just adds a new wrinkle that Dean is not at all prepared to deal with, no matter how convincingly he assures himself that it’s no big deal.
Cas seems to get it, luckily, smiling at Dean with fondness. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
Charlie snorts. “Well, duh. Did you see a
“Unless you’d prefer that I ask you to count?” Cas asks tentatively, feeling him out – it wouldn’t be the first time Dean had felt the urge for more direction, more
since Cas moved in.
It was only a matter of time before he found himself creeping around the gym again. It’s like he just can’t stay away this time around either, but everything about this situation feels completely different than before.
“Cas,” Dean whispers, swallowing visibly.
For a moment he worries that Dean will be annoyed by his… display, that later he’ll see the unsubtle evidence Castiel has left on his throat and be put off by Castiel’s behavior. But he only blushes and makes a teasing remark, obviously pleased – even a little smug? – as he inspects it in the mirror, touches it reverently, and doesn’t complain.
Things finally start to calm down after a while, once they’ve wrapped up a ghoul hunt in Oregon and have no new leads to speak of. Dean’s sure as hell ready to haul ass back to Lebanon, practically giddy as they pack up and hit the highway. He’s gonna try his damnedest to make a straight shot of it. They can take it in shifts, swapping out who gets the back seat to pass out for a while. Cas worries about Dean’s back when he spends a long time in the car just
Cas is often more sincere than anyone has a right to be (until he turns into a sarcastic little shit so fast it gives Dean whiplash) and, absurdly, Dean feels his face heat from the earnest gratitude. “Yeah, no problem,” he says, trying to sound flippant, but honestly, he’s glad Cas likes it. It’s the least Dean could do for him.
“Didn’t know you were into that kinda thing, Cas,” Dean sneers, and that might have been a cutting remark if he were speaking to literally anyone else, but Dean’s forgetting who he’s dealing with.
Even on that precarious precipice of orgasm he’s still polite enough to make sure, though he doesn’t
He hopes Cas understands, that he can see through Dean’s fumbling to hear what he’s really trying to say. By the look on Cas’s face, his smile affectionate, eyes impossibly fond, he gets it just fine. Dean’s so fucking crazy about him it’s honestly embarrassing.
He actually lets himself get lost in the fantasy of it as he wanders around the room, stealing glances, getting weirdly turned on by the idea of Cas in a position of power, even if it’s something as mundane as working in an office – not that Mr. Chapman was as much of a big shot as he probably wanted people to think, but Dean can pretend.
to hurry, but sometimes Dean most definitely wants to. Like right now, for example. Cas just feels too damn good to keep up with this slow, aimless pace forever.
has barely passed Dean’s lips before Cas raises his hand and brings it swiftly back down again. The sensation almost doesn’t register right away, Dean just as taken aback as last time by the
Dean turns onto his side to face Cas, licking his lips again, heart rate spiking. “Yeah,” he breathes. “Little bit.”
“You stayed this time,” Dean says, clearing his throat and looking more alert.
“You can stay,” Dean clarifies, visibly swallowing and betraying his apprehension, the tentative hope.
how he really feels. There’s always been that persistent little feeling in the pit of his stomach every time Cas touched him, smiled at him, said his name, saved his worthless ass for the hundredth time. It chipped away at Dean little by little, the disappointment akin to heartbreak every time Cas left, the utter joy and relief when he finally came back. And once Dean acknowledged how he felt, nurtured those emotions and let them grow, there was absolutely no getting away from them. Even he wasn’t good enough at denial to convince himself that all he wanted from Cas was platonic friendship.
“Any time, dude,” Charlie says, flashing the peace sign and exiting the room with a flourish.
Cas glances over when his opponent’s distracted, throws a fucking
?” he sputters indignantly when Cas drops that bit of information. “
Cas rises to his full height and steps closer. Dean’s almost weak at the knees over the way Cas looks right now, that soldier-of-god intensity in his eyes laser-focused on Dean. That sure takes him back. Cas used to scare him at first, as much as he tried not to let on, and he can still strike fear into the heart of anyone he chooses. Not Dean though. He’s seen Cas in a fit of rage and stopped him easily with just a word or a hand on his arm. Cas is a total softy when it comes to Dean, and that’s exactly what lets Dean do this, to hold still like cornered prey while Cas stalks toward him. Because whatever Cas has in mind for him, Dean knows everything’s fine, Cas has got him – and he’s gonna be
He spends a long time trying to convince himself that he’s being stupid for pining after something so sappy, but every time he looks at Cas, he realizes he’s only fighting the inevitable, that eventually his true desires are going to win out no matter how good he is at pushing them down. Being out here, isolated and liberated, it’s so much easier to face what he wants and go for it, to reach over those last few inches and take Cas’s hand. Cas already did this before, he figures. He’s just following a precedent.
Dean turns in Cas’s arms, enough to look at him over his shoulder. Dean searches his face for a moment, and finds nothing but sincerity. “You told me you needed better directions,” he admits, eyes flicking away guiltily. “I wasn’t on top of it.”
“Cool,” he says, voice tight. “Great. Then I’ll just—uh, go. And you, y’know have fun or—yeah. Later, man.”
Cas lets one hand sneak behind Dean and inch his jeans down just enough to give his ass a rough squeeze. Dean’s soft moan is muffled by their lips – he loves that confidence on Cas, the way his care and thoughtfulness don’t mean he’s any less passionate.
Dean’s sure that Cas picks up on what he’s trying to do; he sees an almost imperceptible flicker of recognition on Cas’s face. “You’ve earned any commendation I can give you. In fact,” Cas trails off, straightening up and closing the short distance between himself and Dean. “I think you deserve a reward,” he says, a slow smile forming on his face. “Don’t you?”
Dean clears his throat and Cas’s eyes lock onto his for a moment before languidly traveling along Dean’s body, and Dean swears he can almost feel Cas’s gaze like the physical touch he’s so needy for. He’s got Cas now, he’s almost
Cas plucks the cereal out of his hands and looks for himself. “Oh, isn’t that interesting,” he rumbles. Smug is a good look on Cas, and that’s incredibly unfair too. “We’re getting Sam the shredded wheat,” he announces. Dean’s definitely
“As long as I’ll have
, he thinks to himself over and over, at a loss for any other words, too raw and wrung out from overstimulation to talk about anything out loud either way. He’s only half-aware of Cas getting them cleaned up and coaxing Dean under the covers, melting further when Cas slips into bed behind him.
There’s something weirdly
“Oh,” he sighs as Cas continues, “Oh, god.” He can feel every goddamn millimeter as Cas steadily works his way forward – it’s both exquisite and excruciating and Dean’s nearly losing it already. “
Dean.
” Dean says, huffing out a laugh, embarrassed. “C’mon, Cas.”
“Both,” Dean says with a grin. “Fuck it, why not, right?” It’s new for him, feeling like… like it’s okay to want things, like Cas said, even something as frivolous as choosing couch time over his less pressing responsibilities, the stupid shit he denies himself because he thinks he’s supposed to.
He expects Cas to tease him a little bit like he does sometimes, to switch up his rhythm, pull back so far that Dean has to strain to wrap his lips around him at all before sliding deep again. Instead, he’s chasing his release with single-minded focus and thoroughly using Dean’s mouth to get there, and fuck if that doesn’t really do it for Dean too.
, he thinks, though he doesn’t say it out loud just then. But he intends to eventually, as often as Dean is willing to hear it. “Do I need more of a reason than that?”
“Dude,” Dean interjects, shifting Cas back and stepping out from between him and the table, breaking into the kind of giddy laugh he only ever allows himself when he’s half in the bag.
, as it turns out, open for Castiel’s exploration, sensitive to his touch – but Castiel still has so much to learn. He knows there’s a wealth of ways to get creative with this, things he hasn’t even begun to delve into or examine, and he can’t wait to find out what there is to offer, discover every possible way to bring Dean to ecstasy.
Dean turns back to face Cas, stomach doing somersaults, mind racing through a hundred possibilities of what Cas could have called him back to say.
did this. With Cas living in the bunker, slumming it like a human, Dean had almost forgotten what he was capable of, and this is how Cas chose to remind him. There are countless small but vital things that Cas decided were a waste of his power, but not this. Making a dramatic gesture for Dean… apparently, that’s worth it.
“Hunting buddy of mine,” Dean explains, trying to keep his voice neutral. “Scott. I think I’ve mentioned him to you before?” Dean knows damn well that he didn’t.
Cas has always encouraged Dean for doing as he asks, but he’s never really phrased it that way, like he’s commending Dean for his performance, never sounded so
Dean snorts again. “No you’re not.”
“We are,” Cas agrees, squeezing his hand, “Isn’t that extraordinary?”
But then there’s that smile again, and Castiel knows exactly what caused it this time. He can hear Dean’s soul singing to him, shining brighter than ever, and Castiel’s heart – his primitive, remarkable human heart – might actually burst through his chest as it fills with pride, with unfettered adoration for the man in front of him.
He’s appalled at himself the first time he thinks of it – taking the entirety of Cas’s hand – and he brushes the thought away almost the moment it occurs to him. Because that’s a crazy idea even for him, one of those unrealistic fantasies that he’d never
-Victorian sex on a canopied four-poster bed with bedding fancier than anything Dean would’ve thought his mind had a frame of reference for. He remembers Cas in a vest and a complicated tie that took entirely too long to get off, and that was as far as he got before Cas pushed him onto his back, peeled his clothes off and left him bare on the mattress. He wasted no time in spreading Dean’s legs wide, pressing them back towards his chest – Dean’s not nearly that flexible in real life – and taking Dean apart with his tongue.
He groans Cas’s name, and Cas answers with impassioned words of affection and praise, sentiments possessive,
Dean’s not too caught off guard to kiss back – uncertain, from what Castiel can tell, but evidently not repulsed – and the wave of relief, of
. Of course, most of those first encounters were also the last, not the start of something real. This could be the start of the rest of his life, maybe – hopefully – with someone he really cares about, and it’s hard to pass that up for a quick fumble in the shower, tempting as it is.
*   *   *
It’s not every time that they do that sort of thing. It’s often enough to be an indisputable part of their routine, but rare enough for Dean to privately think of it as
“Uh—” Dean says, awkwardly patting down his jacket. He’s not sure how long he just stood there staring, but it’s probably better if he doesn’t know. “Yeah, right here.”

pipes up in the back of his mind for just a second, but this isn’t anything like what that asshole was talking about. What goes on between him and Cas is so much more than whatever sick, twisted thing some ignorant piece of shit wants to make it out to be.
But Castiel doesn’t have the chance to investigate that before Dean returns to his task with renewed fervor, grinding against the bedding with less restraint.
, it seems, feeling his eyes sting and well up, droplets spilling down his cheeks.
Cas leans in, brushes his lips against Dean’s throat, and Dean has to stifle a giddy laugh at the tickling but thrilling sensation of Cas’s beard on his skin.
“God,” Dean breathes, somewhere near a laugh, scrubbing a hand over his face. He’s relieved on so many levels – that she’s safe, that she got out of this Podunk town, that there’s no case, that they get to go
Dean sighs
Dean licks his lips reflexively, and Cas may be in investigation mode, but he still lowers his eyes and tracks the motion. “I dunno,” Dean says, “Maybe. Maybe, uh— Maybe he just made a mistake. Or the lock’s broken.” He licks his lips again, slower and more deliberately this time, steadily training his gaze on Cas’s face. “Why don’t you make sure it works?”
When Dean finally pushes inside it’s a relief and
Dean snorts and rolls his eyes playfully. “Yeah, I’m a regular boy scout.”
Dean leans back against the side of his car, looking out over the lake one last time. He can recognize, even from a distance, the Douglas fir that he and Cas kissed under a few days ago. He smiles at the memory, but it’s almost bittersweet, because he can’t shake the lingering fear that this is the end, somehow. And to think it was

Dean’s doing his damnedest to keep up, and he’s embarrassingly close to the brink already, trying to keep the volume down because they’re in the damn
Dean when he can get away with it, when they have a benefit of a restaurant table or a crowd of people to obscure it – a firm squeeze on Dean’s hand or thigh that gets his hopes up for Cas to really lose his composure once they’re alone.
Cas frowns. “What’s going on?”
Dean wakes slowly, shifting around to find Castiel’s eyes. “Hey,” he says, voice and expression so soft that Castiel can’t quite believe what he’s seeing. That he’s
Sam snorts in agreement, amused. “Guess we’ll have to get a real explanation when we swing by his house later.”
He puts the car in park and twists around towards Cas, something wild beneath his skin, itching to get out. Cas furrows his brow inquisitively, betraying the confusion that he doesn’t get the chance to voice before Dean grabs his tie, yanking him forward for a kiss.
Castiel reverently divests Dean of his clothing, eyes roaming greedily over every newly-revealed inch of flesh. The sight of Dean bare and exquisite never fails to take his breath away. He sheds his own clothes when Dean plucks at them insistently, reveling in the sensation of Dean’s soft skin against his.
"Don't get used to it," Cas fires back, and it doesn't sound nearly as threatening as Dean suspects he intended.
Charlie shoots Dean a look over her shoulder as she approaches the door. “Okay, weirdo.”
“I think I do.”
“That’s it, Dean,” Cas rumbles silkily, cradling Dean’s face in one palm, digging his fingers into Dean’s ass to spur him on. “Let me see you.” Cas has barely said a word this morning beyond whispered praise, his deep, deep voice almost startling in its sudden clarity. Cas’s air of indolent hedonism has given way to a stark sort of intensity, a bit of a commanding edge to his voice, anxious for Dean to get his now too, greedy for it.
Castiel furrows his brow and waits for Dean to continue, feeling lost when he has nothing to add. “What?”
The praise his Dean like a ton of bricks. His stomach flips, jarring but not unpleasant, and he lets a choked sound escape his throat, helpless to stop it with how exhausted he is. No one but Cas has ever called him
Dean forces a nervous chuckle. “All of it?” he says, feigning uncertainty as if he’s not so completely, agonizingly sure about what he wants.
Later, after Cas has conked out curled around him, Dean lies awake for a while, a strange mixture of satisfaction and lingering unease churning in his stomach. He cuddles closer to Cas, willing his racing mind to settle, thankful for Cas in his bed, disappointed in the world, hoping it all makes more sense tomorrow.
Castiel hates to wake him, but he knows Dean can’t stay in this awkward position for long without creating discomfort later on. Not that Castiel couldn’t fix that easily—though maybe that’s a selfish thought more than anything else. Surely Dean wouldn’t want Castiel to leave him this way. Right?
They can admire the bruises together now, and Castiel pays them special attention, shifts down the bed and kisses each one with reverence, even as he presses with his fingers just to see Dean flush and squirm. Castiel fits his mouth over the lowest one, a red splotch on Dean’s thigh, delighting in the way Dean’s breath catches, and works his way back up, kisses Dean again, takes his hands and kisses each wrist in turn too.
Cas rests both hands on Dean’s hips, gripping tight, fitting their bodies more closely together. Dean’s already shamelessly turned on, loving the feeling of Cas taking control, the way he maneuvers Dean how he pleases. He sighs happily, giving into Cas’s ministrations, as if he’d ever resist, as if he hadn’t started this whole thing, so fucking easy for Cas that just looking at him still drives him crazy with want. He tips his head back onto Cas’s shoulder as Cas slides his hands around, smoothing over his stomach, up towards his chest in one long, luxurious caress. His fingers linger to fleetingly tease at Dean’s nipples through his shirt, just a hint of a pinch through the fabric before slipping back down again, but more than enough to get Dean panting for it like always.
Castiel’s breath hitches at the admission, moved by Dean being so open with him, in feeling
is stronger. Castiel simply can’t resist any longer. It’s nothing short of a miracle that he’s managed to hold himself back until now.
Dean snorts at Charlie’s response, staving off the prickle of emotion he can feel behind his eyes.
Life without hunting used to be this faceless uncertainty, and he had no idea of what that would be other than a jarring absence of everything he’s been forced to build his life around. But he knows now: it’d be something just like this, and that doesn’t seem so terrifying at all.

He’s had a reputation for causing awkwardness in the past, but he’s never felt it so keenly before and it is
“Awww, anytime, buddy,” Charlie says cheesily, knowing exactly when it’s time to lighten things up. “What are friends for?”
Dean finally spots him staring, apparently catches on to Castiel’s not-so-subtle implication that Dean is the view that Castiel finds the most inspiring. “Oh my god,” he mutters, aiming for exasperated, as if that covers up for the way his cheeks are quickly turning pink. Castiel’s growing to enjoy the fact that he can make Dean blush.
“It’s beautiful here,” Cas remarks eventually. Dean can tell it’s not an idle comment or shallow small talk; he can hear the genuine awe and appreciation in Cas’s voice.
He’s perfectly content with Dean’s mouth for the moment, kissing him slow but heated. That elicits a gratifying hum of contentment from Dean, and Castiel answers with one of his own as Dean’s hands grip his shoulders, stroke down his back. Kissing Dean is always as relaxing as it is very much the opposite – his body warm and inviting, equally calming and tantalizing. It would be so easy for Castiel to lose himself in this, but he’s determined to stay focused.
Cas has Dean boxed in with his muscular arms, huge and solid on either side of Dean’s head. Dean knows that Cas doesn’t really get his strength from his physique but it’s still damn nice to look at, nice to

Cas makes a moves to touch him but Dean stays his hand. Cas looks up at him, concerned, but Dean manages to grind out, “Just like that, I’m—” trailing off into a whine.
The heated look on Cas’s face softens, and he sits up and pulls Dean into a fierce kiss, wrapping him in a tight embrace. He pulls back and rests one hand against Dean’s cheek, eyes boring into Dean’s. “Easy, gorgeous,” he murmurs, coaxing Dean into a more languid rhythm. “You made your point.”
Then Cas’s hand is on him, swiftly driving him to the brink and easing off only to start the process again – then again and
Cas raises his eyebrows, lips quirking up on one side.
Dean not to trust this, to not believe that Castiel could possibly mean what, frankly, seems obvious. It’s no surprise that Dean remains guarded, closed-off, even as he leans into Castiel’s touch, fingers brushing his cheek, too skeptical to put faith in it but too starved for affection to turn it down.
Cas pulls away and flops onto his back, not that he gets very far with his arm still pinned beneath Dean’s head. “Sorry,” he mutters, clearly awake now, scrubbing a hand across his face.
Dean slows down and eventually holds still, angling his head just so and gazing up imploringly at Cas, grasping the back of his thighs and encouraging him to move. Dean’s the one who moans indecently when Cas takes the hint, smoothly thrusting into Dean’s mouth at whatever pace
Dean stews for a second before getting up to unceremoniously dump his dishes in the sink.
, there, but he’s instantly lost in the thought that someone else, someone standing right next to him, might be angling for a piece of him later. He’s entranced by the intensity on Cas’s face, not certain what exactly he’s seeing but almost squirming with the possibilities in an undeniably pleasant way, a far cry from how fidgety he was before, being blatantly flirted with by someone he just met.
Bringing it up to Cas is another matter altogether. After making such progress in admitting to himself what he really wants, that’s where he finds everything grinding to a halt. It’s not just summoning up the nerve to discuss it – though that’s a big stumbling block, for sure – but he’s literally not even sure how to go about explaining it.
Cas usually relents here, but Dean notices the determination on his face. “If you want it,” Cas says, carefully at first, as if unsure, then gaining confidence, “Then you can ask for it.”
“Cas, please,” he continues. It’s easier to freely ask for it when he’s still half-drowsy from sleep and dazed from arousal. He knows he’ll be mortified later but for now all he wants is for Cas to fucking
person that attacked him?” he asks, determined to sound calm and businesslike. If they’re going to declare this a ghost sighting they need a bit more to go on than ‘pale and mysterious.’
he is not complaining. “God damn, Cas.”
Dean should have expected the question, really, but he fumbles for a response. “No, uh—” he attempts, suddenly very interested in a loose thread on the handle of his bag. “Sitting this one out,” he finally manages to explain. “Just you and me.” Just hearing himself say it out loud gets his heart beating a little faster.
Dean smiles dazedly, closing his eyes, meeting Cas’s movements halfway. He turns his face towards Cas’s where it’s hooked over his shoulder, nuzzles at his stubbled cheek. “That feel good, Cas?” he asks, words slurred with arousal.
. Before Dean can respond, he gets another message.
Cas seems to agree, cupping Dean’s jaw as they both lean forward again eagerly. Dean notices with surprise and exhilaration that they’re starting with a lot more tongue than they usually do, but
“Yeah,” Dean agrees dazedly, swaying closer to Cas, before he clarifies, “Well, no, not exactly. Had ‘em for a while now.” Cas furrows his brow slightly, looking for more explanation. “I, uh. I like to put ‘em on sometimes,” Dean admits in a rush, pleased that his voice comes out steady.
Sam finally spares him a glance. “Okay,” he says slowly, expression wary. “Can you be more specific?”
Charlie perks up even more at that suggestion. “I was hoping you’d say that.”
Cas kisses him only briefly, and it feels like a reward just as much as an unbearable tease. Dean wonders if Cas is… testing him, somehow. If that’s the case, Dean definitely wants to pass. He goes pliant for Cas, relaxing into the sheets, waiting for Cas’s next move. Letting go completely feels so good it’s almost indescribable, trusting Cas enough to hand him the reins. When they kiss again, Dean readily parts his lips for Cas’s tongue, takes everything he offers but doesn’t do anything Cas hasn’t told him to do.
“Love you so much,” Dean whispers in a rush, not to get it over with, but because he needs to say it as soon as fucking possible, can’t delay one second in reminding Cas how he feels.
. “Cas,” he says plaintively. “Get over here. Please?” He chokes on a moan, already reduced to begging. “
, Dean thinks, throat tight,
Dean’s almost relieved, then immediately on edge – in a good way – once they’re alone again, a pleasant tension settling in his body as he turns back to Cas. “You hear that, Cas?” he asks, teasing smirk on his face. “She likes my smile.” It’s still a thrill that he doesn’t have to pretend anymore, that he can openly call attention to these situations, and how Cas usually reacts to them. He can be as obnoxious about it as he wants.
Really, Cas just isn’t that guy. Whatever envy he might be experiencing isn’t an ugly thing he uses to hurt Dean or control him or treat him like an object. He’s apparently just motivated to… stake his claim.
“I—uh,” Dean starts to explain, squirming with embarrassment in a way that Castiel finds terribly charming. “I didn’t pack a suit.”
“Oh,” she replies, a bit thrown off. She seems to recover quickly, though, a hint of optimism returning to her eyes. “Well, maybe if you’re ever in the area again?”
Dean barely has time to wonder about the possible double meaning of those words before he feels Cas’s lips on the back of his neck, hand slipping low, towards the hem of Dean’s shirt.
Dean shouldn’t be so excited by what just happened, what he’s seeing right now, but there it is, right in front of him: Cas’s clenched jaw, the sharpness coloring his words, the almost predatory look in his eyes. That’s the spark Dean’s been looking for, the hint of danger that Cas carries so well. It’s still there.
, c’mon.”
There’s a split second where it seems that Dean doesn’t know what he’s asking, then an inscrutable look manifests on his face when it dawns on him.
“Take off your clothes.”
Castiel can’t deny that he has similar feelings. It was
Dean’s spread out on the mattress and inching his boxers down before he even thinks about it, arousal coiling tight in his belly at the sense memory of Cas’s huge hands spreading him wide. Dean doesn’t waste any time, teases his cock it until it’s drooling onto his fingertips and he’s arching his back, thrusting into his own touch.
“Fuck me,” Dean bites out, a frisson shooting through him as he gives in and says it. Cas finally draws his cock out, looking
Cas looks Dean over – Dean tracks the movement of Cas’s eyes, glancing down at his own body, taken back by what a
Dean’s eyes widen, darting between Jones’ prone figure and Cas’s clenched hand. That wasn’t the outcome he’d been hoping for but he can’t lie, it’s kind of hot to see Cas looking all wrathful on his behalf, radiating righteous fury, bicep still flexed. He sucks in a breath. “Holy shit.”
Immediately Cas’s strong fingers are raking through Dean’s hair and massaging his scalp, and Dean almost melts on the spot.
And Dean can’t ignore that he’s exhausted either way, has been working hard for weeks now, unable to really relax. He feels his eyelids drooping, lulled by the warmth of Cas’s palm on his cheek, his gentle breathing, his steady gaze meeting Dean’s until they both drift off.
…Not that he hasn’t
Dean’s quick to unbuckle and inch his zipper down, shoving his open fly and his underwear out of the way so his dick’s hanging obscenely out of his pants. He should be mortified, exposing himself for Cas’s scrutiny like this, but Cas’s face isn’t judgmental, just gratified and
Only the lightest pressure of Cas’s hand on his shoulder has Dean falling to his knees, feeling surprisingly at home on a bathroom floor, between a wall and Cas’s solid body.
He clears his throat, looking away to pack up the first aid kit. “You should probably take that bandage off tomorrow.”
he’s so exquisitely gorgeous. Castiel smiles back and brushes the sweat-damp hair off of Dean’s forehead, overwhelmed by that heady combination of arousal and affection that never fails to make his heart pound. “Okay?” he asks, trailing his fingers down to cup Dean’s cheek.
Cas hums noncommittally but doesn’t follow up. “Are you hungry?” he asks instead, and Dean can’t help but be relieved that he’s dropped the subject.
Dean is so, so screwed. This can’t be normal. Not the dream part anyway. He’s already admitted to some attraction on his part, but this goes so far beyond that and—
“You know I did,” Cas says fondly, rolling his eyes. “I still do.”
, needing only the barest touch of Cas’s hand before spilling over his fingers. Dean moans shamelessly and Cas does too, pleasure probably reignited by the sensation of Dean squeezing tight around him, still thrusting languidly and riding it out.
Dean can't imagine getting shipwrecked with worse fucking company.
him; Dean wasn’t lying when he said it’s never been like this, being with someone he cares about as much as Cas, but also someone as dedicated to making it good for Dean, putting him first. Dean’s not really used to that, but he’s not complaining. For once, he’s not going to fight something that feels right, just for the sake of principles or appearances. It’s liberating to know that he can let go and have Cas take the reins. Cas doesn’t expect him to be a certain way, won’t judge him for the things he wants.
she is. It’s not like she’s gonna get a piece of this,” he teases, gesturing to himself, waggling his eyebrows obnoxiously.
of it, immediately punctuated by his own startled, breathy moan. Cas wastes no time in following up with another sharp smack to the other cheek, and Dean muffles a moan and a curse against the bedspread.
, that glorious, overwhelming tension that’s been building in Castiel’s stomach finally snapping.
Whatever few honest-to-god morning afters Dean’s had were nothing like this, an almost shy smile on his face instead of a cocky smirk, wrestling with the urge to get closer, closer,
Cas just barely narrows his eyes, the smirk creeping back onto his face, and that’s the only warning Dean gets before the hand on Dean’s ass come down in a firm swat. It’s nothing hard enough to hurt – not that that would
“Dean, I’ve fallen for you so many times now that I couldn’t possibly keep track. But if you want to know when it started, then… I’d have to say that even when I pulled you from Hell, I felt something. But I didn’t understand it then. I didn’t know what it would turn into.”
Cas only gives him a moment before determinedly chasing his own orgasm, both hands on Dean’s hips, rocking against him, pulling him backward with each forward hitch.  Dean has to slap a palm against the window for purchase, reaching back with the other hand to tangle it in Cas’s hair. “Yeah, Cas,” Dean hisses as Cas stifles a groan against Dean’s shoulder, the press of teeth sharp even through the fabric of his shirt. “Yeah, c’mon.”
That’s just how he operates. He’s plenty enthusiastic about trying new things with Dean, for sure, and he isn’t shy about showing it. But he’s also too level-headed to jump into anything without thinking about it, doing whatever research he needed to be satisfied – Dean can’t even imagine what that might’ve entailed in this case – and forming a plan to run by Dean beforehand. There might be some times when Dean questions Cas’s excessive preparedness, but this is definitely not one of them.
This is for the best, he decides—no matter how it tugs at his heart—as he braces himself for flight and disappears.
“How so?”
He’s briefly disappointed when Cas eases his hand back just before Dean’s orgasm hits him, but with the way Dean’s hips lift off the bed, even with Cas trying to hold him still, it’s probably safer that Cas only has three fingers in him now, curling just so – and then he’s coming too hard to really care, snaking a hand beneath his body to stroke himself through it. He may not be as full right now, but he can still
"This wouldn't have happened if you knew how to steer a fucking ship," Dean grouses as he slogs to shore, making a vain attempt to wring out his sodden shirt, shaking the sea water from his hair.
For a minute Dean had forgotten about anything outside of the two of them, but that bubble’s undeniably been burst now, and they exchange a brief glance before going to the door and unlocking it.
and not letting up with the pressure, leaves Dean moaning brokenly and arching off the bed.  Dean scrambles to get Cas’s belt undone, unzips his pants and inches them down just enough to get a hand around him and slick him up. Dean fucking loves the way he feels throbbing against his palm, Cas is so
“Yeah,” Cas murmurs, eyes hooded, “Show me what you can do.”
, more powerful than any of them by miles. He could easily lift Dean off the ground like he weighs absolutely nothing, hold Dean up against the wall while he fucks him without even breaking a sweat. And Cas isn’t a possible liability like some random dude at a bar—Dean can actually let his guard down and really put himself into Cas’s hands. Cas might be able to throw him around and then some but he’d never
Dean swears as his own project starts to list to the side again, eyes Cas's perfectly upright structure in his peripheral vision. "Can't get my walls to stand up for shit," he grumbles aloud.
“What?” Dean asks, his chest tightening at Cas’s stern tone. Shit, Dean went out on a limb even bringing it up, suggesting that they put it behind them, swallowing his hurt feelings and embarrassment enough to manage giving Cas a call.
