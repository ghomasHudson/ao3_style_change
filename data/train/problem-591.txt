turns his head to read what's on Tristram's cast, too, although certainly he's seen it before. "Angelo's," he says with a smile that seems to encourage Tristram to speak. "What's that?"
Sherlock looked at him in surprise. "Today's- But we've only just had the assembly, today's paper came out hours ago."

"What about you two, then?" Daisy said brightly, startling Sherlock out of his observation of John's throat as he swallowed. The creases in his skin, the soft flap of his earlobe. "I hear you people can get married now," she said.
John hates himself a little that he is torn over whether to do so, although it's not clear which urge is more repugnant at the moment: to trot after Sherlock like some lap dog or to abandon him to a possibly dangerous situation when he is still clearly unwell.
Emily doesn't even appear to hear him. "Are you and Sherlock getting divorced now?" she continues addressing Irene. It sounds more like a strong recommendation than a question.
&&&&&&
Sherlock smirked. "I'm not sure if they got quite that far before the leg gave way."
Sherlock bottomed out, allowed his hipbones just to kiss John's buttocks, before pulling back again at the same measured pace. In ... out ... forward ... back ... Never fully disengaging, always making sure to leave the entire flared head safely inside John's passage. It was a delicate balance. The wet sound of the slicked-up condom passing through the tight ring of John's hole was a sussurus of pleasure. Sherlock adjusted his grip on John's hips, used his thumbs to nudge John's buttocks further apart as he moved forward, then press them together when he retreated, prolonging the contact between their most intimate parts.
That got another twitch of the lips in acknowledgment. "I've been asking around. No one at the studio seems to know anything. Any idea why that might be?"
Sherlock took it out and tossed it at John. As if he needed to prove anything.
The problem was, Sherlock had mentally prepared himself not to see John any more. Seeing him again now was like a diabetic being told he had been misdiagnosed and could have all the sweets he wanted. He was afraid of bingeing, of losing control. He'd already lost control, if he was honest with himself. Over his emotions, at least. He'd take the weekend to sort things out, decide what he was going to do. He only needed to make it through to the end of the day.
"A mere formality, nothing more," he assured me, but where he had lifted his chin I could see his pulse beating rapidly in the hidden hollow beneath his jaw, belying the detachedness of his words.
"Cool!" Emily exclaims. She's grinning at her key chain too, and for a moment Tristram feels an odd almost-jealousy that Emily also has a picture of Father to carry around with her. But then she tilts her key chain toward Tristram, and he sees that it's the picture of her own father from the photo booth. "And look, there's me on the back," Emily says and shows him. She leans in a bit more so she can see Tristram's key chain. He obliges and turns it over so she can see the other side too. She laughs. "Your and Sherlock's hair is both sticking out the same."
And then they had rum cake with real rum - and whipped cream, come to think of it, just like the vermicelles - and Mrs Hudson made them listen to one of her vinyl records with some man singing Christmas songs in a funny, wobbly voice. Then they were released to go back to their own flat. The box with the bow was deposited on the coffee table and never opened. Father continued to play with his old, wonky bow.
"I'm not entirely certain which definition of 'fine' you're availing yourself of," Uncle Mycroft says coolly.
"Yes what?"
What if he's just playing a part now? Tristram doesn't think he's pretending to be John's boyfriend for a case; the way he and John were looking at each other in that one picture, the genuine pleasure and happiness in his voice when he and John really get talking, the fact that he invited John and Emily into their home and took them to meet Grandmother ... no, that's not fake. But maybe he's doing it for John. Maybe he's acting the way he thinks John's boyfriend should act because he wants to be that person. But can he keep that up forever? What will happen when he wants his old hairstyle and clothes back, figuratively speaking? Tristram gets an unpleasant chill in the pit of his stomach at the thought. Because he doesn't want to go back to life without John and Emily.
John paused, holding the cover up. "There wasn't anything in the water. Other than your usual heavy metals and other unsavouries." He dropped the cover down over both of them. "Do I want to know what you put in my water?"
"Brilliant," Victor said, stowing his phone somewhere in the voluminous folds of his surplice. "You know, I'm sorry things didn't work out for us to meet." Victor reached down to the desk and clicked the mouse. He raised his eyes to give Sherlock a knowing look. "You didn't really mix up the dates, did you?"
Even though Tristram has no idea what they're laughing about, he's so happy that he starts laughing too. He looks over at Emily, who has also collapsed in sympathetic giggles. It's a glorious moment.
"What about the nightmares then? You said you could tell I had nightmares." The man seemed downright eager to hear more.
It had been interesting enough for him to repeat the experiment another day, without the artificial stimulants. He hadn't managed to hit his prostate that first time, so he made a concerted effort to do so on the follow-up. It made the whole thing justifiable as a scientific endeavour. It had been physically pleasurable, the orgasm even stronger than the wedding night, but had left him feeling vaguely hollow. Not the sensation of emptiness when he'd pulled his fingers out, leaving his hole twitching vainly around nothing, but the space beside him, under him, over him, inside his heart, for want of a better metaphor, where no one was.
"Yeah," John assures her. "He's fine and he'll be back before you know it."
This chapter contains potentially traumatic scenes involving violent injury to a minor. Medi-picking by ladyprydian and thissalsify.
"One of each then," John said gamely, peeling away the plastic wrap so he could cut a generous slice of the fruitcake while Mrs Holmes took out some Tupperware.
"I'm sure it's fine. Sorry for all the trouble. Thank you." She picked up the bag, but paused before going back to the bathroom to complete the ruse. There was something off about him, but he wasn't staring at her. He wasn't particularly avoiding looking at her either. He didn't seem all that occupied with her at all, to tell the truth. Maybe something had happened while he was out. "Is everything all right?"
Thanks once again to ladyprydian and thissalsify for invaluable medical advice. This chapter should be less traumatic than the preceding ones, but does contain some description of injuries and medical procedures.
Tristram wisely doesn't answer that. Instead, he asks, "Is that what you were talking about with him after school yesterday?"
"Yeah, erm... God, okay, but have you..." John takes half a step back to give Sherlock more room to work with and swallows heavily. "Sherlock, it's not something..." They go in for another long kiss, but when Sherlock starts unbuttoning John's shirt, John angles his head down so that Sherlock can't reach his lips easily for a moment. He clears his throat but keeps his eyes closed. "Have you ever done that before?" he asks.
He had either foregone his omega perfume for the visit or washed quite thoroughly before coming back out, as I could not detect a trace of it this time. His smoky alpha scent was so welcome and appealing that I found myself drawing my chair in and leaning quite blatantly over the table in order to get closer to its source. It did not excite my sensibilities the way a ripe omega's scent might, but I imagined it would be quite satisfactory to get my nose pressed right up against the bonding ridge at the base of his neck whilst he dragged his fingers over my back and sides, probing my bruises and pressing his thumbs into the hollows of my reddened armpits.
A soft knock at the door informed me that one of them had arrived. I liked to make a game of deducing what I could before opening the door. It was a stranger, clearly. I knew the knocks of all of my regular visitors, and someone who had been here even once before would not be so hesitant, as if unsure of the reaction of the home's inhabitant to their interruption. A man, to judge by the double-rap (women tended to rap three times or more) of average height (from the position of the contact), and using a cane (the tap of its metal tip against the stone step), which indicated additionally that he was either of advanced years or suffering from a debility. The topic would be a personal problem, nothing of a criminal nature, or if it were, something that he was embarrassed to take to the local constabulary. It was pressing enough to seek me out this early, but not so urgent that he had lost his composure. It was enough to start with, and I went to the door prepared to impress my visitor and gather more clues from his appearance, accent, attire, comportment, and any of the hundred other seemingly insignificant details that led me to my conclusions. As soon as I opened the door, however, all thoughts of clues and deductions flew from my mind as I was faced with the very last person I had ever expected to see here.
John smirks, his hands grasping the armrests of his chair the only outward sign of his agitation. "Why? Does sex alarm you?"
"I didn't mean to-" Tristram blurts out. "I didn't-" He shakes his head. He clutches at the hard plastic seat of the chair. It's smooth, and warm, and slightly tacky; Tristram wonders if that's from the plastic itself or from his fingers. He could wash one hand and not the other and try touching it ag-
Lestrade's mouth hung loosely open. "Fuck me."
Tristram understands why: he knows that all of their adults - their fathers, Emily's aunts, and Tristram's uncle - are worried about someone taking them again (and, unspoken, that Tristram at least cannot be trusted to follow simple instructions). And - something else that no one has said anything to him about, but that he knows is true - the really bad guy, the bogeyman, the one who made Emily's Aunt Claire do what she did, and had her killed after, is still out there.
He gropes his way slowly to the window and pulls back the curtain. This room looks out on the side of the house, where there's nothing but some trees and a gravel path leading to the garden in the back. It's a relief for his eyes to have something to focus on, even if it is only the black shapes of the trees and the lighter grey of the path. Maybe he will see a fox or a badger. He knows there are some on the grounds, or at least used to be; his father took him out early one morning when they were here in the summer and pointed out the droppings and tracks they'd left during the night.
Somewhere overlaying the all-consuming heat and urgency, the wonder and gladness, a thought fluttered its wings, begging attention: this was going too fast. Sherlock was-- He hadn't showered, they had no supplies. He actually needed to empty his bladder rather desperately. More importantly, he hadn't had time to properly process it all, and neither had John. It felt as if they were on a train barrelling toward the station with no time to admire the view. It wasn't that he felt they should take things slow, exactly. But neither of them had slept well, John was hungover and not at his peak in terms of performance. That wasn't something that necessarily bothered Sherlock, but he felt certain John would want to make a -- to put it crassly -- good impression for the first time they shared this together. And it did look very much as if the station they were headed towards involved at least one of them blowing their whistle in the next few minutes.
&&&&&&
John looked up. "They're unread," he confirmed. Sherlock huffed. Of course they were. Did anyone honestly think he would have ignored a direct question about the children's whereabouts?
"I can take the kids out if you want to meet with her," Doctor Watson says.
"What do you mean?"
It was insufferable that he'd been stuck up at the front table with the rest of the wedding party for the entirety of the dinner service, including dessert, while John sat at one of the other tables with a bunch of strangers. It was a small wedding, only about thirty guests, but Sherlock hardly knew anyone, aside from Molly's mother and sister and the five other men who had been at the stag night. Greg's father was frail, so he and Mrs Lestrade had only stayed for the tea. Sherlock had assumed the duty of driving them back to the train station, which meant he hadn't even been able to mingle with John during the break between tea and dinner.
Sherlock snorts and logs off his computer. John drops wearily onto the armchair facing him.
"I don't much like repeating myself," Sherlock says curtly, peeling his socks off as well and tossing them into the bottom of the closet. This time he meets John's eye.
Sherlock immediately tested the setup by gingerly sliding his feet down. The chain lifted his cock and dragged his nipples down nicely. Sherlock gasped, his mouth dropping open and his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling, already beginning to retreat. John's own cock pulsed and he felt dampness seeping out. Sherlock started rocking ever so slightly back and forth, dragging the chain minutely across his frenulum and stretching his nipples so far John thought it must be bordering on painful, if not already past the point. He was already breathing hard again, the dark blue sheet under him darker still with his sweat in spots.
"Yeah, thanks. We're actually here on a case. Sherlock's a consulting detective now."
John grinned at Sherlock, standing beside him at the railing overlooking the ice rink. "You're just making it up now."
"We should wait until everyone else has debarked," Father says. He's texting something as he speaks.
. Tristram can tell it's both to distract them from Father's continued absence and to give Father just a little longer before John has to admit he's not coming back that night. Tristram dares to snuggle in against John just a little bit, and is rewarded by a squeeze and the rub of John's thumb on his shoulder. It makes him feel traitorously content, with Father still out there talking to those bad people. Hopefully just talking. Tristram turns that thought off and concentrates on the Harry's first task with the golden egg instead.
At the same time, there was certainly no way he was going to suffer through an hour (although Sherlock thought he could whittle it down to half that or even less if he was insufferable enough) of small talk at a chain coffee shop so that Victor could feel smug and self-satisfied over his good fortune and wise foresight of having rid himself of the likes of Sherlock Holmes.
"Walnut oil. And lime."
John looked surprised but didn't contradict him. "No, yeah, fine, that's... You don't have to..."
"Yeah," John agreed, meeting Sherlock's gaze, his smile broadening. "Yeah, I think so."
Inexplicably, he'd presumed Sherlock's injury was small and discrete, like the round scar of his own entry wound (the exit wound was another story, but Mary's bullet had stayed inside Sherlock, so the bulk of his damage wouldn't show). Also, Sherlock had gone to great lengths to establish Mary's skill and precision with a firearm, further feeding John's fantasy that the trauma was minimal. And perhaps it had been, on the outside, but any trace of the original site of entry has been entirely obscured by the long, puffy scar running the length of Sherlock's sternum and halfway to his navel. Because of course the doctors who treated him didn't have time to be neat. They'd had to open him up the quickest way they could, they'd had to dig around to get at the bullet, and they'd had to manually re-start his heart.
one of the scenarios we discussed," he shoots back. "I thought, afterwards, when she sent me that text, that you and she had arranged it that way."
Tristram giggles because Emily does look very silly. He can't imagine her Aunt Harry acting like that, but then he's only seen her twice.
"'m sorry." Emily, suddenly contrite, buries her face in his stomach.
"Technically, he didn't. It wasn't him at all, it was a hired gunman, and he wasn't even aiming for Tristram, we've been over this--"
"No," John says firmly. "I think we've broken enough laws tonight."
Grate and add the ginger. Add the lemon grass. Continue cooking for 5 minutes.
Another long pause. Then: "No experiment can ever really be a failure, even if it doesn't deliver the expected results."
By the time John's lease expired, it was well understood without any discussion that he would be moving into Sherlock's house. On the day, however, there somehow ended up being more boxes and bags than anticipated, and although Sherlock was elbow-deep in an interesting case, he found himself helping carry things in from Stamford's car.
"Excellent." He pushed the 'send' button and headed for the door, confident that his request would receive a positive answer. "It's a bit of a walk, but it would likely take just as long to find a cab in this area. Leg looks good, by the way."
Doctor Watson says he needs to get out, even though it's raining and so cold you can see your breath, so they all bundle up against the weather and go to the playground in Regent's Park. On top of the rain, it's Sunday, and barely eight o'clock, so there's no one there aside from a couple of hardy dog walkers passing briskly by with their heads down and their collars turned up. Mrs Hudson used to take Tristram to the playground a lot when he was little, but there's something awkward and lonely about going to the park at his age without another child to play with, so they haven't been in a long time. In fact, it's been so long that he's interested to see it's been completely refurbished, with new climbing frames and landscapes.
"Where's your what?" Sherlock asked irritably. John really was taking his time with those trees!
---ooo---
Sherlock's parents had invited them to come down next weekend. Some county show thing. They had a whole itinerary planned, apparently. It would involve staying overnight if they did everything, the petting zoo and the rides and the re-enactment and dinner and the concert. They didn't have to, of course, but Vi had assured them it wouldn't be a problem. They'd watch Rosie when she got tired so John and Sherlock could enjoy themselves. Sleeping arrangements weren't mentioned, but John had a feeling. They thought he and Sherlock were together. Together-together.
"Oh God, oh my God," John wheezes when he can finally catch a breath. "Ground rules. When we are in bed together, never, ever mention your brother."
"It doesn't matter," Tristram mumbles.
"You don't have to," Tristram allows, even as he slides back onto the bed to make room. "Not if you're busy."
As they clatter down the stairs, Tristram's heart leaps at the sight of his father's lean figure standing in the entryway with Doctor Watson.
On the one hand, it softens the shock, in a way, because it means that his father wasn't trying to hide something from him; Tristram was simply unobservant. He's certain that if his father really wanted to keep his relationship with Doctor Watson a secret, then no one would know about it. And they certainly wouldn't have brought him and Emily along this weekend.
Sherlock snorted. "Lestrade won't remember any of this tomorrow."
250g self-raising flour
"Yes, fine," Sherlock said, not really paying attention. The bell rang then anyway, and it was time to go to the classroom.
"If you're not SassyFox then you must be DontBeBoring," John surmised from the latest results screen.
Holmes froze, momentarily derailed, but no more than a second later I was fairly able to discern the moment in which he became aware of the nature of his situation.
Instead, Father says: "Do you think you could fall asleep here on the couch? I'll be working at my desk or in the kitchen."
Tristram's a little bit - just a tiny bit - disappointed that he's the only one who's not in any of the pictures on John's key chain. But there wouldn't be any room for another picture anyway. And he doesn't have John or Emily on his, and Emily doesn't have him or Father on hers. So somehow it all evens out. Still, he's left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction despite the fact that he likes his key chain very much.
"Swimmingly," Sherlock replied stiffly.
Tristram wonders if the generous hugs that Emily shares with her father have anything to do with it. Maybe Father simply didn't know that parents hugged and touched their children before they met the Watsons. He certainly never hangs around school after dropping Tristram off to see other dads and mums hugging their children good-bye.
Sherlock held him back. "Wait," he hissed. "Or do you want this to turn into another fist fight? It's probably exactly what he's hoping for." Sherlock wasn't entirely certain that was Moriarty's aim - surely he didn't think John or he would be so stupid as to repeat the same actions here in such a public arena - but he honestly had no other ideas, and he was not so secretly curious as to what Moriarty's next move might be.
"Be careful," John admonishes him.
John nodded. Sherlock could see the relief in his posture, but when he spoke, his voice was even and neutral. "That's fair. Same goes for you. Whatever you want to tell me, and the rest... doesn't matter."
John's face did something complicated then. Sherlock would have liked to replay it, except he was more than a bit certain that pity had been involved. "Jesus, Sherlock. Did you ever-" John apparently thought better of whatever he was going to say, though, opting instead for, "It's not a popularity contest. I'm the two-weekends-a-month parent, the one who takes them to the zoo and buys them lollies and lets them stay up too late. You're the one they rely on, the steady presence, the one who takes them for their jabs and makes them eat their broccoli and gives them structure even when it's not comfortable or convenient for you, because you know it's best for them, and they see that even when they whinge about it. They know who's just dazzle and who's substance."
"Pity," John said, his voice coming out rawer than he would have liked. "It would have been nice."
It's not only that, though; reading between the lines of the bare bones explanation of Tristram's origins that Uncle Mycroft gave him, Tristram's figured out that Irene and Father knew each other for a while, back before Tristram was born. He's not sure if they were ever really friends the way that John and Father are, but they ... well, they must have slept in the same bed, probably more than once. Tristram can't possibly imagine his father willingly spending that much time - and especially in such an intimate manner - with anyone he didn't at least find interesting, to some degree, outside of a case.
"You are going to fucking tell me right now where he's taking him."
But now it's like they're two astronauts encapsulated in their own space suits. They can still see each other, still coordinate their efforts, but there are layers between them, their communication filtered through plastic and electronics and a vast, impersonal vacuum. The scar is like an outward manifestation of everything that's dulled their sense of each other.
"What does that mean?"
"Yes," Sherlock snapped and pulled his knees up in demonstration. In fact, he'd always bottomed - mainly as it took less effort. He didn't have to coordinate or think, he only had to relax his body, and then he was free to enjoy the effects on his mind of whatever drug he'd taken. He'd also had sex with Victor several times while not under the influence - all right, not much under the influence - and mainly found it sweaty and a lot of effort for a minor reward. He'd not seen the point in banging away at another body when he got the same outcome from lying on his back contemplating the ceiling, or bent over with his face buried in the crook of his arm to block out any annoying visual input.
"You're wasted, you know," John said.
But the point was -- and there had been a point, a salient one relating to John's furrowed brow and the faint aura of dissatisfaction that continued to hover around him regarding this wedding -- that there had been a moment while working on the speech, before their vigorous discussion of illustrations versus drivel, when John had drifted off, as if brooding, troubled just for a second by some word or image. His expression had cleared almost instantly, but that hadn't erased the suggestion of some deeper concerns.
Tristram is about to remind Doctor Watson of that, when he sees something funny on Doctor Watson's jacket, which he never took off. At first, Tristram thinks it's an insect, but it's moving too jerkily. Then it resolves into a light, just a little pinprick that dances erratically around on the black material covering Doctor Watson's back. And suddenly, Tristram knows with sickening certainty what that is. He tries to say something, to cry out, but his voice is stuck in his throat. Doctor Watson is still standing there, railing at Father, but Tristram doesn't hear him anymore. He has to do something!
Emily's grinning from ear to bright red ear and her hair is what Mrs Hudson would call 'a bird's nest'. "I went down a black diamond all by myself and I only fell five times!" she announces.
"You want to stop now?"
This is bad, and the badness stirs him out of the half-consciousness he'd slipped into. If there's one thing Tristram knows he's not supposed to do, it's go with someone he doesn't know. He's not even supposed to go with most of the people he
"Right. Right. Because we're not. We're not -- I mean, I wish you would tell me. Because I honestly do not know. What is this? Hm?" John's nostrils flared as he waggled his finger between them. "What is this that we're doing?" He put his elbow on the table and started holding up fingers to count off the items on his list. "We live together. All right. Fine. We share the household expenses. We share meals. All normal things between flatmates. We share the laundry. Well, I do your laundry. But still, fine. It's been known to happen between flatmates when one is a lazy sodding arse. But here's where I think it starts to get interesting.
For the syrup
Tristram settles himself on the bed again. "My father didn't want me to read any of them, but I did anyway, and he wasn't angry. And if I read it
It took John a moment, but he got there eventually. "Are you saying I'm culturally illiterate?"
"She wants to see Tristram."
"We..." John says slowly then, as if checking whether he heard correctly.
Sherlock stops and looks up. They are standing in the middle of an expansive paved area in front of a large red and white stadium. "Looks to be a sporting arena of some kind. You're the football fan, I believe." He finishes his text and sends it.
John stared down at him, his eyes becoming very dark. Sherlock's penis had softened and lay sideways across his groin. John reached out and ran his hand down Sherlock's torso, from his neck over his chest and abdomen and finally over his genitals, just brushing the surface. Sherlock closed his eyes and inhaled sharply with the renewed stirrings of arousal.
It is difficult now to recall with any precision, as the memory of that first visit has since been overlaid with many subsequent ones, but I believe that the first thing which my senses registered when the heavy padded door of the Inferno Club swung open to admit us were the sounds. I was used to hearing voices upon entering a club: the murmur of conversation punctuated with bouts of laughter, greetings called out across the room or even the occasional raised tones of a heated argument. I was unprepared for the grunts accompanying the sharp report of leather on slick skin, the hissed intake of breath following the cutting slash of a birch switch through the air, the breathy, high-pitched pleas for "one more, please, sir," and the panting moans of intimate physical pleasure.
"Doctor Watson..." Tristram pleads, "Father told us not to go with anyone." How do they really know that the man and the woman are from the hospital? His father's put on uniforms as disguises many times. In fact, Tristram wouldn't be at all surprised if he had the same green uniform in his closet. Maybe they are going to take him to another warehouse. Father said the people who killed Emily's mother wouldn't try to kidnap him again, but Father isn't here, and these strangers are.
Sherlock's face twists into a moue of disgust. "I wasn't flirting-"
"Oh, fuck..." John said unsteadily. "I really... Not that I'm not completely on board with this, but just so you know, I really did only come in here to sleep- Don't stop!" John said immediately when Sherlock lessened the pressure.
From where he's standing in the kitchen, he can see Father's computer standing open on the desk, but Father isn't sitting in front of it. He must be out. That's nothing new. He's often out when Tristram wakes up. He always leaves a note, though, so that Tristram knows he left on purpose and of his own free will. Tristram turns on the kitchen light and checks the table. There's no note, which is a bit disquieting, but maybe Father figured as long as Doctor Watson was here, he didn't need to let Tristram know where he was. Doctor Watson certainly wouldn't have let Father be incapacitated or kidnapped right under his nose while he slept on. Probably not. Tristram is suddenly in rather a hurry to have Doctor Watson wake up so he can ask him. He goes into the living room, Emily on his heels, and freezes.
Finally, "Where do you want me?" John asked.
As the buzzing from the crowd died down, the mayor continued: "I just want to take a minute to thank you all for all the effort and time and everything that you've put into the show, but ladies and gentlemen, if I had to single any one person out for their effort, for their time, their diligence, and their enthusiasm, it would have to be Mr Gregory Lestrade, better known to you as the head teacher of the Baker Street School. Come on, come and take a bow, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lestrade, come on, come on..." He beckoned toward the square below the stage, where Lestrade was standing off to one side in the front row.
But the "pirate ship" was the one Sherlock was interested in, and he made a beeline for it as soon as they'd paid their admission fee and passed through the turnstile of what looked to be something more akin to an adventure park than a working dock, with food and souvenir stands alongside prominent signs indicating the way to the laser tag arena, indoor climbing tower, motion simulator, and 4D cinema. It wasn't too crowded, which John attributed to the biting wind and threat of precipitation, but the walkways were still well enough populated, mostly with families and gaggles of teenagers.
"It's a secret, but I'm coming with you this afternoon," she whispers to him after their fathers have left, before they go into the school.
The door to the living room is closed, but the one leading into the kitchen is open, and they can see that the lights are off. They go through that one, Tristram taking the lead. There's enough light coming in from the street for them to orient themselves. A quick glance to the left shows the door to Father's room is open, so he's probably not in there. Ergo, Doctor Watson is also probably not in there. Tristram begins to breathe easier. Also, now he can hear the sound of snoring coming from the living room.
This is set about six months after the main story.
herbs and spices of your choice
Grandmother isn't around when they get back, but Mrs Bowen has laid out tea for them in the green parlour. Tris doesn't even really taste the biscuits as he swallows them. His father and Doctor Watson are sitting on the couch, talking, with Emily curled up on her father's lap. Tristram is slouched in one of the armchairs. He knows it shouldn't bother him as much as it does that his father and Doctor Watson are, apparently, friends now. Kissing aside, which Tristram doesn't want to think about at the moment. People have friends. It's 'healthy', as Mrs Hudson would say.
A sharp rap on the door frame has both children raising their heads to see Tristram's father standing in the open doorway.
John's hands clench convulsively around Sherlock's shoulders. Sherlock raises his head to look at John, checking that it's all right. John's eyes are glassy and his lips are red.
It didn't help things that John couldn't stop thinking about that kiss. It had been dry and quick, but there had been a gentleness and longing there that made John think Sherlock really had meant it. He could still feel the stubble on Sherlock's chin prickling against his skin, still smell the faintly pungent scent of unwashed Sherlock that had wafted up out of his t-shirt, and still see the fleeting look of panic that had crossed Sherlock's face when he stood up again, before whirling around and beating his hasty retreat.
"Ta very much-"
"So," he said, affecting a casual tone, "what'd you do with the body?" He was leaning against the door jamb and had both hands in his pockets. Sherlock wasn't reading any anxiety or fear, but there was a definite sense of nervousness, of anticipation.
"John?" Sherlock said, and in that one word, John could hear all the uncertainty and potential to be hurt.
Sherlock had to force himself not to turn around and check whether John was still standing there.
Holding himself up on one elbow, Sherlock puts the flat of his other hand on John's belly and smooths it across the surface. "Very," he says approvingly before lowering his head to put his mouth on John's shoulder, his chest, his stomach. When he gets to the waistband of John's pyjamas, he pauses, then carefully brushes his cheek against the hardness underneath it.
Sherlock kisses her on the cheek. "Happy Christmas, Mummy. This is John. Watson. Doctor John Watson." He brushes John's back, but drops his hand quickly.
"If I stood that close to someone I was just talking to, they'd have me down for sexual harrassment."
"I don't know," he mutters uncomfortably. Because if Irene and his father are married, what does that mean for Doctor Watson?
"Was there a reason you came in here, other than to play morality police?" Sherlock asked.
"I'm not going to change my answer just because your brain is too slow to grasp reality."
Tristram is... Something wells up inside him that's warm and bright and he actually gets a lump in his throat, which is stupid because it's nothing to cry over. It's just that it makes him feel really good. Not just the declaration of solidarity, but the fact that she wanted Tristram to know, that she must have seen how glad he was that John said he wasn't going to leave Tristram behind this time and that she wanted to reassure him that it would never have happened in the first place. Tristram swallows a few times and pretends the trousers in his hand need re-folding.
"You're very talented. I mean, I know I'm not a professional, but I think you're very good."
"There's nothing to tell-"
Tristram stares hard at a spot on the cover. It's irregular, and tinged purple. Phenylphthalamine? Did he have any up here?
"Will you stop, I cannot THINK!" Sherlock shouts, shaking him off.
Sender: Wiggins
"Sherlock!" John's uneven (familiar, comforting) gait sounded on the bricks behind him.
My own heart leapt in my chest in sympathy, although I knew his injury did not have the same source as mine.
Doctor Watson hefts his snowball. "I'm armed and not afraid to shoot."
He was more than surprised, therefore, when his mobile chimed with a text from John just as he and Gladstone turned around for the homeward leg of their walk.
"I thought you enjoyed driving."
"Now you're to sit still and listen to Mr Holmes." John pointed authoritatively at Ollie, who was still snickering behind T.J.'s head.
Sherlock had no choice, really, but to go along with it. His resolution not to allow John to interfere with things not related to the play had long since fallen by the wayside. The most bothersome part of it was that they were actually getting ahead of schedule according to Sherlock's strictly regimented syllabus. It wasn't simply a matter of having someone available to work individually with the slower pupils. John's presence had also worked wonders for discipline and cooperation amongst the children. They genuinely liked John and wanted to please him.
John frowned. "You traded for it? When? We haven't seen anyone with goods to trade since the last gathering. Or did you come across someone while you were out prowling?"
Tristram turns his head to grin up at Father. "That was so cool!" he exclaims.
"You go first, then we can switch," John offers, trying to keep the mood upbeat.
"You're out of line, Harry," Doctor Watson says, and a shiver runs down Tristram's spine at the threat in his voice. "We're not even-"
"You don't need to wait for me. I'll be there in a bit."
"Yes," John confirms with a quick nod and gets to his feet. "What the
Tristram leads the way up the stairs and knocks on the open door at the top. "Grandmother? It's Tristram."
He went into the bathroom. Sherlock got up to turn off the light, then got back into bed. Gladstone came over, ready to jump up and take his usual spot across Sherlock's feet, but Sherlock told him to stay down. Gladstone sighed and went to curl up somewhere else. Maybe he should get a dog bed. It was all so domestic, it was downright surreal. When he'd had sex in the past, it had always been fast and illicit and dirty, rarely safe and sometimes not even entirely consensual. He'd never calmly invited someone into his home and his bed like this, with the prospect not only of having sex but of waking up together the next morning.
Watson grinned back. And at that small gesture, that tiny moment of understanding and shared humour, something clicked inside Sherlock. He didn't know whether it was a switch that had been turned on or possibly off, but it was accompanied by the same feeling of exhilaration and dread that he'd had when he took his first hit after getting out of rehab the first time. That blissful completion of filling an emptiness coupled with the certain knowledge that the emptiness would only reappear in a more vicious way once the drug wore off. He'd trained himself to live with the emptiness, to skirt it or even, if he was very disciplined, ignore it. He wasn't at all certain he welcomed John Watson reawakening it, even if it did feel good at the moment.
"I haven't heard back yet," John went on, "but it sounded promising. It's in that new commercial centre down by the river."
"Take some of the fruitcake," Mrs Holmes said, pushing the plastic wrap-covered gift toward John. "I think it's the only thing Dad hasn't got into."
After several months of living in close quarters, however, his agreeable qualities became more and more difficult to ignore. At the time, I ascribed my yearnings wholly to my long abstinence, and in truth that may have exacerbated my urgency. But to my detriment I did not account for sentiment, despite my long-held belief that matters of the heart are anathema to a logical mind. At any rate, I made my decision in the firm conviction that it was a reasoned, sensible one.
Father makes a face and complains about his coffee a bit too, but he drinks it. Doctor Watson leans back in his seat across from Father, sipping his coffee and watching him. Father does the same, only with less sipping of his coffee. They both look like they might start laughing at any moment. Tristram wonders whether something funny has happened that he didn't notice. Maybe there is something peculiar about the coffee.
"Jesus, Sherlock, really not the time," Doctor Watson says, tightening his arm around Tristram's shoulder. He does take a second look, though. "Clean amputation, fits with your theory of the perpetrators knowing their way around these things and having proper equipment. Middle-aged, poor nutrition. Look," he says suddenly, sounding irritated and pushing the plate away. "I have to get back. I don't like leaving Emily alone with Harry and Clara."
It took him several more deep breaths to get the words out. "I'm really quite hopelessly in love with you, Sherlock Holmes." Then he took a step forward so they were toe to toe, reached up to put his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck, and pulled him down for a kiss. It was dry, and brief, and so full of longing and affection that John was frankly surprised his lips didn't spontaneously combust. He tasted the cigarettes on Sherlock's breath but let it slide. He probably hadn't tasted a treat topped up with beer and whisky the other night either.
Tristram sleeps in the living room again that night. His father looks like he wants to say something, but Tristram studiously avoids his eye as he pulls the coat down and makes a beeline for the couch.
"Jesus, John, no, didn't you hear me? You
Sherlock's hand clenches, too quickly, around John's knee. He relaxes it deliberately. "Because then it will all be over."
She reaches across Father to wrap her hand around Tristram's, tight, like a pair of handcuffs that have been fastened one notch too far. Tristram checks with Father. His eyes are fixed on Irene, pinning her, but she's not paying any attention to him. Tristram keeps very still.
Tristram looks at his and is surprised to see there's a picture of Father in the plastic. In fact, it's a copy of the rail pass picture they took at the airport. Well, not a copy; it's one of the very pictures from the strip that came out of the machine. Tristram flips the key chain over and sees himself looking back at him. He turns it back to Father's picture and can't help grinning.
"And you can-" John waved his hand around in Sherlock's general direction and started to back away. "Forget about that song. Seriously, bin it." (Embarrassed: Sherlock's curiosity was doubly piqued.) "'Night," he said gruffly and walked quickly across the square without looking back.
She cries out and shoves him away. "What are you doing?" she shouts. Tristram stumbles back and has to catch the curtain to stop himself from losing his balance.
A drawer in one of the filing cabinets deep in his mind palace popped open. He slammed it shut again, but not before his own voice had echoed back at him:
%%%%%%
Message Ok see you then. Call John!
Sherlock runs his hands through his hair, making it stand up wildly. It looks like it's been a couple of days since it's been washed. He tips his head back, exposing his throat, and presses the heels of his hands into his eye sockets. "I don't know. I had Mycroft's team narrow their perimeter around the house, at least until daylight."
"We're just off," Aunt Clara says. "Date night." She exchanges a look with her wife that Tristram doesn't quite get the significance of, although it looks like they think she's just made a joke.
Sherlock nodded, not trusting his voice anymore. This was no big deal, he told himself. Why was he reacting this way? He'd done this countless times before - not exactly in this position, but the mechanics were the same. There was no logical reason for him to feel like this. Physically, it was actually a bit uncomfortable at the moment, but it wasn't that. It was like a harmony coming together, a chord created from two instruments that were perfectly in tune, the vibrations from their combined tones resonating deep inside, deeper than nerve endings and marrow, somehow touching an even more basic level, synchronising their very atoms.
She laughed and shared a look with John. "Mike and Shelly's baby."
Sherlock makes a discontented noise. "Do you have their faces memorised?"
Sherlock's breathing became more erratic at John's touch. Unable to resist the temptation any longer, John licked his thumbs and reached over to rub both of Sherlock's nipples at the same time. Sherlock keened, the cords of his neck standing out. John felt his own nipples tightening, echoing a very insistent throbbing in his groin. John rubbed and circled the engorged tissue as Sherlock panted and struggled to maintain control. Or to lose it.
Billy showed them to a table tucked into the window niche. It was intimate, yet allowed them to see both the street and the rest of the guests. Sherlock got Gladstone situated out of the way under the table and took off his coat, tossing it over the bench beside him. When he sat down, he caught John staring.
Heat. Slick. Tongue. Lips. Heaven.
And that is really it! Many, many thanks to all of you for reading and commenting and being enthusiastic throughout. I had loads of fun with this series and I hope you have too. Onward to series 3!
Sherlock turned off his phone and set it on the bedside table, then got under the covers. There was a bit of an awkward back-and-forth as they both tried to adjust the comforter so they were both covered without actually touching each other. They ended up lying on their backs, John with his arms under the blanket and Sherlock with his on top. John could smell the cold air and cigarette smoke lingering on him.
Sherlock ignored everything he was saying about Moriarty and Sherlock's motivations because, really, it was all too tedious by this point. But it was what was behind John's little speech that rankled, and Sherlock couldn't let that go. "Oh yes, you obviously know me so well. Better than I know myself, is that it? We've known each other for barely two weeks, and you're suddenly the expert on my psyche?" he all but snarled.
"That's amazing," John said when Sherlock finished the story.
He squirmed a bit as he twisted his wrist and tried to find the right angle to add a third finger. It went in with a slight burn, but Sherlock held on and distracted himself with the heavy weight of John's cock on his tongue, the sound of John's ragged breathing, the feel of his fingers twisted in Sherlock's hair, gently pulling whenever Sherlock moved. When he was in past the first knuckle with all three fingers and the burn had faded to an occasional throbbing reminder, he pulled out slowly and lifted himself up, giving John's cock one last, lingering suck. He could probably have done with a couple more minutes acclimatisation, but it would do. He walked forward on his knees to position himself over John's lap.
"I didn't with you," John says in a small, flat voice.
"Wondrous," I assured him, my breath quickening under the pool of rapidly cooling wax.
Finally, I stirred when I felt Holmes ease off the ropes and step away. Thinking we must be finished, I lifted my head, which had fallen forward as if in a doze, and looked around. Our corner of the club was populated only by a small circle of onlookers. Some lounged on a nearby couch and others stood around with a casual, detached air. This was clearly not a very rousing nor exotic demonstration; no doubt the regular members were rather jaded and expected a greater value of entertainment. Yet for myself, I had rarely spent a more exciting evening, and I was surprised to discover a rising sense of disappointment that it should be over. What I had entered into with such skepticism and apprehension I was now exiting with a whetted appetite and a half-formed notion that we might repeat the exercise or engage in a variation at a future date. It was after all not that different from Holmes' boxing rounds or a night spent bending elbows at the pub, and it had the advantage that it was something which engaged both of our attention.
"I have an erection, and I am perfectly capable of sustaining it through intercourse with you," he insisted hotly.
He picks up some more snow and passes the resulting snowball to Tristram. "You're with me," he says with a wink and strides to the edge of the field. That statement makes Tristram feel almost like he's going to burst with pride. He is with his father. Always, in everything. He scrambles after him.
"You could be an excellent role model, if you'd take two seconds to give a damn."
Emily picks up a blue pencil to add some more details to her drawing. "Well, he said he wasn't trying to replace Mum, that no one could ever replace Mum. Which is pretty obvious, I mean, Sherlock's a dad, not a mum, and I already have a dad. And also that he thinks Sherlock's fairly special and he fancies him a bunch, and what I thought of that, and I said it was okay. I mean, he was really, really sad when Mum..." Emily falls silent for a bit as she colours something in very carefully, then continues, more quietly, "...when Mum died. But since he met your dad he's been better." Emily stops colouring and looks up at Tristram. "He never laughed. In ever so long. He used to laugh all the time, with Mum. And now he laughs again, sometimes, with your dad. So it's good like this. Mum's not coming back. And your dad's pretty cool, actually," Emily finishes with a shrug.
"Oh yes," John agrees, his voice a low rumble. He puts one knee on the bed and leans over to kiss Sherlock, bracing himself with one hand on the pillow so he can take his time. "I will." He tilts his head down to watch Sherlock caressing himself through his pants.
Tristram doesn't think that's entirely accurate, as he certainly didn't have a hand in the planning of whatever is going on at all. But he does like the idea of him and Father doing something special. He suspects it has something to do with the woman from breakfast, but that might be exciting as well. Like escaping from the hospital.
Her features soften, perhaps aiming for sympathy. "I don't hate you, John. I don't even dislike you. For what it's worth, I think you're good for both of them, and I don't begrudge you your position in either of their lives. God knows I think you're mad for throwing your lot in with Sherlock Holmes, but that's probably one reason he loves you." She smiles coyly. "Don't tell him I told you. He was probably saving it up to tell your gravestone in fifty years or so."
Sherlock looked at the screen. It showed the page he'd been working on earlier, trying to access John's bank account. He'd left it open, meaning to come back to it.
Greg had only been half aware of what he was saying to Sherlock as he went through the file with him. He'd probably come over as a proper idiot; not that Sherlock likely noticed a difference. Greg knew it was none of his business and he should concentrate on the bloody file, the whole reason he'd come over here, but it was just... this was Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. He'd been witness to their friendship since the day they'd met, had watched from afar and sometimes from too bloody close as it had grown and deepened and yeah, maybe he was a bit of a romantic at heart, even if he couldn't manage to keep a relationship of his own afloat, at least he was rooting for someone else to make it. And if ever two people deserved a happy ending...
"I'll wait."
Sherlock was in no hurry, though. He was still enjoying this, hadn't tipped over into that phase of urgency when ordered thought was no longer possible and all he knew was John ...
"Uncle Mycroft then?" Tristram asks hopefully. Uncle Mycroft can do just about anything, and he really doesn't want to disappoint Emily.
John held Sherlock back to let the rest of the party get a few steps ahead. "Hey, you okay?" he asked, keeping his voice low.
Sherlock shook his head. He didn't want John to ever move. It was perfect like this, just perfect, he needed to stay like that until they got a condom so he could put that beautiful cock up Sherlock's arse, and even then he didn't want him to move because then it would be over and there was no telling what would happen in the morning. "Stay like this," Sherlock said, knowing it was futile. "Just stay."
"Did you lock the door?" John asks.
"She said I had someone's eyes," Tristram recalls.
"Sure," John confirms. "Grown-ups too. Big men. Soldiers even."
"I didn't touch it. Besides," she adds more slyly, "our mouths have been in the same place."
"Do he needs a doctor?" a woman's voice says, tremulous and heavily accented.
"Can't I just unhook it and leave the rest in?"
"What, you mean the ones I just blew off and lied to their faces? The ones who are bending over backwards to make this the best Nativity the city's ever seen? Those people?"
John drops down into a crouch in front of him so he's at eye level with Sherlock's chest. The sudden change in position gives him a head rush, and he finds himself clutching at Sherlock's knee to stop himself from toppling backward.
Doctor Watson chuckles at that, and Father looks pleased with himself - or possibly pleased that he's made Doctor Watson laugh. Tristram likes the way Doctor Watson's whole body seems to join in when he laughs. It's not just his face creasing and opening up, it's the way even his ears perk up and his shoulders shake and the sound seems to bubble up from the bottom of his toes. Tristram sneaks a peek at Doctor Watson's feet once when he's laughing at something else Father's said, and catches them shuffling against the hard-packed snow as if they can't contain their merriment either.
"You know, I think it's almost a full turn of the seasons since I came," John realised. It had been a day not unlike today, in fact, sometime between the hot season and the snow, when the rabbits were still plump but starting to fill in their cold-weather coats.
"What what is about?"
They made it back to Sherlock's parents' house just after nine the next morning. Mycroft was as good as his word, staying at the house overnight and returning to the hospital with his mother first thing. Mr Holmes was awake by then too, alert and responsive, and they'd all been able to visit with him briefly before the nurse came in to take his vitals and change the dressing on the insertion site. Mycroft had then had his driver drop John and Sherlock off before continuing on to London. Mr Holmes would be in hospital until at least the following day, and they intended to stay until he was home, maybe even a day or two longer if no interesting cases turned up.
John looked down. Sherlock's dark hair was pressed flat, he had three days' worth of stubble - neither of them had showered before tumbling into bed - and he looked so earnest, as if John's preference for orgasm were a weighty issue that bore serious consideration, that John's heart swelled with the knowledge that he loved this man more than he'd ever be able to express.
John sighs. "Yeah, I get it. I'd feel the same way. But don't you think taking them back is asking for another attempt?"
When they run out of ammunition, Father leaps onto the snowy field - in his street shoes, no less - and barrels across it, scooping up snow as he goes. Emily screams and runs in one direction, while Doctor Watson goes the other way. Father throws as he runs, twisting his body to put all his weight behind it, and even as far away as they are, Tristram hears the thud of impact when he hits Doctor Watson's leg. Father must have overbalanced or slipped in his inappropriate footwear, though, as he's the one who goes down. Doctor Watson doubles back and tackles him, trying to hold him down as he heaps snow onto him.
John looks up from filling the kettle.
His voice is firm and confident, though, and he meets John's gaze head-on with a glint of something hard.
Sherlock was momentarily aghast. This was absolulely not the way he'd imagined the evening going. He hadn't visualised it in detail, but he'd had the vague notion that John would help him, that this was a project they'd work on together. Well, honestly, that John would do most of the speechwriting. But if the mere thought of it was causing him to flee in panic... Fine. Sherlock could adjust.
It's only three stops and then they pop out topside, a short distance away from Emily's aunts' house. This is the first time he's been here in the daytime, and also the first time he's walked through the neighbourhood, rather than just going up the walk from the cab to the house. There are fewer shops than where he lives, and there more single houses, like the one where Emily lives, as opposed to blocks of flats. Other than that, though, the buildings and cars look pretty much the same.
John went over to the drawer in the dresser where they kept their toys. He took out the stainless steel glans ring and brought it back to the bed. Sherlock was watching him, his eyes dark and lazy, half-glazed with the flood of pleasure still coursing through his system. He was more than tempted to drop his clothes right then and there, climb on top of Sherlock, and give them both the release their bodies and minds were begging for. But it might not be enough yet. Not enough to drown out the self-doubt and remorse that would continue to keep Sherlock awake and churning if he were unable to silence them completely first.
Emily chooses the 'poulet nuggets', which, going by the picture, are actually chicken nuggets. 'Poulet', Father tells them - although he says 'poo-lay', which sends Tristram and Emily into a fit of giggles - is French for chicken, so that makes sense. The picture Tristram picks shows a piece of breaded meat with a huge pile of chips. It says 'schnipo' next to it, which stumps Father for a while until he reads the description.
John released his breath in a great snort, and Sherlock felt something simultaneously loosen and tighten in his gut.
He hears a soft rustle of clothing as his father stirs. He watches the pale shape detach from the wall and move toward the bed.
"No thank you, dear," Martha said to the little girl. "I have a nice slice of roast beef waiting for me downstairs." To John, she said, "You two deserve a proper evening, just the two of you." They'd waited so long to finally have each other, and here they were with an infant demanding constant attention. Not that Watson wasn't a darling. Martha loved having her here, and Sherlock obviously did as well, so that was all fine. But a couple needed some time alone, all the same.
"I know, and I understand, about the bank thing anyway. And I know you didn't mean any harm with the kids. But," he took a deep breath, "I do think Lestrade was right to fire you. And me. It was a poor decision. Several poor decisions. On both of our parts. Which was another reason I had to take a step back for a while. I saw that I was doing things - because of you, for you - that weren't right. That weren't who I wanted to be. Just because I wanted this so much. And that's … a bit not good."
Mary snorts, her mouth closed to keep the sound contained. "I know you're not that stupid. He won't talk to me."
Sherlock wasn't sure how to respond. 'You're welcome' would imply that he had kept silent in order to help John, when in actuality he had tried to use the lapse as proof of John's instability. Sherlock was vaguely uncomfortable about that now. He didn't actually want to ridicule John or make him look bad, which was novel. He settled for a vague harrumph that could be taken as an acknowledgment.
By the time Uncle Mycroft comes to find them for dinner, they've used up all the toothpaste and most of the shampoo, and there are white smears on the mirror from where the shaving cream got out of hand. He doesn't actually come into the bathroom, though, so they are spared his opinion on having turned it into a potions laboratory.
Father drops his arms and goes into the bedroom without saying anything more. Doctor Watson follows him.
Doctor Watson's face, which had been showing signs of strain and frustration, suddenly crumples into understanding. "Oh God, Tris." To the woman, he says, "Could you excuse us a sec? I think I understand the problem."
"What situations?" John hisses. "You mean ones where you leave your son in the hands of strangers after he's nearly been killed not once, but twice in the same evening, while you go sniffing cigarette smoke and inserting yourself into police investigations?"
Her face clears. "Well, not all night. A bit. But I don't mind." She grins. "I just push him until he rolls over, then he stops."
"Oh, Wiggins. I won't be needing you this week after all. Can I text you?"
"Irene shouldn't have taken him like that," she insists.
Sherlock bristles. He came here to distract himself from John and his own desperate inadequacy regarding the entire situation. Not only that, it irks him immensely — and illogically — that Molly is concerned about John. That's not fair, he knows. She's his friend (too, he wants to add, but he's honestly not sure whether John considers him a friend anymore at all). It's only a measure of how well-liked John is that people other than Sherlock are thinking of him. But Molly is apparently not merely thinking of him, Sherlock realises, his brain damnably slow to parse what it was that she said. She has been to see him; talked to him. Something neither Sherlock nor Mary have managed.
"That is not true," John says, slowly and deliberately. "I'm the one who's not very nice."
Doctor Watson nods in response. Tristram can just see the movement in the corner of his eye over his shoulder. "Yeah, like a social worker or some kind of counsellor. Did someone come by to see you?"
"Give him a moment, he's just woken up," Doctor Watson says. He sounds tired himself. Tristram looks at him - really looks on him - for the first time this morning. He has huge dark smudges under his eyes, and blond-grey stubble all over his chin and cheeks. He looks old.
"I needed to clear the room! There were too many people in there. He had nine men called in for the meeting. Well, eight and a woman. You'd hardly have been able to identify your target, much less line up the shot. I knew you'd have qualms about shooting into a crowd. I notice no one's mentioned the fact that he was neatly framed in the window, standing nice and still for upwards of a minute. Even Mycroft could have picked him off with all the advantage I gained you."
Lestrade shuts up and Sherlock turns back to the dead woman. All of a sudden, he's lost all interest in her, in her killer, in everything constantly circling back to John.
He doesn't notice Father let go, but now he's back, saying, "If you're going to vomit, do it into here." Blearily, Tristram registers some kind of bowl being thrust in front of his face.
"Oh, is that what this is? A game? My life, my marriage falling apart, it's all just a game, hm?"
Isn't it?
"I know," Tristram mumbles. He does. He cares about lots of things, like besting people who think they're too clever to be caught, and proving his theories, and somewhere in there, Tristram. He knows.
But Emily has asked him a question. Another example of atypical behaviour: Father following John into the bathroom. It's a good guess on Emily's part, that he might be hurt. That's pretty much the only reason Tristram knows of for two people to go into a bathroom together, is for one to help the other because they're hurt or sick. But the four of them been together all afternoon and evening, and he didn't see anything happen to Father that might require medical care. So he answers, "No, I don't think so."
"I hope my interest didn't cause problems between you and John." Concerned now. The kindly village priest.
Just then, the door flew open and the children came in. They immediately took advantage of the large space to run and shout and generally be disruptive. Sherlock opened his mouth to yell and threaten detention, but before he could say anything, a piercing whistle came from John's lips. The children froze in surprise, then fell over themselves (in some cases literally) to follow the orders to assemble that he barked out. In short order, they were all lined up on the bleachers.
"Because it's private." Tristram can't help a desperate edge from creeping into his voice. He doesn't know how else to explain it to her.
He doesn't have time to explain that, though, since it's time to go back inside.
"What they said, about the play. It's going to be brilliant."
John raised his eyebrows. That he could relate to. "Oh yeah. I usually pop round to the pub, me." Which didn't sound like that bad an idea at the moment.
"Hello," Doctor Watson says with a friendly wave. "I'm John Watson, we're here with Sherlock."
"Of course. Good-bye."
John stops short, drags his eyes up. Doesn't even bother being shocked. Sherlock's standing there in his long coat, his gloves in one hand like he's just taken them off. He's paler than John's comfortable with. Maybe it's the overly bright lights. Who the hell lights a hotel bar like it's a hospital cafeteria?
was going to die. Especially that last time, with the IED- That's not something you just get over. I was in therapy-"
Father's eyebrows draw together. "Why didn't you tell me this before? I could have prevented this entire thing from happening!"
It's a brilliant day when they finally get outside, wintry and cold enough for Tristram to see his breath, but sunny. The sky is a bright, perfect blue and there are mountains everywhere! Tristram saw them yesterday, of course, but with the low-hanging clouds and the fog they seemed more like big rocks. Now he can see their tops, sharp and white, making the sky look even bluer and closer where they meet.
"I never--"
"No, you really don't," Lestrade agreed with Sherlock's assessment, far too cheerfully for Sherlock's liking. He leaned forward and shuffled through some papers on his desk. "Oh, and by the way, the punishment is, you're getting a classroom assistant," he said without looking up.
As their final ingredient, they each add one of their hairs. It doesn't end up smelling half bad, and it's probably a more cheerful colour than real Polyjuice Potion, but it's lumpy and thick, and by the time they're done, Tristram is quite pleased with the result. He reckons it's worth at least an E, if not an O.
"Doctor, actually. But call me John."
Janine grinned and took one more sip of her coffee. "Hold on, big boy. Don't touch, you'll only make it worse." She grabbed one of the scones as she stood. He was going to need some energy. She made a mental note to text Sherlock later. He had bloody well better send her an invitation to the wedding!
Lestrade leaned back in his chair. "I like to think you've matured since then."
"I'll quit," Sherlock said, closing the gap again, and he would, he'd flush every last one of his cigarettes at the next opportunity, because he didn't want John ever to hesitate or be put off, but just now there was no way he was going to remove his mouth from John's, at least not for a good, long while. They kissed until they were both breathless, their chests heaving against each other, and Sherlock felt John's hard length bumping against his through his pyjama bottoms and John's pants.
"No, you're not. But I know that at least one Holmes has a heart, and not only that, but he's bloody clever. I doubt your brother is that bad, but even if he is, we'll just use subterfuge to get him to come down and film the kids. If there's anyone who can do it, it's you."
Mrs Bowen snorts. "A likely story. I'm as like to get a straight answer out of him as to win the National. Well, we should have enough here for the weekend, anyway, and I'll get more in on Monday if needs be. Have the two of you had breakfast?" She takes out a loaf of sliced bread from one of the bags and opens the bread box. "Oh, don't tell me you ate those day-olds!" She tuts. "There go the dumplings. Never mind. What your friend must think of our hospitality." She shakes her head and puts one fist on her hip, but she's smiling. "Shall I fix you some toast and scrambled eggs, then? Or some cereal?" She pulls out a box of a sweetened breakfast cereal from a grocery bag and shakes it temptingly. "My grandson Davey eats this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
"And the cigarette?"
"Tristram," he says, making an effort to focus. She looks nice, with a soft, round face and dimples in her cheeks. He doesn't want to believe that she would do him any harm, but then he'd never thought that about Emily's Aunt Claire, either.
sleeping," Sherlock said irritably.
The Blackwood School was a Victorian monstrosity of pink stone, a Romanesque throwback with arches and towers and leaded windows. It screamed old-school posh, and was exactly the kind of place Sherlock had grown up hating for all that it represented.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. John wasn't going to let it go until he was satisfied. Sherlock took a deep breath and rattled off: "I was last tested for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and hepatitis over five years ago and have not engaged in any risky activities since. You were tested for the same within the last year, likely within the past six months. You have never used intravenous drugs and have not had a sexual partner since your discharge from the army. Which does admittedly leave a small window in the period immediately prior to your injury, but you are conscientious - even overly so," he added with a pointed look, "and have never engaged in unprotected penetrative sex outside of a long-term relationship, which we have already established you have not had since your last screening. And now we really should be moving on to the bedroom, and if you've brought a condom so much the better, otherwise we will improvise for now."
"Did he sleep in your room?" she asks Father conversationally, as she reaches absently into the refrigerator for the butter.
No one says anything. Not even Emily. The clinking of silverware against china from the other tables rings out unnaturally loud. Tristram, cautiously relieved, thinks it sounds like a good plan. Maybe it was just a coincidence that she was here after all.
Sherlock's eyes snapped to him. He looked calm. Unbothered by the insinuation. His statement was entirely truthful, yet surely he knew what it implied.
John looked torn, unable to take his eyes away from Sherlock's. "After," he said finally, sounding breathless. "After the play, we can... we can talk then."
"I am your man," said I.
Sherlock smiled and picked up his bow.
They wander up toward the hotel with the rest of the tourists, but rather than go into the building or take a seat at one of the tables set up outside, Father leads Tristram to the far end of the stone terrace, which ends abruptly in a steep drop. There's a thin railing for protection, but it would be all too easy to slip through the bars and end up on the rocky slope below.
"Sorry, I'm being stupid," John said to the ceiling.
"No lock," Sherlock says. "Don't worry," he adds when he feels John hesitate. "They won't come in."
The text on the cuckoo is a combination of quotes from the following sites:
He recognised that he was coming dangerously close to flirting. The thought didn't disgust him. It was like trying on a part, testing himself, seeing if he could maintain the persona. Only it wasn't a sham, this was all him. John didn't know him well enough to tell the difference, which was probably a good thing, otherwise he might have felt even more foolish. He very soon found that he had a heightened awareness of his body: how his jacket pulled across his shoulders when he stretched to unlock a strut, exactly how close his fingers came to John's when they dragged the keyboard stand into position. The way his hips moved when he walked across the room.
"Strictly off the record."
When I arrived at Baker Street, I went directly up to my room (for so I considered it again already) to deposit my parcels before re-joining Holmes. His mood had deteriorated, and I entered to a barrage of reprimands for my tardiness. I made some excuse or other, but he was not to be mollified, and continued to sulk through the excellent dinner Mrs. Hudson prepared for us. The good woman had gone out of her way all week to tempt Holmes' fussy palate with delicate morsels and hearty dishes designed to hasten his return to full health. That night, he deigned to eat no more than a few spoonfuls of the rich consommé and did little more than pick at his roast.
"Mm," Sherlock agreed. He suddenly felt incredibly sleepy. He'd only had one pint -- well, one and a half if you counted finishing John's last one.
Uncle Mycroft looks alarmed. "Excuse me?"
Their shared meals continued, though. The first night after that had been some bland takeaway, neutral ground. A couple of days of leftovers. John had kept away from the kitchen for a few days, finally easing back in with spag bol and a pound cake. Sherlock had countered with salmon and new potatoes. He didn't cook as much as John, generally preferring to warm up whatever he found in the refrigerator or freezer, but the situation had seemed to call for it. For him to make a statement.
But that was then. A flash of quantum possibility.
Sherlock didn't believe in 'meant to be', not in the sense of fate, anyway. He did believe in the immutability of physical laws. Some things were unavoidable. To every action there was an equal and opposite reaction. Atoms decayed. People died. And you could in fact rush just about anything, in Sherlock's experience. Catalysts facilitated reactions. Money talked.
John went out to the playground with the class for break time, while Sherlock went back to set up the classroom for the next lesson. On the way, he ran into Mrs Hudson in the hall.
Mycroft taps his computer screen. "Nothing's come in yet, but I'll keep an eye out," he assures him.
He put his phone back in his pocket and kept walking.
"There's a moral to the story too, you know," John pointed out. "Being respectful of your flatmate's belongings might just save your life one day."
Sherlock was struck by the thought that he'd never seen a picture of John from more than five years ago (his passport). Also that Victor and his wife had been together for what must be something like ten years now. Would he and John still be together in ten years? John had already gone noticeably more grey, gained several sags and wrinkles in the time they'd known each other. Most notably in the past year. Sherlock resented every one of those grey hairs and deepened lines, resented the time they represented that the two of them had been apart, and the reduction of the time they had left. Which wasn't to say, paradoxically, that he didn't find John more attractive and appealing today than he had the day they'd met. (He was still quite glad he'd got rid of the mustache, though.)
Doctor Watson sputters a little, but gamely considers the question. "I don't know... three? Stab them in the neck, in the eye, and between the ribs."
"Shh!" Sherlock shushes him sharply. "I need to think!"
Tristram clutches the blanket around himself and goes with Doctor Watson to stand on the right side of the window, opposite Father. Doctor Watson gently pushes Tristram down behind him. "I want you to sit right there with your back to the wall, Tris, okay? Don't move." He's still speaking calmly, but there's an iron edge to his voice that tells Tristram something is very, very wrong.
"One moment, if you wouldn't mind," I said, holding his arm fast. He had said he would only require this duty of me once, for which I was glad, as it was not a pleasant one. But it was a necessary one, and I was equally glad for the chance to discharge it properly. If I were to embark upon this course, it was vital that peace be made between myself and Watson's wife; or rather, since the deceased was in a place beyond feeling, that I make peace with my own failure which she symbolised.
"It doesn't matter anyway," a boy in the back row said. "Anything we can do, Blackwood can do ten times better."
They end up in a tearoom. John insists they take a table as far from the window as possible, which Tristram is more relieved about than he'd like to admit. John orders a tea for himself and hot chocolate for Tristram and Emily. Irene jumps in before the waitress can walk away and asks for something called 'vermicelles' (it sounds like vair-me-cell, but she shows Tristram the word on the menu and tells him it means 'little worms', which sounds extremely promising) over John's objections that it will ruin their lunch. There's a bit of tense staring over the table, but Irene wins in the end.
They stare at each other, a battle of wills. Sherlock drops his eyes first. "I've told you, I'm not-"
"Just getting the easy ones out of the way. So there's that one, and then for Mary and Joseph's song I think we should keep it simple as well."
At lunch time, he holed up in 221A, the speech therapy room that was annexed off the main classroom, with a pile of papers. He was afraid of what he might do if John proposed lunching together again. That was why his stomach sank - or did something funny, at any rate - when the door opened ten minutes before the end of the hour.
If the anatomical drawings -- some clearly professional, others in an unpractised but not unskilled hand -- and framed botanical specimens on the walls hadn't been a strong enough hint, the half-size violin and bow mounted on the wall were a rather dead giveaway. The room was no shrine: it was tidy and uncluttered with the general air of a guest room, but enough personal effects had been left to give it at least some sense of homeliness. The double bed was overlaid with a crocheted throw that looked more like something Mrs Hudson would have chosen than Sherlock. The space smelled as if it had been recently aired, the crisp tang of winter hovering just out of reach.
Sherlock let his hand slide away. "I'm ready."
"John Watson."
Beside him, John gulped down a snort. Sherlock couldn't look at him for fear of losing his composure completely.
Sherlock would have pointed out that his legs were also not exactly the steadiest at the moment, but he also understood that this was important to John, and actually, having John's mouth around his cock was something he didn't want to pass up. He sat up so he could straddle John's torso and steadied himself against the wall behind John's head. His penis ended up about at the level of John's forehead.
And then Father read. That chapter had Dumbledore in it too, and Father did his voice every bit as perfectly as Tristram - and Emily - had suspected he would.
he'd take good care of him. Father said himself it wasn't easy; certainly, Tristram can see now how much of a hindrance it must have been for Father to care for Tristram before he could walk and talk and dress himself and cook and know better than to touch human brains without gloves or mix sulfuric acid and ammonia. Even now, it's sometimes a bit of a shuffle to get Tristram properly supervised when Father's working on a case. But Father's put up with the inconvenience for years, which must mean - Tristram's mind boggles a little - that in some way, he is
Lestrade relaxed and folded his hands over his stomach. "Says the man who arrived with a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder on his record."
Which meant Sherlock, because John's certainty regarding his intentions had been obvious for quite a while now. In a way, Sherlock resented that John didn't trust that he was an adult who knew his own mind, but at the same time he had to admit the knot in his stomach had loosened just a bit at John's temporary rejection. He hadn't really been planning to kiss John tonight (although he'd thought about it quite a bit at odd moments over the past few days), and he certainly hadn't been planning to invite him back to his house to have sex. It wasn't that he was apprehensive about any of the potential physical acts (within reason, and John hadn't given any indication that he habitually engaged in anything outside the mainstream); but it would perhaps be polite to at least provide clean sheets and get rid of the river mud experiment, which wasn't as interesting as he'd hoped and smelled admittedly rather foul.
Doctor Watson comes over and crouches down next to Tristram, his head pressed right up next to Tristram's so that he can follow the line of his finger. He smells different than Father, but nice, too.
John's expression turns suddenly cool. "No, right, I forgot that. So, never mind." John flops onto his back again and pulls the quilt up over him. "Good night." He deliberately closes his eyes, and turns his head toward the back of the couch for good measure.
"Something you'll never have to worry about," Sherlock said. "What with your biological clock ticking down its last few seconds."
Another growl escaped me. My entire body was taut, my fists clenched and my thighs hard as I struggled to neither squirm away nor lay hold of Holmes and pull him down to me.
"Quite," Tristram's father says, watching Emily's father intently. "I wouldn't want to be held responsible for my actions if I'd had to listen to them snickering behind my back all evening."
"Wouldn't that be cosy, the five of us?" Irene purrs.
"It's just..." Molly glanced hesitantly at Sherlock and John. And here it came. John shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Time: 14:20
"You'll be-" John looks around as if seeking confirmation from the rocks of how utterly unreasonable Sherlock is being. "You'll be fine? The last time you did something like this you ended up on your knees with a pistol two fucking inches from your skull." He holds his thumb and forefinger together to demonstrate.
Unbidden, a grainy image formed in Mycroft's mind as if recorded by a hypothetical hidden camera. A darkened room, two forms moving beneath the sheets. Faint words and sighs. Another scene with one shadowy figure on its knees, the other on hands and knees, grunts punched out of lungs, the sounds of skin slapping skin. The living room was a likely venue as well. The two chairs. In broad daylight. The couch, where he himself had sat. Hadn't there been that greasy spot? Mycroft came to he sudden, horrifying realisation that no surface in their flat, horizontal or vertical, was likely to have remained unsullied. He resolved to send John Watson a bottle of Glen Elgin in reward for his foresight, along with several bottles of Domestos. Let Sherlock explain it to him.
John holds up his hands. "Just trying to help," he says and lets Sherlock stalk away.
"There are three hospitals with casualties within spitting distance, so don't give me that. A few seconds as soon as you realised what had happened really wouldn't have been too much to ask. What if he'd needed respiratory support or had a seizure?" Doctor Watson sighs and drops his stethoscope into his case. "I don't see any signs of impaired nerve function, haemorrhaging or cyanosis, but still. He needs to be checked out. He'll need cultures done, a check of his liver and kidney function. You said you preserved the stomach contents?"
"They could just want to give you the finger," John suggests wryly.
"Endearing?" John echoed, mildly amused. "I was hoping for a bit more than that-"
"More," I said, clenching my jaw.
"The cathedral ruins, John." Sherlock dodged a gaggle of sixth-form girls (going to the cinema, one meeting a boy her parents don't approve of, one with marijuana in her handbag and a crush on the one with the fringe). God! Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut in frustration and nearly stepped in front of a car.
Lestrade made that gormless open-mouthed face again. "The one where you talk to all the parents about the play and the filming and answer their questions," he said carefully.

"I thought we were leaving Sherlock out of this," he teased as he fell onto the bed, pulling her down on top of him.
Doctor Watson hands Emily her phone. "All right, you can have it now. I've taken Harry out, but left the third number blank. We can fill it in when Sherlock comes tonight, if he says it's okay."
Or maybe Sherlock simply doesn't want to let Magnussen win. It all comes down to the game for him. And he's said that's all this is: nothing more than a game.
A beat of silence, and then Sherlock said: "All right. Good night."
"You're going to have to bite the bullet and choose someone for those parts, you know."
&&&&&&
My eyes widened. "You don't mean to say you called on him like that." I nodded meaningfully at his person, knowing he would understand me. The Baron was a devil of an alpha who made a living preying on omegas across the continent. To walk into his parlor under the pretense of being one was akin to a fly dropping in on a spider.
Gladstone was at his side as soon as Sherlock's feet hit the floor, and went with him downstairs. Sherlock fished the box of condoms and the little tube of lubricant he'd bought at the shop out of his coat, then went into the downstairs toilet to wash his hands thoroughly and clean himself as well as he could with a wet flannel.
Tristram is still trying to figure out what that was about when Father slips quietly out of the room.
Doctor Watson picks up the chair Father was sitting in before and swings it around to face Emily and Tristram then sits down, bracing his elbows on his knees.
"No, it's good, as a doctor you should know that," Sherlock assures him, sounding surprised. "I know it still looks a little rough, but the puffiness will recede in a couple of months and the scar will--"
"Are you feeling sick?" Doctor Watson asks.
"What in the world is going on?" Sherlock thundered.
"And afterwards?" Greg had that kind of incredulous look on his face like when he couldn't quite follow one of Sherlock's theories.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's no excuse and it's also really not the point, Sherlock." Lestrade sounded weary now, his earlier anger spent or perhaps just rendered ineffective. "You were entrusted with- No, scratch that. I,
"You going to stay up and finish with that?" John asked once he'd sent the message and set Sherlock's phone back on the table where he could see it.
Sender: John
"I'm not having sex here in the bathroom." There's not much weight behind the words, though, and John doesn't make any attempt to stop Sherlock from continuing to disrobe him.
John sucks in a breath. "And that..." He groans. "Yeah, that's very, very good..." He half lowers himself and half falls so he's sitting on the mattress beside Sherlock.
Sherlock's head hangs down between his shoulders. His eyes have drifted shut and his breaths are coming faster.
John smiles too, although it looks equally strained. "Thank you. Well, I'd better get back."
"We're with our fathers," Tristram points out. "They can give us permission not to go to school."
Tristram doesn't know what that's supposed to mean. He tries to be good, and he thinks he mostly succeeds. It's not like he does mean things to other kids. He's good at some things, like keeping his room and his desk tidy and remembering to brush his teeth, and he's probably the best in his class at reading, but he's not great at sports or group work or making his father laugh - not like Doctor Watson is. But he doesn't think Doctor Watson really wants an answer. He's trying to tell Tristram something, not get answers out of him.
"Oh God, now, now..." John gritted out before throwing his head back into the pillow and grunting as he spasmed and climaxed, until he dropped bonelessly down onto the mattress, spent.
John looks down. "No idea where the first one went. If there are any drive-by shootings reported tonight-"
Tristram's flattered, somehow, that Emily wants his father to be safe. At the same time, even though he's aware there are dangers and uncertainties, and that his life is affected too, he would never ask his father to stop doing what he does. There are very bad people out there who hurt other people, and the work his father does helps keep not just them, but everyone safe.
John leaned back and grinned up at Sherlock. "I was thinking of the Great Freezer Meltdown of 2010."
"Quite right, Mrs Hudson," Father says. He takes out his phone and snaps some pictures of the box from different angles, saying at the same time: "Tristram, come along. I'm taking you to school."
"Well, it was," Watson affirmed. "Extraordinary, I mean. Can you do that with anyone?"
John looks amused, but at least he doesn't dig any deeper. "I suppose it could be at that," he allows generously. "Sure, I'll ask."
"To be fair, this isn't either," John piped up, pointing at the music in front of him.
"Then I'm sure you have a solution that us small-brained plebs would never happen upon."
"Obviously."
Then Irene's voice says, "You can bring him in here," and the hand on his elbow is gently pushing him, guiding him. Emily breaks eye contact and takes hold of his other elbow, and he finds himself being brought into a shop. The hands lead him around behind the counter and onto a stool. He has his eyes closed now, partly because that way he can remember Emily's eyes and keep focused on his breathing, and partly because he's utterly humiliated and doesn't want to know how many people are standing around watching him, witness to his breakdown.
"Me too," Tristram hears Emily say. He looks over at the seats facing them. Emily has also raised the arm rest between her seat and her father's. Doctor Watson looks surprised as she drops onto her side with her head cushioned on his leg. Her legs are too long to curl up onto the seat, so they dangle somewhat awkwardly down toward the floor.
John came back, looking steadier. He wore his pants from yesterday with the t-shirt Sherlock had handed him from his drawer before they got into bed. Sherlock had on his pyjama trousers and John's army t-shirt. It wasn't a conscious statement. It had simply been what he'd left on his bed from the previous night. Sharing clothes. John's eyes were open now as he climbed back into bed. He pulled the cover back up, settled it over Sherlock again, patting him through the material. He lay on his side, propped up on one elbow, looking sheepish and pleased and hungover, his eyes puffy and his face chalky, and something in Sherlock's chest tugged, that thread between them pinging.
A great big thank you once again to my beta readers, dioscureantwins and ruth0007 for their invaluable insights, advice, and general good sportsmanship.
Sherlock closes his eyes and imagines his own heavy breathing is John's, his huffs of laughter giving way to stuttering, muffled grunts. Those little involuntary sounds that flew right into the empty spaces in Sherlock's heart, their wings fluttering and beating in his chest, a descant to the racing of his pulse. This is why, this right here is why he should never allow himself to give in, because those spaces are hollow and gaping and there is nothing left to fill them. No winks over severed limbs, no toes brushing his under the table at breakfast, no footsteps pounding in rhythm with his, no breathless whispers against his neck. His own hand is a poor substitute for the one he wants. He's never been good at denying himself what he wants.
"I hate hospitals," he tells Uncle Mycroft obediently. Although 'hate' is perhaps a bit strong, he really was happy to leave.
Sherlock was more interested than he wanted to be. "I suppose he thinks he'll be giving orders, instilling military discipline, that sort of rot."
"Sherlock ran into her last night. He must have mentioned being here with us." Doctor Watson takes his phone out. "At least I hope that's all it is," he mutters under his breath.
"No, I suppose I don't," John agreed. "But if he's any kind of decent human being, I should think he'd at least hear us out."
"Does he always snore like that?" Tristram asks, amused.
Still, what harm did it do? People were helped, Sherlock was kept away from other temptations, and John felt more or less useful. He hadn't really thought it important to make it clear he'd have come back even if Sherlock shut down his consulting business and went into beekeeping or professional internet forum lurking. After all, what did it matter why he was there? He enjoyed going out with Sherlock, exploring seedy locales and posh residences, bluffing their way past security guards and fusty librarians, grabbing a sandwich from a stand as they passed by, or debriefing over coffee and a pastry in an all-night cafe. Going home together, still buzzing with caffeine and adrenaline and maybe some other more incriminating hormones, shushing each other on the stairs so as not to wake Mrs Hudson, lingering in the living room, finding excuses not to go up to bed quite yet.
Sherlock shuffled down a bit awkwardly, as he needed to keep up his ministrations with his right hand, and held John's cock upright with his left hand so he could get his mouth around it.
"It might give you a chance to do it properly, Doctor Watson." Irene gives him a funny look, half stern and half teasing. "Call me if you need any tips." She picks up the handle of her suitcase and adjusts the strap of her handbag over her shoulder.
"And you have a way of making all the background noise go away," Sherlock finally says, his voice low and warm against John's cheek.

"Princess isn't her real name. Abigail McCarthy," Sherlock says, his eyes now flashing with interest.
"It's not like that," he said, predictably. Did he think she didn't have eyes or ears? She lived right underneath them. And this wasn't her first go round the park. "The Yard really did call him in," John insisted.
"And you didn't think it pertinent to perhaps mention it to me?"
a pleasure," he burbles with an oily grin, holding out his hand. "Jim Moriarty."
"We don't just eat together once in a while, we actually plan our day so we can have dinner together every night. I've noticed, Sherlock. Every night, without fail, since I've moved back, unless there's a case on and neither of us eats." John had now gone through all the fingers on one hand and moved on to the other. "We go out to restaurants together. Not just meeting up for lunch or getting together with a few friends once in a while, but the two of us. Alone. Planned, with goddamned reservations. We share clothes. Don't pretend you didn't take my old army t-shirt to sleep in, and I know I've been rather free with your dressing gowns when you leave them on the hook in the loo. We text each other constantly. We Skyped every bloody night that week you were in Helsinki, and if we hadn't I think I would have been on a plane to follow you. We get invited places together, Sherlock, and if we're not both invited we bring the other one along anyway."
John sighs. "All right, look. It's only been a couple of hours. We may be making something out of nothing here. Before we all panic, why don't I text him and see how things are going." He takes out his phone and starts composing a message as he talks. "He'll probably be back by dinner. And in the meantime we'll go ahead and pack so we're all ready to go when he does show up. All right? Everyone agree?" He raises his eyebrows hopefully and looks around at them.
Sherlock gritted his teeth. Didn't he just say that? "He's going to say no," he warned.
"The bullet hit him in the neck. There was a lot of blood," Sherlock mutters.
This was intolerable, Sherlock thought when he was elbowed for the third time as he tried to navigate the crowd of last-minute shoppers. He didn't even know what he wanted to buy. What gift said 'You are the only thing of value I've ever had in my life and I may literally stop breathing if I ever lose you, so please ignore absolutely everything I do from here on out'? Without coming across as needy and/or psychotic, went without saying.
Father, meanwhile, has moved on and begun setting up his computer on the coffee table, unravelling the power cord and attaching a funny-looking plug on the end. Tristram wanders over to watch.
John's eyebrows shoot up. "What, you honestly expect me to go back and live with her, and what, pretend everything's fine? Pretend I still love her and want to stay with her till death do us part?"
"You're working on a case though." It's a bit of a stab in the dark, but Tristram doesn't think he's wrong.
"I'm working on it," Tristram says, hopefully loud enough that his father can hear him. "I have the plaster thing off."
Gladstone lifted his head and gave a short bark, then let his tongue hang out and panted happily.
"Fairy tales, you know: Rapunzel, Ashenputtel, Rumpelstiltskin..."

"How is he?" Father says. His eyes remain focused on Tristram as Tino slots the stretcher into place and secures it. Father's gaze is so intent it seems that he's trying to see through the blanket covering him, but the question is clearly for Doctor Watson.
"Nothing," John said, too casually. "I only mean, I can see the fascination."
Time: 15:02
"Unfortunately..." Sherlock answered, not liking where John was going with this.
Tristram bounces down onto the bed next to her. "They're working."
"You could come back with me," Sherlock blurted out before John could say anything else. He didn't want the evening to end yet. He quite wanted to kiss John some more. A lot more.
"I need more data," he tells Doctor Watson. He's quite serious, but Doctor Watson laughs.
"Does this have to do with an old case?" he asked. "Like that Ricoletti thing?"
Tristram's father walks around to the other side and flops down onto the front passenger seat. Doctor Watson gets in, makes sure that Tristram and Emily are buckled in with the blankets over them, and tells them to make themselves as comfortable as they can and try to sleep. He then takes a couple of minutes adjusting the driver's seat and headrest and the mirrors.
"No, I do," John spoke over him, and something in his voice made Sherlock let him continue. "Because it's like you said. I haven't had any kind of serious relationship in a very long time, and the last one I did have was with a woman and we were pretty much just kids, and I'm not saying it has to be any harder or even different with a man, but you're not just any man, are you?" John glanced at Sherlock with a wistful smile. "And I don't want to mess this up. It's probably silly of me, I mean we've only known each other a few weeks, but this feels different so far. In a good way. A really good way." John grimaced and looked away. "Sorry, this is probably more than you signed on for."
"We trust Irene?" John asks, as if that's news to him.
When he returned, John had turned the light on and was sitting on the edge of the bed in his pants, looking through a pile of books on the floor. Gladstone was sitting at attention a couple of feet away, watching John sceptically. There was a rectangular plastic packet on the corner of the nightstand that hadn't been there before. Sherlock set the lotion next to it.
"Is this your grandmother's house?" Emily asks as she follows him across the hall.
Father engages in a brief, silent exchange with Doctor Watson, and appears to lose. He sighs. "Yes, well, this person wanted an excuse to use his gun. I gave him that excuse, but on my terms. And since he didn't want to shoot me, he had no choice but to play along."
And then they are free! Tristram experiences the thrill of illicit accomplishment. He wants to shout, or maybe run some more, but he knows they have to act casual now and not draw attention to themselves.
John tilted his chin and Sherlock closed the distance between them, nipping affectionately at John's lips. John hummed with pleasure and deepened the kiss, co-opting Sherlock's mouth for several seconds.
"Mice?"
Doctor Watson finishes his exhale and looks at Tristram hopefully, patting his knee. "Better?"
"Wh- yeah, fine, I suppose," John spluttered.
The Baker Street Primary School was a low, boxy product of utilitarian 1970s brick-and-glass design. It smelt permanently and inexplicably - despite an entire afternoon wasted in an attempt to discern the source - of wet dog overlaid with industrial disinfectant, and had a reputation for mediocrity that everyone, students, teachers, administrators, and alumni alike, worked hard to maintain. Sherlock was no exception. Teaching certainly hadn't been his first - or second, or fifth - choice for a career, but after being dismissed from the conservatoire, he hadn't had a lot of options. He'd transferred his credits to the Open University, finished his BA through correspondence while he was in rehab, and talked his way into a position at the struggling private school. It had been five years now, and this would probably be his last. Especially after the incident with little Seb Wilkes. Or so the head teacher, Greg Lestrade, had hinted heavily, if Sherlock didn't 'adjust his attitude'. Something which Sherlock, of course, had no intention of doing. It wasn't his fault that the child was an idiot, and unable to handle being told so.
"I didn't specifically, but I did have to mention the fact that your son was shot to the dispatcher. Also, a gun goes off, there's a high probability one of the neighbours will call the police. God, are you even listening to yourself? Tristram was hit by a bullet and could have-" Doctor Watson breaks off and glances inside the ambulance, where Nisha has attached a metal clip to Tristram's finger and pulled back the blankets enough to get a blood pressure cuff around his uninjured arm.
"Yeah, you know, I think the music's good for both of them," John said through a half-suppressed yawn. His mouth was slightly shiny from the grease in the food, and the sleepy way his face moved as he spoke really shouldn't give Sherlock the desire to smooth a thumb across his cheek, feel the throb of his pulse in his neck. "If it's all right with you, I'll work on them at home and have the first one at least ready for us to run through the auditions for Mary and Joseph on Monday."
Sherlock lifted himself up enough to work the hide down over his hips. The sling he wore to contain and protect his own genitals was bulging and when John pulled the one end out of the strap around his waist, he groaned in relief. John folded the leather down out of the way so he could wrap his hand fully around Sherlock. The days when this had seemed odd or awkward were long forgotten. Sherlock's hot, hard flesh in his palm, the smooth, spongy head now moist with the precursor of Sherlock's own essence, Sherlock's scent in his nostrils, his deep voice rumbling his pleasure in John's ear - it all made John's chest pound with the rhythm of devotion and throat ache with the knowledge that that devotion was returned.
Sherlock shakes his head and sits up straighter. "Don't need it."
Victor was nothing if not persistent. When Sherlock didn't respond to his initial email, he followed up with another two days later. Sherlock sat staring at the subject line (
"Here, you can hold onto me," he hears them say. It's Irene, which lessens his agitation somewhat but not entirely. "A country this rich, you'd think they could afford to salt the streets, but all they ever put down is this bloody grit," she grumbles.
"There's no case, is there." John doesn't really need to ask. Sherlock isn't moving the way he does when he's on a trail. He would never have stood chatting with Janine if there were really a suspect whose room needed watching. In fact, he wouldn't have come to fetch John personally either. He would have sent a text, at most.
John watches him for a moment, then stands slowly and speaks to Sherlock's back. "I've always known I was bisexual. Well, since my late teens, anyway. So, no, not so much a sexual identity crisis as such. Although it has been a long time. Since before I met Mary, obviously. There hasn't been anyone since. And I know the timing couldn't be any worse, but the thing is... " He takes a steadying breath. "The thing is, Sherlock, I have never done casual sex. Ever. And I didn't think I was this time, either. So." He waits, but although Sherlock has stilled, there is no answer. Eventually, he goes to the bathroom door and opens it. "Seven o'clock?"
"My invitation, silly. I showed you mine, now you show me yours. I know you're doing the Nativity again this year. Or are you worried you're heading for another minus two-star review?" Moriarty made puppy-dog eyes at Sherlock.
after reading this fic, which hopefully means a bit of extra change in Martin Freeman's pocket as a result. If you haven't seen the movie, I do recommend it as a heartwarming, family-friendly, holiday movie. It's cute and Martin gives a very wide-ranged performance, from humour to heartbreak, along with being excellent with the children.
"You've obviously been talking to the wrong people then."
John refused to be put off. "Yeah, but you don't. You've never once mentioned him, or anyone from back then. Leads me to believe you've probably deleted them all, and for good reason."
"You feel incredible," John says. The words come out rusty, as if he hasn't spoken in a long time.
Lestrade rounded on Sherlock. "And your grand excuse?"
John grimaces a bit. "Not exactly like that. But do you remember, back when we first met, I had a problem with my leg?"
Emily's aunts have a whole bookshelf full of pictures in the living room at their house. Tristram hasn't had the opportunity to look at them more closely, but he assumes they're of family members. Maybe the picture of Emily's mother is there too.
Tristram giggles and puts his hand in John's. "Nice to meet you, John Hamish."
John smiles too and leans forward to kiss Sherlock, bracing his hand on Sherlock's thigh. "That it has."
I had learned not to hope, but by now, I believe, I had also learned to accept the turning of the seasons, knowing the inevitable losses of winter would be followed just as inexorably by a new spring.
"No. There's no body."
Doctor Watson's whole body is rigid, and his face has that terrible look that makes Tristram want to slink away and hide. "That was so far over the line-"
It wasn't fine at all, but Sherlock didn't know what else to do. His entire experience with making people do what he wanted them to involved lying, threats of blackmail, and bribery. And none of those was going to help him here. What did normal people do in situations like this? Beg? Cry? What would Mrs Hudson do? Or (he shuddered) Lestrade? The answer was obvious: they wouldn't have got themselves in this deep in the first place.
John clapped a hand to Lestrade's shoulder. "Er... I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking over, Greg, we have a few things that need sorting back here..." He gently ushered Lestrade and the mayor back out toward the public square.
She turns halfway around to smile at them and gestures for them to come closer. "Come and tell me what you think," she says.
He took a moment to survey the wreck he had made of me. The skin of my chest and stomach was red and patchy, scattered with the broken traces of our activity. Crumbs of wax hung tangled in the hairs on my chest and under my arms, where some stray rivulets had run down. My hair was untamed and ruffled from his hands and my own thrashings. Careful as Holmes had been in attaching it, the collar nevertheless had chafed and rubbed, and my neck felt hot and swollen. And there was my weeping cockstand, purpled and bulging, the ridged knot at the base already beginning to swell. It would not reach its full dimensions without contact with an omega's channel - my experiences with my beta spouse had taught me that - but that did not mean it was tame or unreactive.
"Don't worry, she's not really going to-" Moriarty tells him testily, and then there is a short, muffled pop, and then another. Moriarty slumps to the side and slides off his chair onto the floor.
"Mal wanted to redo it all," Mr Holmes was saying, oblivious to John's miniature crisis, "turn it into an indoor workroom. She worries, you know, me all the way out in the shed. Especially in winter." Mr Holmes went to the window and looked down into the garden. It was late afternoon, dusk closing in, but the large toolshed-cum-workshop was still well visible at the back of the property. "But the light's all wrong in here, as you can see, and it's too small." He gestured around the room and confided with a twinkle in his eye, "Anyway, a man has to have his cave to retreat to. When all the genius gets to be too much."
The next time he saw Gladstone was a month later, on Christmas at Mummy's house. Mycroft spent the entire afternoon sitting in the library on the phone, while Gladstone lay glumly under a chair, gnawing on a rawhide toy. Sherlock finally had enough of the dog's sad eyes, and took him for a run around the grounds when he went out for a cigarette. He never brought him back. Oh, Mycroft had ordered Sherlock to return the dog, but it was telling that he'd never made a serious effort to reclaim him.
John appeared in the doorway to the kitchen a couple of minutes later. He looked … somewhere between bemused and cautious.
"Yes," Sherlock blurted out as John was pulled away by eager little hands. "But no sausages. I'll text you the details!"
"You're going to spend Christmas with some bloke you've known for a couple of weeks and leave me, your only family, alone. On Christmas."
John's breaths have become heavier, his nostrils flaring with the effort. He appears to be frozen, unable to look away.
"Good night again," John whispers, smoothing his hand over Tristram's forehead once he's tucked under the cover with his cast resting carefully on top. There was a time when Tristram might have resented the gesture - he's not a little kid, after all - but now it feels nice. Not just the gentle touch itself of warm fingers on his skin, but the way it makes Tristram feel inside. Like John likes him and wants him to be comfortable, maybe even happy.
"It was tipping down on Sunday," Watson said briskly. "I wouldn't have driven a dog out in it, much less a horse and its master."
"She specialises in copyright law, but she's pretty confident we're in the clear," John explained. Ah, she was in it for the money - a trait not shared by the siblings. There was always something.
"Right then," Sherlock said brightly. He didn't even have to fake his good mood. "That's us off then." He surveyed the room triumphantly; no one would meet his gaze, although a fair few of the other teachers were watching John. He saw admiration and perhaps even a bit of covetousness in their gazes. Sherlock smiled. John was his. "Come along, John," he said, and left without looking back to see if John was following. He must. He did.
Sherlock allows himself to hope that things aren't entirely broken. "I'm not a very nice man." He means it playfully, but it seems it was the wrong thing to say because John suddenly becomes serious again.
"You coming along to wait for the delivery doesn't pose a significant disruption for anyone."
"Tristram, it's me," the female voice of the visitor says. It's Uncle Mycroft's assistant! But Father said he alerted Uncle Mycroft, not his assistant. She might be a false ally, like Emily's Aunt Claire was.
John's head pops up and he makes an inquisitive, if sleepy, sound.
Father raises his eyebrows and looks back down at his phone. "Yes, why don't you?" he says mildly. "Would have been much less bother."
"Why the hell did you call me back then?" John demands. "You knew there was nothing I could do for him, even if he was having a panic attack, which he wasn't."
Father does a funny frowny-smiley thing with his face, like he's trying not to look pleased.
John looks down at Sherlock. "She told me Mycroft made her leave." There's a question in there somewhere.
As any scientist worth their salt knows, however, the results needed to be replicable. And so Sherlock tried again that night. The next morning, however, John nagged Sherlock into getting dressed and had him halfway out the door before Sherlock realised what was going on.
That night, he came to me. I did not allow myself to dwell on the reason. It was of no consequence. I would give him what I could, even if it meant I would suffer for it after. He was hot and shivering when he slipped between the sheets. I thought at first he might be feverish from our jaunt on the heath, but he assured me it was a fever of a different sort. We did not talk beyond that. His breath across my lips was word enough. My tenderest touches in his most delicate places were my response. He heard and acknowledged with caresses and kisses to my mouth, my chest, my fingers, my prick. I spent in the hot, spit-slick sheath of his fist while licking my shameful sentiments into his salt-damp skin. He spilt in the sweat-oiled crevasse of my arse, with our hands grasping each other like limpets on a rock in the crashing surf.
John kissed Sherlock one more time, then looked over his shoulder and laughed. "That bloody dog, I think he gets his jollies off watching!"
That makes sense. Tristram's left arm has a smear of blood down it where he pulled out the IV, but it's stopped bleeding. His back's still throbbing from scraping it on the closet, but maybe Mrs Hudson can re-do the bandages when they get home. And he's going to have the cast on his right hand for seven weeks. He certainly doesn't want to sit in this room for seven weeks waiting for it to heal. But above all, Tristram would much rather be at home, surrounded by familiar things and smells and sounds. At home with Father, and his violin, and the tent that Doctor Watson built for him and Emily. Tristram hopes his father hasn't taken it down.
"Somewhere..." she called back unhelpfully.
Sherlock leans back and runs his hands through his hair. "No," he agrees. "Although I'm not sure I would have taken you along anyway. The contacts I was after today are wary of strangers."
"Really 'no', or nothing you're going to tell me 'no'?" John asks, ignoring the hint.
"No, you're right. You're right. We never did touch the last song, though. The manger scene."
"The second one... John, untie me, the second one," Sherlock said, yanking repeatedly at the straps, and John considered for a very brief moment that maybe it wasn't the difficulty of the proposition that had made him choose that, but choose it he had, and John was going to get off either way, so it was honestly no skin off his nose.
"Yeah?" He stops and turns around.
"And would she have known what to do? Would you? Other than call for one of your faceless assistants?"
She'd brought him his dinner the previous night as well. Was she one of the bad guys? Should he have noticed something about her then?
" 'Alien', remember? That drawing of Josh's reminded me of it?"
"Don't care," John said. "I prefer you here."
"I fished it back out!"
"It was mostly John's doing, to be honest." Which was entirely true, and he didn't even need to feel guilty for saying it.
John's eyebrows pop up. "You did?"
"Your dad likes Angelo's lasagne?"
As for the rest, there was some scattered, half-hearted applause before people started drifting away in seek of more tantalizing stimulus. Shinwell Johnson was amongst them, and he came over to offer a few insipid comments on our performance before taking his leave to fetch Kitty Winter. I was glad to have avoided any further discussion or confrontation. My discomfort was increasing with the end of Holmes' attentions, my muscles stiff from being held immobile for so long and my arms and legs beginning to fall asleep.
"To keep you from ending up dripping before we're even there," her father says. He sounds like he thinks it's funny though. He bends over again and makes another snowball. Emily runs further into the field of snow, laughing, to get away. Instead of throwing the snowball after her, though, Doctor Watson hands it to Tristram.
In fact, John neither left nor said anything of the sort. Rather, he looked startled and said, "I don't know either. It's ... " And then a smile slowly snuck onto his face, as if he were just realising it at that moment. "… exciting."
Sherlock folded his hands over his chest. "Yes, go on."
"I got shot," Tristram announces with some pride. Father's been shot before - although that was a rather bad time, not one that Tristram remembers with any fondness. But still, now they have something in common.
"But she made pot pies!" Emily says earnestly.
It occurs to Tristram now that Uncle Mycroft has in fact signed permission slips and absence notes for school before, and arranged for his passport when it had to be renewed when Tristram turned five. Well, Uncle Mycroft's assistant at the time took him for the photos, but Tristram remembers the assistant giving Uncle Mycroft the photos to approve along with the form to sign, because it resulted in a haircut right there in Uncle Mycroft's house by his personal barber, and an ensuing row with Father over it later. Tristram never thought twice about it - after all, Uncle Mycroft was always signing things, and anyway Tristram was probably too young then to realise what it meant - but he understands now that Uncle Mycroft has been acting as a proxy parent for probably his entire life. Which is fine and doesn't affect Tristram either way, except possibly to make things easier when he doesn't have to chase his father down for a signature. But he is just a little bit hurt that no one ever thought to tell him. Maybe Father and Uncle Mycroft both thought he knew.
"There is nothing I can do for him. There is, however, something I can do here. Do you 'get that'?" Father retorts snidely.
"Sherlock..." he started, looking down at the sheets, which Sherlock recognised as the children's wish lists.
anything," she finally says.
"Good."
to Father than his work. He almost shies away from the thought, it's so fragile, but it seems almost incontrovertible that Father must, in fact, love Tristram. Quite a lot.
Sherlock breathed in the scent of John's scalp. He could still smell Sarah's shampoo.
"Damn," John said bitterly.
The toast has already popped up, so Tristram puts the pieces on a plate, which he hands to Emily, and puts in two more.
It turned out the Holmes house rules were Byzantine and unexpected, involving things like semi-permeable blockades, three strikes and you're out, and die rolls not necessarily being worth their face value but rather the basis for a mathematical equation to determine how many spaces you could advance your pieces. Sherlock was out for blood, but Mrs Holmes and John formed an alliance which was able to keep Sherlock in check long enough for Mr Holmes to somehow sneak past all of them into the safe zone and victory.
"Why are you so worked up then? If he's just gone for a walk round the garden-"
Message: Btw patients, waiting for ear wax to soften. How's the fitting going? Better than mine I hope.
Lestrade drops his arms and gapes. "Bloody hell, Sherlock, it's not the same thing at all! Jill was only two months gone and we weren't good anyway. But no kidding, did he and Mary separate now too?"
John chuckled, and there were those crinkles around his eyes. Sherlock had been wrong. He definitely could not go twenty-four hours without seeing those again. "Beats what they used to pass off as coffee in the army," John said. He took another sip of the drink Sherlock had brought him. "This is nice too, though. Is it all right if I just..." He gestured at the counter where the tea and coffee things were kept.
The descriptions of the layout of the airport, train station and shops are as I recall them, although I added in the photo booth in that corner.
"I'm going to ignore that, given the circumstances," Mycroft said with a pointed look. "Of course I'm grateful for John's quick and professional actions. Thank you," he said to John, adding after a beat, "again. That doesn't change the fact that he cannot make changes to the care sheet," Mycroft said, returning his attention to Sherlock. "So if you both insist on staying--"
"You up for another round of Snap?" He holds up the pack of cards in his hand.
When he comes back, he's grinning and holding the library book he's in the middle of reading.
Tristram is curious, though, which picture is on the other side of Father's key chain. It's not likely to be Emily. That leaves either John or... Is it one of the photos that weren't supposed to be taken? One of the ones with their fathers kissing... or the one where they were staring into each other's eyes?
Father makes a grumbly sound, but he doesn't sound displeased.
"My arm's bleeding." He opens the door further, hoping that he's not about to see anything he doesn't want to. To his relief, Father and Doctor Watson are both lying half-reclined in the bed, each on his own side, and it looks like they both have all their clothes on. Well, they are both wearing t-shirts anyway. Their legs are under the covers. At Tristram's words, however, they both sit up and push the covers back. Doctor Watson, wearing black pants that leave his thick legs bare, is up first.
"What- Are you going out again?" she asked, a bit surprised. Not that he looked like he'd just been having sex, but he hadn't even washed his face.
Then Irene walks over to Tristram. John lets go of him, and Tristram feels him pulling Emily away as well. Tristram's first instinct is to go with them, but he can tell Irene has something to say to him so he stays where he is.
John stopped laughing. Shook his head a bit, as if clearing it. "Sorry, with your?"
Tristram considers this. It may be true; he's never actually heard it stated one way or the other. But his family has never had an absolute relationship with the law. "It's okay to do things that are against the rules, if you have a good reason," he tells her with the absolute confidence of a child who has seen authority figures do just that, with few or no repercussions.
"Jesus, Sherlock, slow down!" John jerked him back and held him in place by the arm. "What about the cathedral ruins?"
Emily laughs. "What language is that?"
John, on the other hand, appeared completely unperturbed, and started nattering on about the various acts the children had put on earlier. He even went so far as to mimic some of them, giggling around his food. Sherlock was going to say something scathing about having been there as well because he needed John to be quiet, he needed him to just sit and be and let Sherlock soak him in without adding more input, more nuances and expressions and why had Sherlock never noticed the little scar on the corner of his jaw before? It predated his time in the army, but was it an injury inflicted by another party, or was it an accident-
John had stood as well, and stepped forward to lay a hand on Sherlock's arm. "Hey, no," he said, gently but firmly. "It's not like that. She's not replacing you, or me. I think we've worked well together so far. Remarkably well." His eyes caught Sherlock's and held them, searching, even challenging.
to come together, and no one else knows what's going on beside you. So please,
Sherlock's hand breached the few centimetres separating them, bumping into John's hip under the cover. He let it rest there, his index finger lazily stroking John's hip a couple of times. Then it stopped, and John was asleep.
"I'm not your darling," Emily states flatly. She stares right at her and puts another big spoonful of vermicelles and cream into her mouth.
"I think I can make it home safely on one beer," John said wryly, but he didn't move to get up.
John laughed. "Why did you even agree to watch this then?"

Stupid.
"Let's pretend this is Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and we're brewing Polyjuice Potion. Look." She lines everything up on the surface next to the sink. "Do you remember what's in it?"
John turned his head toward Sherlock. "Is this okay?"
"Obviously," he said. It sounded like a term of endearment. Maybe it was.
He's distracted from following that line of inquiry any further when Sherlock pulls the bottom of his shirt out of his trousers and lifts the material away from his chest and abdomen.
Time: 14:16
Well, water under the bridge now. Done and dusted. John was here, where he belonged. If the two of them wanted to make up for lost time, she was going to help them however she could. She just wished there were some way she could let them know it was fine with her if they made a bit of noise. She was afraid they were holding back for her sake. On the other hand, perhaps they went at it like rabbits as soon as she stepped out to the shops, or turned on her hoover.
When he's done, John takes a picture with his phone to show Tristram. Tristram's not expecting the bright red lines still criss-crossing his back. He thought the skin would all be smooth and pale again. He realises with a sinking heart that he still has a ways to go before he's fulfilled his end of his deal with Father. Of course, his cast won't be coming off for a few more weeks, but maybe this is going to take even longer.
"Does it happen to you?"
Doctor Watson relaxes a bit. "I heard you screaming bloody murder."
"It was fine," he repeats Father's answer.
. It is about an hour from Meiringen by car. They only actually offer one model of knife for self-assembly, the Spartan. But it would be cool if they let you put on any attachment you wanted. :)
"It's a special kind of rock, you don't find it around here. The man who traded it to me called it obsidian. It's not particularly hard, but it can be worked into an extremely fine edge, as you can see."
It wasn't just the current distractions that bothered John, though. It was that he had absolutely no idea what Sherlock's intentions were. They'd gone out a few times, snogged, had fantastic sex, and John had fallen in head over bollocks, only to find out that Sherlock had quite possibly been playing him the whole time, just as he'd played the school governors, the mayor - hell, the entire bloody city. John swore he was going to back off until he got his head clear, but then he went and gave Sherlock the song, and Sherlock reciprocated the gesture, and now he was on his best way to falling back down the same hole. This time, he had only himself to blame.
