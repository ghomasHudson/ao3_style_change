He was so damn sweet.
“Good,” Dean said, continuing his journey down. “‘Cause I’d like to make forgetting up to you.”
“Dad, you missed Sam’s graduation,” Dean said as calmly as he could. “You
“I’d hate to cause madness,” Cas said in a tone that suggested the opposite.
"You did this to him, Dean," Alastair said and Dean felt his chain loosen, sending him stumbling.
“Castiel,” he said, leaning in so that he could put his lips to his partner’s ear. “You’re all I want. You’re all I’m ever gonna need.” He leaned his forehead against his angel’s, rubbing their noses together. “You. Your head, your heart, your strength, your sexy, perfect ass…” he nipped Cas’ neck, earning him a quiet gasp of laughter. “You’re it for me, angel. You don’t have to prove a damn thing to me, ok?”
Dean exhaled in a long, shaking breath. “Cas I...I need you to know that I want you,” he blurted out. “Ok? The...the-” he blushed. “The sex stuff...I
“I don’t give a fuck,” Dean said, tightening his arms around the angel. He felt Cas’ arms circle around him as he returned the hug. The water soaked through the back of Dean’s shirt immediately, but he didn’t care. Cas was home.
But even trying to tell Sam about it had felt hollow. He hated the pain he saw in his brother’s eyes as Sam realized just how close he was to giving up. Giving in.
“I’m not sure easier’s the right word,” Daniel said and Dean flinched. “But it gets less sharp over time. The good memories start to hurt less.”
But he couldn’t.
Cas’ gorgeous eyes were wide as they met his. “Dean?”
“You always do,” Dean replied, kissing him again. “I’m sorry that I didn’t realize that was today,” he said when they came up for air.
“Well...yeah,” he said a little more gruffly than he meant.
. He smiled at the angel. “What do you need...sweetheart?” And damn, if it didn't feel really nice to call Cas that.
“Yes,” Cas breathed, his eyes wide.
“Well,” she said pleasantly. “Given that I’m friends with every bar and package store in the next three counties, I suppose that I could send my Fergus around with your picture so they know whom not to sell to.” She narrowed her heavily made up eyes. “Or…” as if by magic, two heavy set men that Dean recognized as the bartenders materialized out of nowhere. “You can leave quietly with my bonny boys, ne’er to return.”
“I was able to make a reservation with a hotel during dinner,” Cas said with a soft smile. “Rowena was kind enough to coordinate.”
“I’m yours, angel,” Dean said and slid into his partner in one long thrust.
Cas’ answering smile was luminous, the sweetness at odds with the clever way Cas’ fingers were beginning to work him.
, Dean.”
“Don’t you turn your back on me,” John snarled as Cas led a limping Dean from the kitchen to the front door. “CASTIEL!”
Dean was more than happy to take him into his arms again, holding Cas as close as he could manage without tangling their limbs. “Happy Anniversary, Cas,” he said, closing his eyes and resting his head on top of the angel’s.
due to your presence in it."
“Today is September 18th,” Cas said. “Thirteen years ago today I took control of this vessel for the first time and you stabbed me in a barn.”
They lay that way for a few moments, just luxuriating in the feeling of each other before Dean pulled back with a rueful grin. “Fuck, you make me crazy,” he said, breathing hard. “I swear I could cum just moving against you like that like a damn teenager.”
He kissed away the tear that escaped Cas’ careful control and felt the angel relax with a shuddering little sigh.
He had failed to protect Cas. Failed to bring him home whole.
“Just as long as you don’t call me ‘Llama face’.” Dean grumbled good naturedly, laying his head on Cas’ chest and closing his eyes.
The blow came from his right, a mostly empty beer bottle striking him just above the ear and making him stagger into the stairs. John was on him in an instant -- he always did love a brawl, and Dean found himself crying out as John slammed him bodily onto the stairs.
He woke up some time later, groaning and wincing away from the warm washcloth at his brow.
“Dean,” Cas said, pulling back just a little and looking into his eyes. “Are you sure that this...that
“No,” Cas said, leaning his forehead against Dean’s. “I know the truth of your soul, Dean Winchester. You are strong, and brave, and
Despite himself, Dean flinched as the demon got closer.
Dean was happy to comply.
“Sir, I’m afraid I cannae have you bothering my patrons,” Rowena said in a bright voice that had steel behind it.
Daniel gave him a gentle smile. “Sorry if I’m crossing a line,” he said gently. “But I lost my wife last year and I...I know the look.”
“I love you, Castiel,” Dean whispered raggedly before crushing his mouth to his partner’s, catching Cas’ wild cry of pleasure as the angel tipped over the edge. He stroked in and out a few more times as Cas came down, then gently eased out of his angel with a soft hiss of need. His cock was painfully hard, but he didn’t have the benefit of an angelic refractory period. He wanted to make it last as long as he could. So he kissed Cas’ lips, then down his chest to lick the cum that had splattered over Cas’ belly. He caught Cas’ eye as he licked each of the little streaks, loving the broken way Cas gasped his name. “So much for hands up, eh?” he teased, kissing just below Cas’ belly button.
Dean felt the familiar burning at the back of his throat that had nothing to do with what he had just done for Cas. “Only you could make me fucking weepy when you’re about to suck me off,” Dean said, caressing Cas’ cheek. “I love you, you dork.”
“Course,” Dean replied before the woman in front of them with a large hat turned and shushed them. Fortunately Bobby had a far flung corner of his property that he’d been ok with the hives being set up on after Joshua had passed and a new preacher had moved in. After all of Cas’ hard work, it hadn’t felt right to leave them. He’d written Cas a whole letter about the process, even sending a few pictures of the new setup, the wildflower garden, and himself in Cas’ beekeeper’s gear.
“You didn’t,” Sam said firmly. He took a deep breath and plastered a smile on his face. “So, how’s D.C.?”
“Please,” Cas breathed, the sheer want in his voice making Dean’s breath catch as his cock twitched.
Dean smiled and poured some lube over his fingers, then paused, one hand squeezing Cas’ ass. “One or two?” he asked.
“Stay the night,” Bobby said firmly. “Both of you.”
The music started to play and Dean and Bobby looked at each other. They only had three seats reserved.
He knew that his brother and Jack, fucking Jack, were hurting too.
He pulled back and went to the pantry, yanking it open and pulling out the mostly empty jar of grape jelly. He handed it to Cas and raked his hands through his hair.
“If you like,” Cas teased, the words stealing Dean’s breath from his lungs.
“I prefer English for being dirty,” Cas rumbled, reaching down to give himself a few strokes, his free hand caressing Dean’s cheek.
had promised Sam.
“I know, boy,” Bobby said, giving him a sympathetic look.
Dean laughed quietly, pressing a kiss to the corner of Cas’ lips. “Nothing turns me on like turning you on, babe.”
“So come with me to D.C.,” Cas said right away and Dean almost crashed the car into a telephone pole. He managed to pull off safely and put the car in park, staring at his best friend.
“Adorable really,” Alastair said as he put the chain through a heavy hook in the ceiling. “Look who’s here to try and save you. Again.” He smiled at the angel, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “But this time, you won’t be flapping out of here.”
“But I want to,” Cas said, the hunger returning to his eyes as he brushed his fingertips over Dean’s length.
“This what you need, angel?” he asked, slowing his pace so that his strokes were long and deep, each one drawing a gasp of need from Cas.
Than he could
“I will never let him hurt you again,” Cas said firmly, bringing Dean’s hand to his lips and kissing his knuckles. He hesitated. “I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you, Dean.”
Dean frowned, shifting a little so that he could look at Cas more easily. "Ok, Cas," he said. "I'll bite. What's wrong with Laundromats and Fridays?"
and your eyes do this thing when you smile really big that makes me feel like I’ve found a home and it just…” he laughed, blushing. “Yeah...awesome.”
“Don’t!” Cas said, his voice thick with emotion. “Alastair, if you must punish someone, then take
“That’s what the microwave is for,” Dean retorted, catching Cas’ nipple between his teeth and giving it a gentle tug. He switched to the other, flicking the tip of his tongue against it before looking up at his angel. “Unless you really want me to stop,” he asked, grinning up at his partner.
called you," Cas said firmly. He knew that Cas made an effort to stay out of his head, but there was a hint of something in Cas' voice, like he'd picked up on what Dean was thinking.
Not jam.
Alastair's expression was calculating as he licked Cas’ neck. "We'll see if you feel that way in a few days," he said in a low growl. "When I've got you-"
, Cas.”
“Fuck, angel,” Dean rasped, pulling back. “You sure?”
“I’m not talking about the past, Castiel,” Alastair said, stepping closer to Dean and resting his hand on the buckle of Dean’s belt.
One of Cas’ eyebrows went up, the familiar expression suddenly making Dean’s stomach do a little flip. “Do you see anyone else here?”
Dean moaned into the angel’s mouth as his body stretched to accommodate him. But Cas’ patience was paying off, because while there was certainly a stretch, it wasn’t painful. Still, Cas was slow and gentle, and it felt like a small eternity before he was seated completely inside Dean. They were both breathing fast and hard by the time he was, and when Dean’s eyes flickered open he saw his name forming repeatedly on the angel’s lips. “Cas,” he said, pulling him in for a slow kiss. He wrapped his arms around Cas’ back, clinging to the angel as they began to move together. “S’ok,” he moaned, rocking his hips up to meet Cas’ thrust and earning himself a gasp in response. “S’ok, Cas, I won’t break. You can go harder, baby, it’s ok.”
“I would not have offered if it weren’t,” Cas said calmly.
Dean bit down on his molars as he tested his bonds.
Fuck, Cas was about as deep as they came.
Cas’ expression softened immediately. “You don’t have to do that, Dean,” he said.
. You missed it, Dad-”
"Sit down, Castiel," Bobby said calmly, only the tic in the corner of his eye betraying his tension.
“C’mere,” Dean said, pulling Cas to his feet and grabbing the damp towel. He cleaned Cas off tenderly and then kissed him slow and sweet, one of his hands resting at the back of Cas’ head, the other on his waist. “I fucking love you, Castiel,” he said, surprised that his throat was tight with emotion.
“It’s ok. I’ll be ok. It’s not your fault.”
“Shaddup,” Dean replied, catching Cas’ lip with his teeth and giving it a soft tug. When Cas moaned softly into his mouth it had Dean hard in an instant, but oddly he didn’t feel the need to push things further. Just being held with such tenderness made him happier than he could ever recall being.
“Awesome,” Sam said, grinning. They left the graduation slowly, pausing at intervals for Sam to talk to his classmates and say his goodbyes to his teachers. By the time they arrived at the Impala, Dean had stripped off his jacket and loosened his tie.
"When you and Sam were alone as children, you would often do your laundry in the motel bathtub to preserve your money," Cas said. "I was unhoused during my longest period of humanity and I...Apart from the time when I was residing in the back room of the Gas n' Sip...I did not often have that option." He shrugged. "It is emotionally draining when one is starving to have to use the meager amount of money that you have managed to amass to clean your clothes so that you may have a prayer of finding gainful employment before the winter fully sets in and your body succumbs to the elements."
“You needn’t be gentle,” Cas said quietly. “Take what you will of me, Dean, for I am and always will be yours.”
it. He felt like an idiot. He knew Cas worried that he was settling for the angel. That Cas was somehow something other than the answer to everything he had ever wanted.
Cas nodded and Dean did what he always did, diffused the emotional moment with a joke. “Do you know any dirty Enochian?”
Dean grinned at him and gave him a playful nudge. “Well good,” he said. “Lay on your stomach.”
Grape jelly.
“What do you need, sweetheart?” Dean asked.
He was reaching for the crunchy, organic peanut butter that Sam liked when he caught sight of the familiar purple jar a little ways away.
“He what?” Cas growled, shooting him a look. “But-”
Dean’s heart was beating a thousand miles a minute as he looked into the deep blue of Cas’ eyes. “Cas,” he whispered, not sure what he was going to say next.
“Wrecks the seasoning,” he explained, taking the job of wiping out the cast iron himself. “You know how food just slides right off of her? Well, that’s the seasoning and it’s taken me months to whip the old girl back into shape.”
for this very opportunity? What if he let this chance slip away and he lost Cas again?
He didn’t deserve Cas’ faith in him.
“Such a sweet boy,” Alastair said, breaking the kiss. “But I think watching me
“I love you,” Cas said, kissing him. His voice dropped an octave as his lips found Dean’s ear. “And no randos,” he said firmly.
He laughed as Cas rolled on top of him, framing his face with his hands. Cas’ answering kiss was a fierce one, but as they melted into one another it turned soft and tender. They didn’t do more than kiss that night, luxuriating in the feeling of their bodies pressed together. But it felt fun and oddly...safe.
They were led to their four-top by the proprietor himself, who chatted amicably with Bobby about whisky before their blonde, sassy waitress came to get their drink orders. Her name tag said “Meg” and the way she eyed Cas made Dean’s hackles stand up.
Cas deserved to be where he was…
, Dean thought. “Well, I said we needed a big win,” he said aloud. He met Sam’s eyes and knew as soon as he did that Sam was way beyond just suspecting so...fuck it. “We got Cas back,” he said. “That’s a pretty damn big win.”
Dean blushed as he sat up against the headboard with a wince.
"And Fridays?"
“If you say ‘very pleasant’, I swear…” Dean threatened good naturedly.
And with that, the dam broke.
“You’re dead,” Dean said right away as though speaking the words might banish the figure before him.
“I fucking love you, Cas,” Dean said in a ragged whisper, pulling Cas in for a deep kiss. “Thank you for...for all of that. For loving me. For protecting me. For being patient with me.” His voice broke. “Thanks for saving me, Cas.”
Except for PB&J.
“He is,” Dean said, rising onto his tiptoes. “But he flew in to...to-” he trailed off, catching sight of the familiar dress blues.
Dean snorted. “Oh yeah?” he said, giving Cas a little squeeze.
John let out a low, mirthless laugh. “Fucking cocky for a little fucking fag-”
Cas raised his chin, his face impassive, only the rapid rise and fall of his chest betraying any fear.
“You are the farthest thing from broken,” Cas said firmly.
more. “More, Cas, please!”
“Just go,” Dean begged. “Just go, please go. Please go. I can’t see you hurt, baby I just-”
The smile Cas gave him was so sad that it took his breath away. “I don’t think we want the same thing,” he said calmly. “And I would rather not jeopardize our friendship.”
Dean nodded, taking a deep breath and allowing himself to relax completely for what felt like the first time ever. “Love you, angel,” he said softly.
“Yeah,” Dean said, his voice coming out a little rough as the emotion welled up. “It was. Thanks for wanting me like that. For being that way with me.” He kissed his angel and then leaned his forehead against Cas’. They were quiet until Dean’s stomach rumbled, which drew a laugh out of both of them. They got cleaned up together and dressed, but Dean found himself hesitating. He wasn’t ready for the spell of the morning to be done just yet. Instead he pulled out his phone and went to Spotify, doing a quick search.
Holding his eyes, Cas gave the tiniest shake of his head.
“Hey,” Dean said, catching his chin and making Cas look at him. He took a deep breath. “I love you, Castiel.”
“I’m here, love,” Cas said, rubbing his back in soothing circles. “Given the choice, I will be by your side forever.”
Dean folded back into his chair, hating how his hands were shaking. “You ok, Sammy?” he asked.
“Can you stand?” Cas asked, his breath warm against Dean’s lips. “I wish to return the favor.”
“I...I need to-”
“Not sure you’re ready for that,” Cas teased gently and Dean blushed.
He would know Cas’ soft gasp of pain anywhere.
“You aren’t ok,” Cas said, sounding heartbroken. “Dean, please look at me.”
“Bees are doing good,” Dean whispered. He’d built new brood boxes and supers himself and spent a harrowing evening smoking out the hives and relocating everyone.
It was different this time.
Cas shrugged. “My memory is better suited to those sorts of things.” He raised an eyebrow, his lips curling into that smile. “Besides, at the time you were preoccupied with how best to ‘gank’ me. I doubt sincerely that it would have occurred to you to remember the date in the event of romantic entanglement.”
Every bit as deep as Cas was.
Cas was breathing hard by the time he was done, and for a moment Dean just watched the rapid rise and fall of the angel’s chest. “Fucking gorgeous,” he said, reaching up to rest his hand over Cas’ heart.
Shit.
He’d shopped mechanically, getting the staples.
Cas blushed, shaking his head. The answering smile on his face was almost shy, but his eyes were serious as they searched Dean's. "Apart from becoming aroused," he said gently. "Are there other things that you want me to be aware of?"
“Congratulations,” Cas said, laughing when Sam caught him in an enthusiastic hug.
“Fuck no,” Dean said, grinning at him. “Fuck, Cas, you just...you’re gonna make me cum way too fast if you keep that up.”
tell you to go because you'd be so much better off, but I
“Holy shit,” Dean breathed, resting his forehead against Cas’. “Fuck.”
But he couldn’t leave him behind.
“You been putting fucking ideas in your brother’s head,” John growled. “Making him think that he’s above where he came from. Making him think he’s
He carried the shotgun with him as he strode into the car, and the last thing Dean heard for awhile was the rev of the Impala’s engine.
, he thought, his heart fluttering in his chest as a big, ridiculous smile spread across his face.
“Grape jelly?” Cas asked, cocking his head.
“Yeah,” Cas had said and that fucking voice, that
“You’re so perfect,” Dean murmured, leaving a wet trail of kisses over every bit of Cas’ ass that he could reach. He ran his tongue over Cas’ balls, loving how the angel jumped and whimpered his name as he sucked first one, then the other.
“Not yet,” he finally managed to gasp. “Cas...need you.”
sorry. Please forgive me. Please don’t leave me. Please don’t leave again. I love you and I can’t take losing you again, Cas.”
. Even if I were to return, the demons would whisper behind my back.” He smiled, the cold, raw smile that always spoke of horrors to come. “But, if I were to make you pay...to really punish you, they would know that I have returned. That I am not someone to be trifled with or mocked.”
“You sure?” Dean asked, ignoring how stridently his body was begging for it. Fuck, nothing worked him up like getting Cas worked up.
“Fucking hell,” he breathed. “Of course I’d say it for the first time while you were balls-deep in me, Jesus fucking Christ.”
"No one except doctors says 'erection', Cas," he said.
Cas let out a breathy laugh as Dean unbuttoned his shirt and began to kiss down his chest. “Dean,” he rasped as Dean dragged his lips over one of his nipples. “The food will get cold.”
“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Dean said, squeezing Cas’ hands. “You didn’t
Nodding, Dean took a deep breath, staring into the stunning blue eyes of the man he loved. Fuck, Cas was trying so much to make him feel safe and secure and it was so much more than he'd ever imagined himself having with anyone. “I don’t deserve you, Cas!” Dean whispered, shoulders hunching as the panicky sob ripped up from some place deep and hidden within him. “Fuck, I wouldn’t deserve you if you were just some fucking guy off of the street, but you’re
“Well, hop in,” Dean said. “I don’t mind playing chauffeur for Mr. Big Shot Airman.” He jerked his head towards the back seat. “But Graduate gets shotgun.”
“I need to swing by home,” Dean said as they drove with the windows down. “I can drop you off at Bobby’s so you don’t have to see Dad-”
“I like holding you,” Cas said, brushing his lips over Dean’s cheek. “You have received so little comfort in your life, Dean. It is meaningful for me to take care of you, who so often takes care of others.”
“You are welcome to try,” Cas replied in a low, deadly voice that Dean managed to hear even through the ringing in his ears. This was a side of Castiel he had never seen before.
“Taste good to me,” Dean murmured, earning himself a quiet gasp. Fuck, how was it so easy?
?” A mocking edge crept into his voice. "Does he know how you'd cry and scratch your skin and call yourself worthless and pathetic and swear to yourself that it would be different next time?"
"I will
Cas blushed. “I have been working hard,” he said.
“Why would I do that?” Alastair asked, not taking his eyes off of Cas. “When he’s the one who stole you from me.”
“Couldn’t you find a trashy romance novel or something?” he teased, wincing at how rough his voice was. Inside his heart was pounding. If it was a djinn that had taken him...what did Cas remember?
“ALASTAIR NO!” Dean bellowed, thrashing in his chains.
“I will be once we are one,” Cas said and it was insane how easily something so fucking hot could be so sweet.
“C’mon, man,” he said. “You always make me use my words.”
“Yeah go ahead and stand up for him,” John said with an ugly smile. He suddenly closed the distance between them, reeking of whisky and stale cigarette smoke. “I should have beaten the shit out of him the first time he stayed over here. I saw how he fucking looked at you.”
“Come inside,” Cas asked quietly. “Please?”
The angel’s eyes were heavily lidded and his chest rose and fell quickly as his gorgeous eyes found Dean’s. “Not yet,” he panted. “Please...not yet. I don’t want it to end yet.”
Waconda Lake was quiet, the chilly November drizzle dissuading all but the most determined.
was alive again.
“You deserved better, Cas,” he said, reflexively tightening his hand on the little wooden box. “Better than going like that. Better than all your doubts. You deserved better than someone who was too chickenshit to admit how damn important you were. Are.” He took a shuddering breath, the words sticking in his throat. “You deserved better than me,” he rasped. “I’m sorry. For all of it. For all the times I treated you like shit. The times I doubted you. Yelled at you.” He clenched his eyes shut, thinking about the whole fiasco with Gadreel. “You deserved better than me throwing you out when you needed me. Fucking God damn it, Cas, you deserved better than all of it and I’m so fucking sorry that I never told you!”
His words cracked open Dean’s spirit as he echoed the thoughts that plagued Dean when he allowed himself to slow down enough to register them.
“Oh, he was mine,” Alastair said and Dean felt his stomach twist and writhe with shame and revulsion. “Weren’t you, pet?”
“Even if we’ve gotta keep it PG forever?” Dean asked, hearing the note of worry in his voice.
Dean swallowed hard and nodded, watching as Cas approached him slowly and reached for his hands. The angel’s were cool and gentle as they clasped Dean’s.
“No kidding,” Dean said wryly, earning himself a disgruntled huff and an eye roll.
“I am afraid he’s going to hurt you,” Cas whispered. “And the thought makes me ill.”
“I’ve got you, angel,” Dean replied, stroking his fingers through Cas’ hair. “You can let it go, Cas, you can let it go for me. Just relax, sweetheart, let it go.”
“You?” Cas said wryly, reaching out and taking Dean’s hands again, bringing them to his lips. “Dean, wait.”
“Let him go, Alastair,” Dean said, throttling down the surge of panic. As terrified as he’d been before, it was sinking down deeper into something far more primal and powerful. He could take whatever Alastair was gonna do to him. He could take it.
Alastair’s lip twitched, but his eyes didn’t leave Cas. “The things that I made him do,” he mused, holding the angel’s eyes. Cas’ narrowed in response and Dean saw his jaw clench. “The ways that he allowed himself to be used and degraded, it’s a wonder you could bear to touch something so base. So...
Cas let out a breathless laugh against his lips, shaking his head. “No,” he grunted, reaching down and grabbing behind Dean’s knee. He draped it over his elbow and kissed Dean again before thrusting hard and
“I like how your skin feels against mine,” Cas murmured against his lips before pulling away to kiss down Dean’s neck to his collarbone.
And fuck was he lost.
let Cas be hurt that way. He just couldn’t. Cas was the best thing in his life. The brightest, most pure, beautiful, incredible thing.
“Look who’s got jokes now,” Dean replied, nipping the underside of Cas’ jaw.
Dean felt his eyes widen. “Holy shit,” he breathed. “I...I had no idea that was today.”
“You have me,” Cas replied, his voice rough. He put one of his hands over Dean’s, his gorgeous eyes searching Dean’s. “I have always been yours, Dean.”
Cas complied instantly and Dean steadied him as he got comfortable. Once Cas was settled, Dean gently crossed the angel’s arms behind his back. “This feel ok?” he asked, rubbing Cas’ lower back.
Dean leaned in and flicked his tongue against Cas’ hole before dragging it around in a slow, firm circle. “This good?” he asked. “Or more?”
But the kiss remained slow.
don’t do this to him, Alastair. Please. I’ll do anything to make you happy, sir, please-”
Dean stared at Cas, feeling his jaw drop. "You're so goddamn sweet," he heard himself say. "Thoughtful. Fuck, Cas, I...I..." he let out a shuddering breath. "Yeah," he admitted. "Yeah, there are things. Most of them had kind of faded but after the djinn," he let out a bitter laugh. "They're probably gonna be front and center for awhile. Like getting...you know."
“Well isn’t this nice?”
He saw Cas’ head whip around and then there was that smile and Cas was moving quickly through the crowd, his broad shoulders back as he smiled that ridiculous, gummy, goofy smile. “Dean!”
“Cas!” he managed to gasp. “Cas! I’m gonna cum. Fuck, Cas, fuck you feel so fucking good baby just like that please-” and then he was jerking into Cas’ perfect mouth, his orgasm thundering over him like a stampede. He just barely managed to jerk his cock out of Cas’ mouth as the last few spasms washed over him, his eyes clenched tightly shut as he clung to his angel for dear life. He was still gasping for air when he opened his eyes, and he felt his cock jerk so hard it almost made his knees give out when he caught sight of his angel.
“I don’t recall saying that,” Cas said, and the brow was raised again as he gave Dean’s hair a firm tug.
“Is there a problem?” Rowena McLeod, the co-owner of The Pit asked, striding up and tossing her red hair back over her shoulder.
Trenchcoat.
They spent the rest of the night tangled up together, kissing, talking, and cuddling. And by the time they dragged themselves out of bed the next day Dean felt like an entirely new man. He did his best to keep his behavior reasonably normal around the others, though he couldn’t hide his excitement when their next case had taken them to Dodge City, Kansas. The thing between him and Cas felt too new to share, but not because of any fear it wouldn’t last or anything that plagued the start of a normal relationship. A relationship. With Cas. Fuck, what a fucking thought. No, after so much time without Cas, time where he’d thought he’d be without Cas forever...having him, having this just felt like something he wanted to hold onto, just for him, just for them, just for a little while longer.
.” Dean could hear the soft smile in his voice. “You are not broken.”
“How could I not, Dean?” Cas asked, running his fingers through Dean’s hair and smiling against his lips. “When I feel precisely the same about you?” He shook his head. “That a man so beautiful, so loving, and strong, and good could desire me, out of all creation...it’s humbling.”
And even if Dean couldn’t say the word, he could fucking
“I can stop,” Dean said and they both knew that he would if that was what Cas needed.
Cas looked at him, clearly confused. “Dean, I don’t-”
Wordlessly Dean draped his towel over the edge of the sink and reached across Cas to turn off the water. He caught Cas in a hug, surprising them both.
Dean swallowed the surge of emotion. He knew that Sam and Dad had had it out following Sam’s acceptance to Stanford (on a full ride, no less), but Dad had promised to come to graduation. It was a big deal. He’d promised Sam.
To his horror, the room around him was growing hazy and black.
“Where ‘m I?” Dean mumbled, trying to open his eyes and failing.
Cas nodded, his breath hot and wet against Dean’s lips. “Me too, Dean. Oh, Dean!”
He knew that he wasn’t hiding it. He knew Sam saw how he was drinking, how detached he was from...everything. He knew that Sam was worried.
He didn’t deserve to be saved. He didn’t deserve Cas’ presence in his life, much less the deep friendship the two of them had forged.
Something flickered in Cas’ eyes at that. Something old and dark and feral and
“Mine,” Dean managed to grit out as Cas’ eyes fluttered open.
Cas pulled Dean in for a kiss then, his strong, cool hands smoothing up and down Dean’s back as their bare chests pressed together.
“I…” Cas sighed. “I know that your family situation is difficult,” he said finally. “But I also don’t want to hide, Dean.” He pulled back a little and propped himself up on his elbow. “I am proud to love you, even if the world would judge me for it.”
Dean shook his hand off, a lifetime of conditioned fear warring with his anger. “You disrespected yourself,” he said finally. “And Sam. He just wanted you to see him walk, Dad, and you missed it.” He stepped back and turned towards the stairs, feeling as shitty as he had been feeling happy with Cas earlier.
for your release? When your spend still lay upon your skin and you had thanked me for taking such good care of my
Cas laughed quietly, the sound unbelievably comforting against Dean’s ear. “You are not self-absorbed enough to be Kuzco,” he said.
Taking a deep breath, Dean forced himself to stand and face his father, putting his body between John and Sam.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas gasped, even as he began to mimic Dean’s motions.
“No,” he growled, pulling Cas in for a kiss that was as rough and dirty as he could make it. “I’d ‘prefer’ you say that you were gonna fuck
Dean nodded, throttling down the surge of need that made him want to take Cas in hand hard and drive him relentlessly over the edge. “Like this,” he said softly, tightening his hand and beginning to stroke in a slow, easy rhythm.
“I’m good, for now,” Dean said with calm he most definitely did
“You first,” Dean replied, shocked at his own boldness as he let go of Cas and began to kiss and lick his way down the angel’s body. He was operating on pure instinct at this point. All he wanted was to make Cas feel good. To make him understand how important he was. How needed.
“You’re wrong,” Cas said. He reached up, cupping Dean’s cheeks and making him look into his eyes. “You are wrong, Dean.” His eyes, those gorgeous eyes were so full of love it stole Dean’s breath. “You deserve so much
Cas’ eyes widened. “You like it?” he asked shyly.
that you are," he said, blushing. "It just got me...made me that way too, knowing that you were into what we were doing and I..." he shivered. "After the djinn, feeling like that's just bringing back some stuff I'd rather forget and I-I just...I think I need to go slow, that’s all.”
They were quiet for a little while, Cas idly stroking over Dean’s forearm with his fingertips.
Dean felt his throat tighten, and reached up to squeeze Cas’ hands. “Thanks for that,” he managed to say. He took a deep breath. “Ready?”
“Good things do happen.”
Fuck, it was so much more than he deserved.
that is my
he prayed desperately, his eyes locked onto his angel's as they widened. He hated the fear he saw there, and even worse, the resignation.
who made you a laughingstock!” He swallowed hard, but his expression was a determined one. “Take
He flicked his tongue against the head of Cas’ cock, unable to keep from feeling a surge of satisfaction as Cas cried out and grabbed his hair with one hand. “Dean!”
“And then I get there and that fucking faggot is sitting in my place at the table like he has some kind of right-”
. “About what I said..."
They’d celebrated when they got home of course. Dean had cooked burgers for everyone, listening to the happy chatter with a huge, stupid smile on his face.
With anyone else, Dean would have made a joke, trying to diffuse the tension of the situation. But it was Cas, so Dean sat on the bed, tugging Cas down next to him. He motioned for the angel to continue, doing his best to keep his face neutral.
“Please take me, Dean!” Cas gasped. “As hard as you can. I want everything you can give me. I want you to take everything you want from me!”
“Get the fuck out of my house, Castiel!” John snarled, the belt dangling in his hand as the other balled into a heavy fist. “Or so help me, I will beat the shit out of you.”
“Yeah, and?” Dean asked mildly. He was at least going to make him work for it.
But when it did, Dean felt butterflies take off in his belly.
. “I...I was. But then I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that it sent me back.”
"Since I first laid eyes upon your soul," Cas said like it was obvious, looking into his eyes in that way that only
But it wasn't.
“Get in the car,” Cas ordered quietly.
“Still can’t believe you brought your own hat,” Sam said as Dean hung his stuff up.
, he thought as Alastair's hands slid up his shirt and pulled Dean against him more firmly.
that with you. I don’t want you to doubt that. I just...I don’t know if I can...if I’m ready.” He felt the panic settling in again, making his chest grow tight. Cas deserved so much
He’d filled out since Dean had last seen him, clearly having put on muscle. There was a new confidence to him as well, but most of all he looked, well, happy.
“I have waited since creation for you, Dean,” Cas said, his brows furrowing in that earnest expression that no one could do quite like him. “I am in no rush to jump into the physical. It is enough to know that you share my feelings.”
managed to say the words.
“The djinn ‘whammy’ is very potent,” Cas said making his stupid little air quotes. The sight warmed Dean’s heart. It was so adorkably Cas.
Dean was happy to oblige, and soon the two of them were moving together again, slowly building their pleasure back up.
By the time they had crawled into bed together, Dean was feeling content and sleepy. There was brief jockeying for position, but they wound up with Cas spooning him.
Cas was quiet for a moment, clearly gathering his thoughts before he began to speak. "I dislike the smell of laundromats," he said. "And while I know that Friday is an auspicious day for many humans, I still can't help but dread it."
Cas looked up at him with wide eyes. “You mean-”
But now he’d never see those brilliant eyes widen with surprise, or scrunch when Cas smiled that ridiculous gummy smile.
“Two,” Cas said, wriggling his knees a little wider.
“Of course!” the older man whose name tag said “Daniel” replied.
But Cas was kissing back.
Dean went sailing over the edge with his lover’s name on his lips, his whole body tightening and then releasing abruptly like an arrow fired from a bow. On top of him he felt Cas shudder and go still for a fraction of a second before he thrust into the hilt and crushed his lips to Dean’s, shuddering hard. He felt Cas’ cock pulse inside of him, he felt the warmth and heat and wetness and some abstract part of his brain thought that maybe he should find something wrong or repellent about the sensation.
Which he wouldn’t.
“Angel,” Dean breathed reverently.
He didn’t want to contemplate it too deeply, not as they said their goodbyes. Thinking through the loss could wait until he’d collected Cas’ ashes in a simple wooden box so that they wouldn’t leave any of him behind in this fucking place.
“I am teasing,” Cas said, his hands gently combing through Dean’s hair. His gorgeous eyes were shining as he looked up at Dean. “If my hope comes true and you and I are to make a go of this...we have all the time in the world. And if not?” He placed a tender kiss on Dean’s lips. “I will treasure the memory of tonight, even if you never so much as want to kiss me again.”
“Just
Dean watched his long, elegant fingers work for a moment before shaking himself out of it and shooting Cas a smile.
Dean swallowed hard, shaking his head. “But why me?” he asked. “Cas...You’re a medic, and officer in the Air Force! You’re brilliant and, and going places and me?” He let out a bitter laugh. “I’ve got a GED, a give-em-hell attitude, and that’s it. I’m just a dumb piece of trash from Kansas and I-”
caught him. “Cas! You Fell because of me, you lost everything because of me. I don't deserve you, angel. I don't fucking deserve you and I'm so scared that one day you're gonna realize that I'm not worth the trouble and I'm gonna lose you for good." He was clinging to the angel so hard that his hands hurt and his face was wet with tears, but somehow he managed to force himself to pull back enough that he could look into those fathomless eyes. "And I'm not as selfless as you, Cas. I'm not and I
It was then that Cas struck.
He didn’t know how long he sat there letting the gently lapping water and wind console him, but eventually when his throat was raw and his head was pounding, he rose. He threw the other half of the sandwich into the lake, then poured in the second beer. Then, with hands that shook, he opened the little box.
it. He slapped around over at his bedside table until he found the drawer pull and yanked it open, reaching inside and pulling out the little bottle of lube. “Should probably use this.”
Dean heard the sob rip out of him because he was fucking
“You are very quiet for all of your brashness a moment ago,” Cas teased. He reached up and caressed Dean’s face before letting his hand fall to the hollow of Dean’s throat. “You forget who rebuilt you,” he said, eyes widening for a moment before he was kissing Dean again, the motion of his hips speeding up.
Assuming he could work up the nerve.
“You will not touch him again,” Cas said and only the way his hands clenched into fists at his sides betrayed his tension.
The song wound down and Dean pulled back to look down at his partner. Tears were trickling down the angel’s face, but Dean didn’t have to ask to know that they were tears of joy. He wiped them away with his thumbs as he cupped Cas’ cheeks and gently and tilted his face up for a kiss.
“What the fuck is he doing in my seat?” John growled, glaring at Cas.
Dean felt his hips rocking as he slurped up and down Cas’ cock, letting the angel’s words wash over him. Fuck, he wanted Cas, he wanted all of it, like he’d never wanted anyone in his whole life.
He was back in his room in the bunker the next time he opened his eyes. He was in his most comfortable PJs and covered with a heavy comforter. Cas was sitting at Dean’s desk reading, his trench coat draped over the back of the chair and his shirtsleeves rolled up. It was oddly...domestic and Dean had to smile when he saw the title of the book.
“You are,” Cas said firmly. He ran the back of his knuckles over Dean’s cheeks. “The freckles that dust your skin like stars in the heavens.” He reached down, trailing his fingertips over one of the many scars on Dean’s forearms. “The scars that denote your strength and resilience.” His eyes met Dean’s, the warmth in them taking Dean’s breath away. “Your eyes the color of spring, which could not be more perfect for a man as
He saw the same thought in Sam’s eyes as they’d driven.
Dean was approaching the precipice faster than he could recall ever having done so in his life and Cas was egging him on with ridiculously sexy moans around him and it took everything Dean had to grab Cas’ hair and pull him back.
“Amazing the things that keep them close to us,” Daniel said with an understanding smile. “My Anita loved lavender candles, I always hated them. Said it smelled like grandma.” He gave a soft, sad laugh. “Now I can’t stop burning them. Makes me feel like she’s just in the other room.”
“I’m not-”
“Thank you,” Cas replied, his tone so sincere and almost reverent that Dean had to slide up his body and kiss him again. He let the angel help him out of his pajama pants and boxers and sighed happily at the feeling of their bodies pressing together.
There was no
“Does it really matter?” Alastair asked, rising.
He throttled down the absurd hope that it was real.
How could it be real?
Dean jerked his head in a nod and gave Cas’ hair a tug, his knees going weak at the way Cas melted back onto him, utterly pliant and willing and so fucking perfect.
“Did you want me to stop?” he asked mildly.
“Where do you wanna cum?” Dean asked in the most breathy, over the top sultry voice he could muster.
“I do,” Dean said, his feet carrying him forward of their own accord. He caught Cas in a hug, his throat all but closing at the familiar scent of old-growth cedar in winter and ozone as Cas’s arms went around him. “Welcome home, pal.”
"I refuse to call it a 'boner'," Cas said, air quotes and all. "The name makes no sense. Humans are not dogs or raccoons. There are no bones in the human-"
“Thanks for that,” Sam said to Rowena, who gave him an evaluating look that made Sam blush.
“Let’s see if you still feel that when we’re done,” Alastair said, sounding amused.
“Fuck you, Alastair,” Dean gritted out, desperately trying to seem less terrified than he was.
“Think you’ll be able to hold it?” Dean asked, allowing a note of challenge into his voice. “Or should I tie you up?”
“Thanks for that,” Dean said, his heart suddenly so full of emotion he felt his throat start to burn. Fuck, it had always been like this. Cas had always made him feel so safe. It felt like Cas cared. “But it’s all right. I’m gonna drive around for a bit, give the old man time to fall asleep, then head home. He’ll have forgotten by the morning.”
Just then, his phone buzzed and Dean yanked it out of his pocket, expecting to see a voicemail from his father.
“Yes,” Cas whispered and it was then that Dean realized he’d said the last part out loud. “Always.”
Cas was alive and back and wanted him and damn if he was going to let anything take that away.
“Please!” Cas rasped. “Dean!”
Cas’ eyebrow went up almost to his hairline as he cocked his head and Dean felt a shudder travel from the crown of his head down his spine. “Just do it?” the angel rumbled, his voice dropping lower and getting quieter.
Cas smiled at him, leaning into his touch for a moment before tilting his chin up and opening his mouth, letting his tongue stick out just enough to be more than a little pornographic.
“Shhhh,” Dean said, hoping that he was sounding every bit as infuriatingly patient as Cas always did. He shifted a little for a better angle and then eased back in, not pausing until he’d found that bundle of nerves with his fingertips. “I’ve got you,” he said, running his fingers over it.
to say. “I’m gonna have to go back eventually.”
“Dean?” Cas said.
“You got it, baby,” Dean said before pressing them against Cas’ hole, stroking in a slow circle before easing his fingers in. He fucking
“My knees are not cooperating,” Cas said, sounding adorably grumpy.
“One day you will see yourself as I do,” Cas said against his lips.
am what you want?”
Dean smiled wearily at him, knowing that once the festivities were done he’d go home. It was better to deal with it than let John stew.
was alive.
"You are here with me, love," Cas said, taking a tentative step towards him. "You're in the Bunker. You're home. You are safe."
The laugh faded with a gasp as Cas’ hand went to Dean’s cheek and his lips pressed gently back against Dean’s. The kiss was slow, so slow and so unbelievably sweet, and by the time they pulled back, Dean was breathing like he’d sprinted a mile.
“Everywhere,” was the snarled reply and Dean felt a whole swarm of butterflies in his belly.
He pressed his lips to Cas’ gently, allowing himself to luxuriate in the softness of those full lips even as he gave the angel a chance to pull away.
you are?” he asked. Fuck, that sounded so lame after what Cas had said.
Cas snorted. “I think I will be better at holding it than
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” Cas said firmly.
Dean froze, his heart climbing into his mouth at the sound of his father’s voice.
Bobby’s house was where Cas stayed when he was home on break from basic training and later leaves.
Cas welcomed him eagerly, moaning quietly as their tongues twined together. The sound was adorable, and hot, and they were both breathing hard when they broke the kiss and pulled back.
“Hello, Dean.”
He’d poured a round of drinks, of course. But the smell reminded him too much of the dark, lonely weeks. The coffee was better. It tasted like morning and the promise of a new day.
“He’s family,” Cas said firmly.
“You have a lot of nerve,” John said, taking a few shambling steps towards him. “After how you fucking behaved yesterday. Never been so humiliated in my life.”
for me, who believed in me, who sacrificed and
“You want it hard, Cas?” he asked, both because he wanted to be sure and because hearing Cas’ voice so utterly wrecked and desperate was driving him wild.
because every time you're gone I fucking miss you so goddamn much."
“You can stay with me tonight, boy,” Bobby said, clapping his shoulder. “Give John time to cool down.”
“Talking isn’t what I was thinking of,” Cas said, his voice low and gravelly.
“You are precious to me,” Cas said, sliding out and leaving Dean feeling empty and aching. “I want this to be pleasant for you.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, grinning at him. “Fuck yeah. Just...go slow, ok?”
They kissed again and while it started slow, soon Dean was pressing Cas against the door with one of his thighs between Cas’, his hands furiously working to unbutton Cas’ shirt as Cas’ hands worked at Dean’s belt. He shoved the shirt from Cas’ shoulders as Cas sent his belt flying across his room and he heard his desperate laugh as Cas yanked Dean’s shirt over his head and threw it to the floor.
Dean shifted with a groan, feeling every inch of his body protest the action. He came awake in an instant at the sensation of something cold and hard on his wrists.
Guilt.
Dean swallowed past the lump in his throat, reaching across to cup Cas’ cheek. “You are so damn cute,” he said, shaking his head.
“Cas,” he said, coming to a stop. “Look at me.”
And then his phone had rung and when he’d answered it his heart had leapt to his throat.
“And what are you going to do about it?” John asked, turning and taking a step towards her. He towered over the redhead, who looked up at him with a bland customer service smile.
“Your influence entirely,” Cas said, tilting his chin up. “And you don’t need to-”
Dean had been Cas’ first call when Joshua had passed away.
"DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH HIM!" Dean bellowed as they stood in a circle around Cas just as they used to with him.
“Extra round on us,” Fergus said, appearing at Dean’s elbow. “And perhaps a complimentary order of spinach and artichoke dip?” His dark eyes were sparkling as he glanced after John. “Always nice to let mother off-leash,” he murmured.
Dean pulled back, forcing himself to take a deep breath. Touching Cas this way was driving him every bit as crazy, and the thought of just hilting himself in his angel made him almost dizzy with lust.
“I’m yours too, Cas,” he said and the way Cas smiled at him filled his heart with so much joy and lightness it was as though it was taking flight.
“I want to,” Dean said firmly. “In fact...I think I’d like to try something, if you’re up for it.”
who freed Dean from Hell! It was
“Cas!” Fuck, the angel was a fast learner. His hand was firm, but gentle, and when he brushed his thumb through the bead of wetness at the tip of Dean’s cock, Dean whimpered and reached down to grab his wrist.
“Stay with me!” Cas burst out. “It’s a double queen, Dean. Just...stay here and give John time to cool down.” His hand rose from its usual place at Dean’s shoulder to cup his cheek and in that instant both of them froze.
“How should I prepare you?” Cas asked and Dean found himself blushing all the way down to his chest.
“I love you,” Cas whispered in time with the song.
Dean rolled over with a grumble, reaching for Cas. When his hands encountered only pillows, he admitted defeat and opened his eyes. Cas was standing in the doorway watching him, a fond smile on his face. In his hands he had a tray, and Dean blinked at the sight of a vase filled with daffodils and one enormous sunflower whose petals were shot through with red.
Dean smiled at him, feeling a little flutter of nerves in his belly. “Keep your hands up there,” he said. “Until I tell you to move them.”
He reached up and tangled his fingers in Cas’ hair, jerking the other man’s head back and making Cas’ eyes narrow. “I want you to fuck me, Cas,” he said, feeling his cheeks grow warm.
"I have you, Dean," Cas was murmuring. "I have you. You are home and safe and more loved than I could begin to express." He repeated the simple phrases over and over like a litany, rubbing Dean's back as his heart finally began to slow.
And Alastair was nothing but darkness.
Cas’ eyes narrowed and he growled something into the gag. There was pure murder in his eyes, but Alastair seemed unphased as he jerked the gag out.
Suddenly the cold of the knife was gone and Alastair was striding away from him to a dark corner of the room. Dean heard the sound of chains rattling and Alastair’s quiet chuckle. He muttered a few words in a language that Dean didn't recognize and the sound that followed made Dean’s blood run cold.
But this wasn’t about him.
But he didn’t want to.
“Cas,” Dean rasped, reaching up and caressing the angel’s cheek. “We don’t...I didn’t…”
They’d lost people before. So many people. Fuck, they’d lost Cas before.
He felt Daniel’s eyes on him as the man handed him the jelly. “I’m sorry for your loss.”
He saw those stunning eyes widen just for a second with something that almost looked like hope. “Your heart?” he whispered.
do this not for me. Just go.” He tried to smile and caught a glimpse of himself in the window. Tears, blood, and snot had combined on his face and he had the makings of florid black eyes. He looked fucking awful, but as bad as he looked and felt, he knew that it’d be 1000 times worse if Cas got hurt because of him.
It was as though someone had thrown cold water over him.
“It’s Cas!” Dean said, looking around wildly.
“Wiseass,” Dean grumbled, leaning down and kissing him hard. “I mean it, Cas,” he said, not taking his lips off of his partner’s. “I need you to know what you are to me. How meeting you changed me.”
“Fucking fuck, Castiel,” Dean whimpered, putting his hand over where Cas’ rested at his throat. “Fuck yes, fuck YES!” Every thrust was hitting that perfect spot and Dean could feel that tight heat spooling up in his belly. “Cas I’m close. I’m so fucking close, Cas, please!”
Fuck, it felt good.
“He didn’t like jam,” Dean managed to choke out. “Said it was unsettling.”
It was only when the angel's eyes widened fractionally that Dean realized that he was praying.
him, oh, they hurt. But the
for the simple violence of the pit, Dean. Because what you and I are going to share today...it’ll make the fun we had seem like a picnic.”
“Fine,” Sam said with exaggerated brightness. “Glad that I moved out.” His heavy brow narrowed. “You?”
But of course Sam had pushed.
“No, Cas,” Dean said, pulling back and looking into the angel’s eyes. They were dark and unfathomable, like the ocean in the eye of a hurricane. “No, you don’t get it, man. I
But he forced it down.
He’d gone out one day a few weeks later, needing to escape Sam’s worry. The store seemed safe enough. They needed more whisky anyway.
“Join us,” Dean said firmly, squaring his shoulders.
Everything that had been done to him?
“You’re not so bad yourself,” he replied, tightening his arms around his angel.
He didn’t talk much once he’d returned, instead sitting in the corner of the library where he and Cas liked to sit and share a drink after the others had gone to bed. He didn’t cook. Didn’t eat really.
Dean focused on doing the things that he enjoyed when getting head, having no prior experience giving it to fall back on, and spent the first few minutes teasing, slowly kissing his way up and down until Cas’ hands were threaded through his hair and the angel was rocking his hips.
He never did.
Dean recognized the tone and choked down his terror and rage. He had to play this right if he was going to protect Cas. He was bound too securely to escape and rage and threats had never in thirty years been enough to give Alastair so much as pause. It would have to be guile. It would have to be, he realized with revulsion, submission. “Please,” he whispered, dropping his eyes. His skin crawled at how easily he was able to tap back into the submissive behavior that Alastair preferred. But it didn't matter.
Cas was clinging to him now, his body molded against Dean’s as they moved together. It wasn’t an elegant dance, but as Dean leaned his head on top of Cas’, he couldn’t help but feel that didn’t matter.
“I’m so close, Dean,” Cas whimpered.
“Did Dean tell you my favorite thing to do to him during our time together?” Alastair said as he finished by cutting away Cas’ shirt and underwear, leaving the angel naked.
"I am beginning to wonder if it was the sound of your voice that constituted the real torture in Hell," Cas said and then he fucking
and in an instant Dean was hard as well and-
different. “Cas!” he breathed, rocking his hips. Fuck, he wanted more. He
Dean went still, giving Cas a worried look.
Dean stared down at his phone, his jaw dropping.
To answer, Cas pulled away a little and restarted the song. “Please?” the angel asked, cocking his head.
Sweet merciful fuck his head hurt.
Cas let out a quiet chuckle, pulling back to look up at him. When he did, the wild adoration in his expression took Dean’s breath away. Now it was Cas’ turn to brush Dean’s tears away as the angel gave him a soft smile.
“Roll over,” Dean said, pulling back.
He was going around and around and around himself in his head when one of Cas’ hands slid down from his hair and tilted his chin up.
“I don’t want to cause trouble,” Cas said, half rising before Sam put a hand on his arm and stopped him.
A shotgun racking.
Dean felt like he couldn’t catch his breath as he watched John’s face get redder and redder. His mouth worked, spittle forming at the corners. When he spoke it was so loud that it silenced the immediate area.
Cas hesitated. “Please forgive me,” he murmured. “But given my medical training, I overruled Sam and Bobby’s attempts to keep you out of the hospital. You needed imaging.”
The demon was sitting in a straight backed chair a few feet away, a cold smile on his face.
“I know,” Dean said, silencing him with a kiss. He laughed quietly, earning himself a questioning look from the angel. “I mean...you can hurt me sometimes, if you know what I mean.”
“You got wool in your ears boy?” John asked, taking a few steps down the stairs. “Get the fuck out of here, or I’m gonna blow you sky high and bury you in the back forty.” He sneered. “It’s not like there’s anyone who’s gonna miss you.”
“Dork,” Dean said, unable to keep from smiling. “All the children’s programming out there and you gotta reference 'Barney'?”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he whispered. The words he wanted to say wouldn’t come, nor would the words that he knew he
“Come with me,” Cas said, reaching out and taking his hand. “Sam is leaving, Bobby has Rufus, you can have your own life, Dean.” His eyes grew cold. “Where I can protect you from
“I’ll see you again before you head back to D.C., right?” Sam asked Cas.
He felt Cas frown before he saw it and the angel broke the kiss to pull back and squint at him. “What do you mean?” he asked.
“I missed you too, Dean,” Cas said, his voice low and gentle.
Dean shuddered, grinning up at the angel. “You fucking tease,” he said. “Why don’t we get cleaned up and we can test the theory.”
than me, Dean. I am flawed and often foolish and, as I am often reminded, awkward.” He rose up on his knees, kissing Dean’s cheek. “You deserve the entire cosmos, love, and I swear to you I will spend my life attempting to give it to you.” He leaned in, resting his forehead against Dean’s. “I see you, Dean Winchester, and I adore you, for all that you are, have ever been, and ever shall be.”
Cas had seen that and still somehow could look at him the way he always did?
“You’re gonna make me cry, you big dork,” Dean growled before claiming Cas’ lips in a furious kiss.
“Please don’t stop!” Cas gasped. “Dean, I need you, please!”
“He was just leaving,” Sam said.
“Your mouth is perfect, Dean,” Cas moaned, beginning to ease in and out. “Never, in all of my lifetime, did I imagine anything could feel so good. I love watching you open for me, whether it’s your lips or your sweet hole. I love how you move, how you sound, I love how you whimper and beg when I touch you after you’ve cum-” he gasped as Dean moaned around him. “Dean!”
Sweet merciful fuck.
“Cas,” Dean whispered. He climbed up onto one of the rickety folding chairs, hoping that it would hold his weight. “CAS!”
“Better to deal with it, Sammy,” Dean said with his best attempt at a smile.
"An erection," Cas said seriously and Dean couldn't help but let out a weak laugh.
Throughout it all, he kept his wrists crossed over his head. Dean reached up and grabbed them with one hand, allowing more of his weight to fall on the angel, pinning him to the bed so that he could grind against Cas.
Fuck, no one had ever seen him as clearly as Cas did.
“You are as beautiful as you were when I reformed your body,” Cas said out of nowhere and fuck if Dean didn’t turn bright red.
“Fuck yeah!” Dean moaned as Cas thrust into him hard enough that his back arched up off the bed. “Fuck, Cas, fuck just like that!”
Cas was so fucking good to him.
And unbelievably, when he met Cas' eyes, the angel shot him the tiniest smile. It was there for only an instant, making his crows feet flicker into existence and disappear.
Dean stared out at the gray water for a long minute before climbing out of the car and going around to the trunk.
"CAS!" Dean struggled against his restraints as Cas made a visible effort to calm his breathing, glaring into Alastair's eyes.  “Alastair, please,” Dean begged, desperate to draw the demon's attention away from his angel. “Please,
“You’re not going anywhere,” Alastair said with some amusement. He closed the distance between them and Dean flinched at his sudden proximity. “We have a lot of catching up to do, Dean.” He pulled a heavy knife from his waist, bringing it up to Dean’s cheek with a cold smile.
feel. Turnabout was fair play. “I could do this all day.”
Dean felt goosebumps on his arms. “Oh yeah?” he challenged like his heart wasn’t pounding.
“CASTIEL!” John roared again and then there was another sound, one that made Dean’s blood run cold.
Cas let out a breathless laugh. “Forgive me,” he rasped. “It was more difficult than I thought.”
than him. Surely the angel was gonna realize that. He looked down. “I’m sorry.”
How loved.
“As you wish,” Cas replied, slowly withdrawing. He picked up Dean’s discarded shirt from the floor and wetted it, cleaning them up with as much tenderness as he’d shown earlier before crawling back into bed with Dean and pulling him in for a kiss. “Well?” Cas asked as they tangled their legs together. His heart was in his eyes as they met Dean’s. “What do you think?” he asked shyly.
“Dean I need-”
“Let me stow my bag,” Cas said abruptly. “And then why don’t I come home with you?”
But he knew in his heart that if he had to watch Alastair subject Cas to even a fraction of what he’d done to Dean, it would break him.
But fuck his head was spinning and he staggered to a knee at the entrance to the kitchen, blinking past the blood that trickled down over his face. John’s steel-toed boot connected with his side and Dean cried out, curling around the injury as he struggled futilely to protect himself. “Stop!” he gasped, trying to get to his hands and knees. He was a grown-ass man, he didn’t have to-
“You’re here to drag me back to the pit?” Dean gritted out as the knife pressed close enough to draw blood.
Gritting his teeth, Dean glared at the demon. He had to find a way to get out. He couldn’t be here. He
He leaned down and breathed over Cas’ cock, loving how it jerked and leaked. Cas’ soft hiss of need as Dean licked the wetness off his belly made him smile and look up at his partner.
“That’ll happen,” Dean replied, giving him a soft kiss that so easily turned into the two of them flush against one another, tongues twining around each other as their hands gently explored. Dean grunted as Cas brushed his hand over his cock and caught Cas’ wrist. “Let me get you first,” he said firmly. He gave a self-deprecating little laugh. “I’m not gonna need much to go over the edge, babe.”
“You have gotten tense again,” Cas said gently. “And your heart rate is elevated.” He looked down, running his thumb over the bottom of Dean’s jaw. “Please talk to me.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas murmured and then the angel was in his arms again holding him tightly. “I’m here,” Cas whispered, his breath soft and warm on Dean’s neck.
“How are you feeling?” Cas asked, putting the book down on the desk and leaning forward, resting his forearms on his knees.
“Holy shit, Cas,” Dean said, staring at him wonderingly. “Is that really…” he swallowed hard. “Is that something you’d really want?”
“I’m yours, Cas,” Dean said. “Just a little longer, ok?”
, Dean thought, the absolute absurdity of the statement making something click into place in his brain. It
“Does that make you Sméagol?” Cas asked, cocking his head.
But as he looked into those gorgeous eyes, he knew.
“Fuck, you’re so good to me,” Dean growled, switching to the other side before sucking another mark just over Cas’ ribs. He made his way down like that, kissing, nibbling, and biting, leaving little red marks from his teeth that faded quickly, and darker ones that would stick with Cas unless he mojoed them away.
“No, Dad,” he heard himself gasp. "please..."
mattered except keeping Alastair away from Cas. “Please...sir. I’ll do whatever you want me to do. Anything you say. Just please don’t-”
Before Dean could reply, Cas had slipped between his legs and then
When Dean opened up his mouth to argue, Cas held up his hand. “I will stay in the car if you prefer,” he said. “But I cannot let you go back to that house alone.”
“Yes,” Cas said immediately. “Please, Dean!”
“Cas!” Bobby said and instantly Cas’ expression was all sunshine again.
It felt final.
“Dean is
as the first had been sweet.
“You drive?” Dean asked.
He felt Cas shrug beneath him. “You enjoy taking care of the people around you, particularly by feeding them. And you are very handsome.”
“It was when I made his body betray him.”
his mouth, his fucking mouth was so hot and wet and tight around him and whatever Cas lacked in experience he more than made up for in enthusiasm and determination.
Cas wiped the tears away with a snort of laughter, shaking his head. “As long as you meant it,” he said, mostly managing to hide the hint of a question.
“I’m sor-”
When he gathered the nerve to look into Cas’ eyes again, he was startled to see that they were shining with unshed tears. “Like you’ve found a home?” Cas whispered and it was only then that Dean realized he’d said it.
Sam was in the middle of an animated description of his freshman classes when he suddenly fell silent, his eyes going wide for a fraction of a second before the shutters came down.
as Cas nuzzled beneath his chin. “I love you too, Dean,” Cas said, his voice so low that Dean almost missed it.
“Who…” Cas’ adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, watching Dean kiss slowly down until his lips were brushing over the head of Cas’ cock through his boxer-briefs. “Who am I to gainsay you?” he finally rasped. “Dean!” he groaned as Dean dragged the flat of his tongue over where a wet spot was already forming.
, tilting his head with a soft little sigh so that their lips might press together a little more firmly. One of his arms went around Dean’s shoulders as his other hand slid up into Dean’s hair. The angel pressed against him firmly and when his lips parted against Dean’s he whispered one word.
Dean nodded, dropping his eyes. He really fucking hated to say the next part, but in the spirit of the work Cas was clearly trying to ease him into doing, it needed to be said. "I hate having cum on me, Cas," he said, figuring it was better just to say it plainly. "Mine or anyone else's. I fucking hate it and if you wanna see me go off the deep end, that'll do it."
fucking be here. He couldn’t do this again.
Tainted.
Dean snorted and pulled Cas down onto the bed, rolling on top of him as he kissed the angel hard.
Cas was home.
It was all there all the time.
Dean took a sip of coffee, letting out a pleased sigh. “I’m always down to celebrate,” he said, raising an eyebrow. “What’s the occasion?”
John Winchester was dead.
Dean nodded and groaned when Cas moved lower, nipping Dean’s skin. “I love how you taste,” Cas said, licking over the spot where had used his teeth.
“That your dad?” Bobby asked, raising a bushy eyebrow.
The older man nodded, handing him his bags, and Dean beat a hasty retreat from the store.
Dean kissed him tenderly before he pushed off his partner and gently took hold of his wrists, pushing them up over his head slowly, giving Cas time to stop him if he wanted to. “I want to give you the best orgasm of your life,” he said bluntly, loving how it made Cas’ breath catch and his eyes widen. “But since today’s a special day, I want to spice it up a little. So,” he leaned in and kissed Cas’ wrist. “I’ve got a challenge for you.”
He nodded, gesturing to the jar. “Cas...apart from whisky and bourbon...peanut butter and grape jelly is about all I’ve been able to eat since you...since Lucifer...since I-I
Cas. It was Cas. It was his angel.
Cas’ eyes were shining as the smile went from one of relief to that enormous, gummy smile. “I love you too, Dean,” he said before kissing him again.
He carried the box, two beers, and the sandwich down to the shore, finding a bench and laying his coat down. He sat, resting the box on one knee and the sandwich on the other. He took a bite of his half of the sandwich, the sticky sweetness of the concord jelly making his gorge rise. He forced it down anyway, then chased it with his beer as he stared out at the glassy surface of the water.
“You were brave standing up to your father,” Cas said to Sam, his brilliant eyes filled with worry. “I am only sorry to have caused trouble.”
The angel was bound with warded handcuffs and chains, a warded gag in his mouth. His face was streaked with grime and his normally pristine white dress shirt was torn and stained with blood. His dark slacks were torn on his right thigh, revealing a deep laceration that still oozed blood.
and all he ever did was get people he cared about hurt or worse. “I hate how often you’ve been hurt because of me!” he blurted out, staggering a step forward. Cas caught him. Cas
He eased out of his partner and lubed himself up quickly before giving his hands a quick wash and bringing a damp towel over for later. He balanced over Cas, looking down into his eyes. “You good?” he asked, shaking with the effort of not just slamming into the angel’s tight heat.
He paused, blowing a soft puff of air just to make Cas hiss and then gently nudged Cas’ legs a little wider.
“Please, Alastair,” Dean begged, his breath coming in ragged sobs. “Please don’t do this. Please take me. I'll do anything, I'll do anything you want just
“I don’t even know what to say,” Sam said.
“I don’t deserve you,” Dean said, pulling back and looking into Cas’ eyes. “Fuck, Cas, how can you feel that way about me when I’m so god damn broken?”
Cas smiled up at him, and the heat in the smile made Dean’s cock twitch. “I would not object,” he said, cocking his head. “You know that I enjoy the feeling of your cum on me.”
"I'll remember," Cas said, squeezing his hand.
“Dean,” Cas whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “You didn’t have to-”
“Please!” Cas’ voice was rough and desperate, and it filled Dean with warmth and more than a little pride.
Sam dropped his eyes, but not before Dean saw him smile. “Yeah,” Sammy said, turning away to shut the closet doors. “Fair enough.”
“Dad, you’re drunk,” Sam said, glaring at the salt and pepper shakers. “Go home.”
The thought gave Dean a little pang because the fact was, Cas was Dean’s best friend apart from Sammy. He had been ever since Cas had caught him drinking in the church graveyard one night when he was seventeen, following a bad fight with John.
Memories of how the pain had twisted into pleasure, how he’d allowed it.
Cas was pure. Good. Light incarnate.
Dean’s retort died on his lips as he blushed.
John let out a mirthless laugh, shaking his head. “You piece of shit,” he hissed.
,” he finished coldly. “Not to the old drunk who knocked up my mom.”
The drizzle made its way down the back of his collar, but Dean ignored it as he rifled through his grocery bags. The tears had started again, mixing with the rain water as he made himself a PB&J. He cut it in half and then set it aside, pulling out the little box with what remained of the man who had been his best friend and, he was finally allowing himself to admit, so much more.
“Just because I choose not to employ invective as frequently as you do,” Cas said wryly. “Does not mean that I don’t know what the words mean.”
“Who said I don’t?” Dean asked, taking hold of Cas’ waist and pulling him closer. He leaned in and kissed the angel’s neck and heard Cas’ breath catch and fuck if the sound wasn’t sexy as hell.
“It’s damn good of you to come out for Sam,” Bobby said, clapping Cas on the shoulder.
Cas was making soft little gasping sounds into the pillows, his hands clenched tightly behind his back as Dean set a slow, steady rhythm.
and Dean saw fucking stars as Cas did it again and again and again and when he worked up the courage to look into Cas’ eyes again he wasn’t surprised to see that the angel was watching him, his lips curled into a hungry smile. “Like
Like the fact that hearing Cas describe what he was thinking about doing in his vaguely clinical terms drove him crazy.
Tears streamed down his face as he shoved the groceries in the trunk, and absurdly he found that he couldn’t put the stupid jelly in the trunk where Cas’ ashes still sat in their little wooden box. Instead he put it in the front seat next to him as he threw the car into gear and pealed out of the grocery store parking lot. He drove south, not really paying attention to where he was going until he pulled into the tiny state park parking lot.
Cas’ answering snarl made goosebumps rise up on Dean’s skin as the angel shoved him back against the wall, pressing his body flush against Dean’s. His stubble rasped against Dean’s skin as the angel kissed out to his ear, catching his earlobe in his mouth. “Say it again,” he rumbled.
“You’re welcome to join me,” Cas said quietly. “We don’t have to do anything,” he hurried to add. “I just thought it might be nice.”
“It’s ok, love,” Cas said gently. “It’s just me.”
Alastair caressed Dean’s cheek and stepped in close, his lips pressing hard against Dean’s.
Dean stepped closer, bringing his other hand up to cup Cas’ cheeks as he leaned in and gave him a slow, soft kiss. He felt Cas’s lips part as the angel let out a quiet gasp. Cas’ arms were gentle when they slid around him as the kiss deepened and Dean found himself pressing his body against the angel’s, clinging to him as though he would be taken away at any second. He lost himself in the sensation of Cas’ body against him and the tender way Cas was rubbing his back and the way Cas’ tongue gently caressed his and then, fuck, Cas was hard against him, hard for
“Don’t you talk about him like that!” Dean snapped, clenching his hands into fists. “Castiel was there because Sam
water when Cas hit the back of his throat, and above him the angel moaned.
?” he heard himself squeak.
Dean’s throat was too dry for him to respond for a moment. John Winchester had to be the only person in town who didn’t like Castiel.
Wordlessly, Dean put his hand over Cas’. “You worry too much,” he managed to say with something like a smile.
“Still good?” he asked mildly.
They were quick to get out of the parking lot -- Dean had endured Bobby’s bitching to park half a mile away close to the exit. It meant that they got to The Pit, the local upscale BBQ place run by, of all things, a Scottish man and his mother. The interior was well-designed, somehow managing to combine rustic and industrial with shining wooden booths, heavy iron accents, and bright, unshaded lights hanging in mason jars of varying sizes.
“Yeah,” Dean rasped. “Sucks.” He swallowed and looked down at his hands, uncertain of what to say. “Cas, I...I”
away. He repeated the action over and over until the box was empty, then went to the trunk and got a shovel. He buried the box at the base of the willow tree by the water, then stood looking out over the lake.
“Dean-”
you.”
“Castiel showed up for my graduation,” Sam said coldly. Fuck, he was always so much braver with their dad than Dean was. “Not just the party where there’s booze. He’s welcome, you’re not.”
Cas blushed, his eyes flicking down, and Dean shook his head. “You are,” he said firmly. He leaned down and kissed Cas’ hip bone, grazing it with his teeth to make his partner hiss. “You’re gorgeous,” he said, sucking a hickey into the soft, smooth skin and loving how Cas hissed above him. “And sexy,” he kissed closer to center, following it with his tongue, then his teeth. “And fucking perfect for me,” he growled into the other hip bone, swirling his tongue over it.

“I would never hurt you, Dean,” Cas said, sliding up his body and kissing him hard. “Never. Never, never, never, never-”
you to keep going.”
Bobby’s eyes widened. “I thought he was stationed over at Andrews in D.C.”
“Are you sure?” Cas asked and Dean felt his heart about burst.
It startled a bark of laughter out of Dean. "That too," he said, running his free hand through his hair. "But A...
“Tired,” Dean admitted. “Fucking sore. Getting too old for that shit.”
“Sweet merciful fuck, Cas,” Dean whimpered, a shudder going through his body. “Stop talking and just do it!”
Cas blinked for a moment, then blushed. “I said my heart and body are yours,” he said softly. “And that I will treasure you for all time.” He let out a little laugh. “It probably sounded dirtier in Enochian.”
The burgers were good, but he’d barely tasted his, watching as Cas smiled that ridiculous gummy smile at something Jack had said. He found himself smiling so hard his cheeks hurt and ignoring the way that Sam was watching him sip his coffee.
“Tell you what,” Dean said against his angel’s lips. “Since I forgot our ‘anniversary’, why don’t you let me give you a little something right here, right now?”
And deep in the back of his mind, he heard that voice, his father’s voice, jumping to mock him and disparage the thing that was happening between him and Cas.
“Take me into your mouth, Dean,” Cas said. “And look at me so that I can watch your eyes water when my cock hits the back of your throat.”
Sam had commented on it once, though his tone told Dean that his brother knew what he was doing and was trying to give him a chance to talk about it if he wanted.
Grape jelly.
“Knowing that I am
"Fuck, Cas, I'm so sorry," Dean managed to choke out through the lump in his throat.
“I assume we should not do that in a communal space,” Cas said, startling a bark of laughter out of Dean.
Perpetually mussed dark hair.
“I…” Dean swallowed hard, feeling suddenly young and naive and inexperienced. “Cas...I don’t think I can-”
“You look hot as hell,” Dean said, looking down at his partner with adoration and more than a little awe. “Fuck, Cas. You…” he shook his head, meeting his partner’s eyes. “I’d struggle to feel like I deserved you, even if you were just a regular dude. But that you’re...
Cas didn’t disappoint, but he also didn’t stop at Dean’s name. “Please,” he rasped. “Mark me.”
He definitely didn’t deserve the secret thoughts and longing that Dean could only allow himself to admit in his darkest, drunkest, most lonely moments.
What was the old saying?
“Let’s show him what you are capable of, Dean,” Alastair said, unfastening Dean’s belt and letting it drop to the floor. “What a good pet you can be.”
So damn right he deserved to carry the weight with him, to feel it as Cas trickled away from him, fraction by fraction until Dean was left alone and empty and lost.
Entering the bar on a quiet Thursday evening, Crowley was one of only four patrons. The brothers approached the table, each taking a seat, the bartender bringing over beers without asking as he knew their orders well. "Alright speak." Dean demanded.
Cas nodded, absorbing the information. He didn't press further for now, and Dean didn't seem to notice one way or the other.
Dean flashed a quick cover smile. "Nah, just in time. I think they're gonna be showing up with breakfast any minute now."
Dean's scowl deepened, but he reluctantly ignored the bed for now, sitting and opening the chips with disinterest.
"Cas-'' Dean's voice broke when he cut Cas off, and he let his shoulders sag. With his anger receding, he felt old. Exhausted.
"Sure." Sam snorted.
"Okay, that's okay. As soon as we get these doors open, we have an ambulance waiting to take you both to get some help, okay?"
"Dean… just talk to me."
Dean looked up towards the sky, shaking his head. "I already forgave you, man." He frowned. "I guess you probably weren't getting prayers anymore..." he adjusted his position against the car. "But I'm not mad. Metatron is a grade A douche, and we'll give him what he deserves eventually, but that's on him, not on you."
"Angels… has any angel ever… you know… had a thing or whatever with a human before?"
The younger hunter stood, coming over and taking Dean's wrist in his hand, glancing at his watch to keep time. "Good afternoon." Sam said simply, letting Dean's wrist fall back to the bed. "You think you can switch to oxygen through the nose?"
"That's not-"
With Dean the way he was, he couldn't help but think this really may be the last nail in the coffin.
Dean was laying against the wall, where he had braced himself as he held onto Cas. Fresh burns marred the demon's shoulder and chest. Dean himself was unconscious. Castiel confirmed he was alive before allowing himself to sink back down to the floor, finally letting the pull of the darkness claim him as well.
"Great." Dean muttered. He took a second before letting out his breath. He scrubbed his hand over his face, trying to ground himself a little.
Both of them looked up, hearing the shout in the distance. Cas looked to Dean, but the hunter had just settled to stare at the wall. "It's just taunting us." Dean glanced down, thankful Liam was still fast asleep.
Dean didn't notice. Instead he closed his eyes, willing himself to wake, clawing his way back into consciousness.
The hunter leaned forward, burying his head in his hands. Dropping his voice to a whisper, he finally said the thing that had been weighing on his mind since the cabin. "God, how can you touch me, after…"
"You did not need to say it."
After locking him down in the dungeon, the hunter, angel, and prophet collapsed in the library, trying to catch their breath and begin the lengthy struggle to process the events so far.
Cas looked up at the mention of his name, growing concerned as he looked at the hunter. Dean was fighting hard to repress the shaking in his hands, but the angel could pick up on the slight movement.
Dean rubbed the back of his hand over his bruised lip. He moved forward again.
"And do what? We can't leave him like this. This is the only way. Either it works…"
They didn't last long, and Dean let the last one fall away from his knife before it slipped from his hand. He staggered, almost managing to steady himself before his legs gave way.
The pain ignited like a wave from his torso through his limbs and head, and for a second it even blotted out the burn from the mark. He sputtered, already tasting the faint iron at the back of his throat.
…. It was no use. The damage to the exterior kept him trapped.
Dean closed his eyes, relieved as at least some air made it into his lungs just as his vision was starting to tunnel. The relief was short lived as he became painfully aware that the only thing keeping him alive was this mask around his face in the hands of his brother.
"Doesn't look like any cat I've ever seen." Crowley muttered. "Everyone good?"
entertaining things we can do." Dean said, dropping his voice to a more suggestive tone and flicking the corner of his mouth up in a grin.
"Okay…" Dean said slowly, shaking his head. "What else?"
Cas returned to his sandwich, feeling much more at ease with the feeling of the coat around him. Even as it felt too warm to wear it inside, he still wasn't willing to remove it.
"Sam."
"Still. I should have informed you of the sensations I felt, as I am unsure what is normal."
Sam moved forward, reaching out to take Dean's pulse. Still a little fast, but steady. "Maybe it was just too much. He'll be better when he wakes up." He said, trying to ignore the shake in his voice and project confidence.
The two women were dropped at a local hospital and Sam opted to bring Mrs. Tran to one closer to the bunker, just to avoid the police questioning that might come from multiple victims. Getting a clear bill of health, Sam drove them to the bunker and waited. And waited.
"Right." Sam agreed, slowly.
Sam tossed his jacket over the nearest chair. "I found a book on sigil work that should prevent any reapers from getting inside the bunker."
Cas froze, looking up at Dean with wide eyes.
"So was the plan any more complicated than locking us up in a cabin? Keep me contained? Don't you think it's more likely we just go mad in here?"
He sighed, shaking himself out of that spiral of thoughts, trying to focus on the present. Dean was here. He was breathing. They just had to wait for him to wake up.
Sam's hands were trembling, making it painfully slow to assemble the oxygen tank with the right hoses, and attach it to the mask. Twice he almost dropped the tank itself, but finally everything was running. He tried to calm his racing heart as he took control of the mask back from Cas.
"When does he expect you back?" Sam pressed.
Dean frowned, looking for a second like he might argue, but he closed his mouth, relaxing against the seat back. Cas took that as permission, and he slipped behind the wheel. Dean just shifted to look out the window as Cas pulled the Impala back onto the highway.
Dean swallowed, taking a deep breath. "Cas, grab your stuff. Crowley's outside waiting to take us back." He watched Sam turn, fists clenched for a moment before he walked over to the shelves, grabbing a couple of books he had intended to take back with him. He said nothing to Dean.
Of course, the first night as Cas slept on the air mattress Paka managed to put more than a few holes in the vinyl. Cas woke up on the ground. After almost an hour arguing who would sleep on the couch, they decided to just both sleep on the bed.
"Probably best I don't mention that's in the book to them?"
"With one good leg?"
"Where is everyone else?" Dean asked quietly, keeping a sharp eye out.
Sam heaved a sigh. "All we can do is restrain him. Cure him. Then get back to finding a way to get that damn thing off his arm."
"Well good. Now, reach into the glove compartment and pick out a cassette to play."
"It could be better, but yeah. Improvement for sure." He stood, walking to the dresser and grabbing a cloth bundle before he returned. He tossed the t-shirt to Cas.
Dean dropped his hands, allowing the angel to move forward again. He felt Cas' hand rest briefly on the side of his face, and he pressed into the touch before he felt the surge of grace that helped coax him once more into rest.
"He was fine for a minute."
The angel shuddered to think of what this could mean now. Carefully, the angel slipped himself from underneath the sleeping hunter and quietly left the room to dig into the bunker's library afresh. There was a renewed fire, a drive to find whatever it took to get this mark off his arm
Cas slowly but firmly pushed Dean away from him. "No." He replied flatly, attempting to get his point across.
When Cas woke in the morning, Dean was asleep on top of his computer, still in his clothes. He sighed, but made the conscious decision to give Dean some dignity. He got up quietly and headed into the bathroom, making sure to close the door just loud enough to wake the hunter. When he left the bathroom, he found Dean gathering clothes from his duffel as if he had never been asleep. Cas let Dean shower first, and when he himself was done showering a breakfast sandwich and coffee had materialized and were waiting for him.
"Isn't breakfast the first meal of the day?" the former angel questioned, watching the hunter head back towards the door.
"Sounds like fun." Dean quipped, finishing off his glass and setting it aside.
"Crowley?" Cas asked, voice dropping slightly.
"Give me a text if you find anything interesting." Sam pushed.
The younger hunter was pulling various books from the shelves. Cas looked over the collection he had amassed and surmised he was gathering every single book the Men of Letters had on demons.
"We have something that can take him out." Dean asserted, voice low, almost a growl.
Gadreel was very still, careful to make no movements whatsoever. "Yes, I lied…"
It didn't hurt that Dean seemed to have very good taste when it came to food.
"Still. I do not wish to make matters more complicated. It seems to cause you to feel conflicted."
Cas’ expression cleared as understanding dawned on him. “I see,” he murmured. “Would you prefer I say that I have not fucked a man before?” His tone was so mild that for a moment what he said didn’t register with Dean.
Instead there was rage.
“Aren’t you burning up in that thing?” Dean asked, jerking his chin towards Cas’ dress uniform.
Dean stared at him, hope blooming in his chest. There was no fucking way. The question formed, unbidden at his lips. "Cas you...you...
“Entanglement, eh?” Dean said against Cas’ lips. “I’ll entangle you all morning, baby.”
Cas hesitated, then reached out and put his hand on Dean’s arm. “Dean,” he said quietly. "More than anything else, I need you to know that you were wrong." He smiled and it was like sunshine breaking through the clouds after a prairie thunderstorm. "I would not be better off without you. Even if I did not love you as I do, you are my dearest friend and my existence is far better, far happier, far more
“You’re gonna make me cry,” Dean grumbled and loved the warmth in Cas’ answering chuckle. “Fuck, how can you see me like that, Cas when you’re...
Castiel was on his tiptoes as well, his eyes shadowed by his dress uniform hat as he looked around.
That face that Dean had once thought so detached and emotionless rendered still, forever. Looking down it occurred to Dean that as he’d come to know Castiel, he’d learned that Cas was about the
“I am going to get you back for this,” Cas said with a feral grin.
“That’ll do, Fergus,” Rowena said imperiously.
Jam was unsettling.
when Cas touched him.
He was safe.
, had it always hurt this bad? Another blow and another and then John was bellowing and Dean heard something heavy crash to the ground.
Dean deepened this kiss then, urging Cas’ lips open with his tongue and pouring every ounce of what he was feeling into the kiss. He clutched the angel to him hard, rocking against Cas as the angel tightened his arms around him. “Love you,” he managed to rasp.
John was wearing a rumpled sports coat over a stained collared shirt and dark slacks. His eyes were bloodshot and there was at least three days worth of stubble on his face.
Dean reached up and cupped Cas’ balls, stroking them as he increased the pace, making sure that he was hitting that sweet spot over and over until Cas' knuckles were white where he had his hands clenched behind his back. Then, he slid out and gave Cas a final kiss on the ass before flipping him over by the hips. Cas landed with a huff, immediately putting his arms back over his head and crossing his wrists. His body was covered in a sheen of sweat, his hair was a disaster, his pupils were enormous, and his lips were slack as he looked up at Dean, breathing hard.
to be a nightmare.
"Dork," Dean said, unable to keep from smiling at the angel. "How are you so fucking adorable?"
“Thank you,” Cas said seriously, kissing the top of Dean’s head. He pulled the comforter up around them more securely. “I know that you are still tired,” he said.  “Why don’t you rest, my heart.”
He took a second to gather his thoughts, kissing Cas in the interim. “You’re strong, Cas,” he said finally. “And loyal. And kind. And determined and weird and goofy and
“No soap on the cast iron,” Dean admonished immediately when Cas reached for it.
Dean eased the underwear down, tossing them across the room and rocking back onto his knees for a moment to look at his partner. “Fuck, you’re gorgeous,” he said, running his fingers from one of Cas’ hip bones to the other.
“You will have to kill me,” Cas said and Dean broke.
“Can we not call it that?” he rushed to explain when Cas looked slightly hurt. “Makes me feel like I’m at the doctor’s office.”
Shit.
Dean was happy to oblige.
Well fuck it, it was just as well. He had things that he needed to say.
It felt like
“I hate grape jelly,” Dean said.
“Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?” John asked, turning and fixing Dean with a look that brought back horrible nights from his childhood.
“I’m so damn proud of you, Sammy!” he managed to rasp.
“The things I did to Dean’s body,” Alastair said, shrugging like he was talking about getting the fucking mail and not decades of torment. “The ways I punished him and
“I can hear the gears turning,” Dean said. “What’s on your mind?”
“What do you want?” Dean asked, forcing down the wild surge of terror. He couldn’t do this again. He wouldn’t survive again.
The lake house was beautiful and he knew, in some obscure part of himself, that Cas would have liked it.
But selfishly, he didn’t care.
“Please!” Cas whimpered.
Cas cocked his head, his eyes going wide and innocent. “Please?” he asked in a soft, sweet voice.
Cas' words vanished into a scream as Alastair rammed an angel blade into his chest just below his clavicle and jerked it up, using it as a lever to snap the bone.
Dean shuddered, the memories assailing him. What kind of man allowed his body to find release at the hands of his captors?
“Nothing could do that, Cas,” Dean said. “Talk to me.”
“No,” Dean said, feeling his temper rising. “You
It felt like the Bunker had life in it again.
It felt as though all of the air had been sucked out of Dean’s lungs and horribly, humiliatingly, several tears escaped his careful control as he stared down at the label on the jar. “Thanks,” he whispered.
that Dean felt like he couldn’t catch his breath. “I…” he shook his head, withdrawing a little bit. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t-”
Cas was breathing hard by the time Dean slid between his legs, and the first touch of Dean’s lips to his cock had him arching up off the bed with a cry.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas said from behind him.
Dean leaned into the touch with a sigh, mirroring Cas’ motions with his own hand as they lay facing each other.
The angel’s eyes cut in his direction, widening a tiny bit before he returned to washing. “It is good to be home,” he said after a few minutes of companionable silence.
. “But for now-” he thrust back into Dean’s mouth and Dean eagerly accepted him, his hands on Cas’ ass, yanking Cas in over and over as the angel’s fingers tightened in his hair. Cas went still for a fraction of a second before he bellowed Dean’s name, his whole body spasming repeatedly as he pulled Dean’s mouth all the way down on him. Dean swallowed around him over and over as Cas shuddered through the aftershocks, finally pulling out with a gasp and sinking to his knees to pull Dean into a furious kiss.
“Only if you’re into it,” Dean hurried to add.
so that I could graduate and have this opportunity.” He gave John a look. “I’m grateful to my
“Dad…” Dean rasped. “Dad, it’s his day...please.”
And fuck, fuck, Dean had never really allowed himself to contemplate that. Fuck, Cas had seen everything? Everything that he had done?
His car was there, which made Dean’s heart begin to race. “Wait here,” he said to Cas. “Ok?”
Cas chuckled, but the sound was low and dangerous and put goosebumps up all over Dean’s skin. His hands tightened in Dean’s hair. “I am afraid that if I ‘let loose’ I will hurt you,” he growled, his eyes blazing as they looked down into Dean’s.
Cas shook his head, leaning in and kissing him as he rose to his knees. “I am teasing,” he said. “I can appreciate that you are giving me a taste of my own medicine, as they say.”
He set a ruthless pace, thrusting into Cas to the hilt over and over as the angel moaned and moved beneath him. Cas felt like a wild thing as he moved, his hips never stilling, the muscles of his abdomen tightening and the ones in his neck standing out like ropes as he arched and writhed.
