He can't help it, his thoughts inevinatbly  wander to John. At first, he'd seemed surprisingly calm, until the medical examination had truly unsettled him. Being humiliated by a member of his own profession had seemed hard to cope with. Sherlock hopes John won't get carried away again by his anger. It's no use, Sherlock knows. Better just take it without allowing them to get to you.
And, oh boy, Sherlock's dark moods are epic! Seeing the usually already high-strung man in an anguished frenzy for the first time – yelling, pacing, pulling his hair until almost yanking it out with its roots – had at first truly frightened John. As a doctor, he knows about all kinds of mental degeneration and psychopathies, but it's a different thing to experience signs of these conditions in the man he loves and desires. It's unsettling in the extreme – as is Sherlock's method of treating those manic fits with morphine and cocaine. John has no idea where Sherlock obtains the drugs in these dire times, but regarding his eclectic, bohemian circle, John is sure that he could get hold of almost anything he wants.
“That was fourteen years ago. Didn't you… I don’t know, had some repairs done, or looked through the flat when you moved in, or some time after? You are the nosiest person I know.” John grins affectionately.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock brow furrows. As an answer, John makes an uncommitted gesture with one hand toward Sherlock's middle section. His prevailing erection is clearly visible, trapped inside the soft wool of his exquisitely cut trousers.
Sherlock is looking up at him from red-rimmed eyes and is about to say something in reply. But his words are drowned out by sirens suddenly screaming, their high-pitched tune cutting sharply through the sounds of everyday life in London. Another attack. The Germans are coming by day and night now in an attempt to spread terror and undermine morals.
Mycroft ordered my immediate return. Got a postcard signed with an 'I' – from Meiringen, Switzerland. She seems to have met a friend who ensured her safe passage. I'm relieved. I'm sure she'll be fine. She's a survivor.
John can feel Sherlock's erection through the thin cotton of his boxers and grinds his arse encouragingly against it. This elicits another moan from Sherlock, low and rather desperate.
To steady himself, Sherlock grabs the headboard with his left hand before pushing his right into his pants. A few deft strokes and he is panting, his chest heaving, his thighs trembling. He stops just long enough to pull his boxers down, and as his cock springs free John can't help himself, he groans, deep and guttural.
You would truly love it here, I'm sure. I'm sitting beneath an old olive tree right now, eating dried tomatoes and cheese. It's heaven.
“No, believe me, you don't. I don't want to talk about it and you obviously know, so why force me to spell it out?” Sherlock can't.
But if he hadn’t wanted John to kiss him, why did he feel such loss? Shouldn't he be glad? He doesn't even like to be touched. He certainly doesn't want physical intimacy from his flatmate. Even though...
I'm writing this sitting in a bunker while my people bomb this town again. Everyone thinks I'm writing to my sweetheart (
“Of the two of us it's me who actually had anal intercourse before, so yes, I know what I'm doing. Just let me...” Sherlock has started to stroke himself again to full hardness and the idea of that gorgeous cock brushing over that spot deep inside him suddenly fills John with a craving for more, faster, harder.
“Did Mario know about your... devotion... towards Mr Dunbar?” Sherlock's voice drips with unusually blatant contempt.
When Sherlock finally starts blinking again, John undoes the last of Sherlock's buttons. His movements are slightly restricted by their close proximity which inspires John to press his face against the exposed pale skin of Sherlock's smooth chest. He smiles as he whispers, “Like what you see?”
“I...” Sherlock croaks. “I really shouldn't...” John's right hand tightens, but he's not pushing or pulling, just keeping Sherlock in place. No demand, only an offer.
“Except I wasn't. That would have absolutely disqualified me from being your best man.” Despite a cold and hollow ache spreading inside his chest at the memory of the wedding, Sherlock experiences a desperate need to lighten the mood. Because John is crying now, his tears dampening the collar of Sherlock's t-shirt, seeping through the thin cotton onto cool skin.
John has to concentrate hard and keep his eyes on the treacherous ground as not to trip and loose the towel in the process. Therefore, he only encounters what Sherlock has been up to when he stands behind him.
And here we are at the end of the story... beware, this is the chapter that made me cry writing it. Yet it ends somewhat hopeful - at least that's what I intended. It's up to you to decide if I succeeded.
“This was in the back of that large built-in wardrobe upstairs.” John is a little out of breath and looks flushed with excitement, as if expecting an enthusiastic reaction from his partner.
Sherlock squares his shoulders and tries to get his trembling body under control by contracting his abdominal muscles.
Others engage in man to man action, mostly born out of need and not out of passion. Out here, it's only us boys, so what can you do? Most of the privates are not even twenty. Randy teenagers, most of them. So, things are bound to happen, aren't they? I stay out of it, obviously. They could be my sons, for god's sake, so don't worry your pretty head off.
On the hotter days, they lie idly on the few still existing patches of lawn in Regent’s Park, beneath the last old trees that didn't succumb to the frequent air raids or were cut down to make room to 'dig for victory'. But even when staying in the shades, Sherlock still gets freckles all over the back of his nose, which he hates but John finds very attractive. He proves it by yanking Sherlock into one of the cubicles in the public toilet near the boating lake, pressing him against the tiled wall and snogging him almost senseless.
At half past seven the same evening, Sherlock emerges from his bedroom, dressed in a sharp black suit and tight white shirt.
Late Monday afternoon, Sherlock is back on the sofa, napping. He dreams of an auditorium surrounding him and, as a thousand eyes watch him, a small voice says,
It's getting dark when they finish the war letters. William is worrying his full, still slightly swollen lower lip between thumb and forefinger, staring down at the box. “There’s more.” He says, lost in thought. “I wonder...”
He sent John a pointed text, openly conveying his annoyance before rolling over with a sulky huff, pulling up the sheets around him, watching the grey London light slowly fill the small room.
“It's a death certificate.” William pales a little as he hands the form over to John, who reads it with raised eyebrows. “What is it? What does it say?”
But he has no right to do so, hasn't he? They are not... whatever. Maybe not even friends anymore, with or without benefits?
The iron shackles dangle from John’s left fist as he climbs back onto the bed, a dark gleam in his eyes.
. It seems a bunch of our men in the Netherlands got arrested. They are interred in a camp near Mauthausen. I have to report this to Mycroft immediately.
look, ‘cos I know you, Sherlock Holmes! You found that note and hid it on purpose! You read it, discovered that someone was interested in me, and decided that this would undermine your control of my life, so you … what? Burned it? Ripped it to pieces? Ate it? WHAT?” John is actually furious. Sherlock is impressed by the accuracy of John's speculations – there is still hope left – but senses that complimenting John on his deepening insight in all matters Sherlock right now might be regarded incongruous. So he sticks with denial.
But as he had proven so many times, John can be quite dense and persistent – a combination Sherlock more often than not finds most useful – so perhaps living together, sharing a kettle, a shower and a sofa, has raised some expectations on John's part?
At first, Sherlock can only taste soap, but suddenly the salty flavour of pre-come hits his taste buds. It's intoxicating. He sucks harder, cupping John's balls with one hand, gently rolling them in his palm. Above him, John moans.
We embraced when he said good-bye. I think his lips touched my skin. I'm so starved for human contact, though, I can't be sure.
When John approaches him, a wild grin on his face, Sherlock pulls him over into a dark corner to ravish him. John follows willingly, excited and aroused by the danger of getting off in such a public place. He leans against a metal shutter in the gloomy twilight while Sherlock sinks gracefully onto his knees and sets to work on his fly.
They don't say a single word when John starts to unbutton Sherlock's khaki shirt and wrestles the rough fabric off his shoulders, exposing his still pale, much too narrow chest.
Not everything is perfect. But it's as close as possible, and certainly the best and most intimate affair John has ever had with the most fascinating man he's ever met. As late summer slowly merges into early autumn, they settle in a trusting, stable and honest relationship.
anymore. In fact, great-uncle Sherlock died the year I was born. I owe him my rather flamboyant second name. William Sherlock Scott Holmes. He was my grand-dad's younger brother, or so I've been told.”
“Write it on Sherlock's tab.” John suggests and the woman turns towards him, still flushed but when he smiles, she simply smiles back. There's a small gap between her front teeth, which John finds rather charming.
“Why do you interrogate me if Lestrade has already told you?” Sherlock really doesn't want to remember the dark and seedy mishaps of his past.
“What is it?” John sighs. The past few months have made him quite aware of the frailty of the resident genius and his persistent need for an audience.
John swallows. “What? That could have got you court martialled. You could have been put up against a wall, facing a firing squad.” His hands start to shake and he has to set his cup down onto its saucer.
“PISS.OFF! This is none of your business!” Sherlock closes his eyes, forcefully willing John to leave his thoughts.
Sherlock finally disentangles himself from John and shrugs. He looks a bit lost in the much-too-big sweater, making him appear even more fragile and very young. “Might as well. Though I don't think it's really necessary. We don't need that room anymore. We could just leave all those things up there.”
“What are you doing over there?” he asks, getting up from his chair and walking over to Sherlock, who stares somewhat perturbed on the laptop screen.
Sherlock doesn't seem to recognise the effect his tone and general attitude has on John as he demands: “Grab the back of your knees.” John does but has no idea where all this is leading to. He's lying flat on his back, his arse raised by the pillow and wonders what he'd let himself in for. When he hears the cap of the lube bottle flip open and feels a cold dollop hit his exposed anus he hisses: “Fuck, Sherlock!”
“It's ok... it's alright.” He mumbles, his voice rough as he strokes William’s nape while biting back his own tears. “They were together until the end. They loved each other so much.”
Things seem to progress nicely between John and Sherlock - at least John thinks so. It's all rather new and a bit odd and awkward but as he's dealing with Sherlock, what else did he expect? Only, John might have got something truly and profoundly wrong about his flatmate...
Witold brought two friends who confirmed his story. I still can't believe it. But if it's true, we have to do something. Now! This is far worse than I ever imagined.
“Could you...” Now it's Sherlock's turn to clear his throat. “Would you… consider… staying the night?” There's actually a lovely pink flush spreading on Sherlock's high cheekbones.
He wakes in the small hours, cold and stiff. The TV is still on, showing extremely boring footage of famous scenic railway journeys. In the dim light, John can just make out Sherlock, hunched vulturelike on his chair, knees pulled up to his chest, scrutinizing him.
Sherlock does not look at his reflection in the mirror. He just gets into the bath and slides down beneath the hot soapy surface. John had squeezed a fair amount of bath essence into the tub, so the rich foam covers his sore limbs completely.
“Whatever. I'm off to bed.” John puts his novel upside down on the armrest of his chair before escaping to his room. Last night had been challenging and keeping up appearances of everyday life at Baker Street over the past twelve hours (not even talking about IT; refraining from pressing Sherlock against the nearest vertical surface to ferociously snog and grope him) was at least equally arduous. John just needs a break.
When it's over and the tension leaves his body, Sherlock just slumps down on top of John. For such a wiry man he's surprisingly heavy when reduced to a boneless pile of human flesh. John's arms come up to close loosely around Sherlock's shoulders while Sherlock's head nuzzles against John's moist collar bone. John can feel Sherlock's body shake and shiver and just holds him, not too tight but just close enough to keep him grounded as he drifts through post-orgasmic haze.
“Hey.” John says again, brushing a wayward curl from Sherlock's forehead. His fingertips linger on the clammy skin of Sherlock's temple where a blue vein is throbbing beneath too tight skin.
John speeds up as he can feel Sherlock's whole body clench before going almost boneless. Just a few more thrusts, and he's coming as well, spilling his come between Sherlock's strong, pale legs.
They stay like this, overwhelmed yet sated, until Sherlock is suddenly shaken by a violent coughing fit. John holds him close, petting his sweaty shoulder and back until the spasms abate.
John bites his lip and softly moans. Pearly fluid wells up from the slit and is put to good use as lubricant. After a few more strokes, however, the hand slows down until John's just teasing his shaft, tracing the prominent vein on its underside while his other hand lazily plays with his balls. Then John spreads his legs, wide (and Sherlock knows it's for his benefit as much as John's), puts one foot on the mattress and exposes himself quite unashamedly. The fingers around his bollocks wander further back, gently stroking before diving between his cheeks. The angle is difficult and seems uncomfortable but after John squirms a bit, his cock gives a visible jerk.
But primarily she records great podfic (with a lovely English accent). Check her out at http://archiveofourown.org/users/Lockedinjohnlock
Sherlock's voice is steady and cold as he speaks again. “I was shocked. I didn’t believe him. I thought he was making it all up to get attention. I told him so. Then I left him. The next day he was found dead.”
Later, they sit at their kitchen table, John working steadfastly through a plate of eggs and mushrooms, Sherlock nibbling toast and drinking sugary tea while the tips of his still-wet hair soak and darken the neck of his blue silk dressing gown.
“This case is quite sufficiently complicated without the further difficulty of false information.” Sherlock snaps.
. She not only patiently amends my grammar and punctuation but is also a vital source on such diverse topics as ligature marks, pharmacology and anatomy.
Now, John presses his thigh between Sherlock's and tries to spread his legs. His hands wander south, until his right palm cups Sherlock's penis – and stills.
“Don’t get vocal, Mr. Gibson. I find that, before breakfast, even the smallest argument is quite unsettling. I suggest you think it over and return when you made up your mind.”
The reverie they've lost themselves in comes to a grinding halt one Wednesday evening in September. The days are already getting shorter and a little chilly, a relieve after the summer's heat. It's actually a bit like their first encounter in spring, only this time, John's shift is over and he meets Sherlock on his way home – or rather, to Baker Street. Sherlock has managed to slip away from whatever he's doing deep down in the market's vaults to have a cigarette between the borded-up stalls.
He fucks Victor relentless and steady, pounding that unprepared pink hole. Yet he's sure he's not the first today to get a leg over, so that's all right.
And Sherlock does. Hard and fast. There's no pain, just euphoria, oblivion, ecstasy. Sherlock hits John's prostate again and again but it's not just that, it's the closeness, the passion, the abandon that makes John beg for it, crave it.
He's a good man. Under different circumstances, we might have ended up together. But my heart is taken. I've told him as much. He appreciated my honesty. I trust him with my life.
“You are free to pursuit another line of inquiry with one of my associates. To the right, you might catch HIV or at least some pubic lice. To the left, he'll probably knife you in your sleep.”
“Do I?” The voice is surprisingly posh, with an unmistakable British accent. Public school. Nice! They are hard times right now. You can find all sorts round here.
In the end, Sherlock had taken tinfoil and a glass combustion tube from his chemistry tools and had smoked just enough heroin to calm down. Feeling somewhat sedated afterwards, he'd then gone up to John's room and crawled beneath the tatty sheets that smelled of cheap shampoo, wool, antiseptic and Earl Grey. This maudlin act might have been an exclamation of utmost pathetic misery, but Sherlock was past caring and just wanted a few hours’ rest.
“What are you... ?” John can't continue, for Sherlock presses his nose into his pubic hair, right against the crest of John's groin and inhales deeply. His lips are but an inch away from John's balls and John can only shiver in anticipation as Sherlock exhales, breath ghosting over John's most sensitive parts.
And to John's endless surprise, Sherlock simply crawls into bed, pulls the covers over his lean body and curls himself into a tight ball.
It's a picture of two men, faded with time, the edges battered, but still recognisable. One is tall, handsome and pale, with dark curls tousled by the breeze. The resemblance to William is striking. The other one is smaller, with short fair hair and an open smile. They stand close together at what seems to be the seaside, but are not touching. “It says 'Brighton 1941' on the back.” John smiles. “I'm pretty sure that's your great-uncle. He's as pretty as you.” He dabs his finger at the taller man.
Walter told me about the network he built in England. He said that he knows what Churchill has for breakfast even before it's served. I teased him until he gave me a name: Mörz. Finally something substantial. My hard works starts to bear fruit.
“Oh god...” John sighs, and starts to rock forward on the balls of his feet. Sherlock 's large hands grab the back of his thighs like a vice, surely leaving bruises. He hums with pleasure, and suddenly John can feel his balls drawing up against his body. He jerks Sherlock's head back, even ripping some follicles out with his powerful move. Sherlock gasps in response, a deep, animalistic sound emanating from his throat.
Sherlock leans back in his chair opposite John, folds his hands and rests his interlaced fingers on the kitchen table. He needs a moment to contemplate what John has just said.
John huffs in annoyance. “And I hadn't thought you a champion for equal marriage. Isn't any form of matrimony a long dead relic to you, dull, mundane and hypocritical?”
John knows he's standing too close but he can't drag himself out of Sherlock's vicinity. Instead, he longingly stares down on his tousled dark curls and bites his lower lip, allowing himself in this unobserved moment to indulge in the sight of Sherlock's delicate white neck, bowed down, so that John can just glimpse the fourth vertebra protruding beneath the collar of his shirt. John seriously has to fight the impulse to push his hand into Sherlock's hair and pull his face flush against his groin.
“No, Sherlock, please, stop it. I have no right... you don't have to explain...” John hears his voice crack; he presses his palms fiercely against his eye sockets to not embarrass himself any further.
I'm sipping a glass of Prosecco on a balcony in Naples. I can't believe I made it this far. The town is full of GIs, all out and about, having a good time. They are playing that song you used to hum... I don't remember what I did last New Year’s Eve. But browsing through this notebook, I see that it's my third New Year without you. This is unacceptable, John. This war has to end! I love you. I wish for nothing else than to kiss you when the clock strikes midnight. Wherever you are, be assured that I'm thinking of you with all my heart.
John just grins and kisses Sherlock again, tenderly and exploratory this time. There is a brief moment when a look of haunted sadness passes over Sherlock's face, and John would give his right arm to make it go away. Whatever happened to Sherlock, wherever he's been – it has changed him profoundly; John realises that now. He equally hopes and fears that Sherlock will tell him one day.
“How's the game?” John asks. He's not really into football but he knows Greg is and he wants to make up for being late.
“Please … mate … I'm sure we can talk about this...” John stutters, obviously shaken but not retreating.
John makes tea at two o'clock in the morning, contemplating texting Sherlock. He sits on the sofa in the living room, head in hand and stares down at his phone sitting on the coffee table like it's a rather tempting but forbidden vice. He forgets to drink his tea and pours it down the drain an hour later, wondering where the time has gone.
There’s an almost untouched mug of tea on the coffee table; next to it sits a white bottle of pills.
SOE means Special Operations Executive and was a British WW2 organisation. Following to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in Nazi occupied Europe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive).
“Still want to go slow?” Sherlock breathes against John's ear before nipping at the tender shell and John shivers. Sherlock continues to rub John's cock, his own erection thrusting between John's buttocks as Sherlock slowly rotates his hips.
John has stepped away and peels off his latex gloves, seemingly fascinated by the encrusted dishes piled up in their sink and says nothing.
They can hear Mrs Hudson's guests arrive as they eat. Sherlock, for once, seems famished as he shovels hot fried rice and roasted duck, dripping with peanut sauce, into his mouth. Laughter rises up the stairs and the mumbling voices swell into shrieks of joy and groans of frustration as the evening progresses.
And suddenly, it's not John anymore who stands in front of him, who's hand Sherlock is clinging to but all he can take in and perceive are two narrow burning black eyes, gazing deep down into his brain, laying bare Sherlock's most dark and hidden secrets.
Greg's gaze lingers but he just frowns at the sudden change of topic as a shadow briefly darkens his features. Instead of pursuing the question that's obviously on the tip of his tongue, the DI leans back and starts a lengthy tale evolving around Mrs Lestrade's plans to convert the attic into some kind of studio, now that the daughter has moved out.
“Yes, Greg. I'm so beyond the point of no return right now that I don't think anything you'll tell me can make it any worse!”
“Well, it’s your family. Who knows what skeletons we might unearth here.” John says carefully. He knows that William’s relationship with his own parents and his brother is strained as well, to put it mildly.
“At least, he won't expect to get in my pants afterwards!” Such an openly salacious remark from his usually cagey flatmate (at least in this respect) would have been shocking to John a mere hour ago. As it stands now, he's past caring; cards on the table.
“Alliances? Sherlock, this is not war. Being with someone is about love and care and respect; altruistic reasons.”
John curses under his breath, then kneels down beside the fragile body, feeling for a pulse. Sherlock is cold but his heartbeat is steady. John takes in the bloodstains on the coffee table as well as the fresh track mark on the thin arm he's still holding by the wrist and sighs inwardly.
Poland is bleak. SS and Wehrmacht everywhere. My Polish is still insufficient. But my German helps. We are a very mixed crowd: Russians, Ukrainians, Hungarians, Finns, Germans and Poles – united in the pursuit to save as many people as possible. Yet in the face of the military superiority of the enemy, our small efforts seem doomed to fail. But at least we are doing something! Let's hope for the best. I think of you all the time. I hope you are save and in a better place than I am.
I hope I'll never set eyes on your brother again. Otherwise, I can't promise not to kill him. When I asked about my deployment, James – Major Sholto - just looked at me as if I'd lost my mind. Apparently, I'm to stay here.
Sherlock still looks at John, a curious expression on his face. When he moves again it is very careful and timid. While pushing further in Sherlock lowers John's leg from his shoulder to wrap around his hips instead. Meanwhile he bows down until his tongue can brush against John's lower lip. John arches up and opens his mouth; the kiss is messy and wet until suddenly Sherlock thrusts into John viciously, burying himself to the hilt. John's scream is stifled by Sherlock's insistent tongue, his hands are trapped in Sherlock's death grip at his wrists above his head (when did that happen?) and John feels helplessly pinned down beneath Sherlock, almost impaled.
“Was that yet another quote?” Sherlock asks warily. “Honestly, don't you think you should fill your head with something a bit more useful?”
Sherlock gapes, stunned. John walks over to the chair where he'd deposited his clothes and gets his mobile, shoving it into Sherlock’s face. “See?”
“Ma-manual stimulation. Oral, active and passive. Anal.” Sherlock can feel himself blushing at this list and takes a large swig of the amber liquid. It pleasantly burns down his throat, making his head light and his cheeks heat up.
Sherlock says something, but his voice seems to come from far away and then everything goes dark. The next thing John knows, he's crouching on the floor with Sherlock by his side, holding a plastic bag in his shaking hands. John takes it with equally unsure fingers, presses it to his mouth and starts breathing into it while Sherlock rubs soothing circles into his back. It takes a few minutes but then John's head clears; the buzzing in his ears ceases and his breathing evens.
“Slowly.” John tells him, and Sherlock melts under his heated gaze and fierce, possessive grip. They stare at each other for a moment, and only when John seems satisfied with what he sees does he start to move again, setting a mesmerizing rhythm. Sherlock closes his eyes and tries to relax as best he can.
Das Englandspiel (The England Game) was a counter intelligence operation launched by the German intelligence agency during WW2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englandspiel.
Please, don't get yourself into trouble by saving my reputation. I will report him, and that'll be the end of the story. I told you once that I'm not a coward, and I didn’t fight in this bloody war to allow such vermin to take control over my life. I will not yield. I am right and he is wrong, and the authorities will have to agree to that.
The sucking intensifies and John is helplessly drooling onto the sheets while rutting into thin air. His stifled movements make it easier for Sherlock's next onslaught on John’s body as he pushes the tip of his tongue just inside John’s rectum while John thrusts back against his face.
Sherlock lies on his back, hands at either side, as if awaiting a not particularly pleasant examination.
Saliva is running down his chin as John finally releases him. Sherlock's coughing, gasping. But it's not his place to complain. He's here to serve. He sits back on his heels and awaits further instructions.
“Are you taking the piss? Trying to freak me out?” John snickers, but William keeps staring at him until he relents. “Listen, I don’t know, okay? My family is distant and large. There’s a Scottish branch, for example. Perhaps… well, both my parents are dead, so we’ll never know.” He looks back at William defiantly until the man lowers his gaze back to the letters.
Sherlock just shrugs, then grabs his shirt that has been dangling from a nearby chair and starts to button it up.
Torn between embarrassment and perplexity, John wonders if he gave himself away and, if so, it should perturb him? For it's true, to call Sherlock perceptive might be the understatement of the century but it’s also a profound fact of John's life that his flatmate is usually totally oblivious towards everything regarding sentiment.
Talking to the plaster is somehow much easier than speaking to his omniscient flatmate. “Well, I still fancy you rotten while you are undecided. That's... something to work with, I think?”
“Sherlock, if you have dragged us out here to just show off, I promise you...” Lestrade starts but is interrupted by Sherlock, who is suddenly beaming with delight and satisfaction. Their surroundings make John think that Sherlock takes to this part of a case like a duck to water.
The man John truly hopes is Sherlock Holmes makes a dismissive gesture. “Yes, obviously. But what do you
“Sherlock, get on with it.” John sighs, trying to ground the madman before he starts to stride about like a rutting peacock. Besides, flattering Sherlock is his job and his alone!
“Nice deduction, John.” Sherlock tries to sound light-hearted and mocking, but there's something underneath - something that John can't quite put his finger on - that spoils the effort.
The night flies by. After the raid, the hospital is flooded with new patients, most of them women and children. Some have nasty burns due to the phosphorus bombs the German bastards drop. On civilians! On people who can't defend themselves. The cowardice makes John shake with rage as he patches up an eight year old boy who will probably never use his right arm again. It's so bloody unfair. He can hear Vera Lynn sing from the nurse’s common room and laughs at the irony.
“I'd love to have seen you as a strawberry blond.” John jokes, trying to lighten the mood, curling a dark strand of hair around his finger.
Sherlock turns and lies down, stretching his arms above his head. John fastens the cuffs to the headboard, pulling them tight. A fresh spark of arousal shoots through Sherlock’s body. Who’d thought he'd enjoy a little dominance so much?
“Ok. Great.” John takes a deep breath and seems to steel himself before looking up. He frowns. “Listen, what we did... if you were uncomfortable with it...”
As it turns out, the translation of Brazilian laws regarding same sex marriage is not needed in the end. Sherlock, after a thorough examination of all the photographs taken by the police, spies a chip in the stone parapet of the bridge on which Mario was shot. This discovery is met with a prolonged period of silence, followed by rapid deductions that John's not entirely sure he can make sense of. It boils down to: “Take your gun, phone Lestrade, phone Gibson. We'll meet them on this bridge in half an hour.”
John’s cock brushes over Sherlock’s prostate, and suddenly, all pain is forgotten. He arches his back, clenching around John, who has to grab his hips hard to steady him.
A few minutes later a wet body emerges from the bath, clad in nothing but his now fully open black shirt. The skin beneath is glistening pink, scrubbed clean. On the lean chest shines a silver necklace, while between the man's legs an exceptionally beautiful long cock starts to stir.
He finds a crumbling newspaper clipping, dated 1947, showing a strikingly beautiful, dark-haired woman. The capture reads “Triumphant Return for Irene Adler to Covent Garden in Fidelio”. Someone has written at the margin:
He only comes round reluctantly but he knows he has to pull the syringe from the vein soon. He presses another antiseptic wipe over the puncture wound and bends his arm to prevent bleeding. Afterwards, he just tosses everything in the drawer of his nightstand. He’ll clean it later. With more care, he hides the plastic bag again. John finding it would be an utter waist. Finally, he blows the candle out (fucking smoke alarms, again). Only then Sherlock allows his body to slump onto his bed.
” Sherlock suddenly twists around and almost knocks John off the bed. “Brilliant! You are brilliant, John Watson!” And Sherlock snogs him so forcefully that a rather large amount of lube lands on the sheets. Nevermind, John has the intention to get them properly soiled very soon, anyway.
“They seem to have been pretty happy together.” John says, a wide grin on his face as he seems to relax again. “God, I wish we'll still be like them when we reach middle-age.”
John slowly shakes his head, then looks around the empty sitting room. After briefly contemplating going after Sherlock, he swiftly abandons this thought, because he still bears a grudge with His Nibs for being unceremoniously shown the door last night and seriously doesn't need that experience a second time in 24 hours. So he gathers his wits and forces himself to move with most of his dignity still intact, idly shuffling up into his room, where the persistent need to get the tension out of his system starts to take its toll.
They stay like this for a long while, just breathing; sighing from time to time, until Sherlock jerks abruptly and sits up. He grabs the base of his flagging cock as he pulls out and John is rather grateful that he's spared a trip to A&E to remove a slipped condom from his colon.
. A coarse voice spluttering common insults. A New Balance trainer kicking someone, hard. It hurts... Why is the creature on the floor not fighting back but only tries to cowardly cover its face by curling into a ball? God, this is intolerable. Ah, well, there's another man, a hand with tattooed knuckles
As you can see, I was so bored I invented my own shorthand to write this. Should I ever be captured and this little book falls into the wrong hands, they won't be able to decipher it, I'm pretty sure. I miss you. Fiercely. I hope you are well, wherever you might be.
A tentative knock on his door has Sherlock step back inside from the balcony. He doesn't expect anyone. Perhaps some of his comrades who want to try again and invite him for a drink? But he told them that he wants to be alone tonight. He wants to think about John. Well, not just think, to be honest, but fantasise, getting lost in erotic thought... Because that's all that's left for him. An imaginary lover, as the real one is god knows where, if still alive at all.
“Sorry, this seems to be a mistake. I'm really not after... that. Don't bother, I see myself out.” He turns, sure that by now his face must be the colour of beetroot.
Sherlock had screwed his eyes tightly shut as his hand pushed even lower. His knees had nearly buckled as he'd started to stroke himself, hard and fast. The lathering foam had made everything deliciously slick and Sherlock got embarrassingly close rather quickly. It had felt like drowning. He had to brace himself with one arm against the bathroom wall, envisaging looking down on John, whose pupils would be blown wide, lips slightly parted, rivulets of water running over his face, dripping from his lips, down his chin and neck...
As if on cue, said flatmate re-enters the living room and strides over to his desk, ignoring John completely.
John tries to read but his gaze more and more often wanders over to Sherlock, who's sprawled on the couch, watching something on the telly while simultaneously browsing through the Journal of Communicable Diseases (charming), which he only puts away now and then to furiously type something on his laptop. After one exceptionally shrill squeak from downstairs, however, he raises his head, almost catching John staring at him. John quickly looks away, but he's not sure if he’s been quick enough.
Instead of an answer, Sherlock gives John a hard look. John grins back. Something in the atmosphere shifts. Sherlock unfolds, leans against the sofa, stretching his long arms and legs.
“Take your hands off me!” Sherlock hisses but John does not listen, he only grabs tighter, brings his other hand down on Sherlock’s left arm, actually pinning Sherlock to the mattress. Next he'll be sliding his hands up, round his throat, until…
, god, those words! It's like a their very own language...). It's sickening, listening to him, talking about the city as if it already belongs to him. Luckily, he got so wasted he couldn’t get it up.
Sherlock tosses the Durex somewhere into the darkness beyond the ray of light cast by the bedside lamp. As it is technically his room John can't be arsed to admonish him. He can yell at Sherlock if he accidentally steps into it tomorrow. For now, John just wants to curl up here besides Sherlock and for once they seem to be on the same page, since Sherlock lies down beside him, wrapping one thin arm and one long leg around John's more solid frame.
John throws an exasperated look over at their kitchen table, covered entirely with Bunsen burners, glass flasks and Petri dishes growing god knows what (William deemed it as an experiment a fortnight ago). “Sadly, you don’t bring in the decent salary associated with an academic post.” He growls.
It's surprisingly clean. Fresh sheets on the bed, a bottle of water on the bedside cabinet. There's even an ensuite bathroom with only two cockroaches quickly hiding in one dark corner as John switches on the neon light.
John is bereft of an answer. What the hell is he supposed to do? His mind is foggy, but he's still dimly aware that the appropriate reaction to such a proposal would be to tell Sherlock to stop at once. Instead, John has to admit – although shamefully - that he is definitely turned on by Sherlock's proposition. He's torn between the urge to break off and have a proper talk and to take Sherlock up on it, tugging at his curls while shoving his cock right back into that willing mouth.
“I see you soon.” Sherlock promises in John's direction, and the policemen laugh, a dirty low chuckle that makes bile rise in John's throat. For the first time this evening, he's starting to get truly afraid. This is not a joke, as surreal as the situation may seem. This is serious business. Yet John has no idea how serious.
So he stays silent, tries to ignore Sherlock's behaviour and makes excuses for him; like, when Sherlock stops talking mid-sentence, his eyes losing focus; hadn't he always done this?
Sherlock rolls his eyes and sighs heavily but when John walks over to press his phone into Sherlock's palm, closing his long slender fingers around it with his own sturdy ones, he's met with no resistance. They stare intensely at each other for a moment and John could swear to observe a flicker of ...interest? …surprise? ...excitement? … in these pale eyes, today rather alarmingly shot with red spots due to collapsed blood vessels.
“Please … go.” Sherlock whispers, sounding desperate and broken and weak and suffering and sick to death.
It's not his brother's voice any more. Sherlock bolts from the sofa and smashes his head on the coffee table, as hard as possible. He tastes blood but has to do it a second time before, finally, everything goes quiet.
Mycroft gives a curt nod, yet relieve is showing in his posture. “I'll talk to the Prime Minister. I’m sure, after the Venlo incident, he’ll understand the necessity to rebuilt our network on the continent with the most suitable people.”
They don't say a single word when John fumbles between them to open Sherlock fly and push his khaki trousers down his legs. There's a deep, ugly scar on his upper thigh, but John doesn't ask about that either.
John swallows. “I mean, what about your… needs? Do you want me to...” John trails off, unsure what he is prepared to offer in return.
He checks for other obvious injuries on the body, finds none, and very carefully pulls Sherlock up into a sitting position, his back against the sofa. Sherlock's head is lolling from side to side until John holds him by the chin to inspect the ghastly cut to his right eyebrow. The area around it is swollen, as is Sherlock's right eyelid. John pulls it open; the eye behind it is glassy, the sclera bloodshot. John gently starts to feel Sherlock's face and skull, searching for further subcutaneous injuries. His nose might be broken, and his lip is split. Sherlock's chin and throat are glazed over with dried blood. He looks like an extra from a particularly gory horror movie.
But shouldn't he be relieved? John chasing after a skirt means he's not lusting after Sherlock – at least for the time being. Or could Sherlock probably been mistaken? After all, this is not his area...
They move back to the living room where the light is better – and the atmosphere a little less charged.
It still hurts a bit, but the feeling of John moving inside him is intoxicating. Especially when he speeds up, chasing just his own orgasm, using Sherlock for his pleasure. John has his head thrown back, teeth bared, sweat darkening his blond hair, and Sherlock's suddenly aware that this man has not much in common with the considerate, gentle, yet also somewhat cautious lover he usually shares the bed with. This man has lowered his guard and takes what he wants. Sherlock didn’t think he would enjoy being treated as a sex object, but somehow it's actually liberating. No need to worry about if John enjoys what they are doing – as it is obvious he does. No guilt either, for fear of lacking something John might expect in a sexual relationship – tenderness, experience, confidence when it comes to one’s own sexual predilections – is it doesn't matter right now. John takes and Sherlock gives. It can be so easy.
“If you mention that film ever again, I swear I'll tie you down and force you to watch all seven Star Wars movies with me. Even the one's with Jar Jar Binks.” Sherlock's mouth snaps shut. “Listen, there's much more to sex than just penetration. No, don't say anything, Sherlock. This is, for once, my area, so lie back and enjoy.” And with that, John resumes plundering Sherlock's mouth before moving down his throat to suck on one of those dusty pink nipples until it's a hard, glistening nub.
But it's not just John's workload that is getting increasingly erratic. He never knows when Sherlock might be at home. Sometimes, he gets up in the middle of the night, sneaking silently away when he thinks John's fast asleep. Or he receives a telegram mid-morning and leaves in a hurry, often not returning for days. John is paralysed with fear when he doesn't know where Sherlock is when the bombs start to fall, with no means to contact him and make sure he's safe. All he can do is burying himself in his own work to stop fretting over his lover's fate.
Sherlock is waiting, a look of intense concentration on his face. John knows that this is a crucial turning point in their… life. He experiences a kind of vertigo as he lets his fingers stroke Sherlock's high cheekbone tenderly before pushing his fingers into Sherlock's hair to pull him close again.
“Some... ? I don't... I can't. Please.” When Sherlock's voice fails him John just holds him, pulling the layers of cloth back down, covering the cruel remnants of what Sherlock has been through.
“As always, spot on. Even if it took you some time to work it out. So, nothing new there. Was it my lack of commitment that gave me away, or didn't you become suspicious until groping my crotch, mistaking my reluctance for chaste ambiguity?” Sarcasm seems an adequate approach to the situation but John begs to differ.
Sherlock stands by the window, his back to John as his body sways slightly in accord with the music.
Sherlock throws up his hands in despair. “I liked it, John. Stop mollycoddling me. I'm an adult. I could have said no.”
They seem about to engage into a fight any minute. Sherlock's pulse hammers in his ears. John starts sweating. Seconds tick by.
John climbs in next to him. There's not much room in his single bed, especially when accommodating six foot of lanky consulting detective. Very naked consulting detective. For the first time, John allows his eyes to take in Sherlock's gloriously pale frame, all firm, lean muscle beneath taut alabaster skin. His nipples are a dusty pink. His flaccid cock rests in a nest of wiry auburn curls. He looks delectable. Fuckable.
“Mates' rates.” Sherlock offers with a smirk before putting his mug into the sink and sauntering off into their bedroom.
“Lick. Show me what your amazing tongue is capable off.” John growls as he lowers himself onto Victor's face, spreading his cheeks to offer his anus for worshipping. God, that tongue is talented! It laps and licks and pierces the tight ring of muscle until John is gasping and squirming.
Sherlock takes his time, swirling his talented tongue round and round the crown of John's cock until John can't contain himself any longer. He grabs Sherlock's still damp curls and shoves his cock into that tight, moist heat until it bumps against the back of Sherlock's throat.
“What I am talking about? I just ran into a very offended and rather miffed lovely young woman in Speedy's, who, last Monday, gave me her number and asked me out for a coffee. But I never called, so I must have been 'taking the piss last week' – her words. But can you believe my astonishment when she told me after I nearly sank down on my knees to apologise, that she wrote me a note and I had to tell her that it never reached me? I mustn’t have been very convincing because she just rushed past me and wished me a good day in front Mr Chatterjee and a shop full of customers! Oh no, don't give me that wide-eyed
“Ah, look, here’s a note from 1953. It's signed Sherlock again. Well, let's see what he has to say.”
“Oh, you are one to talk! What about you, then? Three Continent Watson, I presume?” Sherlock sneers back, standing in the middle of their sitting room, hands on his hips. “You are hardly the poster boy for matrimonial bliss either.”
He doesn't have to wait long. John shimmies down the mattress and puts a pillow beneath his hips, canting up his arse.
“It’s heavy—remarkably heavy,” he says. “Do you know, John, I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.”
Or is John simply deceiving himself, deflecting from facing that he would have… what? Continued to touch Sherlock? No, that sounds too benign. He'd wanted Sherlock, in every sense of the word. And he would have taken him, claimed him. He'd been tempted to continue even after recognising that Sherlock wasn't really into it. He'd thought about talking him around. No, it hadn't been such a high cognitive function as thinking – more base, carnal need to touch, rut, rub; own. Yes, the primal urge to capture and seize.
John somewhat reluctantly steps over the threshold into a gloomy hall. His host doesn't wait for him but is already ascending the stairs, his rather daring burgundy silk dressing gown billowing in his wake. John follows upstairs, a little confused about this strange greeting.
Sherlock doesn't flinch but looks Gibson straight in the eye. “Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain. And now, I would be most grateful if you could remove your hand.”
“Bollocks!” Sherlock almost yells and John is shocked by his fierce reaction. He'd just wanted to do the right thing, give Sherlock some space, time to adjust.
Sherlock looks down in disgust. “God, I haven’t come in my pants since I was a teenager.” He shoves the thin cotton fabric down, then offers it to John for a clean-up. Sherlock turns on his stomach, allowing John a marvellous view of the ridge of his hips and arse.
John stares down at the sight in front of him. Sherlock, flushed and needy, spread out and open, offering himself up. It's the most beautiful things he’s ever seen. He has to have him. Now!
“Would you care to sort through those boxes with me upstairs?” John asks for want of anything better to say.
As John turns again, Sherlock is still leaning against his chair, gazing down onto its empty seat, frowning, as both hands cling to the backrest.
“Okay then, spread your legs.” Sherlock does, and John pushes one lubed-up finger in right to the third knuckle. Sherlock sucks in a breath. It’s not that he’d never had anything up his arse – he is curious, after all – but he’d thought John would go slower. Well, John probably would, but Hamish White doesn’t. After a few moments, he already adds a second finger.
He has to admit he experiences exhaustion but senses John still lurking in the hallway. He can't deal with that now. No more pity. No more compassionately reassuring empty phrases. No more sympathetic looks. As if what happened hadn't been bad enough. No, wait... Nothing happened. He forgot... He'll delete the whole episode, as he has deleted others.
So, this just happened. I'm aware that there might be some historic inaccuracies occurring in the above chapter, but please show some forbearance, as this is still mostly pwp.
I had to watch Irene again. She visited my cubbyhole afterwards, we had tea and a little chat. It was quite surreal, with her almost naked, and me just in shirtsleeves as well. Now I know where I saw her before. She's an opera singer and was in London for the concert season 1937/38. I heard her in La Traviata at Covent Garden. As Joachim Lenz has also been to London before the war (my legend is that he worked for a shipping company), we quickly found some common ground. She's absolutely ruthless. I'm not sure what to make of her, but I think I like her.
John lowers Sherlock’s legs and scrambles over to the bedside cabinet to grab the lube. His sweaty fingers are shaking as he fumbles with the cap, watching Sherlock sprawled out on the duvet, graceful and enticing, his nipples dark and peaked, the triangle of black curls between his legs a stark contrast to his translucent skin.
“Patience you must have, my young padawan,” John mumbles and the look of utter incomprehension he receives from Sherlock is priceless. “Star Wars?” he offers but that doesn't sit well with Sherlock, who just rolls his eyes and huffs in annoyance: “Really, John, for a grown up man, you can be remarkable childish.”
Lips press against his neck, sucking lightly. John bucks against the man's hand, desperate for friction, while his own cold fingers push inside the man's shorts. The stranger hisses as John's icy fingertips make contact with his hard shaft, already damp at the head, but the curse is quickly transformed into an outright lewd moan. They rub and grind against each other, trying to keep quiet, stifling their gasps as best they can out of fear of being caught.
“I'm not at liberty to say, as you very well know.” Mycroft bows his head. “Of course, the Maghreb would be much preferable to South Asia or India. One hears dreadful things from those part...”
Not tonight though. They are not Sherlock and John, tentatively feeling their way around a somewhat new, intimate relationship. They are Hamish White, who hired an escort named Scott. Which gives them plenty of room to experiment.
“Well, and now this.” Mycroft Holmes waves his hand in a gesture encompassing John, the whole room, the police station and maybe London in general. “He's a repeat offender now. That complicates matters.”
After solving the case of the millionaire's dead husband Sherlock and John finally start talking to sort out their muddled feelings.
“Well, it's you who always insists on me taking more care of all matters financial. Gibson wants to hand over his cheque. I'd thought you'd approve,” Sherlock states, but beneath his cocksure behaviour John can sense uncertainty.
Instead, being left to his own devices, he might as well make the best of it. He cooks pasta and watches a DVD, once more balancing his plate on his knees as he eats in front of the telly, then turns in early. After last night, he feels entitled to some rest and if Sherlock is playing prima donna, pocketing all the fun and merit for himself, then John can be equally stubborn and give the twat the silent treatment (even if he's not sure if Sherlock will recognise it as such).
Only when he’s swallowed every drop does the man get back up again, pressing his face into the crook of John's neck as he wantonly humps his thigh and hip, panting huffs of humid air against John's collar bone until John pulls his face up into a desperate kiss, tasting himself on the man's tongue.
When John has finished cleaning him, he removes the peas to take a long look at the gash on Sherlock's brow.
“Whatever.” John coughs then pinches the bridge of his nose. “How long would you have been standing there, letting me rut against you? All the while... ?” John can't bring himself to speak it out loud. For speaking of it makes it real.
Sherlock watches John eat, fiddling with his serviette, rearranging salt and pepper, olive oil and vinegar, from time to time glaring venomously at the other patrons from under his lashes. John tries to enjoy his excellent meal but it's not easy in Sherlock's gloomy company. At least he's silent. John is spared Sherlock's, likely unflattering, deductions regarding their waiter and fellow guests.
John follows suit, burying himself inside Sherlock, pushing as far in as possible, spilling hot, thick come inside the wrecked, trembling body in front of him.
Apply manual stimulation by mutually massaging our genitals? John might have liked that, going by what had happened yesterday. Or would that be too trite? Should Sherlock blandly offer full-on anal penetration? But that might be too much too soon. John had told Sherlock he’d never done anything like this with a man so far.
“Why? Do you want to shower first? You just had a bath.” Sherlock seems a bit nonplussed. His gaze trails down where John's fingers are wrapped around his arm.
Sherlock gasps; He's almost sobbing, holding onto John's hips for dear life, slamming into John. He's obviously beyond speech, his eyes screwed shut by now to concentrate on keeping his frantic rhythm until his hips stutter and he freezes.
But perhaps it's time to move on? Mycroft has hinted at a Job for MI6, something on the continent, and why not? Suddenly, Sherlock desperately wants to leave London and all it contains behind.
John actually feels his blood surge towards his groin as he's getting hard. His cock is swelling visibly, the foreskin already retreating until his glistening slit peeks out almost cheekily.
“For... I don't know... missing out on post-orgasmic cuddling because my sorry old carcass failed me?”
As if to prove him right Sherlock sits up in silence and looks at John, tilting his head to one side to examine him thoroughly. John feels himself crumbling and shrivelling until Sherlock asks disbelievingly: “You'd like to watch that? Seriously?”
It's so hot that I start to long for a foggy, damp November day in London. We are approaching Christmas! At home, we would eat fruit cake and drink mulled wine, at least before this bloody war broke out.
John needs a moment after this before pulling out. Sherlock winces. John quickly rolls the condom off and ties it before dropping it on the floor. They gaze at each other, speechless and a little bit embarrassed. Sherlock is shackled to the headboard and sprawled all over the rumpled sheets while John kneels between his spread legs, a little unsure of how to proceed.
They meet Gibson and Lestrade on the bridge on Hampstead Heath. Greg is accompanied by a rather sullen looking police officer by name of DC Coventry, who has been in charge of the investigation until it had recently been mysteriously taken from him and had been transferred over to NSY.
“Listen, they need me. It's an emergency. I'll be back soon. Stop bleating. Keep yourself occupied. Don't you have some body parts to entertain yourself?” With that, John steps out in the cold, dark London morning and makes his way to the tube station, already overcrowded with grumpy fellow commuters.
“Well, I can imagine what kind of scandal that might have been, reading those letters. He was gay.” They both look down at the box, now sitting on the bedspread between them. This could proof to be Pandora's box...
“Yes.” Sherlock hesitates. “But if you are not amiable...?” He's already losing his nerve, back-paddling as long as it can still be brushed off as some kind of joke between... mates. Only, they never were exceptionally matey. John has to stop Sherlock before he once again clamps up and retreats into his shell.
“Here's a bunch of letters in a different handwriting.” He says, retrieving a pile of envelops, yellowed with age, held together by a faded green ribbon.
“Think, John! This murder had struck me as rather stupid even at my first perfunctory reading of the news. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, one must suspect deception.”
No answer. Which sadly isn't that unusual since.... Sherlock's quieter now, often lost in thoughts. Or actually asleep. Like, really sound asleep, in the afternoon, on the couch. Because he doesn't sleep well at night. Fair enough, Sherlock has always been an early riser but these days he often thrashes in his dreams and sometimes wakes up with a strangled sob, the sheets all twisted and sweaty. He usually gets up then and goes over into the sitting room to play his violin, regardless of the hour. John pretends not to notice and fakes snoring to give Sherlock some space.
“Anyway, we had to finish this damned paper, so we met again. Victor instantly started to feel me up. I pushed him away. I had no words. Eventually I managed to tell him that we should concentrate on our project. He leered, rolled a joint and started smoking while I leafed through our books and hurried up to finish the equations.” Sherlock's voice is thin, teetering for a short moment on the brink of hysterical giggling. “It was surreal. Victor started to touch himself. He got his penis out and...” Sherlock closes his eyes, shutting out the world as he relives that moment. His voice is very small and low. “I was confused. I told him to stop. He just smirked. He babbled away, fantasising about us moving to London after we'd finished school. His parents had a flat there. It was ridiculous.”
). John dutifully asks about Lestrade's daughter, now away at university. Greg deplores the horrendous fees but John can sense the proud father underneath the grumbling; she's the first in the family to take a degree and Lestrade revels in delight while he complains about the difficult business of selecting, enrolling at and affording a good College.
At least before guilt and remorse would eat John alive. So instead of giving in, John takes a deep breath, turns on his heels and marches up the stairs, his back rigid, his jaw set.
John looks at both of them. They are in no way attired to seek refuge in a public shelter. If they'd get caught in their present state of undress, together, they'll sure as hell end up in custody.
John scoots back and gets the key to release Sherlock, who sits up, rubbing his slightly chafed wrists before feeling his neck. There's a throbbing pain at the junction of his throat and shoulder.
“What I mean, John, is that you'd rather have spent the night with me but as I seemed unapproachable at the time, you took the next best thing on offer. No, please, hear me out, this is important. I can endure intimacy with strangers; but I don't think I could ever have you taking me to bed. Do you understand what I'm saying?”
“Perfectly save?” John parrots. “You are about to go undercover as a rent boy to catch a serial murderer who has already disembowelled four men!”
Met Witold again. He urged me to inform my superiors. Not sure. Of course, I've heard the rumours, but in a war truth dies first. I'll have to talk to Irene again. Maybe she knows more. She's rather well connected.
Nobody is aware of him slipping out of the flat in the dead of night (not even his brother who controls all of London's CCTV). Blandford Street is only a few minutes’ walk away, south of Marylebone Road.
John presses the cold bag of peas (considerately wrapped in a tea towel so as not to add freezer burn to Sherlock's battered face) against Sherlock's already clean forehead, then pulls Sherlock's right hand up to hold the improvised cooling aid in place, before he continues to dab at Sherlock's sore face.
“Yes.” John is surprised how true this short statement rings. All of this feels surprisingly, utterly, absolutely, frighteningly right.
I'm still exhausted and tire easily. Today a German patrol came by and wanted to see my papers. Agnieszka bribed them with some honey, and luckily they left. But it's getting dangerous. I might have to leave soon, try to reach one of the larger towns where I might be able to go to ground and connect with the Polish resistance again. I'm homesick, John.
He tries one final approach: “But I honestly think you should inform Miss Smith of your findings. She has a right to know. Why else would you bother to find out in the first place?”
“This country needs my brother. A situation has arisen... it's very important that he works for us.”
The water has gone cold as Sherlock eventually gets out of the tub. He dries himself, again avoiding to acknowledge his frame reflected in the mirror. It's just transport. It's not important. Even when brushing his teeth does he not look up, astoundingly ignoring the gaunt pale face that looks back at him, eyes huge and hooded, with dark rings beneath.
Sherlock responds by parting his lips, mouthing along John's shaft until he reaches the crown. There, his clever tongue reappears, flicking against John's fraenulum. As John moans softly, Sherlock casts his eyes up, his gaze never leaving John's face as he sucks the head slowly into his hot, wet mouth. John feels himself blush as he watches Sherlock act out one of his favourite fantasies, as if he knew what John had dreamt about in the darkness of his barren room. He feels Sherlock's tongue circling his glans and the sensation is so intense that his knees nearly buckle. The movement pushes his cock deeper into Sherlock's mouth but instead of sputtering or choking, Sherlock takes him in easily, sucking him deeper, even hollowing his cheeks before pulling off with an obscene sound, to take a breath.
John is suddenly not sure if this has been a good idea after all. He pouts mutely until Sherlock starts to speak again.
Sherlock spreads himself a little wider, grabbing the backs of his knees, and John plunges two slick fingers deep inside him.
Sherlock's face is kind of solemn as he continues. “In addition I discovered cocaine, amphetamines, poppers, ecstasy – I took almost anything that heightened my perceptiveness. Both Mycroft and I had inherited a trust fund from our Grand-Mere, to which we gained access when we turned eighteen. I don't know what Mycroft did with his money but I spent mine on drugs.”
I'm in Hamburg, by the way. I won't go into details, it's too distressing and tedious at the same time. The town was hit by a heavy air raid last night. I cheered inwardly. I wanted to dance in the streets. But so many people died. Civilians, burned to death or buried beneath the rubble. Women, children... It's so unfair. War doesn't distinguish between good and bad people, it just takes them all.
His heel start to dig in the small of Sherlock's back as John pulls him closer, eager and needy. The stretch is still unfamiliar and nearly too much but John is getting accustomed to it. His grunts become more and more an expression of pleasure. His face is sweaty, his eyes burn, his body is tense but the intimacy of what they are doing is incredibly arousing.
Sherlock is following Gibson's departure with narroed eyes. “Don't be disappointed. I'm sure it will be a rather dull affair.”
To avert another crisis, he used the last of his stash, again just smoking it (the high wasn't that satisfying but it served its purpose while leaving no visible traces) and dozed all afternoon on his bed, his open dressing gown pooling around him in cool waves of soft silk. Every time an image of John popped into his head, however, he pinched the inside of his naked thigh – hard - until he winced and tears welled up in his eyes. But contusions were much easier to explain than lacerations.
Sherlock's tone still rings with panic as he continues. “I couldn't stop watching him, John. I wanted to look away but I couldn't. I got hard myself. I pressed my fist against my crotch. Victor saw it. And then he was all over me again. It was just wild fumbling and uncoordinated rubbing but... I couldn't stop. Only when he tried to stick his tongue into my mouth I turned away. I came so hard I almost blacked out. Victor shot his semen all over my stomach. I can still remember him staring at it, putting his fingers into it and painting on my skin. I threw up after that and literally ran away.”
Back at the flat, the mood doesn't improve. Sherlock throws himself onto the couch and refuses to answer as John offers to make coffee.
“I. AM. FINE!” Sherlock slams the mug down, hard, and the boiling water spills over, almost scalding his fingers. “Stop treating me like a stroppy child!”
But Sherlock has pushed two fingers into his own mouth, sucking hard. He imagines them to be John's, drawn from his arse and stuffed brutally down Sherlock's throat. All he can do is hump and rub in ecstasy as his orgasm crashes over him. His abdominal muscles nearly cramp while his whole body shakes violently but he doesn't avert his eyes from John's arse and cock. John's balls are drawn tight against his pubic arch. He's close.
“I was about to say that what we’ve both witnessed on that screen is exactly what I want you to do to me on a daily basis. Preferably twice.”
“Again, Sherlock? I was called away from a vital meeting at the War Office. Do you have any idea...?” Mycroft interrupts himself, and now it's his turn to sigh heavily. “No, of course, you don't.”
“What's that supposed to mean?” Now Doctor Watson is in full swing. He pulls a protesting Sherlock up onto his feet and manhandles him into the bathroom, pushing him down onto the closed toilet seat before removing his Jacket. Then he hastily starts to unbutton Sherlock's tight purple shirt. 'I'm just checking for injuries', he recites to himself. 'This has nothing to do with me lusting after my flatmate. I'm a doctor, he's my patient.'
“I'm not panicking.” Sherlock glares, but despite the scorn in his voice, his fists unclench and his chest heaves as he draws a deep breath.
“What?” John's voice is low, seductive and enticing, full of wicked promise. He presses his thigh just a little bit up and between Sherlock's legs and Sherlock's hips snap almost involuntarily as he ruts against John, his body seeking friction while his mind struggles to catch on.
John and Sherlock live their summer of love despite their world exploding, until reality intrudes, brutally tearing them apart.
A cable arrived from my brother. He recommended me for the SOE, due to my exceptional experience behind enemy lines. I'm to liaise with the Polish unit. They even gave me a battledress! But we are encouraged to wear civilian clothes. This whole sabotage thing sounds like it's a blast (sorry for the pun).
He hasn't done this often. He believes there should be trust between two partners before taking this particular step, a trust that can't be established between two strangers in a grimy darkened alleyway.
“I'd like to see you try.” John retorts and Sherlock can sense the reprehensibly warm smile in his voice.
And John understands. Up there in the attic linger ghosts from their past. And they are neither ready to face them. There's nothing to be gained by reminding themselves over and over again what they've lost, missed, what has been taken away from them. They are together now, and that is all that matters.
Sherlock is woken by the doorbell ringing (despite being disposed off into the fridge). He can hear Mrs. Hudson converse downstairs and then she climbs the stairs and steps into their kitchen.
Sherlock had thrusts into his fist, his hips bucking once, twice, before shooting his come all over the tiles, sobbing into the crook of his arm.
“Yes, I would. I do. I have to.” John steps up to Sherlock, almost towering over him – a strange new angle – his hands clenched into fists at either side of his tense, staunch body.
I know I should have. I know I should let go. I know I should accept that you are gone and get on with my life. Just, there is no joy for me in a world without you in it. You were my light, my fate, my home. You saved me. You gave me purpose, meaning. Without you I feel... nothing.
John summons up all his courage and dares to ask, “Earlier, when we, you know... what happened? I mean, you invite me to your bed but you can't stand me touching you. It's a bit… confusing, at least for someone ordinary like me.”
“I'm not a prostitute. I'm not after your money. I just want to know why you came by now. You are obviously tired, having worked a busy night-shift. Yet you took the trouble to come over. Why?” There's genuine curiosity in his tone.
John feels mortified. Embarrassment doesn't even begin to cover his frame of mind. There is no hole deep enough for him to hide in.
With these words he raises the pistol to his temple and then let go of his grip. In an instant the weapon is whisked away by the weight of the stone, striking, with a sharp crack against the balustrade before vanishing over the side into the water. Sherlock grins, looking triumphant and very pleased with himself.
He almost bounces off his stool and flees into the sitting room, coming to rest his hot face against the icy cold glass of the window overlooking a dark and empty Baker Street.
Sherlock is just glad when John finally leaves him be and closes the door behind himself. Though they are now separated by a more or less solid door (it can be locked but the latch is flimsy), Sherlock is aware that the barrier would yield to a few determined kicks. So he has to be careful and silent.
Walter got really drunk and boasted that he’d once been ordered to kidnap the Duke of Windsor and Mrs Simpson in Portugal, but the attempt failed. He wants us to live in London when the war is over. He hopes Hitler might appoint him governor there (
As it turns out, it's one of the nurses’ birthday. Out of gratitude for all their selfless attendance, Sarah invites everybody round to the pub in the evening. John argues with himself but as Sherlock had acted like a prick all day, he opts for fun and a few pints. Hence, it gets quite late before he returns to Baker Street.
“Anything?” Sherlock tilts his head in this peculiarly unnerving way of his that gets John’s palms all sweaty while his heart flutters in his chest.
One of them, a Major Sholto, saw the photograph of us both in Brighton I have in my bunk. He didn't comment on it, just smiled a bit, looking a little sad. Maybe there are more people like us around here than first meets the eye? Think about it, how it would be if we could be open about our love, talk about it, like the other men talk about their wives and girlfriends.
“Club.” Sherlock mumbles, carefully lifting his head to take a sip of water, squinting his eyes nearly shut.
“Turn on your side, face the wall.” He huffs. As Sherlock hesitates, John explains: “No, I'm not going to put my cock into you just like that, Sherlock.” As Sherlock just stares at him, doubtful, John feels something aching in his chest. “Don't worry.” He reassures Sherlock, brushing an errant curl from his forehead. “I promise.”
“Before? Oh. I don't know if it’s any consolation to you but if you think being turned down changes how I… feel… for you, then you are quite mistaken. I hope that's not too distressing?” John has turned a delicious shade of pink.
John empties his stale beer to wet his dry mouth, pulls a face, then gets up, swaying slightly. He yawns and stretches himself, spine cracking and is suddenly uncomfortably aware of Sherlock still watching him. If he notices that John's t-shirt is yanked up as he raises his arms above his head, displaying at least two inches of toned stomach as well as a trail of downy golden hair disappearing beneath the waistband of John's trousers, he doesn't avert his eyes.
“Now let me run you a bath.” His gangly host is on his feet already, clasping his hands together in front of his face. His eagerness is rather endearing.
During these past weeks of separation my mind has often wandered back to our days in Naples. Was it truly happenstance that we were both there at the same time?
Crisis, pining and suffering finally lead to some kind of catharsis, relieving the tension at least temporally as John and Sherlock find some common ground. Yes, there's eventually some sex in this but it's neither easy nor straightforward.
They stand like this for some time, two men in their forties; two bachelors (one once had been married to his work but that didn't count; the other had been married to an assassin. Mycroft had seen to it that this doesn't count in the end, either). Both their bodies are scarred. Their hair is beginning to grey; John has to wear glasses sometimes now, to read the papers or type on his blog. He'd started blogging again just a few days back when the annulment had finally come through. The first post John made was to inform his readers that he'd be moving back in with Sherlock Holmes.
“Drink?” John asks by way of an answer. When Sherlock gives a curt nod, he walks over to a small table between the windows and pours each of them a stiff whisky. “Tell me again, what are the services you provide?” John’s fingers brush Sherlock’s as he hands over the drink, lingering. Sherlock shivers.
Don’t be ridiculous. Of course, those accusations are totally unfounded. I would never make advances towards any of my students. That boy is a mean little liar. And I'm not having that. He failed his course and thought he could blackmail me to give him a pass if he accused me of something untoward.
Eventually, Sherlock must have fallen asleep also, for he wakes up entangled not so much in the sheets but in John. In his still-sleepy state, it takes Sherlock approximately 2.3 seconds to realise that their legs are entwined and his left arm rests across his flatmate's stomach while his head is pressed between John's shoulder blades. John's left arm is slung over his face, shielding his eyes, while he clutches the pillow with his right.
Salon Kitty was a high-class Berlin brothel used by the Nazi intelligence service for espionage purposes during WW2. This was just too good an opportunity to insert Irene into this story, I'm not even sorry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_Kitty).
35 years, Sherlock. More than half of my life I've spent with you. And now I'm tired. My back hurts, as does my shoulder. My eyesight starts to fail me. I remember your last months, how much you suffered, until it was finally over (why wouldn’t you allow me to help you, love, to deliver you from your misery? A stubborn git to the very last.) – and I’m not prepared to do the same. Besides, I'm lonely. I miss you every day. Your voice. Your touch.
Irene came by again. Witold has finally agreed to met me. I had to tell her about her husband. Shot down three weeks ago over the North Sea. I'm glad she kept her composure and took it with amiable countenance. She is a truly impressive woman, John.
“When he tried it on again I told him I would report him if he didn't stop. I further suggested for him to leave the school at the end of term. He wisely did.”
“John, you are making no sense whatsoever. What has a grocer's daughter to do with your language skills?”
Sherlock sits back on his heels and starts to palm himself lazily, looking down, watching his hand hovering over his cock. His abdominal muscles are tense, easily visible beneath his pale skin and the downy black hair trailing down from his navel. When he eventually raises his eyes, gazing at John from under his lashes, they are almost black and slightly glazed over; there's a lovely pink flush creeping down Sherlock's long neck, slowly spreading over his chest.
“I had a hard enough time with my peers as it was and no one to confide in anyway, so I kept my mouth shut. I just decided to… ignore it all, to forget it. But... you know, we all slept in small dormitories. About eight pubescent boys squashed into one tiny room. You had no personal space, nowhere. Some boys had... magazines. Full of naked women doing inexplicable things. At night they leafed through them and... you know. I was never very much interested in the pictures but... the other boys... At the same time, I was petrified, disgusted with myself. I thought I might become like... Mr Rucastle. So I tried to suppress this... urge... as best as I could. But... in my final year... I met someone.”
John is not sure what he's landed himself into. Blackmail is still an option. But, suddenly, he has another suspicion and feels his stomach lurch. God, has he really been so naive?
“You should eat something.” John reminds him. Sherlock knows he has to appease John; there's no better way than allow him to feed him up.
When the tub is eventually filled, he lowers himself into it with a soft sigh. To his utter surprise, Sherlock opens his dressing gown, lets it slide from his shoulders, and clambers into the tub as well.
Met Irene again. She asked me out for drinks. I declined. But there's something about her... No, not THAT. Yet, I have to admit that she fascinates me. At least I know that she doesn't mind when I watch her. Makes it a little easier. I think she actually put quite a show on today for my benefit.
Both men moan, Sherlock's voice muffled by John's marvellous arse, John's by the forearm he's biting down on hard. He needs the pain as an antidote to this fucking brilliant feeling that sears up his spinal cord, exploding in his brain, releasing a wave of endorphins to rush through his veins as Sherlock continues to fuck his arse with his stiff, wet and very skilled tongue. He drives it deeper and deeper into John's body, poking inside the yielding ring of muscle as far as anatomically possible and John moans uncontrollably because this feels so fucking good John could do this all day why had he never done this before he had no idea people did this thing for real of course he'd heard about it but thought it dirty and filthy and
Over the next few minutes, John takes his time undressing Sherlock, tasting every inch of bare skin he reveals while Sherlock gets more and more brusque, obviously unhappy with the slow progression. His hands flutter over John's back, arse and hips while his eyes waft over John's body in wonder, taking in the scar blooming on John's shoulder, the thick golden hair covering John's chest, his dark nipples, the freckles spreading over his shoulders. John stills as he realises that he is being scanned and lets Sherlock's eyes explore, catalogue and stow away all the information he's surely collecting at this moment. “Take your time, there's no rush.”
The old Milk Tray box slips to the floor as they start to undress each other, knocked over by the seam of John's dressing gown. The last piece of paper to fall out of it is just a scrap, bleached with time, ripped from a cigarette package some seventy years ago. It must have stuck to one of the sides of the box.
Until there’s a slim firm hand reaching between his legs and cupping his cock through his trousers. It’s like a punch to the gut. John’s head thuds back against the shutter as he closes his eyes, gasping softly. Long fingers start to massage him rather expertly as the man moves even closer, positively shielding him. John can feel the stranger's hot breath against his neck as his cock thickens under the seductive touch.
“Can you go deeper?” Sherlock rasps, his voice unsteady and raw. John is past speaking and can only growl in response as he tries to intensify his pleasure, nearly twisting his arm while rocking down onto his fingers. The dry stretch must actually burn but John seems to relish the pain. His hole is swollen but he pushes in relentless. The veins on John's lower arm have protruded to the surface and Sherlock can see every muscle and tendon work and tense.
Sherlock is curled into a tight ball, arms clasped around his lower legs, his forehead resting against his knee caps. “I was packed off to boarding school when I was thirteen,” he begins, sounding restrained and detached, as if he's talking about someone else. “It was quite a venerable institution. Mycroft had graduated there the year before.” Sherlock coughs. “During my first year, one of my classmates drowned in the school swimming pool.”
“Ok. Hamish.” Sherlock puts on one of his enigmatic smiles. “What do you have in mind for this evening?” He walks over to the king-size double bed and sits down at its edge, looking coyly up at his client from under his lashes while his long fingers start plucking at the duvet.
“Are there? Certainly not you. All you have on tomorrow is a visit to your utterly incompetent if time consuming shrink.” Bow and violin each dangle from one of Sherlock's hands at his sides.
John kisses Sherlock's cheek, smiling. “Just not in his shorthand of yours. Write me proper love letters when we are back home. Featuring soppy promises of eternal love combined with brimming elegies about my strong and able body.”
As Sherlock feels his own body sag, he becomes aware of the wet spot he's lying in and turns on his side as well. His face is still on a level with John's now spent but still slightly thickened cock. It's impressive both in length and girth, surrounded by wiry curls a darker shade of blond than the rest of John's body hair and now decorated with dollops of drying semen. Sherlock can smell him and inhales deeply. Glorious.
William puts the bag back where it came from (and makes a mental note to himself to deal with it later when John is out) and decides to humour his lover – well, at least he tries as best he can. “Oh! It's a… box.” He evidently doesn’t sound as interested as John seems to have hoped for.
“Sherlock, wait! I'm such an idiot. You said so yourself. Please, I'm sorry...” He's babbling frantically in his effort to reassure Sherlock, who just stands in the dark hallway, tense and silent. “Of course you can come up. It's just... I didn't know you cared … or wanted.”
But over here my clothes stick to my skin, and there's sand everywhere. And I mean everywhere. I already have a severe chafing in a place where it is really annyoing.
Sherlock feels as if time stretches like syrup. He’s trapped in sticky molasses, with a concerned army doctor by his bedside, who just won’t leave him in peace.
The job at Wilhelmstraße is dreary in the extreme, though the procedures are very efficient. I'm mostly filing. Mycroft would love it.
“But with Mary, it was different. She wasn't part of my work. I did it because I thought I wanted it... her.”
“Like what you see?” John's rough and husky voice hits Sherlock low in his stomach. He forces himself to take his eyes from John's cock and raise them to his face. There's a bead of sweat on John's brow and upper lip and his pupils are blown wide, his usually light blue eyes now an intense deep violet.
Eventually, John stops. Against a darkened brick wall leans the tall, thin frame of a young man, hollowing his cheeks while sucking on a cigarette, the orange glow illuminating a strange, long face that seems to have been drawn by one of those expressionist painters that hang on the walls in John's Upper Eastside apartment: all angles and shadows, huge eyes, sharp cheekbones, full lips and tussled hair. He's wearing the usual tight black trousers while his shirt is unbuttoned almost down to his navel, exposing white, hairless skin.
“Listen, John, I really didn’t know what to do with him back then. I tried but…” Greg is lost, desperately searching for the right words and failing. He swallows hard, searching John’s face with his eyes: “John, I'm sorry.”
But no matter how fast he moves, John is up and behind him just in time to press his hands firmly against the door, detaining Sherlock from rushing out of the room.
Sherlock's fist crushes against John's jaw with surprising force and accuracy, splitting the upper lip and loosening at least one canine. John tumbles backwards, shocked.
“I don't mind.” John finally opens his eyes and turns slowly around. “Morning, gorgeous.” He strokes back a wayward curl from Sherlock's forehead, still smiling at his flatmate. His hand brushes the side of Sherlock’s neck, around to his nape, lingers. Sherlock holds his breath. John’s hand continues to slowly wander down along Sherlock's spine, fingertips barely brushing over protruding vertebrae. Sherlock can't help it, he shivers and his eyes flutter close as John reaches the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
“Because he doesn’t book threesomes.” Sherlock’s voice is a deep rumble, but turns into a soft moan when John starts to nibble at his earlobe.
Vera Lynn's voice fills her kitchen as she prepares a cup of tea, just like Sherlock prefers it, with way too much sugar and just a splash of milk. John, on the other hand, likes a stiff whisky in the evenings, so she pours him one and sets it down next to the tea cup on her kitchen table.
“Go. Just go away! Leave me alone.” Sherlock turns and strides over to the window, his back to John. He's tense, his voice cold, detached, betraying no emotion.
. We're in this together.” William replies, shuffling back a little to look John square in the face. His skin is blotchy, his eyes are swollen and there’s some snot running from his nose, gathering on his upper lip – but to John he has never been more beautiful. They grin at each other through their teary gaze like two lovesick idiots.
John has averted his eyes and is staring down at his plate after spotting a purple mark on the junction of Sherlock's shoulder and neck; it's none of his business, really, but it blatantly reminds John of what Sherlock has been up to last night. John can't face him, not like this – wet, half naked, clad only in clingy silk, displaying the evidence of another man's access to his body. So he shovels eggs into his mouth, rather surprised he can eat at all. But as he hasn't slept and Sherlock's story has disturbed him, he just needs sustenance to keep going.
They make love while around them bombs fall from the sky, burning down their world. Yet here, though the world explodes, these two survive...
“You slipped me your address. Do you remember? Last night, Smithfield Market...?” John feels his cheeks heat as he stammers helplessly, searching his pockets for the piece of paper to occupy his hands.
His lips are swollen, saliva glistening on his chin. His pupils are so wide that his eyes seem almost black.
John goes back into the hall; Sherlock's Belstaff still hangs on its hook. He seldom leaves the flat these days anyway... another point not to be considered too closely right now.
“So, you think, when we do it as John and Sherlock, it's boring?” John sounds offended. Great! Just what Sherlock tried to avoid. Why does he always get himself between a rock and a hard place?
“What?” John asks, dazed, opening his eyes to stare at Sherlock's flushed face, kiss-swollen red lips still wet. John realises Sherlock swallows nervously as he blinks him into focus, commanding at least some of his blood to return to his brain and perform some basic cerebral functions. “Sherlock, what is it. You all right?”
John scoops a little closer. “You always say that. But... don't you want to... I don't know, get off?”
It's hot and humid in the car. The air smells of cabbage, unwashed people, wool, wet dog and cigarettes. John is glad when the train eventually reaches Baker Street and he can finally get off. The station is a labyrinth, a hideous conglomerate of older stations, fused together by narrow stairs, aching lifts and dark passages. When he surfaces , John takes a few deep breaths in the bright morning sun.
In the end, they shower together before returning to the rumpled sheets. It's getting light outside, the faint hint of dawn visible on the horizon behind New York's famous skyline.
“Got quite an eyeful, did you?” He asks, while giggling so hard his eyes water. Sherlock cringes at the innuendo but John's laughter is contagious and soon they are both shaking with it.
William throws the Union Jack pillow at his lover's head as an answer before rummaging through the box again.
“Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,” their client begins in a rather subtle but still recognisable accent, “that money is nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it’s any use in getting you to the truth. Sean Dunbar is innocent and has to be cleared, and it’s up to you to do it. Name your figure!”
And John has to admit – at least to himself – that Sherlock is right. Nevertheless, John can't take his eyes off Sherlock. Suddenly, the man seems so alive; flesh and blood instead of the detached genius he presents to the world. John desperately wants to touch him but not in a tender way. He wants to throttle the infuriating prat, closing one hand around this long pale throat; wants to shake him while his curls bop, fists clenched tight around Sherlock’s sinewy upper arms; wants to beat some sense into him, his fist splitting Sherlock’s plush arrogant lip as it crashes into it forcefully, drawing blood.
fiddled with the valves; so the money will run through their fingers as usual, but at this moment, they both feel rather comfortably gratified).
Sherlock's head slumps down on his arms, folded on the kitchen table and he winces as John switches on the lights. It's too bright and evidently hurts Sherlock's eyes, as he groans into the crook of his arms but John doesn't give a toss. He slams a glass of water hard next to Sherlock's head, the liquid sloshing over the rim.
“It's rather common. Not as common as my first name, but still...” John falls silent, toying with the belt of his dressing gown. “Coincidence.” He mumbles.
Sherlock turns his face and looks at John, raising one eyebrow, asking blasé: “What precautions? Taking up self defence training? Getting a Bull Terrier? Carrying pepper spray, which is illegal, by the way? All of this won't stop her pursuer. As I said, he's obsessed with her. He can't stop. The only thing she could do is vanish from his radar and hide but that would destroy her career perspectives. The easiest thing for her would be to just give in and let him have his way with her.”
If she doesn't plough through my stuff, however, she records marvellous Sherlock podfics in a wonderful English accent. Check her out on AO3 at http://archiveofourown.org/users/Lockedinjohnlock, it's truly worth it!
Walter invited me over for the weekend. His wife is gone, visiting her mother. The house is in Weißensee, a leafy suburb. I think I know what will happen and I dread it. Sorry, I probably shouldn't write this down here for you. I guess I'll just lie back and think of England.
“'Course you have.” John is, by now, ok with intestines. Whole body parts still make him a little queasy when unexpectedly encountered in the fridge – or anywhere else Sherlock might think expedient to deposit them, they look so very human and remind John of his own mortality, whereas internal organs only remind him of specimens in medical school.
“Shower.” He mumbles a few moments later. John unties him before offering him the half-drained waterbottle.
“Sexlive!” Sherlock snorts sarcastically. “You mean your sad endeavours of chatting up lonely middle aged divorcees in faceless chain pubs, always leaving before breakfast, sneaking out of their too soft beds and their depressing flats at the break of dawn?”
“Shlck, what the hell? Stop fidgeting!” John mumbles, his speech slightly slurred from sleep. He pulls the hand he's holding up to his chest, their entwined fingers coming to rest on John's sternum. John sighs contently as he wraps Sherlock's long arm around him like a shroud.
John is still panting heavily, his eyes screwed shut. He can feel Sherlock's hot unsteady breath gushing over his wet cleft, sending goosebumps up his sweaty spine while his wobbly legs start to go numb.
And then there's John and Sherlock wants to ask: “Would you wait for me, even if I was removed from our time and died?” But he just screams in horror as his body disintegrates, until John whispers softly: “Well, don't cry, 'cause it's only the last part of life and I'm still by your side. And it will happen to you like it'll happened to me and the rest of the people we know. Like the summers all end and trees lose their leaves and the water turns back into snow. We're all here for a while, then we go, living for love and love alone. And you will be with those angels in disguises, cleverly holding their hands over your eyes to make from your nightmares the nighttime.” John is talking some more and it seems rather important but Sherlock only sees his lips move and can't understand anything, because there's suddenly another sound, sinking in, drowning out John's warm, reassuring voice...
Sherlock's room is almost dark as John enters; only the orange light from the street is filtering dimly through the curtains. John is just clad in his pants – naked would have been a bit too much but putting more clothes on seemed superfluous also and as he's not sure what to expect, coming onto Sherlock wrapped only in a towel might be considered a bit too intimidating.
“Call him yourself, you pompous prick. Why is it always me who has to deal with your bloody brother? Ok, calm down, I'll phone him.”
