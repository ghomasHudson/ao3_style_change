“Ah, you are kind.” T’Challa coughed, looking a little uncomfortable. “I hesitate to ask this, Dr Stark, but - is the connection secure on your end?”
“Yes, boss.”
“Do you not think that the primary concern should be our common enemy?” Mordo asked, his tone mild and his expression even.
Tony dropped his head back on the pillow with a groan. “I can’t fucking wait.”
“Neither will I,” T’Challa said, in the tone of one brooking no disagreements. “We have taken precautions.” He inclined his head towards Mordo’s new best friends.
The car moved off.
Minoru stepped forward and wrapped her arm around his shoulders, pushing up on her tiptoes so she could reach him with the suit still on. “It will hear you, when you speak,” she murmured in his ear. “When you need me, call.” She stepped back. “Be safe, Mr Stark. You, and your… child.” She looked across at Mordo. “My dear. Let us remain friends, at least for a while longer.” She extended one hand, and waited until Mordo bowed over it formally, looking as if he had swallowed a lemon.
He grimaced. “You did a good job with those laces,” he said to the bowed head. “Guess your mom taught you how to do that, huh?”
He cracked one eye open and peered up at him blearily. “The Lonely Mountain?” He hazarded, mumbling around the ice chip. “Did I dream that? There was a - guy with a sword…”
OK, he could work with that. What had Jarvis done when he'd had nightmares as a kid? Warm milk and a bedtime story; he could do that. Well, the warm milk probably wasn't a good idea, given the state of Steve's lungs, but... “Well, how about we read a little bit instead, would that be OK?” He took the silence for assent. “All right, what do we have…” The little nightstand also had a small selection of children’s books, and Tony rifled through a few of them - the Ugly Duckling, really? Who the hell had chosen these? - before settling down with a volume of Arthurian mythology (reading ages 9+).
Steve had explained.
Steve shifted in Tony’s arms, looking up at him with wet blue eyes. (He didn’t say anything.)
previously...
Yeah, OK. She was either with their equivalent of the State Department, or part of the security detail the General had been briefing, earlier. Because, OK, she might have recognised Rhodey as Colonel Rhodes, fine, but she also knew that the kid with Tony was a ward of the court, not Tony’s own. Which was… interesting. “Is fixer not correct?” He asked pleasantly, falling into step with her, Rhodey on his other side.
“What?” Tony snapped.
And in Hong Kong - and New York - there were others like him. Others who dealt with threats the rest of the world could not comprehend.
He closed the folder with a heavy ‘thump’ and set it to one side, bending over the tablet so that his face was almost entirely filling the video-screen. “But I get what you’re saying. I’m not rushing into it, Pep, I promise; I mean, technically others are rushing me into it - but that’s beside the point - but I just, I just -”
Legally.
“Does he always behave like this?” She asked Rhodey on her way out, raising an eyebrow at Tony’s offer to walk her back to her… base? Quad? Wherever it was she lay down her weapons, anyway.
I feel like every chapter for the last few months has been "and this one was

“You said you liked these, right? King Arthur?”
Barton found him like that, a couple of hours later, his head hanging low on his chest as he nodded off.

He’d had a pristine example of how not to do it in the form of Rogers’s fucking letter. If ever there was a
“Why is it that
“It’s not!”
“... yeah, I know how that goes.” Wilson looked at him for a long moment. “I was against it, by the way.”
(He couldn’t do anything here, he knew that. They were both trapped inside, waiting for the next disaster. At least if Tony had access to something other than carefully-curated consumer tech at his disposal he could try to figure out what was affecting Steve, how the bleed between the two Steves had been effected.
His head felt like someone had tenderised it with a meat hammer. “Ow.” His voice was barely above a whisper, dry and papery. “What the fuck happened?” Something cool nudged his lips and he opened his mouth to accept the ice chip.
Tony cuts him off with a wave of his hand. (It costs him, because the gray isn't all gone, but he still has his other hand on the edge of the worktop. He can do this. He can.) “Or. You can work it off in trade.”
Tony thought, aching.
” he muttered.
Those kids had already known who Iron Man was. Hell, one of them had been clutching an Avengers lunch-box. And they'd still crawled in between stale vomit and dropped Happy Meals to get away from him. What chance did Tony have with a kid who didn't even know if he was human?
But right now? Right now, it's not really practical to sit, or to reach for a lozenge, or to grab some juice. He can’t even reach for his meds, because he left them in the penthouse. Right now, St-
God damn it, Tony fucking hated magic.
In the corner, Steve’s head shot up. “You said a bad word,” he said around a mouthful of crayon. “I tell you, and I tell you, and you keep saying the bad word.”
Well, the alternative was setting down somewhere and, frankly, with the way the HUD was flickering, Tony wasn’t sure they’d be able to make it all the way to the mountains, let alone cope with a detour.
but he managed to clamp his mouth shut before that slipped out.
This was a hell of a lot worse than Steve not trusting him to be his protector. This was… He didn’t know what to do.
“No,” Tony admitted. If he thought that T’Challa might oppose him, he would not have come. He’d have simply taken Steve and left, if it had come to that. The child had sufficiently warm clothing to be OK on a short trip, and Tony would have had FRIDAY arrange for pick-up the moment they were outside of Wakanda’s borders. He wouldn’t have liked to do it - no point in alienating absolutely everyone with a single move - but if it had come to that… no, he didn’t need T’Challa’s permission. Steve was his responsibility. “But I could do with your support. And your sister.” If he had access to Shuri and Jane Foster - and to their lab and results - they might be able to figure out what was happening. They might be able to get ahead of it.
Tony’s mouth was dry. “Remove keyword, ‘Bucky’.” Twelve more.
On the screen, Jane Foster raised an eyebrow. “I can call back later?”
Rhodey nodded. “When I was in Erbil, yeah.” He chewed his lip again.
“M’Baku spilled the beans?” Barton snorted. “Yeah, he wasn’t very keen on us not mentioning it. Said it was dishonourable.”
The guards standing behind Mordo stepped forward, and the guy - to his credit - did not protest. He nodded politely to T’Challa - and Tony, of all people - and left with them, Wanda and Barnes still flanking him. Barnes looked back over one shoulder and nodded to Tony as he exited.
“Well, it doesn’t.” He stared at his knees, reaching down to fiddle with the support on the left. Almost instinctively, Tony started to reach for him and Rhodey smacked his hand away. “It’s fine, leave it. And it
Tony thought. That was professional compassion, right there: bland and tasteless and - “I wanted to talk to Rhodey about this. That’s why I called. I - I won’t listen to the others. I shouldn’t have listened to that one, either.”
Tony stared up at him, barely conscious, unable to speak or scream through his exhaustion. He could see the concentration on Yinsen’s face as he gently positioned the heavy magnet, encasing it in something slimy and stinging before readying it to slide it in. (Antiseptic, he would think later. Yinsen must have bathed him in the stuff. How the hell had Yinsen kept him from getting infected?)
Unthinkingly, he rubbed at his sternum, at the echo of remembered pain.
“Thank you for joining us, Dr Stark. I am pleased you are recovered. And I understand that Captain Rogers is also recovering well and is expected to be discharged from the PICU imminently.” There was a brief murmur of relief around the table at that; although not of surprise, Tony noted. Clearly the kiddification of Rogers had already made the rounds. “Agent Barton will lead this briefing - Agent, Barton, if you would -” T’Challa took the seat next to Romanoff and tapped at one of the tablets on the table. A screen rolled down the far wall and the lights dimmed slightly.
“Shhhh, come on, it’s OK, you can tell me.” A thought struck him. He’d been jumpy and frightened earlier as well. Maybe... “Did you have a nightmare? About the base?”
Yes, Bucky will be in this fic, it's taking longer than I thought to get all the pieces to where I need them to be, but rest assured he will be along shortly.
“My advisers believe that the effect on Captain Rogers - and the sacrificed soldiers - was unintended. There are significant indicators that the pain of the soldiers was used to create a temporal event, as you describe it, Dr Stark.” He frowned, tapping his fingers on the table. “If the event was a door, then the soldiers were part of the doorframe. Captain Rogers was in the blast radius.”
Comments really are love.
He liked Hill, even though she pretty much hated him. He did. And he trusted Pepper’s judgement. But… “You here to babysit me, Agent Hill?”
The fact that both Maximoff and Barnes - the two who had had the most success fighting the swordsman - had been permanent glimpses out of the corner of Tony’s eye since he’d regained consciousness; not close enough to frighten Steve, but close enough to defend them if there was an attack. Dhakiya sending through the child’s things when the parcel would have been easily traced. And, as a final cherry on the trifle, Barton, ordering children’s toys from Amazon Prime and having them be delivered in Jabariland.
Next time - efforts kick off on multiple fronts on the de-magicking plans, the deployed group gets a chance to see first-hand what's going on, and Rhodey really hates physio.
If whatever Rogers had to say really stuck in his craw he could always turn off the recordings; not like the real version had given him that option.
No, that was
The flat silence told him all he needed to know. “... Right.”
“I saw it too,” Barton pointed out quietly. “I could go in your place, if you want to stay here.”
The bath took longer than planned. Steve had evidently decided that jam today was better than jam tomorrow (so to speak), and he took full advantage of the opportunity to cover himself, Tony, and the entire bathroom in water. Tony made sure that he didn’t drown (and that he was at least vaguely approaching cleanliness) but otherwise left him to splash about. Packing would probably be easier if he didn’t have the child underfoot, anyway. He made sure that the child safeties were on (and that idea was definitely something he was stealing and reverse-engineering as soon as humanly possible) and left Steve to amuse himself while he checked that he had all of the child’s medication and any other necessities packed. He didn’t have much of his own stuff here, obviously, having arrived in just the suit, but Steve had already been subjected to a number of losses and Tony didn’t want to add to that by accidentally leaving behind a favourite crayon or, well, whatever it was that Steve had become attached to and failed to tell anyone about. (There was bound to be something; that was how kids worked, right?)
After a long moment, Pepper nodded, her hand tightening over Happy’s. “I understand. Just - promise me you’ll be careful? And - if you need anything from us, if you need us to arrange anything -”
A small sob came from the bed, Steve’s whole body shaking with it.
Steve peered up at him from under his fringe, clearly exhausted and terrified. He listed a little to the left, blinking slowly. There was a long dark bruise on his shin and both of his knees were skinned; he'd clearly fallen over more than a couple of times since the whatever-it-was had happened. “Are - are you a robot?”
“I am not playing
Dropping back down at the table, Tony sighed and rubbed at his exposed hand. He was so fucking tired of all of this. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t take your word on it.”
She looked at where a hard-eyed Steve was bringing down the shield on Tony’s chest, at where Barnes was wearing Obie’s face as he reached for the reactor.
Tony blinked at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
thing, this thing that had been taken away from Rhodey - this thing he hadn’t mentioned to Tony previously, had probably never intended to confess - this was not something that Tony had known about.
The guide raised an eyebrow at him. “You may not purchase it,” she said severely, as if he had insulted her parents and spit in her food. “It is a
Tony nodded as gently as he could. “I know. I know, kiddo. And I know he’s really sorry you’re hurting.” Which was… probably a safe bet. Steve’s compassion would stretch to his child self, right? “You remember me saying that you used to be bigger, and someone made you a kid again?”
Tony thought, with a glance at Romanoff.
Would he be able to say anything at all? Or would he be looking at the child’s bed, and the abandoned sneakers on the side, the Iron Man motif rampant on each foot, a tracer tucked in beside the laces….
Tony was irrationally amused by her preference for Ross over Rogers as a conversation topic. “Not yet. I’ll need to get him settled in first.” There were a couple of schools on the premises that would probably work - secure perimeter, all his own people, no one to blink an eye at Barnes-in-disguise accompanying Steve everywhere - but he figured a few days getting settled in was probably helpful.
Moving gently so as not to wake him, Tony deposited Steve back down on the foil-pallet, his back to the open suit. “FRIDAY, crank up the heat a bit.” He tucked the foil blanket around Steve carefully, frowning at how cold his fingers felt. His capillary refill was also worrying. He’d warmed up some, but he was still dangerously cold, and he hadn’t managed to eat any of the food Tony had brought him. None of this filled Tony with any confidence.
For the moment, he was about half a click away from the palace and as high as he dared to be, given the damage to the suit. (And possibly to his head.) If the flight systems failed, hopefully he’d be able to manage a safe(ish) landing, but until then (and until he’d figured out how the attacker had been able to track Steve down) he was keeping far away from anyplace a portal could conveniently open up again.
in the Lancelot-Grail cycle. I liked the idea of little!Steve knowing his Arthurian mythology, and of course Tony only really offers his name once, when they first meet, when Steve is probably too frightened to really take it in.
“Tony, come on. You awake? Look at me.”
T’Challa frowned. “I see.” His gaze seemed to rest over Tony’s shoulder, on Barton, disapproving. “My apologies. I was under the impression that you had been briefed on this.” There was a pause, during which time Barton did not say anything to defend himself, but met T’Challa’s gaze steadily. After a moment, the king continued. “It was not my intention to withhold information from you. You are welcome to meet with my sister, if you wish. She, too, would like to make your acquaintance.” A corner of his mouth quirked. “It is good for her to work with Dr Foster; she has not had anyone she could collaborate on this level with, before. It is difficult, when they are so young, and so brilliant.” He held Tony’s gaze. “I am sure you understand.”
He honestly didn’t know what the fuck to say to something like that. “Well, as long as you own it.”
“I’ve known you since you were a snotty teen who could barely reach my shoulders. I know better. Once you’ve decided something is your responsibility, trying to talk you out of it is a fool’s errand.” Rhodey tipped his head to one side. “But I figure - that’s why you called me, right? You need someone to have your back. And I do, Tones. You know that, right? I’ll always have your back.”
he told the thing-that-wasn’t-him, trying to push it out. It was like slamming himself into a brick wall, if the brick wall kept trying to catch him and cushion him and stop him from flailing, wrapping itself around him what seemed to be an attempt at comfort.
“We’re in range,” Barton murmured. “How do you want to play this?”
“And yet you keep yelling as if me getting thwacked by Samurai Jack was in any way my fault,” Tony said through the sudden nausea. “Where’s Steve?” 24 hours… who had been watching the kid?
He really was going to murder Barton. “Why are you still - Legolas, I said you could stay if you
Rhodey looked between him and Wilson, his expression suddenly uncertain. “Am I interrupting?”
FRIDAY said, her voice wavering.
He looked down at the sleeping child, at how his hand had crept without his volition to gentle the tangled sweaty hair and soothe away his childish terrors, and he knew the truth of it:
After a moment he pressed his lips to the top of Steve’s head, careless of the green paint.
He doesn't know. He doesn't have the time to enumerate all the ways in which he now needs to grade the people in his life, in his space, according to how threatened he feels. “I'll tell you later.” For now, he has more immediate problems.
(What would Tony do, if that was truly the older Steve coming back through on the recording?)
He slid out of his chair and lay down on the ground instead, his feet flat on the floor, staring up at the ceiling and breathing as slowly and as deeply as he could manage. After about twenty minutes, his pulse had slowed down enough so that it didn’t feel as though his heart would tear itself loose in his chest. He sat up cautiously and dragged himself to the wall, sitting up with his back against it, the pebble on the floor beside him.
“I am aware, yes.” T’Challa’s face gave nothing away.
This was technology beyond anything he’d seen, barring one specific nightmare example, years ago, when the skies had been torn open.
He thought about it and decided that he didn’t quite have the bandwidth to deal with it at the moment. If Barton wanted to talk, he’d have to bring it up himself. And besides...
Tony swiped through on his tablet and the familiar hum of the scrambler filled the penthouse. The lines were normally pretty damn secure, of course, but if T’Challa was calling about certain guests that Tony suspected were sleeping under his roof, then it couldn’t hurt to get all his toys up and running on the off chance that someone (Ross) had been able to crack his encryption. “All set. Shoot.”
he thought uneasily. Steve could be altered in any number of ways and they’d have no way of knowing until he woke up. Checking up on him was pointless.
Steve, the Steve that had smiled at him from across his workshop, that had sparred with him long after everyone else had gone to bed, the Steve that he’d looked at and thought,
The attacker was dressed in what looked like a knock-off of a Buddhist monk’s outfit, albeit in somber colours and with some rather swashbuckling boots to complete the look. About Tony’s height, medium build, he had a close-cropped afro and a faint scar on his forehead. If he hadn’t been dressed up as some sort of weird cross between Robin Hood and the Dalai Lama, Tony wasn’t sure he would have been able to pick him out of a crowd.
, she said nothing about kneeing you in the balls.” Barton looked at him for a long moment before groaning and sitting down at the table, watching warily as Tony joined him. “All right. Fine. So we should have told you.”
changed - the moment he’d found Steve in that bunker, half-frozen and terrified.
Despite himself, he glanced over his shoulder at the seat directly behind his.
He is inches away from wringing his hands in worry, the fucking boy scout, Tony thinks viciously. “Underhanded,” Tony manages after a moment, “trying to blame my favorite girl when I know it was all that traitor Pepper.”
you should probably thwap him over the head with something heavy.”
Rhodey is... missing Sam. And Sam is not doing well. (Obviously.)
, don’t look!” He grabbed for the kid, clapping a hand over his eyes. “Why are you out of the suit? I told you to stay put!”
Wanda looked away.
Startled, Tony flailed awake before he’d managed to orient himself, lashing at whoever was hovering over him.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, right.” He moved so that he was sat against the headboard, pulling the kid up to lean against his chest and sliding the mask over his face. “Let’s have a few big breaths and get those lungs nice and open.”
God, they were all such a fucking mess.
“Yes, boss. Ms Potts called a little while ago and left a message. Your escort has the rest of your briefing and arranged the cover stories for Agent Barton and Mr Barnes. She also reminded you that the cleaning staff and security staff in the facility have all be vetted and that you’re not to frighten them off.”
some small, mean part of him thought,
Barton shook his head. “He couldn’t. We got the message in the dead drop after you’d already arrived at the base; once T’Challa knew you needed collecting, he gave us the details and FRIDAY provided the quinjet.”
Barton scowled and looked away.
“Uh huh,” Steve mumbled, cuddling into Tony’s chest. “But I’m tired now. Can we go home?” He reached up with sticky fingers to hold on to the edge of the suit’s collar, his head on Tony’s chest, lit up in blue by the glow of the arc reactor.
turning around. “A monster, huh? Unlike you, I suppose?”
“I rather think if you are desperate enough to come to Hong Kong from - Wakanda, is it?” She waved a hand apologetically at Okoye, who was still in her Dora uniform. “Yes - if you are desperate enough to come to Hong Kong to simply ask for a reference, you have acknowledged that you need his expertise.” Her smile twisted. “Mordo is… very capable. We do not agree on many things, but he will not steer you wrong when it counts.”
Romanoff shook her head. “Not them. We need to brief the others. Is everyone here?”
I saw
“How was the discussion?” Vision asked, from his perch atop one of the nearby tables.
Tony cleared his throat and turned to Okoye.
"FRIDAY, am I seeing things? Is that what I think it is?"
He looked up at Vision - at the camera - and blinked, as if in a daze.
Maximoff said, as if it didn’t mean erasing this version of him out of existence.
it,” Tony muttered.
“It’s a Terminator portal,” Barton explained, wide-eyed and earnest. “My bet is that SkyNet is behind it all.” He’d grown more and more skittish as the slide show had flicked through from the wide shots through to the extreme close-ups on the cuts and the arrangement of the limbs. The last shot - a bloody handprint on the wall, as if someone had braced themselves against it, readying to walk through the empty space - lingered long after Tony closed his eyes. Barton had been making inappropriate jokes with increasing frequency throughout, and although once upon a time Tony would have been right there with him, that ship had sailed a long time ago.
Dammit, he really needed to have that conversation with Rhodey as soon as humanly possible.
A small hand landed on his arm, followed by something cold and sticky being put in Tony’s hand carefully. “I brought you a crayon, so you don’t get sad,” Steve said in a tiny voice.
Tony thought bitterly, pushing himself up on his elbows. He followed her gaze to the tableau.
Barnes said, and yanked out the reactor.
The doctors had told him that Steve should be safe to discharge in a day or so, as long as he was confined to his bed and taking his meds. His long bouts of sleeping - interspersed with some horrific-sounding hacking - had done nothing to persuade Tony of his supposed rapid rate of recovery.
Tony had to physically restrain himself from grimacing.
The world dipped and fell.
the capitalist pig coloniser before hating him? “Here,” the nurse said, offering him a bottle of something that smelled minty. “For the aftertaste. Swish, then spit.”
Tony rested a hand in the centre of Rhodey’s back, watching his T-shirt ride up to reveal his spine. The bandages had come off - thank god - but the surgery scars were still red and raised across his skin. Tony traced his fingers gently alongside one, not touching the skin, just… committing it to memory.
Many thanks to phnelt for doing the heavy lifting in researching likely Californian locations for me, and in helping me think through the next few sections of the fic. Palo Alto seems to be one of the likely places Stark Industries would have a presence, and sticking to a closed community would be one way to keep Steve's presence a secret... at least, in theory.
Barnes walked past them, carrying what looked like the world’s largest machine gun.
Tony looked at Minoru’s small figure, calculating. She
Okoye raised an eyebrow at him, then nodded.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Does your wife allow this kind of potty-mouth at home?”
“OK,” he soothed, his movements slow and gentle. “It’s all OK, you don’t have to see him, I’m here.” Without thinking, he pressed his lips to the top of Steve’s head.
Rhodey had to let go of his hand to use the wheelchair. Tony left his hand on Rhodey’s shoulder instead.
“No. The suit’s locked in on the Palo Alto facility landing bay and can meet us there, and I have Steve’s meds in my bag.” He unbuckled Steve carefully and slid him into his arms. The boy stirred fretfully and then slumped back into sleep on Tony’s shoulder. Barton picked up Tony’s bag and fell into step beside him, Barnes bringing up the rear. “OK, let’s do this.” Behind them, the suit powered on, ready for flight.
Rhodey couldn’t meet his eyes. “Yeah. There was a, uh,” he coughed, “proof positive, so to speak. Obviously I’m not supposed to do anything for a bit, but, uh...”
Barton hadn’t been making a cheap shot, and had just managed to fit his entire foot in his mouth.
No, there was too much at stake. Even if he focused solely on the welfare of the child, there was still too much unknown, too much being left to chance. And with the adult Steve possibly still somewhere in there - still aware, in flashes if not in perpetuity, of all that had been done to him - how could they afford to wait?
He heard the whimper before he saw the movement out of the corner of his eye. His head whipped around, the HUD tracking the source of the source and zeroing in on it in seconds. "
Mordo simply nodded.
Plus, this line of questioning had the bonus of making Barton blanche and squirm as if someone had put a hook through him. “Er…” He hovered uncertainly over the chair by Tony’s side, as if contemplating bolting.
Tony could feel his mouth hanging open. “You
“Yeah,” he said, and managed a smile. “That worked out just great.” He cleared his throat. “Listen. Not that I don’t appreciate the vote of confidence, but I need a bit of a favour as well. I don’t know how up to speed you are, but we’ve made a temporary alliance with the sword-wielding maniac from before.”
faint!”
“When did you guys get back?” Tony asked, surprised. He had thought Vision and Lang were still out in Burkina Faso, being visibly
Mordo looked over his shoulder and raised an eyebrow at T’Challa. “Ah. There is not a consensus?”
Tony caved first. “So, your boyfriend hates me.”
Steve thought this over and seemed to accept the logic of the plan, relaxing a little. Then, “so is he coming through the door?”
, exactly, do you want that I’m not providing, here?”
Tony froze.
The small head snapped up. “Bucky?” Steve asked, his voice tremulous. “He’s here?”
She looked down at her fingers around his wrist, watching as the gauntlet retracted, leaving Tony’s hand bare. Slowly, carefully, she tucked her hand in his.
“And, what, you failed to notice there were
Mordo shrugged a little and seemed to retreat at that, with a quick flickering glance at the back of Wanda’s head.
that!”
The flight back was seemingly endless, although Tony could not have recounted how he spent a minute of his time, merely that it had dragged through him in pained increments. He had sharp shooting pains up both arms by the time they landed, as if by clenching his fists sufficiently hard he could pause time and keep Steve safe until his return. Steve was hurt. Steve was
“I’m not hugging you,” she said before he could get a word out.
Tony grunted and carried on, cursing under his breath when he sliced his finger open. He’d had to spend about an hour inside the console, and had taken to checking in periodically on Steve’s location. “Maybe another five minutes,” he promised.
side, D’Artagnan. You haven’t exactly endeared yourself to anyone here.”
“Tony, I’m really not sure you should do this,” Pepper said, her voice strained. Her hair was a messy halo around her head, falling to her shoulders in back-lit waves. She was still blinking sleep out of her eyes and shrugging into a dressing down as she sat down in front of the personal video screen.
“Yeah,” Rhodey says, and it sounds painful. “Yeah, he could have.”
; believe me, I do, and if I could give anything to undo it… but, listen. You’re no good to Rhodey if you don’t look after yourself, ‘cause all it does is make Rhodey do it. And he has enough on his plate.”
of them? Barton, maybe, but -
After a beat, Tony looked away. “Yeah, okay,” he said, trying to to keep his tone even. “Thanks, I guess.” He could hear the bitterness in his voice.
Comments are love.
God, Tony loved that woman. “Well,” he said brightly, “it sounds like she has everything well in hand.” He was going to have to buy Pepper a thank-you present. Possibly an entire store of Jimmy Choos.
She stepped towards the figures, touching Steve’s face, tracing the outline as it shimmered and changed.
At Tony’s disbelieving look, he sighed. “He has pneumonia. Wouldn’t be too much of a problem normally, but with the pleurisy and the low body temperature, they want to be on the safe side.”
“When will the child be arriving?” Dhakiya asked. “I understand that he is still at the hospital.”
Tony thought. “Seconded,” he said, his eyes on Mordo.
out of line, and I swear to God we’re gonna find out if keelhauling is possible on a plane. You get me?”
Because whatever else Captain America might have done, Tony had thought of Steve Rogers as his friend once. (Even if it had not been mutual.)
“Seriously.
The fifth time he jolted awake, he gave up and moved to sit in the chair next to Steve’s bed, his bedclothes gathered loosely around him and his hand on the child’s arm. Steve was still too thin, of course, and sleeping far too much. Tony had some vague idea that kids were supposed to get up early and be full of energy all the time; obviously Steve had a pre-existing condition, but surely he should have still had more energy than he exhibited. After all, he’d grow up to -
Dammit.
Behind him, Barnes was watching him critically. “You won’t need to evacuate him,” he said. “And if you do, you will need someone to guide you through the tunnels.”
he thought, and his pulse sped up at the realisation. He should take - where were his -
“M’Baku wants to be part of the discussions,” Barton cut in quietly.
It has been such a long time since the last update! Many thanks to all those still sticking with this fic. I had to take a break from writing for RL reasons, but I'm back into the swing of it now, and updates should follow in a more regular fashion. I'd like to finish this fic before Endgame comes out, if at all possible.
Tony wasn’t sure whether he should be insulted on Barton’s behalf or not. He settled for shrugging a little.
The connection cut off.
“I told you,” he said, his voice deliberately light. “I’m gonna move us back to the US for a bit. I’m gonna do the heavy lifting on this, Pep, I promise. All I need is a favour or two.”
Across the room, Barton watched this all play out, expressionless. “I’ll get Nat to contact Hill and Jane Foster,” he said abruptly. “You’re… you need to stay here.” He turned to leave, tugging Barnes with him.
Mordo nodded slowly.
“Is that right? Stuff like what?”
Actually, now that he thought about it, he rather suspected that Shuri herself wasn’t adverse to the idea of doing this outside of her brother’s direct control (T’Challa’s blessing notwithstanding), as she hadn’t volunteered to fly back instead. Her lab had been damaged in the succession scuffle, if he’d caught T’Challa’s drift correctly, but that didn’t mean that she wouldn’t be able to rebuild it pretty fucking quickly if the occasion called for it. No, he’d bet good money that Shuri wouldn’t be volunteering to come back to her brother’s apron strings unless the world was actually ending. He couldn’t really blame her, either; T’Challa had charisma in spades, and intelligence wasn’t the be-all and end-all. Tony himself had easily been smarter than Rogers - and less easily, than Fury - and had still let them order him about for the better part of five years. “The lab’s not portable, and - look, I’m not just going to sit around here and wait, OK? I have to come back to the US. And I’m in charge of Steve, I can’t just abandon him - and he needs to be there in person for us to figure out what the hell is going on. This really is the best way of doing it.”
It hit the swordsman dead-on - and glanced off the energy shield he’d raised instinctively, bouncing upwards to punch a hole straight through the ceiling, all the way up through the roof.
? Why would I?”
“Tony-”
this. He’d missed
He was taking Steve and leaving for the States. There wasn’t a much more final way to say ‘bye’ other than, well, what they’d already done to each other. OK, sure, they technically had a world to save - what was new - but, other than Steve turning back, what exactly would be the short-to-medium plan? He’d asked Pepper to set up a few things for him, and T’Challa had given Shuri a heads-up that he was headed her way, but his involvement with the team was changing -
Tony was looking at Hill instead. “You guys go on ahead, I’ll catch up,” he said.
“N-no.” He scrunched up his face. “I’m OK.”
This was fucking ridiculous. The idea that he’d use his brother in this way…  “I'm not gonna use you as a human shield!”
“Tony? Come on, quit lazing around, Stark. Wake up, come on.”
Tony had the data packet in his hands, he was looking at the spike in radiation levels.
The swordsman didn’t even look at him. “You crawl across this earth like locusts!” With a quick, vicious movement, he stumbled to his feet and drew a sharp circle in the air.
“... I understand,” Tony said. He did. It was the difference between having everyone pressing him into the arc reactor surgery, and him choosing to go under on his own terms. It was the difference between Rhodey taking War Machine, and Tony signing it over to him. (It was the difference between Steve taking Tony’s resources to find Barnes, and…) “I’m sorry too. I'm sorry I didn’t give you the choice.”
He couldn’t say anything to that. There was a lump in his throat, as if his heart had jumped up to lodge there.
“You know that’s not how
The woman’s lip twitched. “Come with me.”
She shook her head. “No, I am fine. Just a headache.” She looked up at Mordo with venom in her eyes. “Is this supposed to be your ‘good side’?” It sounded as though she were quoting something.
Steve peered at Barton with one eye and then immediately hid his face against Tony’s side again, giggling.
Steve hid his face against Tony’s shoulder again and Tony flipped the blanket over his head, tightening his hold. “All set.”
He quirks his very best ‘I’m a bigger asshole than you’ smile. “One billion dollars. Half in advance, half on completion.”
“Look on the bright side,” Wilson said, sounding far too chipper for Tony’s liking as he took his place behind Rhodey and carefully maneuvered the wheelchair out of the door, Tony following awkwardly. “Maybe Steve will turn back to normal and they’ll strangle each other before then.”
Tony references a catch-phrase from the 50s screwball comedy TV series
Tony felt the beginnings of a migraine prickling closer. This was not what he'd been expecting. Help with Barnes, maybe. A discussion about the Accords, possibly. Even - even! - a request for assistance in getting Barton in contact with his family. (He didn't know where they were, he
, he really is, but every time he opens his mouth, it just seems to be to fit another foot in there. (I like to think of him as subscribing to the 'fake it 'til you make it' philosophy of reconciliation.)
Barton looked back at him, bruised and exhausted, something infinitely weary in his eyes. “Yeah. Guess so.” He braced his hands on his knees and forced himself to his feet. “I’ll leave you to get some rest. I’ll let Rhodes know you're out of the woods, and I'll check on you in a bit. You’re officially out of post-op with flying colours, so the medical team will be by in a little while to do their assessment. You should probably sleep a little in the meantime.”
His head hurt. He pressed his hands to his face and sat back down in his chair, trying to marshal his thoughts into something useful. Behind him, he could hear Barton whispering loudly, “see, it’s not just me who has a headache from looking at it,” to an unimpressed Barnes.
“And we saw an
Tony’s grip on the kid’s shoulders tightened. After everything that had happened, after every concern Tony had raised… “You left him with Barnes?”
“I told him he should,” Barton said, butting in with that same wide-eyed, bushy-tailed, well-rested-and-eager-to-get-stuck-in, siryessir look. Romanoff was staring at him with a flat, thin-lipped look and he wilted a little under that stare before visibly perking back up. The fucker even bounced a little on his toes, drawing Tony’s attention away from the silent supersoldier in the textbook
- the temptation to pretend that everything was OK… he had rung that number over a dozen times, whiskey glass in hand, before he’d finally made himself hit
He resolutely put that thought out of his head.
The woman looked surprised. “Yes. Who are you?”
He shook his head again, frustrated, turning away in a motion eerily reminiscent of his adult self.
His head fucking
“- just let us know, OK? We’ll sort it out.”
“Good girl.” Satisfied with the suit’s instructions and general readiness, he headed back to his seat.
“He was screaming his head off for, like, a
, I could swim faster than this!” Tony muttered for the upteenth time.
By the time Tony had staggered to the coordinates - the right boot repulsor entirely dead, and the HUD interface flickering worryingly - Steve had gone limp and unresponsive in his arms. Tony’s vision was starting to prickle, the kaleidoscopic visual disturbances becoming more pronounced.
He shook his head, feeling exhausted. “Wanda…”
He’d laughed at that, short and sharp, the sound turning into a sob.
“.... Steve.” Hesitantly, Tony reached out and gathered the child to him. “I would if I could. You know that, right?”
But given everything that had just happened, and the glow of the aura that signified his concussion’s arrival like a marching band at a funeral - “Right. So you’re
Tony thought. He shook his head. There would be time enough for that later.
(See the end of the chapter for
standards to maintain, and he’d done a fair job of complimenting her on her terrifying attributes, which seemed to both go over well and make her rather amused. (Always charm your hosts, especially if they looked like they could break you in two without breaking a sweat. Tony had always had a thing for frightening capable women, and even though Dhakiya had shown little to no interest, it surely didn’t hurt to be friendly.)
(Ask Tony how much he trusted that back-up, given everything. Go on, ask.)
Tony brought him the LifeStraw - filled from the water tank on the way back - and a couple of packages of the Plumpy’nut. “You hungry? Or thirsty?” Should have probably asked that earlier, but… other priorities.
And still.
Maneuvering back to the pallet, Tony ended up with his back against the wall, Steve curled up in his arms, the blanket wrapped around them both. “FRIDAY, bring the suit here and crank up the heat as much as you can, alright,” he muttered, and the suit obligingly got up and positioned itself beside them, the chest still open. He patted Steve’s back. “I’m really sorry I yelled, Steve,” he tried again. “I was just tired and angry with everything. I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
Not that Tony could talk; he’d failed spectacularly in his own apologies to both Pepper and Rhodey on numerous occasions.
your child.”
That brought Tony to a standstill. He turned on Barton, his expression furious. “In my corner?” he asked incredulously. “Fuck you, Barton, in what way are you ‘in my corner’? When you said all that crap about Rhodey? Or when you dropped everything and went running after Rogers when he crooked his little finger at you? Because from where I’m standing, that’s a long fucking way from being ‘in my corner’.”
He cut off that train of thought more vehemently than he meant to. He couldn’t think about that now. It was easier to think of them as two separate people who couldn't occupy the same space; thinking about the connection between them was too disturbing.
Tony couldn’t imagine it. He hadn’t ever done anything like that himself, of course; if he’d done anything like that, a kidnapping would have been almost guaranteed. He didn’t think that’s where Barton’s story was going, not by the soft expression on his face, creased with warm remembrance, but… “Where was she?” He prompted.
“Barton’ll be there, too,” Tony offered feebly, feeling obscurely like he was back in school and had been dragged to explain himself in front of a disapproving teacher. It wasn’t even his fault! He’d pointed out all the flaws in the plan: the fact that the ‘kill’ order was still out, that Tony himself didn’t trust the guy to prioritise the safety of the child over his old buddy, and - oh yeah - Barnes was still a killing machine with a MacGuyvered off-switch preventing him going on a murderous rampage. “That may be,” T’Challa had answered, serene as a fucking monk. “But my sister was the one to install this ‘off-switch’, and if you trust her enough to consult with her about the child, surely you trust her enough on this.” It had been hard to argue with that logic, although Tony had tried. But the fact of the matter was that he couldn’t be with Steve 24/7, and with Vision out of the picture, that left only three sufficiently lethal options for his babysitter-slash-bodyguard: Barnes, Nat, or Wanda. Out of those, Barnes was far and away the best option; he was strong, he was fast, and he was single-minded. If Tony could trust him to place Steve’s safety before everything else, then… well, it couldn’t hurt. And if the price for that was a couple of photostatic veils and Tony forcing himself to be civil to Bucky fucking Barnes, it was cheap at twice the price.
Steve was still straddling Tony’s hips, his hands on Tony’s chest. Tony’s eyes were wide and fearful, and there was blood, so much blood, Steve’s hands slippery with it as he clamped them down over the wound, trying to staunch the flow.
Steve… was not
She shook her head. “I didn’t lie, Tony. I want the team to be together. Everything else… we’ll work it out.”
Mordo laughed, surprised. “Oh, no, Mr Stark.” He shook his head, wry amusement still clearly visible. “
“He hates everyone,” Tony dismissed this with a wave of his hand. The feeling was very much mutual. He might respect Richard Smith’s business acumen, but the man was Chair of his Finance & Audit Committee (as well as deputy to Tony’s Chairship of the overall Board) and therefore the biggest pain in Tony’s ass since, well, Fury.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Unbunch your panties, Legolas, it was just a question.” He picked up the tablet beside him and tried to concentrate. Vision had sent him a check-in message via FRIDAY almost as soon as they’d been underway to reassure him that Steve had settled down and managed both his breakfast and his medication. Clearly, the management of one small, sickly child was not outside the joint capabilities of Vision and Nat; with both Lang and M’Baku still back at the mountain, there was plenty of back-up for both impromptu attacks and crying jags. They were fine. The kid was fine.
For her part, Romanoff similarly did not seem inclined to start shooting. Or stabbing. Or -
Tony was both 100% done with being manipulated, and strangely inured to it by now.
Rhodey looks back down at the list in front of him. Medical certificate; death certificate; probate; IRS. It is the minutiae of loss, writ large across a world wholly unable to cope.
He needed Rhodey; he loved Rhodey. But Rhodey was his own man, and Rhodey’s first and primary loyalty would always be to the country he served. That was good and right and proper, and Tony would never begrudge Rhodey choosing country over friendship or family, not even once. And yeah, if Rhodey did, if Rhodey were to do that… but Rhodey wouldn’t do that. He’d never do that. Rhodey would absolutely have his back, but Rhodey was a soldier, first and foremost. He put his country first.
T’Challa nodded. “Shuri, Drs Foster and Stark, please continue.”
Barnes flinched, but didn’t look up.
He had nothing else for her, for the well-meaning lies and the machinations and the way she cared so fiercely about people that (he was fairly sure) weren’t quite
- was the oddest feeling. Dhakiya hadn’t thought that Steve was his, and of course all the others knew the situation, and… well, he wasn’t too clear where he himself stood on the matter. So hearing a stranger make a wrong assumption shouldn’t have made that much difference. Anyway, it was a moot point; for all intents and purposes, Steve was his responsibility. Whatever Tony did, he couldn’t escape the fact that he’d taken on a responsibility in signing those papers. He knew that, of course, and it made it a lot simpler that so far his duties had been primarily limited to reading bedtime stories and saving the kid from being shish-kebabed. But until they could turn him back…
“I’ve been busy. My brain was split open, in case you missed that. Grey brain goo everywhere.”
he was in the fucking
“I’ll check in with my contacts once I’m back in the US,” Tony said. “The residual radiation bears some resemblance to an Einstein-Rosen bridge, so Jane Foster may be useful here. I’ll talk to Hill, she has some pull with Dr Foster, she might be able to get her on board.”
, a part of his brain whispered, as if a delay of a few days could build the trust that had never existed between them). And if none of that happened, if things continued in this holding pattern, then… then…
Tony still hadn’t entirely ruled out the entire fucking Accords/Barnes thing not being an intricate plot-within-a-plot of Fury’s design.
Barton had blinked at him, hand half-raised to take a bite out of one of the apples he’d filched from the fruit bowl. “What?”
Steve’s lips formed over and over again, like a prayer.
The flight was uneventful. Good weather, strong headwind... under any other circumstances, Tony would have enjoyed it. As it was, he could feel the strain the suit was under as he urged it to go just that little faster to Rogers's last known coordinates.
Tony was abruptly too tired to have this fight. Not while he was recovering from surgery, inside a fucking
Tony works hard to swallow around the stiffness in his throat. “Whatever helps you sleep at night,” he manages. He braces himself against the worktop and concentrates on staying upright.
“What are you doing?” A small voice asked.
Barnes nodded slowly. “It was my idea,” he said hollowly. He managed a short laugh. “When you fight those committing inhuman acts, you need to… be willing to meet them part-way. And I have experience of that. Of making the hard decisions. With both of you incapacitated, someone needed to say it, to make the hard decisions.” And that someone hadn’t been Barton, presumably.
His brains really must have been scrambled if he was this slow on the uptake. He remembered Maximoff and Barnes from his dreams, sort of - remembered trying to get away from them, anyway - and having a whole bunch of strangers around probably wouldn't have helped. With Rhodey still back at Birnin Zana, that left precious few people his brain wouldn’t count as a threat.
There was someone else in there with him.
Steve ducked down again.
a woman’s voice said.
“If you’re sure,” Rhodey said. “One of the orderlies will come to get you when we’re ready for the debrief, okay?”
Okoye wishes that T'Challa will stop running headlong into danger, but knows that she will never get that wish.
Not when he still felt the echo of Steve’s small, frantic grip on his fingers.
of mileage out of that one.
“Yes, but other than that,” Tony said irritably, folding his arms. “On a scale of one to a bag of Loki’s cats, how crazy is the crazy?”
a small, treacherous part of him thought, before he ruthlessly quashed it down.
The morning had not gone well. Steve had immediately figured out that something bad was going to happen by the presence of Vision and Romanoff, who had turned up a little after 6am armed with age-appropriate toys and a truly impressive array of weaponry.
There were dead kids on the slide behind Barton’s head, for God’s sake. Sure, they’d been de-aged Hydra soldiers, but there were limits even to Tony’s sense of humour, and there was a surfeit of morbidity in the room already. OK,
(There should always be one, Rhodey had told him, after he’d said goodbye to his own mother and shipped off for his first deployment. There should always be at least one person whose priority is not the mission, or the war, or the world, but you. Just you, and your safety, and having you come home at the end of the day. There should always be one person for whom you come first.)
If he was hallucinating Maximoff of all people trying to soothe him…
- had to be for a reason. He was betting that the layout was recognisable to… well, okay, he wasn’t sure who would recognise the layout, because he tried not to socialise with people who dismembered children. But someone would know what the hell had happened at the base.
There was a pause.
Tony thought, clenching his teeth.
He looked down at himself, hesitantly plucking at the hem of the T-shirt he wore. His eyes were drawn to the sneakers with their rampant Iron Man motif, one foot edging over the other in an echo of an earlier time.
It hurt, somehow. There wasn’t enough room in his head for everything, as if his skull had shrunk, or maybe his brain had swelled full of too many thoughts. It certainly felt like he had too much in there, too much presence for a single mind.
Her first loyalty would be to the crown; her first priority would be having T’Challa’s back. Which was fine, except in cases where T’Challa decided to make stupid fucking decisions.
he thought, but did not say. He turned back to the jet, and to the first body lying just inside the door. Wanda - she must have tried to prevent Mordo from leaving the jet, he thought. She looked to be physically unhurt, but he didn’t dare shake her in case she had been injured, and she did not respond to a sharp pinch. Her eyes were closed in sleep, her hair in disarray beneath her as she sprawled on the cold metal floor. Tony confirmed she was still breathing and then moved further inside.
A - shield? something like that, anyway - seemed to sprout from the guy’s fingers, twisting in complicated runes around his wrist, bright and crackling with energy. The repulsor blast hit the flat shield and seemed to dissipate, sputtering out in a shower of sparks across the entire glowing circle.
doctor - said that he should sit down until the feeling went away. That he should suck on lozenges if his mouth was dry. That his body would stop doing this, eventually. That he would adapt.
“I am not interested in your defence,” the man said, and stepped further into the light. Yup, definitely hallucinating. “I am interested in what you are doing here. You, and the others that have moved into the palace. I did not restore T’Challa to the throne to have him abandon it! And for what? A European gap year?”
“Tony?”
and if he could get Pep, Happy and Rhodey to - at least a little - back him on this, no matter how many misgivings they might have...
The door opened and Barton stuck his head in. “We’re ready to head off. The luggage is in the other cars, and your suit is en route. If we’re lucky, it’ll distract anyone trying to tail us.” He pulled back and waved a hand at the open door. Barnes entered - having somehow either disposed of or hidden the worst of his weaponry - and Barton followed, closing the door behind him.
“Barnes,” Tony managed after a moment. Barton’s hand touched his elbow warningly. “Still awake?”
; Christ, this better be one giant plan-within-a-plan or he was gonna put T’Challa’s head on backwards for this double-cross.
There was something else to the conclusions, some
“Jesus, don’t fucking
he thought wryly, and sat down next to M’Baku, affecting not to notice Romanoff sitting down in the free seat next to him. He still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about her, even taking her stated intentions at face value.
a surprise. That Wilson had been read in, and that he'd voiced his opposition.
At the far end of the corridor leading to their suite, a lone attacker was dispatching the last of the four guards that had been assigned to their living quarters. Three were already on the floor, their throats and bellies opened, blood puddling around the bodies. The fourth guard was dangling in the attacker’s grip, making choking sounds.
Tony thought, a millisecond before Steve spotted him and immediately ran over, a bright smile on his face. The child hesitated for a moment, then seemed to take his cue from the kids crowding M’Baku and clambered over Tony to demand his own embrace.
Why hadn’t he realised sooner? No wonder Barnes hadn’t shown any special interest in the kid, he was probably eager to get his buddy back, not some snot-nosed kindergartener. And Tony had thought that - despite everything - Steve might be safe with him, that Barnes might put Steve first…
The main computer was a piece of junk. He’d never been less enthused about being on his back for any piece of teach. “I have calculators more powerful than you, and I am frankly offended to be in the presence of something so ancient,” he informed it, half-wedged inside the console to get a better look. He’d dumped whatever he could of the data core into a portable back-up, and had been trying to figure out what was wrong with the comms system. It looked like some of the wiring was even more lowest-bidder than normal. “My kingdom for a transistor radio,” he muttered, starting to strip the wires.
over, honeybear. Not by a long shot.” He slid gracelessly into the wheelchair and let Wilson clip his IV bag to the stand and stow his undersuit in the little wire basket underneath.
(It was worse.)
“And so the Vision has absented himself from Jabariland.”
Not a bad philosophy, given what little Tony knew about the life Steve would have led during the Depression, and how Steve’s mother had died. She’d have made sure he was independent and able to survive without her as soon as possible. Sure, Steve had promptly turned that into a blanket pass to punch above his weight on more than one battlefield, even before the serum, but Tony couldn’t fault Sarah Rogers’s logic and motivation. “Well, your mom sounds like a smart woman. And look, you’ve done that bow perfectly.” He patted the boy’s foot. “I need you to keep doing what your mom said, OK? We’re gonna look out for you, but we need you to do the same.”
Steve had said, his eyes filling the screen, blue and endless, the wrong (the right?) Steve peering out from behind a veil of tears and pain.
Why they should trust him to do what was necessary.
He slid into the seat opposite her, pasted on his best smile and went straight in for the kill. “Oh, hello. I thought you’d quit. Gone back to shadier pastures. Or does SHIELD’s dental still suck? I thought you guys were all-new, cleans-whiter these days.” Steve was a warm and heavy weight in his arms and as Barton handed him over Tony settled him carefully into his lap. Not that he didn’t trust Hill, of course. But it was always helpful to have his hands free around Fury’s people.
Hearing Steve’s voice again, not angry, not accusing…
That was - unusual. Tony paused for a moment. “Of course. Do you need additional security?”
"How the hell is unclenching supposed to prevent me shitting myself? Seriously, Legolas, your metaphors could do with some work," Tony snapped. He glared at Barton out of the corner of his eye. "Would you be relaxed if it was Cooper? If he was alone, and scared, and you could do nothing about it?"
the eyebrow seemed to say.
“Tony?”
“Inside the armour?” Steve said again, his eyes wide.
That couldn’t have happened. Because if Steve had also been dreaming of this - if he hadn’t just dusted himself off and called it a fair price for walking away with his best friend - then, then -
So now he had to get the packing finished, Steve out of the water before he turned into a prune, and…
guns with him, one of which probably weighed more than the kid. “They’re gonna thicken up the trail and set the bait in the next couple of hours. They’ll come get us when it’s all over.”
“I’m on your payroll, Tony,” she said softly. “You know that.”
Wanda wasn’t messing with his mind, just displaying magical muscle. No, the push was coming from the rest of them, showing just how well they could hold the guy at a knife-edge without tipping either way.
“My best friend is seeing someone and fails to mention it, and I’m not supposed to take it personally?” OK, so making it all about him was probably not the best move, but he was more or less grounded until they dug up a lead, unshrunk Steve and figured out what the bad guy’s next move was. Or who the bad guy was. Or what the fuck they wanted in Ossetia. Or anything at all, really.
By his side blinks his Starkpad, with a message from Rhodey from ten minutes previously.
Steve said, his voice full of grief, and there was really no choice at all.

Barnes flew back a good six feet and thudded into the wall, climbing to his feet to stumble back in the swordsman’s direction.
“No?” He looked up, surprised.
, and his head was throbbing with every beat of his heart. Later, maybe, he’d be able to muster up some righteous indignation, some curiosity about why he wasn't dead, but right now… “There didn’t seem an appropriate moment, and you’ll forgive me if I’m not especially keen to hand out my medical history to people that were trying to kill me not too long ago.” His stomach clenched, bile rising.
to her. There wasn’t a silver bullet to fixing what had gone wrong between them, and he wasn’t sure either of them would take it, even if there had been.
“OK,” Tony amended, scowling. “Maybe he’s a
Despite himself, Tony’s lips quirked up in a smile. Goddamit, he’d
He let Barnes stew in the resulting silence and just tried to keep the kid comfortable. He hadn’t eaten yet - and there was no telling when their trap would be sprung - so he grabbed some of the leftover pancakes from the night before and coaxed Steve into munching on a couple of them, wincing a little as greasy, sticky fingers promptly smeared passion fruit jam all over the suit’s shoulder joint.
Tony’s hand tightened over Rhodey’s. “Rhodey…” He didn’t know what to say.
She shrugged a little. “The restraints are holding. And Wanda’s right there, in case they don’t. I’d say we have a reasonable chance of being able to contain him.”
. And he knew he needed to leave Barton here, as someone Steve was familiar with, so it would be less frightening for him. But if he didn’t take Barton, then who did that leave him with? Romanoff?
“‘Cause that worked
“The Captain went in alone,” Vision said mildly. “And although I do not have magical powers per se, I believe that I may be able to provide some limited shielding from the radiation we have observed.” He looked down at the briefing packet in front of him. At his side, Maximoff shifted closer infinitesimally. “The most logical approach is to split into two teams,” Vision said, thoughtful. “One team to focus on the imminent threat, and the other to work on returning Captain Rogers to his adult state.”
Goddammit, he
On Tony’s other side, Steve managed a small giggle at this and then hid his face against Tony’s chest.

The HUD was damaged. This was bad enough news when he was on the ground. In the air...
Steve blinked up at him, sweaty and miserable. “My chest hurts,” he whimpered, rubbing at his eyes with his fists.
Of course, the Palo Alto campus also included the West Coast R&D labs, which was another draw. It was a solidly equipped and fully-shielded facility; that would be helpful, especially if there was something external triggering Steve’s connection to the portals. For all that Tony wanted to connect with Shuri and Jane Foster on this, that didn’t mean that he was going to just sit around and wait for them to come up with a solution for him. Steve was his responsibility; if the connection to the older Steve was a threat to him, it was on him to figure out how to fix that. (Especially as the focus of the Oakland group was likely to still be on turning Steve back, to the exclusion of everything else.)
with him,” he said slowly, enunciating each word as if speaking to an idiot. “He was frightened and injured and he didn't know who you were. You managed to get both of you to safety without frightening him.”
“You -”
- work together. All they’d have to do, is be able to turn their back and trust that there wouldn’t be a knife in it.
, they would have been able to fix him up, no problem.
looking after frightened kids was really not his forte. At a complete loss, he gathered the child back up on his arms. “I know,” he said gently. “But… you haven’t gone missing, kiddo. You’ve just been made… small.”
Tony had no illusions about M’Baku’s goals in coming to see him.
Rhodey’s smile was razor-thin. “Not just the US. Mental health services are never exactly high up on the list, and the US isn’t the only country that takes a view of a lot of mental health disorders as misconduct. If we’re under the same requirements, then -”
Fuck. “Gimme a minute.”
“You’re not going to tell me that I’m looking at this all wrong, that I need to look at the bigger picture?” Tony didn’t look up from the open faceplate and exposed HUD.
(See the end of the chapter for
change anything. (Something seemed to go cold in him at that.) Was he supposed to be sympathetic that Rogers bruised his goddamned knuckles when he slammed his fist into Tony’s chest? Is that how this was supposed to work? He was supposed to have

But Steve would not be placated, would not be distracted.
he thought, exasperated and edging into exhausted.
“Good.” Tony exhaled in relief. “That’s… that’s good.” He patted Steve gently, then got back to his feet. “Vis,” he said quietly, turning away so that he could murmur in Vision’s ear, “he gets frightened easily, and he hasn’t been sleeping well. Don’t leave him on his own, OK?”
On cue, FRIDAY burst to life in his ear. The connection must have flickered as he’d explored, and he hadn’t noticed it going offline. “- the suit. Boss, Steve Rogers has left the suit. Boss, Steve Rogers -”
He thought about fighting him on this, but… “I - yeah. I mean, I’m not so hot on the plan, let’s put it that way, but there’s not a whole lot of choice, so…”
“Yeah, fuck you, we’re not doing this now.” Barton grabbed Tony’s elbow, fingers pressing in on the nerves with unerring accuracy. Tony winced as he was dragged to Barton’s side, their walk through the hospital resuming with only the minimum amount of notice from the other patients they passed. “You wanna have this out, we do this later,” Barton said under his breath. “We get this all sorted and stop the fucker who’s killing those kids and sure, we’ll go down to the gym after it’s all put to bed and beat the living crap out of each other. But until we do that, until this is sorted,
After a moment, Steve let go of his death-grip on Tony’s T-shirt and reached down to rest his hand on the page, his fingers against Tony’s. His breathing evened out.
Romanoff met his gaze and nodded slightly.
Barton’s eyes tracked the movement. His hand half-rose, the fingers twitching, as if he’d almost reached out then thought better of it. “Just sit tight,” he said instead. “We’ll figure it out.”
“It’s just to keep you warm, okay? You need to trust me on this, we don’t want your toes falling off or anything. I don’t think I’d be able to explain turning up with you missing any digits.” He eyed the discarded uniform pants. He could probably tie them off at the knees or something, and clip them around the kid to keep them on. They’d help to preserve the heat a little, and would also give him something in the way of footwear (the boots were, of course, far too big to be of any use). But he needed to warm him up first, or there would be no temperature to preserve.
So he’d gone to Wilson, who’d…
one as well, and Tony’s day would be complete.
And his omnipresent surveillance of all threats, which extended to anyone presumably not in his immediate family. (And even that was suspect; Tony wasn’t entirely sure what his relationship with T’Challa was, but it was certainly… complicated.)
He did not dare look to his side, where Romanoff was carefully looking down at her hands, her expression fixed.
Tony tried to keep his voice gentle. “He’s not gonna hurt you, kiddo. There’s a lot of us here, and
The first order of priority was opening up an emergency exit, and that meant flight, and the unibeam. The unibeam hadn’t taken any damage during the fight, so all he had to do was re-align the matrix inside the HUD, which was a five minute job. The damage to the right boot repulsor, however, was much more complicated. It hadn’t just been knocked out of alignment; the delicate filaments inside acting as the boot’s ‘nerves’ - the things that allowed Tony to adjust the boot’s position automatically inside the suit to maintain balance - had been brought too close to the repulsor and had been damaged. Strpping those back and replacing them was a fiddly, painstaking job and he was cursing his sore eyes and back by the time he finished a couple of hours later.
“... what?” Tony asked finally.
She hesitated. “That is currently beyond our abilities.”
It was a terrifying thought.
Steve chewed his lower lip, staring at his scraped knees. “No,” he admitted finally, his voice miserable. He was silent for a long moment. “I just didn’t want to be on my own.” When he looked up, his eyes were glassy and wet. “I got scared.”
and so he had the warfarin. It was just preventative, it was fine, it was like a vitamin, really; it didn’t mean
“Perhaps we should clarify. We have come into contact with an associate of yours, and he has advised us to contact you.”
RE: Rhodey... let's not kid around, if he was receiving treatment for mental health issues such as depression or PTSD, no one would clear him to be flying around a suit of armour with missiles all over it. The fact that Tony could do that as a civilian is another interesting perk of the US position on weapons control (but that's an argument for another day).
“That! The - the overcompensating.” Rhodey’s mouth was a thin line. He turned away abruptly. “Look, I need to get down to the physio anyway, why don’t you walk with me. We can talk on the way. I was… there was something I wanted to talk to you about, anyway.”
“An associate of mine,” Master Minoru prompted gently.
“Ask me again in a bit.” The prelim work he’d seen back in Birnin Zana wasn’t a patch on this. Tony frowned, skipping back to the earlier notes to compare. The radiation in Steve was stronger than the other kids, coming in well over the safe dosage, but it didn’t seem to have injured him any. Did it have something to do with the de-aging? Or was it all a side-effect of something else? And -
You know when you have a plan that you'll sit down and have some 'me' time to write and write and write? And then RL happens. Well, RL has been kicking my arse and I'm just relieved I managed to get some words down at this point tbh.
else, helpless, with that sword-wielding maniac hunting him down… It didn’t matter if Steve wasn’t
“Whereas we’re all set,” Tony cut in. “Your majesty, not to put too fine a point on things, but we had two team members who knew their way around a glowy object. One’s on another planet right now, and the other can’t leave your borders. That doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence as to our ability to handle this - as Cap’s current state proves.”
There was no doubt at all in Tony’s mind who the blonde woman was.
Steve nodded silently, pressing back into the back plating.
Dr Foster and the princess would be checking in daily, which meant - he looked at his watch - sometime in the next twelve to eighteen hours, probably, assuming they did them the courtesy of taking the time difference into account. And assuming that there wasn’t anything they discovered in the meantime that needed to be shared more quickly, of course.
, in his chest…
He hadn’t been sleeping properly - it was all either too much or too little - and he’d been clinging to Tony since Ossetia. His play had been too quiet, too fragile. His appetite had been gone, and he’d been listless for days.
Tony looked across at him, startled.
With one last look at the bed, he fell into step with Barton as they left the room. Barton gave him the side-eye in silence for a moment; then, “you alright there? Get much sleep?”
Tony thought, watching Barnes’s pain with a sort of clinical interest.
Tony said, helpless. He wasn’t sure which of them he was addressing, but all three looked at him with those same blue eyes.
Barton shrugged, his eyes on the viewscreen. For all his advice that Tony should relax, he didn’t look especially laid-back himself. His jaw was clenched, and the skin was tight around his eyes.
“Because you were so close and friendly before.”
Tony looked back to see Steve peeping over the raised arm of the suit, his eyes wide. “I’m making a warm place. We’re going to have to wait for our lift back, and it will take a little while. So I’m just… making a warm place.”
More silence. Helplessly, Tony looked up at Romanoff and Vision, standing in the bedroom hallway. “He - he needs a bedtime story,” he said, stumbling over his words in his haste to get them out. “And he - he needs -” He couldn’t think. The armour was assembled, the team was waiting for him by the jet, he just needed to -
He watched as Steve thought it over carefully. “Am I… does this mean that I get to go back to school?”
works either, right? The doctor decides. Not whoever is closest.”
meant someone would observe Tony doing every single a human could be reasonably expected to do - three times - and would give him a pass/fail for complex tasks such as tying his shoelaces and spelling
He hadn’t had one that bad for a while. He’d had disturbed dreams, sure - the week or so immediately after Siberia hadn’t exactly been a cakewalk - but he’d thought he was getting better, dammit. He’d thought…
“I was lucid,” Tony agreed. “Well, OK, partly. But enough to know that someone was there.” He looked away for a moment. “You know that wasn’t OK, right? For either one of you to do. Not after everything.”
him. But the boy had seemed happy enough with the art supplies, and so, and so…
“Let’s talk about it once we get you back to safety, okay?” He said, deciding that discretion was the better part of valour. Steve stared up at him, his face tear-streaked and displaying his emotions for all the world to see.
“Yes?”
- that Rhodey must have blamed him, to want to move to DC so suddenly...
had been the one to make the decision.
Tony thought, chagrined, thinking back to some of his less than sterling past decisions and the fall-out that Pepper had managed on his - and S.I.’s - behalf.
It wasn’t the portal of his nightmares, no. There wasn’t an alien army waiting on the other side as the swordsman threw Maximoff a hateful look and stepped through.
It was the first time he’d said it.
He settled down with the coffee and the data packets - including, interestingly, some background briefing notes on Einstein-Rosen bridges from Jane Foster, who evidently either worked faster than anyone Tony had ever seen, or was preparing for some sit-up-and-take-notice postdoctoral work - and wrapped one of the decorative throws around his shoulders for warmth. Wakanda may have technically been an equatorial country, but Birnin Zana had quite a bit of elevation to it and the evenings were cooler than he’d like.
She nodded disjointedly and wiped away the last of her tears. “I do not delude myself that this makes anything better. But I wanted to say it. I wanted it to have been said. I spoke to Vision about - about what I did, how I hurt him. We... we talked.” She reached for her cup and drank it shakily, her posture still that of the chastised little girl.
"Vision," he said abruptly. "I'll check in with T'Challa before going in, and I'll keep in contact with you throughout, FRI. I drop out of contact for more than four hours, you contact Vis and tell him where I am. You do
you told Ross those scant days ago, and you know what you have to do. If Tony is alive - alone and stranded, dying by inches, waiting for you to do the impossible -
Tony’s eyes flickered up to the main viewscreen. The swordsman was… “Huh.” He was
Wanda broke in before T’Challa could answer, her hand still on Tony’s arm. “Tony,” she said again, quiet and sure. “Tony, please. I would not let any harm come to Steve. Believe me on this.”
Tony looked away. “I told you, I wanted to check on Rhodey -”
They were just as likely to materialise.
“An hour or so.”
Tony left the suit in the main room and padded to Steve’s bedroom in his socked feet, closing the door gently.
“What would be?” She waited a moment, then plunged on. “There’s nothing I can say that will make you trust me on this. Not when it comes to -“ She waved a hand vaguely to where Barton had exited, Steve in his arms.
he’d said when offered the chance to run about. And he’d held on to Tony as if afraid that he, too, would disappear.
He’d need to think on the options a little more, of course. The charges against the team were varied and numerous, and they covered several jurisdictions. Ross was only one problem, albeit a significant one. The ideal solution was of course for Ross to not know about Steve at all, which would be easiest if they stayed on SI land. Pepper had confirmed that they’d be set up in the Palo Alto area - SI held significant land there, covering both industrial and residential areas - which would mean they could get to Oakland easily enough when they needed to. Plus, it would be a decent cover; what could be more natural than Tony spending time in the office?
He had no fucking idea what to do with something like that. “What?” He asked again, helplessly. “I don’t understand.
And judging by just how far ahead this someone was - and how elegant some of their ideas were - he was starting to get an inkling of just who might have read in Dr Foster on their little problem. “T’Challa send one of his own to bring her in? You know, if whoever wrote this is willing to travel, I’d be more than willing to work with them in New York. They don’t need to be stuck out in the wilds of New Mexico.”
Relief was melting across Barnes’s face at this. “Yeah. Yeah, you did. It was my birthday, and you won me a prize. A…” Frustration, again, creasing his face into a scowl.
He had his hands full of the mini version right now; he really didn’t need to hear all about how the adult Steve was just so disappointed that Tony couldn’t get over his little hang-ups about,
He’d fix it somehow, he thought desperately. Not this whole clusterfuck - maybe that was beyond his reach - but he could fix
But it was.
He looked exhausted, Tony realised, like he hadn’t slept at all since Tony had last seen him, despite the pillow-creases still on his face. And he hadn’t looked that hot back in Birnin Zana, either. Rhodey had said he hadn’t taken things especially well, that he hadn’t been sleeping, but… “Wilson? I know we’re not exactly bosom chums, here, but… everything OK?”
not mine, OK, he just, he -”
have him -
“How’s Steve?” Tony asked, not looking away from Mordo.
“Your concern for the well-being of your fellow man is truly an inspiration to us all.” Disgruntled, Barton added cream to his coffee and then put it out of Tony’s reach.
he’d pressed a small hand to his chest,
Oh, he would have moved mountains if he’d had to.
The kid jumped at the sound, almost toppling out of the suit with fright. “It’s alive!”
And honestly, I think that Tony would adore her. He loves kids being smart and capable, he wants the best for them. He may often screw up, but his heart is in the right place.
Tony carefully moved the winter coat to the dresser and sat down in the chair beside the bed, watching the child sleep.
“No.” Rhodey shook his head. “Everything went like clockwork. The battle for Tikrit was… well, it’s rare enough to see anyone pleased to see you when you turn up wearing a US uniform overseas. To have so many so relieved…”
He thought, desperately.
“Bet you never thought you’d be anyone’s bogeyman,” Tony whispered into the soft hair. Steve didn’t seem inclined to answer, snuffling in his sleep and burrowing closed. Tony snorted. “Yeah, you never listened to me then, why am I even surprised.” Moving carefully, he extracted himself from beneath the kid and settled him back under the covers.
Steve hesitated another couple of moments, then shyly let go of Tony and extended his hand to shake.
The swordsman did not appear to be the least bit impressed by the intimidation tactic. “I am waiting,” he said amiably, “but my patience is not infinite.” He was sans sword, at least, but otherwise he looked the same as when he had attacked the palace, Tony noticed. However they had captured a guy, he didn’t have a fucking scratch on him.
HEAT training is Hostile Environment Awareness Training; it's generally used by NGOs but I'd imagine that Tony would have had something similar prior to being allowed to go to any war zones by his SI Board of Directors. The minefield directive is absolutely true - you stay put, you call for help, and you let the experts get you out. If someone is shooting at you, then, and only then, should you risk moving.
He was frightened of her, Tony realised with a jolt. Whoever she was, she was strong, and Mordo was no longer as assured of her goodwill as he had been a few moments ago.
“All you big shots keep turning up here and swooning at my feet, it’ll start to give me ideas,” the guy said, sounding very far away. “What’s the child’s name, mzungu?”
That all being said, although Tony had kept up with his emails - barely - when out in Wakanda, handling the Chair of the FAC was not something that could be done remotely. Especially not when he was overstepping his bounds and meddling in things that were very clearly not his bailiwick. “Smith needs to back off out of Pepper’s - and my - remit. It’s not any of his business how we implement operational decisions.” He’d need to have a short, sharp conversation with him about that.
He wasn’t
Although, if this was what she did to people she liked, maybe Tony was lucky to not be in her good graces.
But he couldn’t accept what ‘fixing it’ could mean for Steve. Not for
“No,” Barnes said, and Tony’s mouth closed with a sharp ‘click’. “He didn’t mention it to me. I went into cryo very soon after everyone arrived here. But - even before that, before he went to the Raft, I could see he was thinking about something. I knew that he was… he needed to leave, there was something he needed to do.” He glanced at Tony, something wry about his mouth. “Actually, I thought he was gonna go find you. Talk it out, you know. All that jazz.”
“He already had this fight with Steve,” Barton interrupted, folding his arms. He looked away and sighed, raising a hand to rub the back of his neck tiredly. “Look. It’s not my place. But… Barnes went back into cryo a couple of days after we arrived in Wakanda, before the rest of us left. Steve said…” His throat worked. He glanced at the child sprawled in Tony’s lap. “He said he’d said something to make him choose that. Had driven him away. Had… expected him to be his friend from childhood, and not respected the changes done to him, the life he’d lived.” Barton’s jaw was clenched. “He said Barnes had chosen to go under in part because he needed to not be in the same place as him.”
“OK, so, first off, congrats on not being dead, must be good to, you know, have the paperwork for that.”
Tony looked away.
Tony stared. “It’s green.”
He’d probably meant it to be reassuring. But suddenly all Tony could think about was Rhodey’s face when he’d found out Tony had lied to him about the palladium poisoning; Rhodey’s face when Tony had OD’d the first, second and third time; Rhodey’s face after he’d fallen and Tony hadn’t saved him, after he’d fallen and it had been
(When he looks down, he can see his chest gaping open, the shield slicing him clean in two. Steve is watching him softly, gently, and then leaning down to press his lips to Tony’s once more.)
“Ah. Yes. I am afraid that those best placed to do so…” Mordo tilted his head, pursing his lips. “Well, we did not part on the best of terms. We disagreed on some fundamentals.”
Coming up next: Steve gets out of the PICU! Tony realises just what he's let himself in for! And we find out a little more about what's actually going on...
Barton scowled. “I'd forgotten how much of a dick you can be,” he muttered, then pushed his way into Tony’s space alarmingly fast, crowding Tony back against the wall. His eyes tracked the way that Tony’s body twisted instinctively at the motion, pulling Steve away and putting Tony’s unprotected back between him and Barton. Something flickered across Barton’s face at that, and his expression softened. “You were
Barton looked grim. “We have something.”
Steve’s eyes were the same, Tony thought. That same clear blue gaze, taking in everything that Tony was and could be, and finding him somehow wanting.
Barton was watching him carefully, his brows drawn together in a frown. “Tony? You OK?” He got the penlight out again, shining it in Tony’s eyes.
Steve looked conflicted, but finally nodded. “OK.” He bit his lip. Framed by the tight straps of the mask, his eyes looked swollen and scared. “You’ll stay until then, right?”
though. Clearly, they’d both been wrong, at least to some extent. That Tony might have had his head up his ass was not a new thought to him; likewise, the thought that Captain Perfect might have had the same. But both, at the same time, on the same point? That was more of a stretch. And yet... He looked at Barton, thinking hard. After Romanoff had absconded with the tattered remains of Tony’s dignity, who would have maintained contact between the two camps?
“What,” Tony asked slowly, dread rising, “is it that you remember, exactly?”
Notes:
It wasn’t as if the bastard cared one way or the other; this was just him trying to get under Tony’s skin. And, really, Tony was getting spectacularly fed up of everyone praising him to kingdom come like he was a pre-schooler in need of soothing, especially since the prevailing attitude to reading him in on the plans left him at roughly the same level. “And you’re spectacularly shit with him,” he bit out. “It must be a gift. I thought your past self was supposed to have raised a passel of kids, what with all the siblings and cousins; didn’t any of that stick?” He raised a hand to his head to press against the source of the headache. “And quit sneaking up on me, I have a heart condition, asshole. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?”
Yes, that was
kept in touch. And yet you bring strangers here, to the Sanctum. Strangers who fear you, who put chains on you. Now why would that be?” The strange glowing tendrils that Mordo had used to form his shields also seemed to be Minoru’s chosen weapon, twisting out from her outstretched hand, around Mordo’s chest. “What did you do, my dear, to make these people so frightened?”
it was. Without oversight, all he had to rely on was his own judgement, and he knew what lay down that road. And Tony’s oversight figured people like Pepper, like Rhodey, like T’Challa - capable, thoughtful people, people used to wielding power for the greater good, who would think long and hard about whether something was acceptable or not. Ethical, moral people who could be trusted to make those choices.
“I disagree. I needed to be sure.” Minoru looked at Okoye. “Do you still wish for me to vouch for him?”
Comments are love.
I really like Shuri, I think she's amazing. Having her in danger during BP probably scared T'Challa witless, because he wasn't used to seeing his baby sister in danger. And I think part of the reason why she's sent to the US with Nakia is to give her that controlled entry into the world - she gets to see a bit of the world, with someone immensely capable watching over her. And although she's a genius in every sense of the word, that doesn't mean that working in isolation is good for her, or for anyone, really. So I figured connecting her with Jane Foster might be nice.
“Is he awake?”
Tony had tried to explain, to reassure.
Steve nodded, still looking pretty miserable.
It would have been a magnificent speech, sharp and cutting and just on the right side of morally extortionate. It would have been sung of in song and, and, other things you sing, OK, the point is, it was a thing of beauty and it was a bit of a shame that his knees had decided that, nope, they weren't cooperating.
, how did they zero in on him so precisely?”
"Boss, I strongly advise against this."
the child said, Captain America said, and Steve said,
(The Steve in his dreams looked up at him with accusing eyes.
“Yeah, well.” He regarded her with frank curiosity. “You know I won’t let you have him. I don’t care how many hallelujahs Nick can muster up. He’s not gonna lay a finger on him.”
Tony paused, looking at him thoughtfully.
He’d shrugged, slumping back into his normal posture and speaking voice.
FRIDAY said in his ear;
There was no ‘probably’ about it. This version of Steve was equal parts small and unconscious, both of which were vast improvements over large and murderous, in Tony’s opinion. It was infinitely easier to spend his time here, watching over a child safely in the care of the best doctors in the world, than to face the people he had once called friends.
“You know, in some parts of the world, you rescuing me means we’re married now,” Tony’s mouth said without any input from his brain.
“I’ll help,” you say after a moment. “I’ll - I’ll fill in what I can for Sam, and then I’ll help.”
Apologies if my Russian is off a little bit; please do correct me if so.
Rhodey eased himself back down for a minute, then back up again. “Yeah, that’s… thanks, that’s better.” He sounded surprised. (He still hadn’t turned to face Tony.)
“Boss?”
A part of him thought, but,
“Two days? You have got to be joking!”
he does
Yeah, I went down the Pep/Happy route. (Only way I could square this away with Homecoming, really.)  Hap's benignly tolerant of the strays that Tony collects, but that doesn't mean he thinks it's a good idea for Tony to become so invested in other people's kids. Or vice versa, to be honest. And this scenario? Yeah, even worse.
“I’m hardly kidnapping him,” he’d snapped at Barton when he’d wandered in to check on their progress.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hypothermia?”
They might be able to save Steve.
“Yes, sir,” came back the drowsy reply.
T’Challa smiled thinly. “Sent them to me? Yes, that much I had gathered. But there were some disagreements between the Captain and the others around the best way to approach things. To approach - reconciliation.”
(“He’s doing well,” the doctor had said, adjusting Steve’s IV catheter. “He’s responding to the medication, and all the sleep he’s enjoying is helping his recovery. You have nothing to worry about.”
The child startled awake, then blinked sleepily up at him. He seemed almost happy for a moment, then caught sight of Tony’s armour and sat up. “What’s wrong?”
He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Two kids - Hap, seriously. The first kid isn’t even mine, he just sort of… latched on. And kid number two is
They reached the clinic reception area. Tony could see Wilson waiting patiently inside, a paperback open in his clasped hands. He hesitated. “I’m really glad he was there for you, Rhodey,” he said finally. “Even if he
There was an odd look in Barton’s eyes. “You asked for a lift, not for back-up. Vision and Rhodes are waiting for us at Birnin Zana. Sam and Scott should get there by the time we arrive as well.”
Romanoff took the spot at the front of the room once everyone was seated.
The scary woman - General Okoye - surveyed them all with the air of someone who had taken their measure in the first few minutes of their acquaintance, and had found them all sadly lacking. “Charmed, I’m sure,” Tony’s mouth said without any input from his brain.
“I will not harm the child,” he said, the moment Tony walked back in the room, Romanoff at his side.
Left alone with the exhausted, sleeping Steve passed out in his arms, Tony stared down at the small face cushioned against his chest.
He leans forward and rests his forehead on his hands.
“No.” Mordo looked back at him steadily. “What has been done to her - and what she herself does now - is an abomination. And I am not overly fond of monsters.”
“Suit’s fine, I’m fine, it’s all fine. Listen,” he looked back at the almost-asleep Steve cuddled up inside the suit and grimaced. “I’ve found who I was looking for, and he’s not in the best of state. I think I need to get him back to his friends, but we can’t travel in the suit. I may need a hand. Are you able to arrange it?”
It took Pepper a moment to get it. “Are you
“Not if we keep him out of sight,” she agreed easily. “I assume T’Challa can provide him with papers?”
Wilson gave him a brittle look. “I don’t think that anyone was deluding themselves on that point,” he said. He looked at the still form on the bed, frowning uneasily. “Barnes was never really the issue here.”
Vision, off-screen, but rapidly approaching to kneel beside the child.
He turned back to the child, kneeling in front of him. “I’ll be back soon. Two days at most.”
He slid the pebble into the pocket of his slacks.
“Yeah, but they probably thought you’d have someone spotting your form or something.” Tony sat down behind him, his legs spread wide on either side of Rhodey’s Buddha position. He eased Rhodey up then carefully adjusted Rhodey’s hips so that he was sitting evenly and his back was straight. “OK, try it now.”
It was incredibly tempting to chalk the whole thing up as an elaborate ruse by Romanoff.
“Coulda woulda shoulda,” Barton muttered, and elbowed Tony out of the way. “Go back and sit with Steve until we’re ready to disembark. Barnes and I have to go put our faces on.”
“No.” That pinched expression was back on Barton’s face.
Hill relaxed infinitesimally at this. “Pepper will forgive you eventually. The FAC Chair probably won’t, though.”
RL is stomping on my head with big giant boots and this chapter did not want to cooperate at all. Sigh.
Although, come to think of it, a human who was willing to do what he’d seen in that room was probably no saner.
“Yes.”
Mordo would 100% prefer any version of the plan to involve him being in charge, and not being leaned on by Wanda. Them's the breaks, Mordo, maybe don't go after Steve's head and everyone would play nicer.
Steves’ best interest.
Maybe this wasn’t a hopeless case after all.
Tony had said, had promised, had shouted, in the days after.
Tony was silent for a long time. “He’s
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, all right. Mordo hadn’t said, and they hadn’t clocked that ‘Master’ was a gender neutral title, fine.
“Probably the intention.” No one thought twice about a shop-front; put flashing neon signs on it and people tended to glaze over, their tired eyes skipping to the street crossing lights or the glare of the car headlights or the glow of their smartphones. (You could find Stark Tower by looking
Not for the first time, Tony felt a pang of unease. It was one thing to deal with a hysterical child in the base, or even at the hospital. But here…
Of course Barnes knew Russian.
Minoru nodded. “Then consider him vouched for. I know of this threat, and we have been considering our response to it. We shall need to coordinate on this, once we have our method of entry.”
Tony stared at the inert pebble for a moment, feeling inexplicably better. Rhodey had someone with him, someone who was watching out for him. He was safe, and if all the stars were aligned and Wakandan tech was as shiny as the previews had indicated, maybe he’d be a little further on that road to recovery. All Tony could do was hope, at this point; until the spinal shock finished doing its thing, everything was still up for grabs.
That was Steve’s voice, all right, but there was something wrong. There was an odd, deep timbre to it, as if an older man was trying to speak through a child’s voicebox.
(The darkness claimed him again. He did not fight it.)
The kid crawled out from under the metal cautiously, drawing himself up as tall and as brave as he possibly could. He had one of Rogers's smaller knives in his grip, held tremulously with both hands in front of him like a sword. "Who - who are you?"
Barnes, for his part, seemed more concerned with checking on Tony, for some strange reason. “Stark. Are you injured?” He asked, almost brusque, his gaze flickering over the exposed parts of Tony. He did not reach out or touch Tony, but he was standing too close. “Is Steve?”
“Well, it’s like this. Your older self - he’s been through some really scary stuff. And he used to be a soldier, you know, and fight the bad guys. So some of the stuff he had to do… well, that can be scary as well, especially if you’re not a soldier. I know he didn’t mean to scare you, and I know he’d want you to tell me if you were ever scared again.”
“Tones, lemme stop you there. There is nothing you can do to stop me from telling you when you’ve screwed up.” Rhodey’s smile grew lopsided. “I’m not gonna lie. I think you’re leaving yourself open for a world of hurt. But you already know that.”
That said, for all that going to Hong Kong held a certain appeal - he was sick and tired of being coddled - he wasn’t sure about the logistics of it. Could he bring Steve with him safely, if Mordo turned out to be planning a double-cross? Not that he could leave the child unattended - for pretty much the same reason - but maybe with Vision -
“Mr Stark is of course happy to cooperate with any initiative authorised by the UN Accords Committee,” Hill said in a perfectly blank corporate register. “He’ll be delighted to discuss what form that authorisation might take during this transition period at a time convenient to the Secretary. However, the Secretary must be aware that Mr Stark is currently out of the country on personal business and unfortunately that personal business will likely keep him occupied for the foreseeable future upon his return. Mr Stark reminds the Secretary that the Avengers Initiative is temporarily on hold until such time as the legal questions raised by the Secretary’s timely intervention have been addressed and, moreover, there is no major threat currently identified which would warrant overriding of such suspension.” She leaned back in her seat, folding her arms. “This isn’t my first rodeo, Tony. And Ross isn’t the first jackass I’ve had to stonewall. If he pushes, we’ll shove the information assets into escrow and cover it with lawsuits from a dozen different shell companies.”
He couldn’t listen to these recordings. It was too much, after all - he’d found his limits without even trying. His own dreams were bad enough; he didn’t need Steve’s nightmares on top of them.
Her eyes were dark. “Well, it is in my DNA, as you say.” Her voice and face were perfectly expressionless, like computer recordings.
Steve shook his head, holding tightly onto Tony’s T-shirt. “No, no, no -”
He was asleep before he finished the thought.
Barnes stirred. “We knew we could not keep him safe any other way. We would have to control the nature of the confrontation.” His face was expressionless, giving nothing away.
And there was no way to portal in, of course, not unless the swordsman wanted to risk entering solid rock. So he’d have to fight his way in, following the trail laid out so plainly it was practically glowing in the dark.
Barton’s mouth was a thin line. He looked exhausted, the black eye from before in full bloom. (How long had Tony been out, for it to have developed like that, all mottled purples and blues?) He leaned forward and fussed with Tony’s pillow, then thumbed the pebble on the nearby table again until it flashed. “Yup. You remembered. Well, OK, you’re all caught up.” He looked like he wanted to say something else but he looked away instead, eyes red-rimmed, rubbing a hand across the stubble on his face. “You got knocked on the head, got concussed. Would have been OK, but -”
he’d said, when Barton had stopped by to drop off some toiletries and a copy of all the footage and data they had; Barton had been less than amused - but looking after and
“You have a concussion, there were some complications,” the voice said again patiently. “Hopefully all mended now. Do you remember where you are?”
Tony turned Rhodey’s hand over, so they were clasped. “Then that’s what matters.” The rest of it could wait.
“Boss.”
A jerky nod. “Yeah.”
“Yes,” Minoru said, her voice honeyed. “Yes, we did, against Kaecilius. With whom we also trained together, and fought together. It seems you cannot trust anyone, these days.”
Tony looked down at the pebble he held in his hands. He’d carried it with him from Birnin Zana, he’d had it with him during his convalescence.
Steve finally looked up. His mouth was thin and pinched, and his eyes were wet. “D’you promise?” He whispered. “If - if I get lost, you’ll come find me?” He looked back down, his entire frame trembling. “Only… only… only my mom said, she said…”
“I have your briefing for you. Do you want it now or after you arrive?” Hill sounded very much like she’d prefer option number two. She was looking at Tony front and centre and up, her gaze determinedly a few inches above the top of Steve’s head.
Steve was still watching him wearily, swaying a little.
“Hong Kong?” Tony asked sharply. “Not New York?”
he thought, kneeling by the small body.
Yes, Tony, you did just agree to spend time with your two least-favourite people in the world, in order to help out someone you have very mixed feelings for. Congratulations on failing to think before speaking.
Next to her, practically bouncing up and down in her excitement, Princess Shuri cut in. “No, we can’t call back later, he might be unconscious again!” At Tony’s exaggeratedly offended look, she shrugged. “Well, you do get hit on the head a lot. I keep trying to make contact, and you keep being unavailable, it is very inconvenient. Maybe you should reinforce the suit in that area?” She turned to T’Challa, smirking on Tony’s right. “Brother, I shall send you the designs for a helmet for him.”
Tony thought, his heart clenching. He wanted Rhodey, he wanted to someone he could
He also needed to get a line open to FRIDAY. Not that the pebble wasn’t a marvel (he really should get Shuri’s permission to take it apart once this was all over, that, or bribe her with whatever teenaged girls with genius-level intellects wanted - tickets to a Beyoncé concert, her favourite YouTuber’s phone number, access to the recovered Chitauri weaponry components - to go over the schematics with her) but Tony… well. He always felt more secure when he built something himself.
. "Where is he?"
“I do,” Tony confirmed. He shrugged. “But, you know how it is…” All the other choices were somehow
“Just like old times,” Nat said into Tony’s ear, low and intimate. Her hand closed around his wrist, fingers surreptitiously pressed into the pulse point. “You OK?”
“I figure, as long as we’re being upfront about the stabbing, we can probably do it in the chest and not the back.” He met her eyes, making his expression as blank as possible.
Tony continued reading. “Arthur grew up far away from the palace…”
Pepper took her hand away; the better to scowl at him, Tony thought. “Well, gosh, Tony, I’m always glad you haven’t managed to get yourself killed - though not for lack of trying on your part I assume - and I’ll of course help you, but have you lost your goddamned mind?” She dropped out of the mocking tone, her mouth twitching as she visibly willed the frown away. “I’m serious. This is such a bad idea.”
Barton shrugged and took Steve, Barnes at his shoulder. They closed the door on the limo and went up to the house, doubtless to check whether any Hydra assassins - or worse, paparazzi - were hiding in the crockery.
The teacher in the centre of the room - hands outstretched, a glowing golden shield like the one Mordo had used solid around his wrists - stopped mid-move and turned to look at them. The entire class followed, all two dozen trainees, some in street clothes, others in the same sort of Robin Hood-slash-Way of the Warrior outfits Mordo favoured.
There was a short pause. “He is… distressed. Natasha is with him.”
“Human is good?” Tony asked, a little doubtful, and took hold of Steve’s hand, falling into step beside her.
“To all of it," Wilson cut in, undeterred. "To any of it. OK? You’re allowed to say no. The two of you - look, you may be able to resolve this, or maybe not. But he’s in no condition to discuss any of it with you, and you’re under no obligation to stick with him when you haven’t had your say. It’s probably not doing either of you any favours, to be honest. And I don’t think that ‘no’ is in either Nat’s or Barton’s vocabulary, given their backgrounds, so… I’m saying it.”
But Shuri was shaking her head. “I don’t think so, it’s not a permanent link. I think the link is reactivating when the portals re-activate.”
Did he want to do this with the two people who (for whatever well-meaning reasons they may have had) had done more to manipulate him over the last few weeks than anyone had done since… well, it had been a while. Maybe even as much as a year.
He sat down heavily on the bed, his legs giving out beneath him.
There really wasn’t a choice at all.
Barton looked at him carefully. “She did. There a problem?”
Tony snorted, lengthening his stride. “I slept like a baby, Legolas. And the hospital has a lovely view. And the food is delicious. And I’m getting plenty of fibre. Anything else?”
Tony mouthed at Barton, who shrugged. Despite Barton’s earlier declaration that the whole team had magically reassembled for God, Justice and the American Way, he had trouble believing it. Well, no, not when the American Way was currently sprawled in a feverish sleep on Tony’s shoulder, his breathing patchy and laboured. But the rest of it? That everyone else would be able to set aside what had happened so easily, when Tony had been unable to do so, and Rogers had only gone so far as to write him a
“We are… associates of Master Minoru. May we speak with him?”
Barnes snorted, then suddenly looked panicked.
, Tony had a duty to stand by him either way.
It was maybe doable.
The suit’s face-plate slammed down as Tony jumped to his feet.
He’d made good progress on the results and implications around residual trace radiation after a portal connection when there was a faint sound from outside - from the corridor - that made him pause, pen in hand. He frowned. It hadn’t sounded like fighting, precisely, but there was something strange about -
