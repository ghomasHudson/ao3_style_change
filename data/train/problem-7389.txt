“Let him in, J. I’ll go get him,” Tony tells the A.I. then he turns to Steve. “Have a seat. I’ll be back.”
“How did you forget? I mean I don’t care...not really. It’s a stupid holiday anyway.” Steve tries to rip his hands away but this time it’s Tony who overpowers him. Steve could easily regain that power, but it’s Tony, and he’s weak.
Steve was just as excited, if not more. It was still scary knowing that in a few weeks he will be a father, but the idea of holding his son for the first time pushes those fears away.
“I hate you.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony assures and he steps into the room, moving toward the dresser and pulling out a fresh shirt for Steve. “I remember where you left everything,” he explains when Steve looks at him quizzically.
“I did. You don’t listen to a word I say.”
He hasn’t shut everyone out. He talks to Pepper and Rhodey from time to time. Even Jarvis is still up and running, though some days Tony wants to pull the plug on him just to avoid another lecture. But he never does. He takes the scolding and promises to do better. It’s what he’s been doing since Peter walked into his life.
He takes a few steps down before stopping and sitting down on one of the steps. Above him he can still hear his party going on without him.
“That’s what I came to talk to you about. Barnes is being released. He’ll be flown in tonight.”
Maybe.
The door opens and the doctor enters the room. Doctor Patterson is a petite woman with dark, shoulder length hair and hazel eyes. Tony had only spoken to her briefly, but already he can tell she was going to be someone he could trust.
“Yeah. But they’re still really old,” Peter tries to defend.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Just do it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why does he have
Steve cowers and forms himself into a ball, whimpering when Pierce gets too close. “No. No! No please!” Steve pleads when he’s yanked by the ankle and dragged closer. He scrambles, kicking out and successfully hitting the alpha in the stomach.
“I know, but honestly I hate seeing you like this. If you want a baby then we’re gonna have one. And if this doesn’t work then we can always adopt. Or I make us a cute little robot baby.”
“I’m not a murderer.”
Steve’s face falls and he rushes to console his pup. He sits down on the couch and pulls his son into his lap, wrapping him in a hug and scenting him to calm him down. James sniffs again and buries his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent.
“I have an idea,” Clint smirks and Tony’s eyes travel in his direction. “Don’t worry you’ll figure it out in nine months.”
Steve sighs sadly. “Pete, this is too dangerous. I need you here. When you’re older you can do these missions but not now.”
Bucky snorts and shakes his head. “Steve wasn’t a saint, Nat. I wouldn’t be surprised if his kid was getting into fights in alleys.”
“Ten thirty,” Tony replies. He hasn’t taken his hand off Steve’s shoulder. The touch is nice.
“I think he’s gonna take after you,” Tony says with a small laugh.
“How long...was this recent?” Peter asks.
A new alert is coming through. It’s from Steve.
It’s an alert from FRIDAY that is jolting Tony awake. The room is darker, one glance out the window showing just how long he’s slept. Tony sits up, groaning softly and digging the heels of his hands in his eyes. It takes a few seconds for him to gather himself, and once he does, he turns toward his right, finding that Steve is no longer in bed with him.
It’s at that moment when Morgan decides she wants attention, and she grows fussy. Tony is the first to console her, taking her out of her swing and bringing her over to join them.
“That’s walking away. If you have complaints then take it up with Nick. Maybe he can-”
Tony uses the towel to wipe away the blood and other fluids clinging to his son’s body. “Come on, kiddo. Come on. Don’t do this,” Tony pleads, his vision growing blurry from the tears he’s fighting back.
Tony fights again, this time managing to slip one arm free and connect his fist with one of the alpha’s jaws. It had been Rumlow that he had hit, and the alpha snarls angrily and lunges for Tony, only to hold back when he’s ordered to stand down.
“It’s not a big deal.”
“I really am sorry. I didn’t know they would do that. I mean…I kinda did but hoped they wouldn’t. My dad isn’t that scary.”
“I’m so sorry, papa. I didn’t mean for this to happen-”
“I really think you should go back to bed,” Tony says.
Tony must pick up on his hesitation because he carefully passes Peter to Natasha. Her face lights up the moment he’s in her arms and his eyes flutter open to meet hers.
Tony lowers himself down on one of the sofas, his eyes immediately trailing to the empty armchair beside him. He wonders if Steve would have sat next to him, or maybe even talk to him. Maybe Steve would have been willing to forgive and they move forward. They would become the family Steve wanted them to be.
“Can we not talk about the B word?” Peter suggests, his eyes flickering in Flash’s direction again. Flash had decided to abandon dinner and hide behind his glass of water.
“We still have right now.”
But that’s exactly what Steve wanted...right?
“Haven’t had this in a while,” Steve admits and he takes a bite, moaning a little from the delicious flavor bursting across his taste buds.
Steve shuts his eyes and gives in.
“Don’t push it. You don’t have to open up all at once. I get it. But...why do you trust me?”
“I know. I just wanted to help. He asked you but-”
“He doesn’t sleep.” Steve tries to stifle a yawn but fails miserably. “He kept me and Buck up all night.”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve moans and thrusts up. Tony takes more of him into his mouth, filling the room with lewd sounds. Steve curses when his cock hits the back of Tony’s throat and tips his head back. He was going to come soon.
“Don’t worry. It won’t take that long.”
Steve’s face heats up and he hides it in the crook of Tony’s neck. Just like with Peter, the familiar scent comforts him. Tony holds him close, enjoying the bit of time they get before the rest of the house wakes up.
The last person he expected to see in front of him was Iron Man.
“Depressed? How?” Tony directs his attention to his husband, brows drawing together in confusion. Steve is currently having a conversation with both Sam and Bucky, and Tony was sure there was a hint of a smile on Steve’s face. “He doesn’t seem-”
“Tell me everything,” the alpha says.
Tony scoffs. “Trust me I’m trying not to. This kid has been the only good thing in my life. You know, besides you and Rhodey and Happy. You guys are my family.”
“Whoa! Hey I wasn’t ready!” Peter makes sure to take a step back in case another punch came his way. Steve chuckles at his son’s reaction and Peter frowns. “It’s not funny! I wasn’t ready!”
The next contraction causes Steve to emit a gasp and he shifts, groaning when the pain in his belly intensifies. All Tony can do is hold Steve’s hand and encourage him softly. It wasn’t enough.
“Pete.” Steve sighs heavily and shakes him again. “It’s time to get up.”
The apartment is quiet when Steve comes in and he figures Tony is still asleep, only to find that the master bedroom is empty. Steve frowns to himself and checks the nursery, and that’s where he finds Tony.
Tony pulls back slightly so that he can press a kiss to Steve’s forehead. Tears are running down Steve’s face, and Tony gently wipes them away. He kisses Steve softly on the lips.
The elevator doors open and Steve steps out, walking briskly through the corridor toward the medical wing. He spots Natasha first, relief washing over him when he finds her alright. Her hair is disheveled and there are a few scratches and bruises on her face, but nothing she hasn’t endured before.
“You’re joking?”
“Just don’t worry about it. You have more than enough people now. You have your buddies Barnes and Wilson on the team. That’s enough, right?”
“He looks a lot like you,” Tony smiles and he reaches out to place a hand over the top of his son’s head. “You did it, Steve. And look, he’s here and he’s healthy.”
“With Pete? Yeah. Look how great he was when you were pregnant. That dog won’t let anything happen to this kid. I know it.”
Tony tosses the letter on the desk and reaches into his pocket for his phone, quickly dialing the number he had tried to forget. It rings and rings and rings until Tony is greeted with the sound of Steve’s voicemail. He sighs harshly and hangs up, then dials again. He gets the same thing, but instead of hanging up, he waits for the beep.
“I guess he does need this huh?” Tony exams the gift and sets it aside.
It’s not surprising when Morgan is picked up from school one day and she finds the backseat empty. Happy explains that Peter was staying behind to practice for his decathlon and would arrive home later. Morgan doesn’t mind. For once she’s able to talk about her day.
“I left? Left where?”
“Of course. Steve and I are good. Really good actually. I’ve thought about-” Tony stops himself. The idea of marriage has crossed his mind more times than he’d care to admit. For as long as he could remember, marriage was something he decided wasn’t for him. He hadn’t met the one and decided he was better off alone. It was safer that way. But then he met Steve and they had a son. Now marriage didn’t seem so bad.
“I know. Just a few more weeks right? Bruce said late August.”
Steve turns to peer up at the alpha. “Okay.”
. You never fucking asked how I was doing. It was always about you. This has always been about you!”
Peter makes sure it’s just the two of them before lifting up both his hoodie and shirt, exposing the small bump beginning to form. Ned’s eyes widen and he gasps.
“How many were there?”
Alpha enters the room, already wearing a pleased smile on his face. He comes closer and the two alpha’s step away to allow their leader more room. He stands beside the omega, and with one hand, reaches out for him, brushing his fingers against the bruise that’s already beginning to form.
A part of him wants to let go and return back to Alpha, but the other half reminds him of what’s in store for both himself and his pup. He can’t let Hydra hurt him anymore. He can’t let them hurt his pup.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures and kisses them again. “It’s just daddy.”
Everyone gathers in the common room. Natasha and Bruce take one sofa while Bucky and Sam take another. The chair remains empty. It always would.
Tony scoffed.  “Oh yeah. You know, things were going so well I thought I’d just take a nap in a Wal Mart parking lot.”
“Thanks.”
“Tony…”
Steve turned to look at him, looking mildly offended. “No, of course not. Why, did you think I would?”
A week passed since their little coffee date.
“Mhm.” Tony hums, voice deep and low. “Tell me how it feels, baby.”
He tried to get a hold of his repulsors but his whole left side was damaged and unresponsive, and it was impossible to steer. Not that he’d be able to if he could get a hold on it, considering his external video feed was cut off and he was just staring at a black screen.
Tony must have sensed that he was meandering because he twisted in his seat, leather crunching under him as he moved.
Besides, he was currently working on an advanced support mechanism that would aid with the mending of bone and tissue, and what better way to test out his latest invention then to use it on himself?
Tony made good on his word and sent him the terms and conditions later that night.
Arousal prickled his skin, and Steve’s hand instinctively went down to palm himself over the towel. Tony wanted a show? He could do that.
“That's business, my boy.”
Hala stood abruptly, spear in hand as she snarled at him. She looked like someone with nothing to lose. “You and your pathetic accomplices do not threaten my armies.”
Steve, hands still bound above his head, deflated into the bed. “I'm trying.” He huffed, as if Tony would think he was sabotaging the film on purpose. Sure, he might not totally agree with his sudden career change, but at the end of the day he still wanted a paycheck.
Oh yeah, Tony definitely like her.
Deciding to just screw it and go for broke Steve undoes his jeans, pushing them down along with his dark blue boxer briefs until they’re bunched around his ankles, lifting one foot out of them and then the other before doing the same thing he did with his shirt.
“Very well. If you will not serve me, then you will die with the rest of your pathetic species.” She spits at him, waving her hand towards her minions. “Guards! Destroy the foolish man.”
Steve groans and rolls his eyes. He hates when Bucky does laundry. He never puts anything away so its always a gamble whether the clothes were clean or not. He picks up a red long sleeve and gives it a whiff, deciding it smells clean enough and slips into it.
“I’m just saying that maybe instead of fighting him all the time, you two should maybe try to get along?”
“I like to be touched.” He shrugged, feeling encouraged when Mr. Stark hummed in reply. “I’m uh, really sensitive “ He added with a shy laugh.
“But I…” He sputtered, completely shocked. “Tony, you can’t just--"
Tony leans over to kiss him, fingers working him from the inside with practiced ease like he has somre kind of innate knowledge about his body. Steve's already moaning obscenely, the noises muffled by Tony's tongue insistently fucking his mouth. He feels those fingers move deeper, stroking over his prostate and a sudden jolt of pleasure explodes through his body.
Honestly, and he was supposedly the one with the Irish temper.
Steve’s blush came back to his cheeks, and Tony watched as he bit down on his bottom lip, a bashful smile tugging at the corner of the bond’s mouth.
That answer made Tony pause and narrow his eyes, like he was searching the World War II veteran for some sort of ulterior motive. In his experience, people didn’t just want to be his friend without cause. Especially when they’d made it blatantly obvious that they didn’t like him.
That wasn’t part of the script.
Kinky porn doesn’t scare him. His face and naked body are all over the internet anyways, so what else does he have to lose?
“Get those fingers nice and slick for me, baby.”
A giant lizard creature ripping the tapered top off of the Drop Tower, it’s huge, lashing tail taking a good chunk out of the Cyclone as it let out an ear piercing shriek.
Tony shot the ex-con a murderous glare before glancing over to see Steve by the kitchen sink, wearing neon pink rubber gloves and scrubbing grease out of a frying pan while the rest of the team sat around the table eating breakfast. He still didn’t quite understand why Steve opted to do the dishes when they had a perfectly functional dishwasher.
“I think we’ve been on enough dates.” Steve said, continuing to paw at his backside.
spent the last 10 years gathering from auctions that you took down to hang up your stupid posters?” Pepper countered.
Now it was Steve’s turn to blink, because honestly Tony had rejected every other offer of comradery he’d ever made so he hadn’t expected this time to be different.
Also, shameless plug for anyone who's interested, I opened a Ko-fi shop for my art and will soon (eventually) be accepting commissions so if you're into that sort of thing check me out @ https://ko-fi.com/catland
He was eager to follow the instruction, tentatively sliding his hand up along his abdomen and around to cup one of his pecs, his other hand still firmly grasping his rock hard dick. A shiver ran up his spine as a rush of burning pleasure shot straight down to his cock the moment his thumb rolled over a pebbled nipple. He’d always been a bit embarrassed by how sensitive his chest was, but the way Tony paid attention to it made him feel privileged.
Hawkeye was first to act, shooting the beast’s feet with a couple of his ice arrows, encasing the powerful legs in a thick tomb of ice that immobilized him. Once the target was frozen in place, Steve knelt down with his shield overhead, ready to launch Natasha up at the enormous lizard. She sprinted, jumping onto his shield with a somersault, flipping majestically into the air and onto the lizard’s scaled back when the Captain boosted her up. She grabbed onto the rough skin, fingernails chipping as she struggled to climb onto its shoulder while it thrashed.
Tony remained silent, his eyes narrowed. Steve sighed.
“Don’t play dumb Tony. I’ve seen the way you look at this guy. Practically begging for the attention of some pretty tramp.” He sneered, and then his expression turned into something that might have resembled pity if it were coming from anyone other than this asshole. "And here I thought you'd learned your lesson the last time you sampled your own goods."
“What is it, what’s wrong?” He asked when Tony still didn’t tell him what was so urgent.
Tony followed Steve up the stairs, his feet dragging with every step. Being away from his work made him realize he painfully exhausted he was, and considering his last pot of coffee had run dry a few hours ago, he was basically just running on fumes.
Tony’s jaw tightened at the threat, his hard stare wavering as Steve revved the engine again.
A deafening screech pierced through the air as the Hulk tore sheets of reinforced metal from the hull, literally ripping the vessel to shreds.
…okay, okay. I uh, I'll figure something out and call you back.” He says, ripping off the headset before the other guy can even get a word in and lets it drop on the desk. He pushes a hand though his hair, completely ruining the perfect coif. “You weren’t supposed to be in today.” He pants, looking down at Steve with glossy eyes.
“I could tell you about my first time?”
.” Tony hissed as Pepper tilted his head up with practiced ease to fuss over her boss. Steve would have run to Tony’s side instead, but he had to deal with Bucky.
Steve quirked his lips and countered with, “I met you for coffee, on my day off, just you and me. Is this a date?”
It was sinful how good Mr. Blond hair and blue eyes looked in bondage gear. Tony had never had a personal kink for the whole bondage tag, but watching Steve was seriously making him readjust his priorities.
He poured the coffee into a red mug with a gold handle, cradling it like a priceless gem with both hands before bringing it to his lips and took a long sip. The hot liquid burned his tongue on the way down but he didn’t care. The self-indulgent super genius tilted his head back, letting out a satisfied groan of pleasure as he felt the much needed caffeine boost.
The team shared confused looks, all except for Natasha of course who gave them a hidden smile. “We’ll save you guys a spot. Come on.” She said, leading them out of the conference room.
Tony's cut off mid rant as Steve makes quick work of his pants and fishes his soft cock out, lips wrapping around the member as he takes him into his mouth. Tony haunches over, his hand coming up to grab a fist full of Steve's hair as a few more curses spill from his lips.
Steve, maybe a little obscene, leans back against the countertops, fully aware of the way his abs ripple as he stretches. “I know.”
“You’re not the only tech savvy one here Stark. I had people look into this guy -- find out his full name, his background, where he lives.” Stane listed off, eyes flicking across his computer monitor. “Did you know he used to serve in the US military? His friend did too. Apparently he took an early discharge to help him recover after an accident. How noble.”
There was a shuffle as the soldier shifted above him and the billionaire let out a sigh of relief once his groin was no longer being squashed by a bony knee. Just when Tony thought Steve was going to get to his feet and help him up he felt a warm pressure on his mouth and realized Steve was kissing him.
He didn’t mind it, even if it made his job twice as hard by reminding the toddler every ten minutes ‘
Steve kept up the cock tease, panting heavily as he stroked himself, but when that didn’t earn him any influx he decided he needed to up his game.
”I’ve been wanting you to fuck me since I started working here.” He growls
Tony gave Steve an accusing look, standing there in his tight fitting, barely concealing black spandex under armor, his arms crossed over his chest in definace. “Nuh uh Cap, no way. I don’t ride bitch.”
“Usually people call me the impatient one.” He chuckles, taking his dear sweet time and driving Steve crazy.
“That won't be necessary.” Tony said flatly.
“He passed a few years ago.”
Even if it was just a sprain, it was nice to know that the super soldier was making sure he got from A to B without falling over.
He’d brought up on more than one occasion that Howard’s obsession with Captain America seemed a bit queer to him. He’d often met the back of his hand whenever he mentioned that.
“Didn’t you read my file? I don’t exactly play well with others.”
They waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot, automatic doors sliding closed and leaving them secluded in the office room. The silence dragged on for a few moments after that, Tony’s hands shoved in his pockets as the two hovered around each other. The tension in the air was so thick you could probably cut it with a spoon. Steve was the first to break it.
“Looks like my plan is working out pretty swell.”
Tony grunted, his unprotected face inches away from sparking wires. “Tell him I’m busy.”
Ooh-kay, so this was a legitimate porn site. A legitimate porn site that he'd actually been offered a job to work at as a freakin' porn star.
Steve had done his fair share of research on the porn industry since he'd first gotten the email. This was what was referred to as an intro tape – basically a prelude to the actual porn so that the directors would know how the actor handles being on camera and if they can pull off the sex appeal.
“I am. Come on, let’s start fresh. No grudges, no judgement. Clean slate.”
Tony gave a surprised smile, like Steve’s gratitude for some cake and a bit of champagne was completely unwarranted. “Its nothing, really. You worked hard, you deserve a little compensation.”
Natasha said, voice stern but sexy.
Before they could strike up another conversation the sound of heels clicking against linoleum caught his attention, and Steve turned around to see Pepper walking towards them.
“I don’t
“Make the deal or I'll leak the info.”
Steve woke up the next morning warm and pleasantly sore in a big, fluffy bed, completely enveloped in thick, puffy blankets with one of his bare legs bent at the knee and sticking out from the cocoon.
Steve grins widely in victory before leaning in to kiss him. Tony returns to kiss briefly before pulling away with a heavy sigh.
“Submit?” Steve muttered, clearing his throat. “You make me sound like I’m forcing him to spend time with me.”
Tony responded with a raised eyebrow. “You seriously want me to crash your old people party?”
He’d even spray painted the bike to match the Captain’s patriotic colour scheme, which Steve was less than impressed by, but took the peace offering anyway and settled into his new home.
Tony hummed in response, leaning around Steve so he could reach out and scoop some of the batter dripping down the lip of the bowl onto his finger, ignoring the glare that the blond was sending his way as he tasted it.
Steve exited the car and stretched his arms up high over his head, breathing in a large gulp of air. It was nice living in the city, he loved it considering he’d spent all his life in the heart of Brooklyn, but the breath of fresh air was definitely a refresher.
“No, we’re not.” He agreed with a sigh, pausing briefly before speaking again. “But I’d like to be.”
Tony decided to tread carefully, like he was walking across a freshly frozen pond.
His suit was useless, and while Tony Stark considered himself a very resourceful man, he doubted that he could take on
“It is possible to get on his good side, you know. You just have to earn his respect.”
“Yeah, I remember. This was my teddy from way back when I was a kid. Howard picked it up at an airport when he forgot my birthday.” He snorted, shaking his head as he stroked his thumb over the soft, black nose where threads had long separated and began to split. “I must have been, god, I don’t know. Five or six?”
Besides, he did have some things to pick up at the studio so if Tony’s not as into him as he thinks, he could always play the ‘just stopping by and thought I'd be nice' card.
“There are only two kinds of people in this world that I have a problem with, and one of them is bullies.“ He admitted, voice low and unwavering.
Tony’s jaw visibly clenched and he threw the half eaten ice cream into a trash bin. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
After however much time he spent unconscious, Tony groaned, neck straining to lift his head with the dead weight of the Iron Man helm. He gave up when he could only raise his neck a couple centimeters off the ground, letting his head fall back against the concrete.
No one else has shown up yet, so Steve takes the opportunity to look around and familiarize himself with the space.
Smooth Stark, very deserving of that playboy title.
“I…I don’t know what to say.”
Could they ever catch just one fucking break….
Steve startles slightly at the sudden gruff voice, whipping his head around to see a rugged looking man with dark hair and a heavy five O’clock shadow. That must be his co-star.
Steve’s lips twitch into a smile, chest still heaving from the second earth shattering orgasm Tony has given him. “Guess I’ll take that as a compliment.” He says, sitting up and sliding off the desk to grab his clothes. He can feel Tony’s come trickling down the backs of his thighs and wonders if he can make it to the showers before there’s too much of a mess.
Tony and Steve try to see eye to eye over lunch, but they get interrupted when the city falls victim to another invasion from our favorite iron dictator. However, there is some progress to their relationship.
Steve exhaled, wiping some of the sweat from his brow. “I take it you haven’t come here to defend Tony’s reckless actions?”
Steve, holding the four trays of brownies in one arm reached over her tiny frame to embrace the old woman, mindful of his strength. “And miss your world famous three bean salad? Never.”
So, before anyone comments just know that I have no knowledge about baseball. At all. I googled baseball teams and stuff like that, so if there are any inconsistencies it's because I know nothing of sports.
Something about quantum ion projectiles and magnetic propulsion fields… Honestly, Steve probably had a better chance of understanding him if the genius was speaking Chinese.
With his free hand, Steve curls his fist around the base of his cock, stroking himself at the same time as he plunges his fingers as deep as he can. The angle is weird and it isn't enough. His fingers can't reach his prostate so he strokes himself faster, squeezing his fingers tighter every time his hand slides over the tip of his cock.
He downed the eggy beverage in a few quick gulps, wiping his hand over his mouth just as Tony walked into the kitchen.
Tony lifts a hand up to cup Steve’s head, bringing him in for a steamy kiss. Steve reciprocates immediately, tilting his head just slightly so that he can slide his tongue past Tony’s pliant lips. He moves the hand that’s not currently wrapped around Tony’s cock up, pressing his open palm against Tony’s chest and pushing him down onto his back while he moves to straddle him, getting a bit bolder.
Tony paid close attention to the way Steve’s body responded to her words, soft pink lips parting as his cock seemed to throb in anticipation. Even though the billionaire had seen him in action, he still gave off a certain innocence from his almost boy-scout demeanor. Natasha was tarnishing that innocence, and Tony liked it. That woman was a pro. She could make even Tony quiver in his shoes, Steve didn’t stand a chance.
Then came the soothing drawl of Jarvis’s British accent echoing through the speakers.
Steve chases his mouth, kissing him a few more times before Tony painfully pulls away, leaving one last searing kiss on his lips.
He starts pumping his cock, slowly at first, his grip firm and steady. Mr. Stark's eyes are fixed on him, and Steve can't find it in him to look away, holding eye contact as his fist moves rapidly up and down his shaft, the wet sound of skin slapping filling the otherwise quiet room.
Steve let out a howl, the cry subdued by the red, plastic ball between his teeth, arching his back against the pile of cushions he was draped across. The stimulation was quickly becoming too much, and Steve could feel the sticky pre-cum that had dribbled out of his cock and dribbled into his navel. He was close, so close it ached and yet not close enough to reach his climax. His dick was flushed a dark red, bobbing desperately in search of any touch that could give him the final push he needed.
Sam stayed in his seat, watching Steve’s back as he ran off and called out “Have fun on your date!” with a toothy grin.
In just a few short minutes, there was a tray sliding towards him with tasty looking hors d’oeuvres littered across it.
“You got some kind of problem with me?” He asks, squaring his shoulders and staring the man down. He’s never met the guy, so he has no idea why he’s acting like Steve pissed in his oatmeal.
“I’m really gonna enjoy breaking you in, blondie.” He whispers gruffly, bumping Steve’s shoulder as he passes. Steve shudders and feels a heavy pit in his stomach at the words.
“Sir, I can't disclose personal information about any of our employees for security reasons.”
“Cap!” Tony called out when he saw Steve fall to the ground, taking out the robots that were shooting at his teammate. “That’s it.”
“You were a most excellent participant my brother! I look forward to experiencing pleasure alongside you on our next venture.” He says proudly, grabbing Steve by the shoulder to pull him into a rough hug.
“Go make us some money pretty boy!” Bucky hollered after him.
Why he hired a prick like Nick Fury, Steve would never know, but since Tony was a supposed billionaire and could afford just about any Hollywood director to film his little snuff films he figured there was some reasoning behind it.
“Your taste in art is too classic, doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate it.” He shot back, fiddling with the edge of his napkin. “Besides, Steve really wanted to go. Would you say no to Captain America? The guys got these goddamn puppy dog eyes, you try saying no to him.” He shrugged, casually leaning back in his chair.
Steve wasn’t too sure what he was implying with that, but knowing the genius it couldn’t be anything good so he simply narrowed his eyes and offered him a displeased stare.
Tony rolled his eyes and nearly slammed the decanter back down on the counter. “Why are you here?”
After cleaning himself up Steve made his way to the conference room and was immediately assaulted with explosions of glitter and party horns the second he opened the door. He stood frozen at the doorway, completely dumbfounded by the hundreds of phallic balloons and party decorations littering the entire meeting area. It looked like someone’s trashy bachelorette party.
Bless this woman.
She gave a slight nod of her head and hummed, eyes drifting closed briefly. “I married after the war. Had a son.” Peggy turned to him and smile fondly. “I named him Steven.”
“Why are you here? What business do you have with earth?” He commands, using his Captain voice.
Tony was sent flying miles back from the force of his own Unibeam as it backfired against him.
He's moaning softly, poking his tongue out to a catch some of the cum dribbling across his lips. He was never a fan of the taste, but he still plays it up for the cameras, knowing the audience would lap it up.
Steve took in a heavy breath and turned his full attention on Tony.
Tony snorted and smirked at the memory, pausing a moment before answering her. “Friends is a strong word. I’d say we’re more like… an old lazy cat who’s too tired to chase the mouse anymore.”
Tony held his ground as he entered the space next to Steve, looking ready to step between them if he needed to, his stance firm and authoritative. “Yes I am, now get the hell out before I call the po--"
The soft prickle of Tony’s beard against the back of his neck tickled, sending delightful shivers down his spine. Steve laughs softly, craning his neck back until he can just barely see the messy mop of brown hair behind him.
“Do you really want me to answer that?” Bucky deadpans.
“Forget it. Let’s get something to eat and-”
But that didn’t mean his relationship with Tony was perfect; there was no such thing as a perfect relationship and couple, but they came pretty damn close. They bickered still and sometimes went to bed angry, but they always came back to each other in the end.
“Hey, Mr. Stark? He’ll get better, right? I don’t know much about postpartum depression, but I think he’ll beat it. He’s Captain America. I mean, he can beat anything!”
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes, “I’m sorry. I’m trying. I swear I’m trying.”
The effects of the alcohol and their mating session was enough to wear the alpha out. Steve had contemplated falling asleep just to escape the nightmare he’s found himself in, but he forced himself to remain awake.
Steve tries the door across the room, somehow hoping that it would open and he would be free. But the lock is still in place, preventing him from leaving.
Steve’s eyes shoot open when the jet rocks roughly, his body jerking in his seat. He gasps and he forces himself to look out the little window. He half expects to find the jet going nose first into frozen water, but he’s quick to remind himself that this wasn’t like that. He was safe now. Tony was keeping him safe.
Harley points down at the mess he’s made. “Shit.”
“Why do you have to go?” Peter asks. “You promised you wouldn’t.”
“I am on his side.”
Steve is pushed forward and he loses his balance, staggering for a moment until one of the alphas grabs him and leads him in the right direction. The sound of a helicopter reaches his ears and Steve comes to a stop, this time putting up a fight. A throbbing in his head makes itself known and that’s when Steve realizes he’s been hit. He goes limp.
“Shit,” Steve mutters a curse and leans back in his seat with a sigh. “I don’t have any of this figured out.”
“Why? You love it.”
“I hate to interrupt,” she says, her tone soft. “But the director wants to finally meet you.”
“Dammit, Steve, look at me. I did feel sorry for you and the situation you were in. And believe me at the time I didn’t know what the fuck was going on and if what you were telling me was true. You have to understand where I’m coming from. I went from showing up at some charity event to coming home and not remember a damn thing to you telling me we met and we’re having a kid. So I’m sorry that I reacted the way I did but it wasn’t just you going through shit. My life was turned upside down too.”
“I’m sorry, honey. I know that you wanted them. I know you wanted Peter. But I didn’t. I had to get rid of them.”
Tony hums in response and trails his hand lower, smirking with Steve’s breath hitches. The rest of Steve’s clothes joins the discarded ones on the floor, leaving him completely bare to Tony’s eyes. It’s a sight Tony never gets tired of seeing. Steve was beautiful.
“I got it,” Sam says when he catches Bruce’s worried gaze.
“You sure you don’t want a checkup?” Bruce asks Tony again.
Bucky opens his mouth to interrupt again but Sam stops him, squeezing his thigh to tell him to back off.
“We can...clean,” he says, his eyes roaming over the living room. He can’t even begin to imagine packing all of their movies and books and photos into a box.
Tony sighs. A part of him is regretting ever letting Steve into his car. None of this would have happened if they never met. He was just fine living his life without the knowledge of Steve and some insane occult. But the other half is relieved that he knows the truth. He couldn’t imagine living his life while Steve and their child suffered.
“We’re so excited to meet you,” Steve continues to talk to their son in a soft voice. “Just a few more months and you’ll be here. I can’t wait to hold you for the first time. I promise daddy’s excited too. He’s just…” Steve sighs. “He’s just tired. And a little cranky. He can’t have coffee anymore. But he loves you so much. And so do I.”
“Yes, Alpha,” Steve nods.
It’s not the answer Steve was searching for.
As soon as Ned is walking the opposite direction and blending in with the crowd, Peter rushes toward the nearest bathroom and locks himself in the last stall. He shrugs his backpack off, not caring if it falls onto the dirty floor beneath his feet.
Tony immediately senses something is wrong. “You alright? Is it the baby?”
“Fuck me,” he begs.
Peter doesn’t laugh and instead sits down quietly on one of the cushions. He scoots forward until he’s sitting on the edge and picks up a small bottle of hand sanitizer for his hands.
“Nah. We have ways to pass the time. Building a nursery for one.”
Peter smiles. “You know...dad was talking about a new suit upgrade and maybe...if you want...you can look at the blueprints. You always have the best ideas so I don’t know maybe-”
“Yeah...I think so.”
“I’m sorry, Tony.” And there it is. Tony can’t stay upset with her. It wasn’t her fault.
“Relax!” Tony stops pacing to face his husband. “How the fuck am I supposed to relax! Our son is pregnant! Our 17-year-old son! Fuck!”
“I love you more.”
“Um…”
“Thank you, Tony. You’ve done so much and...I don’t know how to repay you.”
“I don’t know how you can say that. This is my first time holding him. I don’t have any of this figured out yet,” Tony admits.
“Just don’t spit up on me okay?”
Steve chuckles. “Sorry. Get some sleep. You need a break.”
Ned’s eyes go wide for a second before he’s putting on a serious face. Or as serious as he can.
“-then I’m gonna have to pass.”
He eases back on the tea and crushes the pills up and slips them into Steve’s food instead. Steve doesn’t notice, or if he does complain that something seems off, Tony is quick to assure him that it was all in his head. The food was fine.
Steve gasps and he glances up at Tony, finding the alpha smiling and holding a small box in his hand.
“Clearly you’ve said enough. Look at him!” Pepper gestures to the teenager. “He’s crying!”
“You were forced to-”
I finally decided on Flash because I haven’t really read that pairing before and I thought it would be interesting to write about. And now Steve knows!
He’s ready to put an end to this until he sees the look on Steve's face. It’s a look he thought he’d never see again. There was a glimmer of hope crossing his features as he took in the same scene as Tony.
“He hasn’t had any real care, has he?”
“No.” Tony shakes his head and tries to reach for Steve’s hand to apologize, only for the omega to pull away. Tony sighs sadly. “It’s not your fault. Don’t be sorry.”
This chapter actually inspired me to write a little one-shot that I will be posting soon, but that's random. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I will update soon!
Steve growls at the order and the gun digs deeper into his temple.
He’s hard at work on his own project, something he won’t allow Tony even a small glimpse of. Ever since Steve discovered one of Tony’s old journals, he would sketch every now and then. It was an old hobby of his that he had been forced to give up, another thing Hydra had stolen from him. But now he was getting back into it. Tony made a mental note to get Steve his own art supplies instead of an old journal and a pencil.
Steve pushes past him to leave, only to stop when Tony is reaching out and grabbing his arm. The contact shoots a spark through him. He’s missed feeling that spark.
“Nat did say she’s available if we ever need it.”
Steve nods in agreement. “They need a lot of attention. I’m working on creating a bond and letting them get used to my scent but…” Steve trails off with a sigh. “It’s going to take more than that to get them comfortable.”
Tony returns back to pacing. “Fuckfuckfuck.”
Tony sighs when his daughter continues to express her displeasure. It was times like this when he wishes Steve was here. He wonders if Steve’s absence is the reason why Morgan was upset.
“I can’t train you or anything like that. It’s not up to me if you become an Avenger or not. I’m not exactly one anymore. But I can make you that suit.”
“No. Let’s just go. Sorry about the car.” Steve winces at the thought of getting into the car in his current state.
“Why can’t you sleep like this at night?” Tony questions. “You’re keeping your papa up.”
“Bingo. And in my favorite color.” Tony smirks and takes the cuffs from Steve’s hands. “It’ll be fun. I’ll tie you up, maybe blindfold you.”
Tony leans back to remove his pants, his fingers fumbling with the button of his jeans. Steve sits up and takes over, popping the button open with ease and lowering the zipper. He slides his hand inside the front of Tony’s pants and rubs his cock, emitting a sharp breath from his mate.
“Nah. I’ll be fine. I’m probably going to head out tomorrow morning or tonight if I can.”
“How do you know? He’ll do anything to get me back. I’m...important to him.”
“You pictured a family with me?”
“No!” Peter giggles and Tony frowns. “I want to be you!”
“I just like to be-”
“J, make sure all incoming calls from Steve Rogers are blocked. Emails too.”
Tony has Jarvis play back the surveillance of him coming home after the party. He’s seen it multiple times already and every time he was left feeling confused and without answers.
Speaking to a total stranger would probably have the same results, but at least Steve wouldn’t feel like this person was going to use whatever he told them against him. S.H.I.E.L.D wouldn’t do that, though. At least, Tony hopes they wouldn’t.
And they’re there for the most exciting appointment. The room is crowded with the Avengers in one room. The doctor appears nervous to be in a small space with the Hulk, but Bruce promised he was okay.
(See the end of the chapter for
So he does.
“Captain, he’s not safe to be around while you are with child.”
“Feel good?” Steve asks and he crooks his finger again.
The pup giggles again and races toward the house. James chases after him.
Peter peers up the pile of dvds he’s sorting through and chuckles. “I have no idea.”
“I’ll sleep on the couch then!” Tony calls out to his boyfriend. He wouldn’t of course, not when he was here first and it was his bed. The dog had no business showing up uninvited and claiming everything as his.
“You could’ve gotten some coffee or a muffin. The break room on the first floor has those tiny blueberry ones.”
That plan could still very well be in motion. He already accomplished the escape part and it was highly unlikely that they would search for him here. For the time being he was safe. His pup was safe. That’s all that mattered.
“Yeah she was...hang on. You’re not Pepper’s assistant, are you?”
Tony has shot down every name Steve could possibly think of. Naming their son had started off as a fun and exciting way to spend the afternoon, but then Tony was growing cranky and hating every name Steve gave him.
Steve gasps suddenly, forcing the alpha to pull away.
Yay I’m updating again! Now Tony can fix his mistake! Ugh these two. I swear they’ll be okay 😊
“It’s all right. I was just curious.”
Tony has to fight back the urge to do anything other than stand still and watch. He wants to turn and run. He wants to make the scene disappear from his mind forever. But the other half wants to help. He could help Steve and everything would be fine. Steve would be alive and they could be a family.
Tony was excited too, though maybe it wasn’t just the birth that he was looking forward to. He hated being pregnant. Okay, maybe not all aspects of it were terrible. He enjoyed the break he received, though there were times when he wishes he was back in the field or down in his lab. Feeling his son move for the first time was hands down his favorite experience. His favorite thing to do was lie still and watch as his belly morphed into odd shapes when Peter rolled around. The constant kicking to his ribs and the pressure on his bladder was something he wasn’t a fan of, but he managed. He’d do it all again if it meant Steve got to be happy.
“Why would he?” Bucky interrupts Bruce. “He hasn’t bothered to show up before. Why would he now?”
“You belong to me.” Pierce comes closer until he’s kneeling on the edge of the mattress, then he crawls on his knees toward the omega. Steve bares his teeth and growls in warning, but he goes ignored and strong hands are gripping him by the ankles and tugging him close. “Stop fighting me! You’re my omega!”
Happy shakes his head and points at Tony. “He’s making it up to me.”
“No.” Steve’s hand flies out to stop his husband from leaving the table. “Leave them alone.”
“Steve is outside, sir.”
“He’s staying the night,” Sam explains.
“Yeah.” Tony doesn’t even hesitate to answer. He wanted Steve to be his omega and he was willing to take their relationship slow if it meant getting Steve at the end. His feelings for Steve were strong and getting stronger every day.
Steve nods. He knows the cry, too. But instead of asking for her, he surprises Tony by saying, “There’s a bottle in the fridge. I’ll warm it.”
“He’s not yours,” Tony seethes.
“You do,” Natasha agrees. She picks up her glass and exits the kitchen, making her way over to one of the sofas. Tony follows her, taking the chair. He doesn’t miss the way she eyes him. “That’s his chair.”
“Why do you have to be so grumpy?” Steve asks once they’re back in the car and away from the swarm of paparazzi. He can already picture the headlines. He wonders if they’re the reason for his husband’s bad attitude.
obvious. “You
“Easy. Give me the rights to Howards Company and I’ll sweep all of this under the rug.” Stane grinned, toothy and wicked.
She quickly flipped through the papers before clipping them to her clipboard. “Perfect. If you'll follow me I'll show you around the studio and then I'll take you to Mr. Stark's office for the taped interview.”
Tony smirks and withdraws his fingers. Steve starts to whine at the sudden emptiness, but it quickly turns into a heady moan as Tony unzips his trousers and pushes his cock inside him.
“Less damage than if we followed your plan and kept firing useless attacks at it.” Tony shot back, assuming a defensive position.
Steve hovered around for a few moments longer, arms crossed over his chest, not making any comment as the brunet struggled to get the floppy squares of beef ravioli to stay on his spoon long enough to make it to his mouth.
“Shoot.” He said, setting the coffee mug down on the table before it touched his lips. “I’m supposed to meet Tony at 3 O’clock, I gotta dash.” He rushed, scrambling through his pockets for a ten and set it down on the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony tried to sit up but without the shock absorbers to neutralize the suit’s mass,  but his body couldn’t lift the extra hundred pounds of titanium alloy encasing his upper body. “Is there anything still working?” He asked, flopping back down on the ground.
Bruce let out a small laugh, rubbing at his tired eyes. “They’re soft and the purring soothes me.”
Thor was busy rummaging through his cupboards, no doubt in search of a brew worthy of a fearless Asgardian warrior, or whatever poetic nonsense he was usually blathering about.
Steve lowered his head. “I’m sorry to hear that.”
“Probably.” Tony said defiantly, flying over Doom and took out another half dozen androids with his repulsors. “But it’s not just the two of us, is it?”
Once Steve knew for sure that Tony was alive and breathing normally his concern quickly fades into outrage. “Are you nuts?” He hisses through gritted teeth. “You jumped out of a
Rumlow sneered at him, taking his silence as compliance. He reached behind Steve to unclip his harness from the suspension. The young blond could barely get his footing before the other man grabbed his hair and roughly pushed him down on his knees.
“Blackmail? Really? Oh come on Obie, you know me better than that.”
"He's cute. Though he looks a little too innocent for your tastes." Stane spoke up, wearing a smirk as if he knew that he'd already won.
Steve doesn’t like that their morning activities had to be rescheduled, but man, it’s to be upset when he got to stare at an ass like that.
my dick!"
He grabbed his friend by the shoulders and dragged him out of the building. Bucky struggled at first, but then reality seemed to slowly sink back in as he realized he’d just assaulted a man and he let himself be dragged out without a fight.
“You alright Cap?” He asked cautiously, feeling a heavy wall of tension suddenly being built up as Steve just stared at the screen, unblinking.
“Come
The sound of clapping snapped the blond out of his stupor, and Steve glanced up to see Tony applauding him.
Tony glanced down towards his feet and crossed his arms. “It’s…complicated. Sometimes she forgets, but sometimes she’ll remember. It’s like you said, she just…resets.”
“You know exactly why I’m here.”
Steve sets his own coffee down and walks around the desk until he's right beside the other man. Tony, confused, raises an eyebrow at him but doesn't ask and instead continues arguing over the phone.
The small boy made a happy sound and scurried over to grab another toy but wound up tripping over a big stuffed animal and tumbled, falling into one of the stacks of boxes and knocked them over.
“Oh.” Steve’s expression fell a bit, just the briefest flash of disappointment that was barely noticeable, like he’d been counting on Tony being free.
“I thought I’d never see you again.” He choked, his voice small and heavy on his tongue.
Hala tries to over power him, but Steve, the master tactician, knocks her legs out from under her, knocking her down and sending her weapon skittering across the square.
Peter gave an excited and unintelligible shout as he picked up a random thing off the floor and dropped it into the box. There was no method or organizing to his packing, he just picked up whatever was on the floor and plopped it into the crate but hey, the kid was 22 months old, Steve’s expectations weren’t that high.
-- don't call  the police.” He begged, words spilling from his lips faster than Tony could give a lecture on robotic engineering. “I know he shouldn't have hit you, but he only did it because he has this compulsive urge to protect me, especially when I don't need protecting. If he gets any notice of disorderly conduct they'll take away his veteran status and he’s already gone through so much, so please --"
Avengers Tower was a good 30 miles north east from this parking lot, and while he was sure that Steve wouldn’t actually leave him stranded with a busted suit, he wasn’t about to test that theory.
“You want to sleep with him!” She hissed under her breath.
“As delightful as coffee sounds, you’re very warm and I’m strictly opposed to letting you get out of this bed.” Tony mutters, trailing his lips from the base of Steve’s neck down to his shoulder blade as his hands move over Steve’s chest down to his abdomen.
Steve wouldn’t consider himself a sex fiend, or really that much of a Casanova for that matter, but he was a red blooded man so he knew his way around a dick, especially his own.
Startled at the sudden reality check the two heroes quickly withdrew away from each other at the voice, turning their heads to see Natasha straddling the hover bike. She stared at them in bemusement, but the smirk in her eyes was evident despite her stern expression.
“Tony?”
“No problem. Running a multi-billion dollar company is pretty time consuming.” He said, adding as Pepper arched an eyebrow. “Not that I would know considering you were practically running the business even before I signed it over.”
Their lips smacked together with enough force to bruise, much hotter than the first time. Tony’s tongue didn’t hesitate, playing Steve’s bewilderment to his advantage as he slipped the slick muscle passed the blond’s slightly parted lips, dragging it across the tops of Steve’s perfectly straight teeth before tasting the inside of Steve’s mouth, savouring the vague hint of sweetness on his tongue.
“If you don’t have any questions then I think we’re done here.” Tony dismissed him, returning to his work.
Tony wasn’t entirely sure why he’d said yes to hanging out. Steve had made countless offers when he first moved in, trying to worm his way onto the billionaire’s good side, but he’d given up after being shot down a dozen times.
Something in his voice must have snapped Bucky out of his stupor because Steve could see the fight slowly fade from his slate eyes. He gave a curt nod and didn’t bring it up again.
“This place is beautiful.” He gaped, wondering how he hadn’t been here before. The view of the distant city from this spot was breath taking. Steve could imagine spending hours here with his sketchbook, drawing the city scape.
One more box packed, just a few dozen more to go.
“The conqueror of giant lizard people lives!” Came a snort of laughter that belongs to agent Barton, who was sitting at the edge of the barstool, shoveling cereal into his mouth. “And here we thought you were going to stay in your hole and sulk all day.”
Steve stepped out of the shower and into the large, empty changing room, quickly dabbing most of the water off of his body before loosely tucking the towel around his waist. He reached into his duffle bag and grabbed his phone, idly scrolling through his recent notifications, slightly disappointed when there were no new messages. Tony was on a business trip to the studio's Japan branch at Fujikawa inc. over the last week touching base with the other company on some R&D so he hadn’t really seen or spoken to him in the last couple days.
“Call it a trust building exercise. Now can you get off me? Your knee is crushing my nuts.” He grunted.
He was being ridiculous. If he had any sense of self preservation then he should just turn off his phone and focus on something else, maybe go swim a couple laps in the pool to take his mind off things.
“Ready to watch the game?” He asked, dressed casually in a plain white tee with a quarter sleeve red plaid shirt thrown on top, a black ball cap, and a pair of red lensed sun glasses.
“No need to thank me, that’s how jobs work Steve. Besides, you earned every penny.”
Tony nodded his head. “Yeah, of course. Just let me know if you need anything.”
Peter had a lot of toys, something that was sort of inevitable with a wealthy billionaire father and half a dozen aunts and uncles who wanted to spoil the only baby on the team (Nat was surprisingly bad for that), but he’s pretty sure he would remember if someone gave him a Captain America bear.
Their trip up to Tony’s place was anything but graceful.
“We had a plan.”
“Yeah.” He whispered, tucking his phone between his cheek and shoulder so he could grab the bottle and keep stroking himself at the same time.
Steve watches him chug boiling hot coffee, both impressed and mildly perturbed before setting the empty cup down on the marble counter.
good sex. Maybe Hollywood had overdramatized the trope, or maybe the fact that he worked in the porn industry gave him a free pass to sleep with anyone he worked with, even his boss. Either way, Steve wasn’t complaining.
So yeah, Tony might be irrationally pointing the finger at Steve for his major daddy issues, but could anyone really blame him?
Over the next months they wound up spending a lot of time together, growing increasingly closer to one another until the days where Steve wouldn’t come down to visit him became the odd ones.
Tony had a lot if free money to burn, sure, and he made sure that Peggy Carter received the best care possible, but she was old and deteriorating and not even his money could fix that.
Of course just about everyone here only knew his name through his father, and for the most part they all had wonderful things to say, aside from the occasional man fussing about how Howard Stark would steal all the girls’ attention back in the day with his fancy flyin’ machines. It almost made him wish that he could have known the Howard Stark that so many people respected instead of the lowlife father who didn’t give a shit about his kid.
Porn was all about desire, Steve had to make the audience want him.
People outside the museum were screaming out on the streets of New York, running and cowering from what appeared to be a huge alien space craft hovering above the city's skyline spitting out tall, blue skinned humanoid creatures from its hull.
This chapter is long overdue, I am so sorry. I meant to post last week but I got a really bad headache and I don't really have much time to write during the week but hey, better late then never right? Hopefully the 8000 words of essentially pure smut will make up for the fact that I haven't posted in almost 4 months.
Panicking, Steve began to withdraw, but just as he was pulling away Tony seemed to finally snap out of his stupor and lunged forward, reaching out to grab a fist full of Steve’s shirt to pull him back in to the kiss.
Steve was sporting a similar look, wearing a blue plaid shirt with the first two buttons undone, a grey cap with the Dodgers logo on the front, and just a regular pair of large, black rimmed glasses.
He doesn’t have a suit to aid him, but his father already told him the suit doesn’t make the person. Peter would just have to be careful and rely on the bit of training he’s had over the past few weeks. The voice in the back of his head reminds him that a few weeks of training didn’t make him ready, but Peter tunes the voice out.
Peter nods and disappears down the stairs.
“Sure, kid.”
A knock on the door captures his attention and he calls out for them to enter. Pepper enters the office and Tony shoots her a bright smile, only for it to falter when she doesn’t return the gesture.
“Um.” Tony frowns as he studies his own drink, forgetting most of the ingredients he had put in. “I don’t know. It’s healthy so…”
“Fine,” Peter mutters and takes another stab at his chicken.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. “Couldn’t help it. How are you feeling?”
Morgan waits for the yelling and scolding to start when her parents rush into the room, but what greets her instead is a big hug from her papa.
Tony whines, the sound so foreign to his own ears. It wasn’t a noise an alpha usually produced; their growls and snarls was their signature sound. But Steve was doing something to him. It was like their roles had been switched and Tony was the one begging.
“You can stop blaming yourself,” Tony says for what feels like the millionth time since he’s had Jarvis awake.
And Steve does, not so much out of obedience, but because it’s
I think group therapy will be good for him. Then he can start healing and move forward 😊
“Sit down,” Natasha suggests, patting the empty chair beside her.
The silence between them seems to go on forever. Steve should say something, anything at this point. Hell he’d rather talk about the weather if it meant ending the torturous silence.
Steve shakes his head.
After Bruce gets the samples he needs, he deems them free to go and promises he’ll keep in touch. Steve doesn’t question the sample of blood he had to give, assuming it was all just part of the checkup. Tony is relieved when the omega doesn’t say anything about it.
If you haven't noticed I'm adding tags as I go lol. I keep getting ideas for this story so that's why new characters are popping up and tags are being added.
Sleep doesn’t visit him. Tony lies awake, staring at the ceiling above him, his thoughts running wild. All he can think about is Steve and the next few weeks. He didn’t know how long Steve was going to need. For all he knew it could take a week or a month or even longer. Tony couldn’t imagine Steve being gone for so long. But he reminds himself that it would be worth it. The old Steve would emerge and their little family would be happy again.
“I’ll spoil her.” Natasha enters the room and makes her way toward the kitchen to serve herself a plate.
“I’m not going to do that. Steve wouldn’t want that.”
Steve’s eyes snap up to Tony’s face at the order.
No more words are spoken after that. Being near the other is enough.
“I hope so.” Tony sighs and closes his eyes again. “I’m gonna take a nap. Feel free to join me.”
Pepper smiles softly and comes over to fix the tie again. “Just behave. Do it for Peter.”
Steve is thankful she’s here to help him place his son in the car seat. Tony had yet to emerge from the bathroom, leaving Steve to care for Peter when he needed a new diaper. While Steve changes Peter, Harley dozes off in his car seat.
Ned doesn’t appear convinced, not that Peter believed he would.
“They don’t love me.” Morgan sniffs and uses the sleeve of her sweater to wipe her nose. “All they care about is stupid Spider-Man and Harley.”
“Something…” Steve grunts again and spreads his legs wide. He bears down again. It feels right. He grips the band of his sweats with one hand and lowers them down.
“I know, I know. I’ll slow down.”
“I’m pregnant.”
Even if the pup didn’t belong to him he’d help Steve care for it. They weren’t mates, but things could change. Something was manifesting between them. Only time would tell.
Bucky lets out a sigh and says, “I know.”
Steve spins around just as Brock raises the baton to issue another hit, gripping the weapon in his hand and ripping it out of the alpha’s grasp. Steve pushes Brock into the wall and presses the baton against his throat. With the alpha unable to escape, Steve frees one hand and collides his fist with Brock's jaw. There’s a mixture of surprise and fear written on Brock’s face when Steve raises his hand to strike again. Steve is only able to catch a glimpse of the alpha’s expression before it’s fading away and a smirk is taking its place.
“He’s good.” Tony turns toward his son, relieved to find him still asleep. “He’s sleeping right now.”
I’ll have the next chapter up as soon as I can. Maybe it can be a time skip or something, I don’t know. 🤷♀️
“Yeah? How much more?” Tony asks, pulling Steve closer and rubbing his hand up and down Steve’s arm.
Tony steals another glance at his son. The sad expression was gone, and in its place a determined one has appeared. Damn. He was like Steve. Stubborn as hell.
Bucky nods and lowers himself down in the chair he’s been occupying since Steve was taken to the room. He had no idea how long it was going to take until his nephew arrived, but he’d stay with Steve through every second of it.
All he wants to do is curl up beside his husband and hug him close, but he’s reminded of the bathroom he needs to clean.
“Yes,” Peter can’t help but roll his eyes. “I’m fine. I’ve felt worse.”
“Not ignoring you. I’m just...ordering a drink," Tony finally replies.
Oof poor Steve 😞 He needs a lot of help and of course some TLC. He’s suffered so much 😭 Don’t worry he’ll get the happy ending he deserves!
“I’m sorry!” Peter cries out, tears streaming down his face. “I’m so sorry! It was just a stupid party at Liz’s house and I-”
“We didn’t even get you anything.”
It’s a boy.
They share one last look, then Steve is turning and leaving. Tony watches as he disappears up the stairs. A door slams, followed by Morgan’s cries.
“It seems you don’t know anything.”
“You don’t have to explain. I’m sure I’ve heard it before.”
“Who is she?” Tony asks again.
“Just tell everyone you gained weight. It’s not a total lie. Oh but wait…what happens if you go into labor in class?”
They loved each other. And that was enough.
“No,” Bucky shakes his head. “I know he carried it with him wherever he went but we felt you should have it. He’d want you to.”
He’s not sure how long he stays in that spot, and it’s not until he hears the elevator does he snap his head up in its direction. The doors open and a familiar face greets him. He didn’t expect Peter to be here and he wonders if Natasha had contacted him. Or maybe it was FRIDAY. She knew how much Peter meant to him.
Steve blinked, his eyes glossy. That sounded like...Tony.
Steve stared at him, stunned. Tony’s words cut through him like a knife, leaving a gaping wound in his chest. For a moment he couldn’t even register the words that had come out of the other man’s mouth, wondering if he’d missed something.
“Right, okay. Gotcha.” Tony grunted, ears wringing.
“One of our housekeepers – Sonia I think? Samantha? Something with an ‘S’. Anyway, this girl was twice my age, but damn, was she smoking hot. Tiny waist, round ass, perky – sorry, right. Details.” He muttered with an impish smirk when Steve cleared his throat. “Anyway, you get my point. I knew she was flirting from the moment she started working. She crept into my room one night, and bam. The beginning of history.”
He hadn’t been to this place in a while, but in his younger days, once he could actually drive, he used to come here all the time. On most occasions he wouldn’t be alone, often bringing the women that he was trying to get lucky with here to make out with in the backseat of his car.
“Ah…Ah, fuck….” He moans, head lolling back against the edge of the desk as Tony sucks and rolls the small, perky nub between his teeth. His nipples are sensitive, and Tony is absolutely going to town on them. His dick is already drooling from the stimulation, leaving glossy trails over his stomach. It’s almost unbearable how turned on he is, he needs
“Steve?”
Steve forces Tony to take a break from working. Tony decides to let go of the past and get a fresh start.
“Man of Iron.” She spoke, her loud voice echoing through the room. “My people have heard great tales of your triumph and aptitude.” Her gaze swept over Tony, upper lip curling in distaste. “I am disappointed to see that the myths do not uphold.”
“You good to keep going?”
“I'll leave you to it then.” He says, slipping into his shirt and quickly does up the buttons, making a mental note to sew back the ones that Tony popped off.
Before Tony could finish his threat, Bucky reared back his metal arm and swung, punching Tony square in the jaw.  Tony reeled back from the force of it, stumbling back and clutching at his face.
Less than a minute later, pieces of the Iron Man suit were flying towards them, molding seamlessly around Tony’s frame. So that’s what he’d been working on last night. Tony’s helm clicked into place over his face, the eyes lighting up in an electric blue.
“Friends go to lunch together.” Steve remarked with a roll of his shoulders.
Bucky obviously didn’t see it that way.
“Who says I don’t have my armor.” Tony countered, pressing another sequence of buttons into his wristwatch.
He wasn’t exaggerating, at least not in his eyes. Tony was a beautiful man. Dark and handsome, perfectly groomed and radiating a heavy scent that made him feel dizzy with arousal. It was like his body pumped out pure sex pheromones out of his pores. Steve never felt so turned on by another person in his life but just kissing Tony was enough to make him painfully hard.
“I know it’s probably not what you’re used to, but it’s nice.” He promised, resting his elbows on the table top
Bruce turned to Tony, obviously seeking his input. “What do you think?”
This could be awkward.
The elevator doors open and Steve immediately hears Tony arguing on the phone with someone over the phone.
As soon as he jumped, Tony felt a rush of cold air kiss his face as he begun falling towards the ground.
“Huh?”
He threw his shield with a heavy grunt, watching it ricochet off of a lamp post and then bounce through the crowd of robots like a life sized game of ping pong, exploding them on impact. He caught the shield when it bounced back towards him, trying to search the crowd for a week point.
This is his first threesome.
“Tony…”
Steve continued to go to the rehab centre from time to time, so Tony made sure to slip the hospital a couple extra thousand dollars in donations so that Steve could avoid any visitation problems since he wasn’t next of kin.
Eventually Fury must have gotten sick of talking, or maybe he’d caught on that none of them were really paying attention because he cut the meeting short, dismissing the team.
Just when he started to think it couldn’t feel any better than this Tony wrapped his fingers around his dick, stroking him firmly while his tongue continued to flick and curl against his hole.
The elevator dinged as it opened up, and Tony barely managed to get a few steps into his office before a familiar voice spoke up.
Tony reached up to cup his face, and Steve leaned into his hand, finding comfort in the warm touch. It didn’t last long, and Steve forced himself not to chase Tony’s hand as he pulled away, watching the brunet’s back as he walked out of the production room.
“Is there anything else you need me for?” Steve asked his boss.
Tony was frozen in shock for less than a second before he was reciprocating, melting into the embrace almost immediately. It was sweet and tender, yet at the same time the kiss was hot and needy, like a Hoover dam of desire being unleashed all at once. Tony always thought that people who said kissing the right person made them see fireworks were romanticized lunatics that mystified simple human attraction, but in this moment, he could almost swear he felt a spark.
Bucky didn't look totally convinced, but he didn’t press the issue either, so Steve considered his fib a moderate success.
” Jarvis spoke through the speakers.
The doors opened on their own, announcing his presence. The office was huge with floor to ceiling windows that only made the space look even bigger. The furniture was minimal and modern, only making the space feel more expensive. There was a glass top desk in the center of the room and a man sitting behind it, scribbling what looked like product designs on the mess of papers strewn atop the desk in front of him.
He glanced down at their son, who’s eyes where fixed on his father, wide circles of pure adoration. He smiled, looking back down at the toy in his hand and gave the bear a squeeze, remembering all the lonely days and nights where this little guy was there to keep him company.
Eventually his phone beeped again, and Steve read the text hungrily.
Tony shot a look at his hat and raised an eyebrow. “You do know that the Dodgers play for Los Angeles now, right? Not Brooklyn.”
“It is a nice spot.” Tony agreed and walked over to hop onto the hood of his car, sprawling out along the elongated front of his cherry red Corvette.
There was another stretch of silence as Steve shifted from foot to foot, seeming to gather his wits.
Steve winces at the resonating hurt in Bucky’s tone, feeling a wave of guilt. He felt awful for lying to his best friend, but Bucky would have never been okay with him doing this sort of thing. He was overprotective and stubborn, always thinking that he had to be the one making the hard decisions. It had been that way since they were kids, and for once Steve wanted to be the one taking care of him.
“Steve usually makes you a plate, but most of the time you don’t come out of your hole until way past noon so you never notice.” Came Natasha’s sneaky reply, green eyes shining at him disapprovingly.
Tony smirks at him, reaching down to grab Steve’s hand and press it against his cock.
“I bet it does,” Tony grunted. “Bring a hand up to your chest.” He added, his tone more demanding than suggestive, not that Steve really cared.
Natasha said, touching her fingertips to Steve’s abdomen, black fingernails dragging against the vibrant red, leaving pale scratched in their wake.
Steve stopped to think about it, glancing down at his duffel bag. Lube never used to be a necessity in his everyday life, but it was useful to keep some on hand nowadays so he could slick himself up before a shoot.
Steve offered a hesitant smile, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. “If it’s alright I think I’ll stay here a bit longer. See if I can make any progress with her.”
“I mean, I guess there's no harm in having a contract drawn up so you can have a look.” He mumbles.
Came the distorted, scratchy reply, only enforcing the fact that his suit was now pretty much reduced to a useless pile of scrap metal.
Steve scratched the back of his neck, giving an embarrassed laugh. “Well, that’s good to hear, right?”
Steve grunts in pain, falling to his knees as he tries to take out the spear.
“Buck!” Steve shouted, grabbing at his friend’s shoulder to hold him back from launching another attack while Pepper hurried over to help Tony.
punch the closest thing within reach.
Steve had learned to take Tony’s sarcasm with a grain of salt so just laughed and smiled back at him, leading the shorter man out of the lab.
Now it was Steve’s turn to freeze up, but he recovered from it much faster than Tony had. Steve felt the scratch of Tony’s perfectly primped goatee against his chin, sending tiny rivulets of pleasure running through his brain every time the short, prickly hairs tickled his skin. Their mouths slotted together for what felt like a solid few minutes until he felt Tony finally (regrettably) retreated. The air between them was hot and heavy, and Steve’s lips were left red and tingling from the kiss.
“Doctor Banner, if the two of you made plans first its fine, I wouldn’t want to impose on you.”
The energy blast recoiled off of Doom’s electro-magnetic shields and was redirected right back at him, hitting him right in the chest.
“You’re sure you’re okay?” Tony asked again.
Steve wiped his hand on the previously discarded that still desperately clung to the bench so he could hold his phone in his hand again without feeling too gross about it.
Steve glanced at him, head slightly tilted to the side and his grip on the door handle loosening as he settled back in his seat.
“That’s the thing I don’t remember.”
“Where were you?” Sam asks. “It’s past six. Your food is already cold.”
When he has her calm and well on her way to sleep, he shuts the door halfway and moves on toward the other bedroom. Steve isn’t in sight, but the sounds coming from the closet indicate where he’s at. Steve emerges from the closet, a small pile of clothes gathered in his arms. Then Tony notices the bag on the bed.
It’s a lie.
Steve sighs again. “I do. I’m just...I don’t know. We’re already bonded. Isn’t that enough?”
“Oh.” Ned frowns.
“It’s not!” Steve snaps and with a huff and he joins Tony on the bed. “I don’t know what we’re doing wrong. I just can’t get pregnant. I was sure this was it.”
Peter finishes up his water and sets the empty bottle on the countertop. He shrugs. “Fine.”
“You’re doing great. You’re so good with all of them. I’m sorry four pups are...unexpected. I know we had only planned the one but...I wouldn’t change anything. You’re perfect for me, for them. I don’t know what we’d do without you.”
“Yeah?”
“You wanna talk about it?” Natasha asks while they strap themselves in their seats and prepare for take off.
“No one said it was. You’re doing fine. It’ll just take time.”
“So Steve finally agreed to marriage?” Happy asks.
“You feel so good, Omega,” Tony praises, pulling back slightly before sliding back in. He glances down, watching himself fuck his cock in and out of the omega’s stretched and dripping hole. “So fucking good.”
Sam nods in understanding and pulls his husband close. “I know,” he whispers and presses a gentle kiss to the side of Bucky’s head.
Tony gives in.
“Cat actually.”
Tony sighs. “I do. I know deep down you’d never hurt Morgan but...honey, you scared me. I didn’t know what else to do. I had to protect her.”
“No. Hell no. I’m better off here and he’s-”
“I’ll check on him,” Tony offers. “Let’s clean you up first okay?”
He doesn’t mean to hurt the ones that he loves. That’s the last thing Steve ever wanted to do. His family and friends always came first. They were the ones that always mattered more than himself.
This time Tony releases a small sob and he can’t contain his tears anymore. It’s not an act anymore. He’s not putting on a performance for his husband or friends. The guilt has finally become too much.
I know a lot of you guys are disappointed in Tony( me included) but I don’t hate him. I’m not against him. He’s one of my favorite characters. As I writer I wanted to challenge myself and write Stony a little different. They’re not always going to get a happy ending unfortunately.
Steve nods and sniffs. He quickly wipes away the tears that roll down his face. One hand falls to his belly and he releases a choked sob.
Steve turns in Tony’s arms until they’re facing each other. “What deal?”
Tony frowns, wracking his brain for the words Steve regrets saying. He comes back empty handed. “Wait. What did you say that-”
The day they learned they were having a boy, Tony immediately began preparations for the nursery. It was both amusing and exciting to see his boyfriend obsess over their son. There was no doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony would be a great father. He had seen how he was with Dodger, and his relationship with their son was going to be full of nothing but love.
“Hon, they’re fine. We’re just down the hall,” Tony assures and places a kiss to the top of his son’s heads. James smiles and snuggles under the warm blanket.
“You think? Did you even enjoy the event?”
“Sweetheart, you don’t have to ask. Do whatever you want.”
A beat and then.
“Kids? As in more than one?”
“What? Lock yourself away? He needs you.”
“I will. But first...pizza?”
Tony and Steve share a look. Tony shrugs and takes a sip from his mug. “They’re not wrong,” he says.
Tony takes a moment to compose himself before picking up his tools and working again.
“What did happen back there?” Pepper narrows her eyes at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony places a hand over the spot where their newest family member was growing, already picturing Dodger meeting them and protecting them like he did with Peter.
“I mean the pregnancy. I read in the book that dad’s can experience the same thing. That’s probably what it is.”
“This is it. We’re finally going to meet him and he’s going to be this tiny, delicate little thing and I....I don’t want to mess him up. What if I drop him? Or forget to pick him up from school?”
“You’re pregnant,” Happy says with a nonchalant shrug. He reaches out and Steve hands him the plate
“Go for it. It’s going to be your room,” Tony says and he rises to his feet, stretching his arms over his head until his shoulders pop. “I have one more thing to show you.”
“Eh.” Tony gives a small shrug and downs the drink. He misses the way Alexander eyes the now empty glass.
A simple pumpkin and scarecrow would suffice in his opinion; those were the symbols of Fall. What he didn’t understand was why Tony had to decorate their home from top to bottom in orange and black colors and skeletons and spiders. He wasn’t surprised anymore to find their home looking like Halloween had thrown up in every room. Being married for nearly 7 years made him practically immune.
“You’re pregnant, Tony.”
Tony is in the nursery, sitting on the floor beside their daughter while she coos happily in her baby swing. Tony is smiling, just like he has been since the day he learned he was going to be a father.
“Trust me, kid you did. He needed this.”
“Oh...sorry.”
“Please come back,” he finds himself muttering those same three words. “Please.”
“You didn’t have to. I know how you feel about me. We don’t get along and it makes working and living here difficult, I know.”
“I need to keep you and the baby safe. I have to at all costs,” Steve says.
It was something he had wanted at one point. A family; stability; the simple life. He should be excited about the life he was carrying. But it was difficult to find joy in the situation when the father wasn’t present.
“Yes! Fuck, I need you to stop. I’m gonna cum already.”
Peter giggles. “Sorry. But you know it’s true.”
Steve appears hesitant at first, then he’s giving in and taking the opportunity to sleep for a while. He warms the bottle and gives it to Tony, then he disappears to the bedroom.
“Oh.” Natasha’s brows furrow slightly and she glances at the targets she had been shooting. “I guess I lost track of time. How was school?” She’s back to staring at him and Peter can’t help but shift under her gaze.
Of course the first thing they do is scold him for being in the rain. He ignores the lecture and rushes to hug them both.
“Dad!”
Steve sighs again and hangs his head. “You don’t feel the same and-”
“He can’t help you,” the alpha above him says and he forces Steve to look at him again. “I’m your alpha. I know you want this, want me.”
It’s surreal being on the same mission as the Avengers. The closest Peter’s ever gotten was when he’d eavesdrop from the ceiling during a brief. His father would be furious if he could see his son now, walking into a secret base and ready to fight the bad guys.
Sam shakes his head and turns away, immediately pressing his ear to his comm and speaking. “Hey, Cap, we have a situation.”
“I’m never giving up on you.”
“What?” Tony asks, brows furrowed in confusion. He wonders what he did this time. It’s then he realizes the wet stains along the front of Steve’s t-shirt. “Are you leaking?”
“You’re lucky you didn’t see them die.”
“What if I’m broken? What if I can’t be fixed.”
Steve storms out of the lab. Tony watches as he goes, cursing to himself for upsetting now two of his family members. He returns back to his work, needing to think and process the situation.
“That’s not me-”
“Two,” Clint smiles, “ a girl and boy.”
“Okay. Take care, Tony.”
It was beginning to look like he would be raising this child all on his own. He hadn’t broken the news to Tony yet. Being removed from assignments gave him extra time during his day, and none of it goes to calling up Tony and telling him about the baby.
He tries to forget about Tony during the visit with the doctor, but forgetting about Tony is harder than Steve ever thought it would be. It’s not until the doctor begins the ultrasound does Steve devote his full attention to the monitor.
Natasha grins, the smile making Tony’s stomach twist into knots. “You should be.”
Tony ignores the question, his mind too occupied on the new idea that’s formed. He had been sitting on the project for a while; his motivation had disappeared since his life turned upside down. But now it was coming back and he had to act quickly.
Tony sighs heavily. “I do…”
“Steve, are you okay?”
“I’m fine Tony, I promise.” He said gently, soothing his rubbed-raw wrists. He was a little shaken up from the situation, but Steve knew that it wouldn’t last.
” Rumlow screeched, ripping Steve off of his dick.
No turning back now.
As they enjoyed their coffee, Tony couldn’t help but notice a dark skinned beauty with raven hair and a heart shaped face a few tables down, looking their way every so often and whispering to her blond friend. He nudged Steve’s foot under the table and nodded his head towards her. “I think that one likes you.”
“Can we try this again?”
He vaguely wonders who the hell would be calling Tony this early when fingers grasp at his chin, pulling his attention back to searing brown eyes.
The blond had a shocked look on his face, eyes wide and staring at the two men sharing a tender moment on the screen. Steve gaze was locked onto the television screen as the two men were smooching, before the image started flipping across the crowds again.
Enjoy!
“True.” The CEO concurred. “But that’s no reason for misconduct. What’s got your britches in a knot this time, Captain Ahab?”
Steve's brain was a bit fuzzy. He remembered going to the MOMA, an alien invasion, getting stabbed by some magic floating spear and Tony being taken away.
“You’re sure that’s not jet fuel?” He wheezed, handing the flask back to Tony as he felt the booze burning a hole in his stomach lining.
He rolls his hips, teasing Tony’s cock for a few moments, earning some very pleasant gasps out of the billionaire to fuel his efforts.
The slight change of angle made the toy pop out, nudging against his tight sack and rubbing furiously at the spot just below his balls. Steve’s eyes shot open, arms and thighs flexing as he pulled on the leather and chains. The shock of pleasure was just enough to finally tip him over the edge, heavy streams of white shooting out all over his chest and stomach.
“Then just focus on me.” Tony says in a low murmur, resting his hand on Steve’s knee.
It was dumb, right? Who cares if they’d slept together – Tony was his boss, not his boyfriend.  Even if they did have the occasional (totally consensual and highly anticipated) sexual encounter it’s not like Tony had any reason to miss him when he wasn’t there. They weren't in a relationship or anything, they weren't even really friends. He had no reason to barge in on Tony’s busy schedule and derail him just because he felt a little lonely.
It was a low blow that stung at first, but honestly, turning into the Hulk put a great deal of strain on his body, so he wasn’t too bummed out about sitting this one out.
Steve couldn’t help the giddy smile that spread across his face. “Can’t wait.”
“No playing bud, we're putting toys
“So uh…does this mean I’m in, Mr. Stark?”
“It’s a celebration. You made it into the front page of the Stark Studios web page for top 5 favorite porn stars.” Tony explained to him, handing him a flute of bubbly clear liquid that looked like champagne. “I know, the décor is a little extra. You can blame Darcy for that.”
Tony smiled in the friendly way people did when they saw something heartwarming, turning his head to the side when he caught Steve’s face in the corner of his eye.
“We'll catch up later, he hates it when I’m late – don’t say anything.” Steve added just as Sam opened his mouth to comment on that.
The steady stream of warm water running down his face was a comfort Steve would never take for granted ever again. The hot water in his apartment was still busted, and Phil didn’t seem to have any clue when somebody would be in to fix it. Luckily he had taken full liberty of the studio's lavish shower facilities instead. It was more convenient anyway, since he liked using the onsite gyms and boxing ring.
The title of the file piqued the billionaire’s interest. He recognized ‘The Captain' as the stage name they’d given to Steve. Stark Studios never used an actor's real name for legal and privacy reasons, and the new guy had earned that little moniker from the upright, militaristic attitude that seemed to radiate off of him. Besides, it had a nice ring to it – provocative, a little dangerous, and just slightly erotic. It seemed to suit Steve Rogers perfectly.
Tony didn’t pull away until he’d finished shaking through his orgasm, a stupidly proud grin plastered all over his face as he looked down at the spent and loose body beneath him.
Tony was quiet for a few beats, giving Steve a moment with his thoughts. He saw the clench of his jaw and his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed hard before replying in an almost broken voice. “Yeah, I miss her. Of course I miss her. She’s the only gal I think I ever really loved." He sighed with a forlorn shake of his head.
“Cut!” Fury shouted, and Steve thought that the man might actually explode in rage. “Everybody, take five. And somebody find Rogers some god damn talent.”
Part of him is relieved Tony doesn’t want to kick him out of his bed, and the other part is screaming at him that this probably isn’t a good idea.
Tony winced as debris flew by his head, the sharp edges just barely grazing his face. “Not yet.”
“Tony, I’m sorry. I really am.”
“That’s very good to hear.” She nodded, her gaze returning to settle on his face. “I just stopped by to say that Tony would like to see you in the conference room.”
“First day jitters, apple pie?” Tony teased, seeming to take enjoyment in playing up Steve's devoutly American persona.
Steve chose to ignore the phrasing and gave a shrug of his shoulders. “Yeah, why not.”
“Yeah, I’m good. You can go back to whatever you were doing with your pants down.” Bucky teased, nodding to his unbuttoned jeans which made Steve’s face go slightly red.
Steve smiled sleepily, pressing back against the warm body. All this sex the last few months had been great, but it wasn’t exactly customary for actors to cuddle in the afterglow and Steve was an affectionate creature by design, so it was nice to finally some snuggling.
Steve called him a cab and waited with him. They didn’t say a word the entire time, but he knew that this was far from over. When the car pulled up, Bucky tried weakly to get Steve to come back with him, even though he knew Steve had to try and fix the damage he’d caused. He promised that he wouldn’t take long and be back by the end of the night. Steve didn’t want to leave Bucky so soon after an episode, but he had things he needed to deal with firsthand.
He took a moment to think it over. He knows how this works. People don’t want the true, boring answers, they want hot, artificial answers to fuel their fantasies and push them over the edge.
“How bout’ you show us exactly how you like to be touched?" Mr. Stark replies, sending a shiver rolling down his spine.
One of the catches about his super serum infused body was that it required a super high intake of protein to keep him from getting lethargic. Lucky for him that Tony’s poor dietary habits meant that there were plenty of protein powders and vitamin supplements stocked in the kitchen. Not to mention eggs. It was hard to beat the pure protein that was packed into the small, oval packages.
Tony shrugged his shoulders and grabbed for the menu, screening through its contents. “Honestly, neither am I. But my investment brokers love to be waited on.” He muttered, reading through the lunch options.
After he finished his snack, Steve somehow convinced Tony to lay down on the couch, and the brunet fell asleep almost the instant his head hit the pillow.
Steve felt a hot wave of embarrassment wash over him.
Tony was poking at some trendy, Vegan dish that was all the rage on Instagram as Pepper typed away on her phone, probably answering a dozen emails in the span of a minute.
Tony extended his arm, motioning for Steve to step forward. “Lead the way.”
“Okay, so I'm Tony Stark, owner of this lavish place. Now that we've got the formalities out of the way strip and lie back.” Mr. Stark said like this was some routine business, which to him it probably was, as he fiddled with the camera settings.
“Hey, hey! It's fine Darcy, I know him.” He told her. She gave him an incredulous expression and rolled her eyes.
Steve wanted to argue – to tell Tony that he was wrong, that he could do this, that he
They made it to the Stadium with a few minutes to spare before the game started, shimmying their way into their seats. Steve was a bit surprised that Tony didn’t have his own specially reserved viewing box, considering how the man tended to flaunt his money, but he sort of liked how they were sitting among the regular folk, nestled comfortably in some prime but standard middle row seats. It reminded him of when he used to go to games with Bucky.
Tony doesn’t waste any time, starting up a brutal rhythm as soon as he’s fully sheathed inside. Steve doesn’t mind punishing pace-- he’s been so on edge all day, he needs it hard and fast.
There was a little awkward moment of silence as the two superheroes twiddled their thumbs, neither one really knowing how to strike up a conversation with the other.
That being said, Steve was an interesting new addition to their cast and the brunet was especially curious about this one.
As the party was ending Steve, always the gentleman, offered to stay and help clean up, so by default Tony got roped into helping too. Tony haled a couple of folding chairs towards the storage shed that was attached to the side of the church while Steve carried a whole table by himself. With one hand.
“God, your ass looks fantastic in those jeans.”
Natasha smiled back at him, which served as enough of an answer to that rhetorical question. “I know you and Stark have your differences, but you can’t get into a shouting match after every mission.”
Steve noticed him lounging on top of the sport’s car and decided to join in, hoisting his body up carefully to avoid putting a dent in the billionaire’s expensive ride. The last thing they needed to ruin the moment was Steve accidentally crush Tony’s beautiful car. Even though Tony was practically made of money and could easily purchase another car without so much as a dent to his net worth, Steve doubted he’d be happy about it.
Currently there was a total of 27 people watching him get himself off, only half of which had actually given him any sort of donation. A pretty dry night by his regular standards and not the greatest crowd, but if he played his cards right he might be able to scrounge up enough donations to make his half of the rent that he was already 2 days late on.
“Then do it already.” Steve grinds out.
“I need you to drop what you’re doing right now and meet me at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital.”
Steve couldn’t have imagined a place like this back in his day, but in the modern world every establishment seemed to have their own little gimmicks.
Steve nodded, glancing up to the third-floor window. The lights were off, but there was bright, blue flashing light seeping out of the tiny window. No doubt Bucky had fallen asleep in front of the TV again. His hand was poised on the handle, gripping it but making no effort to push the door open. The evening had been nice. Really nice. He didn’t really want it to end just yet.
He'd just let a man watch and film him masturbate, it’s not like he had much shame left anyway.
It doesn’t take long after that. Steve feels the first shot of cum hit the side of his cheek, prepared for it but still taken by surprise as it starts dripping down the side of his face. He opens his mouth, tongue lolling out to catch any stray spurts as his face is painted by streaks of translucent white.
Steve doesn’t flinch, standing his ground. “If you don’t want to work with me then just say it.” He says coolly, wondering what the hell this guy’s problem was.
Steve doesn’t falter, hands diverging north to undo Tony’s tie and loosens it around his neck. He looks handsome all dolled up in a suit, but Steve thinks he looks even better disheveled like this. He smooths his hands down Tony’s chest and over the flat of his stomach, hooking his fingers through Tony’s belt loops and yanks him in close.
Steve had gone out for his morning run, showered, and dressed himself in clothes that weren’t completely drenched in sweat. Now, he was just sitting on the sectional, legs stretched out along the length of one of the cushions, sketchpad balanced on his lap as he dragged the charcoal across the paper.
Thor -- the blond hunk of pure, solid muscle who is currently fucking his mouth, is massive in every sense of the word. His biceps, his pecs, his cock. Steve chokes as the blond reaches up to grab a fistful of his hair, pulling him down further on his cock until the tip is nudging against the back of his throat.
Face to face meetings had been pretty sparse since their breakup, and most of the time it was to deal with business matters and investors and all that deal.
I have not uploaded in almost 2 years. I am so sorry if you've been looking forward to an update, I just couldnt get the chapter to fit together so I got frustrated and abandoned it for a while. I always reach a point where I feel like no one wants to read my fic and I get stumped, so if you want me to finish this comments and kudos are definitely appreciated.
"I'm heading back to New York tonight, we should do something." Tony said, breaking the silence.
Tony savoured the smooth taste of the amber liquid on his tongue, the rich taste of spices coating his whole mouth and making it tingle pleasantly. He took another hefty sip and set the glass down. “I’ve done worse.”
was.” He spoke of the title with a sneer. “And then when we first met in person, I saw you and I thought ‘this is the guy my dad talked about so much?
He half expected to be welcomed by some grungy space decorated with all sorts of sex memorabilia, but the lobby to his surprise was decorated pretty modestly.
Steve remembered that painful time like it was yesterday. Struggling to pay his moms medical and funeral bills as a penniless art student. He'd be out on the street if Bucky hadn't taken all those extra shifts down at the docks and pawned his dad's old car. This was absolutely the least he could do for his friend. They looked out for each other because who the hell else would? Bucky was family to him, and he would do absolutely anything to take care of him.
It should be weird, maybe even off putting, stroking himself in front of someone else – Steve had never really gotten into the kinky stuff with his sexual partners – but something about being under Mr. Stark's scrutiny was kind of turning him on.
The machine continued thrusting against his inner thigh throughout his orgasm before slowly coming to a complete halt, finally allowing Steve to catch his breath in the aftermath.
Tony reaches over to grab the Starbucks cup, sinking back in his chair. “Part of it, yeah.” He sighs, rubbing his brow. “I was talking to Bruce, he’s the studio’s production manager. One of my actors just quit on me and I have a deadline coming up.” He explained, taking a hefty gulp of coffee.  “I tried negotiating an extension, but Bruce says it's impossible given the time frame.”
“Those two men. They were kissing.” He stated bluntly, his face stoic, which was only fueling Tony’s apparent discomfort.
Woopsie cliffhanger. This chapter has been about 60% done for the last year and half, I've just kind of been too busy/lazy to update. I was kinda gonna let it die but every time I got a comment about how people were upset that this hasn't been updated for a year I felt really bad so I spent the last week forcing myself to finish it. Turns out guilt tripping works! There is one more chapter left to this story and I will TRY not to go a whole other year between updates so feel free to continue bullying me until I post.
“What are you talking about? I have an extensive and impressive art collection, of course I love art.” Tony defended.
“Speaking of maintenance, we cover any and all expenses for personal grooming -- Haircuts, tanning, Brazilian wax….whatever you need. We're invested in giving our viewers the experience they pay for, and we try to make things eady for our stars..” She kept on, eventually coming to a halt just outside of an elevator and turning on her heels to face him.
Steve narrowly rolled his eyes at the slander. Of course, blame the newbie.
“Oh yeah?” Tony edged on with a devilish smirk, clear, unadulterated interest on his face.
“So am I.”
Steve looked like an entire truck-full of cement had been raised off of his shoulder. “I promise, I’lI make it up to you. I'll get him to apologize, and I’ll make sure he doesn’t just barge in here again.”
“What’s all this for?” He asked, taking a step towards the table. He noticed a tall, chocolate cake with ‘Rising to the top!’ written in thick, bright pink icing, the outline of a half-erect penis drawn crookedly next to the text with globs of white frosting shooting out of the tip. Very classy.
Apparently it meant big money.
Tony sighed, his eyes softening as he watched Steve visibly break down in front of him. He doesn’t mean to be cruel, but it’s the only way he can think of to make Steve run away from this place and never come back,
Tony stared at the title with curiosity, absently rapping the ball end of his pen against the glass-top desk. He loved producing porn, and as much as he prided himself in the content he provided for the public he usually had Pepper, or one of his other assistants approve the footage. Working in the porn industry, Tony saw other peoples dicks more often than he saw he his own. Not that he was really complaining, as far as jobs went he had a great one, but they uploaded dozens of videos every week, it’s not like he could personally view and critique each one of them. He was a busy man.
“The film will still need to be edited, but I guess for a first shoot it wasn’t total bullshit.” Fury scoffed.
Steve savoured her wise words, wondering how he was going to get Tony to see the man behind the star spangled suit.
Despite the last few months of obscenities, Steve still found himself blushing at the crassness of Tony’s words.
Steve sits back on his heels, tongue poking out to catch the bit of come he’d wiped off with his thumb. “Thought I'd swing by and settle my debt.”
The businessman got up to pour himself a glass, giving Steve the opportunity to really get a look at him. He half-expected the CEO of a wealthy adult film corporation to be some shifty, overweight lech but he was surprised to see the opposite. Mr. Stark was not old, but definitely aged, Steve could tell by the almost invisible silver hairs that framed his hairline. Taking a closer look, Mr. Stark was actually quite handsome, dressed to the nines in a well fitted and expensive looking three piece suit, his facial hair perfectly trimmed and the faint waft of cologne radiation off of him.
It didn’t stop him from asking though.
When lunchtime came around, he tore himself away from his work and went off to take a shower, scrubbing the remnants of last night’s motor oil off of his body.
“It's not necessary because you don't work for me anymore.”
He always went on about how you were the greatest thing the earth had ever seen, how you would win the war, and you turned out to be so...” He trailed off, shaking his head and making a waving gesture with his hand.
Tony reached into the inner pocket of his jacket, pulling out a small metal container. He unscrewed the cap and brought the canister to his lips, taking a long swig before extending it towards the blond. “Want some?”
“Well this is…quaint.” He murmured, struggling to find the least offensive way to describe Steve’s favorite diner as he fiddled with the tacky red and white checkered table cloth.
Surprisingly, the first one to give into this insane plan was Banner of all people. He’d mentioned something about not being able to escape the S.H.I.E.L.D’s watchdogs no matter how hard he tried, so he might as well learn to live among them. Honestly, Tony just thought that he missed social interaction. Natasha agreed to join the team, saying that – her words exactly, ‘it’ll be easier to babysit you morons if we’re living under the same roof’. Tony didn’t know the spy very well, but he figured that was code for ‘easier to monitor this reckless band of destructive, testosterone driven maniacs for S.H.I.E.L.D’. Once The Widow was in, it didn’t take much convincing for her irritating other half to jump on the bandwagon. Even Thor stuck around, though he sometimes disappeared to Asgard for whatever Demi-godly duties he was needed for. Tony still had no idea how he so effortlessly crossed dimensions the way someone would walk from one room into another room. The rational genius called it witchcraft, just so that he didn’t have to admit to not knowing the science behind it.
