Dean settled into the driver's seat of the impala, swallowing down the lump that formed in his throat once the silence settled. He watched students leaving the school, getting in their cars, walking down the street, his eyes scanning every inch of the lot. He leaned over the center console, using his key to unlock the glove compartment. A burner phone sat inside, under a mess of papers, with only one message on it. The same message that he's been sent for the past three days.
"God, it's really impressive how much one person can be stabbed. Look at that," Meg dipped her head low to examine his stomach, running her fingers between the maze of stab wounds. Dean groaned out in pain, nausea clawing at his throat. She dipped her finger into one of them and he screamed, trying to pull away from her hands as she giggled.
"Yes," he whispered, curling his fingers into the pillow.
"Mm, I hope so, a full 24 hours away from my devastatingly handsome and still incredibly flexible husband?" Dean leaned in close, his lips ghosting over Cas'. "Unfathomable," he whispered with a smile. Cas hummed, leaning in the rest of the way, pressing his mouth firmly against his husbands. He tightened his grip in the mans hair, savoring the taste of him.
"Is Castiel dead?" He asked, squeezing his eyes shut. The sigh that Ash released was nearly world shattering.
"Charlie it's-"
Dean stared at Castiel long enough for the silence to turn awkward. He cleared his throat when he realized everyone was staring at him.
"No," he mumbled as he kicked his shoes off. He felt boneless, like all of the anxiety has been pulled from his body, leaving him exhausted and heavy in the best way.
Dean had a brief wave of fear that Castiel was going to be all bark and no bite, so to speak, but it was quickly washed away when they got to his bedroom and he was being pinned to the door. Castiel put one hand up Dean's shirt to rest on his hip, the other pressed against the door beside Dean's head. Dean's breath fell away, his back naturally arching up.
"Why? Eager to reunite with daddy?" Meg asked with a sly smirk.
"Dean, do you think maybe it's time to get him help? Like Lawrence Psych Center help?" Sam asked carefully.
"I didn't mean break my ass," Dean pouted as he helped Cas stretch fresh sheets over the mattress.
He shook it off as he finally mustered up enough courage to open the driver side door and step out. His boots hit the ground with a sure thud and he stands before he can slip back into his seat. He shut the door and played with his keys for a second before stepping forward.
room, at least in Dean's head it had. Castiel would text Dean to meet him there, and he was always early. The woman at the front desk would see his face, give him a little smile, and hand him the key without him even saying a thing. Room service always showed up at some point, usually after they've had sex. Brilliant, mind blowing sex that Dean never imagined he could have with someone his age, albeit a year older.
, but I'm supposed to be in the gym with the team. Bobby will notice if I'm not there," he said, looking all levels of regretful.
"Um, ten maybe," he licked his lips, his mouth suddenly dry.
"What, Dean? What do you want?" He asked, voice deeper than before. He dove right back down, his tongue sliding inside of him, reclaiming its spot, lapping, flicking, fucking.
"I'm pretty wiped, but maybe tomorrow," she smiled politely as she hooked her bag over her shoulder and sipped some water.
A phone call in the middle of the night leaves Dean sitting on his bed as the time ticks towards 4am, a gun on his bedside table, and the absolute fact that he won't be sleeping anytime soon.
"You dropped it around the time you told me someone spit on you," Dean said, picking the joint up from the first step and handing it back to cas. "I'm seriously going to need a name on that one. They're getting their entire fucking mouth revoked," he said with a downward turn of his expression.
Typically, high school bad boys are those who disrespect teachers and have no care for their grades, maybe they hook up with everyone's girlfriend and disobey their parents, they might steal or throw massive parties, but Castiel was not that kind of bad boy.
Dean tapped his pencil against his notebook, staring blankly at the classroom floor. The speckles in the tiles make him think about Castiel's eyes, electric blue with little swirls of black around the edges.
"I'm just tired," Cas sighed.
"First and foremost," she said as she slipped her hands into a pair of gloves. "We'll make sure that this little fellow is doing okay.“
"You need what, baby?" Castiel teased, his fingertips running lightly over Dean's stomach, just beneath his shirt.
"It's Saturday, turn your alarm off," he grumbled, turning to cuddle into Cas' chest. Cas groaned beneath him, patting his back.
It was shortly after Jack turned four that they officially moved into the house. Two stories, painted a soft yellow that was easy on the eyes, blue shutters, a white picket fence. A very spacious garage. Cas pointed out everything that Jack helped pick out, like the granite countertops, and the wallpaper in the hallway.
"Good boy," there was a hint of adoration in his voice that had Dean preening and sucking hard at the digits in his mouth. "Does it feel good being full like this?" He circled his hips, burying himself impossibly deeper inside of Dean. "Both of your little holes nice and stuffed full. Is this what you were looking for? All those guys who didn't know how to treat this little body, how to treat it as nicely as I am. Is this what you wanted, slut?" The name rolls so sweetly off of his tongue that it sounds like the highest of praise, and all Dean can do was nod and suck harder.
"You're late Miss Novak," Mr. Jacobs said with a detention slip ready between his fingers.
"I know, baby," she assured, pressing once more on the plug before settling her hands by her thighs. She licked her lips and gently smoothed over his stomach before she began bouncing on him. Dean had tears in his eyes as soon as she started her relentless pace, rising up and dropping down hard. She pinched and flicked his nipples, occasionally reaching back to tease at his plug. Dean gasped and moaned, his hips unbearably still, his eyes glued on her.
"No," Dean denies confidently, shoving away his anxiety so he could stand and face her. "No, I promise, I'm not cheating on you. It's just complicated. Our relationship was..." He can't finish his sentence.
They go to court two months later, on a rainy tuesday afternoon. Jack wears a button up that Castiel had ironed with trembling hands. Kayla shows up with her mother, who had actually been very adamant that she had no knowledge of Jack's existence and wanted to be present in his life. She was very reassuring from the beginning that she wouldn't dare fight them for custody because of what good parents they seem to be.
"Are you kidding me? Where is she?" Sam reached for his keys but Dean was closer. He smacked his hand down and pulled them away with a furrow in his brow.
"Come on, Cas, you knew how she felt about Dean and people are saying you slept with him during comp week," Abigail said.
"Deep breath for me, sweetheart," he said. Dean took a few deep breaths in and out through his nose, then Castiel was forcing his head down, his cock pressing passed his tongue. Dean forced his throat to relax, his eyes fluttering shut as he poured all of his attention into breathing through his nose.
good. Get back to school or I'm taking your keys.
"Sulk and wait for him to either call or pop up dead?" He shrugged.
"I can't just go up to his sister and ask where he is. What would I say? 'Hey I've been fucking your brother for the last three months, we're not really dating but I really like him so could you tell me where he is and why he isn't answer my texts?' Because that's not insane," Dean pointed out.
"I have no doubt you're easy enough for someone to take advantage of," Lisa rolled her eyes.
." Dean cursed under his breath, ending the call and going to his messages instead.
Dean paused mid chew as his phone started buzzing in his pocket. His pizza dangled from his right hand as he lifted his hips to dig his phone from the back pocket of his jeans.
"I'm ready, daddy," Jack said, bouncing into the kitchen with his backpack full of toys and his shoes on the wrong feet. He looked towards Castiel and opened his mouth hesitantly. "Are you coming with us, papa?" He asked, shoulders tensed.
"Thank you," he said quietly before standing from the bed. Dean was immediately worried that he would leave. He propped himself up on his elbows, his eyes dancing. "Come on, let's go shower." Dean breathed out slowly as he was pulled up from the bed. He guided Castiel to the bathroom on shaky legs, thankful that Bobby was always on them about keeping it clean.
"I take it you hate it?" Dean teased, even though his heart has never felt lighter.
"Five bucks," he held his hand out.
Anyways, you are valid, you are loved, you are worth the world. Happy pride, I love you <3
Yes, yes it is.
"I like the red," he said, smiling softly at her.
"How did you get out of that basement, Dean?" She asked softly.
"No," ash answered uncaringly as he walked back over to the desk, masterfully avoiding the paper strewn across the floor.
"She is bisexual but I'm sure she has standards and slut shaming cheerleaders are probably below her," Castiel said, rolling her lollipop on her tongue. Lisa gaped at her, looking all levels of affronted.
"I'm like three minutes late!" Castiel argued.
*sniff* *sniff* do you smell that? *sniff* I think it's plot *gasp*
Happy Pride month!!!
"You're the best," Castiel mumbled, already half asleep.
Deans eyes widened and he opened his mouth wide before he was wincing. "Fuck, there is literally
"Alright, start talking. Why is Meg afraid of you and what did Castiel literally probably die protecting?" Dean asked, crossing his arms over his chest. Ash picked up one piece of paper amidst the mess of everything else and handed it to Dean. It was a photograph of a young girl, maybe ten years old with dirty blonde hair, looking at the camera with terror in her eyes. Just her face was in the picture, smudged with dirt.
, Dean thinks distantly. Cas' fingers dig into Dean's skin like they're marking their territory, imprinting themselves onto his skin to make sure the outline will still be there even when the hands themselves are gone.
"I wasn't too concerned with your actions between you and that red headed friend of yours, I feel I know the terms of your friendship after watching you for a little while. I believe at the last party you were at it was a cute little brunette you had between you two. I always leaned more towards men but I can appreciate a beautiful female, and she was quite the looker, that pretty belly, those nice big thighs. I can see why Charlie picked her. And that beautiful girl tonight, Charlie sure knows how to pick them, doesn't she?" Castiel's hand slipped down the front of Dean's pants, cupping his erection and squeezing just slightly. Dean sucked in a breath, trying to keep his hips still for Castiel. "But Lisa," Castiel tsked, his jaw flexing as it clenched. "She looked a little too desperate for it. Were you going to fuck her, Dean? Maybe let her sit on your dick like she so obviously wanted to?" Castiel growled.
"Wait, are you serious? I thought it would be a lot less," he said.
"I have to go, doll. You be good now, okay?" He patted Dean's hand and went to pull away. Dean gripped his hand tight and pulled him back, his wounds pulling.

"Don't tell me it's nothing!" She cut him off, loud before her voice softens again. "Please, Dean, I'm worried about you. You've been distant for months and it's only gotten worse. You zone out every class period, you don't want to hang out as much, you ignore my texts for hours, and you've been getting mysterious bruises that you won't tell me about. Is someone hurting you? You know I can help you if you need me," Charlie's eyes went soft and her voice dropped into that gentle soothing octave that always made Dean's skin settle.
"It?" Dean questioned with a laugh, "Sam, it's a baby, not an it," he said.
"You were gone awhile," Sam remarked when he sat back down at the table. Dean sank into his seat, pressing his hands lightly to his thighs, feeling the soft material of his slacks.
"To fuck you," he said, turning his attention back to the door. Dean rolled his eyes. The alcohol was still buzzing in his system, making him less nervous this time.
"What do you mean, so? You've been wanting Lisa since she joined the cheer team," Benny said.
"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry." Dean moved to the side and opened the door wider so Castiel could walk inside. "My room is just, um, up here," Dean pointedly awkwardly to the stairs. Castiel followed silently, his dirty boots thumping intimidatingly against the wood.
Dean has to roll his eyes when the man–
That's when the panic set in.
"They're growing too fast," Dean said.
"Loves pie. Duly noted."
"Knock knock," a low voice said from the door. A tall man in an FBI vest walked in slowly, giving them a small smile. "Castiel Novak, time to go" he said. Castiel looked down at Dean's hand and smiled, something despondent in his eyes.
"Hey, honey, look at me," Cas only pulls out that nickname on special occasions, so Dean glances up rather quick. Cas scoots over so that he's sitting at Deans side. He brings his hand up to wipe away the tear tracks on Dean's cheeks. "I love you, okay?" He whispered softly. "I love you as a boyfriend and I'll love you as Jack's father. You don't have to be alone to be a good father and you don't have to be childless to be a good boyfriend. We're going to figure it out, because that's what people do when they have kids. They change and they grow, but they don't have to do it alone," Cas shakes his head, wiping away more tears.
"Don't worry about Chuck, I already dealt with him," Castiel said as he carried Dean out of the house.
"Whatever you decide, man. My doors always open, you know that," Sam insisted, reaching over the counter to squeeze Dean's shoulder. Dean nodded, his eyes heavy with emotional exhaustion.
"Let's be glad that's not the case," Miranda shared in his laughter. Cas opened his mouth to respond but the car screen lit up with a phone call and Miranda smiled affectionately. "Speak of the devil," she said before answering. "Hi handsome."
we'll talk about why you're not at school later, just put desperate housewives on and sit her down with a glass of wine then get your ass back to school.
"Where's your purse?" He asked, struggling to angle his head into the backseat.
"Hotel it is," Castiel nodded once, then made a u-turn.
"What about his sister?" Charlie asked.
"Hello, boy toy," she purred, a gun sitting innocently on her lap as she flipped through a magazine. Dean swallowed, steeling his emotions so they wouldn't show on his face. He heard the door slam downstairs, thankful that Sam was out of the house. He couldn't hear the pots rustling but he knew that Bobby was working on dinner.
got covered in glitter, the first time Sam met Jack. Then it was middle childhood, soccer games and school plays, their wedding, in front of the courthouse when they won full custody. Then high school, the first time they took Jack to Pride, that time Cas broke his leg and they mistakingly gave him a bell to ring when he needed them, adopting Claire. Family trips, small moments, days spent at the park, random little things that made their life so worth living, they were all interspersed in there. Some of the notes that Dean kept from the lunches Castiel packed him, pictures the kids drew, notes Dean left for Cas on days he woke up first, copies of their wedding vows. They were all in there. Cas was crying when he finally finished flipping through, and he couldn't speak, so he threw his arms around deans shoulders and cried softly into his husbands neck.
"That's good, Dean. I'm proud of you." A shiver ran up his spine as those words left her lips. Goosebumps rose on his skin and he couldn't help the little shake that shot through his knees. The guilt was rising. "I should go get ready for my speech, but," Cas paused as she looked at him, something hesitant in her eyes. He could only imagine what expression he had on his face. "It was really good to see you, Dean." She tossed her cigarette on the ground and crushed it under her heel as she reached into her purse. It was a bittersweet feeling that ran through him when she pulled out two sticks of Peach flavored gum. She offered him one and he took it because he is weak. She didn't say anything else as she walked away, back towards the door where he had set the brick.
"I'm sorry," the agent flipped through the file she had been holding with a frown, "I thought your father was deceased."
Dean left Judy and the kids in the living room once all of the presents were opened, and he stopped Cas from leaving the kitchen when he tried to pass Dean. Cas gave him a questioning look, but Dean hushed him and guided him into the garage.
"After you change, i love you but you're going to look ridiculous walking into a bar as a pride flag," Dean smiled.
The distinct little voice of their six year old shouted as if only to prove Dean wrong.
For a moment.
Dean slipped the note into his wallet with a little smile and opened the bag of tomato and cucumber.
"Yeah, we're visiting Jess's sister, she had her baby so we're going down to meet it," he said.
Castiel jumped out of her mother's car with a tired yawn. She ducked her head down and gave her mother a once over.
Sam shouted in the background. Miranda and Cas shared a fond eye roll.
," the fourteen year old smirked and saluted him back. Dean rolled his eyes and took this as his uncomfortable cue to get out of the car. Charlie waved animatedly at Bobby from the porch of Lisa Braeden's (parents) huge two story house. Dean stepped up onto the porch and waited for Bobby to drive away before dropping his innocent smile.
"You are killing this whole tummy time thing, dude, absolutely shredding it. Look at me, look at daddy," Dean smiled, tilting his head as Jack tried looking up. He smiled when he saw Dean, his knees wriggling like he was trying to go for Dean.
"No way," Charlie gasped.
"Then we better get in the shower, we only have thirty minutes," Castiel said, patting Dean's ass before grabbing the plate off of his stomach.
Castiel removed his hand from Dean's hair, Dean's head lolling back against Castiel's shoulder. Then Castiel's fingers were at his lips and he opened his mouth to latch onto them. The taste of cherry was a shock to his taste buds and a moan got muffled in his throat when he realized what it was. He sucked hard on Cas' fingers, gripping his wrist, swirling his tongue around and between them, savoring the taste of cherry pie filling.
"It was different. It wasn't like ours," it's not a good explanation, they both know it.
Dean took a moment to send all of the good pictures and videos he took in his phone to Cas. His foot tapped restlessly against the ground as he waited for a response. The messages were read one second, the three little dots in the text bubble appeared, then they disappeared, and the messages remained on read for several minutes until Dean gave up. He locked up his phone, slid it into his pocket, then faced the concerned look Sam was staring at him with.
She was about to put the buds in her ears when someone tapped on the window beside her seat. She looked over and rolled her eyes as Dean waved at her with a dopey little smile. She pulled the window down and stood with her knee on the bench, folding her arms over the window sill as she peered out.
"You didn't think to bring a condom?" She asked, raising an eyebrow.
"What are you doing here?" He asked, jaw clenching. Meg didn't look up at him as she flipped to another page, sighing.
"Why not?" Sam pushed. “You were so in love with her and she helped you so much, you’re telling me that there is not a single part of you that wants that back?
Alright friends, this is it. I’m sorry for the long wait, life is being…. Well life. It’s a pain in the ass haha
"You do look really sexy when you're annoyed with my shit," Dean smirked.
"No!"
"I think there is," he whispered, catching Castiel's eyes. His voice lowers to a whisper, "that world is dull and full of longing and I thank whatever God is out there, every day, that I don't live in that world." Castiel brings a hand up to cup Dean's cheek, and he leans in until their lips are just ghosting one another's.
"Really? Because it looks like you're smashed," she countered.
"Hey, be nice," Cas chided. Dean thought for a second that he was talking to Meg, but Cas' eyes were fixed on him. Deans eyebrows drew down and a few stones settled heavily in his gut.
"Hey, don't start something you can't finish," Dean said, rubbing his ass with a coy look over his shoulder. Castiel chased him into the bathroom with a smirk.
"Hey baby, I haven't seen you around since the party," he said, pulling Dean close. Dean raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
When she told him that she couldn't handle being alone anymore, he didn't know what to do. He had been defensive where he should have been reassuring, he was cold where he should have been accepting, he was hurt where he should have been comforting. He was too stubborn to fight when she ended it. She was right. He knows that now. He left her messages unread for weeks before calling her when the need hit him. It wasn't fair, it was her holding their relationship together for those last few weeks.
"I'll be right back," her voice was far away to Dean as he lowered his hands to his stomach, floating around somewhere underwater. She was back the next time he blinked, a warm washcloth in one hand, dressed back up in panties and a tee shirt. He must have had his eyes closed longer than he thought. She cleaned the sweat from his forehead and the sticky mess around his legs, then tossed the washcloth somewhere else and laid on her back beside him.
It was pointless, he was shattering. He wanted to crawl out of his own skin, tear away every piece of himself that Castiel touched so he couldn't think about it anymore. He pressed his fist to his mouth as the heat behind his eyes finally took over, tears falling in constant streams, landing heavy on his skin. He dug his face into his hands, trying to soften the sobs wracking through him.
"Don't talk to my son like that," Dean bit, not daring to look at her in fear that he might kill her with his eyes.
"Morning Cas," Dean smiled, holding out a to-go cup of coffee from the little bakery behind the school.
"She asked about Mandy." Sam smiled sadly. Dean shut his eyes for a second. "I finally put up her photos again, she pointed to the frame and said 'that's my mommy'," he chuckled, eyes reddening with the formation of tears.
"She tastes like lemonade," she said with a deliriously sweet smile. The girl put her hands on Dean's cheeks and pulled him down, pressing their lips together. Dean kept his hands on Charlie, gripping her waist as he kissed the girl between them, her lips soft and full, her hands warm. Her coiled black hair tickled his face when he dipped his head to kiss her neck. He lost himself in the feeling of her and Charlie, something sweet and comforting rather than arousing. Though it was arousing, he wasn't seeking release here, he was seeking the comfort of another person's body.
"Wait, where the fuck did my joint go?" Cas pulled away and glanced down at the floor.
"Good," Castiel smiled with something between adoration and possessiveness. Dean wasn't sure which one he liked more because they were equally dizzying. "Come, pet, there's too many curious eyes on us." Castiel placed his hand on Dean's lower back and guided him out of the kitchen. Dean wanted to feel embarrassed that he was being guided by Castiel Novak like an obedient little puppy, but all he could feel was the pride swelling inside of him that Castiel Novak wanted him, and fuck if that's not the best feeling ever.
"Yeah, you're right," Charlie's shoulders deflated. "So what are you going to do?"
"Sugar, please." Jack laid himself down with his head pillowed on the arm of the couch, his knees pulled up to his chest. Dean ran his fingers through his sons hair, leaning down to press a kiss to his forehead.
"Go on, go wait in the car," he waved him off with a firm nod. Dean took slow steps to the door, watching Castiel chug a bit more of the tequila as Michael pressed the tweezers to his wound. Castiel's screams were muffled by the thick wooden door after Dean closed it.
"Hi Uncle Sam!" Jack greeted as he raced under his arm to get inside.
"Come on, papa!" Jack beckoned, tugging on Castiel's wrist.
"Ah!" Miranda screamed again, car lurching again. A car came speeding up the hill and Miranda, in a fit of blind pain, smacked her hand on the wheel, forcing the car to the left, right in the path of the oncoming car. Cas shouted, yanking the wheel back to the right. The car moved past, but Miranda's hand was still hooked in the steering wheel and when Cas lost his grip, the car lurched to the left. He sprang forward, gripping the wheel again, but they were too far off. The car jerked as the front tires tried to bring them back up onto the road, but the two back tires were failing. Cas spun the wheel but they are already tumbling off of the side of road
"Hey, Meg is just trying to protect me," Cas defended.
"You're right," Cas sighed, "thank you, Dean," she tilted her head back with her lips puckered and Dean leaned down to kiss her.
"I want to know if Castiel is okay," he demanded, squaring his shoulders a bit like Ash doesn't have a foot and a half on him. "I want to know what the hell is going on," he added.
"Dean Winchester," cas tilted their head at him, "are you being protective?" They asked.
"We don't know," Ash shrugged. "They're speculating that it was just a deal gone wrong but Castiel would
"Don't apologize, doll. There's other ways I can have you begging," with those words, Castiel's fingers slipped out so he could grip Dean's hips and guide him to the bed, gently pushing him down onto his stomach on the mattress. His hands were nimble and demanding as they arranged Dean's body how they wanted him. He propped himself up on his elbows, his thighs pushed apart.
"You're going to be okay, doll."
Dean loves that Castiel is having a good time with Meg. He loves that he's out of bed and out of his pajamas and out of his shell of darkness, but he hates that he played no part in that. After hundreds of hours trying and trying, Dean still wasn't enough. Maybe that's selfish. Maybe Dean just wanted so badly to be his cure, to be what helps him through this storm. Maybe that's what's clouding his judgement. Perhaps there was nothing Dean could have done in the first place. Dean made Castiel comfortable in his sadness. Dean kept him fed and warm and hydrated even if he didn't leave his bed. Dean picked up an extra job when Castiel was too sad to look for another one. Dean bathed him when he was too numb to do it himself. Dean loved him so much that he allowed Castiel to become one with his depression.
"Don't worry about him, he's fine," he grunted.
"I hope so," Dean said as he approached them.
"I was texting my siblings," she said, locking her phone.
"Need a light?" His breath hitched before he even looked up. Her eyes were soft and dim in the faint light of the alley.
"Fine, I picked Dean because I knew it would annoy you, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings," cas turned to walk away, but Lisa grabbed her wrist and tugged her back.
When he sets it in the fridge in the back office at the garage, he doesn't dare try to hide his name. He even takes a picture, lovingly pointing his middle finger at it, and sends it to cas with a message attached saying, 'you're ridiculous'. Cas texts back a heart emoji.
There's a car waiting for him when he walks out of the office and he settled contently into a productive, familiar groove. He does three oil changes, rotates some times, changes two headlight bulbs, and a lady brings her car in because it's "being weird on her", and he spends thirty minutes trying to diagnose it because it kept randomly shutting off. He'd gotten an earful because he couldn't magically wave his hand at it and make it work again. She glared at him until someone came to pick her up.
"Yeah," Benny snapped his fingers. "Apparently that guy had been fucking with his sister," he said.
Dean couldn't see anything besides Castiel's eyes as he was laid down on something soft, blurry bodies working around him, Castiel's hand gently gripping his. There were strong winds outside and muffled radio static. Dean could barely hear any of it over the sound of Castiel's voice.
"Mm, my slut wants me to fuck him harder?" Cas licked his lips, tilting his head down with a soft expression. Dean bit his lip, swallowing down a moan as Cas' hips continued their torturous circles. Dean nodded when it was obvious that Castiel was just going to keep staring at him until he got a response.
Dean lost his breath for a second, his heart beating in his throat.
Castiel had been held back a year because of his time spent in juvie, and Dean started school a year later because he had a shitty father, so while he was eighteen, Castiel was nineteen. For the past three months, Dean met Castiel in this hotel room, and when they left this room, they were nothing. Dean would see him at school, Castiel would smirk at him, and they never engaged.
"What the hell are you looking at? Dean, are you okay?" Charlie asked, looking over her shoulder to try and figure out where his eyes were going. She couldn't, because Dean was looking everywhere.
It's surprising him too, though it really shouldn't. She has taken him apart piece by piece then carefully reassembled him, adding pieces of herself to make him whole.
"Give me a sec, Bobby!" He grumbled. He looked back up at Cas with a smile plastered on. "Can I see you later?" He asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm comin'." Cas followed them closer to the water, where Jack had left all of the sand toys.
, Jack's father.
"You can't stop what? Thinking about her? Have you been seeing her?" There is an accusation hidden in her tone.
"Yes, Garth, my boyfriend packed my lunch. He could have written another mans name or 'pretty Princess' and I wouldn't care, because inside this bag?" Dean opens it and pulls out a meatball sandwich wrapped in Saran Wrap, a bag of Doritos, and a can of Coke. "Is Heaven," he says, moaning excessively as he unwraps his sandwich.
"I'm trying to prove a point so if you're agreeable, I'd like to straddle and kiss you. If not," she directed her attention to the rest of the table, making her insinuation obvious.
"What is wrong with you two? Where the hell were you?" Dean asked as he shut and locked the door again.
He wipes at his mouth and spits into the dirt as he walks back to his car. With a stomach in knots, he settles into the driver's seat, lightheaded and nauseous.
"Come on, Dean. I'm just trying to make you nice and pretty. You see, your little friend Ash should be watching by now." Chuck smiled at something over Dean's shoulder, something he couldn't see in his position but he can only assume that it was a camera. "Clever little boy that Ash is. Ash and Castiel were so close growing up, I know that they cared very deeply for each other. So, Ash would most likely do anything to save Castiel's little pet." The name made Dean's blood boil coming from Chuck's mouth. "Including, getting me the money that's being watched by the FBI. I bet he didn't know that I knew I was being watched. The moment I found out my files had been touched, I became very vigilant. Of course the shock of it being Castiel came as quit the stab-" Dean gasped as the knife plunged into his hip, "to the back," Chuck finished with a little chuckle. "I want my money, and the moment I get it, I'll let you go," Chuck pulled the knife out and Dean screamed. "Shh, it's alright," the knife plunged back in, Dean's head falling back with a scream. Chuck weaved his fingers into his hair and yanked his head forward.
"Yeah, the noise was getting to me, I ducked out for a cigarette," he said with a nod of his head.
"But what if I change. Parenthood changes people, doesn't it? What if it makes me someone that you don't like. Someone that you'd rather not be with? I'm not going to have any time between working and Jack, how am I supposed to be a good boyfriend while trying to be a father?" Dean hiccups, his chest tight.
Also, I use the word "cum" instead of "come" i don't know if that bothers anyone, I know a lot authors use one or the other and I can't figure out why lol. I live in a little bubble so if it bothers anyone let me know :)
"What thing?" She asked, pulling her head up.
"What's up your panties today?" Meg asked.
"Mm, you're not my type," someone said, a finger running over Dean's chest. His angry shout was muffled by his gag and someone else chuckled.
"I know," he whispered. The drive was quiet except for the low volume of the radio. Jack fell asleep on the way, so Dean carried the car seat inside and they sat it down on the floor and sank down with their backs to the door, staring at him as he breathed. Dean held Castiel's hand in his lap, leaning his head against his shoulder with a tired sigh. It wasn't even 1pm and he was exhausted.
"Ride me. Ride me, please. I want you to ride me, Miss." She laughed fondly at his enthusiasm as she straddled his hips.
"Cas!" Dean jumped up the last few steps, gently grabbing Castiel's shoulders, gently shaking them.
Castiel rides in the back with Jack, his hand pressed securely against him to make up for the loose straps. The hospital is a ten minute drive, and Dean white knuckles the steering wheel the entire way there.
"Yeah, I'm good, why?" He asked casually, even as he refused to meet Sam's eyes.

Cas kneeled down in the sand, his knee brushing his husbands, his hands scooping sand in his sons little blue pale. Dean smiled at him and cas knew that that world Dean was talking about, it does exist. It’s a world where maybe Cas died from that first gunshot wound. It’s a world where maybe Chuck didn’t favor him and he died a lonely, terrified child. It’s a world where Cas doesn’t know the pleasure of waking up with Jack jumping into their bed, Dean laughing loudly, freely beside him. Cas would hate to live in that world too.
"Then why are we living in this shitty one bedroom?" Dean asked.
"That's my ride, so I guess I'm going too," Charlie said, pushing herself up from the floor.
"How'd you know?" He asked.
"Yes you do," Lisa insisted, her mouth twisting up. "You knew I liked Dean and you made a show in front of the entire cafeteria."

"Watch yourself Miss Novak or you'll be rolling your eyes in detention." Castiel sighed, crossing her arms over her chest and sinking a bit in her chair.
"Stop!"
"Alright. Meet me at 1 tonight, okay?"
Room 314 felt haunted now, and it was unfamiliar for Dean to knock.
"Love you," Miranda and Cas repeated. The car beeped the completion of the call and Miranda sighed as she relaxed into her seat.
"What's the matter, Novak? Someone get your panties in a twist?" He asked, leaning against the railing. He tilted his head trying to catch Castiel's eyes, but Cas tilted their head down towards the joint hanging between their fingers. Fingers that were slightly shaking. "Cas?"
"You're freaking me out, Cas," Dean said, his face hot.
"That for me?" Cas asked with a small smile.
"I'm so sorry Anna." Dean gently laid her down and walked to the closet, grabbing the first shirt her found and a pair of sweatpants. He dressed her quickly, his eyes continuously flicking to the door. He picked her up and set her down on the rocking chair by the window then returned to the man on the bed. He rolled him over, struggling to get him further up the bed. Where Anna's wrist were just restrained, Dean secured the mans wrists, wrapping the gag around his head and buckling it into place.
"Please tell me you two didn't break into a fucking school," Dean pinched the bridge of his nose.
"Love you too, daddy," Jack whispered back. His pretty green eyes were red and filled with tears, Dean forced himself to look away before he furthered Jack's distress with his own emotions. He walked to the kitchen once Jack started clicking away at the tv. He searched around the counters and the fridge in case Cas had left a note or a clue, but there was nothing.
"A condom," Cas said into the phone.
"How'd you do that?" Dean asked.
you get mom under control?
"Really?" Cas picked her head up with a hopeful raise of her eyebrows. She caught Dean's eyes flicking up to them with a smile, and she smacked his leg.
"Yeah, he has a terrible rash, Cas. I," he stuttered, his throat closing. "I know she said she could afford much but this is just fucking neglect," he choked.
"I love you too," Cas sniffed as he pulled Dean into him, hugging him tightly.
"I love you, buddy," he whispered.
"Tell him I'm sick." Dean lowered his chin to his chest, allowing his eyes to close. He wanted to yell and scream for Cas not to let him down again. Not to break his heart again.
Dean Winchester stared up at her with wide eyes. The rest of the table had eyes on her as well, but she kept her attention on Dean.
A trip to Sam’s and a promise
"Where have you been all this time?" Dean asked.
"We need to talk about whatever you're going through," she said.
"Lisa's pissed at you," Abigail said, leaning against the locker beside Castiel's.
"Lisa?" Coach Harvell questioned, gently grabbing Cas' wrist to inspect it. The initial pain was wearing off and it didn't hurt when Coach Harvell rolled it in circles.
Dean groaned as a ringing sounded throughout the room.
"What the fuck?" Dean flipped the blanket off of his head, looking towards the door. "Um, Dean?" Dean shot out of bed at the panicked, confused tone of Cas' voice. He didn't bother with pants as he threw the bedroom door open and looked towards the front door. Dean stopped in his tracks when he saw what Cas was staring at. There on the welcome mat was a car seat, and inside of that car seat was a sleeping baby.
Dean pulled himself up from the couch with a grunt, shuffling his way into the kitchen to get the hamburger meat out of the fridge. He prepped it quickly, seasoning it the way he always does, adding a little less paprika because Lisa had said he put too much last time. She was right, Sam had scrunched his nose too, then again they both think Hot Cheetos are spicy. He puts a dash more then mix it all together to start forming the patties.
"Daddy?" She mumbled, pawing at his chest.
"Did y'all hear that Meg Masters slept with Benny Lafitte at Garths party?" Jo asked as she dipped a carrot stick into her little tray of ranch. Castiel looked up, her mouth pausing around the lollipop in it.
"I'm going to get another drink," he said, slipping from Lisa's grip before she could protest. He felt her tug his belt loop, but he kept walking until her hands fell dejectedly to her sides. He slipped into the kitchen, his skin sticky with sweat, his lips tingling from the kissing. He waved off the guy offering to pour drinks and grabbed a bottle of tequila. He poured himself a shot, squirted some lemon into his mouth, and downed it. He smacked his lips a few times as he poured another one.
"Yes, please, miss," he nods his head almost furiously. She chuckled, sliding her hand down from his hair to squeeze the back of his neck, then she was moving away from him. He whined, a furrow in his brow that is quickly smoothed away with a firm look.
"Anna," he called softly, trying to catch her eyes. She looked through him when their eyes caught. "Can you hear me?" He whispered.
"Maybe six?" He said it as more of a question. Castiel moved his thumb and replaced it with his tongue, licking broad strips against Dean's entrance, not pressing in just yet.
"Ew, Bobby, you're like my dad, you can't say sex," Dean cringed. Bobby laughed, patting Dean on the back.
"Cas and I grew up together," he said, looking to the floor.
"What? Dean, if I didn't want to be here then I wouldn't be. I don't feel pressured to stay, I'm staying because I love you," Castiel said.
"Expectant much?" He teased. Castiel pressed Dean's head back down to the pillow and nipped gently on his earlobe.
I will not always be this gracious Castiel. Your mother is a drunk and she's sleeping with my husband, I know it!
"Shh, you're doing so well for me. Turn over," Castiel's hands guided Dean gently onto his back. He settled between his thighs, sitting back against his heels. Dean laid back with a soft breath, watching as Castiel lifted the hem of his shirt and pulled it over his head. A lump formed in Dean's throat as his eyes quickly mapped out the other boy's chest. There were multiple scars on his golden skin, one below his left pec, another along his rib cage, two more at his hip. The biggest one stretched from below his armpit all the way down to his hip, thick and raised. Dean reached up without really thinking about it, pressing the very tips of his fingers to that scar, tracing it down to the Castiel's hip. Cas watched him, his expression revealing nothing. Dean looked back up, his mouth closing on a swallow when he found Cas' eyes already on him. Castiel licked his lips, reaching down and gently gripping Dean's wrists, pressing them down into the mattress above his head.
"Who is this?" He asked.
Gabe rolled his eyes but recited, "I tell you when and where I'm smoking, who I'm with, and if I'll need a ride."
Sorry for the wait and any grammar errors, I am currently sick so bear with me
"Yeah, I'll be home soon. I gotta go, bye honey!" The line went dead and Deans phone was thrown to the ground. He pressed the balls of his hands into his eyes, rubbing harshly until the sting of tears could be blamed on the pain. He threw himself up from the bed, his teeth pressing down so hard he was afraid he might break them. He stalked out of the room, not planning on sleeping in that bed. He laid himself out on the couch, Frozen 2 still playing on the tv. He pillowed his head on the arm of the sofa, stretching his legs across the cushions, eyes trained on Elsa.
"What are you doing?" Cas asked with a small laugh.
"Home by 9," Bobby said without looking up.
"You wanna skip and get high?" Meg asked.
He had to pull the bottle away several times so Jack would breathe between gulps. Deans eyes filled with tears as he fed Jack, watching the boy greedily suck from the bottle, his eyes darting around the room.
"Welcome back," she said. He gave her a smile and a nod as he walked past. He took slow steps to the elevator, let the doors close and the metal sit as he stared at the buttons. His brain itched for him to hurry up, to run as fast as he can to that door, but his body won't listen. He has been a ball of excited energy up until he pulled into the lot, then he was reduced to nothing but frayed nerves.
"Miss, I can't take much," he whined, still desperately trying not to thrust up.
"They are, aren't they? I can't believe how well they get along. My cousins tormented me, I thought it was the rule of life," Cas laughed.
"Meaning not in pain, meaning fine. Start driving down this road," Castiel pointed in front of them, but Dean's eyes were looking out of his window, where a guy with shaggy brown hair and a young face was closing up the door of the rental truck. Another boy, young and blonde, approached the dead guy on the floor with a black bag and a shovel.
"The first time I saw you, the first time I
"Of course they do. They saw you at the cabin the night Cas got shot. They didn't know who you were until that night, Cas was damn good at covering his tracks, he had to be if he was working against Chuck." Ash ran a hand through his hair, blowing a shaky breath from his mouth.
"Ah, ah, daddy Chuck has plans for me doesn't he?" He said, licking his lips. He could see the man's nostrils flare from where he stood, his friend at his side clutching his shoulder, trying to keep as much of his blood inside of it as he could. The man's eyes subtly flicked over Dean's shoulder and he spun around, raising his gun. A knife was lowered and it sliced down on his forearm, making him stutter. A punch was thrown to his nose and he reeled back as his gun was knocked from his grip. He gathered his bearings quickly poising himself for a fight. The man from behind him slammed his gun between deans shoulder blades, sending him forward into Meg, who gripped his head and yanked him down into her knee. He was sent to the floor in a flurry of pain, his hands twisted and pressed down to his middle back, a knee settled on top of them. Dean struggled to twist his head towards the confident, authoritative set of footsteps. Dean scowled when Chuck bent down and tilted his head at Dean.
"Crowley is nothing but a stoner, I don't need my reputation tainted by rumors saying I was slumming it with stoners," Abigail said.
"Then I must be sexy all the time," Cas teased.
"Good boy," she whispered, her voice breathy as she settled around him. Her hands pressed firmly into his chest, her thumb absently stroking over his nipple, sending little sparks of pleasure through him.
"Thank you!" Sam yelled, the screen door closing behind him. Dean shook his head, turning his attention back to the car.
"Dean," Ash called as his hand landed on the doorknob. He turned his head over his shoulder. "Castiel wanted you to have this. Assured me you know how to use it." Dean sucked in a breath as Ash held out a black handgun. Deans tongue felt too heavy with the amount of questions sitting on top of it, so he simply nodded and turned back to Ash. He gripped the gun, its weight solid against his palm, the metal cold. He flicked his gaze to Ash, the man's eyes scrutinizing Dean's every move. Dean swallowed again as he looked down the gun. He made sure the safety was on, then he tucked it into the waistband of his boxers. He gave Ash a once over then turned back to the door.
"Ah, that was amazing" the boy smirked at Dean from where he's propping himself up on his elbows.
"I mean, I thought about it even before Jack but I thought it was too soon, now that he's here though, we could use the space," Cas said.
"Alright, if you want to fuck me you'll have to warm me up first and I'm not in the mood to spend half an hour making out. So, if you want to do this, I'd prefer you just go down on me. That cool with you?" Castiel asked as she sat up, spreading her legs a bit.
"Come on, buddy." Dean gathered his keys and wallet from the counter and headed out of the kitchen. He paused in the doorway, glancing over his shoulder at his husband. "I'll see you later?" He can't breathe through the uncertainty in his voice.
"You're a dork," she remarked with a warm little smile. "I kiss you once and now I can't get rid of you," she teased.
can I have $5?
"I'm just really tired and my uncle is expecting me home soon," Dean shrugged, taking a half step back, his gaze flicking down to where his wrist was trapped in the boy's hold.
"Having fun?" His breath left his lungs with a stuttered gasp. He didn't try to turn around just yet, he gripped the shot glass in his hand and shrugged.
"Everything the FBI would need to take Chuck and his entire empire down. I'm talking usernames and passwords, bank accounts
"There's something under the blanket," he said, tucking his hands close to his chest. Cas bent down again, very carefully peeled the blanket up and pulled out a folded piece of paper. He handed it to Dean then peered outside.
"What is it now, Dean?" he asked wearily.
burn my house down, huh?” And then Castiel is laughing.
“Awesome,” Sam swoons, and Dean is unexpectedly hit by a pang of sadness; his little brother is growing up.
“Careful,” Sam warns, “I don’t wanna be the one breaking the news to Cas that you choked to death.”
“I dunno…” Cas says, trailing off.
“I guess I probably look pretty unappealing to you now,” Cas murmurs miserably.
“I guess I can hold it till morning,” Cas sighs. “Dean, do you wanna take an Ativan? It’ll help you get back to sleep.”
It’s smut time. 😳
“What did you give him, Sam?” Dean asks, narrowing his eyes.
“Thanks,” Dean replies.
Eventually, he gives up, sitting up and flipping on the light, reaching for his sketchpad and iPod. He turns on some Black Sabbath. Maybe it's because he knows how much his parents would hate it, but Sabbath is quickly becoming one of his favorites. As
,” Dean says in feigned awe, “are you…
When the woman at the front desk asks what he needs to be seen for, he simply holds up his right hand.
"Sam is smart and cautious, but I truly do not feel unwell, and I promise I will tell you if that changes." Cas gazes at Dean sincerely.
want to be with me?” Cas asks, utterly confused.
“I dunno,” Sam mumbles, “I’m not brave like you.”
“When you were younger. When John was gone.” Dean remembers well, many cold nights in the back seat of the Impala, arms wrapped around a shivering, much smaller, Sammy.
“Just leave him alone.”
“Aww, now
“Physically? Ok, I guess. A little sore.” This reminds Dean to find Cas’s pain meds. He hands Castiel a small pill and a glass of water. “Mentally?” Cas continues, “I don’t know. What am I doing here, Dean?” Castiel sounds utterly defeated.
“Why, Dean?
“Hold on, angel,” Dean smirks and guns it, dirt flying out behind them. Dean laughs as he jerks the wheel, and they spin around, followed by the sound of mud raining on the roof.
“Goodnight Dean.”
; they have such a history, and Dean would have laughed too if he was told then what he knows now. But all of that aside, Dean finds himself impatient to return to the room where Cas is laying in bed waiting for him. He wants this day to be perfect, and his stomach does somersaults thinking about his hopes for the evening.
Dean’s breath catches in his chest at the sight, and he wonders how Cas has been managing to do anything at all besides laying prone in bed, but he doesn’t say anything; he just proceeds to dab peroxide gently across the angry red marks that criss-cross Castiel’s butt and backs of his thighs. Dean curses himself for letting these go untreated, as they now look to be in much worse condition than the marks across Cas’s back, and he decides to cover these with gauze after they are cleaned and treated.
“Yes, mom,” Dean jokes, rolling his eyes.
When Dean emerges from the bathroom again, he seems more relaxed.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Dean,” Cas says so softly he’s nearly inaudible, “I...” but he doesn’t know what to say, so he leans in again, cautiously, as if one wrong move will blow this all to hell.
“Thank you so much,” Dean replies gratefully, handing over the money, adding a generous tip for her time, the pills she refused to charge him for, and the hex bag she’d created for Sam.
first, old man?”
“Oh well,” she replies, “doesn’t hurt to ask!”
Dean rolls his eyes muttering "thanks, Dr. House," under his breath. Before Sam can scowl at him, the doctor continues.
“No, it isn’t,” he replies stubbornly. “You have no idea how important this is to me.” She must understand because she pockets the bills without another word.
“So great… being with you… and Sam… him knowing about us,” Cas breathes.
“Like what? Human?” Dean asks, his voice raised a little, though he tries to remain calm. “Cas, don’t talk like that. Human or not, you’re still you. You’re still the guy who saved my ass from hell.” Dean sits next to Castiel on the bed. “You’re still my friend. Look, we’ll try to get your mojo back, but if we can’t, you’re no worse off than the rest of us, and then you’ll just have to find a purpose. That’s what we all have to do here.” Castiel just nods and lets his gaze fall to his hands laying in his lap. Dean reaches over and takes hold of his friend’s hand. “Look Cas, I’m not really a hand-holdy, talk-about-our-feelings kind of guy, but I’m trying. For you. Cuz truth is, I know what it feels like. I know what it’s like to wonder why you’re even here. I wondered that a lot when I was younger, but then I thought about Sam, and I knew I was all he had back then, and I figured maybe that was the point of me being here. Maybe sometimes the point of being here is for other people, Cas.” Castiel’s deep blue eyes flash up to meet Dean’s gaze. There are questions there, but also the smallest hint of hope. Dean squeezes his hand again encouragingly.
“What? What’s wrong?” Dean asks, startled.
"Everything is alright now, Dean," Cas says softly, "or at least that is how I feel when I am with you." Dean has to smile, amazed once again by Castiel's magnanimity. "I would like to kiss you now, if that is permissible; I realize we are in a public space, but-" Dean doesn't allow him to finish the thought, feeling like shit again for giving Castiel any indication that he is uncomfortable being seen as a couple. He holds Cas tightly as their lips connect. Cas leans into him, their bodies connecting, electricity crackling between them. Dean can feel Cas's hands exploring his back, becoming acquainted with each curve of muscle, each prominence of bone from shoulders to spine and back. Cas breathes heavily through his nose, unwilling to break the kiss, even for air. He still has a difficult time believing that this is actually happening.
“Yeah? I don’t remember a ‘Castiel’ in the Bible,” Dean comments.
“Sammy?” Dean says quietly. “Maybe you should tell someone.” He is terrified of losing Sam to the foster system, but now the idea of Sam left alone with their father scares him even more.
“So, everything go okay today?” Dean asks once Charlie has left. Castiel hesitates before answering. “Cas?’
"Cas, what's wrong?" Dean asks again quietly.
“I dunno, okay, I guess,” Cas murmurs. “I mean, my whole body still feels weird from not having my meds, but my ankle doesn’t hurt as bad as it did, and my back has been feeling better too.”
"What are you doing, Dean?" Cas asks, hoarse, wishing Dean would kiss him, but knowing he won’t.
“Sam loves you,” Cas says calmly, “I doubt this will change that.” Dean leans over briefly to kiss him, a wordless “thank you.”
,” Castiel says happily, “like all my senses are heightened. There are some other things I would like to do in this state as well,” he adds.
see Dean again? He already knows that they will take one look at Dean and hate him. They won't give a shit that he feels Dean is the only good thing to ever happen to him
"Dean Winchester," Missouri says softly, shaking her head. "What in God's name has gotten into you?" Dean doesn't answer. He just hangs his head sullenly. He feels like he's in a daze, his fingers and toes strangely numb.
“I’ll hear you out, and we’ll see what we can do from there. You sure you’re alright tonight?” Bobby presses further.
“Yes, Dean,” he answers at last, lowering his gaze, “I would like to experience that with you. I really would.” Dean’s heart races a little as he grins at Cas in the soft light.
“Missouri thinks it’ll piss off my parents,” Cas smirks.
like that, especially if Dean were to know
"Seriously, Cas?!" Dean teases, "laughing at me?" It's still so odd to see Castiel laughing.
"What?" John said, his eyes remaining fixed on the television.
“Yeah,” Sam says, “I think she has a sister and a brother, but she doesn’t really like to talk about them. I think they get in trouble a lot.”
“Yeah, angel?” Dean replies, pressing Castiel against the wall, nipping at his throat. Cas let’s out a strangled moan. “How quick do you think you can come for me?” Dean murmurs lasciviously, palming Castiel’s dick through his pants.
is all Dean can manage to choke out before moving closer again and collapsing into the man’s arms. Taken aback, Cas freezes for a fraction of a second, but wraps his arms tightly around Dean’s trembling shoulders. He isn’t used to Dean being like this, so vulnerable. He takes a deep breath and kisses Dean’s forehead, Dean's skin cool against his lips. They breathe together as Dean allows himself the comfort of being held, finally allowing himself to be cared for.
The morning after Dean ODed:
” Cas says with his eyebrows raised as he reads.
“I know,” Dean says plainly, sitting next to him again, close enough their knees are touching. Dean offers up his hand again like he had back in Cas’s room in the hospital, and Cas grins, taking it. Castiel’s heart flutters as he stares at Dean’s hand in his. It
“You have no fucking clue,” Cas replies with a grin.
Eventually he stands, shuts off the water, and steps out of the shower, drying himself hastily before slipping on a pair of pajama pants and an oversized sweatshirt that Gabe had sent him from Harvard. Then there is a knock at his door. Before Cas can say anything, Zachariah lets himself into the room; he always does. Cas doesn't know why his uncle even bothers to knock if he isn’t going to wait for an answer.
“Sorry, man, hospital policy,” the orderly explains.
to corrupt your virgin… everything else,” adds a girl with curly brown hair and a mischievous grin, ruffling Castiel’s hair with her fingers. “Shove over, angel,” she says next, bumping Cas with her hip until he scoots over so she can sit next to him.
“Heh, thanks! Glad you like her; if you didn’t, I
“You okay, Cas?” Dean asks, “it’s okay if you wanna wait.”
“I guess you got a point.”
"I don't know what you're playing at here, but it's not fucking funny," Dean growls, feeling his temper rising.
“Cas?” Dean says breathlessly, and Cas isn’t sure, but he almost thinks Dean sounds
"And you don't know the half of it, Cas," Dean murmurs at a volume Cas can hardly register.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean says as he gets out of the car.
I may love this chapter even more than the last...
The highway is straight in the beginning, traveling through farmland and land that used to be farmland before developers got their hands on it. After a while, however, it begins to twist and turn through forests interspersed with clear-cuts as it climbs into the coastal mountain range. The scenery is beautiful, but Castiel nevertheless feels himself growing tired. Dean can sense his fatigue and encourages him to sleep, even turning Zeppelin's volume down. Soon, Cas is asleep, his head resting against the window.
“Who the fuck is this?” a new voice asks and Dean whips his head back to look at the man who has emerged from the Cadillac behind him.
"I understand," Castiel replies. Slowly, Dean shifts the arm Cas is holding, turning his hand over slowly until it is resting, palm-up, on Castiel's thigh.
“Fuck, I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean says quickly as Castiel begins to fall apart in front of him.
“That surprise you?” Dean asks with a grin, happy that Sam seems to be dropping the issue.
"I didn't understand it either," Dean replies.
“Cas?” Dean says as he opens the door, but he gets no reply. He steps out into the room, and quickly realizes Castiel is gone.
“Guess so,” he agrees, “long walks on the beach and all that.”
Dean’s eyes fall upon Castiel’s torso. To his horror, Castiel’s shirt is stained dark red with blood. It is still wet, and Dean sees that Castiel’s hands are also stained from holding himself. Dean clenches his jaw as the angel takes another shuttering breath.
“So, you want it same size and place as Dean’s?”
“How, uh... how did it happen?” Sam asks awkwardly. “I mean, I don’t need gross details, just, you know...” Dean glares at him before taking another drink.
“Yeah baby, let me hear it,” Dean urges again. He can practically feel the tension building in Castiel’s body.
only exist in his head. That would be insane though. And then he remembers where he is, and he is suddenly second guessing everything that he has thought and done in the past seven days, questioning every experience, every feeling. Did any of it actually happen? Did the pills and booze fuck his head up that bad? Or maybe he’s actually in a coma, and this whole thing has just been some sort of fucked up dream.
I don’t know how to do this,” Cas grumbles.
Dean stays at Castiel’s side through fits of restless sleep and periods of silent wakefulness. The sensation of full “humanness” seems at times too much for Castiel to take in. The trivialities of discomfort due to everyday itches, hunger, and stiff muscles overwhelm him.
“Plain black, no ‘hipster bullshit,’ no chance it’ll be too enjoyable,” Sam says. Then he hands a second cup to Cas.
“Bye, Dean,” he murmurs, clearly miserable. As Dean lets go, he slips a piece of folded paper into Cas’s hand which Cas manages to pocket without anyone’s notice.
“How’re you feeling, Cas?” Dean asks softly, meeting Castiel’s gaze, a little closer than Dean would usually feel comfortable with.
"Can't just drop it, can you?" Dean asks in mock exasperation. "It's just, never thought you'd be a 'tons of sugar in your coffee' kinda guy."
"Oh," Cas breathes, his cheeks tinged pink, and they finish the short walk to the cafeteria in comfortable silence.
"Sure," he answers.
“What is PDA?” Castiel asks.
“Well, a lot of kids aren’t here that long,” Cas offers. “A week is sort of long.” Dean nods. “They usually just keep you here until they don’t thing you’re gonna kill yourself or murder someone.”
Dean zips his jacket against the cold night air. He can’t seem to wrap his mind around whatever the fuck
-Pink Floyd
“Lucky me,” Cas groans, rolling his eyes once more.
can’t get possessed," Dean asserts, referring again to his anti-possession tattoo. Carefully he opens the bedroom door. “I’ll be right back. Don’t disrupt the salt lines.” Castiel is bewildered by the last statement, glancing over at Sam.
“I’m not sure, but they were talking about moving you out of the ICU, so that’s good. The doctors always seem impressed by the speed of your recovery. I was actually gonna ask you about that…”
He’d really fucked things up this time.
scares the living shit out of him. Dean is fairly certain that Sam doesn’t share the prejudices their father held, but something in him worries that this will change the way Sam thinks about him. He has always tried to appear strong, brave,
Before he knows it, tears are beginning to roll down his cheeks, and he’s struggling to keep his breathing steady, afraid he’ll wake Castiel and be forced to put into words why he is on the verge of a melt down.
“Dean, just put the gun down,” John attempts to sound reasonable.
kidnapped, but yeah,” Dean smirks and can hear Bobby sigh again.
"Oh my god," Cas murmurs, a little stunned.
“I think so, probably.” Dean can’t help a gentle smile at his friend’s naïveté.
"Maybe you should tell that cutie across the hall..."
“Oooh, do you have
“No, Dean, it isn’t.” Cas’s sorrowful eyes search Dean, quizzical. “What makes you say that?” Dean opens his mouth but it takes a moment before he can find the words he wants.
“I think I actually believe you,” Cas says softly.
John Winchester glowers down at him with cold, pitiless eyes, devoid of any kind emotion.
“Yeah, today was ok,” answers, “I pretty much spent the whole day in my room.”
throat for a change." Castiel says in a lowered voice, glaring with deadly fury into his uncle's face.
“That’s it,” Dean encourages, “I got you, angel.” But then Cas murmurs something that freezes Dean in his tracks.
"Do you have more tattoos under the bandages? Why are your arms all wrapped up anyway? Were you like, in a car accident or something?" Dean just stares blankly again, unsure what to say as the words are rapid-fired at him.
"So I would like you to please explain to me what was happening just now."
“You didn’t tell me there’d be needles, Sammy,” Dean mumbles crankily.
When they finish eating, Cas relaxes in Dean’s arms. He feels on edge but also rather warm and loopy thanks to the pill he’d taken, and although the anxiety remains, twisting in his chest, he feels veritably safe, melting into Dean’s side.
"N-no one," he lies.
“I sure like seeing you smile, Cas; it’s a good look on you,” Dean says after a moment of thought.
“And if you’re ever in trouble, if you ever need anything, Dean, you call me, okay?”
“Not gonna get bored with you either,” Dean finally manages, swallowing hard.
“My whole body hurts,” Cas groans softly.
“Uh, Cas? You okay? Did I say something wrong?” Dean asks, looking over at Castiel.
“Oh, shit,” Dean swears to himself, stomping the gas pedal and pulling onto the lawn beneath where Cas is standing. Dean throws the car in park and wrenches his door open, running out onto the lawn directly below Cas.
“Don’t mind him,” Pam says, “Edgar won’t hurt you,” she adds as a large black bird flaps his wings and hops to her shoulder.
“Yeah, Cas, it’s me. You okay?” Dean asks softly, still a little taken aback by the warmth that spreads through his chest when he hears Castiel’s quiet voice.
“Sorry, Dean,” Cas rushes to say, but Dean is simply grinning at him.
“Ok, Dean.”
“Cas, sure, maybe you’re not my ‘usual type,’ or whatever, but the way you make me feel… how turned on I get thinking about stuff with you? It scared me at first, what I was feeling, the stuff that would go through my head when I realized you were turned on by me. Cas, it’s sexy as hell,” Dean concludes, kissing Castiel again fiercely as if to prove a point.
Dean had told him so many things,
too, because it has
“What? What’s wrong?” Dean asks.
“Yes, definitely, I would like that,” Castiel agrees. And with that, the two sit together on Castiel’s bed, chatting about music, Castiel’s art, and Dean’s Baby until it is time for their respective private sessions.
“I said ‘I promise,’ didn’t I?” Dean laughs. “Her mom’s really okay with you spending the night, though?”
" 'S okay," Dean says, crawling across the bed toward where Cas is standing on the other side. "Just lucky I like seeing you smile so much," he says, reaching a hand toward Cas who is struggling now with his own wet jeans. Once he manages to free himself from the damp denim, Cas collapses onto the bed next to Dean, who gathers him into his arms.
“I don’t know,” Dean admits dolefully. “I’ve spent my life wondering that... But, Sammy, I am not gonna let that thing hurt you, okay? You or Cas. Promise.” Sam nods.
“My mother was killed by a drunk driver 20 years ago, when I was eleven. After the crash, she was in intensive care, but she never woke up. It was the worst experience of my life, but all the nurses were so nice to me. It’s the reason I decided to go to nursing school...but I never really tell anybody that.”
“You mind if I ask what happened there?” Castiel asks hesitantly, indicating Dean’s bandaged arms.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas says, looking up at him before leaning in for another kiss. Then, abruptly, Cas drops to his knees, startling Dean.
“That isn’t exactly what I meant,” she responds, taking a seat in the chair facing Dean’s bed.
Some fluff, some feels, and even more smut (what can I say? I can't help myself).
"You stay the fuck out of this!" Dean says to him without thinking. Meg stares at Dean with her mouth hanging open.
"Alright. Though I doubt I'll ever understand mankind's propensity for lying or denying reality..."
fucked up." Dean doesn’t know what else to say. He’s furious; he wants to drop a nuke on Cas’s entire family, but nothing he could say seems adequate.
And then he thinks about one thing Meg said in particular. Does Cas really jerk off thinking about him? He has a hard time believing that Castiel would actually say that to Meg, but even the thought of it... well it makes him breathe a little faster, makes his skin feel hot and his body all tingly. He can't stop the images that flood his mind: Cas, his face flushed, head thrown back as he lays in bed alone, lips parted as he pants, gripping himself, wishing it were Dean. And Dean just doesn't know what to do with that.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas answers, “these clothes are quite comfortable.” Good. Dean thought they would be. A member of the hospital administration enters and hands Castiel a final stack of discharge paperwork, which he looks down at like a deer into headlights. Dean helps him sign where he is supposed to, and he is one step closer to leaving. As they sit quietly, waiting for the nurse’s assistant who will escort them out, Dean notices a slight tremble in Cas’s hands.
“What are you talking about!? Sammy is in this fucking building!” Dean shouts, unable to control himself any longer. He’s seething. He can’t think straight. “He’s just a kid, and he’s hurt, and I’m all he has!” He spins around and punches the wall, regretting the decision immediately when he feels a burning pain in his palm.
“Hurry up, Sam, come on,” John says to him when he freezes at the front door. Sam obeys dutifully, watching as his father grabs a beer from the fridge, completely ignoring the evidence of the fight he’d had with his older son. Sam stands motionless as his dad crosses to the living room, flopping down on the couch, and that’s where he stays for the rest of the day, only getting up for the next drink.
"Fuck," Dean swears suddenly, running a hand over his face. "I don't think I'll
“N-nothing,” Cas stammers, then clears his throat. “Dean, why are you out here?” His gaze, visible by Dean in the moonlight, is penetrating.
“You look so fuckin’ hot right now, Cas,” Dean says more seriously.
“Okay. If you really trust him,” Cas eventually agrees.
“Who was that boy attempting to assault you in the hallway?” he asks abruptly.
“And don’t worry about Sam,” Dean says quietly, “he won’t say anything about what he saw. I’m sure he feels bad about even saying something to you.” Dean can feel Cas nod against his chest.
“Hi, again,” Sam says.
"Any idea at all where he was? Who he was with?"
alone; there’s a camera on the ceiling, but he appreciates the pseudo-privacy anyway.
At some point in the night, however, Cas wakes up gasping for air, his chest feeling like it’s imploding. He struggles to push himself up. Maybe he’ll feel better sitting. By then, he is trembling uncontrollably, tears and snot running down his face making it even harder to breathe.
“Maybe I am a piece of shit,” Dean spits at John, “but
content with kisses and lingering touches this evening. They settle in after a while, Cas curled into Dean’s side, his head resting on Dean’s shoulder, his hand splayed across Dean’s chest. Dean tugs a blanket carefully up over them, kissing Cas’s forehead with a smile on his lips.
Taking a deep breath, Dean crosses the parking lot. He can see the back of Sam’s head, crammed into the ridiculously small car.
“How are you holding up, Rob?” she asks kindly.
“Oh… oh, fuck! Yes, Dean, right there!” Cas gasps as Dean shifts his position slightly.
“Even after the, uh, the shower stuff? Thought it was pretty obvious I was into that,” Dean murmurs, wanting to dispel Castiel’s insecurity.
“I’ll see you again real soon, Sammy,” Dean says, pulling Sam in for a last hug. “Remember what I told you.”
Silently, Cas approaches and sinks to the ground beside Dean. Startled by the sudden presence, Dean rushes to wipe his eyes and nose on his sleeve.
Dean remembers snapshots of the day. Like single slides in a projector, his memories shuffle from one to another without anything in between. He recalls the fight. John, his father, drunk off his ass, like usual, using him once more as a punching bag, literally and figuratively. He knows he lost it, unable to take any more, grabbing anything within reach, throwing it, smashing plates, shattering bottles, screaming at his dad to just leave him the fuck alone. Dean remembers his dad storming out. He remembers picking up a piece of broken glass. He had squeezed it until blood dripped to the floor, the pain diverting his mind from the hellish reality in which he lived. He remembers rummaging through the medicine cabinet, finding an old prescription bottle. He remembers thinking about it but deciding not to. He doesn’t remember why he took the bottle with him anyway.
“Sorry,” Castiel says before kissing him again, adding  “I’d like to return the favor from earlier…”
“Oh, uh, I don’t know how,” Cas admits sheepishly, “would you show me?”
“I wish there was a way I could make you understand,” Cas says softly. The pair stand quietly together for a while before Castiel speaks again. “Anyway, this is beautiful. Thank you for bringing me here, Dean.”
“You ready?” Dean asks again, softly, and Cas can feel the head of Dean’s cock pressing against him.
“‘Night, Sam,” Dean replies quietly.
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice cuts through the tempest brewing in Dean’s head, and he looks up quickly, flashing Cas a quick smile from across the table.
“What?” Cas is clearly confused. “You think I should do drugs?”
“Why do you say that?” Cas says, tilting his head, his brow furrowed.
“Yeah?”
“No,” Cas whispers, “I’m okay. I want you to; just nervous,” he admits. “Never done this before.”
Dean only falls asleep just before the sun is up, and once it’s risen completely and the rays are pouring in the window, he’s awake again. He can feel Castiel’s breath, warm against his chest where the man still lays sleeping. Fuck, Dean thinks, why can’t this just be easy? He knows how Cas makes him feel: wanted, important,
"Ah. But no history of mental illness? Delusions? Hallucinations?"
Dean freezes, anxiety clenching his stomach. “I uh, I dunno,” he offers lamely.
"Do you have any idea what could have caused an injury like that?" Dean asks.
“Yes,” Cas confirms. His hands are shaking in their restraints; Dean grabs the hand nearest him. Cas’s eyes flash up to his.
“Salt line?” he asks as he approaches Dean, concern etched into his features.
"Yeah, me too, Dean. So I'll, uh, see you soon."
helping here, Cas!” Dean says through gritted teeth, but the look in his eyes tells Castiel he isn’t actually angry.
Castiel isn’t sure how long it has been by the time he is woken by a soft knocking on the door. He attempts to sit up, and the blanket shifts, revealing his back before he gives up and collapses back into a heap. As the door opens, he hears a gasp, and then a soft woman’s voice cry his name. She shuts the door behind her and rushes to his side.
“‘Kay. Bye Dean,” Sam sniffs.
“I’ll go first,” Dean offers as if he can hear the panicked thoughts in Castiel’s head. Gingerly, he peels the bandage off of his right palm, revealing the scabby remains of a deep laceration, a few stitches remaining in place, not quite ready to be removed.
“Hey,” Dean says after another few moments pass, “I almost forgot, but I made dinner. How does a cold bowl of ramen sound?”
This is where Dean’s nightmares usually begin.
"I'm sure this is all very overwhelming," the doctor says gently. Dean nods, staring at the floor. "It is difficult to say at this moment how well he may recover. With as much blood as he lost, there is a serious concern for permanent organ damage, including brain damage if it received an inadequate oxygen supply for too long. With abdominal injuries like his, I am also worried about infection. But I assure you, we will do everything we can for your brother. Our surgical team is excellent, and I will be overseeing his care when he is out of surgery and admitted to the ICU. You will be notified when that happens. Do you have any questions? Is there anything we can get you? Water? Coffee?" Dean shakes his head.
Dean kisses Cas hard when everything is done, and they both kiss Jack's cheeks. Bobby gives Dean two weeks off of work, and Cas is only in school for another week before spring break, so they spend their time cooped up in the apartment, getting to know themselves as parents. Getting to know Jack, Jack getting to know them.
"Don't let that stop you from stopping me if you feel uncomfortable alright? I'm not a great guy but I'm not a prick." Dean wanted to respond, but Castiel's hands were sliding around his hips, skirting along the seam of his boxers and dipping into them by his lower back. His hand dipped inside, the tip of his finger sliding between his cheeks. Castiel paused when his finger found Dean's hole, wet with lube and loose from three of his own fingers. Dean could feel the boy still against him, and his chest seized up.
"I've already calculated what we pay in rent, electricity and utilities, also factoring in Jack's necessities, a monthly food budget, daycare, our Netflix subscription, estimated gas expenses, our phone bills, etc. This is what we're looking at left over," Cas slides the paper to Dean and Deans eyes widen.
"Remember Hannah! You lived in Long Beach California. She took you to the beach every weekend because you were always so full of energy and it was right down the street. You loved the water but you liked building sandcastles more because she always sang-"
"Just Benny, I've been too ashamed to tell anyone else besides him. I didn't even really mean to, I just got too drunk one night and it all came pouring out," he said.
"Take it easy," the office waved his goodbye before starting back to his car.
"I know Clarence and I know what's good for him," she argued.
"Need you," Dean whispered, every spot that Castiel touched sang for more, pressing up into his hands, chasing their touch.
After two home visits, a lot of dealings with the court, a matched paternity test, and a lot of sympathetic looks, Dean is biologically, and most important,
"Why did cas trust you?" The use of the word
"I hate sending him to her," he whispered even though Jack had slammed the garage door.
Dean came first, gasping and biting down on her neck. Cas moaned when her orgasm washed over her, eyes rolling back, stomach clenching. Dean kissed at her neck softly, light presses of his lips to her skin as he pulled out. Cas turned her head and caught his lips in a kiss, running her hands along his sides, gently dragging her nails along his skin.
"Everything feels so much better when you're loose and so desperate for it that you'll just take whatever is given to you," his voice was like hot, raw honey dripping perfectly from an experienced tongue onto Dean's willing ears. Dean swallowed hard, dropping his forehead onto his forearm as Castiel teased at the waistband of his underwear.
"Yes, yes, Castiel, please. I want," he paused on a low whine when Castiel didn't pull his pants down, just left them undone. "I need," he couldn't finish his sentence.
"He's three months old, if she got pregnant that night, that was almost a year ago, it adds up," he shrugged.
in bed. They're making a fort on Amy's bed and apparently they need more pillows," Dean said.
"Is that?" Benny's question goes unanswered as she starts speaking.
"Fuck," Dean breathed.
"Now," Meg pressed the gun harder against his back. "I know Castiel gave you that hard drive, and you're going to give it to me or I'm going to go downstairs and put a bullet in your uncle's head. Then, I'm going to give my friend the word and he's going to put a bullet in your brother's adorable little face. Poor Kevin will be scarred for life," Meg whispered. "I can't hurt you because... well let's just say Castiel ensured your pretty body would keep flowing with blood, but there's no rules saying I can't lodge a carefully placed bullet in your spine. Now, the hard drive please," Meg smirked, walking her fingers along Dean's stomach.
"Please, please, yes!" Dean licked his dry lips, his thighs trembling against Castiel's waist, his stomach clenching hard, a tear falling from the corner of his eye.
"Your," he paused, voice cracking. Castiel raised an eyebrow, gently squeezing his throat. "Your little slut wants you to fuck him harder," he whispered over the lump in his throat, his cheeks blazing.
"I'm sorry. I know it's been years and- and I don't even know if you're seeing someone, and I'm seeing someone, but I can't.... I can't... Please," he's crying and he can't stop.
"Maybe I am protecting him from you," Meg said, pushing off of the wall to stand between Cas and Dean. "Maybe he needs protection from you. All you've done is isolate him from his son, throw Amy in his face, and leave him alone to sulk in his depression."
"Hey Cas, some of us are going down to the pool later, you want to come?" Charlie asked, smiling brightly as she gulped down a bottle of Gatorade.
"God, I don't know." Dean dragged his nail over the label of his beer, his entire body felt like it could melt into the ground at any point. "But it's affecting Jack. I love Cas. I love Cas more than I've ever loved another person, but Jack comes first."
"Do you know how hard it is to work out with a boner?" He asked as he approached Castiel's bed. She leaned back on her elbows with a little smirk, stretching one leg out on the bed and bending the other.
"You're ridiculous," Cas rolled his eyes as he directed them towards the stairs that to the left the apartment complex entrance.
"Yeah, that's, that's smart," Dean nodded, swallowing hard as they both stared down at the infant. "I gotta call Bobby, tell him I won't make it in," Dean slowly rose to his feet, breathing shakily as Jack shifted in his car seat. It was old, a gray that was fading and dull, it looks like it could have been taken from the garbage. Dean forced himself to look away, turning for the bedroom.
"You gonna let me in?" His voice was buttery and deep and it sent a shiver up Dean's spine.
"So good for me," Castiel whispered, grinding his hips slow and deep, making Dean whine. "Why are you whining, sweetheart?" Castiel asked, smiling placatingly as he ran a hand up Dean's stomach.
"There we are," Castiel smirked, reclaiming Dean's lips as he rubbed against his prostate, forcing his pleasure out of him in high moans and trembles.
He did his business and washed his hands with minimal anxiety, but his breath started to catch as he walked out. He stood still just outside of the door, looking across the room at their table. His friends and his girlfriend were all conversing without a care, he knew all of them had their own set of discomfort and anxieties, but he also knew they flourished in social situations. Benny was the only one who suffered like he did, but he was distracted by Charlie and Lisa. Dean knew he was fine, so he ducked over to the kitchen area. He was directed to the back door by one of the waiters and instructed to prop it open. When he pushed through, the air hit him hard. He sucked in a lungful as he propped the door open with a brick.
"I care!
Feeling eyes on him, Dean fluttered his eyes open, looking over Mark's shoulder and searching the dark, hazy house of teenagers. His breath hitched when he found the source of the attention. Castiel Novak was standing against the opposite wall, a red solo cup in his hand. Castiel's eyes were completely fixed on Dean, narrowed slightly, his head tilted to the side.
"It's only for a few hours and Mrs. Talbot will be there the whole time," Dean said, dropping the rag in his hand so he could nudge Jack's chin.
"Papa likes bees," Jack stated with a smile.
"Whatever," Jack pulled away and stomped back into the house. Castiel sighed heavil, taking the few steps towards Dean until he could wrap his arms around his husbands shoulders.
"I'm here," he said, voice shaky. "I shared my location with you, it should be a ten minute drive but I would very much appreciate it if you took that as a light suggestion," he said.
"No, my uncle is there," Dean shook his head.
to go outside," they pointed out, fingertips running along Dean's spine.
"I'm sorry, kid, it's not my business to share. You know what Castiel wants you to know: nothing," Ash squeezed his shoulder with another tight smile that Dean assumed is supposed to be akin to sympathy. Dean wanted to protest, wanted to demand that Ash tell him what was on the hard drive, or demand to know what the hell those pictures are, but most of all he wanted to know if Castiel was okay. He took a deep, steadying breath, and stepped back to the door, trusting Castiel.
"Seriously," Lisa Braeden agreed, twirling her ponytail around her hand.
Next time wasn't too far away if the universe had anything to say about it.
"Is he okay?" Cas asked as he walked out of the room.
"Cas!" He called again. Jack took hold of his hand as his little face melted with disappointment. Dean walked Jack further into the house, peeking into the bedroom and the kitchen, even wandering out to the garage. They checked upstairs and the backyard, but Cas was nowhere the be found. Dean was doing his best to keep his anger hidden as he guided Jack to the living room.
Dean startled awake, his heart immediately starting to race. His phone was buzzing beneath his pillow and he grabbed at it blearily. The room was completely dark and nothing seemed out of place, so he peered down at his phone to see what had woken him. He popped into a sitting position and his eyes went clear as Castiel's contact flashed on the screen. Dean accepted the call and pressed his phone to his ear with a soft "Cas?"
"Do you like it?" Dean asked nervously once Jack was sound asleep in his new bedroom, the walls a soft blue with a space theme. He wrapped his arms around Cas' waist as they stood in the foyer, the living room the right, the stairs to the left, kitchen directly ahead. Cas leaned his head back with a furrow in his brow.
"Papa isn't feeling too good, buddy, but your Uncle Sam and cousin Amy are already there waiting for us." Dean understands now why Sam was so insistent on going to the play. He understood a week ago, the denial just took awhile to wear off. Jack took a slow step back, head turned to the bedroom door he knew Castiel was laying in. He looked almost like he was going to walk over, and Dean almost wished he would. He wish Jack would beg Cas to go, beg his father to get up and support him. But Jack deflated, and he took slow steps towards Dean, head tilted to the ground. Because that's too much to put on a kids shoulders.
"Um, it's just my back. Nothing to worry about," she waved it off.
"It's going to be okay, Dean," Sam whispered, his own eyes hot with sympathy. Dean shook his head, overwhelmed by pain and heartache, he felt nauseous with it. Sam barely grabbed the trash can in time for Dean to throw up into it, heaving and gagging around his heartache.
"Why doesn't papa like us anymore?" Jack sniffled into his neck. Dean couldn't respond, his throat was too tight and he didn't have a satisfying answer.
"I'm sorry," she said.
"This is doctor Macleod, she's a pediatric specialist," she introduced.
"Um, I, yeah, thanks," Dean stuttered, slowly pulling his hand out of the other boy's grip. Castiel looked him up and down, cocking his head to the side thoughtfully.
"What's going on in here?" He asked, approaching their chaotic work station. He wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist before he could turn around.
. When Meg did it, he felt like a bug under a microscope.
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" Meg stood up, pointing her gun at Castiel. Gabriel used her distraction as leverage, grabbing the gun and pointing it at the ceiling. The gun went off twice before Gabriel managed to get it out of her hands.
"Cas, it really hurts. I can't-"
Waves crashing against the shore in gentle, unpredictable patterns. Sun beating down on tan skin, on mole dotted pale skin. The screeches of a happy child.
In the next picture, there was a man holding Castiel down by his shoulders as Michael cut into his stomach. Deans fingers clenched at his sides.
At some point, Charlie roped another girl into their dance, her fingers hooked into the loops of Dean's jeans, keeping him pressed close to the girls. Charlie's lips were pressed to hers, keeping their steady rhythm even while she was pushing her tongue into the girls mouth. When Charlie pulled away, she turned the girl around and smiled over her shoulder.
"Absolutely," Dean nodded hastily, pulling Cas along faster towards the apartment door, reaching for his keys. Cas pressed himself against Deans back, kissing at his neck, sucking at the sensitive spot behind his ear and smirking when Dean fumbled with his keys. When Dean finally got the door open, Cas pushed him inside, kicking it closed with his foot. He stepped away to lock it as he simultaneously kicked off his shoes. Dean dropped his keys into the bowl beside the door, peeled off his coat, and threw his arms around Castiel's neck. Their tongues tasted like red wine and the chocolate cake they shared for dessert ("how do they not have pie? This is pratically a fellony, should we sue for emotional distress?-
"I need two minutes in this bed with you," he started, cupping Cas' face, "just lying here with your arms around me, then you're going to fuck me until i can't stand."
"I'd like to say one more thing if I may?" Jack asked the judge, the man gesturing for him to continue, his face was steel but his eyes were soft. Jack smiled at him, then looked towards his parents. "For what it's worth, you'll never meet better parents than my dads. I could list a hundred things that makes them amazing parents, but all I really have to say, is I have never once questioned their love for me. I might be young, but I know what love, and support, and stability means, because I have really good dads. I won't get that with Kayla, and I'd much rather stay in my loving home. Thank you," Jack nodded his head once and threw a questioning look at Bela. She nodded for him to get off of the stand and he did so quickly. He ran across the courtroom and threw his arms around both Dean and Cas' shoulders. They hugged him back tightly, both of them trying to hold back tears.
"See you in a bit, babe, love you both."
"How about Frozen 2? Papa hasn't seen that one!" Jack exclaimed, his eyes staring brightly into Dean's through the mirror.
"It is. I didn't know how you liked it so I brought you a bunch of different kinds of those little creamer things," he held up a small white bag, his cheeks turning pink. Cas bit her lip, stretching her arms through the window to grab the cup and the bag.
"You want to take this somewhere more private?" Mark asked, pulling away slightly. Dean's eyes were still cast around the boy, fixed on Castiel's. Heat pooled in his stomach when Castiel's eyebrow rose, the rest of his face neutral.
"Okay, Jack," the name was foreign and stilted on his tongue. "No offense to you, you know? No hard feelings if you're not my kid, I just, you understand right?" He rambled as he slowly lowered himself onto the carpet. Jack wriggled a bit as Dean adjusted him so he could grab the trash back and dump it out. He gently lowered the boy onto the carpet, watching as his little limbs splayed out in a mock stretch as his eyes opened. He had bright green eyes that made Dean's throat close up. He blinked up at him, his calm breath hitching a bit.
"God, I can't fucking wait to fuck this mouth," Castiel groaned, thrusting his fingers against Dean's tongue. "Gonna train this beautiful throat to take my entire cock. That sound good?" He slipped his fingers out of his mouth to wrap around his throat, fingers wet with saliva and sticky with filling.
Dean absolutely had no idea what the hell he was doing.
"Hell yeah I am, no one messes with you but me," Dean threw his arm over Castiel's shoulders, "and now," he gently cupped their cheek, tilting their head so he could kiss their lips. "If you'll have me, no one kisses you but me," he said, his lips brushing theirs.
"Nope," Castiel gently pushed Dean off of her and got off of the bed, slipping her panties back on just as someone knocked on the door. Cas ran up to the door and opened it with a little smirk.
"We'll just have to ask him when we get home, but you know papa loves to watch what you want to watch," Dean said, glancing at Jack through the rear view mirror.
"Understood. Understood and agreed, I don't want anyone else," Dean shook his head, feeling a certain level of deliriousness. Castiel was fucking intoxicating, and Dean knew it wasn't the alcohol because his limit is higher than two shots and a vodka cranberry. This was a different kind of intoxicating, one that made his muscles tremble and his skin feel like it was on fire.
"Yeah, what is with that? It's like these people have never heard of personal space." Cas reached down to the floor and grabbed their bag of gas station snacks they'd picked up for the ride home. He cracked open a red Bull for himself and a Snapple for Miranda, setting them both in the cup holders.
"I don't think your roommate would like that," he said, getting up so he could throw the condom away.
"That would be nice. We'll have to make it a one or two week trip. You know the first two days are always too stressful to be relaxing. And with our track record, we'll need at least two days to clean and pack," cas said.
"So what? Y'all are fwb?" Dean looked up with a grimace, Bobby was smiling at him with all of the hilarity of an old uncle trying to embarrass his nephew with slang.
"Please! Stop!" Meg cried, her grip on the gun faltering, her finger lifting off of the trigger.
"Yours," Dean whimpered as Castiel slipped his knee between Dean's legs.
"You're welcome, now get some sleep," he kissed her temple, then leaned up against the tree, rubbing her back as she closed her eyes again.
"I tried so hard to be what he needed, but what if I just pushed him deeper? What if I was just supporting his depression? What if Jack and I aren't enough?"
By the time they were five minutes into their drive to Sam's, Jack whispered, "I don't like her." It took everything inside of Dean not to say 'me fucking neither'. It only takes five more minutes until they were pulling into Sam's driveway. Jack raced for the door the moment Dean set him on his feet, incessantly ringing the doorbell until it opened.
"Of course," she takes her hands off of him and he tries not to look too desperate when he reaches for her again. She takes his hand and allows him to link their fingers together as he slumps slightly, regaining his bearings.
"You're hookups," Bobby said bluntly. "You're eighteen, Dean, you don't have to be embarrassed about the fact that you're having sex."
"I've been corresponding but this is sensitive shit Dean, it needs to be done carefully so Chuck doesn't get away," he said.
"Kids almost got a full head of hair," Dean said, his heart pounding in his chest. He slowly brought his hand up and touched the boys head, just hovering and running his thumb gently over dirty blonde hair.
"Do they know?" She asked.
"Yes. Yes, Cas, want to be your cockslut," Dean said, voice strained, stomach curling with pleasure as Castiel slammed into his prostate over and over.
"Up," Cas tugged Dean up from the bed and shooed him off towards the bathroom, slapping his ass again.
Mark was a mistake.
"You need me?" Castiel reached up and gripped Dean's chin, his thumb and two fingers digging into his cheeks and forcing his attention up. "Did you need Lisa Braeden?"
"Do I have to go?" He asked.
"You want to repeat that for another one?" Mr Jacobs asked, raising his eyebrows. Castiel thought about it, she thought about throwing the detention slip in his face and maybe flipping a desk, but she couldn't afford it.
"That's not the point. You said that you would watch a movie with him, he was really excited."
"Yeah," Ash nodded distractedly, staring with furrowed eyebrows at the laptop. Dean turned for the door, his nerves on end and his head cloudy with fear and worry. Goosebumps gathered on his skin as he reached up to move the door stopper out of place. He saluted Ash as he unlocked the deadbolt and pulled the door open. Ash gave him a halfhearted smile, his eyes barely flicking up to Dean before settling on the laptop again. Dean walked out, stuffing his hands into his pockets again as he walked to the stairwell, his fingers grazing over the gun in his waistband.
Dean shut the door.
"Those girls were nice, they made me think happy thoughts about you," Cas said, smiling happily into Dean's neck.
"Yeah, sure," Meg snickered behind him.
"He was four when he was taken, used mostly for drug smuggling. An adorable little boy and a charming sociopath, Chuck made millions," Ash explained, referencing different photographs and documents, not that Dean was paying attention to anything but Castiel's young face in the photo. "Kept him real comfy, took care of him like a father would so that he wouldn't look scared for TSA. He took a real liking towards him, taught him everything he did like it was a family business. Did the same with all the Novak children," Ash shook his head.
“What?” Dean asks gruffly.
“No,” he chokes out, sliding to Dean’s side and curling in on himself, his body shaking uncontrollably, “it’s not you, Dean. You didn’t do anything wrong... I... I just...,” but he can’t finish. Pulling his knees to his chest, Cas wraps his arms around them and buries his face there in a feeble attempt to hide his tears.
sound better on vinyl!”
he thinks, he's really done it this time.
“You got any hit men in that fucked up family of yours, Cas?” Dean asks darkly.
“Don’t gotta apologize,” Dean says calmly, “you don’t got to answer all my questions.” Dean quirks a smile.
“I appreciate hearing that,” she replies with a smile and gentle touch to his shoulder, “you have always been my favorite.”
“Yeah, Sammy?” he replies softly.
“Damn,” Dean says, “still, must be nice, having money and stuff.” Castiel shrugs.
Dean studies Castiel’s face as the man takes in the view, all greens and blues and grays, stretching for miles ahead and behind them. There’s a faint smile on Cas’s lips that causes Dean to smile in turn, happy to see his friend experiencing even temporary relief from the fear and pain he has been facing.
“What? Really?” Sam looks like he would give anything for that to be true.
Dean returns to the motel that night to get some decent sleep.
“So we’d move away, just us?” Sam ventures hopefully.
“Cas, what the fuck!?” Dean yells up at him.
“Cas?” Dean breathes after an immeasurable time. Cas takes a deep, shuddering breath, still unable to bring himself to look up at Dean. Gently, Dean loosens his grip, running his hand once more over Castiel’s hair and down his arm.
"Dean?" Cas says as soon as the door shuts behind Leak, "what is going on?"
, huh?" he prods.
stoned, I thought
“Hmph.”
“Jesus Christ!” Dean roars with laughter, “why the fuck is your first instinct to let go of the wheel?” He laughs so hard there are tears in his eyes. “Oh my god, Cas, I’m sorry, that’s just too fuckin’ funny! I mean, since we’re not on the road...”
“Thanks. I appreciate that. You’re a good listener.”
” Dean declares triumphantly, letting go of Castiel long enough to make a nearly impossible shot.
“Yeah?” Dean says in a low voice, “you want me all to yourself?”
“Missouri!” Castiel says happily, “it’s Castiel!”
“Let’s go, sugar, you’ve got a visitor!” It’s Missouri. Dean isn’t sure how long he’s been out, but he rubs his eyes and jumps out of bed so fast he feels dizzy.
“Dean, shouldn’t your father be taking care of all that? You should be worrying about getting yourself well,” she says gently, with an appraising gaze. Dean knows he has to swallow his frustration and fear if he wants this to happen.
. The anxiety in the room is palpable, coming off each of the three in waves, and for three wholly different reasons. “Why don’t you both go back to sleep,” Dean ultimately suggests.
“Yeah, man, I’m here. What happened?” Cas looks up at him, his eyes dull, bloodshot.
“Don’t want him to hurt you,” Sam admits, his voice flooded with fear.
“Hmm,” is all Dean says to that. “I realize I haven’t asked you a whole lot about yourself, and angels, and all that.”
"Sure Dean, go ahead and wake up. Why don't you give that a try?" The voice is all too familiar, sending a cold hopelessness down his spine. He manages to open his eyes and finds himself back in his bed, in his room in the hospital. Maybe it
cocky, that she doesn’t have the slightest clue what he thinks about himself, but he doesn’t.
“I’m here, angel, I have you,” Dean sobs, cradling Cas, knowing it’s over, knowing there’s no bringing Cas back from this.
“Oh, oh god,” Cas moans, squirming under Dean’s ministrations.
“You told us we could hike to the top,” Cas says, adding, “I thought that was you, but I didn’t want to seem ‘creepy.’” Charlie laughs. “So, did you make it up there?” he asks next.
“You still want to talk to me?” Cas asks shyly.
“Oh god,
“Can you stay at Ruby’s tonight?” Dean asks gently, wishing he were there to wrap Sam up in his arms.
“A punishment for what, Cas?” Dean asks, still holding his friend’s hand tightly in his own.
Cas’s eyes scan the room, taking in Dean’s band posters on the walls, a couple ribbons Sam had won at a science fair, and then the shelving unit made from cinder blocks and wood planks that holds Dean’s records and turntable.
“Cas! Your vessel is dying!” Dean’s tone becomes strained as he tries to mask the panic seething within himself. “This is beyond my skill level! This isn’t something I can fix with a needle and thread!” Dean clenches his fists before burying his face in his hands.
"Alright, Rob, I will see you again when the surgery is finished. Is there anything else I can do for you before I go?"
“Cross my heart,” Dean affirms with an attempted smile. “Y’know I’d do anything for my baby brother.”
“Is Cas, uh... really your, um... your
“Cas,” Dean whispers, and he feels a tear roll down his cheek. Castiel’s eyes close slowly again, and his chest begins to rise and fall more gently. Dean sits by his side for what seems an eternity, holding the angel’s hand, and pleading to thin air that the next minute Castiel will be back to normal. But nothing changes. Castiel continues to sleep, if it can be called that, and Dean becomes transfixed again with the drying blood on the angel’s face. After a while he can’t handle it anymore; angels shouldn’t bleed. Dean slowly releases Castiel’s hand and rises from the bed. He paces back and forth. He is confused and shaking, and emotions well in his chest that are unfamiliar to him.
“How’s your ankle?” Dean inquires, and Cas pulls up his pant leg to show him. It’s black and blue, but the swelling is reduced some. Dean runs his fingers over the bruised skin, gently palpating the ankle’s bony prominence. Cas winces subtly but gazes at Dean with trust-filled eyes. “I don’t think it’s broken,” Dean declares, “probably just sprained pretty bad.”
Awesome! It shouldn’t take too long,” Dean replies happily, “do you wanna stay here or come with me.”
“Alright, he’s right here,” she laughs, “it was nice hearing from you. Hope you’re doing well.”
“You need money? I got money. How’s a cool hundred sound?” Dean freezes. A hundred dollars could keep Sam fed for a decent amount of time. He tries not to tremble as he turns around, steeling his face.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t go somewhere else.”
He takes a deep breath and walks toward his bedroom. At least the pain in his arm distracts somewhat from his mental anguish.
Things are heating up!
“Huh, well, guess it paid off,” he replies.
“Yeah,” Cas breathes, turning his head gently against Dean’s hand. He would give anything to keep Dean’s gentle fingertips in his hair, his warm body beneath his own. For a moment it’s like they both forget what is happening around them, but Zachariah quickly puts an end to that.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says good naturedly, “couldn’t help myself.” He walks around to the other side of the bed to help Cas up and wraps his arms around him. “Promise though, once we get back here, you can help yourself to the whole ‘Dean package,’” Dean says with a raised eyebrow, handing Cas another pair of dry pants.
“No,” Dean answers emphatically, “I love seein’ you this happy.” Cas smiles up at him, blue eyes reflecting the bright autumn sun.
end well. That guy has got to be nothing but trouble. Either, he
"Yeah," Dean answers, "please, and you can tell it to us straight. No need to sugar coat it."
“Mmm,” Dean murmurs, “I’m sure I can be quiet, question is, can you?”
“Thank you,” Dean replies softly, “I care about him, I really do.”
"Dean, I'm going to tell you the same thing I just told Castiel," Missouri says, taking a seat across from him. Dean raises his eyebrows, a nonverbal question mark. "From now on, I have to ask that the two of you refrain from entering each others' rooms. Like I told Castiel, you're not 'in trouble,' and you may still speak with each other, but you need to be out in the open."
“How’s that feel, angel?” Dean breathes into Cas’s ear, nipping playfully at his earlobe. Cas groans again, struggling to speak.
close.”
"Dean, are you sure you're alright?" she asks concernedly.
“You come by here first thing tomorrow, hear, me?” Bobby asks sternly.
from my room?” Cas grumbles.
a feeling he never truly thought he’d be fortunate enough to experience. Dean’s skin is warm, pressed against his own. Dean’s heart thumps out a steady, soothing rhythm beneath his ear, and soon, Cas is sleeping peacefully, dreamless and restful.
“The nurse can give you drugs for that, Cas. Have you asked?” He hasn’t. Dean leaves briefly and returns with Sara.
“Cassie, come on!” Meg calls after him, but shrugs, turning back to Dean when Castiel doesn’t respond and disappears through the door.
about me?”
“No,” Dean replies, finally looking over at Castiel, tears in his eyes, “I mean… what’s happening? What are we doing? I mean, we can’t, right?”
“Yes. I remember,” he answers, running his tongue over his bottom lip unconsciously.
“Yeah, man, I hear you,” Dean smiles, clapping Cas on the shoulder. “We make everything more complicated than it needs to be. For being so advanced, we’re kinda a dumb species.” Castiel’s lips quirk into a smile.
“Not in the same way,” Castiel answers, shaking his head. “It’s… well, it’s hard to explain, but it was more a sense of satisfaction or pride in a ‘job well done’ sort of way, like if I had accomplished a goal or carried out orders in a satisfactory manner. Human happiness is… warmer.”
"Oh, Dean," Missouri sighs in sympathy, "you try and ignore her, okay? Castiel exists; you're not insane. Looks like I need to have
“Dean, why does Bridget keep falling for Daniel, when Mark is
As they turn onto Dean’s street, he turns to Cas.
“Yeah, she seems cool,” Dean says, running his fingers gently through Castiel’s soft, mussed-up hair.
"Try me," Cas challenges. Dean's gaze falls then to Castiel's hand on his shoulder, and Cas quickly moves it. "Sorry," he murmurs.
When Dean returns to the motel room with the food he’d picked up, Cas is at the tail-end of another dumb chick flick. He’s been watching far too many romantic comedies for Dean’s liking. Dean did get him to watch
“Do you mind taking your shirt off again?” Dean asks. “I just want to put some more stuff on your back.” Cas nods, and Dean retrieves the antibiotic ointment. Sitting behind Cas, he spreads the ointment gently over each wound. “I think they’re already looking a little less red,” Dean offers, putting the cap back on the tube and crawling up to lay down on the bed. He reaches for Cas, who eagerly curls up in his arms.
“I’m not runnin’, remember?” Dean says softly. Cas exhales audibly, smiling and biting his lip before leaning in to kiss Dean again. Then Dean’s hand is on his dick, causing Cas to gasp loudly, a jolt of excitement running through him. “Gonna take care of you,” Dean murmurs, stroking Cas up and down. Cas throws his head back, squeezing his eyes shut as Dean glances around the room for something slippery. He makes a mental note to buy lube, but until then, he figures the tiny bottle of hotel lotion will have to do. He lotions up his hand and returns to Cas, who moans as Dean’s hand wraps firmly around his dick again. Dean has always gotten off on the sounds he can elicit from his partners, and Castiel’s gasps and moans and shuddering breaths have him hard and dripping in no time.
Once again, Castiel finds himself getting his hopes up, desperately wanting to talk with Dean again soon. He tries to tell himself he’s only setting himself up for disappointment, but he just can’t help it. So he lays awakes, thinking about Dean as The Beatles sing in his ears.
“Cool,” he says as he sets everything on the bedside table before kicking off his jeans, “well I get to pick the next movie.” Castiel smiles, agreeing as Dean hands him a beer and crawls into bed next to him. Being like this with Dean feels better than Castiel had even imagined, Dean joking with him, completely at ease, leaning into each other’s warmth. When the popcorn is finished, Dean snakes his arm around Castiel, encouraging him to lean against him, kissing the side of his head when he does. Castiel smiles, snuggling even closer, so grateful to be the object of this man’s affection.
“Shit, Cas,” Dean laughs, “you make me feel like a fuckin’ teenager again.”
“Why am I what?” Dean stares at his friend blankly.
“Yes and no, I suppose,” Castiel replies, “it depends on whose perspective you look at it from. In the grand scheme of things, yes, it was probably pointless. But through human eyes, I imagine it served many purposes.” Dean laughs a little.
“Yes, I suppose that would be nice,” Cas concedes.
under the kingdom
At lunch, Castiel sits in his usual spot. He tells himself he’s going to do it; he’s going to say ‘hello’ to Dean, if Dean sits in
you looked familiar!” she grins.
"Oh, like in my bedroom with the door locked," Cas says, rolling his eyes.
“I love you, Dean,” Castiel murmurs against Dean’s lips.
"Listen, Cas, you're not goin' to that fucking place, you hear me?" Dean whispers urgently.
It drives Dean a little crazy with lust, what each little touch, each little brush of lips can do to Cas, and he doesn’t think he has ever been with a partner who made him feel this
“Shhh,” Dean soothes, pulling Cas into his arms again, holding him securely. “It’s okay, Cas; I’m sure whatever it is, you don’t got anything to be embarrassed of.” Cas listens to the reassuring thump of Dean’s heart, focuses on the gentle fingers tangling in his hair, and thinks back to those moments in the hospital where he would have given
Dean thinks to himself.
He passes out for a short time, but it’s a restless sleep at best, and when he wakes, it’s to a spinning room and a churning stomach. As quick as he can manage, he rolls out of bed, falling to the floor, before rising and stumbling toward the bathroom. He crashes through the bathroom door, falling in a heap in front of the toilet, and just barely in time before the vomiting commences. He doesn’t hear Dean stirring or calling his name until Dean is standing in the doorframe holding the empty bottle.
Dean eventually gets Castiel up and dressed, and they end up walking along the waterfront, looking across the river to the east side of the city. Whenever Cas needs a break, they find a bench and sit, watching people pass by running, walking, or biking. Women with dogs on leashes, a guy with a cat in a backpack, even one dude on a frickin’ unicycle. Cas sits a little too close, but Dean doesn’t say anything, and no one seems to pay attention anyway. A young woman jogs past, flashing a smile and lingering glance at Dean, but he is too preoccupied with Cas’ mood to give much notice.
“That’s because it’s all nonsense,” Sam replies. “Dean’s views on ‘manhood’ are antiquated to say the least.” Cas nods slowly, glancing from one brother to the next.
“Fuck. How much, exactly,
Dean gasps, and he comes hard, the question ringing in his head. He buries his face in Castiel’s shoulder, riding out his orgasm, knowing Cas is likely confused by the response he received. Cas runs his hands up the back of Dean’s neck, though, gently brushing through his short hair.  “Oh fuck,” Dean moans more quietly as he shifts positions, his overly sensitive cock rubbing hard against Castiel’s hip as Dean slides off him to his side. For a few minutes the pair lays in silence, Dean feeling rather stunned, and Cas wondering whether he had said something wrong again.
“Do dogs always act like that with you?” Dean asks as they sit at an outdoor table near the German shepherd.
“Well it’s just a quarter mile to the bridge,” the woman says cheerfully, referring to the bridge, constructed in 1914, that spans the lower portion of the falls around 70 feet up from the lower pool. “It’s totally worth the walk!” She smiles again as she starts toward the trail, wishing them a good day.
“I’m not,” Cas responds, “really, I’m glad you know. You’re right; it did help. I’d just been dreading the ‘telling you’ part so badly. I knew I probably would someday, but I just couldn’t imagine saying it all out loud. It’s like the weight has lifted a little though, now.” Dean sighs and pulls him in close again, pressing his lips to Castiel’s forehead. Just then, his phone rings. He curses but rushes to get to it in case it’s Sammy. It isn’t.
“But... I dunno,” Cas murmurs, his throat feeling raw, “sometimes I don’t even think I can call it ‘force.’ I never said ‘no’... never fought back.”
“Really, Cas, it’s fine, I’m fine, but, we could both probably use some sleep,” Dean replies quickly, wanting desperately to both shut this down, and simultaneously let Castiel do whatever it was he wanted to do. When they were kissing, touching each other, it was great, like his body just knew instinctively what to do; now, however, they’re talking, Dean’s brain is involved, and it’s just fucking the whole thing up.
“Of course, mijo. Anything else?”
“No,” Cas answers, “not even a BB gun. Never even seen one before in real life.”
