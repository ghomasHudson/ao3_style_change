And Tony wants to. It's about more than giving Steve pleasure, making Steve feel as good as Tony feels. It's selfish, too — to have that kind of sway over Steve, to explore his beautiful body, to touch and taste him and make him come.
She blinks at him. "No. Tony, you're not getting it. It wasn't about the aqueducts. It was about giving you something. A project. It was about giving you the opportunity to design, to build, to be a part of this kingdom in a way you could
"Yeah?" Pepper asks, eyes warm and twinkling happily as she slides into the chair beside him, leaning her head in conspiratorially. "He was good to you?"
"Huh," Tony says, giving them both a nonchalant grin. "I'll admit I wouldn't have expected you to just come right out and ask it."
"Yeah, yeah, do it, knot me, fuck, please," Tony is gasping, and Steve is so close, he can feel his balls drawing up, feel his cock throbbing and pulsing on the edge of his orgasm.
"It's not that far," Wilson says. "Steve never was very good at keeping his distance from his family."
"We'll ask them why they're coming through our borders, try to find out if it's part of a larger attack plan."
A light blush dusts Tony's cheeks, and he's beautiful. "Yes, of course. Was there – did you want to be present?" Tony asks
Tony gives him another small smile, and even that much soothes the cacophony in Steve's head a little. He doesn't answer, though.
"I think you can handle it, honey," Steve rumbles in Tony's ear. Tony keens, digging his fingers into Steve's thighs. "But I won't do anything to you that you don't want. Do you want me to stop?"
He's alone in the bed, which isn't unusual these days. He often sleeps longer than Steve, if for no other reason than Steve makes sure to get up as silently as possible, and does what he can to let Tony sleep longer. Tony has things to do, too — work to get done, engineers to talk to, weaponry to design. And he'd been taught, at the academy, to always be up before his Alpha, to make sure he's ready for the day, and for whatever his Alpha might want from him. But Steve wants to spoil him. Let him sleep, let him work... He treats Tony like an equal, but treasured at the same time. It never ceases to amaze Tony.
"Hey, Stevie," Bucky says, flopping into the chair across from him. Bruce comes in with more dignity, moving with purpose until he can sit in the third chair.
Their victory hadn't gone unnoticed. Upon their return to Starkland, King Howard had beckoned Steve to sit court with him. He'd insisted that Steve be gifted with a kingdom of his own, and given him the lands of America. Only once Steve had made it to the old palace there had he begun to suspect that perhaps Howard had given Steve the status and lands of a lord under duress or political pressure. The province was struggling, the people tired and downtrodden. But Steve had worked hard, had done what he could to motivate and teach his subjects, until they were more self-sustaining.
He'd spoken to some of the other Consorts he'd gone to school with, and none of them seemed to know anything about America or its lord. Tony had asked the servants, he'd had Rhodey and Pepper ask around, and no one had anything to say about Lord Steven. There were rumours, of course. That Lord Steven had infiltrated and viciously killed members of the Hydra horde. That he had single-handedly defeated the Red Skull.
Tony glances down at himself as Steve closes the door behind them, noting the bruises from strong fingers and lovebites all over his chest and thighs. It makes him shiver a little, this evidence of his Alpha's pleasure. As much as he'd like a bath and some breakfast, he'd happily take another spin on his Alpha, too.
"If spring doesn't come early, we'll actually run out of a lot of our stores," Steve says. Bucky already knows all this, of course. They've been talking about these things for months while Steve had waffled back and forth between asking King Howard for assistance and being willing to pay the price for that assistance.
Tony kisses him again, and he wants to say 'forever', he does, but it's so hard, hard to admit that he does want Steve as much as he does.
He gives his head a quick shake, following Pepper out of the room. Rhodey brings up the rear, and the three of them march to Tony's rooms. It feels oddly like marching off to war.
," he reminds her. "Don't forget that part, I think it might be the deciding factor in all this. Not just anyone is accepted to the Academy, you know. And I probably would have flunked out years ago if my father wasn't the king."
"Steve's room is down this hall," he says, waving at a hallway as they pass. "But Prince Anthony, we have your room just up this way."
"You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen," Steve admits in a whisper, and he feels his cheeks flush because that had been entirely too honest. He sits up straight, putting his hands on Tony's hips and pulling him to stand closer to the sofa so that Steve can rest his forehead against the bare skin of his belly. He inhales deeply, savouring the scent of Tony's skin and the waves of heat and arousal, before pressing an open-mouthed kiss just above Tony's navel. "Tell me what you want," Steve says.
"Exactly. And it's even more than that. What do you suppose all those asshole Alphas are gonna want with an Omega Consort? Some young, pretty thing trained in all the ways to please an Alpha?"
"A little light reading?" she asks, one eyebrow quirked up. "Somehow I don't think the best way to please your Alpha's knot has anything to do with architecture."
"May I present Prince Anthony Stark of Starkland, son of Howard." Ms. Potts' voice carries into the room. "And you are?"
"You'll change your mind," he finally says. His voice is quiet, as though he's admitting it under duress. "Once you get to know me, you'll wish you didn't."
Bucky bursts out laughing, completely lacking in anything resembling deference for the man who is, technically, royalty.
"I want you, I've wanted you since the moment I saw you and I will want you every moment since," Steve whispers into Tony's mouth, pulling at his clothing and kissing bare skin.
On the other hand, Tony had cancelled dinner with him days ago, and Steve hasn't seen him since that day in the garden.
Of course, Tony's own pleasure in it will be more theory than practice. He thinks that if he can manage to satisfy Lord Steven, that will be the most important thing.
And Tony… well, Tony has learned the hard way that he's not very likeable. His only friends are his valet and his bodyguard.
"Hi," Steve says, grinning at him. Tony's heart actually might skip a beat – it's a warm, handsome smile, and his blue eyes are twinkling in the sunlight, and he's so beautiful it hurts.
He dips a finger into Tony's hole, watching Tony's whole body shiver and his hole quiver and wink, trying to draw him in deeper.
Steve stands and heads awkwardly for the door. He stops, halfway, looks as though he's going to come back, as though he wants to say something to Tony.
. The sweet scent of some perfume, light in the air, but underneath it, oh, the spicy, musky odour of Tony's heat-slick.
"If you and Ms. Potts are looking for company, most days everyone gathers in the main dining hall for supper," Steve tells Rhodes. "Or you can take supper in your rooms if you prefer. Just stop by the kitchens and let them know."
Steve wants to pinch himself. He'd been doing well, he'd thought. Tony had seemed interested in the story, invested in it. What had he said wrong?
Steve sits quietly for a moment, going over it in his mind. If he pulls back, tries to look at it objectively… okay, well, he supposes he can see it. The way Tony had been nervous around him that afternoon in the garden. How he'd shut down when Steve had suggested that Tony definitely didn't have to sleep with him, nope, not at all. How he'd let himself fall apart in Steve's arms those nights they'd been together, shutting the whole world out and getting lost in each other's bodies.
Steve softens his tongue as Tony's body begins to come down from orgasm, gently sliding his fingers out and licking up the rest of Tony's slick, pressing a gentle kiss to the cheek of his ass before carefully prying Tony's fingers off the lace and letting it cover his hole.
"Right again, Stevie. Look at you, right all over the place around here. I'll save one for Clint or he'll make me sleep on the couch."
"I don't think you're all that excited to be here," he finally says. "But I don't think you're here to hurt him, and that's the only thing I give a shit about."
Steve tilts his head, eyeing Tony for a while. The Omega keeps blushing, using his fork to move food around on his plate without actually taking a bite of it.
For a long, horrifying moment, they just stare awkwardly at one another. Steve can't think of a single thing to say.
He lifts the lid off the stew in the center of the table, gratified that it's still steaming. He honestly doesn't know what he's looking for – the stew will still be there, and it hasn't been long enough that it won't be hot anymore.
He knows half his urgency is a direct response to the scent of Tony's heat. Their bonding may have been arranged, but his body already recognizes Tony as
with how Steve must have completely torn you apart, since you haven't been able to leave your rooms since he knotted you."
It doesn't matter. He'll go to Steve, he'll have dinner with him, and he'll take his punishment like a man.
Tony takes a lace kerchief from his pocket and uses it to dab at the spot, giving Barnes and Clint another polite smile. "My apologies," he says, tucking the kerchief back into his coat. "I hate to be rude," he says, pushing his shoulders back, "but I've got things I have to tend to this afternoon."
"A pleasure, Ms. Potts," Wilson says. He leads them to a large room, with echoing, cavernous ceilings. At the far end is a small table, but there's no throne.
As he slips into the steaming water, he sighs. As overheated as his skin feels, the water is soothing.
"Oh, love, we're not nearly done yet," Steve says, the words a growl and a promise and a threat. Tony moans into the kiss, shifts, and sure enough, Steve is getting hard again already. His knot hasn't even gone down and he's hardening, and Tony's mouth waters, his ass gets even wetter, because he knows it's going to be soon, that Steve will fuck him again.
The next day, Steve is in his office going through their ledgers, trying to concentrate. He's not having a lot of luck with it – he's thinking about Tony, and about what Sam had said to him last night. A knock on the door, thankfully, interrupts him.
Clint looks at him for a long moment, then pulls the contract out from under Steve's hand. "I'll get this messengered to King Howard, then."
"Seriously, though," Clint says, giving Bucky's knee a reassuring pat. "Why do they send the Omegas to the Consort school?"
Clint smirks, but Barnes' face remains impassive. "That's not exactly instilling me with confidence," he says.
"Hi," Tony finally says, breaking the tension. He looks nervous, and Steve feels a rush of protectiveness for him. He doesn't
Steve blinked. "But that would have made it sound like I had an expectation that he would. Like I was telling him he
"That's good," Steve says, wondering if he can jump through that window at the end of the hallway and survive the landing. He gives his head a small shake, then remembers his manners. "I trust you had a comfortable journey?"
of hot water pouring out of a tap in his own bathroom is heaven. To translate that to everyone in the kingdom – well, it'll take some work, but the subjects of America are used to their fair share of hard work.
"Regardless, I'm not disappointed. If anything, I'm impressed. I've been impressed with you since you first got here. You're handsome, you're smart, you're kind – Tony, I never would have given you those, if I'd known. I promise."
What if Tony can't satisfy him? He doesn't know what an Alpha likes – he knows what he's been taught to
Steve strokes his hand a little faster on Tony's cock, watching in fascination as Tony starts to harden again. The head of his cock is deep red, obviously sensitive, and Steve wonders how far he can push Tony, how many times he can make the Omega come for him.
Steve gives him a small, knowing grin. "Good. Because so do I. You feel so hot and tight, honey, I can't believe how good you feel."
"It feels so good, honey," Steve whispers against his lips. "You feel so good. I need you, sweetheart. Tony, I need to feel you."
It's Steve's second day back by the time he seeks Tony out – he knocks on Tony's door in the middle of the afternoon. Some part of Tony betrays him and hopes Steve will shoulder his way through the door and take him there, in his own bed.
He finishes taking Tony's pants off, then takes hold of Tony's ankles and slides his hands up that gorgeous smooth skin, up his legs to his thighs, to his hips and the lace again. Tony is watching him, breath coming fast.
"Yes! The Chitauri!" Steve agrees, pacing faster and gesticulating wildly. "Did Sam tell you that Redwing spotted
"Sorry, Steve, I just – they're ready to go," Wilson says through the door. "They're waiting on us."
this, that he's been raised to think his pleasure, his comfort, is secondary and unimportant. But he needs to set Tony's mind at ease. "I don't know why they'd want to bond an Omega to that kind of Alpha in the first place, but that's probably why they told you it could hurt. But, Tony, I promise you, I don't want to hurt you."
Tony shrugs. "I have a – a good memory. And the life of an Omega… well, sometimes you have to be able to say something without words."
To his surprise, her body language exactly mirrors his. She hasn't changed her facial expression but her lips look pouty, suddenly, as she glances up at him from underneath her eyelashes, lifting a hand to tuck a stray lock of shockingly beautiful red hair behind her ear. "Oh, but, your grace, you're a
"If you keep that up I'm going to have to fuck you again," Steve says, voice rough with sleep. "You're insatiable, aren't you?"
"I mean, I, uh, I have a pretty high metabolism, so I tend to eat a lot? But, well, there'll be plenty, so you don't have to worry about that." God, could he sound like any more of an idiot?
rights, according to some of their lectures at the Academy. Of course, the professors had always told them about these outer provinces with an air of disgust, and all the Omegas in Tony's classes had nodded dutifully because yes, of course, Omegas don't
Steve has to agree with him, really. Sending Anthony Stark to him as his Omega bondmate is probably more of an insult than anything else. Steve had already been fairly certain that King Howard hadn't
He'd known Steve had contracted with Howard. He'd known it was about more than just getting an Omega to bond. The food, of course, because of the harsh winter. But the soldiers. The ones who had come along with Tony and, now that he thinks about it, had not left the area and headed back to Starkland.
," she says, stepping forward and placing her hands on his shoulders. Her pretty green eyes bore into his. "It's
"Please, Steve," Tony moans, and Steve doesn't make him wait any longer. He doesn't have to bend his knees because the bed is high off the ground. He slides his cock back into Tony's body, revelling in the tight heat of it.
Tony thinks about the things he and Natasha had talked about while Steve had been gone. Her tales of her upbringing, her training. He silently agrees that they should have taken her. If even half her stories are true – and Natasha doesn't seem like the type to embellish such things – Natasha had come back several times in the interim, regaling Tony with stories of Steve – during the war with Hydra and after, his first days navigating his new power in the kingdom. The way he'd overhauled America's orphanages, made sure no one in the kingdom was going hungry, no matter how poor.
"You're disgusting," Bucky says, but it sounds more like flirting than chastising. "Steve doesn't get to pick an Omega, they already chose him one."
"The Alphas and Betas brought their chitauri scout home with them," she says with a little eyeroll. He can tell, she's trying to put him at ease by grouping the two of them together, as Omegas, as unspoken as it is. He's ashamed to admit that it does help. He does feel more at ease with Natasha than with anyone else around here. He's used to spending time with Omegas, after all. It's the rest of them he barely has a handle on. "They questioned him for days out at the border."
I had a lovely heat? What's that supposed to mean?" He feigns confusion even as his own cheeks pink – albeit for different reasons.
But Steve is different, Tony knows. And Steve had done this for him, seemed to revel in it, to enjoy placing his mouth over Tony's hole and licking and sucking his way inside.
Steve looks down at his hands in dismay, and Tony tries not to let his lips twitch up in a smile. Steve snorts, then looks abashed. "I'm… not very good at this, I guess."
He's denied an answer when the same kitchen boy comes into the room bearing a tray with small cakes on it, and Tony stares at the table while the boy, aggravatingly, seems to take his time in clearing their plates and placing the cakes in front of them.
"Ooh!" he says, bounding to Bucky's sofa with his eyes glued to the basket of pastries. "Bribery baking!"
"My love, my Omega, mine," Steve murmurs into the back of Tony's neck, both of them twitching with aftershocks. "I love you."
Their dinner the other night had been awkward, but at least Tony knows a little bit more about some of the people in the palace. Not that he's seen much of them – he's mostly stayed in his Chambers with Pepper and Rhodey, trying to stave off his heat.
Pepper blinks at him for a moment. "Gone?" she asks, face paling. "Tony, what do you mean, he's gone–"
Wilson opens the third door, stepping back to allow Tony entry. "This is what we've got set up for your bedchamber, there's a full bath in the back. There are two other rooms in this hall, you can do what you like with them. If you'd rather, you could have Ms. Potts and Captain Rhodes move into them, even. But I assure you, we have a full security team and the halls are guarded day and night."
"That's true, you didn't," Bucky agrees, taking a pastry from the beautiful basket that had come with the packet of contracts from King Howard's messenger. He bites into it, flaky crumbs dropping into his lap as he leans back on the sofa.
"Fuck, Tony, fuck," Steve cries, and Tony doubles his efforts, drawing Steve's orgasm out until he's spent and whimpering.
. He's fully aware of how soon they'll be in America. How soon he'll be face to face with his new Alpha.
He glances back and sees why – Steve's one-armed friend is on his way over, his Beta mate following after him.
"Nothing specific," Wilson shrugs. "But we're on the edge of the kingdom and Steve got to where he is by beating back more than one invasion into Starkland. He's not hurting for enemies, and he prefers to be cautious."
"I want you to have your own space," Steve continues. He's either oblivious to Tony's heart breaking, his stomach sinking with the feeling of being unwanted, or he's soldiering on anyway because he doesn't
Tony scowls. "They're making that up," he says, biting viciously into a warm bread roll. He picks a knife out of Pepper's basket and dips the end into a butter dish, dabbing it fastidiously on his bread. "Steve isn't loud at all."
They begin to head back down the row toward the gate, Steve trailing slightly behind Tony. When they get back to the beginning of the row, Tony turns, and is shocked to find that Steve's hand is full of another bouquet. A new one.
"Steve," he interrupts, putting the wine bottle down on the table. He's rough with it, and a droplet of red liquid slides down the side of it, staining the wood.
Tony finishes his intense orgasm, whole body going slack against the bed. His face is turned to the side, and Steve watches his eyelashes flutter, watches the blooms of colour on Tony's cheeks soften as his breathing slowly returns to normal.
"Of course I'm sure," he says, belatedly realizing there had been an extended pause. "I feel like I'm gonna crawl out of my skin."
Steve blinks, searching Tony's face for a smile or a twitch to indicate that he's joking, but Tony looks serious. Serious and terrified.
"Yes," Tony says, sort of hoping Steve won't ask the next question. Of course, Steve is bound to ask it.
Tony's embarrassment has faded, and he goes over to take a look over her shoulder. There are a plethora of choices, all different colours, different fabrics and shapes.
Tony reaches for one of Steve's hands, takes it and places it on the back of his head, bobbing earnestly.
"He likes engineering," Steve said, his voice small but proud. "I wanted him to have something he likes."
Steve leans against the headboard, resting his hands on Tony's hips. He licks at Tony's lips until they open for him, and then performs a thorough exploration of his mouth.
"That's good progress," Tony agrees. They'd been making huge strides lately with the war — they'd even managed to push the Chitauri army out past the borders of Asgard, which had been enough to earn them the support and alliance of Odin and his troops. The Prince, Thor, had been out to visit a few weeks ago on a diplomatic mission, and if Tony hadn't been mistaken, there had been sparks between the towering blond prince and one of his engineers, Jane. Tony imagines they'll be seeing quite a bit of Thor, which suits him fine.
When Steve's knot is fully formed, holding him tight and flush inside Tony's body, he rocks forward a few times, grinding it against Tony's prostate.
But they need the aid. So it doesn't matter how uncomfortable he is with it – with the possibility of the Consort spying on them, with the fact that he's contracting a bondmate, none of it.
Everything from the waist down is throbbing and he braves the dark floor to find the bottle of lube Tony had jokingly chucked into his bedside drawers the last time he was here.
he says breathy and desperate, as he bears down on him again kissing him; pushing his tongue past teeth and tangling it with Steve’s; his hands have found the tags again.
It brings him back online and he glances from his fingers to Steve, and even in the low light, Steve sees his skin flash a brilliant red,
He pauses then starts to breathe heavily, a vacant expression starts to creep across his face, “that’s, that’s not…
The bottle gives a snort when he coats his fingers; it’s the only noise aside from two ragged sets of breathing; Tony tosses it aside, it bounces into the drapes making them flutter and throws moonlight across Steve’s body, casting him in a perfect luster, so perfect he could have been carved from stone. It’s glinting off his tags that have stuck to the gloss of sweat that’s beading on his chest, it catches him off guard and he freezes, eyes raking for longer than they should “Tony,
The insuppressible wail rips from his throat and tears through air of his workshop, drowning out the low hum of electronics that always permeated the space.
He succumbes to sleep at some point and wakes up to light streaming in through the half-open drapes. Scowling at the clock like it was lying because he’s slept through what would have been his morning run.
aphrodisiac.” He smiles and sparkles when he bites into it, letting the juice drip down his fingers and stain his lips pink.
It’s surprise more than anything that stops them from springing apart, they both stand there pressed together from crotch the chest, Tony leaning his full weight against Steve.
Her companion cleared her throat abruptly. “If I do this,” She hesitated, only slightly, but Natasha picked it up and looked around to find herself under her scrutiny.
Steve grabs Tony’s wrist. “Talk to me. If not me, talk to somebody.” He feels Tony twist his arm and test his grip before he sighs.
you have to leave this alone. There’s too much emotion there. I think the whole tower has heard you not sleeping.” Steve glances away with a blush coloring his cheeks, confirming her suspicions that something was going on between him and Tony in the wee hours. She chooses her next words carefully, “You don’t have to say anything to him you know,
“Uhh…” Steve’s face is a picture, flushed and looking absolutely serene as he tries to piece a coherent sentence together. He gestures with a useless hand. “Don’t… don’t go over that side of the bed.” Tony slots behind him.
you’re not alone,” it says, “Do we trust?” Natasha presses her hand to her chest where the sound reverberates through her ribcage.
he whispers testing the air before he’s close enough to catch his teeth on the skin behind Steve’s ear.
give me a chance to answer the door,” Steve says hastily tidying papers that were strewn all over his desk, “What’s the big emergency?” he says flustered his cheeks steadily filling up to pink, Tony suddenly realising that this was the first time since
drawn-out movement and lingering kiss as Tony works his way down, lower and lower, he can feel him nosing at the soft hairs just below his navel; dextrous hands running down each flank and pushing his thighs apart; the sound of his own breath rasping, the slight pop and suck when Tony’s lips draw back from his skin; it’s overwhelming. Tony’s moving at an excruciatingly slow pace; ignoring Steve’s cock that’s pulsing and
I busted out of a Foundation facility when I took the….” Natasha looks at her and she trails off, smiling sheepishly. “You know what?
it was his fingernails digging into Tony’s bare skin instead, he groans into his shoulder as his whole body gives out to the dizzying waves of ecstasy that makes his ears ring and leaves his knees shaking.
The day hasn’t quite broken over New York and it casts the street far below in an eerie orange glow. The small flip phone she has flashes as it proudly displays that it has found a signal. “She’s going to hate me for calling this early.” Natasha bites her lip as she dials.
Tony watches him, bracing with both hands against the edge of the workbench, his eyes blown so wide that his irises are barely slivers in the overhead fluorescent. It’s the way Tony flinches, the twitch of his bare skin against Steve’s slow exhale, that raw reaction from Tony, usually wrapped in something expensive and now
“I wanna know how they did it.” Tony blurts slamming his flat hands down onto the counter, “I wanna know what they took and
“JARVIS, you’ve still got the data files from SHIELD, look her up,” Tony says to the AI without breaking his eye contact with Natasha.
and Steve gags at the fullness in his mouth because the angle’s all wrong, he chokes again and feels the saliva leaking out the corner of his lips. He adjusts his position slopes a shoulder and glances up, there’s eye contact, something they hadn’t had in the kitchen, Tony looks down a mixture of awe and desperation in his eyes.
“All in good time,” He says giving Steve a sympathetic pat on his cheek and pushing at his shoulders lightly, wiggling out of his grip until he reluctantly lets go.
It makes him feel sick, ties his stomach in knots, he was angry before. Maybe more than angry, it had narrowed his mind made it easier to ignore the stabbing emptiness that came with losing Steve.
“… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t…” Steve trails off, suddenly all too aware of the intimate position they were in. Tony almost sat on his lap with Steve brushing his fingertips through the downy hair on his temples whilst Tony stroked his thumbs across the delicate skin on the inside of his wrists. He goes to pull away and Tony instinctively grips.
Tony doesn’t react more than a shrug, still staring resolutely at his shoes, he’s not giving Steve an inch. “That’s it?” He rocks forward on the balls of his feet, “That’s what was so important you couldn’t tell me over the phone?”
Natasha watched her turn away shrugging off her grip to rub at the back of her neck, her hand disappearing inside the hood. “Is that because SHIELD doesn’t
“Tony,” Steve scolds again increasing the pressure against his chest, just for Tony to strain against it.
Tony watched the footage rewind. It’s late, he still a little drunk - enough that it's making him fuzzy, and after his tryst with Steve, his body feels like it’s unspooled and too relaxed to concentrate. He leans on the railings for support, vaguely aware of Steve shuffling up next to him, he smirks to himself.
Steve says breathless as his pulse quickens at seeing him reclining in a tub chair wearing jeans and a shirt unbuttoned to midway down his chest. The door clicks shut, and his hands start to tremble, he can’t tear his eyes away. He doesn’t
Tony’s back before he’s missed, sunglasses firmly fixed in place doing his best impression of composure, rubbing the pads of his fingers across the tip of his thumb.
he gasps, it barely comes out as a whisper over the hum of the refrigerator motor when Tony smirks and tentatively bucks his hips. Pressing Steve further back into the counter driving the hard edge into the small of his back. Steve squeezes his eyes shut because
Now it’s all he can feel, twisting inside until he’s retching into his lap because Steve wasn’t coming back, not now. He splutters coughing up nothing but bile. Pressing his hands to his chest that feels like it’s been stepped on.
She flashes him the ‘just roll with it’ look beckoning him to keep close as they step over the threshold.
He’s already out in the corridor by the time Steve catches up with him, he looks perfectly placed amongst the modern art décor and orbs of light hanging from the ceiling. Steve swallows’ anticipation; a quick glance behind them confirms they’re alone before he presses his hand to the small of Tony’s back, fingers rubbing over the purple silk of his waistcoat and steering him further from the party.
Steve settles on his elbows and leans down to kiss him, gently, on his closed eyelids, and wait for his knot to subside enough that he can pull out.

Maria but he'd thought she'd been light skinned. Oh well, it doesn't matter.  The man isn't tall, and he's slim. His eyes are striking against his dark skin. Steve bows deeply, trying to keep his nerves from showing.
perspective, okay? If Prince Anthony can't prove he's virtuous, he's automatically branded your whore Omega. The whole kingdom will look at him and assume the worst. I
He turns on his heel and heads for the gate, just barely managing to keep himself from running. God, he's an idiot.
Steve's eyes look sad for a moment. "I don't want that to be your life," he says quietly. "I don't want you to feel like you can't say something to me, okay? We're bondmates now. I'd like if, maybe, we could even be friends. If you have something you want to say, I want you to feel comfortable saying it." Steve holds up a hand to forestall Tony's protest, though Tony's not sure what would have come out of his mouth anyway. "Maybe not yet, I'll understand if you need time. But one day, and hopefully soon, I hope you'll feel like you can do that with me."
"No, Tony, you can't – I have to go alone. It's… I just got word. Some of my people managed to capture a troop of Chitauri, coming up on the south border."
"–He got word that a group of his men had caught a Chitauri scout or maybe a troop, I can't remember–"
"But how many people would we lose if we tried to do it on our own?" Steve says. "And if we send the whole army to the waterfront to keep the Chitauri at bay, who's watching our eastern borders?"
The garden is like a completely different world. Where the rest of the countryside is white and cold with the snow, the square parcel of land behind the stone wall is green, lush, and warm. The sun shines overhead, even though Tony had
Tony turns to Rhodey, trying to keep his panic tamped down. "Can you go see how long until my trunks are up here? I need clean clothes, I need, I don't know, everything?"
"What is this place?" Tony asks, whirling around to take the rest of it in. The gate has closed behind him, and the stone wall is surrounded by lush rosebushes. An honest-to-god peacock wanders by across the stone path. There's even a fountain in the centre, with white flowers and lilypads in the water. He can hear the singing of frogs. "It's
His eyes make contact with Pepper across the room. The strawberry blonde was between Jane and Thor, entertaining both. He blushes as she smirks and cocks her head to the side, her eyes flicking over to the blonde next to him, clearly happy for him over whatever the fuck was going on at the moment in front of everyone. Tony sends her a smile and returns his attention to his team leader, heart lighter now that his ex-girlfriend/CEO gave her unsolicited but welcomed blessing.
“Tony, if you manage to cancel training tomorrow, I will love you forever.” Clint begs as he passes them.
Steve looks down at their hands, front teeth biting lightly at bottom lip. “Want to know another shocking surprise about me?”
Steve moaned, opening his mouth and allowing Tony to take control. Tongues met together and Tony slowly allowed himself the freedom to kiss Steve thoroughly, taking his time with each kiss but barely restraining himself from taking the blonde in front of everyone here. The taste of whiskey and Steve making Tony feel drunk, chasing the taste off of the others mouth with his lick and press of his mouth and tongue. He steps closer, using his other hand to slip underneath Steve’s white t shirt, caressing the skin of his hip, then his abs.
Steve preens at the nickname. Tony was quickly realizing how much Steve enjoyed the nicknames after the first slip up, calling the man “babe” earlier… and then “sweetheart” and “darling” joined the roster throughout the night. Steve brightened up at each one and Tony refuses to stop now. “We probably shouldn’t be drinking this much, or smoking in my case. What if something happens.” Steve’s eyes became wide at the thought of villains jumping through the windows at any moment.
The team is obviously in shock, heading towards the jet in silence. Both Hank and Jan, who gathered what happened from the voices coming from their own in-ears, eyed up Steve and Tony as they climbed up after everyone. Steve tried hard not to flush in embarrassment and avoided eye contact.
. It smells like Tony was just recently in rut. Steve’s stomach clenches and he grips the rail behind him.
Steve finally turned to Thor who shrugged innocently, laughing as Clint just threw his wallet at Natasha.
Steve starts talking again, offering up some sort of explanation of at least some of his most recent arguments. “You usually skip out on debriefs Tony, I just… I just don’t agree with that and I have to catch you up on- “
He opens his eyes and when he makes eye contact with Steve, the blonde burst into another laugh. Tony joins in. God, the way Steve leans into him when he’s laughing… “Fuck, you’re so high.” Tony’s voice is full of amazement, looking around to see if anyone else seeing this.
Steve eyes up the SHIELD agents still being contained by Hank and Jan. “Looks like it’s something to bring out a person’s mating cycle by the looks of it, I’d keep the faceplate down Iron Man.”
Benson let out a chuckle, “Not from the smell of him dearie.” Steve pulls back in disgust as Benson takes a whiff of his neck. “Looks like the Great Captain is close to his own heat.”
Steve thinks about it for a bit, a small smile teasing onto his face. His handsome, sexy face. Tony wants to touch him and so he does, two fingers lightly tracing the blonde’s jawline. “Um…” Steve’s eyes close as Tony’s fingers goes from his jawline to the sensitive area underneath his ear, “I skipped out on my morning run today.”
Benson pulled out a gun in anger and started shooting haphazardly at Steve. “Clint do you have shot?”
“You? Captain Steve Rodgers?” Tony raises a single eyebrow, “Skipping out on a debrief? What other surprises will you shock me with?”
The blonde hums as he steals another sip of Tony’s whiskey, his cheeks flushed and a smile still permanent on his face.
Greg shoots him doubtful look with an amused shake of his head as Steve takes a bite of his apple and turns to the opening metal doors.
“Excuse me,” Steve huffs out as he continues his steady pace past a couple of elderly ladies on the side of the still mostly empty New York streets. “Sorry ladies!” He calls out as they move aside and then narrowly avoids a delivery man with a stack of fresh tomatoes in a wooden crate by his metahuman reflexes alone. He shoots him an apology with a sheepish smile and continues running past.
“How very dare you?!” Tony laughs. He feels Steve start playing with the hand still under his, fingers moving up and down the top of Tony’s softly, soft veins being traced unconsciously.
Tony’s breath hitches, eyes dropping down to the taller man’s lips. He wants to kiss them so bad, a million childhood fantasies replaying in his head. They look so soft, so pink…
Once the elevator door closes, Steve is on him, kissing him and pressing him into the wall. “Jarvis,” Tony breathed out,  head falling backwards as he feels Steve kissing down his neck, “penthouse please.”
Greg looks up from what Steve knows is his phone and not the CCTV’s posted around his eyesight. Steve does not care, a building filled with Superheroes should be deterrent enough for any troublemakers. “Good morning Captain, how was your run?”
Tony, ever the entertainer, bid his farewells loudly as they passed, Steve too embarrassed to say much besides a quick “Bye everyone… see you tomorrow... Get home safe.”
Tony laughed against his mouth, his mustache brushing against Steve’s cheeks to give him another small kiss. “Let’s make our exit fast.” He mutters and grabs onto the blonde’s hand.
Steve grins up at the tall skyscrapers; he absolutely adores his city. Although it’s not Brooklyn, New York will always be home. Every morning, unless of course he is on a SHIELD mission or a call for the Avengers interrupts his routine, he makes sure to go on a morning run. It’s not the same as running in Washington DC, his secondary residence, where most days it’s completely empty until 8 unless it’s a political staffer running around with coffee and dry cleaning.
“-Luckily Steve was there to save everybody’s ass.” The small crowd around him erupts in laughter at the conclusion of Fury’s anecdote snapping him back to the present, he plays off the startled look and pink twinge to the tips of his ears laughing along with them, hoping that nobody wants a ‘this is what happened next’ follow up because he’s not got a
anymore? I think there’s irony in there somewhere. I escaped HYDRA just for them to pull me back in as SHIELD…” She squinted up at the sky. The faintest spots of rain starting to fall, small inoffensive splotches that settled onto her clothes before soaking in. “I dunno Nat, maybe there are things I don’t want to find out; like you said, it was
he whispers into Steve’s mouth sucking at his bottom lip with just the hint of teeth as his fingers brush the tags again. He pulls back, and Steve lets out something close to a whine following Tony’s lips like they’re magnetic. Tony only smirks in the moonlight lifting himself up and slinging a leg over to straddle his bedmate and rest his weight where the thin material of Steve’s boxer briefs is stretched to breaking point.
He doesn’t exhale until the door shuts about the same time he lets his elbows give way, sliding down with his back against the counter until he’s sitting in the same spot on the cold tiles he’d sat with Tony.
how I saw my day panning out. I mean, I’m not sure I can hold my breath all the way to the top floor.” Natasha looks behind her, Sam was smiling his gap-toothed grin and shaking his head. “You know Cap didn’t tell me what we were going to get… I mean it doesn’t matter, I’m up for heavy lifting and all that. I just don’t know why you need me here?”
The footage cuts to a different angle it’s centered onto a display case lit by a green exit light. The moment hangs and there’s nothing. Then the same swirling shadows blot out the view. They solidify and twist up into something human in front of their eyes.
The penthouse sits on the upper levels of Stark Tower overlooking the city, it’s all floor to ceiling glass windows and silk sheets on a king-sized bed. The full moon hangs like high noon in the sky casting silver tendrils into the bedroom where the drapes haven’t been fully closed.
disappointed he’s asleep as he slips in between the sheets, lifting Tony’s arm and easing himself underneath it; he stirs, mumbling and moves closer to the warm body now occupying his bed, wriggling back underneath the cover; his hand that’s now resting across Steve slowly comes to life.
Steve Rogers pushes Tony back into the mattress as he lets the under-sheath leach under his skin like liquid gold.
“I was planning to." Tony’s voice is strained, and he thrusts making Steve grab the headboard for support.
“Tony,” Steve clears his throat all too aware of the heat that was coming off the body plastered against his, “You should…” The
Steve trod careful, needlessly light footstep to the kitchen, he could hear whoever it was rattling around in the fridge, humming off-key to themselves until they startled at the automatic ‘swoosh’ of the door.
The minute turns into ten and they sit long enough for the motion sensors to time out and leave them in darkness; Tony’s warm against his side and Steve still subconsciously keeps track of his breathing in time with the repetitious ticking of the wall clock set to the background hum of the refrigerator motor.
“Err…” Steve can’t help the secret smile that starts to pull on his lips, the twinge of pink that was painting his ears turns to a full-blown blush of the cheeks when his mind goes back to kissing down Tony’s chest, dropping to his knees, Tony’s hand fisting his hair to a fucked up blond mess…
“Oh,” Steve says as they’re plunged into darkness. They both sit not moving but giggling in the dark until they hear a throng of voices approaching. The automatic light clicks on from the corridor and beams underneath the door.
Every time Steve breaks away and threatens to slide his fingers all the way out only to let Tony’s body suck them back in again.
“Come on, it’s New Years' Eve, it’s almost midnight, come watch the fireworks.” Steve points towards the panoramic windows in the common room. “It’s a clear night,
Waking up a little from the dreamy half-consciousness he had fallen into from the low light and the warmth and the fact he’d been on his feet most of the day. He can smell the strawberries already, carrying on the steam from the water, sweet and ripe, he leans his elbows on the edge of the bath and Tony feeds him the juiciest one from the top.
“You don’t have the monopoly on bad dreams Tony.” It comes out all sniping and sharp edges, not how Steve intended it at all.
JARVIS lights up the monitor off to the left, “Well sir, there was an artifact reported stolen from the Natural History Museum four months ago.”
Sam seems to jolt to life stepping around in front of Natasha, putting himself between her and Tony, “
Firstly, apologies for the time it took me to update this. Introducing a mysterious OC who's kinda minor
The door has barely latched before Steve’s pinned Tony against it, kissing him like his life depends on it and thumping his head against the wood.
“They took two highly classified SHIELD files and rifled through half a dozen others,” Tony says ringing his sweats he still held in his hand and staring down at the phone.
“So, what’s this thing on the monitor?” Tony jumps at the chance to steer the conversation away from broken hearts, feelings and somebody dropping the inevitable ‘There’s plenty more fish in the sea’ cliché.
“Fine. Show me.” Steve gestures with a wave and saunters after Tony, who’s bringing up various screens and statistics from his battered leather chair that's been patched up with crosses of duck-tape.
Three hours ago, he had been on the verge of collapsing over the monitors from exhaustion, now, lying in bed sleep was proving to be elusive, his mind racing a mile a minute as it struggles to comprehend the sudden drop in his anxiety levels; closing his eyes only results in dancing colors filling his vision, so he stares up at the ceiling, up at nothing, refocusing his breathing and listening to the sounds of the newly rebuilt tower as it settles.
“Is that what you’re calling it? C’mon boys follow me, I’ll show ya.” Dugan leads them deeper into the Area 13 complex, a monolith of adjoining warehouses sat atop and maximum-security prison for housing errant Supernatural beings. He draws a stogie from what’s left of his overall pocket and sparks it up blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke up into the windowless corridor. “This one’s a real treat for ya.” He says around another pull on his cigar as he pushes open a pair of double doors and leads them out onto a balcony. He gestures for them to come and stand by the metal railings and look out into the chasm below.
a limo.” He says disappearing into the bathroom, he comes back out with the forgotten strawberries and a towel that he tosses in Steve’s direction. “He owed me for ruining my couch.” He sits back down next to Steve and starts eating.
He manages to breath out, covering Tony’s mouth with another desperate kiss as he laces a gloved hand through his hair making a soft cradle between him and the door. Steve pulls away.
“So, we’re sleeping in this then?” Tony ask against the back of Steve’s neck with a hint of amusement. Steve answers with a deep sigh and a barely lucid sentence. Tony’s pretty sure he heard something about them both sleeping in worse. He stretches and yawns suddenly too sleepy to care himself. “You’re gross Steve.” He mutters, he doesn’t get an answer this time just the peaceful intake and exhale of breath from his lover.
Steve nods and looks back to see his teammates. “Yes,” he whispers, “We do. You were all so good tonight.” The rest of the gang were drinking and laughing with other SHIELD agents around the common floor of the Avengers Tower, grouped in small circles around the place, the blooze flowing and rambunctious laughter cutting the otherwise constant flow of loud chatter. No one paid too much mind to their two commanding leaders grouped together at the bar. Tony accidentally swallowed a too big of a gulp of Whiskey when blue eyes swirled back to look at him. “
Steve frowned at the memory of their constant verbal battles. He opened his mouth, intending to say sorry but instead blurting out, “Am I no longer hun?”
“And you usually stand at attention as Fury cuts into you for things you couldn’t avoid, but fuck that. You do great. As our leader and as a hero. I don’t see why Fury, of all people, gets to tell you how to do your job. Steve you know us, you know how to lead a team and you always make the right choices – I trust you to make them and so does everyone else.”
“An man and Wasp were downtown last I heard, they may already be there.” Steve informs them and with that Clint maneuvers the quinjet up and across town towards a harbor.
Tony inched back, feeling the drag of Steve’s bottom lip as it slowly unstuck from between his. Brown eyes met blue for a moment before Tony pulled at the back of Steve’s neck, crashing the two back together.
It took a half a second before Steve tightened his hold and he jerked the man towards the quinjet. “Don’t you ever talk to me like that.” He grits out quietly to the suit practically vibrating next to him and loudly for his comms to pick up, “Avengers, fall back to the quinjet.  SHIELD’s got it from here.”
Steve gave a slight moan, pressing forward, the bulge at the front of jeans pressing into Tony’s thighs. Tony gripped the blonde hair underneath his fingers, right hand still on Steve’s nape.
Tony makes a show of pressing the “Close” button on his side of the elevator numerous times to the amusement of their friends.
“Do you maybe want to go to bed soon? Sleep this off?” Tony asks, running his hand through the soft blonde locks so close to his. His hair is so soft, hair slipping past his fingers like water.
What a delightful, honorable, consent-conscious, fool to think Tony wasn’t close to just taking a kiss from him. “I’ll never say no to that request, Winghead.” Tony mutters, voice deep and breathless, as he meets Steve in the middle.
Natasha smirked while looking down at Benson’s still laughing face. “Joke’s on you Benson. Steve and I are Betas.”
Steve looks up to see Tony, his faceplate up and retracted already. Tony doesn’t look at him but raises a wavering hand. The hand scrambles a bit as Tony tries to find some words to spit out, “Just stop.” Tony says finally with a glare at Steve.
It was a vicious fight, harder than usual however they were finally able to cut off the bots from protecting Benson, the scientist currently hired by AIM to throw their own version of General Ross’ botched super soldier serum. They wanted to create an island full of Hulk’s.
Tony shrugged, knowing occasionally Steve enjoyed the slight burn and taste of the drink although it does nothing for him. His eyes trace the curve of Steve’s pink lips as they touch the glass where Tony’s own lips were just placed a few seconds before.
He and Tony were in the middle of what looked to be a staring contest during the flight to the Avengers Tower. Steve frowns throughout, wondering why on earth is Tony returning his own frown back.
“If you and Iron Man can get out of the way sure,” came the gritted reply. “You guys are too fast right now.”
He hears Hank try to distract Tony about some of the chemicals found in the waters, but Tony just scowls further and continues staring at Steve.
Steve looks down to see his own body covered with it. Iron Man was also covered however the metal suit added a layer of thick protection.
Thankfully, Natasha handles the debrief, talking to Fury and Maria on the center hologram. No one else says anything and he almost punches the wall in frustration. It cannot be that big of a deal, can it? He didn’t even know they were unaware!
“Look who the cat’s dragging back in.” Tony Stark smirks, stepping aside Steve’s frozen body. “Good morning Capsicle.”
“Our faults,” Steve grimaces into the drink and refuses to look at him, “Debriefs are important, they tell us where we can do better, what went wrong- “
Steve laughed, grabbing hold of his hand, “Doubt that’ll help us from causing even more of a scene.”
The thought of their sub-gender’s forced quarterly mating cycle brought the intrusive thought of Tony, with a beautiful unknown beta or omega, wrapped around him, kissing him, on their knees in front of Tony not mere hours ago.
Steve Rodgers for the first time since coming out of the ice was well under the influence. He was high. Tony stared at amazement as his colleague on a good day [hateful frenemy on a bad day] palmed his face in embarrassment. “You’re so fucked, Rogers.” Tony whispers, bursting into a small laugh and leaning towards the blonde, his right arm already outstretched towards the broad man next to him.
Tony’s strong scent was still in the elevator as Steve stepped inside. He turned around to see Tony leaning against security guard’s desk. The brunette just shrugs, “Board meeting at 9. Apparently, it’s a must-show event.” Greg kept his head down, staring unblinkingly into one of the screens of the security cameras now that his boss’ boss is nearby. He swallowed and forced himself to not inhale the strong scent.
“Tony.”  Steve nods, watching as Tony takes a couple more steps towards the exit, both men not taking their eyes off each other. It’s been a couple weeks since they last saw each other, both licking their wounds from one of their not-so-rare explosions post-mission. Although he did indeed ignore Tony the first few days, most of that time was genuinely because Steve was busy. He couldn’t say the same for Tony. “Surprised to see you awake before noon.”
He cursed all the way to sub-level 1, strapping his shield to his arm as he walked up to where the quinjet was already running. He saw Clint in the pilot seat and settled in front of the holographic monitor at the center of the ship. Natasha strapped herself in as co-pilot as soon as she jumped in after him.
More giggles and the two continue whispering to each other, like two kids up to no good. “God, where has this weed been all this time,” Tony touches him again, brushing a whisp of Steve’s blonde hair out of his eyes. He could not get enough of touching him tonight. Usually, the stoic man to his right was never so welcoming to Tony’s presence but tonight… with Whiskey running through Tony’s veins and whatever god-like concoction of dried leaves Thor brought back from Asgard in Steve’s – tonight, the blonde was practically hanging off Tony for the last couple of hours. Just one more step to the side and Steve would basically be on his lap.
Fuck, if only it didn’t take drugs for Steve to praise him like this. “Usually, you would be criticizing me Cap.” Tony grimaced, taking a sip to hide it.
“Babe, something already did just happen. We won. And now we deserve a bit a fun, don’t you agree?” Tony sips into whiskey glass, brown eyes stuck to the blue ones inches from his face.
Tony shrugs again, ignoring their friends as they continued to gossip over the two aloud. “So? We’re two floors away from your room and about 4 from mines. If you’re up for it?”
Tony pants above him, his face twisted up into ecstasy, little beads of sweat trickling down his sternum and glistening in the candlelight. And he’s so tight,
fault.” He’s laughing when he chucks it in Steve’s direction who ducks into the bathroom. Tony half debates going in after him,
Tony looks like a Forbes centerfold parading through the crowd in his navy pinstriped suit. The way the dimmed lighting darkens his features into something exotic and exaggerates the white glint of his teeth every time he flashes his signature Stark smirk. He keeps catching Steve’s eye, he’s somehow managing to do it from ten feet away over the rim of his champagne flute, giving him the:
He comes up level with Tony, looking down at him spread out on his back and pinned with Steve's knees bracketing his hips. His hand comes up to cup the back of Steve’s neck. “I love you,” he says tracing little circles at his hairline, his eyes flitting over the features of Steve’s face.
They kept walking, the distant rumble of the imminent rain audible above the rustle of the trees in the wind. “Nat,
storage warehouses last night.” Tony blinks at him. “The one upstate. They took down all the security staff, granted there’s not many in the facility – it was for storage I’ve never cataloged what was in there. Hell,
He wheezes, and the words tumble out of his mouth unchecked by his brain with his skin going clammy and knees giving out beneath him, Steve goes down with him and they crumple on the cold kitchen floor.
“Will do Nat.” He says returning the gesturing. He throws one more punch, just to see if the damn bag will split. It swings wild at the impact before wobbling to a stop. It doesn’t split, but his frustration has waned, possibly because he can feel his pulse in his knuckles, possibly because of his chat with Natasha, but he calls it for today.
“Death has a weird frequency. I can feel it in this place, but it’s not coming from here.” She pointed down at the settling earth, “S’just dirt.” Natasha caught her arm as she turned away with a sigh, “I miss our team, you all went off to be fancy pants Avengers.” She said as they started away from the cemetery. “How’s Clint?”
He’s asleep where he fell splayed out like a starfish on his stomach, covers half kicked off, exhausted after an evening of pretending to be interested in what the high-flying socialites of New York had to say and plastering on a fake smile, sneaking off at any opportunity to message Steve.
S’wrong with you?” Steve can almost hear the sardonic grin Tony’s wearing before he turns around to face him, it figures that Tony Stark –
Sam flashes Natasha an: ‘I can’t believe this’ look, raising his eyebrows and going back to study the photo in his hands, “they kept him in chains… That’s barbaric”
She leads him to a back entrance through a set of peeling black metal gates and past an enormous mound of trash. She’s not surprised to find the back fire escape door hanging off its hinges at an angle.
stand there any longer. He staggers, almost tripping over himself when he spins to dart away, in a display of un-Captain like clumsiness. Tony stops him dead in his tracks when he says, “Hold up there
” He goads pressing his palm to Steve’s sac that’s tight with pressure against his body; he arcs away from Tony’s touch his hands flying up to rake through his sweat-dampened blond hair as he bites his lip.
“Why don’t you come in,” Tony drawls, with all the boldness of before, leaning a hip against the wall, his eyes drop South, then back up, his voice going thick just like in the kitchen, “You can show me how
“Wouldn’t you say, Sir, that they do have an uncanny resemblance to the person that broke into your father's warehouse. Unfortunately, that large flash took out all of the electrical equipment so they were never sure of the exit route they took.
Steve said ‘chaperone.’” Natasha rolls her eyes, “Then I find myself in the Bronx with you trying not to breathe the air in a stairwell that smells like cat pee,
Tony clings to him and Steve obligingly stands with his arms held up at the elbows and awkwardly away from his body as his heart breaks underneath the wet patch Tony’s made on his shirt.
Tony’s gasps Steve glances up to see he’s still watching, probably had been the whole time, he’s biting down on his bottom lip like it was the only thing that was keeping him together and it’s the- Tony Stark-about-to-loose-control that does it, like Steve is privy to this small part of him that nobody else sees.
” Tony says hastily and gets up. “I’m going OK.” Steve watches him hold his hands up like he’s walking towards armed police.
“What’s going on Nat?” He says taking a step forward invading her space, backing her further into the corner. “You know something,” He points an accusing finger to the phone, “Tony’s nearly had an aneurysm over this.” Everything about him screeches ‘coiled spring’. From the way he flares his nostrils to the way he’s subconsciously balling his hands into fists at his side.
“Something on your base is pulling half the juice out of the power grid. We came to see if you needed any help.” Dugan raises an eyebrow at Steve.
Tony tastes tingley-sweet, it’s the champagne, it rolls off his tongue and his lips onto Steve’s. Tony tastes expensive, Tony smells expensive, he’s managed to reach around him and open the door of the closet pushing him back, his head connects with the hanging light sending it swinging, his foot catches a mop bucket and at that point, Steve reminds himself that Tony
Somebody’s going to hear him, the desolate sound of his sobbing interrupted only for the need to suck in air.
Steve groans squeezing his eyes shut when fingertips turn into a full hand wrapping his shaft and his boxers are dragged unceremoniously down to his knees.
was the soft feeling of Steve’s lips on his and the warmth that radiated from the much larger body still pinned beneath him. It didn’t matter that straddling somebody Steve’s size was awkward; or that he was still holding a bottle of lube in one hand; or that Steve was clutching him so tightly that the arc reactor was probably digging into him.
It’s Steve who breaks it, “I should…” He says gesturing to the door around Tony whose hands still rest on his chest, warm through the thin faded cotton of his t-shirt.
but he would get over it, Steve was going to figure out a way to make it up to him. As for the misplaced feelings, well they would fade, it was just friends …
“Area 13 smells like wet dog,” Tony huffs when he and Steve arrive back at the Tower. Steve chuckles pulling his cowl from his face and heads to the kitchen. “Note to self – don’t ever go back. No matter what, ignore any kind of
He snatches an apple from the Avenger’s Tower ground floor café and finally stops running, starting a leisure pace to the personal elevators on the far side of the security booth. The lass inside the café, used to the avengers snatching up her muffins and fruits, didn’t even look up from her novel.
Steve laughs and bumps into his shoulder, whispering to him, “Next time you skip out then, save me and take me with you then.”
Steve threw up his shield at Tony’s signal, refracting Iron’s Man’s repulsors towards the computers currently controlling the water supply. The 5 SHIELD agents on the scene were compromised, a mysterious blue substance thrown over them. The Wasp kept them separated as they tried to go for each other’s clothes and groins.
It was sweet. Chaste. Small. Both pressed their lips together softly, heads tilted and breaths intermingling.
This morning, Steve was hoping to enjoy a day full of some drawing and the Great British Baking Show however now it looks like he’s going to have to deal with an angry alpha. He throws a wary glance at the rest of the ship. And maybe a few other angry team members.
More catcalls from further down the room as more people started to take notice of the commotion and see the two so closely pressed together.
Steve bit his lip, red from Tony’s kisses, and looked at the billionaire in front of him, both their arousals still so clearly pressed up against each other.
Tony straightened up at Steve’s cold demeanor and looked at him in confusion, scoffing, “Really, still mad?”
Tony moans, his moving a little faster. "Sometimes," he says as a little burst of precome drips onto Steve's belly. Steve nips at his collarbone, shivering slightly at the sound that elicits.
Steve knows what that means. It's an invitation, Tony's way of letting Steve know he can fuck up into Tony's mouth. But no, that's not what he wants. He's too close to coming, and he wants his first orgasm with Tony to be in the hot, slick heat of him where he can knot, feel Tony clenching around him as he comes on the thick bulk of it.
She kicked at the grass again and peeked out at her. “I saw all the fancy new helicarriers get shot out the sky on CNN… Then, I get a phone call from you out of the blue. I call coincidence on that.” She fixed Natasha with her enquiring eyes. “You didn’t call me out here to show me where Coulson’s buried.” Natasha watched her push the hood back slightly the familiar swathe of short brunette hair falling around her face in an ebony curtain. “Spill it, what d’you want? And no Widow tactics,” she said pointing a finger, “I’ve known you too long for that, I see through it.”
is on the tip of his tongue when Tony shifts his weight clumsily from one leg to the other pressing himself closer. Steve sucks in air through his teeth.
Tony crawls back up, ghosting his lips and hands over Steve’s pliant body, letting his cock brush against his thighs and rest on his stomach.
Tony.” Steve does the only thing he can do, accepts that their tryst was over and tries to be a tether that’s going to keep Tony grounded. “Look, there is nothing we can do right now.” He rakes a hand in his hair and it comes away sweaty, glancing around for something that going to appease him; spotting the tablet that was abandoned, “I’ll watch the footage with you.
Steve damn sure he can hear the amusement in his voice when Tony’s beard brushes feather light against his pulse point, it makes the hair on the nape of Steve’s neck prickle from the roots, it coasts down his spine solidifying to a throbbing warmth in the pit of his stomach.
The panic attack becomes absolute. Tony draws in breath after agonizing breath which Steve is forced to hear rattle and catch in his chest like his body can’t remember how to exhale. “Tony, look at me.
it that’s all.” He soothes, gold-tipped fingers trace the outline of the star on Steve’s chest feeling the tense muscles relax under the softness of his touch.
He catches up with her a flight or two later, albeit reluctantly, “So, this ‘old friend’,” he says making air quotes, “Are we talking
He could hear Tony whistling all the way up from his workshop, it had been a couple of days since the kitchen, which meant a couple of days of Steve stealing glances at him when he wasn’t looking, hanging back after meetings hoping that they might talk and Tony inevitably making any excuse to avoid him. Steve waits in an alcove of a doorframe practicing his impression of nonchalance so that they can pass each other without incident when the whistling is cut off by the high pitch ring of a cell phone.
Tony looks on dumbstruck still clutching the screwdriver in his hand as she continues, “An old SHIELD case file for
Tony says leaning back against the counter, close enough that their legs are touching from knee to thigh. He crosses his arms and cocks his head, indulging Steve.
Tony starts to breathe a little easier, the shaking starts to subside, he stops clawing at his chest and brings his hands up to circle Steve’s wrist, keeping a loose hold.
It isn’t the least bit funny when Steve snaps his hips back, setting some damn near brutal pace going hell for leather. He’s barely letting Tony catch his breath between thrusts. He’s fucking him so hard and fast that words, noises, they aren’t even an option anymore.
